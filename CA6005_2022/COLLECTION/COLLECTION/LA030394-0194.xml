   <HEADLINE> THE RIGHT STUFF ; FROM IMPORTED CHEESES TO HALAL MEATS , THERE ' S A MARKET FOR EVERYTHING HERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ever-changing demographic of Orange County has brought with it an explosion of ethnic awareness . One way to get acquainted with other cultures is through the kitchen . After experiencing an exotic dish at a restaurant , there is often the urge to reproduce it at_home , something best accomplished after a visit to one of our many ethnic specialty markets . This is only a smattering of what is out there , but it is a good cross-section . A more in-depth look_at ethnic markets crops_up periodically in the Thursday Food section , whenever Linda Burum ' s pieces are featured . Burum , author of &quot; A Guide To Ethnic Foods in Los Angeles &quot; ( Harper Perennial , $ 11 ) , knows more about markets than anyone I ' ve met . In terms of pure exotica , nothing beats an Asian entry like the Bolsa Supermarket in Westminster ' s Little Saigon , which caters to both the Chinese and Vietnamese community . On a street lined with huge food emporia like Little Saigon Supermarket , Viet Hoa and others , this is my favorite . Nowhere else is it more apparent how the foods of those regions differ from our own products . First off , there is a greater emphasis on freshness . You ' ll find few processed foods in here , save the pickled and sweetened items used to enhance the Asian table . Second , there is a mind-numbing array of foods that we simply do not use in Western cooking . One way to familiarize yourself with these foods is to grab a copy of &quot; Bruce Cost ' s Asian Ingredients &quot; ( William Morrow , $ 22.95 ) . Another way is to mill_around in here , keeping your eyes , ears , and especially your nose , open . Begin a journey to this market in the huge produce section , where dozens of fruits and vegetables unseen in most Western markets sit on display alongside the more familiar ones . There are piles of fresh_water chestnuts , green tamarind , bushels of pea shoots , bins of thick-skinned pomelos ( similar to a grapefruit , only sweeter ) , betel leaves and dozens of fragrant herbs . From there , walk back to the enormous fish department , perhaps the biggest in the county , where live shellfish tanks stocked with Manila clams , baby lobster , crab and much more are flanked by whole tilapia , carp , stripers and an endless array of shrimps , laid_out , eyes open , in row after row . Several aisles are devoted to fish sauces and salted condiments that the south Asian table cannot do without : nuoc mam , chili_sauces , oyster sauce , flavored soys -- a staggering inventory . There are noodles , noodles and more noodles , fashioned out of rice flour , wheat , even beans , most of them made by local factories . In the front of the store are the rices , sold mostly in bulk packages of either 25 or 50 pounds ( expect to pay about $ 10 for 25 pounds , depending_on the brand and quality ) . Finally , there is a huge housewares section where cooking equipment , plates , rice bowls and chop sticks are sold . In short , everything you ' ll need to cook a first-class Asian dinner . Bolsa Supermarket , 9550 Bolsa Ave. , Westminster . ( 714 ) 839-8002 . Open daily , 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. * Pascal and Mimi Olhats of Pascal restaurant took a calculated risk opening Pascal Epicerie and Wine , a small French market housed in a free-standing building adjacent to the couple ' s restaurant . An epicerie is , in Pascal ' s own words , &quot; a grocery_store for spices , cheeses , canned foods. &quot; What the Olhatses have opened is really more of an epicerie fine , adding house-made charcuterie , pastry , fine wines . Suffice to say that there is nothing else like it in Orange County . This is a rustic , decidedly upscale place , done_in the earthy colors of a Mediterranean village , complete with slate floor , a wine_cellar and tasting tables . Don ' t bother looking_for the products sold here in Vons or Lucky . Many of these foods are prepared on the premises in a large rear kitchen : cooking aids such_as basic stocks ; pates like a smooth duck terrine , creamy chicken_liver mousse or peasanty beef daube ; packaged dinners ; homemade croissants and pastries ; great sandwiches like grilled lamb with feta . Pascal says it is his restaurant customers who convinced him to open this type of shop , but he confided that he has already pulled_in lots of business from the local French community . There are jams , vinegars and teas from the famous Fauchon in Paris , breads are trucked in daily from La Brea Bakery in Los Angeles . Cheeses , which often vary greatly in terms of ripeness , are decidedly French -- classics such_as Epoisse , Reblochon and St . Marcellin ( tiny rounds of goat_cheese suspended in herbed olive_oil ) and the more familiar Brie and Camembert . One of the features that Pascal is most proud_of is his ever-changing array of takeout cooked dinners , sold at $ 7.95. This is a chance to taste signature dishes from the restaurant -- sea_bass with thyme crust , a rich seafood stew and others -- in your own home . Wines are another draw here , and moderate price is again the selling point . In the totally separate wine room , wines from all_over France are displayed . The majority of the inventory is kept_in a temperature-controlled cellar , but the entire inventory is displayed in an inventive wooden rack , which runs_around the room ' s perimeter . Among good buys are a ' 90 Fonsalette for $ 19.90 , a crisp Sancerre for $ 10.50 and the venerable La Vielle Ferme red from Provence , $ 7 . Pascal Epicerie and Wine , 1000 Bristol St. , Newport Beach . ( 714 ) 261-9041 . Open Monday through Saturday , 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Closed Sunday . * What a feast is Al Tayebat , an Anaheim market whose name means &quot; wonderful tastes &quot; in Arabic . Calling this colorful , boisterous market &quot; stocked &quot; would be a case of classic understatement . Walking in , you get a full dose of the sights , sounds and smells of the Middle_East . The perfumes of coffee , coriander and olives hit you first , then the Arabic music . It ' s dizzying for a first-time visitor , but the women , many in shawls with_children in tow , don ' t appear the least bit fazed . They are too busy packing up their carts with the bountiful foods of their region . One side of the market contains row after row of rainbow-colored produce , peppers , eggplant , fresh herbs , tomatoes bursting with ripeness . In the rear , there is a counter for halal meat ( butchered according to Islamic law ) where the market ' s butchers prepare homemade sausages called ma ' ani and the cracked bulgur_wheat and ground lamb dish known as kibbeh . Proprietor Sami Khouraki is proud_of the wide variety of dry goods necessary for the preparation of a good Middle Eastern meal . There are large burlap_bags of fragrant basmati rice , bulgur and semolina wheats , and fresh spices such_as cumin , allspice and cardamom , vital to the home cooks who shop here . Gallon cans of_imported olive_oil are stacked nearly to the ceiling , exotic sounding brand names such_as Middle_East , Indo-European and Al Wazir . There are long , flat loaves of fresh Afghani bread , the sesame confection halwa ( halava in English ) , dried apricots imported from Turkey , honeys , pistachios , even a wide selection of European candies and specialty items . &quot; My customers are a sophisticated lot from all_over the Middle_East , &quot; Khouraki says , &quot; and they are used to products from Europe as well as from their own countries. &quot; Should you find the prospect of confronting so many unfamiliar foodstuffs daunting , head for the cookware and cookbook aisle in this store . Al Tayebat sells several Lebanese and Middle Eastern cookbooks , as well as the various cooking implements a fledgling Middle Eastern cook needs to get started . Al Tayebat , 1217 S . Brookhurst St. , Anaheim . ( 714 ) 520-4723 . Open Monday through Saturday , 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Closed Sunday . * From the robust tastes of the Middle_East we go_to the delicate , almost ethereal flavors of Japan . Ebisu Market is part of a family_business started 10 years ago by Kazuto Takeda . The market has expanded into a bakery , ramen ( Japanese noodles , eaten_in soup ) shop and soon-to-be-opened Japanese spaghetti parlor . The heart and soul of any Japanese market is the fish counter ; because many Japanese people fancy raw fish , the quality of the fish sold has to be near perfect . Ebisu ' s fish counter features a wood slat board written in the Japanese syllabary called hiragana , just as you will see in a Little Tokyo sushi_bar . But not to worry , the_English names are right there , in small print next to the fish themselves . The fine selection includes gorgeous chunks of yellowtail , whole pompano , flounder and assorted exotica . It ' s as impressive as you ' ll find anywhere in the county . The market is further notable for fine produce such_as gobo ( burdock root ) ; small , flavorful Japanese eggplant ; pumpkin ; Japanese sugar potatoes ; various seaweeds ; dried and pickled roots ; mushrooms and everything necessary to make a good Japanese dashi , the soup stock that most Japanese dishes depend_on . Of course there is plenty of Japanese rice , and the rice cookers that you ' ll need to prepare it properly . Takeda ' s son Joe has a special line of tuna jerky made especially for him . You ' ll also find a huge inventory of sakes ; Japanese beers such_as my favorite , Ichiban Shibori from Kirin ; teas , such_as the caffeine-free hojicha and the ubiquitous green_tea ; a whole aisle of the rice crackers called senbei , and various other Japanese products , ranging from bento box lunches to ceramic chopstick rests . Should you get uncontrollably hungry during all this , there is , surprise , a take-out sushi counter , back of the market . Ebisu Market , 18930-40 Brookhurst St. , Fountain Valley . ( 714 ) 962-2108 . Open Monday through Saturday , 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. ; Sunday , 10 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. * Sydney and Mario Silvi opened Al Dente 11 years back , more out of necessity than ambition . When it comes_to the staples of Italian cooking , this crowded but elegant Los Alamitos market has nearly all bases covered . You ' ll gasp , as I did , when you see just how complete a market it is . The starting point has to be the pasta section , where pastas in undreamed_of size , shape and color reside . The Silvis use five different companies to get the largest variety of cuts , anything from al carciofo -- artichoke in the dough -- to patrician air-dried pastas in brown paper sacks that are two to three times more expensive than the cellophane-packaged versions . Go_to the market ' s huge , glassed-in deli counter for salumeria ( cold cuts and sausages ) and cheeses . Al Dente sells more_than 15 different types of salamis ( purveyed locally or in Canada ) , prosciutto from San Daniele in Italy ' s Friuli province ( which aficionados consider the world ' s finest ) , and the best imported Parmigiano for livening_up that pasta . There are chefs in the rear kitchen who make lasagnas , stuffed shells and sauces for your pasta , tonno ( tuna ) , pesto , Bolognese , Arrabbiata and more sold at $ 4.95 for a half pint . The condiment section contains flavored vinegars ; a wondrous selection of nut oils ; specialty items such_as Agrumata , olive_oil perfumed with orange_rind and tomatoes in ways you didn ' t know existed ; pickled garlic ; fancy mustards , you name it . Naturally there are breads , in this case brought_in from a Sun Valley bakery called Pane Pane that Mrs . Silvi swears is the best around . The breads , by the way , have zero fat , dairy_products or sugar . The back_room is the most crowded part of the market , with wines , candies , aprons , place_mats , coffees . There is a great selection of top-drawer Chiantis , Brunellos and Barolos , as well as modest wines at one-fifth the price of the big hitters . Italians are big on their candies , and the inventory peaks around Easter . Look_for chocolates such_as hazelnut-filled Baci ( kisses ) from Perugia , the coated nougat called torrone , Amaretti cookies , biscotti for dipping in coffee . Coffee ? No problem . Al Dente sells coffees from Illy , Pasquini and other well-known coffee_makers , not to mention espresso pots and complicated looking gadgets fitted with milk steamers . Mmmm , mmm . Make_sure your trunk is empty before you head out . Al Dente , 11092 Los Alamitos Blvd. , Los Alamitos . ( 310 ) 698-1124 . Open Tuesday through Saturday , 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. ; Sunday , noon to 4 p.m. Closed Monday . * The cooking of Mexico has long been popular here , and the advent of large chains such_as Viva and Tianguis , often featuring comals ( griddles ) that churn_out fresh tortillas like an assembly_line , make shopping for Mexican foods easier than ever . I still prefer the small , neighborhood markets for this kind of shopping , places such_as El Toro in Santa Ana . El Toro has wonderful cuts_of_meats -- marinated steak , oxtail , pig ' s knuckles , honeycomb_tripe , chorizo -- and a homey feeling that I find comforting . Where else would you find pinatas suspended from the ceiling , hear mariachis blaring from oversized speakers , and be able to munch on cajetas de leche ( milk fudge ) or calabasas ( candied pumpkin ) as you shop ? Mexicans tend to buy their grains and legumes in bulk , and most of the beans , rices and corn products sit in huge rear bins , waiting for shoppers to scoop them up into plastic bags . I counted nearly a dozen types of fresh chilies -- among others , chipotles , poblanos , anchos and guajillos -- in here , and at least two_dozen more varieties dried and packaged in four-ounce plastic bags . Of course there is handsome produce such_as avocados , jicamas , papayas and a wide selection of leafy_vegetables . Perhaps it would be more convenient , even less expensive , to shop in the big bright Mexican supermarket chains . But I don ' t care . The whole point of shopping ethnic , for me , is to absorb a little of the true essence of a culture . that ' s what makes an experience such_as this worthwhile and what makes the food on the table taste special . El Toro , 1340 W . 1st St. , Santa Ana . ( 714 ) 836-1393 . Open daily , 7 a.m. to 10 p.m .</TEXT>
