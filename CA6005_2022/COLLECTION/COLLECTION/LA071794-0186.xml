   <HEADLINE> A PIPELINE TO THE FACTS ; DON ' T BASE DECISION ON PROPOSED LINE ON FLAWED DATA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Burbank City_Council has put_off a vote on a resolution to oppose an oil_pipeline that would run from Santa Barbara and Ventura counties to Los Angeles area refineries . The decision to delay a vote will allow talks between Burbank Fire_Chief Mike Davis and representatives of Pacific Pipelines Inc. , which has proposed the line . The city of Los Angeles already has passed a resolution opposing the project , and the city of Glendale is considering a similar action . The final_decision will be made by the state Public_Utilities Commission . We are not here to pass judgment on whether this pipeline should be built , nor on whether this particular route is better or worse than any other . We are concerned , however , at the statements that have been made by various local officials . To whit : the concerns expressed over a possible repeat of the earthquake-related break of an old pipeline that resulted in a fire that destroyed three homes and 17 vehicles in Mission Hills . And there were the comments of Fire_Chief Davis , who said : &quot; If the crude_oil was transported by ship or ground tanker , the danger would not be so high. &quot; First , the pipeline that ruptured during the Northridge quake was one of the state ' s oldest , built_in 1925 using acetylene welds that are antiquated by today ' s standards . Modern pipelines are built to much tougher specifications and include flexible segments to better withstand ground movements . Secondly , the idea that deep water tankers or ground transportation are safer is absurd in the extreme . Tankers are to be considered the carriers of last_resort whenever people have good reason to suspect the slightest chance of oil washing_up on their beaches . Moreover , the tremendous volume of our region ' s crude_oil needs suggests that the number of trucks needed would place an inordinate burden on our already clogged roads and freeways . The decision on whether to build this pipeline is months away , but it should not be based on fears of dated technology and badly flawed information .</TEXT>
