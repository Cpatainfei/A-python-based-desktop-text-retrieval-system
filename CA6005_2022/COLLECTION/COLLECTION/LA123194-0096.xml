   <HEADLINE> GARDENING ; PETAL PUSHERS SPREAD NEWS TO THE ROSE-COLORED CLASSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pasadena ' s annual parade will be Monday ; the other rose parade will in the days after as gardeners descend on nurseries to buy roses in the bare-root stage . In addition to old favorites , there are almost 50 new selections for 1995 . They include roses in novel colors and with sweet perfumes , easy care ground_covers and shrubs , traditional floribunda and hybrid teas with classic form and long stems for elegant arrangements . Each year , rose aficionados eagerly await the announcement of All-America Rose Selections , roses that have been tested nationwide for two years and evaluated by AARS . There are two winners for 1995 , Brass_Band and Singin ' in the Rain . Both are floribunda roses ; both are in unusual apricot blends . Brass_Band produces ruffled flowers in soft apricot tones with shades of pink and a yellow reverse . Hues of yellow , apricot and orange add_to the novel coloration . The flowers are long-lasting , but the color can fade in hot_weather inland . A plus is this variety is reputed to have excellent disease resistance . The rich color of Singin ' in the Rain varies from amber cream to deep cinnamon and apricot . &quot; The color will capture you , &quot; said Tom Carruth , hybridizer for Weeks Roses . The rose offers continuous bloom , good disease resistance and nice foliage . If you like orange roses , and , judging by the increasing number coming_on the market , many people do , Weeks Roses offers several to light_up a drab garden . Oranges n ' Lemons is a shrub rose with gaudy bright yellow stripes on striking orange flowers . It ' s very disease resistant , with bronze-red foliage . &quot; This is a rose people either love or hate , &quot; Carruth commented . He notes that it needs time in a garden to develop . &quot; It ' s a stingy bloomer the first year , but once established will flower freely. &quot; Blast Off is another bush with striking colors . The scarlet red / orange clustered flowers have a white reverse . The floribunda rose produces many clusters of small flowers that last up_to seven days on the bush , even in heat . As the flowers age , they fade to white , creating novel coloration as new flowers form . * Easy-care rose plants are popular in Europe , and their importation to America is accelerating as more and more gardeners demand landscape roses -- lots of flowers on bushes that are very disease resistant and don ' t need much care . Among the easy-care varieties are those in the Town and Country Series offered by Young ' s American Roses . The group of eight shrubs or miniature roses in_colors ranges from pink , white and apricot to red . Two are ground-cover roses , with almost continuous bloom year-round . Carruth recommends Cliffs of Dover , a white ground_cover in the series , especially for slopes or trailing over retaining walls . &quot; It ' s a fascinating little rose with tremendous flower_power , &quot; he said . &quot; Single white flowers are produced in clusters all year ; it ' s never out of bloom. &quot; Look_for more ground_cover roses in 1995 , with Jeepers Creepers and Snow Shower offered by Jackson &amp; Perkins , and Flower Carpet making its debut in late summer . A single bush of each will cover 10 square_feet , and all flower freely to produce an eye-catching landscape effect of masses of color . * If you still long for fragrant roses to admire in vases indoors , you ' ll find several new varieties in ' 95 . Heaven is the Jackson &amp; Perkins 1995 Rose of the Year . The long white buds , edged_in pink , open_to five-inch blooms with a light tea fragrance . Keith Zary , hybridizer for J &amp; P , recommends Heaven especially for inland areas of Orange County , because it can be prone to mildew , especially along the coast . Lynn Anderson , a robustly growing hybrid tea rose , produces cream blossoms edged_in pink . Flowers and color excel in cooler weather , so this is rose will be better along the coast . It is a very tall grower , so expect long-stemmed roses for a formal bouquet . The rose was developed by Joe Winchell , an amateur hybridizer , and is being marketed through Weeks Roses . * Other noteworthy new roses are : Camille -- old-fashioned flowers with quartered centers , light pink and strong fragrance . Shrub grows to five feet . Fortune Teller -- deep purple hybrid tea with a strong lemon fragrance . Gypsy Dancer -- a shrub-like floribunda rose that produces clusters of &quot; hand-painted &quot; flowers of yellow splashed with red . Good disease resistance . Spreading growth to four feet . Love Potion -- dark lavender floribunda with strong fragrance . Ruffled flowers on a productive floribunda shrub that grows to three feet in a rounded habit . Moderate disease resistance , can get some mildew . Magic_Lantern -- a color sport of the yellow grandiflora , Gold Medal , this rose is a tall grower like its parent . Produces long-stemmed flowers in cognac-like copper-gold hues . Good disease resistance . Taboo -- classic hybrid tea form on a very tall growing bush . Very deep_red , velvety flowers that can burn in intense heat . Slight fragrance , good disease resistance . Queen Margrethe -- old-fashioned pastel pink floribunda rose that produces quartered flowers in great abundance . Small , rounded growing habit . Bright green leaves are completely disease free . Apple fragrance . * The AARS winners are available at nurseries and garden centers throughout Orange County , as are the Weeks Roses and many J &amp; P roses .
