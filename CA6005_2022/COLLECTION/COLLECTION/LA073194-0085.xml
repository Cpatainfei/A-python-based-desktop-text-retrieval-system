   <TEXT> Robert Levine ' s article &quot; Coming Attractions Come On-Line &quot; ( Film_Clips , July 10 ) , about video clips from movies being available via computer_network &quot; for the first time , starting two weeks ago , &quot; must have come as a big surprise to Paramount , TriStar , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and other studios . They ' ve made such programs available to subscribers of CompuServe since last year . ShowBiz Forum on CompuServe was the first to introduce these clips produced by Hollywood Online and has presented interactive_multimedia programs from films such_as &quot; The Age of Innocence , &quot; &quot; Addams Family Values &quot; and others . Our current features among more_than a dozen films include &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; &quot; Speed , &quot; &quot; Blown Away &quot; and even cult TV_shows such_as &quot; Dr. Who. &quot; For all_of these , there are video segments , sound clips and interactive electronic magazines that include production notes , cast bios , still photos and story information . If Levine tires of listening to hyenas on his computer , he ' s welcome to visit ShowBiz Forum on CompuServe to get Tom Hanks saying , &quot; My name is Forrest Gump . People call me Forrest Gump. &quot; Or even Dennis Miller giving his hysterical &quot; Happy Fellow &quot; routine from his HBO talk_show .
