   <HEADLINE> JUDGE BARS ETHICS CHIEF FROM CASE ; COURTS : JURIST RULES THAT COMMISSION DIRECTOR SHOWED A BIAS AGAINST THE SUBJECTS OF A MONEY-LAUNDERING INQUIRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a setback for one of a series of local campaign money-laundering investigations , a Superior_Court judge on Friday barred Los Angeles Ethics Commission Executive_Director Ben Bycel from participating in a pending case , saying he had shown a bias toward the subjects of the probe . Judge Diane Wayne , ruling_in a lawsuit filed by three people involved in the investigation , found that in a related money-laundering probe Bycel had made &quot; abusive and threatening &quot; comments to attorneys and sought to dissuade a witness from testifying on behalf one of those under investigation . &quot; Such conduct clearly represents actual bias and irrefutably suggests that Mr. Bycel is not an impartial adjudicator in the_matter herein , &quot; the judge ' s order said . Bycel , who declined to comment , has denied the accusations in court papers . Ethics Commission President Dennis Curtis , a USC law professor , said the judge &quot; was wrong on the law. &quot; He defended Bycel as the &quot; right person for the job , &quot; and &quot; a natural target for anybody who wishes to downgrade the ( commission ' s ) efforts. &quot; Commission Deputy Director Rebecca Avila said the decision is disappointing . She added that the agency &quot; will continue to press forward with these important political corruption investigations. &quot; Assistant City Atty . Tony Alperin said city officials have not decided whether to file an appeal . Specifically , the ruling precludes Bycel from presiding over a pending internal hearing involving three parties , including two relatives of former Los Angeles Councilman Arthur Snyder . The investigation is part of a series of Southern California money-laundering investigations being conducted jointly by the Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission . Several inquiries have involved relatives and associates of Snyder , now a prominent City_Hall lobbyist and political fund-raiser , although the former Eastside councilman has not been accused of any campaign violations and denies any wrongdoing . The investigations have produced the largest penalty on record for campaign law violations , an $ 895 # 000 payment by a shipping firm that was managed locally by Snyder ' s brother-in-law . Friday ' s ruling involved a lawsuit brought by Snyder ' s sister-in-law Blanche Wu , her husband , Ricky Poon , and an associate , Dominic Ching . Court papers show that they are &quot; subjects of an enforcement proceeding &quot; by the Ethics Commission . Their attorney , Mark Geragos , who also represents Snyder , has said Wu , Poon and Ching have violated no laws . Geragos characterized Wayne ' s decision as a victory . &quot; This substantiates what we ' ve said all along . This investigation was driven by a personal vendetta by Ben Bycel . We have judicial confirmation now of what we ' ve alleged all along . &quot; I think it completely stops them in their tracks , &quot; Geragos said of the investigations , including any that might involve Snyder . But Alperin , the Ethics Commission attorney , said : &quot; We don ' t think it does that. &quot; The ruling applies only to the Wu , Poon and Ching cases , he said , and the ethics agency has three types of enforcement remedies available -- criminal prosecution , filing a civil lawsuit to seek penalties or proceeding administratively . &quot; This ruling only deals with the administrative penalty procedures , &quot; Alperin said . Wu , Poon and Ching alleged that Bycel had said to an attorney in a related case that he was &quot; going_to get &quot; her clients . Also , USC professor and campaign finance expert Herb Alexander alleged in a court declaration that Bycel had telephoned him &quot; very agitated &quot; because Alexander planned to testify as an expert witness in that case . Alexander said Bycel told him he &quot; should not testify , &quot; became angry and hung_up . In his affidavit , Bycel said statements attributed to him were not true . He said he merely inquired of Alexander , a professional associate of several years , whether he would be testifying as an expert witness . He also denied hanging_up on Alexander , saying his car telephone &quot; blacked_out &quot; as it often does and &quot; I saw no reason to redial his number. &quot;</TEXT>
