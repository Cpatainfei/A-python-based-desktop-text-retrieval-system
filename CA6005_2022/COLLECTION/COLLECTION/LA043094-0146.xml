   <HEADLINE> CHRISTOPHER , RABIN RENEW EFFORTS FOR PEACE WITH SYRIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A day after a long-awaited breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts , the United States and Israel on Friday announced a new push for peace on a second front with Syria . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher will leave Israel today for a meeting with President Hafez Assad and other senior Syrian officials in Damascus . Christopher will present a set of ideas outlined by Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin at daylong talks here . &quot; The completion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement to be signed_on Wednesday ( by Israel and the Palestinians ) will be only one step , but an important step , to facilitate the progress in the other negotiations that are necessary to achieve a comprehensive peace , &quot; Christopher said at a news_conference with Rabin . &quot; We now need to make progress on the Syrian track. &quot; With the latest step , Israel has clearly emerged as the engine behind the broader Mideast peace process . First in secret talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization last year , and now , in a public effort with Syria , Rabin government initiatives have injected a sense of urgency -- and brought results -- to a process launched almost three years ago in Madrid . But brokering peace with Syria could prove to be as complicated and potentially more difficult than the deal with the Palestinians . &quot; We ' ve got a lot of hard work ahead of us , &quot; Christopher said at the news_conference . A senior U.S. official later added : &quot; We ' re not on the brink of a breakthrough . There are a lot of tough decisions that will have to be made by both sides . This is a process where you work to build base lines , determine what the options are , and then narrow the universe of what the possible solutions are. &quot; Christopher and Rabin refused to disclose details of the Israeli proposal . Rabin said only that the ideas included &quot; a comprehensive overview , including the substance of peace , the principle of withdrawal ( from the Golan Heights ) . . . the stages and a reference_to their implementation by each side , and also demands of the American side. &quot; Israeli media reported this week that Rabin wants a phased withdrawal to culminate in a &quot; full &quot; peace , including open borders , trade and an exchange of ambassadors with Syria . One newspaper reported the government is also seeking a U.S.-led force of 3 # 000 troops in a buffer zone between the two longtime rivals . U.S. officials denied that Israel had made a specific request but acknowledged that the two sides had explored the issues of peacetime security at length . In their talks , Rabin also told Christopher that Syria had to undertake measures proving to the Israeli public that Damascus wanted peace , according to Rabin spokesman Obed Ben-Ami . &quot; It is hard to face somebody who says he wants peace but will not talk to you , that is , ( refuses ) substantive , serious talk , &quot; Rabin was quoted as telling Christopher . Indeed , on the eve of Christopher ' s arrival , Syria pledged Friday not to succumb to any outside influence intended to win concessions on the pivotal issue of the Golan Heights . Damascus has demanded the return of the strategic plateau occupied by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War . &quot; What is being rumored about the possibility that Syria may be affected by pressure and seduction to accept compromises is untrue , &quot; wrote Al Baath , the newspaper of Assad ' s ruling Baath Arab Socialist_Party . &quot; Syria ' s firm stand has not deviated from the basis of the peace process. &quot; Yet Syria is also showing unprecedented interest in pursuing peace with its formal archrival , U.S. officials said . In recent weeks , Damascus has quietly taken steps indicating that it is willing to back its rhetoric on peace with action in Lebanon . For more_than a decade , Lebanon has been a troublesome border for Israel . The tumult is often blamed on Syria as more_than 30 # 000 Syrian troops effectively control large areas of eastern and southern Lebanon . But in hopeful signs for peace : * Syria has arrested more_than two_dozen members of the notorious Abu Nidal extremist organization in Lebanon , as well as closing some of its facilities in Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley , U.S. officials said . * Syria has cracked_down on Hezbollah operatives linked to extremist actions against Israel . The pro-Iranian Party of God has been one of the most persistent problems for Israel along its border with Lebanon . * Assad ' s security_forces arrested diplomats accused of murdering an Iraqi dissident in Beirut two weeks ago . * And Damascus has not intervened in the arrest of a key Syrian ally in Lebanon , right-wing Christian leader Samir Geagea , who has been tied to the bombing of a Maronite church last month . In several of these cases , extremists arrested by Syria were turned_over to Lebanese authorities -- leading Israel to complain that the latest moves are inadequate steps to prove new intent and commitment . But Christopher said he believes that Syria will listen . &quot; I expect the conversations there to be as serious and substantive as the conversations here , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
