   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; ' LAYERED ' : PURPOSEFULLY DESPERATELY SILLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new show at the Santa Monica Museum of Art is called &quot; The Layered Look : Towards an Aesthetic of Accumulation Among Six Los Angeles Artists. &quot; In addition to being too long , that title sounds a little odd for an art_exhibition . It evokes the world of fashion and the shameless self-aggrandizement that surrounds it . Potential viewers may rest assured the handle is ironic to_the_point of hostility . This exhibition is about desperation . The French call it de sespoir , which literally means &quot; without hope. &quot; Naturally such a state of despair requires a light_touch to give it the proper aura of pathos . First you must select flimsy materials that bespeak the crumbly and fleeting nature of all humanity ' s attempts to perpetuate itself beyond its mortal compass . Doug Hammett gets right down to it by making architectural moldings out of cake frosting . These works , generically titled &quot; Finger Licks , &quot; evoke classic architecture from Greek temples to Mayan pyramids . It ' s a bit of a wonder that Hammett would pick on some of the rare human structures that actually endured . It ' s as if he wants to make_fun of himself making_fun of the human impulse to immortality . It ' s a double-take that minimizes the work ' s overt Dadaist cynicism and makes_it kind of cute . The cute syndrome is endemic to this show . Larry Mantello ' s two large installations are entirely fashioned of cultural cute . The largest is called &quot; Continental Enter Chain &quot; and has an automated Santa as its centerpiece . The Santa is surrounded by a myriad of cheap plastic objects , balloons and Japanese lanterns shaped like everything from leprechauns to bunnies , globes of the planet and a fire_hydrant labeled &quot; Top Dog Award. &quot; A tape loop of Asian pop_music lends the piece a decidedly multicultural flavor . Its celebratory facade recalls the innocent delight on the faces of toddlers having their first Christmas . Its innards evoke an adult understanding of the monstrous consumerism , greed and infantile hysteria embedded in all this schlock . The whole is looped with a yellow plastic tape repeating , &quot; Caution , caution , caution. &quot; Like most of the others , Mantello gets wedged between an impulse to criticize society and a weakness for its vulgar energy and seductive sentimentality . All this work admits to a hopeless inability to set priorities . Some of it derives a certain rigor from regressing into autistic compulsion like a kid whose games become his reality . Chris Finley collects all manner of objects common to suburban life from plastic containers to bottle-tops . &quot; Seven Circles Are Removable , Please Reset When Finished &quot; is an intricate wall relief in the form of a cross . Its combination of dusky blue and salmon_pink objects make_it look_like a huge , infant ' s toy . Movable parts reveal progressively more intricate stashes inside . It ' s the secret universe of a 3-year-old . Pauline Stella Sanchez shows paintings from a series called &quot; bubbles , bubbles , bubbles and bubbles that POP. &quot; The dreamy-kid title designates paintings built_up of pigment in circular layers topped with a coat of fluorescent yellow . They are like serious theoretical abstract paintings made in the nursery . Joyce Lightbody ' s world is_on the scale of a postage_stamp . She uses them and other equally minuscule snippets to make small encrusted collages that manage to reach back to the poetics of Paul Klee and Joseph Cornell . They have lovely titles like &quot; Potato Moon &quot; and &quot; 40 Years of Booty. &quot; Constance Mallinson comes at her problems from an adult perspective , but they are no less discouraging . Her &quot; Las Meninas Mound &quot; consists_of 100 figurative paintings done over the past year . Their subjects tend to be those available to a wife and mother -- kids , meat from the supermarket , folks and friends . Canvases vary vertiginously in character as if done_by several artists of divergent talent . They are piled in such fashion as_to suggest imminent incineration . Their quality of hopelessness is chilling . The show is part of the LAX / 94 festival . Santa Monica Museum of Art_director Thomas Rhoads did a first-rate job of making his point . It bears_on matters that have affected art for a long_time now . Aspects of Jon Borofsky and Mike Kelley hover here . All of it feels_like the gutted end of the once-liberating enlistment of popular culture to invigorate the fine_arts . Now it feels_like the pathetic dance of a precious child whose voice has changed . All of this has happened before . The century bracketing the_French Revolution produced curious haunted sentimentalist painters like the Le Nain brothers and artists like Antoine Watteau whose sense of the poignant made silliness into poetry . There were heartfelt genre artists like Chardin and kinky moralist scolds like J.B. Greuze . What ' s happening today enlists sympathy while suggesting there are severe limits on art whose main purpose is to make you feel sorry_for it . If it needs a category we can call it Rococo Pop . * Santa Monica Museum of Art , 2437 Main St. , through Jan . 15 , closed Monday and Tuesday , ( 310 ) 399-0433 .</TEXT>
