   <HEADLINE> AMES ' DAMAGE MAGNIFIED IN CIA INQUIRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The CIA inspector_general ' s investigation of confessed spy Aldrich H . Ames has found that the veteran counterintelligence officer exposed 55 clandestine U.S. and allied operations over nine years , far more damage than previously admitted , according to sources familiar_with a draft of the inspector_general ' s findings . The 400-page classified document , prepared under the direction of Inspector_General Frederick P . Hitz , attempts to explain what happened as a result of Ames ' duplicity and how the longtime officer was able to avoid detection while supplying highly_sensitive information to Moscow , including the identities of more_than 34 secret U.S. and allied agents , these sources said . The inspector_general ' s report puts the blame initially on the &quot; almost complete indifference of senior CIA supervisors &quot; who , beginning in 1986 , failed to recognize the importance of their losses and did not put &quot; adequate resources &quot; into the internal search for a Soviet mole . The report , however , focuses solely on the CIA ' s loss of agents and the Ames case , sources said , and does not take into consideration CIA performance in other worldwide operations being run_by these same officials , including covert wars in Afghanistan , Angola , Cambodia and Nicaragua . This broad criticism of the highest ranks of the intelligence agency comes at a time when the future of the CIA is uncertain . It is racked by internal turmoil caused by budget_cuts , uncertainty about its post-Cold War mission and allegations of racial and sexual discrimination . A senior CIA official said Friday that the inspector_general ' s report on Ames represents &quot; the end-game &quot; in an unprecedented agency scandal that has &quot; shaken this organization badly. &quot; The 55 clandestine_operations exposed by Ames , according to the report , is about double the number that the CIA previously has publicly admitted . Knowledgeable sources said that the inspector_general ' s report could lead to the reprimanding , early retirement , or even dismissal of a number of important agency officials .</TEXT>
