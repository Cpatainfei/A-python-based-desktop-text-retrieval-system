   <HEADLINE> HAITI REFUGEE COUNT DROPS TO ZERO ; CARIBBEAN : OFFICIALS REPORT NO SEA RESCUES DURING LAST THREE DAYS . REVERSAL OF U.S. POLICY CREDITED FOR SHARP DECLINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The surge of Haitian refugees -- which once threatened to swamp the U.S. immigration system and figured as a key element in justifying a U.S. invasion -- has dropped to insignificance , at least for now . There were no reports over the weekend of U.S. vessels rescuing Haitians fleeing their homeland by sea , said U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager , who noted : &quot; The number on Saturday was zero . The number on Sunday was zero. &quot; And officials in Washington said no Haitians were rescued Monday -- a stunning change since the first week of July , when 12 # 345 Haitians were picked_up by U.S. Coast Guard vessels ; more_than 3 # 300 Haitian refugees were intercepted on July 4 alone . The earlier flight evidently was driven by the then-applicable Clinton_Administration policy , under which any Haitians picked_up at_sea were to receive quick processing on requests for refugee status . As such they enjoyed a better chance of being allowed to enter the United States . This stance was a sharp reversal from the previous policy , under which almost every refugee found at_sea was returned to Haiti . But the new immigration directive apparently helped push thousands of Haitians to take_to rickety craft in a desperate , largely futile search for a better life in America or other international aid . The situation rapidly became a crisis , especially after exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide refused to urge his countrymen to stay home , leading some Americans to engage in shrill talk_about a stepped-up schedule for a U.S. military intervention here , in part to stem the immigration problem . President Clinton had listed the Haitian refugee problem as one of the crucial U.S. interests that could justify armed intervention . Some diplomats in Port-au-Prince suggested that Aristide exploited Clinton ' s statement to pressure the United States to act more strongly against the military_leaders who ousted him in September , 1991 . Cautious against the possibility that the immigration crisis could resume , Shrager said in an interview Monday that the reason for its stark pause might be attributable in part to high_seas and even the Haitian preoccupation with soccer ' s World Cup . But he also insisted that the major factor appears to be that &quot; the message seems to be getting_out -- if you take a boat ( out of Haiti ) , you won ' t get_to the United States. &quot; The President , in Miami to promote his health_care reform proposal , pointedly did not address the Haitian crisis , even though South Florida , which already has the nation ' s largest Haitian population , is preoccupied with the prospect of more Haitians fleeing there from their country , the Hemisphere ' s poorest . Critics have assailed the President for what they term his meandering policy on Haiti and Haitian refugees . After suggesting that Haitian refugees would get speedy processing for possible U.S. immigration , the Administration declared July 8 that the United States would no longer accept them , but would instead send the fleeing Haitians to havens in other countries until their nation ' s political crisis was resolved or they returned home . On Monday , about 451 Haitian refugees opted for repatriation rather than stay_at the only existing haven for them : the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . Shrager said that an average of 30 % to 40 % of the 14 # 000 or so Haitians stopped by the Coast Guard this month are asking to return to Haiti rather than live_in a tent city . This shows , he said , that &quot; most ( Haitian refugees ) want to go_to the United States &quot; and are not necessarily only seeking to escape political oppression and human_rights violations at_home . The decline in refugees has been aided in part by radio_broadcasts and other institutional communications advertising America ' s tougher new policy . But most experts think the major reduction can be attributed to the Haitians ' internal oral and personal network . &quot; When the ( refugees ) themselves realized what was happening and started coming_back , they told their townsmen that no one was getting_to the States , &quot; said one U.S. official , &quot; and that did it. &quot; Times staff writers Norman Kempster in Washington and Paul Richter in Miami contributed to this report .</TEXT>
