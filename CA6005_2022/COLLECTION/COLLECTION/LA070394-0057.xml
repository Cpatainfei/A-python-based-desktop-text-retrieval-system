   <TEXT> I know I ' ll be blasted as &quot; politically correct &quot; and a &quot; reverse racist , &quot; but I ' m sorry to see &quot; Death and the Maiden &quot; being brought_to the screen with a non-Latino cast . This is especially troubling because Chilean author Ariel Dorfman ' s play is specifically set_in Latin_America and draws upon that region ' s recent history . I ' m sure the film ' s proponents will defend the casting as &quot; color-blind , &quot; but if Sigourney Weaver were a recognizable Latina , would she have won her breakthrough role in &quot; Alien &quot; ? More_than likely , she would be struggling with all_the other underemployed Latino actors to play stereotypical bit_parts as drug dealers and domestic_help . After all , Rita Cansino had to change her name to Hayworth before she could become a movie_star . Granted , Hollywood should be commended for fostering the careers of Raul Julia , Edward James Olmos and Andy Garcia . And I ' m glad that the &quot; Death and the Maiden &quot; film is giving a non-white actor like Ben Kingsley another chance to play a role outside his Indian ethnicity . However , the movie_industry could still be doing much more to employ the rich but neglected Latino talent all around us . I could mention that &quot; Like Water for Chocolate &quot; reveled in its Latino origins and was a record-breaking hit , while &quot; The House of the Spirits &quot; whitewashed its Latin_American heritage and died at the box_office . But I ' m sure the film_industry would still find a way to rationalize its preferential treatment of white actors . ROBERT PAYNE Studio City</TEXT>
