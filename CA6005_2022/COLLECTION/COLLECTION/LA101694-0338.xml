   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; CALIFORNIA ' S PROFUSION OF PRISONS ; IN THE PAST DECADE , 16 HIGH-TECH FACILITIES HAVE BEEN ADDED AT COSTS FAR ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE . ' THREE STRIKES ' WILL FURTHER FUEL A GROWTH_INDUSTRY THAT OPERATES WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With minimal outside oversight , California has spawned a multibillion-dollar prison construction_industry that extends from Wall_Street money managers to hard_hats who build the bastilles of concrete , steel and razor wire . The industry is expected to grow on an even grander scale as tens of thousands of felons are sentenced to prison under the state ' s new &quot; three strikes &quot; law . &quot; We call it our Pentagon around here , &quot; said Sen . Robert Presley ( D-Riverside ) , who has sponsored many prison construction bills . &quot; We say that because it costs so_much . It ' s like the military. &quot; During the past decade , the Department of Corrections , carrying_out the tough-on-crime policies of the past two governors , has added 40 # 524 prison_cells and dormitory beds by building 16 prisons and renovating old ones . The department has spent $ 5 billion on planning , engineering and construction of new prisons , and created a bond debt that will double that amount to $ 10 billion with interest payments . That money has bought the nation ' s biggest , most expensive prisons . Each houses 4 # 000 inmates and costs $ 200 million or more to build . Each has 8 1 / 2 miles of razor wire , an arsenal of 337 guns , and a $ 2-million computerized alarm_system . With high-tech security , a guard can scan a console in a control booth and unlock 200 cell doors by pushing a button . Prisons also have amenities such_as $ 550 milkshake makers for staff and $ 850 electric pottery wheels for inmates . While the defense industry shrinks in California , officials and contractors who design and build prisons are readying themselves for a new and more costly boom necessitated by the &quot; three strikes &quot; law signed by Gov . Pete Wilson in March . On Nov . 8 , the electorate will vote on an initiative duplicating the legislation . Under &quot; three strikes , &quot; terms for many second-time felons will double . Many three-time losers will be sentenced to 25 years to life . Time_off for good behavior will be slashed . As a result , state corrections officials estimate that the population behind bars will surpass 230 # 000 by the turn_of_the_century -- about 100 # 000 more_than today ' s total -- and 25 new prisons will be needed , including one for women . That would give California 58 prisons , plus several minimum security work_camps . &quot; If the Legislature can fund them , we can build them , &quot; said Craig Brown , undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency , in_charge of the prison system . &quot; We have been at it a long_time . We ' re damned good at it. &quot; Brown knows that it ' s a big if . This summer , the Legislature turned_down Wilson ' s request to place on the November ballot a $ 2-billion prison construction bond for six prisons as a first installment on &quot; three strikes. &quot; To examine the current prison construction program and trace its roots , The Times reviewed thousands of pages of documents and interviewed dozens of officials , contractors and critics . Records show that the Corrections Department consistently has put_up prisons in four years , from the time planning begins until the cell doors lock . And the prisons generally have been built within budget , with overruns averaging 10 % . But The Times also found : * California ' s prison construction budget is the biggest in the nation , partly because the state builds prisons almost exclusively to house the highest risk inmates , rather than erect lower security institutions , such_as work_camps . &quot; We can shave costs today , and we ' ll pay_for it later -- either in staff costs immediately , or in maintenance , &quot; Brown said . * Legislators , auditors and budget analysts acknowledge that they have provided limited oversight of the construction program . &quot; Basically , the Administration is able to do whatever it wants , &quot; said Gerald Beavers of the legislative analyst ' s office , which no longer has the staff to scrutinize prison construction . &quot; There are no controls. &quot; The Legislature ' s Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations once had four staff_members , but now has one part-time aide . The committee has met only once this year . The chairman , Presley , is leaving_office to run_for the State Board of Equalization . Although he believes the construction program is efficient , Presley fears that with the boom coming , no one will take_over his role . &quot; They need oversight , something that big , &quot; he said . Corrections Department Director James Gomez insists that his actions are watched closely . Although legislators often call him to testify on policy issues , he could not recall when he last testified about construction . &quot; Every time we have a freeway mile , do we have a hearing ? &quot; Gomez asked . &quot; We had a tremendous number of hearings in the 1980s . Now there is a comfort level among the members of the Legislature that we are doing a good job. &quot; * The new prisons have had numerous construction or equipment-related problems . Kitchen floors have had to be torn out and replaced . Sophisticated alarm_systems have needed replacement . All 2 # 200 cells doors in one prison were replaced for $ 8 million because inmates could kick them open . Officials say such problems are to be expected in such a large undertaking . * Long after prison construction is finished , the costs keep rising as the state pays_off the debt . California ' s $ 5 billion prisons debt is paid down annually from the state ' s $ 38-billion general fund . In 1982 , when California embarked_on the prison building program , the state paid $ 218 million in debt service on bonds used for all state projects , from university construction to purchase of state park land . Now , the state pays almost twice that sum each year to repay principal and interest on prison bonds alone . * The construction program is heavy with administrative costs , critics say . The Corrections Department ' s planning and construction division has grown from two in 1983 to a staff of 216 with an annual budget of $ 17 million . The main consultant is Kitchell Capital_Expenditures Management , which since 1982 has been paid $ 73 million to manage the construction program . State_prison officials insist that the staff is lean . But federal prison officials say they are using a planning and construction staff of only 120 to oversee the design and construction of two_dozen federal prisons . High-security federal prisons cost $ 28 # 000 per cell less than the $ 113 # 000 per cell that California spends , according to the private Criminal Justice Institute . William Patrick , head of the federal prison building program , said California ' s &quot; high-priced construction management &quot; is one reason the state_prisons are pricey . &quot; We could not afford the level of management that the state of California has , both in-house and outside , &quot; he said . * Prisons officials who have run the construction program have been courted by lobbyists . Prison contractors regularly take corrections officials to lunches and dinners , officials declare in annual conflict-of-interest statements . Kyle McKinsey , a top corrections official , reported taking a complimentary $ 500 steelhead fishing derby ticket . Glenn Smedley , a Del Norte County supervisor , said he helped arrange the trip , which was paid_for by a local business as a &quot; goodwill &quot; gesture because of McKinsey ' s work_on Pelican Bay_State Prison . * A revolving door swung between prison contractors and state corrections officials during the George Deukmejian Administration . Rodney Blonien -- who was in_charge of prison building as Deukmejian ' s undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency -- is now a prominent lobbyist . In 1987 , he went_to work for a New York-based law_firm , which helped arrange financing for two prisons while Blonien was undersecretary . Blonien later put_on a $ 6 # 000 golf party for his friends in the Deukmejian Administration . In the Wilson years , he has represented prison contractors , cities that have or want prisons , and landowners who sold land on which a prison sits . In an interview , Blonien said : &quot; Corrections is an area of specialized expertise that most people don ' t have . The fact that I supervised that area for three years and did_well at it established a certain amount of credibility. &quot; Two other top corrections officials went_to work for prison contractors . One took a post managing Kitchell ' s West Coast operations , and since has returned to the department . Gomez said he warns contractors not to raid his staff . * Although individual prison contractors are not major campaign donors , politicians who support prison construction receive money from one of the biggest beneficiaries -- the California Correctional Peace_Officers Assn . As the prison system has expanded , the guards union has grown by roughly 10 % a year . The union has become a major source of campaign money . It gave more_than $ 900 # 000 to Wilson in his run_for governor in 1990 , and $ 75 # 000 so far this year . After Assemblyman John Vasconcellos ( D-Santa Clara ) signed a ballot argument against new prison construction and questioned pay_for prison officers , the union spent $ 90 # 000 in 1992 attempting to unseat him . This year , the union is the second-largest donor to the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative , giving $ 101 # 000 . Union President Don Novey said his organization donates money &quot; to change the system &quot; so career criminals are locked_up for life , not to increase the number of guards . &quot; There are scumbags out there , &quot; Novey said . &quot; Three strikes &quot; is the latest of roughly 1 # 100 changes to the Penal Code made during the past 15 years lengthening prison_terms . In that period the state_prison population has grown from fewer than 30 # 000 inmates to more_than 126 # 000 , the majority serving time for drug and property crimes . &quot; The result is an exploding Department of Corrections budget and prison construction program that divert resources from other valuable , needed state programs , &quot; the Little Hoover Commission concluded in a report this year . In the middle 1970s , there were 12 prisons , and many of the old and overcrowded institutions such_as San Quentin , Soledad and Folsom were targets of civil_rights lawsuits . In June , 1982 , voters approved a $ 495-million bond issue to remodel old prisons and build new ones . The next year , Deukmejian took_over as governor and set_out to follow_through on campaign promises to make streets safe by locking_up criminals . At his urging , lawmakers began passing bills to speed prison construction . Perhaps the most important one gave the Legislature authority to approve bond sales without voter consent . Voters have approved general obligation bonds to build prisons five times since 1982 for a total of $ 2.4 billion . However , since 1984 lawmakers also have sold a different type of bond , called a lease revenue_bond , without voter consent to construct prisons at an ultimate cost of $ 5.6 billion to taxpayers . California ' s use of bond financing has made Wall_Street a key part of the prison industry . Investments houses , bond attorneys and other consultants have received more_than $ 35 million from the sale of lease revenue_bonds . Prison construction also is a boon for architectural firms and builders . &quot; Not many people are building high-rise buildings and hotels anymore , &quot; said Dave Grubb , president of Swinerton &amp; Walberg , a construction firm in San Francisco that routinely bids on prison jobs . Contractors hungry for work submit bids that often are below the estimated cost , making them marginally profitable and lowering the cost to the state . &quot; The Department of Corrections is a very difficult client , &quot; said a small contractor . &quot; We would not be working for them if we didn ' t have to . They recognize they ' re the only game in town , and they use it to their advantage. &quot; Nationwide , prison construction is a $ 5-billion-a-year business . It is a niche that has attracted large builders , including many that have done major projects for the Pentagon . &quot; It has allowed us to have a reasonably steady flow of work , &quot; said Jim Thomas , regional head of CRSS Constructors Inc. , which has been construction manager at four California prisons . Thomas ' company is part of the Assn . of California Construction Managers , a consortium of firms represented by Blonien . CRSS has given $ 17 # 000 to California campaigns since 1987 . &quot; Have we contributed a little money to campaigns ? Yes , &quot; Thomas said . &quot; Is it to get work ? No. &quot; * With few exceptions , every cellblock , kitchen and exercise yard in every new prison looks_like the next . Prison officials call it a cookie-cutter design . The dough needed for construction is considerable . State-by-state comparisons are difficult because of accounting differences . But a survey by the private Criminal Justice Institute in New York shows that although the national average for a high-security prison_cell is $ 80 # 000 , California spends $ 113 # 000 per cell . The survey also found that California builds its minimum-security cells for almost $ 60 # 000 each , twice the national average . California ' s heavy use of high-tech equipment , concrete and steel contribute to the higher costs , according to Patrick , head of the federal construction program . &quot; They have a lot of specialty detention stuff -- locks , grills , electronics , &quot; he said . Although California has the nation ' s most expensive construction program , Texas claims title for building the most cells . In the next year and a half , Texas will construct 80 # 000 prison beds . The cost : $ 1.5 billion . By contrast , Wilson this year called_for six new prisons with about 28 # 000 beds . The cost : $ 2 billion . G . Kevin Carruth , head of the California Corrections Department ' s planning and construction division , said the Texas estimates seem low , and he cited reasons for steeper costs here : Labor rates are 35 % higher ; California has costly earthquake and environmental codes , and this state taxes construction material and equipment . California spends extra on design work to reduce the need for staffing , Carruth said . In new prisons , a single housing unit , populated by 200 felons , has no more_than three officers , including one who is armed and located in a control booth , and two on the floor . &quot; When you look_at construction costs , you have to look_for quality , durability , and for security and minimal staffing . Sometimes those things cost you money , &quot; Carruth said . While Texas cuts costs by building more low-security housing and making far heavier use of inmate labor , California provides comforts not found there . For example , California has cafeterias for employees . At Calipatria and Centinela prisons in Imperial County , air-conditioning systems were installed for $ 11 million . Other new prisons have swamp coolers for cellblocks . Some comforts are partly attributable to the influence of California ' s prison_guards union , which deploys an officer to the department ' s planning and construction division . &quot; If it wasn ' t air conditioned , the thing would n ' t last 60 days , &quot; Novey said of the Imperial County prisons , suggesting that more officers would transfer out and inmates might riot . Others amenities , such_as the apartments maintained at each prison for conjugal visits , are a valuable way of controlling inmates through the reward system , officials said . Lawmakers often call_on the Corrections Department to cut costs . Assemblyman Ross Johnson ( R-Fullerton ) has urged that the state build Spartan barracks , patrolled by armed guards with directions to shoot escapees . But Carruth called the barracks idea simplistic , and said the state tries to hold_down costs in other ways . One money-saving idea is lethal electric fences , designed to prevent escapes and to reduce the need for guards . When the department pitched the concept , officials said 40 prisons and camps could be equipped for $ 10 million , resulting in annual savings of $ 47 million . But after the governor and Legislature signed_off , the department concluded that fences should be installed at only 19 prisons . Yet the cost has risen to $ 18 million -- and the estimated savings dropped to $ 26 million . Even with the fences , the department is building air-conditioned guard towers at a cost of $ 1.2 million per prison , although the towers will not normally be staffed . &quot; Electrified fences are a big experiment , &quot; Brown said . &quot; We think it ' s going_to work . But it may_not work , and more importantly , they have scheduled maintenance . They are going_to be shut_down periodically. &quot; The fences may end_up costing more . They do not distinguish between escapees and wildlife . Birds , including some protected burrowing owls , have been electrocuted at Calipatria prison . After hiring ornithologists and other consultants to study the problem , the Corrections Department is considering installing anti-perching devices at a cost of $ 150 # 000 per prison . * The budget_for maintaining and improving the current stock of prisons runs about $ 55 million annually , including repairs_to new prisons . One that has had repeated problems is R . J . Donovan , which opened near San Diego in 1987 . Guards encountered so many problems with electronic panels -- which control vital functions such_as opening and locking cell doors -- that officials are considering replacing them at a cost of more_than $ 500 # 000 . &quot; Several electrical fires have occurred in these control_panels , sending dangerous fumes and smoke into the confined area of a manned control booth , &quot; a recent memo said . Carruth said the department tried to save money during Donovan ' s construction , and is paying_for the &quot; savings &quot; now in high repair bills . But records show that other new prisons , including some that opened later than Donovan , also have had problems : Underground piping has corroded at Corcoran , Avenal , New Folsom and the new prison at Vacaville . Repair cost : $ 45 # 000 per site . At Corcoran State_Prison , control consoles failed , leaving whole housing units &quot; entirely electronically disabled &quot; for several days in 1991 and 1992 . Repair cost : $ 113 # 000 . Corcoran also had problems with low technology . Tower guards discovered that windows would jam , and tended to crash shut . There were 29 reported injuries , and the union filed a grievance . Replacement_cost : $ 72 # 000 . At Avenal , utility poles are sinking , tilting and collapsing beneath the weight of phone cables , threatening the entire communications_system . Repair cost : $ 1.6 million . At Chuckwalla State_Prison near Blythe , desert sand made its way into natural_gas valves , jamming them and causing failure of 20 gas-fired pieces of equipment , such_as stoves , in one year . In 1992 , gas leaked into a cellblock , resulting in a small explosion and an evacuation . Repair cost : $ 722 # 942 . California prisons employ high-tech gadgetry . And when such systems fail , the costs are high . Each officer has a personal alarm , which can be triggered in an emergency , alerting a central command center . The $ 2-million system also includes fire_alarms and various other sensors . At the prisons in Delano and Wasco in the Central Valley , and one in Imperial County , alarms have experienced &quot; numerous malfunctions , rendering the systems substantially unreliable and unstable , &quot; according to the state . The matter has degenerated into litigation with the contractor , Shorrock Electronics of Maryland . The department claims that the entire system must be replaced and has hired a Utah firm to do the work_at a cost of more_than $ 3.5 million . Shorrock counters that the system was properly installed and that any problems can be repaired . The department ' s most embarrassing construction mishap occurred at $ 240-million Pelican Bay_State Prison just south of the Oregon border -- California ' s highest-security prison . When Pelican Bay was being designed , corrections officials agreed to use a different type of locking device , a pneumatic design , rather than electrically operated doors . After the prison opened in 1989 , guards found that inmates could kick the doors open , jam them and knock them off their tracks . Corrections officials hired a new contractor to install an entirely new electronically operated system for the 2 # 226 doors . The project cost : $ 6.6 million , plus $ 1.9 million in design . The department is seeking more_than $ 8 million from the firms that originally installed the doors , Blount Inc. and J . A . Jones . The contractors insist that any defects could have been fixed easily . &quot; The doors did not need to be replaced . They could have been repaired , &quot; said Richard Sipos , attorney for J . A . Jones . &quot; We gave them what they wanted , and they were dissatisfied with it. &quot; About This Series Prison building already has become a multibillion-dollar industry in California , and with the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , an even bigger boom is forecast for coming decades . The Times visited prisons from the Imperial Valley to the North Coast , and reviewed thousands of pages of public records to examine the state ' s prison construction program , life inside the penitentiaries and issues that already are severely straining the penal system . Today : How tough-on-crime legislation has created a Pentagon-like bureaucracy and generated unprecedented prison construction that has touched all corners of the state . Monday : A journey through the California prisons system , where the flow of inmates has far outsripped construction of 16 facilities since 1984 . Tuesday : With the state planning up_to 25 more prisons by the turn_of_the_century , many communities weigh the potential impacts on jobs , housing , public_services and property values . Wednesday : The cost of keeping the ever-expanding prison system running is being driven ever higher by the influx of inmates , inflated salaries and health_care costs .</TEXT>
