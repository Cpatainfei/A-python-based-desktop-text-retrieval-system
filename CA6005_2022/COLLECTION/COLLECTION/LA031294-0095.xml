   <HEADLINE> CHEMICAL ARMS WHISTLE-BLOWER CLEARED ; RUSSIA : THE MOSCOW GOVERNMENT SHEDS AN IRRITANT TO U.S. RELATIONS . THE SCIENTIST HINTS AT A POSSIBLE SUIT FOR DAMAGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a victory for free speech in Russia , charges against a scientist who blew the whistle on a top-secret chemical weapons program have been dropped , the prosecutor general ' s office announced Friday . By closing the case against Vil S . Mirzayanov , charged with disclosing state secrets after writing a 1992 newspaper_article about a highly potent new nerve toxin , President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s government has removed an irritant to its relationship with the United States , which had protested the chemist ' s prosecution . Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev said last week that Yeltsin was eager to see an end to the Mirzayanov case , which had also drawn criticism from international human_rights groups and raised questions about the sincerity of Russia ' s commitment to chemical disarmament . In dropping the case , the prosecutor has shown that &quot; the time has come_in this country when such dangerous activities as development and manufacture of chemical weapons can be countered by legal means , &quot; Mirzayanov said . The chemist hinted that he might sue the individuals and groups that initiated the case against him for damages incurred in 18 months of &quot; illegal persecution , &quot; under a rarely used section of Soviet-era law . Mirzayanov , a quiet and mild-mannered ethnic Tatar , has become a symbol for those who claim that democratic reform has yet to penetrate the old Soviet military-industrial complex , which has a very different political agenda than Yeltsin ' s . He asserted that Russia and other countries have secret programs to devise new types of chemical weapons that would not be covered by existing international agreements . &quot; As long as work continues on new kinds of toxic substances , I will continue fighting whether I am arrested again or not , &quot; Mirzayanov said . Both Mirzayanov , who was fired from his job at a Moscow chemical weapons laboratory after the Moscow News_article was published , and his co-author , environmental chemist Lev Fyodorov , warn that Russia has not begun to address the dangerous environmental consequences of the secret Soviet chemical weapons development program . Fyodorov , at a news_conference Friday , said that about 5 million people have been exposed to poisons as a result of testing , leakage or improper dumping of Soviet chemical weapons . &quot; About 300 areas on half of Russia ' s territory have been polluted by toxins with long-lasting contaminating effects , &quot; Fyodorov said . Further , Fyodorov alleges in an article published Friday in the Obshchaya newspaper that Gen . Anatoly Kuntsevich , the head of the Soviet chemical weapons program , was less than candid in 1987 when he presented as complete the chemical arsenal shown to international observers at the Shykhany testing ground in the Ural Mountains region . In fact , the super-toxic V-gas that Mirzayanov ' s lab helped develop was loaded into aviation bombs and strategic missiles but was not on the list sent to Geneva for the Conference on Chemical Disarmament , Fyodorov wrote . An article published a week earlier in the same newspaper alleges that Russia will be able to keep the new generation binary chemical weapon that Mirzayanov ' s lab worked_on , despite having signed the Paris Convention last year . That treaty , a broad ban on designing , producing , stockpiling and using chemical weapons , has been signed by 154 countries but has not yet been ratified and will not likely take_effect until 1995 . &quot; The little trick was that the components of the binary gas and the gas itself were not included in the list of banned substances , &quot; the Obshchaya article asserts . &quot; Hence , Russia possesses the weaponry without violating the convention. &quot; The Russian committee appointed by Yeltsin in 1992 to oversee the disposal of chemical weapons by 2005 , as required by the treaty , is headed by Gen . Kuntsevich , the article noted . The committee announced that Russia has 40 # 000 tons of toxic substances in_stock , the article said . But it said independent experts , who were unnamed , put the tonnage at up_to 10 times more_than official estimates . But at a news_conference last month , U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas R . Pickering , while expressing dismay over the Mirzayanov prosecution , said he remains confident that international groups have the capability to monitor the Russian chemical weapons disarmament program to ensure compliance .</TEXT>
