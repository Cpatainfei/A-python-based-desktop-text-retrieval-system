   <TEXT> Clipboard in_hand , real_estate_agent Brett Howard moved slowly through a five-bedroom house in Mission Hills that had been emptied_of everything except a wedding portrait , a pair of ragged sneakers and a_few wine glasses . It was easy to see why the two brothers who lived_in the house packed up and fled to Arizona shortly after the Northridge earthquake . Cracks ran_along many of the walls . The ceilings had lumps from water damage . The block wall was a pile of rubble in the back yard . &quot; They probably owe too_much on it , so they probably just walked away , &quot; said Howard , who was inspecting the property for the lender . Four months after the Jan . 17 earthquake , many such abandoned houses are appearing , adding_to a pile of foreclosures in the San Fernando Valley . The earthquake is a major setback to a Valley market already plagued by a record number of recession-related foreclosures -- 20 times more last year than in 1990 -- and falling prices . Real_estate professionals fear prices will plunge further as lenders hold fire_sales to get foreclosed properties off their books or homeowners are pressured into selling damaged properties at deep discounts to avoid defaults . &quot; The pipeline of foreclosures is beginning to fill_up again , &quot; said Ron Prechtl , a real_estate_agent at Century 21 Lamb Realtors in Northridge . He said lenders about to foreclose on quake-damaged properties are flooding him with requests for opinions on likely sales prices . Most lenders gave homeowners with quake damage a three-month break on mortgage payments , but that moratorium has expired , and banks are starting to serve default notices . Since foreclosure proceedings typically take four months , a slew of earthquake-damaged properties may hit the market in late summer . A major worry is the impact on prices , which are already down to 1988 levels -- in part because during the recession , lenders sold so many foreclosed properties at discounts . The average resale price of an existing single-family home_in the Valley for the first four months of this year was $ 230 # 000 , down 11 % from the same period last year and down from a peak of $ 296 # 675 in 1990 . Prices in the Valley keep falling even though sales are up . Dale Fay , owner of Century 21 Oak_Tree in Valley Village , said her 20 sales agents sold 15 houses in April , a_few more_than a year earlier . But eight of them were foreclosures , Fay says , and the average price of those 15 houses was down about $ 100 # 000 from April , 1990 . &quot; What ' s going_to happen when we see another glut of foreclosures ? &quot; she asked . To avoid foreclosures , some homeowners are selling quake-damaged homes &quot; as is &quot; at big discounts . Across the street from the abandoned house in Mission Hills , for example , sits a quake-damaged three-bedroom , two-bath house that the owners sold for $ 125 # 000 rather than default . The house was listed in November for $ 154 # 000 , said the house ' s new owner , Los Angeles city employee Lance Brown . &quot; I know I got a good_deal , &quot; he said , adding that he ' s already fixed most of the damage himself . But reducing prices won ' t help many homeowners with large mortgages , a big quake repair bill , no insurance and little equity . Seong Ho Kim , whose uninsured Newhall home was cracked in half by the quake , says he ' s told his lender to take_back the house . Kim has a $ 250 # 000 mortgage on the property , and contractors have said it will cost at least $ 150 # 000 to repair it . &quot; As far as I ' m concerned , the bank will take_care of it , &quot; he said . Banks and other mortgage lenders don ' t want to add_to their stockpile of foreclosed properties , which are expensive to maintain and difficult to dispose_of without taking a big loss . Chatsworth-based Great Western Bank , the nation ' s second-largest savings and loan , says that if it has to take_back all 250 homes on which homeowners have asked_for temporary deferments because of major quake damage , it will lose $ 32 million . &quot; We have no idea how many will be foreclosure cases , &quot; spokeswoman Linda Mueller said . Many lenders say they are trying to work with homeowners , for the good of both the institution and the borrowers whose credit records are damaged by defaults . After the earthquake , brokers say , more financial_institutions have been willing to strike unusual deals with quake victims , such_as &quot; short payoffs , &quot; in which a lender agrees to accept less than full repayment on a mortgage if the property is sold . However , lenders are generally not extending the three-month payment moratorium , and they and lawyers trying to help clients avoid defaults are not optimistic that many foreclosures will be avoided . &quot; There will be more foreclosures on the horizon , &quot; said Leonard L . Schapira , a Hermosa Beach lawyer who represents many Valley homeowners struggling with quake repair bills and renegotiation of their mortgages . Valley Foreclosures A record number of houses were foreclosed on in the Valley last year , and bank repossessions continue to climb because of the recession .
