   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA : DEBACLE WILL COST EVERY CITY , TOWN IN THE NATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Behind Orange County ' s unprecedented bankruptcy filing lies a pattern of sheer , loopy amateurism and intellectual dishonesty . With little of the oversight or controls that are common to corporate finance or the management of any mutual_fund , Orange County ' s treasurer managed to turn $ 7.5 billion in public tax_revenues -- put_in his care to earn short-term interest -- into bankruptcy on a fund totaling almost $ 20 billion . The filing under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code is tactical , intended to shield the county ' s fund from redemptions and lawsuits by some of its 187 investors , which include cities , school districts and transport and sanitation agencies in the county . But it ' s a tactic that will have long-term consequences for every city , town and school district in the United States . Simply put , they will have to pay more to borrow money from now on . &quot; This turns the world of municipal finance upside-down , &quot; says the head of a Los Angeles municipal_bond firm . &quot; It changes the view of investors toward municipal debt . If issuers can consider bankruptcy as an alternative , then it raises the level of risk for all. &quot; How did proud Orange County come_to this ? It ' s yet another case of &quot; We have met the enemy , and he is us. &quot; Right now , the county faces a threat of $ 1.5 billion in losses in a fund of only $ 7.5 billion of public money . But that public tax money was leveraged almost threefold by $ 12 billion in borrowings designed to enhance the returns on investment -- the more you invest , the more you can earn , or lose . And what was the public purpose of those borrowings ? It was to give county agencies , cities and school and water districts a little extra in their budgets . That way , government officials and county residents could get_around the realities of life in a time of stern voter resistance to taxes and vocal protests about the size of government . Orange County is not alone . Across the United States , municipalities have been piling on debt for years even as Americans have crowed about shrinking government . State and local_government borrowings rose to $ 289 billion last year from $ 154 billion in 1991 , according to the Federal_Reserve_System , although rising interest_rates have cut the number of bond issues this year . Total municipal debt outstanding has risen to $ 1.22 trillion from $ 365 billion in 1980 . &quot; Orange County is only unique in the amount of leverage , &quot; says Joe Mysak , editor of Grant ' s Municipal_Bond Observer , a biweekly newsletter . Municipalities in other states , from Florida to Wyoming , have come_to grief in complex investments involving interest_rate swaps and other financial derivatives . But Orange County is unique as the largest political entity ever to declare bankruptcy -- New York in 1975 never got_to bankruptcy , and a judge turned_down the 1991 filing by Bridgeport , Conn . Blame it on the incredible amateurishness with which County Treasurer Robert L . Citron was allowed to manage the vast portfolio of tax_revenues . Even as the fund declares bankruptcy , public finance officers in California and elsewhere have many unanswered questions . &quot; Who authorized Bob Citron to borrow that much ? &quot; asks a public finance expert . &quot; Was it the supervisors ? &quot; Citron ran a peculiar operation , trading billions in bonds himself , says a bond dealer who knows him . Citron ' s basic investment approach was not complicated . He reasoned that longer-term investments paid higher interest than short-term ones , so he used interest_rate swaps and other financial techniques to &quot; lengthen the portfolio ' s duration , &quot; explains Robert Haugen , a professor of finance at UC Irvine . Orange County ' s fund investments attained an average maturity of 2 1 / 2 years and thus earned higher interest . And that return was then enhanced by using borrowed money to increase total investment . The fatal flaw in Citron ' s approach didn ' t really show_up until this year , as interest_rates rose . Values of bonds and notes in Orange County ' s fund fell , as did those of most bond funds . But unlike mutual and pension_funds and prudent corporate treasurers , Citron was not required to revalue his investments daily to reflect market conditions . Citron ' s reports to the county ' s five-member Board of Supervisors , in contrast , were chatty reviews of the economy . In this year ' s report , he included an observation that &quot; governmental accounting standards do not require municipal investment pools to periodically adjust the cost of their portfolios to reflect current market. &quot; So the supervisors apparently were not aware of the extent of the fund ' s problems . And oversight by the debt-rating agencies , Standard &amp; Poor ' s and Moody ' s , proved a joke . Consistently , their reviews of Orange County debt focused on the area ' s underlying economic strength and praised the high returns Citron ' s fund was making -- without questioning how he was making them . Such lax regulation is about to change . &quot; There will be much more scrutiny of municipal debt , &quot; says the head of a bond firm . The role of Wall_Street houses in Orange County ' s failure will receive attention in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and in congressional hearings and lawsuits in the months ahead . Merrill Lynch loaned Orange County $ 2.5 billion and then supplied the investment vehicles in which Citron put the money . The whole_thing , in short , looks less like a professionally managed investment fund than a political slush_fund . And in truth , that is partly what it was , not in the traditional sense of graft , but in the contemporary sense of office holders under pressure from rising costs and angry voters trying to get a little leeway . Who will pay_for the mistakes ? The people of Orange County will pay , either with more cash to support their stricken communities and school districts or in reduced services . And every_other county , town and city will pay too , because amateurism and intellectual dishonesty have just raised the level of risk for all . * More James Flanigan * For a collection of recent columns by James Flanigan , sign_on to the TimesLink on-line service and &quot; jump &quot; to keyword &quot; James Flanigan. &quot; Details on_Times electronic services , B4</TEXT>
