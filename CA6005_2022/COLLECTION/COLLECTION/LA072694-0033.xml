   <TEXT> The normally quiet streets of London ' s Knightsbridge district have been shattered recently by the ear-splitting roar of jackhammers chewing_out trenches . Said one resident , in a remark not intended as a compliment : &quot; This sounds like Manhattan. &quot; The workmen are laying fiber-optic communication cables on every street in the neighborhood , and the same scene is taking_place in other British cities as cable companies seek to stitch up possible customers . For TV cable operators , Britain presents a heady atmosphere , filled with possibilities for making money in a wide spectrum of activities spurred by the government ' s momentous decision to open_up its communications industry to few-holds-barred competition . Britain represents the future in telecommunications , and it ' s a textbook example for other countries . When it privatized the national phone_company in 1984 , it set the pace for other countries where state-owned communication monopolies are giving_way to private telephone and television firms . For instance , the_British government this month gave approval to AT &amp; T , America ' s Ma Bell , to offer public telephone_service to homes and businesses throughout the United Kingdom . Developments like this were not imagined a_few decades ago . * Worldwide , telecommunication has traditionally been a highly regulated industry . In most countries , in fact , a government_agency acts_as both a service supplier and the regulator . But the privatization of British Telecommunications , or BT , and the government ' s order that it rent a share of its phone_lines to outside operators turned tradition upside down . The picture seemed clear to the_British government , then under the rule of Prime_Minister Margaret Thatcher . Most national phone monopolies were extremely inefficient , and in some cases were used as patronage tools and padded with workers loyal to the government . At the same time , new technology was creating interesting communication products and services with great appeal_to customers , particularly corporations . Corporate customers wanted satellite phone networks , private_lines and low-cost long-distance service , but these services were not available through the stodgy telecom monopolies . In the United States and later Japan , the monopoly phone_system was broken_up . In Britain , when telecommunication was privatized , competition was specifically authorized . Most European_nations still lag behind Britain , resisting efforts to privatize or otherwise crack their national phone monopolies . But the 12-member European Union is scheduled to allow telephone competition by 1998 . The Morgan Stanley investment_firm has estimated that about 30 telephone_companies around the globe will be privatized in the next two or three years . Chile , Argentina , Mexico and Malaysia are among those that have already acted ; not far behind are Germany , the_Netherlands , Italy , Hong Kong , Singapore and Thailand . In Britain alone , the S . G . Warburg investment_firm predicts , multimedia operations , including cable , will take an increasing share of the leisure and entertainment market from broadcast TV , printed media , computer_games and video rentals . After Thatcher ' s government privatized BT , a government watchdog agency , the Office of Telecommunications ( OFTEL ) , was set_up to oversee and encourage the competitive process as BT went private . BT had , over the decades , built_up a complex network of underground phone_lines and above-ground micro-relay and satellite systems for transmitting electronic_communications . * The first competing company to move onto the scene was Mercury , a subsidiary of the worldwide British communications behemoth Cable and Wireless , and it has become BT ' s main competitor . Mercury created its own network lines , concentrating in high-volume city business_districts , but it was also allowed to rent lines from BT . The rental fees have led to a series of confrontations between BT and Mercury -- with OFTEL reluctantly in the middle . Mercury protests that BT is charging too_much for the use of the BT network in payments known as &quot; access deficit contributions , &quot; which Mercury officials dub a &quot; tax on competition. &quot; Mercury chief_executive Mike Harris says : &quot; BT has a protected 85 % share of the total market . When competitors step over the 15 % line to serve more customers , they pay millions of dollars to compensate the U.K. ' s biggest corporation -- which made about $ 4.5 billion profit last year. &quot; Mercury and all competitors &quot; recognize that paying a fair price to BT for use of its network is proper -- although many of us have issue with the way this is presently calculated , &quot; Harris said . But Don Cruickshank , director general of OFTEL and the government ' s telecom regulator , condemned some Mercury statements as &quot; unnecessary and shrill &quot; and said he regrets that Mercury has taken OFTEL to court . &quot; We mustn ' t allow these issues to be determined in the courts -- a recipe for confusion , &quot; Cruickshank says . He insists that in the United States , where various courts have ruled on telecom issues , &quot; no one -- regulators or industry -- knows what is or isn ' t allowed , and that is clearly hampering innovation and investment . &quot; They look with some envy at the way in which our framework is right and is not hampered by litigation. &quot; Meanwhile , cable companies have also moved_into Britain in a big way , most of them American- or Canadian-owned , laying_down lines in principal cities and offering customers a variety of multimedia services . There are currently about 130 cable companies operating around Britain , each with a government-granted franchise to operate exclusively in their particular geographical_area . One of the liveliest is US West -- a partner in 24 cable TV franchises in Britain with the potential to serve about 3.3 million homes and more_than 500 # 000 businesses . Cable TV franchises in Britain also carry a license to provide telephone and data services -- along with cable TV . US West and its partners are the largest operators of cable TV and telephone_services in Britain , with more_than 230 # 000 cable subscribers . &quot; We plan to provide interactive , multimedia services , &quot; says Catherine May , an official of US West in London . &quot; That means video movies on demand , shopping where you control what you order and interactive TV games . &quot; We also have phone_service with lower rentals than BT and with monthly billing rather than quarterly . Our idea is making life easier for you , while saving you money. &quot; It was the_British climate of deregulation and enhanced competition that brought US West here , says May , adding , &quot; the government encourages competition , there ' s a stable economy , and the_British like innovation and different products . that ' s why we emphasize multimedia , a variety of services and interactivity -- people making choices at their own end of the line. &quot; * Another enthusiast is Richard Woollam , director general of the Cable_Television Assn. , who points_out that the 130 separate cable companies now operating in Britain are owned by 17 corporations , including such U.S. names as NYNEX , Southwestern Bell and Videotrain . &quot; The fiber-optic cable can carry the equivalent of 25 # 000 telephone_lines , &quot; he says . &quot; It carries a universe of information . The question is do you want that information superhighway running_into your home -- or just an access_road ? You don ' t need 1 # 000 TV channels , but you might want access to them. &quot; In Britain , Woollam says , cable is now licensed to cover 15 million homes . &quot; We added 1.5 million homes this year , &quot; he says , &quot; and we ' ll add another 2 million next year. &quot; But of the 3.65 million households in Britain served by a cable_system , only 780 # 000 householders so far subscribe . Woollam says that eventually cable telephone_service will give the subscriber the cheapest possible rate for any call -- with a computer selecting the best route to send a call . Further , small but energetic mobile phone network companies , such_as Orange , a subsidiary of Hutchison Telecom , have sprung_up offering customers wire-free phone_services of high_quality . The competition has meant that BT , once viewed_as complacent and arrogant , will have to become more customer-friendly in competing against the small but up-and-coming cable telephone_systems . The telecom giant , which still controls 85 % of the market , says &quot; cheaper calls and better value for money for all customers are the key themes &quot; for various price_cuts BT announced this year . * In the past year , BT claims to have made phone_call price_reductions worth about $ 750 million , including cheaper calls to North_America . As for the Continent , European Union Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said recently : &quot; Nobody can doubt the influence that telecommunications has_on all our lives . Competition policy has a seminal role to play in our vision of the future. &quot; And in the strange new_world of telecom competition , observers say , what is happening electronically under the streets and in the skies of Britain today may well shape the future of telecommunications everywhere .
