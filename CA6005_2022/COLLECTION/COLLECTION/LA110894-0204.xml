   <HEADLINE> CHRIS FOSTER : THEIR ACTS COULD USE SOME SOAP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Take a memo . To : Newport -- Mesa Unified School District officials . From : A casual observer . Subject : Dirty laundry . Ugly situation you folks got_over there . One high_school football_coach angry , another angrier . Still another tossing in his two cents at inflationary rates -- and he ' s not even involved in the situation . So , what ' s that again about molding young_men ' s minds and building character ? Seems Myron Miller , your coach at Costa Mesa , got somewhat chatty with a reporter prior to the Estancia game . Just a_few pregame thoughts , little ditties like , &quot; we ' ll win 100-0 if we get the chance. &quot; And , &quot; We ' re also playing to recruit kids in our district ; they shop around. &quot; Oh , and , &quot; . . . so if we get a chance to score in the last minute , we ' ll score. &quot; The winner of the Nobel Prize for sportsmanship is . . . Well , the Mustangs scored with four seconds left to cap a 55-12 thrashing a couple Fridays ago . Now there was talk_about the Eagles having it coming . Some on the Costa Mesa side grumbled about Estancia ' s &quot; people &quot; tattling on Miller for having a couple players living at his house . The district did receive a telephone_call from a private_investigator regarding the &quot; case. &quot; Miller does have two players in residence . The Southern Section is aware of the non-athletic reasons and OK ' d it . But instead of being satisfied with an innocent verdict and a good-deed halo , Miller hauled out the incident as a motivational tool . Guess he was saving that turn-the-other-cheek lesson for another day . Seems John Liebengood , your coach at Estancia , didn ' t take too kindly to all that . A couple days after the rout , he fired back : &quot; I would n ' t do that to anyone , as a head coach , a person or a friend . . . &quot; And , &quot; Maybe I was taught differently , but I couldn ' t do those things. &quot; Maybe , but make_sure your house isn ' t made by Waterford before chucking anything . Liebengood didn ' t have a problem trotting_out his first-team defense to prevent La Quinta from scoring with one second left earlier this season . Estancia was leading , 31-0 , at the time . Liebengood said afterward that his defensive coordinator wanted the shutout . Oh , well , as long as he went_home happy . Seems a blindside came from Mark Schuster , your first-year coach at Corona del Mar . He questioned Miller ' s coaching ethics . Never mind that Costa Mesa hasn ' t played Corona del Mar this season . Doesn ' t Mark have enough worries trying to make the playoffs ? Hard to find a hero , eh ? But the question is , what lessons are planned ? Oh , your district issued a gag order on all_the verbal shenanigans , but is that enough ? Sure , this little tete-a-tete isn ' t ripping Orange County apart . Costa Mesa and Newport Beach haven ' t exactly been torn asunder . And , yeah , these guys hardly reside at rock_bottom . Why just up the road at a Huntington Beach high_school , there are a_couple_of assistant coaches whose antics toward game officials might lead to a rather ugly incident some day . None of this is good for high_school football . Someone has to cry , enough . It can ' t be boys-will-be-boys and business-as-usual . Two points . First : Century League officials certainly sent a get-the-message message recently by suspending Canyon Coach Bob Hughes two games for disrupting a game in_progress . Now that might be a little harsh in this case . But a little discipline seems appropriate . After all , these coaches would assuredly mete_out a bit of it had one of their players popped_off in such fashion . Second : Don ' t forget to pat Newport Harbor ' s Jeff Brinkley on the back . He ' s your district ' s only coach who wasn ' t playing with jacks last week .</TEXT>
