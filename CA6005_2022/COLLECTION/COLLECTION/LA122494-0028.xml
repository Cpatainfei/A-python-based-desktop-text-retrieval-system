   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; MEXICO ' S FINANCIAL UPHEAVAL ; THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEVALUED COIN : TRADE SHOULD BENEFIT ; CURRENCY : MEXICAN EXPORTS ARE LIKELY TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE AND ITS TRADE_DEFICIT SHOULD NARROW SOON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even as Mexico ' s currency plunge has sparked a financial crisis and tarnished the nation ' s image , its long-term effects could yield quite the opposite : Mexico ' s exports are likely to become more competitive , and its global trade_deficit should narrow soon . A cheaper peso &quot; should stimulate Mexican exports to the United States -- no question about it , &quot; said Richard N . Rosencrance , director of UCLA ' s Center for International Relations . In fact , he added , the cheaper peso &quot; is a very positive advantage &quot; for Mexico ' s export efforts worldwide . Indeed , one lesson of recent U.S. history is that a decline in the domestic currency may help narrow the trade_gap . In the mid-1980s , when the United States ' global trade_deficit was a source of financial instability and political embarrassment , the government encouraged the dollar to fall , particularly against the Japanese yen . Although the degree of the fall varied with each foreign currency , U.S. exports took_off and have remained a far more important part of the U.S. economy . Certainly , the peso ' s plunge of some 35 % this week has the potential to shift fundamental trade realities in North_America , economists said Friday . A permanently weaker peso would mean Mexican products can be sold more cheaply to the United States and Canada . Similarly , it could make the products Mexico buys from its North_American neighbors more expensive . But in the space of a week , Mexico has positioned itself to enjoy greater sales to the United States , accelerating a trend that began emerging when the North_American Free_Trade Agreement took_effect in January . &quot; Obviously , Mexico is doing this partly because of ( its worldwide ) trade_deficit , &quot; said Jerry J . Jasinowski , president of the National Assn . of Manufacturers . For companies like Kaydon , an industrial bearings manufacturer in Monterrey , Mexico , that ships most of its products to the United States , the devaluation will be beneficial . The firm is in_essence enjoying a windfall from its U.S. customers , who are now paying 30 % more in pesos per product . &quot; If you sell to the American market , you will have a big increase in revenue , &quot; predicts plant manager Alfredo Sanchez , who now expects to hire 20 more workers this year to meet a growing demand . Obviously , the peso ' s jarring fall -- reflecting global investors ' questions about the stability of Mexico ' s economy -- has had negative effects . Suddenly , the Mexican market poses new uncertainties for American exporters whose prices are rising -- to the consternation of their Mexican customers . Investors from the United States and other countries have lost money on the stock_market and are pulling much-needed capital out of the country . Some U.S. firms are reconsidering their expansion plans . Wal-Mart may delay the opening of new stores in Mexico . James Meinert , director of international marketing for Snider Mold , a Wisconsin toolmaker , recalls the reaction of his Mexican customers to the peso devaluation . &quot; The first thing that happened was the phones started lighting_up , and people wanted to make advance payments on their tooling , &quot; he said . For now , management at the Mequon , Wis. , firm is wary : &quot; I ' m not alarmed , but I ' m watching things real close , &quot; Meinert said . Soaring interest_rates and inflation are also compounding Mexico ' s problems . Mexican companies that use a lot of dollars , common for enterprises near the U.S. border , now must pay a lot more for their greenbacks . To combat inflation , the Mexican government this week imposed along with the devaluation wage-and-price controls that were meant to stabilize the peso on foreign currency markets . If costs continue to shoot_up , though , the devaluation would be for naught , and capital will continue to flow_out of the country , said Tony Ramirez of San Diego-based Made in Mexico , a firm that consults for U.S. manufacturers moving operations to Mexico . U.S.-Mexican trade_in both directions has been rising sharply over the past year , and Mexico is already close to achieving a trade surplus with the United States . ( The United States ran a $ 1.7-billion trade surplus with Mexico for the first 10 months of the year , but the surplus has dwindled of late. ) The troublesome aspect of Mexican trade , apart from that with the United States , is the tens of billions in deficits it is running with other countries , a key source of concern among investors and of pressure on the peso . Reducing that deficit is the first target goal of the peso devaluation . But such a strategy will only work if it is buttressed by real strides in industrial efficiency , said Jasinowski . Referring to the more orderly decline of the dollar in the 1980s , he said , &quot; The U.S. devaluation was for the most part successful because it came_in tandem with real improvements in competitiveness. &quot; Mexico has also moved to boost its industrial efficiency in recent years , but it has often relied_on foreign technology to enhance its uneconomical older facilities . With a weaker peso , equipment purchases -- such_as tooling from Snider Mold -- will now cost more . But the long-term view of Mexico ' s industrial competitiveness remains positive , provided an atmosphere of stability settles over the economy . &quot; The key is for the peso to go_down and stay there in a stable way , &quot; Rosencrance said . &quot; If it does , that will be acceptable financially and economically. &quot; Peterson reported from Los Angeles and Kraul from San Diego .</TEXT>
