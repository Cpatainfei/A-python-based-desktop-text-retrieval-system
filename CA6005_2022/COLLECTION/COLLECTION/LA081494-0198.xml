   <TEXT> Four men have been arrested on suspicion of operating a lucrative car theft ring that shipped automobiles stolen from Orange County beach cities to Europe for_sale , authorities said Saturday . The four suspects , all Romanian nationals , were arrested during a sweep by 60 undercover investigators Friday in Riverside County and charged with 19 felonies , said Lt . Rick Criner , commander of the California Highway Patrol ' s Orange County auto theft task_force . Criner said the arrests culminated more_than five months of investigation of a ring responsible_for the theft of at least 75 cars , most from beach cities in Orange County . The thieves targeted Jeeps , Dodge Caravans and Plymouth Voyagers . &quot; They prefer the larger cars , but they would also hit a_few sports_cars if one caught their fancy , &quot; said Criner , adding that more arrests could be made soon . &quot; This was a huge deal for us . These guys were very , very hard to catch. &quot; Criner estimated the value of the stolen cars at $ 750 # 000 to $ 1.5 million . &quot; They made a lot of money . We ' re not talking peanuts here , &quot; Criner said . Being held at Orange County Jail in lieu of $ 100 # 000 bond each were Cornel George , 30 , of Riverside ; Ion Gheorghe , 35 , of Riverside ; Adrian Gheorghe , 22 , of San Bernardino ; and Latislau Molnar , 18 , of Perris . The felony charges against them include conspiracy to commit vehicle theft ; vehicle theft ; , operation of a vehicle &quot; chop_shop ; &quot; altering , recovering or destroying vehicle identification_numbers and receiving stolen property . Molnar was arrested at a ranch in Perris that investigators allege was being used as a chop_shop , a place where stolen cars are altered and wrecks are stripped for parts and destroyed , Criner said . Authorities also believe that George ' s auto dealership , Import Auto Sales in Riverside , was used as a second chop_shop , Criner said . Criner said ring members would frequent automobile auctions and buy wrecked late-model cars that insurance_companies had deemed too badly damaged to be fixed . But the theft ring members bought the wrecks for their identification_numbers , which were transferred to the stolen cars , Criner said . The stolen cars were then re-registered with new identification_numbers and salvage receipts , packed in containers and shipped by boat to Germany for_sale in Europe , particularly in Romania , Criner said . &quot; The paperwork will say they are salvaged vehicles , but these cars are in pristine condition , &quot; Criner said . Some of the cars were also sold locally to unsuspecting buyers through automobile magazines or newspaper_ads , Criner said . &quot; We recovered a Plymouth Voyager an innocent purchaser had paid $ 13 # 000 for and only had two days , &quot; Criner said . Unfortunately , the purchaser loses the money and the car , he added . &quot; The innocent purchasers get stung real hard , &quot; Criner said . A total of 11 cars were recovered , some of them already packed in their shipping containers , Criner said . Aiding the county ' s task_force in the investigation were the FBI , the state_Department of Motor_Vehicles , the National_Insurance Crime Bureau , the Riverside County Auto Theft Interdiction Detail , the Riverside County Sheriff ' s Department and the CHP ' s Inland Division vehicle theft unit .</TEXT>
