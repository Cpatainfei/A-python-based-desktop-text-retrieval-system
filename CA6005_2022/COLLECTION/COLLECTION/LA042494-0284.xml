   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb infantry advanced defiantly on the strangled eastern city of Gorazde on Saturday in violation of a NATO ultimatum to end their slaughter of civilians or face punishing air strikes . U.N. officials confirmed that the rebels were still attacking more_than 24 hours after the Western alliance vowed to bomb them unless they halted their fire immediately . But the civilian chief of the U.N. peacekeeping mission here vetoed a NATO call_for air_power . Early today , the United Nations said that no immediate NATO air strikes had been ordered because the Serbs were apparently complying with the ultimatum to withdraw from the enclave . But U.N. officials could not confirm full compliance . Artillery shelling of the bedraggled enclave packed with refugees from the 3-week-old offensive was reported to have died_down around a 2:01 a.m. deadline for withdrawal , and a regional official in Gorazde reported by ham radio that there were no more tanks visible in the city_center . The rebels also allowed a U.N. humanitarian aid convoy to enter Gorazde late Saturday night . For most of the day Saturday , the nationalist rebels appeared bent_on pushing the 16-nation North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization to deliver on its threat of air_attacks -- a move that would enmesh Western governments in the deadly Balkan conflict . Bosnian Serb soldiers , backed by heavy artillery , moved deeper into the proclaimed withdrawal zone from the north just before noon in what one U.N. observer in the enclave described as &quot; blatantly increased aggressive activities in the face of the NATO ultimatum. &quot; They concentrated their firepower on an important weapons complex , seizing at least one-third of the vast plant and looting it of munitions . In the 24 hours after NATO ordered the Serbs to retreat , at least 21 people were killed in Gorazde by tank , artillery and machine-gun fire . Even after Serbian forces fired tank rounds into the maternity ward of Gorazde ' s already demolished hospital , killing at least three patients , Yasushi Akashi , the civilian chief of the peacekeeping mission , refrained_from authorizing air strikes . The NATO ultimatum issued Friday demanded that the Serbs stop attacks on Gorazde immediately ; pull_back at least 1.9 miles from the city_center by 2:01 a.m. local_time today ( 5:01 p.m. Saturday PDT ) , and move heavy_weapons outside a 12-mile &quot; exclusion zone &quot; by 2:01 a.m. Wednesday ( 5:01 p.m. PDT Tuesday ) . NATO said that failure to meet these requirements could bring an air_attack . U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali issued a statement when the 2:01 a.m. deadline expired , saying he would &quot; immediately authorize the use of air strikes to protect the safe area of Gorazde &quot; if the Serbs failed to abide_by a pullout agreement ratified in Belgrade earlier in the day . But there was no indication from the U.N. command center here that British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the commander for Bosnia-based troops , had called_for punitive action against recalcitrant Serbian gunmen still in the exclusion zone . &quot; There is finally some evidence that the threat of NATO air strikes is having an effect and the Bosnian Serbs are beginning to comply &quot; but need &quot; more time to pull_back , &quot; a senior Clinton_Administration official said a_few hours before the expiration of the deadline . The United Nations ' insistence that the Serbs be given more time to comply meant it was unlikely that any air strike would be launched before daybreak today at the earliest , another Administration official said . NATO officials had pushed for air strikes against Serbian targets earlier Saturday as it became clear that the rebels were inflicting further casualties and destruction on the city designated a U.N. safe area . They said Akashi , who was in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade earlier in the day , had refused the call_for air strikes , instead holding_out for eleventh-hour signs the rebels have been cowed into compliance . Any attack must be approved by both NATO and U.N. mission officials . Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic angrily denounced Akashi for vetoing intervention that might have saved lives in Gorazde , where 700 people have been killed in the Serbian offensive and 2 # 000 have been wounded . &quot; We do not understand why the U.N. on the ground here would not give this authorization since they know very well what happened today in Gorazde , &quot; Silajdzic said , saying he held Akashi and Rose personally responsible_for the latest civilian deaths . Earlier in the day , the American , British and French governments ordered the evacuation of all nonessential personnel and family members from their embassies in Belgrade , in fear that any air strikes would provoke retaliation against Westerners . Bosnian Serb gunmen took nearly 200 U.N. peacekeepers hostage and hampered the work of thousands last week after two token NATO air strikes against Serbian artillery firing on Gorazde . The head of Gorazde ' s regional governing council , Esad Ohranovic , said the city hospital and a refugee center were targeted again Saturday . &quot; The hospital is almost in ruins . We have no medicine , no blood , no food , &quot; he said via ham radio . He confirmed reports by U.N. officials that Bosnian Serb gunmen were concentrating their attacks on the Pobjeda munitions factory within the 1.9-mile radius of the city_center NATO ordered the rebels to withdraw from . After raking the arms complex with artillery and machine-gun fire all day , the rebels moved about 100 trucks into the factory grounds and began looting machinery and munitions stores , one U.N. source confirmed . Ohranovic said three factory_workers were injured when a shell blasted through the building they were working in only an hour before the withdrawal deadline . U.N. mission spokesman Cmdr . Eric Chaperon described the situation in Gorazde as &quot; confused &quot; and confirmed that the refugee-packed city_center was still under heavy artillery_fire late Saturday , in open violation of NATO ' s edict for an immediate halt to the Serbian onslaught . Despite the continuing hostilities , a convoy of about 200 U.N. troops from Ukraine , France and Norway were deployed to Gorazde late in the evening , circling the ravaged city_center before taking_up positions near the building where a handful of U.N. military observers have been hunkered_down against the siege . A smaller convoy of peacekeepers had tried to reach Gorazde two days earlier but was blocked about 18 miles to the north by a crowd of Bosnian Serb women and children . Hundreds of badly wounded civilians were awaiting medical evacuation from Gorazde , but a reliable cease-fire and some U.N. troops on the ground were needed before helicopters could be flown into the desperate pocket .</TEXT>
