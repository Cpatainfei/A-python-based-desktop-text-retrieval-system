   <HEADLINE> RECALL GROUP LOSES BATTLE FOR A RECOUNT OF PETITION ; LAW : SUIT ALLEGED THAT THE DIAMOND BAR CITY CLERK INCORRECTLY DISCOUNTED SOME SIGNATURES . TWO COUNCIL_MEMBERS ARE TARGETS OF CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST CLAIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Diamond Bar citizens group that staged a recall campaign against two council_members lost a court battle last week to win a recount of their petition . * The lawsuit charged that Diamond Bar City Clerk Lynda Burgess incorrectly discounted a number of signatures on the petition , leaving the group short of the number of names it needed to hold a recall election against council_members Gary Miller and Phyllis Papen . On Nov . 10 , Pomona Superior_Court Judge Burton Bach denied the request for a recount . &quot; The judge decided there was not enough evidence provided by proponents of the recall that any wrongdoing had taken_place to justify a recount of the signatures , &quot; Burgess said . The decision came as a bitter blow to the recall organizers , who lost the recall drive by less than 1 % of the 5 # 394 signatures needed to place the issue on the ballot . Furthermore , most of the signatures in_question were actual Diamond Bar residents who were improperly registered , Burgess said . Papen said she felt vindicated by the court decision . &quot; This was a personality dispute , &quot; she said . &quot; There was absolutely no grounds for a recall. &quot; The campaign against Miller and Papen began last fall and alleged , among other things , that the two council_members violated conflict_of_interest laws by voting for measures that could benefit them financially . The recall proponents charged that Papen voted for a waste-hauling franchise in the city of Covina that benefited her live-in boyfriend , a consultant for one of the waste haulers , Western Waste Industries . Papen acknowledged that she voted for the franchise , but said she never voted for a specific permit for Western Waste . They also maintained that Miller lied_about whether he owned RNP Development Inc. , a company that has had business before the City_Council during his tenure . Miller , however , said documents from the Fair Political Practices Commission confirm that he sold the company before he assumed public office . * &quot; There ' s not one allegation that was ever proven true , &quot; Miller said . &quot; Not one . They have turned me in to the district_attorney , the Fair Political Practices Commission , and I was found innocent_of all their charges. &quot; Recall organizers said they were dissatisfied with the decision , and are considering an appeal . They contend that Burgess refused to acknowledge a number of valid signatures , and that she sided with Miller and Papen . &quot; She has discriminated against people , and this is their constitutional right to sign a petition , &quot; said Lee Schad , a member of the recall campaign . &quot; It ' s not up_to a city clerk in Diamond Bar to say ' I ' ll give you this one but I ' ll take this one away. ' She represents the citizens of Diamond Bar , not just two City_Council members. &quot; Councilman Clair Harmony added : &quot; I sense that the whole process is tainted. &quot; However , Burgess said that in fact , she did not validate the signatures herself , but only confirmed judgments made by the County Registrar of Voters . * &quot; The crux_of_the_matter is , how in the world can I be biased if I didn ' t make the decision on the signatures , the county did ! &quot; she exclaimed . The final number of signatures fell_short by 52 names for Papen and 44 for Miller , Burgess said . Most of those , she said , were people who were improperly registered or who had moved but not re-registered at their new addresses . However , Schad said some of the signatures were thrown_out without warrant . In one case , she said , the registrar of voters disqualified a man whose signature on his registration did not match that on the petition . Schad said the man had suffered a stroke , which impaired his ability to write . In another instance she said a father and son with the same name , who lived at the same address , both signed the petition but were only counted as one person .</TEXT>
