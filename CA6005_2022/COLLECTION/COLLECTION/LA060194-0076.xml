   <TEXT> Months before the first coins fell_into a Louisiana video poker machine two years ago , federal and state investigators already were checking organized crime figures . Their probe resulted in the arrests Tuesday of 17 people accused of using a video poker company to skim profits for the Marcello , Genovese and Gambino crime families in Louisiana and New York . &quot; Will organized crime attempt to infiltrate legal gaming in the United States ? The answer , according to this indictment , unfortunately , is yes , &quot; said Neil Gallagher , FBI special_agent in_charge of Louisiana . Authorities would not estimate how much money the alleged scheme netted . About 14 # 000 video poker machines are operating in Louisiana bars , restaurants , truck_stops , racetracks and off-track betting parlors . Authorities said the investigation was continuing . They would not say if it is crossing over into an investigation of Louisiana ' s new casino gambling industry . Five riverboat casinos are in_operation , with 10 more planned . The world ' s largest casino is expected to open in late 1995 in New Orleans . Tuesday ' s arrests were made in Louisiana , New York and Florida on the basis of a sealed indictment handed up Friday following a 2 1 / 2-year investigation by the FBI and Louisiana State Police . Among those arrested were Anthony Carollo , identified by the indictment as current boss of the Marcello crime family . The racketeering charges allege that the Genovese and Gambino families aided the Marcello family in establishing and controlling Worldwide Gaming of Louisiana and its subsidiary , Louisiana Route Operators Inc. , which distributed video gaming machines . According to the indictment , Worldwide Gaming secured the sole rights in Louisiana to video poker machines made by industry giant Bally Gaming Inc. U.S. Atty . Robert Boitmann said Bally Gaming was the victim of the scheme and cooperated with investigators . Bally agreed to furnish Worldwide Gaming about $ 20 million worth of credit , cash and machines , the indictment said . Money from the machines , which could have been used to repay Bally , was diverted illegally to the crime families , the grand_jury alleged .</TEXT>
