   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; A MUSICAL-MYSTERY SEARCH FOR BEETHOVEN ' S ' BELOVED '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is a classic mad maestro look , half-rabid , half-rhapsodic , and seeing it on Gary Oldman ' s face unmasks &quot; Immortal Beloved &quot; even before you read the breathless prose on the rest of the poster : &quot; The genius behind the music . The madness behind the man . The untold love_story of Ludwig van Beethoven. &quot; Oh , brother . Yes , this is another one of Hollywood ' s silly symphonies , an unintentionally amusing bit of piffle that allows mortals a privileged glimpse into the private life of a legendary composer , letting us watch in awe as the great man indulges in passionate romantic liaisons and says things like , &quot; I am writing a new symphony . It will cause a scandal. &quot; And great he was , worthy of the somber funeral oration delivered in 1827 by Beethoven factotum Anton Schindler ( Jeroen Krabbe ) : &quot; He was an artist and who will stand beside him ? The thorns of his life wounded him deeply , but he held to his art . He carried the music in his heart even when he could no longer hear it. &quot; And so on . Devoted as Schindler was to the maestro , he is as shocked as the next person when a hidden document reveals that Beethoven left everything to the great love of his life , the never identified &quot; Immortal Beloved. &quot; &quot; The maestro was nursing a secret passion , &quot; Schindler all but gasps . &quot; Who could this be ? &quot; Armed with a list of likely suspects , Schindler ignores the composer ' s gruff surviving brother who wants the big bucks for himself , and sets_off on a grand_tour of former girlfriends , determined to solve this musical mystery because , and you can quote him , &quot; There can be no peace without the truth. &quot; The first stop is a sprawling hotel in Carlsbad where Beethoven and the I.B. were scheduled to have a rendezvous years before . But the lady mysteriously stormed out mere seconds before the maestro ' s arrival , causing the bereaved man to smash furniture and heave armchairs out the window like a rampaging rock_star . Next is Vienna and a visit to the Countess Julia Guicciardi ( Valeria Golino ) , an early Ludwig groupie who locks the door and insists , &quot; What I shall tell you will never leave this room. &quot; Though Beethoven had the personality of a common oaf , she reveals , he first became her piano_teacher and then won her heart . But her snooty father , upset at the maestro ' s increasing deafness and his humble birth , nixed the match . Deafness also forged a bond between the composer and another woman in the I.B. sweepstakes , the Countess Anna Marie Erdody ( Isabella Rossellini ) , encountered by Schindler in a roadside tavern knocking a_few back with the hearty peasants of her Hungarian estate . She met the composer at the first performance of one of his concertos when Beethoven ' s hearing disorder , which made the world sound like a jet , was forever revving its engines , causing him to act strangely and provoking audience laughter . &quot; His fire offended their small brains , &quot; the countess grumbles , still upset at the tyranny of petty minds . The last important woman in the composer ' s life is his sister-in-law Johanna ( Johanna Ter Steege ) , a no-nonsense , self-reliant type who got_on Beethoven ' s bad side by running_off with his favorite brother . Given how over the top he ' s been recently , Oldman is actually restrained ( for him ) as the romantic composer who storms through life railing against the commonplace , but the role is conceived in such a formulaic way , it can ' t arouse much interest . &quot; Immortal Beloved &quot; does have a_few things to look_forward to , especially the snippets of the man ' s splendid music , here played by soloists Murray Perahia , Emanuel Ax and Yo Yo Ma and the London Symphony_Orchestra conducted by Sir Georg Solti . But though Bernard Rose ' s interest in Beethoven is doubtlessly genuine , that has not stopped him from taking liberties with history and turning_out an inane piece_of_work , the kind of movie where you can actually see the irate master scratching Napoleon ' s name off what came_to be known as the &quot; Eroica &quot; Symphony . Those wild and crazy composers , they really knew how to live . * MPAA rating : R , scenes of violence and sexuality .
