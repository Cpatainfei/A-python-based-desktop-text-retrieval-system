   <HEADLINE> O.C. DISASTER CHANGES PLANE-DISTANCING POLICY ; AVIATION : CITING CRASH LINKED TO 757 WAKE TURBULENCE , FAA WILL REQUIRE AIRCRAFT TO STAY 4 MILES BACK INSTEAD OF 3 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Citing a crash that killed five people in Santa Ana last December , the Federal Aviation Administration has adopted a policy that will require smaller planes to stay farther behind Boeing 757 jetliners to prevent accidents caused by their potentially hazardous wake turbulence . But the regulatory_agency ' s actions -- part of a detailed set of new policies on 757s -- fall_short_of safety recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board earlier this year . And aviation-safety experts and pilots ' advocates termed the changes merely a &quot; first_step &quot; toward making the skies safer for aircraft_landings and takeoffs behind 757 jetliners . FAA Administrator David R . Hinson outlined the new policy in recent days in a letter to NTSB Chairman Carl W . Vogt . Beginning July 1 , the FAA will require that air-traffic controllers handling landings to keep aircraft four miles behind 757s -- instead of the current three-mile minimum -- to protect them from the miniature hurricanes produced by rapid air movement across the larger aircraft ' s wings . The NTSB in February had recommended that the FAA adopt minimum separation distances of up_to six miles behind 757s . The FAA , however , is not bound by NTSB recommendations . At least two crashes that took a total of 13 lives and three other serious accidents have been linked to wake turbulence from 757s since December , 1992 . Because it could potentially decrease the number of flights at the nation ' s airports and cut_into revenues of the hard-hit airline industry , the FAA has been reluctant to increase separation distances between 757s and tailing airplanes . While the NTSB does not consider the 757 to have any structural flaws , researchers have speculated that its unique , sleek-wing design may be the cause of the turbulence that can be unusually powerful for an aircraft of its size . The NTSB has found that because 757s and other newer jets can slow_down quicker than older jetliners , trailing aircraft can inadvertently close_in too quickly and fall below the 757 ' s descending flight_path -- a danger_zone where aircraft can encounter wake turbulence and suddenly be thrown_out of control . Both fatal_accidents happened when smaller jets flew into 757 wake turbulence as they were preparing to land . The Dec . 15 Santa Ana crash occurred when a twin-engine corporate jet was_on a landing_approach to John Wayne Airport . The jet , which was 2.1 miles behind a Boeing 757 , went_out of control and slammed nose-first into the ground near the Santa Ana Auto Mall . All five aboard , including the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger chain , were killed . The NTSB is still investigating the accident , but turbulence from the 757 is said to have played a part . The other fatal crash occurred in Billings , Mont. , in 1992 . Eight people were killed . NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said the safety board will review the FAA ' s new policies and draft a formal response over the next several weeks . Bob Flocke , a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn. , said , &quot; We think it ' s a good beginning . It certainly addresses part of our concern . But it doesn ' t , for instance , address separation on departures. &quot; The Air Line Pilots Assn. , the largest pilots ' organization in the world , recently issued its own advisory on 757s , recommending that pilots of smaller aircraft -- even MD-80s and DC-9s -- remain five miles or at least &quot; two minutes &quot; behind 757s on final approach , Flocke said . The organization also has recommended that pilots ask the control_tower for extra_time when taking_off behind 757s , Flocke said , to give more time for the 757 turbulence to diminish . Despite concerns from other corners of the aviation industry , the FAA said it believes that the four-mile separation is safe enough -- for now . &quot; The FAA believes that this interim increased separation will provide an extra margin of safety without unnecessarily impacting system capacity , &quot; FAA Administrator Hinson wrote in a May 20 letter outlining the changes to NTSB Chairman Vogt . The four-mile separation , Hinson wrote , recently was adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority in Great Britain and &quot; has significantly reduced the number of reported incidents &quot; there . As part of its new policies on 757s , Hinson said , the FAA is embarking_on a two-year test with the help of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to determine the precise level of danger 757 wake turbulence poses . The four-mile separation limit will remain in_effect until testing shows whether additional distance is necessary . After its own investigation , the NTSB last February unanimously advised the FAA to overhaul its 20-year-old aircraft weight classification_system , which is used to set separation distances . The FAA , however , said an overhaul was not warranted now , but that it would study the issue . Leo Garodz , a former FAA manager who was among the first to bring the 757 wake turbulence problem to the agency ' s attention in 1991 , said the new policies represented an &quot; initial step , &quot; but nothing more . &quot; It ' s a beginning , but it ' s only a beginning , because there ' s going_to be another accident , because things are not that precise at airports when there is a heavy traffic load , &quot; Garodz said . The FAA said it also plans to require air controllers to be more cautious when dealing with planes behind 757s ; educate pilots of 757s on the potential danger their aircraft poses to other planes ; encourage 757 pilots to use established approach_paths so other planes don ' t unwittingly fly into their wake ; and require air controllers to complete an annual course in wake turbulence . Canadian aviation officials have recently begun to require five or six miles of separation behind 757s , depending_on the size of the trailing aircraft . Their counterparts in the United Kingdom require a minimum of four- , five- or six-mile separation , depending_on aircraft size .</TEXT>
