   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; 11TH-HOUR ENVOYS OPEN ESCAPE ROUTE FOR CLINTON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For months , ever since President Clinton and his aides began seriously considering a U.S. invasion of Haiti , they have hoped against hope for one unlikely outcome : that Haiti ' s brutal rulers somehow would surrender without a fight . &quot; That would be quite a victory , &quot; a close Clinton aide mused recently . It would relieve Clinton ' s deep personal uneasiness about sending U.S. troops into battle , especially in an unpopular cause . And it would offer a badly needed policy triumph to a President who has seen too many of his domestic and international initiatives go awry . This tattered hope of escaping military conflict , with its special resonance for a young President who avoided military_service and opposed the Vietnam_War , lay behind Clinton ' s surprise announcement Friday that he is sending special envoys to Haiti this weekend . Clinton ' s unhappiness at the prospect of a military clash has been palpable : One visitor who saw the President on Friday said that he spoke_of the prospect of war without passion or conviction , as if he still had not made_up his mind . And in political terms , as Clinton knows from his 1992 campaign against George_Bush , even a military victory like the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War would be no guarantee of long-term presidential success . Officials said they had largely given_up hope for a negotiated end to the standoff with Haiti ' s military rulers until Thursday , when former President Jimmy_Carter relayed a message from the regime ' s leader , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , asking_for talks_about the junta ' s terms of departure . Officials are still not sure that the Haitians are serious , but they are willing to find_out . &quot; The word dignity has figured in quite a_few of the feelers we have received from them , &quot; one official said . It is as if the generals want to know how they would &quot; surrender their swords , &quot; he said . So with that slight encouragement , the idea of sending three distinguished Americans on a last-minute negotiating mission , even if its prospects of success are slim , offered Clinton one final hope for escape_from a war he does not relish . So eager was Clinton to try this one last chance at a peaceful outcome that he agreed to send Carter , retired Gen . Colin L . Powell and Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) to Haiti -- even though the message from Cedras was ambiguous : agreeing to talks_about his departure without clearly saying he is ready to go . Top officials acknowledge that they still do not know what Cedras and the other Haitian leaders -- army chief_of_staff Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby and police_chief Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois -- have_in_mind : whether they want to take the Administration ' s offer of a CIA-supplied safe passage out of Haiti and a comfortable exile in South_America , or whether they really intend , as they have said , to fight to the death . For weeks , U.S. officials have been receiving &quot; feelers &quot; from people claiming to represent Cedras or Biamby or Francois . Most turned_out to be insubstantial . But Carter ' s messages this week came directly from Cedras to the former President , so they at least had the virtue of being authentic . Nunn and Powell were added_to the mission for several reasons . One , although officials did not want to admit it , is to keep_an_eye_on Carter , who embarrassed Clinton in June by launching free-lance negotiations with North_Korea ( although officials now say they are pleased with the way that effort turned_out ) . Clinton also asked Nunn , who has opposed an invasion of Haiti , to explain clearly to Cedras that Congress is not , as a practical matter , going_to stop the military_action from going_ahead . And Powell was asked to participate because his stature as a famous retired general is expected to draw respect from the Haitian officers . Their presence on the delegation could also have the effect of disarming domestic opposition to Clinton ' s policy in Haiti , even if only slightly . Many members of Congress had called_on the President to send a final diplomatic offer to Haiti before launching an invasion . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) even suggested Powell for the job -- little dreaming that Clinton might take him up_on it . In that sense , even if Clinton ' s three emissaries fail , the mission will have symbolic value -- showing critics , both at_home and abroad , that the President went the extra mile to seek a diplomatic arrangement . But in the end , officials agreed , Clinton ' s main motive was simpler : He just doesn ' t want to go_to_war . Aides said they have been mystified by the charge from some Republicans that Clinton believes that a successful military_campaign will boost his popularity . Even a_few deaths among U.S. forces , or among American citizens in Haiti , could come_back to haunt him , they noted . And they foresee possible trouble down the road if U.S. troops remain on peacekeeping duty in Haiti , as expected , into the presidential election year of 1996 . &quot; Anybody who thinks we want to invade for political reasons , &quot; one official said wryly , &quot; isn ' t looking_at the polls. &quot; A High-Profile Team A look_at the envoys who were asked by President Clinton on Friday to go_to Haiti and meet military_leaders there in what could be a final effort to avoid a U.S.-led invasion . JIMMY_CARTER Whether he ' s wielding hammer and nails on a low-income house or the weight of his office in world affairs , Carter has hardly stopped trying to build things since he lost the presidency in the 1980 election . Carter , 69 , and the Carter Center he set_up have monitored elections in about a dozen countries , promoted child immunization and human_rights in the Third_World , and worked for the betterment of America ' s inner_cities . He is credited with negotiating a freeze on North_Korea ' s nuclear program and arranging for North-South talks earlier this year.. COLIN POWELL The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff may be going_to Haiti to explore peace , but he also had a hand in shaping the strategic thinking of the invasion force now massed against Haiti . Before retiring last year after a 35-year career in the armed forces , America ' s top military_officer moved to increase cooperation among the services with reforms that would be put to their first big test in a Haiti invasion . His authoritative , soothing manner during the Persian_Gulf_War made him a media star and raised expectations he might run_for the presidency . Powell , 57 , has been working_on his biography . SAM NUNN The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Nunn ( D-Ga. ) has expressed reservations about invading Haiti , saying the crisis there was not a vital U.S. interest and restoring democracy would be a long-term commitment . Nothing big that happens in the military , and not much in foreign affairs , escapes the scrutiny of Nunn , 56 , one of Washington ' s most powerful men . He voted against authorizing force in the lead-up to the Persian_Gulf_War when Republican George_Bush was president and has sometimes been at_odds with Democrat Bill_Clinton . But White_House officials said in January they had asked Nunn to become defense_secretary , and he refused .</TEXT>
