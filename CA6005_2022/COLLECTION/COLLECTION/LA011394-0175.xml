   <HEADLINE> REWIND : A CLIMBER ' S PEEK AT VIEWS FROM THE TOP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that &quot; Cliffhanger &quot; has hit the video stores , it ' s high_time for a look_at that and other cinematic &quot; peak experiences. &quot; Sylvester Stallone ' s movie may have realized gross receipts of $ 80 million , but climbers focused_on its gross implausibilities . Admittedly exciting opening scenes , for instance , find a young lovely , a first-time climber , following &quot; her man , &quot; surrounded by snowcapped peaks , up a spire that would give a more experienced climber pause in any season . As might never happen , the buckle of her harness all but melts during rescue efforts . The story , based on a premise by climbing guru John Long , is set_in Colorado but was filmed in Italy ' s Dolomites . The dialogue would n ' t see the pages of a self-respecting comic_book , but the views are worth the price of a rental . From this climber ' s point_of_view , however , there are any number of better choices : &quot; The Eiger Sanction &quot; ( 1975 ) , with Clint Eastwood starring and directing , still offers some of Hollywood ' s most convincing climbing footage , both in its early training sequences and later on the legendary north face of the Eiger in the_Swiss Alps . Presaging Indiana Jones , Eastwood opens the film as an art professor under the lustful gaze of female students . Dialogue in_general , and Jack Cassidy ' s characterization as a way-over-the-top stereotypical gay in particular , continue to smack of political incorrectness from a ' 90s vantage , and the rambling film could stand some editing , but Eastwood fans and climbers alike are sure to love it nevertheless . &quot; K2 : The Ultimate High &quot; ( 1992 ) proved more successful as a play with dialogue focusing_on character development and the relationship of two climbing partners in the face of potentially fatal crises . The Pakistani mountain setting -- presumably K2 , the second tallest peak on Earth , but actually Mt . Waddington in British_Columbia -- and relatively thrilling climbing sequences save the film version ; Michael Biehn plays a self-centered lawyer , while Matt Craven wrestles between mountain yearnings and responsibility to wife and new son . Released as part of a National Geographic &quot; Great Explorers &quot; box set this year , &quot; Return to Everest &quot; documents the 30-year anniversary of the historic climb of Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay . The documentary traverses , says the narrator , &quot; not only the great landforms of Earth , but a less visible geography , the private landscapes of ( Hillary ' s ) passage through the years , &quot; including the death of his wife and daughter in a plane crash , his son Peter ' s near-fatal accident in the Himalayas , and a reunion with Norgay . Footage of the 1953 expedition is dramatic . The film ultimately focuses_on Hillary ' s formation of a Himalayan Trust to support the building and staffing of 22 schools across Nepal . &quot; The Mountain &quot; ( 1956 ) is long on heart , short on realism and mostly just plain hokey , but Spencer Tracy is always great to watch . Here Tracy ' s a retired , respected climber , now a poor shepherd , with an incredibly greedy younger brother ( played by Robert Wagner ) who is not above taking the diamond from a dying Hindu ' s nose . The younger sibling persuades the scrupulous elder , against his better judgment , to again scale the Alpine peak overlooking their village so that the creep can plunder victims of a fatal air crash . Climbing sequences would embarrass most climbers , but E.G. Marshall and Claire Trevor in important roles add_up to enjoyable viewing . Other films set_in the peaks or involving climbing to a lesser extent include &quot; Lost Horizon &quot; ( 1937 ) , &quot; North by Northwest &quot; ( 1959 ) , &quot; For Your Eyes Only &quot; ( 1981 ) , &quot; Five Days One Summer &quot; ( 1983 ) , &quot; Shoot to Kill &quot; ( 1988 ) and most recently , and featuring the best plane crash ever and great moral dilemmas to boot , &quot; Alive ! &quot; ( 1993 ) .</TEXT>
