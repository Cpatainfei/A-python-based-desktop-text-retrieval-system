   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON IRAQ ; BARBS AIMED AT SADDAM MISFIRE ; THE U.N. EMBARGO HAS SHATTERED THE ONCE-SUBSTANTIAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS HELD BY WOMEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I recently attended a human-rights conference in Baghdad . When I told a friend that the Iraqi Federation of Women had invited me for this purpose , she smirked and , in a voice dripping with sarcasm , said , &quot; Human_rights ? In Iraq ? &quot; No one can condone any of the human-rights violations by Iraq , such_as the suppression of the Kurdish and Shiite peoples or the invasion of Kuwait . But there are other parts to this story , especially concerning the status of women . Iraq , before its long war with Iran and during the brief two-year interlude before the Gulf War , was one of the most progressive Arab states on women ' s rights . Women ' s education , for example , benefited from the law on compulsory education of 1976 , the national comprehensive literacy campaign of 1978 and the law of higher education and scientific_research of 1987 . For 15 years , there was a close association between Iraqi women and the organization I headed , the Women ' s Union of Greece . In 1979 , I visited many after-hours classes in elementary_schools where women of all ages were learning to read and write . Thousands of young_women were_on government scholarships studying abroad , encouraged to enter any and all professions . The Iraqi women ' s political rights included the following : the right_to_vote and hold parliamentary office and membership in political_parties , the right to membership in non-governmental organizations and associations , and the right to hold public-sector jobs . Compare this to women ' s situation in Saudi_Arabia or Kuwait . Most of these rights were wiped_out by the conditions created when the United States and its allies dropped 88 # 500 tons of bombs -- equal_to seven Hiroshimas -- on this land . The bombing killed and wounded tens of thousands of men , women and children , hitting mosques , churches , hospitals , schools , homes for children and the disabled and civilian shelters . Bombs and missiles also destroyed power_stations , sewage_systems and municipal services . This is a breach of Article 51 of the first protocol of the Geneva_conventions of 1977 , which calls_for protection of civilians against military operations and forbids attacks targeting them . The U.N. economic sanctions were placed on Iraq for refusing to withdraw from Kuwait and were continued after Iraqi troops pulled_out , following the cease-fire . The stated aim was to compel destruction of the country ' s capacity to produce chemical and nuclear_weapons . The whispered aim was to bring_down Saddam Hussein and to aid the Kurds and the Shiites . Saddam is still in power , with a weary and impoverished population unable to gather the revolutionary zeal for his overthrow expected by President Bush . As for the Kurds , the United States has never been a friend of the Kurdish struggle for self-determination . Its policy after the war produced the painful exodus of the Kurds , resulting in thousands of dead and homeless , hungry people . Now it is trying to assuage its guilt by dropping pallets of food into refugee camps while Turkey carries_out military raids against Kurdish villages in Iraq . The U.S. call_for an uprising of the Shiites , only to abandon those who made the attempt , resulted in the deaths of thousands more . Sanctions have , however , managed to create a weak economy , a physically debilitated people and three societal problems practically unheard of in prewar Iraq : crime , unemployment and prostitution . Women and children are bearing the brunt of these sanctions . Women whose partners were lost were thrown into the job market to feed their children . Divorce rates are up in two-parent families because of the stress and strain . Girls are dropping_out of school to help in the home . The acute shortage of basic food and medicines as well as their soaring prices has triggered a nearly 550 % increase since 1990 in the mortality_rate of children under 5 . And women are withdrawing from political activity , unable to handle all_the added responsibilities they now have . The stated aim of the U.N. resolution on sanctions was to stop Iraq ' s production of weapons of mass destruction . Iraq has complied with all_the conditions . It has officially dropped its claim to Kuwait as Iraq ' s 19th province . And it has agreed to long-term monitoring to ensure it is not resuscitating its weapons program . What is the purpose of continuing the sanctions ? A healthy , vibrant society is in a much better position to work for political change , to correct human-rights abuses , to build a democratic system . If the civilized world is to carry the banner of human_rights , it has to look_at its own actions . Denying people food , medications , sovereignty and peace_of_mind is another form of war . The Clinton_Administration inherited a policy . It is time it examined that inheritance and took the bold , humane action of removing the sanctions .</TEXT>
