   <HEADLINE> IN SHIFT , FDA SAYS IT COULD CLASSIFY NICOTINE AS A DRUG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a major policy reversal , the Food and Drug Administration Friday asserted its authority to classify nicotine as a drug -- a move that could lead to regulating or even banning virtually all cigarettes . But the agency urged Congress to provide clear direction on what it should do . In a letter to anti-smoking advocates , FDA Commissioner David A . Kessler all but accused the tobacco_industry of stoking a public addiction , citing &quot; accumulating &quot; evidence that nicotine content in cigarettes is being manipulated for that very end -- thus making cigarettes , in_effect , a drug that falls_under FDA jurisdiction . If the agency eventually reached such a formal finding , Kessler noted , &quot; it could have dramatic effects on our society. &quot; &quot; A strict application of these provisions could mean , ultimately , removal from the market of tobacco products containing nicotine at levels that cause or satisfy addiction , &quot; he said . An FDA spokesman added : &quot; The real bottom_line is : We and the Congress need to address this issue and determine whether or not we are to regulate cigarettes . Is this in fact what the public will is ? &quot; Kessler ' s comments came_in a letter to the Coalition on Smoking OR Health , which for years has urged the FDA to regulate cigarettes as a drug . &quot; We are surprised , but very pleased , &quot; said Scott D . Ballin , chairman of the coalition , which is composed of the American Heart Assn. , the American Lung Assn . and the American Cancer Society . &quot; The tobacco_industry is in the drug business . We know it . People who are desperately fighting their addiction to nicotine know it . And now the FDA knows it , &quot; Ballin said . The tobacco_industry disagreed . &quot; Cigarettes are not addictive , &quot; said Brennan Dawson , a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute . &quot; And if Congress were to consider this , it would be a very hotly debated topic. &quot; Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health , said Kessler ' s position will &quot; require us to do a lot of thinking and force Congress to figure_out a more rational scheme for handling tobacco. &quot; Unless Congress acts , Waxman said , &quot; the FDA is going_to have only one option : ban cigarettes , &quot; since the FDA cannot approve a drug that is known to be unsafe . A less drastic approach , he said , may be for the government to regulate the level of nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products . Waxman said he plans to hold hearings on the question . Rep . Mike Synar ( D-Okla. ) , who has been pushing the FDA for years to regulate cigarettes , said Kessler ' s position should add new impetus to a bill that he , Waxman and more_than 40 other members of Congress have sponsored to give the FDA &quot; explicit jurisdiction to regulate the advertising , promotion , labeling and content of tobacco without banning it from our society. &quot; Kessler ' s letter capped a week in which the tobacco_industry took some major hits . On Wednesday , McDonald ' s Corp . announced that , effective immediately , its 1 # 400 corporate-owned fast-food outlets will ban smoking and encourage its franchisees to do the same . On Thursday , Dr. Joycelyn Elders , in the surgeon_general ' s annual report on smoking , sternly warned young people that &quot; tobacco addicts and it kills. &quot; The industry is further under siege because President Clinton ' s health_care reform agenda proposes to raise the federal cigarette tax by 75 cents per pack , up from the current 24 cents . Cigarette smoking has been proved to contribute to heart_disease , strokes and a variety of cancers and respiratory ailments . Health officials blame smoking for an estimated 434 # 000 deaths annually . In recent years , as anti-smoking measures have proliferated at local levels , public interest_groups have stepped_up their pressure on the federal_government to take aggressive action . But until now , Washington has done little to heed those calls , with previous FDA commissioners adamantly refusing to assume jurisdiction over tobacco . In his letter , which seeks to navigate a potential legal minefield , Kessler said cigarettes can be regulated as a drug because of &quot; accumulating ( evidence ) that suggests that cigarette manufacturers may intend that their products contain nicotine to satisfy an addiction on the part of some of their customers. &quot; Kessler also cited research showing that &quot; 77 % of smokers desire to quit but cannot primarily because of nicotine addiction. &quot; &quot; Although technology was developed years ago to remove nicotine from cigarettes and to control with precision the amount of nicotine in cigarettes , &quot; Kessler said , &quot; cigarettes are still marketed with levels of nicotine that are sufficient to produce and sustain addiction. &quot; Kessler ' s letter came just days before the scheduled airing of an investigation by ABC-TV ' s &quot; Day One &quot; program alleging that the tobacco_industry has &quot; for years &quot; added extra nicotine to cigarettes to enhance their addictive qualities . But an FDA official said the timing of Kessler ' s letter was a coincidence . &quot; We did_it when the letter was finally in shape , &quot; the official said , adding that he has been aware of the developing legal strategy for nearly a year . Despite his tough words , Kessler said the agency would defer to Congress on whether to regulate cigarettes , noting : &quot; Given the widespread use of cigarettes and the prevalence of nicotine_addiction , such a regulatory action could have dramatic effects on society , &quot; including , he said , the potential emergence of a black_market . &quot; We recognize that the regulation of cigarettes raises societal issues of great complexity and magnitude , &quot; Kessler said . &quot; It is vital in this context that Congress provide clear direction to the agency. &quot;</TEXT>
