   <HEADLINE> FDA CITES RED_CROSS FOR VIOLATIONS AT BLOOD_BANK ; SAFETY : A MIAMI FACILITY DISTRIBUTED BLOOD EVEN THOUGH SOME DONORS ' MEDICAL_RECORDS WERE INCOMPLETE . OFFICIALS SAY THERE WAS NO HEALTH RISK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The American Red_Cross ' regional blood_bank for South Florida distributed 18 pints of blood in a two-month period last year even though the medical_records of the donors were incomplete , federal investigators say . Investigators with the Food and Drug Administration found that some of the blood distributed between May 2 and July 6 , 1993 , was used in transfusions before the Red_Cross issued a recall . Missing information included donors ' vital signs . The Red_Cross said there had been no health risk . However , Dr. Mark Simpson , director of transfusion services at George_Washington University Medical_Center , said : &quot; When you ' re not keeping records properly . . . there would be some increased risk of a defective product getting through. &quot; He reviewed the report at the request of the Associated Press . FDA investigators discovered numerous violations of safety rules at the Miami center , which receives donations of about 100 # 000 pints of blood a year . The March 25 report cited the &quot; failure of laboratory personnel to follow criteria specified by local operating_procedure &quot; and of the blood_bank to &quot; have an adequate monitoring system in place . . . for documenting the final disposition of blood components. &quot; A copy of the three-page report was provided by the office of Sen . Bob Graham ( D-Fla. ) . A Red_Cross official in Washington said the problems at the Miami center did not endanger the blood supplies . &quot; If public health had been at risk , we would have moved to shut it down , &quot; Felix Perez said . The Miami blood_bank ' s top official , Steven Nathan , said some of the lapses have been corrected and the remainder will be done_by July 1 , when a Red_Cross review of its blood_bank procedures nationwide is partly completed . In response to the report , the Red_Cross submitted to the FDA on April 14 a plan of corrective action for the Miami blood_bank , FDA spokeswoman Monica Revelle said . She said the plan &quot; appeared satisfactory. &quot; Details of the plan were not disclosed . The FDA licenses blood_banks and monitors their compliance with the safety rules , which are designed to ensure that the blood collected from donors for transfusions is free_of blood-borne diseases such_as AIDS and hepatitis . Among the FDA report ' s findings : * There were no records showing the final disposition of 2 # 850 units of blood components , including 197 units that had tested positive for viruses or had been rejected by laboratory technicians for other reasons . Blood components include plasma , the liquid part of blood , and platelets , small disks that help blood to clot . A pint of whole blood often is separated into two or three components that are given to different transfusion patients , thereby multiplying the risk of contracting blood-borne diseases . * The center neglected to have_on file the necessary FDA approval to distribute autologous blood in interstate commerce . That is blood transfused from people who wish to store it for their own possible use in an emergency . Autologous blood supplies sometimes are shipped across state_lines when the individual who stored them needs specialized treatment in a hospital in another state . * The center ' s procedures for irradiating blood and components , used for certain types of transfusions , do not include instructions to change the expiration date of irradiated blood to 28 days . Investigators found irradiated blood marked with its original expiration dates , which were too far in the future .</TEXT>
