   <HEADLINE> O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY ; LOSS LOOMS FOR SCHOOL UNITS THAT BORROWED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified could face some of the worst damage from the county ' s investment crisis because , like four other school districts , it borrowed about $ 50 million in the spring of 1993 to make money in the Orange County treasurer ' s now-failed investment pool . Lured by the prospect of high returns in a time of dwindling funding from the state , the district struck a deal with the county and joined the investment in high-risk derivatives . During the first year of the investment , the district made $ 1.5-million net_profit . About half of that was spent on technology labs , while the other half remains in the county pool , officials said . &quot; We ' re strapped for cash . To us it meant that we would n ' t have to cut as_many programs or suffer as much , &quot; said Kim Stallings , Placentia-Yorba Linda ' s assistant superintendent for administrative services . &quot; In retrospect it looks different , but we thought we had_the_best county treasurer in the state . It was a big mistake , unfortunately . Looking_back , it ' s always easy to say it was a mistake. &quot; The deal was separate but similar to the $ 200-million investment made by Newport-Mesa Unified , Irvine Unified , the North Orange County Community_College District and the Orange County Department_of_Education . At a meeting Tuesday night of the Irvine Unified School District trustees , Deputy Supt . Paul Reed issued an emergency report laying_out best-case and worst-case scenarios . &quot; In the worst case , we ' re broke ; we close the doors of the schools and we declare bankruptcy , &quot; Reed said . But the bankruptcy filing could stabilize things and allow the district to get face_value on its investment , he added . &quot; The reality is , we don ' t know. &quot; Unlike Irvine and the other three school agencies , Placentia-Yorba Linda received no special guarantees protecting its principal . But the district did buy insurance to help cover its losses in case the variable interest_rate on its $ 50-million loan skyrocketed . The insurance , however , doesn ' t protect the principal . Despite Tuesday ' s news that the county had declared bankruptcy , Stallings remained confident . &quot; We would have to lose quite a bit of money to lose more_than we ' ve earned , &quot; he said . &quot; Our big question is , ' Is the principal vulnerable ? Or is it going_to be protected ? ' We haven ' t been able to get an answer . If we ' re just going_to have decreased interest earnings , that ' s not going_to be as dire a situation. &quot; Though the five agencies that borrowed money for the investments have the greatest exposure , all 31 of Orange County ' s school districts could face massive losses , because they are required by state law to keep virtually all their money in the county treasurer ' s pool . As of Nov . 30 , school agencies had more_than $ 1 billion in operating funds in the pool , plus some $ 550 million in borrowed funds . Scrambling for information Tuesday , a handful of school finance officials from various districts met to consider strategy , while several school districts also consulted private attorneys . Many said they were searching for legal loopholes in the requirement that all funds be deposited with the treasurer , so that tax receipts expected next week could be kept_out of the ailing fund . Several also suggested that schools might have added legal recourse because they have no choice but to keep money in the fund . Ronald Wenkart , general counsel for the County Department_of_Education , said his office would probably hire outside legal and financial advisers as early as today . &quot; It ' s an unprecedented situation . We don ' t have the expertise in this area of the law , &quot; Wenkart said . But Wenkart and several other school officials said they were somewhat reassured by the bankruptcy filing because it will prevent a run_on the county fund and could stabilize the situation . &quot; My understanding is that the day-to-day operations of schools won ' t be affected , &quot; he said . &quot; Kids will still go_to schools , people will still continue to be paid. &quot; District superintendents and finance officers will meet Thursday afternoon at the county Department_of_Education . Until then , most are holding onto a wait-and-see attitude .</TEXT>
