   <HEADLINE> BOMB KILLS 9 , INJURES 60 AT CHURCH IN LEBANON ; TERROR : CATHOLIC WORSHIPERS WERE TAKING COMMUNION IN BEIRUT SUBURB . NO ONE CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A bomb exploded in a packed Maronite Catholic_church on Sunday , killing nine worshipers and wounding at least 60 as they lined_up in front of the altar to take Communion , police said . Eyewitnesses at the Our Lady of Salvation church in this suburb north of Beirut stared petrified as the bomb tore icons from the walls , splintered pews and ripped apart Bibles and prayer_books . Survivors screamed at the sight of blood running_on the church ' s marble floors . Worshipers ' umbrellas , shoes and handbags lay scattered as Lebanese Red_Cross volunteers rushed to administer first_aid to the injured . Among the dead was a 4-year-old girl . The priest celebrating the Mass , Father Antoine Sfeir , was among the injured . Lebanese security_forces found an even bigger bomb planted in the church organ and dismantled it . One witness saw the forces carry_away four old artillery shells bound together with a detonator . The scene of carnage was carried live_on Lebanese TV within minutes of the explosion , adding_to the shock felt across the city . Even in the worst days of Lebanon ' s 1975-90 civil_war , places_of_worship were rarely targeted by the country ' s rival militias . Lebanon ' s Cabinet called an emergency meeting Sunday night as investigators worked to establish a motive and identify the culprits . There was no immediate claim of responsibility , but some government officials speculated that the bombing could be linked to an upcoming visit by Pope John Paul II or to a lone gunman ' s massacre of 48 Palestinians in a West_Bank mosque early Friday . Lebanon ' s Muslim Prime_Minister Rafik Hariri went_to the church after Sunday ' s bombing and said it was carried_out by &quot; foreign hands &quot; to &quot; cover_up &quot; the massacre in Hebron . A similar charge was made by Foreign Minister Faris Bouez , a Maronite . &quot; It is not a coincidence that whenever Israel finds itself isolated . . . it resorts_to such harsh actions , &quot; Information Minister Michel Samaha said . But Samaha also entertained the possibility that the blast was aimed at foiling the Pope ' s scheduled visit to Lebanon in May . &quot; It could be aimed against the Pope ' s visit , and we hope that it was not carried_out by those who were against this visit , &quot; he said . Several Muslim fundamentalist groups and clerics have expressed reservations about the trip . The Pope , speaking in St . Peter ' s Square , denounced the bombing , telling pilgrims and tourists that he was suffering together with Maronite Christians over what he called &quot; a crime that offends Lebanon and its noble traditions. &quot; In Washington , President Clinton called the attack &quot; an outrage against faith and humanity. &quot; &quot; Just as Friday ' s massacre in a Hebron mosque was aimed at the peace process , this bomb attack seems clearly aimed at Lebanon ' s reconciliation process , &quot; he said . &quot; The people of the Middle_East deserve a peaceful future . They deserve the right to pray in peace. &quot; The Our Lady of Salvation church is unaffiliated with any Christian political figure , and no Christian dignitaries were attending Sunday ' s service . Christian fears of violence have run high since the Dec . 20 bombing of the headquarters of the Falangist Party , Lebanon ' s largest Maronite political organization . No suspects were apprehended in the crime , which killed three and wounded 130 . The country ' s 1 million Maronites , Lebanon ' s largest Christian sect , dominated the country ' s political scene since its 1943 independence from France . They are , however , considered the main losers in the 1989 Arab League-brokered peace_treaty that ended the country ' s civil_war by redistributing power among the sects . The Pope ' s visit will be a major challenge for the Lebanese government , whose ability to guarantee security has been in_question since the blast at Falangist headquarters and since the still-unsolved assassination of a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut on Jan . 29 . The bombing is also a setback for Hariri ' s government , which desperately needs stability to attract investment from foreigners and Lebanese expatriates for its reconstruction plans .</TEXT>
