   <HEADLINE> CAMPAIGN WINDS DOWN IN HISTORIC MEXICAN ELECTION ; POLITICS : THREE-DAY HIATUS BEFORE BALLOTING GIVES VOTERS TIME TO DECIDE BETWEEN RULING PARTY AND PROMISED CHANGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The election campaign that could end the dominance of the world ' s longest-ruling party wrapped_up Wednesday , leaving Mexicans a three-day hiatus to consider whether to vote Sunday for change . Candidates shook hands at street_corners and exhorted followers at rallies in a final attempt to firm the convictions of supporters and sway the undecided before , by law , they had to stop campaigning . But Mexicans could base their votes less on rhetoric than on performance . They know what to expect from the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . The opposition ' s only track record is the experience of Chihuahua , Baja California and Guanajuato -- three states with governors from the conservative National Action Party ( PAN ) . Whether voters believe that those state_governments have improved conditions could be a decisive_factor in their willingness to vote for the opposition . Politicians consider that factor seriously enough that PAN and PRI legislative delegations in Baja California have taken_out competing full-page advertisements in national weekly newsmagazines in the month leading_up to the elections ; the ads either tout or disparage the PAN administration in the state . Salvador Beltran del Rio , PAN candidate for the National Congress here , promised supporters : &quot; Our state is today an example of democracy and authentic separation of powers , where the legislature is truly independent . As a federal deputy , I will work to make this the reality in all Mexico. &quot; The candidate with the most riding_on the PAN ' s record is party standard-bearer Diego Fernandez de Cevallos . Fernandez -- who has risen to No . 2 in most polls , edging out Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) -- is generally thought to have_the_best chance of defeating Ernesto Zedillo , the leading candidate , and ending 65 years of PRI rule . If he succeeds , Mexicans will turn north to see what a PAN government might look_like . While Carlos Medina , governor of the central state of Guanajuato , is a caretaker -- the result of a political compromise after an election fraught with documented fraud -- the governors of Baja California and Chihuahua swept into office with clear mandates for change . They pledged to bring democracy to their states . In Chihuahua , where Francisco Barrio Terraza was elected in 1992 to the governorship that many Mexicans believe was stolen from him by fraud six years earlier , the PAN-dominated legislature is rewriting the state constitution to include referendums . &quot; Before , 80 % of the initiatives for new laws came from the governor and only 20 % from the state Congress , &quot; said Luis H . Alvarez , former national chairman of the PAN and now a candidate for the federal Senate from Chihuahua . &quot; Now , it is reversed. &quot; Ernesto Ruffo Appel , the first PAN governor in Baja California , created one of this nation ' s earliest , most powerful human_rights commissions and a pioneering electoral reform package : The state wrested control of its electoral rolls from the federal_government and introduced a high-tech photographic identification card for voters . That anti-corruption tool has become the model for the voter credential now used in Mexican federal elections . &quot; The fact that the cleanest elections anywhere in Mexico today are happening in Baja California is a tremendous tribute to Ruffo and his government , &quot; said Wayne Cornelius , director of the Center for U.S.-Mexico Studies at UC San Diego . Carlos Castillo Peraza , national president of the PAN , contends that the three PAN governors have given Mexico examples of clean , efficient public administration . &quot; There is a new climate of confidence in government , &quot; he said . But he may be overstating the case . Voters may_not be so impressed with PAN state_governments that they are eagerly awaiting the chance to elect candidates who will expand reforms nationwide . Still , recent events -- including a bloody Indian revolt in the poor southern state of Chiapas -- attest to the fact that Mexicans are impatient for change and that they will demand much more accountability from the next government . &quot; Even those people who will vote for the PRI want change , and it ' s a message the PRI has understood , &quot; said Jonathan Heath , president of Mexico_City consulting firm Macro Asesoria Economica . &quot; The old order no longer satisfies the vast majority , although no one can know with certainty which party platform provides the solution to the current difficulties , &quot; said Luis Rubio , director of the Center for Development Research , a private think_tank . A national poll by Washington , D.C.-based Belden &amp; Russonello showed no significant difference in Fernandez ' s support in PAN-governed states compared with the nation as_a_whole . A recent poll by the independent weekly Zeta showed Zedillo leading with 43 % of the vote_in Baja compared to 25 % for Fernandez . Internal PAN polls tell a different story , Alvarez contended . But those numbers are not public . Analysts note that being an incumbent has its disadvantages and that PAN state administrations have shown flaws . The PAN ' s popularity in Baja suffers because of the inevitable hardships and disillusionment that come_with holding office , said Tonatiuh Guillen Lopez , a political_scientist at Tijuana ' s College of the Northern Border . &quot; Baja California is by no means a fortress of the PAN , &quot; Guillen said . &quot; This remains an important national source of votes for the PAN , but the party is in a much more fragile position here than it was in 1989 &quot; when it took power . City and state leaders have been handicapped by inexperience , internal squabbles and an attitude toward power that verges on the old authoritarianism , critics say . Guillen cited a proposal by Tijuana ' s mayor for a comprehensive , locally funded public works initiative -- an innovative concept developed with the aid of enthusiastic World_Bank consultants . Although Guillen praises the plan itself , he said it was presented to voters as a fait_accompli and , therefore , ran_into resistance . The PAN has encountered similar problems in Chihuahua , said Leonel Reyes Castro , a PRI federal deputy from Chihuahua . &quot; They have been very clumsy in presenting their program . They have not been able to win_over either the other parties or the citizenry. &quot; In Chihuahua , Barrio ' s authoritarian record as mayor of Ciudad Juarez from 1983 to 1986 had worried some observers . Guillen said the often violent , controversial responses by police -- acting under Barrio ' s orders -- to street protests and sit-ins by neighborhood activists , teachers and students were &quot; intolerant , repressive and , finally , undemocratic. &quot; But he said Barrio ' s political persona has become more moderate since he ran_for governor . &quot; The Barrio who was in Juarez bears little resemblance to the Barrio who is now in the state_government . He now is practically a liberal. &quot; The biggest problems Barrio has faced as governor have been financial , starting with a $ 233-million debt left by the previous , PRI-run administration . The debt was supposed to be paid with highway tolls . But traffic projections were optimistic , and toll income has run 40 % below expectations . Combined with an insolvent pension_fund and medical plan for state workers and restrictions on state powers to tax , the debt has left Mexico ' s largest state with a budget that is impossible to balance . Neophyte opposition leaders in both Chihuahua and Baja California also have been battered by a frightening onslaught of narcotics-related violence , common in many Mexican states . Chihuahua ' s rugged , inaccessible mountains have long been a favored area for cultivating marijuana and dropping_off stronger drugs for transport across the border to Texas . Tijuana ' s geographical value in the international drug trade has made the city a stage for brazen murders , shootouts and high-level police scandals . The bloodshed reached unprecedented heights this year with the assassinations of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and of the Tijuana police_chief -- crimes blamed on the mix of drugs and political corruption . Opponents say crime has surged to anarchic levels ; the tense security around the Baja governor and Tijuana mayor seems to symbolize a government under siege . PAN officials retort that drug violence is a problem that requires national and international solutions . Thus , once in office , PAN leaders find themselves bogged down in the same problems that their PRI predecessors faced , making_it difficult to accomplish all that they promised . &quot; The PAN ' s platform was change , &quot; Reyes Castro said . &quot; I have not seen a great_deal of change . It ' s been mainly personal style. &quot; For example , he said , licenses are issued more quickly since the Barrio administration automated the state ' s data processing systems . But they cost more . The structure of public spending has not changed much either , he said . But much of the state budget is from federal revenue-sharing and must be spent on mandated programs , such_as schools . On the other hand , Reyes Castro said Barrio and his administration have made no major gaffes , which is about the evaluation offered by other residents of the state_capital . &quot; They have run the government well , &quot; said Ever Fauda , 22 , a college_student . &quot; They have denounced corruption and improved the flow of traffic . But I am not going_to vote based on a party , but on the candidate . I will probably decide on election day. &quot; Darling reported from Chihuahua and Rotella from Tijuana . Issues at_Hand The key issues Mexico ' s elections . CLEAN AND FAIR ELECTIONS : Both the government and civil groups have made unprecedented efforts to promote clean elections . But with a long history of vote fraud , many Mexicans may_not even bother to go_to the polls . One recent opinion poll showed that 53.6 % believe the elections will be irregular , unclear or fraudulent . PEACE : Some have warned that massive civil protest could ensue if there is any appearance of fraud in the elections . CHIAPAS : The armed Indian peasants in southern Chiapas State say they will refuse to recognize a PRI victory . Currently observing a cease- fire , they have threatened to resume hostilities if the elections are unfair . DEMAND FOR CHANGE : After 65 years of rule by the PRI , many Mexicans are demanding change , giving strength to the opposition and forcing promises of a major restructuring from the ruling party . STABILITY : Several independent pollsters concluded that many Mexicans feel the best choice for political and economic stability is to stay with the PRI ; a change right now could be disasterous , they argue . The opposition says it can provide stability , too . ECONOMY : Short term challenges are to keep the peso stable and prevent capital flight . Mexicans hope their economy will pick_up after the elections put political uncertainty to rest . Researched by SUSAN DRUMMET / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
