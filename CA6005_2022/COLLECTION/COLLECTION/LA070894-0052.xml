   <HEADLINE> SKY WATCH ; A COSMIC COLLISION ; BEGINNING JULY 16 , PIECES OF COMET SHOEMAKER-LEVY 9 WILL SLAM INTO JUPITER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Astronomers are calling it the most cataclysmic cosmic event of this century -- more unusual even than the appearance of Halley ' s Comet . And you don ' t have to leave the San Fernando Valley to catch_it . For about a week beginning July 16 , the scattered pieces of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 will slam into Jupiter with more force than dozens of atomic_bombs . Although the collisions will occur on the dark side of the solar_system ' s largest planet , some scientists expect the impacts to briefly affect Jupiter ' s appearance , as seen from Earth . THE HISTORY Comets are essentially dirty icebergs traveling through space , heating_up as they pass close to the sun -- an effect that releases comet dust into tails that are stretched_out by the solar_wind . Most comets are believed to originate from a cloud of comets at the edge of the solar_system and to somehow get knocked into orbit around the sun . Jupiter is a ball of hydrogen and helium gas about 1 # 000 times more massive than Earth . It rotates about every 10 hours , making_it the fastest spinning planet in the solar_system . Jupiter ' s Great Red Spot , which could engulf two Earths , is a cyclonic storm that has been raging for centuries . On July 8 , 1992 , Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 passed close enough to Jupiter for gravity to break it into a string of 21 fragments , most with comet tails of_their_own . By July 16 of this year , the distance between these fragments could span more_than 4 million miles , with particles ranging_in size from that of the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square to the city of San Fernando . The comet was discovered by observers at Palomar Observatory near San Diego on March 25 , 1993 . Like all comets , it was named after those who spotted it first -- professional astronomers Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker and amateur astronomer David Levy . The &quot; 9 &quot; signifies that this is the ninth comet discovered by this team . Analysis of the comet ' s orbit revealed two startling facts : that it was the first known comet to orbit a planet ( Jupiter ) rather than the sun , and that the comet ' s icy fragments will collide_with Jupiter during the week of July 16 to 22 . THE IMPACTS Never before have earthbound stargazers had the opportunity to witness the effects of a comet smashing into a planet . And although the spacecraft Galileo will be positioned perfectly to send us photos of the comet shelling the planet ' s atmosphere , scientists have no clear idea of what we will see from Earth . In the most dramatic scenario , the exploding fragments could illuminate the Jovian moons caught in the shadow of Jupiter . The most likely candidate is Europa , which will be behind Jupiter when fragment K -- the particles are given letter names -- slams into the planet on July 19 . Other scientists predict that the impacts will briefly illuminate Jupiter ' s faint ring . A more likely effect will be atmospheric turbulence on Jupiter . Some scientists expect the impacts to briefly disrupt the planet ' s cloud belt , perhaps creating miniature spots south of its Equator . Another prediction is that shock_waves could ripple across the entire planet . Theoretically , the event could also be a dud : Some scientists predict that Jupiter ' s atmosphere will quietly swallow_up the comets like a whale scooping_up shrimp . Although scientists may_not agree on the outcome , there are three things on which they can agree : First , earthbound observers will have to wait at least 30 minutes after each collision before the impact site rotates into view . Next , observers shouldn ' t expect to see a dramatic explosion , but rather subtle changes in the appearance of the planet . And finally , it will take knowledge of how Jupiter looks now to appreciate the changes . HOW TO PREPARE Get_to know Jupiter . The cheapest way is to buy the July issue of &quot; Sky &amp; Telescope &quot; magazine at a newsstand , or a $ 5 guide to the comet / Jupiter impact published by the nonprofit Planetary Society in Pasadena . Familiarize yourself with Jupiter ' s cloud belts in the southern_hemisphere ( about 40 to 50 degrees south latitude ) , where the impacts will occur . Then head to Griffith Observatory in Griffith Park to view the action . A more expensive option -- but without the long lines expected at the observatory -- is to use your own telescope to study Jupiter in the weeks before and during the impact . Fortunately , Jupiter is bright enough to be seen from your back yard . Turn_off indoor lights and take about 30 minutes to let your eyes adjust . The darker the site , the better the view through the telescope . If you are going_to purchase a telescope , get the right one . It should have at least a four-inch aperture . The bigger the aperture , the more you will see . Consult a local telescope store and avoid toy-store varieties . Do not , however , buy a telescope just for the comet / Jupiter impact : If it ' s a dud , you ' ll feel ripped_off . Although this is a once-in-a-lifetime event , a telescope is a purchase best made_for a lifetime of stargazing . Where and When What : Griffith Observatory ' s comet collision activities . Free to the public , the observatory ' s 12-inch telescope will be focused_on Jupiter throughout the week of July 16-22 , with a live video feed of Jupiter from the telescope available for viewing on a screen inside the museum . Additional telescopes will be_on the lawn July 16 . During this week , the observatory ' s 7:30 p.m. planetarium show will feature a 10-minute segment on the collision . Location : 2800 E . Observatory Road , Los Angeles . Hours : Observatory museum is open 12:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. daily . Telescope viewing dusk to 9:45 p.m. , except for July 16 , 20 and 21 , when it will be open until midnight . Planetarium show times are 1:30 , 3 and 7:30 p.m. Monday through Friday ; 1:30 , 3 , 4:30 and 7:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday . Price : Observatory entry is free . Planetarium show is $ 4 for adults , $ 3 seniors 65 and older , $ 2 children 5-12 . Children under 5 are admitted only to the 1:30 p.m. show on weekends , for free with a paid adult admission . Call : ( 213 ) 664-1181 for general information ; ( 213 ) 663-8171 for weekly sky report . Also : To purchase the Planetary Society ' s guide to the collision , &quot; Once In A Thousand Lifetimes , &quot; call ( 818 ) 793-5100 . The price is $ 5 .</TEXT>
