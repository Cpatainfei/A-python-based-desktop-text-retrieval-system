   <HEADLINE> THE BOSNIA DILEMMA ; YELTSIN WARNS SERBS TO STOP ATTACKS ; RUSSIA : THE KREMLIN LEADER ' S SHARPLY WORDED STATEMENT SHOWS SHIFT IN ATTITUDE TOWARD LONGTIME ALLIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin on Tuesday warned the Bosnian Serbs to keep their promises to Russia and stop attacking Muslim civilians trapped in the U.N. safe area of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina . Yeltsin ' s sharply worded statement was a sign that Russia ' s patience with its traditional Serbian allies is wearing_thin , as what appeared to be a major foreign_policy triumph by a resurgent Moscow turns_into an embarrassing rout for Russian diplomacy . &quot; The Bosnian Serb leadership must fulfill its promises given to Russia , stop the attacks and withdraw from Gorazde . . . enable the introduction of U.N. forces in the area and unblock the U.N. personnel in Bosnia and Herzegovina , &quot; said Yeltsin ' s statement , distributed late Tuesday by the semiofficial Itar-Tass news_agency . But Yeltsin ' s statement fell far short of endorsing air strikes by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization on rebellious Serbian armies that are menacing Gorazde and Sarajevo , the Bosnian capital . On Monday , Yeltsin ' s special envoy to the former Yugoslav federation , Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin , said a group of Bosnian Serb extremists had &quot; fallen ill with the madness of war &quot; and had broken cease-fire promises made to Moscow . Churkin said he had reversed his previous stance and would now recommend to his superiors that Russia support &quot; energetically &quot; new NATO air strikes . Yeltsin ' s statement said the international community must do its best to achieve a political settlement of the Bosnian crisis . He called_for a summit on Bosnia that would include officials from Russia , the United States , the European Union and the United Nations . Earlier in the day , Yeltsin spoke by telephone with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . The Kremlin leader told Kohl that &quot; Russia made and is making the maximum effort to prevent the escalation of the crisis around the city of Gorazde , &quot; but to no avail . &quot; The Bosnian Serbs do not keep their word , &quot; Yeltsin said , according to Itar-Tass . Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev , still stinging from the betrayal , warned the Bosnian Serbs to &quot; stop taxing the patience of the world community. &quot; The Russian Security_Council will meet today to discuss the Bosnian crisis . A closed_session of the Duma , the lower house of the Russian Parliament , will also be held today . But snubbing or punishing the Bosnian Serbs or their allies in Serbia could prove politically risky . Neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky has championed their cause , and public_opinion remains sympathetic .</TEXT>
