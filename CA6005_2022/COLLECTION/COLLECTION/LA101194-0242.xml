   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS REPORT NEW DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR CANCER ; MEDICINE : MARKERS OF THE DISEASE ARE MATCHED WITH CELLS IN TISSUE , BODY_FLUIDS . RESEARCHERS HOPE THE BREAKTHROUGH WILL LEAD TO EARLIER DETECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A diagnostic test for cancer that could revolutionize screening for the deadly disease has been developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical_Institutions . The new test , reported in today ' s issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , identifies replication errors in DNA that occur frequently in cancer . The errors , known as clonal markers , are used as a fingerprint for cancer . Researchers hope the breakthrough will bring a general cancer screening method to identify cases sooner than existing tests . The researchers compare markers from several types of cancer with cells found in tissue , body_fluids or secretions from a suspected cancer site . If the markers match , there is a strong indication that the patient has cancer . &quot; Clonal markers are a definitive indicator of cancer . If you see these markers , you know you ' ve found disease , &quot; said Dr. David Sidransky of the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center and principal_investigator of the study . Use of the test on people at high risk for bladder and cervical cancers could begin within a year , Sidransky said . He said the test could also be used to detect other cancers , including cancers of the lung , breast , colon and prostate . &quot; What makes this so easy is that it ' s just a very simple technology , &quot; Sidransky said . &quot; It ' s a one-step thing . The whole_thing can be done_in one day. &quot; Sidransky said he believes the test , expected to cost about $ 50 , may become part of routine medical_care , providing an easy method of detecting cancer in its earliest and most treatable stages . However , he said the test is still in its experimental phase and must be validated through a series of larger trials , which could take years to complete . Further trials also are needed , he said , to verify that the test identifies cancer earlier than standard methods . &quot; But the reason we ' re so confident is that even if you only detected half of all cancers -- even if we fell_short_of expectations -- you ' d be detecting a lot more cancers than you are now , &quot; Sidransky said . Researchers also plan to use the test on cancer patients whose tumors have been surgically removed in an effort to see if the patients have any residual cancer_cells .</TEXT>
