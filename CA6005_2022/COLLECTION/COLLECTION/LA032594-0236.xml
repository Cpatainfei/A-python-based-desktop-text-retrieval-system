   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : BREA ; SCHOOL TRUSTEES OK ANTI-BIAS POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brea Olinda Unified School District trustees this week gave final approval to a policy that prohibits students from discriminating against each other and stresses zero tolerance against such behavior . &quot; We will not accept or condone discrimination , &quot; Assistant Supt.Peter J . Boothroyd said . &quot; We will not tolerate it. &quot; Under a similar policy implemented earlier this month , students who display or distribute flyers or any kind of hate material , including stickers and buttons , will face suspension or expulsion . In addition , students are prohibited from name-calling and from discriminating , harassing , teasing , abusing or assaulting other students because of a handicap or a difference in background , ability , religion , culture , race , ethnicity , language , tradition or sex . The &quot; zero tolerance &quot; policy will make students aware that district officials will not stand_for discrimination or actions stemming from hatred for schoolmates , Boothroyd said . District officials said the policies were implemented in an effort to prevent racial and ethnic discrimination among students . In the past year , four students were suspended after racial discrimination incidents . Until last year , principals would call parents and counsel students against discrimination , but now such problems have to be reported to the district.MIMI KO</TEXT>
