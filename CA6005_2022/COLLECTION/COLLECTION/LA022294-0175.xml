   <HEADLINE> EURO DISNEY AUDIT GIVEN TO BANKERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A long-awaited audit on the ailing Euro Disney theme park was submitted Monday to a committee representing 60 banks that have lent money to the park . Euro Disney ' s bankers , which have named nine banks to represent them in debt talks with the park ' s U.S. parent , Walt Disney Co. , commissioned the audit by KPMG Peat Marwick last year . Euro Disney , with $ 3.58-billion in debt , has said it is facing serious cash problems and is being financially supported until March 31 by Walt Disney Co . The bankers and Disney are trying to find a way to ease Euro Disney ' s debt burden by that deadline . The audit report will serve as a basis for negotiations . One source close to the talks said the report , which was rather positive for Euro Disney , had been commissioned to analyze Euro Disney ' s past and examine debt restructuring proposals by Walt Disney Co . that were made in November and rejected by the banks waiting for the audit . The bank committee could not say Monday when another meeting of the bankers will take_place .</TEXT>
