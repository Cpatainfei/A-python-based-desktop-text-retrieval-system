   <HEADLINE> U.S. RAISES PENALTIES FOR CHILD LABOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS ; WORKPLACE : EMPLOYERS NOW FACE MULTIPLE FINES FOR AN INJURY OR DEATH . THE SANCTIONS ARE ANNOUNCED AMID A PUSH FOR MORE SUMMER JOBS FOR TEEN-AGERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to crack_down on companies that subject teen-age employees to hazardous working conditions , the Labor_Department on Thursday began enforcing stiffened penalties for child work safety law violations . Under the new sanctions , employers that allow young workers to suffer serious injury or death can be fined $ 10 # 000 for each violation . Previously , negligent companies faced a $ 10 # 000 penalty for each accident . A single accident can involve multiple violations . Child protection advocates said that many young workers are mistreated on_the_job . Hospital emergency_rooms treated teen-agers for 64 # 000 job-related injuries in 1992 , according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health . &quot; As the school_year draws to a close , teens across the country will be looking_for work , &quot; said Bernard Anderson , assistant labor_secretary for employment standards . &quot; They mean everything to us as parents and they are undeniably our country ' s most valuable asset. &quot; As the penalties took_effect Thursday , the Clinton_Administration announced its plans to create more_than 600 # 000 summer jobs for young people . Labor officials also urged private employers to hire 330 # 000 teen-agers for summer help . More_than 4 million children work in the United States in every industry from agriculture to manufacturing to food service . Frequently , teen-agers suffer burns and cuts while working_at fast-food restaurants , become caught in agricultural machinery or are hit by cars while delivering newspapers , said Dr. Phillip J . Landrigan , a child specialist at Mt . Sinai Hospital in New York . Work-related deaths are caused primarily by machinery , electrical accidents or falls , according to the National Child Labor Committee , a New York-based advocacy group . A NIOSH report on working youngsters found that 70 % of deaths involved violations of federal child labor laws . Studies show that older teen-agers are injured more frequently than young adolescents but that child injury is less prevalent than adult injury . Labor_Department officials said they expect the new policy to mean that more money will be collected in fines assessed in job-related injury cases . For example , if a 15-year-old is killed while operating a forklift in a warehouse , the Labor_Department could dock the company once for violating rules against minors operating forklifts and again for breaking laws against 14- and 15-year-olds working in a warehouse . A company could be fined $ 20 # 000 for such an accident under the new penalties but could have been charged with a maximum of $ 10 # 000 under the old system . &quot; The whole purpose is to deter violations , &quot; said Art Kerschner , chief of the department ' s child labor unit . &quot; We don ' t want to deter children ' s employment. &quot; More stringent penalties probably will not prompt businesses to hire fewer children , said Dorianne Beyer , general counsel for National Child Labor Committee . &quot; When employers need certain types of employees , for example those that can work part-time without benefits , they have no choice . They have to hire kids , &quot; Beyer said . Illegal child labor is the driving force behind &quot; an underground economy &quot; in the garment industry , said Jo-Ann Mort of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in New York . &quot; It ' s so prevalent that you can go_into the heart of the garment district and almost everywhere you look , there ' s a sweatshop. &quot; New York state has a labor &quot; SWAT team &quot; that storms into suspected sweatshops and searches for safety violations . Investigators have turned_up serious safety violations and in one sweatshop found children who had lost fingers while operating a machine used to make leather belts . In Los Angeles , child workers are most often injured using meat-slicing machines , dough mixers and in occupations that involve driving , a Labor_Department spokeswoman said . Working Children A U.S. Labor_Department study at six Los Angeles high_schools found : 50 % of 14- and 15- year-olds in violation of laws barring companies from working them past 7 p.m. during the school_year . 15 % of 14- and 15-year-olds in violation of laws barring companies from employing them in construction jobs . 5 % of 16- and 17-year-olds in violation of laws barring companies from employing them to use meat-slicing or dough-making equipment . Why They Work To buy clothes , cars , other goods 74 % Required to contribute to family income 25 % Source : Labor_Department Wage and Hour Division study of 204 students , in April , 1991</TEXT>
