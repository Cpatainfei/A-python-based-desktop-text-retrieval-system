   <TEXT> Unusually warm temperatures , including a record-setting mark in downtown Los Angeles , sent many to the beaches Wednesday and made_it seem like summer had arrived early . &quot; Usually , January through March is the rainy_season in Southern California , &quot; said Curtis Brack , a meteorologist for WeatherData , which provides forecasts for The Times. &quot; But of the larger storms that usually come_through , very few have developed. &quot; While temperatures may cool a bit in the next few days , forecasts call_for more sunny and dry weather , Brack said . Locally , temperatures reached 78 degrees in Santa Ana , 83 in Fullerton and 82 in Lake Forest . The same-day record for Orange County is 87 degrees , set 16 years ago in Santa Ana , according to WeatherData . The normal temperature for this time_of_year is about 69 degrees . In downtown Los Angeles , the mercury hit 87 degrees , breaking the 86-degrees record set_on the same date in 1910 , the National Weather Service reported . Nowhere was evidence of the heat greater than at local beaches , where bigger than usual crowds were reported , including 16 # 000 people in Newport Beach and about 15 # 000 at Huntington Beach . Said Newport Beach Marine Safety Lt . John Blauer : &quot; It was enough to make us think summer is almost here. &quot;</TEXT>
