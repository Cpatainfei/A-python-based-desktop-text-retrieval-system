   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ; SEISMIC EXPERTS DIFFER ON PACOIMA DAM ; TEMBLOR : CALTECH PROFESSOR SAYS IT MIGHT NOT HAVE HELD IF FULL . OFFICIALS MARVEL AT MASSIVE GROUND MOTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pacoima Dam survived a pounding by the Northridge earthquake , but the huge ground motions recorded there Jan . 17 should cause dam builders and operators in seismic zones worldwide to re-examine the safety of their structures , a dam expert said Thursday . Appearing in Burbank before the state Seismic Safety Commission , Caltech engineering professor John F . Hall said he believed the 365-foot-tall dam in the San Gabriel Mountains , which will require costly repairs , might not &quot; have remained intact &quot; if the quake had struck on one of the rare occasions when its reservoir was_full . But Vernon H . Persson , state dam safety chief , said he believed the massive impoundment would not &quot; have failed even if full. &quot; While noting that area dams came_through the quake without a single failure , commissioners and earthquake experts marveled at the enormous ground accelerations measured at Pacoima Dam , which reached_a_peak level of twice the force of gravity . When &quot; people around the world involved in dam engineering see the records , they ' re just going_to be amazed , &quot; Hall said in an interview . Experts say the quake caused shaking far stronger than would be expected in a 6.8 quake . Ground motion recordings also confirmed that there is something about the setting of the dam -- perhaps involving the steep canyon walls -- that amplifies earthquake shaking . Ground motion recordings were so high there during the 1971 Sylmar quake that some experts attributed them to instrument error . Hall , who led a quake reconnaissance team for the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute , said ground motion readings at the dam should not be dismissed as a local anomaly because many dams bridge steep canyons . Persson , chief of dam safety for the state_Department of Water Resources , said that dams , in_general , did_well in the quake . Of 108 state-supervised dams in the quake area , only five , including Pacoima , sustained enough damage to need detailed inspection_and_repairs -- and Persson said even those pose no immediate threat to public safety . The state lacks jurisdiction over about a dozen federal dams in the region , and a commission staff_member said the Army Corps of Engineers had declined a request to address the panel . Persson said corps officials had inspected the area ' s federal dams &quot; and said they were in good shape. &quot; The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works , which uses Pacoima Dam for flood_control , has hired consultants to assess damage to the 65-year-old structure -- once the tallest concrete arch dam in the world . The quake created a two-inch gap between the top of the dam and a massive concrete block connecting it to the canyon wall . It also caused that concrete connection to move about a half-inch downstream relative to the dam ' s crest . Damage from the Sylmar quake was similar , although less severe , and the dam was repaired and strengthened at a cost of about $ 3 million . Ken Swanson , a supervising engineer with the public works department , said officials hope by the end of the month to have a preliminary estimate of repairs needed after the Northridge quake . As a precaution , the reservoir pool is being kept at a maximum elevation of 1 # 884 feet -- 66 feet below the spillway -- where it was when the earthquake struck . For several years after the Sylmar quake , state officials restricted water_levels behind the dam , until convinced it had been adequately repaired and strengthened . The four other dams include the Los Angeles Reservoir in Sylmar and two old , adjacent dams now used as storm drains , according to Mitchell Sakado , an engineer with the city Department of Water and Power , who said repairs_to the structures will cost more_than $ 1 million . The fifth dam , built_in 1888 and empty , is_on Porter Ranch Development Co . property at the western end of Chatsworth Street . * RELATED STORY : A1</TEXT>
