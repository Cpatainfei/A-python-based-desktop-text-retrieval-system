   <HEADLINE> LIFE AFTER DEFENSE ; MORE THAN 50 FIRMS CLAMOR TO USE PART OF ROCKETDYNE SITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Can an old government nuclear site find new life in commercial markets ? In the rocky hills above Simi Valley , Rocketdyne and federal energy officials are trying to find_out . The U.S. Department_of_Energy ' s Energy Technology Engineering Center , or ETEC , is 100 acres of weeds , dirt roads and sweeping , smog-free views in the Santa Susana Mountains . Surrounded by barbed-wire fences and blue-clad guards , ETEC has been cloaked in anonymity for most of its long history ; it used to be a testing site for parts for nuclear_power plants . Faced with budget_cuts , ETEC , which is managed by the Canoga Park Rocketdyne unit of Rockwell International , has been forced to open its doors to entrepreneurs . More_than 50 such firms have contacted ETEC asking_for the use of everything from its 70-megawatt natural-gas-powered steam generator , to powerful machines that simulate earthquakes . Most of the interest comes from firms that want to test and demonstrate new inventions before taking them to market . Among the new start-up firms that have signed agreements with ETEC is MKE Inc. , a tiny company owned by a retired utility engineer and his wife who run the business from their home_in Upper St . Clair , Pa . They want to test a super-efficient , non-polluting industrial furnace . Another is Hydrogen Burner Technology Inc. , a group of six professionals in Costa Mesa who say they can overhaul a conventional motor so that a car would convert some gas into usuable hydrogen fuel . Altogether , the number of companies interested in getting a piece of ETEC bodes well for the site ' s future , proponents say . Manny Tessier , manager of quality assurance and training at the site , believes that ETEC , unlike so many other relics of the cold_war defense buildup , will make a successful shift from government contracts to commercial business . &quot; We are getting calls every day , &quot; he said . But ETEC has a way to go before it ' s likely to replace the fat government contracts that once kept about 350 people employed . Today , only 140 Rocketdyne scientists , engineers and technicians work there . The Energy_Department ' s funding for ETEC , which costs about $ 25 million a year to operate , was scheduled to end in 1993 with the shelving of the government ' s fast-breeder nuclear_reactor program . But local politicians , government_agencies and community groups , including the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. , successfully persuaded federal_officials to continue funding ETEC through 1995 to help the site become an industrial technology incubator . The highly specialized equipment at ETEC is not something to discard lightly , say its defenders . &quot; It would be a shame if the kinds of facilities located at ETEC fell_into a state of disrepair or were not available for use . They are a real resource , &quot; said Tom Tobin , executive_director of the state Seismic Safety Commission . Tobin said there are only a handful of sites in the state that have earthquake shaking tables similar to those at ETEC . A community task_force called the Community Reuse Organization has been working to market the site . So far , interest runs high , but actual revenue generated has been modest . About $ 2.5 million in the fiscal 1995 budget will come from new sources , including research agreements with five private companies , said ETEC site manager Robert Le Chevalier . * The Department_of_Energy and the task_force are also looking_into possible contracts to allow companies to lease parts of the site , and they have begun a series of public workshops there . But Le Chevalier said the real changes are still to come . Ten more research agreements with private companies may be signed within the year . One pending agreement involves a mirror-decked solar collector used for experiments more_than a decade ago , which may be refurbished to produce hydrogen fuel . And energy officials are negotiating with Exergy Inc. of Hayward to help build a $ 90-million full-scale demonstration power_plant based on the company ' s new technology , he said . At first glimpse , ETEC , which is part of Rocketdyne ' s 2 # 700-acre Santa Susana Testing Facility , seems an unlikely spot for a new generation of commercial technology . The cluster of modular office_buildings on the site have the drab paint and narrow hallways so characteristic of Southern California ' s outmoded defense facilities . Much of the rest of the site is vacant land . Visitors who stray far from the buildings are warned to watch for snakes . For a short period during the 1950s , ETEC was home to a nuclear testing program for space propulsion and power_plants . A small nuclear_reactor on the site once provided electricity for the city of Moorpark , but the nuclear program was deemed impractical as more people moved_into surrounding areas , Tessier said . Today , all that ' s left of the reactor is the barn-like structure in which it is housed . The federal_Department of Energy hopes to complete cleanup by 1997 of residual radioactive waste on the site left from these programs . Besides the steam generator , ETEC has machines called shaking tables that replicate earthquakes . Other facilities were designed to subject parts to friction , wear and sudden temperature_changes , which can break faulty pipes much as a cold glass will shatter when filled with boiling water . One large structure holds a snarl of twisting pipes , six stories high , suspended like sausages . The structure is designed to accommodate sudden temperature_changes , which cause pipes to expand and contract and rip loose from ordinary bolts , explained John Boggio , who manages the structure . The replacement value of all this elaborate hardware is estimated at $ 500 million , much less than other Energy_Department national laboratories . The site could become &quot; a model of a commercial-defense technology incubator , &quot; said Rohit Shukla , executive_director of the Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance and a member of the Community Reuse Organization . &quot; We have put a lot of investment into defense , and it ' s about time we see it come_back to us in our daily lives. &quot; that ' s a view shared by the companies that have successfully taken_advantage of ETEC ' s availability . Their new agreements with ETEC provide_for the use of equipment , power and metallurgy laboratories there and allow them to benefit from the skills of Rocketdyne engineers and technicians at the site . One of the first companies to use the site was Exergy Inc. , owned by Alexander Kalina , a Russian-born inventor who signed an agreement with ETEC in 1987 . Kalina has since successfully demonstrated his idea for power generation based on the so-called &quot; Kalina cycle , &quot; which increases power_plant efficiency . The Kalina Cycle employs ammonia and water , which produce steam , and special processes for condensing steam and recovering waste heat . Exergy has invested $ 14 million in its small-scale demonstration plant at ETEC , said Hank Leibowitz , vice_president of engineering for Exergy Inc. Newer projects at ETEC include testing of building parts for earthquake safety for the state_Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration . There is also a pending agreement with Clean Air Now , a nonprofit environmental group , and Xerox Corp . to test hydrogen-powered vehicles and filling stations . Paul Staples , executive_director of Clean Air Now , said the technology has been developed , but &quot; we need to get real data , have real-life demonstrations . . . . ETEC plays a very critical part. &quot;</TEXT>
