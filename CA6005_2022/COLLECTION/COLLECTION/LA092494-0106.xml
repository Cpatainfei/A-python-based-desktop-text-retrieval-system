   <HEADLINE> BULLISH ON THE BEAR ; INVESTORS REGAINING FAITH IN RUSSIA , ITS OFFICIALS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The frenzied flight of capital from Russia is over . Investors have already poured more_than $ 2 billion into Moscow ' s levitating stock_market . And Russia is now ready , willing and stable enough to absorb more foreign investment , Russian officials said Friday . Foreign investment in Russian securities increased by 40 % each month in July and August and should reach $ 1 billion a month by the year ' s end , Deputy Prime_Minister Anatoly B . Chubais said in an interview published in Friday ' s Izvestia newspaper . In the most tangible sign to date that citizens have regained confidence in the battered Russian economy , at least 10 % of the incoming dollars are from Russian nationals . They had stashed their money in overseas bank_accounts but now see greater investment opportunities back home , Chubais said . Other economists say up_to 50 % of the incoming dollars are investments by Russians . &quot; Reforms have changed the fundamentals of society , &quot; said Chubais , who is also Russia ' s privatization minister . &quot; Financial stability has been achieved . And if today we solve the investment problem , tomorrow everybody will be talking_about the Russian economic miracle. &quot; This burst of official happy talk comes_on the eve of a summit in Washington between President Clinton and Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin . There Yeltsin is expected to pitch Russian ' s economic turnaround -- and plead for more foreign capital . Clinton intends to encourage Americans to double their investments in Russia and has arranged for Yeltsin to meet at the White_House with three top_executives from General Motors , Dresser Industries and U.S. West . Clinton has also asked Congress for a permanent end to Cold War-era trade restrictions , and he supports most-favored-nation status for Russia . This week , the Russian government began openly courting both Russian and overseas investors . While Chubais touted the success of the Russian stock_market , a senior adviser to Yeltsin talked up the government ' s commitment to improving the business climate at an American Chamber_of_Commerce luncheon . Yevgeny G . Yasin , head of the President ' s Analytical Center , spoke Friday to an audience of more_than 100 dapper Western business people in the American-managed Radisson Slavyanska Hotel , where Clinton stayed when he visited Moscow in January . The economist rattled_off a list of new presidential decrees he said would improve the tax status of foreign investors -- and he urged American executives to sink their money into Russian factories , which so far have been left_out of the investment boom . Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin also announced a new plan this week to devote 0.5 % of Russian gross_domestic_product to investment in private companies that can repay the loan in two years . The state will own 20 % of each of these companies and private investors -- including foreigners -- will own the rest . Still , economists remain skeptical that Russia will soon attract the long-term capital investment its ailing industrial sector desperately needs . Without such capital , the Russian nationalist nightmare could come true : With obsolete factories bankrupted by cheaper and better imports , Russia would be reduced to being a Third_World supplier of raw_materials to the West . Many Russians are extremely wary of foreign investment -- particularly the kind of investments that foreigners want to make , said Clifford Gaddy , an economist who studies Russian defense conversion at the Brookings Institution in Washington . They fear that &quot; foreigners are going_to buy_up all_the good stuff -- oil , gas , lumber , metals , &quot; Gaddy said , that &quot; they ' re going to ship all that stuff out of Russia and use it in their own industry , and sell it back to Russia in the form of a Sony TV. &quot; Most of the new investors are pension_funds and other giant institutions with so many billions of dollars under their management that they can afford to risk a tiny percentage in Russia ' s wildly unregulated securities markets , Gaddy said . And , of course , they are mainly buying shares of privatizing companies that have rights to oil , gas , timber , metals and other raw_materials . So far , they ' ve been making a killing . The new Moscow Times Index of stock prices shows the market leaped 30 % in the past 22 days . ( The index tracks the over-the-counter price of 30 Russian stocks . The base of the index is the total market capitalization of the 30 companies on Sept . 1. ) Even with a Russian inflation_rate estimated at 6 % this month , that return puts the Dow Jones to shame . Investors must have steel stomachs . The ruble plummeted 5 % against the dollar in a single day Thursday . Russia has no equivalent of the Securities and Exchange Commission , no disclosure laws , an underworld that is financially astute and no enforceable legal guarantees for investors . But the profits are irresistible . &quot; The fastest money in the world is now being made in Russia , &quot; said Izvestia economics columnist Mikhail Berger . &quot; Everybody realizes that this kind of chance comes only once in 100 years. &quot; New Index Soars The Moscow Times has launched the TM index , based on the over-the-counter price of 30 Russian stocks . The base of the index is the total capitalization of the 30 companies on Sept . 1 . The total values of the index has risen 30 % since the first of the month , when it started . Sept . 1 , 1994 = 100 Sept . 22 : 129.92 Source : Moscow Times</TEXT>
