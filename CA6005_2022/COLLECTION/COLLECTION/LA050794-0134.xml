   <HEADLINE> ELIZABETH_II , MITTERRAND INAUGURATE CHANNEL_TUNNEL ; EUROPE : THE HEADS OF STATE MEET IN CALAIS , THEN TAKE HISTORIC RIDE ON LE SHUTTLE IN THE QUEEN ' S ROLLS-ROYCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Queen Elizabeth_II and French President Francois Mitterrand inaugurated the_English Channel_tunnel Friday , the first land link since the Ice_Age between the island of Britain and the European Continent . Both heads_of_state opened new rail terminals in their respective capitals of London and Paris before meeting at Calais , France , for a ride through the tunnel , which cost $ 15 billion and took seven years to build . The queen , speaking in French , described the tunnel , dubbed by many the Chunnel , as one of the world ' s &quot; great technological achievements. &quot; &quot; To rejoin what nature separated some 40 million years ago has been a recurring dream of statesmen and engineers for several centuries , &quot; the queen said . &quot; This is the first time in history that the heads_of_state of France and Britain have been able to meet each other without either of them having to travel_by sea or air. &quot; After traveling through the tunnel by a sleek Eurostar train from a new terminal at Victoria Station in London , the queen met Mitterrand for ceremonies in Calais , then they both got_into her Rolls-Royce and boarded Le Shuttle for the return trip to Folkestone . Le Shuttle and Eurostar are the twinned trains that will carry passenger_cars and freight trucks through the tunnel , one tube in each direction with a service tunnel separating them that can carry emergency vehicles . Motorists will drive their vehicles onto the trains at each end for a half-hour , 31-mile trip in either direction , then debark to expressways at Calais or Folkestone . But because of delays in the arrival of special tunnel cars and communications_equipment , the passenger traffic service will not start until sometime in the autumn . The Chunnel completion itself has been plagued over the years by delays and cost-overruns -- the project cost almost double the original estimates . Further , the_British have been years behind the_French in providing a high-speed rail link to the Chunnel . For the next several years , while their French counterparts zip along , trains on the_British side will travel at speeds well below 100 m.p.h. In recent days , some experts questioned the safety and reliability of the Chunnel , burrowed well under the channel seabed . To counter any terrorist threat , teams of police will be poised at entrances with equipment to detect explosives , the operators say . At its best , the Chunnel will soon offer a three-hour rail journey between London and Paris or Brussels . Ferry operators claim that they will eventually be able to lower their prices and suggest that their services will be more reliable , especially in the upcoming early months when post-construction bugs are still being worked_out . Chunnel supporters say the rail trip between London and Paris or Brussels eventually may be reduced to little more_than two hours ; they see as_many as 15 million people making the trip every year -- with 60 trains a day , each carrying up_to 800 people . On a political level , some in Britain suggest that the physical link will bind this country closer to the Continent .</TEXT>
