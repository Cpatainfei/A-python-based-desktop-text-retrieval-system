   <HEADLINE> ILLICIT DRUG USE BY YOUTHS SHOWS MARKED INCREASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Illicit drug use by teen-agers increased significantly between 1992 and 1993 , driven by a dramatic rise in the use of marijuana and more use of stimulants , LSD and inhalants , federal_officials announced Monday , noting that the trend reverses the downward patterns seen in recent years . &quot; These findings are more_than a warning signal , &quot; Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E . Shalala said at a press_conference to announce the results of the annual survey of nearly 50 # 000 8th- , 10th- and 12th-grade students . &quot; They are an urgent alarm we must heed at once. &quot; To convey the growing sense of urgency , three Cabinet officers -- Shalala , Education_Secretary Richard W . Riley and White_House Office of Drug Control Policy Director Lee P . Brown -- announced the results of the annual survey together , pledging to step_up efforts to alter the trend . While similar studies for Orange County teen-agers are not complete , officials on Monday said that local drug use appears to be stabilizing , with no significant trend shifts in the recent past . Sandra Fair , a manager with the Orange County Health_Care Agency , said that among those teens seeking treatment , the drug used most often is marijuana . Reflecting a trend in the general population , youths in treatment have shown increased use of LSD , according to Fair . But counselors also have noticed a drop_in the use of cocaine and of several drugs at one time . In Washington , Shalala said she plans to contact the presidents of broadcast networks , film studios , record companies and professional sports leagues to urge them &quot; to rededicate themselves to getting the message out about prevention. &quot; Brown said he will convene a national meeting of experts in prevention and drug education to confront the problem of drug_abuse . &quot; Drug use among American young people has been making a clear comeback in the past two years , &quot; said Lloyd Johnston , the University of Michigan research scientist who conducted the survey , adding that the nation had &quot; been lulled into a false sense of security &quot; by declining numbers in previous years . William J . Bennett , who first headed the drug policy office during the George_Bush Administration , immediately blamed the Clinton_Administration for the increases . &quot; Although we still have a serious drug problem in America , the Clinton_Administration has been nearly invisible on the drug issue , &quot; he said . &quot; The Administration ' s most prominent voice on drugs , &quot; Bennett said , &quot; has been Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders and her favorable words about drug legalization. &quot; He was referring to Elders ' suggestion that the issue of drug legalization should be studied . Sen . Joseph R . Biden Jr . ( D-Del. ) , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said the new pattern &quot; emphasizes the need for immediate action in fighting both drugs and crime. &quot; The increases &quot; are in part the result of an erosion of anti-drug attitudes by youth , &quot; said Richard A . Millstein , acting director of the National Institute on Drug_Abuse . &quot; Now more_than ever , we need to counter erroneous messages that glamorize the use of illicit drugs , alcohol and cigarettes. &quot; The findings cut_across all socioeconomic levels and showed that &quot; contrary to conventional wisdom , &quot; black students reported the lowest rates of use for virtually all drugs , Johnston said . According to the survey , which has been sponsored annually since 1975 by the National Institute on Drug_Abuse , the percentage of high_school seniors who reported using an illicit drug at least once in their lives increased from 40.7 % in 1992 to 42.9 % in 1993 but still remained well below the peak level of 65.6 % recorded in 1981 , the report said . Nevertheless , the 1993 increase reverses a downward trend of use by 12th-graders that began in 1981 . Use of any illicit drug in the past year by high_school seniors increased from 27.1 % in 1992 to 31 % in 1993 after steadily declining from a peak of 54.2 % in 1979 . Those seniors who said they had used an illicit drug within the last month increased from 14.4 % in 1992 to 18.3 % in 1993 . The use of marijuana increased by three or four percentage_points during the last two years among 8th- , 10th- and 12th-graders , according to Johnston . In 1993 , the proportion of students reporting marijuana use in the previous year was 9 % for 8th-graders , 19 % for 10th-graders and 26 % for seniors . &quot; Put another way , the proportion of 8th-graders using marijuana has increased by half in the last two years , while the proportion of 10th-grade users increased by about a quarter and the proportion of 12th-grade users by about a fifth , &quot; Johnston said . Although the rates are_well below the peak levels reached in the late 1970s , &quot; they clearly represent a reversal of the declines we recorded for more_than a decade , &quot; he said . The survey also showed that legal drugs -- alcohol and cigarettes -- still are the most widely used among the nation ' s youth at all grade levels . Two-thirds of eighth-graders and nearly nine-tenths of seniors have tried alcohol , the report said . Times staff writer Elaine Tassy contributed to this report .</TEXT>
