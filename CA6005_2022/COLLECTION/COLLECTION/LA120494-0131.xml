   <HEADLINE> HIGH CELLULAR RATES CALL FOR ACTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s large and powerful cellular_telephone carriers are at it again . Recently criticized by the California Public_Utilities Commission for refusing to lower cellular rates to more_than 2 million California consumers , the cellular carriers now accuse the PUC of thwarting &quot; entrepreneurial zeal &quot; by asking the Federal Communications Commission to allow it to impose limited regulatory oversight . The PUC has prodded the carriers for years to reduce rates , with little success . Except for an occasional promotional pricing plan for new customers , since 1984 basic monthly access and usage charges in California remain virtually unchanged and are among the highest in the nation . In Los Angeles and San Francisco , subscribers pay basic rates of $ 45 monthly for access and 45 cents per minute in peak usage periods . Prices for the &quot; competing &quot; cellular carriers in any city are almost identical . After years of study , the PUC has declared that cellular prices remain &quot; unreasonably high. &quot; THe PUC ' s conclusion is supported by the U.S._Government Accounting Office , which in 1992 studied 30 major cellular markets in the United States , including Los Angeles , San Francisco and San Diego . In its report titled &quot; Concerns About Competition in the Cellular Telephone_Service Industry , &quot; the GAO found that the duopoly market structure imposed by the FCC was restricting full competition , which in turn was likely leading to excessively high rates . ( FCC policy permits no more_than two licensed cellular carriers to offer service in any city. ) Likewise , the FCC determined in March that cellular is still not fully competitive , a sentiment echoed in a recent Wall_Street Journal article . So what ' s the cure for these high cellular rates ? The cellular carriers would have you believe that deregulation will lower prices . This notion is silly at best . No company lowers prices if it isn ' t forced to by competitors or regulators . In fact , the only thing keeping AirTouch from raising its rates in Sacramento is the PUC , which so far hasn ' t agreed to its request . ( Keep_in mind that cellular carriers are free to lower prices today and that we have seen precious little of that freedom exercised. ) The answer to high cellular_telephone rates in the long_run is competition . In industries where there is effective competition , government oversight is both unnecessary and counterproductive . We need to encourage the development of more wireless competitors , which the federal_government is doing through its auction of personal communications service licenses . But this potential competition , which is years away , must be monitored carefully because the most likely bidders for these PCS licenses are the cellular carriers ! In the interim , the PUC must retain its regulatory_authority . Backed by United Consumers Action Network and Toward Utility Rate Normalization , the PUC has petitioned the FCC to allow it to continue to regulate cellular rates . This will protect consumers against any rate increases . It will also allow the PUC to continue its efforts to inject more competition into these markets and deal with the sticky issue of bundling cellular_telephone equipment with service , all_of which will lead to lower consumer prices . Far from thwarting &quot; entrepreneurial zeal , &quot; as alleged by the cellular carriers , the PUC ' s continued regulatory_authority will protect consumers from excessively high prices by these communications duopolists . The FCC needs to approve the PUC ' s petition . GWEN MOORE Assemblywoman ( D-Los Angeles ) Chairwoman , Utilities and Commerce Committee</TEXT>
