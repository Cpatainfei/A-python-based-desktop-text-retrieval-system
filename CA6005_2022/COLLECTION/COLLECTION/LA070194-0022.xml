   <HEADLINE> D.A. ' S CASE APPEARS STRONG BUT DEFENSE WILL TEST IT ; STRATEGY : SIMPSON ' S LAWYERS WILL TRY TO KEEP_OUT KEY EVIDENCE , 911 TAPES . IT WON ' T BE EASY , EXPERTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It can appear to be a powerful case : Blood_tests link the suspect to the scene , a search conducted under a warrant uncovers incriminating items and police have evidence showing the suspect had brutalized the victim before . But skillful defense work -- and the right set of circumstances -- can unravel the most carefully crafted prosecutions . By filing a variety of motions , lawyers for O.J. Simpson will try to keep_out evidence that allegedly ties the famed former athlete to the murders of his ex-wife and her friend . In addition to suppressing evidence from a search of Simpson ' s home , defense_attorneys may also try to exclude Simpson ' s statements to police , old 911 tapes of Nicole Brown Simpson calling_for help as a man identified as O.J. Simpson raged in the background and the results of tests that might indicate blood and hair found at the murder scene matched Simpson ' s . None of it will be easy . If Simpson ' s lawyers successfully show the initial search of Simpson ' s home was illegal at a hearing Tuesday , the prosecution could lose key evidence : the bloody glove that matched one found at the murder scene and possibly even blood found on Simpson ' s driveway . &quot; It would be an amazing event that the most crucial piece of evidence in a high-profile murder case was thrown_out , &quot; said Cristina Arguedas , a Bay Area criminal defense_attorney . &quot; That would take one gutsy judge. &quot; But such motions have succeeded before in long-shot cases . In a Bay Area case , a man facing 40 years in prison after drugs and a machine_gun were found in his home was set_free because police had made a false implication in applying for the search_warrant . In the Christian Brando murder case in 1991 , the same lawyers who are defending Simpson successfully kept_out Brando ' s statements to police because an officer had omitted a phrase in the reading of the Miranda rights . And an appeals court in San Francisco ruled DNA evidence inadmissible two years ago because of scientific uncertainty over how to calculate the odds of a match . In the motion to suppress evidence , Simpson ' s lawyers argue that the police , scaling a five-foot-high fence , illegally entered the grounds of the ex-athlete ' s Brentwood home when they first went there at 4:30 a.m. on June 13 to notify him of his ex-wife ' s death . Once on the grounds police found the bloodstained glove and noticed blood leading from Simpson ' s white Ford Bronco on the street to his front_door , according to an affidavit by Los Angeles Police Detective Phil Vanatter . Police are required to obtain a warrant to search someone ' s property except under certain conditions , such_as an emergency in which they fear imminent destruction of evidence . Even a search done with a warrant can be unlawful if police misrepresented an important fact in seeking it . Simpson ' s lawyers contend that police inaccurately characterized Simpson ' s absence in their warrant application by stating that he had left on an &quot; unexpected &quot; flight to Chicago . But a warrant can only be thrown_out on grounds of deliberate misrepresentation if the magistrate would not have issued it without the false_statements . Some defense_attorneys said Thursday they believe the warrant might be upheld because police said they saw blood on the driver ' s door handle of Simpson ' s white Ford Bronco , which was parked on the street . That evidence alone might have been enough to obtain the search_warrant . &quot; There are so many open questions , &quot; said Loyola University law professor Laurie Levenson . &quot; The affidavit is really very bare bones . The officers don ' t say they are doing what they are doing . That may be very important. &quot; As the case proceeds , Simpson ' s lawyers also may try to prevent the prosecution from using his statements to the police before his arrest . Simpson talked to police for three hours without an attorney present on the day after the murders . But trying to keep_out his statements is &quot; going_to be very hard in this case , &quot; said Bay Area defense_attorney Ted Cassman , because Simpson apparently signed waivers , presumably giving_up his Miranda rights , and had talked to an attorney beforehand . Veteran defense_attorneys say it is always unwise for a suspect to talk to police , and Howard Weitzman , Simpson ' s first lawyer , has said he advised Simpson against speaking_to them . Police can freely lie to the suspect or trick him into believing they already have strong evidence against him , Cassman said . It is not yet known what Simpson told the police , but defense_attorneys say prosecutors could try to use any inconsistencies in his statements against him . &quot; Ninety percent of statements have been thrown_out because someone asked_for a lawyer and the cops refused to get them one , &quot; Cassman said . Simpson ' s statements , on the other hand , probably would be admissible if he signed Miranda waivers and was rational enough to know what he was doing , several defense_attorneys said . The Simpson defense probably would have better luck in excluding the 911 tapes from the trial , an issue that would arise in the trial , not the preliminary hearing . A judge would first have to decide whether the tapes were relevant to the murder_charges against Simpson , and secondly , whether their relevance was outweighed by the prejudice they would create against the defendant . Prosecutors could not use the tapes only to show that Nicole Simpson feared her ex-husband , attorneys said , because her state_of_mind would be considered irrelevant . But if the tape had shown that Simpson had threatened to kill her , prosecutors could argue that a prior threat is admissible . Even without the tapes , Simpson ' s alleged assaults against his former wife could be admitted into evidence . &quot; The courts have a great_deal of discretion , &quot; San Francisco Public_Defender Jeff Brown said . Court rulings on admitting evidence of prior abuse in such cases have been divided . In a 1983 murder case , a state appellate_court held that evidence that a husband dragged his wife outside their home , sprayed her with a hose and yelled obscenities at her was irrelevant and inadmissible . The court said there was no close connection between the husband ' s previous action and the wife ' s death . But in another case three years later , a different state appellate_court held that a prior assault could show motive to kill and ill_will and therefore was admissible . Prior violence is generally admissible if it demonstrates the defendant acting according to a common scheme or plan . For example , evidence that linked a defendant to a signature murder where a playing card was left on the victim could be used to buttress evidence against him in a nearly identical murder . &quot; But there is no common scheme or plan between an allegation of hitting during an argument in 1989 and breaking_down the door , &quot; said an experienced San Diego criminal defense_lawyer , referring to two incidents that sparked Nicole Simpson ' s previous calls to the police . &quot; That is not even close to what we are talking_about in this case. &quot; Brown likened the situation to that of a psychotherapist who was accused in a lawsuit about five years ago of raping a patient . Fifteen former patients were prepared to come_forward to say he also had sexual_intercourse with them . But because their testimony would not have addressed questions of the defendant ' s motive or identity , it was disallowed , Brown said . &quot; All it showed was the defendant ' s propensity , &quot; Brown said . &quot; Propensity evidence doesn ' t get_in under California law. &quot; DNA evidence could also be problematic . Most courts in the country admit such genetic evidence , but California ' s appellate_courts have been divided on the question and the California Supreme Court has not yet ruled on it . A court of appeal in San Francisco held two years ago that a critical part of DNA evidence -- the statistics that show that someone other_than the defendant would have the same genetic profile -- was inadmissible . The court excluded the evidence on the grounds that scientists were in fundamental disagreement about the validity of statistical methods used by the FBI and a private testing lab in the case . In that case , the prosecution had relied_on a type of DNA testing that can take two to three months and produce powerful results that juries find hard to overlook . For instance , the test can determine that the chances of another person having that DNA is only one in several million . In a pending case , a state appellate_court is being asked to rule on the validity of a DNA testing method known as polymerase chain_reaction , or PCR . It can be done more quickly than the older method , but does not purport to show such high odds against a similar match . No court in California has ruled on this method . Prosecutors say it is sound but some defense_attorneys are wary . Walter Krstulja , a senior trial_attorney and forensics expert in the Los Angeles public_defender ' s office , warns that PCR evidence can be unreliable because samples can easily be contaminated . &quot; The test appears very promising , &quot; he said , &quot; but issues of quality_control and contamination still have to be worked out. &quot; Alameda County prosecutor Rockne Harmon , who has often used DNA results in his cases , strongly believes the testing methods and statistical analyses are sound . &quot; Trial_judges don ' t have much difficulty ruling this evidence admissible , &quot; Harmon said . &quot; It is just the appellate judges who seem to be balking. &quot; It is believed that prosecutors in the Simpson case are relying_on both methods as well as on conventional serology , a less rigorous blood testing procedure that can measure the odds against two matching samples being from different people to about one in 100 . Only serology tests will be introduced at the preliminary hearing . Ultimately , the admissibility of any DNA test results may boil_down to the credibility of the laboratory used by the prosecution and the statistical methods used to compute the odds of a match . Some attorneys predict the prosecution will win any fight over DNA results because previous court rulings were based on methods that are no longer used . &quot; You go_to a DNA seminar after two years of being away from the stuff , &quot; public_defender Brown said , &quot; and it is all a different world. &quot; Who ' s Who Here is a look_at some of the key people in the preliminiary hearing for O.J.
