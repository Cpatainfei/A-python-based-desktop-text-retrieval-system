   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / LAWRENCE J . MAGID : THE CUTTING_EDGE ; AN EASIER WAY TO OPEN YOUR E-MAIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most people watch more_than one TV network , lots of folks read more_than one newspaper or magazine , and an increasing number subscribe_to more_than one on-line information or electronic_mail service . Trouble is , for each service you join , you get an additional electronic_mail address and , often , the pleasure of installing and learning a new piece of software . It can be a hassle . Each day , to be certain that I get all my e-mail , I have to log_on to America Online , MCI Mail , CompuServe , Prodigy , Netcom ( an Internet provider ) and a_couple_of private e-mail services . Sometimes I log_on several times a day . There is a partial solution . E-Mail Connection , a $ 49.95 Windows program from ConnectSoft ( ( 800 ) 234-9497 ) , automatically sends and receives mail from MCI Mail , CompuServe and Prodigy , as well as several local network-based mail systems , including Microsoft Mail , cc : Mail , Lotus Notes and Novell Netware MHS . The software sequentially dials into each service , letting you check and send all your mail with a single click of the mouse . You can log_on manually or have the software automatically log_on at specified intervals , and it runs in the background so you can use your PC for other tasks while it ' s working . When it ' s done , all your e-mail is presented in a single in-box . The return_address of everyone who writes to you is automatically entered into the program ' s address book . Sending mail is also easy . You write the message in a word-processor-like text_editor . Or you can use your regular Windows word_processing program , which , in many cases , can be linked directly to E-Mail Connection so you can send the message directly from your word_processor . Before you can send a message , you have to be sure the person is in your address book . Because all major e-mail services are connected via the Internet , your respondents don ' t have to subscribe_to the same service as you . The software figures_out the best route and writes in the routing codes for you . LAN-based mail is automatically sent over the network . In addition to text messages , E-Mail Connection lets you send and receive any type of file , including spreadsheets , documents , graphics and even programs . Be warned : Some files are quite large and can be costly to send . Sending commercial software via e-mail , in most cases , may be construed as pirating . Sending non-text files over the Internet requires special software -- Uuencode and Uudecode -- which you can download , for free , over the Internet . E-Mail Connection also makes_it possible to receive messages via one service and respond via another . MCI Mail , for example , doesn ' t charge for incoming messages but , in its basic plan , charges a minimum of 50 cents for an outgoing message . CompuServe , which lets you exchange mail with MCI Mail users , charges only 15 cents for an outgoing message , so when I get incoming mail via MCI Mail , I use E-Mail Connection ' s routing feature to have the response sent via CompuServe . E-Mail Connection has some_other neat features , even if you use only one on-line service . The software stores all incoming and outgoing messages on your hard_disk and allows you to sort the messages into various folders , much like the neat Pine program for e-mail on the Internet . You can even establish rules to have it automatically route messages from your in-box to special folders . I ' ve created a list of high-priority respondents that go_into a special folder . I have other folders for special projects or groups of people I correspond with . Press_releases relevant to articles I ' m working_on go_into yet other folders . It takes only a second to move my junk e-mail into the trash folder . The software also has a search feature that lets you quickly find mail that contains a specific text string or the name or e-mail address of any person . Prodigy subscribers will need the service ' s Windows software to use E-Mail connection . CompuServe and MCI Mail users don ' t need any other software , but E-Mail Connection can be used only for mail . It won ' t provide news , forums or other services . Unfortunately , E-Mail Connection doesn ' t let you connect with any of the low-cost Internet e-mail providers , which , like Netcom , offer unlimited e-mail for as little as $ 17.50 a month . That , however , is likely to change by the end of the year .</TEXT>
