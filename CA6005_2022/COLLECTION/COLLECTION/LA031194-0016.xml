   <HEADLINE> HOME TECH / LASER BIN : THE MUMMY ' S REVENGE : A MONSTROUS COLLECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You can get a head_start on dear old Mummy ' s Day with MCA / Universal ' s latest dip_into its horror-film vaults : &quot; The Mummy Collection &quot; ( $ 100 ) . The four-film set unearths the 1940s ' &quot; Mummy &quot; series that proved to be among the studio ' s favorite monsters : &quot; The Mummy ' s Hand , &quot; &quot; The Mummy ' s Ghost , &quot; &quot; The Mummy ' s Tomb &quot; and &quot; The Mummy ' s Curse. &quot; The films were all low-budget quickies made between 1940 and 1944 . ( The original 1932 &quot; The Mummy , &quot; starring Boris Karloff , which set the standard , is also available separately on laser from MCA , at $ 35. ) The new three-disc collection comes complete with a six-page full-color brochure that includes informative liner notes on each film , plus chapter stops . Supplemental material -- theatrical trailers and production stills -- come at the end of Sides 3 and 6 , each covering the two films preceding them . The &quot; Mummy &quot; films unwrap sequentially , beginning with the best of the four , &quot; The Mummy ' s Hand , &quot; from 1940 , shot in two weeks for $ 80 # 000 , directed by Christy Cabanne and written by Griffin Jay and Maxwell Shane . The film_stars cowboy Tom Tyler and features George Zucco as the High_Priest . &quot; The Mummy ' s Tomb &quot; ( 1942 ) introduces Lon Chaney Jr . as the monster and co-stars Elyse Knox . &quot; The Scarlet_Pimpernel ' s &quot; Harold Young directs . Chaney reports that he &quot; didn ' t like the part at all . There wasn ' t anything you could do with the Mummy . You just got_into the makeup and bandages and walked_around dragging your leg. &quot; Looking_at these films , you have to agree with him . Good contract player that he was , Chaney dragged his leg around again in 1944 ' s &quot; The Mummy ' s Ghost. &quot; Arguably the least of the series , it features an over-the-top John Carradine , which director Reginald LeBorg says he allowed because &quot; Carradine ' s voice was sonorous and excellent , much better than the average actor ' s , so I let him go_on . In a picture like that , you can be a little hammy. &quot; &quot; The Mummy ' s Curse , &quot; also released in 1944 , was the last chapter in the series , once more featuring Chaney , this time with Virginia Christine ( later finding TV fame as Folger ' s Mrs . Olson ) . The setting of this one is , of all places , the Louisiana bayou . The novelty of the location helps a little . If all this whets your appetite for more monster movie lore , check_out MCA ' s new release of &quot; Man of a_Thousand Faces &quot; ( letterboxed , $ 40 ) . The 1957 film_stars no less than James Cagney as Lon Chaney Sr. , the silent film actor who set the standards for monster portrayals . Directed by Joseph Pevney , and featuring Jane Greer , Dorothy Malone , Jack Albertson and Marjorie Rambeau , this is one of those rare_birds : a well-done biopic that does_justice to its famous subject . Three other recent releases reveal , once more , that laser technology can sometimes enhance watching films at_home but can ' t improve bad stories : &quot; Demolition Man &quot; ( Warner Home Video , letterboxed , $ 35 ) , starring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes , comes_with full-bodied wrap-around sound that magnifies the mayhem , and surprisingly wide banding for a film made in the 1990s ; &quot; The Man Without a Face &quot; ( Warner , letterboxed , $ 35 ) , the quietly affecting 1993 film starring and directed by Mel Gibson as a disfigured loner befriended by a lonely young boy , transfers well with relatively narrow banding , but even state-of-the-art laser technology can ' t help 1993 ' s &quot; For Love or Money &quot; ( MCA , letterboxed , $ 35 ) , the absurd Michael J . Fox romantic comedy in which he plays a concierge with &quot; dreams. &quot; Laserbits New Movies Just Out : &quot; Manhattan Murder Mystery &quot; ( Columbia TriStar , $ 35 ) ; &quot; Much Ado About Nothing &quot; ( Columbia TriStar , $ 35 ) ; &quot; Striking Distance &quot; ( Columbia TriStar , letterboxed , $ 35 ) ; &quot; Son-in-Law &quot; ( Hollywood , $ 40 ) ; &quot; Hot Shots !
