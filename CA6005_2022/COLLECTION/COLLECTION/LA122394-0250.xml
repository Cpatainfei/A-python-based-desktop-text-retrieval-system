   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN ARMY WAVERS ; BOMBS POUND GROZNY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The deputy commander of Russia ' s ground forces resigned Thursday rather than take_over the 12-day-old assault on Chechnya -- a war that reached a bloody apogee with the first daylight bombing of the rebel republic ' s capital . Witnesses in Grozny , the center of Chechen resistance , said they counted at least two_dozen bodies after a day of indiscriminate artillery_fire and bombs that at one point fell every 30 seconds . An American photographer is among the dead . Amid reports of a broad shake-up of the Russian Defense Ministry , the government confirmed that Gen . Eduard A . Vorobyov had refused to take command of the army ' s stalled , dissent-riven campaign to disarm Chechnya ' s few thousand irregular fighters . &quot; This is an act of a general who doesn ' t want to soil his tunic with an immoral deed , &quot; said Sergei Yushenkov , chairman of the Russian Parliament ' s Defense Committee . It was not clear when or if Vorobyov ' s resignation would be accepted , but it was the most serious of many signs of insubordination that have slowed the Kremlin ' s plan to choke_off Grozny with 10 # 000 or more troops . Dissent on the ground has apparently prompted Russia ' s high_command to attack from the air for four days in a row . The result Thursday was the bloodiest since the Russians rolled tanks across their southern border with this tiny Muslim republic Dec . 11 to try to end its three years of self-declared independence . Television images and other reports from Grozny offered scenes of carnage on snow-covered streets . A dead man ' s charred body sat inside his burned car , his hands clutching the wheel . Three corpses , one headless , lay on Red Front Street near the presidential palace beside a truck and four cars wrecked by a single blast . A woman raised her hands in prayer over a dying man in a park as black smoke rose against the horizon . &quot; Who are they trying to kill ? &quot; Larisa Vozlublennaya , a wailing Russian resident of Grozny , asked an Associated Press reporter outside her shattered apartment_building . Several people died when they rushed to witness the damage and help the wounded after an air strike on a residential neighborhood . The plane that had delivered the strike quickly returned and bombed the crowd , journalists reported . Among those killed by the second bomb was Cynthia Elbaum , a 28-year-old free-lance photographer from New York City who was based in Moscow . She was the first journalist to die since the Russian offensive began . While civilians ran_for cover or fled to the countryside , Russian forces were seen edging their artillery guns closer to Grozny , and Chechen fighters were offering little resistance . Chechen antiaircraft_guns , running_low on ammunition or out of it , were reported silent for a second straight day . A Russian government statement , denying witness accounts on the ground , insisted that Russian planes did not bomb Grozny . It claimed that Chechen fighters were simulating air_attacks by blowing_up their own buildings . Gen . Dzhokar M . Dudayev , the Chechen president , appeared on television to denounce &quot; the Satanic methods of Russia. &quot; He repeated his offer to negotiate with the Kremlin &quot; without preconditions &quot; but added : &quot; It is better to die in a holy war than be turned_into a slave. &quot; As outrage against the bombings mounted in Russia , President Boris N . Yeltsin rejected an appeal_to appear Saturday before a joint session of Parliament . The Itar-Tass news_agency said he was working_on a peace proposal and would address the nation within a_few days . The offensive , Moscow ' s largest since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan 15 years ago , has divided the government and the armed forces . Opinion polls report most Russians oppose it . Support outside official circles has come mainly from the ultranationalist right . Despite its overwhelming numbers and the disorganization of Chechen resistance , the Russian army is wavering . At least one field commander has refused to advance on Grozny . Others have criticized the hastily assembled campaign for its poor coordination among army , airborne and Interior Ministry units whose officers had never before worked together . Sixty Russian soldiers have died in the fighting , according to Russian television . The government denied reports by Tass and the RIA news_agency , which have privileged access to military_headquarters , that Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev had taken personal command of the offensive and dismissed five senior generals , including his top deputy , Georgy Kondratyev . Grachev was in the Russian city of Mozdok , the operation headquarters , reportedly meeting with three of the officers he did or did not fire : Alexei Mityukhin , Vladimir Chirindin and Vladimir Potapov -- the top leadership of the North Caucasus Military District , which has been running the war . Pavel Felgenhauer , well-informed defense correspondent for the Moscow newspaper Sevodnya , said he could not confirm the dismissals but commented that the war is entering a critical phase . &quot; The motley Chechen units , which do not have any knowledge of modern warfare , and the Russian army , which does not really want to fight , have come_together for the battle for Grozny , and no one can tell what will come of it , &quot; he wrote . &quot; After a long sequence of defeats and humiliations , beginning in Afghanistan , the Russian army has reached a point where it might simply refuse to obey orders. &quot;</TEXT>
