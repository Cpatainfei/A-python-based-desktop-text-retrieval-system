   <HEADLINE> MEN OF STEEL ; IRONWORKERS FIXING FREEWAYS ENDURE FATIGUE OF GRUELING HOURS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s midnight in the shadows of a deserted freeway underpass and ironworker Fred ( Coco ) Smith is slouched behind the wheel of his Buick Riviera -- waiting to report to work for the 30th consecutive day , talking in a trance-like voice about what it ' s like to be drop-dead , running-on-empty tired . &quot; You feel_like you ' re already dead , &quot; he is saying , his fingers lazily wandering the radio dial for a bit of the blues . &quot; Your eyes have cement shades and you ' re so sluggish . Your feet weigh 1 # 000 pounds each , like you ' re walking underwater. &quot; Since January ' s massive Northridge earthquake toppled numerous freeway spans across Los Angeles , crews of bleary-eyed construction workers have labored literally around the clock to put those concrete and steel Humpty Dumpties back together again -- enduring a fatigue factor that has ground them down like a car engine without oil , making them sweaty , zombie-like strangers to their own wives and children . For Smith , a 42-year-old father of three who has spent a quarter of a century as an ironworker , the disaster has meant 12 successive weeks of pulling a grueling shift known as a 7-10 -- working seven days a week , 10 hours a day -- first at the Santa Monica Freeway and now rebuilding the Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange . From midnight to 10 a.m. -- day after day , 70 hours a week , in the rain and wind and darkness -- Smith and a tightknit crew of 15 other Local 416 union ironworkers have pulled the second leg of a nightmarish graveyard_shift that has shaken their once-stable family lives worse than any earthquake . Now they find themselves grouchy with their wives and children -- that ' s when they get_to see them . They have become absentee heads of_their_own households , forsaking responsibilities at their local churches , community groups , back yards and bedrooms . Because , like Smith , these men in yellow hard_hats and protective gloves are obsessed with just two things : work and sleep -- fantasizing about sleep while on_the_job and dreaming of work during their fitful daytime slumbers . After working sometimes 40 days in a row , their eyelids buckle as though supporting two gigantic construction cranes . At times , Smith ' s steadily growing fatigue has caused him to fall_asleep at the wheel of his car during the daily 42-mile drive_back home to Whittier . Some mornings , he plays a game of &quot; driving-by-Braille , &quot; dozing at the wheel until the clunka-clunka-clunka of his tires hitting the rounded , plastic lane dividers lurches him back to consciousness . On the job , such weariness has strangely created a bond among the 15 men who work with Smith on the overnight crew as they mold strands of iron &quot; rebar &quot; into support structures for the soon-to-be-erected freeway bridge . &quot; When we see a guy slacking_off or complaining about the job , we ' ll yell at him , &quot; Smith says . &quot; we ' ll use bad language . we ' ll tell the guy to quit sniveling , to go_home if he can ' t do the job . Nobody wants to hear his complaints . We ' re ironworkers , like we say , ' rough and tough , hard to bluff , mean as a red-assed spider. ' &quot; Indeed , there is a sense of pride , a sense of blue-collar machismo , being part of this bridge construction job . These men know the public is looking over their shoulder , waiting for their freeway to be delivered back to them later this year , but at_the_same_time wanting the job done right , ready to accept no excuses for slipshod workmanship . Recently , the owner of Tri-City Reinforcement handed_out T-shirts bearing the Interstate 10 logo of the Santa Monica Freeway , along with the words &quot; I was there. &quot; The workers flocked around the shirts like birds_of_prey , holding them up proudly . &quot; In our business , it stands_for something , that fact that you worked_on these projects , &quot; Smith says . &quot; Because when ironworkers get_together , they tell tales . And this job is the biggest tale of them all. &quot; Ironworker Jimmy Phillips , another member of the night crew , feels as though the Golden State Freeway job has simultaneously plopped his big steel-toed construction boots into both heaven and hell . He feels_like some oil worker on special duty in far-flung Alaska , making more money than he ever dreamed possible -- grossing as much as $ 2 # 500 a week before taxes -- but laboring such long hours that he has no time to spend it . It is a construction worker ' s Catch-22 : While they are free to take a day_off anytime they wish , most feel the money is just too good to pass_up in their on-again , off-again industry where yearlong layoffs are commonplace . &quot; I have no social life , none at all , &quot; says a brooding Phillips . &quot; Like today , I mowed the lawn and then fell right into bed , dead tired . Ever so often , you have to take a_couple_of days_off . It ' s not only for your body , but for your mind . And for your family too. &quot; These days Phillips doesn ' t even have time for his duties as church deacon and leader of the Sunday_school at Little Zion Baptist_Church in Compton . &quot; I haven ' t been to church for three weeks , &quot; he says with a sigh . &quot; People have called to ask if there ' s a problem . This job has changed my whole sense of being . I mean , I am but I ain ' t , you know what I mean ? Nobody sees me anymore . My spiritual life has been banished. &quot; While he knows the money is good , Phillips is ever-watchful for signs of stress at_home with wife , Terrlyn , and 16-year-old daughter , Tanisha . &quot; My daughter is a teen-ager and she ' s facing a lot of peer pressure at school . And I ' m not there at_home to sit with her after dinner and let her know that peer pressure is part of growing_up . I ' m up in bed sleeping. &quot; Sleeping , that is , without his wife . &quot; I sleep all day when my wife is at_work . And she hates being alone at night . It ' s her biggest complaint . Now she sleeps_with a night light on at_home because I ' m not there . We ' ve just been married for five years and the honeymoon isn ' t over yet . &quot; At night , I want to be at_home in bed with Terrlyn -- not out here hauling around iron poles heavy enough to kill a man. &quot; For these men , the job site resembles some hostile planet , a surreal place of moving metal and foreign objects , where one wrong move can mean death or serious injury . It ' s a strange industrial city carved into the side of a hill , where the once-busy lanes of an old freeway now set the stage for a new behemoth , a new iron and steel bridge to the city . The scene is back-lit by huge work lamps that can blind a man , make him feel_like a scared animal caught in the flood of some highway headlights . It ' s an atmosphere filled by the maddening whir and groan of heavy machinery -- pay loaders and long-necked cranes that are like lumbering prehistorics , dwarfing solitary workers . &quot; You ' ve got_to keep_on your toes here , &quot; Smith says . &quot; Because these crane operators can ' t always see you . You get lost in the shadows of these big lights . It ' s just plain dangerous. &quot; Night after night , the task of these ironworkers is to fasten bars of raw iron together into circular columns resembling gigantic Slinkys that will become the foundation of the towering bridge span . At night , the half-built iron-ribbed columns stand straight up in the darkness , looking_like eerie towers from the Emerald City . The crew boss is a Mighty Mouse of a man named Steve Pinder , a superior with a ponytail , earring and a wiry beard that sticks straight out like after an explosion , or in those old photographs of Civil War soldiers . The men call him &quot; Cowboy &quot; because of his Western hat , and his voice is hoarse because he ' s always yelling over the roar of the machines . Working together in groups of three or four , Cowboy ' s laborers hoist 2 3 / 4-inch-diameter iron bars weighing 1 # 500 pounds or more -- staggering under the weight like drunken men , always watchful for the moving monster machinery that pass inches away . Their finished product is placed into gaping holes 100 feet deep , plugged up by an ocean of concrete . At one such hole , roped_off by yellow security tape like some gruesome crime scene , a worker peered into the blackness . &quot; It looks_like the gates of hell , &quot; he said . &quot; Sometimes , this place gives me the creeps. &quot; Danger lurks here . Recently , one ironworker suffered a serious back injury when an unsupported column fell on top of him . His co-workers , many of whom have taken_up a collection on his behalf , say it ' s doubtful he ' ll ever return to work . &quot; I don ' t think it was the fatigue , &quot; ironworker Dean Brasher said of the mishap . &quot; Accidents just happen in an inhospitable place like this. &quot; Rick Rice , a spokesman for the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration , said that the agency is investigating the incident and that it ' s still too early to say if worker fatigue was involved . While the agency has no standards that would force a laborer to stop work because of exhaustion , Rice said common_sense should prevail at freeway construction sites , which are considered hazardous workplaces , Cal-OSHA ' s most-severe rating . &quot; Certainly , there is a potential for problems if people work long hours over a long period_of_time , &quot; he said . &quot; But you have to weigh that against an individual ' s right to control his own destiny. &quot; Sometimes , ironworkers say , the pace of work takes its toll . Divorce rates among workers are high . And several have walked_off the Antelope Valley Freeway job because of the demanding conditions and hours . &quot; For me , the money just wasn ' t worth it , &quot; said Brasher , who recently left the site with another worker . &quot; My family is more important to me than money . And that job just wore_on you after awhile. &quot; Indeed , construction work weighs heavy at_home as well as on_the_job . &quot; We ' ve given him up_to his job , &quot; Diane Pinder says about her husband , Steve . &quot; We know it won ' t last forever , so we take it while we can. &quot; Hardest hit , Diane says , has been their 8-year-old daughter , Brandy . &quot; For her , it ' s confusing . She and her dad don ' t play as much backgammon as they used to . She ' s constantly asking , ' How come daddy ' s not home ? ' ' How come he ' s going_to_bed in the middle of the day ? ' Or just , ' Where ' s Daddy ? ' &quot; Fred Smith has also sacrificed his home life . Instead of being a father who likes to attend his daughter ' s softball_games or take his girls shopping , he has become a modern-day Rip_Van_Winkle . &quot; Dad tries to do all_the things he used to do , &quot; says 17-year-old Andrea Smith . &quot; But he can ' t . He ' s too tired . When he drives , his eyes always get real heavy . I say , ' Dad , maybe we should go_home and go_to sleep. ' &quot;</TEXT>
