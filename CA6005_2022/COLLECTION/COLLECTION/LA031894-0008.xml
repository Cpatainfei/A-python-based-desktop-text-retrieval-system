   <TEXT> * Re &quot; Why ' Three Strikes ' May Take California for a Ride , &quot; editorial , March 13 : It never ceases to amaze me how the left just can ' t get the message of the &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; bill . The overwhelming majority of the population doesn ' t care if it fails to deter crime . They don ' t care that &quot; 50-cent felons &quot; are going_to jail for life . And they don ' t care about the so-called Law of Unintended Consequences . What the public does care about is keeping dangerous felons off the streets for good . Is the new law perfect ? No . But is it better than endless negotiation and discussion in the state Legislature by a group of politicians who seem to be more concerned about criminals ' rights than the rights of the criminals ' victims and families ? Yes . STEVEN ZELMAN Manhattan Beach * The sick irony of your editorial is that it ' s The Times that ' s been taking its readers for a ride for years . Your half-truth that one of the first felons to be charged under the law allegedly wrested 50 cents from a homeless man irresponsibly omitted the fact that the criminal had a rap sheet 52 pages long . How much have those apprehensions and legal costs amounted to already , to say nothing of the tragic cost to victims ? As for your fears that life imprisonment for first-time rapists and child_molesters would be unjust , inappropriate and too costly , where have you been ? Did you miss all_the studies that invariably show these creeps never stop at one incident ? If your misplaced pity still lies_with the perpetrators , do you think the police work and interminable trials incurred by these heinous acts are free ? BEVERLY DELOTT Pacific Palisades * There are a_couple_of things having to do with the &quot; three strikes &quot; law that I just don ' t seem to understand . Instead of lawyers advising their clients to go_to trial rather than plea bargain , because a plea bargain will count as a conviction , and therefore be a &quot; strike &quot; against them , why don ' t they advise them to take the plea bargain and then not commit any more felonies ? The other source of mystery is why some people seem to think that the law should only apply to violent felons . Persons who view others in society as potential victims of their violence or as suckers to be fleeced are both contemptible . Both ways of thinking can and do cause enormous harm . BRUCE IRWIN West Hollywood * With crime becoming our No . 2 pastime it behooves us not to get too carried_away by &quot; three strikes and you ' re out. &quot; After all , our No . 1 national pastime , baseball , gives you extra chances in case of &quot; foul balls. &quot; WILLIAM KRAUSE Palm Springs * Concerning Sherry Jeffe ' s &quot; three strikes &quot; article ( Opinion , March 13 ) : What is so wrong with California ' s legislators being responsive to the desires of their constituency ? It is a sad indictment of our legislative process that the people have to scream so loudly to effect any real change . Yes , three strikes will be expensive . And yes , state representatives will have to make some very difficult decisions on how to finance this new legislation , but the task of providing safe city streets for law-abiding citizens of our state is perhaps the most fundamental duty of our public sector .
