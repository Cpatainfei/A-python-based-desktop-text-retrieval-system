   <HEADLINE> BURIAL BENEFIT FOR RESERVISTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Re &quot; Another Perk for the Military , Forevermore , &quot; Column Left , May 17 : As Colman McCarthy sits comfortably in his home tonight , he would do_well to thank the National_Guard and Reserve personnel who have put their lives on the line so that he can do so . Amazement . That was my reaction , and I suspect the reaction of most others who read McCarthy ' s column begrudging those who have served their country in uniform for 20 or more years a dignified burial in one of our 114 national cemeteries . Perhaps it was the heat of deadline that prompted him to rail against such a justifiable measure or perhaps it is because he is one of the misinformed who still believes reservists are nothing more_than &quot; weekend warriors. &quot; The truth is that the United States cannot go_into any level of conflict without the National_Guard and Reserves . They account_for 44 % of the Army ' s combat power ( soon to be 54 % ) and 62 % of the tactical airlift . To call reservists ' service &quot; meaningless &quot; is an affront to every person in uniform . Was it &quot; meaningless &quot; when the Reserves , as part of the total force , responded to Iraqi aggression in the Persian_Gulf ? Was it &quot; meaningless &quot; when they left_behind their families to fight in the brutal climate of Korea , the jungles of Vietnam and in the Pacific and European theaters of World_War_II ? Is it &quot; meaningless &quot; when they put their lives on hold to keep order and provide humanitarian aid during hurricanes , floods , riots and other national emergencies ? The new statute will result in less than 500 additional burials annually . What is important is that these reservists have earned the right to be laid_to_rest in a national cemetery . REP . G.V. ( SONNY ) MONTGOMERY Chairman , Committee on Veterans ' Affairs D-Miss . * It was disappointing to read McCarthy ' s complaints about the benefits given to military reservists . He seems to think that reserve duty is &quot; easy. &quot; Apparently he has never seen a reservist inside a tank when the temperature is 117 degrees ( tanks , contrary to the popular myth , are not air-conditioned ) . Apparently he seems to think that what we do is &quot; meaningless. &quot; Was our service &quot; meaningless &quot; when the reserves were needed in the Gulf War ? Over the past several years California reservists and guardsmen were called_up for floods , wildfires , riots and even sent to war . He claims that we see our service in the Guard and Reserves merely as an income supplement . I am asked to &quot; donate &quot; my time to the extent that I am paid_for less than half the time I actually spend in uniform . Every time my unit has been mobilized I have had to contend with a reduced income , as my military pay is much lower than my civilian salary . In complaining about the burial benefits for reservists , McCarthy is ignoring the large_numbers of reservists and guardsmen who are presently interred in the national cemeteries after dying in combat . STAFF SGT . COLIN CAMPBELL California Army National_Guard Altadena * McCarthy ' s article is petty and small-minded . He not only exaggerates the extent of benefits afforded anyone in the armed forces but ignores the requisite level of sacrifice and commitment . With the 50th anniversary of D-day fast approaching , we should be looking_for more ways to honor those few who were , and are , willing to give of themselves in the service of their country .
