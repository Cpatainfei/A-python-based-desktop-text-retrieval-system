   <TEXT> Israel will begin this week reopening Gaza Strip border crossings that were sealed after the deadly bombing of a Tel Aviv bus , Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Sunday . But he promised to do &quot; whatever is needed &quot; to stop violence by Palestinian militants . About 30 # 000 Palestinians who live_in the PLO-run Gaza Strip have been unable to get_to their jobs in Israel since Israel closed the borders in response to the Oct . 19 bus bombing that killed 23 people . Rabin met for an hour in Casablanca on Sunday with Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat before the opening of a Middle_East and North African summit aimed at promoting economic development in the region . It was their first meeting since the Tel Aviv bombing and the signing of the Israel-Jordan peace_treaty , which Arafat has strongly criticized . The Palestinians had demanded a complete and immediate reopening of the Gaza crossings . Rabin said he told Arafat that , starting Tuesday , &quot; we gradually will lift the closure. &quot; In addition , Palestinian officers will be allowed to take_up positions at two border crossings , the Allenby Bridge between Jordan and the West_Bank , and the Rafah crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip , Rabin said . Rabin said he and Arafat would talk again in a week . A Palestinian source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting would take_place next Monday in Erez , the main Gaza-Israel crossing .</TEXT>
