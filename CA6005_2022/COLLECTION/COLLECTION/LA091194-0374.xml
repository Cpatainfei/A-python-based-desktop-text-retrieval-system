   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI : IRA ERROR DEMANDS FAST ACTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q : Several months ago I transferred my individual_retirement_account from a Puerto Rican bank in California to a well-known mutual_fund . The transfer was completed within the 60-day limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Service . Still , the bank retained 10 % of the funds as a penalty . The mutual_fund representative says I have been treated wrongly . I concur . The bank refuses to cooperate . What can I do ? -- P.A . * A : If the facts are as you have recounted them , our experts say that you have indeed been treated improperly and should move q : uickly to redress the error to insure that you are not further penalized . How should you proceed ? First , you must try to determine why the bank withheld the funds . From your recounting , it would appear that the bank has erroneously imposed a 10 % tax withholding on the transferred funds on the misinformed notion that your moving the account constituted an early withdrawal of IRA funds . This penalty was improperly assessed for two reasons : Taxpayers are entitled to transfer IRA accounts between institutions at least once a year , and any penalties for breaking account-transfer rules are assessed at the time a taxpayer files his or her tax_return . The penalty is not supposed to be assessed at the time of transfer since , theoretically , the institution has no way of knowing if the money is being correctly or improperly transferred or even completely withdrawn . According to Henry Ross of the Puerto Rican economic development administration , the bank with which you are dealing is subject_to the tax laws of the United States because it is operating in a branch office in this country . Further , you are subject_to U.S. tax laws as a resident and citizen of the United States . However , if you were dealing with a bank located in Puerto Rico and were a resident of that territory , neither you nor the bank would be subject_to U.S. tax laws since they do not apply to residents of territories not entitled to vote_in federal elections . Remember the Revolutionary battle_cry &quot; No taxation without representation &quot; ? It still applies . Although the penalty has already been assessed , you should be able to recover the money -- or at least get a credit for it -- when you file your next federal tax_return . Simply note on the return the payment of this tax and debit that amount from any taxes you owe for the year . The most important thing you can do -- and you must do_it within 60 days of the transfer -- is to make_up the 10 % deducted from your account before it was transferred to the mutual_fund . You will have to do this with funds out of your pocket , but unless you do , you will be trapped in the absurd Catch-22 situation of being accused of prematurely withdrawing the 10 % that was improperly withheld before the transfer was completed . You may , of course , also complain to the highest possible levels of the bank ' s organization . You might even seek the aid of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . consumer counselors ( ( 800 ) 934-3342 ) , who can give you some helpful advice . Virtually all foreign banks doing business in the United States are covered by FDIC insurance and are subject_to FDIC regulations . Inheritance Stays Separate Property * Q : Does a spouse have any right to the other spouse ' s inheritance or monetary gift ? Is the spouse who receives the inheritance or gift free to do as he or she wishes with that money ? -- G.H . * A : Even in community_property states such_as California , inheritances and gifts are considered separate property within the marriage . In addition , income generated from the investment of an inheritance or gift is considered the separate property of the spouse to whom it was given . The exception to this occurs when the separate funds are commingled with community_property accounts . This means that if you receive a gift or inheritance and you want to treat it as your own separate property , you must take_care to deposit it in a separate account from any of the joint accounts you hold with your spouse . Ex-Spouses Entitled to Social_Security * Q : A recent column discussed Social_Security benefits for divorced spouses . I want to know what type of benefits an ex-wife is entitled to receive if her ex-husband has remarried . Would both the ex-wife and the current wife be entitled to benefits ? -- P.D.Q . * A : A divorced spouse is entitled to receive Social_Security benefits accumulated by the ex-spouse if the couple had been married at least 10 years and the primary wage_earner is already drawing benefits . If the wage_earner is still working , the ex-spouse may draw benefits if the couple has been divorced at least two years and the wage_earner is at least age 62 . By the way , the Social_Security_Administration treats ex-husbands and ex-wives equally ; each is entitled to collect on the other ' s benefits under the same rules . Benefits paid to an ex-spouse in no way reduce the amount available to the primary wage_earner and his or her current family . A current spouse is entitled to draw spousal benefits even if a wage_earner has one or more ex-spouses drawing benefits on that account . These are all considered separate payments and an ex-spouse in no way robs a current spouse , or another ex-spouse , of anything . Your question is one of dozens this column routinely receives on Social_Security benefits available to spouses , widows and divorced spouses . Because of that , we have prepared a pamphlet addressing some of those questions . To order a copy , send a check for $ 4.33 ( including tax and postage ) to Times on Demand Publications , P.O. Box 60395 , Los Angeles , CA 90060 . Make checks payable to the Los Angeles Times . Please allow six to eight weeks for delivery . ( A similar pamphlet on 401 ( k ) plans can be ordered from the same address for $ 5.41. ) * Carla Lazzareschi cannot answer mail individually but will respond in this column to financial questions of general interest .</TEXT>
