   <HEADLINE> U.S. PUTS ITS SPIN ON BALL AT KICKOFF OF WORLD CUP ; SOCCER : CLINTON JOINS GERMAN , BOLIVIAN LEADERS AT TOURNEY ' S CHICAGO OPENING . FIRST ROSE BOWL GAME TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States put its star-spangled stamp on the world ' s most popular sports event Friday , opening the World Cup soccer tournament in sizzling style under a broiling sun before a crowd of 63 # 117 that included President Clinton and an array of dignitaries . The opening game , predicted to be a ho-hum blowout matching defending champion Germany -- the powerhouse soccer nation -- and Bolivia , was unexpectedly close . In a testament to the power the sport has to negate such matters as geography and economy , Germany barely beat Bolivia , 1-0 , and it was even closer than the outcome would indicate . Close_calls and unpredictable results are the stuff international sport is made of , and the World Cup offers all that , as well as a healthy dash of nationalism and jingoism . Today , the Rose Bowl in Pasadena will have its first game as Romania and Colombia play_at 4:30 p.m. This World Cup , held_in the United States for the first time , is expected to inject an American freshness into what is for many in this country a sport with foreign traditions . The opening ceremony here Friday hinted that some pizazz was in the wings . Bedecked with ribbons and splashed with the colorful garb of soccer fans , even somber Soldier Field seemed cheerful and sparkling in the sun . The bowl-shaped stadium that sits beside Lake_Michigan became a caldron of the emotion and passion that is so emblematic of soccer . But before the game , spectacle intruded_on sport . Clinton was greeted with a good-natured mixture of cheers and whistles -- the usual irreverence of a sports crowd for politicians . The President spoke_of soccer ' s unifying effect , saying , &quot; The love of soccer is a universal language that brings us together. &quot; He welcomed Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , all dressed formally in dark suits while temperatures were in the 90s . Once the official portion of the festivities gave_way to the pageantry , the restive crowd grew celebratory . The afternoon ' s hostess , Oprah Winfrey , set_up the day ' s best unintentional pun when she said , &quot; Chicago warmly welcomes you. &quot; The comment drew attention to the blistering temperature and stifling humidity . The weather was unable to put a damper on the parade of national_flags and dances representing the tournament ' s 24 teams . Bolivia and Germany were greeted loudly , as expected , but Mexico also drew marked cheers . The United States was introduced as a squad of spandex-clad dancers lunged around the stage . It was all very festive , which was the anticipated reaction when , on July 4 , 1988 , the United States was awarded the right to play host to the 15th World Cup . Soccer officials hope that soccer can conquer North_America , a region with a noted indifference to the sport . More_than 145 nations have spent the last 18 months in regional qualifying for the quadrennial event , regarded_as the largest single sporting event in the world . The 24 qualified teams are playing 52 games in nine cities throughout the next four weeks . The Los Angeles area will get a heavy dose of the World Cup -- eight of the tournament ' s games , including the final July 17 at the Rose Bowl . A $ 3-million face_lift has transformed the venerable 72-year-old Pasadena landmark into a colorful venue that will serve as &quot; home &quot; to the U.S. team , which plays there June 22 against Colombia and June 26 against Romania . The United States will play its first game today against Switzerland in the Silverdome at Pontiac , Mich . The United States is playing in Group_A ; the tournament is organized into six groups of four teams . Each team plays three games in the first round , and the top 16 teams will advance to the next round . Three points are given for a victory and one for a tie . * RELATED STORIES : B1 , C1 , C8-13 , D1</TEXT>
