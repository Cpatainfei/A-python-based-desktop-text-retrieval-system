   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY : SETTING THE PACE ; ABC ' S BOBBY UNSER &amp; CO . REV_UP THEIR COMMENTARY FOR THE 78TH INDY 500</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is nothing tape-delayed about Bobby Unser . After 13 years of retirement from IndyCar racing , the 57-year-old Hall_of_Fame driver still enjoys a live show . His body may be confined to the broadcast booth for Sunday ' s 78th Indianapolis 500 on ABC , but his heart is strapped in behind the wheel and the accelerator is pressed to the floor . Unser and the network ' s sports department have mutual admiration for each other , especially on Memorial_Day . Executive producer Jack O ' Hara says Unser is &quot; terrific &quot; and &quot; extremely knowledgeable_about the machinery , the drivers and the teams. &quot; His &quot; offbeat and irreverent &quot; style adds_to the broadcast . Televising the 500 live suits Unser . &quot; Being a race_car driver you had no excuses . It was your day to perform . Doing_it ( the broadcast ) live was like racing to me . I could add a whole_lot more to the show. &quot; This is Unser ' s eighth year working for ABC . The three-time Indianapolis 500 champion will be in a sky booth at Turn 2 of the Speedway . In Turn 4 will be former 500 champion Danny Sullivan . O ' Hara says placing announcers in different locations allows television to follow the race around the 2 1 / 2-mile oval course . &quot; We got the idea from radio , &quot; O ' Hara says . &quot; A car may be running fine coming_out of Turn 2 , but by the time it gets_to Turn 4 it may_not be running so good . It allows us to do commentary all_the way around the track. &quot; There also will be a camera in six of the cars . Paul Page and Sam Posey will call the race , which the network is carrying live for the ninth straight year . Jack Arute , Gary Gerould and Dr. Jerry Punch will report from the_pits . Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil is the defending champion . The speeds and technology at Indianapolis have rocketed since Unser last climbed out of a Roger Penske-owned car in 1981 . Unser , who describes himself as a &quot; charger , &quot; says in a phone interview from his home_in Albuquerque . N.M. , &quot; I was known for being a qualifier . I charged flat-out. &quot; An aggressiveness that put more_than one car on a speedway wall accented Unser ' s IndyCar career , which began in 1963 when he qualified Andy Granatelli ' s V-8 Novi . Unser won 35 races , fourth on the all-time list . &quot; I am an expert , an authority . That doesn ' t mean I ' ve always been right . Nobody can call a race like Paul ( Page ) , but he ' s not really a racer . I am an expert and the audience is going_to believe what I say . And if I say something that ' s wrong , they ' ll forgive me. &quot; Unser began doing commentary on TV in 1975 at the first Long_Beach Grand Prix while he was recovering from a race-related injury . &quot; A broken leg had laid me up for a little while , &quot; he says , &quot; and CBS gave me a holler. &quot; At first he didn ' t want to do_it , but CBS announcer Ken Squier , a good friend , called and persuaded him to give_it_a_try . &quot; I had no idea what TV was like . No idea . My leg was in a fresh cast but I didn ' t want everybody to think I was a sissy , so I went . I was popping pain_pills during the race . CBS asked me back the next year and that got the ball rolling . &quot; Then I went_to NBC where they did a lot of tape-delayed racing and at_the_same_time I was learning more about TV . Then ABC began doing a live show , and I got more respect for TV. &quot; Unser said he believes ABC ' s Indy coverage has improved since it went live . &quot; They ' ve got a better idea of what do do . For example , the graphics are better and the pre-race show is a piece of art. &quot; Between Indy stints and other ABC-televised races , Unser keeps so busy doing endorsements , commercials and training films for various companies that he ' s only home 40 to 60 days a year . Does he miss racing ? &quot; Of course I do. &quot; But he gets his fix , as he calls it , by driving with his son , Robby , in the Pikes Peak Hill Climb , an event that Unser won a record 13 times , including in 1986 , when he set a speed record in the rally division . Robby Unser has won Pikes Peak four times . &quot; It ' s nice engineering and driving_in a race with my son that I won 13 times , &quot; he says . &quot; That fixes my need . I ' m still a race driver. &quot; Which auto racing fans definitely know when they hear his commentary Sunday . ABC ' s coverage of the Indian a polis 500 at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway begins Sunday at 8 a.m. UNSER UTTERANCES The never-bashful Bobby Unser doesn ' t hold_back his opinions , whether they ' re of the Indianapolis 500 , IndyCar racing or his own racing family . Some off-the-cuff observations : On the ever-increasing speeds , now closing_in on an average of 230 m.p.h. at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway : &quot; The cars are going too fast , but the safety has stayed ahead of the speeds . The cars today are safer than ever. &quot; On the technology : &quot; The cars and the racing are too costly . The cost can be reduced by half . With the electronics and computers in the cars , the fans don ' t appreciate all that and they shouldn ' t . They don ' t care about the computers and electronics . The fans want to see the race. &quot; On the influx of foreign , and especially European , drivers in IndyCar racing : &quot; It needs heroes , like the ones in sprint cars and NASCAR . The fans want heroes and they ' re fewer and fewer in the U.S. A lot of the drivers ' names they can ' t pronounce . Only a_few have a chance to win . The rest are ' pay drivers , ' the ones rich enough to pay their way into the race. &quot; On his nephew Al Unser Jr. : &quot; Little Al is similar to his dad . He ' s picked_up his dad ' s habits and traits and he ' s very capable of winning . He stays competitive in the race and in the last third of the race he is pure hell. &quot; On his role as an auto-racing analyst : &quot; I enjoy it an awful lot . I spend a lot of time preparing ahead of time . Part of it is evaluating the new cars that are already set_in place . For example , in Australia , we looked_at the Honda engine . The Ford-Cosworth . The overhead cam vs . the pushrod . What is Chevy going_to do ? The different teams ... Penske . Then there are the chassis .
