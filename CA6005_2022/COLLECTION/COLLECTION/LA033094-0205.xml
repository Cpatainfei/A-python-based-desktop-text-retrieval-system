   <HEADLINE> SERBS , CROATS AGREE TO RENEW CEASE-FIRE ; BALKANS : HAGGLING OVER KRAJINA REGION INDICATES OVERALL TRUCE IS FAR OFF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Serbian rebels and the Croatian government early today agreed to renew a flagging cease-fire to pull_back troops and artillery in their suspended war for control of the contested Krajina region . The agreement came_after nearly 18 hours of talks at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb , the Associated Press reported . The haggling over what will be largely a symbolic first_step toward reuniting ethnically divided Croatia indicated that an overall peace settlement remains far off . The cease-fire is to take_effect at 9 a.m. local_time Monday . U.S. and Russian diplomats mediating the talks between the Balkan war ' s original adversaries had pushed hard for the truce in hopes of adding_to the momentum that has halted the shelling of Sarajevo and reunited Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina . While the two sides -- which have waged an on-again , off-again battle for the disputed Krajina region -- formally signed the truce , first proclaimed more_than two years ago , both held_fast to intransigent positions that virtually exclude a peaceful conclusion . Earlier , Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said that he will resort_to a military offensive if the current U.S.-Russian diplomatic effort fails to restore his rule over Krajina . He contended he would have the support of the international community to do so . &quot; If they fail to agree , Croatia , in accordance with the relevant ( U.N. ) Security_Council resolutions concerning the integrity of its territory , could resort_to other means , and in that case it would have_on its side the rest of the world , &quot; Tudjman said of the Serbian rebels who have seized one-third of this country . Asked if by &quot; other means &quot; he was alluding to armed forces to recover Serb-held territory , Tudjman replied , &quot; Ultimately , yes. &quot; He also took pains to identify Croatia ' s 600 # 000 Serbs as a minority with fewer rights than the Croatian majority and no claim to territorial autonomy from Zagreb . For their part , the Serbs showed_up in the military_uniforms of their self-proclaimed independent Republic of Serbian Krajina to underscore their refusal to be considered any part of Croatia . They also insisted on poring over each of 34 detailed maps of the proposed U.N. deployment areas , arguing over every inch of the cease-fire line in apparent expectation that it would eventually become the permanent boundary of their rogue state . Krajina ' s Serbs are plagued by infighting . But all rebel factions support independence and eventual inclusion of their captured territory in a Greater Serbia . The detailed marking-off of the current confrontation lines was meant to provide a starting point from which both sides could pull_back their troops by 1 # 000 yards and their heavy artillery by six miles . But there is little muscle in the agreement wrestled out of the reluctant parties . That leads some observers to fear that neither side will make much effort to abide_by the withdrawal provisions . The cease-fire and separation of forces are aimed at providing breathing space for two more crucial phases of negotiations . Mediators from the United States , Russia , the 12-nation European Union and the United Nations next want the combatants to restore transport and telecommunications links to build confidence between the rival communities . They then hope to work_out a political settlement that would return Serb-held areas to Croatian government control , in exchange for some degree of autonomy for the Serbs . Serbs rebelled against Croatia ' s June , 1991 , declaration_of_independence from Yugoslavia and seized one-third of the country in a six-month war that was put_on hold_in January , 1992 , by a U.N.-mediated cease-fire . More_than 14 # 000 U.N. troops have been deployed to the contested region .</TEXT>
