   <HEADLINE> ECONOMIC CHANGE IS COMING TO CUBA -- BUT HOW RADICAL ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beside the pools of Havana ' s new hotels , the ice_cubes tinkle in exotic cocktails ; beggars follow foreign tourists in the streets outside . Thirty-five years after Fidel Cas tro came_to power , Cuba is coming_out of the deep_freeze . For now , the changes are small , but like the first faint breezes of an approaching hurricane , they are the harbingers of a storm that will reshape Cuba ' s political and social realities and create a major foreign-policy crisis for the United States . The big news isn ' t that the Cuban government has announced some economic changes -- reopening the free farmers ' markets and moving toward free markets in certain other goods . These are baby steps_on the road to reform . The real news is who is behind these changes -- and why . Well-informed Cubans with personal ties to the highest levels of the island ' s leadership agree : Fidel ' s powerful brother , Raul , is behind these latest reforms and , behind him , stand the Cuban armed forces . Badly shaken by the unrest last summer -- the raft exodus and the riots in downtown Havana -- and hurt by the economic_crisis that has forced a 50 % cut_in military salaries , Raul and the top army brass want to solve the crisis and save the system peacefully . Cuba ' s armed forces are increasingly impatient with the blundering political bureaucracy of the civilian government and they dread one thing above all : a situation in which the army will be used to suppress civil unrest . The fears are not unrealistic . Cuba ' s gross_domestic_product has plunged 45 % since 1989 , and basic foods are in short supply . &quot; Why is Castro like an onion ? &quot; runs a popular joke in Havana . Answer : &quot; They both make you cry in the kitchen. &quot; The army ' s idea is to steer Cuba toward the China model of reform -- perestroika without glasnost . A combination of market reforms and enhanced political discipline will , the Army hopes , allow the Cuban economy to recover its dynamism without threatening the Communist_Party and the Castro brothers . It ' s a forlorn_hope beyond a_few officers and technocrats . Few informed Cubans think this can succeed . The U.S. embargo is only part of the reason . As most Cuban economists know , the Cuban market isn ' t big enough , and Cuban producers nowhere near competitive enough , for Cuba to take the Chinese road to development . Even as the armed forces move to implement limited reforms , another group of Cubans is pushing more radical changes . This group -- based in think_tanks , certain ministries and in Cuba ' s small but important group of independent non-party , non-governmental organizations -- is still loyal to what they call &quot; social goals of the revolutionary process &quot; but their vision of a reformed Cuba looks_like a West European social_democracy . This group of reformers -- most too young to remember Castro ' s revolution -- recognizes that Cuba must adjust to the international capitalist_economy . But in a series of conversations with a half-dozen leading members of this new breed of reformers , one message came_through : These Cubans don ' t worry so_much about whether Cuba has a capitalist future as they do about what kind of capitalism Cuba will develop . Will Cuba develop a European style of capitalism -- with an extensive social safety net and a strong economic role for the government ? Many leading Cubans , including well-known members of the Communist_Party , would be happy to settle for this . Will Cuba develop a Korean-style capitalism with less individual freedom , and fewer social benefits than in the European model , but with rapid economic_growth ? This possibility is less attractive to the more democratically minded of Cuban intellectuals , but is acceptable . What virtually nobody in Cuba wants is a return to the Latin_American form of capitalism they experienced in the past . Cubans do not want to import the drug problems , violence and crime that plague so_much of Latin_America ; nor do they want to recreate the immense gulf between rich and poor found in societies like Brazil and the Dominican_Republic . As they try to imagine a new future for Cuba , the new generation of economists and intellectuals is dropping old taboos . Some make the case for a &quot; big bang &quot; market reform on the Polish model . Others are working_out plans to compensate corporations and individuals whose property was confiscated by the Castro government . Public discussion of these radical ideas remains limited , but the continuing economic_crisis forces even conservatives to study alternative ideas . None of this means that Cuba is about to turn_into a Caribbean Sweden . The old revolutionaries , and especially the Castro brothers , still control political life . Moreover , the democratic reformers in their way are as unrealistic as the authoritarian reformers in the armed forces . Cubans may_not want to go_back to Latin-style dependent capitalism , but it is hard to see how they can avoid it . Cuba is a tropic sugar island with few national resources or opportunities . The agricultural products and nickel that Cuba makes are cheap commodities in the world economy . The oil and technologies needs are expensive . Though Cuban citizens are educated far beyond levels achieved in the rest of Latin_America , they know little about such vital subjects as business and management . Finally , 35 years of socialist planning have saddled Cuba with an Eastern European-style legacy of useless factories and worthless state enterprises . Neither Cuba ' s conservatives nor its reformers seem able to admit how grim the situation is . Both groups clutch at straws . The conservatives hope this or that Band-Aid can preserve the essence of Cuban socialism ; reformers look_for some miraculous escape_from the abysmal Cuban economy . Every East European economy fell_into crisis when it introduced reforms . Income fell , unemployment and inflation rose , and social_services decayed faster during the period of reforms than under the last years of socialism . Cuba may_not quite go the way of Ukraine -- for one thing , it has already suffered the shock of losing its access to cheap Soviet oil . But radical reform won ' t be the end of the Cuban economic_crisis . It will merely open a new and more difficult phase_in it . Americans are tempted to be smug about Cuba ' s problems . For 35 years , Castro thumbed his nose at the Colossus of the North . He openly subverted his neighbor , attempting to foster anti-Americanism and communism in a hemisphere Washington thinks it owns . It is satisfying to gloat now , and the State_Department seems to be doing_it . As the Cuban crisis deepens , the United States is tightening the embargo and stepping_up its rhetorical war . This is natural -- but unwise . Economic hardship in Cuba will send more boat and raft people to Florida ; political turmoil will inevitably spill_over into the inflamed politics of the Cuban exile community . With more_than 1 million Cubans now living_in the United States , America ' s interest in the peace and stability of Cuba is greater than ever . U.S. policy toward Cuba must change . Instead of working to dismantle the existing regime , we need to build links to the post-communist Cuba starting to emerge . Full diplomatic relations would allow U.S. diplomats to develop ties to Cuban reformers . An end to the travel ban will allow more face-to-face contact between U.S. citizens and their Cuban counterparts . A gradual end to the embargo will help put a floor under the Cuban economy . These measures won ' t cure Cuba ' s economic woes or stabilize its politics . Nothing can . But they don ' t cost any money and they will help prevent a descent into chaos in an island of 11 million people 90 miles from our shores . Both Cuba and the United States need changes in policy , and the longer each country waits , the worse things will get. *</TEXT>
