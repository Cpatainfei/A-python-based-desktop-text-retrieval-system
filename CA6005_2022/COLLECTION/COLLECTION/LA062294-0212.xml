   <HEADLINE> STATE FARM SAYS HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE CRISIS LOOMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State Farm Mutual Automobile_Insurance Co. , the largest property insurer in California and the United States , warned Tuesday of a &quot; looming crisis &quot; in California homeowners insurance precipitated by the withdrawal of two major insurers from the market after the Northridge earthquake . &quot; Without immediate action to pass a rational plan to provide relief , additional companies will be driven from the market , &quot; State Farm President Edward B . Rust Jr . told Gov . Pete Wilson and state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi in letters the insurer released Tuesday . Facing massive losses from the Jan . 17 earthquake , 20th Century Insurance Co . and Farmers Insurance Group recently halted their writings of new earthquake and homeowners policies . 20th Century is abandoning the two lines of coverage permanently . Farmers , No . 3 in California homeowners insurance , called its action temporary but set no date for resuming sales . Other carriers , including State Farm -- which has more_than 25 % of the California market -- have cut_back on sales of earthquake and homeowners policies . * The result , according to an insurance_agents trade group , is that consumers are having trouble finding coverage . Wilson ' s insurance adviser , Marjorie M . Berte , said last week that the governor is concerned that an availability crisis in homeowners insurance could hurt real_estate sales and the economic recovery . Garamendi will outline his proposals to address the problem today , a spokeswoman said . Rust called_for a meeting of &quot; all interested parties &quot; to discuss possible solutions to the problem . State Farm , based in Bloomington , Ill. , proposes creating a statewide , industry-supported earthquake insurance pool that would help reduce individual carriers ' exposure to catastrophes , spokesman Bill Sirola said . The proposal would eliminate the state law requiring that any insurer selling homeowners insurance also offer earthquake coverage , Sirola added , but it would also restrict an insurer ' s ability to leave the market and dump all its earthquake policies into the pool . State Farm and other insurers have also endorsed the proposed Natural Disaster Protection Act , federal legislation that would create a national , industry-financed pool to help cover catastrophes .</TEXT>
