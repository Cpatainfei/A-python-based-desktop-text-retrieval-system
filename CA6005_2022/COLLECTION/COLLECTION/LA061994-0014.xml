   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; A FEW POINTS OF VIEW VERY WELL TAKEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here comes trouble . As in : Viewer , could we trouble you to use your brain ? As in : Gosh , I might have to go_to the trouble of rethinking what I think . that ' s trouble , with a capital &quot; T , &quot; which rhymes with &quot; P.O.V. , &quot; which stands_for &quot; Point of View. &quot; &quot; Very rarely do people look_at a ' P.O.V. ' film and shrug their shoulders and go_about their business without giving what they ' ve seen a second_thought , &quot; says Marc Weiss , who fathered this series of independent nonfiction films . Back for its seventh summer season , &quot; P.O.V. &quot; means a welcome spot of trouble through mid-August on the PBS schedule ( it airs in Los Angeles Tuesday nights ) . This week , &quot; P.O.V. &quot; presents &quot; Escape From China &quot; by Chinese journalist Iris F . Kung ( a pseudonym ) , who returns to her homeland to retrace the &quot; underground_railroad &quot; that helped the last of China ' s most-wanted Tian An Men Square leaders escape to freedom . A week earlier , the series presented &quot; One Nation Under God , &quot; a film by Teodoro Maniaci and Francine Rzeznik that chronicles some of the all too many attempts to &quot; cure &quot; homosexuality -- and examines why the church , the psychiatric community and other segments of society have pressured lesbians and gay_men to &quot; recover. &quot; &quot; The fact that somebody is homosexual , &quot; one &quot; expert &quot; intones in a clip from a 30-year-old documentary , &quot; automatically rules_out the possibility that he will remain happy for long. &quot; Assume for a moment this is true , responds a current-day gay_man , who then ponders , &quot; If someone was unhappy being tall , would those same people call_for sawing off his legs ? &quot; In the following weeks you can look_forward to : -- &quot; The End of the Nightstick , &quot; an expose that unravels a history of abuse of suspects by the Chicago police . -- &quot; Hearts of Darkness , &quot; a behind-the-scenes look_at Francis Ford Coppola ' s mad struggle to finish his 1979 feature &quot; Apocalypse Now &quot; before it finished him . -- &quot; Dialogues With Madwomen , &quot; by Academy Award winner Allie Light , in which she and six other women describe their experiences with manic_depression and other mental_disorders . As should be clear by now , the films of &quot; P.O.V. &quot; ( would the series be more aptly called &quot; POINTS_of_View &quot; ? ) are as varied and as personal as fingerprints . What do they have in common ? All have cleared the rigorous selection process &quot; P.O.V &quot; imposes on the more_than 500 films submitted each year . After 40 semifinalists are chosen by a committee of filmmakers and public TV programmers , Weiss huddles with his co-executive producer , Ellen Schneider , to identify the 10 that should air . &quot; We look_for a mix , &quot; Weiss says , &quot; a good cross-section , some lighter , some more serious , with a variety of subjects , and a range of approaches -- subjective to the more issue-oriented to slice-of-life. &quot; &quot; There is no political litmus test , &quot; Schneider adds . &quot; ' P.O.V. ' has no ideological agenda. &quot; They must be doing something right . In its first six seasons , the series has won five Peabody Awards ( known as broadcasting ' s Pulitzer Prize ) , among other honors . And while it doesn ' t exactly go looking_for trouble , &quot; P.O.V. &quot; has found it along the way , most notably three years ago with &quot; Tongues Untied , &quot; a vision of black gay life that ignited a firestorm . Conservative legislators ( without necessarily troubling themselves to see it ) called the film pornographic and blasphemous . &quot; We knew it was a risky film , &quot; Weiss explains , &quot; but we also thought that if we didn ' t put it on , there would really be no reason for the series to continue . It was important not to pull_back and say , ' This might be too hot to handle. ' &quot; It wasn ' t , and they didn ' t , and , having weathered that storm , the hardy &quot; P.O.V. &quot; persists_in challenging each viewer to re-examine his or her own P.O.V. &quot; It can be a transformative experience , &quot; Weiss says . &quot; People watching an hour or so of TV and then changing the way they think_about something. &quot; Trouble , yes . But no problem .</TEXT>
