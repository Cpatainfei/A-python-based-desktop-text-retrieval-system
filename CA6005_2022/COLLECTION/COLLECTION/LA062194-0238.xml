   <TEXT> On one thing all sides agree : The giant_panda , that childlike , overstuffed animal with the haunting black circles_around its eyes , must be rescued from the ravages of modernity in its native China . After that , agreement tends to break_down . As a result , the most popular animal ever brought_to American zoos has all but disappeared from public view . Only one panda remains in an American zoo , Hsing-Hsing in the National Zoo in Washington , and it is unclear whether the federal_government will again allow zoos to borrow pandas from the Chinese . The reasons lie_in a complicated struggle to save the panda that is equal parts science and politics , international cooperation and geopolitical suspicion . At the center of the dispute is the renowned San Diego Zoo , whose thwarted bid to borrow two pandas from the Chinese for exhibition and breeding purposes has heightened the international debate about how , or even whether , the panda can be salvaged as a species . Scientists in China and the United States have found it difficult to compensate for the panda ' s hit-or-miss approach to procreation , in which the male and female live apart all year long and the female is in heat only one day annually . But the political hurdles in saving the panda are even more daunting . Two Chinese bureaucracies with responsibility for the panda have been at_odds . American zoos have clamored for the black-and-white , bear-like animals , but the U.S._government in recent years has given mixed messages , first encouraging their importation , then putting_up roadblocks and , finally , halting importation altogether last December . The Geneva-based World Wildlife Fund , a leader in the save-the-panda movement for 25 years , has urged even tighter restrictions on imports than those in the endangered species law . The world ' s leading authority on panda preservation has written a blistering book suggesting that preservation efforts in China are doomed because of ineptitude and greed and that American zoos , including San Diego , are mainly interested in exploiting the panda to boost attendance . Indeed , the monetary stakes for American zoos in the panda debate are enormous . In an increasingly competitive market for the consumer entertainment dollar , pandas mean big bucks . A dozen American zoos , from Seattle to Atlanta , as well as the Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa , Fla. , are interested in borrowing pandas and are willing to pay millions of dollars to the Chinese to get them . Meanwhile the number of pandas in the wild has dwindled to fewer than 1 # 000 . For 3 million years , untold numbers of pandas roamed freely in the mountains of Central China . But in the past half-century pandas have been pushed to the brink of extinction by China ' s burgeoning population and economic development . Much of the forest that is the panda ' s natural habitat has been cleared for timber and farming . The bamboo that is the panda ' s main source of nutrition suffered a natural but catastrophic die-off in the mid-1980s . As if economic and natural forces were not_bad enough , poachers have killed pandas for their pelts , which can fetch $ 10 # 000 on the Asian black_market . The Chinese reportedly have executed six poachers but the illegal traffic continues . Amid all this depressing news about the panda ' s chances for survival , scientists at the San Diego Zoo , acclaimed in the zoological world for their work in preserving other endangered species , thought last year that they had found a way to make a major contribution toward saving the pandas . San Diego Zoo and Chinese officials , who have cooperated for two decades in saving several species , struck a deal for two young pandas to be sent to the zoo for three years . The zoo would give $ 3 million to the Chinese government to pay_for the preservation of panda habitat . If the female gave_birth , the ante would be upped by $ 600 # 000 per cub . Scientists at the zoo ' s Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species believe they have found a hormone test to predict the female ' s one-day estrus , a hair test to determine virility and rutting ability among male pandas , and behavioral methods copied from cheetahs to get male and female pandas interested in mating . If they are right , the results could be a major boon to the panda breeding centers run_by the Chinese government , where the reproductive record has been spotty . Confident of approval by the U.S._government , the San Diego Zoo spent nearly $ 1 million for a special panda enclosure . But in September the U.S. Department_of_the_Interior ' s Fish &amp; Wildlife Service rejected the zoo ' s application to import Shun-Shun and Shi-Shi , both of whom had been captured for medical reasons . Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt said sending pandas to San Diego could lead the Chinese to round_up pandas as a kind of cash crop to peddle to other zoos . The rejection signaled a shift of federal policy . During the Reagan and Bush_administrations , several applications to import pandas were approved . When the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service balked at approving a loan permit for the zoo in Columbus , Ohio , President Bush intervened on the zoo ' s behalf . Babbitt ' s rejection was an unexpected and embarrassing turn of events for the San Diego Zoo : to be accused of doing something that could hasten the extinction of an animal species beloved by mankind . &quot; When we were turned_down , I was flabbergasted , &quot; said Douglas Myers , executive_director of the San Diego Zoological Society . &quot; Our whole reason for being is to help preserve species. &quot; The San Diego Zoo ' s application had two powerful opponents : the World Wildlife Fund , whose president is Britain ' s Prince Philip , and noted zoological writer George Schaller , author of the 1993 book &quot; The Last Panda. &quot; Schaller , who conducted the first panda census for the World Wildlife Fund , refers acidly to Chinese collaboration with American zoos as &quot; rent-a-panda &quot; programs and concludes that panda preservation is a failure . The fallout from the San Diego rejection and the Schaller book has been enormous . The zoo has resubmitted its application with added scientific evidence it hopes will allay Babbitt ' s fears . &quot; I hope this time good science is recognized and politics are put aside , &quot; said Myers . Instead of the female Shun-Shun , the zoo is now asking_for Bai Yung , a captive-born female from the preserve in Wolong . There had been controversy about the reasons behind Shun-Shun ' s capture . Also , the panda pot has been sweetened . Along with the $ 1 million a year for preservation of panda habitat , the zoo will also provide $ 200 # 000 a year in scientific assistance . The agreement could be in_effect for up_to 12 years . Three months after rejecting the San Diego application , the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service stopped reviewing new applications for the importation of pandas until a new panda policy is developed . Babbitt , citing the Schaller book , has taken a personal hand in shaping that policy , a process that is still under way . Meanwhile , the American Assn . of Zoological Parks and Aquariums has formulated a Species Survival Plan . The trade association ' s plan would have zoos acting in concert to import pandas for breeding purposes rather than having individual zoos cut separate deals . Importing pandas strictly for exhibition would be ended . All imports would be part of a breeding program ; only pandas_born in captivity in China would be eligible to be loaned to American zoos . By acting_as a consortium , zoos could share information on the panda ' s behavior in captivity and possibly solve the mystery of why many captive pandas seem to lose interest in copulation . Sperm from males with a proven record of potency could be collected for artificial_insemination . For natural methods , finicky females might be provided a selection of mates . The zoo association plan is dependent_on the Chinese allowing_for greater accountability of where zoo funds earmarked for habitat preservation , such_as the millions promised by San Diego , are being spent . The Chinese say it will cost $ 50 million to buy enough forest land to ensure the species ' survival . Schaller and the World Wildlife Fund have expressed concern that money already sent to China by U.S. zoos for habitat preservation has been squandered or spent on non-panda projects . Panda policy in China is handled by overlapping and sometimes warring ministries of forestry and construction . Getting the Chinese to permit outside auditing is a touchy diplomatic matter . A high-level mission from the American Assn . of Zoological Parks and Aquariums left earlier this month for China . When the group returns , it hopes to announce a breakthrough agreement for accountability . The goal is to influence Babbitt and the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service to allow pandas to be brought_to the United States for breeding . Whether such an agreement can be reached , or whether it will placate the concerns of the World Wildlife Fund , is unclear . The organization funded the first census in the 1970s and has helped the Chinese manage some of their preservation centers . &quot; Some of the Chinese plans for timber extraction , panda preservation areas , and hotels near those preservation areas are scary , &quot; said World Wildlife Fund official Ginette Himley . By all accounts , pandas have been the most popular attraction ever brought_to American zoos since the first visiting panda , Su-Lin , was brought_to Chicago in 1937 amid hoopla fit for royalty . When the San Diego Zoo brought Yuan-Yuan and Basi for 200 days in 1987 and 1988 , attendance soared and the zoo made an estimated $ 4 million from tickets , souvenirs and concessions . A new word was coined to describe the sensation : pandamonium . The zoos in Toledo and Columbus wanted pandas so badly in the 1980s that they fought in court to get them . The Columbus zoo risked censure by the zoo association . For two decades the nation watched the reproductive drama of Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling , given to the National Zoo after President Nixon ' s historic visit to China in 1972 . The deaths of all five offspring and the demise of the female Ling-Ling were cause for national disappointment . &quot; In what other species are all captives known by name ? &quot; wrote Schaller . &quot; What other species has its every birth , illness , reluctant romance and death announced by the news media ? &quot; The public ' s fascination with the panda has baffled scientists . Some have suggested that the panda ' s teddy-bear appearance triggers a hormonal response and latent maternal feelings . Others have theorized the attraction comes from the fact that adult pandas , which can grow to 300 pounds and five feet in_length , retain the basic appearance of cubs . &quot; They ' re both exotic and cuddly , &quot; suggested the wildlife fund ' s Himley , whose group uses the panda as its logo and sells panda trinkets . Whatever the reason for the infatuation , the Chinese in the 1970s began to understand the political uses of the panda . Pandas were loaned to zoos in Japan , the United States , England , France , Spain , Mexico and North_Korea . Pandas were loaned to the Los Angeles Zoo during the 1984 Olympics , but since the late 1980s the flow of pandas to America has slowed to a trickle because of misgivings by the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service . The pent-up demand for pandas is enormous . Oliver Ryder , geneticist at the San Diego Zoo , calls this the &quot; charismatic mega-vertebrate &quot; phenomenon and thinks it can be harnessed to rally public support to save other species . &quot; People may_not care about the spotted salamander , the El Segundo blue butterfly or the desert pupfish , &quot; Ryder said . &quot; But they care about the panda. &quot; Ryder did a study he hopes refutes the idea that granting a panda permit would encourage the Chinese to begin capturing pandas for export . His figures indicate that even when China was exporting pandas freely , the number of captures was unaffected . While the San Diego import application is being reviewed -- no decision is expected this summer -- other zoos are watching . &quot; Everyone concerned with pandas is watching what happens to San Diego , &quot; said Himley . San Diego Zoo officials have suggested that Schaller ' s pessimism may be based on old information , noting that his data was collected in the early 1980s and that cooperation has improved . &quot; China is a different country than when George was there , &quot; said animal behavior expert Don Lindburg . &quot; From the standpoint of captive breeding , if we ' re ever going_to do anything with the panda , now is the time. &quot; As it waits for the pandas that may never arrive , the San Diego Zoo has put a sign outside the empty enclosure asking_for the public to remain patient . A toy panda_bear sits as a forlorn presence in a tree . In March , a zoo official got an unexpected opportunity to speak_to President Clinton about pandas . While vacationing in Coronado , the President , his wife , Hillary Rodham Clinton , and their daughter , Chelsea , went_on a VIP tour of the zoo ' s Wild Animal Park . The president got a close-up view of a Somali wild_ass , an endangered species that has been bred at the Wild Animal Park . He asked zoo official Jim Dolan about the zoo ' s efforts with other rare animals . One animal seemed foremost on the President ' s mind . &quot; Do you have your pandas yet ? &quot; Clinton asked . Dolan was more_than willing to provide details .</TEXT>
