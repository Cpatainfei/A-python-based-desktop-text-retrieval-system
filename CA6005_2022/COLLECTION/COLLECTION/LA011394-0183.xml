   <HEADLINE> SPURT IN DONORS FAILS TO EASE U.S. BLOOD SHORTAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 77 # 000 people have donated blood to the American Red_Cross in the last four days , but the nation is still experiencing a critical blood shortage , the agency said Wednesday . &quot; We are not out of the woods yet by any means , &quot; Red_Cross President Elizabeth Hanford Dole said. &quot; We urgently need more blood. &quot; Blood centers in eight more cities issued emergency appeals for blood Wednesday . The Red_Cross and blood_banks last Friday declared the nation ' s blood shortage the worst in Red_Cross history . The agency ' s usual three-day supply of blood had dropped to a one-day supply , and several hospitals told the American Assn . of Blood_Banks that they were postponing elective surgeries . Officials blamed snowstorms in the East , the virulent Beijing flu that has sickened people in at least 17 states , and the holiday season for the shortage . In response , 30 # 000 people donated blood to the Red_Cross over the weekend , 23 # 000 gave on Monday and another 24 # 567 donated on Tuesday , officials said . Despite the new donations , the agency ' s inventory was still just 39 # 734 units of blood , far below the normal level of 67 # 000 . Blood centers in eight more cities , which also serve their surrounding areas , are appealing for emergency donations : Knoxville , Tenn. ; Kansas City ; Portland , Ore. ; Roanoke and Norfolk , Va. ; Savannah , Ga. ; Toledo , Ohio ; and San Juan , Puerto Rico .</TEXT>
