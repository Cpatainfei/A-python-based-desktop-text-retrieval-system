   <HEADLINE> IN JAPAN , IT ' S SHOWDOWN TIME ON REFORM ; GOVERNMENT : PREMIER HOSOKAWA WILL TRY TO WORK_OUT AN 11TH-HOUR COMPROMISE WITH THE OPPOSITION . FAILING THAT , HE MAY STEP ASIDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Declaring that he has no intention of clinging_to power , Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa today prepared_for a final showdown with legislators over enactment of promised political reforms . Coalition leaders announced late Thursday that Hosokawa will try to work_out an eleventh-hour compromise with the president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party , Yohei Kono . But if Kono rejects a meeting or fails to agree to a new reform plan , they said , Hosokawa will put his coalition ' s package to a final vote_in the lower house of Parliament . A two-thirds vote there -- considered highly unlikely -- would be needed to overturn the upper house rejection of the bills last week . The lower house approved the bills last Nov . 18 but with the support of only 53 % of its members . &quot; If I cannot deliver on my promise of political reform , &quot; Hosokawa said Thursday , &quot; I have no intention whatsoever of clinging_to the prime_minister ' s post. &quot; When Hosokawa took_office last August , he promised to &quot; assume responsibility &quot; if he failed to enact the reforms . Hosokawa made his announcement at a political rally in a hotel , where he took the unusual step of urging voters to &quot; call your representatives &quot; to appeal for support of the bills , which would change the way the powerful lower house of Parliament is elected and would ban corporate donations to individual politicians . &quot; After five years of repeatedly debating political reform , if we now bury it because of only minor differences_of_opinion , the opportunity to carry_out reform will never again come , &quot; Hosokawa warned . Although both sides agreed to scrap the system of multi-seat constituencies in favor of single-seat districts , they remained deadlocked over the extent to which controls should be tightened on political funds . &quot; Without political reform , we cannot hope that economic stimulus measures could succeed , &quot; Hosokawa told the rally . &quot; Without political reform , it will be impossible to realize administrative or ( budgetary ) reform , or reform and opening of our economy and society . &quot; The people ' s loss of confidence in party and parliamentary politics will become decisive , and it is perfectly clear that Japan will lose completely the trust of the international community , &quot; he added . * His remarks about not clinging_to his post echoed comments made Tuesday by Shusei Tanaka , his chief personal adviser , who predicted that the prime_minister ' s resignation over failure of the bills is &quot; highly possible. &quot; If he does resign , he will become the third prime_minister in three years to do so after failing to change Japan ' s scandal-ridden political_system . Shortly before midnight , a joint committee of the upper and lower houses gave_up efforts to hammer_out a compromise reform package . Hosokawa ' s coalition of seven lower house_parties holds only 260 seats in the 511-member chamber and would need a rebellion by 81 Liberal Democrats to win the necessary two-thirds approval . Even if the bills fail , the vote could precipitate another major split in the Liberal Democratic Party , which lost its 38-year grasp on power after about 50 reformers bolted the party last summer . Although a new parliamentary session will begin Monday , the bills cannot be carried_over -- and speculation is rampant about what Hosokawa might do if defeated . He could do nothing , or resign without calling a general_election . He could call a general_election in February . Or he could postpone a resignation and general_election until after he announces a package of measures to stimulate Japan ' s limp economy . The economic measures have been shunted aside for more_than a month by the political turmoil . Also up_in_the_air is a scheduled summit_meeting between Hosokawa and President Clinton at the White_House on Feb . 11 . And another political upheaval is rearing its head : Police and prosecutors have leaked to Japanese reporters plans to arrest Parliament members for taking bribes from construction companies in a scandal that already has snared more_than 30 governors , mayors and construction company executives .</TEXT>
