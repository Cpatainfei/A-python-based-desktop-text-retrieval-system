   <HEADLINE> THE SIMPSON TRIAL ; TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS ; COURTS : FOR SOME IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM , THE CRUSH OF MEDIA AND CURIOSITY SEEKERS FOR THE O.J. SIMPSON CASE NEARLY FORCES THE WHEELS OF JUSTICE TO GRIND TO A HALT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The guy suspected of stealing her car was_on trial on the inside . But it was Patricia Auger ' s patience that was being tried outside the Criminal_Courts building Monday morning in Downtown Los Angeles . Auger left her Victorville home before dawn to get_to court on_time to testify against the suspect . She even remembered to stop in Fontana to pick_up a friend to ride in with her , &quot; so we could drive_in the car-pool lane and save time. &quot; Too_bad she forgot that O.J. Simpson ' s trial was beginning on the same day , at the same hour , at the same courthouse . There was chaos when Auger arrived . A mob of photographers and reporters jousting for a glimpse of Simpson ' s attorneys blocked the door . A crowd of curious onlookers formed a tight knot behind them . And in back of them was a colorful gaggle of demonstrators trying to attract attention to their own causes . &quot; Only the O.J. people could go inside , &quot; said Auger , 31 . &quot; We saw O.J. ' s friend , the guy with the white streak in his hair -- Mr. ( Robert ) Kardashian . We tried to sneak_in through the door behind him , but they stopped us . They finally sent us to a door on the far side. &quot; As it turned_out , the courthouse had a &quot; The Far Side &quot; cartoon look_to it all day . On one side of the building , local disc_jockey Rick Dees was broadcasting his drive-time show live , offering running commentary on the circus-like atmosphere . Out front , the real circus was unfolding as Pop Zhao unfurled a huge white drop_cloth and started painting himself red . Zhao , a 31-year-old Chinese performance artist , had driven from San Francisco . He was wearing a white jumpsuit and a painted question_mark on his face . As he dripped paint to the strain of classical_music blaring from a boombox , he handed_out mock dollar_bills to bystanders . Simpson ' s picture replaced George_Washington ' s portrait . &quot; O.J. Innocent , &quot; proclaimed the writing over the picture . The Simpson attorneys were inside the courthouse by now and reporters quickly turned their attention to Zhao . &quot; I asked God about O.J. and God said he ' s innocent , that two other people did_it , &quot; Zhao told them . Suggested Norma Meyer of Copley News Service : &quot; Why don ' t you go_back and ask God tonight what their names are and come_back tomorrow and tell us ? &quot; In the background , laughing and taking snapshots was Irene Allen . She runs the courthouse shoeshine stand . It ' s called A.J. ' s Shoe Shine Parlor . And O.J. ' s been very , very good to A.J. ' s. &quot; Business has tripled since the O.J. thing came here , &quot; confided Allen , 50 . &quot; I ' ve had to buy a $ 900 electric shoeshine machine to keep up. &quot; When she ' s not seeing that the shoes of celebrity lawyers and celebrity news correspondents are being polished , Allen is polishing_up her own celebrityhood . &quot; I also do a live talk_show three times a week . An Illinois radio_station calls_up and asks what ' s going_on and I tell them what ' s happened , &quot; she said . &quot; They ' re paying me. &quot; There was a flurry of activity at noon when jurors were released for lunch . Those not called_for the Simpson case came outside to look_at the show . Several purchased $ 1 buttons from salesman Eddie Dee , 63 , of La Canada Flintridge . The biggest seller : &quot; O.J. Simpson Jury Reject : did not make the cut. &quot; One woman wearing a juror ' s badge berated Dee -- who normally sells buttons at sporting events . &quot; Everybody ' s making money on this except O.J. , &quot; she screamed . Demonstrator Jack Gerritsen , 58 , of Bell , handed brochures demanding jury reform to jurors as they walked_out . &quot; Thanks for serving , &quot; he said , wearing sandals with his maroon suit . Down the sidewalk , court workers and jurors lined_up at Alfredo Uycabaodeci ' s hot dog cart . Fernando Mejia , a cameraman for Channel 52 , helped_out by making change while he waited his turn . During the afternoon , as the first of hundreds of potential Simpson jurors were being assembled on the 11th floor , jurors in other parts of the courthouse idled away the time as they waited to be called to duty for less sensational trials . Some played cards in the hallway . Others gossiped about the excitement outside and their good_fortune at not being called_for a trial that could last six months or longer , as Simpson ' s might . On the 15th floor , jurors in Judge Carlos R . Moreno ' s courtroom sat placidly while a hapless defendant in a drug case tried to defend himself by acting_as his own attorney . Next door , Judge Jan A . Pluim was questioning potential jurors for another drug case . When he asked the first six if any had been a victim of crime , hands went_up and a litany of burglary stories and car-theft and purse-snatching tales poured_out . In an 11th-floor courtroom , a woman stepping_out of a jury_box tripped , hit her head and was knocked_out cold . An ambulance was summoned . Its siren interrupted TV correspondent Lisa Stark , who was outside the courthouse filing a live report for a St . Louis station . It was one of 15 such reports she would do this day for local ABC affiliates across the country , said Stark , of Washington , D.C. &quot; This is a light day , &quot; she said . Patricia Auger , meantime , was heading back to Victorville after finally testifying in her car-theft case . It had been a heavy day for her . &quot; It worked_out in the end , though , &quot; Auger explained . &quot; I was late getting there . But the judge was too. &quot;</TEXT>
