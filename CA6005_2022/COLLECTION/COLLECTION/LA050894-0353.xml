   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 / 40 DAYS AND COUNTING ; GETTING A KICK_START ; JAPAN IS SHOWING THE UNITED STATES HOW IT ' S DONE WITH THE SUCCESS OF SOCCER ' S J-LEAGUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s a quick question to test your knowledge of international sports : How many applied for tickets to the opening match of the inaugural season in Japan ' s professional soccer league -- 800 ? 8 # 000 ? 800 # 000 ? The third figure is correct . Here ' s a quick question to test your knowledge of American sports : How many will apply for tickets to the opening match of the inaugural season of Major_League Soccer , the United States ' latest effort to launch a professional soccer league -- 800 ? 8 # 000 ? The first figure is as likely to be correct as the latter . The J-League , as Japan ' s newest sports venture is called , will be one year old next Sunday . Major_League Soccer is expected to make its debut one year from now . But , in the opinion of many observers , rather than being separated by only a_couple_of years , the two leagues already are light_years apart . Soccer has conquered Japan , or at least a good portion of it , in only 12 months . The sport is now the hottest ticket in town , every bit as popular as baseball or sumo wrestling . Companies such_as Nissan , Toyota , Mitsubishi and others are pouring tens of millions of dollars into soccer . The media is giving it extensive coverage . How was all this accomplished and can the same formula be followed by Major_League Soccer ? Probably not . &quot; They ' ve done a wonderful job , but it ' s not something that we can package easily and bring_back to the United States , &quot; said Hank Steinbrecher , executive_director / secretary_general of the United States Soccer Federation ( USSF ) . The main obstacle , it appears , is cultural . What the Japanese government , industry and fans are willing to accept , the American government , industry and people are not . It ' s as simple as that . Steinbrecher , along with Alan Rothenberg , chairman and chief_executive_officer of World Cup USA 1994 and president of the USSF , traveled_to Japan to study the J-League and see what lessons could be applied on this side of the Pacific . What they learned is that it won ' t be that easy . One reason is contained in this quote from Sauburo Kawabuchi , chairman of the J-League : &quot; We expect to lose $ 250 million in the first five years , &quot; he said without so_much as blinking an eye . In difficult economic times , that would seem a staggering statement to make , but the Japanese take a different view of such things . Their goals are much different than quick profits . &quot; The Japanese are very long-term thinkers , &quot; Steinbrecher said . &quot; All this ( investment in professional soccer ) is part of an integrated plan to stage the World Cup in 2002 , when they can showcase Japan. &quot; So , unlike the United States , which was awarded this summer ' s World Cup on condition -- or at least in the sincere belief -- that a professional league would be established , Japan is going_about it in a more logical manner . It has established a professional league in the hope of being awarded the World Cup . After months , indeed years , of planning and promotion , the J-League was launched on May 15 , 1993 . It was a spectacular opening_night . The Olympic Stadium in Tokyo was packed to the rafters . Celebrities were everywhere . Politicians rubbed elbows with entertainers and sports figures , including Pele and , in a diplomatic bow to baseball , Sadaharu Oh , Japan ' s greatest baseball_player . A spectacular laser , fireworks and music show preceded the first match , between Yokohama Marinos and Yomiuri Nippon . The entire event was televised live nationwide . It was all a huge success . Seven months later , the same could be said for the entire season . One million fans had passed_through the turnstiles within the first month . Sold-out stadiums were commonplace . Soccer quickly earned its place alongside baseball in terms of attendance and prime-time television coverage . It was more_than a novelty , it was an escape_from conformity . It was bright , it was colorful , it was lively . Whereas baseball obeyed the do-what-the-coach-tells-you ethic of an earlier era , soccer allowed and indeed encouraged freedom of expression , both in appearance and in the game itself . By season ' s end , both Kawabuchi and the media were hailing the J-League ' s success . &quot; It was a great success , &quot; Kawabuchi said . &quot; Everything turned_out for the best . I think the Japanese have understood for the first time that soccer is an aggressive , speedy and colorful sport. &quot; Japan ' s best-selling newspaper , Yomiuri Shimbun , made_it official in an editorial . &quot; The league has exceeded all expectations , &quot; the newspaper said . &quot; There were_full houses everywhere . Its popularity was_due to a feeling that the game was new and exciting , to attacking teams , strong foreign players and fast play . &quot; Now , sports typical of Japan are not just sumo and baseball . We can say that soccer has taken_root in the national culture. &quot; But how ? Steinbrecher believes it was done_by targeting a specific audience and by being willing , with some government prodding , to invest millions in making_it a commercially viable venture . &quot; I think they ' ve hit a bonanza , &quot; he said . &quot; The advertising , the marketing , is absolutely a stroke of genius . The thing that struck me first is that the marketing of the league itself is very youth oriented . The J-League is associated with vibrancy and youth and excitement . &quot; It ' s really young , whereas the traditional sport , baseball , caters to the older crowd . This is something that we should learn from -- that in our marketing we gear things toward the lower end of the age spectrum . &quot; The other thing is that the structure of the J-League , in my opinion , certainly will not work in the United States . They ( in Japan ) were able to get an infusion of capital very early and have some guarantees ( of success ) because of that . &quot; We can ' t expect our government ( local , state or federal ) to come and say to corporate sponsors , ' Listen , we want you to come_in and sponsor this team for , say , $ 5 million a year. ' It doesn ' t work that way . We have to structure the finances of the league and the league itself a little bit differently. &quot; Local_government did play a large part in helping the J-League get_off_the_ground . In the town of Kashima , for example , civic_leaders spent $ 75 million in building a 15 # 000-seat stadium and all_the attendant facilities for its club , the Kashima Antlers . Most of the 10 teams that started the league -- increased to 12 this season -- play in small stadiums of that size . But each one of them has plans to either expand or build huge new stadiums in the hope that if Japan is awarded the 2002 World Cup , their city will be one of the venues . It ' s yet another example of the long-term outlook . So , too , is the emphasis on developing Japanese stars . Fewer than a third of the players in the league are foreign . Each team is limited to signing five foreigners and can play only three at a time . The Japanese are not making the same errors that scuttled the ill-fated North_American Soccer League , the most recent attempt to sell soccer to the American public . &quot; That league was geared to profit and in the end there was no active promotion or nurturing of promising American players , &quot; Kawabuchi said . &quot; We shall not be making the same mistake . The J-League has a majority of good , home-grown Japanse players who have moved_up from high_school and semi-professional leagues. &quot; Still , J-League teams did scour Europe and South_America in search of stars to bring_in the fans . Top names such_as England ' s Gary Lineker , Brazil ' s Zico and Argentina ' s Ramon Diaz were among the big attractions in the first season and also among the most highly paid . Lineker , for instance , was signed by Nagoya Grampus Eight for $ 4.5 million for three years . Diaz pocketed $ 1.8 million for his two years with the Yokohama Marinos , and Zico , who took the Kashima Antlers all_the way to the first league championship game , got a three-year , $ 1.5-million contract even though he was 40 when he signed . But the Japanese players are not hurting . Japan national team striker Kazuyoshi Miura earned $ 900 # 000 last season from Kawasaki Verdy and that figure was increased to $ 2 million this season . Kawasaki is also making plans for a state-of-the-art , 100 # 000-seat stadium for World Cup 2002 . It is small wonder , then , that viewed with such examples , American soccer officials and fans become a little despondent . Politicians in the United States are , understandably , not about to commit tax dollars to a sport , especially one such_as soccer . Private enterprise will not do anything to promote the game unless it can guarantee its shareholders a quick profit . And the media are not going_to pay serious attention to soccer until soccer shows that it is worth the coverage . There , in a nutshell , are three reasons why the Major Soccer League is in_trouble even before the first ball is kicked . Steinbrecher provides another : &quot; I think Major_League Soccer will be up and running in some form or other by 1995 , &quot; he said . &quot; Will we have the initial success of the J-League ? I doubt it . &quot; The reason I say that is that we have a much more complex , convoluted sports-entertainment industry in the United States than they do_in Japan . It ' s just far more competitive . &quot; They do not have all these entrenched brands that we do , the NFL , the NBA , major_league baseball , NASCAR , college basketball , college football . We have a much , much more difficult market to penetrate. &quot; Perhaps the answer lies_in letting the Japanese do_it . Perhaps the 12 J-League teams would like to establish a farm system in the United States . After all , American baseball made the transition into Japanese culture . What is to stop Japanese soccer making the transition into American culture ?</TEXT>
