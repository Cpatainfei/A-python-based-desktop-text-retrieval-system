   <HEADLINE> PRO-COMMUNIST ELECTED HEAD OF STATE IN BELARUS ; POLITICS : THE CHOICE IS A BLOW TO REFORMERS IN THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In another rout for reformers in the former Soviet_Union , a pro-Communist ex-police official was elected head_of_state in Belarus on Friday . Mechislav Grib , 57 , who advocates closer economic and military ties with Russia , was chosen on the second ballot by a vote of 183-55 to succeed ousted liberal reformer Stanislav Shushkevich as Speaker of Parliament . Parliament voted no confidence in Shushkevich on Wednesday , just 11 days after the physicist-reformer had been warmly endorsed by President Clinton during the President ' s visit to Minsk . The U.S. State_Department expressed regret over Shushkevich ' s departure , saying the vote &quot; deprives Belarus of leadership that has made a remarkable contribution to peace and stability in Europe. &quot; So did Belarussian Prime_Minister Vyacheslav Kebich , who was Shushkevich ' s constant critic . Kebich said Friday that although the two leaders had crossed swords , they agreed that their main task is to build a market_economy in the nation of 10 million without causing social upheaval . &quot; We wanted to prevent a sharp drop_in living standards . . . and to maintain stability , accord and peace on Belarussian soil , &quot; Kebich said . After Grib defeated rival Communist and Minsk Mayor Mikhail Marinich for the Speaker ' s job , Kebich announced that he intends to form a new government . At present , the Belarussian Speaker of Parliament and prime_minister have equal power . Grib supports the adoption of a new constitution that would establish a strong presidency -- and Friday ' s vote gives him a good shot at becoming Belarus ' first president , according to reports from Minsk . Even in Minsk , Grib is a relative unknown . Born to a peasant family , he was educated as a legal_expert and a high-ranking official in the Soviet Interior Ministry in the Vitebsk region . He was elected to the Belarussian Parliament in 1990 and heads a committee on national security , defense and law_enforcement . Grib also leads the pro-Communist Belarus faction , which claims 130 of the 345 lawmakers . His strong appeals for law and order have resonance in a new nation where , as in much of the former Soviet_Union , economic and political chaos has bred crime . &quot; I liked Shushkevich . He was a nice man -- but a little bit soft , &quot; said Nina Marinich , a 36-year-old telephone_operator in Minsk . &quot; This new man , or rather the old Communist , may_not be as_good_as Shushkevich in terms of democracy and all that. &quot; But with the economy collapsing , living standards declining and criminals running wild , a tough former policeman might restore order , she said . &quot; At least Communists used to have some order and discipline , &quot; she said . &quot; Prices were stable , and there was no crime . Democrats brought a good_deal of anarchy. &quot; Grib also supports the recently announced monetary union between Belarus and Russia . Former Deputy Prime_Minister Yegor T . Gaidar of Russia strongly protested the union as inflationary , but it is welcomed in Minsk , where the local zaichik , an interim coupon , inspires even less respect than the battered Russian ruble . In mid-January the zaichik was trading at 4.5 to the ruble . &quot; It would be nicer to have Russian rubles than the zaichiks of Shushkevich and Kebich , &quot; Nina Marinich said . Belarus never sought independence from the Soviet_Union , and it remains dependent_on Russia for 90 % of its fuel . Shushkevich fought a lonely battle to shore_up Belarussian sovereignty and tried to keep his country out of a military defense pact with the Russian-led Commonwealth of Independent States . Grib supports that treaty and said Friday that he has &quot; big hopes &quot; for Russian-Belarussian friendship . &quot; We are Slavs , we are neighbors , &quot; Grib said .</TEXT>
