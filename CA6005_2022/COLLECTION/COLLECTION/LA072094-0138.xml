   <TEXT> Riots , fires , floods and earthquakes . And now , a plague of stinginess ? There it is in black_and_white , a list : 50 areas ranked in_order of charitable giving per capita . At the top , Minneapolis , Atlanta and Columbus , Ohio . And way down at the bottom -- well , two from the bottom , at No . 48 -- is Los Angeles . We ' ve got more rich people than any region except New York . But we give less per capita than areas with far less wealth , according to a recent survey by the Chronicle of Philanthropy . On average , people here gave $ 7 each to United Way in 1992 , compared to $ 32 in Columbus . The study , the first conducted by the Washington , D.C.-based biweekly , focused_on donations in 1992 and 1993 to 10 major nonprofit organizations including the Boy_Scouts , YMCA and Red_Cross , plus charitable contributions to a broad range of nonprofits by local foundations and corporations . In the survey , the Los Angeles metropolitan area included all_of Los Angeles County except Long_Beach . Are we really a metropolis of Scrooges ? To be sure , like any best and worst list , the survey is a subjective thing , just one of many possible arrangements of statistics -- and open_to challenge . Indeed , local philanthropists say the rankings do not reflect the real generosity here . Angelenos , they say , tend to give to small , specialized organizations not included in the Chronicle ' s study . And they say burgeoning immigrant communities tend to give_in ways the survey does not include -- such_as contributing to churches or to needy relatives . But the same local experts say the study reflects a stark reality : It ' s hard to raise money here . And they say things are getting_worse : pledges to the local United Way dropped 25 % last year to $ 64 million . The same problem afflicts other nonprofit organizations across the region . The recession is cited as a major cause . The dilemma for fund-raisers is that as people lose their jobs , they are transformed from donors to recipients of charity , swelling demand as funding shrinks . At the same time , private philanthropy is taking_on a bigger share of the burden of providing essential social_services because of government cutbacks . But the roots of the problem , say fund-raising veterans , go_far deeper than the economic climate . Leaders of local nonprofit organizations offer a number of other reasons for the charity shortfall : No sense of community . Geographic sprawl . A crazy_quilt of ethnic diversity . Lots of rootless newcomers . Too_much new money , too_little old . Corporate downsizing and the end of the Cold_War . In other words , all_the usual suspects cited by those who say L.A. is going_to hell . Philanthropy imitates life . &quot; We are a city where people come_to , a growing , dynamic city . We ' re young , we ' re poor , we ' re dreamers , we ' re entrepreneurs . That is a wonderful , dynamic stew for a city , but it ' s a death_knell for philanthropy , &quot; said Jack Shakely , president of the California Community Foundation , which manages money left to charity by wealthy individuals . &quot; People coming from the East and Midwest are from cities with a strong philanthropic tradition and yet when they come_out here it ' s easy not to be ( involved ) , &quot; said John Fishel , executive_vice_president of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles . Although his organization raised about $ 40 million in the Los Angeles area last year , on a per capita basis , Jews give far less to the local Jewish fund than their counterparts in Tulsa , Okla. , or Cleveland , according to the Chronicle survey . This curse of newness may explain why California cities in_general did poorly in the study . San Diego , facing many of the same problems as Los Angeles , ranked 40th . The Chronicle broke_out Long_Beach , which ranked 49th , from Los Angeles even though it is an integral part of the region ' s fund-raising_efforts . Fresno came_in last . ( Orange and Ventura counties were not included because none of their cities were among the nation ' s 50 largest. ) Only San Francisco -- old , prideful and established -- did_well , coming_in 12th . Experts say it has a cadre of old families and corporate leaders who help nurture a sense of community . Some people point_out that Los Angeles ' large low-income population may dampen overall giving . But studies show that the poor almost always give a bigger part of their income to charity than the rich , and local experts say that is probably true here as well . Instead , managers of many nonprofits put much of the onus on the habits of the rich . In many cities , there is enormous peer pressure among social_lions to make their mark in philanthropy . But here , there is no single , cohesive elite . The barons of the very separate entertainment , Downtown business , aerospace and real_estate industries rarely hang_out together , and the guest lists of society events on the Westside or in Pasadena still have limited overlap . Thus , overwhelming social pressure to give rarely comes_to bear . In the 1950s and 1960s , Los Angeles was a smaller place where one person could sometimes overcome these differences . Dorothy Chandler , wife of the late Times Publisher Norman Chandler , was famed for her ability to corral a variety of people to raise funds for the Music Center , emblem of a united Los Angeles : &quot; Mrs . Chandler used to figure_out the shortfall and call_up her . . . friends , &quot; said Alice Coulombe , a founder of the Los Angeles Opera League . In those days , it was considered an achievement to meld Jewish and Gentile social circles . Today , things are far more complicated . Nobody has brought_together the wealthy Taiwanese immigrants of San Marino , the Mexican Americans of Hacienda Heights and the African Americans of Baldwin Hills who will be philanthropic movers and shakers of the future . Coulombe wants to reach everyone . The handwritten appeals for funds cluttering the dining_room table in her Arroyo Seco home are going_out to a gradually diversifying audience -- such_as a new group called Hispanics for L.A. Opera . But Coulombe admits she and other fund-raisers still deal mainly with a relatively narrow slice of the population . Who is the Dorothy Chandler of today ? &quot; That may be a type that ' s gone , &quot; Coulombe said . Without strong personalities cracking the whip , giving may flag . The Los Angeles County Museum of Art was embarrassed by a report it commissioned last year that said its trustees gave only a fraction of what their peers in other cities gave to museums in their communities . To be sure , there are many giving individuals among the region ' s wealthy . Lillian Disney , widow of Walt Disney , gave $ 50 million toward the new Frank O . Gehry-designed Disney Concert_Hall in Downtown . Music mogul David Geffen is_well known for his generosity to many causes , including a $ 1-million gift to AIDS Project Los Angeles . Developer Stuart Ketchum gave millions to build the sleek Downtown YMCA . Many other donors , both famous and unsung , contribute large amounts to charities and civic institutions . &quot; There are some cities you go_to , that if you don ' t become part of the giving scene , you ' re not accepted , &quot; said Lodwrick Cook , the Louisiana-born chairman of Arco . &quot; That doesn ' t happen here. &quot; Cook led fund raising for the renovation of the Central Library , and won praise for taking_on the widely shunned job of chairman of Rebuild L.A. Arco was recently rated No . 1 among American corporations in its donations to minority organizations by the Washington-based National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy . And yet , big corporations like Arco have less money to give than they used to . Like most large companies , Arco has reduced its work_force as profits have slipped , and its charitable contributions are declining as well , from $ 17 million in 1993 to a projected $ 12.5 million in 1994 . In the Los Angeles area , small companies , not large ones , will drive future economic_growth . That is bad news for fund-raisers . It is far more labor-intensive to raise a_million dollars by pounding the pavement among 50 little start-ups than by knocking_on one oak door at a corporate headquarters . The experiences of the Los Angeles Festival show vividly the nature of this change to a more diverse -- and less efficient -- donor base . In 1984 , when the festival began as the Olympic Arts Festival , it was bankrolled simply : by two $ 5-million checks from the Olympic Organizing Committee and Times Mirror Co. , which publishes the Los Angeles Times , said Laurie Dowling , the festival ' s former director of development . Each of the next three festivals had to work harder and harder for smaller donations . Last year , it took about 500 checks , plus wads of $ 1 bills that came_in the mail . Festival director Peter Sellars spent the year trotting from Korean American Rotary_Club meetings to elegant Iranian cocktail_parties to meet potential donors . It was great for building interest in the festival . But it was not an efficient way to raise money . The festival has had to cut its staff -- including Dowling -- and is refashioning itself as a more modest event . If the big Downtown and defense companies are diminishing sources of funds , Hollywood money remains an unattainable goal for many local nonprofits . Although the entertainment_industry attracts a lot of attention for its star-studded fund-raisers for national and international causes , the industry has a reputation among many grass-roots organizers for seeming to ignore its own back yard . Curtis Owens , executive_director of the African American Unity Center in South-Central Los Angeles says his group enjoyed an outpouring of support from Downtown corporations after the 1992 riots . But aside from donations by music mogul Berry Gordy Jr . and by Mann Theaters , the response from the entertainment_industry has been &quot; very little , &quot; Owens said . At the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund , a national civil_rights organization based in Los Angeles , President Antonia Hernandez says she has not been able to get any support from the entertainment_industry outside of a_few Latino actors . Despite the fact that Latinos will soon be a majority of the population here , &quot; the interest within the entertainment_industry for the Latino community has been nil , &quot; she said . MALDEF must go_to East Coast foundations for most of its funding , raising less than 10 % of its $ 5.4-million budget in Southern California . Lisa Paulsen , president of the Permanent Charities Committee of the Entertainment_Industries , disagrees_with the criticism . &quot; Our industry is extraordinarily benevolent , &quot; she said . The reason that the industry ' s generosity may_not be recognized , she said , is that &quot; a lot of people with a lot of money do_it very quietly. &quot; In addition to the splintered nature of Los Angeles ' business_community , the fragmentation of its population and the phenomenal pace of demographic change also hurt charitable giving . On the one hand , experts say , the older , largely white population may be reluctant to give because they feel that their donations will go_to an area that looks completely different from the one they have known , full of people speaking languages they cannot understand . On the other hand , many would-be donors from the newer groups are not giving more because they feel the mainstream charities are not adequately serving their communities . Many times they do not give simply because they are not asked . Nobody called Roger Huibonhoa , for example . He had to go_out looking_for places to give . A Hong Kong-born high-tech venture_capitalist and longtime Pacific Palisades resident , he has money , time and a deep interest in helping the city . So several years ago he phoned a man he had happened to see in a magazine_article -- Stewart Kwoh , executive_director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Fund . Huibonhoa now heads the organization ' s fund-raising_drive . &quot; I don ' t want to just give blindly , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t mind giving to the Music Center , but I don ' t know them , and they don ' t know me . But ( at the legal center ) I can know the founder personally. &quot; Huibonhoa does not believe that people should retreat into helping only their own ethnic_groups , and his family gives to causes from Nebraska to Africa . But he believes that philanthropic habits have to be nurtured close to home -- especially among immigrants unfamiliar_with the American style of giving . Some nonprofit managers say it is easier to foster the habit of philanthropy with small , local organizations than with big , mainstream organizations unable to change fast enough to accommodate new groups . For example , many of the scores of organizations that have sprung_up in the last two decades to serve people who speak Spanish , Chinese or Armenian cannot get_on the membership rolls of the United Way . Why , say people from these communities , should we give to an umbrella organization that appears to leave us out_in the rain ? &quot; United Way did not have a good reputation in ethnic communities , &quot; said Herbert Carter , president of the United Way of Greater Los Angeles . &quot; They had little decision-making power in United Way. &quot; Although United Way statistics show that the &quot; mainstream &quot; nonprofits it funds serve a largely minority population , the perception among many people was that those nonprofits were run_by people outside their communities . Carter , who is African-American , says he is working hard to diversify United Way ' s management and distribution of funds . Even critics praise him for his efforts , which include setting_up ethnic advisory_boards . But few believe that he has succeeded in turning_around a huge organization burdened with entrenched interests , from the corporate heads who lead its workplace fund-raising_drives to the traditional recipients of its largess who are reluctant to share their fast-shrinking pie with new agencies . The number of member agencies funded by United Way has shrunk 10 % in five years , at a time when community activists say the roster should be broadening . Asian American organizations received 0.6 % of total United Way donations in the county , while the Asian population is 10 % of the county , according to a 1990 study by a consortium of nonprofit groups . When potential donors in the Asian American community see trends like this , they are less willing to give , said Deborah Ching , executive_director of the Chinatown Service Center . &quot; You have to show people you ' re doing something they care about before you ask them for money , &quot; said Ching , whose organization assists poor immigrants . Because many service_agencies feel they cannot get the support they need from United Way and major foundations , they are turning_to specialized funds . In addition to the 25-year-old Black United Fund , the Women ' s Fund , United Latino Fund , Asian Pacific Community Fund and Earth Share ( an environmental fund ) have sprung_up . &quot; We don ' t want to redistribute existing giving but increase giving , &quot; said Mary Rapoport , development director of the Los Angeles Women ' s Foundation , which distributed about $ 300 # 000 to 30 ethnically diverse agencies last year . &quot; We do know that some women , when they see a women ' s foundation , are going_to give when they didn ' t give before. &quot; Providing employees with more choices about where they give significantly increases overall giving through payroll deductions , without cannibalizing United Way campaigns , studies show . Retail giant Carter Hawley Hale saw its employee donations more_than double last year when it allowed an employee committee to expand the slate of charities beyond United Way . People -- including people in Los Angeles -- are very generous to causes they feel connected to , fund-raisers say . But community activists are still struggling to arouse that sense of connection . &quot; How do you make people part of and responsible_for a community ? &quot; asks Carter of the United Way . &quot; How do you get people to understand that the things they wish for themselves can ' t be secured if other people don ' t have a basic quality_of_life ? &quot; Where the Region Ranks Compared to people in the 49 other largest metropolitan areas in the United States , people here give relatively little per capita to major charities . Here is how the Los Angeles area ranked compared to other areas in 1992 and 1993 . Overall : 48th United Way : 47th Jewish Federations * : 42nd American Red_Cross : 48th American Cancer Society : 38th YMCA : 33rd Boy_Scouts : 49th Girl_Scouts : 50th Goodwill Industries : 35th Disabled American Veterans : 48th Habitat for Humanity : 46th Grants by independent foundations : 25th Grants by community foundations : 33rd Gifts to community foundations : 31st Grants by corporate foundations : 36th * Dollars raised divided by Jewish population in each area . Source : Chronicle of Philanthropy Finding Solutions Many organizations are devising new strategies and enlisting old traditions to increase community involvement . They include : * L.A. Works , founded by actor Richard Dreyfuss , provides easy , &quot; just show_up &quot; volunteer activities for individuals and groups . Examples include matching ready hands with homeless shelters that need painting or community garden plots that need clearing . * Hispanics for L.A. Opera has been established by Latino opera fans to encourage attendance and financial_support . * The United Latino Fund , the Asian Pacific Community Fund , the Los Angeles Women ' s Foundation , and Earth Share have recently joined forces to mount payroll deduction campaigns with public employers . They are following the lead of the Brotherhood Crusade Black United Fund . The groups are trying to gain access to employees of private_corporations as well . * The United Way allows donors to designate individual charities instead of just the umbrella fund . * Many Jewish preschools and Mommy and Me toddler classes pass a traditional tzedakah box daily or weekly for children to put coins in to encourage the habit of charity early in life . Tzedakah means justice , and the donations go_to food_banks , homeless shelters , etc . * Private_foundations are increasingly requiring community organizations to form collaborative projects when they apply for funds to reduce redundancies and build coalitions . The result : an increase in multiethnic projects .</TEXT>
