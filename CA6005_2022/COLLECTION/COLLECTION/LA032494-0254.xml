   <TEXT> A potent storm from the Gulf of Alaska is expected to pummel Southern California with hail , snow , heavy rain and thunder late today , posing a renewed threat of destructive mudslides below hills denuded during last fall ' s devastating brush_fires . The storm , which could last through Sunday , is expected to drop up_to two inches of rain in the Los Angeles area and as much as a foot of snow at mountain resorts . &quot; It ' s a pretty strong early-spring storm , stronger than usual for Southern California , &quot; said Bruce Thoren , a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. &quot; There ' s definitely a good possibility of mudslides in the burn areas . And it ' s going_to be pretty cold , too , with the snow level down to 3 # 000 feet in some areas. &quot; Forecasters said the storm -- which struck Northern California late Wednesday and began working its way down the coast -- is expected to move inland across Santa Barbara and Ventura counties sometime this afternoon , reaching Los Angeles before nightfall . Thoren said the precipitation here will begin with light rain , shifting to heavier rain , with thunderstorms and hail during the night . &quot; Some of the thunderstorms could be severe , &quot; Thoren said . &quot; That means winds at up_to 55 m.p.h. and hail as big as three-quarters of an inch in diameter. &quot; The National Weather Service said the rain will continue , off and on but occasionally heavy , through Friday and Saturday and possibly into Sunday . &quot; Storms like this are hard to gauge , but there ' s a pretty good moisture tap this time , &quot; Thoren said . Temperatures are predicted to be cool during the rest of the week , with highs in the Los Angeles area ranging from the low 60s today to the mid-50s on Friday and Saturday . Highs at mountain resort levels should remain below freezing until the storm departs . The high_temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center_on Wednesday was 68 degrees , after an overnight low of 50 . The season ' s rainfall total stood at 6.23 inches , less than half the norm of 12.99 inches for the date .</TEXT>
