   <HEADLINE> SLAPPED SILLY ON THE SLOPES ; * BUMPS AND BRUISES ARE A GIVEN FOR ANY ADULT WHO TRIES LEARNING THE YOUTH- DRIVEN SPORT OF SNOW BOARDING . BUT A_FEW SECRETS WILL MAKE IT EASIER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mike and Don try to figure it out on_their_own . With rented snowboards underfoot , they grab a chairlift to the mid-heights of Mammoth Mountain and begin their descent . Twenty minutes later , sore and exhausted , they tumble to the bottom . &quot; Nightmare &quot; is the word they use to describe the experience . Now they ' re taking a lesson , which is where I join in . Unlike these two law_students -- whose names have been changed to protect their egos -- I have been warned about learning to snowboard on my own . This is what everyone says : You can teach yourself to board in one day , but it will be a hellish day of bumps and bruises . No problem for a 14-year-old . Snowboarding is , after all , a sport of the young with its snow slang and rock ' n ' roll fashions , its ultra-baggy grunge with dangling jester beanies and big gloves . And there are the wild acrobatics . Inverted aerials . Riding fakie . Grabbing mute . But Mike and Don aren ' t teen-agers . At this point , they ' d settle for survival . As for me , I ' m 32 and I had enough trouble putting_on my snowboard boots , which mysteriously feature laces on the inside and outside . Like many aspects of the sport , it is difficult to explain . Bruce , the instructor who shows_up for our beginner ' s lesson , smiles and nods . Snowboarding is a little easier , he says , if you learn a_few secrets . Secret No . 1 : Beginners look spastic . The lesson begins on flat ground . My front leg is strapped to my board . My back leg remains free to provide push . Learning to walk in this way , I stumble and slip , arms waggling . Mike and Don suffer a likewise fate . &quot; Don ' t worry , &quot; Bruce assures us , smiling . He smiles a lot . &quot; You ' re doing fine. &quot; Next he teaches us to fall , curling into a ball and keeping our fists clenched to prevent broken wrists . The technique comes_in_handy as we wobble through a half-dozen practice slides . Secret No . 2 : The trick to snowboarding involves a delicate blend of balance , shifting hips and twisting shoulders . As I said , it ' s difficult to explain . We must lean perilously over the nose of our boards . The effort is made more harrowing by the fact that our feet are locked into place . Wherever the board goes , we go . And vice versa . When Bruce demonstrates , he looks surfer-cool with arms outstretched , tilting his body at supple angles against the force of gravity . When we try , Don collides with Mike and nearly wrecks his knee . Yet , minutes later , the four of us are riding the chairlift . &quot; Perfect day for learning , &quot; Bruce says . &quot; It ' s warm so the snow will be softer when you fall. &quot; He surfs cleanly off the lift while we struggle to stay upright . After such a shaky start , we strap our back feet onto our boards . It ' s time to go downhill . Secret No . 3 : Your butt gets as cold as an ice_cube . that ' s because you spend a good_deal of time lying on the snow , struggling to get_up . Our first slide-tumble down the bunny hill is pure slapstick , with every twist and spill imaginable . I shout . Mike mumbles . Don slaps his hat against the snow in frustration . At least the frozen ground produces a numbness that allows us to ignore multiple contusions that might otherwise send us to a soft chair in the lodge . At the bottom of the_hill , we encounter another beginner , a young_woman sitting near the lift . &quot; We all have the same look , &quot; she says . &quot; Like we ' ve been beaten. &quot; Mike tells her that his right buttock is particularly sore . She complains about her left side . My pain is equally distributed . We curse the madman who invented this sport -- Sherman Poppen of Muskegon , Mich . According to the people at Transworld Snowboarding magazine , Poppen developed a crude precursor to the snowboard in 1965 . His &quot; snurfer &quot; was fashioned of wood with a rope attached_to the nose . Riders held_on for dear life as they sailed downhill . Poppen sold a_million of these contraptions over the course of 15 years . Today ' s snowboards look high-tech by comparison . Their wooden cores are encased in sheets of aluminum or plastic and coated with fiberglass or Kevlar fabric . The edges are capped with metal for carving turns . Gone is the nose rope . And the boards are specialized , some stiff and narrow for high-speed slaloms , others wide and flexible for the kind of brazen acrobatics that make the sport look deadly . Secret No . 4 : Snowboarding is no more dangerous than skiing . that ' s according to an Australian study cited in a recent issue of Health magazine . I chant this , a mantra , throughout my first bumbling day . But another statistic interrupts . Snowboarding is a young_man ' s pursuit . Fran Richards of Transworld Snowboarding says that among the estimated 1.8 million boarders nationwide , the vast majority are under 20 . Such youth explains the sport ' s reputation for obnoxious devotees . &quot; We ' ve taken all_the 17-year-olds who were jerks on skis and we ' ve put them on snowboards , &quot; Richards says . Plenty of obnoxious skiers remain on the slopes , of course . And as the first generation of snowboarders matures , the sport has earned respect for its gracefully carved turns and balletic aerials , maneuvers learned through years of sometimes bruising experimentation . &quot; You guys can do that stuff , too , &quot; Bruce tells us at the lesson ' s end . &quot; Just keep at it. &quot; Mike nods . Stubbornness has got_the_best of him as he vows to return with his board the following morning . Don is already shuffling toward the lodge . Secret No . 5 : Those who snowboard and ski say snowboarding is harder to learn at first but easier to improve at thereafter . &quot; Once you ' re over the first-day hump , you can become an intermediate much more rapidly , &quot; Richards says . &quot; that ' s why the sport has taken off. &quot; So I , too , venture out a second day , allowing a wave of enthusiasm to mask the pain of battered muscles . On my first run , tempting fate and the laws of physics , I use scant experience to surf fast across the snow and end_up taking a hard fall . My legs twist in inhuman ways . My sunglasses fly through the air . My girlfriend , following on skis , scans the hillside for a medic . But I get_up . There is something to this sport , something beyond the repetitious humiliation and self-flagellation , something that keeps me going . And by midmorning , I ' m negotiating the intermediate slopes in a style that is upright , if not pretty . Even better , my butt stays warm . I am surviving . I am snowboarding . I know a_few secrets .</TEXT>
