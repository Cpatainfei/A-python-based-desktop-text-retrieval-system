   <TEXT> Who could be_better qualified to assess the Oscar contenders for best picture than a director and producer whose career has spanned most of the modern era of filmmaking ? Robert Wise picked_up his first Oscar nomination more_than a half-century ago , when his editing of the 1941 &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; was recognized by the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences . Wise , who entered the movie business in 1933 as an assistant editor at RKO , directed his first film , &quot; The Curse of the Cat People , &quot; in 1944 , and his 39th , &quot; Rooftops , &quot; in 1989 . His films , including &quot; West_Side Story &quot; ( 1961 ) and &quot; The Sound of Music &quot; ( 1965 ) , have won a total of 19 Oscars and 67 nominations . In an era when many directors find themselves typecast -- a predicament Steven Spielberg was in until &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; -- Wise can boast a tremendous number of genres to his credit . Among his other movies are &quot; The Set-Up &quot; ( 1949 ) , considered one of the best boxing films ever made ; &quot; The Day the Earth Stood Still &quot; ( 1951 ) ; &quot; Somebody Up There Likes Me &quot; ( 1956 ) ; &quot; I Want to Live &quot; ( 1958 ) ; &quot; The Haunting &quot; ( 1963 ) ; &quot; The Sand Pebbles &quot; ( 1966 ) and &quot; The Andromeda Strain &quot; ( 1971 ) . Still active at 79 , Wise hopes to make another film in Europe this summer . Pleading superstition , he declines to offer any details . During an interview at his Beverly Hills office , Wise , who served as president of the academy from August 1985 until August 1988 , said he is &quot; generally happy &quot; with the current state of filmmaking and cheered by the success of a number of films aimed at adult audiences . He is also gratified by the way the academy has selected its best picture nominees . &quot; We don ' t vote on what ' s the biggest picture budgetwise , or what is the biggest grosser , &quot; he said . * Question : Starting in alphabetical order , what was your reaction to &quot; The Fugitive &quot; ? Answer : I thought it was very well done , an excellent film . I was not aware of the director ( Andrew Davis , who made 1992 ' s &quot; Under Siege &quot; ) . I ' m not a big action-picture guy . But that train wreck in the beginning was an extraordinary piece of filmmaking , and he kept_up the cinematic style and the marvelous photography and the tension and the energy in it wonderfully well . * Q : Yet Davis was not nominated for best director . Doesn ' t it seem odd when the film is nominated but the director is overlooked ? A : It ' s very rare when that happens . I had a similar thing years ago with &quot; The Sand Pebbles , &quot; a film I did with Steve McQueen . I was nominated as producer for best picture , but I was not nominated for director . You ' re dealing with two different bodies . You ' ve got the directors ' branch ( which chooses the nominees for best director ) , and then you have the whole academy voting on best picture nominations . * Q : Should we infer from Robert Altman ' s nomination for best director that if the directors had made the best picture nominations , &quot; Short Cuts &quot; would have been included ? A : Yes , most directors would tie them together ( best picture and best director ) . * Q : Does the fact that &quot; The Fugitive &quot; was based on a TV series diminish its value ? A : I went_in expecting not to like it too_much because I sort of regretted that we were at such a point where we had to go_back and resurrect material from another medium in_order to make our films . But I guess if it ' s good material and it ' s excellently treated then it ' ll stand on its own . So_much to my surprise , I found myself quite caught_up and carried along with the film . There ' s more of those being done now , aren ' t there ( including &quot; Maverick , &quot; which Warner Bros . plans to release May 20 ) . I guess I ' m prejudiced ; we should come_up with new material . * Q : What about &quot; In the Name of the Father , &quot; which opened in limited release late in the year and was perhaps not as well known to academy members ? A : I ' m so pleased that it did take_off because it came_into the game very , very late . I thought it was beautifully done , beautifully acted . The shadings of it were just excellent , the ups and downs , the turns and twists . I think particularly the handling of the lead character ( played by Daniel Day-Lewis , nominated as best actor ) . He ' s had such contrasts all throughout his career , from &quot; My Beautiful Laundrette &quot; all_the way to &quot; A Room With a View &quot; -- I think they were almost back to back ( in 1985 ) , and you couldn ' t recognize him from one to the other . &quot; The Age of Innocence &quot; couldn ' t be more of a contrast to what he was playing in this . That certainly shows the tremendous range of his talent . * Q : Some people thought Day-Lewis might get nominated for &quot; The Age of Innocence , &quot; but he didn ' t . Is it possible to compare the two performances ? A : I thought his performance in &quot; The Age of Innocence &quot; was much more subdued . I didn ' t feel -- and this is something that is certainly not an actor ' s fault -- but I didn ' t feel the chemistry between Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer as strongly as some of the scenes would seem to call_for . There are personal chemistries that happen between actors and actresses . Usually people who do those roles don ' t test ( for them ) . Maybe they meet beforehand and they talk to one another , but you never really know what the chemistry between actors , especially a man and woman , is going_to be until you ' ve got them up_on the screen . * Q : People admired &quot; The Age of Innocence , &quot; but somehow did not feel passionate about it . Is that one of the reasons it didn ' t get nominated ? A : It could have been . Marty ( director Martin Scorsese ) did a fine job in re-creating the period . I think ( the absence of chemistry between the stars ) might have resulted in a less warm reception by the academy . I ' ve also heard that people thought it was a little too studied , with too_much emphasis on the detail of the period and the lifestyle . * Q : Getting_back to &quot; In the Name of the Father , &quot; were you surprised that Emma Thompson got a supporting actress nomination ? A : I was surprised . She ' s a fine actress and I think she handled the role well , but it was a very small and not overly colorful role . * Q : Does the fact that Thompson and Holly Hunter both got nominated in two different categories say something about the paucity of top actresses ? A : ( People in the industry ) keep talking_about getting roles in which a woman can carry a picture , but they don ' t seem to be coming_along . I remember years and years back when Box_Office magazine used to list every year the 10 leading box-office stars in the world , and they were usually all American , and it was not uncommon to have six men and four women as the top box-office draws . That whole ability for a woman to carry a picture is gone -- because of such an emphasis over the years on these action pictures . * Q : Speaking of strong women ' s roles , let ' s move_on to &quot; The Piano. &quot; A : I loved Jane Campion ' s idea and her script . The period it was set_in , and the characters , and the interplay and the plot . I thought it was so refreshing and new and different . I applaud her very much for that , as well as for her direction of the film , which I thought was just fine . But I was at a dinner_party the other night , and there were a_couple_of women -- people in the business -- who didn ' t like the picture at all . They thought it was so phony . I was so shocked and so surprised . My wife and I had been so caught_up in it . If I had any questions , I guess I might have questioned why Sam Neill would get himself into this kind of relationship , knowing that she was mute . The little_girl ( Oscar nominee Anna Paquin , who plays Holly Hunter ' s daughter ) was absolutely a knockout . Harvey Keitel was just excellent , too -- such a change of pace for him . And to turn_out to be that sympathetic in the end . When he first came_on , I thought , &quot; How ' s this going_to work ? &quot; * Q : But Keitel was not nominated . A : He had an awful lot of competition . It ' s always difficult when you get_down to making those nominations . I was just looking_back over the list I made ( before the nominations ) , and for best picture I had 11 films . Most of us make a list of maybe the top 10 or 12 or 15 . Then it ' s the winnowing down of that to five -- it ' s tough . You try to replay them in your mind . I think any five of those 11 I had there I would have been satisfied with . * Q : Of the five nominated pictures , &quot; The Piano &quot; is the only one with an erotic love scene . A : I don ' t recall any movie being nominated that had that degree of nudity that we had in &quot; The Piano , &quot; which I think is a step_forward , too , in terms of the assessment by the academy . * Q : &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; is of course the only other best picture nominee containing a love_story of sorts . What did you think_of that picture ? A : Once again a very unusual story -- maybe not quite the originality of &quot; The Piano &quot; -- and the sexiest film I ' ve seen , in a way , without having any sex in it . And that scene with the book ( when the housekeeper played by Emma Thompson and the butler portrayed by Anthony Hopkins gently wrestle over a romance novel he is reading but refrain_from actually making physical contact ) -- that ' s a very , very sexy scene . Of course , I ' m such a fan of Tony ' s ( whom Wise directed in the 1977 &quot; Audrey Rose &quot; ) . He has such a range . I thought the chemistry ( in both this picture and last year ' s Oscar-nominated &quot; Howards End &quot; ) was marvelous between Tony and Emma Thompson . They really mesh . * Q : And -- last , but of course not least -- &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; ? A : I was so pleased for Steven that it came_off so well . So many people have been wondering if he could make anything besides those wonderfully done entertainment pieces and take a serious subject_matter and do a top job . I thought he did an outstanding job . The way he chose to shoot it , in black_and_white , to make_it feel much more realistic and almost like shooting a newsreel -- he kept a sense of textured reality almost with a grain on it . If Steven had done_it in_color he certainly would have chosen a very , very subdued color . We don ' t see the real_world in as strong colors as we see on film . Sometimes in my films , I have to try to desaturate the color a little bit , to take a little of the Technicolor look_out of it -- because that is not real_life , either . I think the locations were outstanding , the care and attention taken with the sets and locations and the customs of the period . Some people objected to the color at the end , but it seemed right to me . If he ' d been actually shooting during the period ( of the Holocaust ) he ' d have been shooting in black_and_white . What he was saying ( with the use of color to show the surviving Schindler Jews ) was this is the modern day . Steven and his associates made very fine choices in the actors for all_the roles . I kept being impressed constantly by the look of the people in the crowds . They were obviously very carefully selected . * Q : What about the film ' s length ? A : The length didn ' t bother me . I was caught_up in it from the beginning , and it held me all_the way through . Pace is really interesting . If you can hook an audience in at the beginning and keep that hook in , you can go_for a long , long_time . * Q : &quot; Short Cuts &quot; was obviously a favorite of the directors ' branch . Why do you think it did not get a best picture nomination ? A : I thought it was a damn fine picture and very unusual . But it ' s a long film , once again , and kind of a downer . That might have worked against it . ( The absence of characters you could identify with ) might have militated against it . * Q : I assume &quot; Short Cuts &quot; made your list of the 11 top films of the year . What else was_on that list ? A : &quot; In the Line_of_Fire &quot; -- I thought it was right up there with &quot; The Fugitive. &quot; I would be hard_put to make a choice between the two of them . Another film I liked -- that a lot of people haven ' t felt that strongly about -- was &quot; Philadelphia. &quot; It ' s the first major movie to deal head-on with AIDS , and I had no objection to the script and the development of the story and the characters . Also , &quot; Much Ado About Nothing , &quot; &quot; Shadowlands &quot; and &quot; The Age of Innocence. &quot; * Q : Would you care to divulge how you voted ? A : No way . that ' s a criminal offense around the academy .</TEXT>
