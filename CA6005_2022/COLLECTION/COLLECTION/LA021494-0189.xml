   <HEADLINE> HAITI BLAST NOT SEEN DEEPENING FUEL SHORTAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A spectacular explosion that destroyed the capital ' s main center for contraband gasoline sales probably will not seriously worsen Haiti ' s fuel shortage from a U.N. embargo , diplomats said Sunday . They said smuggling of fuel from the neighboring Dominican_Republic has increased recently in defiance of the embargo imposed in an effort to force the army to let President Jean-Bertrand Aristide return to power . There was no indication of sabotage in the explosion late Saturday , which set_off a fire that destroyed buildings along half a block of Rue de Cesar in downtown Port-au-Prince . No casualties were reported , but authorities said Sunday that they could not be sure until the wreckage was searched . About a dozen soldiers guarded the site while firefighters sprayed water over the smoldering ruins . A number of warehouses , stores and at least one hotel were destroyed by the blaze , which lit_up a blacked-out stretch of the city . Tens of thousands of gallons of contraband gasoline and diesel_fuel were stored in the warehouses in 55-gallon drums , eight-gallon plastic containers and gallon jugs . Haiti ' s already impoverished economy has suffered from the fuel embargo imposed in October after military_leaders reneged_on an agreement to allow the return of Aristide . He was overthrown in a bloody coup in September , 1991 , after less than a year in power as the country ' s first freely elected president . The army has stockpiled gasoline in underground depots around the capital , but the fuel at the burned warehouses was the main source of sales to Haitian citizens . With normal importers observing the embargo , Haitians have been storing fuel in makeshift stockpiles throughout the capital . &quot; The embargo is the root cause of this catastrophe , &quot; said Carl Denis , head of the far-right National Coalition , which wants to suspend the constitution and hold new presidential elections to replace Aristide .</TEXT>
