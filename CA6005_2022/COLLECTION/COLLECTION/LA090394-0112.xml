   <HEADLINE> SUSPECT IN ROSA PARKS ' ROBBERY CASE RECOGNIZED HER , POLICE SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A man accused of breaking_into civil_rights pioneer Rosa Parks ' house did not know she lived there , but recognized her once inside , police said Friday . &quot; He said : ' Aren ' t you Rosa Parks ? ' She said , ' Yeah , ' and he went_ahead and robbed her anyway , &quot; Detroit Police Investigator Daniel Budz said . Joseph Skipper , 28 , was arraigned Friday on three charges : two counts of breaking and entering and unarmed robbery , and one count of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny . The charges involve three alleged burglaries of elderly women ' s homes . Magistrate Margaret E . Baylor entered a plea of not_guilty for Skipper , who faces_up to 15 years in prison on the charges , and ordered him held_on $ 150 # 000 bond . Skipper also had an outstanding $ 5 # 000 bond for failing to appear in court in July on a charge he had broken_into a church on Christmas_Day . Skipper declined comment outside the courthouse . A preliminary hearing was scheduled for Sept . 13 . Parks , 81 , was beaten Tuesday and robbed of $ 53 . She was treated at a hospital and released several hours later . Assistant prosecutor Tim Kenny said Skipper has confessed to breaking_into Parks ' house as well as the homes of a 78-year-old woman and an 84-year-old woman . Skipper ' s mother , Lula Skipper , said jail might be the best place for her son . &quot; I want him to get better and get_off the drugs , but it ' s going_to take time for him to get straightened_out , &quot; she said . But police are worried that jail could be dangerous for Skipper , who already faced an angry mob when he was arrested because of the alleged assault on the revered civil_rights figure . &quot; They tried beating him up_on the street . You can imagine what they ' ll try to do_in jail , &quot; Budz said . Skipper was escorted to and from the court by two Detroit police_officers and was being kept_away from others at the Wayne County Jail , Budz said . He declined to say whether Skipper has been threatened . Parks helped launch the civil_rights movement in 1955 when she refused to give_up her seat on a bus to a white_man . She has lived_in Detroit since 1957 .</TEXT>
