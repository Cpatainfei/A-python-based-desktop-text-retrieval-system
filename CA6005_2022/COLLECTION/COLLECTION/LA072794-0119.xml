   <TEXT> Authorities late Tuesday were searching for a middle-aged woman who was said to be fashionably attired , carried a Harrods shopping_bag and drove a gray Audi -- and whose trunk carried a bomb that exploded outside the Israeli Embassy here and injured more_than a dozen people . Early today , a second car_bomb exploded outside a building housing Jewish organizations in north London , the Associated Press reported , injuring five slightly . The first blast , which came hours after Jordan and Israel signed an accord in Washington ending their 46-year state_of_war , occurred shortly after noon in front of the embassy in the busy Kensington section of West London . Windows were shattered in a wide area by the explosion . Four members of the Royal_Family were in nearby Kensington Palace , where windows were broken : Princess Margaret ; the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester , and Princess Michael of Kent . All were uninjured . Princess Diana , who also lives there , was vacationing in Spain . While no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , in Washington , blamed Islamic terrorists , saying they were trying to wreck the Middle_East peace process . He said the world should wake_up to the danger posed by terrorists , declaring : &quot; There is no doubt in my mind we face a wave of extreme Islamic radical terrorist movements in the Arab Muslim countries . They have infrastructure all_over the world. &quot; He cited the July 18 Buenos Aires blast , which left at least 96 people dead in a building that housed several of that city ' s Jewish organizations ; at least 29 people were killed in a bomb attack on the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992 . Israel has suggested that Iran may have been involved in both incidents . Fears of a worldwide terrorist campaign to disrupt the Mideast peace process also intensified Tuesday with Panamanian officials ' announcement that a commuter plane crash last week that killed 21 people , more_than half of them Jews , was caused by a bomb . In London , the last anti-Israeli attack occurred in 1982 -- the attempted assassination of Ambassador Shlomo Argov outside a hotel on Park Lane ; that incident disabled him and helped prompt the Israeli invasion of Lebanon . Tuesday ' s blast was heard as far as eight miles away around central and western London . Victims -- some cut by flying glass , others in shock -- received quick assistance from firefighters at Kensington station around the corner from the explosion site . There were no reported fatalities , and the final tally of the injured was put at 13 in some news service accounts , 14 in others . The blast was felt at the nearby Royal Albert Hall , where a ticket-seller remarked : &quot; It was such a loud bang , we all thought it must have gone_off right outside . It was terrifying . The whole building shook. &quot; The Israeli Embassy is_on Kensington Palace Gardens , a tree-shaded , semiprivate street that is home to several other major diplomatic facilities , including the Russian Embassy . The north-south street has gates -- generally open during the day -- and police checkpoints at both ends . Authorities were investigating what appeared to be a serious lapse of security . British police guard the checkpoints at the end of the street ; the Israeli Embassy has its own security_guards at the entrance . Nevertheless , the woman -- whom Police Cmdr . David Tucker described as having long hair and being of &quot; Mediterranean appearance &quot; -- managed to park her car next to the embassy and walk away . The guards even got a good look_at her , although authorities insisted that the woman did not attract attention to herself . Police said they were preparing to examine her car when the explosion occurred . &quot; One office ( in the embassy ) was completely wrecked , and the main stairway has collapsed , &quot; said Rachel Gordon , Israeli Embassy press officer . &quot; There are four floors and it seems like the roof and ceiling on the fourth floor have also collapsed. &quot; Steve Partridge , who was 20 yards away when the bomb exploded , said : &quot; The street was_full of bits of vehicle . It felt_like bits of glass were flying everywhere . All the windows in the surrounding buildings were smashed out. &quot; Partridge , who served with the_British Army in Northern_Ireland , estimated the bomb to contain about 30 pounds of explosives , which was confirmed later by police . The second blast occurred at 12:46 a.m. today outside Belfour House in the north Finchley area , eight miles north of the Israeli Embassy , police said . The building houses Israeli and Jewish organizations , including the Joint Israel Appeal , a charity fund-raising group that supports causes in Israel and in Britain ' s Jewish community . Mike Whine , a director of the Board of Deputies of British Jews , said after the first blast that he was shocked and horrified -- but not surprised -- by the attack . He said he thought it likely that Middle Eastern terrorists were responsible and said it was possible there was a link to the bombing of the Jewish community headquarters in Buenos Aires . &quot; We ' re already at a fairly high state of alert , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re in constant touch with police. &quot; He said the board had asked police to ban parking outside Jewish buildings but were still waiting for a response . Abdul Kader , a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization in London , declared : &quot; Our first impression is that this could have been the same people that carried_out the bombing in Buenos Aires and that they are carrying_out a series of bomb attacks . I can be certain they are not Palestinians . Even those Palestinians who are against the peace agreement have pledged not to take any action like this. &quot;</TEXT>
