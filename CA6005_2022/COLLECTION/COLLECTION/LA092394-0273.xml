   <HEADLINE> EL TORO AIRPORT FINANCING PLAN OUTLINED ; DEVELOPMENT : $ 4 BILLION IN CONSTRUCTION COSTS CAN BE FINANCED BY SELLING BONDS TO INVESTORS , PROPONENTS SAY . OPPONENTS SAY TAXPAYERS BE AFFECTED NONETHELESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The debate about the plan to build a commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station continued Thursday at a forum where experts discussed the issue in detail for the first time , including ways to finance the project . The experts ' reports were followed by a spirited panel debate . They fielded questions from a group of reporters and about 450 people who filled a hotel meeting room . The morning session , held across the street from John Wayne Airport , was organized by a consortium of Orange County business groups . Billed as an &quot; unbiased , factual examination of the issues , &quot; the forum did little to change the minds of most attendees , who apparently had already staked out positions on Measure A , an initiative on the November ballot that would require a commercial airport at El Toro when the Marines vacate the base in 1999 . Opponents of the initiative pointed_out that three of the seven business groups sponsoring the discussion have already endorsed the measure . * Still , those present heard for the first time an explanation of how proponents of the civilian airport expect to pay the estimated $ 4-billion construction cost . Michael Patrick George , western regional director of P . Morgan &amp; Co. , said the airport can be financed by selling bonds to private investors . One of the experts who spoke at the outset of the forum , he said local taxpayers would not be obligated to bail_out bondholders if the airport fails . &quot; The risk of development falls on those who invest in the bonds used to finance the airport . There clearly is enough demand in Orange County to service the debt , &quot; George said . Like supporters of Measure A , George said a new airport would generate a &quot; significant growth in business and jobs. &quot; However , David Celestin , a consultant and former vice_president of planning and governmental relations for the Mission Viejo Co. , challenged George , saying the multibillion-dollar project is too costly to be funded through the sale of bonds alone . He argued that county officials would have to help fund the project by raising developer fees and property_taxes , which ultimately would be paid by homeowners . &quot; On the surface , the proponents ' arguments make_sense : new jobs , more revenues , &quot; said Celestin , one of the panelists , who answered questions from reporters and the audience . But Celestin said the trade-off would be &quot; higher taxes , lower property values , noise_pollution and unsafe skies , &quot; because a civilian airport at El Toro would be eight miles from John Wayne Airport . &quot; Who ' s to say an alternative use ( other_than an airport ) would n ' t provide more opportunity for more jobs and more revenues , &quot; Celestin said . The El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , the county agency studying how the 4 # 700-acre base should be developed once the Marines depart , is considering several alternatives , including a commercial airport . The study will not be completed until June , 1995 . Earlier this year , a coalition of business and political_leaders placed on the ballot an initiative that would require the county to build a commercial airport on 2 # 000 acres at El Toro . Supporters say a new airport would create 21 # 645 jobs in Orange County and generate $ 170 million annually for local_governments . Opponents of Measure A have complained that the county ' s special planning authority for El Toro is the only one recognized by the Defense_Department and have attacked sponsors of the initiative for &quot; planning through the ballot box. &quot; The Defense_Department is not obligated to give_up the property to the county under the base closure law . The Pentagon will have to endorse any development plan drawn_up by the planning authority , and there are questions about whether the Defense_Department would even recognize Measure A ' s mandate . The bickering over the initiative versus the conventional planning process continued at Thursday ' s forum . Bill Vardoulis , a former Irvine mayor and member of the planning authority , said the county agency is &quot; attempting to build a consensus &quot; in Orange County on the development of the Marine base . &quot; We ( opponents and supporters of Measure A ) all have the same goal in mind , to maximize the use of that property , &quot; Vardoulis said . Chapman University President James L . Doti , who supports a commercial airport at El Toro , responded that the nine-member county agency -- composed of the supervisors , three Irvine council_members , including Vardoulis , and a Lake Forest council_member -- is biased because five members oppose the airport . &quot; I ' m not afraid of democracy , but a better approach would be to let the market decide , &quot; Doti said . &quot; If we fail to capture El Toro , we will be placing a cap &quot; on Orange County ' s economic_growth . * Earlier , he said that if an airport were built at El Toro , the undeveloped land around it could be used for other enterprises , including low-cost housing . Celestin scoffed at Doti ' s comment , arguing that zoning laws would then require the surrounding development to be compatible with the airport . Janice M . Mittermeier , director of John Wayne Airport , said a consulting_firm hired by the county planning agency will study whether the Marine base can and should be converted to a commercial airport . If the county authority chooses an airport for the site , then officials will have to decide whether it should be used primarily to handle passengers , international cargo , long_hauls or short hauls , or some combination of cargo and passengers . &quot; We will also look_at the cost_analysis and how much revenue an airport would generate , &quot; Mittermeier said . But Vardoulis warned that the federal_government can still throw the county ' s plans for El Toro into a tizzy if the Irvine Co . and the U.S. Department_of_the_Interior go_ahead with a proposed land swap . Under a plan that is being discussed by both sides , the Irvine Co . would gain control of El Toro in exchange for thousands of acres it owns in northern Orange County , bordering the Cleveland National Forest , which the company would deed to the Interior_Department . Vardoulis said federal agencies have first claim on military bases that are being closed . He said the Interior_Department would have to submit a request to the Pentagon for El Toro by Dec . 1 . &quot; If the Department of Interior request is approved , everything will go_away , &quot; Vardoulis said .</TEXT>
