   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : RESPITE FOR INVESTORS ; YIELDS EDGING DOWN SLOWLY WHILE STOCKS RECOUP LOSSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a dismal winter and early spring , financial markets have taken a surprising turn for the better in recent weeks . Without much fanfare , many investors are seeing their stock and bond assets rise in value once again , if at a snail ' s pace : * Bonds have been slowly appreciating as market yields have edged lower , after rocketing almost nonstop since late January . The 30-year Treasury_bond yield , the benchmark for long-term interest_rates , has dropped to 7.26 % now , after surging from 6.35 % at year ' s end to a peak of 7.65 % on May 9 . Yields on some_other types of bonds , such_as tax-free municipal issues , have fallen even faster than Treasury rates . * The stock_market , taking a cue from bonds , has rallied modestly since mid-May , raising hopes for the proverbial &quot; summer rally &quot; on Wall_Street . The blue_chip Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index , which slumped 5.2 % between Jan . 1 and May 9 , has gained 3.6 % since . And the Dow Jones industrial average , 3 # 755.91 at Tuesday ' s close , has recouped all_of its losses and now is slightly above its year-end close of 3 # 754.09. The credit for the markets ' healthier tone , of course , goes largely to the same entity responsible_for driving investors into a selling frenzy earlier in the year : the Federal_Reserve_Board . The Fed ' s decision to begin tightening credit on Feb . 4 , for the first time in five years , was the equivalent of yelling &quot; Fire ! &quot; in a crowded movie_theater . By raising short-term interest_rates from 30-year lows , the Fed in_effect booted speculators out of the stock and bond markets , and focused bond owners on the idea that the economy was growing fast enough to reignite inflation , bonds ' No . 1 fear . But just four months after the Fed ' s policy shift , the central_bank ' s principal goal -- to slow the economy to a moderate pace , with low inflation -- appears to have been achieved . Or at least that ' s what the Fed apparently believes . In public and private statements over the past few weeks , Fed officials have strongly projected the idea that they ' re satisfied with their policy and now are comfortable leaving short-term interest_rates alone for the foreseeable future . On Wall_Street , the promise of a benign Fed has proved to be a powerful tonic . A key moment for the markets occurred last Friday , when the government reported a sharp drop_in the May unemployment_rate , but stock and bond markets failed to view the report as a reason to resurrect old worries about excessive growth and inflation . Bond yields actually edged lower on Friday . With the Fed ' s recent soothing tone , &quot; the market is accepting that these yields ( on bonds ) are appropriate for the likely events in the economy &quot; in the near-term , says Kevin Logan , economist at Swiss Bank Corp . in New York . Peter Anderson , president of money manager IDS Advisory Group in Minneapolis , notes that the market isn ' t just taking the Fed at its word . Despite the puzzling unemployment report , many of the economic indicators of late have suggested &quot; that the economy is slowing just a tad , &quot; Anderson notes . In addition , the bond market has been helped by other factors , Anderson says . A plunge in grain and soybean prices over the past week , as much-needed rain fell on the Midwest , has helped further reduce inflation worries . And a strengthening dollar has given foreign investors new incentive to buy U.S. bonds and stocks . * But everyone knew bond yields would stabilize eventually . The big question now is whether they can continue to fall . Many experts don ' t expect a sharp decline in yields from current levels . More likely is that yields will trade_in a narrow range for at least a_few months , until it ' s clear that the economy is either slowing further , accelerating again or continuing to grow at the same moderate pace . Swiss Bank ' s Logan , for example , figures the 30-year Treasury_bond yield , now 7.26 % , will bounce between 7.1 % and 7.6 % this summer as traders push the market to and fro , alternately starting rallies and then selling into them . William Gross , a principal at bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co . in Newport Beach , figures the T-bond yield range this summer will be 7 % to 7.5 % . &quot; There ' s probably not going_to be a lot of excitement in the bond market relative to what we ' ve seen &quot; in recent months , Gross says . For many bond investors , a lack of excitement would be welcome , after the losses incurred in the market in winter and early spring . But experts also caution investors to use this period of relative calm to assess whether they should stay in bonds . If the economy booms again later this year or in 1995 , interest_rates could surge anew , causing more principal losses for bond owners . Investors who don ' t want to take that risk should view the current rally as a way_out , investment_advisers say . Opportunists and long-term investors , however , may want to take a different approach : Which bonds offer the best value today , if you figure the economy is sure to slow a bit more or remain on a moderate-growth track ? Many bond pros say the high-yield &quot; junk &quot; corporate_bond market is a good bet , because junk yields haven ' t yet dropped_in line with yields on Treasury_bonds since mid-May -- even though junk_bonds ' fundamentals are solid . &quot; I think the high-yield market is in great shape , &quot; says Frederick Cavanaugh , manager of the John Hancock Strategic Income fund in Boston . For a simpler bet , Pacific Investment Management ' s Gross says investors should look_at intermediate-term Treasury securities . The yield on five-year T-notes , for example , is 6.52 % now . At that level , Gross says , the market is already assuming that between now and the end of the year , the Fed will raise short-term interest_rates another full percentage_point . Gross doubts the economy will be strong enough to justify that kind of move . What about stocks ? David Shulman , strategist at Salomon Bros. , thinks the market will see its traditional summer rally if interest_rates stay tamed . He expects the Dow to near its all-time high of 3 # 978 . But the leaders in a summer rally , like the leading stock groups so far this year , will be an eclectic mix , Shulman says ; names like Microsoft , Georgia-Pacific and Unocal are_on his list . Anderson of IDS says the most logical stock_market bet now is a replay of the last two years , in condensed version : Bank and other financial stocks have already rallied over the past month , he notes , as bond yields have fallen . The next move , Anderson says , should be in some of the economy-sensitive stocks that have been beaten_down since winter -- autos , retailers and airlines , for example . If the Fed has succeeded in stretching_out the economic recovery at a moderate pace , investors should be drawn_back to stocks of auto_makers and other companies whose &quot; peak &quot; recovery earnings may be years away , he says . Better Times for Stocks and Bonds ? The bond market ' s rally in recent weeks has raised hopes that long-term interest_rates are about to pull_back sharply from their recent highs , which also could give a further lift to stocks .
