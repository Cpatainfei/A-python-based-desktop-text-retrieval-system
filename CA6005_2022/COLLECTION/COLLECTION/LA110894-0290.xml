   <HEADLINE> INDONESIAN LABOR_LEADER GETS 3-YEAR PRISON_TERM ; ASIA : OFFICIAL ALLEGEDLY INCITED WORKER VIOLENCE . CLINTON TO DISCUSS HUMAN_RIGHTS ON UPCOMING VISIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A week before a state visit by President Clinton , an Indonesian court Monday sentenced the leader of the country ' s largest independent labor_union to three years in prison for allegedly inciting workers to violence earlier this year . Muchtar Pakpahan was the fourth senior official of the Indonesian Prosperous Labor_Union to be sentenced to prison in connection with riots in the Sumatran city of Medan in April . Another 10 union leaders remain on_trial for fomenting the disturbances , which left one ethnic Chinese factory owner dead and caused extensive property damage before being suppressed by army troops . A statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta said the Clinton_Administration regrets Pakpahan ' s conviction . &quot; We believe that he should not be held accountable for unintended violence in connection with protests over legitimate labor demands , &quot; it said . Winston Lord , the assistant secretary_of_state for East Asian and Pacific affairs , acknowledged last week that the United States and Indonesia &quot; have problems in the human_rights area &quot; and said Clinton plans to discuss them with Indonesia ' s President Suharto on Nov . 16 during a state visit . Clinton will be in Indonesia , the largest country in Southeast_Asia , next week attending a summit of leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) group . The leaders are expected to adopt steps making the Asian region a free_trade area early in the next century , but the Americans have ruled_out discussing labor issues at the meeting . Last week , a group of 74 members of Congress called_on Clinton to use his talks with the 73-year-old Suharto , who like many Javans uses only one name , to discuss &quot; severe labor rights violations &quot; in the country . The Suharto regime has been accused recently of abandoning a policy of relative openness and cracking_down on dissent and freedom_of_the_press . Three of the country ' s most popular newspapers were closed earlier this year after printing articles considered embarrassing to the government . In a statement issued before Pakpahan ' s conviction , the human_rights group Amnesty International called_on the United States to issue a clear declaration stressing the importance of human_rights in its relations with Asian_nations . The Administration was widely chided in June for bowing to Chinese threats and granting Beijing renewed most-favored-nation trade status despite a renewed crackdown on human_rights activists . &quot; Amnesty International is concerned that the pre-APEC crackdown has resulted in serious human_rights violations , including : the arbitrary arrest , and in some cases , torture and ill-treatment , of political_detainees ; the unfair trial and arbitrary imprisonment of labor activists and workers , and the unlawful execution of alleged criminals , &quot; the group said . Amnesty said it was particularly concerned about the use of special police_forces to arrest people in Jakarta in an effort to spruce_up the capital ' s image before the APEC meeting . While APEC officials will hold talks in Jakarta , Suharto has invited Clinton and leaders from 17 Asian_countries to hold a retreat with him next Tuesday in the foothill resort of Bogor , 30 miles to the south . The U.S. Embassy said the conviction of Pakpahan would be one element that will be taken into consideration as the Administration deliberates whether to revoke Indonesia ' s trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences ( GSP ) . The benefits cover about $ 650 million worth of trade , or 14 % of Indonesian goods shipped to the United States . The U.S. trade representative is investigating charges that Indonesia denies its workers the right to freedom of association . If the charges are upheld , the Administration can revoke the GSP benefits . But the Administration has placed the investigation on hold since August , ostensibly while a &quot; dialogue &quot; is taking_place on the controversy . Labor groups have accused the Administration of seeking to avoid embarrassing Suharto before the APEC meeting , which the Indonesian leader is said by diplomats to regard_as his defining moment as a statesman . The court convictions in Medan appear to deal a life-threatening blow to the free labor_movement in Indonesia . Union officials said that their operations have been severely curtailed since Pakpahan ' s arrest and that the group ' s 350 # 000 members have been afraid to express themselves . Pakpahan has denied inciting the workers to violence . At the time of the strike in Medan in April , he was in eastern Java .</TEXT>
