   <HEADLINE> TRAGEDY IN RWANDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a Tutsi , I am troubled and shocked that the world stood_by and watched almost 1 million of my people perish at the hands of Hutu troops and government-trained militias . For almost three months , the United Nations and the United States debated whether to characterize the killings in Rwanda as genocide , that way avoiding the responsibility imposed on the signatories of the 1951 Genocide Convention , which calls_for the apprehension and prosecution of war_criminals . All of a sudden , now we see the United Nations , the United States and its European allies jump_on the bandwagon to save the cholera-ridden Hutu refugees in Zaire and Tanzania . While I am not opposed to humanitarian aid , I am concerned that the donors , in attempting to redress their guilt for having not acted faster , thus saving millions of lives , are aiding the very people that planned and executed the genocide of my people . Yet , nobody talks_of the millions of displaced people inside Rwanda who are suffering horrendous physical as well as psychological wounds . And let us not forget that these refugees fled Rwanda at the behest of their leaders who are seeking to establish a diaspora from which to recruit an army to fight their way back to power . Ample evidence exists to apprehend former Rwanda government officials and military_officers in the refugee camps who continue to spread messages of hate against the Tutsi . Action must be taken now before the evidence dissipates and memories fade . Until justice is done , we Tutsi will neither forgive nor forget . And though small be our numbers , resolve will be our drive and justice our rallying cry . WILLIS SHALITA San Francisco * Re &quot; Rwanda Relief Groups to Help Fittest Survive , &quot; July 31 : Shades of new-Malthusian darkness ! So , in this day , is the fitness of a human_being to be determined by an ability to walk 50 miles , over rough terrain , in illness and in need ? Is suffering to become the new measure of the worthiness of a person ? Then surely the Holocaust was good , AIDS is a boon and the Mother Teresas of this world are working against humanity . ASHWANI VASISHTH Los Angeles * In his Aug . 1 commentary on Rwanda , Richard Walden , president of Operation USA , misportrays the massive and immediate response by the U.S._government to the grave humanitarian situation in Rwanda . Our government , reflecting the compassion of the American people , has dedicated more_than $ 500 million of U.S._government funds and the expertise of military and emergency relief personnel to meeting the crisis . The explosion of Rwandan refugees , their numbers greater than the city of San Francisco , occurred in six days . This is the largest and most rapid migration of people that the international relief community has faced in this generation . The U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) has had its disaster assessment and response teams in the field -- and they have been fully operational -- since the earliest stages of the refugee crisis . The U.S._government funded Red_Cross efforts in Rwandan even after U.S. personnel were evacuated for security reasons following the coup . Any direct intervention in the Rwanda crisis at that point , other_than through our support of private voluntary organizations , would have necessitated U.S. military involvement in an ongoing civil_war . This kind of military intervention in a &quot; hot &quot; conflict would have placed the lives of American military_personnel directly at risk . Wisely , neither the Clinton_Administration , Congress or the American public supported such a move . USAID , working with the World Food Program , has diverted emergency food relief to Rwanda from supplies held elsewhere in Africa . These supplies were taken from surplus stocks and not out of the hands of hungry people . The World Food Program will replace the African commodities shipped to Rwanda ; not to have diverted these supplies to Rwanda would have meant starvation and death for untold numbers . USAID ' s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance remains the premier disaster relief organization in the world . Its extraordinary performance under the most difficult of circumstances at disasters sites throughout the developing world speaks_for itself . J . BRIAN ATWOOD , Administrator USAID , Washington The writer was President Clinton ' s special envoy to Rwanda . * As the mother of a young soldier being deployed to Rwanda , via Goma , Zaire , your article of Aug . 3 concerns me a great_deal . I understand the Rwandan people need help , but to say security for our troops is a concern but not a problem is quite an understatement . When does_it become a problem ? Maybe when some of our troops are killed ? Your article says we have 98 troops in Goma , living_in tents near a crowded road with no protection other_than a concertina wire and that most of our soldiers go unarmed and none wear flak vests . It doesn ' t sound like anyone has much concern for their safety . I don ' t want to see any of our soldiers ' dead_bodies dragged around like one was in Somalia . PAT HISLAR Los Angeles</TEXT>
