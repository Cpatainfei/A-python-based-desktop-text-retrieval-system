   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; LAND OF THE LIMPING -- QUAKE TAKES TOLL ON FEET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Throughout Los Angeles , there are hundreds , probably thousands , of them . Just look down and you ' ll see them -- the most common victims of the earthquake . Feet . Feet crushed by falling furniture . Feet slashed by shattered window glass or broken china . Feet fractured from panicky , pre-dawn leaps_out of bed . By far , the lowest appendages were the most vulnerable body_parts when the land underneath trembled . Hour after hour -- all day and all night Monday as well as Tuesday -- men , women and children hobbled into emergency_rooms leaning_on friends and family members . In most cases , they hobbled out again with a pair of crutches and their foot swathed in sterile white gauze , joining the walking -- make that limping -- wounded of Los Angeles . Many Angelenos learned the hard way the rule_of_thumb in case of earthquake : Always keep shoes or slippers at the foot of the bed . Those with slashed tendons or shattered ankle bones will be disabled for weeks , maybe months . Among them are Gunner Johnson , 33 , of Hollywood , who suffered a severed tendon in a toe when an antique china_cabinet fell on him . Shellie Blackson , 23 , of the Pico-Fairfax area , stepped_on broken glass and split her foot open as she scrambled out of bed in the dark . As blood gushed , a friend remembered his first-aid training and fashioned a makeshift tourniquet , then rushed her to Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center on the Westside . Beverly Lucia , 29 , of Canyon Country was trying to find a flashlight when she sliced her foot on broken glass . &quot; I didn ' t feel anything until I got_to my neighbor ' s house and turned_around and saw a trail of blood behind me , &quot; Lucia said as she waited for her foot to be sewn up at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia . In most cases , the sprained ankles and torn tendons are minor and can be treated quickly . In some more serious cases of foot and leg injuries , surgeons are so busy that patients are being told to come_back in a_few days . Johnson and Blackson needed tendon operations , but they had to make_do with a temporary repair job of stitches and crutches . Even on Tuesday , the wounded kept limping in by the hundreds . Some did not seek aid Monday but when their feet or ankles swelled , they sought help Tuesday and found emergency_rooms clogged with others just like them . At Northridge Hospital Medical_Center , several hundred patients were undergoing triage in a parking_lot and waiting hours for their wounds to be examined and sutured . * In the hours after the quake , the first patients who rushed into the emergency_room at Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center had suffered alarming problems such_as heart_attacks , said nurse Paul Johnson . But many of the 200 or so patients who followed during the initial 12 hours suffered lacerations on their feet and legs or sprained ankles , he said . The busiest health_care workers were those equipped with needle and thread or manning the X-ray_machines . An emergency_room doctor wearing tennis_shoes kept dashing out_to the waiting room at Cedars-Sinai repeating the same diagnosis : &quot; Good news ! It ' s not broken. &quot; * Laura Record , 24 , of Los Angeles was relieved to hear that . Her sprained ankle was sort of a silly injury , Record said , describing how she jumped up as the quake rocked her home , slipped_on a comforter and slid across the wood floor . &quot; It was sheer panic , &quot; she said . Officials said that a leg or hip fracture can become critical if the victim is young or old . One victim of a leg fracture was 23 days old . &quot; Especially in an elderly patient , a broken bone compounded by this extraordinary excitement has to be viewed_as a life-threatening event , &quot; said Ron Wise , a spokesman at Cedars-Sinai .</TEXT>
