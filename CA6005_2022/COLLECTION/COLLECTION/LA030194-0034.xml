   <HEADLINE> O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS ; SELLING_OUT AT THE BOWERS ; EXHIBIT IS LARGELY OF UNMEMORABLE WORKS -- THAT THE OWNER WANTS TO PEDDLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Any art_exhibition on a sweeping historical theme that is based entirely on one private collection is bound to be a disappointment . It inevitably has more to do with personal taste than historical breadth , and it cannot seriously compete with a show compiled by an art_historian from the resources of major institutions . But when a museum show consists entirely of works that are for_sale at one commercial gallery -- as is the case with the &quot; Seven Decades : Modern Mexican Art From the Bernard Lewin Collection , &quot; at the Bowers Museum through April 25 -- disappointment gives_way to disgust . When Lewin -- who also owns a massive personal collection of Mexican art -- decided to limit the scope of this show to the stuff he ' d like to sell , the die was cast . Not even the museum ' s decision to turn curatorial duties over to Shifra M . Goldman , a research associate at the Latin_American Study Center at UCLA and a professor of art history at Rancho Santiago College , can redeem such a colossal commercial- cum -vanity showcase . Lewin , a former furniture retailer who opened his first art_gallery 26 years ago in Beverly Hills , was initially attracted to Mexican art by the paintings of Rufino Tamayo , a European-influenced artist whom the dealer has called &quot; the most compelling force in my quest to promote the Mexican masters. &quot; It probably won ' t come as a surprise that this is not a show about major works of Mexican modern art . With some exceptions , the 74-piece show contains a raft of unmemorable paintings , drawings , prints and sculpture . It is the sort of work that is marketable to the American middle_class because of its &quot; universal &quot; -- read soothingly traditional -- subject_matter . Major artists are represented by minor work -- often made years after their major achievements -- and most of the minor artists seem very minor indeed . Goldman ' s approach to the impossible task of turning the idiosyncratic contents of a gallery into a meaningful exhibition was to organize aesthetic and social developments in Mexican art into four categories : pre-1920 precursors of modernism ; the era of public art and social realism ( 1920s-1940s ) ; international styles adapted by artists active from the late 1920s to the present ; and a nebulous category Goldman calls &quot; new images , new directions , &quot; which seems anything but . This overview was a reasonable tactic , but it lets too many details get lost by the wayside , and viewers are frequently hard_put to comprehend how the works they see fit within the context of Mexican political and cultural history , or even the artists ' careers . The strongest intertwining strains in 20th-Century Mexican art -- a passion for digging_up indigenous roots , social militancy and a penchant for the fantastic -- can be traced back to the earliest artists in the show , Gerardo Murillo ( a.k.a. Dr. Atl ) and Jose Guadalupe Posada . The other major strain -- indebtedness to European modernism , particularly Surrealism and Neoclassicism -- all too often comes_off as a flaccid , derivative enterprise , devoid_of the conviction that animates the best social realist work . Atl , whose labored colored drawings of volcanoes reflected his scientific interests , took his adopted surname from the Nahuatl language . He insisted that Mexican artists develop national themes instead of leaning_on European subjects . Posada , a former farm laborer , protested social conditions and political crises in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with grotesque caricatures that reached a broad audience in cheap reproductions . ( Unfortunately , the three small -- and unusually tame -- Posada prints in this show are presented without any discussion. ) Any museum show is obliged to underplay the strength of Mexico ' s great muralists , whose major works are not portable . But Diego Rivera gets truly short_shrift here : a trio of unremarkable portraits of now-obscure sitters , including American artist Ralph Stackpole , whose relationships to the artist are not discussed . The sampler of work by Jose Clemente Orozco is of greater interest . A 1935 caricature of &quot; Tourists and Aztecs &quot; skewers broad-shouldered Ugly Americans averting their glances from a ragged group of diminutive , ailing Mexicans . Decadent images of sprawling , dancing prostitutes in an undated lithograph that owes a major stylistic debt to German Expressionism ( &quot; Women &quot; ) would become compelling symbols of the decay of civilization in such Orozco murals as &quot; Catharsis &quot; at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico_City ( reproduced in a photograph ) . David Alfaro Siqueiros , the other member of the mural movement ' s &quot; los tres grandes , &quot; is represented by another potpourri : paintings from about 1930 and landscape studies from 1963 . The best is &quot; Mother and Child , &quot; in which the dead weight of a sleepy child contrasts with his mother ' s waltzing embrace in the confined space of a small room . Other well-known figures in the show include the incisive printmaker Leopoldo Mendez , draftsman-illustrator Jose Luis Cuevas , and a trio of modernists -- Francisco Zuniga , Carlos Merida , and Tamayo -- who borrowed indigenous motifs , mostly from pre-Columbian art . Co-founder in 1937 of the influential Taller de Grafica Popular ( popular graphic_art workshop ) , Mendez packed a_few square_inches of paper with a bristling rhythm of blacks_and_whites to evoke political and military brutality . In another mood , he cast a shrewd eye on the heavyweight artists of his time in &quot; God the Father and the Four Evangelists. &quot; Cuevas , whose delicate line inevitably describes the gnarliest of outcast types , is not seen at his best in this show , while the hackneyed , academic flavor of Zuniga ' s drawings and bulbous bronze unfortunately seem quite in character . Merida , a stylistic chameleon , is most appealing in a 1921 painting that evokes a ritualistic aura with tight geometric patterning and vivid coloring . The Tamayos are mostly very minor or very late . &quot; Two Personages Attacked by Dogs &quot; -- an oversized print of a mannequin-like couple fleeing two stylized curs -- dates_from 1983 , decades after leading artists elsewhere had moved away from such Existentialist Angst . Images by other artists also indicate that dated styles have lingered overtime in Mexico . There is syrupy Neoclassicism , wispy Surrealism , vapid abstraction . Other_than Francisco Toledo , who draws upon his Oaxacan Indian heritage for a fantastic , scribbled vocabulary of creatures and mechanical objects , fresh voices in this show are hard to find . A viewer has no way to gauge whether Lewin simply doesn ' t like -- or doesn ' t think he can sell -- more cutting-edge art , or whether Mexico isn ' t producing any . You could say that this show is better than nothing , since we rarely get_to see modern Mexican art in Orange County . It might have been more focused had Goldman limited her selections to prints and drawings , which ( as she writes in the brochure ) have been &quot; overlooked , or treated with indifference , by more pretentious exhibitions. &quot; But it is unlikely that such a show -- hardly_a major drawing card for general viewers -- would have stirred_up the requisite hullabaloo . Once again , the venerable Bowers seems to be in the throes of a &quot; learning experience , &quot; perhaps exacerbated by the lack of an art curator on its large staff . But at least the lesson is clear-cut : Put scholarship first and do not shackle yourself to the whims and pecuniary interests of a collector if you want to be taken seriously as a venue for art_exhibitions . It ' s really not such a difficult concept , and it makes a world of difference . * &quot; Seven Decades : Modern Mexican Art from the Bernard Lewin Collection &quot; remains through April 25 at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art , 2002 N .
