   <TEXT> The nation ' s financial markets held steady Monday as investors marked time on the eve of the general_elections and an interest_rate hike widely expected next week . Stocks closed mixed , breaking last week ' s losing streak , when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more_than 123 points , or 3 % . On Monday , the Dow rose 1.35 points to 3 # 808.87. But declining issues still outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Big Board volume was a light 256.2 million shares , down from 282.7 million on Friday . Treasury_bond yields rose for a sixth consecutive session , with the benchmark 30-year bond closing at 8.16 % , up from Friday ' s 8.15 % . Its price , which moves lower when yields rise , slipped 3 / 32 point , or 94 cents per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . In the currency markets , worries about further dollar-buying action by the Federal_Reserve_System in the wake of last week ' s two-day intervention helped deter speculative attacks on the U.S. currency , market participants said . The dollar closed_in New York at 97.33 Japanese yen , down from 97.50 on Friday . The dollar was also changing hands in New York at 1.5163 German marks , up from 1.5156. There was little news to influence trading in the market . With the recent run-up in bond rates , strategists were nervous about the market ' s ability to digest the Treasury ' s sale of $ 17 billion in three-year notes today and $ 12 billion in 10-year notes Wednesday . Tight political races and the strong possibility of rising interest_rates sapped enthusiasm on Election_Day eve , analysts said . &quot; The elections are causing a little bit of caution on Wall_Street , &quot; said Walter Revis , market_analyst at Principal Financial Securities . &quot; The market hates uncertainty , and the polls are still going_back and forth. &quot; But politics were not the only thing on investors ' minds . The producer_price_index for October , set for release Thursday , and a meeting next Tuesday of the Federal Open Market Committee , which will weigh the central_bank ' s monetary policy against recent data on inflation , added tension , analysts said . There is widespread speculation that the Fed will raise interest_rates for a sixth time this year . Most analysts expect the Fed to opt_for an increase of 0.5 % in short-term interest_rates , but some say the central_bank could be more aggressive in its fight against inflation . &quot; People are a little skittish for a number of reasons , and they want to see the whites of their eyes before they decide to commit again , &quot; said James Volk , director of equity trading at Jensen Securities . Despite the recent batch of strong third-quarter earnings , the market has been unable to gather any upside momentum . Partly to blame is concern that rising interest_rates will cool the economy and lead analysts to lower their earnings forecasts for 1995 . &quot; The economy is going_on very well , but there ' s some thinking that we may be peaking here soon , &quot; said John Church , chief investment officer at Glenmede Trust Co . Stocks fell abroad . Sporadic corporate selling and arbitrage-linked sales sent Tokyo ' s 225-share Nikkei average down 192.34 points to 19 # 619.22. Frankfurt ' s 30-share DAX average closed_off 24.04 points at 2 # 043.52 , while London ' s Financial Times 100-share average ended down 31.8 points at 3 # 065.8. In Mexico_City , the Bolsa index drifted 6.71 points higher to 2.588.35. Among the market highlights : * IBM , Apple Computer and Motorola said they agreed on a new hardware platform design for computers based on the PowerPC chip . IBM ended_up 3 / 4 to 71 7 / 8 , and Apple added 3 / 8 to 40 3 / 4 , but Motorola lost 2 to 56 1 / 2 . * Chrysler fell 7 / 8 to 46 1 / 2 . There was market speculation that investor Kirk Kerkorian will begin selling his 9.2 % stake in the No . 3 auto_maker . * Snapple Beverage fell 3 / 16 to 13 5 / 8 . Quaker Oats last week made a $ 1.7-billion bid for the maker of fruit_drinks and iced_teas . * Nike rose 1 7 / 8 to 61 1 / 2 .
