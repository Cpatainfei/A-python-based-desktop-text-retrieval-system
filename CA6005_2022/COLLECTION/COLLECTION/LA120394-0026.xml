   <HEADLINE> QUEBEC SEPARATIST RECOVERING FROM KILLER BACTERIA ; CANADA : BOUCHARD ' S BRUSH WITH DEATH SPARKS SPECULATION ON FUTURE OF INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a medical struggle that enthralled Canada , doctors said Friday that they have saved the life of Quebec separatist leader Lucien Bouchard from a virulent , muscle-destroying bacteria that had forced the amputation of his left leg . &quot; He ' s not out of the woods , but nearly out of the woods , &quot; Dr. Patrick D ' Amico said of Bouchard , the opposition leader in the Canadian Parliament and widely regarded_as the country ' s most compelling advocate of Quebec independence . The infection was described as under_control and responding to antibiotics . Citing an 80 % mortality_rate from necrotizing myositis , the muscle-harming manifestation of the streptococcus A bacterium , D ' Amico and other members of the medical team that worked_on Bouchard called his survival &quot; almost a miracle. &quot; They said Bouchard , who turns 56 this month , could be out of Montreal ' s Saint Luc Hospital in three to four weeks and then would face about four months of physical_therapy and rehabilitation . The doctors said Bouchard had undergone three surgeries since Tuesday , two on his leg that included the amputation and another in his abdomen and chest area . Bouchard ' s brush with death and expected absence from the political scene triggered immediate speculation about the future of the Quebec independence movement . Bouchard shares leadership of the movement with Jacques Parizeau , the recently elected premier of Quebec . The two men were expected to reveal their strategy next week for winning a province-wide referendum on independence to be held next year . Bouchard and Parizeau were to be co-captains of the campaign in favor of a &quot; yes &quot; vote . Jean-Marc Leger , a top Quebec pollster , said Bouchard remains the most popular politician in the province , with appeal_to a broad demographic of French-speaking voters and to more moderate factions wary of Parizeau ' s intense nationalism . A Leger poll released Monday showed 45.7 % of Quebec voters in favor of independence -- or sovereignty , as it is most often described here -- and 54.3 % backing continued union with Canada . Max Nemni , a political_science professor at Laval University in Quebec_City and an expert in Quebec nationalism , said the courage and determination attributed to Bouchard by his doctors Friday could give a significant emotional boost to separatism . There are parallels to the political lift that then-President Ronald Reagan received after he survived an assassination attempt in March , 1981 , Nemni added . &quot; To a certain extent ( in an election campaign ) , images are more important than actions or words , &quot; Nemni said . &quot; Sympathy is going_to pour over Mr. Bouchard for quite some time for his bravery , etc . So I think that this will be a plus for the sovereigntists . . . . When you ' re dealing with nationalism , emotions are extremely important. &quot; One veteran separatist strategist made a similar observation . &quot; It ' s going_to be like Rocky , &quot; the strategist said , requesting anonymity . But Jeremy Webber , a law professor at McGill University in Montreal who also analyzes Quebec politics , disagreed . &quot; I don ' t think that the sympathy for Mr. Bouchard would translate into a ' yes ' vote for the referendum . It ' s much too serious an issue for that , &quot; he said . Bouchard was admitted to the hospital Tuesday with what was then described as phlebitis , an inflammation of the blood_vessels in the leg . Canadians were stunned Thursday night by a terse announcement that Bouchard ' s left leg had been amputated and that he was in serious but stable condition . Overnight it leaked_out from friends and associates that Bouchard was suffering from necrotizing myositis and that he was fighting for his life . Reporters camped on the sidewalk in front of the hospital . &quot; Canada A.M. , &quot; a morning television_program , flew co-anchor Keith Morrison from Toronto to Montreal and broadcast live from the hospital entrance Friday morning . Expressions of sympathy crossed all political boundaries . A single yellow rose was left on Bouchard ' s desk in the House of Commons . The doctors ' noon press_conference was telecast live across Canada .</TEXT>
