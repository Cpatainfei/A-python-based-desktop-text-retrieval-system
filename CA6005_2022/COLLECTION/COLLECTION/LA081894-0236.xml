   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; ADVOCATES TO GATHER FOR HOMELESS ANIMALS ' DAY ; OBSERVANCE : SATURDAY EVENT WILL CALL ATTENTION TO THE EUTHANIZING OF 12 MILLION TO 17 MILLION DOGS AND CATS EACH YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A somber candlelight vigil at 7 p.m. Saturday outside City_Hall may evoke strong emotions among animal lovers here -- but less reverent responses from others . Santa Clarita is one of 12 cities statewide in which the third annual Homeless Animals ' Day will be observed , calling attention to the massive euthanizing of dogs and cats each year . &quot; The purpose is to finally get the ( message ) out ( about ) the killing of healthy dogs and cats because owners don ' t get their animals spayed or neutered , &quot; said Helen Jones , president of the International Society for Animal Rights . About 12 million to 17 million healthy cats and dogs are killed annually in public and private animal shelters , according to the Pennsylvania-based group . Animal control officials are forced to put the animals to death because so many unwanted births occur . &quot; When there becomes too_much of any life , it becomes expendable , &quot; Jones said . &quot; This was an issue people didn ' t understand , didn ' t know about . It has been one of the best-kept secrets. &quot; Homeless Animals ' Day observances will be held Saturday in more_than 600 cities throughout the United States , Canada and Australia , Jones said . They include candlelight ceremonies and , in some instances , reading the names of the dead_animals to the sound of a drum_roll and weaving a chain of the animals ' collars . Santa Clarita ' s observance has been organized by the Santa Clarita Valley chapter of the Pet Assistance Foundation , a 25-member group that encourages spaying and neutering . &quot; Every year at this same time , various animal ( rights ) groups throughout the United States that have the time and energy are having these candlelight vigils , &quot; said Charmaine Posten , a chapter member . &quot; It ' s a somber evening. &quot; The nationwide program is usually well-attended by animal lovers , but can be puzzling to those less fervent about dogs and cats . &quot; Once in a while , you get crank mail from people who say , ' Why aren ' t you doing something for people ? ' &quot; Jones said . &quot; I think we are all working together . We ' re trying to stop suffering and death. &quot; About 100 people have attended each of Santa Clarita ' s two prior vigils . Four canine stars are scheduled to appear in Santa Clarita , including animal movie actors Benji and Bingo , Missy from &quot; Beethoven ' s 2nd &quot; and Murray from the &quot; Mad About You &quot; television series . * Certificates for grooming services , animal training and spaying and neutering will be distributed to those attending . &quot; The people in Santa Clarita are probably better than average about having their pets spayed and neutered , &quot; Posten said . &quot; We want kids growing_up knowing that when they have a pet they need to do that. &quot; Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson also plans to participate , possibly with his 1-year-old sheltie , Max . &quot; One of the tragedies of this society is how we treat our pets , &quot; Pederson said . &quot; I think that to have this vigil is a very important thing. &quot; More News . . . about the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys .
