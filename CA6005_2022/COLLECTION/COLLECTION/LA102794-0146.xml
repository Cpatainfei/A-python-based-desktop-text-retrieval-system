   <TEXT> The Scene : Monday ' s premiere of MGM ' s &quot; Stargate &quot; at Mann ' s Chinese with a party at the Palace . The film is a special-effects-filled science-fiction thriller with an ancient Egyptian theme . One writer , well-versed in the reigning buzzwords used to sell scripts , dubbed it &quot; ' Die Hard ' in a pyramid. &quot; Who Was There : The film ' s stars , James Spader and Jaye Davidson , who ' s best-known for &quot; The Crying Game &quot; ( co-star Kurt Russell was in New York for the Letterman show ) ; also on_hand were director-writer Roland Emmerich , writer-producer Dean Devlin , executive producer Mario Kassar and 1 # 200 guests , including James Coburn , Adam Baldwin , Gary Busey , Kim Cattrall , Ed Begley Jr. , Lesley Ann Warren , Rick Nicita , Jim Sheridan , and MGM ' s Frank Mancuso , Gerry Rich and Larry Gleason . The Film Distilled : Jennifer Tilly said , &quot; James Spader is a kind of a yuppie heartthrob , Kurt Russell is a kind of cowboy heartthrob , and then you have Jaye Davidson , who plays a hermaphrodite , which in itself is a really interesting special effect. &quot; Quoted : Davidson , who said doing &quot; Stargate &quot; was &quot; a lucky break , &quot; added , &quot; Why didn ' t I work for two years after ' The Crying Game ' ? It ' s because Hollywood doesn ' t know what to do with me . I don ' t look normal . I look_like a bit of a freak . It ' s not as though I ' m going_to get the roles Keanu Reeves turns down. &quot; The Setting : It was a truly lively party with a large segment of the crowd dancinguntil 1 a.m. Part of the ambience came from muscular extras in ancient Egyptian costume who looked_like bodybuilders from the King Tut gym . They wore loincloths that were a strong_breeze away from being X-rated . Chow : Ambrosia ' s Middle Eastern menu of stuffed grape leaves , hummus and fish skewers was served by staffers wearing turbans and robes a la John_the_Baptist . One guest called the style &quot; early Tunisian drip-dry. &quot; Fashion Standout : Davidson arrived_at the screening in a shimmering , antique Indian sari woven from gold thread . He changed into jeans and T-shirt immediately afterward . &quot; No way was I going_to wear it to the party , bump_into drunks and get cigarette_burns , &quot; he said . Local Wisdom : A film_star ' s ex-wife said , &quot; Being a celebrity is like having an all-access , backstage pass to life in Hollywood. &quot;</TEXT>
