   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; U.N. CHIEF BEGINS SEARCH TO REPLACE HAITI ENVOY WHO QUIT ; DIPLOMACY : DANTE CAPUTO COMPLAINS ANGRILY ABOUT U.S. HIGHHANDEDNESS . HE SERVED IN POST FOR 22 MONTHS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali launched a priority search Tuesday for a successor to the United Nations ' chief Haiti envoy , who has resigned and criticized the United States for a &quot; total absence of consultations &quot; in last-minute negotiations to persuade Haiti ' s army leaders to step_down . Dante Caputo , who negotiated the 1993 Governors Island agreement on Haiti , asserted &quot; the role of the United Nations has undergone an essential change &quot; and that Washington had decided &quot; to act unilaterally in the Haitian situation. &quot; Caputo , a former Argentine foreign_minister , in a letter released Monday by the United Nations , blamed the Clinton_Administration for failing to even tell him of the weekend talks Haiti ' s generals had with former President Jimmy_Carter , retired Gen . Colin L . Powell and Sen . Sam Nunn ( D.-Ga. ) . &quot; The total absence of consultations , and even of information from the government of the United States of America , makes me believe that this country , in fact , has taken the decision to act unilaterally in the Haitian process , &quot; Caputo said in his letter . On Tuesday , in an interview in Argentina , he went_further , asserting that the Administration had played into the hands of Haiti ' s military_leaders . &quot; This is just what he ( Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the Haitian strongman ) wanted -- to remain there and for U.S. rather than United Nations troops to land , &quot; he said . &quot; Cedras will not budge , he will remain and is likely to lead a new political force in Haiti. &quot; Under terms of the agreement forged by the team sent by President Clinton , Cedras must resign by Oct . 15 but is not obliged to leave Haiti . At the United Nations , Boutros-Ghali accepted Caputo ' s resignation with regret . Officials close to the secretary_general also made_it clear that the United States had acted in_accord with the Security_Council mandate to return ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power . &quot; Negotiations did not have to be cleared or coordinated further , &quot; said a spokesman for the secretary_general . &quot; Clearly , Mr. Caputo felt he had not been included in this process , which was made into a bilateral process. &quot; The spokesman stressed that , under the Security Council-approved resolution , it was unnecessary for the Administration to consult with the council during the weekend talks with Haiti ' s military junta . The spokesman praised Caputo , saying , &quot; He served for 22 months in one of the most difficult assignments imaginable , and he did_it with great dedication. &quot; He declined to discuss the weekend agreement or to say when the secretary_general was informed about it . Caputo negotiated the Governors Island accord between Aristide and Cedras . Cedras quickly ignored the pact , which called_for the junta to resign and Aristide to be returned . Later efforts by Caputo to implement the accord proved fruitless . Earlier this year , Caputo , elected in 1988 for a term as General_Assembly president , displeased some U.S. diplomats , expressing misgivings that the United States would make the United Nations responsible_for managing a difficult occupation of Haiti and would depart as quickly as possible . Diplomats who spoke with Caputo after his letter was submitted said his resignation was expected . &quot; He told me he has no role anymore , &quot; one envoy said . The diplomat said Caputo was not bitter but favored multilateral negotiations over Haiti ' s future . Meanwhile , diplomats at the United Nations continued their wait-and-see attitude before lifting international sanctions against Haiti . U.S. officials said they were watching the situation closely , and other Security_Council members indicated they were waiting for the Administration to introduce a resolution easing the embargo .</TEXT>
