   <HEADLINE> CELLULOID GUIDES KEEP GAINING HEFT ; MOVIES : HALLIWELL STARTED IT . NOW THERE ARE A HOST OF FILM BOOKS OFFERING WIDE-RANGING INFORMATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It all began in 1965 with Leslie Halliwell ' s &quot; The Filmgoer ' s Companion , &quot; which boasted a foreword by none other_than Alfred Hitchcock . The first &quot; Companion &quot; packed plenty into the 469 pages of the first American edition , a maroon hardcover with discreet gold lettering on the spine . Biography / filmographies of stars , directors and notable producers along with minireviews of classics made this creation by a British film encyclopedist a handy , compact reference . Nearly 30 years later , Halliwell , who died in 1989 , has created an industry . The boom in cable movies and video stores has sparked an interest in old movies , film history and movie trivia . Halliwell ' s first slender encyclopedia and its successors now have many rivals , all fighting for the space on movie-library shelves . Halliwell ' s credits total 13 books . His work and name continue , with John Walker as the editor , in two frequently updated editions . &quot; Halliwell ' s Film Guide , &quot; whose thick 1994 edition ( HarperPerennial , $ 21 ) ran to 1 # 347 pages , is an annual compendium of movie descriptions , brief quotes from contemporary reviews , quotes from dialogue and obscure facts . Though hard to handle , it is fun to read . &quot; Halliwell ' s Filmgoer ' s and Video Viewer ' s Companion &quot; ( HarperPerennial , $ 25 ) is a biographical encyclopedia containing complete filmographies for major figures , with pertinent quotes from films . It also includes useful and sometimes amusing category lists . The one on &quot; horses , &quot; for example , begins : &quot; Horses have in several cases risen to the rank of star. &quot; Mini-histories of studios and of Hollywood itself are also included in the 819 pages ( addenda bring the total of the 10th edition to 834 pages ) . Film references fall primarily into two categories , defined by the two Halliwell opuses : those offering brief reviews of every movie that ever achieved wide visibility , either in theaters or on television , and the biographical encyclopedia . Some references offer both movie descriptions and filmographies . Ephraim Katz ' s monumental &quot; The Film Encyclopedia &quot; ( HarperPerennial , $ 25 ) is the major biographical source . Now in an &quot; All-New Edition , &quot; the 1994 encyclopedia supersedes the original , first published in 1979 . ( Katz died in August , 1992 , before publication of the new_edition . Melinda Corey and George Ochoa completed his work. ) Weighing in at 1 # 496 pages , the new encyclopedia brings the world of movies up-to-date . It even carries a brief entry for Halliwell himself , describing his books as &quot; two of the most wide-ranging and idiosyncratic reference_works on film. &quot; Without question , the Katz book ranks as the most authoritative American film encyclopedia . It includes technical definitions ( &quot; Diffuser -- translucent material attached_to a lighting unit for the purpose of softening the light falling on a subject &quot; ) . However , there are no short entries on individual films , not even &quot; Birth of a Nation &quot; or &quot; Gone With the Wind. &quot; Though never as droll or crisp as Halliwell and his successors , the Katz book stands as probably the most definitive for film scholars , with terse , informative biographies with complete film listings if warranted . Any of the film historians and critics who have followed in their footsteps must acknowledge their debt to Halliwell , the Englishman who started it all , and to Katz , the Israeli-born American who brought the film encyclopedia home to this country . But respect for the founding_fathers has not prevented film experts from launching their own reference series . One of the most useful has been overseen by longtime film_writer James Monaco . His &quot; The Movie Guide &quot; ( Perigee Books , $ 24.95 ) offers a well-thought-out selection of knowledgeable movie reviews , with pertinent bits of history and lore . Its biggest advantage over other collections of minireviews is its inclusion of credits -- directors of photography , writers , etc. , and names of characters as well as stars . But the 1 # 099-page guide makes no attempt to describe every movie out there in videoland . &quot; The Encyclopedia of Film &quot; ( Perigee Books , $ 18.95 ) boasts lively and analytical descriptions , but this 596-page volume , published in 1991 , suffers from some omissions . Goldie Hawn , for example , a major star by any measure , is among the missing . The latest American film authority to enter the encyclopedia sweepstakes is television personality and critic Leonard Maltin . Maltin ' s annual &quot; Movie and Video Guide &quot; ( Signet Reference , $ 7.99 ) is celebrating its 25th anniversary with the 1995 edition . Not content with publishing the &quot; No . 1 bestseller &quot; as the jacket proclaims , Maltin has launched a new reference volume : &quot; Leonard Maltin ' s Movie Encyclopedia &quot; ( Dutton , $ 34.95 ) , a 976-page tome , is brand-new . Only time will determine its usefulness compared to Katz , Halliwell and Monaco . Separating Maltin ' s encyclopedia from the others is its failure to list separate filmographies -- though some are contained in his annuals . Among the best-known critics to produce an annual is Roger Ebert , whose 1995 edition is waiting in the wings . &quot; Roger Ebert ' s Video Companion / 1994 Edition &quot; ( Andrews and McNell , $ 14.95 ) , 893 pages , proclaims on the cover : &quot; Full-Length Reviews of Movies &quot; and &quot; All-New Essays and Interviews. &quot; Ebert ' s reviews are tightly written , complete and match up stars with the names of their characters . Though his star ratings are somewhat unreliable ( he tends to go overboard ) , this is the place to search out a key fact about a recent movie . The index is also a bonus . Ebert must be counted as the successor to Pauline Kael , whose 945-page &quot; 5001 Nights at the Movies &quot; ( Henry Holt , $ 22.50 ) represented the hugely influential New Yorker critic ' s swan_song in the world of movie references .</TEXT>
