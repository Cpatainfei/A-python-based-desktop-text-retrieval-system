   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL TRIES TO REPAIR RELATIONS WITH PALESTINIANS ; MIDEAST : A HEBRON SHRINE REMAINS CLOSED . BUT OFFICIALS ANNOUNCE MOVES INTENDED TO REASSURE ARABS THAT ACCORDS REACHED WITH THE PLO WILL BE HONORED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is hard to feel it in this town where Arabs and Jews live locked_in mutual loathing , but Israel is slowly trying to repair the damage that a recent string of guerrilla attacks inflicted on its relationship with the Palestine Liberation Organization . In Hebron on Monday , both Jews and Muslims spoke bitterly of the government ' s continuing refusal to reopen the Cave of the Patriarchs , a site holy to both their religions . The massive structure , called the Ibrahim Mosque by Muslims , has been shut since a Jewish settler killed Muslim worshipers there in February . &quot; We are the public that has a direct interest in the reopening , and we hear nothing from the government , &quot; said Noam Arnon , spokesman for the Jewish settlers who live_in the heart of Hebron . The army has spent months devising a system that will physically separate Jewish and Muslim worshipers inside the structure and had tentatively planned to open the site Monday . But the Israelis postponed the opening until at least next week for what government spokesman Uri Dromi insisted were &quot; technical security reasons. &quot; &quot; Our working assumption is that when the cave is opened , it is opened into a tense situation , &quot; Dromi said . &quot; This is why we need to make_sure that no technical function will ignite the whole situation. &quot; But even as the shrine stayed closed , Israeli officials announced moves intended to reassure the Palestinians that Israel will continue to honor the agreement it reached with them 13 months ago and gradually hand_over civil_authority throughout the West_Bank . Palestinian police are scheduled to take_up positions today at two crossing points -- one between Jordan and the West_Bank , the other between Egypt and the Gaza Strip -- for the first time . The Palestinian flag was hoisted alongside the Israeli flag at the Rafah crossing in Gaza on Monday and will be raised at the Allenby Bridge in the West_Bank today . And Palestinians visiting the territories will now be questioned and searched by Palestinian police rather than Israeli soldiers . An official presence at the two international crossings is an important symbol of the sovereignty that Palestinians are struggling to establish in the territories . Palestinians have always resented the aggressive questioning and searching that Israelis routinely subjected them to at international crossings . Israel retains the right to intervene for security purposes when it wishes , but most Palestinian travelers to the territories now will have face-to-face contact only with Palestinian officials . Israel ' s presence will fade from another aspect of their daily lives . Israel and the PLO also have reached agreement , after months of difficult negotiations , on the so-called safe passages that will link Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho , the two areas of self-rule . The passages will be roads that Palestinian officials and their bodyguards may freely travel , armed , without fear of being stopped at Israeli roadblocks . They are scheduled to open next week and will allow PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to assert his presence in Jericho , which he has visited only once since May . Most important for the vast majority of Palestinians , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin promised in the Moroccan port of Casablanca on Sunday , after meeting with Arafat , to &quot; progressively lift &quot; the current closure of Gaza and the West_Bank . The two were attending a regional economic conference designed to bring Israelis and Arabs together to plan the economic revitalization of the Middle_East and North Africa . Israel closed the territories Oct . 12 after Israeli soldier Nachshon Waxman was kidnaped by the militant Islamic organization Hamas . It briefly lifted the closure Oct . 19 , only to reimpose it the next day after a Hamas suicide bomber blew_up a busload of people in Tel Aviv . The territories have remained closed since . Closure means that about 63 # 500 permit-holding Palestinian workers are not allowed to travel_to their jobs in Israel . It has disrupted life for nearly every Palestinian living in the territories and has infuriated the self-governing Palestinian Authority . Palestinian officials Monday immediately criticized Rabin for not completely ending the closure , and Israeli officials declined to provide details of what Rabin meant by &quot; progressive. &quot; But what seems certain is that thousands of Palestinians will begin returning to their jobs today , relieving some of the political pressure that Arafat has been feeling . After meeting with Arafat on Sunday , Rabin also announced he will meet the chairman next Monday at Erez checkpoint -- the crossing point between Israel and Gaza -- to discuss the holding of Palestinian elections . Arafat had wanted elections this month , a target that is now all but impossible to meet . Israel and the PLO remain far apart on who should participate in the elections and on the size of the body to be elected . Israel wants a 30-member executive committee ; the Palestinians want a 100-member legislative body . The Palestinians accuse Israel of manufacturing excuses to avoid reaching an agreement on elections , which they say are essential for establishing the appointed authority ' s credibility . &quot; We are disappointed -- no , I should say we are extremely disappointed -- about the election issue , &quot; said Marwan Kanafani , a spokesman for Arafat who was in Casablanca with him Monday . &quot; Elections are important and essential ; they are the heart of the peace process , &quot; he said . &quot; Unfortunately , the seriousness and the urgency that we feel is met neither by the prime_minister nor the foreign_minister of Israel . We met with Prime_Minister Rabin on Sunday and heard , once again , nothing new. &quot; Kanafani said he hoped the Israelis &quot; will be able to concentrate their minds &quot; by the time Arafat and Rabin meet next week . He also complained that the United States has failed to pressure Israel on holding elections quickly . Curtius reported from Hebron and Parks from Casablanca , Morocco .</TEXT>
