   <HEADLINE> MOVIES ; THE GOOD , BAD AND NOT-SO UGLY ; PAST AFI FESTIVALS EMPHASIZED QUANTITY TO SHOWCASE FILMMAKERS . THIS YEAR , WILL FEWER FILMS MEAN HIGHER ARTISTIC QUALITY ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The AFI Film Festival , which runs Thursday to July 7 at the Monica 4-Plex in Santa Monica , is about half the size as previous years -- and that may well make_it twice as good . In the past the festival , like its predecessor Filmex , has tended to blur the line between quality and quantity to give a showcase to as_many filmmakers as possible . that ' s an arguably noble sentiment , but the plain truth is that too many bad movies bring_down the overall artistic level of any film festival . &quot; we ' ll be showing about 70-75 feature_films , and we ' ll have eight or nine special programs , &quot; said the festival ' s director , Ken Wlaschin , in an interview at AFI headquarters in Hollywood . &quot; This means that we ' ll be able to have more repeat screenings so that people will have a greater opportunity to see the best films . We ' ve decided that it ' s very , very hard for the Los Angeles audience to cope_with so many films , so we feel a smaller festival will actually make people more aware of what we ' re showing . This has been primarily a philosophic decision , but it also helps economically -- not having to bring_in so many filmmakers , for one thing. &quot; The festival ' s greatest vulnerability in the past has always been in its large offering of American independent films , many of which were so mediocre -- or worse -- that they never even had a prayer of finding distribution . &quot; We ' ve raised the level of the bar over which the films must jump , &quot; Wlaschin said . Judging from the films already previewed , this seems to be the case . Yet streamlining does not mean that there won ' t be something for everyone . The festival opens with the premiere of one of the summer ' s major releases , &quot; Wyatt Earp , &quot; starring Kevin Costner , and closes with the American premiere of German producer Regina Ziegler ' s &quot; Erotic Tales Series , &quot; six 30-minute vignettes made by Bob Rafelson , Susan Seidelman , Melvin Van Peebles , Ken Russell , Paul Cox and Indian director Mani Kaul . There will be special tributes to actors Holly Hunter and Dennis Hopper , directors Henry Jaglom and Paul Verhoeven and television producer Frank von Zerneck . There will be a retrospective of the films of Andy Warhol protege Paul Morrissey ; a repeat screening of Krzysztof Kieslowski ' s landmark 10-part , nearly 11-hour &quot; The Decalogue , &quot; an investigation into the relevance of the Ten Commandments in modern life , and director Sergei Bondarchuk ' s cut of his 1967 &quot; War and Peace. &quot; &quot; Cine Latino : A Tribute to the OAS / Americas Film Festival &quot; will present in_person Mexico ' s Arturo Ripstein , Argentina ' s Eliseo Subiela and Brazil ' s Nelson Periera dos Santos . There will be screenings of Ripstein ' s &quot; The Beginning of the End , &quot; a monumental family saga based on a novel by 1988 Nobel Prize_winner Naguib Mahfouz ; Subiela ' s highly praised &quot; The Dark Side of the Heart , &quot; a parable about one man ' s struggle against the forces of conformity from the maker of the extraordinary and distinctive &quot; Man Facing Southeast , &quot; and Periera dos Santos ' &quot; The Third Bank of the River , &quot; composed of five separate tales , and a 30th-anniversary screening of his &quot; Vidas Secas , &quot; a story of a family ' s pilgrimage through Brazil ' s rugged northeastern back-lands in search of a better life . The UCLA Film Archive will join forces with the American Film Institute in presenting on July 2 an all-night &quot; Comedies of Elegance , &quot; in tribute to the AFI ' s film catalogue for the 1930s . For information , call Theatix , ( 213 ) 466-1767 . Selected Picks &quot; Black Harvest &quot; ( Friday , 1:30 and 6:30 p.m. ) . Danish director Anders Refn , whose similar 1978 first feature &quot; The Baron &quot; was shown at Filmex , once again takes us into the world of turn-of-the-century landed gentry . &quot; Black Harvest , &quot; period perfect and exquisitely crafted , charts the decline and fall of an aristocratic family that is triggered by the wretched excesses of a cruel , tyrannical patriarch ( Ole Ernst ) , a hard-drinking , womanizing reckless gambler with an ineffectual wife and four daughters , only one of whom ( Sofie Graaboel ) has enough gumption even to consider defying him . Just as &quot; Black Harvest &quot; threatens to go_over the top in lurid excesses and unrelenting misery , it pulls_together for a powerful finish at once quietly ironic and tragic . &quot; Johnny 100 Pesos &quot; ( Friday , 4:10 and 9:20 p.m. ) . Drawing_on an actual 1990 incident , Chilean filmmaker Gustavo Graef Marino brings a tart , timely political dimension to this classic hostage standoff suspenser , alternating effortlessly between the comic and the tragic . Armando Araiza has the title_role as a handsome but woefully naive 17-year-old student ( and part-time petty thief ) who throws_in his lot with a group of veteran criminals to hold_up an illegal currency exchange in a downtown Santiago high rise . The entire job is bungled from the get-go , with the bad_guys taking_five hostages . Not only does Marino sustain the resulting stalemate with unflagging zest and imagination and take_aim at familiar media excesses , but he also brings_in the chaotic secretary_of_the_interior ' s office , which in democracy ' s infancy has a vested_interest in getting control of the situation so as_to protect Chile ' s newly refurbished image both at_home and abroad . &quot; Total Balalaika Show &quot; ( Saturday , 1:20 p.m. ; repeats next Sunday , 1:20 p.m. ) . Not surprisingly , Finland ' s sly , whimsical Aki Kaurismaki had a hand in bringing_together the Leningrad Cowboys -- a goofy but endearing Finnish rock_band favoring pointy shoes with matching pointy hair , unicorn style -- and the thundering , sober , richly uniformed Alexandrov Red Army Chorus and Dance Ensemble for a concert held last year in Helsinki ' s Senate Square that attracted a crowd of 70 # 000 . The result provided a perfect concert film for Kaurismaki -- a sweet , alternately hilarious and poignant cross-cultural experience , and no small landmark in detente . It ' s also a nifty follow-up to Kaurismaki ' s &quot; Leningrad Cowboys Go America. &quot; &quot; The Wedding_Gift &quot; ( Saturday , 6:30 p.m. ; repeats July 1 , 1:30 p.m. ) . One of the festival ' s most widely appealing films , this British production , directed deftly by Richard Loncraine , is an exceptionally touching and mature love_story starring Julie Walters as a witty middle-aged housewife , struck_down by a mysterious debilitating disease , and Jim Broadbent as her almost overly devoted husband . They are two people who have long put each other first but are now confronted with challenges that threaten to overwhelm them . Walters and Broadbent are immensely skillful , with the result that the film , based on a true incident , is genuinely poignant . &quot; Out of Sight &quot; ( Saturday , 7 p.m. ) . David Sutherland ' s engaging , in-depth documentary in which for once we ' re able to see a woman ' s blindness as but one aspect of her overall life and personality . Feisty Diane Starin wonders whether &quot; America is ready for a blind girl who isn ' t a goody-two-shoes. &quot; Stubbornly independent , self-assertive and promiscuous , the 34-year-old Starin is a Northern California horse rancher caught_up in a tempestuous relationship with a weathered , macho Marlboro Man type old enough to be her father . &quot; Love After Love &quot; ( June 28 , 1:20 and 6:40 p.m. ) . Diane Kurys ' wise , elegant film is a consideration of how difficult it is for a couple , even sophisticated Parisians , to sustain a longstanding , open relationship into the competitive , disillusioned ' 90s . &quot; Love After Love &quot; unfolds in the year between the 35th and 36th birthdays of its heroine , a successful novelist ( Isabelle Huppert , at her most beautiful and poised ) who for 20 years has lived with an equally successful architect ( Bernard Giraudeau ) . &quot; Exile &quot; ( June 29 , 3:50 and 9 p.m. ) . A beautifully articulated romantic fable from Australia ' s Paul Cox about a young_man ( Aden Young ) who , in the mid-19th Century , is punished for stealing some sheep by being banished to an uninhabited island , where in time his fate attracts a young_woman ( Beth Champion ) with whom he creates an idyllic existence . Cox effectively suggests how out of touch with nature society is in_general and religion in particular , but he mars his notable effort by recurrent appearances of the ghost of a priest ( Norman Kaye ) , uttering predictably sage and totally redundant remarks ; you wish that the priest could be edited_out of the film entirely . &quot; From the East &quot; ( &quot; D ' Est &quot; ) ( June 29 , 4 and 9:10 p.m. ) . Demanding but luminously beautiful film from Belgium ' s ever-venturesome Chantal Akerman , who literally -- and slowly -- pans her camera all_the way from East_Germany to Moscow in an attempt to record public life ( with several glimpses of private lives interspersed ) before change inevitably occurs . Her journey spans summer to winter , ending in a long survey of Moscow , where most citizens seem frozen in endless queues . As always , Akerman ' s sense of composition , camera placement and movement is eloquent . &quot; D ' Est &quot; quietly celebrates the continuity of life beyond political_systems . &quot; Helas Pour Moi &quot; ( &quot; Oh , Woe Is Me &quot; ) ( June 29 , 8 p.m. , Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences ) . Gerard Depardieu stars as a businessman whose body is briefly inhabited by God , which is but a point of departure for Jean-Luc Godard ' s beautiful but complex contemplation of our longing for spiritual redemption . ( It is quite possible to conclude , disturbingly , that Depardieu ' s experience is ultimately of no consequence. ) Chock-full of Godard ' s trademark plethora of quotations , chapter headings and aphorisms , it is as difficult as it is beguiling , a testament to one of the great filmmakers of our time ' s continuing capacity for growth and experimentation , and his ability to elicit an array of emotional and intellectual responses from the most elliptical means . &quot; Women From the Lake of Scented Souls &quot; ( July 2 , 4:10 p.m. ) . Xie Fei ' s stunning feminist work stars Wu Yujuan , whose sturdy heroine , although unglamorous , brings_to mind Joan Crawford in &quot; Mildred Pierce. &quot; In rural Northern China the quality of her sesame_oil is so fine that she attracts Japanese investors . While successfully running her mill she is , however , burdened with a drunken , oafish husband ( to whom she was sold at 7 , married at 13 ) and above all with trying to marry off her sexually frustrated , mentally_retarded son . The point that Xie makes with the impact of revelation -- and not an ounce of preachiness -- is how oppressed women can be tempted into helping oppress yet another generation of women . &quot; Handgun &quot; ( July 5 , 4:10 and 9:20 p.m. ) . Whitney Ransick ' s smart , funny debut feature is an endlessly inventive heist picture in which everything that possibly could go_wrong does . Treat Williams , an ex-con , and Paul Schulze , who sells fake burial plots , are brothers eager to get their hands on the half-million their father ( Seymour Cassel ) has just stolen . More credible and less violent than the more radical &quot; Reservoir Dogs , &quot; to which this film will inevitably be compared .</TEXT>
