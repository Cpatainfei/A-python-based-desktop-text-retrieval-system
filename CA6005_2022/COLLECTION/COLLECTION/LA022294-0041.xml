   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS ; EUROPEAN SWEEP HELPS RESTORE ORDER IN THE MOUNTAINS ; ALPINE SKIING : SWEDEN ' S WIBERG WINS GOLD MEDAL IN COMBINED WITH STRONG SLALOM RUNS . A SWISS WINS THE SILVER , A SLOVENIAN THE BRONZE AS U.S. IS FINALLY SHUT OUT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No one expected American skiers to win a medal in every event , right ? Get the_Swiss more steamed than they are ? Why not toss Sweden a bone ? American Alpine excellence made a nice run_on the world stage last week , but everyone knows all gold things come_to an end . Skewered after watching the U.S. collect medals in the first four Olympic Alpine events , the Euros stepped_up to the gates Monday and announced their presence , sweeping the women ' s combined . Sweden ' s Pernilla Wiberg took the gold at the Hafjell course , defeating Swiss veteran Vreni Schneider by a total of 0.13 seconds in the two-day event , which combines the times of a downhill and two slalom runs . Alenka Dovzan of Slovenia took the bronze . Picabo Street , second after Sunday ' s combined downhill , finished 10th overall , not a surprise given her lack of slalom experience . But during the U.S. streak , nothing seemed impossible . After Street ' s &quot; disappointment , &quot; U.S. ski team surgeon Richard Steadman told Paul Major , the Alpine director , &quot; Greed is a very ugly thing. &quot; Europe broke_through with a series of firsts : -- Wiberg , a 23-year-old pop singer and former mail_carrier , earned the first Alpine medal for Sweden before a crowd that included her country ' s King Carl XVI Gustav and Queen Silvia . Although she did not face &quot; off-with-her-head &quot; pressure , Wiberg was relieved . &quot; I ' m happy to have them here , &quot; she said . &quot; I like them very much . It ' s a fine king and queen we have. &quot; -- Schneider , 29 , ended Switzerland ' s exasperating dry spell , no Olympic medals dating 12 events to the Albertville Games . Schneider was a double gold-medal winner , in slalom and giant slalom , at Calgary in 1988 , when the_Swiss won 10 Alpine medals . Questioned about a mistake that might have cost her the gold in her first run of slalom , Schneider responded politely , &quot; I did not lose the gold , I won the silver. &quot; -- Dovzan , who turned 18 on Feb , 11 , earned the first Olympic medal for Slovenia since it gained independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991 . Dovzan was not prepared to tackle the political significance of her bronze . &quot; I think this is a big Olympic medal for Slovenia , &quot; she said . &quot; We are a little state , 2 million , it means a lot. &quot; Street , still basking in the glow of Olympic silver , didn ' t stand much of a chance . &quot; I knew this was how it was going_to wind_up and I just wanted to go_out and ski a good race for myself and smile and have a good time , &quot; she said . &quot; I hope the rules change back so that they ' re not so favorable for the slaloms in combined for the next Olympics. &quot; A recent rule change , intended to simplify combined scoring , has given slalom specialists a marked advantage . In fact , the top three finishers in the downhill combined -- German ' s Katja Seizinger , Street and Isolde Kostner of Italy -- were no factor_in the end . Seizinger and Kostner missed gates and were disqualified . Under the old format , Street thinks she might have earned a medal . That complicated system handicapped the race to consider the vast difference between events . In the past , a racer who had a one-second lead after downhill was likely to be granted an additional second before the slalom , in which a skilled technician can quickly make_up lost downhill time . The old system was more equitable , yet few could understand it . Why the change ? &quot; It ' s done like in every_other sport , &quot; Major said . &quot; They get a bunch of guys in a room , guys who have been around for a while and know all_the answers . And they come_up with some weird stuff . I like the old_style . I think it ' s great for the public to see the times , but there ' s got_to be some sort of compromise between times in weighing the downhill vs . the slalom event. &quot; Using the old system for last year ' s World Championships at Morioka , Japan , Street won the downhill , placed 15th in slalom , and won the silver in combined . Here , Street placed second in downhill , 10th in the slalom and 10th overall . Major said he intends to calculate Street ' s Olympic numbers under the old formula to see where she would have placed . That won ' t be any time this week , though , because Major left the formula at_home . The Olympic combined became a foregone_conclusion when slalom specialists Wiberg , Schneider and Dovzan finished within 1.63 seconds behind Seizinger in Sunday ' s downhill portion . Seizinger went_out on her first slalom run , but the slalom specialists might well have made_up the time difference on the first run anyway , with another run to follow . In the morning run , Wiberg edged Schneider by 0.40 seconds and that , figured with her downhill time , gave her a 0.61 differential with the afternoon run remaining . Schneider , winner of five World Cup slaloms this season , could not make_up the difference on Wiberg , the defending Olympic GS gold medalist , in the second run . Schneider , who skied before Wiberg on the second run , gave it her all , besting Wiberg handily -- 46.63 to 47.11 -- but she had too_much ground to make_up . And who might Wiberg thank for her victory ? Would you believe Picabo Street ? The American has been teaching Wiberg the finer points of downhill . Maybe Street can exchange them for some slalom lessons . Street , with a medal in the bag , was rooting for Wiberg , who has returned to top form after sitting_out much of last season because of a torn Achilles ' tendon . &quot; I saw her before the second run today and I said , ' It ' s all you , girl , ' &quot; Street said . &quot; You ' ve got_it . Don ' t just beat ' em , work ' em. ' She came_back from a really , really nasty injury last year to just clean everybody ' s clock all year. &quot;</TEXT>
