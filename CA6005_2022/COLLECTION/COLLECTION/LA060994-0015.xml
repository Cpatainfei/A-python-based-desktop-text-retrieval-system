   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING : LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD CALORIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lowering fat consumption is not an easy thing to accomplish . Not only does fat make everything taste better , but it is an essential ingredient in many foods we covet . Moderation is the key in any diet , especially where fat is concerned . I have found that , in a typical baked-goods recipe that calls_for several eggs , one egg_yolk will often do . As we know , egg_yolks are the source of much fat in baking . This is how the formula generally works : I use just one egg_yolk and at least an equal volume of egg_whites to substitute for the total volume of whole eggs . ( Two egg_whites equal one egg. ) In addition , I use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour . Cake flour is a fine-textured , soft-wheat flour with a high starch content , producing very tender results in baking . Be aware that cake flour weighs less than all-purpose flour ( one cup of cake flour is four ounces ; one cup of all-purpose flour is five ounces ) . Low-fat buttermilk also gives fat-restrained recipes great flavor and a light texture . Canola oil can often be substituted for butter . * The following recipes for waffles , muffins and chocolate_cake have lowered fat content but still smack of their expected goodness . Once you have tried them , you can apply the same adjustments to your own favorite baked_goods . * Crisp outside and soft inside , these waffles are enticing on the breakfast_table . The batter can be refrigerated overnight , but it is_best used when the beaten egg_whites are just folded in . CRISPY WAFFLES 2 1 / 2 cups cake flour 3 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt Sugar 1 large egg_yolk 2 cups buttermilk 2 tablespoons canola oil 3 large egg_whites Sliced strawberries , optional Maple_syrup , warmed , optional Sift together flour , baking powder , salt and 3 tablespoons sugar in large bowl . Beat egg_yolk in small bowl . Stir in buttermilk and oil . Beat egg_whites in separate bowl with electric_mixer until stiff but not dry . Add yolk-buttermilk mixture to flour mixture . Stir just until moistened . Do not overmix . Fold in egg_whites with rubber spatula . Lightly spray waffle iron with oil . Heat waffle iron . When hot , pour 1 / 2 to 1 cup batter on iron . Close iron and bake until waffle is browned and steam no longer escapes_from iron , about 4 to 5 minutes . Do not make waffles too thick . Serve hot . Sprinkle strawberries with sugar to taste and place on top of waffles . Serve with warm maple_syrup . Makes 5 to 6 waffles . Each of 5 waffles , without syrup or sugared strawberries , makes about : 338 calories ; 860 mg sodium ; 58 mg cholesterol ; 8 grams fat ; 55 grams carbohydrates ; 10 grams protein ; 0.11 grams fiber . * Serve these moist and tender muffins with salads , chili and stews . CONFETTI CORN_MUFFINS 1 cup cake flour 1 / 3 cup yellow cornmeal 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon crushed red_pepper flakes 1 / 2 teaspoon baking soda 1 / 2 teaspoon salt 1 / 4 cup sugar 2 large green_onions , including green tops , minced 3 / 4 cup buttermilk 3 tablespoons canola oil 1 large egg_yolk 3 large egg_whites Combine flour , cornmeal , baking powder , red_pepper flakes , baking soda , salt , sugar and green_onions in large bowl . Mix buttermilk , oil , yolk and egg_whites in small bowl . Add wet ingredients to flour mixture . Stir with wooden spoon just until combined . Do not overmix . Place 12 paper muffins cups in muffin tin . Divide batter among prepared muffin cups . Bake on center oven rack at 375 degrees until light-brown , about 18 minutes . Do not overbake . Cool slightly in pan . Serve warm . Makes 12 muffins . Each serving contains about : 110 calories ; 198 mg sodium ; 23 mg cholesterol ; 4 grams fat ; 15 grams carbohydrates ; 3 grams protein ; 0.09 grams fiber . * This is a rich-tasting and moist chocolate_cake . Frost it , if you like , although a sprinkling of powdered sugar seems to be perfect .
