   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; SOCCER IN THE COLONIES ; BRITISH WERE GOING TO KEEP A STIFF UPPER LIP , BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED : HOW ' BOUT THEM IRISH !</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The sometimes brilliant play in the opening round of the World Cup has left British fans with mixed emotions . As a soccer-loving nation , they are thrilled by the action . But without a team in the tournament , they aren ' t sure whom to root for . The United Kingdom , which claims to have invented professional soccer , is allowed to field four teams in World Cup competition -- England , Scotland , Wales and Northern_Ireland . Although those teams showed flashes of inspiration during the long competition for a berth in the finals , none qualified . When England failed , the nation ' s sports fans were humiliated and furious -- and the coach of the team , Graham Taylor , was fired . On the eve of the first U.S. World Cup , much of the_British media and public was in a carping mood : What did the Americans know about soccer ? The stadiums would be half-empty . The World Cup would be a disaster -- and with good riddance for trusting the competition to the upstart Yanks . The U.S. team was in the competition , the grumbling ran , only because it was the host country . At first , the_British sports pages turned_to coverage of the U.S. Open golf tournament and Wimbledon tennis . Writers on the World Cup had trouble placing the events in the proper venues . Chicago , for instance , was described as a city in Michigan . But in the last week , the mood in Britain has changed markedly . Pubs are_full during games . Some Britons arrive for work bleary-eyed after watching a post-midnight game . And , surprise , the Brits have a team to cheer for . That team is fielded by Ireland -- a country with which Britain has always had an ambivalent relationship . &quot; We used to look down on the_Irish in football , &quot; commented one professional man who adjourns to his suburban pub during evening World Cup matches . &quot; Now we ' re looking_up at them . Go Ireland ! &quot; The British media seemed overjoyed when Ireland beat the highly touted Italians in their first game , and all_the papers have assigned a reporter to the_Irish training camp in Orlando , Fla . Actually , there are plenty of reasons for the_British support of Ireland . The Irish manager is a famous and popular Yorkshireman , Jack Charlton , whom Dubliners have christened &quot; St . Jack. &quot; He is a brother of the_English soccer star , Bobby Charlton , who was just knighted for services to sport . And almost all_of Ireland ' s team plays for British clubs . Some of the_Irish players have dual citizenship but chose to play under the flag of the green , white and orange . So the_British have adopted the_Irish team . As John Duncan , the soccer writer of the Guardian newspaper , observed , &quot; A lot of people here are struggling through their ancestry to find an Irish connection. &quot; And the best-selling tabloid , the Sun , which knows a good_story when it sees one , has urged its readers to fax good-luck messages to the Ireland squad through the newspaper . Not given to understatement , the Sun declared : &quot; We want you to get_behind Jack Charlton and his Republic_of_Ireland World Cup heroes. &quot; Ireland notwithstanding , such has been the quality of play that British television spectators have had plenty to watch and to lift their sporting spirits . Every newspaper has columns of results and comment . &quot; The fact is , the level of football has been so good that it has encouraged a high level of interest , &quot; wrote Duncan . &quot; There are so many good matches to watch that we don ' t really need our own team. &quot; England , although it has won only one World Cup , always has performed well when it reached the finals . It lost to Germany in 1990 only through penalty kicks , and in 1986 lost to Argentina when Diego Maradona scored on an obvious but unpenalized hand ball , which he christened &quot; the hand of God. &quot; Thus , the_British fans can boo their personal villains . &quot; Everybody is just itching for the Germans to mess_up and for the Argentinians to get stuffed , &quot; Duncan said . &quot; At the same time , we like underdogs , so there are all sorts of teams like Saudi_Arabia to keep us amused. &quot; What has genuinely surprised the_British , as well as_many others , is the wonderful show being made of the World Cup . &quot; The Americans have done really well , &quot; said one fan . &quot; We are impressed by the size of the crowds . There are very few places in the world where you ' d get 43 # 000 people to turn_out for a match between Nigeria and Bulgaria. &quot; The papers have gone so far as_to compliment the American team and the U.S. sports fans . As one writer remarked , &quot; Americans don ' t like draws . But it beats losing. &quot; After the first week , British writers had definitely changed their tune . As a leading writer , Rob Hughes , reported from Washington , &quot; Soccer will never colonize America , may never sink its contagious roots here , but it is beginning to turn the tide of skepticism . &quot; Ten games have passed , none without a goal and none importing hooliganism . Quicker than we expected , the host is feeling more comfortable staging the premier event of a game addictive to the rest of the world. &quot;</TEXT>
