   <HEADLINE> MAD ABOUT YOU ; ANGER , WHEN MANAGED , CAN ADD SPICE TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP . LEFT UNCHECKED , IT CAN TEAR THE TWO OF YOU APART . THE TRICK IS TO KEEP YOUR COOL WHEN THINGS GET HOT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A little anger directed your way from your spouse may_not be fun , &quot; but it is functional in a marriage , and that gets_it out_in the open , &quot; says psychologist John Gottman . A leading researcher in identifying predictors of successful marriages , Gottman has started the Anger Project at the University of Washington to investigate the functional and dysfunctional forms of getting hot_under_the_collar . He reports that the latest scientific evidence on anger supports what many therapists are finding_out there in the trenches of marital discord : that expressing anger in the right ways is good for a marriage , while expressing it inappropriately can be the death_knell of a relationship . By noting voice tone , expressions and nonverbal behavior of his research subjects , Gottman has separated what he calls &quot; pure anger &quot; -- when people who are upset say so and attempt to talk it out -- from other forms of anger , including belligerence , provocation , domination and defensive expressions . &quot; It turns_out that pure anger is not harmful , &quot; says the author of &quot; Why Marriages Succeed or Fail &quot; ( Simon &amp; Schuster ) . &quot; It functions like putting your words in italics . It gets people ' s attention . We have a little bit of evidence that it actually is good in a marriage . But these other forms of anger expression -- the belligerent and defensive forms -- are very dysfunctional and are predictive of divorce. &quot; Other studies have reached similar conclusions . University of Wisconsin researchers who have been measuring brain activity associated with different emotions have found that fear and sadness show activity on the right frontal_lobe of the brain . The brain ' s left hemisphere lights_up meters when subjects are happy , amused or interested . &quot; That also is true for anger , &quot; Gottman says . &quot; It ' s on the left with other positive emotions. &quot; Studies at the University of Alabama demonstrate that women tend to cool_down and relax after experiencing anger , whereas men tend to stay angry . &quot; Men are more likely to have distress-maintaining thoughts ( righteous indignation or feeling like an innocent victim blended with sadness and disappointment ) than women , &quot; Gottman says . &quot; They keep thinking_about things , which makes retaliation more likely. &quot; At Catholic University in Washington , D.C. , psychology professor Clifford Notarius , who has been studying happy and unhappy couples for 20 years , finds that anger that is not dealt with constructively &quot; is the signature of a distressed relationship. &quot; That destructive anger , he explains , often is fueled by &quot; a series of hot thoughts &quot; that serve as explanations for the disappointment or injury felt . The trick to defusing an explosive situation , says the co-author of &quot; We Can Work It Out &quot; ( Putnam ) , is to make those explanations specific and operable to the moment . When your partner is 45 minutes late for your anniversary dinner , for instance , thinking , &quot; He ' s probably caught in a terrible traffic_jam , &quot; is much less agitating than , &quot; He never watches the time , &quot; or , &quot; He ' s always putting other people before me , &quot; or , &quot; He ' s an inconsiderate jerk. &quot; Says Notarius : &quot; Those kinds of thoughts will have important implications ( as_to ) what happens when your partner arrives. &quot; In his research , Gottman has been measuring another indicator that may provide some clues to when anger crosses the line of effectiveness . &quot; If your heart_rate is over 100 beats a minute , you can ' t really listen very well , &quot; he says . &quot; And not only can ' t you take_in information very well , but you tend to rely_on older learned behaviors &quot; -- namely the dysfunctional run-or-attack forms . &quot; The heart betrays the mind at that point , &quot; Gottman says , explaining that just as in physical_exercise , where there ' s an optimum range for heart_rate , the same is true when exercising one ' s anger . Assuming that in a fit of rage you have the wherewithal to check your pulse , &quot; keep it below 95 beats per minute. &quot;</TEXT>
