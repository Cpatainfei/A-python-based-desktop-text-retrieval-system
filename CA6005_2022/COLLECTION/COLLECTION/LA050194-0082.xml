   <HEADLINE> NEARBY WHIDBEY ISLAND , A GEM ON PUGET SOUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The surrounding country , for several miles in most points_of_view , presented a delightful prospect , consisting chiefly of spacious meadows , elegantly adorned with clumps of trees , &quot; wrote Capt . George Vancouver , extolling the virtues of central Whidbey Island in 1792 . &quot; In these beautiful pastures , bordering_on an expansive sheet of water , the deer were seen playing about in great numbers . Nature had here provided a well-stocked park. &quot; Two centuries later , we discovered that this fertile island refuge that snakes northward from the mouth of Puget Sound , 26 miles north of Seattle , remains an idyllic destination , particularly for the city-weary . Rich in wildlife , sparsely developed and surrounded by scenic vistas , Whidbey and the San Juan Islands to the north are considered the gems of these waters -- with good reason . For us , Whidbey was a welcome way station as we traveled from Seattle to Vancouver during a late summer vacation last year . Our host was another captain , John Colby Stone , the convivial innkeeper at the Captain Whidbey Inn , a rustic 86-year-old log_cabin outside the town of Coupeville on the protected waters of Penn Cove , which is home to the sweet-tasting mussels that bear the same name . The inn itself , made of madrona logs , is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . We had learned of its renown from a guidebook on country inns . But Stone commands more_than landlocked accommodations . His teak &quot; Cutty Sark &quot; is a handsome 52-foot gaff ketch that was built_in Hong Kong and is capable of transoceanic passage . Viewing its seven bark-tan sails and six round portals , my wife Katherine called it &quot; a perfect Peter_Pan ship. &quot; We had arrived in Penn Cove to unwind at the Captain Whidbey Inn and to join Stone for an invigorating jaunt on his craft . With us in tow on a crisp , sunny day , the Captain navigated around Penn Cove ' s peaceful haven , celebrating the good_fortune that he now makes part of his living chartering his beloved vessel . As a long-necked cormorant raced past , he recalled that his mother , who schooled him in the art of inn-keeping , used to say , &quot; The work is never done . How can you go sailing ? &quot; Now 42 with a decidedly gray beard and mustache , Stone would respond : &quot; If the work is never done , what difference does_it make ? &quot; Today he tells her : &quot; Mom , it is my work. &quot; For the visitor , Whidbey Island ' s narrow , winding 45-mile length feels_like anything but work . Expansive parks , bordered by water and views of the Olympic Peninsula to the west and inhabited by great_blue_herons , bald_eagles , red-tailed foxes , rhododendrons and rare wild iris , beckon hikers and bikers . The cove-side town of Coupeville offers marine vistas , pubs , artsy stores , 19th-Century Victorian homes and a small museum that charts the region ' s history , dating_back 10 # 000 years to the time Native_Americans first inhabited the island . And the Captain Whidbey Inn itself -- from which Stone and his exquisite boat are available for day sails , moonlight cruises and longer trips to the San Juans -- is an invitation to slow_down and pick_up a book , sip wine by a roaring fire or let time slip past doing nothing more_than admiring the scenery . Simply awakening to the call of gulls and the smell of bacon , donning a fluffy terry-cloth robe and peering out at the eye-opening blueness of the cove were among the many small pleasures that our stay afforded us . * Visitors can reach Whidbey , the longest_island within inland waters of the continental United States , by air , ferry or car . We drove our rental car north from Seattle on Interstate 5 , then swung west and south on Washington 20 , over Deception Pass , and onto the island . At the pass , we crossed a two-lane bridge with spectacular views of the bluffs and pounding waves below . It was here that Joseph Whidbey , master of Vancouver ' s flagship , discovered in 1792 that what had appeared to be a narrow inlet was actually a passage to the water beyond . Today , Deception Pass State Park , on Whidbey just south of the connecting bridge , encompasses old_growth timber , dense vegetation , freshwater lakes and miles of shoreline . As we made our way south on the island toward Coupeville , we passed wheat fields and fruit stands abundant with ripe produce ( &quot; U-pick raspberries &quot; ) . Overhead roared a plane destined for Whidbey Island Naval Air_Station . The island , which has a population of about 55 # 000 , boasts the world ' s highest yield of wheat per acre as well as its largest loganberry farm . Our first stop was the inn , located at the head of Penn Cove in the central part of the island . We were immediately struck by the scent of pine . &quot; It takes me back to my childhood , &quot; sighed Katherine . The building , which is surrounded by stately evergreens , is a vestige of the days when log_cabins were prevalent in the Northwest . The polished madrona wood is a dark honey color with a warm , glowing sheen . Madrona is an extremely hard wood that does not grow as straight as pine ; therefore the logs are cut_in lengths no longer than eight feet and are butted rather than notched . They are now chinked with mortar as well , a concession to both the weather -- the inn was originally a summer resort -- and discretion . The inn ' s downstairs living and dining rooms create a distinctly informal , homey first impression . Both have fireplaces made with large beach stones and comfortable antique furnishings . The upstairs rooms are generally small . Ours had a feather_bed with overstuffed down comforters , a chair and wooden dresser and a shaving-bowl sink_in the corner . The top-hinged windows were propped open with wooden pegs and looked onto the cove and peninsula . Other rooms face the herb and vegetable-filled garden -- the source of many ingredients for the kitchen . Books and magazines abound . Bathrooms are shared . Lawn_chairs and a multilevel deck overlook the cove . Guests can take sandwiches outside for lunch or a drink to toast the day turning_to dusk . The inn also makes picnic boxes on request ( you might try the cured and alder-smoked turkey with apple chipotle relish , anise-scented sweet_cicely and other garden greens on a house-baked baguette ) . Breakfast , which is served in a flower-filled dining_room that fronts the bay , includes granola and fresh baked breads such_as banana-hazelnut and cranberry-orange-walnut . The daily entrees are such creations as baked oatmeal with fresh berries and nuts topped with vanilla cream and toasted almonds . Orange_juice and coffee are available to wash it all down . One day we decided to venture three miles down the road to Coupeville for lunch . Our destination was the Knead &amp; Feed , nestled on the banks of the waterfront . Coupeville ( pop . 1 # 200 ) is the island ' s oldest town ; many of its 19th-Century homes can be seen on a walking tour . The Knead &amp; Feed building , with its white-stone walls and wood beams , was built as a store in 1871 . Since 1974 , it has been owned by the Kroon family , who pride themselves on their fresh-baked breads , pastries and pies and soups made from scratch daily . We enjoyed rich , tasty soups of corn_chowder and lentil with tomatoes , and salads . Dessert was marionberry pie , filled with locally grown fruit that looks and tastes much like large sweet blackberries . Shops along Northwest Front Street sell carvings , woodworking and antiques . Many were decorated with baskets of impatiens . A restaurant reflected the Northwest ' s love_affair with coffee , touting a daily special of espresso with steamed milk : &quot; Tall raspberry coconut latte . $ 1.65. Iced or hot. &quot; We stopped at Jan McGregor ' s studio , where she has been minding the shop for 17 years . McGregor is a potter who studied with a Japanese master in Kyoto for two years . Her distinctive pieces , inlaid with cobalt , have been exhibited in museums . McGregor said that she had obtained 10 pounds of natural cobalt from China , but that the source is now depleted . Fortunately , McGregor said her stock &quot; will last me a lifetime -- or more. &quot; * The next time we saw Coupeville was from innkeeper John Stone ' s ship . A merchant_marine officer and longtime sailor , Stone schedules regular weekend sails from May to September but is available for chartering other times as well . We engaged him for a two-hour outing . Stone ' s family has owned the Captain Whidbey Inn for 32 years . His parents bought_it from relatives ; he moved_into the cabin when he was 14 . When his parents considered selling it in 1980 , he acted_as their financial adviser and ended_up agreeing to buy_it himself . So_much for graduate_school , recalled the ex-sociology major . As a youth , he said , he had to move_out of his room whenever a guest requested it . So , to discourage interlopers , he built model airplanes and hung them from the ceiling in mock dogfights . Of course , the model airplane room quickly became the inn ' s most popular . We sailed past the floating mussel farms that have won Penn Cove its culinary acclaim . They are not farms in the conventional sense . Rather , they consist_of anchored wooden rafts with hundreds of orange and yellow ropes suspended from them into the cool , pristine waters . The larvae settle_on the collecting ropes , resembling salt and pepper . A single line produces 45 to 60 pounds of mussels in a year . Workers from Penn Cove Mussels , Inc. , were harvesting the mollusk crop as we sailed past . &quot; It ' s farming and you ' re not taking anything away , &quot; Rawle Jefferds , Penn Cove ' s sales representative , explained the next day . &quot; that ' s the glory of it . All you ' re doing is providing a home for the mussels and they ' re going to be there. &quot; A veritable mussel cove of dreams : If you hang it , they will come . Stone is an unabashed admirer of the tasty bivalves . Each March he holds a four-day mussel festival at the inn . Subscribers to his newsletter send_in recipes that he and his chef test before selecting an annual winner . The prize : a $ 100 gift certificate to the inn . Festival dinners feature Penn Cove mussels in every course . This might include mussels on the half shell , mussels Rockefeller or mussels in a puff pastry with a cream_sauce . Dessert , a challenge , might be mussel mincemeat pie or , incongruously , mussels in a sweet citron sauce . Stone ' s favorite way to prepare the home-grown legend is_on the inn ' s dinner menu every night . Captain Whidbey ginger steamed mussels -- courtesy of the inn ' s first winning recipe -- are prepared with sesame_oil , ginger , garlic , soy_sauce and chili_peppers . That evening , Katherine , our mussel maven , pronounced them among the best she ' s ever tasted : sweet , succulent , terrific . They highlighted a dinner heavy on fresh seafood and greens . We also sampled Stone ' s extensive list of wines and Northwest beers . The next morning , at the Island County Historical Society and Museum in Coupeville , we learned that 19th-Century settlers considered Whidbey Island a paradise . They were impressed by its abundant shellfish , rich alluvial_soil , mild climate and diversity of flora and fauna . Capt . Thomas Coupe , a man of serious visage and long sideburns , filed one of the first land claims on Whidbey Island . When he first visited Penn Cove in 1852 , he wrote to his wife : &quot; I have found the Garden of Eden. &quot; After a short , but memorable , visit , we could relate .
