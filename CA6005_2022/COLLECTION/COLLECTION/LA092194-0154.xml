   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : SAN FERNANDO ; 1991 SLAYING SUSPECT PLEADS NO CONTEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rather than face a trial at which his mother and brother would be the key witnesses against him , a former Canoga Park man pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter Monday in the June , 1991 , stabbing death of his girlfriend . Under terms of his plea agreement , David Joseph Goodman faces the maximum term -- 12 years in state_prison -- when San Fernando Superior_Court Judge Ronald S . Coen sentences him Oct . 18 . According to court records , Goodman , a Jaguar mechanic who was born in Liverpool , England , and has lived_in the United States since 1981 , had violently abused victim Beth Hollander , 32 , during a stormy , eight-year relationship . Before her death , Goodman had attempted to reconcile with Hollander and gave her an $ 800 engagement_ring . But Hollander told a friend the night before she died that she planned to give_back the ring , court records say . The friend described her demeanor during an earlier hearing as &quot; really bummed &quot; about the failed relationship . Hollander ' s body was found early the morning of June 20 , 1991 , behind a dumpster in the 21500 block of Prairie Street . She had been beaten , strangled and stabbed . Police received a break_in the case 16 months later when they received a tip from Hilda Goodman , the defendant ' s mother . She said Goodman admitted the killing to her , and that she had tried to persuade him to surrender to police . Court documents say Goodman told his mother and brother that he stabbed Hollander in self-defense during a quarrel . ANN W . O ' NEILL</TEXT>
