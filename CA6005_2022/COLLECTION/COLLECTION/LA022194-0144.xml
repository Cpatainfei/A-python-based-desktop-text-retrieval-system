   <HEADLINE> PEACE TALKS TO START IN MEXICO BETWEEN REBELS , GOVERNMENT ; REVOLT : INSURGENTS ' DEMANDS FOR LAND AND WATER THREATEN ELITE . NATIONAL POLITICAL REFORM MAY BE TOPIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Talks aimed at peacefully ending a seven-week Indian uprising are scheduled to begin today in this city ' s colonial cathedral . One of the four oldest temples in the Americas and once the church of 16th-Century activist for Indian rights Fray Bartolome de las Casas , the site symbolizes the issues that rebels and a government negotiator have agreed to discuss . Centuries of poverty and repression in Chiapas , Mexico ' s most southern state , are expected to lead the agenda . The rebels have also insisted on talking_about national political reform , although government peace negotiator Manuel Camacho Solis has said he will not make a commitment on that touchy subject . To strengthen their demands for serious discussion of national issues , the rebels invited the country ' s political_parties to attend the talks . Six have accepted . &quot; I understand that decades of demands cannot be resolved at one fell swoop , but I know that with great effort and honesty , advances can be made , &quot; Camacho said recently . Beyond funneling more money into the state , as the government has already pledged to do , it was not clear what Camacho is prepared to offer . Rebel demands for more land and water directly conflict with the interests of a powerful ruling elite that has unabashedly supported the Institutional Revolutionary Party , Mexico ' s ruling party for more_than six decades . They also could put pressure on environmental efforts to protect the Lacandon , North_America ' s last rain_forest . However , government priorities have shifted rapidly since New Year ' s Day , when thousands of well-organized Indian guerrillas took_control of several towns , including this one , and declared war on the Mexican army . During the next 11 days , more_than 100 people were killed in confrontations between the rebels and the army . Investigations by international human_rights organizations led to accusations of army abuses of civilians and suspected rebels . The government called a unilateral cease-fire on Jan . 12 and has been seeking talks ever since . Camacho and mediator Samuel Ruiz , bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas and a well-known Indian-rights activist , arrived_at the cathedral Sunday morning in Red_Cross ambulances with at least 18 rebel delegates . All the delegates were masked and armed . About half were dressed in the rebel uniform of dark pants and shirt and a red bandanna . The others wore traditional Indian clothing . The delegation included Sub-commander Marcos , the masked rebel leader who is the voice of revolution in southern Mexico . For the talks , Camacho said , the cathedral was ringed by three &quot; circles of neutrality &quot; formed by International Red_Cross and Mexican Red_Cross representatives and other non-governmental groups . Unarmed military_police formed a security cordon around them .</TEXT>
