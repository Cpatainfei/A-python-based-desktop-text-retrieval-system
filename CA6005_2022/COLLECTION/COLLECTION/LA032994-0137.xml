   <HEADLINE> HYATT OWNERS SUE TRUMP FOR $ 100 MILLION ; REAL_ESTATE : THEY CONTEND THE DEVELOPER DID NOT PAY HIS SHARE FOR RENOVATIONS TO A JOINTLY OWNED NEW YORK HOTEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Signaling the start of a messy divorce in what thus far has been one of the most profitable marriages in the hotel and real_estate business , the owners of Hyatt Hotels on Monday sued Donald Trump for $ 100 million , alleging that he has deliberately blocked renovations of their jointly owned New York Grand Hyatt hotel in_order to get concessions to alleviate his financial problems . Because Trump has refused to put_up his half of the cost of a proposed $ 37-million renovation of the building , the suit alleges , the Grand Hyatt has deteriorated physically , lost its competitive position in_relation_to other first-class hotels in Manhattan and been downgraded by a leading tourist rating service . Trump responded to the lawsuit Monday with a blast of_his_own . &quot; Hyatt is merely trying to cover_up their total incompetence in the running of the Grand Hyatt , &quot; he said in an interview . &quot; Never before in my career have I witnessed such gross mismanagement . It ' s unbelievable. &quot; The lawsuit against Trump and two of his banks was filed_in federal_court in Manhattan by Refco Properties , Trump ' s 50 % partner in the Grand Hyatt . Refco is a holding of the Pritzker family of Chicago , the owners of Hyatt Hotels . It also charges that Trump threatened to disparage Hyatt ' s management of the Grand and other hotels if the company did not award him the concessions he sought -- including cash payments , the plaintiffs allege . In addition , the suit says Trump secretly ceded his interest in the Grand Hyatt to Bankers Trust Co . and Chemical Bank , two of his leading creditors . That move , an apparent violation of his partnership agreement with Hyatt , left Hyatt in the uneasy position of having two sets of partners : Trump , who had a veto over management plans but no financial interest in the outcome , and the banks , which had a financial interest but no vote . The lawsuit marks what could be a definitive split between Trump and his first major partners in New York real_estate , the highly respected Pritzkers . The building at the core of the dispute was a landmark in the real_estate renaissance of Manhattan in the 1970s -- and , not coincidentally , the foundation of Trump ' s own rise as New York ' s designer-label developer . Trump bought the Commodore Hotel , then a derelict property in the heart of a virtual slum neighborhood , in 1978 . In partnership with Hyatt , he sheathed it in chrome and green glass , extracted a 40-year , $ 60-million tax-abatement agreement from New York City and reopened it in 1981 as the Grand Hyatt . New York ' s economic recovery coincided with its renovation , making Trump look_like a genius and inspiring one critic to cavil that &quot; Donald Trump ' s best ally has been the business cycle. &quot; He followed that project with such high-profile developments as Trump Tower and Trump Plaza in Manhattan and three casino-hotels in Atlantic_City . During the 1990s recession , however , Trump was forced to seek bankruptcy protection for the casinos and the Plaza Hotel in New York ; creditors seized half-interests in those properties in return for restructuring their punishing debt loads . Spokesmen for the Pritzkers said Monday that the family now fears the Grand Hyatt may become a victim of Trump ' s continuing difficulties with his bankers . &quot; We think the hotel is a pawn in a bigger struggle between Trump and his banks , &quot; said Howard Schiffman , a Washington-based lawyer for Refco . &quot; that ' s what ' s made the hotel stalemate . We ' ve come_to the point_in_time where the hotel is losing its competitive edge. &quot; What brought matters_to a boil , both sides say , was Hyatt ' s conclusion in 1990 that the hotel needed at least $ 24 million in renovations to remain competitive . The partnership agreement required Trump to put_up half the money , the Pritzkers contend . They say he was initially in favor of the renovations but in November , 1990 , changed his mind , saying he was &quot; no longer in a financial position &quot; to put_up the money . For his part , Trump contends the Hyatt demand was specifically designed to force him out of the partnership . &quot; When I was in my deepest problems , they came_to me and said , ' We want to renovate the hotel , ' instead of holding_off a little , &quot; Trump said Monday .</TEXT>
