   <HEADLINE> TOYOTA TO INCREASE PRICES MARKEDLY ON ' 95 MODELS ; AUTOS : IMPORTS WILL COST AN AVERAGE OF 6.1 % MORE . COMPANY IS STRUGGLING TO STAY PROFITABLE AS YEN ' S VALUE RISES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a fierce struggle to maintain profitability in the face of a rising yen , Toyota Motor Co . on Friday announced a significant boost in the prices of its 1995 model cars . The Japanese auto giant said the 1995 model import will cost an average of $ 23 # 035 , up $ 1 # 333 -- or 6.1 % -- from the initial price of 1994 models and $ 820 above current prices . The average U.S.-made Toyota will cost $ 16 # 641 , up $ 464 , or 2.9 % . Other Japanese auto_makers , including Honda , have also hinted at price increases , though they have declined to offer specifics . The Japanese auto_maker ' s U.S. dealers say they are unconcerned by the price increases , insisting their buyers are loyal . But the new_wave of price hikes could significantly cut_into Japan ' s share of the U.S. market . &quot; The average Japanese car is already $ 2 # 000 more_than its domestic counterpart , &quot; said David Cole , director of the University of Michigan ' s Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation . &quot; People are recognizing they now have a choice of better domestic cars. &quot; Japanese auto_makers raised sticker prices twice over the course of the 1994 model year , for a total average increase of about 4.8 % . But when price increases resulted in reduced market share , the car_makers in_effect discounted prices by leasing more cars at below-market interest_rates of 3 % to 4 % and depending more heavily on cut-rate volume sales to fleet buyers . Such strategies have been effective in boosting Japan ' s share of the U.S. market in recent months as unusually large_numbers of American auto plants closed to retool for new models . With the new U.S. models entering showrooms , Cole said , the Japanese companies will face a tougher challenge . They are in a weak position to defend themselves . Analysts estimate that every 1-yen rise in the yen ' s value against the dollar costs Toyota about $ 100 million in lost earnings . The No . 1 Japanese car_maker ' s latest price increase will only partially offset foreign_exchange losses resulting from the yen ' s 12 % rise against the dollar over the past year . Indeed , some analysts speculate that the auto_maker will be forced to boost prices again in the spring . On Thursday , Toyota announced that its earnings for the year ended June 30 were $ 1.26 billion , down 29 % from the year before and down 75 % from their 1990 high . Sales fell 8.3 % from the year before to $ 94 billion . Although Toyota has successfully cut costs in recent years , it is already a lean company and has little fat left to cut . Any decline in sales resulting from price increases could actually raise costs by creating excess capacity . &quot; It ' s a classic business dilemma , &quot; Cole said . The good news for Toyota is that price increases for its U.S.-made autos were more modest than for its imports because of the success of the firm ' s campaign to use more American parts at its U.S. plants . &quot; Our intense efforts to localize our supply sources for the U.S.- built Camry have enabled us to hold the average price increase on the entire Camry line to a mere $ 34 over final prices of comparably equipped ' 94 models , &quot; said Dave Illingworth , vice_president at Toyota ' s U.S. headquarters in Torrance . Japanese auto_makers hope to reduce their vulnerability to exchange_rate fluctuations by building more cars in America . Both Honda and Toyota have plans to sharply increase production here . By 1999 , Honda said , it will sharply increase exports from its U.S. plants to 150 # 000 , more_than triple their level last year . An improved home market could also help the embattled Japanese auto_makers . The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn. , an industry trade group , said Friday that domestic sales rose 2.9 % in July from the year before and will rise more sharply in August , signaling an end to the Japanese industry ' s long slump .</TEXT>
