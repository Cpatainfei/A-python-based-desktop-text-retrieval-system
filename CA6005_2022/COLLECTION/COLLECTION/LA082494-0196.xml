   <HEADLINE> KINGS ' MCNALL REPORTEDLY WILL PLEAD GUILTY TO FRAUD ; BUSINESS : SOURCES SAY AGREEMENT STEMS FROM U.S. BANK PROBE . COOPERATION WITH AUTHORITIES MAY SHORTEN TERM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles Kings President Bruce P . McNall , the sports entrepreneur credited with turning Southern California on to professional ice_hockey , has agreed to plead guilty to four criminal counts stemming from a federal bank fraud investigation , sources close to the case confirmed Tuesday . McNall , hailed as recently as a year ago as one of the nation ' s most successful and innovative sports executives , has signed a draft agreement negotiated by his lawyers and federal prosecutors . That agreement calls_for guilty pleas to one count of bank fraud , two counts of mail_fraud and one count of conspiracy , the sources said . A federal grand_jury has been investigating McNall for allegedly falsifying loan documents . Although it is possible for McNall to receive probation from a judge , sources with knowledge of the agreement said that was unlikely , adding that under federal sentencing guidelines and the current plea , McNall probably would face a maximum prison sentence of six to nine years . That sentencing ceiling could be lowered , however . It would depend_on such factors as assistance he provides authorities in investigating his business associates and lenders , repayments made to creditors and his degree of culpability for certain losses from his business operations . Asked about the agreement , Tom Pollack , McNall ' s criminal defense_lawyer , said : &quot; We have had discussions with the government . At an appropriate time , there will be more information. &quot; McNall has been making no public statements on his situation , allowing Pollack to speak_for him . Authorities with the U.S. attorney ' s office declined to comment . McNall would most likely enter a formal plea no earlier than mid-September , with sentencing sometime next year , the sources said . For the moment , McNall has no plans to leave his post as Kings ' president , the sources said . McNall , 44 , was sole owner of the Kings from 1988 until May , when he was forced to sell a 72 % interest in the team to investors Jeffrey Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen because of severe financial problems that eventually led to his filing for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court . McNall remains a minority partner in the team . Once a brash , free-spending executive , McNall brought glitz to the Kings . He boldly acquired superstar Wayne Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers in 1988 in what remains the sport ' s most significant trade ever . Celebrities were drawn to the team , and soon McNall was mingling at games with actors , actresses and former presidents . Such film_stars as Kevin Costner were known to show_up in the Kings ' dressing room to meet the players . His Canadian football_team , the Toronto Argonauts , became trendy , too , after McNall signed former Notre Dame star Raghib ( Rocket ) Ismail . The Argonauts won the Canadian Football_League ' s Grey Cup the first year McNall owned the team and the Kings nearly won the Stanley Cup , losing the 1993 finals in five games to the Montreal Canadiens . McNall swiftly moved_into a position of power in the National Hockey_League , and was elected in June , 1992 , to the post of chairman of the league ' s board of governors . He then personally courted such prominent executives as Walt Disney Co . Chairman Michael D . Eisner of Anaheim ' s Mighty Ducks and Blockbuster Video mogul H . Wayne Huizenga of the Florida Panthers , helping to bring both teams into the league last season . The gregarious and quotable McNall became a celebrity , lauded as one of the country ' s most accessible sports team owners . He became an adept public_speaker and turned his gift of gab into yet another business venture , lecturing audiences a little more_than three years ago for $ 48 a head on &quot; Turning Your Passions Into Profits. &quot; Even before venturing into the high-profile world of sports , McNall was one of the most important figures in the business of ancient coin trading . He put himself on the map by spending a then-world record of $ 420 # 000 on an ancient coin called the Athena decadrachm at a Swiss auction in 1974 . McNall also became a partner in a movie production business that produced such hits as &quot; The Fabulous Baker Boys &quot; and &quot; Weekend at Bernie ' s. &quot; In a separate development Tuesday , securities giant Merrill Lynch , moving to distance itself from McNall ' s legal problems , confirmed that it has settled lawsuits filed on behalf of 3 # 500 investors in three ill-fated partnerships it organized with McNall that invested in rare coins and ancient art . A Merrill Lynch spokesman said that the company expects to eventually pay between $ 20 million and $ 30 million . A source familiar_with the agreement put the settlement amount at around $ 35 million . Merrill Lynch said that it is &quot; extremely concerned &quot; that McNall ' s problems could hurt investors in the funds . McNall is the former managing general partner of the funds . For Merrill Lynch , the coin funds case has mushroomed into a public relations problem in the past six weeks . The Times disclosed in early July that 399 coins bought for $ 3.3 million are mysteriously missing from the funds and that investors are suing over the_matter . Merrill Lynch has reported the incident to Los Angeles police and the FBI . In addition , Florida authorities have confirmed that they have started an informal investigation into sales pitches made_for the funds . In yet another development Tuesday , Joanna Orehek , former vice_president and controller of McNall ' s chief holding company , McNall Sports and Entertainment , pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud in connection with a scheme to defraud four financial_institutions -- Bank of America , Credit Lyonnais , the Bank of California and First Los Angeles Bank -- of more_than $ 138 million in loan proceeds . The government ' s investigation has been bolstered by the continuing cooperation of Orehek , 46 . She was visibly shaken before she entered the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Richard Paez , and about midway through the arraignment Orehek began crying . &quot; She ' s a woman from a small_town in middle America who was caught_up in McNall ' s web , &quot; said William Greysen , a Century City attorney representing Orehek . &quot; . . . She made a misjudgment against her better judgment . &quot; She feels the pain and the hurt . It goes_back to her basic fundamental values of honesty . She had the option to fight the case . She said , ' Why make a bad thing worse ? I want to come forward. ' &quot; Greysen asserted that Orehek was &quot; charmed and manipulated &quot; by McNall to change her lifelong values , saying : &quot; He kept_on persuading her : ' We really need your help. ' She constantly needed reassurance. &quot; Responded McNall lawyer Pollack : &quot; I am sympathetic to the position Miss Orehek finds herself in , but her lawyer ' s effort to minimize her role by pointing to others is refuted by the very charges to which she pleaded guilty. &quot; Orehek will be sentenced Jan . 30 by Paez . She faces a maximum of 10 years in prison , a fine of $ 500 # 000 and supervised release of three years as a result of her guilty pleas , but is cooperating with the government in hopes of receiving a reduced sentence . Orehek is one of about a dozen former McNall employees who have been negotiating pleas with the government .</TEXT>
