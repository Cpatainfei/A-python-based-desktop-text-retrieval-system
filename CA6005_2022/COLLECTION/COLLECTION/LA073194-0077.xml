   <HEADLINE> CRITICS PICK : ' JU DOU '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chinese director Zhang Yimou is to his country ' s film_industry what Kurosawa is to Japan , Satyajit Ray to India . His movies , pictorially bewitching and culturally trenchant , open China up for us cinematically , while his star ( Gong Li , pictured , with Li Bao-Tian ) , is a face for her nation : radiant , mysterious , ambivalent . This film , one of Zhang ' s breakthrough pictures , is a dazzling , disturbing tale of infidelity and murder in a dye factory ( Bravo Monday at 8 p.m. , again at 1 a.m. ) . Michael Wilmington</TEXT>
