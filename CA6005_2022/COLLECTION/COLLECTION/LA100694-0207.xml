   <HEADLINE> 48 DIE IN CULT MURDER-SUICIDE ; SWITZERLAND : FIREFIGHTERS FIND 23 BODIES IN A REMOTE FARMHOUSE AND 25 MORE IN THREE ALPS CHALETS . VICTIMS WERE APPARENTLY MEMBERS OF A SECT LED BY A FUGITIVE CANADIAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Volunteer firefighters responding to a farmhouse fire in this tiny village early Wednesday uncovered an underground chapel and the robe-clad bodies of 23 people , members of an obscure cult joined in an apparent murder-suicide by 25 other adherents in three chalets 100 miles away . The 48 grisly deaths were caused variously by suffocation , gunshots and perhaps drug overdoses , police said . The victims included French , Swiss and Canadian citizens , ranging_in age from 10 to 73 . Some died with their hands clasped in prayer . Authorities believe the deaths may be connected to similar deaths in Canada on Tuesday . In Cheiry , 19 of the victims were found in one 30-yard-long room hidden beneath a secret door under a carpet in the garage . On the wall was a drawing of a bearded man , a &quot; Jesus Christ-like figure , &quot; as one official described it , wearing a cape and carrying a rose . On a makeshift altar were the_French words for &quot; the cross and rose , &quot; which authorities believe is the name of a doomsday sect based in the Canadian_province of Quebec . &quot; It was as if we were entering a wax museum , &quot; said Andre Piller , the_Swiss prosecutor investigating the massacre here . &quot; Everything was peaceful , and the people looked passive . It was very horrifying. &quot; Most of the victims here had been shot once or twice in the head , and 10 had plastic bags cinched over their heads as well . Police said they found 52 casings at the scene from a . 22-caliber rifle . The victims were lying on their backs in a circle . Most were wearing what the police said were ritual robes of white and red , white reportedly being the lowest rank in the order . One man , whom police described as a &quot; grand master &quot; of the sect , wore a black robe . &quot; There was blood everywhere , &quot; said Pierre Torche , 35 , the town mayor and one of the first firefighters to discover the bodies . &quot; It was a bizarre sight. &quot; In two other rooms of the house , police and firefighters found four other victims , including a 10-year-old boy , who had been shot in the head . A woman , possibly the boy ' s mother , lay dead next to him . The owner of the farmhouse , identified as Alberto Giacomino , 73 , was found on his bed , with gunshot wounds and a plastic bag over his head . In addition to the boy , the victims included 10 men , one 18 years old , and 12 women . Members of the sect evidently intended to disappear in a fireball . Throughout the house , located about 40 miles northeast of Geneva , authorities found plastic bags filled with gasoline and bottles filled with propane gas . Some were hooked_up to timing devices and telephone_lines , apparently so they could be detonated by a phone_call . Only a_few of the devices worked , however , and none of the victims in Cheiry was burned , police said . &quot; We ' re still reeling from what we found , &quot; Piller told a late-night news_conference . &quot; We have no indication why they chose this day for their mass suicide . At the moment , we have no idea why these people died . We aren ' t even sure whether it ' s a homicide or a suicide yet. &quot; An audiocassette tape found at the scene contained remarks about astrology , the police said , but it gave no reasons for the deaths . About the same time that firefighters were making their discovery here , fires broke_out in three ski chalets in the_Swiss Alps , near Granges-sur-Salvan . A total of 25 bodies were pulled from those smoldering chalets Wednesday . There were no signs of violence in those deaths ; most of the victims appeared to have died before the fires , perhaps having been poisoned or drugged , police said . Investigators linked the two events when they found cars from Cheiry at the Alps massacre site . And two of the chalets were owned by Luc Jouret , 46 , said by authorities and cult experts to be the leader of two related extremist sects : the Cross and Rose and the Order of the Solar Temple . Literature for the Cross and Rose was found in the Cheiry farmhouse along with other religious artifacts , police said . Although all_the victims in Switzerland have not been identified , authorities said that Jouret , who once described himself as &quot; the new Christ , &quot; did not appear to be among them . Authorities were investigating links to the sect in Quebec , where an arson fire in a duplex next to one owned by Jouret left two people dead Tuesday morning . Those victims , a man and a woman , were not yet identified . But police said they believed they were members of the cult . &quot; We found medallions around their necks with the inscription T and S , which could stand_for Temple Soleil , &quot; Michel Brunet , a spokesman for the provincial police , said . Temple Soleil is the_French translation of Solar Temple . Brunet also said the Canadian fire , on a mountainside in the town of Morin Heights about 50 miles north of Montreal , was caused by the same type of explosive_device blamed in Switzerland -- five gas_tanks linked to each other with wires and timers . Quebec police have long had the Solar Temple cult under investigation . Police arrested several members last year and charged them with illegal possession of weapons . Jouret reportedly fled from Canada to Switzerland in 1993 , when Canadian authorities issued a nationwide arrest_warrant charging him with weapons possession and conspiracy . Montreal Crown Prosecutor Jean-Claude Boyer , who worked_on the arms case , said members of Solar Temple &quot; saw themselves as superior human_beings whose survival was needed to relaunch the human_race after a cataclysm they saw coming because of the deterioration in world affairs. &quot; But Boyer said Jouret and his associates &quot; looked_like businessmen ; there was nothing crazy about them. &quot; On Wednesday , the two-story farmhouse in Cheiry was blackened and smoldering . On a table inside in a room undamaged by fire was a red rose in a vase . The shells of two burned cars and a tractor were in the barn . The tranquil , picturesque town of 230 inhabitants was shocked by the deaths but even more astonished that a cult could be operating in the prominent hillside home without being noticed . Giacomino bought the farmhouse four years ago and lived there with four other people , residents said . Torche , the mayor , said the property had been purchased by a company that wanted to do &quot; biological cultivation &quot; research and had chosen the spot because it received more sun than houses nearer the town center in the valley . Many in town remembered seeing the owner buying cigarettes at the cafe or stocking up_on building supplies that he said were being used to renovate the farmhouse . &quot; We didn ' t know him well , &quot; said one neighbor . &quot; But he seemed OK , just a nice old guy. &quot; &quot; I didn ' t find anything strange about the fact that they kept to themselves , &quot; said Torche , the soot from the fire still clinging_to his gray fireman ' s jumpsuit 12 hours later . &quot; A lot of people up here do . Swiss authorities surmise that the house was a meeting_place for the sect . When the firefighters first arrived_at the house , shortly after midnight , they battled the blaze for nearly four hours . Then , joined by the police , they searched for what they thought would be just the residents , starting in the woods and moving_into the living quarters . It was only after finding four victims in the house that they discovered the door leading to the windowless underground chapel . &quot; It was frightful , &quot; said Beat Karlen , a spokesman for the police . &quot; When you enter into a place like that , where you find so many bodies , it ' s atrocious . Just atrocious. &quot; Times staff writer Stanley Meisler in Montreal contributed to this report . * PATTERN OF DEATH : Swiss scenes resemble earlier cult massacres .
