   <HEADLINE> GRANDPARENTS TESTIFY IN DEATH OF INFANT BITTEN BY RAT ; COURT : THE VEHICLE WHERE THE COUPLE ' S 4-MONTH-OLD GRANDSON AND HIS PARENTS LIVED WAS INFESTED WITH ROACHES AND STREWN WITH TRASH AND SPOILED FOOD , THEY SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The grandparents of a 4-month-old boy who prosecutors contend died after being bitten more_than 100 times by a pet rat told a jury Tuesday that the car the family was living_in when the baby was fatally injured was cluttered with spoiled food , trash and cockroaches . The grandfather , Dennis Giguere , testified that he cleaned_out the contents of the station_wagon two or three days after the child ' s death and found rat feces , a rat nest fashioned from clothing and pieces of stuffed toys , gnawed baby formula caps , a chewed seat_belt and cockroaches &quot; just about everywhere. &quot; When asked by the defense how many cockroaches there were , Giguere responded , &quot; I couldn ' t estimate . Hundreds. &quot; The parents of the baby , Steven Sr . and Kathyleen Giguere , are being tried_on charges of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment for allegedly leaving Steven Jr . alone in the car with a rat who bit him more_than 100 times . The infant ' s grandmother , Dianne Giguere , testified that she and her husband also found half-filled baby jars , a half-eaten hamburger and two pillows , one lying next to the car in the Anaheim lot where the family had camped . She said the pillows were spotted with what she believed were bloodstains . She said the car did not contain a cage , food or water for the pet rat . Another witness for the prosecution , Dr. Richard Evans , the veterinarian who examined the rat after it had been captured and killed , said it was &quot; moderately to severely &quot; starved . Evans , who is chief of veterinary services for the Orange County Health_Care Agency , said the necropsy he performed showed that the rat had suffered erosion of its muscle and fat reserves . It also had an atrophied liver , an empty intestine and a stomach that was &quot; completely packed &quot; with clotted blood and skin , he said . Attorneys for the parents asked Evans why he had not preserved the animal ' s tissues that other pathologists could examine . &quot; I felt firm in my diagnosis , &quot; said Evans , who concluded that the rat had eaten little or nothing for 72 hours before attacking the infant and had been malnourished for at least a week , possibly several months . Under questioning , Evans acknowledged that he had made some mistakes in his original written report on the necropsy , which he later corrected . He said that he had written that the rat was starved on a scale of 1 to 2 , meaning mild to moderate , when the evidence clearly showed that the animal ' s condition was more serious and should have been ranked 2 to 3 . William Watson , a lawyer representing Kathyleen Giguere , said in an interview that the defense will seek to prove that the rat was not starving but living_on all_the food found inside the car . The defense also contends that the rat did not kill the infant because the child was already dead before it was bitten , possibly due_to sudden_infant_death_syndrome or a congenital breathing disorder . Dianne Giguere said her stepson and his wife lived_in slovenly conditions even before they , the baby and their 3-year-old daughter were evicted from an apartment in Anaheim . She said whenever she visited the apartment she found dirty dishes in the kitchen_sink and on the counter , baby bottles filled with curdled milk , scattered beer and whiskey_bottles , and dirty clothes piled in the bathroom . Only 48 hours before the baby ' s death , Dianne Giguere said , she alerted the county social_services department of her concerns about the welfare of the Giguere children . But officials were unable to find the transient family to investigate the complaint .</TEXT>
