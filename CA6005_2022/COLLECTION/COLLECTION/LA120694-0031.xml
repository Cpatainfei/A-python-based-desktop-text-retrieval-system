   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; AT_PEACE , BUT STILL NOT FRIENDS ; ARABS ARE RELUCTANT TO FULLY NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL EVEN AFTER THREE HISTORIC TREATIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the gala opening of the annual Cairo International Film Festival last week , jewel-bedecked stars and new films from throughout the Middle_East were_on display . Top filmmakers from Syria , Algeria , Morocco and Egypt rubbed elbows . What wasn ' t there , in this era of Middle_East glasnost , was anyone from Israel . Despite the Jerusalem government ' s repeated requests over the years to take_part in the event , there were no Israeli films and no Israeli stars . The Israeli Embassy ' s cultural_attache to Egypt -- until this year the only Arab country with which Israel was at_peace -- stayed home . The festival might have set a different tone , since the past two years have seen Israel signing peace agreements with Jordan and the Palestinians that mirror its landmark , 15-year-old peace_treaty with Egypt . But that didn ' t happen . The audience sat_back opening_night to a three-hour premiere of &quot; The Road to Eilat , &quot; a heady celebration of a successful Egyptian amphibious_operation against the Israeli navy in 1969 . What happened to peace and cooperation ? It was being celebrated across town at the Giza Zoo , where officials , with much fanfare , signed a new cooperative agreement with the Tel Aviv Zoo . But that pact drew a disdainful response from Saad Eddin Wahba , the film festival director . &quot; Only donkeys , monkeys and foxes are interested in normalizing relations with Israel , &quot; he sneered . Normalization has come hard , even with Egypt . The momentous peace agreement signed at the White_House last year by Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat raised hopes that have yet to be met , or even approached . The hands that clasped in Washington , that led to the Nobel Peace Prize for Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , Arafat and Rabin , remain firmly pocketed most of the time back home_in the Middle_East . The film festival snub wasn ' t unusual : No Israeli film has ever been shown in Egypt . A number of Egyptian tour companies began offering travel packages to Israel for the first time earlier this year , but then all but one canceled them by September . The artists , directors , actors , musicians , lawyers , engineers , doctors and journalists syndicates all forbid their members to travel_to the Jewish state . Fifteen years into peace between Egypt and Israel , there are only two major joint economic projects under way -- both launched only this year . The peace_treaties signed with both Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization have plunged the Arab world into one of the most difficult dilemmas of peace : How much , and on whose terms ? When governments sign treaties , are citizens obligated to follow with open arms ? Exactly when will Israel finally become a functioning partner -- economically , socially and culturally -- in its own neighborhood ? &quot; The battle of political and cultural normalization with the Jews is the fiercest battle facing us , &quot; Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt said at a recent conference in Beirut called specifically to find ways to combat moves toward normalizing relations . For a wide spectrum of Arabs , peace as a means of ending more_than four decades of warfare is an idea whose time has come . But going a further step and embracing Israel as a partner and neighbor is an idea with little appeal for most Arabs . &quot; Normalization &quot; has become a hot new debate from Morocco to the Persian_Gulf , and in most quarters it is being greeted with suspicion , if not outright hostility . &quot; Normalization is defined as a normal relationship with the state of Israel on cultural , political and social levels . We do not believe that normalization is possible for the simple reason that Israel is a colonial settler state which occupies Arab lands and practices all forms of violence and human_rights violations , &quot; said Radwa Ashour , a Cairo novelist and professor who is_active in the Committee to Protect the National Culture . One of its primary goals is guarding against cultural cooperation with Israel . In Jordan , the National Islamic Front issued a religious decree against normalization , declaring that &quot; God has strictly forbidden subservience to those who usurp the land of Muslims or expel them from their homes , &quot; and warning &quot; honorable merchants &quot; not to &quot; buy the goods of the Jews or deal with them or engage in any form of industrial , tourist or agricultural cooperation. &quot; In Lebanon , Islamic intellectuals and secular nationalists from around the Arab world met in October and agreed on a program to schedule meetings , rallies and seminars as a means of &quot; rejection of normalization with the Zionist enemy. &quot; &quot; Agreements between governments do not concern us . Nationalism is not so_much a government concern as it is the concern of the people , &quot; declared Mohammed Baalbeki , president of the Lebanese Press Assn . Hezbollah , the Islamic militia fighting Israeli occupation in the south of Lebanon , said it would conduct regular mosque sermons urging Muslims to boycott Israeli products , deter the exchange of tourist , cultural and educational delegations , and obstruct trade with the Jewish state . For the Israeli Embassy in Cairo , one of the low points came only a_few weeks ago , when heavy factional fighting between Palestinian Islamic militants and the Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip was greeted with editorials in all three government dailies in Egypt -- blaming the Israelis , who hadn ' t even been present . Israeli diplomats complained they had never had an opportunity to meet with Egypt ' s top newspaper_editors -- their overtures were repeatedly rebuffed -- and asked whether this was the way to repay Israel ' s peace initiatives with the Arabs . Arabs see the normalization card , particularly on the cultural level , as the ordinary citizen ' s last means of expressing opposition to Israel ' s continued occupation of the West_Bank , Golan Heights and the self-declared security zone in south Lebanon . &quot; Israel perceives of culture as a point_of_entry to the Egyptian mind . Yet Egyptians -- and here I mean the people rather than the government , which abides_by the spirit and text of the treaty -- have been reluctant to engage in cultural relations , &quot; said Salaheddin Hafez , managing editor of Cairo ' s semiofficial Al Ahram newspaper . &quot; Cultural normalization should be conditional on Israel meeting the legitimate demands of the government , demands that include Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab lands and compliance with international conventions eliminating weapons of mass destruction , &quot; Hafez added . &quot; The meeting of such conditions would display Israeli commitment to a comprehensive peace in the region . And without such a commitment , any talk_about a culture of peace remains pie in the sky. &quot; Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosni , at a meeting of writers and intellectuals in the southern Egyptian city of Luxor last month , urged Arabs to begin embarking_on cultural normalization as a natural follow-up to strides already being made on the agricultural , trade and economic front , most notably with the recent Middle_East economic summit in Morocco . Since the signing of the Israeli-PLO accord , Egypt has opened its border with Israel at Rafah 24 hours a day and dispatched four government_ministers on visits since June . A delegation of 50 Egyptian business_leaders visited Tel Aviv to discuss trade issues Nov . 5 , about the same time that the Israeli shekel , for the first time in history , began being traded_in Egyptian banks . Overall , 12 # 000 Egyptian tourists visited Israel this past year -- up from almost none in past years , though still much lower than the 150 # 000 Israelis who came_to Egypt -- and trade volume between Egypt and Israel is expected to reach $ 35 million this year , a nearly fourfold increase over 1992 . Yet many Arabs are skittish even on the economic front . Though the Arab boycott against Israel is falling to shreds in the wealthy Arab countries of the Gulf , such_as Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia , it remains in full force in Syria and Lebanon . Lebanon , the Arab world ' s historic commercial center before its disastrous civil_war , is at the forefront of those Arab states who fear that Israel will quickly dominate any new Middle_East market at the expense of the Arabs . &quot; The normalization of relations with Israel is against the interests of Lebanon , particularly on the economic side . We already compete with Israel , especially in tourism and banking . We used to be the banking center of the Arab world , and we would like to be again , &quot; said Issam Naaman , a member_of_Parliament in Lebanon . &quot; In the case of normalization of relations , we would be losing on both fronts. &quot; Syrians , Lebanese and Jordanians have been critical of the few cultural strides made between Israel and the Arab world . At the Lebanese anti-normalization conference , Arabs complained that Israel is successfully seeking to change the way history is taught to Arab students and to redraw maps of Palestine to show the presence of Israel . An Israeli official , who asked not to be identified , said that indeed Israel had insisted , as part of the Camp David accords , that references_to Israel as &quot; the enemy &quot; in school textbooks be deleted . &quot; After you make a peace_treaty with a country , it is only natural that you won ' t call it the enemy again , &quot; he said . He said Israel wishes the Arabs would undergo the same kind of &quot; education for peace &quot; that Israel is embarking_on -- requiring all students to learn Arabic , teaching them about the benefits of peace . &quot; We are in the midst of a hell of a peace process . We explain to children what is the peace process , what are the circumstances , what are the consequences , what can it bring . I would be very glad if this kind of stuff would be taught in Egyptian and Arab schools , &quot; the official remarked . &quot; I don ' t say all Arabs should learn Hebrew . But it shows an attitude to education. &quot; In the midst of the storm , a growing number of Arab intellectuals are bucking the prevailing winds , tentatively cracking a door that many believe will open full-scale once the economic benefits of peace begin to take_hold . Both the journalists and musicians syndicates in Cairo have indicated they are going_to review their longstanding ban on travel_to Israel early next year , reflecting the fact that some artists and writers are already , in fact , traveling_to the Jewish state . Egyptian singer Medhat Saleh traveled_to Israel to perform three concerts in March , which he said were intended &quot; to share with the Palestinians their joy for regaining a precious part of their land. &quot; Playwright Ali Salem followed a month later , embarking_on a 23-day odyssey around Israel after which he wrote a book on his impressions of the Jewish state , &quot; A Trip to Israel. &quot; The book has been scornfully received in Cairo . &quot; Some people say , ' We are with peace , but where is it ? We have to wait till its implementation , ' &quot; Salem said . &quot; I say , OK , you wait . I ' m not going_to wait . I ' m going_to share_in making_it . that ' s all . Because peace will not make itself. &quot; In counterpoint to the vitriol hurled at him in the Egyptian press , Salem got dozens of letters of support from readers . One came from a man in Zawya al Hamra , one of Cairo ' s worst slums . The man identified himself as &quot; a very simple Egyptian citizen. &quot; &quot; I read what you said about your trip to Israel , and I admired it . It proves to every citizen that you are a patriot , &quot; the man wrote . &quot; I thought_of this and I said to myself , ' Why haven ' t our thinkers gone_to invade Israel to find_out what they are thinking_about our future as Arabs and Israelis ? ' Instead of burying our heads in the sand , why don ' t we converse with them ? Why don ' t we find_out what they want from us , and what we need from them ? &quot; Otherwise , the man wrote , &quot; why is there a peace ? Was it to stop wars only ? &quot;</TEXT>
