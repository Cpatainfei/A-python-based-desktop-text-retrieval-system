   <HEADLINE> OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS : TALKS AIM TO SALVAGE MEXICAN TUNA SEASON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> San Diego ' s fleet of long-range boats is preparing_for another season at Mexico ' s Revillagigedo Islands , home of the world ' s largest yellowfin_tuna . Trouble is , there might not be a season . Mexico has called_for a management plan to be developed for the offshore archipelago , which last June was designated a nature reserve . And until the plan is completed , the government says no sportfishing permits will be issued . The plan is scheduled for completion in January , which would be_well into the long-range season . The plan would then be subject_to review and would not have to be activated until June 5 , 1995 . The season would be over and the fleet would be out hundreds of thousands of dollars . The Sportfishing Assn . of California , which represents the interests of the Southern California fleet , is not giving_up . Barnard Thompson , an attorney hired by SAC , has been talking with Santiago Onate Laborde , chief_of_staff for lame-duck President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . Thompson was told that when Mexico ' s Desert Bighorn Reserve was established a_few years ago , a similar situation existed for hunters from the United States . Because they had historically been issued permits , an exception was made and they were able to conduct limited hunts . Thompson said he might be able to use that as a precedent . &quot; The issue has now reached the highest levels in Mexico , &quot; Thompson said in a statement . &quot; And we can but hope that some sort of solution will be found in_order to issue , at the very least , provisional permits until the management plan is implemented. &quot; * Just when it seemed things were getting_back to normal . . . . According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the El Nino phenomenon that creates abnormal weather patterns on both sides of the Pacific and sends unusually warm water up the coast of California , appears to be developing again in the tropics . NOAA said in a news release that during El Nino , the abnormal warming of the eastern Pacific usually begins in mid to late December and peaks in spring , which , depending_on its magnitude , could bring tuna , dorado and blue_marlin -- among other tropical and subtropical species -- into local waters as it did_in 1992-93 . * Dogs often chase cats , but Buddy the_pit bull nearly met his match recently near Boulder , Colo . Western Outdoors magazine reports that Mark Norton , 30 , of Boulder , had pulled over at a mountain turnoff to let his dog take_care of business , but the animal , a bull terrier-English Staffordshire mix , instead ran snarling into the bushes . Norton ran to the rear of the car , where the dog had clamped its powerful jaws on a cougar ' s throat . The big_cat eventually broke free , however , and took_off with another cougar that had been standing nearby . Buddy was treated for puncture wounds on his head and scratches on his chest . Norton credited the &quot; lock-jaw ability pit bulls are so famous for &quot; for saving its life . Briefly SOUTHLAND FISHING -- The local fleet has basically said goodby to the tuna and hello to chili_peppers , reds , vermillions and the rest of the bottom-huggers generally lumped into the rockfish category . There are still some flurries of big-game activity , however , notably at the northern Channel Islands , where squid have ridden the currents , throwing white sea_bass into a mild frenzy . &quot; We had a feeling they were there , but trying to get the people to go_out there on a hunch was difficult , &quot; said John Shull , skipper of CISCO Sportfishing ' s Pacific Dawn , which along with other Oxnard boats will be making trips to the islands as long as the bite lasts . The Grande reported 21 fish -- between 15 and 25 pounds -- on Monday and 24 on Tuesday . BAJA FISHING -- The Bisbee ' s Black and Blue_marlin tournament gets under way today off Cabo San Lucas , and it figures to be competitive as blue_marlin , though not as abundant as in previous weeks , are showing daily . Largest of the week , a 620-pounder caught by Jim Wettlaufer of Massachusetts aboard La Brisa . The black_marlin that stormed the area two weeks ago seem to have left , although Larry Burson of Jig Stop Tackle in Dana Point did land a 551-pounder on the panga Catalina . The small-game scene is dominated by dorado , which have invaded the Sea of Cortez in what some are calling record numbers . The fish are thick north to the East Cape region and beyond to La Paz . Farther north at Loreto , the focus is shifting from dorado and sailfish to yellowtail and cabrilla . NOTEWORTHY -- The Billfish Foundation is holding its annual conservation awards dinner on Thursday at Ft . Lauderdale , Fla . Cortez Yacht Charters of Lemon Grove , which specializes in fishing trips to Baja and is a staunch promoter of catch-and-release , will be honored as the recipient of the award for group achievement for its promotion of billfish conservation . HUNTING -- San Diego ' s city lakes ' duck program is under way , with mixed results . Barrett was the most productive , as 50 hunters on Saturday bagged 107 ducks , with mallards , widgeons and ringnecks accounting_for most . At Sutherland , 24 hunters on Sunday shot 20 ducks , mostly mallards . At Otay , 40 hunters killed 39 ducks , mostly green-wing teals . . . . The Department of Fish and Game says more_than 100 tags remain for the A-24 Monterey either-sex archery deer hunt , which ends Nov . 6 . Details : ( 408 ) 649-2870 . SURFING -- Surfline-Wavetrak reported in its newsletter that Florida surfer Tyler Callaway &quot; almost became a part of the food_chain &quot; recently at a Sunshine_State surf spot called Stuart Rocks . Tyler was reported as having pulled his foot from the mouth of a black-tip shark in the nick of time . His cuts required 27 stitches but , according to Wavetrak , &quot; he still has all his toes. &quot;</TEXT>
