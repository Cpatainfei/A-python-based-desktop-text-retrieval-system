   <HEADLINE> LIBYA THRASHING ABOUT TO SHAKE U.N. SANCTIONS HOOK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In one of several desperate bids to ease the tightening grip of U.N. sanctions , Moammar Kadafi ' s troubled regime in Libya has held_out the prospect of turning_over an indicted CIA renegade to appease the U.S._government , according to U.S. sources and a former CIA official . Libya also may be willing to pay millions of dollars in compensation to families of those who died in the 1988 bombing over Scotland of Pan American Flight 103 in hopes of eliminating its most outspoken critics and thus easing international pressure , according to families and their representatives . But neither the Clinton_Administration nor the families of victims appear interested in either possibility because they want to maintain pressure on the Kadafi regime and hold it accountable for the disaster . The moves and other recent steps come as Libya today marks the 25th anniversary of Kadafi ' s bloodless military coup ending the reign of King Idris I in 1969 . U.N. sanctions imposed last December coupled with plummeting prices have cut annual oil revenues from $ 21 billion a decade ago to about $ 6 billion , making this the most difficult year of Kadafi ' s rule , according to U.S. and Arab officials . As a result , Tripoli has spent at least $ 50 million in two years on ploys first to prevent sanctions , then to negotiate an easing of the punitive economic , arms and air_travel restrictions , a U.S. official said . The sanctions were imposed after Libya failed to cooperate with investigations of the Pan Am Flight 103 disaster and the bombing in 1989 over Niger of a French airliner in which 171 died . &quot; The Libyans are out there trying to make as_many inroads as possible , &quot; said a senior U.S. counterterrorism official . &quot; Every third_person who has ever held a government position in this town has called us and said they ' ve been approached . And each claimed to have a great_deal going. &quot; One of the latest centers_on CIA renegade Frank Terpil , a communications expert indicted with CIA undercover_agent Edmund Wilson in 1980 for conspiring to kill a Libyan dissident and for selling tons of explosives to Libya . The episode was one of the CIA ' s darkest , most embarrassing moments . Terpil -- convicted in absentia and sentenced in New York to 30 years on arms charges -- has spent the intervening years in Libya , Syria and Lebanon , as well as in Eastern Europe before communism ' s demise there . According to a former government official who keeps close track of the fugitive , Terpil recently has spent limited time in Libya and has been spotted throughout Eastern and Western Europe , as well as in Havana . Abdullah Sanoussi , chief of Libyan intelligence , was scheduled to meet in late June in Cairo with former CIA counterterrorism expert Vincent Cannistraro to discuss possible assistance with Terpil ' s capture , according to Cannistraro and U.S. officials . The meeting was postponed after Sanoussi , Kadafi ' s brother-in-law and closest confidant , was injured in a car accident , Cannistraro said . Officials of the Arab League , headquartered in Cairo , set_up the meeting , he said . Several Arab governments are unhappy about the U.N. sanctions because of the effect on_their_own economies or angry because of perceived Western anti-Islamic or anti-Arab bias . Egypt , for example , has about 750 # 000 workers in Libya whose remittances to relatives at_home are vital to Egypt ' s economy . Egypt &quot; also needs Libya as a safety_valve for foreign employment of a significant portion of its labor_force , &quot; a U.S. specialist said . Libya ' s approach to Cannistraro fits what has become its modus_operandi of trying to hire well-known figures to plead its case . At the CIA , Cannistraro investigated Libyan links with international terrorism . Having appeared on many U.S. television_programs and served as an ABC News consultant , he is now the most visible former CIA counterterrorism official . In the past , Libya or its representatives have tried to hire such figures as Judge Abraham Sofaer , who as chief State_Department legal adviser during terrorism attacks in the 1980s helped develop the case against Libya ' s use of state-sponsored terrorism . Famed defense_lawyer F . Lee Bailey , who represented five clients in the Pan Am bombing , went_to Tripoli last year to discuss Libya ' s request that he defend Abdel Basset Ali Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah , the two Libyans indicted by the United States and Scotland for the Pan Am bombing , in which 270 people died . Bailey subsequently complained about not being paid a $ 40 # 000 fee for the four-day consultation , although the National Law Journal reported that he received $ 15 # 000 in expenses . Cannistraro said he agreed to talk with the Libyan intelligence chief as a &quot; volunteer &quot; and did not stand to benefit from the meeting financially or otherwise . He described Libya ' s motive as &quot; an attempt to get_out from under sanctions. &quot; But U.S. counterterrorism officials , informed in June of the meeting , said Wednesday that they did not authorize any deal . &quot; We know the Libyans are mounting a sophisticated diplomatic and public relations campaign , &quot; the senior official said . &quot; The Libyans know our terms &quot; on Pan Am Flight 103 and terrorism generally , &quot; and they do not include Frank Terpil. &quot; Like Carlos the Jackal , the terrorist extradited from Sudan to France last month , Terpil is a figure from the past and is no longer as urgently sought , U.S. sources said . Libya may have held him out as bait because he has been so elusive for 15 years . His colleague Wilson was duped , in an elaborate U.S. scheme , into leaving Libya in 1982 for the Dominican_Republic . There , officials put him on a plane for New York on grounds that his papers were not in_order . Federal_agents were waiting for him and he is now in prison . A similar scheme in Beirut in the early 1980s failed when Terpil slipped_away . Later , in Prague , a planted intermediary offered him payment for a news &quot; interview &quot; to be conducted in London , but he did not take the bait . Although Cannistraro predicted last week that the meeting to discuss Terpil ' s capture might be rescheduled for this week , he said Wednesday that he now believes the exercise was &quot; strictly propaganda &quot; and has disassociated himself from it . Concern is also growing among some families of Pan Am victims that a class-action lawsuit would ease pressure to hold Kadafi accountable for the bombing . Many angry relatives of victims claim the lawsuit amounts to an attempt to get them to stop demanding accountability or tougher action . The suit seeks $ 3 billion or up_to $ 11.5 million per family . It was filed by U.S. lawyer Allan Gerson against Libya in June . If the court agrees to hear the case , all victims ' families are automatically included , unless they opt_out . Gerson has argued that financial compensation is a form of punishment -- and may be the only recourse for families because of the inability of the United States and United Nations to get Kadafi to hand_over Megrahi and Fhimah . &quot; Even for an oil-rich country , $ 3 billion adds_up , &quot; he said . But several families assert that the ultimate goal is a pretrial settlement that might serve to help get Libya off_the_hook . Some families and their representatives believe the framework of a deal already may have been cut_in exploratory talks between Gerson and Abdelhay Sefrioui , one of Libya ' s lawyers based in Paris . Tripoli ' s maneuverings reflect its escalating problems . Since sanctions were imposed , Libya ' s deteriorating economy has taken a nose-dive , U.S. officials said . Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostrow contributed to this report .</TEXT>
