   <HEADLINE> CAPITOL JOURNAL : WALKING THE BORDERLINE ON IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Latino leader abruptly reminded Treasurer Kathleen Brown Tuesday why , for her , the issue of illegal immigration is another big loser . The episode showed why immigration -- as well as crime -- are topics that , for her own sake , the less said the better until after Election_Day . Brown , in her words , had just spoken &quot; from my heart and from my head and from my gut &quot; about illegal immigration to the prestigious Commonwealth Club of San Francisco . She called illegal immigration &quot; a serious problem &quot; -- a statement aimed at rectifying a previous blunder -- and outlined &quot; fair-minded , smart &quot; solutions : Beefing_up border_patrols , penalizing employers , issuing tamper-proof Social_Security cards , suing Washington and deporting felons . But she painted a sharp contrast between herself and Gov . Pete Wilson , whom she accused of &quot; fanning fears. &quot; Unlike Wilson , Brown adamantly opposes Proposition 187 and formally came_out against it in her Commonwealth speech . Wilson probably will officially endorse the initiative this weekend at a Republican state convention in San Diego . The measure would deny illegal immigrants most government services , including education . It also contains a snitch clause requiring public officials to report suspected illegal immigrants to the INS . Brown called the measure &quot; a cheap political trick that Pete Wilson is promoting and encouraging and inflaming. &quot; It ' s &quot; mean-spirited and wrongheaded &quot; and punishes innocent children , she said . And she wondered how someone might become suspect . &quot; By the color of their skin ? By the accent ? The last_name maybe ? Maybe the way you dress ? Maybe the cut of the cloth you ' re wearing ? &quot; * The Democratic gubernatorial candidate was walking a tight line : Siding with the 70 % of registered voters -- according to the latest Times poll -- who regard illegal immigration as a major problem , while courting Latinos whose help she ' ll need to beat the front-running governor . When she took audience questions and got a query from the Latino , Brown was jarred with the realization that her path likely is going nowhere , though not to follow it would mean sliding over a political cliff . For her to back Proposition 187 -- and cozy_up to the 62 % of likely voters who support it -- would be the pinnacle of cynicism . But there ' s nothing she can do to satisfy many Latino leaders on immigration short of minimizing the entire issue and jumping_off that cliff . &quot; As a second-generation Hispanic , I ' m personally disappointed at the lack of sensitivity that encourages immigrant-bashing by all candidates , &quot; read the written question . &quot; The war on illegal immigration is destroying a lot of trust and initiative among legal Hispanic citizens . How will you gain the trust of Hispanic citizens any more_than Gov . Wilson ? &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; Brown replied slowly , with a sigh . &quot; That was very much what my remarks were intended to do today . . . in thoughtful terms. &quot; Looking disheartened , she summarized her long speech , again attacked Wilson , then her voice tailed off . Afterward , I found the questioner . He was Anthony U . Martinez , 50 , a business management professor at University of San Francisco and a board_member of the Commonwealth Club . He ' s also a Republican . But he ' ll likely vote for Brown , Martinez added , because her Administration would have more diversity . Regardless , he was critical of Brown . &quot; All candidates have gotten_on the bandwagon , &quot; he said . &quot; All the problems of our economy are being blamed on illegal immigration . She ought to raise the bigger issue of competitiveness . . . . It ' s very upsetting . Hispanics are being used as a target. &quot; Brown actually has talked repeatedly about making California more competitive . * I ' ve heard many Latinos -- politicians and activists -- express similar sentiments . But they may be out of step with their communities . The Times poll found that 61 % of Latino voters consider illegal immigration a major problem . Still , Brown needs the leaders to drum_up enthusiasm for her in these Latino communities . She ' s done about all she can do . In fact , she committed one of her biggest campaign errors trying to please Latino leaders one year ago . She met with dozens at her home to preview a speech attacking illegal immigration . Their unhappiness prompted her to insert a line about illegal immigration being &quot; wrongly seen as a cause &quot; of problems . Wilson jumped_on it . Brown accused him of taking her words out of context . But , in truth , it was Brown herself who put confusing out-of-context words in her speech . Brown should now focus_on other areas , such_as the one where she outscores Wilson every time : education .</TEXT>
