   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; INDECISIVENESS IS CRUX OF U.S. POLICY ON HAITI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A White_House official was taken_aback this week when asked how the twists and turns of U.S. policy on Haiti fit into an overall American strategy . &quot; We aren ' t answering questions about strategy today , &quot; the official snapped . That may be the core of the Clinton_Administration ' s problem as it grapples with Haiti , a policy nightmare that has come_to torment officials out of all proportion to its size . American attempts to staunch the flood of refugees from the impoverished , military-ruled country have produced only disarray -- and television images of drowning refugees . Its attempts to rattle the saber of American military might at the regime in Port-au-Prince have frightened members of Congress but apparently not members of the Haitian junta . As a result , the Administration has found itself lurching from crisis to crisis , from one attempted quick_fix to another -- and is now finding itself drawn toward an unwanted decision on military intervention . &quot; The President is in a peculiar and dangerous position on Haiti , &quot; warned Georges Fauriol of the private , nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies here . &quot; He has said the military regime must go . He has put his credibility on the line . But he doesn ' t have any way to make them go . . . unless he launches an invasion. &quot; Clinton and his aides have insisted they would prefer to see Haiti ' s generals leave peacefully , under the pressure of the economic and political sanctions that the United States has imposed . But it could take months for the sanctions to topple the regime , if they do at all . Meanwhile , the near-collapse of Haiti ' s economy , coupled with U.S. promises to treat refugees humanely , has touched_off the exodus of more_than 15 # 000 people in the past three weeks . &quot; Eventually , the sanctions might work , &quot; Fauriol noted . &quot; But at this rate , the flow of refugees will overwhelm everyone first. &quot; To reinforce the sanctions , Clinton and his aides have warned publicly that the United States might invade Haiti and overthrow the generals by force . This week , they announced that a task_force including 2 # 000 Marines with helicopters and landing_craft was_on its way to the Caribbean . The stated reason was to be prepared in case U.S. citizens in Haiti should need protection . They also confirmed that the Army and Navy have staged an exercise in Florida to simulate a landing in Port-au-Prince . But the saber-rattling fell a bit flat when Clinton ' s special envoy to Haiti , William H . Gray III , said the United States still does not want to invade and suggested that the regime ' s deadline for stepping_down is the end of the year . &quot; This is another sign that the Americans aren ' t serious , &quot; said a Haitian business_leader now in the United States . The military &quot; will see it as yet another fake deadline . . . a signal that they have another six months. &quot; Fauriol said : &quot; The Administration has made_it quite clear that it is reluctant to intervene . They ' ve watered_down their own announcements ( of possible military_action ) . That doesn ' t work . If you ' re going to play the game of gunboat_diplomacy , just do it. &quot; Part of the problem , officials said , is that Clinton is genuinely undecided on the issue and still hopes he can avoid military intervention . Another part is his Administration ' s seeming inability to make clear decisions and make them stick -- as with its move to send Haitian refugees to Panama , a quick_fix that the Panamanians abruptly rejected Thursday . But another reason is broader : Since the end of the Cold_War , Americans and their leaders are less ready to commit troops to combat overseas . &quot; The whole issue of military intervention is more difficult since the end of the Cold_War . . . and the generals in Haiti know that , &quot; said Michael Mandelbaum of Johns Hopkins University ' s School of Advanced International Studies . &quot; It doesn ' t help that we pulled_out of Somalia . Neither does_it help that half the Congress and half of the country don ' t want to intervene . . . . And it doesn ' t help that our interest in Haiti is not as clear as it could be. &quot; During the Cold_War , Mandelbaum noted , U.S. military interventions -- from Korea in 1950 to Grenada in 1983 -- were all justified on the grounds that they were somehow connected to the global struggle with the Soviet_Union . &quot; The American public has been willing to shed_blood if it had something to do with self-defense , &quot; he said . &quot; But that rationale is gone now. &quot; Indeed , he noted , Clinton has reinforced the nation ' s reluctance through his brushes with intervention . In Somalia last year , after an ill-conceived military_mission resulted in 18 American combat deaths in October , Clinton announced that the cost was greater than the U.S. interest and brought the troops home . In the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Clinton declared that the United States had a deep interest in achieving a settlement -- but not deep enough to warrant sending any ground troops . &quot; In Bosnia , we have set the standard for intervention rather high , &quot; Mandelbaum said . And in Haiti , Clinton ordered U.S. military trainers aboard the tank landing ship Harlan County to withdraw last year in the face of an ugly crowd on the dock . That was the only gunboat_diplomacy Haiti ' s leaders have seen so far , and it ended in a quick American retreat . &quot; That did not strengthen the credibility of our threats of intervention , &quot; Mandelbaum said . &quot; There ' s an argument that can be made now that invading Haiti would be good for U.S. credibility . But how important that credibility is depends_on what the stakes are . . . . And since the Cold_War , the stakes just don ' t seem as big as they used to be. &quot; Times staff writer Kenneth Freed contributed to this report from Miami .</TEXT>
