   <HEADLINE> REPORT SAYS FAA MAY HAVE LAGGED ON 757 WAKE PERIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Federal Aviation Administration may have mishandled reports on turbulence problems associated with Boeing 757s because it doesn ' t have the proper procedures to ensure that safety concerns are acted_upon in a timely fashion , according to a federal report released Tuesday . The 46-page report , a joint effort by the FAA and the Department_of_Transportation , concluded that some officials within the FAA believe the agency could have acted sooner in taking steps designed to prevent accidents caused by wake turbulence from Boeing 757s . Others in the agency , however , do not share that view , the report said . Aside from the conflicting views on whether the agency mishandled the issue of 757 wake turbulence -- a phenomenon that has been linked to two fatal airplane crashes -- the panel assembled by U.S. Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena and FAA Administrator David R . Hinson found a consensus within the FAA that the agency ' s ability to spot potential safety threats and take appropriate action is lacking . &quot; The B-757 wake vortex episode should serve as a wake-up call to the FAA to re-examine its processes for addressing emerging safety issues promptly and effectively , &quot; wrote the two officials who headed the review team , Transportation Department General Counsel Stephen H . Kaplan and Deputy FAA Administrator Linda Hall Daschle . Although the report maintained that the FAA has an &quot; unparalleled &quot; safety record , it sent a clear message -- as well as a list of recommendations -- to Hinson and Pena that the agency could do_better . Daschle said during a discussion of the report that bureaucracy and a lack of leadership and clout have compromised the efficacy of the Office of Aviation Safety , whose job it is to identify , analyze and otherwise call attention to safety-related issues . Pena and Hinson ordered the review in mid-June after a series of reports in The Times indicated that the FAA knew about the potential danger of 757 wake turbulence long before two crashes that claimed 13 lives . Caused by the rapid movement of air across aircraft wings , wake turbulence amounts to a pair of &quot; horizontal tornadoes &quot; emanating from each wingtip . Although aviation experts disagree on the level of danger , some believe that the sleek wing and body design of the fuel-efficient 757 can cause wake turbulence that is more powerful and lasts longer than that created by other aircraft of comparable size . Relying_on FAA internal documents and aviation safety sources , The Times reported June 5 that the FAA ' s top scientist repeatedly expressed concerns about 757 wake turbulence , and in December , 1992 , warned that it could be lethal and might cause a &quot; major crash &quot; if the agency failed to act . On Dec . 18 , 1992 , eleven days after Robert E . Machol ' s prediction , a crash did occur in Billings , Mont. , killing eight people . In December , 1993 , five people died in Santa Ana after a corporate jet encountered the wake from a 757 on approach to John Wayne Airport . Reacting to recommendations made in February by the National Transportation Safety Board , the FAA last month instituted a new set of policies governing smaller planes landing and taking_off behind 757s , including an extra mile of spacing on final approach . The agency also has embarked_on an aggressive program to educate pilots and air traffic controllers about the potential 757 wake turbulence hazard . A congressional subcommittee is scheduled to take_up the specific issue of whether the FAA tarried too long before acting_on 757 wake turbulence concerns , as well as the general topic of whether the people who detect potential safety problems within the FAA communicate effectively with the agency ' s policy-makers and decision-makers . In its report , the FAA and Transportation Department were unwavering in the opinion that nothing the FAA could have done would have prevented the Billings crash . Safety investigators have concluded that the pilot in that accident was operating under visual flight rules , meaning it was up_to him to maintain a safe distance behind the 757 he was tailing . Other aviation safety officials have suggested , however , that had the FAA called attention to the potential 757 turbulence hazard earlier , the Billings pilot might have been more prudent . Because the safety board has not finished its investigation of the Santa Ana crash , the report did not speculate whether the FAA could have affected the outcome of that crash . Like the pilot in the ill-fated Billings accident , the pilot in the Santa Ana crash was operating under visual flight rules . He , too , had inadvertently strayed too close to the 757 and dropped below the flight_path of the 757 , which made his smaller plane more susceptible to the wake turbulence . The panel that compiled Tuesday ' s report recommended that the FAA : * Review the role of the Office of Aviation Safety and create a more effective mechanism to address safety issues . The agency lacks &quot; a single organization , mechanism or entity &quot; that can identify potential safety problems , alert others within the agency and follow_up_on safety recommendations , the report said . * Take a more proactive approach when it comes_to communicating potential safety hazards to pilots , air traffic controllers or others in the industry . * Better define who ' s responsible_for what within the agency . * Improve research and development , including that involving wake turbulence .</TEXT>
