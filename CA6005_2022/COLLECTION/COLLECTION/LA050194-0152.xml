   <HEADLINE> BREAST_CANCER STUDY OFFERS REASSURANCE ; * HIGH INCIDENCE OF DISEASE HERE , MORE DIAGNOSES POINT TO IMPORTANCE OF UCI RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The recent report on breast_cancer by three UC Irvine researchers underlined the importance of scientific_research , despite occasional scandals over falsified results that too easily can cast doubt on the work of scientists . The UC Irvine study of nearly 6 # 000 Orange County women found that lumpectomy , which is the removal of the cancerous tumor , is as effective and safe a treatment of the disease as mastectomy , removal of the entire breast . The watchword in surgery is the less radical the operation , and the less that needs to be removed , the better . The results were especially helpful in reassuring nervous women who had undergone lumpectomies but had become worried by other research that , although confirming the operation was effective , later turned_out to have been tainted . UC Irvine is an appropriate site for the breast_cancer study because , according to researchers , Orange County has the largest instance of the disease in the nation . Hoda Anton-Culver , one of the authors of the study , established the UCI College of Medicine ' s epidemiology program and in 1984 created a landmark program to study all kinds of cancer in the county . The registry records diagnoses and treatments and follows cancer patients until death ; it worked well enough that state officials wisely used it as the model for a statewide reporting program . And the registry proved its worth again when it provided the data for the breast_cancer study . Anton-Culver said the high incidence of breast_cancer in the county may be_due to several factors . For one , the majority population is white , a grouping she said was more susceptible to the disease than Latinos or Asian Americans . Also , affluence has meant diets rich_in fats and low in fiber , a risk factor . In addition , more women here are middle-class or professional , and tend to have children later or no children at all ; that also seems to increase the likelihood of the disease . Anton-Culver also said that it may simply be that the disease is diagnosed more often here because women have access to health_care and the insurance to pay_for it . Earlier this year , the National Cancer Institute gave the UCI researchers $ 2.3 million for a four-year study that will explore the role of genetics in breast_cancer and how it ties_in with environmental factors such_as diet and hormones . Diagnoses of breast_cancer are growing , and the latest estimates are that one in eight American women will suffer the disease . That underlines the importance of research .</TEXT>
