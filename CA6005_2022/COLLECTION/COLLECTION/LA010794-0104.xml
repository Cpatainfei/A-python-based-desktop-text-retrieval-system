   <HEADLINE> VIRGINIA KELLEY , CLINTON ' S MOTHER , DIES AT AGE 70</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Virginia Kelley , a woman of unquenchable optimism and flamboyant spirit who buried three husbands , battled breast_cancer and saw her elder son elected President of the United States , died in her sleep early Thursday in Hot Springs , Ark. , at age 70 . Active until the end , despite a recurrence of her cancer several months ago , Kelley had spent Christmas at the White_House and New Year ' s Eve in Las Vegas , where she watched Barbra Streisand perform . According to friends , she was eagerly anticipating her annual Opening Day visit to the horse_races in Hot Springs later this month . The President flew to Arkansas on Thursday afternoon to coordinate arrangements for the funeral , which will be held Saturday . An aide said Clinton would continue with a scheduled weeklong trip to Europe for a NATO summit and meetings in Moscow with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin . Kelley ' s life contained ample doses of the stuff of tragedy -- poverty , widow ' s veils , cancer , the arrest of her younger son , Roger , on drug charges -- along with the dramatic rises and falls of her elder son ' s political career . Yet in the darkest moments she stubbornly refused to adopt a gloomy mien , insisting to all that the secret to life was to take whatever happened and just keep going . * &quot; I just don ' t let myself dwell_on troubles , &quot; she said in an interview early in her son ' s presidential campaign . Asked , as she repeatedly was , what moment of Bill_Clinton ' s political career had made her proudest , Kelley offered a revealing answer that she continued to give even after he became President : &quot; The night he lost his race for reelection &quot; as Arkansas governor in 1980 , she would say . &quot; He gave a speech thanking everyone , and there was no bitterness . You can never give into bitterness. &quot; That stubborn refusal to accept setbacks as permanent was a trait she passed along to her elder son . That , and a seemingly endless capacity for work . &quot; Driven is the word I ' d use for her , &quot; said David Leopoulos , a friend of Clinton ' s since childhood . &quot; Ever since I ' ve known her , since I was 8 years old , it was nothing but work . She ' s always , just like he is , driven to get something done. &quot; In recent months Kelley had considered , but rejected , taking long-shot and potentially debilitating treatments for her cancer , deciding instead to enjoy what time she had left , sources close to the family said . She had continued to appear outwardly healthy in public as recently as last week -- although she had told friends that she found herself tiring more easily -- and her death caught friends and family by surprise . On Wednesday , Kelley had lunch with friends , called the White_House to talk to her son and , in the evening , watched a University of Arkansas basketball_game on television before going_to_sleep , according to family friends . Her husband , Richard Kelley , a retired food broker , discovered her death later in the night and called the President about 2:30 a.m. EST to inform him , White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said . The Garland County coroner listed the official cause of death as complications from cancer . Clinton stayed_up late into the night , calling Chief_of_Staff Thomas ( Mack ) McLarty and other old friends to inform them and reminisce , the White_House said . At the morning White_House senior staff meeting Thursday , McLarty eulogized her as a &quot; remarkable woman. &quot; * First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton saw her husband off to Arkansas with a hug and kiss as he boarded a helicopter on the White_House ' s South Lawn . She and their daughter , Chelsea , are scheduled to join him today . Roger Clinton flew from Los Angeles on Thursday to join the rest of the family for the funeral . It was the third time in less than 10 months that Clinton has traveled_to Arkansas for memorials , having buried his friend Vince Foster and his wife ' s father , Hugh Rodham , last year . Kelley stood_in sharp contrast to the demure , colorless , television-era characters who dominate modern politics -- with her shock of white hair set_off against a black bun , eyebrows painted into a thin , high arch and a bold horseshoe-shaped diamond ring on her finger to display her passion for betting_on the ponies . During the presidential campaign , reporters calling her for the first time would often be startled by an answering machine message informing callers that &quot; if I ' m not here , I ' m probably down at the race track. &quot; &quot; She was a woman who traveled through life at her own velocity , flying her own colors , &quot; said television producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason , a close Clinton family friend . &quot; She managed to wring every drop of joy she could from her life. &quot; The life was one in which the joy mixed often with pain . Her first son was born four months after his father , William Jefferson Blythe , died in a car accident in 1946 . The couple had barely lived together because Blythe had been drafted into the Army shortly after their marriage in 1943 . * When her child was 2 years old , Kelley left him in the custody of her parents in the small_town of Hope , Ark . -- where her father owned a grocery_store -- while she traveled_to New Orleans to train for a job as a nurse-anesthetist at the city ' s Charity Hospital . &quot; Everybody who loses a husband thinks they ' ll never get_married again , &quot; she said in a 1991 interview . &quot; I thought : ' My goodness , this child will be looking_to me ' &quot; for support . &quot; It was the most difficult thing I ever did , &quot; she said , referring to the separation from her son . &quot; I ' d be working , putting a child under ( anesthesia ) , and tears would be streaming down my cheeks thinking_about my own child. &quot; After completing her training , Kelley returned to Arkansas and shortly thereafter married Roger Clinton , a car_dealer from Hot Springs . Clinton was the father of her second child . He beat Kelley during bouts of drunkenness , with the couple divorcing and remarrying during a union that lasted 17 years until his death from cancer . A third husband , Jeff Dwire , a hairdresser , died of complications from diabetes after only a_few years of marriage . As for her fourth husband , whom she married in 1982 , she once laughingly told a reporter : &quot; I warned him I was probably a jinx. &quot; The two lived_in a cottage next to a small lake outside Hot Springs , along with a large dog that lived_out back in a doghouse covered with old Clinton political placards . Kelley was a constant of Clinton ' s many political_campaigns -- walking precincts to knock_on doors , stuffing envelopes , answering phones . During the presidential campaign , she and her husband led a contingent of Arkansans to New Hampshire to canvass the state for her son , and &quot; at every moment while we were down , she would come_into campaign headquarters and pump everybody up , &quot; said Richard Mintz , a former campaign official who is now a spokesman for the Transportation Department . &quot; When the times were really rough , she would help pump him up too , &quot; he said , referring to Clinton . &quot; She was , perhaps , the world ' s greatest optimist. &quot;</TEXT>
