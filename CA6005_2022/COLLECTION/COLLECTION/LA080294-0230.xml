   <HEADLINE> GERMANY ASKS FOR POLAND ' S FORGIVENESS ; EUROPE : APOLOGY ISSUED ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WARSAW UPRISING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German President Roman Herzog , attending memorial services here marking the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising , issued an extraordinary public apology Monday for the suffering Germany caused Poland in World_War_II . &quot; Today , I bow_down before the fighters of the Warsaw Uprising as before all Polish victims of the war , &quot; Herzog said after laying a wreath draped in the German tricolor at the foot of this city ' s monument to the failed rebellion . &quot; I ask_for forgiveness for what has been done to you by Germans. &quot; Thousands of Polish uprising veterans who had gathered from around the world for the late-night commemoration broke_into applause , continuing the ovation until Herzog returned to his seat . &quot; I came here to hear him say this . Millions of Poles have been waiting for this , &quot; said Irena Kwiatkowska , 60 , who described herself as a &quot; small child living_in hell &quot; during the uprising . &quot; It took 50 years , but he said it. &quot; Herzog ' s remarks were seen as the most important act of German contrition toward Poland since 1970 , when Chancellor Willy Brandt knelt at the site of Warsaw ' s Jewish ghetto , the scene of an earlier uprising suppressed by the Nazis . Even that event , many Poles believe , was more a gesture toward Jews than all Poles . &quot; It fills us Germans with shame that the name of our country and people will forever be associated with pain and suffering , which was inflicted on Poland a_million times , &quot; Herzog said . &quot; We mourn the dead of the Warsaw Uprising and all people who lost their lives in World_War II. &quot; The apology was all_the more significant because it came against a backdrop of intense controversy over the decision to invite German and Russian leaders to the remembrance , which marks one of the bloodiest chapters in Polish history . Residents of Warsaw rose_up against their German occupiers Aug . 1 , 1944 , but the ensuing 63-day rebellion was a military failure . More_than 200 # 000 Poles , most of them civilians , were killed , and about 500 # 000 deported to concentration_camps . Angry Nazi troops dynamited huge sections of the city , leaving it uninhabitable and mostly in ruins when they retreated several months later . While the battle was against the Germans , many Poles hold the Russians largely responsible_for the debacle because Soviet leader Josef Stalin refused to allow his forces , which had advanced to the city ' s outskirts , to assist the poorly armed rebels . Some Polish veterans were so outraged by the presence of Herzog and Sergei A . Filatov , chief_of_staff to Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , at Monday ' s remembrance that they staged alternative ceremonies . The anniversary also served to revive feelings of bitterness toward Germany and Russia among the general public , with a public_opinion_poll released Monday showing that only 30 % of Poles believe the two countries would make_good allies . In his remarks Monday evening , Herzog addressed such skepticism , saying he understands the sentiment but asking both Poles and Germans to seek a new era of reconciliation . Polish President Lech Walesa , who invited Herzog and Yeltsin as an act of healing , said the time had come for Poles to live_in friendship with their former enemies and move toward integration in a greater Europe . &quot; We do not give absolution to the murderers in Warsaw , but we do not pass those feelings upon the German nation , &quot; Walesa said . &quot; Blood and hatred are a curse of the 20th Century ; may they disappear in the past along with it. &quot; Vice_President Al Gore , representing the United States at the commemoration , called the Warsaw insurgents &quot; noble martyrs &quot; who preserved the dignity of the Polish people , but he also said the cycle of hatred in Central Europe should be broken . The coolest reception of the evening was reserved for Filatov , who was sent to represent Yeltsin . Many Poles didn ' t want any Russian presence at the commemoration , but they were offended nonetheless when Yeltsin declined to attend himself . Filatov spoke only briefly , reading a letter from Yeltsin and emphasizing the great losses both Russia and Poland suffered in World_War_II . He said both peoples were victims of Stalinism , and he assured Poles that democratic Russia &quot; will not commit the mistakes we committed in the past. &quot; His remarks were greeted with only polite applause , with one woman in the audience asking aloud , &quot; Where is the ' We are sorry ? ' &quot; Earlier in the day , Poles held a more private ceremony at Pilsudski Square , the site of the tomb of the unknown_soldier and a revered national gathering place near Warsaw ' s oldest quarter . The solemn event , which included a military parade and a Mass , was to have been attended by Herzog and Filatov . But organizers removed the foreign dignitaries from the guest list after veterans groups threatened to protest the gathering . &quot; They should have invited young people , not the old ones who were shooting at us , &quot; said veteran Eugeniusz Rajewski , who traveled from Sweden for the remembrance .</TEXT>
