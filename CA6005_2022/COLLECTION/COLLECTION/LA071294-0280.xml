   <HEADLINE> ETHNIC DISCORD ; HOPE MAY BE TOO LATE COMING TO BUKHARA JEWS ; REVIVAL OF SYNAGOGUE CLOSED UNDER STALIN IS A POSITIVE SIGN BUT NOT ENOUGH TO STOP EXODUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An unmarked doorway in a dusty alley opens into one of this ancient Central Asian city ' s two synagogues . In the open courtyard , a young Israeli teacher instructs a small gathering of adults about Jewish law . Against one wall are piled hundreds of old religious books , awaiting proper storage . &quot; These are the books of our ancestors , &quot; said a student . &quot; When people emigrate , they can ' t take them , so they leave them here. &quot; This synagogue in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan , closed_in 1930 during dictator Josef Stalin ' s anti-religious campaigns , reopened three years ago and is in the final stages of redecoration . It is known as the Young Synagogue ; Bukhara ' s main synagogue stayed open during the Stalin era . For the Bukhara Jews , an ancient community that has inhabited Central Asia for centuries , the restored synagogue is a hopeful sign . But for many , it has come too late . The Bukhara Jews are packing their bags , leaving their ancestral homeland in search of a better life in America and Israel . More_than 20 # 000 have left in the past three years , about half headed for each country . &quot; It ' s like a chain_reaction , &quot; said Rabbi Itskhak Abramov . &quot; People leave because their mother or brother or sister has left . If somebody has a good life over there , they invite their relatives to come. &quot; Since the Soviet_Union broke_up three years ago , Jews have left in huge numbers . But while the pace of emigration from Russia has slowed in recent months , the tide is still rising in Central Asia , riding a frothy crest of nationalism , resurgent Islam , war and poverty . Bukhara Jews are leaving faster than anyone else . &quot; It is quite possible that , within a_few years , there won ' t be any left , &quot; said Leonid Stonov , a human_rights activist in Moscow for the U.S.-based Union of Councils . Central Asia is a vast region of mountains , deserts and oases between European Russia and South Asia . Its caravan cities grew rich_in the Middle_Ages on the Silk_Road trade between Asia and Europe . Jewish traders first came_to the region through Persia . They flourished as merchants and cloth dyers , cobblers and barbers in all_the major cities of Central Asia . Some were cosmopolitan , as shown by a dictionary they published in 1907 in six languages -- Persian , Arabic , Turkish , French , Russian and English . Jews suffered various restrictions imposed by the despotic emirs of Bukhara but did_well in the 19th Century under the Russian Empire . After the 1917 Revolution , the Soviet government closed the borders , ending the trade that was the lifeblood of the Jewish community . Bukhara Jews still live scattered throughout Central Asia , but their three biggest communities are in the ancient cities of Bukhara , Samarkand and Tashkent . Their mother_tongue is a dialect of Persian , unlike the European Jews , who came_to Central Asia after the Russian conquest and usually speak Russian . The Muslim majority in Bukhara and Samarkand consists_of Turkic-speaking Uzbeks and Persian-speaking Tajiks . Only about 3 # 000 to 4 # 000 Jews are left in Bukhara , and most are already making plans to join relatives in Israel or New York . Bukharans have been living_in Jerusalem since the 1890s , and in New York , a small community has grown_up in the Forest Hills section of Queens . * Around the corner from Bukhara ' s main synagogue is the small Jewish cultural center . Jews who are preparing to leave for America gather there in the evenings to study English . &quot; There are many problems here and no future , not just for our children but even for us , &quot; said Alexander Tamayev , 40 , who is bound for Queens this summer . &quot; And everybody ' s relatives are in America. &quot; Rafael Khaimov , 38 , hopes to leave for New York this fall with six other family members , to join three relatives who are already there . The family has been granted refugee status by the U.S._government and will be sponsored by Khaimov ' s brother , who left Bukhara four years ago . The brother went_with his wife , who had been sponsored by her parents , who had gone previously . &quot; I won ' t sponsor anyone , &quot; Khaimov said with a smile . &quot; I ' m the last. &quot; Buying a plane_ticket out isn ' t easy in Uzbekistan , where the average monthly salary amounts to less than $ 10 . Those who go must sell or leave_behind most of their possessions . Customs rules are obscure , and officials often do not allow antiques or valuables to leave the country , or expect to receive a bribe to do so . &quot; People who have lived well and who have a lot of jewelry and antiques cannot take them to another country , so they must sell them here cheap , and they arrive poor , &quot; Tamayev said . &quot; It depends_on the customs officer . If he wants , I can take_five suits . If he doesn ' t want , I can take only one. &quot; Uzbekistan ' s post-Communist property laws are still unclear . Some emigrants are told by local officials they must sell their houses before they leave , or else their unoccupied property will be taken_over by the government . This forces them to sell cheaply and leaves them nowhere to return . &quot; Of course I ' m afraid , &quot; said Zina Khaimov , Rafael ' s wife . &quot; I ' ll lose everything , and there we have nothing . we ' ll have to start all_over again. &quot; Zina Khaimov is a nurse and Rafael a pediatrician , but both will have to undergo years of study before being allowed to practice their professions in the United States . One of the few Jewish community leaders who are staying_put is Mikhail Abramov of Samarkand University , a historian of the Bukhara Jews . He lives_in an old house in Samarkand ' s Jewish quarter that is beautifully decorated in the traditional style , with carved wooden columns and pictures of Jerusalem painted on wall panels under an ornate ceiling . His family came_to Samarkand in 1846 via Kabul , Afghanistan , after fleeing Iran during a period when Jews were being forced to convert to Islam . Mikhail Abramov says he would leave for Israel if he could take his library of 6 # 000 volumes . &quot; But I would n ' t be allowed to take more_than a_few , so I have to stay , &quot; he said . Just how many Bukhara Jews remain in Central Asia is unclear , but estimates range between 6 # 000 and 13 # 000 . Most of the Jewish community has already left Uzbekistan ' s poor mountainous neighbor , Tajikistan , since a bloody civil_war began in 1992 . Other ethnic_groups , including ethnic Russians , are also leaving , prompted by rising nationalism , an economic_crisis , inflation , shortages of everything and the belief that opportunity and tolerance for minorities will be limited in the independent Central Asian_nations . * Will the Bukhara Jews eventually disappear entirely from their ancestral homeland ? &quot; In Israel , they say that , in five years , there will be no more Jews in Bukhara , &quot; said Zelman Dabakarov , 26 , the young Israeli teaching religion in the refurbished Young Synagogue in Bukhara . But some see new opportunities in the post-Soviet period . Itskhak Abramov was a carpenter until the Young Synagogue reopened in 1991 and he became its rabbi . &quot; It ' s impossible to predict whether all_the Jews will leave , &quot; he said . &quot; Only God knows . We want to live here . that ' s why we ' re rebuilding this synagogue. &quot; * Steven Gutterman , a researcher in the Times Moscow Bureau , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
