   <HEADLINE> GEORGE RAMOS : A DEATH FELT NORTH OF THE BORDER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Among Southern California ' s 3.8 million residents of Mexican descent , the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio could not have hit harder than when Leticia Quezada heard about it . Quezada , the Los Angeles school_board president who was born in Mexico , thought it was a cruel joke when her husband told her . She is among local leaders who have sought stronger ties between Mexican Americans and the next Mexican president and wanted to cultivate the 44-year-old Colosio , who was the candidate of Mexico ' s ruling party . When she realized the terrible news was true , Quezada , 38 , now a naturalized U.S. citizen , was in a deep state of frustration . She couldn ' t work_up enthusiasm for a teachers meeting the morning after Colosio died . &quot; I ' m so overwhelmed by it , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m paralyzed . I ' m depressed . It hits really close to home. &quot; * Colosio ' s murder is the last thing Mexico needs right now , given the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas and the clamor for political reform . The assassination is a another signal that Mexico faces a very uncertain future . In the minds of many Mexicans , there are powerful parallels between Colosio and the two slain Kennedy brothers , John and Robert . Colosio ' s murder will have as great an impact on Mexican history as the slayings of President Kennedy and his brother , the U.S. senator from New York , had_on American history . There ' s been no event like it in modern Mexican history . The same Kennedyesque questions come_to_mind once again : Did the gunman in Tijuana act alone ? Was there a conspiracy to kill Colosio ? The chaotic scenes from Tijuana of Colosio ' s supporters and aides grappling with the suspected assassin reminded me of 1968 when Sirhan Sirhan was wrestled to the ground after mortally wounding Robert Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel . On Wednesday , I was in The Times ' newsroom working_on a column about the closing of Los Angeles ' oldest bookstore , the 105-year-old Fowler Brothers , when the first news_bulletin came_in . I knew instantly I ' d be writing_about something different . The angry reaction over Colosio ' s death among local Chicanos and Mexicanos , which even extended_to how L.A. broadcasters butchered the pronunciation of Colosio ' s name , is easy to understand . For many Mexicans , Colosio was one of the people . He wasn ' t a man of privilege as are many who run the PRI , as the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is called . He was a norteno , a northerner , from the town of Magdalena de Kino , just 50 miles south of the Arizona border . He came from poor ranching origins where family values stress self-reliance . Many of Mexican descent who have come_to the U.S. can relate to Colosio ' s modest background . They understand the hard work that is required to get an education . He couldn ' t afford much and had to fight for scholarships to attend college . Although he ultimately earned a doctorate , he retained an affection for the average man and woman . He , in turn , became so popular that Quezada didn ' t have the heart to call her mother in Mexico to talk_about the slaying -- it would have been too painful for the older_woman to discuss . In his campaign , Colosio sought to transfer that personal popularity into votes for the PRI , the dominant but often corrupt political_machine that has governed Mexico since its beginnings in 1929 . The average Mexicans who grew tired_of PRI ' s rule -- and yet have come_to accept its rule and feared instability after the Indian uprising in Chiapas -- were heartened to know that Colosio would offer hope as Mexico ' s new chief_executive . His death is especially disheartening for L.A. ' s Chicano political Establishment because it sought to strengthen its ties with Mexico ' s top leaders . Colosio , perhaps more_than any other politician in modern Mexico , sought to understand the Mexican American experience in the United States . He had studied at the University of Pennsylvania and saw firsthand how many of his compatriots live_in this country . Some Chicano activists and business_leaders in Los Angeles say that they had met as_many as five times in recent months with Colosio . They found him to be a man interested in their ideas . &quot; We were blunt in wanting a more serious and substantive relationship with the Mexican government , &quot; says Boyle Heights activist Juan Jose Gutierrez . &quot; We were frank with him . . . and he listened. &quot; * The news of Colosio ' s death hit particularly hard in Los Angeles because , ironically , some Chicanos last week were awaiting word of yet another meeting with Colosio . It was proposed that they get_together with the candidate during a campaign stop in Tijuana . Instead came word that he was shot and killed there .</TEXT>
