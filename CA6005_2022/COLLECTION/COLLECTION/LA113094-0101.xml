   <HEADLINE> ' 3 STRIKES ' -SPAWNED CRUSH OF CASES CROWDS_OUT CIVIL SUITS ; LAW : COURTROOM CRUNCH DELAYS NON-CRIMINAL TRIALS . WEALTHIER LITIGANTS MAY TURN TO PRIVATE JUDGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The case of Lucy Musharbash vs . the California Department_of_Transportation has nothing to do with violent crime , tougher punishment or any of the other hot-button issues that led to passage of the &quot; three strikes &quot; law . But the personal injury lawsuit has been swept into the judicial_system maelstrom created by the legislation . After several delays , it looked_like the 4-year-old case -- stemming from the accidental death of Musharbash ' s husband on the San Bernardino Freeway -- would finally come_to trial this month . But then the lawyers were told that there was no courtroom available in Pomona . &quot; The judge told us they were jammed up with criminal cases because of ' three strikes , ' &quot; said Claremont personal injury lawyer Michael Bidart , who represents the widow . Frustrated , Bidart and the defense_lawyer decided to drop_out of the system and take the case to a private judge . The Musharbash case is one of an increasing number of civil lawsuits that are having a tough time getting_to trial these days . That is because more courtrooms that were usually reserved for civil suits must be pressed into service for criminal trials as a result of the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , according to judges , attorneys and court officials . Judges said the situation will worsen in coming months , in part because criminal trials have grown longer now that more is at stake under the law . Moreover , many_more defendants are unwilling to plea bargain because of the prospect of longer prison_terms . As a sign of this trend , Cecil J . Mills , supervising judge of the Los Angeles County Criminal_Courts , noted that felony filings are down 3 % to 4 % countywide this year , but that cases awaiting trial are up 26 % . As of mid-November , Mills said , there were 7 # 000 felony cases awaiting trial , compared to 5 # 900 a year ago . Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti has projected that as a result of the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , there will be 5 # 875 felony jury trials in Los Angeles in 1995 , a dramatic increase from 2 # 410 in 1994 . Many of those cases will have to be heard by judges usually assigned to civil proceedings , according to Robert M . Mallano , presiding judge of the Los Angeles County Superior_Court . He said the ranks of judges now hearing civil cases will be cut_in half , from 120 to 60 , by mid-December and added that those judges still scheduled to hear civil cases are likely to be frequently pressed into service to hear criminal trials . &quot; I ' m really concerned , &quot; Mallano said . &quot; The California Constitution says that you have a right to a jury trial in a civil case . If we can ' t try civil cases , it makes the Constitution like a scrap of paper. &quot; Orange County Superior_Court officials are also feeling the crunch . In April , there were 400 cases set for trial . Now there are about 675 criminal cases awaiting trial in Orange County . &quot; that ' s a big , big increase for us , &quot; said Presiding Orange County Superior_Court Judge James L . Smith . Smith said he fears that the crush of criminal cases will sidetrack the court ' s efforts to better manage its civil caseload . Civil cases used to drag_out for years in Orange County . But under the new system , civil cases now typically go_to trial about 18 months after the case is filed . &quot; We don ' t want to lose that progress , &quot; Smith said . To handle the onslaught , Smith said , three retired judges normally assigned to civil matters are now handling criminal cases . Smith said criminal cases take priority but acknowledged the public ' s reliance on the civil court system to resolve disputes . &quot; We feel that justice delayed is justice denied , &quot; he said . Smith said he believes that &quot; three strikes &quot; is behind the crunch but added that the court system has long been struggling to cope_with an ever-growing caseload without an accompanying increase in resources . He noted that there has not been a new judicial seat funded in Orange County since 1987 . &quot; It ' s just a tough time for the courts , &quot; Smith said . &quot; Funding goes_down , the judicial positions don ' t increase and the cases keep coming. &quot; Legal experts said an increasing number of civil litigants , like the parties in the Musharbash case , will be forced to use the services of private judges -- if they can afford the costs of $ 150 or more an hour -- to obtain prompt resolutions of their cases . Among those concerned about the trend is Gregory C . O ' Brien , the supervising Superior_Court judge in Pomona . Before passage of the &quot; three strikes &quot; law in March , half of the 15 courtrooms in Pomona were used for civil cases , he said . But in the past six weeks , he added , he has only been able to start three civil cases because of the criminal case overflow . The first wave of delays came_in spring after the law was enacted , O ' Brien said . &quot; Then we settled into a period of relative calm until about late summer , at which point the criminal cases began to overtake everything , &quot; the judge said . On any given day in Pomona , a dozen civil cases are awaiting an available courtroom , he said . &quot; I don ' t see any light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; O ' Brien said . The reason is simple : Thousands of cases are being filed under the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , many involving defendants who probably would have resolved their cases by plea bargains but are now refusing to enter into such deals for fear of incurring a &quot; strike &quot; and a longer sentence . From March 14 through Friday , the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office filed 6 # 468 first-strike cases , 3 # 645 second-strike cases and 1 # 416 third-strike cases , according to figures provided by spokeswoman Suzanne Childs . The &quot; three strikes &quot; law mandates a prison sentence of 25 years to life for defendants convicted of any third felony strike if their first two felony convictions were for serious or violent crimes . The statute also provides_for prison_terms that are essentially double what they would have been for second-strike cases . Two-strike cases are particularly difficult to resolve by plea because of what could happen later , Mills said . &quot; People understand any felony can constitute the third strike. &quot; Criminal defendants are entitled to a trial within 60 days of arraignment and , unless a defendant waives that constitutional right , the case takes precedence over any civil lawsuit -- meaning that a civil trial can be delayed or interrupted . Sometimes a mistrial must be declared . Mallano stressed that he was not taking a position on the &quot; three strikes &quot; law . However , he said the Legislature failed to take into consideration all_the potential consequences when it enacted the statute -- including warnings from judges that the court system would find it difficult to handle all_the additional criminal trials . &quot; This is what everyone in the system was predicting -- a steady growth of cases awaiting trial and no place to send them , &quot; said Judge Florence-Marie Cooper , who noted that in recent months she has had to interrupt a civil fraud trial and delay wrongful termination and personal injury cases to make_way for criminal trials . &quot; We ' re all just trying to keep our heads above water . . . . I ' m not optimistic , &quot; she said . As recently as Tuesday , Cooper delivered some bad news to a bevy of attorneys involved in a complex civil case precipitated by a real_estate development that went awry . She told them she probably will not be able to handle their case in the near future because of the press of &quot; three strikes &quot; cases . She said the dispute is likely to go_to a private judge , forcing the parties to pay about &quot; $ 300 an hour. &quot; In August , a colleague of Cooper ' s , Judge Stephen M . Lachs , had to declare a mistrial in a personal injury auto accident case on the fourth day of a jury trial as two doctors were waiting to testify . Lachs said the criminal_courts coordinator came_to him with a pressing criminal case . When only eight of the jurors said they could come_back to serve on the case after the interruption , &quot; I was forced to mistry the case , &quot; the judge said . The matter is now scheduled for retrial next month . &quot; It is one of the most disturbing things that can happen in a courtroom for judges , jurors , attorneys , witnesses , litigants , &quot; Lachs said . &quot; Everybody is very upset when anything like that happens . Everybody realizes that we ' ve wasted a tremendous amount_of_time , taxpayers ' money , money put into the case by the attorneys and their clients. &quot; Brent M . Berman , the attorney for one of the plaintiffs , said civil lawyers know that criminal cases have priority . &quot; But it was frustrating after 3 1 / 2 days to have a mistrial declared and to have to do the whole_thing all_over again. &quot; The impact of the new law is being felt throughout the county . On a recent day in Long_Beach , only one civil trial -- a 5-year-old police brutality case -- was being conducted , according to Arthur Jean , who will become the supervising Superior_Court judge Jan 1 . &quot; It ' s a daily battle to keep that case going . The primary reason is because of the ' three strikes ' cases . They ' re going to trial . It ' s an awful picture , &quot; he said . Superior_Court Judge Richard Charvat , who is presiding over the brutality case , said he had to interrupt it once to handle a guilty plea in a felony drunk driving case . &quot; This will be my last civil trial for the foreseeable future , &quot; he said . The situation is not as bad in Santa Monica , said Supervising Judge David M . Rothman , but he too is worried . &quot; I would say 50 % more judges are involved in criminal cases than six months ago . . . . There essentially is a doubling of the criminal cases going_to trial , &quot; even though the number of cases filed has remained steady , the judge said . He suggested that the Legislature had implicitly made a decision &quot; to get_rid_of civil litigation , &quot; noting that it has not provided funding for additional judges since 1987 . In fact , the budget of the Los Angeles County courts is $ 20 million less this year than last . Rothman and others noted that there have been prior blips in caseloads as the result of new laws . However , he believes this situation is different . &quot; The trouble with this kind of demand on the justice system is that it ' s an overwhelming demand , &quot; he said . A drug case tried this month provides a graphic illustration of how once-routine proceedings can take far longer now . In this instance , the district_attorney ' s office pressed a &quot; three strikes &quot; case against a man arrested in Long_Beach for possessing 0.88 grams of heroin -- &quot; a ball about the size of a BB , &quot; said Special Assistant Dist . Atty . Paul W . Turley . The man had four prior felony convictions -- two of them serious -- and was_on parole . The trial was assigned to Judge David A . Workman , who normally hears civil cases in Downtown Los Angeles , because there was no courtroom available in Long_Beach . Despite the fact that it was a very simple case that normally would have taken a day , the trial lasted four days because the man was facing 25 years to life , Turley said . The prosecutor said jury selection took longer because the defendant had more peremptory challenges because of the possible life sentence ; because more witnesses had to be called ; because a chemist was called to testify about the composition of the drugs ; and because a forensics expert had to be used to take the defendant ' s fingerprints as part of the process of verifying that he was the person convicted of the prior offenses . Normally , Turley said , the defendant would have stipulated to the nature of the drugs and the prior convictions -- but not in a &quot; three strikes &quot; case , in which the defense_lawyer &quot; appropriately objected on everything related to the priors. &quot; The defendant was convicted and sentencing is pending . Several plaintiff ' s attorneys , including Bidart , expressed concern that delays aid defendants , who do not have to pay_out money as long as the status_quo is maintained . These attorneys also said the delays can have broader ramifications because of the growing difficulty of bringing_to trial cases involving dangerous products or hazardous conditions that affect the public . James L . Crandall , an Irvine attorney whose clients include a large insurance_company , disagreed on both fronts . &quot; If there is a delay , it hurts both sides equally , &quot; he said . &quot; Insurance_companies have to pay lawyers for two years rather than one year. &quot; Still , Crandall said he favored the law . &quot; Even though I ' m a civil trial_attorney , I recognize that our trials over money are not as important as public safety . I ' m not complaining about the ' three strikes ' law at all . We probably have a safer society as a result of it. &quot; Superior_Court Judge Alexander Williams III , who has had to delay several civil trials to hear pressing criminal cases , agreed . &quot; We do not resent having to address our resources to protecting the public instead of keeping our doors open for fee-generating nonsense from civil lawyers , &quot; said the former federal prosecutor , who has been a judge for 10 years . Indeed , the fallout from &quot; three strikes &quot; comes amid increased debate over whether American society is too litigious and the prospect that Republican legislators will move to curb punitive damage awards . Dan Evans , an aide to Assemblyman Bill Jones ( R-Fresno ) , the primary proponent of the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , said he was not surprised to hear about the effect on civil cases . &quot; If you accept the statistics -- and I do -- that a relatively small number of criminals are committing the vast majority of crimes , and judges say we see the same people again and again in our courts . . . it ' s not too_much of a leap to see that for a while there will be an increase in criminal trials , &quot; Evans said . &quot; But after a while , that will drop_off as these people . . . will be staying in prison longer . . . and they won ' t be coming_back to clog the courts. &quot; That remains to be seen , some legal_experts say . Meanwhile , the increase in criminal cases going_to trial as a result of &quot; three strikes &quot; has complicated the jobs of John Iversen , the Los Angeles County criminal_courts coordinator , and John Austin , the civil courts coordinator , who have to shepherd cases through the system . &quot; We haven ' t gotten_to critical mass yet in the central courthouse , &quot; Austin said , &quot; but I fear it ' s coming. &quot; Times staff writer Rene Lynch contributed to this report .
