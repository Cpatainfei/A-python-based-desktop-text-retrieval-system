   <HEADLINE> CLINTON BACKS LATVIA ON EXIT OF RUSSIAN TROOPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton pledged Wednesday to push Russia to remove the last of its troops from the Baltics &quot; in a deliberate and firm way , &quot; while also warning that the rights of the Russian minority in this region must be protected . Opening an eight-day European trip with the first visit of an American President to this portion of the former Soviet empire , Clinton met with the presidents of Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia . He declared to a surging , flag-waving crowd gathered at the city ' s historic Freedom Monument that &quot; the chain that binds our nations is unbreakable. &quot; Clinton , who is headed for a three-day summit of officials from the leading industrial nations in Naples , Italy , later went_to Warsaw to meet with Polish President Lech Walesa . In Warsaw , Clinton pledged to increase international help for Poland ' s poor and jobless . He found Walesa , who has been a sharp critic of American_plans to delay Polish entry into the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , in a more conciliatory mood than he had been during Clinton ' s last European visit in January . But as he talked_of the American commitment to Baltic independence , Clinton also pointedly urged Estonians , Latvians and Lithuanians to observe the rights of the Russian minority whose treatment remains the key sticking point in the Baltics ' disentanglement from their former Russian masters . &quot; Today , I appeal_to you to summon what my nation ' s greatest healer , Abraham_Lincoln , called the ' better angels of our nature ' -- to never deny to others the justice and equality you fought so hard for and earned for yourselves , &quot; Clinton said . His Baltic stop represented an acknowledgment of the new political maturity and rising economic prospects of the three nations , which won their independence just three years ago . The trip also was designed to underscore the President ' s work to re-integrate post-Cold War Europe -- a project that has become one of his more praised initiatives . But Clinton was compelled to carefully balance his praise for what the Baltic_states have accomplished with his urging that they observe the rights of their large Russian minorities . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin has sought pledges of fair treatment for the Russian minority in return for final withdrawal of about 4 # 500 troops from Latvia and 2 # 500 from Estonia . The last troops in Latvia are scheduled to depart by Aug . 31 . But negotiations continue on departure of Russian troops from Estonia . The delicacy of the subject was apparent even from the crowd reaction to Clinton ' s speech . Madly waving hundreds of tiny American and Latvian flags , the audience at Riga ' s Freedom Monument roared as Clinton pledged : &quot; We will rejoice with you when the last of the foreign troops vanish from your homelands. &quot; But there was little reaction when Clinton went_on to his accompanying point that &quot; freedom without tolerance is freedom unfulfilled. &quot; The President raised the issue of final troop withdrawal in a telephone_call Tuesday to Yeltsin , and he pledged Wednesday that he would carry a message from Estonian President Lennart Meri to Yeltsin . But later Wednesday , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , who was traveling with Clinton , said that , while the parties were &quot; quite close &quot; in negotiations , &quot; there are still significant gaps. &quot; As part of the visit , American officials announced they will put_up $ 10 million in next year ' s budget_for Central European peacekeeping efforts , including the Baltic peacekeeping battalion , which is being assembled in the region . The United States has agreed to increase from $ 2 million to $ 4 million the amount it will spend to help dismantle a Soviet radar station in Latvia , which has been another obstacle to Riga ' s good relations with Moscow . Baltic residents , who have long sought American support , were clearly dazzled by Clinton ' s visit . On a stunning summer day , Latvians lined_up along the motorcade route well in_advance to watch Clinton ' s arrival . At the city ' s largest department_store , Centrs , shoppers and clerks gathered around a display of Western European televisions and beamed as they watched Clinton being greeted by President Guntis Ulmanis . Many elderly Latvians appeared at the Freedom Monument ceremony . Latvians were honored to have &quot; such a big man visit such a tiny country , &quot; said Vita Liberte , a first-year law_student at the University of Latvia . The crowd was clearly delighted as Clinton at one point cried_out , &quot; Briviba ! Vabadus ! Laisve ! &quot; -- the word Freedom ! in the three Baltic_languages . Later Wednesday , Clinton met with Walesa over the negotiating table and at dinner for sessions that lasted into the night . Although American officials had braced for more complaints from Walesa , they found his rhetoric toned_down . Asked of his concern about any Russian threat to Poland ' s security , Walesa said : &quot; I would say that , today , my apprehensions amount to 40 % and my hopes to 60 % . &quot; Clinton ' s visit comes at a time when the strains of economic reform have increased cries_for the old ways in Poland and helped put leftist parties , including former Communists , in the Parliament . U.S. officials say they went_to Warsaw intending to deal with the new power_structure and to find ways for the United States to alleviate Poland ' s ills . Among other initiatives , U.S. officials propose a &quot; transplantation of know-how &quot; to help speed economic reform -- without large , new aid expenditures . U.S. officials plan to teach ways to train the jobless , for example , and help set_up a system of mortgage-backed housing . Special correspondent Matt Bivens in Riga contributed to this report .
