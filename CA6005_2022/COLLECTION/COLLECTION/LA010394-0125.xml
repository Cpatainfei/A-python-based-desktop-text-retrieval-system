   <HEADLINE> VIOLENCE , ULTIMATUMS IMPERIL PEACE IN ULSTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A peace initiative for Northern_Ireland received a severe setback Sunday after increased violence in the province was followed by unyielding statements by Irish republicans and British Prime_Minister John Major . In London , Major gave the_Irish Republican Army a &quot; take it or leave it &quot; ultimatum , referring to the peace proposal that he and Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds signed Dec . 15 . Major warned the IRA and its political arm , Sinn Fein , that they will face international isolation if they reject the proposal to end 25 years of violence in Ulster , as Northern_Ireland is also known . &quot; We are not entering into negotiations , &quot; Major said Sunday , a day after an IRA bomb blitz of stores in the Belfast region caused millions of dollars in damage . &quot; The joint declaration lies on the table. &quot; In an interview in a Dublin newspaper Sunday , top Sinn Fein official Martin McGuinness condemned the British-Irish peace plan because it fails to commit Britain to a troop withdrawal and gives the Protestant Unionists in Ulster final say on the province ' s future . &quot; I ' m afraid the prospects of the declaration , as far as republicans are concerned , to say the least are worthless , &quot; McGuinness said . He said it will take as long as three weeks before Sinn Fein officially responds to the plan . Under the peace proposal , the London and Dublin governments will not officially meet with Sinn Fein or the IRA until three months after their acts of violence in Ulster ceased . McGuinness ' remarks , together with the firebombings and the killing of a British soldier in the province over the weekend , marked a hardening of the republican position . In Belfast , republican sources said that IRA guerrillas decided to step_up attacks on military and civilian targets to build public support for the withdrawal of the 20 # 000 British troops in Ulster . In his statement , McGuinness said : &quot; Our position remains what it has been in the past : The British should be out of here in the lifetime of a Parliament -- within five years. &quot; But Major reaffirmed his &quot; rock-solid &quot; support for the Protestant Unionists ' right to decide whether to remain part of the United Kingdom or unite with the_Irish Republic . And David Trimble , a leading Ulster Unionist member_of_Parliament , said that McGuinness ' remarks confirm that the IRA does not want peace . He added that the_British government should not be &quot; strung along &quot; while the IRA takes its time deciding when to release a formal response to the British-Irish proposals . &quot; They have got their answer , &quot; Trimble said .</TEXT>
