   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ' S TASK : GET EUROPE ' S YOUTH IN AMERICA ' S CORNER ; ALLIANCES : ALARM OVER BALKANS AIDS HIM IN WOOING YOUNG PEOPLE TO KEEP OLD TIES WITH U.S. BEING LIKED HELPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beneath the carved panels and ornate Gothic parapets of Brussels ' Hotel de Ville , Bill_Clinton on Sunday faced the first test of his first presidential trip to Europe : Could he persuade members of the Continent ' s next generation to embrace the deep-rooted bonds with America on which their parents had so_long relied ? An audience of accomplished young Europeans gathered_in the daunting solemnity of the 15th-Century town_hall studied him closely and clapped politely when Clinton told them that it was time &quot; for us together to revitalize our partnership. &quot; But shortly afterward he got the warmer reaction he had been seeking when he ventured outside into the chilled , charged atmosphere of the historic Grand ' Place . Jammed amid the worn facades of guild buildings from a prosperous era four centuries ago , the Belgians cheered . &quot; Bill ! Bill ! &quot; they cried , waving tiny American flags to capture the eye of the flush-faced American President . From the looks of them , it was clear that Clinton has a chance to win the support he is seeking . He has it because of the alarming new_world the youth of Europe are seeing in the former Yugoslav federation and further east , and because of the surprisingly good impressions they have formed of the youngest American President in three decades . American leaders , and the young people ' s own parents , have long worried about the youth of postwar Europe . Would they take seriously the dangers of war that led their parents to build a long-term bond with the powerful nation across the Atlantic ? Western governments have conducted studies and sifted polls , and seemed to reach a worrisome conclusion : This &quot; new generation &quot; is not as concerned about future security threats as those who had seen the terrible devastation wrought by two world_wars . The leaders of their parents ' generations , still in power in many European governments , knew those horrors firsthand . It colored their view of_their_own military needs , and of America ' s value to them . German Chancellor Helmut Kohl talks_of receiving a coat in an American Care package ; French President Francois Mitterrand escaped_from a German prisoner-of-war camp . The postwar generation has seen a different America . Not many of those who braved the chill of a January night in Brussels would be able to identify Gen . George Marshall , the American whose multibillion-dollar plan of relief and reconstruction helped rebuild their continent . But they know the America of Michael Jordan , of Nike shoes , of the American films whose ads are plastered on billboards throughout their capital city . This has been a culture that they drink_in , but do not always admire . To young Europeans , America is also the country of crime , drugs and homelessness -- of urban contagions they fear are spreading to their own nations . For many , their first impressions of the country came during the years of the Vietnam_War . Many in Europe considered the United States an imperialist power , a muscle-bound nuclear bully that showed the same moral blindness of the Soviets it opposed . Curiously , with the end of the Cold_War that many young Europeans believed brought_out America ' s worst side , a new perception of America has thrived . With the disintegration of the Yugoslav federation , many have seen their own continent engulfed by a Vietnam of its own , an all-consuming war that mocks them from television every night . As they watch the collapse of buildings and the burial of civilians , they lament a war their governments seem powerless to stop . Yes , Europeans have faulted the Clinton_Administration for its failed efforts to stop the three-way slaughter . But their anger and frustration at the Americans over Bosnia-Herzegovina have been directed more at Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher than at Clinton , and in any case are exceeded by their unhappiness with their own leadership . Beyond this , the Continent ' s new generation has shown a special personal affinity for the new President , so far at least . Clinton ' s attempts to identify himself with John F . Kennedy may seem contrived to some Americans , but polls show Europeans like the vitality of the 47-year-old Arkansan that reminds them of the Democrat who was their favorite postwar President . Still , during his first European outing as President , Clinton did not , perhaps , work as hard as he might have at exuding charm . After his speech inside the town_hall , he made his way to a podium outside to meet a crowd that had been gathering for hours . But he cut_short his comments , smiling genially as he told the group : &quot; You ' ve heard my speech , I have really nothing else to say. &quot; And the young Europeans in the Grand ' Place were not overawed by Clinton ' s lieutenants . The crowd tittered , then burst_out laughing , when the oversized TV screen erected in the square to show Clinton ' s speech panned on his overworked secretary_of_state , his eyes pressed closed , apparently dozing . &quot; Il dort ( He ' s asleep ) , &quot; a long-haired Belgian youth snickered . But the reviews of Clinton ' s speech struck a different tone . German television , for one , was soon lavishing praise on Clinton for his expressions of concern about the U.S.-European relationship . The same reaction was apparent even as Clinton glided to his waiting limousine . &quot; He ' s very nice looking , &quot; said Natasha Cleti , 24 , who works in an art_gallery just off the Grand ' Place . &quot; He ' s very positive and very friendly. &quot; &quot; Bill ! &quot; cried a young_woman in a tricolored jersey apparently made from an American flag . &quot; Come hold our hands ! &quot;</TEXT>
