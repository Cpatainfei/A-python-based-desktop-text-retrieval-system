   <HEADLINE> TELEVISION ; WHO ' S MINDING THE MIND ? ; WITH ' THE HUMAN QUEST : SCIENCE AND THE NEW ENLIGHTENMENT , ' KCET ' S ROGER BINGHAM IS GOING AFTER THE BEST ANSWERS WE HAVE SO FAR ABOUT LIFE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The white Buddha figure sits atop the black television_set , and , for a moment , the_Buddha and TV appear to be silly living_room partners . In most households , that is what they would always be -- a little domestic joke . But in Roger Bingham ' s household , they take_on a new meaning . Under this roof , the pair look_like a union of old and new ways of enlightenment . Bingham ' s house , nestled in the_hills here south of downtown , has a habit of making the mind work overtime . that ' s appropriate , considering that the subject now occupying Bingham -- one of television ' s most successful science journalists -- is the mind itself . And if &quot; The Human Quest : Science and the New Enlightenment , &quot; his four-part series now in post-production at public station KCET in Los Angeles , comes_close to its ambitions , it might set_off ideas that make Buddha and the TV_set look puny . &quot; We want to make_sure that this series moves_in such a way that it mimics the way the brain works , &quot; Bingham says . &quot; I want the viewer to have a bubbling , bouncing brain while watching this. &quot; The series , to air on PBS nationally sometime between this fall and the following spring , has endured the inevitable gantlet of revisions , rewrites and reconsiderations . Bingham , though , proudly displays his original proposal , written in 1988 , its core themes remaining basically intact . One of its key statements is a clue to Bingham ' s twin passions , and why he rejects the characterization of television as a vast wasteland : &quot; TV can be a user-friendly electronic interface between the lab and the living room. &quot; But there is something else driving Bingham , a clear mission he speaks_of in terms that television doesn ' t usually accommodate : &quot; It seems to me that if we ' re going to have any hope of transcending the position where our species finds itself now , and to move_in a way where our civic evolution catches_up_with our technological evolution , we must follow the old Delphic oracle imperative : ' Know thyself. ' And now we ' re beginning to have the technology for doing that . If we have any chance of having some control over our destiny , it ' s essential to find_out why we act the way we do , and what the balance is between our evolutionary heritage and the cultural overlay we deal with every day. &quot; As anyone knows who has watched his many science programs , all produced by KCET , Science the Bingham Way has its own overlay -- and it ' s often very funny . From his brief early ' 80s science pieces for KCET ' s &quot; California Journal &quot; to his half-hour and hourlong specials , including &quot; The Time of Our Lives &quot; and &quot; Inside Information , &quot; Bingham has stirred punning and visual frolics into hard science to yield a heady television mixture . &quot; Fat City , &quot; his show on food and the environment , featured the indelible image of Bingham communing with a dairy_cow in a way Woody Allen would have admired . In another program , he sat at a table at Le Dome restaurant and considered ordering &quot; a double serotonin on the rocks &quot; -- the substance in the brain that inhibits neurons that stimulate the brain . Stephen Kulczycki , KCET ' s senior_vice_president and station manager , likes to sum_up Bingham ' s amusing approach as &quot; a blending of Jonathan Miller , James Burke and George Carlin . He ' s definitely playful , and he ' s going_to mess_around with your head. &quot; In fact , one of Bingham ' s early proposals to KCET was for a show that would be titled &quot; A Fun Guide to the Brain. &quot; The very first TV_program Bingham worked_on -- &quot; Why in the World ? , &quot; with host Joseph Benti -- had the subtitle &quot; Why in the World Is Science Like a Soap_Opera ? &quot; Bingham knows he has a way with wit , but at_the_same_time , he cringes at the praise he is given for it : &quot; I wish people didn ' t have to think that you have to make science fun , because science is enormous fun in itself . I wish everyone would buy and read all_of the books on science I read and thus learn about it themselves . But that ' s not going_to happen , so maybe one way of hooking people is if I can show them on TV that there ' s this extraordinary intellectual adventure going_on , and that you don ' t have to be worried about it. &quot; With &quot; The Human Quest , &quot; Bingham is_on to what he likes to call the Big Questions , and they have little to do with the soaps . If there ' s a guiding historical figure behind the series , he can be spotted in another room in the house that Bingham shares with his wife and creative partner , Linda . Lying on a table there is a collection of postcards of the father of the theory_of_evolution , Charles_Darwin , and of his home_in Britain . That place was one of the early destinations on the ambitious international shooting schedule for the $ 2-million series . Filming began last summer at Monticello , Thomas_Jefferson ' s Virginia home , and finished this month . In between , Bingham and crew traveled_to the Indonesian temple of Borobudur ; locales in Bali , England and France , and key hubs of scientific_research such_as the Salk Institute in La Jolla , Stanford_University ' s School_of_Medicine and the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico , home of science ' s newest discipline , called complexity . Supporting the show ' s considerable brain matter is what Bingham and his creative staff promise will be visual magic . In order to suggest , for instance , the theory that there may be a single controlling substance in the brain that makes consciousness possible , a view of a street in Ojai will be filmed as Bingham would see it on a walk . Then we will see Bingham sitting in the Ojai Playhouse movie_theater , watching that scene on the big screen . &quot; In essence , &quot; he says , &quot; I play the role of homunculus , the little man in the brain. &quot; The &quot; Quest &quot; quartet begins with a segment tentatively titled &quot; The Nature of Human Nature , &quot; which reports on recent studies of how the mind and brain developed and evolved over time . &quot; Darwin , &quot; Bingham says , &quot; proposed that our physical being is the result of evolution through natural_selection . Unlike others -- including Alfred Russel Wallace , who co-discovered the natural_selection theory -- Darwin included the brain in that process . And since the mind is part of the brain , mind and brain together was a package deal for Darwin. &quot; Among the other puzzles in mind-brain research is the question of why , if nothing in evolution happens before it is needed , our mind was capable of math skills at a time when the species was living_in caves and forests . ( UC San Diego philosophy scholar and author Patricia Churchland offers a possible answer : The brain was working hard in the bush and doing countless calculations to survive ; now that part of the brain labors in the classroom and laboratories. ) The second segment , &quot; Consciousness , &quot; will look_into the still-murky area of consciousness , something Bingham says scientists didn ' t even touch 20 years ago -- &quot; It was ' the C-word ' back then. &quot; It is a subject now responsible_for an explosion of books , and Bingham has talked with some of the important authors , among them Churchland ( &quot; Neurophilosophy &quot; ) , Daniel Dennett ( &quot; Consciousness Explained &quot; ) and Francis Crick ( &quot; The Astonishing Hypothesis &quot; ) , the co-discoverer of DNA . For Bingham , one of the segment ' s most compelling questions deals with the so-called binding problem : &quot; How is our mind able to put_together the shape with the color with the movement , and form it into an image we can make_sense of ? A very hot notion at the moment is that there may be an area or areas of the brain that act_as a chorus of voices in synchrony , that this area links different brain areas together . It ' s all quite speculative. &quot; ( Ever mindful of visual metaphors , Bingham will suggest this with footage of a choir singing. ) &quot; The Social Brain &quot; is what Bingham is calling the third segment , which will , among other things , explore what various cultures have in common , such_as facial_expressions , tendencies toward aggression and altruism . It will even look_at the search among scientists at Atlanta ' s Yerkes Regional Primate Center to discover if non-human primates have an innate sense of morality . Any conversation with Bingham suggests , though , that he is especially excited about the fourth segment . Called &quot; The Way of Science , &quot; it posits that the practice of science is itself a way to enlightenment , a never-ending quest_for the ultimate answer to life -- &quot; that formula explaining everything that you can stick_on a T-shirt , &quot; as he puts it . &quot; I believe that doing science is a kind of workaday holiness , &quot; Bingham says . &quot; What I mean is that I don ' t think it ' s fair for religion and mysticism to corner the market on awe . Being able to comprehend nature , as Darwin did , is in a sense like reading the book of creation . The stories science tells have such incredible magnitude and importance that , frankly , make other world_views rather pokey and medieval. &quot; In physics , the quest has often been for the elusive Grand Unification Theory . The big story Bingham is_after is complexity -- a field so new , so avant-garde , that this usually glib , erudite man hesitates giving a quick definition . Complexity is the sort of thing Bingham loves -- making connections , the synthesizing of ideas . At Complexity U . -- the Santa Fe Institute -- Caltech physicist Murray Gell-Mann and a network of biologists , anthropologists , economists and ecologists are studying systems through nature , from ancient civilizations to rain_forests , to find_out why a simple system ( such_as a single cell ) will explode into a complex one ( such_as multiple cells , the emergence of which set_off massive development of life on Earth ) . &quot; It ' s extraordinarily promising , &quot; Bingham says , &quot; because if the study of complex adaptive systems finds a common pattern through nature -- simple to more complex , from grunts to language , from a wind to a hurricane , from barter to a global market_economy -- it may hit on that big unifying idea science has always desired. &quot; Francis Crick is facing Roger Bingham , and the camera , operated by crack video men Mitch Wilson and Jack Combs , is running . The publicity-shy Crick rarely goes before a camera for anything . But here at the Salk Institute in La Jolla , where Crick works in the office once occupied by the late Jacob Bronowski , host of PBS ' &quot; The Ascent of Man , &quot; he is happy to put_across his ideas on mind science to someone he respects . It is something Bingham enjoys , as he is aware of his special relationship with the often-remote scientific community . Bingham belongs_to the small band of science reporters who plow through vast amounts of scientific literature and distill the information for the rest of us . &quot; Scientists really do want to talk with him , &quot; notes Churchland of UC San Diego , &quot; because they respect the fact that he really does his homework . He ' s one of the best there is . He has a wonderful tenacity to doggedly pursue a question until he finally figures it out. &quot; Bingham was born in 1948 in the seaside town of Blackpool in England ' s northwest . He was drawn to chemistry as a boy by a charismatic teacher ; he jumped a_few grades and later read chemistry at University College , London . He did not retire to the lab , however ; in the watershed political year of 1968 , he was president of the university ' s student_union . &quot; I was the moderate meditator , &quot; he says , &quot; getting some basic student rights. &quot; After he helped to plan and organize the first student-owned and -managed housing in Britain , Bingham met writer Ray Hawkey . &quot; He asked me if I would do the science research for a novel he was writing , and I said I ' d rather co-author it. &quot; The novel , &quot; Wild Card , &quot; set_in an anarchic Los Angeles of the future , brought both writers to L.A. &quot; on the day that the Symbionese Liberation Army was in the gun battle with the police , &quot; Bingham says . &quot; It wasn ' t too long after that I knew I wanted to live here . Everything was more relaxed than England , and I found American scientists more approachable than British ones. &quot; After &quot; Wild Card &quot; appeared in 1974 , Bingham devoted himself to writing_about science . One of his magazine assignments -- a profile of Carl Sagan during the making of &quot; Cosmos &quot; at KCET -- brought him to the station he has been associated with since 1984 . Eventually , after his work with Benti and the first science reports for KCET , Bingham persuaded the station to create a science production unit . With Linda , whom he married in 1984 , as creative partner , Bingham turned the unit into his little factory for churning_out several hours a year of scientific wit and wisdom . &quot; The Human Quest &quot; is the ultimate product of the unit . It was axed in 1991 , a victim of KCET production cuts . Few TV journalists have sign-on access to Caltech ' s computer_network , which Bingham faithfully rings into . It ' s another indicator of his ties to the scientific community . &quot; We science communicators , &quot; Bingham says , &quot; are ex-officio , honorary members of the scientific world . They let us in , talk_about their ideas even before they publish , and that means that the ideas on the screen are going_to be pretty fresh . And because we talk to specialists , it happens that we bring the specialists together to meet for the first time. &quot; Asked to name a_few books that would give the viewer some background for &quot; The Human Quest , &quot; he revealingly mentions works by those in his small band of reporters -- such_as Matt Ridley and his daring new work &quot; The Red Queen &quot; and Roger Lewin and his witty primer &quot; Complexity : Life at the Edge of Chaos. &quot; ( Among Bingham ' s other suggestions , by scientists : Helena Cronin ' s &quot; The Ant and the Peacock , &quot; Michael S . Gazzaniga ' s &quot; Nature ' s Mind , &quot; Nicholas Humphrey ' s &quot; A History of the Mind &quot; and Melvin Konner ' s &quot; The Tangled Wing. &quot; ) But since Bingham works_on the tube , and thus for a much bigger audience than Ridley or Lewin , he feels that much more pressure : &quot; You take_on a responsibility -- it ' s also a great pleasure -- of passing_on invigorating ideas . You see , especially in science reporting , you can ' t make mistakes . You ' ve got_to be factually accurate . I even had to make_sure for a shot we were doing involving Descartes that we had the right meaning and spelling of his famous phrase ' cogito ergo sum , ' &quot; -- or &quot; I think , therefore I am. &quot; Nothing goes unchecked , which makes_for a long production schedule . When both Linda and Roger explain how they are able to amass the information for the series ( &quot; Read a lot , &quot; they say in unison ) , it also points_out that in television , &quot; there ' s a point where you have to stop reading and start shooting , &quot; as series co-writer and co-producer Carl Byker says . To be sure , Byker -- a Writers Guild award-winning writer and producer ( the 1988 documentary &quot; Power in the Pacific &quot; ) -- was hired by KCET last year to help press production forward . &quot; The Human Quest &quot; has been_on the KCET slate for a while : The original budgeting stretches back to 1991 , and research-generated revisions have only stretched production out further . Everyone at KCET involved with &quot; The Human Quest &quot; marvels at the largess of thK . Whittier Foundation , which has contributed $ 1.5 million for the series -- an unusually large contribution , according to series executive producer Joyce Campbell . The only other funding , $ 500 # 000 , came from KCET itself . That forced such budget-cutting measures as shooting on videotape rather than film and forgoing a trip to India for the segment on consciousness . &quot; So , &quot; Bingham says as he walks along the shore just south of the Salk Institute , &quot; you get inventive . In Indonesia , we were able to shoot at the Borobudur temple -- where we show a vision of nature , like complexity , though unlike science it ' s written in stone . In that same corner of the world , we could shoot the ' Wallace Line , ' where Alfred Wallace had detected a division in species , caused as we know now by plate tectonics. &quot; Bingham waves_off any concerns that his evolutionary-revolutionary themes will upset those viewers who hold to a literal_interpretation of biblical creation . &quot; we ' ll find that science is expansive , not reductive , &quot; he says , looking_out at the setting sun . &quot; If it ' s complexity or something else that will come_up with answers to the Big Questions , we can ' t know . Whether they ' ll be answers that we like -- we can ' t know that either . &quot; People may_not pay_attention to the answers when they do come . Remember , Darwin ' s ' Origin of Species ' came_out in 1859 , and millions of human_beings still blow it off. &quot;</TEXT>
