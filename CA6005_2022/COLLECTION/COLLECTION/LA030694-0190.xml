   <HEADLINE> THE HIGH_SCHOOLS / PAIGE A . LEECH : A CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH IS NEVER FIT TO BE TIED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s a ridiculous way to determine a champion . In fact , it doesn ' t even determine one . It determines two . When teams play for a title , the game isn ' t over until there is a winner and a loser . A champion and a runner-up . Period . Apparently the world of soccer has a more egalitarian view . Moorpark and Calabasas highs played to a 1-1 tie Friday in a Southern Section Division V final and were declared co-champions . Come_on . Co-championships are so . . . unresolved . To the victor goes the spoils . Now , that ' s the spirit . None of this sharing stuff in a championship . It ' s ludicrous . It is the ninth boys ' soccer co- championship since section title matches began in 1964 . By now , section officials should have figured_out a more decisive tiebreaker scheme . Ask Moorpark Coach Michael Scanlon , who watched his top-ranked Musketeers play more aggressively than Calabasas , only to finish with a tie . &quot; I think these boys would have rather played until they dropped , &quot; Scanlon said . &quot; I know my guys would have. &quot; After regulation play , the teams were deadlocked , 1-1 . They played two 10-minute overtime_periods , but remained tied . Interestingly , from this point on , tiebreakers differ in preliminary-round playoff matches from the championship match . In preliminary-round playoff matches , teams play two 10-minute sudden-death periods after the two 10-minute overtime_periods . Then , if the teams remain tied , penalty kicks determine a winner in all Southern Section playoff_games except the final . &quot; I don ' t think a championship should ever be determined on penalty kicks , because then you ' re just a champion of penalty kicks , &quot; Scanlon said . However , Scanlon would have liked to play the sudden-death periods in the championship match . And there is no reason not to play sudden_death . But after 100 minutes of soccer Friday , there was no loser , only two champions . Sort of . While Calabasas players openly relished the co-championship , the Musketeers , who had previously beaten and tied Calabasas in Frontier League play , hung their heads in disappointment . &quot; If you would have walked on the field , you would have thought we lost , &quot; Scanlon said . A sportswriter counted 18 shots on goal by Moorpark and three by Calabasas . Moorpark ' s statistician had a 26-8 count . But the match isn ' t won by shots on goal any more_than a baseball_game is won by the number of runners to reach base . &quot; Soccer is unique in that you can defend and defend and defend -- or else you can go_out and try to win it , &quot; said Scanlon , summing_up the two teams ' approaches . The absurdity of the co-championships is clear when one considers that the Valley region had not produced a Southern Section soccer champion since Harvard won the small schools division in 1990 . Now the region features two champions . . . but just one title . * Tale of twos : The Harvard-Westlake and Burroughs highs boys ' soccer teams each played without two of their best players in Division III semifinal matches last week . The results , however , differed drastically . Without junior midfielders Brian Angelini ( suspended for receiving two yellow cards in the previous match ) and Warren Davidoff ( sprained ankle ) , Harvard-Westlake ( 20-5-3 ) lost to Bell Gardens , 1-0 , in Studio City . Burroughs -- without top players Anthony Perico ( broken leg ) and Juan Almaguer ( sprained ankle ) -- defeated Brea-Olinda , 2-0 , to advance to the Division III final . * Buena is bueno : Now that the Buena girls ' basketball_team has made_it to five consecutive Southern Section finals -- winning twice -- people are coming_out of nowhere to claim a small portion of the credit . Buena defeated Mater Dei , 50-41 , Friday night for its second consecutive Division I-A title . With only two seniors on this season ' s squad , the Bulldogs are likely to be a force for years to come . The future is freshman Nicole Greathouse , a 6-foot-1 center and the first off the bench for the Bulldogs , who will continue their quest_for a state title with regional playoffs this week . Before Greathouse honed her basketball skills on the Ventura Stars youth team , she took her initial instruction from the son of her baby-sitter , Jim Friery , who is now the Van Nuys baseball_coach . &quot; I think I was the first one to teach her how to dribble , &quot; said Friery , rather coyly . Greathouse went_to Jean Friery ' s home for day_care for several years in her youth . One day Jim Friery instructed a 6-year-old Greathouse to dribble the ball once and stop . Twice and stop . Three times and stop , and so on . Greathouse , averaging 9.4 points and 7.2 rebounds a game , was thoroughly engrossed by her new drill and dribbled all_the way home , according to Friery . Later that evening , Friery and his mother received a call from an excited Greathouse . &quot; She went from three ( bounces ) to 500 in one afternoon , &quot; Friery said . &quot; She was such a dedicated player -- even at that age. &quot; Greathouse continues to improve by leaps and bounds , according to Buena Coach Joe Vaughan . &quot; She ' s about a year and half away from playing like Michelle Giordano , &quot; Vaughan said . Quite a compliment considering Giordano has committed to Arizona and averages 17.9 points a game .</TEXT>
