   <HEADLINE> PAIN AS PART OF THE GAME ; PLAYERS MUST TAKE AGONY WITH ECSTASY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sports are a last-second finger-tip catch in the end zone . A home_run in the bottom of the ninth . A wedge of sprinters gasping and leaning toward the finish_line . A downhill run_on fresh-packed snow . Sports are exhilaration , heartbreak , the maximized effort by the talented . But sports are also a pain in the butt . And elbow . And knee . Not to mention wrist , ankle and hip . Play any game long enough , no matter the conditions or your conditioning , and one thing is certain : You are bound to get hurt . The more physically demanding the sport , the greater the chance . High_school athletes are not immune . Look_on the sidelines during any Friday night football game , and you ' re bound to see one or two players in casts or heavy bandages . Volleyball_players wear a rainbow collage of bruises from diving on floors . Let a gymnast land awkwardly after a double somersault from the uneven bars , and . . . ouch . Even a badminton shuttlecock , which can travel up_to 110 m.p.h. , can hurt if it hits in the right spot . Despite tremendous strides in conditioning , technology , equipment , facilities and coaching , kids still go bump in the night . &quot; I like to think sports are less dangerous , but I don ' t know if anyone has proved that , &quot; said Dr. Craig Milhouse , medical director at Anaheim Memorial Sports Medicine . &quot; There will be injuries , but I think in a lot of areas many are from overuse -- where people practice too_much and won ' t stop when they feel pain . They don ' t listen to their bodies . &quot; If it seems like we ' re seeing more injuries , it ' s only because we ' re looking_for more and are more knowledgeable . The way we approach things with more trainers and more sports-trained physicians , we can identify an injury that a kid doesn ' t get_back on the field with. &quot; That , along with conventional and unconventional rehabilitation methods , has saved the seasons of two key Orange Country athletes . Los Alamitos junior Kevin Feterik had earned the starting quarterback job , but broke his left ( throwing ) hand in the first_half of the season opener against Kennedy . Feterik had been hurt before -- breaking a finger and an elbow as a child -- but never playing football , which he has played since he was 8 . &quot; I was devastated ; this was my first varsity game and first chance to prove myself , &quot; said Feterik , 17 . &quot; We were winning , and I wanted to finish . I thought I ' d be out five to six weeks and my season was done . I was real down , although winning the game helped. &quot; Disregarding an initial prognosis that would have sidelined him until league play began , Feterik sought the care of San Clemente therapist Benny Poda , who prescribed acupuncture , vitamin_C , amino_acids and herbs . Feterik did not get a hard plaster_cast , opting instead for a soft plastic covering . He was back playing by Oct . 7 against Long_Beach Millikan . Feterik said the injury gave him a new sense of his vulnerability . &quot; All the time you hear about people getting hurt , but I never realized how lucky I was until that game . Now I ' m not taking being healthy for granted . At any time you can be hurt . You still go 100 % , but it made me realize you ' re not invincible. &quot; Likewise , cross-country runner Jessica Corbin was expected to lead the Irvine girls ' team to glory similar to last year ' s State Division I championship . But in late August , while attending a training camp , the junior began feeling pain in her left leg and hip . &quot; I don ' t know how it happened , &quot; said Corbin , 16 . &quot; My training was going so good -- I was running , lifting weights , dieting . Everything was perfect . I had run 11 miles once , and averaged four to five miles a practice. &quot; When Corbin was first examined , the diagnosis was a pinched nerve in her back triggering the pain . Later , it was discovered she had Pirifomis syndrome , in which the muscle pressures the sciatic_nerve . But before that , Corbin was nearly done_in by her treatment . A large daily dose of ibuprofen was first prescribed , but it began tearing_up Corbin ' s stomach , causing internal bleeding . Corbin continued to run , wondering why her performance was slipping ; soon she had more serious problems : anemia , a throat-and-sinus virus and viral bronchitis . Like Feterik , Corbin was worried her season was lost . &quot; What devastated me was coming_down with the bronchitis , &quot; she said . &quot; I could run with the hip irritation , the internal stuff , but I couldn ' t run with that . I came_home from the trip to Stanford ( Oct . 1 ) , where we didn ' t do too well , and I was in tears . There were so many emotions ; I wanted to run but I knew I couldn ' t . I knew my health comes_before running , and it was now a health issue. &quot; After being told not to run_for a week and changing medication , Corbin -- who finished fifth Saturday at the Orange County Championships at Irvine Regional Park -- said she ' s recovered , at least mentally . &quot; My confidence went_down a lot when I got injured , but I had to look_at it as it was only six days that I was out . And six days in perspective is not really a lot . I had to do some soul searching , regain my confidence in myself . that ' s the main thing ; it wasn ' t the injury , it was the loss of confidence and hope . I thought , ' There goes college and everything. ' &quot; Corbin ' s injury was rare . Feterik ' s was not . &quot; I don ' t think kids are getting hurt any more now than 10 to 20 years ago , &quot; said Joe Donohue , the physical_therapist for the Corona del Mar and Fountain Valley high_school football_teams . &quot; In my eight years as a therapist , I ' ve seen the same type of injuries . Occasionally , you have one year of super athletes and the ( number of ) impacts are higher . But kids grow_up the same ; they may be 10 pounds heavier than they were 10 years ago , but that kind of thing evens out. &quot; According to area doctors and physical_therapists , these are the types of injuries that most often occur in sports : * Cross-country and track participants often sustain overuse injuries such_as strained hamstrings , shin splints and tears in the plantar fascia ( a fibrous band of tissue that connects heel to toe ) . Runners can get tendinitis in their knees . * Football_players sustain sprains , strains and broken bones , particularly in the legs . They are also vulnerable to stretched or torn ligaments . * Basketball_players suffer knee and ankle problems from jumping and twisting . They also tear_up knees ; there has been a rash of torn anterior cruciate ligament problems for both males and females in the high_school and college games . * Volleyball_players have ankle problems , as well as shoulder problems from spiking . * Swimmers , divers and water_polo athletes have shoulder problems . There are occasional knee problems from the circular kick used in the breaststroke . * Baseball and softball players have shoulder and arm problems , primarily from overuse . * Golfers can suffer back problems from the twisting of the trunk during their swings . Not as prevalent are wrist and elbow problems . * Wrestlers sustain injuries similar to football_players . * Tennis and badminton players develop difficulties in elbows and shoulders . * Soccer players have all sorts of leg problems , including ankles and knees . &quot; Every sport has its unique injuries , &quot; said Sean Higgs , a trainer at Fountain Valley High . &quot; You ' ll find studies that support the use of every brace , and you ' ll find studies that say they don ' t do any good . One of our keystones is taping . It ' s mandatory for all football starters to be taped . But to say if it helps , how do you do a study on that ? It seems to be working , but we have nothing to compare it to. &quot; No matter , the margins of safety have been increased . Ron La Ruffa , Fountain Valley baseball_coach , remembers coaching in the 1960s as &quot; taking your 10 swings and 20 ground balls. &quot; &quot; Now there are coaches for every phase of the game , even at high_school , &quot; he said . &quot; Strength and conditioning dramatically improved . A kid has a much better education from the coaching. &quot; But the greatest progress is probably in football . Dr. Fred Mueller , professor of physical_education at the University of North Carolina , has studied catastrophic injuries -- those causing death and permanent paralysis -- among football_players for more_than 20 years . Because of refined equipment and rule changes , those kind of tragic incidents have dropped dramatically . In 1968 , there were 36 deaths in football , according to Mueller ' s research . Twenty-six of the victims were high_school players . Add_to that an average of 25-30 accidents a year that resulted in paralysis in the late ' 60s . Among the reasons : &quot; Teaching kids to block_and_tackle leading with their head into the chest , &quot; Mueller said . &quot; That could cause major damage to spinal cords. &quot; Starting in 1976 , a nationwide rule change eliminated initial contact with head or face while blocking_and_tackling . Four years later , standards for the manufacturing of helmets for high_school players were established . Add improved medical techniques , and the difference borders_on astonishing . In 1993 , there were only four direct deaths , of them three were high_school players . ( In 1990 , there was none , the first time since 1931. ) There were only eight paralyzing injuries to high_school players . &quot; To bring_in the numbers that low is pretty good , &quot; Mueller said . Especially when you consider how sports continue to grow in popularity . But soccer and cross-country , two of the state ' s fastest growing participation sports among girls , have come under_fire for the number of injuries they supposedly cause . In 1993 , the Consumer Product Safety Commission reported 76 # 766 general soccer injuries nationwide , of which 56 # 418 came during organized activities . Nearly 42 % of these injuries occurred to players ages 15-24 , with the most common being cuts , bruises , sprains and strains . The commission stated injuries tend to increase as players get older , from age 14 on , and girls generally sustained more injuries of all types than boys . Meanwhile girls ' cross-country is receiving national scrutiny . Dr. Stephen Rice , a faculty_member of the University of Washington ' s Division of Sports Medicine , conducted a 13-year study of about 60 # 000 high_school athletes in 20 sports in the Seattle area . Among the findings : * Fall sports had higher rates of injury than spring sports . * The highest-risk sports include football , wrestling , gymnastics , cross-country ( girls and boys ) and soccer ( girls and boys ) . * Girls ' sports have higher rates of injury than counterpart boys ' sports . * And finally , girls ' cross-country had the highest injury risk , according to the study . Out of 1 # 299 athletes tracked , 61.45 % reported some type of injury . Football was next at 58.8 % . In addition , girls ' cross-country had a 17.3 % injury rate per 1 # 000 practices and meets . Football again was second , at 12.7 % . Cross-country &quot; came_out of the blue , &quot; Rice said . &quot; We did not come ( to this study ) with the idea we ' d find this . If it had been football first and wrestling second , no one would have been interested. &quot; Rice believed the number of cross-country injuries -- most of them being shin splints and muscle strains -- came because girls had not always properly prepared during the summer before the season , then tried to do too_much work in the fall . He also frowns at programs that have athletes running 50-70 miles a week in training . That , he contends , can lead to serious problems in still-developing skeletal_structures . Girls have another enemy -- body fat , or specifically too_little of it . Those with low estrogen levels who continue rigorous training can have menstrual_cycles interrupted . That can also lead to the body ' s inability to retain ingested calcium in the bones , which might lead to shin splints and stress_fractures . The report , naturally , was not warmly received by cross-country coaches , who feared hysterical reactions from parents concerned about the well-being of their children . &quot; The study . . . can be misleading , &quot; said Randy Rossi , who coaches girls ' cross-country at Irvine . &quot; But there are some legitimate concerns he addresses . More often than not , kids try to do too_much too soon . But at Irvine , we ' ve had no great injury problem , though we have had our share of shin splints and variety of aches and pains . &quot; As far as making sports safer , I think we ' re heading in that direction . There ' s more attention to preparation , and sports medicine keeps making leaps forward . I wasn ' t pleased with ( Rice ' s ) report , but it ' s important we address the issues. &quot; Diane Hale has coached girls ' cross-country for 35 years , the last 20 at El Toro High . She , argues the sheer increase in participation has plenty to do with the rise in injuries . &quot; When we started at El Toro in 1975 , I had five girls on the team , &quot; Hale said . &quot; Now I have 60 . I ' ll have injuries because I attract kids who want to be in a sport but do not have the background of being in athletics over long_time . Some of the girls are starting fresh at 14 years old . Therein lies a problem . &quot; If I , as a runner , don ' t have a good summer program to build a base on , I won ' t be ready for the September workouts and break_down . It ' s not the conditioned runner that has problems that knock her out for six weeks. &quot; Rice knew some coaches would be angry once his study was published . &quot; My response is I ' m as surprised as anybody by the results , &quot; he said . &quot; But obviously there is something going_on that is creating the problem. &quot; Even though athletes today are_better coached , better protected , better conditioned and , when necessary , more easily healed , it ' s still nearly impossible for them to avoid injury . Because if nothing else , kids will be kids .</TEXT>
