   <HEADLINE> TASTE OF TRAVEL : OKINAWA : NOT QUITE JAPANESE ; THE CUISINE OF THESE ISLANDS IS BOLD , EARTHY AND IN SOME WAYS CLOSER TO CHINA THAN JAPAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Picking my way over the bumpy dirt road behind the Sakae market , the melancholy strains of a shamisen , barely audible above the hubbub of voices , greet me as I duck under the curtain and slide open the door of the bar / restaurant Urizun . The regulars at the bar scoot over to make room for me on my first night back in Naha . Our host and friend , Tsuchiya Saneyuki , welcomes me back and introduces me to a_few people I haven ' t met before . He places in front of me a small , heavy cup of dark brown earthenware from a local kiln , its unglazed surface glossed here and there with melted ash . The clear , strong , brisk flavor of the colorless liquid within has none of the sweetness of sake . It perfectly complements the briny , slightly bitter taste of ajike no wata , the innards of a large bivalve , simply dressed with vinegar . Distilled from fragrant Thai rice , awamori is closer to the shochu distilled liquor of Japan ' s Kyushu island . These bold flavors embody the essence of Okinawa . That there is indeed an Okinawan cuisine , different from that of Japan , is plain to anyone who has spent any time in those wind-swept islands of blazing colors and clear light . Pork in all its permutations and the conspicuous absence of fish from the formal meal ; an emphasis on fresh vegetables , often enriched with pork ; accents of garlic and the peppery spice piipaachi , and the copious use of konbu seaweed arouse the palate with flavors alien to the narrow range of Japanese food . Like the cuisines of southern China , salt rather than soy_sauce brings_out the essence . Before Japan forcibly annexed it in 1879 , Okinawa was an independent kingdom , known to the Japanese as Ryukyu . If anything , the influence of the south Chinese province of Fujian , where Okinawan government emissaries landed in the heyday of Ryukyu trade , dominates that of Japan . The tea served with local sweets is usually jasmine , brought_to Okinawa from Fujian after annexation . In 1972 , Okinawa once again became a prefecture of Japan , as it was from the late 19th Century until the final stage of World_War_II . The Ryukyus also possess a distinctive culture strong enough to have survived submission to China and subjugation by Japan , the annual devastation of typhoons , and the near-total destruction of their material culture by both American and Japanese armed forces during World_War_II ( in which one-third of the civilian population died ) followed by almost three decades of American military occupation . The latter left an unfortunate heritage of a persistent penchant for Spam and Coca-Cola . But food is one aspect of the local culture that survived the past century more nearly intact than many of the arts , since it is created anew many times a day with simple techniques and readily available , inexpensive ingredients . Okinawan cuisine , reflecting at_the_same_time the people who make and enjoy it and the land that produces it , seems an indestructible part of Okinawan identity . * The sprawling public market in the middle of downtown Naha is not only the belly but the heart of the city . The main entrance , at the conjunction of the main_drag , Kokusai-dori , and Heiwa-dori , leads down a gentle slope into an arcaded warren of lanes lined with stalls , almost all_of them manned by women . Many of these are the same women -- some now in their seventies and eighties -- who brought their own produce here in the years following the war , to sell and to buy on the black_market to feed their families . The market has grown_up around them . Shopping in the early morning is not an Okinawan custom , and it isn ' t until late morning that the market really bustles with women shopping and selling . Piles of glowing green vegetables , some familiar , some strange , seem to burst from the narrow stalls -- hechima ( in Okinawan , naberaa , the same as the familiar luffah ) , a green gourd heavy with water ; goya , a bitter gourd covered with warts ; green papayas ; smooth round winter_melons , and a wealth of leafy greens -- including nigana , a bitter green resembling dandelion_greens , and fuchiba , known in mainland Japan as yomogi ( in English as mugwort ) , where it ' s mainly used to flavor sweets . Others have clearly defined medicinal functions , like the glossy deep purple leaves of handama , with a deliciously nutty flavor , good for cleaning_out your system . Concealed beneath their scruffy skins , the violet-tinged potato ( called ta-umu , &quot; wet-field potato , &quot; in Okinawa ) and the crimson-skinned murasaki-umu have been credited with saving the people of these islands from starvation . Imported from China at the beginning of the 17th Century , they supplanted millet and other grains as the staple food of the common_people . Only the aristocracy and samurai classes ate rice . It wasn ' t until after World_War_II that most people in Okinawa began to eat rice regularly . The cool , dark shops within the covered arcade specialize in dried goods and offer many grades and varieties of konbu ( kelp ) . The Okinawan appetite for konbu goes_back at least as far as the 18th Century , when ships from Hokkaido sold the leathery dried seaweed in exchange for Ryukyuan sugar . Other seaweeds , the soft , thread-like aasaa and slippery strands of mozuku , are also favorites , rich_in minerals and apparently playing a role in reducing cholesterol -- important in this pork-rich cuisine . Glistening black water-snakes ( dried ) lie_in coils or hang from the eaves of the market building . White ginger flowers in front of a nearby florist perfume the alleys . Stalls of spices , herbs , roots and packaged teas highlight the strong association here , as in China , between food and medicine . * Tsuchiya meets me in the fish market . The fishes ' sleek , glistening bodies are as dazzling as the coral_reefs where they swam until a_few hours ago . Spotted scarlet miibai ( a kind of white fish ) ; another miibai , brown with leopard spots ; gray irabucha ( also a white-fleshed fish ) , turquoise about the gills , and yellow-black-and-white-striped flatfish rest_on snowy beds of ice . Something nameless , opal and turquoise with big teeth , grins at us . Yellow and green crabs , their claws bound with blue vinyl ribbon , bubble helplessly on crushed ice ; in a large tank , six different types of prawns move lazily ; lobsters decorated with unimaginable rainbows wriggle amethyst antennae . In spite of this brilliant array of the sea ' s wealth , fish is not considered part of a formal Okinawan meal except in the highly processed and refined form of kamaboko ( usually translated &quot; fish paste &quot; or &quot; fish_cake &quot; ) . I ask my guide how this could be . &quot; People who went_to sea were considered lazy , &quot; he begins in Japanese . They were supposed to be tilling the fields . &quot; The common_people must have eaten fish , but they probably did_it in secret . . . &quot; Local officials discouraged the islanders from fishing for their own subsistence , preferring to keep them working to produce goods that would enrich the government . The meat market blazes with bare light_bulbs suspended over piles and piles of fresh pink pork , presided over by spirited and sexy women with Amazonian arms . Okinawans use every_last bit of the pig -- from unctuous chunks of fresh bacon , generously layered with fat , cartilaginous ears , snout and face , feet , rich innards and blood . A liberal use of lard enriches and marries the flavors of many vegetables . Upstairs on the second floor of the meat market , the Oyako Shokudo ( parent-child luncheonette ) is famous for its nakami-jiru , a rich soup made from chitterlings ( pig ' s intestines ) , served only on Saturdays . By noon the place is buzzing . Every day mother and daughter prepare only one or two set lunches , real home cooking . Today it ' s soki-jiru , a rich broth made from meaty pork ribs , lightly flavored with miso bean paste , crowned with a mound of greens and served with a bowl of rice . Tomorrow ' s lunch ? &quot; I won ' t know until I see tomorrow ' s vegetables , &quot; says the silver-toothed lady behind the counter . Dessert following an Okinawan meal is likely to be confined to fresh fruit , but throughout the day sweets are offered whenever tea is served . The sweets made in the sleek Japanese-style shop , Jahana , called kippan and togazuke , are firmly based in the court tradition . The complementary flavors of kippan -- a dense , bittersweet nugget made from the white part of the peel of mandarin_oranges , glazed with sugar -- and togazuke -- candied winter_melon with an indefinable , delicate flavor , cooked in sugar until meltingly tender , hardening on the outside to a fragile crystalline shell -- are the perfect foil for green Japanese tea or the more delicate types of Chinese tea . Four generations ago , Jahana ' s ancestors were Chinese immigrants in the Kume district of the city . Before the war there were three other such confectioneries . Now only Jahana remains . * Urizun is one of those very rare places that combines wonderful food , sincere and unmistakable warmth and local color . Craftspeople and artists , real_estate_agents , teachers , musicians , businessmen , photographers , doctors , naturalists and other representatives of the diverse Okinawan society gather nightly to share the easy familiarity of the place and his or her preferred style of awamori . The finest is kosu , &quot; aged liquor , &quot; stored in earthy brown ceramic vats for up_to 30 years , served in thimble-size cups . The menu , a marriage of the cuisine developed at the royal Ryukyu court and the food of the common_people ( clear distinctions are lost in the haze of history ) , maintains a fine balance between the richness of pork , garlic and potatoes , and the lightness of seaweed , fish , tofu and vegetables . The light_touch is that of Tsuchiya Keiko , who comes_in every day from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. to do the hardest part of the preparation , oversee the arrival of groceries and generally keep things in_order ( in addition to keeping house and taking_care of the children ) . As I help her stir the mashed potatoes in the narrow kitchen one morning , she asks me , &quot; can ' t you make my husband come_in and give me a hand with the cooking ? Not every day -- but once in a while ? &quot; A meal at Urizun might include some or all_of the following traditional dishes . Tofuyo is an intensely flavored little cube of tofu that has been fermented for at least six months with rice ; salty and slightly sharp like aged cheese , its flavor becomes smoother and richer with time , complementing that of awamori perfectly . Sunui , a gelatinous seaweed known as mozuku in mainland Japan , is dressed with vinegar and here enlivened ( on request in deference to tame palates ) by a dab of grated garlic . Mimigaa sashimi is thin slices of pigs ' ears , blanched and dressed with vinegar and soy_sauce , their crunchy texture as important ( if not more so ) than the delicate and elusive flavor . More substantial dishes include kuubu irichii , stir-fried , finely julienned konbu ( kelp ) seaweed , flavored with bits of pork and fishcake ( kamaboko ) ; duruwakashii , unctuous mashed potatoes made from ta-umu sauteed in a bit of oil with their green stems , bits of pork , kamaboko and shiitake_mushrooms ; and raaftei , fresh bacon , alternating layers of succulent meat and rich fat , cut_into large chunks and braised with miso ( fermented bean paste ) and vegetables until meltingly tender . My last night in Naha , a classic Okinawan specialty is_on the menu : ika sumijiru , a wonderfully fragrant and intense soup of squid and its ink . The steaming opaque black liquid ( based on a hearty pork stock ) , with snowy pieces of squid , daikon and the slightly bitter green leaves of nigana afloat in a red lacquer bowl are a shock to the eye , but with a reassuring velvety consistency and deliciously complex flavor . Okinawan food should be enjoyed in its natural habitat , made with local ingredients , served on robust Okinawan pottery or elegant lacquer , to the sounds of the joyous and mournful sanshin ( ancestor of Japan ' s stringed shamisen ) . In a word , the food that embodies Okinawa ' s culture should be relished in all_the complexities of Okinawa itself .
