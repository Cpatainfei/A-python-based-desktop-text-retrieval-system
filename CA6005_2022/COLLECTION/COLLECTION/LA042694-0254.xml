   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH : 10 COMMANDMENTS FOR HEALTHIER KIDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are diapers to change and play dates to arrange . Spills to wipe_away and fights to break_up . In the chaos of tending to the little challenges of their children ' s well-being parents can easily lose sight of the big picture : their children ' s overall health . How can you make jpassage through early_childhood healthy ? Here ' s a blueprint for building a better child . 1 . Safeguard your property : Accidents -- such_as choking , burns , drowning , falls and poisonings -- are the leading cause of death in children older than 1 , according to the National Commission on Children . Take time to search your house , garage and yard for hazards . If you need guidance , there are many good_books on child-proofing and some local companies will do_it for a fee . 2 . Provide three squares a day and don ' t be a warden at mealtime : Don ' t fret if your child is a picky eater . According to the California Coalition for Healthy Children , the key is to provide three nutritionally balanced meals daily and cut the kids some slack about their culinary preferences . Children should get_to select what foods they want -- and how much they want to eat -- from the choices offered . &quot; Although all children need the same nutrients to grow and develop , they do not need to eat the same diet , &quot; the coalition states . 3 . Stick_to the immunization schedule : More_than half of all 2-year-old children are not up_to date on their immunizations , according to the California Health and Welfare Agency . With so many shots now required ( several have been added in just the past few years ) , it ' s a challenge to keep_up . But maintaining a schedule can prevent severe health consequences -- and lost school time -- for a child who later comes_down with the measles or whooping_cough . Ask your pediatrician for a schedule and a card to help you record immunizations . 4 . Brush those choppers : Children should start brushing their teeth as soon as they are old enough to hold the brush . Young children will lack coordination , but have patience and advise them to &quot; make_noise on their teeth &quot; with the brush , say the authors of the Your Children ' s Wellness Newsletter . Because young children aren ' t the world ' s most thorough dental hygienists , parents should brush_up after them . Only a tiny bit of toothpaste is necessary . 5 . Promote good hygiene : Colds and flu can exhaust parents and make_for long , dreary winters for kids -- and parents . Infections are inevitable , but colds can be limited by teaching children to wash their hands often , especially after using the restroom and before eating . If possible , keep your young children out of day-care situations where there are lots of children and poor hygiene policies . Finally , consider flu shots each fall to prevent or reduce the severity of some wintertime infections . 6 . Get regular medical_checkups : According to the National Commission on Children , nearly 20 % of children in 1990 had no contact with a doctor the previous year . With regular health exams , your pediatrician can best monitor your child ' s growth and development -- and you can intervene early and aggressively if there is any hint of a problem . 7 . Limit couch potato-ing : Children who watch lots of TV are more likely to be overweight and to experiment with drugs and sexual_activity ; another study shows that kids who watch TV news can become angry and depressed over what they see . Limit TV to one hour a day or less , monitor the programs and don ' t let young children watch TV news at all . 8 . Encourage a little sweat : One of the best gifts you can give your child is appreciation for physical activity . Nationwide , 27 % of all children are obese , according to a 1993 study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Assn. ; sedentary lifestyle is a major cause . Promote outdoor time by enrolling children in recreational programs . And since studies show that children are more likely to exercise if their parents do , make regular workouts a family goal . 9 . Keep smoke away : Secondhand tobacco smoke is now recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a significant health risk . In children , exposure to smoke can cause an increase in respiratory illnesses -- such_as pneumonia , bronchitis and asthma -- as well as ear infections . Moreover , it can contribute over the long term to lung_cancer . 10 . Don ' t be a stranger to compliments : There is nothing as important to children ' s self-esteem as being praised by their parents , says Douglas Bloch , author of a series of books on parenting , including the new &quot; Positive Self-Talk for Children. &quot; Make your praise specific and unconditional . Point_out positive traits often . &quot; Such unsolicited comments make a powerful impact on the child , &quot; he says . &quot; They enhance his self-esteem and create a reservoir of goodwill that can sustain your relationship during the difficult periods. &quot;</TEXT>
