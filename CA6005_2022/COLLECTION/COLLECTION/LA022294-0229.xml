   <HEADLINE> ABOVE SARAJEVO , CONTROL OF ARMS FAR FROM CLEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eighteen heavy artillery pieces scattered across a square_mile of rugged , snowy ridge have been deemed by the U.N. Protection Force to be firmly under the control of 2nd Lt . Spike Martin and his British platoon . Yet some of the mortars and howitzers on the steep flanks of this mountain village northwest of Sarajevo still have their barrels trained on the Bosnian capital . Not one has been inspected or dismantled by the U.N. forces assigned here . And all are clearly within easy reach of the machine-gun-slinging Serbian rebels , who outnumber Martin ' s 20-odd men at least three to one . Although all heavy guns within a U.N.-designated exclusion zone around the Bosnian capital were supposed to have been withdrawn or surrendered to U.N. forces by 1 a.m. Monday local_time , only one of the 18 said to be monitored at this official U.N. &quot; collection center &quot; is even within the_British troops ' sight . The sole 105-millimeter howitzer actually pulled_out of its sandbagged battery has been hitched to a Bosnian Serb army truck and parked about 100 yards downhill from the Britons ' roadside encampment . The local Serbian commander retains the truck keys . As conditions at Osjek and at least 31 other weapons depots make clear , U.N. officials have papered over Serbian defiance of a NATO ultimatum for demilitarizing the_hills ringing Sarajevo by declaring the status_quo to be close enough to compliance . The vast and rugged Osjek slope is one of eight places within the 12-mile exclusion zone officially designated by U.N. officers as weapons containment sites . Eighteen other Serb-held areas around Sarajevo are known to still host heavy_weapons covered by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ultimatum but are described by Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the_British commander of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia , as being under U.N. control . At least six other sites were brought_to the United Nations ' attention Monday after NATO aerial reconnaissance flights over the exclusion zone , bringing_to 32 the total of known Serbian gun_emplacements with U.N. supervision that is equal_to or less than that at Osjek . French public affairs officers who arranged a brief and heavily Serb-controlled visit to the Osjek gun_emplacements Monday appeared chagrined at the sight of the hillside batteries that are virtually unchanged despite NATO ' s much-heralded ultimatum . The local Serbian commander , Col . Vladimir Radojic , held_up the U.N.-arranged press visit until nightfall and then forbade journalists from photographing the weaponry , limiting the 10-minute tour to talks with the newly arrived deployment of Martin ' s platoon of the 2nd Company of Britain ' s Coldstream Guards . &quot; The weapons are under our protection and containment over about a square kilometer , &quot; Martin replied when asked if his men had unequivocal control over the guns . The actual area placed under Martin ' s control Saturday was larger than the square kilometer he estimated : Just those Serbian gun_emplacements visible from the roadside extended more_than a mile . The British troops had not been asked to inspect , relocate or render inoperable any of the weapons on their assigned terrain , said Martin , who could not say how many of the guns were still ready for firing because Radojic had yet to tell him . Asked if he could guarantee that the weapons could never be retaken by the Serbian rebels whose homes and front-line positions surround the new U.N. encampment , Martin replied : &quot; I don ' t think that would happen at the moment , because our relations with them are good . They want peace as much as anyone else wants peace. &quot; U.N. commander Rose has boasted that his formula for defining compliance with the ultimatum has brought_about peace , as what was once a daily ration of hundreds of artillery shells blasted at Sarajevo has recently ceased . But the 380 # 000 people still trapped in the Bosnian capital fear the end of bombardment may have come at the price of an indefinite armed standoff and long-term hindrances to their free movement , as they remain surrounded by armed Serbian forces . Many also fear that the U.N. mission will tire of the costly , labor-intensive weapons-monitoring operation that seems largely to be a charade and will eventually abandon the so-called collection sites like the one at Osjek and allow rebel forces to resume their siege . Western leaders had called_for punitive air strikes in the event any un-relinquished heavy weaponry remained within the exclusion zone after Monday ' s deadline . But the appeals for forceful intervention have dissipated amid U.N. claims that the ultimatum has qualitatively eased the risks confronting Sarajevo . Among those touring weapons containment sites such_as Osjek was the senior U.S. liaison officer with the U.N. Protection Force , Lt . Col . Mitchell Triplett . Echoing the positive spin that Western political and military_leaders have put_on the NATO ultimatum and the improved security here that it is said to have created , Triplett declared the far-flung Serbian guns in the Osjek area to be under Martin ' s control . &quot; They ' re having some problems moving some of them . One down the_hill there is going_to need to be towed , and they ( the Serbian rebels ) don ' t have that equipment , &quot; the U.S. Marine Corps officer said , explaining why heavy_weapons remained in their sandbagged dugouts . &quot; But they are certainly under the control of those Brits . They ' ll blow them out of existence if anyone tries to take them away. &quot; However , that was not Martin ' s interpretation of his marching orders in the event of confrontation . &quot; We would resort_to the rules of engagement defined by the United Nations , &quot; the_British officer said . &quot; They are based on principles of self-defense. &quot; In other words , he said , the Coldstream Guards deployed here could draw their weapons on the local Serbian fighters only if their own lives were in danger . A Dutch military observer assigned to watch_over the Osjek site seemed less eager to declare the situation under U.N. control . &quot; I can ' t say that it is 100 % secure here , &quot; he said . Snow is so deep and the terrain so rugged that the armored vehicles would have difficulty maneuvering to some of the gun nests , and some of the artillery is so distant from the_British redoubt that it would take 30 minutes or more to walk there . * RUSSIA BASKS IN SUCCESS : President Yeltsin scores a foreign_policy triumph .
