   <HEADLINE> 126 KILLED IN WWII ATTACK ARE HONORED ; DEDICATION : NEW MEMORIAL IN SAN DIEGO IS THE FIRST AT A NATIONAL CEMETERY IN AMERICA TO HONOR THOSE WHO DIED WHEN A KAMIKAZE PILOT SANK A SHIP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nick Nickless remembers the Japanese Zero diving directly for the flight_deck of the St . Lo and the horror , death and bravery that followed . &quot; It was obvious to us he was trying to commit suicide , &quot; said Nickless , 72 , of Manchester , Mass . &quot; He hit us hard and the explosion knocked everybody down. &quot; Doyle Hoffman was hurrying to his battle station when the first explosion struck . &quot; Somebody hit me from the back and the two of us slid about 20 feet together , &quot; said Hoffman , 69 , of Sitka , Alaska . The St . Lo ' s gasoline and torpedoes set_off a series of fiery explosions , hurling huge pieces of twisted metal hundreds of feet into the air as the Battle for Leyte Gulf , the largest , fiercest naval_battle the world has ever known , raged on . Within 28 minutes the St . Lo had sunk , the first American warship sent to the bottom of the sea by an unprecedented suicidal tactic called the kamikaze . In a ceremony that brought tears to many of the several hundred St . Lo survivors and family members in_attendance Monday , a memorial at Ft . Rosecrans National Cemetery was dedicated to the 126 men killed aboard the St . Lo . The ceremony came 50 years to the day after the sinking of the St . Lo marked the beginning of an extraordinary chapter in World_War_II , one that pitted Japanese pilots fighting to die against American sailors fighting to live . The pilots had volunteered to crash their bomb-laden planes into American ships , inspired by the legend of the kamikaze ( divine wind ) that rescued Japan in the 13th Century from an invading Mongol emperor by destroying his fleet . Slow-moving , lightly defended escort carriers like the St . Lo were a favorite target . Before the war ended 10 months later , kamikazes had sunk 35 American ships , damaged another 368 , killed 4 # 900 U.S. sailors and wounded 4 # 800 . About 3 # 000 kamikaze pilots died , many wearing their burial robes in expectation of achieving divine status . Monday ' s ceremony was a time for remembrance of the victims of the attacks . &quot; God bless the heroes of the USS St . Lo , &quot; said Jerry Bowen , director of the Department of Veterans Affairs ' national cemetery system . Gus Benacka , 68 , who was burned and temporarily blinded by the explosion , survived only because a shipmate risked his life to make_sure Benacka was wearing a &quot; Mae West &quot; life_preserver when the order came_to abandon ship . &quot; To this day I don ' t know who saved me &quot; or whether he survived , said Benacka , of Phoenix . &quot; I ' m just grateful to God for what he did. &quot; Staring at the granite memorial inscribed with the names of the 126 dead , Lou Rodriguez , 73 , of Monterey , Calif. , pondered the imponderable question of war : why some men die and others survive . &quot; You keep thinking : A lot better men than I went_down with the ship , &quot; he said . The memorial to the St . Lo is the first monument at any of America ' s 114 national cemeteries to those who died on a ship sunk by a kamikaze . A second memorial to kamikaze victims aboard the Ommaney Bay , which was sunk during the invasion of Luzon in January , 1945 , will be dedicated at Ft . Rosecrans early next year . There is a memorial in the Philippines to the St . Lo and other ships in its task_force , but the survivors of the St . Lo decided several years ago that that was not good_enough . &quot; The guys who died deserved something here in their own country , &quot; said William C . Brooks , 74 , of Mill Valley , Calif . Funds for the memorial were raised privately by an association of St . Lo survivors . The St . Lo was among those ships assigned to keep the larger and better-armed Japanese ships from advancing toward the Philippine island of Leyte , where American troops had established an important beachhead . Through a miscalculation , the main American fleet , under Adm . William ( Bull ) Halsey , had gone north several hundred miles , leaving the St . Lo and other smaller_ships , led by Rear Adm . Clifton A . F . Sprague , to encounter the Japanese armada . The American victory off Samar Island is considered a turning point in the Pacific war . In his 15-volume history of the Navy in World_War_II , Harvard professor Samuel Eliot Morison writes : &quot; In no engagement in its entire history has the U.S. Navy shown more gallantry , guts and gumption than in those two morning hours off Samar. &quot; Commissioned in mid-1943 as the Midway , the St . Lo came_through the battles for Saipan and Tinian in the Marianas unscathed . Its name was changed in the fall of 1944 by the War_Department to St . Lo in honor of a breakout location after D-day . The name change had upset many of the sailors , who believed_in an old superstition that it is unlucky to change the name of a ship at_sea . One chief_petty_officer even tried to transfer , feeling the ship was jinxed . &quot; We were all absolutely shocked that they would do something like that to a ship going_into battle , &quot; Nickless said . Added Benacka : &quot; It was considered as unlucky as bringing a woman aboard ship. &quot; Two weeks after the name change , the St . Lo was sunk . The date was Oct . 24 in the United States ; Oct . 25 in the Philippines , across the international dateline . Among those killed when the kamikaze crashed into the St . Lo was Lt . John A . Palmer , whose daughter , Patsy Palmer Williams , of Milwaukee , laid a wreath at the foot of the memorial Monday . She was 2 years old when the St . Lo was sunk . &quot; Your father was a great division officer , &quot; said Buddy Barnes , 73 , of Annapolis , Md. , as he tearfully embraced Williams . &quot; We owe our lives to him , &quot; said Rodriguez . The person who sank the St . Lo was an experienced fighter_pilot , unlike many kamikazes who were teen-agers barely able to fly . His timing was impeccable : The St . Lo was refueling and arming its planes , the most vulnerable time for a carrier . &quot; He was the luckiest kamikaze pilot in the fleet , and we were the unluckiest ship , &quot; said Benacka . Seven hundred fifty-four crewmen were rescued from the water . As they bobbed_up and down in the gasoline-laden sea waiting hours to be rescued , St . Lo survivors took_heart that the ship ' s flag was still flying even as it slipped beneath the sea . &quot; We never surrendered , &quot; Nickless said . &quot; We fought to the very end. &quot;</TEXT>
