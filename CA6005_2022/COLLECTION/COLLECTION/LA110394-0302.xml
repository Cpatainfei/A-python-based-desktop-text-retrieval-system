   <HEADLINE> AND ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST . . . ; RADIO : KNAC , THE ' OFFICIAL ' OUTLET FOR THE METAL SCENE , IS BEING SOLD . A DWINDLING AUDIENCE WILL MISS IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s the old joke about banging your head against the wall just because it feels good when you stop . Local head-bangers aren ' t feeling good at all about the news that KNAC-FM ( 105.5 ) is going_to stop playing their favored heavy-metal music . The station is being sold and probably will switch to an all-Spanish format in February . &quot; I feel_like a piece of my past is leaving , &quot; says Lonn Friend , former editor of the hard-rock magazine Rip and now the West Coast vice_president of artists and repertoire for Arista Records . &quot; From traveling around the country , I can tell you there aren ' t many stations like KNAC , and to lose the one in L.A. is sad , &quot; says Bruce Duff , publicist for L.A.-based Triple X Records and a veteran hard-rock and punk musician . But even they acknowledge that KNAC ' s place in the music community had slipped_in recent years , as the popularity of such hard-edged &quot; grunge &quot; bands as Pearl Jam and Nirvana supplanted that of such past hard-rock staples as Motley Crue and Ozzy Osbourne . &quot; The L.A. hard-rock community has been virtually nonexistent for the last several years , &quot; Friend says . &quot; What KNAC was doing was keeping alive some of the music that was prevalent here for a while , but the culture has so changed around hard-rock music that not even a special-interest , small-but-important station can survive the social and musical upheaval. &quot; It ' s a dramatic change from the recent past . It didn ' t take KNAC long after switching to a heavy-metal format in 1986 to become an unavoidable presence in L.A. as the official outlet for the then-strong metal scene -- despite a relatively weak signal . Balancing classic metal-heads like Black Sabbath with a newer generation led by Metallica and Megadeth , KNAC led the charge of hard-rock into the pop chart mainstream . Bumper stickers and T-shirts with the stations ' logo were ubiquitous symbols of rock rebelliousness as the station withstood a challenge from a similarly toned Pirate Radio that failed to encroach on its market a_few years ago . &quot; KNAC was recognized throughout the world as the premiere hard-rock station , &quot; says Greg Sorrels , hard-rock editor for the music industry trade magazine Album Network . &quot; You could see looking in magazines and on TV all_the stars that used to wear their shirts . I was still in Oklahoma six years ago and I knew what KNAC was. &quot; As recently as two years ago , KNAC still seemed ahead of the competition in terms of grabbing on to new , hard-edged bands , including Alice in Chains and Soundgarden . But with the alternative-rock explosion , more powerful KROQ-FM ( 106.7 ) took the lead in that realm , making those and other adventurous , hard-edged acts like Nine Inch Nails central to its playlist . KNAC , meanwhile , seemed slow to program such upstarts as Green Day and the Offspring . Many KNAC regulars do not get played_on KROQ , though , and the metal station ' s demise will leave a void , fans fear . &quot; In the entire region you won ' t be able to hear Pantera , Corrosion of Conformity , Biohazard , &quot; Friend says . &quot; No one ' s going_to play that music , and with no support from MTV for those heavier acts , it ' s going_to become harder to get that music to people. &quot; The most immediate impact may be_on the concert circuit , where promoters often rely_on radio exposure and co-promotions to help sell tickets . &quot; It ' s going_to be real tough now , &quot; says John Reese of BFD Management , whose clients include KNAC regulars Guns ' N Roses and Danzig . &quot; There ' s really no other hard-rock forum for somebody to get the word out , play the music and promote the shows. &quot; Metal mongers are hoping that another station will pick_up the slack . One possibility is KLOS-FM ( 95.5 ) , which has favored a more pop-oriented end of rock , but has recently added newer , harder bands to its programming . &quot; About three months ago , we started to pick_up the tempo and pace of the music and made a noticeable increase in the current records we ' re playing , &quot; says KLOS program director Carey Curlop . &quot; We stand to pick_up a good portion of ex-KNAC listeners . . . . And there will be more concert promotion opportunities for us and a need for us to help support some of those bands. &quot; And , some believe that KNAC ' s demise could actually help revitalize the local hard-rock scene , where a new , core fan-base can be developed . &quot; If the only access to music is in performance , that ' s the only place for the kids to go_out and be exposed to it , &quot; Friend says . &quot; This could spur a revitalization of the hard-rock clubs in Southern California and could really help the unsigned bands -- kids will go see them because it ' s a cheap ticket. &quot;</TEXT>
