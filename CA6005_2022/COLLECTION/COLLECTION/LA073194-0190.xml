   <HEADLINE> ' BOOKS ' OF FUTURE WILL SPEED LEARNING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Kudos is_due your paper for publishing responses ( Letters , July 17 ) to my ideas on future libraries . I am sorry that my point seemed lost in the warm sentiments for books . The crucial issue : There are mediums developing at a rapid pace that improve one ' s ability to learn , be entertained and satisfied . An electronic travelogue that offered a full motion video of Paris might not be preferable to walking the streets of Paris , but it might be more accurately illustrative of Paris than a paper brochure ( a mini-book ? ) , even with photos included . I have the utmost respect for books . They have given me some of my greatest moments of pleasure and learning ; but things are changing . Some relevant facts : Comprehension levels greatly improve when students see videos or movies demonstrating principles or functions being learned . Think_about it this way . If you were reading a history &quot; book &quot; about the Civil War and on the pages that describe the various battles ( in words ) you could touch a spot on the page and see the battle ( s ) taking_place in full motion , full color , video , with sound , would your experience of the subject be enhanced ? The professors of history writing in the journal History Microcomputer Review , which deals with interactive learning programs in the teaching of history in North_American schools , think so . The transition that printed books served took man from the era of limited information to the nearly universal access to information arriving_at our doorstep now . As a society in a competitive world we need to learn how to learn much more a lot faster . Access to our new forms of &quot; books &quot; is of critical importance . Their characteristics will make people smarter , faster . Who will not want this for themselves or at least for their children ? JOHN P . STRAHL Corona del Mar * This is regarding the reduction in library services . Somewhere out there is the future president of the United States . He ' s 12 years old . The better educated he becomes the better for us . The better for the rest of the world . Curtailing the hours he can get_to the library or possibly closing the branch he can get_to is not the way to build his education . We deserve better than this . And so does the rest of the world .
