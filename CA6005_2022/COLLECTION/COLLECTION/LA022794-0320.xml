   <HEADLINE> PRIVATE BEACHFRONT OWNERS RULED NOT LIABLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Owners of private beachfront property are not liable for injuries suffered by people playing in the ocean near the property , an appellate_court has ruled . Affirming a lower court decision , the 4th District Court of Appeal last week said that &quot; owners of a private beach &quot; do not own or control the ocean and therefore &quot; are not responsible_for injuries that take_place in that ocean. &quot; The decision ends a four-year court battle for a couple in Cypress Pointe in San Clemente and a homeowners ' association . A lawsuit filed by Curtis Swann of Temecula , who was paralyzed from the neck down while attending a beach party , alleged that Paul and Madeline Olivier of Cypress Pointe , the Cyprus Shore Community Assn . and two other homeowners ' associations were liable for paying his medical_bills and unspecified damages for pain and suffering . Swann was a friend of a guest at a beach party when he was injured during the summer of 1990 . He brought the lawsuit against the Oliviers and the homeowners ' associations that allowed the beach party to take_place , charging them with failing to warn him of any beach hazards . Swann ' s lawsuit was dismissed by an Orange County Superior_Court judge , and he appealed the decision to the appellate_court . Madeline Olivier welcomed the latest decision . &quot; We ' ve had this case a very long_time , &quot; she said Friday . &quot; It ' s a decision that was needed to be made and needed to be clarified. &quot; Attorney Thomas G . Chambers , who represented the Oliviers , said the case initially involved Cyprus Shore , Cypress Pointe , and Cyprus Cove homeowner associations . &quot; These three different associations had created all these agreements for people crossing over on their property headed to the ocean , &quot; Chambers said . Cypress Pointe and Cyprus Cove were eventually dismissed as defendants . In its ruling , the appeals court said it could not hold the Oliviers and Cyprus Shore liable for the &quot; defective or dangerous condition of property which ( they ) did not own , possess , or control. &quot; The court pointed_out that Swann admitted that he was injured in the &quot; surf &quot; of a public beach near Cyprus Shore ' s private_property . &quot; The idea that the Cyprus Shore Community Assn . or Paul and Madeline Olivier can control the ocean adjacent to their land is nothing short of ludicrous , &quot; the appeals court said in its ruling . Swann could not be reached for comment .</TEXT>
