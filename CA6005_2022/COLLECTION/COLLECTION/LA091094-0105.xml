   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; DOW DROPS 33.65 POINTS ON SURGE IN WHOLESALE PRICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Renewed inflation fears gripped the financial markets Friday after a sharp jump in August wholesale prices , sending stock prices sharply lower and long-term bond yields to a two-month high . The news prompted piles of sell orders on Wall_Street and sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 33.65 points to close at 3 # 874.81. It was the biggest one-day decline since June 30 and put the best-known stock average barometer back to its levels of mid-August . For the week , the blue_chip average lost a modest 10.77 points . At one point in the afternoon , the Dow was down more_than 50 points , prompting automatic restrictions on high-volume computerized trading . A bounce in the last hour helped trim the losses . In the broader market , declining shares outnumbered advancers by 3 to 1 on New York Stock_Exchange volume of 294.32 million shares . In the Treasury_bond market , the bellwether 30-year bond , whose yield stood at 7.56 % on Thursday , closed at 7.70 % on Friday . It was the bond ' s highest yield since it shot_up to 7.73 % on July 11 , the peak of the Treasury bear_market that began in February . Its price , which falls when yields rise , dropped 1 5 / 8 points , or $ 16.25 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . The dollar fell against most major currencies , as investors worried that a new round of inflation would erode its buying power . In New York , the dollar closed at 99.20 Japanese yen from 99.50 on Thursday , and at 1.538 German marks from 1.556. The Labor_Department reported a surprisingly big 0.6 % jump in the producer_price_index , following a strong increase of 0.5 % in July . The increase &quot; very much supports the view &quot; that the Fed will raise short-term interest_rates again within the next few months to cool the economy and keep inflation from skyrocketing , said Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities in New York . The report &quot; was a cold shower , &quot; said Paul Kasriel , money_market economist at financial services giant Northern Trust Co . in Chicago . &quot; It certainly has sensitized the market to the view that maybe inflation is not going_to be quite as tame or move_up quite as gradually. &quot; Among the market highlights : * USAir Group Inc. ended off 1 / 2 to 6 1 / 8 . The crash of a USAir jetliner outside Pittsburgh could lead travelers to fly_on other airlines , analysts said . * Mercantile Stores jumped 7 5 / 8 to 54 1 / 2 , adding_to a gain of 6 5 / 8 on Thursday . It said it is in talks with a third_party , which it did not identify , regarding a possible merger . * Xyplex , which makes and supports high-performance data-communications networks , surged 9 1 / 2 to 27 3 / 4 after a $ 28-a-share takeover offer from Raytheon Co . * Transportation stocks were broadly lower . Federal Express fell 1 3 / 8 to 69 1 / 4 and trucking_company Roadway Services lost 1 to 60 3 / 4 on the Nasdaq . * Financial stocks , sensitive to interest_rates , were also among Friday ' s losing issues . Morgan Stanley declined 2 1 / 4 to 65 7 / 8 and Chase Manhattan Bank was down 1 to 36 1 / 4 . * Microsoft dropped 1 1 / 16 to 56 7 / 8 after an executive of the software company said it plans a 50 % increase in research and development spending , prompting some investors to fear profit erosion . * Qualcomm gained 1 7 / 16 to 24 11 / 16 . Shares of the maker of digital wireless communications gear rose for the second day after long-distance company Sprint said it will use Qualcomm ' s technology . * American Mobile Systems rose 1 / 2 to 11 after it reported that Nextel , a provider of mobile services , made a buyout offer equaling $ 10.80 per share . Meanwhile , stocks closed lower in foreign trading . London shares collapsed during the afternoon session , with the FTSE-100 average closing_down 40.7 points at 3 # 139.3. That was 83.4 lower from a week ago . In Frankfurt , the blue_chip DAX-30 average closed 12.78 points_up at 2 # 185.15. In Tokyo , the Nikkei-225 average closed_down 19.90 points at 19 # 897.88 , a fall of 755.95 points on the week . Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index finished down 6.81 points at 2 # 755.35 .</TEXT>
