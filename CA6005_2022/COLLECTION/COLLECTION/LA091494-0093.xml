   <HEADLINE> NEW CITY_COUNCIL CHAMBERS OPEN ; THOUSAND OAKS : LITTLE LEAGUERS ALSO HONORED AS CITY SHOWS OFF ITS ENERGY-EFFICIENT HEADQUARTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Inaugurating the new City_Council chambers with a broad grin , Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore slashed a ceremonial red ribbon on Tuesday evening and welcomed a crowd of looky-loos and Little Leaguers into the Civic Arts Plaza . &quot; This is a magnificent moment in the history of this city , &quot; Fiore said , &quot; a time when we can come_together to reflect on this extraordinary facility , which will be uplifting spirits for years into the future. &quot; To bursts of applause , Fiore introduced two Thousand Oaks Little_League teams : the 9- and 10-year-olds , who won the state championship this year , and the older Junior Division all-stars , who took the world title . The baseball_players , clad in their black-green-and-white uniforms , arrived_at the 2-day-old City_Hall shortly before the 5 p.m. ribbon-cutting ceremony after a triumphant motorcade through Thousand Oaks ' downtown corridor . Proudly , the players joined a throng of well-wishers in packing the council_chamber ' s 280 russet-colored seats to watch beaming politicians and bureaucrats ascend to the dais . The theatrical council_chamber doubles as a community auditorium ; the dais sinks into the basement on coiled_springs to be replaced by a parquet stage . After welcoming the crowd , Fiore rededicated 16 seats named for outstanding citizens of Thousand Oaks . Most of the seats were originally dedicated a decade ago , in the city ' s first government center at 401 Hillcrest Drive . &quot; It ' s an exciting moment for all_of us , &quot; Councilwoman Judy Lazar said . &quot; This is your facility . Please enjoy it and please come_down and use it all_the time. &quot; About a dozen county and state officials attended the ceremony , including California ' s First_Lady Gayle Wilson . When the hoopla died_down , Fiore accepted a rebate check from Southern California Edison worth $ 95 # 301 in recognition of energy-saving features built into the Civic Arts Plaza . Southern California Edison hands rebate checks to all home or business owners who incorporate energy-efficient equipment during new construction . Each state-of-the-art lighting system or air-conditioner is worth a certain dollar amount , and Edison will tally up the total and cut a check after construction is complete , said Division Manager Tom Bryson . The Edison rebate check will be credited to the Civic Arts Plaza ' s construction budget . Thousand Oaks ' $ 64-million Civic Arts Plaza incorporates the latest energy-saving insulation , lighting and window glazing , officials said . But the most unusual feature is the air-conditioning system . * During off-peak hours such_as nights and weekends , when energy prices are lower , the system works full blast to cool water in an underground storage_tank . This ice_water then circulates through the air-conditioner fans during daytime hours , saving the city big money . Edison estimates that the Civic Arts Plaza ' s various energy-saving devices will cut the annual bill by about one-fifth -- saving the city $ 61 # 000 a year . &quot; This building was built_in 1994 , so from glass and door seals to the insulation in the walls , everything about it is energy-conservation minded , &quot; agreed Bill Huston , who is supervising construction of the Civic Arts Plaza . Although the high-tech devices cost a little more , &quot; I ' m sure they ' ll make that up with their energy savings in five years or so , &quot; Huston said .</TEXT>
