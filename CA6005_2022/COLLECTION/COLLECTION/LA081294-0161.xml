   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY_RIGHTS ENSURED IN NEW SPECIES PROTECTION POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Interior_Department , hoping to defuse some of the criticism of the Endangered Species Act , assured landowners Thursday their property won ' t be placed at further risk if they agree to a formal species protection plan . Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he hoped the new policy will show that the federal law protecting endangered animal and plant species is flexible and should be supported . Congress has been debating whether to drastically rewrite the law , arguing that too often it protects species at the severe economic and social expense of human_beings . The law has also become the focus of a campaign to protect property_rights against government intrusion . The Interior_Department announced a new policy that any private party or group agreeing to protect endangered species through a Habitat Conservation Plan will be assured no additional property will be taken or costs incurred through the life of the plan . &quot; We ' re telling landowners that a deal is a deal , &quot; Babbitt said at a news_conference . He has been a strong proponent of dealing with endangered species issues by entering into agreements with private parties for broad protection of a species habitat , instead of protecting species individually wherever they are found . The department has been negotiating more_than 130 so-called Habitat Conservation Plans around the country . Often a stumbling_block in negotiations is the fear that the government will make new demands if the species continues in danger -- after an agreement has been made , officials said . It will affect the habitat of the California gnatcatcher and other species . Coastal sage scrub , the songbird ' s habitat , is found in Orange , Los Angeles , San Bernardino , San Diego and Riverside counties . Some development projects have been delayed for years because they would encroach on the bird ' s habitat . Defenders of Wildlife , a national conservation organization that has proposed both legal improvements and economic incentives under the Endangered Species Act , voiced strong concerns about the new policy . Defenders President Rodger Schlickeisen said , &quot; We understand the desire of developers to reach binding agreements on species protection , and the need to cautiously test new approaches . At the same time , however , if we give developers long-term deals on species ' plans , then we should also give wildlife an extra margin of error. &quot; He warned that &quot; because conservation biology is not yet an exact science , it is wise_to be safe rather than sorry when drafting species plans. &quot; Although environmental groups have not yet been briefed on the new habitat proposal , Defenders Wildlife Counsel William Snape found Thursday ' s policy announcement vague in several key respects . &quot; Not only is it unclear what ' extraordinary circumstances ' will require future mitigation by developers , but the very nature of such ' mitigation , ' and who will pay , is not yet defined , &quot; Snape said . Defenders has been a leader in promoting economic incentives for private landowners under the U.S. Endangered Species Act through a recent report and congressional testimony . On July 27 , senior representatives of the environmental community and the private sector met in Newport Beach to explore options for incorporating economic incentives into the California Endangered Species Act . The meeting , which was hosted by the Irvine Co . and jointly organized by Defenders of Wildlife and the National Audubon Society , was attended by various developers . The Interior_Department ' s new policy will provide legal assurance that the government will seek no additional land , or make any additional financial demands on the parties in the formal conservation plan for the life of the program . Habitat Conservation Plan agreements can vary in_length , but often run 20 to 30 years , officials said . The agreement normally calls_on private parties to set_aside areas for protection . In return , the government will allow commercial development of other areas . During the life of a Habitat Conservation Plan , Babbitt said , the government still will have available a variety of mitigation techniques to assure that a species is not irreparably harmed .</TEXT>
