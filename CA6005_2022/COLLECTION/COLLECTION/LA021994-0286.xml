   <HEADLINE> CHINA , BRITAIN , BELGIUM ACCEPT NUCLEAR WASTE DUMPING BAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A ban on nuclear waste dumping at_sea moved a step closer to reality Friday with news that China , Britain and Belgium would toe_the_line and accept the restrictions in a last-minute change of heart . All three , along with France and Russia , had abstained when 37 other countries agreed in November to ban dumping at_sea of low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste.Dumping of higher-level waste is already banned . France had recently said it would change policy and go_along with the ban , and the announcements in Britain , China and Belgium on Friday seemed to leave Russia in the lurch . In London , Agriculture Minister Gillian Shephard said in a statement released to Parliament that Britain still believes scientific evidence suggests that a ban is unnecessary but that it would bow to international feeling . In Brussels , an Environment Ministry official said Belgium had changed its mind and would accept the ban . The official New China News_Agency said Beijing would also fall_into line . The ban is being established under the terms of the London Convention on marine pollution and dumping , and the signatory countries that abstained in the November vote had until midnight Sunday to say whether they would toe_the_line . The new ban is to be reviewed internationally in 25 years , and Britain said it would reopen negotiations if the weight of opinion changed in favor of radioactive dumping . It is not legally binding on dissenting nations who are signatories to the London Convention . But they remain bound by its original ruling , approved in 1972 , which prohibits the dumping of higher-level radioactive waste .</TEXT>
