   <HEADLINE> U.S. TRADES IN ON ITS KNOW-HOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fears of an impending U.S.-Japanese trade war obscure it , and worrisome reports about America ' s global trade_gap may make_it hard to believe . But in the increasingly important arena of services -- from finance to electronic data to health_care to tourism -- the United States enjoys a growing , multibillion-dollar trade surplus with Japan and the rest of the world . The U.S. edge , which could exceed $ 50 billion when 1993 statistics are released next month , dramatically improves the picture of America ' s trade performance at a time when attention is fixed on frustrations with Japan . Moreover , it highlights U.S. strength in knowledge-intensive fields that are increasingly rewarded in the global marketplace and at the heart of continuing trade negotiations . &quot; People talk_about the trade_deficit , but it ' s like having your left shoe on and not your right shoe on &quot; when they omit services , said Margaret S . Wigglesworth , executive_director of the Coalition of Service_Industries in Washington . Mindful of the dramatic numbers , the Commerce_Department announced that starting next month , it will include services in its monthly trade summary for the first time . &quot; There ' s a danger that somebody ' s going_to come_along and say that the reason we ' re doing this is to make the trade numbers look better , &quot; said Larry Moran , a research economist at the Commerce_Department ' s Bureau of Economic Analysis . But the real reason for overhauling the widely followed monthly trade report , he said , is &quot; to give a better look_at our competitiveness in today ' s world -- which includes both goods and services. &quot; The United States ran a $ 100-billion trade_deficit in goods for the first nine months of 1993 , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis . That means Americans bought $ 100 billion more in goods from other countries than they sold to them . But toss_in the U.S. $ 43.2-billion services surplus for the same period and the picture is altered markedly : the $ 100-billion gap narrows to $ 56.8 billion . Japan alone accounted_for $ 43 billion of the U.S. deficit in goods traded_in that period , but U.S. service_industries managed to tote_up a $ 9.5-billion surplus with Japan despite ongoing disputes about insurance , banking and other services . The Japanese &quot; perceive the quality of our services more highly than they perceive the quality of our products , &quot; said Richard King , an international trade adviser in Los Angeles . While the statistics are quirky -- a European visitor ' s hotel_bill in San Diego counts as a U.S. export -- they nonetheless tell a story : &quot; Lo and behold -- yes , we ' re competitive , &quot; said Patrick T . Harker , director of a center_on the service sector at the University of Pennsylvania ' s Wharton School of Business . That competitive standing comes at a price . Firms in communications , insurance , banking and finance have dominated this year ' s layoff announcements as corporate America continues to slash costs in a quest_for greater productivity . &quot; Our airlines fly more people per employee , &quot; Harker said . &quot; Our financial_institutions have more accounts per employee than other institutions around the world. &quot; Until recently , international trade frictions centered_on things that come packed in crates and boxes , such_as factory products and farm commodities . But changes in the global economy have pushed the service sector -- often derided as the dreary world of hamburger flippers and minimum-wage cashiers -- into the international spotlight . For example : * U.S. demands that Japan open_up its insurance market -- the world ' s second largest -- to American firms helped torpedo recent U.S.-Japanese trade talks and sparked fears of a trade war . * Late last year , much-ballyhooed international negotiations in Geneva almost ground to a halt when France insisted on restricting imports of U.S. movies and television_programs . * The 117 nations involved in those talks also failed to agree on rules for financial services , an area of strong U.S. competitiveness . Future talks will cover expanding global issues in financial services , telecommunications , maritime services and other areas . &quot; It ' s a global game -- no question about it , &quot; said Isaac Shapiro , international coordinator at the New York-based Skadden , Arps law_firm , which has opened_up 12 foreign_offices since 1987 , when the firm expanded into Tokyo . But protectionist barriers continue to complicate the game , even as services trade expands . Japan , for instance , does not allow foreign law_firms to register in the country under their official name ( the managing partner ' s name is used ) or appear in court . Rules even limit the display of firm names on office doors . Foreign law_firms cannot even hire Japanese attorneys to do the local legal work that is off-limits to outsiders . Instead , those firms vie for much narrower opportunities , such_as advising Japanese clients on overseas business investments and financial transactions . The hiring restriction &quot; is our principal competitive disadvantage in Japan , &quot; Shapiro said during a telephone_interview from his firm ' s office in Paris . But many business_executives and economists say they view such barriers as temporary headaches on a path that is leading toward expanded opportunities throughout the world . In part , the U.S. 1992 global services surplus of $ 56 billion reflects the country ' s popularity with well-heeled foreign tourists . The money they dole_out for hotel_rooms , airline tickets , meals and assorted amusements is counted as a U.S. export -- and added_up to more_than a third of the nation ' s overall surplus , government figures show . Similarly , tuition paid by foreign students in U.S. colleges is reflected as a U.S. export . Education exports soared from $ 3.8 billion in 1987 to $ 6.1 billion in 1992 . Yet in other cases , U.S. know-how is the precious commodity for_sale overseas , offered by U.S. investment banks , advertising_agencies , architects , software writers , consultants and others . Exports of computer and data-processing services rocketed from $ 649 million to more_than $ 2 billion from 1987 to 1992 . Engineering , architecture and construction tell a similar tale . Overall , U.S. service exports soared 84 % in the same period . &quot; We don ' t go_to Japan for health_care . We don ' t go_to Japan for education , &quot; Wigglesworth said . &quot; The U.S. service sector is the most productive and competitive in the world. &quot; Some experts forecast that Japan ' s purchase of U.S. services will continue to grow in a variety of areas once that nation emerges from a painful recession . The U.S. services surplus with Japan jumped almost fourfold between 1987 and 1992 , to $ 12.6 billion from $ 3.2 billion . &quot; You ' re going to find American health_care management companies . . . moving_in to own and manage hospitals , &quot; predicted King , whose firm specializes in advising Asian and U.S. firms doing business overseas . Another promising area , he said , is entertainment technology . Los Angeles-based firms are already participating in such emerging fields as virtual_reality , a world of illusion created with the help of computers . The rising importance of services is not universally hailed . Many economists argue that manufacturing is more valuable to an economy than services because it fuels more job creation , including such services as transportation , retail , finance and design . But other economists say they believe that a globally competitive service sector should ultimately spawn many new job opportunities as today ' s cost-cutting mania subsides . &quot; Engineering , consulting , Americans designing buildings in other countries -- you ' re selling people ' s labor , &quot; said David Wyss , an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington , Mass . Services suffer from a bad rap , argued Harker , who directs the Fishman-Davidson Center for the Study of the Service Sector . Research suggests that service-sector wages are just a_few cents-an-hour below those in manufacturing , he said , if the vast retail sector is left_out of the calculation . &quot; The issue is skilled jobs and unskilled jobs , &quot; he said . &quot; Whether they ' re service or manufacturing really doesn ' t matter . How many poorly paid bankers do you know ? &quot;</TEXT>
