   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE FDA ; WHEN POLITICS DRIVES SCIENCE ; UNDER CLINTON , INTEREST_GROUPS WIN OUT OVER ADVANCEMENTS IN RESEARCH ON FOOD AND DRUG PRODUCTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When David Kessler became the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in 1991 , he found the agency to be ponderous and slow . Kessler promised dramatic changes , that he &quot; would teach the elephant to dance. &quot; And he has -- to a tune called by politicians . During my 15 years ' involvement with and observation of the FDA , which has spanned the administrations of four presidents , the agency has encountered different management styles and regulatory philosophies . But never was raw political influence permitted to dictate decisions on policy and products as in the Clinton_Administration . The regulatory process is no longer impartial and dependent_on law and science , but operates as if the issue were which interest_group deserves a reward . Last year , for example , when a new female condom was under review , the agency was reluctant to approve the product in_view of its controversial 26 % failure rate in normal use . Other contraceptives were much more effective : Male condoms had a failure rate less than half and hormonal methods less than one-tenth that of the new product . But the word came_down from the politicos in the Health and Human Services_Department that they wanted the product approved . Damn science and medicine , it had the support of feminists . Approval soon followed . Biotechnology policymaking and product review provide perhaps the most illuminating example of the rise of political influence at the agency . The FDA had a consistent and generally positive 15-year track record of regulating biotech . Since 1979 , there had been a conscious decision that scientific considerations would dictate regulation . Furthermore , the fairness , predictability and impartiality of the regulatory review process stimulated researchers , companies and investors to favor this industrial sector . As a result , more_than 1 # 000 new biotech products have been approved for marketing , including some genuine medical milestones for diseases ranging from cancer to cystic_fibrosis and multiple_sclerosis . Millions of patients have been treated with these safe and effective products , and hundreds more new products are in development . During the past 18 months , however , the FDA has shown an unmistakable change on biotech policy . New instructions from the Clinton_Administration have undermined the scientific paradigm that has been the basis for policymaking over the past 15 years : that new biotech techniques are extensions or refinements of earlier techniques and that the degree of regulatory scrutiny will be determined by risk . Signaling the reversal , the FDA has announced that it will soon require food manufacturers to notify the FDA before marketing foods manufactured with new biotech techniques -- high-precision recombinant_DNA or gene-splicing techniques -- while exempting those crafted with other , cruder techniques such_as hybridization or mutagenesis . With these moves , the agency appears to be seeking new regulatory dominions in spite of its cries of inadequate resources . Most certainly , the new policies will discourage the use of the newer , more precise techniques , denying consumers the choice of more nutritious , tasty and convenient products . These changes are reflections of a very different attitude about the relative roles of science and politics in policymaking . During the recently completed review of the milk-stimulating drug , bovine somatotropin , Kessler directed a vigorous search for reasons not to approve it . Now that BST has been approved ( reluctantly ) , the FDA is permitting stores that sell dairy_products to flout the agency ' s policy on labeling -- which has the effect of &quot; damaging &quot; BST ' s acceptability . Many food markets have signs_over the dairy case proclaiming &quot; NO BST. &quot; However , cows ' milk normally contains BST , a naturally occurring protein ; thus the label is inaccurate . The milk-containing products in the case could , therefore , be considered misbranded , a violation of federal law . Neither FDA nor any state agency has taken action . Other changes also reflect the new order . Since the 1992 elections , Kessler has eliminated the two policy offices having extensive involvement with the biotechnology industry , with veteran scientists ( including me ) swept aside . Direction on science policy ( and sometimes even on civil-service personnel matters ) is now provided by a political_commissar , Jerold Mande , a former Senate staffer of Vice_President Al Gore . At the FDA , which overseas food and health-care products accounting_for 25 cents of every consumer dollar -- more_than a_trillion dollars worth annually -- consumer protection and competition in the marketplace are increasingly at the mercy of politics and politicians . Is this any way to run a regulatory_agency whose job is to ensure that products are safe and that quacks cannot prey on the public ?</TEXT>
