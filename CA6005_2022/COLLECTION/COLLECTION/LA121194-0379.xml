   <HEADLINE> VALLEY BRIEFING : THE GOLDEN YEARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the 80 years since Universal Studios ' Carl Laemmle said , &quot; I hope I didn ' t make a mistake coming_out here , &quot; the motion_picture industry ' s migration to the Valley has proven successful , growing_into the Valley ' s top industry . Moviemaking ' s first moguls were lured west in the early 1900s by warm weather and the Valley ' s vast and varied terrain . Movies came_to the Valley to stay when Warner Bros . moved to Burbank in the 1920s . By 1940 , Disney had moved to Burbank and film production in the Valley rivaled that in Hollywood . The 1930s and ' 40s were the studios ' golden_age , a time of peak production and attendance . Here ' s a look_at the Valley ' s three largest studios . Warner Bros . Studioes By the time Warner Bros . moved to Burbank in 1929 , it had established itself as a leader in bringing sound to motion_pictures . The four brothers -- Harry , Albert , Sam , and Jack -- started in the film business in 1903 with a nickelodeon , gradually expanding into distribution and production . With &quot; The Jazz Singer , &quot; they made the first film with partial sound . Despite this early jump_on competitors , the studio ' s move to color film was slow and its biggest successes remained black-and-white film noir movies . The studio gained a reputation as a bare-bones , cost-cutting operation by making movies economically and quickly . Directors often produced as_many as five features a year . The Films Warner Bros . specialized in low-budget , fast-paced gangster sagas , dramas , comedies and musicals in the 1930s . Film costs ranged between $ 200 # 000 and $ 400 # 000 . &quot; The Public Enemy , &quot; for example , starring James Cagney , cost the studio $ 200 # 000 . 06 # 20 , 04 # 08 , 08 # 05 , 04 Types of Films 1935 1945 Action / Adventure 4 1 War 1 3 Documentary 1 Drama 16 4 Comedy 8 4 Musical 15 2 Crime 8 3 Western 1 1 Total 53 19 Annual Film Production : 1925 : 30 1935 : 53 1945 : 19 1955 : 21 1965 : 15 1975 : 18 Universal City Studios Universal founder Carl Laemmle , an immigrant clothing manufacturer , opened his first nickelodeon in Chicago in 1906 . By 1913 , Laemmle had three small studios in Hollywood and was looking_to expand . Laemmle purchased a 230-acre chicken ranch on the northeastern edge of the Cahuenga Pass for $ 165 # 000 , named it Universal City and opened the studio in 1915 . Equipped for both studio and exterior shooting , the site included a zoo with a variety of exotic animals and hundreds of horses and cows . A 300-by-500-foot main stage could accommodate up_to five productions at once . For 25 , visitors got a box lunch and , for the first time ever , were able to see movies made . The Films In the 1930s , Universal established itself as the king of horror films . Adventure films such_as the &quot; Flash Gordon &quot; series were also popular during the ' 30s . Universal produced big-hit movies such_as &quot; King of Jazz &quot; ( $ 1.65 million ) in 1930 as well as less expensive hits such_as &quot; Frankenstein &quot; ( $ 250 # 000 ) in 1931 . 06 # 20 , 04 # 08 , 08 # 05 , 04 Types of Films 1935 1945 Action / Adventure 9 8 War Fantasy 3 4 Drama 7 7 Comedy 3 4 Musical 1 7 Crime 10 10 Western 7 10 Total 40 50 Annual Film Production : 1925 : 51 1935 : 40 1945 : 50 1955 : 31 1965 : 21 1975 : 7 Universal highlights and finances Universal turned_out a large_number of films in the 1920s , but was slow to change_over to sound . Hard-hit by the Depression , the studio lost money throughout the 1930s . Stars such_as musical performer Deanna Burbin and comedy duo Abbott &amp; Costello helped boost profits . Annual profits or losses in millions of dollars : 1927 : $ 1.5 1928 : $ 1.1 1929 : $ 0.5 ( Carl Laemmle Jr . become head of production ) 1930 : $ -1.8 ( &quot; All Quiet on the Western Front &quot; wins best picture Oscar ) 1931 : $ 0.6 ( &quot; Dracula &quot; is released , followed by &quot; Frankenstein &quot; ) 1932 : $ -1.2 ( Boris Karloff stars in &quot; The Mummy &quot; ) 1933 $ -1.0 1934 : $ -0.2 1935 : $ -0.7 ( Two expensive movies flop : &quot; Showboat , &quot; &quot; Sutter ' s Gold &quot; ) 1936 : $ -1.6 ( Carl Laemmle Sr . sells_out his interest in Universal ) 1937 : $ -1.0 ( First Deanna Durbin picture , &quot; One Hundred Men and a Girl &quot; ) 1938 : $ -0.4 1939 : $ 1.0 1940 : $ 2.2 ( First Abbott &amp; Costello film is released ) 1941 : $ 2.3 ( &quot; The Wolf Man &quot; is released ) 1942 : $ 3.0 ( Abbott &amp; Costello become studio ' s top box_office stars ) 1943 : $ 3.8 1944 : $ 3.4 1945 : $ 3.9 1946 : $ 4.6 ( Universal merges with International Pictures ) 1947 : $ 3.2 ( Universal hit of the decade &quot; The Egg and I &quot; is released ) 1948 : $ -3.2 1949 : - $ 1.1 Warner Bros . highlights and finances Warner Bros . enjoyed skyrocketing profits from its early talkies in the late 1920s . But its finances suffered from the Depression in the early ' 30s and recovery was slow . Its profit_margin was about $ 10 # 000 per picture in 1935 . Booming attendance boosted profits again in the mid-40s . Annual profits or losses in millions of dollars : 1927 : ( &quot; The Jazz Singer &quot; starring Al Jolson is released ) 1928 : $ 2.0 1929 : $ 14.5 ( Purchases First National and moves to Burbank ) 1930 : $ 7.1 1931 : $ -7.9 1932 : $ -14.1 1933 : $ -6.3 1934 : - $ 2.5 1935 : $ 0.7 ( $ 1-million expansion adds nine stages , 50 buildings ) 1936 : $ 3.2 ( 110 acres added_to lot , bringing total to 188 ) 1937 : $ 5.9 1938 : $ 1.9 ( &quot; Jezebel &quot; and &quot; The Adventures of Robin_Hood &quot; released ) 1939 : $ 1.7 ( Bette Davis becomes No . 1 female star ) 1940 : $ 2.7 ( First Humphrey Bogart film noir is released , &quot; High Sierra &quot; ) 1941 : $ 5.4 ( &quot; Sergeant York &quot; is the studio ' s biggest hit of the decade ) 1942 : $ 8.6 1943 : $ 8.2 ( &quot; Casablanca &quot; wins studio ' s second_best picture Oscar ) 1944 : $ 7.0 ( &quot; To Have and Have Not &quot; is released ) 1945 : $ 9.9 ( Joan Crawford stars in &quot; Mildred Pierce &quot; ) 1946 : $ 19.4 1947 : $ 22.1 1948 : $ 11.8 1949 : $ 10.5 * In late 1941 , Warner Bros . purchased the play &quot; Everybody Comes_to Rick ' s &quot; for $ 20 # 000 . After a title change , rewriting and juggling of lead actor , &quot; Casablanca &quot; began filming in May , 1943 , without a finished script . Rewriting continued through shooting , which was completed in 59 days at a cost of $ 950 # 000 . &quot; Casablanca &quot; was filmed almost entirely on the studio ' s backlot , transformed into French Morocco . The backlot ' s &quot; French Street &quot; provided the setting for the Paris flashback sequence , a setting still used in films . Only one scene was filmed off the lot -- the arrival of Maj . Strasser at Casablanca ' s airport was filmed at the old Metropolitan Airport in Van Nuys . The concluding airport segment was filmed on Stage One at the studio . Walt Disney Studios The Disney studio was an influential part of the migration of the motion_picture industry to Burbank , even though it wasn ' t considered a major studio typical of the golden years . Before moving to Burbank , Disney ' s Hollywood studio produced cartoons and animated characters that became ' star ' in their own_right . When the company outgrew its Hollywood site , Walt Disney purchased a 51-acre lot in Burbank in 1939 , where he built a $ 1-million studio . The studio resembled a campus more_than other studios , which had high walls and sound stages . Yet it was_on that ' campus ' that many animation techniques were pioneered .
