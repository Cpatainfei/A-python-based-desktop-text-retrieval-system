   <HEADLINE> REFERENDUM TO RAISE STUDENT FEES COULD DECIDE FATE OF CSUN ATHLETICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bob Rowell , who has experience in this sort of thing , sends his regards_to Cal State Northridge . Maybe he should send a rabbit ' s foot instead . Rowell , an assistant athletic director at rival Cal Poly San Luis Obispo , recently weathered a campus election in which funding was the political football . Students approved a substantial fee increase to support athletics . Northridge on Tuesday and Wednesday is conducting a similar election that could chart the school ' s athletic course well into the next century . &quot; I hope it passes , &quot; Rowell said . &quot; It sure helped us. &quot; Northridge students will be asked to vote on a referendum that , if passed , would increase fees from $ 4 to $ 49 per semester or $ 98 annually . If the proposition fails , Northridge , after five seasons in NCAA Division I , might be forced to eliminates several men ' s programs and revert to Division II . The Northridge athletic department anticipates the loss in 1995-96 of roughly $ 700 # 000 from a budget that this year stands at $ 3.6 million . The football_team faces elimination and scholarships will be lost in many sports . The referendum would leave Northridge students with an annual registration fee of roughly $ 2 # 014 , which would rank third on the 1994-95 list of the 20 schools in the Cal State University system . Cal State San Marcos , the newest school in the chain , is the least expensive at $ 1 # 700 . Yet comparing athletic budgets and sources of revenue can be a tricky proposition . Dollars and cents at one campus are apples and oranges at another . Schools might share CSU membership , but each has a different way of paying_for sports programs . &quot; One thing that you don ' t have a measure of is that Northridge is one of the newer institutions ( in Division I ) , &quot; said Bob Hiegert , Northridge ' s athletic director . &quot; San Diego State , Fresno and others have played_at that level for some time and have facilities and support groups in place . &quot; We ' re playing catch-up. &quot; The catch for students , of course , is the price_tag . CSU students subsidize athletics through membership fees paid to the Associated Students or a program called Instructionally Related Activities , which funds dozens of extracurricular programs from student registration fees . Dollar totals can vary significantly in each category . Students at three CSU schools pay $ 10 annually to IRA ; the fee at another is $ 200 . Athletic programs often receive a percentage of the pie from each account . CSU schools augment their athletic budgets through a variety of formulas . For example : * CS Northridge ( $ 3.6 million budget ) : Northridge has the sixth-highest registration total in the system at $ 1 # 916 annually , which includes $ 96 in combined IRA ( $ 30 ) and Associated Students ( $ 66 ) fees . The average charged to CSU students in 1994-95 is $ 42 in IRA and $ 49 from Associated Students , or $ 91 combined . If the referendum passes , combined AS and IRA fees at Northridge will increase from $ 96 to $ 194 per student . Admission to athletics events would remain free to students . The current annual cut for Northridge athletics is $ 8 per student from AS and $ 17 from IRA . * Cal Poly SLO ( $ 4 million budget ) : The Mustangs are in the third of a four-year plan in which IRA fees are being raised incrementally to fund sports . This year the IRA fee has been raised to $ 135 , the second-highest total in the CSU . The total Associated Students charge annually is $ 50 per student for a total of $ 185 , also the second-highest in the system . Each quarter , the AS chips_in $ 4 and IRA adds $ 43 per student to athletics . There is no admission_charge at athletic events for students . * Fresno State ( $ 10.8 million budget ) : Perhaps the most-successful program in the CSU , Bulldog athletics have received no money this year from the Associated Students or IRA coffers . Students pay $ 52 in combined IRA and AS fees annually . The Associated Students stopped funding athletics in 1981 . Students nonetheless pay_for athletics through other means . At Fresno , though , it ' s more of a user-fee process . Students must purchase a $ 90 season pass for the 1994-95 men ' s basketball_season . Student tickets to individual games in basketball are unavailable . Student tickets for this week ' s home football game against Wyoming are $ 9 . * San Diego State ( $ 9.75 million ) : The second-most prominent athletic program in the CSU receives no money from the Associated Students . The Aztec athletic department gets $ 17 annually per student in IRA fees . Students pay $ 60 in combined IRA and AS fees and are admitted free to athletic events . * Long_Beach State ( $ 4.2 million ) : Last spring , Long_Beach students passed a referendum increasing IRA charges from $ 25 annually to $ 50 . It takes_effect in 1995-96 and will raise combined IRA and AS fees to $ 84 annually . Athletics received $ 15 per student in IRA fees this year and nothing from AS fees . Admission for students to athletic events is free . * Sonoma State ( $ 1.1 million ) : Last spring , students at the non-scholarship Division II school passed a referendum in which yearly IRA fees were hiked to $ 200 per student , well above the CSU average of $ 42 . Athletics receives $ 150 per student . It was the largest IRA increase in CSU history . However , Sonoma State does not receive funding from the Associated Students . Admission for students is free . No surprise here : As a result of the IRA charge , Sonoma State ' s registration fee of $ 2 # 070 -- which includes $ 274 in combined IRA and AS fees -- for 1994-95 is the highest in the CSU . * CS Sacramento ( $ 2.5 million ) : Sacramento , which plays in the same conference with Northridge in many sports , receives $ 5.50 per student annually from IRA and $ 5 from Associated Students . Students pay $ 96 in combined IRA and AS fees , and student admission to athletic events is free . * CS Dominguez Hills ( $ 750 # 000 ) : The Dominguez Hills athletics department , which competes in Division II and does not field a football_team , receives $ 9 annually per student from the Associated Students and $ 5.50 in IRA fees . The combined IRA and AS fees are $ 45 per student . Students are not charged for athletic events . Demographics and geography play an indisputable role in the referendum process . In the fall of 1991 , Cal Poly asked students to help bankroll a move from Division II to Division I . Turnout was the largest for any election in school history . &quot; It was a popular topic , &quot; Rowell said . Of the 17 # 000 students enrolled at the time , 10 # 000 cast votes , he said . &quot; Passed_by 400 votes , &quot; Rowell said . Northridge , with an enrollment of 24 # 000 that includes thousands of older students who commute to the school and do not attend games , doesn ' t anticipate the same response at the polls . A similar Northridge referendum in the spring lost by a 993-906 margin . Northridge and Cal Poly are in the CSU and both play in the American West Conference . Beyond that , the schools are located on different planes . &quot; I don ' t know that Northridge is in the same kind of situation , &quot; Rowell said . &quot; They ' re a commuter school and our students generally live here. &quot; It ' s just a hunch , but Rowell figures the Northridge referendum has a good chance of passing . Maybe CSU schools aren ' t so different after all , he said . &quot; Athletics is an important part of what we do ( as schools ) , &quot; Rowell said . &quot; I think people there will realize that too. &quot; California State University Selected Student Fees for 1994-95 04 # 17 , 06 # 06 , 18 University IRA * AS + Registration Fee Dominguez Hills $ 10 $ 35 $ 1 # 791 Fresno $ 20 $ 32 $ 1 # 798 Long_Beach $ 25 $ 34 $ 1 # 749 Northridge $ 30 $ 66x $ 1 # 916 Sacramento $ 16 $ 76 $ 1 # 860 San Diego $ 30 $ 30 $ 1 # 902 San Francisco $ 70 $ 84 $ 1 # 978 San Jose $ 40 $ 64 $ 1 # 966 Cal Poly SLO $ 135 $ 50 $ 2 # 027 Sonoma $ 200 $ 74 $ 2 # 070 CSU Average $ 42 $ 49 $ 1 # 853 Source : CSU Chancellor ' s Office * Instruction Related Activities + Associated Students organization x Would increase $ 98 if referendum passes Note : Fees represent total annual charge to students in these categories--athletics receives a percentage of the amount in many cases .
