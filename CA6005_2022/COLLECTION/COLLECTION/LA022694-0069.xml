   <HEADLINE> MASSACRE IN THE MIDEAST ; KILLINGS HARDEN OPPONENTS OF PEACE ; REACTION : PROTESTS AGAINST TALKS WITH ISRAEL ERUPT THROUGHOUT ARAB WORLD . PLO DEMANDS A DISARMING OF ISRAELI SETTLERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Arab world , already ambivalent about making_peace with Israel , struggled Friday to absorb the consequences of the massacre of 48 Palestinian worshipers in a mosque in the Israeli-occupied West_Bank . The Palestine Liberation Organization demanded an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security_Council and a move to disarm Israeli settlers , while thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets of a Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan shouting , &quot; No to peace and yes to the gun. &quot; A British tourist was stabbed in the Jordanian capital , Amman , by a Palestinian who apparently was enraged by news of the Hebron killings , an official said . The 77-year-old tourist was reported in stable condition . In Egypt , riot police deployed unobtrusively during midday prayers as an apparent precautionary move . In Libya , television and radio_stations broke from normal programming and broadcast somber music and readings from the Koran . Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi called the massacre &quot; a horrible , terroristic crime . . . officially planned by the Israeli government. &quot; PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , already battling a widening tide of opposition to his peace agreement with Israel , found himself facing a new storm of demands for an end to the peace talks even as he agreed to send a delegation to Washington for stepped-up negotiations . &quot; What kind of peace are you talking_about , if the crimes and killings against our people do not stop ? &quot; Arafat asked . &quot; This will have a serious impact , not just on the negotiations , but on all aspects and at all levels. &quot; In addition to calling_for an emergency session of the U.N. Security_Council , PLO officials renewed their call_for international troops to be deployed in the Israeli-occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip to protect the 1.5 million Palestinians living there . They also called_on Israel to disarm Jewish settlers in occupied Arab lands . &quot; During the past negotiations , the Israeli side was stressing the Israeli security requirements , &quot; said Yasser Abed-Rabbo , head of the PLO ' s information department . &quot; This massacre has proved that security is a Palestinian need mainly , and for this reason , without having real guarantees for the security of the Palestinian people , I don ' t think the resumption of the talks , even in Washington , will lead to a successful result. &quot; Abed-Rabbo , a member of the PLO Executive Committee , said the attack &quot; powerfully demonstrates the need to dismantle Israeli settlements in the occupied territories , to evict and disarm the settlers , remove the army from populated areas and provide international protection. &quot; The PLO in its talks with Israel has proposed the deployment of international troops , a suggestion the Israelis have rejected outright . It has also sought implementation of Security_Council resolutions against Jewish settlements in occupied lands . In Cairo , Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa backed the PLO ' s demand for a Security_Council session and added : &quot; This horrendous incident confirms the need for confronting extremism , which has hit many societies. &quot; Moussa , who has acted_as a mediator during the last several rounds of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis , added that the incident demonstrated that security is a need for Palestinians &quot; and not that of Israel alone. &quot; The Arab League , which has been asked by the PLO to convene an emergency session of its foreign_ministers , also backed the PLO ' s demand for international intervention . Arab League Secretary_General Esmat Abdel Meguid said the league &quot; holds Israel totally responsible_for the souls who were killed this morning. &quot; &quot; This incident confirms once again the settlers ' indifference to the law and the Israeli authorities ' disregard of the settlers ' crimes , which leads to dangerous escalation and threatens the peace process , &quot; Meguid said . Arafat went_into session with his top advisers Friday night and indicated that he would decide how quickly to send a peace delegation to Washington after gauging the response of the international community and of Israel . Arafat responded positively to President Clinton ' s invitation to resume peace talks in Washington even as_many of his top advisers were expressing doubts about the wisdom of pushing_forward with the peace process , which in recent months has drawn widening opposition in Palestinian circles as the gains at the negotiating table have dwindled . The incident appears sure to deal a strong card to Arafat ' s opponents , who have called_for toppling the PLO chairman and violently undercutting the peace talks . The Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas called_on Arafat to &quot; annul the peace process with the Zionists and instead engage in holy war against the Jews. &quot; A coalition of Damascus-based radical groups that have opposed the Sept . 13 Declaration of Principles signed between Israel and the PLO issued a joint statement in Lebanon vowing revenge . &quot; We will retaliate with all our means and will redouble our struggle to undermine the accord of treason and topple Arafat , who has sold himself to the Zionists , &quot; they said . Iran also weighed in , declaring on Tehran Radio that &quot; without doubt , this crime took_place with the cooperation of the military_forces of the Zionist regime. &quot;</TEXT>
