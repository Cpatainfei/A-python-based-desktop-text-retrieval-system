   <HEADLINE> CRIME DECREASED 5 % IN THOUSAND OAKS IN ' 93 ; STATISTICS : FBI FIGURES COME AS GOOD NEWS TO CITY OFFICIALS , WHO WARN THAT THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE REMAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite a slight increase in homicides , overall crime in Thousand Oaks fell by 5 % in 1993 , new statistics released Tuesday show . A total of 3 # 276 offenses ranging from arson to larceny to murder occurred within the city_limits last year , according to FBI figures released by state Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren . During the previous year , 3 # 447 crimes were recorded . The figures were heralded as good news by city officials , who nevertheless said they have a long way to go_in reducing the threat of violent crime . &quot; Yes , we are pleased , &quot; City Councilwoman Judy Lazar said . &quot; But yes , we would like to see even better statistics . I don ' t think anyone who lives here would say it ' s as safe as it was 10 , 20 or 30 years ago. &quot; Said Mayor Elois Zeanah : &quot; We all want to see a drop_in our total crime , and I ' m pleased that there is a 5 % drop . However , we have got_to make_sure we stem our wave of violent crime and make_sure it is not a trend. &quot; Ventura County Sheriff ' s Cmdr . Kathy Kemp , who oversees the department ' s policing of Thousand Oaks , said that while the overall drop was encouraging , more needs to be done to curb violent crime . &quot; That is our challenge , &quot; Kemp said . &quot; We are having some successes in reducing property crimes , but violent crimes are a continuing concern. &quot; Kemp said the city has a special problem because of its proximity to the Ventura Freeway and easy access by youths driving_in from Los Angeles . The attorney_general ' s statistics showed , however , that violent crime -- including homicide , rape , robbery and aggravated assault -- dropped an overall 15.6 % last year contrasted with 1992 . The total number of violent crimes reached 341 last year , contrasted with 404 the previous year . Robberies were down 17.7 % , and aggravated assaults dropped 18.2 % , according to the attorney_general ' s office . The number of murders increased from one in 1992 to three last year . Although that figure is still small by comparison with other major California cities , the homicides &quot; were all shocking for us , &quot; Lazar said . &quot; When you don ' t have very many , they all stand out. &quot; Zeanah said the city is taking steps to address crime and is holding a series of town_hall meetings that she described as &quot; brainstorming sessions &quot; on the topic . On May 7 , city leaders will hold a symposium to air ideas and come_up with solutions for how to reduce crime . Chief among their concerns , Zeanah said , are encouraging youngsters to steer away from gangs , educating parents about instructing children on right from wrong , and offering job training and career opportunities to idle youths . &quot; We ' ve got_to find ways to enforce our family values and protect our community , &quot; Zeanah said . &quot; Parents must take more responsibility in conflict resolution and teaching children how to handle their anger . &quot; Teen violence is a real concern in our city right now , &quot; she said , adding that she has seen increases in graffiti-tagging and vandalism . &quot; While our city compares well with other cities , it ' s still more_than what we are willing to put_up with. &quot; The Thousand Oaks figures were the first released for any of the five cities patrolled by the Sheriff ' s Department . The sheriff is expected to release Moorpark ' s figures today and those for Camarillo , Fillmore and Ojai within the next week . The five Ventura County cities with their own police_departments -- Ventura , Oxnard , Simi Valley , Port Hueneme and Santa Paula -- issued annual reports on 1993 crime in January . Reported crime was down in each . Times staff writer Daryl Kelley contributed to this story .
