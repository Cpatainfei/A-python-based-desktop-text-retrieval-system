   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY ; MOTHER MARIA ' S DAILY MIRACLE ; CARING FOR 6 CHILDREN , 3 OF THEM DISABLED , IS A BIG TASK BUT ONE SHE DOES WITH A SMILE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After gently bathing her two young daughters , Maria Romero lays them both on the bed they share , wraps their little bodies in fluffy towels and begins to comb_out their black , shiny hair . The 42-year-old mother of six braids the girls ' hair into precise plaits , laughing while tickling Milagros , 5 , and Guadalupe , 3 . She ' s gotten this process of bathing , dressing and grooming both girls down to 30 minutes , she says with a smile . She hoists up Milagros -- the &quot; miracle &quot; -- and straps her into a tiny wheelchair with a pink &quot; Little Mermaid &quot; backpack . Her younger daughter goes_in an even smaller wheelchair . In the kitchen , each girl must be fed by hand ; then Maria brings_out cups of milk mixed with dried baby food and carefully sets_up tubes and syringes to let the liquid drip down their throats . While his sisters are being fed , Manuel , 17 , the eldest Romero child , sits in his wheelchair at the kitchen_table silently playing solitaire on his computer . Maria will feed him later , laying him flat on his back , inserting a plastic tube into his mouth and monitoring the blended food , making_sure it doesn ' t go_into his lungs . Tending to six children would be a tiring task under any circumstances , but when three of them are severely disabled , the job becomes monumental . Maria Romero wakes close to dawn each morning and doesn ' t get_to bed until close to 11 p.m. , while her husband , Jose , 39 , works long hours as a truck_driver . Normally simple tasks , such_as dressing and bathing children , become demanding chores when those children cannot step into pants or sit_up in the tub . Feedings require scrupulous attention when a slight error could mean choking . Many times , taking a short trip has meant that Maria must hoist a 200-pound wheelchair into a van . Yet , armed only with an elementary_school education and with her abiding love for her children , Maria not only does these things , but does them cheerfully and with meticulous care . Maria &quot; is one of the most wonderful mothers I have ever met , &quot; said Dr. Irene Gilgoff , the children ' s physician . &quot; These children all have swallowing problems . None has ever been ill . She feeds them with the most loving care . I ' ve never met a mother quite like her . She ' s absolutely wonderful . She always has a smile. &quot; Manuel , Milagros and Guadalupe are afflicted with congenital myopathy , a rare , genetic form of muscular_dystrophy that confines them to wheelchairs . The Romeros ' other children , Gerardo , 13 , Jose Jr. , 11 , and Daniel , 6 , are completely healthy . * Children affected by congenital myopathies are born very weak , Gilgoff said . They are often unable to swallow or to eat effectively . The disease is not progressive , Gilgoff said ; the children ' s disabilities will not worsen and they have a normal life_expectancy . Nor is their intellect or development affected , and Manuel has proven himself a sharp student . Manuel , who is weaker than his sisters , is especially at risk for pneumonia . Still , he has never been_sick because of his parents ' conscientious care , the pediatrician said . In the living room of the family ' s modest three-bedroom home on Elliot Avenue in El Monte , photographs of the six Romero children line the walls . In the corner stands a glass case full of trophies , testimony to the younger boys ' sports talent . Daniel , Jose Jr . and especially Gerardo help their mother by baby-sitting or feeding their sisters . Just playing with them is enough to give Maria a break . &quot; It ' s hard sometimes but it doesn ' t bother me , &quot; said Gerardo , an avid baseball and football_player . &quot; We have to do our best . There ' s nothing else we can do. &quot; Finances make the situation more difficult . Although the family has medical insurance through Jose ' s $ 11.30-an-hour job , his plan does not cover many expenses . Like the children ' s feeding tubes and syringes . The tubes cost $ 2 each ; the syringes $ 5 each , Maria said . The tubes and syringes are supposed to be used once and then thrown_away ; Maria washes the plastic instruments out with hot water and uses them repeatedly . * Maria and Jose often have had to deny their other children the things they want . Gerard , Jose Jr . and Daniel have asked_for expensive cereals or Reeboks , but they get the cheaper brands . &quot; Sometimes they mind , &quot; she said . &quot; They ask , ' Why ? Why ? ' and I tell them because it ' s the only thing we can afford. &quot; Jose owns his own home and two small houses that sit on the same lot . One of Maria ' s six sisters lives in the front house and helps Maria take_care of the children . &quot; It ' s hard but she ' s always happy , &quot; said the sister , Antonia Abarca . &quot; She never gets sad. &quot; Manuel and the girls share a room in the family ' s cluttered but clean_house . The three boys share another room , Jose and Maria the third . On Manuel ' s side of the room , a Cindy Crawford poster , a Frederick ' s of Hollywood lingerie calendar and a poster of a white sports_car are pasted to the walls . Numerous religious objects -- crucifixes , rosary beads and pictures of saints -- are attached_to the white walls . The family receives aid from the state_Department of Rehabilitation and California Children ' s Services , a state-run organization that provides assistance in obtaining equipment . Still , it ' s tough . With six children to feed , Maria spends from $ 110 to $ 120 a week on groceries . &quot; We don ' t go anyplace . We just stay home , &quot; Maria said . &quot; Sometimes we go_to the park. &quot; When the family does venture out_to the park , other children stare at the procession of wheelchairs . &quot; They say , ' Look . Look , ' &quot; Maria said . &quot; But I just ask them if they want to play with my girls. &quot; The Romeros also often go_to relatives ' homes for parties . &quot; All my family knows I ' m happy with ( my children ) , &quot; Maria said . Jose recently saved enough money to buy a $ 17 # 000 van . In July , the family received an electric wheelchair lift , worth about $ 4 # 500 . The lift was donated to the family through the efforts of El Monte Police_Officer Don Johnston , who became a paraplegic after being shot in the line_of_duty in 1990 . Johnston , a helicopter spotter for the police_department , had been featured in an advertising_campaign for Ricon Corp. , a Pacoima-based manufacturer of wheelchair lifts , called &quot; Everyday Heroes. &quot; The company gave him a lift because of his participation in the campaign , but he already had one and rather than accept the new one or ask_for something else , he chose to donate it to a family in need . The Romeros certainly qualified . Maria was lifting the kids and their wheelchairs into their old van ; Manuel ' s electric wheelchair alone weighs about 200 pounds . Johnston found_out about the Romero family because he is the &quot; Adopt-a-Cop &quot; for Byron E . Thompson School for the Orthopedically Handicapped , the school that Guadalupe and Milagros attend . The school serves students ages 3 to 15 who have special needs from 15 school districts , said principal Frank Greenwood . Manuel attended Thompson School until he was 15 . He then went_to Bassett High_School in La Puente , where he graduated with honors in June . Next week , Manuel will begin attending Cal State Fullerton on a full scholarship . He will study computer_science . The family is working_on getting Manuel transportation to the university and once at the school he will have a full-time attendant to help him in his classes . Students at Thompson School are noted for their musical_group , the Handbell Choir . When he was a student at the school , Manuel did not have enough muscle control to hold onto a bell and participate , said Lesley Wheatley assistant principal and a teacher at the school who has known Manuel since he was 3 . &quot; Manuel would sit and listen to us play , &quot; Wheatley said . &quot; Then one day he came_in with a little keyboard and started playing with one finger all_of the songs that we had been playing. &quot; The class was stunned , Wheatley said , and from that point on Manuel would accompany the choir on his keyboard . Manuel &quot; is very bright , very gifted in computers and has a great sense_of_humor , &quot; Wheatley said . Manuel ' s condition prevents him from being able to talk distinctively and his jaw , like those of his sisters , hangs open . But he operates a computer that talks . * The children ' s condition gives them the appearance that they are sad , principal Greenwood said . But they ' re really not . In fact , Milagros and Guadalupe both seem to be happy children , often picking on their brothers and laughing with their mother . When Maria jokingly asks &quot; Who ' s a crybaby ? &quot; Milagros says &quot; Danny , &quot; referring to her 6-year-old brother . Candy Murakami , Milagros ' teacher , said the 5-year-old girl seems to enjoy class activities , such_as music , math and reading . &quot; Milagros is very headstrong and determined , &quot; assistant principal Wheatley said . &quot; that ' s going_to get her far. &quot; Guadalupe just started at the school . Maria and Jose amaze neighbors , teachers and friends with their cheerful attitudes and the affectionate , bubbling environment they have created in their home for all six of their children . People ask how she does_it , Maria said . &quot; I say I do_it because they ' re my kids and I love them . I love them a lot . I give all my time to them and I ' m happy. &quot; &quot; I never feel sad , &quot; Maria said , playing with her daughters on the living room floor . &quot; I don ' t have time to get sad. &quot; that ' s not exactly true . At other times , Maria concedes that from time to time she would get angry at God , but not for very long . &quot; At night , when everyone is asleep , I sometimes cry_for a little while , &quot; she said . But she added that she wakes_up the next morning and gets_on_with her tasks . Jose and Maria first noticed something unusual about their first son four months after he was born . &quot; He appeared to be weak and was emitting lots of saliva , &quot; Maria said . &quot; He was congested and doctors referred him to Rancho Los Amigos Medical_Center in Downey. &quot; The diagnosis : congenital myopathy , a non-progressive weakness of the muscles that may or may_not be genetic . The doctors could not tell the Romeros what caused the condition or whether any other children the couple wanted to have would be afflicted with the disease . Maria worried her way through her next three pregnancies . &quot; It was so scary , &quot; she said . &quot; I couldn ' t sleep at night. &quot; Her three boys were all born without the condition . But the couple wanted a daughter . So when Maria became pregnant with the couple ' s fifth child and an amniocentesis revealed the baby was a girl , the Romeros were elated . They decided to name her &quot; Milagros , &quot; Spanish for &quot; miracle. &quot; But they soon noticed something familiar about their first daughter . Like Manuel , Milagros was afflicted with congenital myopathy , as Guadalupe , the youngest of the Romero children , would be when she was born two years later . It ' s often a hard life , family members admit . But they don ' t spend time or energy on self-pity or wishing things were different . &quot; These children are never treated like they ' re not capable of doing anything , &quot; Gilgoff , their physician , said . &quot; They ' re very disabled but she ' s never treated them like anything but another child. &quot; Maria has expectations for her children , Gilgoff said . She has helped Manuel graduate from high_school and has worked to get him special devices , such_as a computer with a voice_box that allows him to communicate . When asked her hopes for her children , Maria said , &quot; That they never get sick , never get sick . I like them the way they are. &quot;</TEXT>
