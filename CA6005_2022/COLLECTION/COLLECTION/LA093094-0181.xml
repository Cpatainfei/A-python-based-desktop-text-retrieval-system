   <HEADLINE> VICTORY OVER POLIO DECLARED IN AMERICAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Polio -- the dreaded scourge that killed or paralyzed millions of children in the world and caused near-hysteria among U.S. parents earlier in the century -- has been eradicated from the Western_Hemisphere , the World_Health_Organization declared Thursday . This achievement &quot; should be a source of pride to all_of us and it shows what can be done when everybody works together for a common cause for the benefit of mankind , &quot; said Dr. Carlyle Guerra de Macedo , director of the Pan American Health Organization , which is the Western_Hemisphere office of WHO . &quot; Let us now hope that the example set_in the Americas is followed by the rest of the world , so that after the year 2000 no child will ever again fall victim to this dreadful disease , &quot; he added , speaking at a press_conference . Pan American Health officials attributed the success to an aggressive and widespread $ 540-million immunization campaign launched in the region in 1985 . The last documented case of polio in the Americas was recorded in 1991 in Pichanaki , a village in Peru . A 3-year-old boy was afflicted . The last case in the United States occurred in 1979 , according to Pan American Health . But 120 # 000 cases still occur annually in other parts of the world , most of them &quot; in the poorest and most politically unstable areas , &quot; officials of the organization said in a statement . The disease largely has declined worldwide , with the Eastern Mediterranean region the sole exception , where a 24 % increase was reported in 1993 , particularly in Pakistan and the Sudan , Pan American Health said . China , which reported epidemics of more_than 5 # 000 in 1989 and 1990 , has mounted a major immunization program . In 1993 , Europe recorded 187 cases , of which 161 occurred in nine of the newly independent states of the former Soviet_Union . Poliomyelitis , or infantile_paralysis , is an infectious_disease caused by a virus that attacks the central_nervous_system and can produce paralysis and death by asphyxiation . There are no effective drugs to treat it . Patients whose respiratory cells have been destroyed usually require a respirator to control breathing and keep them alive . The image of a child in a so-called &quot; iron_lung &quot; became a terrifying specter in this country during the height of the epidemic in the early 1950s -- particularly 1952 , when the United States experienced an explosion of thousands of cases . Fear of infection led parents to take extreme measures . Because outbreaks mostly occurred during summer , parents frequently would shelter their children at_home when warm weather arrived . Children were often forbidden to play in parks or use public swimming_pools . Households with an infected family member were placed under quarantine and isolated from the community . The first effective vaccine against polio was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1954 . Salk ' s vaccine , which was put into widespread use in 1955 , was injectable and used killed polio virus to provoke immunity . Between 1957 and 1959 , Dr. Albert Sabin developed an oral vaccine that used a live but weakened virus . The Sabin_vaccine was licensed in 1961 , and continues to be the vaccine most widely used in the world today . The disease mostly afflicts young children , although adults also are susceptible . In fact , the most famous American stricken was President Franklin D . Roosevelt , who fell ill at the age of 35 . Pan American Health officials said that the battle_plan to immunize the region ' s children involved several strategies . These include national vaccination days , when most of the infant population is vaccinated ; &quot; sweep operations , &quot; when health_care workers immunize children , house to house , after a suspected case is identified , and intensive surveillance efforts to detect new cases . By 1985 , 11 countries classified as &quot; endemic &quot; -- that is , having had at least one confirmed case during the previous three years -- began to sponsor national vaccination days on a semiannual basis . Officials of the Western_Hemisphere organization said that this often involved massive education campaigns in_advance . Before the civil_war in El_Salvador ended , for example , Pan American Health negotiated with guerrilla fighters and the military , asking them to declare a temporary truce and respect a cease-fire during the vaccination day , the organization said . In Peru , Pan American Health sponsored a press_conference to inform the nation -- and Shining Path guerrillas -- of the coming vaccination effort . The most difficult problem was finding ways to keep the vaccine cold , organization officials said . The medication requires constant temperatures below 10 degrees Centigrade ( 50 degrees Fahrenheit ) . In Peru , for example , many of the cold packs were kept frozen every night in refrigerators loaned by villagers . In Lima , during an especially hot summer , more_than 10 tons of ice were needed to preserve the vaccine . The campaign was funded by the collaborative effort among countries and agencies , including $ 430 million provided by the countries themselves , and the remainder from collaborating agencies . These included the U.S. Agency for International Development , Rotary_International , United Nations Children ' s Fund , the Inter-American Development Bank and the Canadian Public Health Assn . AID officials said that the agency contributed $ 79 million between 1986 and 1994 . WHO said it would concentrate its efforts next on the complete eradication of polio in the rest of the world , as was achieved with smallpox in 1977 . Also , it will turn its attention to launching a similar effort against measles , another vaccine-preventable illness that kills 1 million people annually , most of them children . Polio-eradication programs have left a health infrastructure within the Americas &quot; that will facilitate the struggle against measles , &quot; Pan American Health said . The organization said that it hopes polio can be wiped_out by the year 2000 . Today , 81 % of the world ' s children have received the vaccine , it said . &quot; The challenge . . . will be to reach the remaining 20 % of children who live_in the most isolated and impenetrable areas of the world , &quot; the organization said .</TEXT>
