   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : U.S. INVESTORS SEE MORE GAINS AHEAD AS JAPANESE STOCKS JUMP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Foreign money is pouring into Japanese stocks again , convinced that the Japanese economy ' s four-year slide is over and that a robust corporate profit turnaround is imminent . Many foreign buyers also are betting_on another , perhaps more important turnaround : a change in Japanese investors ' gloomy view of their market , which has left most of them watching unimpressed on the sidelines as the gaijin ( foreigners ) snap_up Japanese shares . The Nikkei-225 stock index has soared from 17 # 417.24 at year ' s end to 20 # 973.59 as of Tuesday , a 20 % gain that makes the Tokyo market among the world ' s best this year . In recent days the Nikkei has been particularly strong , breaking above the 20 # 000 mark to a nine-month high . Optimism is running strong among many American portfolio managers , who believe that the Japanese economy is finally bottoming and that Japan therefore offers an opportunity to buy stocks on the ground_floor of a recovery . Obviously , any investor who missed loading_up on U.S. stocks two years ago , while the U.S. economy languished , doesn ' t want to make the same mistake twice . Barton Biggs , the influential investment strategist for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. , recently told clients that &quot; the Japanese market is a buy right now. &quot; Biggs ' case is that Japan ' s many ills -- including a floundering political_system , collapsed corporate earnings , a strong yen and horrendous hidden real_estate loan losses at banks -- are already so well known to investors that they must be mostly discounted in_stock prices . &quot; What isn ' t discounted is that Japan is still a huge , powerful economy with a formidable business class running world-class companies located in the center of the fastest growth area of the world , &quot; Biggs told clients in a May 11 report . Strictly by the numbers , Japan still looks sickly . Real economic_growth , 4 % in 1991 , plunged to 1.5 % in 1992 and was a negative 0.1 % in ' 93 . The problem last year was largely internal : Japan ' s wealthy consumers sharply reduced their spending as the country ' s major corporations launched restructuring efforts ( including deep cuts_in capital spending , and some layoffs ) to cope_with weaker global demand for Japanese exports . In short , 1993 was the year in which corporate Japan finally acknowledged that the glory days of the 1980s ' export era -- when Japan stood unrivaled -- were finished . The nation ' s political_machine also broke_down last year , ending what had essentially been 38 years of one-party rule . The price of corporate and societal restructuring hasn ' t been paid in full : Morgan Stanley expects only 0.7 % real growth in Japan this year , far below expected U.S. growth and even below what struggling Europe should be able to muster . But stock_markets look ahead , and that ' s what is happening now , say the Japan bulls . Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. , for example , is telling clients that Japanese corporate earnings could rocket 35 % next year from this year ' s depressed levels . Morgan Stanley ' s Biggs expects that revived domestic demand and faster export growth will lead to 5 % to 6 % economic_growth in Japan in 1995-1996 . &quot; When that happens , profits should explode , &quot; Biggs contends . Even so , many investors would argue that Japanese stocks already reflect 1995 earnings gains , and more . The Japanese market ' s price-to-earnings ratio is an astronomical 70 now , based on estimated 1994 earnings per share . Even cut_in half , the Japanese P-E would be 35 , far above the 15 to 20 P-Es of most world markets . The bulls contend that the P-E argument isn ' t important , and not just because Japanese stocks have always sold for high P-Es . Adjust for accounting differences and look_at real , cash earnings of Japanese companies , and many Japanese stocks appear quite reasonably priced , says John Hickling , one of Fidelity Investments ' senior international managers . By Morgan Stanley ' s figuring , Japanese stocks now sell for 7.8 times estimated 1995 cash earnings , versus 8.3 times for U.S. stocks . Hickling , who manages Fidelity ' s Japan stock fund and Overseas stock fund , says &quot; a lot of the ( Japanese ) stocks I own sell for less than 10 times 1994 cash flow , &quot; which is cheap if you consider how depressed profits still are this year , he says . &quot; I think the Japanese market looks terrific , &quot; Hickling says , and he ' s focused in particular on industrial giants such_as Toyota . &quot; You just have to look_at what they ' ve done to their cost base &quot; to see rich future profit potential there , he says . William Stack , manager of the Lexington Global fund , also believes that Japan ' s leading industrial firms are poised for stunning turnarounds . &quot; One of my strongest investment convictions today is Japanese cyclical stocks , &quot; says Stack , whose fund owns issues such_as Toyota and Honda Motor . Yet beyond the obvious potential pitfalls in the bullish case on Japan -- another dive in the economy , or a further strengthening of the overvalued yen -- there ' s one glaring problem : The Japanese themselves aren ' t buying stock . Still traumatized by their four-year bear_market , Japanese regard the latest market surge as the work of &quot; silly gaijin , &quot; says Jamie Rosenwald , whose Redondo Beach-based Rosenwald Capital Management has long been_active in Japan . Rosenwald is going_to Japan next week , specifically to look_for hints that cash-rich Japanese institutions are ready to move_back into stocks . If he can ' t find evidence of a change in sentiment , Rosenwald admits he will have to reconsider his bullish view of the market . After all , he notes , the Nikkei bounced from 16 # 000 to 20 # 000 a year ago , only to slump again in the fall . If domestic investors join in , the Nikkei could hit 25 # 000 in a hurry , Rosenwald says . Without them , &quot; This rally could fizzle real quickly , &quot; he warns . Michael Lindsell , Tokyo-based manager of the GT Global Japan stock fund , says there are some signs that the Japanese want to buy stocks again , but that most investors there are wary -- himself included . &quot; I am pretty suspicious about a wholehearted ( economic ) recovery , &quot; he admits . The question thus is , who has a better view of Japan ' s future -- the downtrodden Japanese , or the outsiders looking in ? Hot Streak Tokyo stocks have rallied sharply this year , and now are at their highest levels since September .
