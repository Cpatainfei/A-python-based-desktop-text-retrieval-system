   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; STONE REMOVES THE GLOVES IN ' KILLERS ' ; A MURDERING COUPLE BECOMES MEDIA DARLINGS IN THE DIRECTOR ' S RELENTLESS WORK OF VISUAL DEXTERITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; is the movie Oliver Stone was born to make , and if that statement is a knife that cuts both ways , so be it . A filmmaker celebrated and excoriated , recipient of a pair of best director Oscars for &quot; Platoon &quot; and &quot; Born_on the Fourth_of_July &quot; as well as the contempt of the political establishment for &quot; JFK , &quot; Stone has not exactly had a tranquil career . Yet nothing he ' s attempted before is adequate preparation for the over-the-top savagery and carefully controlled madness that is &quot; Natural Born Killers. &quot; The picaresque , satirical adventures of till-death-do-us-part serial_murderers Mickey and Mallory Knox ( Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis ) and their road to international celebrity , &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; is both audacious and astonishing , a vision of a charnel_house apocalypse that comes_close to defying description . So unyielding violent and blood-splattered it took_five trips to the ratings board to earn its R , &quot; Killers &quot; ( which carries an advisory label unprecedented in its length and detail ) is too consumed by carnage to be to everyone ' s taste . But it is also , and perhaps more lastingly , a tribute to the power of film and the skill of a director who , for the first and perhaps the only time in his career , has taken the gloves off with a vengeance . For all_of Stone ' s previous work can be seen as a prolonged attempt to pretend , with varying degrees of success , that he is an orthodox filmmaker . But after continuously trying to squeeze his crazed / visionary sense of the medium into Hollywood ' s inelastic forms , of making at times awkward films that were equal parts conventional and maniacal , Stone has found subject_matter that can tolerate his style at its most outrageous and disturbing . The effect has been liberating . Screen violence poster boy Quentin Tarantino , whose Palme d ' Or-winning &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; seems almost tame compared to this , wrote the original script for &quot; Killers. &quot; But Stone , working with co-screenwriters David Veloz and Richard Rutowski , has so made this project his own that Tarantino has kept his aesthetic distance , settling for no more_than a &quot; story by &quot; credit . Like so many loners-on-the-loose films before it , &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; opens in a bleak roadside diner . Mickey , a slight grin playing behind his rose-tinted granny glasses , is sitting at the counter deciding to &quot; give the key_lime pie its day in court , &quot; while Mallory , in a skimpy halter top that reveals her scorpion tattoo , is dancing provocatively by the jukebox when some rough-and-ready locals slam through the door . It doesn ' t require much intuition to figure_out that no good_will come from this unforeseen meeting . But though the ensuing slaughter is inevitable , Stone , cinematographer Robert Richardson ( a Stone regular ) and editors Hank Corwin and Brian Berdan bring things off with so_much visual panache we don ' t know whether to be impressed or horrified . Or both . While this kind of &quot; Badlands on speed &quot; opening is outrageous , how far Stone and company are willing to go is not apparent until the next set_piece , when what might have been an ordinary look_at Mallory ' s tortured childhood is shown as a warped TV sitcom called &quot; I Love Mallory , &quot; complete with heart symbol , laugh track and a wisecracking , malignant Rodney Dangerfield startling as a sexually abusive toad of a father . It is Mickey , forever after to be her knight , who shows_up to deliver 50 pounds of beef and rescues Mallory from this pit . And the almost continuous murder spree that follows is intercut with juvenile protestations of endless love and a goony joining of vows that includes Mickey ' s wistful determination &quot; not to murder anybody on our wedding day. &quot; As unnerving as &quot; Killers ' &quot; plot is , relating it can only hint at what the experience is like on film . For Stone , in a brilliant display of visual dexterity , has so heedlessly , even recklessly , piled image on top of image -- color , black_and_white , tinted stock , video , double exposures , animation and more -- that surrender to the onslaught seems the only option . More_than showing highlights of M &amp; M ' s three-week murder spree and their 48 ( or is it 52 ? ) victims , &quot; Killers &quot; is intent as well on visually taking us inside their minds . This means that a constantly changing array of images is projected on any surface that is handy , everything from shots of animals having_sex to Edward Curtis ' vintage ethnographic footage . * Equally eclectic , and just as essential in creating mood , is the &quot; Killers &quot; redoubtable soundtrack , containing more_than 75 selections including Nine Inch Nails ( whose Trent Reznor put it all together ) , Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan , the Shangri-Las and the story ' s poet_laureate , Leonard Cohen . Unusual for a film whose effects are so dependent_on the bombardment of stimuli , the cast ' s satiric acting is_on target as well . Not only are Harrelson and Lewis all they should be , they are matched by both Tom Sizemore as twisted criminal investigator Jack Scagnetti and Tommy Lee Jones as a feisty prison warden . Best of the lot is Robert Downey Jr . as Wayne Gale , the blabbering Australian host of TV ' s hottest show , &quot; American Maniacs , &quot; intended , he fondly admits , for &quot; the nitwits out there in zombie-land. &quot; And the nitwits , &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; amusingly and horrifically points_out , are eating it up . Mickey and Mallory become the ultimate international media darlings , cover subjects for Newsweek and People and captivating fans like the wanna-be victim who holds_up a hopeful &quot; Murder Me , Mickey &quot; sign during one of M &amp; M ' s courtroom appearances . It was , not surprisingly , the chance to examine the how and why of this kind of celebrity-hood that initially motivated Stone to make &quot; Killers , &quot; and , aside from his technical wizardry , that is the element that makes the excesses palatable . * For unlike any number of films , the excruciating violence and gore here is not done to titillate . The idea , witness O.J. Simpson and the Menendez brothers , is to mock our societal fascination with blood-letting , to hold_up a cracked mirror and literally force a reconsideration of what we ' re doing as a culture and where it seems to be leading . This nightmare world in flames that ' s making you wince , Stone is saying , it ' s the one we live_in right now . Does this all come_off as planned ? Of course not . &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; lacks the rigor of the similarly themed , little seen Belgian film &quot; Man Bites Dog , &quot; and it has twinges of its own kind of sentimentality , especially in the scenes involving Russell Means as an all-knowing ( is there any other kind ? ) tribal shaman . Plus , if you don ' t find yourself on the film ' s often warped wavelength , the nonstop violence will sicken and offend you . But because of the frisson of directorial energy Stone infuses this film with , we can ' t help but be affected by its sensory barrage . Watching &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; is like sitting next to a wild_man driving at 90 m.p.h. in_order to convince you to wear a seat_belt . You may wish he ' d slow_down a bit , but it ' s hard to argue with the effectiveness of the tools at_hand . * MPAA rating : R for extreme violence and graphic carnage , for shocking images , and for strong language and sexuality .
