   <HEADLINE> THE LABORS OF JOHN GARAMENDI ; THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE IS HARD-WORKING AND AMBITIOUS . MAYBE TOO AMBITIOUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the windowless lunch room of the Hi-Ridge Lumber Co . on the outskirts of Yreka , a small group of dust-covered sawmill workers sits around scarred picnic tables . They don ' t care much for politicians -- especially the ones in Sacramento , who seem to cater mostly to the strange and distant problems of urban California -- so they ' re disconcerted to find themselves spending their dinner hour with one . The visitor , who essentially invited himself , is state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi , 49 , Democrat and iconoclastic candidate for governor . Garamendi coils his lanky denim-clad frame on a corner of one table and introduces himself , then asks_for questions . There are no TV cameras , no campaign word spinners , no banners or fund-raising envelopes . And no bull . Not , at least , from the dour workers as they pick through brown bags and dinner_buckets . &quot; What can the governor ' s office do for us ? &quot; one worker demands . Hi-Ridge is a survivor , so far , in a timber industry that is succumbing to owls , imports and other forces -- mostly government bureaucrats , the way the workers see it . If they are skeptical of politicians in_general , these hunters and outdoorsmen are particular scornful of those who talk , as Garamendi does , about gun_controls and protecting the environment . As he launches into a discourse on forestry , environmental balance , sustained yield , computer-monitored laser-beam saws and the export of California logs to Japan , the men hunch_over their sandwiches . If not for Garamendi ' s imposing physical presence , he might ' ve lost them entirely . He carries his trim 215 pounds erect on his 6-foot-2 frame . His dark hair shows no gray , his blue eyes are intense , and his hands , massive even for such a large man , slice the air to punctuate his points . He moves_on to the reform of workers ' compensation insurance to reduce rates at high-risk places like sawmills . He says that health-care reform -- he has his own plan , of course -- would free up the capital that Hi-Ridge would need to modernize its plant . Then , closing the circle , he says , &quot; You can maintain your productivity here , compete , and you guys keep your jobs . Or , alternately , you can go debate ( higher ) wages. &quot; He grins at Hi-Ridge vice_president Gerald Bendix , sitting off in a corner . &quot; Providing we can get jobs , &quot; a doubting mill hand says . &quot; That too , &quot; Garamendi says , flashing a smile . A grudging burst of laughter breaks the tension . &quot; can ' t solve everything in one evening , &quot; he adds . Maybe not , but Garamendi tries . He fields questions and offers proposals on crime ( the &quot; three-strikes &quot; law , licensing of handguns , boot camps for young offenders ) , job retraining , restructuring the work_force , overhauling the school_system , putting California onto the information superhighway and invigorating the economy by converting aerospace plants to new transportation industries . Then the lunch boxes snap shut , crumpled bags are slam-dunked into the trash_barrel , and Garamendi , in hard_hat , gloves and apron , joins the workers on the saw lines . With the campaign slogan &quot; Working for California , &quot; he ' s pledging to work in every one of California ' s 58 counties by the June 7 primary , and he ' ll add his sawmill day to his growing list of odd jobs : clerk at a hardware_store in Weaverville , crowbar wielder on an L.A. city street-repair crew , grocery bagger at a Safeway store in Fairfield . When he leaves the mill after 11 p.m. , he is as sawdust-grimy as the others and as bouncy as a kid with a new bike . His proposals didn ' t seem to impress the workers too_much , mill official Bendix says later , but that he should come and work_at the mill and share their lunchtime , he adds , &quot; that made an impression. &quot; The workday photo op is a poor_man ' s tactic , the sort of gimmick an underdog uses to get free publicity . Even Darry Sragow , Garamendi ' s campaign manager , says the candidate could meet more voters by standing_in front of Garamendi state headquarters on Sunset Boulevard for an hour . And he could raise more money by spending that hour on the telephone with prospective campaign donors . With rival State_Treasurer Kathleen Brown sitting on some $ 4 million ( to Garamendi ' s $ 58 # 000 , as of the March reports ) and a hefty lead in the opinion polls , working the phones means survival . ( State Sen . Tom Hayden , a Democrat from Santa Monica , also a candidate , acknowledges he has no chance of winning. ) Sragow does not like Garamendi ' s workdays . But the candidate is keeping his own counsel , as he always has . And the idea of real , physical labor is at the core of his upbringing , his character and -- even if it undermines it -- his campaign . The product of a Basque-Irish-Italian mining and ranching family ( Garamendi means &quot; fiery mountain &quot; in Basque ) , he insists that working alongside people is the only way a governor can really understand California . Like other new-idea politicians ( Gary Hart , Bill_Clinton ) before him , Garamendi believes problems must be attacked forcefully on the ground_level . Communities must come_together , pitch_in and make things better . Put everyone in the room and hammer_out a solution -- without getting dissipated and lost in gridlocked committees . Such circumvention of conventional politics also allows the 20-year state-government veteran to run as an outsider . That may_not be as contradictory as it seems ; Garamendi has worked outside the system even while he has been in it , a quality that does not endear him to all his colleagues . Ignoring the old notion of stroking allies and paying your dues , he often seems to be elbowing his way to the front of the line . &quot; He was always working for the best interest of John Garamendi , with political gain in mind , &quot; observes state Sen . Robert G . Beverly , a Republican from Long_Beach and a Garamendi Senate colleague for 16 years . By all accounts , Garamendi is a supremely self-confident man who always has charted an independent course . &quot; I don ' t care about the political risk , &quot; he says . &quot; I win it or lose_it , I want to attack the problem. &quot; His way . IT WAS A LITTLE EXPERIMENT ON THE PART OF CALAVERAS HIGH_SCHOOL teacher John Lodato one day back in the early 1960s , when one of his honor students was a burly ranch kid named John Garamendi . Lodato went_into the classroom , took roll , and then , he recalls , &quot; I just went_to the back of the room and sat_down . After about five minutes or so of low-order chaos , John takes_over and gets the class organized , and they do a certain amount of activity related to the curriculum . . . . I had a hunch that John was the type of kid who would not be willing to just sit there and see the class do nothing. &quot; Garamendi , says Lodato , now running a tennis_club in San Andreas , always stood_out as a leader . John Raymond Garamendi grew_up the second of seven children on a ranch two miles from the Gold_Rush town of Mokelumne Hill in the Sierra foothills . For John , often in tandem with brother Tom , nearly a year and a half older , boyhood in California ' s Mother Lode was bucolic . He remembers Little_League , Boy_Scouts , milkshakes at the town soda_fountain , almost-straight-A report_cards , being class president at Calaveras High . In the summers , there was backpacking in the nearby Sierra with his father , Raymond , a local civic_leader . They skied in the winter and branded calves in spring . And when he and Tom got crosswise with their dad , there was some serious digging of postholes in the rocky ground of the Mother Lode . &quot; You lived your values , the value of hard work , &quot; says Garamendi . &quot; Stay with it until it ' s done . ' When that hole is 32 inches deep , then you can quit , Son . I don ' t care how hard the rock is . You ' ve got_to set the post properly. ' &quot; Talk to relatives and friends from Moke Hill , as they call it locally , and you get stories tinged with Norman Rockwell . They recall the time John pulled a man from a burning building while on his way home from school . And they tell of pranks . Such_as the time Tom and John built a fort to end all forts , burrowing out tunnels within the bales of hay stacked in the barn for feeding the stock through the winter and spring months . &quot; It was not just a big hole , &quot; recalls Tom Garamendi , who is maintenance supervisor at the prison in nearby Ione . &quot; It was a major chasm . We ' d taken everything out , and we ' d made supports of timbers and large pipes and everything. &quot; In the fall , Ray Garamendi inventoried the hay to make_sure he ' d have enough bales to feed the cattle when needed , and there seemed to be plenty . So it came as a rude surprise when he removed some bales the following year to find &quot; there was nothing but air down there , &quot; Tom says . &quot; I am sure that we were grounded , &quot; he adds , &quot; not because of what we did , but because we didn ' t bother telling him. &quot; Like his father , who died almost three years ago , John is a strapping fellow with a jaw so squarely chiseled he brings_to mind Dudley Do-Right , the stiff-backed Mountie of the Bullwinkle cartoons . As a star athlete , the one-on-one nature of wrestling particularly appealed_to him . &quot; It was what you could do yourself , &quot; he recalls . &quot; You find_out how good you were right away . If you made a mistake , it was all yours &quot; -- a template for the way he ' d play politics years later . When Garamendi was 18 and a tackle on the UC Berkeley football_team , President John F . Kennedy was assassinated . Kennedy had been the hero of Garamendi and his girlfriend , Patricia Wilkinson , a 19-year-old music and education major from Watsonville , and his death changed their discussions about their future . In their senior year , they were married and enjoyed a surprise honeymoon in Hawaii when Garamendi was picked to play in the Hula Bowl college all-star game . They debated whether John should go_on to business_school as planned or , possibly , play professional_football ; there were feelers from both the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys . But then Patti brought_up the idea of joining Kennedy ' s Peace Corps . Mary Jane Garamendi , 73 , recalls a spring day in 1966 when John and Patti came_home for a visit before getting their degrees . &quot; They said , ' We ' re going to Ethiopia. ' &quot; &quot; I said , ' Where is Ethopia ? Oh gosh , that ' s so far away. ' &quot; John Garamendi was 21 years old and had never been beyond Mexico when a creaky World_War_II C-47 transport left him and Patti in a pasture in southwestern Ethiopia -- &quot; about as far from anywhere as you could get , &quot; he says . They lived_in a mud hut , without running water or electricity , in the village of Mettu , and for the next two years taught the village children English , math and other subjects , with John using his ranching skills to organize local improvement projects . &quot; We saw everything , &quot; Garamendi says . &quot; We saw people next to us die because they were sick. &quot; They responded systematically . &quot; We ' d find some task that could be done rather simply and quickly , and we ' d fix that , so there ' d be a success. &quot; That lesson , of using small successes to build experience and to motivate the community to solve more complex problems , is one he applies broadly . In Ethiopia , he worked with the villagers first to develop a water well , then a bridge across a stream to its school and , later , plumbing , electricity and improvements in the local economy . And he carries a similar approach to problem solving into his campaign_for_governor . After the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake , Garamendi quickly -- and with considerable political risk , some experts thought -- called_for temporary increases in the state sales and gasoline_taxes to repair the damage . California could not afford to sit_back and wait , as Gov . Pete Wilson was inclined , to see just how much of the bill would be paid by the federal_government , he said . The money was not as important as the idea of Californians joining together to work toward a common goal , to overcome the Golden State ' s decline . &quot; I ' ve been very clear about this business of this tax , &quot; he said before the Legislature opted , instead , to put a bond issue on the June ballot . &quot; It ' s a very important test of the spirit , of the capabilities of the community . It ' s like building that bridge to the school ( in Ethiopia ) . The community got_together . . . . &quot; They did_it . And that empowered them to do something else . And so it is here . &quot; Ethiopia . It changed everything , &quot; Garamendi adds . &quot; It just intensified everything and has remained the pivotal point in our lives. &quot; GARAMENDI ' S POLITICAL OPPONENTS MIGHT CHUCKLE TO LEARN THAT HE lost his first big election when he ran against his best_friend for president of the Calaveras High student body . Compared with the stakes of being governor of the nation ' s largest state in 1994 , it was more of a social honor , says the winner , Erle Winkler of San Andreas , a realtor and owner of a health_food store in San Andreas . There were no hard feelings , Winkler says . &quot; It was a friendly campaign. &quot; In a later election for senior_class president , Garamendi emerged as the winner . It was not the last time that Garamendi kept_on running after a loss . In 1982 , after just eight years in the Legislature , he was swamped in a premature bid for the Democratic nomination for governor , losing to then-L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley . He lost a shot at state controller four years later . And after he had worked his way into the state Senate ' s controlling Democratic hierarchy to become majority_leader , he was dumped by his colleagues . They argued that Garamendi spent too_much time nurturing his own political ambitions and not enough attending_to fund-raising for fellow party members . An even more serious miscalculation was his abortive effort to replace a fellow Democrat as the top Senate officer , president pro_tem , in January of 1986 . Garamendi tipped reporters the night before his planned coup , and word got_back to Senate chief David A . Roberti , who rallied his own forces . When Garamendi moved the following day to elect himself to the top job , he got nobody ' s vote but his own . Garamendi had risen quickly in the Senate because he was smart , hard-working and productive , veteran Sacramento observers agree . But they also claim that he repeatedly was tripped_up by his ambition to jump to higher office too quickly , particularly when he tried to leap over Roberti , who had been something of a mentor to him in the Senate . &quot; His ambition keeps getting_in the way of his pragmatic judgment , &quot; Roberti said after the vote . State Sen . Diane E . Watson , a Democrat from Los Angeles and a Garamendi supporter , says that Garamendi , while a whiz at policy , tends to rush into situations . &quot; He worked , I guess , in a very rapid way and probably was ahead of a lot of people , &quot; she says . &quot; But you know , it doesn ' t do you any good unless you ' re sure people are following you on these things . I think he ' s learning that. &quot; Garamendi , who has dealt in some fashion with virtually every major state issue over the past two decades , is not shy about taking credit for his policy successes , another quality that irks his colleagues . At a senior center in Crescent City , he volunteers that he wrote the bond act that provided the money to remodel the building . Talking_about putting welfare recipients to work , he says , &quot; The reason I ' m familiar_with that program is that I wrote the law. &quot; The health-care debate in Washington ? &quot; Based on a program I developed here in California , &quot; he says . &quot; Hillary substantially improved it . Bill will do his best not to screw it up , I ' m sure. &quot; Hillary and Bill ? Oh yes . John and Patti Garamendi are friends of the First Couple . Garamendi was Clinton ' s California campaign chairman in 1992 . His health-care plan did , in fact , serve as the basis for development of the Clinton program . Patti Garamendi has been appointed to the No . 3 job in the U.S. Peace Corps in the Clinton_Administration . Garamendi ' s foes complain that he ' s too good to be true , yet many acknowledge that he does have a broader vision than most . In 1986 , just as personal_computers were becoming popular , he issued a report emphasizing the importance to California of new technology and information_systems . Before it became a common political buzzword , he wrote a report on competitiveness . He argued , as he still does , that California cannot afford to abandon its manufacturing base and become a total service economy . This immersion in public policy and politics after his return from Ethiopia was something of a natural progression for Garamendi , although it almost didn ' t happen . In 1970 , after earning his MBA from Harvard , he started working in the international finance department of the Bank of America in San Francisco , but concerns about taking his young family abroad again -- by then , the Garamendis had two children -- derailed his international business plans . Instead , the family moved to Calaveras County , where John went_into real_estate development and became involved in local affairs -- building a park in Mokelumne Hill and working to protect farmland from development . The Garamendis also helped to organize a Democratic caucus in their new Assembly district , established under reapportionment . As it was a new seat , there was no one with the built-in advantage of incumbency . With the help of another active young Democrat in the area , Pat Johnston , the Garamendis put_together a winning campaign . &quot; John was a comer , immediately a striking candidate , &quot; recalls Johnston , who followed Garamendi into the Assembly and the Senate . &quot; He brought a dynamism and a sort of optimism -- idealism really -- that most people don ' t convey even when they ' re trying to. &quot; Asked to assess Garamendi ' s assets and flaws , he pauses and thinks carefully . &quot; His ambition has never been hidden or disguised , &quot; Johnston says in his state Senate office in Sacramento . &quot; There ' s no false humility . And he believes that he ' s the best one to do whatever the next political position is that might be available -- governor and probably President of the United States . I ' ve never heard him talk_about it , but that ' s how he views himself. &quot; &quot; I am not one to let the world go_by , &quot; says Garamendi . &quot; I take an active role in what I do and sometimes that rubs people the wrong way. &quot; Garamendi served one two-year term in the Assembly and moved_on to the state Senate in 1976 , again when there was no incumbent running . After his Senate career , Garamendi finally won a statewide office in 1990 , becoming California ' s first insurance commissioner . In the high-profile race for enforcer of the insurance rebates promised in Proposition 103 , he pledged to ensure that the promised $ 2 billion in rebates was returned to voters . Since then , a conglomerate of three insurance_companies agreed to pay a $ 500 # 000 fine for redlining in San Francisco and Los Angeles , thanks to pressure from Garamendi . And by this year , rebates to 6 million California policyholders totaled $ 832 million , according to figures provided by Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield . Many of the major companies are still fighting rebates in the courts , along with virtually every_other Garamendi initiative to regulate the industry more strictly . But auto liability rates have been stabilized , averaging $ 518 a year in 1992 , compared with $ 519 in 1989 , Rosenfield says , while rates increased by 20 % in the rest of the country during that time . Rosenfield did not support Garamendi ' s election in 1990 , viewing him as too_much of a pro-business moderate and fearing that he would not be tough enough on the insurance industry . But &quot; it didn ' t turn_out that way at all , &quot; he says . &quot; I think he ' s really tried hard to make 103 work and keep rates low. &quot; Garamendi ' s insurance-industry foes generally label him as a publicity-hungry demagogue who rushes prematurely into an action primarily for its headline value . He , in turn , calls them &quot; pigs at the trough &quot; who care more about their profits than their policyholders . No one disputes the fact , however , that the insurance commissioner ' s job was an ideal platform for launching Garamendi ' s next run_for the brass ring . ON SEPT . 3 , 1990 , JOHN GARAMENDI DID SOMETHING ALMOST UNHEARD OF in politics . He resigned his state Senate office two months before he would know if he would win the office he was seeking : state insurance commissioner . This time , Garamendi ' s actions seemed to have nothing to do with his own political ambition . But they did have something -- perhaps everything -- to do with the political ambitions of his wife , Patti . Garamendi argued that by resigning when he did , the governor could schedule the special election to fill his Senate seat -- which had two years to run -- to coincide with the general_election . That would save the $ 500 # 000 cost of a separate special election , he said -- and his salary as state_senator . But few bought Garamendi ' s argument because they knew one of the candidates for Garamendi ' s seat would be his wife . Another was Garamendi ' s old political sidekick Pat Johnston , who would now be in something of a box . Johnston wanted the Senate job , but it was too late for him to remove his name from the ballot for reelection to his Assembly seat . So he faced voter confusion over which seat he was running_for , as he was now forced to seek both . This gave Patti Garamendi a distinct advantage , but Johnston won anyway , with 35 % of the vote to Patti ' s 26 % . If political critics view John Garamendi as a little glib , a little too effusive , many see Patti Garamendi as even more so . Also tall ( about 5-foot-10 ) , blond , blue-eyed and energetic , she has always been an activist , she says . &quot; From the time I was 10 years old , my dad said I was just a born do-gooder . I don ' t know if he meant it positively or not , but I couldn ' t help myself. &quot; And in politics , she is irrepressible . Johnston ' s victory not only failed to discourage her , it created a fresh opportunity . Johnson ' s Senate victory opened_up his Assembly seat , setting the stage for a new round of special elections to fill that post . Patti ran_for the Assembly and lost in May , 1991 , to conservative Republican Dean Andal . Still another opportunity arose in 1992 -- a new congressional_district created by reapportionment . Patti ran_for that U.S. House seat , too . She lost again , narrowly , to the Republican mayor of Tracy . Sacramento Bee columnist Dan Walters wrote what many California political observers were thinking : &quot; Despite their attractive public personalities , the Garamendis ' political endeavors have always been plagued by their self-contained insularity . . . and a reputation . . . for self-serving machinations. &quot; The question now is whether Patti ' s three tries_for office not only cost Garamendi goodwill among political insiders but also campaign donations from those the couple has repeatedly solicited . Patti Garamendi says she has no regrets about losing three times in two years . The losses , after all , yielded a gain in the form of her Peace Corps job . &quot; I would n ' t be where I am today if I hadn ' t had the courage to step_out there as an individual and offer my skills for service , &quot; she says . If John Garamendi is elected , Patti says , California would get more_than an executive partnership on the order of Bill_Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- it would be electing an entire First Family . Eldest daughter Genet , 25 , is a political assistant to a California congressman . John Jr. , 23 , travels as Garamendi ' s aide-de-camp and friend . Daughters Christina , 21 , and Autumn , 18 , UC Davis students , are leaders in an international environmental organization and helped establish programs within a Bosnia refugee camp last year . Merle , who is 13 and prefers to use her middle name , Elizabeth , and Ashley , 7 , live_in Washington most of the time with their mother , who says that despite their bicoastal living_arrangement , she and John &quot; remain totally connected. &quot; Johnston , choosing his words carefully , says he believes John and Patti Garamendi constitute &quot; a core consultation unit that is very exclusive . . . . It ' s never been particularly important to John what other people thought_of him. &quot; As a new legislator , Garamendi commuted regularly to the Assembly in Sacramento , returning to Calaveras County over a twisting two-lane road to be with his family in the evenings rather than schmooze with other legislators who maintained second homes_in the capital . Eventually , the Garamendis moved closer_in , to a 1920s farm house near Walnut Grove . &quot; My dad was always there , &quot; says Genet , never missing a recital , a school play , a graduation or the other important events of childhood . &quot; He would make breakfast for us every morning. &quot; Though even her friends are skeptical , she insists that there is no dark side beneath a happy facade . A standing joke in California political circles is the annual Garamendi Christmas_card , showing the family and , sometimes , a surprise guest , in an idyllic scene from the ranch or on the beach . The 1992 card included Bill_Clinton . There is nothing new about a politician using a family photo on a Christmas_card . But the Garamendis come_in_for ribbing perhaps because there are so many of them , all so handsome , with , sometimes , a schmaltzy message . In the 1992 card , John wrote , &quot; We seize each day and squeeze from it its fullest , thanking God for what has been given . Like the special evening in the photo when our new president joined us for dinner at Walnut Grove. &quot; The Garamendis know that some make_fun of their cards . In fact , Sragow picked_up on it in issues of his &quot; Garamendi Gram , &quot; a periodic newsletter to reporters and political insiders . The Dec . 10 Garamendi Gram proclaimed : &quot; They ' re on their way ! The 1993 Garamendi family Holiday Greetings will soon be available in mailboxes all_over California. &quot; And the 1993 version also would include a surprise guest , Sragow said . &quot; See if you can guess who joins the Garamendis this year ( pick one ) : Boris Yeltsin , Yasser Arafat , Yitzhak Rabin , Ringo Starr , Elvis Presley , Martin Kurtovich , Pat Brown , Dave Letterman. &quot; The winner would get_to spend one day fund raising for Garamendi . All losers would have to take the winner ' s call . The answer was Kurtovich , Genet ' s husband . The only winners were Garamendi staff_members , who already were dialing for contributions . BACK IN MID-1993 , THE PREDICTIONS for California ' s gubernatorial election went like this : Republican Gov . Pete Wilson was in the tank , Treasurer Kathleen Brown would be anointed with the Democratic nomination in June , and she ' d probably roll_over Wilson in November . And John Garamendi ? Well , if he weren ' t so blinded by political ambition , he would settle for a second term or get his friend Bill_Clinton to give him a job . Today , the dynamic of the campaign is far from last summer ' s forecast . Wilson has returned from the political dead zone , Garamendi is plodding along to his own campaign script , and people are wondering why Brown ' s campaign seems to be stalled . Wilson , 60 , started poll vaulting with a productive 1993 legislative session , by exploiting voter anger over illegal immigration and by hammering away on the issue of violent crime . And his constant visibility during last fall ' s brush_fires and following the Jan . 17 earthquake gave him more media exposure than at any time since he was elected . Opinion polls still harbor danger signs for Wilson . But by April , his popularity with voters had rebounded to near-respectable levels . He trailed in mythical matchups with Brown by 10 points and Garamendi by 5 in the latest Los Angeles Times Poll . The glitter around the candidacy of the 48-year-old Brown began to fade in late 1993 . Critics and some supporters began to question how much substance there was behind Brown ' s family political tradition , her telegenic stardom and her fund-raising acumen . She countered with a series of policy speeches , but they were criticized as failing to convey any overriding vision . By this spring , her campaign remained on cautious cruise_control , so flat and listless that some political commentators began writing that Brown seemed unable to articulate why she wanted to be governor , or what she would do if elected . She was rarely on the stump and dodged Garamendi ' s constant demands to debate . Then in March , Brown hired consultant Clint Reilly to replace her campaign management team . Garamendi has not exactly taken California by storm , but he is making inroads . He blocked Brown from winning endorsement by the giant California Teachers Assn . and won the support of Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina , California ' s most prominent Latina politician . But through early April , most of this was insider stuff . The California electorate , increasingly distrustful of politicians and distracted by economic hard_times , violent crime and an earthquake , was not yet focusing_on the election . Garamendi ' s job -- as Garamendi , Sragow , and many political experts see it -- is to find some way to directly confront Brown and allow voters to see what they believe is his superior grasp of the issues . That most likely will take a series of televised debates , and people interested enough to watch -- but no meetings had been scheduled by early April . Additionally , Garamendi would need to do some crash fund raising to buy TV time . As a last_resort , he could dip_into the Garamendi coffers . The family , worth several million from real_estate deals and other ventures , has given or loaned more_than $ 1 million to their own campaigns in the past . On issues , Garamendi and Brown are similar in many respects : Each calls_for reform of education , making schools safe , being tough on crime , and providing tax incentives to revitalize California industry . They ' re further apart on immigration , with Brown calling_for using troops to monitor the Mexican border and Garamendi , speaking in more conciliatory tones , emphasizing his immigrant roots and rejecting calls_for denying citizenship to U.S.-born babies of non-citizen parents . Garamendi has so far not fully exploited one major difference : his enthusiastic backing of the death_penalty , which Brown opposes while insisting that she will enforce the law . Unlike Brown , he exudes passion about a vision for California , saying that the state has the rare opportunity to meld diverse cultures and their talents into a new renaissance comparable_to Europe ' s of the last millennium . And he contrasts his experience with her relative lack of it . ( &quot; Most every tax incentive stimulation package and program discussed by my opponents , &quot; he says in one speech , &quot; came from work my staff and I did years ago in the state Senate. &quot; ) But the broader theme Garamendi promotes is one of determined leadership that refuses to give_up until there is agreement . He cites the three years he spent in the 1970s bringing Nevada into a new interstate compact with California to control runaway development in the Lake Tahoe Basin . Nevada was particularly reluctant because the compact effectively would prevent the construction of more high-rise casinos on the Nevada shore . But until a new compact was signed , there could be no other development on either side of the lake . &quot; We created a situation where it was in their interest to do something , &quot; Garamendi says . He also takes credit for bringing parties together in support of Proposition 111 in 1990 , the gasoline_tax increase that revived a stagnant highway and transportation_system in California . Again , it took months of meetings , &quot; and I simply would n ' t let them go until it was done. &quot; In typical fashion , he tends to gloss_over the work of others . But Garamendi supporter David Mixner , a pioneering political_leader of the gay community , sees a benefit in the fact that Garamendi is not a team player . Such a stance , he says , can lead to political effectiveness because independence is sometimes &quot; another definition of putting other people ' s feet to the fire to get things done . . . . He passionately cares . He will short-circuit others to get things done. &quot; And he is an acknowledged policy wonk . Says Diane Watson , who succeeded Garamendi as chairman of the Senate ' s Health and Human Services Committee : &quot; John always had a plan . He was the one who always had the charts and graphs and how we could improve the policy. &quot; Unlike Brown , Garamendi ' s image is not particularly polarized by partisanship . The Times California survey in late March found that among Democrats , 51 % like him and 15 % do not . The numbers are similar among independents at 55 % to 13 % . And even among Republicans , he finds more positive ratings -- 43 % -- than negative -- 13 % . But , the poll found , many of the Democrats who like him seem to like Brown more . Sen . Beverly has known Garamendi throughout most of his legislative career and is one colleague who genuinely likes him . But whether he would be a good governor ? &quot; that ' s hard to say . Watching him in action over the last , what is it , 20 years , he might have his eye on the presidency as he walks in the door , the day he walks into the corner ( governor ' s ) office. &quot; The ambition thing again . The issue comes_up repeatedly with Garamendi , says Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sylmar , because &quot; John is fairly up front about his ambition , more_than other people , and they tend to hold that against him. &quot; &quot; He ' s an anomaly , &quot; Beverly adds after a long pause . &quot; On paper , he ' s such a superb candidate , like you called Central Casting and asked_for one . You couple that with his charming wife and a beautiful family . Yet with all that , he ' s not popular ; an attitude , an arrogance comes_across , something . that ' s puzzling. &quot; Rather than try to explain himself , Garamendi returns to his strength , says Johnston , &quot; which is working with his hands . John is , if there ' s a physical aspect to a task , much more comfortable. &quot; In the physics of Garamendi ' s universe , motion seems to be a constant , regenerating force . After dinner , he ' ll sit a_few minutes , then jump up and continue to talk while washing dishes . What does he do to relax ? &quot; Work , &quot; he says . &quot; Go_out and prune trees. &quot; Today , Garamendi campaigns the way he prunes trees or digs postholes -- with so_much urgency that it seems he ' s trying to physically move the entire state of California with those big_hands . But can he transmit that intensity to enough Democrats and capture their votes by June 7 ? Garamendi ' s tactic is working better than political experts thought possible six months ago , but time is growing short . So , Garamendi ' s off to more back-road towns that many Californians never heard of to toil at ordinary jobs for a_few hours beside ordinary people . Working_man to the core , he thrives on it .</TEXT>
