   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; DESPITE GOP ATTACKS , CLINTON FOREIGN_POLICY ECHOS BUSH ' S</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Politics does not stop at the water ' s edge . These days , Republicans are intent_on gaining partisan profit from President Bill_Clinton ' s foreign-policy travails . Yet , GOP lead ers agree on little other_than their opposition to Administration policies that , ironically , often mirror those of Republican predecessors . GOP rhetoric has grown more partisan even as the President ' s policy has become less so . This political posturing is displacing the much-needed debate about America ' s global role . GOP congressional leaders and presidential hopefuls delight in assailing the Administration for getting_it wrong . Congress echoes with accusations that Clinton has been too passive toward Korea ; too bellicose toward Haiti ; too avid in Somalia , too reluctant in Bosnia . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole of Kansas says the President &quot; plans to gut defense. &quot; Attacks have reached scurrilous extremes . When &quot; friendly fire &quot; from U.S. jets tragically downed U.S. helicopters over Iraq , Minority Whip Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) charged that the accident was merely a &quot; symptom of the decay &quot; caused by Clinton ' s defense cuts . But Republicans agree on little other_than their opposition to Clinton . Patrick J . Buchanan , who has pocketed more votes_in Republican primaries than any other GOP presidential contender , insists the United States , having won the Cold_War , should come_home . He would remove troops from Korea and Europe , cut the military budget , pull_out of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and abandon the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . He argues it is time to put America First . Dole , whom polls place at the head of the GOP ' s presidential candidates for 1996 , disagrees totally . He wants the United States to lead , to be &quot; first among equals , &quot; -- as in the Cold_War . Any party that spans the gulf from Virginia zealot Oliver L . North to Oregon ' s peaceable Sen . Mark O . Hatfield will harbor disagreements about policy , but even at the GOP ' s center , disagreements abound . Dole , a veteran of World_War_II , urged the Administration to bomb the Serbs in Bosnia , promising &quot; strong bipartisan support in Congress. &quot; When the President did order the planes in , conservative Republican Sen . John McCain of Arizona , the Vietnam veteran and the party ' s leading voice on military matters , scorned &quot; feckless pinprick air strikes &quot; and dismissed &quot; with some disdain &quot; those who believe air strikes could have any effect . McCain is now calling_for preemptive bombing of North_Korea ' s nuclear facilities , whereas Dole has been more restrained . Republican attacks tend to focus_on management . They indict Clinton for flip-flopping , for sending confused signals , for squandering U.S. credibility , hoping they can merge his foreign-policy missteps , Paula Corbin Jones and Whitewater into one large character indictment . These attacks neglect to mention that most of Clinton ' s U-turns have been in one direction : away from liberal positions he took_in the campaign toward policies similar to those of the Bush_Administration . The most recent illustration was when Clinton discarded his pledge not to &quot; coddle dictators &quot; and adopted the Bush_Administration ' s approach toward China , severing the link between human-rights practices and U.S. trading privileges . Indeed , in virtually every major area of foreign_policy -- from peddling &quot; shock_therapy &quot; to Russia and Eastern Europe , to the peace process in the Middle_East , to trade relations with Japan -- the Clinton_Administration has ended_up following the course set by the Bush_Administration . The President waged his largest foreign-policy battle against his own labor and environmental allies in support of NAFTA , an agreement largely negotiated by the Bush_Administration . The Administration has been bedeviled by crises in small places -- Somalia , Haiti , Bosnia and Korea -- but the policies pursued would not have been notably different had Bush been reelected . The large U.S. force in Somalia was sent there by President George_Bush . Clinton went aground in Haiti by adopting a Bush policy , including the repugnant treatment of refugees , which even Bush ' s national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , in an unfortunate choice of words , called &quot; dead in the water. &quot; If Clinton ends_up invading Haiti , he will walk in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan in Grenada and Bush in Panama , who showed that invading a small neighboring country is a good way to look tough on the cheap . In Bosnia , the Administration is echoing the Bush_Administration ' s policy . Both addressed Bosnia as a European problem ; both have sought to help end the conflict without getting U.S. troops involved . Both expressed sympathy for the plight of the Bosnians -- while pushing them to partition their lands for peace . Toward North_Korea , the Administration ' s policy is not so different from the Bush reaction in 1989 -- when the first diversion of nuclear fuel apparently took_place . McCain argues the Administration ' s &quot; failures elsewhere in the world &quot; have eroded U.S. credibility , but Bush ' s victory in Desert Storm did not seem to make much of an impression on Kim Il Sung . If North_Korea has one or two nuclear_weapons , as CIA analysts suggest , it developed them on Bush ' s watch . The combination of partisan posturing and policy continuity has displaced the serious debate about the U.S. role in the world that is surely in_order with the end of the Cold_War . The country faces inescapable challenges : reconstructing the economy at_home , rebuilding Russia and Eastern Europe , restructuring global economic institutions , redressing the growing North-South divide , responding to growing environmental threats and more . But sensible discussion of these matters goes unheard beneath Republican baying about Clinton ' s mismanaged foreign_policy . Perhaps the best example is the GOP ' s indictment of Clinton ' s defense plan , an area where Republicans are most unified and most acidic . McCain charges the Administration &quot; has emasculated the military. &quot; Dole says Clinton is producing a &quot; hollow military. &quot; Former Bush Defense_Secretary Dick Cheney seems to believe he can win the presidential nomination running against the President ' s defense budget . This is mostly hot_air . With the end of the Cold_War , military spending fell , with the savings used to address budget and investment deficits . The Bush_Administration cobbled_together an interim defense plan after the Warsaw Pact collapsed , while the Soviet_Union was still intact . It called_for the United States to maintain active duty forces needed to fight two wars , simultaneously , at opposite ends of the world , without allies -- while bringing U.S. military spending down by about 30 % over six years . Then the Soviet_Union collapsed and the Russian military budget plummeted to less than $ 30 billion a year . Clinton was elected . Clinton allowed the Pentagon to undertake its own review of U.S. military plans . The result naturally reaffirmed the Bush one world-two wars plan , while paring projected spending less than 9 % -- with much coming_by slowing pay increases and projecting lower inflation . Clinton will still spend about $ 1.3 trillion over five years on military_forces -- only marginally smaller than the Bush force , despite the fact that the Soviet_Union disappeared in the interim . Next year ' s military spending is projected at $ 270 billion . Yet , Republicans would have us believe that the President is engaged in unilateral disarmament . Republicans charge Clinton has &quot; cut beyond the bone. &quot; The President responds by &quot; drawing_the_line &quot; against further cuts . The opportunity to change priorities offered by the collapse of the Soviet_Union is lost in the fog . With the Cold_War over , a real debate about the U.S. world role is needed . Instead we witness a Gresham ' s law of politics : Counterfeit partisan posturing displaces real policy debate . No wonder Americans have learned to hate politics .</TEXT>
