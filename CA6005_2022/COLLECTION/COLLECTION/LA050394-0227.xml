   <HEADLINE> VERDICT SPLITS THOSE WORKING WITH O.C. TERMINALLY ILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Those who work with the terminally ill in Orange County were either appalled or thrilled by a Michigan jury verdict Monday that Dr. Jack Kevorkian broke no law by assisting in the suicide of a 30-year-old man with Lou Gehrig ' s disease . The decision was welcomed by those who hope it will advance the cause of freedom of choice for the dying but decried by those who fear it may give doctors a too-easy option to finding ways to relieve the pain of the terminally ill . &quot; I think that was a very logical and mature decision in light of the status of medical treatment which permits people to live_in a situation of pain and suffering far beyond the time they have a meaningful existence , &quot; said Dr. Warren Bostick , former dean of the UC Irvine College of Medicine and former president of the California Medical Assn . Bostick , who was an outspoken advocate of a failed 1992 ballot initiative to legalize physician-assisted suicide in California , predicted that the Michigan decision is &quot; the beginning of a modest but steady tide that will move from state to state and finally develop the kind of alternative within a framework that will be acceptable to people in general. &quot; He said that in Holland , the idea of physician-assisted suicide for the terminally ill was accepted by the courts long before the country ' s legislators passed enabling legislation . Perhaps , he said , the United States will follow the same path . But Dr. Ronald B . Miller , director of the Program in Medical Ethics at the UCI College of Medicine , said he believes the jury was mistaken if it was convinced by Kevorkian ' s argument that his main objective was to stop his patient ' s suffering . &quot; If one were intending to relieve muscle pain , one would use morphine and not carbon_monoxide , &quot; he said . &quot; Carbon_monoxide is a lethal gas and not a medication used to relieve pain. &quot; Miller said while it may be ethically justified for a physician or nurse to increase the dosage of morphine to lessen the pain of a dying patient , even if there is a chance that a higher dose might suppress breathing and hasten death , there is no justification to use carbon_monoxide , which will inevitably cause death . Dr. Melvyn Sterling , president of the Orange County Medical Assn . and director of the Visiting Nurse Assn . of Orange County ' s hospice program , said although he opposes the legalization of physician-assisted suicide , he greatly respects Kevorkian and believes he has done a service in making the medical_profession more aware of the need to alleviate the pain of the dying . &quot; I think Dr. Kevorkian is a brave man , &quot; Sterling said . &quot; I think he is a smart man , and he has focused national attention on the problem of providing appropriate palliative care . But I personally think it is more appropriate for us to devote our energies to relieving suffering rather than taking the easy way out. &quot; Sterling and Miller said while there are methods for relieving the pain of terminally ill patients , many doctors and nurses don ' t use them effectively . &quot; I think the public is speaking loud and clear , and this jury is speaking loud and clear , that we are not doing our job adequately , &quot; Miller said . Among those who supported the jury decision was Craig B . Coogan , executive_director of the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center of Orange County , who said his position had been shaped in part by his close contact with people suffering from AIDS . &quot; Definitely , you are more sensitized to what disease does to the human_body and human spirit , and this ruling implies those people now have control , &quot; Coogan said . &quot; The implication ( of the jury decision ) is that people are now being given the dignity to choose how they live and how they die. &quot;</TEXT>
