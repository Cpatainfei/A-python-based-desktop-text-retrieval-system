A jury found James Centobene guilty of 22 felony counts of child molestation , including 15 that included substantial sexual contact such_as sodomy , oral copulation , masturbation and exposure to pornography . The jury also convicted the 29-year-old man of three misdemeanor counts of child annoyance , which stemmed from baths he took with the girl . The attacks occurred from January , 1991 , to January , 1992 , when the girl was 8 and 9 years old , Deputy Dist . Atty . Dee Corona said . She said the girl ' s teacher reported the attacks to authorities . The girl told her teacher about the attacks , authorities said . Judge James McNally handed_down the 48-year prison_term during a hearing in which Centobene claimed his lawyer did not properly represent him and requested a new trial . Centobene represented himself at the hearing . A probation report described Centobene as a &quot; very disturbed individual &quot; with a &quot; hostile attitude &quot; toward the charges he faced . &quot; Mr. Centobene deserves all_the time he can get , &quot; Corona said afterward . &quot; He never acknowledged responsibility. &quot; His wife , 33-year-old Elba Centobene , pleaded guilty to one count of perjury for lying during her husband ' s trial about having knowledge of the attacks on the girl .
