   <HEADLINE> ' WARM PEACE ' WITH ISRAEL MAY BE LONG_TIME COMING , JORDANIANS SAY ; DIPLOMACY : LEADERS CLAIM NATION IS PREPARED TO END YEARS OF ENMITY . BUT ANALYSTS KNOW CHANGING HEARTS WILL BE DIFFICULT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If all goes as planned , the Israeli flag -- for decades a hated symbol of this nation ' s worst enemy -- could be snapping in the breeze above a newly opened Israeli Embassy in just six weeks . Are Jordanians prepared_for such a spectacle ? Absolutely , according to Prime_Minister Abdul Salam Majali , who announced Tuesday that the Cabinet had that morning approved the peace_treaty initialed the day before with Israel . The Jordanian Parliament is expected to ratify the accord Saturday . &quot; The Jordanian people are well-prepared for peace ; they have believed_in peace for a long_time , &quot; Majali said confidently , when asked by a reporter about the psychological impact of Israel opening a mission here . But Sari Nasir , head of the sociology_department at Amman University , thinks that Majali and the government are too optimistic about the reception Israelis are likely to receive here . Nasir points_out that more_than 50 % of Jordanians are of Palestinian origin , and many Palestinians still feel their grievances against Israel have not been addressed . &quot; It is too_much , too soon , &quot; said Nasir . &quot; People need much more time to understand and digest what is happening . Will Israelis feel safe walking the streets of Amman ? If I were them , I would n ' t. &quot; Both Majali and Nasir are partially right . On an abstract level , Jordanians and Palestinian Jordanians appear to have accepted the process of rapprochement with Israel that began in October , 1991 , when the United States and Russia presided over the opening of Arab-Israeli negotiations in Madrid . In 1993 , they witnessed the signing of a framework for peace between Israel and the Palestinians . In July of this year , they saw King Hussein announce an end to the state of belligerency that had existed between the two countries for 46 years . Ask passersby on the streets of Amman whether they support the signing of a peace_treaty with Israel , and the response is generally favorable . But probe deeper , and Jordanians invariably dwell_on the economic benefits they expect will flow_from making_peace . There is no eagerness to get_to know the neighbors with whom Jordanians have fought two wars . &quot; My children believe that these people are devils and that they ought not to be accepted , &quot; said Nasir , a Palestinian whose family became refugees twice after the Jewish state was born in 1948 . As a child , Nasir fled with his family to East Jerusalem in 1948 . As a young_man , he fled from East Jerusalem to Amman after Israel captured the West_Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan in the June , 1967 , Arab-Israeli War . Even government officials acknowledge that they have trouble with the human side of peace . &quot; When Israel and Jordan opened the new border in the south last August , &quot; said Michel Hamarneh , the urbane director of Crown_Prince Hassan ' s office , &quot; I stood there at the ceremony , not knowing what to feel . In my mind , I had accepted this moment , I wanted it to happen . But all my life , I hated these people . I tried to inject hatred of them into my children. &quot; Hamarneh recalls that he could not bring himself to speak_to the Israeli officials seated on each side of him . Because most of the negotiating process that has occurred since Madrid has been carried_out behind closed doors , with the principals emerging only for periodic , historic signing ceremonies , the treaty that King Hussein intends to sign next Wednesday is one made between regimes , not peoples , said Nasir and other Jordanians . The sort of &quot; warm peace &quot; Israelis are hoping to build with Jordan will follow the formal treaty slowly , if at all , according to many Jordanians . &quot; You don ' t change attitudes overnight , &quot; Nasir said . &quot; There are so many people who have lost very dear ones , who have lost their villages , their social_structure . These people are very bitter. &quot; That bitterness , both Jordanian opposition figures and government officials agree , is unlikely to express itself in any violent form of protest . Hussein is a popular monarch , and his kingdom is well-managed by his security_forces . Opposition groups on the left and right are closely monitored and kept_in check . Palestinians , who under the Palestine Liberation Organization ' s leadership rose_up against the regime in 1970 , have in the past two decades become overwhelmingly middle_class and settled into society . &quot; There will be no riots in the streets , &quot; Hamarneh said . &quot; The Palestinians here would like to make the best of their lives here . They know that their dreams of returning to Palestine are finished. &quot; Palestinian refugee camps , where opposition might be expected to be the most fierce , are directly controlled by the security police , and have been_quiet since the initialing occurred . Islamic fundamentalists already have announced that they will vote against the treaty in Parliament on Saturday , but they hold only 16 seats and cannot block ratification . Leftists also are opposed , but across the spectrum opposition figures have taken pains to say their protests will be restricted to democratic expressions .</TEXT>
