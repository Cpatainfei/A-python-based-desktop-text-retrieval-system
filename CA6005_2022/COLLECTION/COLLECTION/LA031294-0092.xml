   <HEADLINE> PREEMPTIVE RAIDS ON NUCLEAR SITES REJECTED ; DEFENSE : PENTAGON OFFICIAL CLARIFIES POLICY AGAINST SPREAD OF ARMS . OLD METHODS TO BE KEPT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration ' s new plan to counter the spread of nuclear arms to Third_World countries does not include preemptive strikes at nuclear facilities , a top official said , countering suggestions by some policy-makers that such an option might exist . Ashton B . Carter , assistant secretary_of_defense for international security policy , said that those who believe that Washington might bomb such facilities before the country involved used its nuclear_weapons have &quot; misunderstood &quot; Washington ' s intentions . He also asserted that the Administration plan , unveiled last December , does not mean that Washington is abandoning traditional efforts to persuade such countries to give_up their nuclear_weapons . At a briefing last December -- and in charts and diagrams accompanying similar sessions -- officials hinted that preemptive strikes were a possibility . Carter also confirmed that the Pentagon is developing a way to verify the dismantling of U.S. and Russian nuclear_warheads and is considering the possibility of proposing it to Moscow in coming discussions . The plan would call_for each side to dismantle its warheads privately -- to protect their design secrets -- then to place the fissionable materials in special containers that would enable the other side to measure the amount of plutonium removed . By measuring the extracted plutonium , monitors could determine how many warheads had been dismantled , Carter said . He made his remarks as the Pentagon announced that Defense_Secretary William J . Perry plans to travel_to Russia , Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus on Wednesday for a week of meetings with officials about dismantling nuclear_weapons and transforming defense industries . His visit will be the first by a top Clinton foreign policy-maker since the arrest of CIA officer Aldrich H . Ames on charges of selling secrets to Moscow . Although both sides have sought to play_down the Ames affair , it has prompted calls_in Congress for a halt to aid for Russia . Carter ' s remarks were intended to correct what officials conceded had become a widespread impression of the new &quot; counter-proliferation &quot; policy -- that is , that the United States might preemptively bomb the arsenals of a potentially hostile emerging nuclear_power . Although the Administration has never threatened such action against any specific country , the idea of launching a preemptive strike -- a reversal of previous U.S. policy -- had drawn criticism among some Third_World governments . Carter made clear Friday that he was speaking only in_general terms and was not referring to North_Korea . Although Pyongyang often has been mentioned as a major threat among emerging nuclear_powers , Carter avoided discussing the North_Korean question . But , ironically , U.S. officials conceded that it had been Pentagon policy-makers who appeared responsible_for most of the impression that the Administration might launch preemptive strikes against nuclear targets . A senior defense official left just such an impression at a background briefing for reporters in December . And charts used in earlier briefings by Carter have cited &quot; destroying weapons-of-mass-destruction capabilities in peacetime deployment &quot; as an element of the plan . At the same time , then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin talked often about the need for a policy to contend with the kind of problem faced in the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War , when U.S. bombers were unable to destroy the nuclear warfare facilities of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein .</TEXT>
