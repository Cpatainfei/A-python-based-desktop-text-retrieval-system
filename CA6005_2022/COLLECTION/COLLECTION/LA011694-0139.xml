   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : IT ' S ALREADY TIME TO TAKE_STOCK IN EASTERN EUROPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most of the focus of President Clinton ' s trip to Europe last week was_on unfinished_business from the Cold_War -- the NATO alliance , nuclear armaments in Ukraine . But more revealing for the future , and perhaps surprising , is the fact that two heads_of_state who met with Clinton -- Presidents Lech Walesa of Poland and Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic -- preside over the fastest-growing economies in Europe . The Polish and Czech economies are small but their moderate success in adapting to a new_world after half a century of war and Cold_War offers insights on how totalitarian states can become market_economies and how their future development will broaden or undermine the European Union in this decade . Implications for U.S. policy and U.S. business are considerable . Economic success in Eastern Europe would deter the region from descending into Yugoslavia-style chaos and it would help Russia and the lands of the former Soviet_Union . Stability and security now &quot; depend as much on economic_conditions as on assurances against military threats &quot; write former Defense_Secretary Harold Brown and Charles Wolf Jr. , director of RAND Corp. , in a paper on the post-Cold War period . The world is turned upside down in Europe today . Germany is in a deep recession that economists say will last through 1995 . Volkswagen has gone_to a four-day week to share out work ; some of Germany ' s major companies are in financial trouble . The country ' s high wages , social benefits and taxes are blamed for sapping economic vitality . &quot; Our social market system is bankrupt , &quot; declares Norbert Walter , chief economist of the Deutsche Bank . Meanwhile , East Europeans who work for less are getting the jobs . The Czech Republic ' s famed Skoda Works , now partly owned by Volkswagen , is working overtime to turn_out a car that sells briskly for less than $ 5 # 000 in Germany and other countries . Its workers make roughly one-tenth the pay and benefits of Volkswagen ' s German employees . The Czech Republic is doing quite well , even though most of its products are formally shut_out of the huge EU market . Following the split with Slovakia last year , it is now a country of 10.3 million people with a gross_national_product of $ 38.4 billion that is poised to grow 4 % in 1994 . Foreign investors have poured $ 2.3 billion so far into ventures in Poland , according to J.P. Morgan &amp; Co . Pepsico acquired a chocolate and cookie company and turned it into a local base for Frito-Lay . And Time Warner , Bertelsmann of Germany and a Luxembourg company are bidding for a commercial television channel . The Polish economy -- largest in Eastern Europe with 38 million people and a GNP of $ 70.6 billion -- may grow 5 % this year . Hungary , the other leading East European state , may have slower growth because EU restrictions hurt its agricultural exports . How did these countries adapt to a competitive world in just a_few years ? They encouraged foreign investment but did so in an unusual way . They used stock_markets . The Czech government handed its citizens vouchers of ownership in the state enterprises that were being privatized . Initially that seemed less than a brilliant idea , explains Charles Harman of Credit Suisse First Boston , who heads investment banking for Eastern Europe from offices in Prague and London . &quot; Trading was nonexistent because while everyone had shares no one had money to buy other shares . But foreign investors came_in , and it has developed_into an active market with roughly $ 50 million a week in transactions. &quot; And more to come . The Czech stock_exchange has just qualified for investments by the emerging markets mutual_funds that are sending so_much U.S. investment around the world . &quot; We anticipate an inflow , &quot; says Harman . In Poland there is a very active stock_market because the Poles have extra money thanks to remittances from Polish-Americans in the United States . that ' s also why a sizable consumer economy has developed in Poland . But make no mistake . Eastern Europe ' s fledgling economies are fragile and troubled . Inflation is a constant threat . In the Czech Republic it is now 12 % a year , but in Poland it runs at 30 % and more , says Susanne Gahler , the Morgan bank ' s chief economist for Eastern Europe . &quot; Stock_markets have helped with privatization , &quot; she says , &quot; but much of the real work of restructuring industries for productivity remains to be done. &quot; * The Eastern economies need markets , need access to the 12-nation European Union market specifically . But the EU has been unyielding in negotiations so far , maintaining restrictions against heavy machinery , textiles , agricultural produce . Sooner or later those restrictions will be relaxed . The East European states are like Mexico in one sense , developing economies on the border of a highly developed market . But East European education and skill levels allow them to turn_out higher_quality goods than most developing countries . Also , history is_on their side . For centuries before World_War_II , the lands that are now the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland were principal suppliers of agriculture and industrial goods to Germany and central Europe . Now they ' re trying to re-establish historic patterns . And as their costs are compared to the swollen costs of EU Europe , the Easterners will get business . As German industry restructures , it will certainly use Eastern suppliers more and more . * So the EU will either admit the East European states or dissolve itself in fractious internal disputes . The prospect is for a vibrant , enlarged market emerging in central Europe in this decade , with big opportunities for U.S. companies . And that future business could do for the next half century what NATO did for the postwar era now ended .</TEXT>
