   <HEADLINE> OFFSPRING : ON THE VERGE OF FULL-GROWN SUCCESS ; POP_MUSIC : THE OUTLOOK ' S BRIGHT FOR THE O.C. PUNKS , WHOSE SINGLE ' COME OUT AND PLAY ' IS GETTING TONS OF AIRPLAY AND WHOSE RECORD SALES ARE ZOOMING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As 1994 began , the Offspring were just another obscure punk band hoping they could make_it to the next gig without a mechanical breakdown . The bus motor would seize up_on the road to Bakersfield . The transmission would give_out en route to Arizona . When they finally got the engine rebuilt , the four band members drove across country on a winter tour , shivering all_the way because they couldn ' t get the heater to work . &quot; It was awful , but it would cost too_much to fix it , &quot; said drummer Ron Welty . &quot; We were punk about it. &quot; With its school_bus body still bearing the green paint job and Holiday Inn logo from its previous incarnation as a hotel shuttle , the Offspring ' s chariot now sits ready in a cul-de-sac in a peaceful suburban subdivision . This time it has to be in good working order : Suddenly , the Offspring appear to be going places . A few weeks ago , alternative-rock station KROQ put the band ' s song &quot; Come Out and Play &quot; into regular rotation , playing it every three or four hours . That rare break for a punk band on a small , independent label already is having a ripple effect . Following KROQ ' s lead , stations around the country are picking_up on this insinuating , deftly constructed track . The Offspring ' s fortunes had been_on the rise even before &quot; Come Out and Play &quot; started generating numerous request calls from KROQ listeners . While band members Welty , Bryan Holland , Greg Kriesel and Kevin Wasserman were trying to stay warm on their bus last winter , sales of their 1992 release , &quot; Ignition , &quot; were heating_up . The Offspring ' s label , Epitaph Records , had managed to place several songs from the album with producers who make action videos for fans of surfing , snowboarding and skateboarding . * The payoff was almost immediate . According to Holland , the band ' s singer and songwriter , in a matter of four months sales shot from 16 # 000 to 46 # 000 -- an impressive total for an independent punk release . &quot; We were selling to the punkers , and we hit this group of people we didn ' t know existed , &quot; Holland said . &quot; They ' re real enthusiastic , and there ' s tons of them . It ' s a pleasant surprise. &quot; There was only one drawback as the Offspring began delving into surf-skate-snowboard culture : Newly introduced to the sport , Welty broke his right arm about a month ago on a snowboarding run at Big Bear . He was punk about it , though : When the Offspring were flown to Valdez , Alaska , recently to play_at a snowboarding convention , Welty , who couldn ' t hold a stick , kept the beat by attaching one to his cast . When &quot; Smash , &quot; the band ' s third album , came_out in mid-April , there was a substantial corps of new fans waiting for it . Andy Kaulkin , Epitaph ' s marketing director , says 75 # 000 copies have been shipped to stores . The label , which has been hailed for its ability to top the 100 # 000 sales mark with hard-core faves Bad Religion and Pennywise , smells the possibility of a hit that could cross over to the much larger alternative crowd ( as always , MTV will be the final arbiter of that ) . Billboard ' s &quot; Heatseekers &quot; chart , which maps the progress of new and developing artists , pegged &quot; Smash &quot; as the hottest-selling record in that category in the Pacific region last week and placed it at No . 16 nationally . Major labels are already sniffing around , as they have been wont_to do with promising indie bands since Nirvana showed how lucrative a melodic , punk-leaning sound could be . The Offspring don ' t seem to be letting any of this go_to their heads . Sitting around a table last weekend in the pleasant , walled-in back yard of the home where bassist Kriesel grew_up , they came_off as a relaxed , down-to-earth , good-natured bunch who are eager to see what happens next but have no great hankering for rock stardom . After playing in obscurity for most of their 10-year existence , the Offspring see a touch of absurdity in their suddenly unfolding success . Wasserman was nonplussed after Holland finished quoting the band ' s KROQ airplay statistics : &quot; A tinny little punk band from O.C. ? &quot; The Offspring seem an unlikely bunch to be playing punk_rock , let alone making a success of it . * With his long , blond hair and pink and dimpled cheeks , Holland looks more like a candidate to play John Boy in a remake of &quot; The Waltons &quot; than somebody you ' d expect to see howling above a teeming mosh pit . At 28 , he is a doctoral candidate in microbiology at USC , but if he ever went_back to the band ' s common alma_mater , Pacifica High_School in Garden Grove , the cherubic rocker would probably be asked to produce a hall_pass . He uses &quot; Dexter &quot; as his stage_name : &quot; I thought ' Dexter ' was cool , because it ' s geeky , &quot; he explained . Lead guitarist Wasserman , 31 , wears eyeglasses with thick frames , and his hair falls far down his back -- two things he has in common with that bona_fide geek , Garth of &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; fame . Drummer Welty is 23 and boyish despite his Vandyke beard . Kriesel , 29 , has intense , deep-set eyes and a clipped haircut , making him the only member who looks the punker type . Nevertheless , the Offspring ' s punk roots run deep , and are largely home-grown . In high_school , when an older brother brought_home some early Orange County punk records , Holland was smitten by the melodic sound of such bands as Agent_Orange , the Adolescents and T.S.O.L. Kriesel , his buddy from the school cross-country team , soon came_to share his enthusiasm . Killing time one night in 1984 after failing to get_into a sold-out Social Distortion concert at UC Irvine , the two decided to take_up instruments and start their own band . They called it Manic Subsidal , then changed the name to the Offspring when they got nothing but blank looks ( &quot; Manic Sub-what ? &quot; ) from the few folks who even took_notice . Wasserman joined in 1985 , and Welty , all_of 16 at the time , took_over on drums in 1987 . The other members had to get his grandmother ' s permission before they could take him on road trips . For its first album , in 1990 , the band sought_out producer Thom Wilson , wanting to work with the man who had overseen favorite recordings by the Adolescents , T.S.O.L. , the Vandals and Dead Kennedys . By then , Wilson was making his living as an audio engineer for network television_shows and hadn ' t produced a punk record in years . But he was flattered that the Offspring were fans of his work , and he saw possibilities in the band . &quot; They were very raw , but they had a real spark of promise that I recognized immediately , &quot; Wilson said from his home near Santa Cruz . &quot; I liked the way they phrased things , the germ ideas of songs. &quot; By 1992 , Holland had learned to craft catchy , sing-along chorus melodies for songs that typically offer acerbic but alert commentaries on everything from geopolitics to relationship pitfalls to the difficulty of remaining an individual in a world that rewards conformity . After striking out_in efforts to land a record deal , the band caught the ear of Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz , who signed them to his label , Epitaph . About half of &quot; Ignition &quot; rose above standard hard-core pummeling . With &quot; Smash , &quot; the Offspring have come_into their own with a full album ' s worth of solid songs . Many of the tracks feature not just one good musical hook but several , and Holland carries them with an interesting voice , part reedy and part chesty , that calls to mind a less bleaty Ozzy Osbourne . Continuing to work with producer Wilson on all three albums , the Offspring learned to arrange their material in a way that seduces as well as it hammers ; the band can deliver an aural bludgeoning when it counts but also can hold and surprise the listener with a progression of musical ideas . &quot; Come Out and Play &quot; is an especially strong example . It starts with a sparse , funky beat , then tosses_in a catchy , quotable spoken tag_line -- &quot; you gotta keep ' em separated &quot; -- that any rapper would love to have come_up with . Next , the band uncoils a snaky , Arabic guitar figure inspired by Agent_Orange by way of Dick Dale ' s &quot; Misirlou. &quot; Then it gets_into meaty rock guitar rhythms that recall the Kinks ' &quot; Destroyer. &quot; With all this going on , the lyrics are secondary , but they deliver a sardonic broadside against the idiocy of settling disputes with gunplay : By the time you hear the siren , it ' s already too late . One goes_to the morgue , and the other to jail , One guy ' s wasted , and the other ' s a waste . With success looming , the Offspring are starting to make certain adjustments . The band is preparing_for a degree of backlash from those in the punk crowd who think any exposure beyond the hard-core clique amounts to betrayal . &quot; that ' s unique to punk , &quot; Holland said . &quot; As soon as you get popular , there ' s a small part of the audience that will turn against you : ' Those guys are_on KROQ now . I hate ' em. ' &quot; Mounting sales have allowed Welty to quit his job at a muffin shop and Kriesel to stop working as a printer . &quot; My girlfriend and parents are actually excited now because they think I ' m going_to buy them things , &quot; Welty said . Wasserman , the head custodian at an elementary_school , is taking a leave_of_absence . Like Welty , he has a young child to support . * Holland is the one left in something of a bind . The rock ' n ' roll road beckons , but so do the viruses he is trying to clone in his doctoral research . ( It ' s a nice irony that one of the first Orange County punk songs widely heard on KROQ was &quot; Amoeba , &quot; the 1980 Adolescents anthem in which a sentient microbe , symbolic of hounded punk youth , plots vengeance against the scientist who has been treating it as a worthless specimen . Now punk is mainstream and respectable , and the author and singer of the latest local punk hit is , in fact , a scientist who pokes around with microbes . Holland hopes his virus-cloning research will have applications in the treatment of genetic diseases. ) Holland said he called Greg Graffin , Bad Religion ' s singer , for advice on juggling punk_rock and academia . Graffin is pursuing a doctorate in evolutionary biology at Cornell . &quot; It ' s hard to do both , &quot; Holland said . &quot; He took a leave_of_absence . I don ' t think I could get_away with it &quot; because his studies require regular laboratory work . &quot; If it comes_down to it , I ' m going_to quit school , because I don ' t want to pass_up what ' s happening now. &quot; * The Offspring and Guttermouth play May 26 at the Whisky , 8901 Sunset Blvd. , West Hollywood . Show time : 8 p.m. $ 13 . ( 714 ) 740-2000 ( Ticketmaster ) .</TEXT>
