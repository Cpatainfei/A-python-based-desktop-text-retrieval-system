   <HEADLINE> 113 # 000 SIGNATURES BACK EL TORO AIRPORT VOTE ; BASE REUSE : SUPPORTERS OF COMMERCIAL FACILITY SAY VOTERS SHOULD DECIDE ISSUE IN NOVEMBER . THEY CITE POTENTIAL FOR JOBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Promising that it would lead to thousands of jobs , supporters of a proposed initiative to require converting the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station to a commercial airport filed a 113 # 000-signature petition Wednesday to put the measure on the November ballot . Backers of the initiative needed to collect 66 # 703 valid signatures of registered voters by Wednesday to qualify the proposal -- called the Orange County / El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative -- for the general_election ballot . If approved by voters , the proposal would change the county ' s land-use plan to allow the development of a commercial airport at El Toro on 2 # 000 acres of the 4 # 700-acre base and require the building of the airport . The measure is sponsored by a coalition of business and political_leaders who are relying_on the jobs issue to carry the day . The group calls itself Committee for 21 # 000 New Jobs and contends that a new airport would create 21 # 645 new jobs in Orange County and generate $ 170 million annually for local_governments . On Wednesday , Newport Beach businessman George L . Argyros and Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) , two high-profile initiative supporters , said they are siding with blue-collar workers in their backing of the initiative . &quot; Are we going_to stand_up for the working people of this county ? &quot; Rohrabacher said . Argyros , who made millions as a developer , said a commercial airport at El Toro that could also handle cargo &quot; will create a job machine that will last 100 years. &quot; At the same time that Argyros and his group were pushing boxes of signed petitions into the County Registrar of Voters office , another group of business_leaders and elected officials were holding their own news_conference across town to announce opposition to the initiative . Members of the group stressed that they do not oppose the idea of building a commercial airport at El Toro . Rather , they said it would be unwise to decide the base ' s future at the ballot_box rather than through an orderly and complete planning process , which the county is currently doing . In addition to mandating building of the airport , the proposed ballot measure would set_up a 13-member advisory commission made_up of elected officials , aviation experts , private citizens and representatives from labor and business groups to advise the Board of Supervisors on building the airport and developing the rest of the base . Sponsors of the initiative said they do not trust the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority -- the county agency sanctioned to study redevelopment options for the base -- to make an unbiased decision on whether to convert the Marine base to a commercial airport . The nine-member county board includes four representatives from Irvine and Lake Forest , where opposition to the proposed airport is strong . Rohrabacher labeled opponents of the initiative &quot; a vocal minority watching_out for their own interests. &quot; Supporters expressed confidence that the measure will qualify for the ballot and brushed_aside a recent Times Orange County Poll that showed almost 60 % of local voters opposed the initiative . However , they acknowledged that , so far , voters are not swayed by promises that a new airport would lead to more jobs . &quot; It ' s vital that we talk directly to the voters and let them know what the issues are , &quot; Rohrabacher said . Initiative backers argued Wednesday that the measure is necessary because all county residents deserve a voice in the decision about El Toro ' s future . Presently , the base ' s future is being discussed only in concert with issues that affect surrounding cities like Irvine and Lake Forest , they said . &quot; Is this really a local issue or a regional issue ? &quot; said Argyros . &quot; We need to let all voters of Orange County participate in this debate. &quot; But initiative opponents , including Laguna Hills businessman Bill Kogerman and Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow , said they supported the county planning authority ' s plan to study various reuse proposals in conjunction with local municipalities and business groups before making a final_decision . &quot; The proposed initiative is bad government , &quot; said Kogerman , co-chair of the group , which billed itself as &quot; grass roots. &quot; &quot; The whole idea of land planning through an initiative is totally inappropriate. &quot; Others at Wednesday ' s news_conference held by opponents echoed that view , including Supervisor Thomas F . Riley , who helped develop the county-sponsored planning authority for El Toro . &quot; I think the ( county ) organization ' s goal is to come_up with the best land use , &quot; Riley said . &quot; We want to do the best planning job. &quot; Group members noted that the county process calls_for open public meetings and that a final reuse decision would be made by a panel of elected officials .</TEXT>
