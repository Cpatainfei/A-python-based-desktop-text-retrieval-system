   <HEADLINE> CELESTIAL COMMUTER SHOW ; TUESDAY ' S SOLAR ECLIPSE WILL BE LAST OF THE CENTURY HERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the height of the morning rush_hour Tuesday , the shadow of the moon will race across Los Angeles in the last solar_eclipse visible here for the rest of the century . Almost everyone in North_America will have a chance to watch the moon partially eclipse the sun . But , weather permitting , those watching from within a narrow band 150 miles wide , running from Baja California through southern New Mexico to northern New England , will see an even rarer sky spectacle : an annular_eclipse in which the moon will blot_out all but the sun ' s fiery rim , creating a kind of golden solar wedding_band . Such a celestial portent in February , 1831 , reportedly inspired Nat Turner , who led America ' s largest slave rebellion . At the height of the partial_eclipse in Los Angeles on Tuesday , almost four-fifths of the sun will be blotted_out at 9 a.m. Morning sunshine will turn_to twilight . As the source of light in the sky shrinks , shadows will sharpen . In the shade of leafy trees , the ground will be dappled with hundreds of bright , dancing crescents caused by the eclipse , as overlapping leaves_form a profusion of natural pinhole projectors . &quot; As far as astronomers in_general are concerned , most eclipses are not of great scientific value , but they are of great aesthetic value and great emotional value , &quot; said Griffith Observatory Director Edwin C . Krupp . In all , the eclipse here will last about 2 hours and 45 minutes , beginning at 7:44 a.m. and ending at 10:29 a.m. &quot; You will have the thinnest crescent sun that we will see for the duration of the century , &quot; Krupp said . &quot; One could even say it was just like the crescent moon if it were not so bright and so dangerous to view directly. &quot; Astronomers warn that anyone looking directly at the eclipse risks serious eye damage unless they use proper safety filters , such_as No . 14 welder ' s goggles or special solar Mylar filters . Parents should keep young children from looking_at the sun . Even though most of the sun ' s light will be blocked , the remaining sunlight is still too intense even to be viewed briefly . The retina of the eye has no pain receptors , so the damage can happen without warning . * People can safely view the eclipse indirectly by projecting its image through a pinhole camera or by reflecting it with a pocket mirror onto a shaded wall . Even though the eclipse will take_place during rush_hour , Caltrans is not worried . Spokesman Vincent Moreno said that Caltrans data indicates that motorists -- who appear to be willing to slow_down and gawk at almost anything -- actually are rather picky when it comes_to rubbernecking and generally will slow only for phenomena in their immediate line_of_vision . The last eclipse did not cause a celestial gawkers block , he said , because commuters would have had to look_up_to see it . A solar_eclipse occurs somewhere around the world two to five times a year . It happens when the moon moving_in its orbit around the Earth occasionally slips_in between the planet and the central star that lights it . Although the sun is about 400 times larger than the moon , it also is almost 400 times farther away from the Earth , so that the two appear about the same size when viewed from Earth . Most eclipses are partial ones because the moon and the sun are not always perfectly in phase . When the moon is at the farthest reaches of its orbit , it can cause an annular_eclipse when it passes in front of the sun because its disk is slightly smaller than that of the sun , as seen from Earth . The last annular_eclipse visible in the region occurred two years ago -- a rare late-afternoon eclipse that , for those lucky enough to experience clear skies , combined the ring of solar fire with the colors of sunset . Tuesday ' s event will be the last time people in the United States will see an annular_eclipse for 18 years . Not until May 20 , 2012 , will the moon again appear to pass within the sun , as viewed from the western United States , and it will be another seven years after that before the moon completely blocks the sun from view . Darkness in the Morning Late rush-hour commuters will be treated to a partial , or annular , eclipse of the sun beginning at 7:44 a.m. Tuesday . In Los Angeles at the height of the eclipse , the sun will appear to be 72 % covered . It will be the last eclipse visible in Southern California for the rest of this century . Comparing Views * The trademark solar_halo will be visible in El Paso , which is almost directly centered_on the path of annularity . Other cities along the path , such_as St . Louis , will see an offset ring . The ring is visible only momentarily . * From Southern California , the sun will be about four-fifths covered , with coverage increasing toward the southernmost part of the state . Annular vs . Total_Eclipses In an annular_eclipse , the moon is silhouetted briefly in front of the sun but is too far from Earth to completely cover the sun . Total_eclipses are spectacular , with a very dark sky and flaring solar corona . These occur when the moon is closer to Earth and can completely blot_out the sun . L.A. Eclipse Schedule 5:56 a.m. : Sunrise 7:44 a.m. : Eclipse begins . The moon begins to move_in front of the sun . 9 a.m. : Maximum eclipse . The moon covers 72 % of the sun ' s surface . 10:29 a.m. : Eclipse ends . Moon leaves the face of the sun . Avoiding Eye Injury Any eclipse , even a total one , has the potential to cause eye injury because the visible sunlight is still far too intense even for brief glances . Here are some tips : * Create a pinhole camera by making a tiny hole in a sheet of heavy paper and using it to project the sun ' s image onto a second sheet_of_paper held below . The image is faint but discernible . * Use a pocket mirror to reflect the sun ' s image onto the shaded wall of a building . * Hang_out with the experts . The Griffith Observatory will be open from 7 a.m. Specially fitted telescopes will be provided by the observatory , the Los Angeles Astronomical Society and local clubs . Sources : Griffith Observatory , Astronomy magazine Where the Eclipse Can Be Seen * Weather permitting , the eclipse will be visible across North_America in a path moving from southwest to northeast . * The moon ' s shadow will take one hour and 40 minutes to cross the country . The portion of the sun obscured by the moon decreases with distance from the path of annularity .</TEXT>
