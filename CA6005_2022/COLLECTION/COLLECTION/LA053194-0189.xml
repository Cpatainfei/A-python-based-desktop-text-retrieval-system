   <HEADLINE> POPE REAFFIRMS HIS STAND : NO WOMEN PRIESTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a stern veto , Pope John Paul II reasserted a ban against women priests Monday , ordering Catholics to end internal debate and obey historic teachings . In a righteous , authoritarian apostolic letter addressed to his bishops , John Paul marked his first day back in the office after four weeks in a hospital for a broken leg . His resounding &quot; no &quot; to any possibility of a greater religious role for Catholic women in their church was the second time in a week that the Vatican has crossed swords with assertive Catholic women . Before returning to the Vatican on Friday , the Pope accepted an English translation of the church ' s new catechism that women ' s groups have denounced as sexist for its language . Monday ' s 1 # 000-word letter , &quot; On Reserving Priestly Ordination to Men Alone , &quot; is remarkable for its bluntness and the absolute authority that John Paul asserts &quot; in_order that all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great importance. &quot; &quot; I declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held for all_the church ' s faithful , &quot; he writes in the letter . Fundamentals of their faith make_it impossible to ordain women as priests , the Pope tells his bishops , noting that Jesus &quot; acted in a completely free and sovereign manner &quot; in selecting only men as his apostles -- the first priests . Still , John Paul laments , despite an all-male priesthood unbroken across two millennia , &quot; in some places it is nonetheless considered open_to debate. &quot; No more , in the Pope ' s view . An accompanying Vatican commentary said the letter &quot; confirms a certainty which has been constantly held and lived_by the church. &quot; As such , the Pope ' s views are not to be regarded_as new , or an opinion , or a matter of discipline , &quot; but as certainly true. &quot; &quot; Therefore , since it does not belong_to matters freely open_to dispute , it always requires the full and unconditional assent of the faithful , and to teach the contrary is equivalent_to leading consciences into error , &quot; his commentary says . John Paul , 74 , who has been increasingly outspoken in recent months , will host a private meeting at the Vatican on Thursday with President Clinton , who may get a papal lecture about his support for abortion . In a debate the Vatican no longer wants to hear among Catholics , advocates of women priests say Jesus ' choice of disciples was determined by customs and laws of the time , not because he sought a unisex ministry . John Paul ' s vigorous restatement of the ban may have been prompted in part by the ordination of the Church_of_England ' s first women priests in March , an innovation that effectively scuttled reunification talks between the two churches . Thousands of Anglicans and hundreds of Anglican priests have turned_to Catholicism . The Vatican is even accepting married Anglican priests as converts -- and priests -- despite its own ban on married priests . Lobbying among Catholic activists for women priests has increased since the Anglican ordinations , a Vatican official noted . John Paul has now fired an unanswerable broadside in response . &quot; The Pope clearly intends for the ban to stick , because he comes right up_to the brink of infallibility with this teaching . Still , it is not infallible , and therefore it is open_to possible change by some later Pope , &quot; said one senior theologian . Under Catholic dogma , Popes are infallible in matters of faith and morals when they say they are giving infallible teachings . John Paul has never given one . The number of women joining orders of Catholic nuns has fallen dramatically in industrialized countries in the last 20 years , and a recent survey of nuns showed that many felt they are underutilized in the man ' s world of their church . Revisiting themes he addressed in a 1988 letter on the role of women in the church , the Pope said the fact that Mary , Jesus ' mother , did not become a priest , &quot; clearly shows that the non-admission of women to priestly ordination cannot mean that women are of lesser dignity , or can it be construed as discrimination against them. &quot; Although women may_not become priests , their role in the church remains &quot; absolutely necessary and irreplaceable , &quot; in the Pope ' s view . Quoting a 1977 Vatican statement rejecting priesthood for women , he says that &quot; Christian women should become fully aware of the greatness of their mission : Today , their role is of capital importance both for the renewal and humanization of society and for the rediscovery by believers of the true face of the church. &quot; Although it has been inflexible on expanding the role of women to the ministry , last month the Vatican agreed to U.S. demands that altar girls serve at Roman_Catholic Masses where the local bishop and parish priest agree . Vatican spokesmen stressed at the time , however , that the decision was not a new initiative but rather &quot; an interpretation of existing church law. &quot; &quot; This decision has nothing to do with ordained ministry , which has a different juridical and doctrinal nature , &quot; papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said then . &quot; It would be wrong to interpret this as the first_step toward women priests. &quot; On Monday , John Paul himself hammered the point home : The Roman_Catholic_Church will launch its third millennium with a men-only priesthood .</TEXT>
