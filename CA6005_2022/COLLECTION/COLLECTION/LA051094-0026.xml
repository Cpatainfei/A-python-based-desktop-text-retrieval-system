   <HEADLINE> SOUTH_AFRICA OFFERS ITSELF AS A MODEL ; MANDELA : ' THROUGH DEMOCRACY , ( MAKING ) THE WORLD SAFE FOR DIVERSITY ' IS A KEY GOAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We are , to use a famous phrase from another transition in history , present at the creation . Because this is so , there is a need to develop a sense of orderliness in the world . To do so , a direct link needs to be established between responsible membership of the community of nations and global stability and progress . The converse is also true ; if countries want to enjoy the rights of community , they need to act responsibly . Philosophers teach that the rights of citizenship follow from the sharing of_values in the common cause . As we prepare_for the new century , each country needs to build_upon a set of common properties that will aim to anchor it within the ambit of a legitimate new_world order . The test of South_Africa ' s foreign_policy in this context will be found in the quality of its domestic politics . My government wants South_Africa to be a symbol of a world in which diverse people can live_in peace . The quality , too , of the government will be reflected in our foreign_policy . South_Africa will be among those countries whose efforts are to promote and foster democratic systems of government . This is especially important in Africa , and our concerns will be fixed on securing the spirit of tolerance and the ethos of sound governance throughout the continent . South_Africa ' s global destiny is linked to maintaining vigilance around the same precepts that united the world against apartheid , which were able to distinguish between principle and prejudice , which separated ethics from expedience , ingenuity from ineptitude . Because the world community is in search of stability , our experience suggests that we dare not relinquish the commitment to human_rights in international affairs . Global change has , if anything , heightened the salience of the issue . The unfolding tragedies , from Sarajevo to Rwanda , whose images are the lifeblood of the electronic media , underpin the importance of respect for human_rights in securing our common future . While governments should be mindful of the high ideals of human_rights , they should be conscious of a democratic realism that surrounds the issue , too . The neglect of human_rights is a certain recipe for internal and international disaster . The powerful secessionist movements that are found throughout the world are nurtured by neglect . The erosion of national sovereignty by global forces , from trade to communications , has been accompanied by an increase in the means to ensure its separateness : The right to differ has , tragically , become the fight to differ . The violent breakup of states points to the horrors facing countries in Africa and elsewhere that are not prepared to accept that diversity is integral to the human condition . These failed states will fall prey to greater internecine strife that will sap , if not destroy , the potential of their people . Many believe this fate beckons my own country . They are thoroughly wrong . Few people on Earth have experienced intolerance as have South_Africans . Even in the darkest days of apartheid and the most tragic moments of our turbulent transition , South_Africans of all colors and creeds have , with great courage , shown respect for difference . A central goal of South_Africa ' s foreign_policy , like its domestic politics , will be to promote institutions and forces that , through democracy , seek to make the world safe for diversity .</TEXT>
