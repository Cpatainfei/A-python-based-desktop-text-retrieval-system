   <HEADLINE> EU VOTERS TURN AGAINST ESTABLISHED PARTIES ; EUROPE : GOVERNMENTS IN BRITAIN , FRANCE AND SPAIN RECEIVE SHARP REBUKES . AUSTRIANS OK MEMBERSHIP BY 2 TO 1 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Voters in 12 nations selecting a new European Parliament turned against established parties in greater numbers than ever before and delivered sharp rebukes to ruling governments in Britain , France and Spain , according to preliminary results Sunday . Only in Germany , where Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s Christian Democrats gave an unexpected drubbing to the main opposition Social Democrats , did a major ruling party achieve a real victory . As counting continued early today , the strong showing of Britain ' s Labor_Party seemed to be enough to enable socialist-leaning parties to remain the largest single grouping in the 567-seat Parliament . The Parliament , which acts_as the legislative arm of the 12-nation European Union , is not as strong as national assemblies . But it recently gained new powers , including veto rights on key EU appointments and a degree of control on issues such_as education , the environment and consumer affairs . But with European issues often confusing and the Parliament itself a remote body , turnouts were generally low , frequently below 50 % . &quot; The absenteeism is worrying , &quot; said Jacques Delors , president of the EU ' s Executive Commission . &quot; There can only be a ( united ) Europe if people show an interest in it. &quot; The Austrians seemed to have that enthusiasm , as voters participating in a national referendum accepted , by more_than a surprising 2-1 margin , the terms of entry into the EU next January . Austria ' s ringing endorsement of EU membership is likely to brighten the chances that similar referendums will pass in Finland , Sweden and Norway later this year . Nations voting Sunday were Belgium , France , Germany , Greece , Italy , Luxembourg , Portugal and Spain . Britain , Ireland , Denmark and the_Netherlands voted Thursday . Final results are expected today . In most countries , the voting was a barometer of national government popularity . In Spain , where a series of scandals has rocked the government in recent months , Prime_Minister Felipe Gonzalez ' s ruling Socialists were headed for defeat for the first time since he rose to leadership 12 years ago , trailing the conservative Popular Party by 40 % to 30 % . In Britain , where Prime_Minister John Major ' s Conservative government has lurched from crisis to crisis , the opposition Labor_Party was_on its way to taking about 60 of Britain ' s 87 European seats . Such a victory would give Labor the largest contingent of seats from any national party and would keep the assembly ' s socialist group as the largest voting bloc . Italian voters once again rejected the traditional mainstream parties , giving an endorsement to Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi . &quot; This has shown that ( voters ) want to judge politicians not by labels but by the nature of their actions , &quot; Berlusconi said . Only in Germany was the picture different . With computer projections showing Kohl ' s ruling coalition winning 48 of Germany ' s 99 seats in the new Parliament -- and with the Christian Democrats also doing unexpectedly well in local elections held_in five German states Sunday -- the chancellor seemed on course to once again defy the country ' s political pundits . Almost universally , they had written_off his bid for an unprecedented fourth term as chancellor next October . In France , the mainstream conservatives lost strength while the Socialists slipped below 15 % . Ultra-right parties did_well in Belgium , but they fared poorly elsewhere . Germany ' s extreme-right-wing Republicans disappeared from the Parliament completely , unable to muster the necessary 5 % .</TEXT>
