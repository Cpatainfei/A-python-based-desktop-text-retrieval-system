   <HEADLINE> AUDIT CALLS FOR TIGHTER FISCAL CONTROL AT CAL POLY ; EDUCATION : IRREGULARITIES WERE CAUSED BY MISCOMMUNICATIONS , INEXPERIENCE AND LACK OF OVERSIGHT , REPORT STATES . IT SAYS THE VIOLATIONS WERE ISOLATED INCIDENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An audit of two departments at Cal Poly Pomona found personnel and policy violations and recommends that the university tighten financial controls at two campus offices . The report by the accounting_firm Deloitte &amp; Touche said the violations appear to have resulted from miscommunications , inexperience , lack of information and lack of appropriate guidance . It called the violations isolated incidents . Cal Poly President Bob Suzuki said in a statement that he was pleased that only minor problems were uncovered . He called the violations &quot; honest mistakes made by people trying their best to do their jobs. &quot; The irregularities were revealed in Times articles last year that detailed how friends of Suzuki were hired to promote the university in Asia . Henry and Jennifer Whang received $ 239 # 569 in salary , commissions and travel expenses during a year in which they took eight business trips to Asia . The California State University chancellor ' s office recommended the audit after policy violations were found in Cal Poly ' s continuing education office and its educational foundation , which raises money and runs the bookstores and cafeteria . The audit found that Cal Poly had acted inappropriately by paying Jennifer Whang a 15 % commission for each foreign student she recruited , in addition to her base salary of $ 3 # 430 per month . The recruitment was part of her job description , the report said , and should not have provided extra money for her . International travel claims submitted by the Whangs in 1991 and 1992 &quot; occasionally had incomplete supporting records , &quot; the audit said , because of a convoluted accounting_system that allowed the couple to submit some claims through the university and others through the foundation . In some cases , the audit also found that international travel took_place without the required approval of deans or vice_presidents . On numerous occasions , travelers , including the dean of continuing education , Van Garner , submitted claims for fellow_travelers , the audit found . &quot; While these do not reflect a consistent pattern , there were isolated instances which should be avoided in the future , &quot; the report stated . The audit also provided a glimpse into the workings of Cal Poly ' s foundation and its continuing education_department , which are normally not open_to public scrutiny because they are separate , self-sustaining arms of the university not bound by public disclosure laws . According to the audit , the continuing education_department established two accounts totaling $ 55 # 000 to hold and disburse discretionary funds . The audit stated that some payments to the Whangs involved transfers of funds from these accounts , which the audit said has raised some concerns . The report recommended closing the accounts and transferring the money into a more tightly controlled reserve_account . The audit also found that some students paid the continuing education_department in cash . That procedure , which was questioned , has been discontinued and cash transactions are now handled by the campus cashier , the audit found . The Deloitte &amp; Touche audit , released April 25 , made several recommendations , including that Cal Poly : * Require the foundation ' s executive_director to approve all continuing education disbursements above $ 5 # 000 . * Require the foundation ' s executive_director and the vice_president for academic affairs to review all travel budgets proposed by the dean of continuing education . * Appoint a foundation travel coordinator to provide information on policy regarding per diems and air transportation . * Appoint an employment liaison between academic and administration departments to avoid mistakes such_as the compensation paid to Jennifer Whang . In closing , the report found that the foundation , which has been without a controller for more_than a year , would benefit from better financial leadership . Cal Poly ' s foundation is considering hiring a budget director . In his statement , Suzuki said the school will implement the audit ' s recommendations .</TEXT>
