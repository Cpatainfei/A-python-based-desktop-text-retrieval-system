   <TEXT> The RAND Corp. , internationally famous for its Cold War-era defense analyses , has opened a Middle_East studies center , hoping to adopt its regional and social_policy expertise to the pursuit of peace in the war-torn area . &quot; The striking aspect of the region is its sheer dysfunctionality , its retarded human progress , which poses great risks for the world , &quot; said David Gombert , a RAND vice_president . &quot; We can bring a wide range of talent in resource management , labor issues , education and the environment to the area. &quot; RAND officials said the new center reflects the think_tank ' s move away from military_issues toward civilian concerns . &quot; We hope to influence individuals and institutions in the Middle_East by setting_up conferences , exchange programs , visiting scholar projects and seminars to discuss the area ' s mutual problems and interests , &quot; said Mary Morris , associate director of the new center . RAND policy analysts met Tuesday with a large group of influential Jewish , Arab , Turkish and Iranian Americans after a Jewish settler ' s massacre of 48 Muslims in Hebron last Friday . The round-table discussion centered_on suggested solutions to the region ' s myriad problems , including a poor economy and political instability . &quot; For any growth , the area needs political stability before any investment can take_place , &quot; said Talat Othman , president of Dearforn Financial . However , Joe Jacobs , president of Jacobs Engineering Group and a self-proclaimed scarred business veteran of the Middle_East , said economic cooperation remains the best antidote to political passions . &quot; An economic model must be set_up despite the region ' s political problems , &quot; he said . &quot; A concrete economic prize held_up at the end of the peace process with defined objectives will be a force compelling a political solution . The political and economic elements are not mutually exclusive. &quot; Other analysts encouraged the center to study the broader issues of the Middle_East and surrounding areas . &quot; Don ' t ignore Algeria and Afghanistan -- the effort should not be just Arabs and Israelis , &quot; said Jerrold Green , director of the University of Arizona ' s Center for Middle Eastern Studies . Some believe RAND could be a powerful force because it is the world ' s largest nonprofit organization , with more_than 1 # 100 consultants and research analysts , and with decades of experience studying public policy issues . &quot; Better economic models and education projects will weave a tapestry of peace through the Middle_East , &quot; said Irving Boren , president of the Boren Foundation , which recently donated $ 1 million to the center . &quot; An impartial group like RAND will make such programs readily acceptable. &quot; ADRIAN MAHER</TEXT>
