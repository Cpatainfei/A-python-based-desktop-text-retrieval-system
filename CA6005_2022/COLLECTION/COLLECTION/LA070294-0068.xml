   <HEADLINE> NEW SHIPPING RULES BRING TURKEY INTO CONFLICT WITH RUSSIA , NEIGHBORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Giving no leeway to criticism from Russia , Greece and Black_Sea countries , Turkey on Friday imposed new safety regulations on the Turkish straits , one of the world ' s busiest international waterways -- and one that is also potentially hazardous . Speaking on a quayside decked with flags in honor of the young Turkish republic ' s 1926 declaration of sovereignty over its territorial_waters , Ibrahim Tez , the minister in_charge of shipping , promised that Turkey had no intention of blocking free passage of commercial ships as guaranteed by the 1936 Montreux Convention . &quot; The basic philosophy is to make free passage mean safe passage , &quot; Tez said . &quot; Ships passing_through the straits have grown unimaginably in size , tonnage , speed , loads and environmental hazards . But the physical dimensions of the straits remain the same. &quot; In 1936 , one or two ships a day passed_through the Turkish straits , the name for the 180-mile waterway from the Aegean_Sea to the Black_Sea through the Dardanelles , the Sea_of_Marmara and the Bosporus . But in 1993 , a record 64 foreign-flag ships a day , plus a similar number of Turkish vessels , passed_through . More can be expected as Europe ' s canal systems expand and Russia loses easy access to Baltic ports . Under the Montreux Convention , even inexperienced captains are not required to take aboard a pilot to guide them through the Bosporus , a tricky waterway that narrows to half a mile or so and is plagued by fast , shifting currents . Apart from much stricter controls over positions in shipping lanes , the new regulations mainly set_down in writing what Turkish controllers were doing already : Since a bad oil_tanker accident in March , tankers and ships longer than 660 feet have been restricted to daylight hours and one-way traffic . Moscow has said it will not recognize the new regulations , saying they will lead to a buildup of ships waiting to pass_through . Other articles allowing controllers to close_down the straits or to refuse passage to &quot; dangerous &quot; ships also worry Russia and other Black_Sea states that rely_on the straits for access to the world ' s warm-water seas . &quot; The regulations . . . are blatantly against Montreux Convention and the international norms relating to international waterways , &quot; the Russian Embassy in Turkey said in a statement . Behind the scenes , Russia and Turkey are also struggling over which route will be used to bring oil from new fields in Siberia , Central Asia and Azerbaijan . Moscow wants to use the Black_Sea port of Novorossisk ; Turkey wants the fee-paying pipelines over its territory . The Turkish Foreign Ministry says Russia plans to ship up_to 100 million tons of crude a year from Novorossisk , a load for about three huge tankers a day . The new regulations could limit oil shipping during the day . &quot; The Turkish straits cannot be considered an oil transportation route , &quot; the Foreign Ministry said . &quot; The building of oil_pipelines over Turkish territory . . . is feasible , environmentally much safer and more secure and logical in every sense. &quot;</TEXT>
