   <HEADLINE> THE STRANGE FAITH OF DR . CORDER ; HE BELIEVES THAT ALIENS WALK AMONG US AND THE APOCOLYPSE IS NIGH . BUT DOES THAT MEAN HE ISN ' T A GOOD DOCTOR ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Everything was fine as long as Dr. Corder kept his strange thoughts to himself . When they finally tumbled out , there was hell_to_pay . A respected country_doctor with a stable practice spread through two counties , Scott Corder passed his days among the elderly and infirm of Ottawa , a town of more_than 10 # 000 in the gently sloping farmland of eastern Kansas . Setting fractures , listening to congested chests , he was the sort of responsible physician who never went anywhere without a pager in his belt . But the doctor was a walking Pandora ' s Box . Dizzying cosmic notions teemed inside him , an entire religion replete with space aliens and angels and warnings of Armageddon . After almost a decade of building his practice , Corder knew that telling the world about his revelations from beyond might make him a laughingstock . But there was so_much to tell : that the vanguard of an alien race was already among us to pave the way for either a lasting peace or permanent darkness . That Corder himself was one of the &quot; Chosen , &quot; earthlings implanted with monitoring devices to prepare_for the coming of the spaceships . That while Corder wolfed_down a hamburger at the Sonic Drive-In one night , none other_than the Apostle Peter , returned from a distant solar_system to hasten Earth ' s new age , had caught his eye and winked_at him . For most of his life , Scott Corder , now 43 , had been an agnostic , more familiar_with Gray ' s Anatomy than with the Bible . But now he had gospel to spread . The doctor told his family . He told patients . He told the Pentagon . He told the Weekly World News . Then , in December , 1988 , he sat_down in a Topeka conference_room to tell officials of the Kansas Board of Healing Arts . From that moment on , the doctor paid dearly for his message . Alarmed at what they perceived as a public menace , state medical authorities ordered Corder to submit to a psychiatric examination . He refused and was stripped of his physician ' s license . In his practice , the doctor had shown no warning signs of impaired judgment . Yet as a private citizen , he seemed to be mouthing madness . Could a physician make life-and-death decisions while giving himself over to a belief system ruled by aliens ? Did health authorities have the obligation to intervene in the affairs of such a professional , even though he showed no sign of diminished capacity ? &quot; You don ' t know what ' s going_on in someone ' s mind , &quot; says Richard G . Gannon , the former healing arts board executive_director . &quot; We wanted to know and he didn ' t want to let us in. &quot; The demarcation between madness and religious beatitude is often blurry . Interviewed by six psychiatrists over a four-year period , Corder became his own Rorschach test -- the inky flow_from his mind allowed_for any interpretation . Some saw the construct of lunacy . Others saw the odd , yet sane , flowering of religious devotion . Uncertainty over Corder ' s fitness as a doctor led medical regulators to move quickly against him . But in their haste to weed out a doctor they saw as a public threat , Corder ' s lawyers now allege , Kansas officials deprived Corder of a proper hearing . &quot; The whole process was so totalitarian , &quot; says Alan V . Johnson , one of Corder ' s attorneys . &quot; They were_after him because his beliefs were strange. &quot; In the end , they decided he was sane and restored his license . The doctor returned to a shrunken practice , still believing_in UFOs and angelic visitors , awaiting vindication in a lawsuit now before the Kansas Court of Appeals . &quot; I ' m after vengeance now , &quot; Corder says in his cramped examining room in Ottawa . It is an old office , cluttered with used equipment and pervaded by a sense of defeat -- yellowing wallpaper , wheezing air conditioners , battered files piled high with medication samples . Only Corder ' s own private icons , framed photographs of UFOs and space scenes on his office wall , testify to his lingering defiance . &quot; I want my name in front of them for as long as possible . I want them to remember the name of Scott Corder every time they think_about disciplining a doctor. &quot; There was a time , though , when he wished they had never seen it . * &quot; THEY ' RE COMING ! &quot; The first thing Steve French noticed was the headline . Reading on , he saw a familiar name : Dr. Scott Corder . It was a Saturday , Dec. , 3 , 1988 . French was shopping at a supermarket outside Topeka . An investigator for the Kansas Board of Healing Arts , French searched medical and pharmaceutical files each week for evidence to use against addicted and incompetent doctors . There were 6 # 800 physicians in Kansas and the push was_on to get_tough with them . As he moved along the checkout line , French found himself drawn to a copy of the Weekly World News and its diet of Elvis sightings , Hitler clones and freak babies . Leafing through the tabloid , he paused at Page 9 to scan a story about a central Kansas woman named Donna Butts , who claimed she met with aliens every day . There was a photograph and caption with the story : &quot; Space alien invasion only three years away , says top UFO expert. &quot; The expert , staring drowsily from behind thick glasses , was Dr. Scott Corder . French knew the name and face . The investigator had been running_down leads_on &quot; professional patients , &quot; addicts and dealers who sweet-talked doctors into writing narcotics prescriptions . Scott Corder was one of the physicians allegedly duped . That Monday , French mentioned Corder ' s name to his superiors . The executive_director of the board , Richard G . Gannon , was intrigued . &quot; We already had information that he was giving_out Dilaudid prescriptions improperly and Steve said , ' Look_at what he ' s doing now , ' &quot; Gannon recalls . &quot; We clearly had to have him in_for a talk. &quot; A retired Democratic state_senator from rural western Kansas , the silver-haired Gannon , not yet 40 , was coming_on like a prairie fire to rid the state of troublesome doctors whose crimes ranged from incompetence to alcoholism and cocaine_addiction . A newly passed malpractice-reform law had boosted the agency ' s budget and staff , and Gannon , the new executive , was expected to show results . &quot; The governor really wanted action , &quot; Gannon says . &quot; The Kansas medical society , the docs , they wanted it , too . The public demanded it . There just wasn ' t any more room for bad or incompetent doctors in Kansas. &quot; In Gannon ' s view , Corder ' s casual dispensing of prescriptions was worrisome but hardly flagrant . Rather , it was Corder ' s obsession with UFOs that was the potential danger signal . Gannon decided to order Corder to meet with him and investigators the next day . Corder was in his office in Ottawa when the telephone rang . He was alarmed at the mention of prescriptions . But when the board ' s lawyer told him of their interest in his statements about UFOs , Corder grew excited . He sensed opportunity . * &quot; BELIEVE nothing because it is said to be of divine origin . BELIEVE nothing because a wise_man said it . BELIEVE nothing because its belief is generally held . BELIEVE nothing because it is written in ancient books . BELIEVE nothing because someone else believes it . BUT believe only what you yourself know to be true. &quot; The message , from the Apostle Peter himself , had been relayed through the celestial messenger ' s earthly conduit , Donna Butts . Corder had called her after hearing from the board . Over the phone , she dictated Peter ' s personal message to the officials . The doctor typed it out on his medical stationery and took it and a dog-eared Bible with him to Topeka the next morning . He wore his dark-blue polyester-blend suit , the only one he owned . His hair , slightly shaggy , was combed down . He wanted to make a good impression . There were four of them waiting for him : French , Joseph M . Furjanic , a board lawyer , and two others who , Corder later testified in court , were never identified to him . They were Dr. Glenn Swogger Jr . and Dr. Dean Collins , two psychiatrists from the Menninger Clinic , a world-renowned hospital and psychiatric training facility in Topeka . Gannon wanted Swogger and Collins in_attendance that day &quot; to figure_out what we were dealing with. &quot; Corder ' s lawyer , Johnson , would claim later that the board ' s failure to identify the psychiatrists to Corder and explain their presence deprived the doctor of his right to a proper hearing . But according to Gannon , Furjanic set the agenda . Swogger understood that the doctors were present only in &quot; an advisory role , &quot; not to make a formal diagnosis . The questions about Corder ' s prescribing habits were cleared_up quickly after Corder agreed to supply the names of patients he thought might be abusing prescriptions . Gannon slipped into the room as the conversation wound down . He had been wondering how to subtly bring_up the subject of aliens , but Corder did_it for him . &quot; I thought you wanted to talk_about UFOs , &quot; the doctor said . They sat_back as Corder explained his discovery . Handing the others the message from Peter , the doctor explained that through his own amateur investigations into the UFO phenomenon , he had stumbled upon an astounding revelation : Extraterrestrials had divine origins . And Donna Butts , a part-time cleaning_woman from Russell , was their earthly link . Corder explained that he had never seen the aliens himself . But Butts had , dozens of times . On a car trip in central Kansas in 1980 , she saw a spaceship . Then , four years later , she began getting regular visits from a celestial being who called himself Cephas , but he was actually the Apostle Peter . The holy messenger had returned from M-31 , a remote star in the Andromeda galaxy , to prepare Earth ' s civilization for a golden_age -- if the world accepted the teachings he provided through Donna Butts . The alternative was a hellish apocalypse of nuclear war , disease and chaos . Butts had told Corder that both of them had been selected to apprise the world of the coming of the aliens . Their progress was being monitored by &quot; monotrons &quot; implanted into their bodies by the aliens at birth . Cephas and other visiting beings were &quot; Amorcans , &quot; benign humanoids who travel through the cosmos in pyramid-shaped vessels . They poured their heady knowledge into Donna Butts , filling her up like a wineskin . &quot; I was convinced she had a direct link to a phenomenon that had the answers_for mankind , &quot; Corder says . &quot; How could you keep something like that a secret ? &quot; When the doctor was done , Gannon leaned_back in his executive chair and motioned to the fifth-floor window overlooking the state_capital and the streets of Topeka . &quot; You know , it ' s a big world out there , a big universe , and there could possibly be other life out there , &quot; he said . But the idea that some woman in Russell was communicating with beings from M-31 was out_of_the_question . Corder heard Gannon say that &quot; since we are responsible_for licensing physicians in Kansas , this sort of thing reflects back on us. &quot; Then drawing_close to the doctor , Gannon added : &quot; You know , you need to be more careful about who you talk to about all this. &quot; It was merely a bit of paternalistic advice . &quot; So help me , I felt sorry_for the guy , &quot; Gannon says . &quot; He was clearly embarrassing himself. &quot; Corder read it another way . He shook hands with the regulators when the meeting ended . On the way to his car , he mulled_over Gannon ' s words . &quot; I didn ' t want my license revoked , &quot; Corder recalls . &quot; They just wanted me to keep my mouth shut . So I did. &quot; * It was the lights in the sky that first made him wonder . Corder had been curious about UFOs ever since his youth in Highland , Kan . At night , he and his brothers peered up from their bedroom windows . The cobalt-blue firmament was flush with stars . Airplanes and streaking meteorites were easy to pick_out . But there were also objects they had never seen before -- mysterious , otherworldly . &quot; We ' d see a light in the sky and wonder what it was doing there , &quot; recalls Mark Corder , one of Scott ' s older brothers . Maturing , the brothers put their childhood fascination aside . Like his father , a general_practitioner , Scott Corder took his medical degree at the University of Kansas . One winter day in 1978 , during his senior year of residency at St . Luke ' s and Mercy Hospital in Davenport , Iowa , Corder noticed an advertisement for a lecture by J . Allen Hynek , a Northwestern University astronomer who ran a UFO research organization . The name struck_a_chord . Corder had read Hynek ' s book , &quot; The UFO Experience , &quot; in high_school . Corder went that night for &quot; the entertainment , &quot; watching while the elderly Hynek debated sightings with his audience . Soon after , Corder signed_on with the group . For months , Corder ' s reports about alleged UFO sightings in the Kansas area were &quot; routine , the usual questions and speculation we tend to get from our people , &quot; says Jerome Clark , vice_president of the Center for UFO Studies , located in Chicago . But then , suddenly , Corder ' s letters grew long-winded , webbed with outlandish pronouncements . He had found Donna Butts . Corder had learned about her in a letter from another UFO center official . &quot; They said they were getting letters from a lady in Kansas who made some strange claims. &quot; Corder says . &quot; They were worried about her psyche. &quot; Butts lived_on the ramshackle farm property that she and her truck_driver husband rented , raising five children . Sometimes , she cleaned_houses . Sometimes , she cared_for elderly . Sometimes , she had visions . Corder had a lot to lose by listening to Butts . After seven years in Ottawa , he had become a familiar fixture in its nursing_homes and tiny hospital , Ransom Memorial . Aging patients prized his bedside_manner . Len Daugherty , at that time Ransom ' s administrator , regarded Corder as one of the &quot; best diagnosis men in town. &quot; But after meeting Donna , Corder changed . He was_on the phone constantly with her , recalls his former receptionist , Delma Mavity . He taped up space-themed items on his office walls . There were photographs of Earth , the space shuttle , a blurry UFO sighting . There was a sign that read : &quot; Jesus Loves You. &quot; Some patients gossiped about Corder ' s newfound obsession , but most were willing to endure the strange office decor , even Corder ' s talk_of UFOs , as long as his care held_up . Word that Corder claimed to have met the Apostle Peter at the Sonic Drive-In drew a_few gawkers to the hamburger stand . But most Ottawans took his pronouncements in stride . This was a county with 64 churches ; one more , even with celestial origins , could be accommodated . &quot; Heavenly days , &quot; says Mary Anne Whiteford , head of the Ottawa Community Arts Council and one of Corder ' s patients , &quot; this is still a free country . Everyone can believe as they wish , no matter how strange it seems to the rest of us. &quot; At home , Corder ' s wife , Barbara , a schoolteacher , also tolerated his increasingly strange beliefs . &quot; I like to read about the different sightings and all_the stories , &quot; she says . &quot; But I would n ' t give my job up for it. &quot; Other family members were less forgiving . Corder had married and divorced twice before he met Barbara , and his new beliefs seemed to further alienate him from his families . An older daughter from Corder ' s first marriage stopped speaking_to him . And his second wife told brother Mark Corder that she wanted Scott to stay_away_from their son , in part because of his new beliefs . Yet Scott Corder had a new family of sorts . Each time he made the nearly four-hour drive to Russell , he found people who validated his growing belief in UFOs . A small coterie of schoolteachers and farmers ' wives began showing_up at Butts ' home . They , too , claimed to have seen the spaceships . In Russell , there were rumors of an impending exodus to the spaceships in_advance of Armageddon . It was like the story of Noah ' s Ark , only this time , it seemed that the deluge would last only a week . The chosen were told by Butts to pack seven pairs of cotton socks , seven pairs of underwear , seven shirts . There was no exodus , and the doubters eventually wore Donna Butts down . Claiming harassment and death threats , she and her family moved to Georgia in early 1992 . These days , she keeps her miracles to herself . When telephoned recently at a Georgia number supplied by her mother-in-law , Butts at first expressed interest in Corder ' s plight , then abruptly insisted that she was another Donna Butts . &quot; She doesn ' t want to talk_about it anymore , &quot; June Butts explains . But back on a warm day -- May 13 , 1987 -- Corder cast_away his own last shreds of doubt . He knew Butts ' tales sounded crazy . But after weeks of interviews , after his own medical_examinations of the woman , he was convinced her fantastic talk_of Armageddon was accurate . That day , surrounded by UFO tomes and scrapbooks thick_with his correspondence , Corder gave_in to the rapture . It swept_over him with the electric shudder of a born-again conversion . Ecstatic with joy , he wept for hours . &quot; I had found_out the answer to the UFO mystery and I was elated , &quot; Corder says . &quot; UFOs were spiritual things . They existed in faith . From that point on , it was my duty to tell the world. &quot; * Not even three months after Corder told Richard Gannon he would keep his beliefs to himself , Corder was in deep trouble . The doctor had sent a letter to federal_officials at the Pentagon . Dated Feb . 15 , 1989 , it warned of a new prediction from Peter , relayed through Butts . President Bush was in danger of assassination . &quot; This is a prediction and NOT a threat , &quot; Corder wrote . The Secret_Service was called_in anyway . It found no threat but handed the_matter over to the healing arts board . Alarmed at Corder ' s indiscretion , Gannon ordered him to meet with Glenn Swogger at Menninger ' s . Failure to comply , Gannon said curtly , would lead to immediate suspension of his license . Swogger began to probe gently after Corder settled himself into an office armchair . Suspicious , Corder parried with terse answers . Corder found Swogger &quot; aloof , doubting . You could tell by his expressions he was down on what I said . And I was very defensive . My career and my life were_on the line. &quot; As the session progressed , Swogger found himself concluding that Corder showed evidence of a &quot; florid &quot; delusional system , a web of fantasy , but at that time , it did not appear to affect Corder ' s daily working life . &quot; People can have delusions while the rest of their personality is intact , &quot; Swogger says . But what he saw in Corder worried him . Swogger felt that he &quot; was seeing signs of leakage &quot; in Corder ' s obsessions , possibly affecting his work . The next day , in a follow-up meeting between Corder and another Menninger psychiatrist , Dr. Joseph Hyland , Swogger ' s fears appeared to be confirmed . Corder , convinced he was about to committed involuntarily to the clinic , stormed out of the interview after only a_few minutes . &quot; I had done my part to explain myself to them , &quot; Corder says . &quot; It went downhill from the moment I walked in . At one point , he said : ' We want to help you get_rid_of your bizarre beliefs , but you ' ll be able to keep your Christian beliefs . You have a bizarre thinking disorder. ' I knew what that meant , all_right . That I was crazy. &quot; Hyland , who has since died , jotted_down in his notes that the doctor would require &quot; inpatient hospitalization. &quot; If he refused , Hyland had told Corder before he left , &quot; he could expect to have his license suspended. &quot; But both Swogger and Hyland based part of their analysis on unverified rumors that called into question Corder ' s ability to function as a doctor . According to one report relayed to the investigators by Corder ' s brother Mark , a lawyer in nearby Olathe , the doctor had approached a worker at an Ottawa nursing_home and asked her to look_into his ear . &quot; He wanted to know if she could see a monitor in his head , &quot; Mark Corder says . Mark urged Scott to see a psychiatrist and secretly asked a local judge about the possibility of committing Scott to a psychiatric ward . But no one from the board called the nursing_home or Ransom Memorial Hospital to decide whether the doctor had ever acted inappropriately . &quot; There was never any attempt by the board to do what it is supposed to do : determine whether Scott ' s beliefs affected his ability to practice medicine , &quot; says his lawyer , Alan Johnson . &quot; If they did , this case would never have gone forward. &quot; In fact , before Corder lost his license , Len Daugherty , Ransom ' s administrator , grew so worried about the hospital ' s liability that he ordered an internal review of Corder ' s work . &quot; We went_back over his charts . We spent 20 days going_over his cases , &quot; Daugherty says . &quot; There was not a single problem . He did everything any conscientious doctor would do . And his patients loved him. &quot; Richard Gannon insists that he had no obligation to research Corder ' s record as a doctor . The psychiatrists ' concerns , he says , were sufficient to cause alarm . It was Corder ' s future actions , not his past performance , that concerned Gannon . But the opinions of Glenn Swogger and Joseph Hyland were not the only psychiatric views of Scott Corder . Mark Corder had persuaded his brother to see a psychiatrist , Dr. Robert Nash , and a psychologist , Dr. Fowler C . Jones . After a_battery of mental_tests , Jones concluded that Scott Corder was &quot; preoccupied by his UFO interest but there was no evidence . . . to conclude he is a danger to his patients. &quot; Two years after being examined by Swogger , Corder was interviewed by another psychiatrist , John Wisner , who is also a Roman_Catholic priest . Wisner concurred with Jones ' finding . &quot; The failure here was the failure of a secular society , &quot; Wisner says . &quot; would n ' t it seem sensible to assess his performance as a doctor ? That didn ' t happen , I think , because many psychiatrists today are reluctant to accept people ' s beliefs for what they are -- beliefs. &quot; Misguided as some might think Corder ' s beliefs are , he is clearly not alone ; millions of Americans believe that some of their countrymen have had encounters with aliens . Whitley Strieber ' s book , &quot; Communion , &quot; was a bestseller and a popular film . Harvard psychiatrist John E . Mack has gained more fame in the past year for his acceptance of UFO encounter claims than he did for two decades of less controversial psychiatric work . And UFO encounters are becoming a popular theme of junk culture . Two new TV_shows , &quot; Encounters : The Hidden Truth &quot; and &quot; The X-Files , &quot; have used UFO reports as grist for their story mills . Within this culture , an enduring subculture has come_to attach religious significance to aliens . Blending biblical citations and UFO cant , some claim to channel messages from aliens while others make a career of describing frequent UFO contacts . In recent years , says Jerome Clark of the Center for UFO Studies , the contactee movement has become a self-sustaining entity , churning_out &quot; hundreds of books and monographs and newsletters . Most of these people live_in isolation , and they feed_on each other. &quot; They can ' t talk to their family or neighbors about it , because that would bring the possibility of doubt , so they prop each other ' s beliefs up in letters and phone calls. &quot; &quot; Sure , some of them are charlatans , &quot; says Robert Fuller , professor of religious studies at Bradley University in Peoria , Ill. , &quot; but there ' s a tremendous excitement in thinking_of yourself as a prophet. &quot; As John Wisner listened to Corder , the doctor ' s epiphany was clearly evident . As a priest , Wisner had heard it before ; it was the &quot; kind of thing you see at a Youth for Christ rally every weekend. &quot; All Corder seemed to be doing was interpreting &quot; a lot of everyday occurrences and relating them to the beliefs that had been revealed to him. &quot; Wisner ' s finding , like those of the other psychiatrists , was itself only interpretation . But the conclusions of the Menninger analysts had the authority of the state behind them . Three days after his disastrous meeting with Hyland , Corder ' s fate was sealed . Steve French and a woman from an impaired-physicians ' counseling group , arrived_at Corder ' s office with the notice of suspension . Corder asked if he could finish_out the day with his patients . French shook his head and said no . Turning red , Corder grabbed the suspension notice and waved it in French ' s face . &quot; This , &quot; he said , &quot; is an injustice. &quot; * Without his profession , Corder was a man adrift . Living only on Barbara ' s teaching salary , the couple lost their house . They moved with her two children into cheaper accommodations , a trailer outside of town . Corder became a gentleman farmer . He grew turnips , beets , cabbages sunflowers . He erected a henhouse , filling it with shrieking chickens . He lost 15 pounds digging an underground shelter for the coming Armageddon and equipped it with solar_power and a month ' s worth of supplies . Legally , Corder was baffled . He tried to file his own lawsuit in federal_court in Topeka , charging that his suspension was unconstitutional . But the judge threw it out , saying it should have been filed_in state courts . Corder ' s approaches to local lawyers were unavailing until he found Alan Johnson , a Topeka corporate lawyer with an interest in constitutional rights cases . Johnson filed a motion with the federal_district court in Topeka , alleging that Corder was deprived of his due-process rights to a full hearing . Corder won the right to go before the board , but that changed nothing . He still had to pass a full psychiatric review . The board insisted that Corder ' s license would be returned only after a Menninger psychiatrist verified his sanity . Bit by bit , the doctor ' s resolve weakened . He agreed to see another Menninger psychiatrist . In March , 1992 , Corder spent several sessions with psychiatrists inside the clinic ' s brick-walled infirmary . William Logan , the Menninger psychiatrist who examined him , notified state officials that Corder was fit to practice . On April 11 , 1992 , the board reinstated his license . With seed money provided by Ransom Memorial , Corder returned to his practice . And he has built back more_than half his old patient load . &quot; I loved Dr. Corder , &quot; says one elderly Ottawan , a former patient . &quot; But he still believes_in UFOs , and as long as he does , how can I be certain he won ' t get_into trouble ? &quot; Others are more willing to forgive . &quot; He charges less for a visit than the other doctors do , and he really knows his patients , &quot; says Marilyn Gilmore , a registered nurse who takes her children to Corder . &quot; He has strange ideas , but as long as he doesn ' t force them on you , so what ? &quot; Corder heard more good news in June , 1993 . He won his lawsuit against the board . But it was a hollow victory . Corder was awarded $ 185 # 000 in damages but could not collect , since by the judge ' s ruling both Richard Gannon and the board were immune to liability . Johnson has appealed , and Corder has been waiting for word from the Kansas Supreme Court to learn whether he will win any compensation for his three years without work . Corder still clings_to his beliefs . But they , too , have begun to change . His relationship with Donna Butts crumbled in September , 1991 , during a chaotic trip he took_to Israel with her and a Russell family . She had indicated that &quot; a major prophecy &quot; was about to take_place in the Holy_Land , and they were the only proper witnesses . They had planned to be gone_for weeks , but a_few days after a detoured journey to Jerusalem , Corder quietly returned home . His wife had finally lost patience . &quot; She basically said if I stayed , she might not be there when I came_home , &quot; Corder says . &quot; I wasn ' t going_to make that choice. &quot; To Butts , Corder ' s departure was a betrayal . She severed all ties with him . In two years , they have not spoken . &quot; That doctor , &quot; says June Butts , &quot; he ' s gone_over to the dark side. &quot; * Scott Corder has his own movement now . He calls it the Church of the End Times . He is leader and congregation . He prints out grim warnings on his computer , quoting passages from Revelations and scorning society ' s growing reliance on technology . Even supermarket bar_codes contain a satanic &quot; Mark of the Beast. &quot; Corder is careful not to belabor patients about his beliefs unless they know him well . Still , just for a lark , he will sometimes test strangers , probing their own religious concepts to see if he might find a convert , someone whose fascination with the celestial unknown matches his own . J . D . Lorenz , a traveling pharmaceutical salesman , discovered this one Saturday when he turned_up at Corder ' s office to sell his wares . The two men talked drug prices and new products , droning on in a conversation familiar to any general_practitioner . And then , as Lorenz finished his pitch , Dr. Corder ' s face creased in a grin . &quot; J . D. , &quot; he says , &quot; do you remember what I told you last time about the Mark of the Beast ? . . . &quot;</TEXT>
