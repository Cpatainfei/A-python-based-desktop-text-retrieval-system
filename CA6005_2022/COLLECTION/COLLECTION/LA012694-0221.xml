   <HEADLINE> TELECOMMUNICATIONS ; MCI TO PUT $ 450 MILLION INTO TELEPHONE VENTURE IN MEXICO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to cash_in_on Mexico ' s booming telecommunications market , MCI Communications Corp . said Tuesday that it will invest $ 450 million in a joint_venture with Mexico ' s leading financial company to offer long-distance phone_services south of the border . Grupo Financiero Banamex Accival , or Banacci , which already runs Mexico ' s largest private communications network , will be MCI ' s partner in the venture with a 55 % share of the new company . The success of the venture depends_on Mexican government approval of the group ' s application to offer long-distance services beginning in 1996 , when that market is scheduled to be opened_up to competition . MCI said the venture will help create a &quot; NAFTA network &quot; -- a reference_to the recently approved North_American Free_Trade Agreement -- that will make_it as easy to dial in and out of Mexico as it now is to call across the Canadian border . To Mexican phone users , said Eugene Eidenberg , executive_vice_president at MCI , &quot; the U.S. will look_like another Mexican province. &quot; Currently , 13 % of international calls originating_in the United States go_to Mexico , while more_than 90 % of international calls placed in Mexico go_to the United States and Canada . But Mexico ' s telephone_system , with only seven lines for every 100 residents , is notorious for its poor service . If approved by summer , as the partners expect , MCI will make an initial investment of $ 150 million to begin building a &quot; crystal triangle &quot; of fiber-optic cables linking the leading business cities of Mexico_City , Guadalajara and Monterrey . Until the long-distance market opens_up to competition , the new venture will offer private telecommunications services to large business customers in Mexico , expanding on Banacci ' s existing business . MCI ' s venture is the latest in a string of large U.S. investments in Mexico ' s phone business . Despite its many problems , the industry ' s huge growth potential has made_it a favorite among foreign investors . For example , since San Antonio-based Southwestern Bell helped Telephonos de Mexico go private in December , 1990 , when it bought a 10 % stake in the telephone monopoly for $ 953 million , the Mexican company ' s stock price has soared . Bell Atlantic announced plans last fall to spend $ 1.04 billion for a 42 % stake in Iusacell , Mexico ' s second-largest cellular_phone company . Poor land-line services have resulted in heavy usage of cellular_phones in Mexico as a replacement for basic phone_services . MCI expects to benefit from the growing volume of telephone traffic between the United States and Mexico as cross-border trade flourishes under NAFTA .</TEXT>
