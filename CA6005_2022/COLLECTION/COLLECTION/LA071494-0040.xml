   <TEXT> Real men chew gum : The Wrigley ' s folks are touting their spearmint gum as a substitute for cigarettes in newspaper and radio ads specifically directed toward L.A. restaurant diners and car-poolers . Now comes a local company with a more provocative pitch . Gum Tech International trumpets its product as &quot; a full-potency gum to increase romantic power. &quot; The brand name ? LOVE gum . For the safety of others , please don ' t chew it while car-pooling . * For clean minds only : In addition to finding LOVE at our local food stand , we also noticed a sesame-and-raisin confection named Nookies , whose slogan is : &quot; Makes you feel good but not the way you think. &quot; * It ' s not like we have_sex on the brain today , but . . . We did notice this possibly-X-rated menu item in a Long_Beach restaurant . Waterfront life-style : Writer Tom Nagano , on some advantages of living in the downtown L.A. River district : * Free meals on Thanksgiving and Christmas . * Always able to find night parking on the street . * When they let you out of jail , you can walk home . * Very early previews of movie car chases and explosions . * So quiet on Sundays and holidays that some call it Mayberry . * At night , the sidewalks sparkle with &quot; road diamonds &quot; ( broken auto glass ) . * Hand car washes directly adjacent to your home . * Lots of free assemblage art materials . * For a_few dollars , neighborhood security will watch your car . * Urban night adventures that are better than Sierra Club wilderness hikes . * It isn ' t easy being a pedestrian in Southern California : And nowhere was this more apparent than at the Glendale Galleria , where Tami Mohr photographed a quake-damaged structure . Beneath the arches is a small sign that says : &quot; Be Careful . Watch Your Step. &quot; * Capital-letter offenses : In this age of graphics , it shouldn ' t be surprising that people are editing their names into more eye-catching versions in the manner of e.e. cummings . Some examples : * w . euGene Scott , TV evangelist . * k.d. lang , pop singer . * A Alvarez , actor . * ( You ' ll have to imagine a strange-looking symbol. ) The replacement for the name of rock singer Prince . * Donald K . BrOwn , a San Pedro-born lobbyist who has his own firm in Sacramento . He points_out , incidentally , that he adopted the big O when he was 16 , partly because of the surplus of Donald small-o Browns . * And , finally , the spokes-model character in the movie , &quot; L.A Story. &quot; Her first_name is SanDeE * . Didn ' t catch the last_name and not sure we ' d want to . miscelLAny : Frederick Mellinger , the founder of Fredericks of Hollywood , unveiled the store ' s first push-up bra in 1948 . Its name : Rising Star . Well , they didn ' t have LOVE gum back then . Menu item found in Long_Beach that might need an &quot; X &quot; rating .</TEXT>
