   <HEADLINE> STORMIN ' NORMANDY ; TODAY , THE WIND-SWEPT BEACHES OF NORTHERN FRANCE ARE PEACEFUL , BUT ON JUNES 6 , 1944 , THEY EXPLODED WITH THE SOUNDS OF WAR . THIS SUMMER , THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF D-DAY , HORDES OF VISITORS WILL REINVADE THEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The early morning hours were cold and gray , with rain pelting down and the wind whipping at 30 m.p.h. After an hour , I was soaked and needed some shelter . I found it inside a 50-year-old Nazi concrete bunker . From two-foot-wide turret slits , where artillery guns once overlooked the beaches 100 feet below , I could see no more_than a mile into the fog blanketing the_English Channel . The weather was miserable , and so it was perfect . On D-day , June 6 , 1944 , the weather was much like this when 5 # 000 Allied ships , 2 # 000 aircraft and 160 # 000 soldiers arrived on this northern coast of France . Some soldiers came_by glider or parachute . But most of them first touched France on five beaches code-named Utah , Omaha , Gold , Juno and Sword , and fought their way up the sands to begin the breakthrough inland that , within a year , would put the Allies in Berlin and end the Second_World_War in Europe . My wife Michele , who is French , and her sister-in-law had already left my brother-in-law and me here in the rain , calling us maniacs -- the word is similar in French -- as they took shelter in the car . Without a word , my brother-in-law , Andre , and I kept moving . Battlefield touring is an acquired taste ; it ' s not for everyone . And neither is Cognac . But the D-day beaches are worth savoring ; what happened on this strip of sand changed the map of Europe , and the rest of our century . I never wore a soldier ' s uniform -- one of my cherished mementos , in fact , is my student deferment card from the Vietnam era -- but war as history has always grabbed me . I ' ve walked the Revolutionary War battle greens of Lexington and Bunker_Hill , and through the woods at Valley Forge . I ' ve hiked in the forest below Richmond , Va. , where Grant ' s army outfought Lee ' s in our Civil War . I ' ve seen eastern France where trench warfare raged for years in World_War I . But no battlefield was as moving for me as the D-day beaches . For those veterans who will visit on the 50th anniversary of D-day this summer , the invasion remains one of the seminal moments of their lives . Older Americans remember that before D-day Hitler ' s army had ravaged Europe for five years , and many feared Germany might still win the war . Gen . Dwight D . Eisenhower called D-day &quot; a great crusade , &quot; but privately , the day before D-day , Eisenhower wrote a message in case things went_wrong : &quot; Our landings . . . have failed . . . The troops . . . did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do . If any blame or fault attaches_to the attempt it is mine alone. &quot; In the end , D-day helped bring an end to Hitler . Be advised that if you plan to visit , sharpen your elbows because it will probably be overcrowded all season . On June 6 , President Clinton , with as_many as 50 # 000 other visitors , should attend ceremonies at Omaha Beach . Retired Army Col . Bond Johnson of Long_Beach has led several D-day tours , but not this year : &quot; It will be a 5 o ' clock freeway traffic jam. &quot; So unless you already have reservations , consider going_to Normandy by April . Or wait until fall . Other_than anniversary time , it isn ' t hard to maneuver around the Normandy coast , even for an American who doesn ' t speak French . Beyond the battlefields , be ready for one of the most beautiful rural_areas of France . The sea air keeps the small cattle_farms and apple orchards a lush green , flowers are everywhere and the architecture resembles England ' s , with slate-gray tile or thatched roofs . This being apple country , Calvados -- apple brandy -- and cider find their way onto the table . There is also cheese -- Camembert and Pont-l ' Eveque are regional specialties -- and dessert : apple tarts , perhaps flambeed with Calvados . As for the battlefields , be forewarned : Unlike Concord or Gettysburg , where you can see a field of history in one view , it ' s impossible at the D-day beaches . The landing beach sites -- from west to east , Utah , Omaha ( invaded by Americans ) , Gold ( by the_British ) , Juno ( Canadian ) and Sword ( British ) -- stretch 60 miles along the rugged coastline . There are package tours , but a self-guided visit is easily done with a rental car . Get a Michelin map , do some reading -- try John Keegan ' s &quot; Six Armies in Normandy &quot; and bring photocopies of maps in the book . Before arriving last July , my biggest worry was how to find the exact spots where the invasions took_place . But the_French government makes_it easy . Utah , Omaha , Gold , Juno and Sword , are now the official names of these beaches , and are printed in English on road signs . Although the beaches are what D-day is_best remembered for , the first Allied soldiers to touch French soil , a_few minutes after midnight , were airborne units who came_down a_few miles inland on the western and eastern flanks of the invasion beaches . Our first stop was at the western edge of the invasion , in the village of Ste . Mere-Eglise , near where the first Americans were supposed to land . The actual landings of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions , however , were as precise as a pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey game . In the nighttime fog , aircraft veered off in all directions . Paratroopers jumped with 100 pounds of equipment ; some drowned in only a_few feet water on farmland flooded by the Nazis ; others were dropped so close to the ground that their chutes couldn ' t open . About 30 Americans were unfortunate enough to land in the middle of Ste . Mere-Eglise . Aerial bombings had torched some buildings , and the fires illuminated the paratroopers . Many of them were shot dead in the air , and some bodies landed in trees and hung there along the city square for hours . But by 4:30 a.m. , Ste . Mere-Eglise had become the first town in France liberated by Americans on D-day . One paratrooper that morning was Pvt . John Steele , and more_than anyone he made St . Mere-Eglise a big tourist stop . As he floated down , Steele was shot in the foot , then his parachute got stuck_on the church steeple in the city ' s square ; unable to free himself , he played dead for several hours , as Germans and Americans battled below . Steele survived the war , and in Darryl Zanuck ' s film &quot; The Longest Day , &quot; Red Buttons played Steele and helped cement his fame . A life-sized paratrooper mannequin now hangs from that same steeple , its parachute billowing in the cold wind 60 feet up . Inside the 12th-Century church are stained glass windows showing paratroopers and the_Virgin Mary . Ste . Mere-Eglise is worth a visit , especially to the impressive Airborne Troops Museum . It houses a C-47 transport plane that the Army used to drop paratroopers , and a glider that landed on D-day morning . The glider is the main attraction and visitors can walk through it . It ' s extremely flimsy and light to the touch : all wood , wires , a_few metal struts and green fabric covering its wings . The longest line here was to see a display of paratrooper K-rations : slabs of dried meat , oatmeal and chocolate , plus two morphine syringes , one change of underwear , cigarettes , etc . But my eyes stopped suddenly on another display_case , this one containing dozens of insignia patches of the Allied divisions that arrived on D-day and soon after . In front of me was the same round khaki , black-on-white armband worn by the U.S. 94th Infantry Division that I had memorized from childhood . That was the same patch worn by my uncle , Ted . In June , 1944 my uncle turned 20 . Nine days after D-day , he arrived in Normandy among the first waves of reinforcements , and he would fight under Gen . George Patton , who led troops as they swept across northern France and into Germany . Uncle Ted was wounded near Metz and , after getting_out of a hospital , he was among the first to cross the Rhine_River ; he wound_up the war in Czechoslovakia , 600 miles from Normandy . My uncle has never been back to Europe . His Purple_Heart medal sits in a closet , he gets a modest monthly check for his war injury , and in my lifetime he has said perhaps 1 # 000 words to me about the war . * From Ste . Mere-Eglise it ' s about five miles to Utah Beach . Along the roads I spotted the bocages , a factor_in wars dating_back 1 # 100 years , when the Vikings invaded Normandy . Bocages are massive hedgerows , mounds of dirt and vines ( some 10 feet thick ) that fence_in cattle and mark boundaries . Fifty years ago American tanks needed steel teeth to cut_through these mounds . It was still pouring when we got_to Utah Beach . Utah Beach was flat and ordinary , the sand no more_than 80 yards deep , with sea grass rising off the shallow shoreline , and behind that a gently rising plain . Of the five D-day landing beaches , Utah produced the fewest casualties , about 250 . Part of that had to do with the gentle terrain I saw . There are a_few memorials here . A granite monument to the 1st Engineer Special Brigade , sits next to a path leading to the beach , where a vintage American Sherman tank , repainted recently in Army green to slow rust , sits parked . Utah Beach fades quickly because eight miles to the east is the most vivid , intact war site on the D-day coast , and it is not on one of the five famous landing beaches . It ' s a promontory called Pointe du Hoc that juts_out 100 feet above a wedge of beach . In aerial photos taken_after D-day , Pointe du Hoc looks_like a lunar landscape because the Allied bombing was so severe . Pointe du Hoc was considered a key target because Allied intelligence thought the Nazis had howitzer guns here with enough range to cover Omaha and Utah beaches . The U.S. 2nd Ranger Battalion arrived on a sliver of beach and faced a 100-foot cliff . The Germans fired machine_guns and dropped grenades . The Rangers fired grappling hooks and began climbing , but it was slippery and hard to get a foothold . As naval bombardment hammered the cliff , chunks were torn out , and some Rangers could finally dig_in and climb . In 30 minutes , the Rangers were_on top . Later , they discovered the Nazis hadn ' t yet installed the howitzers . At the northern tip of Pointe du Hoc is an intact German bunker , with a round front like a massive turtle shell , the concrete turned brown from decades of rough weather . The French use the German word blockhaus to describe these massive fortifications , which still litter the Normandy coast . Why a German word ? &quot; Because the Germans put them here , &quot; my wife said . Barbed wire runs_along the path next to the cliff , some sea flowers grow along the edge , and over the cliffI could see only a thin strip of beach , which is still accessible only by boat . It was easy to imagine the horrors of D-day here , of the Rangers coming_in from the sea , bombs scarring the earth , and the Germans firing back . * The next morning , the weather in Normandy was again perfect : gray , windy and wet . Omaha Beach is four miles long and it was here the Germans came_closest to repelling the Allies back into the sea . The landscape here is more rugged and dramatic than at Utah Beach . Behind the beach , bluffs rise to 200 feet , and at both ends of Omaha Beach are 100-foot high cliffs . On D-day the Nazi defenses were heavy : The beach and bluffs were mined , there were trenches , concrete pillboxes and the most experienced German soldiers . When the American 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions waded in , they had been_on boats for several days ; most were seasick . Allied bombing overshot the German positions along the shore , leaving most intact . American amphibious tanks were launched too far offshore , and in the five-foot waves they sank like stones . Americans were hanging_on to only a_few yards of beach , while offshore Gen . Omar Bradley thought_of giving_up on Omaha and sending reinforcements to Utah Beach . Time has blurred which American officer said , &quot; Two kinds of people are staying_on this beach . The dead and those who are going_to die . Now let ' s get the hell out of here. &quot; Then the Americans rallied : Soldiers used bazookas to knock_out Nazi pillboxes , engineers demolished German bunkers , Navy destroyers kept firing at defense fortifications , and slowly the Americans moved beyond Omaha Beach . By day ' s end the Americans were only one mile inland , and 2 # 500 soldiers had died . &quot; Every man who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero , &quot; Bradley said . From the sand you can see a plateau a half-mile away . Many of those who died here now rest there , at the American Military Cemetery and Memorial . Two other American military cemeteries in France are larger than this one , but Normandy is where presidents come , and where this year a record 2 million visitors are expected . The cemetery ' s 173 acres were deeded to the United States by France in 1956 . Once past the visitor ' s center , the cemetery suddenly opens_up and your eyes move across the green field to rows of white marble crosses and Stars_of_David that stretch for 300 yards . There are 9 # 386 American soldiers buried here , from every state . The site is righteous and solemn , the grounds impeccable . Gravestones list each soldier ' s name , rank , military I.D. number , state he came from and date of death . One group of middle-age visitors knelt before a cross ; I wondered if their father was buried here . On the eastern edge of the grounds is a reflecting pool , two American flags and a bronze statue called &quot; The Spirit of American Youth. &quot; Hedges block the view from three sides of the cemetery . But to the north is a clear look_at Omaha Beach below , with walkways leading to the sand . It was so chilling here that my family and I didn ' t have much to say . At the cemetery , I thought_of my uncle Ted , and later I called him . He wanted to know in detail what the cemetery looked_like . When I finished , he said about his war , &quot; You don ' t want to do those things , but if you have to , you can . I did get_to see Paris. &quot; He quickly added : &quot; There ' s a golf tournament on , it ' s in sudden_death . I ' ve got_to go. &quot; * After the somberness of Omaha Beach , Arromanches was a pleasant change . This coastal town is part of Gold Beach , where the_British landed . Arromanches has narrow streets and colorfully painted storefronts with British flags flying . But the most startling scenery is the huge lumps of concrete , some the size of a five-story buildings laid on end , that dot the sand_dunes . Arromanches is dubbed &quot; Port Winston , &quot; as in Churchill , because the Prime_Minister came_up with the idea to float in an artificial harbor to speed the delivery of equipment and troops . Crepes , and cider with 5 % alcohol , are a Normandy specialty , and the four of us enjoyed some at a restaurant near the water . One crepe , with mushrooms and cheese , cost $ 10 but was so light I could have eaten a half-dozen . By now the rain was reduced to mist , and children were running_around in their swimsuits , never mind that the July temperature was no more_than 60 degrees . On D-day , the Allies ' dead , missing and wounded totaled about 10 # 000 ; German casualties ran as high as 9 # 000 . Part of all that was so these children could enjoy summer on this beach . One of our last stops was Ste . Aubin-sur-Mer , a coastal town along Juno Beach where the Canadians landed . Andre turned_into a military surplus garage that claims to specialize in World_War_II gear . The owner was Monsieur Goulard , a grease-stained mechanic in fatigues and boots . Andre studied an American jeep , with an Army star painted on the hood , that looked 20 years old . Price : $ 10 # 000 . Goulard told us that he used to run a military surplus garage in Caen , 10 miles south , but since moving to the Normandy coast his business had doubled . Why ? &quot; This close to the beaches , you can still smell the war. &quot; GUIDEBOOK The Reinvasion of Normandy Getting there : The Normandy beaches are about three hours north of Paris by train or car .
