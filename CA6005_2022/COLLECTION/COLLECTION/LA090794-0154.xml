   <HEADLINE> L.A. GAINS CONCESSION ON ANTI-SMOG RULES ; POLLUTION : AQMD PROPOSES TO REMOVE STRINGENT MEASURES FOR AIRPLANES , TRUCKS , TRAINS AND SHIPS FROM PLAN TO BE SUBMITTED TO U.S. ACTION IS DESIGNED TO BUY_TIME TO SEEK MORE ECONOMICAL ALTERNATIVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a major concession to Los Angeles , regional air quality officials devised a proposal Tuesday that would remove stringent anti-smog measures for airplanes , trucks , trains and ships from a sweeping clean-air plan to be submitted to the federal_government . Under the proposal presented by Henry Wedaa , chairman of the South Coast Air Quality Management District , the expensive and highly controversial measures targeting diesel_engines would remain in the Los Angeles region ' s 20-year smog plan . But they would not be included in the version sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for approval , which means the AQMD is not committing to implement them . That flexibility would give the AQMD and the city of Los Angeles a_few more years to search for more economical alternatives . Christopher O ' Donnell , a city legislative analyst , endorsed the compromise , calling it &quot; the best way to expedite the issue at this time. &quot; While it would allow Southern California to meet a federal deadline for its smog plan , the compromise would not commit the area to measures that would have &quot; a disastrous impact on the region ' s economy , &quot; he said . The AQMD board will meet Friday to decide the fate of the sweeping smog plan . Last month , the board unanimously postponed a decision until then so that an eleventh-hour strategy by Mayor Richard Riordan ' s staff could be hastily analyzed . The AQMD plan , designed to meet health standards in Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside and San Bernardino counties by 2010 , includes more_than 100 proposed transportation and industrial measures . It is the AQMD ' s third update , required under federal law , in five years . Also on Friday , the AQMD board will tackle an extraordinary proposal from local elected officials at the Southern California Assn . of Governments . The group has recommended that the AQMD incorporate in its plan a tax on motorists that would amount to 3 to 5 cents per mile driven -- equivalent_to about $ 1 per gallon . Arnold Sherwood , SCAG director of forecasting , said the tax would have to be set by the Legislature and would replace current gasoline_taxes that amount to about 2.5 cents per mile . He said it would bring_in about $ 5 billion a year to fund mass transit and other transportation improvements . Wedaa , however , predicted Tuesday that his board would never push for such a tax and that &quot; it ' s obvious that the Legislature would never do it. &quot; Meanwhile , the proposed compromise strategy with the mayor is much less aggressive in reducing nitrogen_oxides , a pollutant mostly from diesel-powered vehicles that contributes to the basin ' s notorious ozone pollution , its brown haze and its particulates , which are small pieces of carbon soot and dust that lodge_in lungs and cause respiratory_disease . At stake are measures that would eliminate about 270 tons of nitrogen_oxides , or NOx , each day . Under the mayor ' s strategy , 50 % of NOx would be removed from the region ' s air -- or 540 tons a day -- compared to 79 % under the AQMD ' s original plan . In particular , the city wants much less stringent rules for the region ' s airports , trains , ships and heavy-duty trucks . The trucking and airline industries have been vocal opponents of the rules , saying they would be forced to slash flights and the hauling of goods to and from the region . Riordan and local business_leaders say the measures would drive_up costs so_much that shippers and other interstate commerce would move business to other major cities and ports such_as Seattle and San Diego . Implementing the AQMD ' s entire plan would cost business and consumers in the four counties $ 5.4 billion a year through 2010 , according to the AQMD ' s economic report . The mayor ' s office says its strategy could cut that loss by $ 3.2 billion a year . City staff_members have suggested that instead of tough controls on the urban transportation sources , particulates could be tackled in future years by looking_for additional ways to eliminate natural dust that blows into the air from unpaved roads and lots , particularly in San Bernardino County . That has upset many Inland Empire officials , who say that Los Angeles is trying to shift the burden of controlling particulates to them . Under Wedaa ' s strategy , the AQMD would promise to the federal_government that it would reduce enough NOx to achieve federal standards for ozone , the main ingredient of smog . But it would take_up to two more years allowed under federal law to come_up with additional measures to tackle particulates . &quot; We ' re probably just delaying the pain , &quot; Wedaa said in an interview . &quot; But we ' re doing_it because we have a lack of upfront information . I object to strong rules until we know more. &quot; Wedaa said he will convene two conferences of experts to try to devise more economical ways to reduce particulates . Barry Wallerstein , AQMD deputy executive_officer , originally was opposed to the mayor ' s strategy . But he said Tuesday that deferring the diesel proposals in the version submitted to the EPA will not harm public health because they will remain in the AQMD ' s plan . But environmentalists disagree . They say that without a commitment to the EPA , the measures would carry no weight and would be put_on the back burner by the AQMD as well as by the EPA , which is to formulate its own backup clean-air plan for the region by February . &quot; The city ' s real motivation was to send something less aggressive to the EPA , &quot; said Denny Zane of the Coalition for Clean Air . &quot; Now there won ' t be a strong target for the EPA. &quot; Riordan ' s aides , however , say the AQMD plan is unworkable , since it relies_on technology for clean-burning heavy-duty engines that is yet to be developed . State Air Resources Board staff_members agree . ARB officials said there is no current way to eliminate three-quarters of the NOx in the basin by 2010 , as the AQMD proposes . Under the Clean Air Act , the AQMD and state board have until Nov . 15 to submit a final plan to the EPA that outlines how the Southland will meet health standards for ozone , the main ingredient of smog . If the deadline is missed , the EPA could impose sanctions on the region next year , including a freeze on federal highway funds and bans on new polluting businesses .</TEXT>
