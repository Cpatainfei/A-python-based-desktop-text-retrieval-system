   <HEADLINE> TRACKING THE KILLER_BEES ; AS THE FABLED AFRICANIZED HONEYBEES MAKE THEIR WAY TOWARD CALIFORNIA , A FEW MEN HAVE BEEN PATROLLING THE FRONT_LINES OF THE INVASION : THE BEE COWBOYS OF SOUTH TEXAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. 83 is a crooked line in the Rio Grande Valley . Hawks ride heat currents over the road . The chirr of dog-day_cicadas , summer insects that solicit sex by rattling sheets of skin under their bellies , gives August afternoons a sound like the sizzle on a grill . Highway 83 runs north and west near Brownsville , paralleling the big river to the south . A poster on a phone pole reads &quot; Buy your life_insurance now ! The killer_bees are here. &quot; Weslaco , a hot , flat town with a population of 26 # 000 , straddles the highway between Brownsville and Laredo . Here in the toe tip of Texas , a clutch of cinder-block buildings shimmers in 100-degree heat . This is the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station , an outpost of the United States Honeybee Management Program , which started doing &quot; killer_bee &quot; research in 1990 . I was in Weslaco doing research for a book on pest control . Like everyone else , I had heard tall_tales about superbees at the border . I went_to the Rio Grande Valley three years ago because that was where the insects were entering the United States . It is the only part of the country where killer_bees are an established fact of life , a regional hazard like scorpions and hurricanes . I knew that what happened in Texas -- widespread fear , occasional stingings , bee-safety programs in schools -- was coming soon to other Sun Belt states . ( The bees have now entered California ; they should reach Los Angeles next year. ) From my first encounter with the bees and the people who hunt them to my most recent chat with a Texas bee specialist , the level of panic there has died_down . That seems to be the pattern of this invasion : initial frenzy followed by something close to normalcy . Only Texans have lived with the bees long enough to reach that point , however . For others in the Southwest , bee problems lie ahead . Californians can learn from government scientists stationed in Texas as well as from regular folks who have adapted to the bees and now view them with respect rather than terror . But the ones who know the most are the few government workers who are the grunts in this battle , the ones who have manned the front_lines since the bees came north . These men are the ones who know what happens when the first wave of killer_bees arrives . They ' re the hands-on experts in their field -- the hard-bitten and hard-stung &quot; bee cowboys &quot; of South Texas . On my first day in the Rio Grande Valley , I found Jim Sopczyk and Waylon Chandler in the parking_lot behind the Ag Station , disputing . Sopczyk and Chandler were apiary inspectors . Such men ordinarily check commercial beehives for parasitic mites and diseases like foulbrood . But when the first Africanized bees ( so called because their progenitors were imported from Africa to Brazil ) entered the United States four years ago , Sopczyk and Chandler became bee_killers . Sopczyk , 44 , is moon-faced , with windblown hair the color of honey . That day he wore his usual expression , that of a man whose tongue tastes like a lemon . Chandler , 74 years old , is tall and leathery , with short gray hair and silver-framed spectacles that mirror the sun . He took a fat burlap sack from the bed of his pickup_truck . &quot; African ? &quot; Sopczyk asked . Chandler nodded . &quot; They looked African to me . They sounded African , so I killed ' em as African. &quot; He upended the sack . About 3 # 000 crisp dead bees spilled_out . They smelled vaguely sweet , piling_up like Cracker Jack . Africanized &quot; killer &quot; bees look_like any other bees . This batch could not be officially identified , Sopczyk told me , until he sent a_few to a USDA lab that was open for business 24 hours a day , seven days a week . There , entomologists would use microscopes to confirm what Waylon Chandler claimed he already knew . &quot; African bees take_off with a noise like a fiddle , a fiddle tuning_up , &quot; he said . &quot; My daddy played the fiddle , so I know. &quot; Sopczyk knew it was scientifically impossible to identify bees by ear . Still , he could not dispute his partner ' s folk wisdom . Sopczyk lost the upper range of his hearing 25 years ago , flying helicopters in Vietnam . &quot; I don ' t know , Waylon , &quot; he said . &quot; Zzzz ! &quot; Chandler ' s face lit_up . &quot; that ' s the sound. &quot; Weslaco ' s bee cowboys were macho men who always worked in their shirt sleeves . They both owned bee suits -- hooded white overalls outfitted with face screens called veils -- but the Rio Grande Valley was too hot for such gear , and they were too proud . Bee suits were fine for the scientists stationed here , but Sopczyk and Chandler , who had each been stung hundreds of times , figured that real men didn ' t wear veils . They were both longtime beekeepers , which is to say bee lovers . They didn ' t enjoy exterminating killer_bees , tough little critters whose main crime was a fierce talent for survival . They took the job to help defend Texans as well as Texas ' $ 11-million-plus beekeeping industry , which relies_on gentle domestic bees -- the &quot; European &quot; kind -- to make honey and pollinate crops . Productive domestic hives were being infiltrated by invaders from the south , feral insects that were far less eager to serve mankind . Sopczyk and Chandler knew that the invaders were not superbees . Like other bees , they die when they sting , and their stingers dispense no more venom than those of other bees . But it is also true that while a threatened colony of Eurobees might sting an intruder a dozen times , pursuing him for 100 yards , a killer colony stings en masse and may chase its victims for a mile . &quot; We ' ve been lucky so far , &quot; Sopczyk said . So far , only one American has died under a blanket of the new bees . It happened last year when a valley rancher , Lino Lopez , took a torch to a feral colony . The bees ' stings , combined with the elderly Lopez ' s panic , stopped his heart . I asked the bee men why there hadn ' t been more deaths . They had a four fold answer . One , the Rio Grande Valley , the first part of the United States to be invaded , was too sparsely populated to furnish many human targets . Two , the war had just begun ; the early ' 90s were a prologue , with billions of bad bees still to come . Three , those Weslaco cowboys , Chandler and Sopczyk , probably scared a lot of bees away . And four , luck . Killer_bees may respond to threats explosively , but they don ' t fly very fast , with a top speed of 15 miles per hour . Escaping is as easy as fleeing from the &quot; Frankenstein &quot; movie monster : You ' ll be fine as long as you don ' t trip and twist your ankle . Nodding at the mound of dead bees in Chandler ' s truck , Sopczyk alluded to the new bees ' reproductive talent . &quot; that ' s 12 swarms we won ' t have to deal with next year , &quot; he said . Twelve times 2 # 500 , the number of individuals in a small swarm , is 30 # 000 . By killing this swarm , Chandler short-circuited the process and prevented the birth of several million bees a_few years hence . That day , Chandler answered a call from a scared citizen . He fired_up his truck and drove west on U.S. 83 , past cotton fields and green rows of sugar_cane to Roma , Tex. , population 8 # 000 . At that moment , there were as_many bees on a single tree_branch in Roma as there were people in the town . Hanging from a mesquite tree , the Roma swarm was a clump of bees that held one queen , a small coterie of male drones and a_few thousand female workers . Chandler killed them with laundry soap . Why soap ? Entomologists tested many poisons on captive bees . Their experiments had some poignancy : Wooden crosses served as the bees ' Golgotha . &quot; Each hive ' s queen was placed in a wooden cage and taped to the center of the cross to serve as a clustering site , &quot; a researcher reported . One poison &quot; produced a slow death , and immobilized honeybees lay twisting in a mass for about 30 minutes. &quot; One insecticide , resmethrin , killed some bees but merely dispersed others . ( Sopczyk , who has used resmethrin , says it &quot; really roars them up , makes them come_out of a wall like darts . They ' re dead , but they don ' t know it yet. &quot; ) But for Chandler and Sopczyk , the best apicide was plain old detergent . Liquid Tide slicked the bugs ' breathing tubes , allowing the soapy water to enter their bodies . The bees drowned . Chandler bagged his dead swarm and trucked it back to Weslaco . He parked behind the Ag Station , where Sopczyk and I met him . The bee men joked about an endorsement deal : They would n ' t mind appearing on packages of Tide , like the ballplayers on Wheaties boxes . One live bee crawled among the dead in the bed of Chandler ' s truck . She was a worker . Almost all bees are workers , and all workers are female . Each colony includes a_few males , the stingless drones whose sole function is to mate once with a queen , but the society of bees needs far more workers . Workers forage for nectar , fly that precious food to the hive and turn it into honey . They feed the queen and drones , insects so specialized for reproduction that they do not feed themselves . Workers defend and clean the hive and air-condition it with the beating of their wings . They work until they die and are cleaned from the hive by other workers . This one ' s frayed wings betrayed her dotage . She was about a month old . Sopczyk picked her up by the wings . He showed her to me and said , &quot; Here ' s how you take a stinger out. &quot; He jabbed the bee butt-first into the soft flesh of his wrist . &quot; Don ' t pull it . Scrape it out . There ' s a venom sac attached_to the stinger ; if you pull it , you ' ll pump more venom into your arm , &quot; he said . Dropping the bee , he popped the stinger out with an expert flick of his thumbnail . His demo bee crawled zigzags on the tarmac at his feet . Inches away , her disembodied stinger throbbed microscopically as the venom sac contracted , pumping poison . It would continue to cramp for about a minute and might outlive the rest of the bee . She had shot her wad , to use a sexually incorrect phrase . A worker ' s stinger , which is barbed to catch and hold an enemy ' s skin , plucks out her entrails in the act of stinging . Disemboweled , she dies for her kin . &quot; Jim , you killed my one live bee , &quot; Chandler drawled . &quot; Did you want that one ? &quot; &quot; Nah , it ' s OK . I got the queen. &quot; Chandler held the Roma queen , which was floating in alcohol in a four-inch plastic bottle . She was half again a worker ' s size , striped black and gold like a cheerleader ' s skirt . A few days earlier , driven by an idea the poet-essayist Maurice Maeterlinck called &quot; the genius of the race , &quot; this jumbo bee with a brain the size of a pencil point had drawn her thousands from their mother hive into the skies of south Texas . Her swarm was a slowly flying cluster of bees searching for a dark , safe place to hide . Befitting her station in life , the queen lived longer than the rest . A pampered egg machine fed and groomed by 10 generations of her sisters and daughters , she may have been 5 years old . She lived longest even when the U.S. Honeybee Management Program came calling , but Chandler ' s soap was too_much for her . &quot; African , &quot; he said , holding her up for Sopczyk to see . The queen was not noble or dreadful . She was not much of a queen anymore , just a bug . If you were a Texas bee inspector in the early years of the invasion , this is some of what you learned about Africanized bees : In 1956 a Brazilian entomologist , Warwick Kerr , brought queen_bees from South_Africa to his laboratory in Brazil . Kerr admired the African honeybee , which is called AHB in scientific literature . Compared to the European breed ( EHB ) , the African subspecies works harder to turn nectar and pollen into honey , and to turn honey into more and more bees . AHBs had to work hard : They evolved in a region where food is scarce , life cruel and brief . Of course they sting like demons , too -- another result of their harsh habitat . Biology provides a chemical trigger for their temper . When a bee_stings , glands attached_to its stinger release alarm pheromone , a substance that angers other bees and marks the stung foe as a target . AHBs release more alarm pheromone than EHBs and are more sensitive to its scent . While a European sting might incite a dozen more , an AHB sting tends to start a riot of stinging . One USDA study counted 1 # 500 stings in a target exposed for 60 seconds . Kerr hoped to tame the Africanized bees by crossing them with EHBs . He wanted to create a better bee , a hybrid that would make Brazil the world ' s leading honey producer . Instead , 26 of his imported queens slipped out of his experimental hives and escaped into the jungle . Their progeny doubled and redoubled their numbers , sometimes by literally enslaving EHB colonies . If threatened , they dispatched thousands of worker-fighters in an instant . They have been called abejas bravas and abejas asesinas -- &quot; assassins . &quot; Moving northward through South and Central_America , they killed hundreds of people and thousands of animals . Horses and dogs were particularly at risk because they were often tied and could not escape . By 1989 , the bees were in Mexico , just south of the Rio Grande . American officials tried to quell public fears . Killer_bees were not nearly as bad as other dangers , they said . The average American was more likely to be hit by lightning or bitten by a rattlesnake than stung by AHBs . Still , as one bee hunter observed dryly , &quot; Rattlesnakes don ' t fly. &quot; The odds did not help Inn Siang Ooi , a University of Miami graduate_student who took a field trip to Costa Rica in 1986 . He stepped_in a crack just inside a cave , disturbing a feral colony , and from the frightful moment when he knew his foot was stuck until long after he was dead , he was stung almost 8 # 000 times . In October , 1990 , the bees entered Texas . Anita Collins , research leader of the honeybee unit of the USDA ' s Agricultural Research Service in Weslaco , told me that AHBs are a minimal threat to public health . She is more worried about their economic impact . &quot; It ' s an attention-grabbing subject , and the words used by the media -- killer_bees ! -- play_on the fears people have of insects , so we do have to deal with the idea of this giant bee that ' s gonna come_down and carry kids away , &quot; Collins said . &quot; that ' s not reality . Yes , we ' ll have stingings , but the United States has an excellent emergency health-care system , and we will coexist with these bees . But there ' s another concern here . Africanized bees could disrupt beekeeping , and therefore American agriculture. &quot; Collins frets about the billions of dollars ' worth of groceries the EHBs help produce each year -- crops that constitute a third of the American diet . If Kerr ' s bees upset the partnership of pollinating EHBs and Southwest farmers and orchardmen , the result could be disastrous . Last summer , Collins collected AHB semen for injection into EHB queens , hoping to accelerate the hybridization of the two breeds . Success might mean the protection of $ 800 million in crops that EHBs pollinate annually in Texas , and ultimately the defense of a major sector of U.S. agriculture . &quot; As a geneticist , that would really appeal_to me , &quot; she said . It would mean she had created the new , better bee that Warwick Kerr had meant to make . In another Weslaco office sat Collins ' colleague from Texas A &amp; M University , Frank Eischen . A long-faced , gray-bearded man dressed in a white work shirt , jeans and cowboy_boots , he looked_like Freud at a rodeo . On his door was a cartoon showing an angry nest of killer_bees ; under the nest was Winnie the Pooh , keeled_over dead . The new bees are &quot; tough , &quot; Eischen said . &quot; They ' ve been challenged by nature , quite vigorously , and survived. &quot; Along with Collins , his boss , he was launching a program that entailed raising Africanized colonies in Texas , &quot; for research purposes only , and with strict safeguards &quot; to prevent their escape . I asked whether he worried that his safeguards , like Kerr ' s , might fail . &quot; That shouldn ' t happen , but it is my nightmare , &quot; Eischen said . &quot; A pretty little_girl gets stung , or worse -- a pretty little_girl who ' s the daughter of someone important. &quot; Meanwhile , back in Brazil , Warwick Kerr was busy with experiments on a rare breed of bee that cannot sting . In 1991 , a proud , barely chastened Kerr told the New Yorker ' s Wallace White of his many awards and his satisfaction with his career . Would he change anything if he could ? &quot; I would leave those African bees where I found them , &quot; he said . Jim Sopczyk climbed out of his blue Chevy pickup_truck into triple-digit heat . Looking grumpy , as usual , he squinted at a stucco apartment block , a pair of rusted sedans , a tricycle , a rooster chasing a hen under wash lines hung with laundry . He ambled around the block , peering up through sparse branches , and found what he was looking_for in a desert_willow . A clump of long , slender insects buzzed around a papery nest the size and color of a softball . &quot; False alarm , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s wasps. &quot; Sopczyk trudged to his truck . He returned carrying a Sears Craftsman leaf blower . Switching the blower ' s control to reverse , yanking its starter , he aimed it at the wasps . With a thwop , the nest disappeared down the leaf blower ' s barrel . He waved the barrel in the air , collecting stragglers , then touched it to the ground , sucking_up a pound or more of dirt , burying the wasps inside the machine . &quot; That ' ll do_it , &quot; he said . There were five apiary inspectors in Texas , but only the two based at Weslaco , Sopczyk and his partner Chandler , were primarily bee_killers . Chandler was a canny old lifer , while Sopczyk , at 44 , was &quot; the youngster , &quot; as Chandler put it . The youngster made no effort to hide his disdain for his bosses , the &quot; paper pushers &quot; the government had sent here , but he liked the regular folks of the valley so_much that he changed the pronunciation of his name to suit them . Texans had trouble seeing Sopczyk and saying &quot; Sop-chik , &quot; so he became Subject . Everyone called him Jim Subject . The business_card he handed you when your bees were dead in the yard read &quot; Jim Sopczyk ( Subject ) , Apiary Inspector. &quot; Regular folks were scared . They thought anything that flew , crawled or buzzed was a killer_bee . Sopczyk saved a terrified woman from what she said were brown killer_bees crawling up her porch . &quot; Lady , those are ants , &quot; he said . A man called Weslaco to say he ' d seen the bees tearing branches from trees . A priest heard a buzz in his rectory wall ; calling_for help , he said , &quot; I ' m sorry , but I don ' t do exorcisms. &quot; There were real alarms as well . Sopczyk chased bees that were_on a cherry picker at a construction site , where a swarm had clustered near a welder . He killed AHBs in irrigation culverts , doghouses , a choir_loft and an oil derrick . One swarm had taken_over a mothballed copying machine and begun merrily turning_out honey . He often visited homes where the bees had built honeycombs in wall voids . Unless there were mice around to feast on the comb after Sopczyk did his job , homeowners might soon be treated to a strange sight : the dead colony ' s honey , no longer cooled by workers ' wings , melting through cracks in the walls . In the end , bee trouble always has to do with protecting honey . Plants offer nectar , a sweet liquid , to bees in exchange for pollination services . Worker_bees collecting nectar inadvertently gather pollen on their bodies and take it to other flowers , allowing plants to reproduce . The colors and patterns of flowers , so cherished by lovers and poets , are actually advertisements for bees -- enticing signals to the 12 # 000 eyes in a bee ' s head . Finding a new apple_tree or flower bed , a worker_bee hurries home to her sisters . Her agitation alerts them to the good news she brings . The intricate gyre she performs in the pitch-dark hive -- quickly copied by her kin , passed from body to body in a humming mass -- relays her news . As she dances , the worker imparts the location of her discovery in terms of the sun ' s position . If her find was sunward from the hive , she moves directly up the honeycomb . If it was in the opposite direction , she moves straight down . Angles to the left or right indicate other directions with perfect precision . Distance is told by the speed of her dance . The level of her agitation , ranging from mild to feverish , tells the richness of the food source . This is the way that worker_bees make maps , shouting their good_fortune by dancing in the dark . EHB and AHB workers dance the same way . Africanized bees , however , are readier to defend themselves and their honey , the hive ' s only fuel . Their history holds the reason : Unlike the pampered bugs of Europe and America , AHBs evolved in a cruel African habitat . They fought predators as though their survival was at stake every day , which it was . In Weslaco , Sopczyk grabbed the phone . He spent a minute calming a worried taxpayer . &quot; No , it ' s probably wasps . If the nest is small , and you ' re only seeing a_few . . . . &quot; His voice wasn ' t the only sound in the room . Sopczyk ' s office hummed with the insistent white_noise of trapped bees . Atop a rank of file_cabinets were 23 coffee_cans he had commandeered from trash baskets in the Ag Station . Bees_flew inside the cans . They bounced audibly off the wire mesh taped to the cans ' open ends , their buzz a shade more shrill than that of free honeybees . These were angry , frustrated insects . Before his next wasp chase , Sopczyk took time to explain his canned bees . The diameter of a coffee_can , he said , neatly matched the mouth of his leaf blower . So he would cut the bottom off an empty can , making a tube , then tape wire mesh over one end . The can now plugged into the leaf blower ' s barrel like a silencer on a gun , with the screened end inside the barrel . By switching the blower to reverse , he could sample killer_bees . &quot; They fly_by that barrel and make a quick turn . Pop ! &quot; After catching 10 to 20 workers , he would fit the can ' s lid onto its outward end , trapping them . Then he could kill the rest of the bees and bring his sample back to Weslaco . Of course , no invention is perfect . The gas-powered blower could run_for nine minutes . &quot; One time , a real spicy colony , I thought I was going_to run_out of gas before I ran_out of bees , &quot; he said . With no time to fetch his soap sprayer , he kept filling coffee_cans until there were too few bees to kill him . After that he never forgot to top_off the blower ' s gas_tank before work . The cans in Sopczyk ' s office would not hum for long . Every few days he left some of them in a freezer overnight . Doubly trapped now , the bees would briefly form a tight ball to share body heat -- their instinctive response to cold_weather -- before they died . If the bees had been involved in a serious stinging incident , he dropped a_few of them into plastic specimen_bottles and sent them Airborne Express to a government lab in Beltsville , Md . As for the frozen dead that were not sent to Beltsville , AHBs and EHBs alike went_into the trash , sharing space as they never did_in the wild . Again the phone buzzed . &quot; This is Jim Subject , &quot; he said . &quot; OK , how many do you see ? &quot; Waylon Chandler ambled into the room . He gave his partner a quick salute . &quot; Stay there . Not too close . I ' ll be right out , &quot; Sopczyk said . Hanging up , he looked_at Chandler . &quot; This guy wants to know what we ' re gonna do about all these bees. &quot; &quot; Well , Jim , I think we should kill them. &quot; Sopczyk drove west on Texas 107 . He zigged onto a dirt road that led to a gravel drive that led to a hackberry tree , where a large swarm had come_to rest . Eleazar Zamora lived_in a brick house the color of a Folgers coffee_can . Zamora , a welder who had come_home from work to keep_an_eye_on his children , popped_out of the house when Sopczyk arrived . &quot; I was scared the kids would bother the bees , &quot; he said . He was also worried for his mother , who watched wide-eyed from a window in a long white trailer next door , firing questions in Spanish . Her son replied in English , &quot; It ' s OK , it ' s OK , it ' s OK. &quot; He showed Sopczyk the bees . They were eight feet up in the hackberry , which spread its dry branches between the trailer and a blue Camaro . &quot; Probably African , &quot; Sopczyk said . &quot; Good bees don ' t swarm much this time of year. &quot; He said they might stay overnight , maybe two nights , and then move_on . But if the workers kept scouting the area without finding a better home , they might build a nest here . That meant honey , eggs and larvae , which the bees would fight for . &quot; Then they ' d go_after anything that bugged them -- a lawn_mower , a car engine , a kid throwing rocks. &quot; The swarm was the size of a bowling_ball and contained about 4 # 000 bees . Its mother colony had grown so large , the queen ' s pheromonal messages could not pass_easily among so many bees , so it was time to swarm , to make two colonies from one . Workers now fed a protein-rich substance , royal_jelly , to an ordinary larva , creating a new queen . Other workers seized the old queen . Pushing and biting , they forced her to the hive ' s entrance . She was carried along with thousands of her sisters as the swarm burst from the nest and flew in tight formation around her , finally pausing in Eleazar Zamora ' s yard . The swarm was silent . The buzzing of bees is the sound of their wings beating , but wings weren ' t needed now . These bees were content to crawl among each other , protecting and warming their queen . Sopczyk used his leaf blower to fill a coffee_can , reaching up_to whisk a dozen bees from the clump . The rest of the swarm did not object . He went_to the truck for his soap sprayer . It was a Chapin poly tank , hard blue plastic with a 1.3-gallon tank , the sort of sprayer gardeners use to kill aphids . The tank held an inch of Liquid Tide . Sopczyk found a garden_hose by the house . He filled the tank and pumped up the pressure by hand , pressing the pump ' s handle until it moved like a spoon in cold honey . He squeezed the sprayer ' s trigger . Sudsy water shot 20 feet , a jet of bubbles in the sun . &quot; Do you want to see how they feel ? &quot; he asked me . I followed his gaze . &quot; How the bees feel ? &quot; &quot; You can touch them . They won ' t sting , &quot; he said with a twist of his lip . &quot; Probably. &quot; It was tempting . I knew that swarms were far less dangerous than established colonies . But AHB swarms had been known to turn killer in no time . Sopczyk stood_by with his poison Tide . He would protect me . The risk was dozens of stings , not thousands . Still , thinking_of boyhood stings , the fiery bite of one stinger in my bare foot , I looked_for a reason to keep my hands in my pockets . &quot; They ' re up too high , &quot; I said . Zamora stole that excuse by dragging a cement block to the tree . Sopczyk nodded his approval . I stood on the block and reached up . I expected the swarm to feel rough , all those stingers as prickly as cactus spines , but the bees ' stingers were sheathed now ; I was no imminent threat . The swarm was warm_to the touch . It was soft , a living beanbag calmly rustling under my fingertips . I probed the bee ball , moving my fingers into and under its surface . The bees made room for me . Soon my hand was part of the swarm . Collins had told me that swarming bees could be gentle as lambs , but these were gentler . A lamb flees a stranger ' s hand . This swarm accepted my hand , incorporated it , moved and breathed under and between my fingers , gentle as a swarm of killer_bees . I parted from them reluctantly when Sopczyk said it was time . &quot; Do you want to spray them ? &quot; he said . &quot; No , thanks. &quot; Zamora and I flinched when Sopczyk ' s spray hit the bees . They dropped_off the cluster in chunks . Finally Sopczyk sprayed the last chunk . It fell , and then he stomped it dead , 100 or so bees , including the queen . There were dozens of bees in the air . They flew drunkenly , heavy-winged and poisoned . A worker landed on my shirt . She crawled to my shoulder where I could see her up close . She was trying to clean her eyes . She scraped with quick mechanical strokes , her forelegs moving like windshield_wipers , until one leg tapped one lens or a small group of them -- the most clouded or painful , it seemed to me -- with special worry for a moment before the robot impulse reasserted itself and her legs worked again in failed concert all_over her eyes . Before long , she tumbled down my sleeve . IN 38 YEARS , THE OFF-spring of Warwick Kerr ' s handful of queen_bees have colonized two continents , 20 nations and more_than 6 million square_miles . There are perhaps a_trillion of them south of the border , many millions in Texas , and soon there will be millions in California . Last spring , Africanized bees were detected in Yuma , Ariz. , three miles from the California border . A few have been detected in Imperial County , with Riverside and San Diego counties next on the list . They will colonize Los Angeles soon , perhaps by next summer . Local schoolchildren can see bee-safety videos on Channel 58 , and the Los Angeles County Fire_Department has ordered 1 # 000 bee suits . Unfortunately , because of complex regulations , the best pesticide is against the rules here . Using laundry soap to kill bees currently violates California law . Individual states must specifically allow a particular poison to be used on a particular pest ; using soap on aphids , for instance , is perfectly legal in California , but the state has yet to officially allow soap on bees . &quot; we ' ll use foam , &quot; said a Fire_Department spokesman , apparently unaware of what Texans have learned : Foam from fire_extinguishers angers the bees without hurting them very much . that ' s why , when a feral colony of a couple thousand AHBs hitchhiked from Guatemala to Los Angeles on a cargo_ship in July , it took hooded , veiled government workers 90 minutes to kill them -- a job Sopczyk could have done_in five minutes . No one knows what will happen when AHBs swarm Los Angeles County . Elba Quintero , national coordinator of the USDA ' s Africanized Honeybee Program , advises caution but not fear . &quot; It is OK for people in California to be concerned , to be more aware of bees , &quot; Quintero says , &quot; but they shouldn ' t be scared . They should remember that we have had Africanized bees in this country for four years now , and only one person has died. &quot; As recently as Aug . 23 , however , Christopher Graves was stung 1 # 000 times in Robstown , Tex. , just north of the Valley . He survived . In the end , Africanized bees are not really much of a threat to public health . Still , they change the lives of people who encounter them . Frank Eischen , the biologist and bee admirer , now packs a syringe and a dose of adrenaline , the bee venom antidote , in his first_aid kit . &quot; You can ' t be too careful , &quot; he says . Eischen thanks his lucky stars for one thing : The research project he and Anita Collins launched hasn ' t backfired . Not one of their bees has escaped . More important in the scientists ' view , however , are three other recent discoveries . The first is geographic : As wild AHBs move farther north , &quot; they ' re running out of steam , &quot; says Eischen . He suspects that North_America ' s chilly climate will finally stop the bees cold ; they may never claim much territory north of Los Angeles , Dallas and Atlanta . A second positive sign is that AHBs seem to be susceptible to a common parasitic mite called varroa , which might also slow their northward advance . A third new development is more ominous . It shows what talented survivors AHBs can be . In her lab , Weslaco science chief Collins has seen Africanized queens developing faster than their European counterparts . The difference may be only a_few hours , but timing is all that matters in the wild . When a colony needs a new queen , workers feed royal_jelly to many larvae -- the white worms growing in the hive ' s wax incubators -- but only the quickest survives . Upon hatching , she kills all other royal larvae , her potential rivals , before settling_down to produce millions of eggs of_her_own kind . By hatching first , one AHB larva ( the result of one mating among the dozen or so the previous EHB queen may have had ) can turn a tame hive into a killer_bee assembly_line . AS THE BEES MOVED -- north from the Rio Grande Valley toward Houston , apiary inspector Waylon Chandler followed them . Sopczyk ' s old partner now stands_sentinel in Jasper County near the Louisiana border . His job is to catch and sample swarms in_order to help scientists track AHBs ' progress -- though he would surely recognize them by their sound . &quot; There ' s not any here yet , &quot; Chandler says , &quot; but I ' m looking_out for them . Some beekeepers are about to throw_up their hands and quit . Other people here don ' t know what to think , but they ' ll be as excitable as folks in the valley once those bad bees get here -- excitable like the bees. &quot; Jim Sopczyk stayed in the Valley . Soon after he wiped_out the swarm on Zamora ' s property , he killed 10 # 000 AHBs attached_to a trailer in Santa Rosa , Tex . They dished_out more_than 200 stings to the trailer ' s owner before she escaped . But Sopczyk bent a rule . Apiary inspectors are allowed to kill any bees they find in the open and were encouraged to call_in licensed exterminators to kill bees inside or attached_to someone ' s home . &quot; A technicality , &quot; he sniffed . &quot; If there are people around who might get stung , I ' m going_to do my job. &quot; After the Santa Rosa job , he was cautioned by Paul Jackson , the state ' s chief inspector , who said Sopczyk had screwed_up , &quot; rashly killing &quot; killer_bees . &quot; My reaction to that was ' Go_to hell , ' &quot; said Sopczyk . Soon Jackson , who was short on payroll funds -- and who had already been irritated when Sopczyk spoke freely to a reporter -- offered Sopczyk a transfer to San Antonio : 19 hours a week with a cut_in pay . Sopczyk said no . But though he still had his leaf blower and soap sprayer , as a private citizen he could kill bees only in his own back yard . &quot; I finally found something I ' m good at , and they won ' t let me do_it . I can ' t do anything , &quot; he said , shortly after , &quot; because I ' m not an exterminator. &quot; So he read books and took tests until he became a licensed exterminator , and today Sopczyk is president , serviceman and janitor for his own pest-control firm , Associated Critter Control . &quot; I ' m out there struggling , getting_about a third of my work from bees. &quot; As Sopczyk ' s &quot; nasty little she-devils &quot; move north and west into California , it is worth remembering that Apis_mellifera isn ' t the only adaptable species . In Brazil , beekeepers have learned caution : They now approach their AHB hives with veils and thick gloves , and Brazil ' s honey production -- thanks to hard-working Africanized bees -- is much higher than ever before . In fact , the story will probably be the same here . Early panic will be followed by a transitional period , a territorial war between humans and bees . The war will be followed in turn by a tense coexistence -- an uneasy truce between two deadly species , them and us .</TEXT>
