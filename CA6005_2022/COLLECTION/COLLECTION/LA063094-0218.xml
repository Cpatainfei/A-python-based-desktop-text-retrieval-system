   <HEADLINE> ARAFAT TO VISIT JERICHO , GAZA THIS WEEKEND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After weeks of hesitation , PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat announced Wednesday that he will visit the Gaza Strip and West_Bank town of Jericho this weekend , a historic return inaugurating the new Palestinian Authority that now governs the regions after 27 years of Israeli occupation . &quot; I am coming ! &quot; Arafat excitedly told Nabil Shaath , now the authority ' s senior minister in the Gaza Strip , in a pre-dawn telephone_call from the Tunis , Tunisia , headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization . &quot; I am going_back home ! &quot; Arafat ' s visit -- his first to the Palestinian territories since 1967 -- should bring hundreds of thousands of people into the streets and galvanize Palestinians ' efforts to establish their own government in Gaza and Jericho , then extend its authority across the whole West_Bank . &quot; This will be a historic day that Palestinian people have waited for a long_time , &quot; said Dr. Ahmed Tibi , an Arafat adviser in Jerusalem . &quot; It symbolizes the beginning of a long trip for reconstruction and independence. &quot; The suddenness of Arafat ' s decision , catching PLO and Israeli officials alike by surprise , initially put the timing in doubt , as the Israelis scrambled to make security arrangements . But Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , committed to honoring Israel ' s accord with the PLO on Palestinian self-government , agreed to a three-day visit . He reportedly told his generals and security chiefs that the question was not whether Arafat would come but how Israel would cope_with the visit . He then gave them until this morning to develop a plan . &quot; The prime_minister decided to allow this visit after considering all security considerations , and the visit will take_place starting this Saturday , &quot; Environment Minister Yossi Sarid announced on Rabin ' s behalf . Israel ' s right-wing opposition , including Jewish settlers from the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , began , in turn , to plan massive demonstrations in Jerusalem that they said would paralyze the capital -- even though Arafat has not asked to come_to pray at the Islamic shrines here . &quot; This is a national embarrassment , allowing a murderer to enter Gaza and Jericho , &quot; said Benjamin Netanyahu , chairman of the opposition Likud Party , predicting Arafat will try to come_to Jerusalem . &quot; The people feel this is a humiliation . With this visit of Arafat , the countdown begins toward a Palestinian Arab state whose goal is the destruction of Israel. &quot; Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert also said he believes Arafat might try to sneak into the holy_city on Saturday , the Sabbath , when religious Jews could not organize a demonstration . Settler groups already have plans to bring more_than 100 # 000 protesters to Jerusalem starting today to prevent such a visit . &quot; Arafat is the master terrorist , and we will do what we can to make_sure that life in this country will be disrupted , &quot; Aharon Domb of the Council of Jewish Communities of Judea , Samaria and Gaza said . &quot; We don ' t mind Arafat visiting the Land of Israel , but in handcuffs and on his way to trial as an arch-murderer. &quot; The group offered a $ 33 # 000 reward for Arafat ' s &quot; capture &quot; but withdrew a mock &quot; wanted poster &quot; that put a price on his head &quot; dead or alive &quot; after Israeli authorities ruled that it amounted to an incitement to murder . A former chief rabbi , Shlomo Goren , citing the PLO ' s past terrorist acts , again called_on Jews to kill Arafat as a religious obligation . An Arafat visit to Jerusalem could trigger violence because of emotions that surround the city , regarded_as sacred by Jews , Muslims and Christians . Jerusalem ' s future will probably be the most serious , sensitive issue in negotiations on a full peace settlement , with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital . Arafat decided to come_to Gaza and Jericho despite concerns -- among them numerous assassination threats -- about his own security , Shaath said . &quot; Mr. Arafat took a lot of risks in the struggle to go_home , so this will not be a deterrent , &quot; he said . &quot; But our police are preparing_for all_the security requirements as are the Israeli army and police on their side. &quot; Arafat had been expected to arrive in Jericho and the Gaza Strip earlier this month but put_off the visit , apparently to pressure Western donors to provide $ 600 million they had promised to underwrite the Palestinian Authority in its first year of operation . Over the last week , some PLO officials had grown less optimistic about his early arrival in the autonomous regions ; Shaath on Tuesday said he thought Arafat would come no earlier than mid-July and maybe much later . But others -- including Mahmoud Abbas ( Abu Maazen ) , an architect of the secret talks in Oslo that produced the breakthrough peace agreement with Israel -- have urged Arafat to make_good on his pledge to come_home to the Palestinian territories , Palestinian sources said . To delay , while demanding more money from the international community , made_it appear that the PLO chairman is &quot; for_sale , &quot; one PLO official said in Cairo . Another Palestinian observed , &quot; It ' s a political statement -- that he ' s there for his people . Once you announce you ' re going to go , you have to go. &quot; Arafat , who is scheduled to meet representatives of donor countries in Paris next week , will insist on stronger international backing before he returns to Gaza and Jericho to stay , PLO officials said . So far , donors have offered to release $ 42 million to last through August . Arafat received letters Wednesday from Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown assuring him of U.S. support for West_Bank and Gaza Strip development . Shaath , minister of planning and international cooperation in the Palestinian Authority , did not explain the eight-week delay from the signing of the self-government agreement with Israel , but said Arafat felt the moment was right for his arrival in the Gaza Strip . &quot; Many positive signs &quot; in recent days paved the way , Shaath said , citing talks Tuesday on extending self-rule to the rest of the West_Bank and the easing of travel restrictions on PLO officials moving from Jericho to Gaza . On Wednesday , Israel freed about 400 of the 4 # 000 to 6 # 000 Palestinians it is still holding_in its prisons and detention camps , a key step toward widening the scope of its peace accord with the PLO . Israeli authorities say they have now freed about 4 # 000 of 5 # 000 prisoners they promised to release under autonomy agreements . Arrangements for Arafat ' s visit were uncertain Wednesday because of the haste with which it is being arranged . Egyptian officials said Arafat would likely fly from Cairo to a military airfield near the Egyptian-Israeli border at Rafah , then drive the short distance across the border to the Gaza Strip . But Israeli officials said he would probably arrive by helicopter . PLO officials said Arafat would travel_to Jericho , but Israeli authorities said they have not been notified of that plan . Arafat and Rabin are unlikely to meet during the visit , but they plan to hold talks next week in Paris , where they will jointly receive a peace prize .
