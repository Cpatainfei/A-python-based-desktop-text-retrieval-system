   <HEADLINE> WESTSIDE / COVER STORY ; A MAN OF STEEL ; DAVID ALTMAN RISES ABOVE HIS DEBILITATING , LIFELONG ' TIN MAN ' S ' DISEASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> David Altman is a young_man in motion . And that ' s the story -- a miracle actually . Altman , 23 , was never expected to walk again , much less pace the floor as he did recently , talking_about his return from the brink of oblivion . He was never expected to gesture with his gnarled hands , jabbing them in the air as if he were a conductor gearing_up for a crescendo . Or to graduate from UCLA this spring with a 3.85 grade point average . Or to get a perfect score on the law_school admissions test , winning a spot at UCLA School_of_Law . As a boy of 10 , Altman developed a very bad case of a rare disease -- dermatomyositis , an inflammation of the skin and muscles that is debilitating , and sometimes fatal . In Altman ' s case , the disease was for years a living death . His body produced huge sheets of rock-hard calcium , literally entombing him in a self-made body cast . &quot; I had my own personal body_armor , &quot; Altman says . Sometimes the calcium would melt on its own , causing painful abscesses that required surgery -- dozens of surgeries . Sometimes doctors tried to remove pieces of it , including a 4 1 / 2-inch-thick chunk that was embedded in Altman ' s backside . Because of the stiffness he will have to battle all_of his days , health_care workers have dubbed his ailment Tin Man ' s disease . &quot; He , indeed , looks_like the Tin Man in the Wizard of Oz , &quot; says Dr. Bram Bernstein , who is David Altman ' s doctor and heads the rheumatology department at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles . Beneath Altman ' s inflexible exterior , however , lies a hero ' s heart and a champion ' s will , say those who know him . And his story offers a formidable lesson in the power of mind over matter . He &quot; is a walking tribute to the human spirit , &quot; UCLA Economics Professor Earl A . Thompson wrote in a recommendation for his former student . &quot; He possesses a truly astounding combination of intellectual ability and sheer physical courage. &quot; Born in Odessa , in the former Soviet_Union , Altman arrived in the United States with his parents , Raisa and Jack , when he was 4 . The family lived_in Detroit , but moved to California in 1979 after a vacation there the year before . They eventually settled in Santa Monica , where they still live . Altman says he remembers vividly the onset of his illness , how the simple chore of sweeping leaves in the back yard gradually became harder -- and finally impossible . His muscles seemed to desert him ; he was always tired . A rash on his hands and face plus a high fever led to a misdiagnosis of the disease as lupus , a related but distinctly different ailment . It took two years , and the persistence of Altman ' s indomitable mother , to obtain the correct diagnosis at Childrens Hospital ' s internationally known rheumatology department . While there are no statistics on the number of juvenile cases of dermatomyositis , Bernstein said he sees one case of it for every 20 cases he sees of juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis -- itself a rare condition afflicting 100 # 000 children nationwide . &quot; The average pediatrician has probably never seen a case , &quot; Bernstein said . The doctor said dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disorder that is possibly caused by a virus . It is treated with anti-inflammatory_drugs , such_as cortisone , and immunosuppressant drugs , like those used to fight cancer . The disease causes painful inflammation of the skin and muscles , especially at the major joints -- hips , shoulders , elbows , knees . * In some children ( adults get the disorder , too ) , internal muscles are affected , deteriorating to_the_point that patients can ' t breathe or their intestines perforate , causing death . David Altman ' s disease took the other common course for children when he developed calcinosis . As a complication of dermatomyositis , the body ' s calcium production mechanism can run amok , laying rock-hard deposits under the skin and sometimes in the muscle tissue itself . Touch Altman ' s arm where there is a calcium deposit , and it feels_like he has a steel_plate embedded there . That was how it felt to Altman , too , who for several years in the ' 80s could not walk , sit or even at times feed himself . &quot; He couldn ' t open his mouth to put_in a teaspoon , &quot; said his mother , an accountant who gave_up her job to care_for her son . Not surprisingly , Altman was depressed and irritable . During those periods when he was not hospitalized , he lay on a gurney in the darkened living_room of his Santa Monica home , wanting no light , no television , no food , no human contact . Every 15 minutes , he had to be repositioned because of the pain . &quot; It was like being crunched between two pieces of calcium , &quot; Altman said . During months of hospitalization , Altman says he was a &quot; beast patient , &quot; lashing_out at nurses , who drew straws to see who would have to care_for him . &quot; I was a jerk ; I really was , &quot; Altman says . If so , he had cause . At times , Altman ' s body was covered with sores that for Bernstein brought_to mind a parable from the Book of Job , in which Satan tested Job ' s faith by covering his body with boils &quot; from the sole of his foot unto his crown. &quot; * The boy ' s broken spirit and body only made Raisa Altman more determined . Jeri Trabin , a hospital social_worker who has worked with the family for nine years , said Raisa was always unyielding where her son ' s treatment was concerned , eventually persuading the state ' s medical bureaucracies to provide care they didn ' t normally approve . &quot; She wasn ' t about to accept things as they were , &quot; Trabin said . &quot; Anything that would increase his chances she would make_sure it would happen. &quot; Altman did still have full use of his brain , and he started exercising it by reading a Sidney Sheldon book his mother had brought_to the hospital in one of many attempts to re-engage her son . Reading became his salvation , but if it brought the world to his bedside , it also made Altman want to rejoin that world . The ' 80s may be called the decade of greed now , but the economic barons who were the best at what they did captured the imagination of the bed-bound teen-ager . &quot; I was a kid reading the Wall_Street Journal and writing ( letters to ) Malcolm Forbes , &quot; said Altman , who was later invited to New York to meet his hero . By this time , Altman had graduated from the gurney to a special , vertical wheelchair for those who cannot bend at the waist . He had also ceased to become a pain_in_the_neck to his care-givers . * Still , his reputation lingered . Trabin said the legend of Altman and his persistent mother spread to other hospitals , which didn ' t want to take him as a patient . Yet , Trabin said , she always saw that what made him a demanding patient could be turned_around to work_on his behalf . &quot; I always saw something bright and shining about him , &quot; Trabin said . The disease stopped progressing in 1986 ; no more calcium deposits grew , but plenty remained . &quot; Since then , I ' ve been trying to roll back all_the things that went_wrong , &quot; Altman said . That , among other things , meant &quot; casting , &quot; a seemingly primitive , but effective , way to increase range of motion . In Altman ' s case , curled-up legs and arms were stretched to_the_point of torture , then put_in a cast . The process is repeated until , inch by inch , range of motion is increased . &quot; It ' s like trying to stretch a rock , &quot; Bernstein said . Ultimately , the casting , accompanied by exhausting work by Altman , paid_off . He recalls using a walker . It took an hour to inch painfully across the family living room . Afterward , Altman said , he was so drenched with sweat , he looked_like he had just gotten_out of the shower . Why did he put himself through this regimen ? &quot; I did_it for my parents , &quot; he said . Finally , during his senior year , Altman was able to attend Santa Monica High full time . Though he needed a boost to get_out of his wheelchair , Altman , using crutches , made_it across the stage to pick_up his diploma . At UCLA , Altman said he was so excited to be there , he threw the crutches away in three months . To say that he blossomed at the Westwood campus is an understatement . &quot; Students tend to flock to him , drawn by his wonderful sense_of_humor , his dry wit and his exceptional knowledge and intellect , &quot; said history Professor Mary Yeager in a recommendation . &quot; I observed his intellectual and personal generosity toward others many times. &quot; * Though Altman ' s intellectual and social life soared , his body still betrayed him . Describing Altman ' s condition , Thompson , the economic professor , wrote in his recommendation : &quot; I have never seen a student attend lectures with physical ailments so bad that he could neither sit_down , stand straight nor lean up against a support ; that he could neither write nor hold his note pad straight or steady ; that he could scarcely move without a wince from the pain. &quot; The pain was from abscesses that formed when some of the calcium deposits liquefied . Surgeries provided the only relief , but Altman insisted on postponing them , refusing to miss a test , after missing years of classes during his junior_high years . His mother said that often , she would pick him up after an exam and take him straight to the hospital for an operation . Despite all that , Altman made_it through college in five years . * This summer , Altman is working part time at the John E . Anderson Graduate_School of Management Library while waiting for law_school to begin . He expects to return to Childrens Hospital this month for yet another surgery aimed at improving mobility in his elbow_joints . Altman ' s professional goal is to be the &quot; J.P. Morgan of the super-information highway. &quot; His personal goal is to work toward independent living , though his frozen back , locked shoulders and hips continue to preclude him from that -- at least for now . Those who know Altman are betting_on him -- even to overcome the one academic goal that has eluded him -- entrance to Stanford_University Law_School . Since he was 15 , Altman has been telling everyone at the hospital that he was going_to Stanford . To his perhaps naive astonishment , the law_school did not admit him ; despite his perfect score on the entrance exam , he was placed on the waiting list . Reflecting on Altman ' s reaction to earlier setbacks , Trabin said : &quot; If there was anything else like that ( rejection ) , it would mean absolutely nothing to him or his mother , &quot; Trabin said . &quot; They would just go_on . Stanford may never hear the end of it. &quot;</TEXT>
