   <HEADLINE> ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH : EXECUTIVE TRAVEL ; PROGRAM HELPS KEEP U.S. BUSINESS-FRIENDLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A pilot_program that cuts paperwork for international business travel got an 11th-hour revival from Congress this week when members of the House voted to continue the Visa Waiver Pilot_Program . The visa waiver program allows foreign business_travelers and tourists from 22 eligible nations to travel_to the United States without visas . Although Americans were accustomed to being able to travel widely without acquiring visas , especially in Europe , visitors from other countries had generally needed to prove they were not likely to try to stay in the U.S. permamently and often faced an annoying series of steps to get a visa . The waiver program , started in 1988 , recognized that free flow of business and leisure travelers would benefit international trade and was worth the small risk of allowing residents of certain developed countries to travel freely in the U.S. Also , some countries , such_as France and Japan , agreed to drop visa requirements for U.S. visitors when the program began . * Obtaining visas can be a hassle for foreign business_travelers and tourists , said Greg Farmer , U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism . South_Korean travelers , for example , are not covered by the program and must still obtain a visa to travel_to the United States . A South_Korean business owner could quickly get_to Canada to nail_down a deal but not the U.S. &quot; Despite great efforts by the U.S. embassy in Seoul , there are lengthy lines for obtaining a U.S. visa , &quot; Farmer said . &quot; However , Canada allows South_Koreans to enter its territory without a visa and Australia issues visas to South_Koreans within 24 hours , making these countries more competitive than ours. &quot; The program extension , which is part of a bill called the Technical Corrections Act , now goes_to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , which must act before Sept . 30 . The Air Transport Assn. , a Washington-based trade group representing the airline industry , as well as the Commerce_Department , has been lobbying for the last month to make_sure the program doesn ' t lapse . The program currently waives visa requirements for travelers from nations including Britain , the United Kingdom , Japan , France , Switzerland , Germany , Sweden , Italy and the_Netherlands , for stays of less than 90 days in the United States . Only countries that have demonstrated that their citizens pose a low risk of illegal immigration to the United States can participate . To be eligible , countries must have had a low rate of visa refusals ( less than 2 % ) and visa overstays ( less than 2 % ) for the previous two years . &quot; The value of the program to international visitors is demonstrated by the growth in its use , &quot; Farmer said . &quot; In 1988 , only 10 % of the total arrivals from the first eligible countries used the program . By 1993 , 70 % of total arrivals ( from ) nine of the primary countries used the visa waiver. &quot; * About 10 million foreign visitors to the U.S. are expected to travel without visas this year . According to the Commerce_Department , 95 % of travelers from Japan now arrive without visas , 67 % from Britain , 73 % from Germany , 78 % from France , 79 % from Italy , 61 % from Switzerland , 75 % from the_Netherlands , 50 % from New Zealand and 62 % from Sweden . &quot; The visa waiver is useful at a_couple_of different levels , &quot; said Air Transport Assn . spokesman Chris Chiames . &quot; It makes the last-minute business meeting possible for a European businessman who finds_out he needs to attend a meeting in the United States. &quot; It also makes_it easier for international business_travelers to take quick advantage of air fare deals without worrying about visa applications , he said . &quot; The program was started as a way of making travel easier for foreign travelers and work of the U.S._government easier , &quot; said Gary Sheaffer , spokesman for the U.S. Department_of_State . It has cut_down the number of visas processed by some consulates by tens of thousands . The program may only be used by travelers who would otherwise have qualified for a visa . Travelers with criminal_records , for example , could not enter the country legally , he said . Also , students are not eligible to have the visa requirement waived . &quot; The program has been very successful , &quot; Sheaffer said . &quot; We would like to make_it permanent. &quot; Indeed , the program has proven so popular that some members of Congress would like to see it expanded to include some countries , such_as Greece , Ireland , and Portugal , which do not meet the current criteria , Chiames said . * If the visa waiver program is not renewed , many international business_travelers would get bogged down in bureaucratic paperwork , he said . Because the program has dramatically reduced the number of visa applications for U.S. visits , many U.S. embassies and consulates have cut staff and no longer have the resources to process a surge in applications . In addition , if waivers are withdrawn , nations such_as France and Japan may withdraw the reciprocal privileges . It would throw everything into a state of confusion , said Chiames . &quot; We don ' t even want to think_about it. &quot; Visa-Free Entry Countries that have demonstrated that their citizens pose a low risk of illegal immigration to the United States and dates when they entered the visa waiver program : July , 1988 Britain December , 1988 Japan July , 1989 France , Switzerland , Germany , Sweden , Italy , the_Netherlands October , 1991 Andorra , Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Liechtenstein , Luxembourg , Monaco , New Zealand , Norway , San Marino , Spain July , 1993 Brunei Note : Canadians are covered by unrelated , more relaxed regulations .
