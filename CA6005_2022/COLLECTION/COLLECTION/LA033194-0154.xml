   <HEADLINE> DOW FALLS 72 POINTS AMID MARKET FEARS ; STOCKS : THE SEVENTH DROP IN EIGHT DAYS PUTS AVERAGE FAR BELOW WHERE IT STOOD TWO WEEKS AGO . INVESTORS ARE WORRIED BY INTEREST_RATES AND POLITICAL TURMOIL , ANALYSTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stock prices tumbled Wednesday in the biggest one-day selloff in eight weeks , raising new fears that Wall_Street ' s bull_market has ended and that more sharp declines are ahead . The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 72.27 points to 3 # 626.75 , its seventh decline in eight days , bringing its loss since March 18 to nearly 300 points . In a dramatic reversal of the optimism that drove stocks to record highs in January , analysts say investors have become deeply troubled by rising interest_rates , the White_House ' s spreading political problems and a growing number of foreign crises . Moreover , the stock_market ' s long upward march since October , 1990 -- when the Dow bottomed at 2 # 365 -- has been so unblemished by significant declines that the severity of this one has taken professional and novice investors by surprise . &quot; We ' re in a highly volatile and vulnerable environment , &quot; warned Alan Ackerman , investment strategist at brokerage Reich &amp; Co . in New York . The cascading selling of recent days , he said , reflects investors ' mounting fears that &quot; he who hesitates is lost &quot; in a plummeting market . Trading volume surged to nearly 400 million shares on the New York Stock_Exchange on Wednesday , and 20 stocks fell_in price for every four that rose , a lopsided count rarely seen except in bear_markets and in crisis-induced panics . In the bond market , where surging interest_rates have been the stock_market ' s chief worry this year , long-term Treasury_bond yields reached 7.1 % , up from 6.35 % at year-end and the highest level since February , 1993 . For the average investor , financial markets ' stunning selloffs over the past two months have been difficult to reconcile with the extraordinarily good economic news . For the first time since the late 1980s , the economy appears to be in a sustained recovery . Companies are hiring again and corporate earnings are rising at a healthy pace . Despite the economy ' s improving tone , however , there have been relatively few signs of higher inflation -- the troubling upward push in prices of goods and services that has historically accompanied strong recoveries . In an attempt to keep the economy ' s growth moderate and inflation at_bay , the Federal_Reserve_Board has twice raised short-term interest_rates by a quarter-point this year , once on Feb . 4 and again on March 23 . Although Wall_Street pros had believed that most investors were prepared_for the Fed rate hikes , the central_bank ' s moves now are being widely blamed for frightening investors and sparking the stock and bond markets ' accelerating declines . The Fed ' s Feb . 4 rate increase triggered a 96-point drop_in the Dow that day . Many analysts say the problem is simply that investors had grown used to declining interest_rates over the past three years and that the reversal of that long slide has had a worse-than-expected psychological effect on investors . &quot; The watershed was that the Fed put its stamp of approval on the fact that interest_rates were going_up again , &quot; said Alfred Kugel , investment strategist at Stein Roe &amp; Farnham in Chicago . Other analysts , however , say the markets are responding not so_much to the small rise in short-term interest_rates as_to the growing uncertainty about the Clinton_Administration ' s Whitewater affair and to a sudden burst of turmoil overseas : the assassination of Mexico ' s probable future president , North_Korea ' s intransigence over the nuclear issue and the U.S.-Japan trade conflict . When the world economy ' s prospects look promising and political issues are few , investors are willing to pay relatively high prices for stocks , experts note . But as uncertainty about the future increases , investors naturally lower the prices they are willing to pay_for stocks -- and may begin trimming what they own . &quot; I believe the markets are just factoring_in some political risk again , around the world , &quot; Reich &amp; Co. ' s Ackerman said . Stock_markets have declined sharply in many countries this year , not just in the United States . Whereas the Dow industrial average now has slumped 8.8 % from its all-time high , British stocks are down 9.5 % this year ; in Thailand , the average stock is down 26 % year-to-date . What is unclear is how much further stock prices will slide before buyers are willing to return in droves . Because the New York Stock_Exchange imposed so-called circuit_breakers on the market after the 1987 crash , when the Dow plunged 508 points in one day , analysts believe that a crash of that type is unlikely . For example , when the Dow loses 50 points in one session , the NYSE automatically restricts some big investors ' ability to trade stocks via high-speed computers . The effect of that circuit_breaker has been to limit market volatility . But critics say that by artificially restraining selling , the NYSE guarantees that any market decline now will be stretched over a long period , gradually drawing_out more sellers as investors see the market edge painfully lower day after day . On Wall_Street , some analysts who have long been predicting a classic market &quot; correction &quot; -- a fast 10 % to 15 % pullback in prices , then a resumption of the bull_market -- now believe that U.S. stocks are vulnerable to a plunge of 20 % or more from their highs . A drop of that magnitude would officially qualify as a bear_market and could drag_on for many months , if history is a guide . In the last bear_market , the Dow slumped from 3 # 000 to 2 # 365 between July and October of 1990 . The 1973-74 bear_market , one of the worst ever , lasted two years and cut 45 % from the Dow . &quot; I ' m 99 % sure ( this is ) a bear_market , not a normal correction , &quot; said Stan Weinstein , a veteran market_analyst who writes a newsletter called the Professional Tape Reader in Hollywood , Fla . Weinstein and others who expect heavier selling in part cite the market ' s lack of meaningful declines over the past three years . Stocks ' 42-month climb has pulled_in millions of new investors , many of whom may now feel compelled to sell some or all_of their holdings as they see Wall_Street sentiment turning bearish , some pros fear . Also , the higher short-term interest_rates engineered by the Fed will provide new competition for stocks in the form of higher yields on safe bank CDs , analysts note . So far , stock and bond mutual_funds -- the investment of choice for 38 million Americans -- report relatively little selling by their clients . Still , the fund companies acknowledge that , as foreign stock funds have plunged in price this year , investors have begun to take money away from those funds , though in small amounts . The worry now is that investors also will begin to pull money out of U.S. stock funds as their prices erode and people fear bigger losses ahead . &quot; The big question is , will we see panic selling by less sophisticated investors who have been told that mutual_funds go_up 10 % a year ? &quot; said Arnold Kaufman , editor of Standard &amp; Poor ' s Outlook investment newsletter . He also noted that , because so many_more Americans own stocks today than did five years ago , a bear_market today could eventually depress the economy by leaving many investors feeling poorer as their investments lose value . But some money managers argue that the bear scenario is vastly overstated . Robert Rodriguez , manager of the FPA Capital_stock fund in West Los Angeles , said he was buying stocks Wednesday as the market dove . &quot; I think this is just a hiccup , &quot; Rodriguez said . Taking a longer-term view , he expects interest_rates to settle_down soon and the economy and corporate profits to continue growing , bringing investors back to stocks . Even at higher yields of perhaps 4 % , short-term CDs will provide little incentive for many investors to run wholesale back to banks , he said . Noting that many blue-chip_stocks have already plunged more_than 15 % this year , Rodriguez said , &quot; If you wait for ' the market ' to bottom , a lot of the stocks you want to buy will have already bottomed &quot; and begun moving_up again . Sheldon Jacobs , editor of the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter in Irvington-on-Hudson , N.Y. , said he is reminding worried clients to think_about why they bought stocks in the first place . If they are long-term investors , he said , they should realize that bear_markets come and go , but that stocks inevitably move higher in the long_run if the economy continues to grow . &quot; There ' s only one sure way to lose money in the stock_market , and that ' s to buy high and sell low , &quot; Jacobs said . * RELATED STORY : D1</TEXT>
