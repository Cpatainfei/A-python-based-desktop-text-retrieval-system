   <HEADLINE> IS AN EMMY WORTH A 51-YEAR WAIT ? ASK FYVUSH FINKEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fyvush Finkel says he never would have changed his name -- even if he had been asked . Nor would he have altered his nose , which distinguishes a face that can call_up a rainbow of emotions with the speed of a photographer ' s flash . And when he won the Emmy Award last week as best supporting actor in a dramatic series for his portrayal of Douglas Wambaugh , the crafty but good-hearted lawyer on CBS ' &quot; Picket_Fences , &quot; Finkel stood his ground . &quot; I don ' t care how much time they gave me , &quot; he said of the 30-second limit imposed on winners for their acceptance speeches , gloriously shaking his award off the Richter scale . &quot; I waited 51 years to get_on this stage ! &quot; Over lunch this week at the commissary at Fox -- the studio where &quot; Picket_Fences &quot; is filmed -- Finkel , who turns 72 next month , was still exulting , invariably punctuating sentences with deep , melodic laughs as he told jokes or when the_likes_of Mel Brooks stopped at his table . &quot; I waited a long_time for recognition , &quot; explained the actor , a great-grandfather , in the company of his wife Trudy , to whom he ' s been married for 47 1 / 2 years . His wait exceeds the longevity of the 46-year-old Emmys . A son of East European immigrants , Finkel has been in show_business since age 9 , starting_out in Yiddish theater around the corner from his house in Brooklyn , when a boy soprano was needed . That , of course , was years before TV . After graduation from high_school , where he learned a furrier ' s trade , he went_on the Yiddish theater circuit . &quot; I stayed in the Yiddish theater till I was 43 years old . When I left it , I was a star. &quot; He was not the romantic lead -- &quot; I never got the girl , &quot; he explained . At 6-foot-3 , he was supposed to play villains , but Finkel insisted on the role of a comedian , who came_on stage wearing white socks , the comic ' s trademark , which itself provoked laughter . He segued to American theater with &quot; Fiddler on the Roof. &quot; A baritone , Finkel was in the road company for more_than 12 years , graduating from the role of the innkeeper at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 1966 ( a role he reprised on Broadway in 1970 ) to the butcher , to Tevye . He played the owner of the &quot; Little Shop of Horrors &quot; Off-Broadway for five years in the 1980s , and starred in both Off-Broadway and Broadway productions of &quot; Cafe Crown , &quot; a revival about Yiddish theater . Finkel won an Obie in 1989 . Movie credits include &quot; Brighton Beach Memoirs &quot; and &quot; Seize the Day. &quot; He also did commercials , played the Florida condo and Catskills circuits , occasionally appeared on a soap . &quot; It ' s the biggest miracle in the world , getting a TV series at my age , &quot; said Finkel , who allows that he ' s &quot; shrunk an inch &quot; with age . &quot; It ' s happened for other actors but I ' m talking_of myself -- that ' s the point. &quot; And he did_it without an audition , which for Finkel has special meaning . &quot; Picket_Fences &quot; executive producer David Kelley rented the 1990 movie &quot; Q &amp; A , &quot; in which Finkel had a brief cameo as a lawyer defending a gangster . &quot; I just took one look_at him and knew that was Wambaugh , &quot; said Kelley , taking a phone break from his writing . &quot; I was looking_for a character , a real character , that I could give legitimate , serious debate to , and yet , you could get a sense of comedy from him at_the_same_time . &quot; Wambaugh was written as probably a grittier and tougher character , maybe a less redeeming character , &quot; Kelley says , &quot; and then , when we melded it with Fyvush , we had to adjust it . Fyvush ' s own personality pervaded the character of Wambaugh , a person who really loves life . We had contemplated this as a man who really had a lot of scar tissue and maybe was angry at the world . Well , that ' s not Fyvush. &quot; * Not now anyway . But there was a time , long before &quot; Fiddler , &quot; when Finkel yearned for Broadway . In 1952 , he tried_out for a role in Cole Porter ' s &quot; Can-Can &quot; and , after a call-back audition , was told Porter wanted to see him . &quot; So you ' d think it was in the bag . He said , ' Mr. Finkel ' -- I ' ll never forget it -- ' you ' re a great artist . I go_to see the Yiddish theater sometimes , because that ' s where I get my ideas for my music ' -- because most of his music is in a minor key . ' And you are so wonderful , but unfortunately I can ' t seem to find a part ( for you ) . ' &quot; I turned white and green and blue , &quot; Finkel said . &quot; I couldn ' t eat for a week . I said , ' To hell with them ! I ' m not going_to audition anymore. ' Then in 1965 , I had to audition for ' Fiddler. ' &quot; He laughed . &quot; When an actor makes a statement , that doesn ' t mean he ' s going_to stick_to it. &quot; Finkel had been up for the Emmy last year ; it went_to Chad Lowe of ABC ' s &quot; Life Goes On. &quot; &quot; Inwardly I was ( disappointed ) but the smile remained , &quot; he recalls . &quot; What are you going_to do ? Ninety percent of the critics said I would get_it . This time , we came_to the ceremony &quot; -- he had started to say &quot; service &quot; -- &quot; and we decided ( that ) no matter what happens , we ' re going to enjoy ourselves . To be nominated is an honor but winning is an even bigger honor. &quot; Ironically , the episode that helped Finkel win the Emmy resulted from some complaints that his lawyer character played into an anti-Semitic stereotype of an ambulance_chaser . So by way of an answer , Kelley wrote an episode in which the rabbi of Wambaugh ' s temple wanted to revoke his membership , claiming Wambaugh was an embarrassment to Judaism . The show pointed_out that while Wambaugh may be a &quot; hustler &quot; -- distributing cards that say &quot; reasonable doubt for a reasonable fee &quot; -- he is a good Jew and a good man , who defends some who can ' t afford to pay . &quot; Wambaugh is an intellect , &quot; Finkel said , savoring the word . &quot; He knows the law . He might be eccentric , but only in the courtroom . At home he ' s a good father , a good husband , but when he enters that courtroom he ' s a madman sometimes . He twists_around the judge , the D.A. , his own witness sometimes . You can ' t fool him. &quot; As for the actor , he says he ' s &quot; getting the offers you never even dreamed before . Movies , guest shots on other shows , commercials . All in one week they came . . . . &quot; &quot; Do you know Mr. Mel Brooks ? &quot; Finkel asked his interviewer as the director approached to offer congratulations on the Emmy . &quot; Did you see his revue ' Finkel ' s Follies ' ( at the Westwood Playhouse in 1990 ) ? &quot; Brooks asked . &quot; My wife ( Anne Bancroft ) and I went backstage ; it was sensational. &quot; &quot; There was no pretense about it , &quot; Finkel said . He could say the same of himself . * &quot; Picket_Fences &quot; begins its third season at 10 tonight on CBS ( Channels 2 and 8 ) .</TEXT>
