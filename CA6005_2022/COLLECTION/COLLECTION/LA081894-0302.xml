   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA SERBS DEMAND FUEL AS PEACEKEEPERS ' TOLL ; BALKANS : A LETTER FROM THE SQUEEZED REBELS WARNS THAT TO PASS CHECKPOINTS WILL REQUIRE SUPPLYING GASOLINE . THE U.N. MISSION SAYS IT WON ' T COMPLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hampered by a blockade imposed by their allies in the rump Yugoslavia , Bosnian Serb forces Wednesday turned_to the U.N. Protection Force with a demand for fuel to run their sputtering war machine . A letter delivered from Bosnian Serb headquarters in nearby Pale to the U.N. command center here put peacekeepers on notice that they would be barred from traveling through Bosnian Serb-held territory unless they supplied rebels with gasoline at each armed checkpoint , said U.N. spokesman Maj . Rob Annink . &quot; This is blackmail , and we will not comply , &quot; Annink said of the demand issued by the increasingly isolated , desperate regime of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic . The rebel threat to block all U.N. movements through Bosnian Serb-held territory that surrounds most peacekeeping bases could grind the U.N. mission to a halt , preventing the 20 # 000 foreign troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina from carrying_out their tasks of escorting humanitarian aid to civilian war victims and providing a modicum of protection to besieged U.N. &quot; safe havens. &quot; Bosnian Serbs loyal to Karadzic have been feeling the pinch of a fuel shortage since their supply_line was shut_down two weeks ago by their longtime patrons in the Serbian capital , Belgrade , who have been angered by the rebels ' rejection of an international peace plan . Bosnian Serbs grow enough food and get sufficient humanitarian aid to feed themselves . But they have been dependent_on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for spare_parts and fuel to run the tanks , armored vehicles and other war machinery that he and his regime inherited from the former Yugoslav National Army and passed_on . Milosevic , chief architect of the Balkan conflict , appears to have cut_off his Bosnian proxies to pressure them into signing the peace plan , as well as_to undermine Karadzic , who has become an unreliable surrogate , as Bosnian Serbs increasingly assert their independence . But Karadzic , backed by ardent nationalists committed to Milosevic ' s original goal of uniting all Balkan Serbs in an expanded Greater Serbia , has refused to give_up any of the seized territory in exchange for peace . U.N. officials concede that the rebels have been violating U.N.-proclaimed weapons exclusion zones around Sarajevo and the eastern Bosnian Muslim enclave of Gorazde with impunity , and even an anti-sniping accord concluded last weekend has been largely ignored . &quot; I do not deny that sniping has continued , &quot; Annink said of the hail of bullets that peppered a high-rise apartment_building and the Holiday Inn hotel on the government side of the front_line Tuesday evening . Following standard U.N. policy of emphasizing positives in a mission gone badly wrong , Annink noted that the number of cease-fire violations in this battered capital had &quot; dropped dramatically &quot; to 460 Tuesday from the previous day ' s 684 . The catch-all term of cease-fire violation now encompasses an array of actions ranging from hijacking heavy_weapons from U.N. impoundment sites to firing rocket-propelled grenades with more destructive power than some of the artillery shells banned by a North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ultimatum in February . Rather than knuckling_under to pressure from Belgrade to sign the peace plan , the rebels have become emboldened by the U.N. mission ' s hesitant response to their belligerence -- culminating in the fuel extortion attempt , which effectively holds hostage the entire U.N. peacekeeping force here . While U.N. officials insisted the mission had no intention of complying , they replied by reiterating their frequent threat : &quot; The code word for our mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina is freedom of movement . If they deny us this , they are saying , ' We don ' t need you , we don ' t want you here , ' &quot; Annink said of the Serbs ' demand for gasoline . &quot; If they do this , we will have to reconsider our mission. &quot; France and Britain , which contribute the largest peacekeeping contingents in Bosnia , have announced that they will withdraw their forces if the United States follows_through on plans to exempt the Muslim-led Bosnian government from a U.N. arms embargo imposed on all_of the former Yugoslav federation in 1991 . Both European powers fear that their peacekeepers would become targets of retaliation by the Bosnian Serbs , who would see the lifting of the arms embargo currently shackling their enemies as a form of Western intervention against them . President Clinton warned last week that he will push to get the embargo lifted after Oct . 15 if the Bosnian Serbs still have not agreed to the peace plan drafted by diplomats from the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany . The Karadzic leadership has already rejected the proposal three times and plans to put it to a popular vote on Aug . 27 and 28 . Meantime , the Vatican on Wednesday set Sept . 8 as the provisional date for a one-day visit to Sarajevo by Pope John Paul II , the Reuters news_agency reported .</TEXT>
