   <HEADLINE> CHANGING LIFESTYLES ; SPRING BRINGS LITTLE HOPE TO BLOCKADED ARMENIANS ; CAUGHT BETWEEN THE 20TH CENTURY AND THE MIDDLE_AGES , THEY FEED SOFAS AND DESKS TO THEIR WOOD-BURNING STOVES . STILL , THEY CLING TO GRIM HUMOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four-year-old Maysik Shakhbazian was lying_in bed with his grandmother one night and looking_up at the bright full_moon . As usual , there was no heat or light in the Yerevan apartment where he lives . &quot; See how pretty the moon is , &quot; his grandmother said . Suddenly , Maysik had an inspiration . &quot; Grandmother , &quot; he asked , &quot; isn ' t there some way we could lay an electricity line to it ? &quot; Maysik was not just fantasizing . He was imitating his elders , his young head already at_work on how to ease his family ' s daily grind in a heatless , dim-lit , penny-poor world . As Armenia has come_through its third winter of misery into a tentative spring , inhabitants of the former Soviet republic seem to have reconciled themselves to the depressing prospect that more privations are all that awaits them . There is no end in_sight to the war in Nagorno-Karabakh , the small Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan , nor to the hostility between Armenia and Azerbaijan . That means there will be no lifting of the Azerbaijani blockade aimed at bringing Armenia ' s economy to its knees , particularly its energy sector . Turkey , Azerbaijan ' s ally , lets virtually no supplies through and Armenia ' s other neighbor , Georgia , is so anarchic that supply_routes there are chancy at best . * Many Yerevan residents who hoped initially that life would soon return to normal now believe that they will spend the next several winters without heat and light . Instead of looking_forward to the end of this tunnel , they focus_on coping , refining the art of survival in a world caught somewhere between the 20th Century and the Middle_Ages . Maysik knew about electricity lines , for example , because of the widespread practice in Yerevan of stringing a line &quot; on the left &quot; between neighboring apartment_houses . When the power_company gives one apartment block its hour or two of electricity per day , friends in a neighboring house can siphon_off some of the juice for themselves through a pirate line . Government workers come_around tearing_down the illegal lines periodically , but they soon sprout again . Although they live_in central Yerevan , a city of about 1 million residents , the Shakhbazians also have a wood-burning stove that has already turned their creamy new wallpaper a dingy gray . And they have a gasoline-powered generator that allows them to keep one light and a television -- a small one , the big one takes too_much power -- running in the evenings . Their neighbor , Lilia Azatian , 52 , is not so lucky . She comes_by once or twice a week to escape reality by watching American soap_operas on the Shakhbazians ' little television because she has no generator and no illegal line at_home . A doctor who has done administrative work for the last two decades , Azatian heated her home this winter mainly by burning unneeded documents from work . She and her two grown children , a 22-year-old daughter and 24-year-old son , all slept_in the same big bed for warmth . Her ailing mother also slept_in the same room , near the stove . &quot; We don ' t manage , we just exist , &quot; Azatian said . The Armenian government , adjusting to its chronic energy crisis , managed to prepare special fuel supplies this winter for hospitals , bakeries , communications centers and other strategic facilities . It also hopes to restart Armenia ' s nuclear_power plant within the next year . It was shut_down in 1989 for safety concerns . But for now , most individuals are_on their own . &quot; My salary is enough for one pound of cheese , &quot; Azatian calculated . &quot; I ' ve hoarded everything from the past -- oil , soap , toilet_paper , napkins -- and the consignment store helps . I ' ve sold crystal glasses and some plates , &quot; as well as some of her clothing . This winter , the Azatians chopped_up and burned a desk and a chest . Last winter , they fed a sofa to the wood stove . &quot; Now I ' m gathering paper again for next year , &quot; Azatian said . &quot; The situation probably won ' t change. &quot; * According to a report by the Atlanta-based Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention , Armenian households were caught even less prepared for winter this year than last . The median amount of food stores was 30 % lower compared to the year before , although very little serious malnutrition has shown_up . &quot; The most important coping method among households during last winter was sharing available resources with relatives , friends and neighbors , &quot; the report said . But this winter , it said , resources were so tight there was far less to share . The average stores of food , it found , were about 15 pounds of flour per household , less than half what they were in the winter of 1992-1993 . Subsidized bread is rationed at about half a loaf daily per person -- although more is available at market_price . The shortages of everything have spawned a Yerevan joke that if a guest comes_to your home uninvited , he ' s considered a racketeer ; if you ' ve offered an invitation , it ' s considered humanitarian aid . Humanitarian groups provide some fuel and food , with millions of dollars worth of kerosene funded by the U.S._government and the United Armenia Fund , but families like Azatian ' s do not qualify for much of it -- she is considered well-off compared to elderly people without families and single mothers of young children . Gift packages from relatives abroad help a bit . In contrast to the Soviet period , the greatest shortage of all is money -- the new Armenian currency known as the dram , exchanged at about 200 to the dollar . Maysik ' s mother is still on extended maternity leave after giving_birth to his younger sister and is expected to make ends meet on a government maternity payment of 100 drams -- 50 cents -- a month . &quot; Here ' s a_hundred drams -- that ' s what my mother gets for her monthly pension , &quot; said Samvel Hovannisian , a cousin visiting the Shakhbazians . &quot; A pack of cigarettes costs more_than that. &quot; But his mother gets_by , Hovannisian said , because he supports her with his business earnings . And that , said Maysik ' s grandfather , Martin , is how it is done : &quot; You either do business or sell what ' s at home. &quot; One family of the Shakhbazians ' acquaintance is doing business on just $ 100 -- they lend the money out repeatedly and live_on the interest . Others try to import candy_bars or cigarettes or whatever they can , but the market is weak -- the CDC said 94 % of the population is considered below the international poverty_line . Still -- the Shakhbazians say , sighing -- they do have each other . &quot; We just get_together and talk and that ' s our main happiness , &quot; Azatian said . No one goes_to the theater anymore , or the movies or restaurants -- but they still have the entertainment they make_for themselves , even if it is only sitting around discussing their misery . And an unsinkable sense_of_humor -- with jokes stemming even from the cold darkness of their lives . Winters have become so miserable , Maysik ' s grandfather , Martin , said , that they have spawned a new saying : &quot; You count your chicks in the fall , to see which have survived , and you count Armenians in the spring. &quot;</TEXT>
