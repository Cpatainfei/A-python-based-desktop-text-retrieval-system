   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : HARBOR AREA ; EPA PLAN FOR PORT USER FEES CHALLENGED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ports of Los Angeles and Long_Beach are challenging an Environmental Protection Agency proposal to impose fees on vessels that pollute the air as they enter Southern California waters . In efforts to meet the federal Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 , the EPA has suggested charging ship operators up_to $ 10 # 000 per ton of nitrogen_dioxide emitted , starting from a distance of 100 miles from port.A three-tiered fee system for marine vessels , effective beginning in 2001 , would be enforced only in the ports of Los Angeles and Long_Beach . Barbara Dykman , an environmental scientist with the Los Angeles Harbor Department , said the port supports reduced air emissions in the South Coast Air Basin , which has the worst ozone pollution in the country . But , she said , the department believes that the EPA Federal Implementation Plan , which also aims to regulate locomotive and truck emissions , will affect cargo transport throughout the basin , hurting jobs and the local economy . Dykman calculated that a modern container_ship entering one of the ports for a 36-hour stay would face a fee of more_than $ 100 # 000 . Burdened with the costs of retrofitting their vessels to meet new standards , she said , many shipping lines will simply divert their cargo to a port without the fee . Representatives from the two harbor departments are meeting to devise alternatives to be submitted to the EPA by an Aug . 31 public comment deadline .</TEXT>
