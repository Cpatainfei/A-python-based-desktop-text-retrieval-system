   <HEADLINE> GERMANY ' S SCREEN DATE WITH ITS PAST ; MOVIES : PRE-RELEASE COMMENT ON ' SCHINDLER ' S LIST ' HAS BEEN POSITIVE . SOME HOPE THE FILM WILL BE AN ' EYE-OPENER ' FOR GERMAN YOUTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Germany ' s President Richard von Weizsaecker has an important date at the movies . Tonight in Frankfurt , he will meet Steven Spielberg at the invitation-only premiere of the director ' s Oscar-nominated Holocaust drama , &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; The movie , opening in Germany on Thursday , already has generated tremendous pre-release buzz with an outpouring of media attention and overwhelmingly positive reviews . Against a real-life backdrop of resurgent neo-Nazism throughout Germany , Von Weizsaecker ' s presence at the benefit screening -- which will raise money for the preservation of Auschwitz as a memorial -- is meant to send a resounding message to the German people to take a hard look_at their dark history . A Von Weizsaecker aide said the president &quot; wants his presence to signal to others that this ( movie ) is really more_than just a product . . . . It engages the public to work_on our own past . This is another opportunity for Germans to be confronted with our own history and the history of Europe , and , starting from that point , to try to face the present task , which you can only do if you really know the past. &quot; Von Weizsaecker has been forthright in condemning the rising neo-Nazi activities while , conversely , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been criticized at times both in Germany and abroad for not taking a harder line against neo-Nazi attacks . &quot; Schindler ' s List ' s &quot; overseas distributor , the London-based United International Pictures , says that initial market research indicates a high percentage of the German public is ready to see a film that confronts the horrors of their country ' s past . Hy Smith , UIP ' s senior_vice_president of international marketing , says research shows 41 % of the moviegoing population in Germany is aware of &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and 34 % have a &quot; definite interest &quot; in seeing the picture . Smith claims the results are &quot; impressive , &quot; relative to the German movie market , especially since they predated any television or print advertising , which only began late last week . Given the film ' s success in the United States , UIP has decided to release the movie on more screens in Germany than originally planned . It will open in key cities with approximately 35 prints ; within a week it will expand to around 200 theaters , a major release for an &quot; up market &quot; film of this kind in Germany . Famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal told The Times from Vienna that he is optimistic about the potential impact that &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; will have_on German viewers . The film ' s opening in Germany , he said , &quot; is very , very important in this time of so many neo-Nazi events , with so many rightist extremists , and in a year of elections. &quot; He said he expects the movie to raise the public consciousness -- especially among young people -- and translate into fewer votes for extreme right-wing parties . Wiesenthal called &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; the &quot; best film about our tragedy that I have seen , and I ' ve seen 99 % of them. &quot; Irene Runge , a sociologist and leader of the Jewish Cultural Assn . in Berlin , said she hopes the movie will be &quot; an eye-opener for a generation of youths &quot; who may be unexposed to the subject . But she also fears many intellectuals accustomed to repressing the issue might focus_on discussions of &quot; aesthetic values -- talk_about how well the movie was done or not done , according to their standards , &quot; and not on Nazism and its victims . The presence of &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; has been making itself felt even before the film ' s opening . Last week , the German magazine Der Spiegel ran a cover story on the film titled &quot; The Good German , &quot; which said Spielberg &quot; tells his story as precisely and brilliantly as never before , vividly in every detail , so full_of_life and , therefore , so intensely , so densely , that it takes the viewer ' s breath away. &quot; &quot; There has been an astonishing outpouring of attention on this film , &quot; says Gerry Lewis , international marketing consultant for Spielberg ' s Los Angeles-based production company , Amblin Entertainment , from UIP ' s London headquarters . He said the momentum of media coverage &quot; has grown immensely over the last four or five weeks. &quot; Lewis and Smith , who work closely on all_of UIP ' s releases of Amblin films overseas , characterized the marketing campaign for the movie as very straightforward , mirroring the look and strategy Universal Pictures enlisted to sell the picture domestically . The campaign was low-key and no frills , positioning it as an important &quot; experience &quot; rather than just a movie . * Based on the true story of German industrialist and Nazi_Party member Oskar Schindler who secretly saved more_than 1 # 100 Jews from the death camps , &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; is the first major movie specifically confronting the subject in Germany since the 1979 U.S. television miniseries &quot; Holocaust , &quot; which drew 20 million viewers despite being aired on WDR network ' s third-rated channel . That brought the word Holocaust into the German vocabulary , replacing &quot; The Final Solution &quot; or the still-preferred term &quot; persecution of Jews. &quot; As Der Spiegel points_out , even though the president is attending tonight ' s premiere , the German government hasn ' t always been so willing to address the subject of the Holocaust . In 1956 , the government of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer exercised considerable pressure to block the showing of Alain Resnais ' &quot; Night and Fog &quot; at the Cannes Film Festival because it saw the film as an offense against Germany . One of the people behind tonight ' s premiere is 37-year-old lawyer Michael Friedman , whose Holocaust survivor parents , Paul and Eugenia , were saved by Schindler . Friedman , who said Schindler attended his bar_mitzvah in Tel Aviv , said the president ' s presence at the movie ' s premiere is a &quot; sign of recognition of what Spielberg did_in this film. &quot; Like other countries where the movie has begun to open , Germany is rolling_out the red_carpet for Spielberg . He arrives in Frankfurt just before lunchtime today after a meeting this morning in Paris with French President Francois Mitterrand . Later today , Spielberg will be honored at a lunch at Frankfurt ' s City_Hall . On Wednesday , he will fly to the film ' s premiere in Krakow , Poland , where Oskar Schindler established his work_camp that saved Jewish workers from the Auschwitz death camp . Poland ' s President Lech Walesa is expected to attend . Tonight ' s premiere benefit in Frankfurt was arranged by a committee of an organization known as Wider Das Vergessen , which roughly translates as &quot; against forgetting. &quot; The organization is made_up of leading German industrialists who raise money for the preservation of Auschwitz as a memorial . &quot; The museum at Auschwitz is in bad shape and needs approximately $ 30 million ( of restoration ) . The German government is giving 10 million marks ( $ 7 million ) toward it , and the rest has to be worked_out worldwide , &quot; said Amblin ' s Lewis . * Eller , the Times ' movie editor , wrote from Los Angeles ; Miller reported from Germany .</TEXT>
