   <HEADLINE> NASA KEEPS SHUTTLE ON SCHEDULE , WATCHES TROUBLED FUEL_LINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NASA said Sunday that it does not intend to cut_short the space shuttle Columbia ' s 14-day mission -- at least not yet , despite trouble with a fuel_line connected to a crucial auxiliary power_unit . &quot; What it boils_down to at this point is that there ' s still some uncertainty , &quot; Mission Control ' s Gregory Harbaugh told the space shuttle crew. &quot; There is no discussion at this point about any kind of early mission termination. &quot; For the third day in a row , engineers studied unusually high_pressure readings from the fuel_line . Their best guess was that the line was blocked with ice or some kind of contaminant . Lee Briscoe , mission operations director , said the analysis will continue until engineers understand what is causing the readings , which were detected a_few hours into the flight Friday . The pressure in the line dropped to normal after the crew switched to backup heaters Saturday , he said . The shuttle ' s three auxiliary power_units supply power to hydraulic_systems vital for launch and landing . NASA flight rules require three working auxiliary power_units , although a shuttle could land safely with one . If a unit failed in orbit , a shuttle would have to return to Earth as soon as possible . Columbia ' s crew spent Sunday building Erector Set-like structures . The thin rods , once snapped together in the form of an oblong tower or space_station truss , were shaken to see how they would hold_up in weightlessness . Researchers say the findings will help them build stronger space_platforms . Mission Control surprised the astronauts with a short video of Friday ' s liftoff that was sent to their laptop_computer as part of a high-speed communications test .</TEXT>
