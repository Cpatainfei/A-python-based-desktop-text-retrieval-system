   <HEADLINE> BUILDING SURVEY WIDENS SCOPE OF DAMAGE AREA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While the tally of earthquake destruction mounted , officials on Thursday released preliminary reports showing that thousands of residences were left uninhabitable and the scope of major damage had spread far beyond the Northridge epicenter to South-Central Los Angeles , Santa Monica and Simi Valley . Nearly two-thirds of the unsafe buildings in Los Angeles were homes , and the rest of the damage was spread among an array of structures , from churches and schools to auto repair_shops and nightclubs , according to a report by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety . No type of building seemed to be spared . Brick apartments constructed in the 1920s on Hollywood Boulevard were battered . So was a 10-year-old Ventura Boulevard high-rise . The report , based on inspections of only 1 # 239 buildings , found that 526 residential and commercial buildings in Los Angeles are uninhabitable and that damage totaled $ 213 million . Nearly 2 # 500 housing units were declared unsafe for occupancy . Officials said the numbers will surely grow because they had tallied only the first third of more_than 3 # 500 inspection reports and were continuing to assess damage across the city . &quot; We are finding much more damage then we thought there was , &quot; said city building and safety official Karl Deppe , from his office Downtown . &quot; We just didn ' t think there would be this much damage on this side of the mountain. &quot; * The widespread and capricious nature of the destruction was coming_into sharper focus in reports from a variety of communities . Inspectors in Santa Monica found that more_than half of the 800 buildings they checked had to be vacated at least temporarily , while officials in nearby Malibu inspected just eight buildings and declared all &quot; safe and sound. &quot; The Los Angeles city survey broke the uninhabitable buildings into two categories . Nearly 300 were marked with yellow tags , meaning owners and tenants were allowed to re-enter to retrieve possessions . Another 228 structures were marked with red tags indicating that they were too dangerous for even brief visits . Wood-frame structures accounted_for more_than half of those declared unsafe , according to a review by Richard O ' Reilly , Times director of computer analysis , and analyst Sandra Poindexter . But no type of structure appeared to be immune from problems , including the most modern concrete-and-steel buildings , which accounted_for 7 % of the buildings declared unsafe . Apartments and single-family dwellings of all types of construction represented 63 % of the unsafe buildings in the initial survey . Restaurants and retail_stores accounted_for 15 % . Warehouses , parking garages and offices each accounted_for roughly 5 % . Los Angeles officials said the initial assessment provided a measure of good news -- indications that a 13-year-old program to strengthen masonry buildings is successful . Of the 8 # 100 unreinforced masonry buildings in which the city ordered improvements in 1981 , all but about 400 have been retrofitted . The work usually consists_of attaching floors to foundations and ceilings to outer walls . Officials said the attachments are designed merely to save lives , not to to prevent damage , by preventing floors from pancaking on top of each other . Of the 89 brick buildings initially inspected by the city , the survey showed that 54 were ordered vacated by building officials -- a high ratio . But retrofitting prevented the buildings from collapsing and causing deaths , officials said . &quot; I don ' t know of any that collapsed in the entire city . It worked , &quot; said Deppe , assistant chief of the Building and Safety Department ' s emergency operations . &quot; My feeling is that we could have lost quite a_few people . ( The retrofitting ) saved a lot of lives. &quot; A second wave of more detailed surveys will be required for inspectors to determine which buildings must be demolished and which can be repaired . The required improvements will range from buttressing with steel beams to the reinstallation of staircases to provide safe exits . Officials said the first round of statistics came mostly from inspections in the San Fernando Valley and from the most obviously damaged structures in the rest of the city . With residents and business people still flooding hot_lines with requests for inspections , the officials hoped to beef_up their crew of 540 inspectors with another 100 today . * Many of those inspectors are expected to be sent to neighborhoods outside the San Fernando Valley , to areas where some City_Council members were complaining that their constituents are not receiving enough attention . Councilman Nate Holden said his mid-Los Angeles district suffered tremendous damage that is not reflected in the report , which shows that 22 structures have been vacated , out of about 70 inspected . He said that single-family dwellings , duplexes , apartment_buildings , churches and commercial structures were hit hard and that people are begging him to send more inspectors . &quot; There are a lot of problems in this area that people don ' t even begin to know about yet , &quot; Holden said . Councilwoman Rita Walters concurred . &quot; The extent of the problem is far greater in the Valley , but we do have serious problems in all_of South-Central , &quot; said Walters , whose district extends south from Downtown Los Angeles . &quot; It needs to be recognized this is a problem for the total city. &quot; The survey showed that Councilman Hal Bernson ' s district , which includes Northridge , had more buildings declared unsafe , 40 , than any other ward in the city . There were 32 in Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg ' s Hollywood-centered district . * Twenty buildings were declared unsafe in City Councilman John Ferraro ' s district , which extends from Hancock Park to North Hollywood , and 34 were declared unsafe in Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky ' s district , which extends from the Westside to the Valley . Goldberg said the damage in her district is much more severe than reflected by the building_department ' s report . Most buildings that were not vacated are nevertheless uninhabitable , she said , because of plumbing or electrical failures or fallen debris . &quot; These places may_not be in imminent danger of collapsing during another jolt , &quot; she said , &quot; but people have moved_out because they are unlivable. &quot; Said Rawn Nelson , president-elect of the Structural Engineers Assn . of California : &quot; It ' s not just one type of building that was damaged . They ' re finding damage in all types of buildings. &quot; But , he added , &quot; I ' ve seen less serious damage in buildings engineered and built per newer codes. &quot; As building inspectors in the Valley continued their assessments Thursday , new pockets of damage continued to emerge . Todd Brizi , a building inspector in the Valley , said he and a partner posted red &quot; do not enter &quot; stickers on an entire block of apartment_buildings . &quot; They had in excess of 300 units , &quot; Brizi said . &quot; that ' s 300 families . that ' s sad. &quot; In some areas , one apartment complex after another was devastated by what appeared to be common problems . In at least five buildings along Victory Boulevard near Reseda Boulevard , the front units appeared damaged , with sagging patios , weakened walls and cracks . But units behind the swimming_pools were decimated . The apartments were built above carports , and when the thin concrete stilts collapsed , so did the apartments . Many residents , even though they could not retrieve their belongings , said they were glad just to be alive . &quot; When the supports for the garage fell , everything went_over , &quot; said Rae Talenfeld , 77 , who lived_in a front unit on Victory Boulevard with her sisters Sara and Netta , ages 88 and 83 . &quot; The building just separated. &quot; On West Adams Boulevard , miles from the epicenter , more red tags could be seen every few blocks on buildings stretching from Fairfax Avenue to Crenshaw Boulevard . Among the churches declared unsafe were Messiah Baptist_Church and Southern Missionary Baptist_Church . &quot; We ' re going to tear it down and rebuild , &quot; said Pastor Joe Gates of Southern Missionary . &quot; It ' s a total loss. &quot; An apartment_building at Figueroa Street near Martin_Luther_King Jr . Boulevard also had been deemed uninhabitable . It was cracked along its walls and foundation . The residents had strung sheets from a fence to make a crude tent in the parking_lot . Underneath , a bed lay on the asphalt , and a mother fed her baby . &quot; That was all we had , &quot; said a 44-year-old woman , motioning to the two-story brick apartment . &quot; Maybe we should go_to a park. &quot; Hollywood Boulevard was hard hit , especially between Western and Normandie avenues . Along that stretch , about 15 sites were deemed unsafe . All were brick and two to four stories tall . Assessments of damage around the rest of the Southland were beginning to come_into sharper focus Thursday : * In Santa Monica , a little more_than half of the 800 buildings inspected were ordered vacated at least for the time being , with limited entry to some to permit recovery of possessions . &quot; The majority of the damaged buildings have had unreinforced masonry , and we ' ve had lots of problems with chimneys , &quot; said Fred Harris , a spokesman for Santa Monica ' s Emergency Operations Center . Building owners must initiate their own engineering reports and repairs before their buildings can be approved for habitation . * In Culver City , about 30 buildings were closed , almost all_of them unreinforced brick structures . * In Ventura County , 6 # 000 residences were reported damaged and 1 # 000 of those were homes declared at least temporarily unsafe . About 250 businesses were at least temporarily closed by moderate to extensive damage . Eighty percent of those were in the Simi Valley area . Three schools , including Simi Valley High_School , may_not be reopened . And the roof of the Thousand Oaks main library fell_in . * In the city of San Fernando , 22 % of the housing stock for 23 # 500 residents was deemed uninhabitable . The northeast Valley city reported 63 buildings destroyed and 835 damaged , a loss exceeding $ 31 million , officials said Thursday . The county_courthouse in the city may be closed for six months . * In Burbank , city officials had declared 16 buildings uninhabitable . They allowed residents of 21 buildings limited entry to obtain possessions . More_than half of the 1 # 000 requests for inspections had been completed by Thursday afternoon . * In Calabasas , inspectors declared 12 units uninhabitable after checking about 1 # 000 . * In Pasadena , 40 businesses were damaged and two apartment_buildings on Marengo Avenue were shut_down . Total damage was placed at $ 2 million . * In Redondo Beach , officials reported that the King Harbor Marina suffered about $ 4 million in damage . Buildings Declared Unsafe Los Angeles city officials have inspected more_than 3 # 500 buildings since Monday ' s earthquake . The results of more_than 1 # 200 inspections have been tabulated and they show that nearly two-thirds of the buildings declared unsafe are residential structures . 03 # 16 , 08 # 09 Type Number Percent Houses 58 22 % Apartment 86 33 % Duplex 7 3 % Condo 14 5 % School 1 0.4 % Church 1 0.4 % Manufacturing 3 1 % Office 17 7 % Retail_Store 36 14 % Restaurant 3 1 % Parking Garage 13 5 % Warehouse 13 5 % Other 4 3 % Source : City of Los Angeles -- Department of Building and Safety Compiled by : Richard O ' Reilly , Times director of computer analysis , and data analyst Sandra Poindexter Other Damage Estimates City or County : Agoura Hills Damage : None condemned Estimates : $ 150 # 000 City or County : Burbank Damage : 37 structures declared unsafe Estimates : NA City or County : Calabasas Damage : 12 residences declared unsafe Estimates : More_than $ 325 # 000 City or County : El Segundo Damage : None condemned Estimates : $ 100 # 000 City or County : Glendale Damage : 31 structures declared unsafe Estimates : $ 15 million City or County : Inglewood Damage : Broken windows , cleanup costs Estimates : $ 114 # 000 City or County : Manhattan Beach Damage : NA Estimates : $ 1.7 million City or County : Pasadena Damage : Several apartment complexes condemned Estimates : $ 2 million City or County : Pomona Damage : No major structural damage Estimates : $ 100 # 000 City or County : Redondo Beach Damage : Damage at King Harbor Marina Estimates : $ 4 million City or County : San Fernando Damage : 63 buildings destroyed ; 835 damaged Estimates : $ 31 million City or County : Ventura County Damage : 6 # 000 residences damaged , 1 # 000 uninhabitable , 250 businesses closed Estimates : NA Compiled by NONA YATES / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
