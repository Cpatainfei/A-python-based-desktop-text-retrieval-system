   <HEADLINE> SECRECY SURROUNDS SUIT FILED BY CIA SPY ; LAW : FEMALE AGENT ALLEGES THAT THE AGENCY TREATED HER UNFAIRLY BECAUSE OF HER GENDER . SPECIFIC CHARGES ARE HEAVILY CENSORED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a legal case that is enveloped in secrecy , one of the CIA ' s senior female spies has gone_to federal_court to protest alleged injustices based on her gender . Protected by a pseudonym , &quot; Jane Doe Thompson &quot; claims that her troubles began after she filed a complaint against her deputy four years ago &quot; for beating his wife to_the_point of strangulation. &quot; Thompson was then the CIA station chief in a Caribbean area country . The heavily censored lawsuit charges that she &quot; thereafter became the target of an inspector_general investigation initiated by the male deputy &quot; and several other people she had disciplined for other reasons . The overseas post she headed &quot; was known to and admitted by the CIA to be a problem office , &quot; the court papers said . Although offered a higher position in the CIA in the spring of 1991 , her promotion was withdrawn after another male employee &quot; stated he would not work for a woman , &quot; according to the lawsuit . The complaint comes at a time when the spy agency is negotiating an administrative settlement in another case -- a class-action sex discrimination complaint brought_in 1991 by women employed in the CIA ' s operations directorate , the division that handles foreign espionage and covert actions , in which &quot; Thompson &quot; also works . The complaint in that case claims there has been a systematic denial of promotion opportunities for women and that , when female employees complain about it , they are instructed to have a psychological evaluation . Members of Congress who sit on committees overseeing the agency said the clandestine service is still largely a male bastion , although it has recently worked to promote women . Director of Central Intelligence R . James Woolsey , named as principal defendant in the &quot; Thompson &quot; suit , acknowledged after taking_office last year that sex discrimination had been a problem . He promised to try to remedy it . Overall , women today hold about 12 % of the CIA ' s senior operations , analysis and administrative posts , which is up from only 6 % five years ago , according to the agency ' s figures . A spokesman for Woolsey said he could not comment on the merits of either the &quot; Thompson &quot; case or the class-action complaint because they are in the hands of agency lawyers . The &quot; Thompson &quot; complaint , filed under seal_in federal_court after her administrative reviews were exhausted , provides a number of detailed allegations that remain classified because CIA lawyers have persuaded the court that their disclosure would compromise people and places involved in agency operations overseas . However , several legal motions that were unsealed in Alexandria , Va. , district court have parted the curtain on some charges . The plaintiff alleges , for example , that the offending male deputy &quot; admitted . . . his history of physically abusing his wife. &quot; Nonetheless , he &quot; was never investigated by the agency and was later promoted , &quot; the motions claim . &quot; Thompson &quot; said she believed this conduct over a period of years constituted a federal offense because it occurred &quot; on United States_government leased property while posted abroad and under diplomatic cover , &quot; according to the complaint . &quot; Thompson &quot; charged that the CIA also failed to investigate her reports of other &quot; specific instances of misconduct &quot; by male employees in her office , including repeated drunkenness , sexual misconduct and one employee ' s threat to kill a security_guard . Victoria Toensing , a Washington lawyer representing &quot; Thompson , &quot; has also complained about the conduct of CIA lawyers responsible_for responding to claims in the lawsuit . In correspondence and legal_briefs unsealed by the court , Toensing charges that the agency ' s office of general counsel has abused its authority under a secrecy agreement that the CIA requires from attorneys representing agency employees . Under the agreement , the CIA has authority to censor any agency-related lawsuit before it is made public . The purpose is to protect classified information . In court papers , Toensing contends that CIA officials have had nearly a month to approve a censored version but have not done so -- keeping the complaint itself from public view . She said CIA lawyers originally told her it would take no more_than two days for them to delete any classified material from the complaint .</TEXT>
