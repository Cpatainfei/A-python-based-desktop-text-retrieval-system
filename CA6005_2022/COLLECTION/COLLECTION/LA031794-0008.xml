   <HEADLINE> PYONGYANG DEEPENS SUSPICION ; HARD TO AVOID CONCLUSION IT ' S GOING NUCLEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> North_Korea ' s promise to cooperate with inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency has proven to be a sham . Frustrated IAEA inspectors have reported to their headquarters in Vienna that they were prevented from carrying_out tests at a key nuclear laboratory north of Pyongyang . Those tests could have helped determine whether Kim Il Sung ' s Stalinist regime is diverting plutonium from power_plants to weapons production , as U.S. intelligence agencies think . This latest instance of duplicity inevitably deepens the suspicion that the north secretly is engaged in acquiring a nuclear arsenal . On Monday the board of governors of the 120-member IAEA will meet to decide what to do next . The United States , meanwhile , has rightly chosen to cancel a planned high-level meeting with a North_Korean official next week to talk_about improving relations . With the north failing to demonstrate any good_faith at all , it would be absurd for Washington to do otherwise . The IAEA is responsible_for policing compliance with the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty . If it believes North_Korea is cheating -- and it is becoming virtually impossible to reach any other conclusion -- it could refer the issue to the U.N. Security_Council for action . The sooner this is done , the better . The challenge raised by Pyongyang is not only to the United States and its allies in South_Korea and Japan but to the integrity of the international treaty system , specifically the agreement to control the spread of nuclear_weapons . In seeking to subvert that effort , North_Korea -- the only state that is a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty that has so far refused to allow full inspections -- poses not just a regional but a global threat . Getting the Security_Council to respond to it as such won ' t be easy . Most states , unless they perceive an immediate threat to their own interests , are more comfortable endorsing equivocation than supporting bold action . But a namby-pamby response that allows North_Korea ' s cheating to go unpunished seems sure to invite further assaults on the treaty . So a lot more_than North_Korea ' s recalcitrance may be at stake here . Also to be considered is the larger threat that defiance implies for world stability .</TEXT>
