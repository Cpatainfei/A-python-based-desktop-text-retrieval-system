   <TEXT> After three months of deadlocked negotiations , community_college instructors and administrators have agreed to return to the bargaining table on March 4 , district and union officials said Thursday . &quot; I think that ' s very good news , &quot; said Allan Jacobs , board of trustees president of the Ventura County Community_College District. &quot; No one wants a long , dragged-out disagreement. &quot; The two sides announced in the early fall that their negotiations were officially stalled over the teachers ' 1993-94 contracts . In November , they met with a state-appointed mediator who declared them too far apart in their positions to continue with collective_bargaining . The teachers are asking_for a 3 % salary raise and a cost-of-living adjustment . The district wants to maintain salaries at current levels and ask the teachers to contribute to the cost of their health benefits . CONSTANCE SOMMER</TEXT>
