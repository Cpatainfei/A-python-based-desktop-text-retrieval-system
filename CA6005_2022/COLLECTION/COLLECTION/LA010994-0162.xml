   <HEADLINE> CAN U.S. REASSUME ROLE OF EUROPE ' S FATHER FIGURE ? ; DIPLOMACY : THE EUROPEAN FAMILY APPEARS DYSFUNCTIONAL . AND THE MOST TROUBLESOME ADOLESCENTS ARE DISINCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT DADDY KNOWS BEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bill_Clinton enters this week on his uncomfortable inheritance as the father-figure for the dysfunctional European family . U.S. Presidents have always had to treat the Western European allies as a particularly troublesome adolescent -- big and strong enough to stand on its own feet , but still needing the assurance of paternal control . Now the European family has widened to include the frightened children of Eastern Europe , huddling for NATO ' s protection against their age-old fears of the Russian bogey man . And in Russia , the United States is taking responsibility for an autistic young adult , potentially powerful , but terrifyingly unpredictable , barely in control and still unformed . Clinton got_to the White_House by attacking George_Bush as &quot; a foreign-policy President &quot; who did too_little for Americans at_home . Now he arrives in Europe today for the most important foreign trip of his presidency so far , believing that much of his domestic agenda depends_on his ability to calm and stabilize a Europe that some of his advisers fear is unraveling . This is not just the unending war in Bosnia -- itself a standing denunciation of any grandiose plans for a new North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization mission . But the dangerous and new equation is plain enough . Most of Clinton ' s plans for domestic U.S. reform -- and his hopes for a quiescent international scene -- depend_on Russia ' s orderly transition to a free-market democracy . From the anticipated savings in the U.S. defense budget to maintaining the U.N. Security_Council consensus , the United States has grown accustomed to Russia as a partner rather than a rival , and Clinton ' s worst fear would be any revival of the old Cold_War antagonisms . At the same time , relations with the traditional NATO allies of Western Europe are ragged , bruised by the arguments over Bosnia and the hard-fought compromise over world trade_in the General_Agreement Tariffs and Trade . &quot; It ' s hand-holding time again for Europe , &quot; sighed one senior State_Department official last week . &quot; A lot of us thought that the end of the Cold_War meant we would not have to play the psychological role of Daddy again . But the Europeans still need their American comfort blanket , and I guess we have to remind America that the stability of Europe is a vital U.S. strategic interest. &quot; So Clinton leaves with a four-part agenda : to mollify his European allies ; to revitalize NATO ; to reassure the worried Eastern Europeans , and to chart the West ' s relations with the problematic new Russia that is emerging after last month ' s parliamentary elections . As a result , Clinton ' s first voyage across the Atlantic since taking_office is three parts symbolism to one part substance . But the one substantial new policy he brings is of crucial importance to all_the rest : His new compromise new proposal for the future of NATO . Dubbed &quot; Partnership for Peace , &quot; this plan seeks to offer Hungary , Poland and the Czech and Slovak Republics a kind of country membership of NATO , a structure for cooperation pointedly designed to fend_off Russian fears of isolation by extending the NATO alliance up_to Russia ' s borders . This is a highly contentious proposal , which has left Poland ' s Lech Walesa warning that without a firm NATO military umbrella , Eastern Europe could face &quot; a major tragedy -- another Yugoslavia. &quot; And back in the United States , a fractious debate has begun over the new foreign-policy priority of doing nothing which could complicate Boris N . Yeltsin ' s relations with his generals , or provoke nationalist sentiment in Russia . Strobe Talbott , just nominated to be the new deputy Secretary_of_State , while maintaining his stewardship of policies toward Russia and the former Soviet republics , is the main author of this policy . His long friendship with Clinton gives him unrivaled access and influence with the President . Talbott believes that keeping Russia on track toward a free-market democracy , and as a cooperative partner in world affairs , is such a central U.S. strategic interest that other issues , from Eastern Europe to the increasing assertiveness of Russia toward its &quot; near abroad , &quot; must take second place . &quot; Partnership For Peace &quot; -- known to the diplomatic world as P4P -- is almost certain to be approved by the NATO summit . The European allies are so relieved to be back on top of the U.S. agenda , after the Asian flirtations of Clinton ' s first year , that they are silencing their doubts . Any sign of firm U.S. leadership for NATO , the_British and Germans agree , is better than last year ' s casual dismissal by U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher that U.S. policy had been &quot; too Eurocentric for too long. &quot; After smoothing ruffled feathers of the Western Europeans at the NATO summit in Brussels , the White_House plan trusts the Eastern Europeans will be reassured by their meeting with Clinton on his next stop , in Prague . U.S. diplomats have been warning Prague , Budapest and Warsaw not to complain too loudly about &quot; Partnership for Peace , &quot; or they could jeopardize even that limited NATO embrace . Clinton will stress to Presidents Vaclav Havel and Walesa that &quot; the angel is in the details &quot; -- and that P4P ' s program of joint military exercises and training represents a back_door into eventual NATO membership . But he will emphasize that , in this crucial transition period in Russia , it is in the interests of Eastern Europe as well as NATO not to alarm the Russian military and its nationalists that a new defensive line is being drawn through Europe . In Moscow , Clinton will stress his continued commitment to Yeltsin in_person , and to the process of Russian reform in_general , and has no plans to meet the leader of the extreme nationalist party , Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky . He will also try to rebuild the consensus among Russia , the G-7 Western nations and the international finance institutions -- the World_Bank and International Monetary Fund -- about the strategy of Western support for Russian reform . In the wake of Russia ' s elections , interpreted by Yeltsin and in Washington as a protest vote against the social costs of economic reform , Clinton , Vice_President Al Gore and Talbott all said the West should help bring &quot; more therapy and less shock &quot; to the process of Russia ' s transition to a free-market economy . But Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , who also travels_to Russia this month , agrees with the Europeans , the World_Bank and the IMF that a country with 15 % -20 % inflation each month can hardly be said to have been hit by the shock_therapy of full-blooded economic reform . A compromise is likely , if it can be agreed in talks with Yeltsin , under which the West might marginally relax its conditions on Russian inflation_rates to provide more funds to stabilize the currency and help build a social safety net for the poor and unemployed . In return , Russia ' s central_bank would have to clamp_down on its monetary supply , and recent Russian controls on the access of foreign banks and foreign investors to the Russian economy would have to be eased . Privately , the Clinton_Administration is calling this its &quot; Year of Europe &quot; -- though the use of this phrase , which offended Europeans when Henry A . Kissinger coined it in 1974 , is banned . American irritation with Europe ' s periodic fits of vapors is understandable enough , when Europeans whimper for America ' s paternal attention and then fret rebelliously when Big Daddy rubs it in . By the end of this year , Europe should have sufficient U.S. attention to start complaining about it again . There will be three more presidential visits across the Atlantic after this one . By then , NATO and the Eastern Europeans should be content with all this presidential quality time . But across what is emerging as Europe ' s de_facto new frontier in Russia , the autistic orphan may well be fractious and threatening enough to resume Moscow ' s old strategic role as the threat binding the rest of Europe and America together . If so , Europe will expect delays in Clinton ' s desired defense cuts . A big stick is required to play the role of Big Daddy .</TEXT>
