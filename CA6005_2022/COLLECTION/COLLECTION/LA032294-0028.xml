   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY_COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL : CYPRESS ' FRANCE THINKS HARD , THROWS HARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Aaron France , a sophomore pitcher at Cypress College , spends a lot of time thinking_about his performance . He pores over the scouting report , carefully considering the way he plans to pitch each hitter . The results have been impressive so far this season . He is 6-0 with a 1.53 earned-run average . France , a right-hander who relies_on his fastball , change-up and curve , has 48 strikeouts and 15 walks in 47 innings . But despite France ' s success , Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said he still gets too caught_up in the mental side of the game . &quot; He gets_into his own head sometimes , &quot; Pickler said . &quot; He has no idea how good he can be . . . He really doesn ' t understand how well he ' s doing . He needs to throw to his own strengths more and worry less about the hitter ' s weaknesses. &quot; France explains it this way : &quot; Coach Pickler and Coach ( Bill ) Pinkham tell me that I ' m a psycho sometimes . But I ' m a perfectionist . . . The team ' s No . 1 goal is to win the ( Orange Empire ) Conference and I want to help all I can. &quot; Cypress is 18-5 , 5-2 in conference and a game behind first-place Riverside . France is expected to start against host Riverside at 2 p.m. today . Considering his past , France can almost be excused for his struggles with success . In his three years of varsity baseball at Loara , the Saxons were 25-50 . He was impressive at times but also had his share of poor outings . He was bothered by a sore right elbow that required surgery in October of 1990 . Pickler saw France pitch early in his senior year and was impressed with his velocity and fluid arm motion . A Toronto Blue_Jays ' scout also took_notice of France that season and he was drafted . But France said he wasn ' t ready to play professionally and enrolled at Cypress . He was the only freshman in the starting rotation and finished with a 5-3 mark . Baltimore drafted France at the end of the season , but again he wasn ' t ready to sign so he returned to Cypress . Now he ' s being recruited by Miami , Long_Beach State , Arizona , Arizona State and the University of San Diego . Several professional scouts also are still interested . He ' s happy with his accomplishments but is quick to point_out that two-thirds of the conference season remains . France , who has taken pitching lessons since he was 8 , knows he faces some difficult decisions in the coming months about picking a college or accepting a professional offer . &quot; It ' s hard for me to understand how playing baseball amounts to all this , &quot; France said . &quot; I ' m just thankful I have the talent that it takes_to get this far. &quot; * Track_and_field showdown : The five local men ' s and women ' s track teams -- Fullerton , Golden West , Orange Coast , Rancho Santiago and Saddleback -- meet in the first Orange County Classic starting at 9 a.mr. Saturday at Fullerton . The meet was the idea of Jim Kiefer , Fullerton ' s coach and men ' s athletic director . Kiefer , with sponsorship help by the Fullerton Rotary_Club , was finally able to get the meet started this year . &quot; This is something I ' ve wanted to do for a long_time , &quot; Kiefer said . &quot; It ' s fun to bring everyone together like this . We can showcase the talent our county has to offer. &quot; The first final , the women ' s distance medley relay , is scheduled for 9:20 a.m. A majority of the final events are between noon and 2 p.m .</TEXT>
