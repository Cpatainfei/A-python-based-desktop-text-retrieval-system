   <HEADLINE> REBEL MUSLIMS , SERBS ATTACK BOSNIAN SOLDIERS IN BIHAC ; BALKANS : RENEGADE FORCES TRY TO RECAPTURE LOST TERRITORY BEFORE U.N. HAS A CHANCE TO LAUNCH AIR STRIKES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Renegade Muslim forces and Serbs attacked government soldiers Sunday in northwest Bosnia , apparently trying to recapture lost territory before the United Nations could react . Senior U.N. officials met in Zagreb , Croatia , to consider using NATO warplanes to attack Serbian forces under expanded powers granted Saturday by the U.N. Security_Council . The New York Times reported in today ' s editions that North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization warplanes were ready to bomb a Serb-controlled airfield in Croatia on Sunday but were forced to call_off the attack because of bad_weather . The Times quoted unidentified Western officials . Government troops in Bihac , in northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina , were under_attack by renegade Muslim forces and rebel Serbs , according to the United Nations . Serbian artillery in neighboring Croatia was firing across the border at the government forces . Rebel Serbs captured the waterworks for Bihac , a city of 48 # 000 people , giving them control of the water_supply , said U.N. sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity . The assaults reflected the determination of the Serbs and of Muslims loyal to warlord Fikret Abdic to cripple the government army , which defeated Abdic in August and broke_through Serbian lines in a stunning advance last month . A U.N. official in Zagreb earlier reported heavy fighting around Velika Kladusa , Abdic ' s former headquarters near Bihac . Government forces there are surrounded , and the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the Abdic forces appeared to have the upper_hand . The official HINA news_agency of Croatia reported the &quot; whole border between Bosnia and Croatia is_on fire . . . under joint attack by the Abdic forces and Bosnian Serb forces. &quot; It said they were supported by artillery and tanks firing from Serb-held Croatian territory . Croatian President Franjo Tudjman , who recently has become an ally of Bosnia ' s Muslim-led government , invited the United Nations on Friday to bomb rebel Serbs in his country to stop the cross-border attacks . In Batnoga , Croatia , just across the border from Velika Kladusa , refugees who fled with Abdic in August were waiting_on Saturday to return . &quot; Each shell means our return home is closer , &quot; said Minka Hadzic while listening to explosions from the fighting . The Security_Council has given U.N. commanders authority to call_in NATO warplanes to protect &quot; safe areas &quot; such_as Bihac from attack . On Saturday , the council expanded that to allow NATO warplanes to bomb rebel Serb forces in neighboring Croatia if they launch attacks against Bosnian government forces . Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic demanded air strikes against the rebel Serb forces . &quot; It is critical around Bihac right now , and we ' re waiting for the response of the U.N. and NATO immediately , &quot; said Silajdzic after a meeting with U.S. Ambassador Victor Jackovich . The top U.N. official in the region , Yasushi Akashi , and the military commander , Gen . Bertrand de Lapresle , met in Zagreb and issued a statement condemning &quot; cross-border and military activity from Serb-held Croatia. &quot; U.N. sources in Sarajevo said that , if De Lapresle orders air_attacks , his priority is to knock_out the Serbian airstrip at Udbina in Croatia . It was used to attack Bihac on Friday and the nearby town of Cazin on Saturday . No one was injured in Bihac , but nine people were killed and 15 wounded in Cazin . One of two warplanes attacking Cazin crashed , killing its pilot , according to U.N. officials . French officials say De Lapresle requested a NATO attack Friday but was turned_down because the Security_Council had yet to give permission to bomb in Croatia .</TEXT>
