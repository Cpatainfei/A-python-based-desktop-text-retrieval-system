   <HEADLINE> SALE OF $ 3 # 395 O.J. SIMPSON STATUES SHOWS LOTS OF BRASS ; CELEBRITY : MARKETING OF BRONZE FIGURES OF MURDER_SUSPECT IS PERFECTLY LEGAL BUT POSES ETHICAL QUESTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First there were the trading_cards . Then last week the commemorative coins went_on the market . And now there is the $ 3 # 395 statue . The efforts to make money from O.J. Simpson ' s notoriety -- some of them by Simpson himself -- are taking_place in the vast moral and legal valley known as profiteering , a landscape where phrases like &quot; pre-indictment price &quot; are part of the lexicon . One example of the remarkable money-raising activities is a 21-inch-high , 30-pound bronze sculpture of &quot; The Juice. &quot; Wearing his trademark No . 32 jersey , Simpson is depicted holding a football on his hip , his helmet at his feet , his autograph at the base . The statue , cast in Oregon , was advertised for_sale this week in numerous media outlets . Simpson will receive an unspecified percentage of the revenues . Simpson -- facing massive legal bills and dwindling personal assets -- not only approved the project , but while in jail has viewed three renderings of the sculpture and made suggestions for changes . There is no legal impediment to Simpson engaging in such ventures while in jail . Still , some question the ethics of turning notoriety -- enhanced by accusations of murder -- into an entrepreneurial opportunity . There is also the prospect that if Simpson is convicted , relatives of his alleged victims might be able to recover some of his profits under a state law that attempts to limit the ability of criminals to make money from their crimes . Author John Gregory Dunne , who wrote a long article on the Simpson case for the New York Review of Books , said he was appalled . &quot; Shame seems not to have crossed the ken of anyone involved in this case , &quot; he said . Steve Brill , president of Court TV , which is televising the Simpson case , also expressed indignation and said his network has declined to advertise two other Simpson-related products as a matter of principle . &quot; The question is , do you want to be involved in the general coarsening of our society ? &quot; he said . The arrival of the Simpson statues is hardly surprising in a society &quot; obsessed by titillation , &quot; where celebrity has become more and more an end in itself , said David Halberstam , the author of highly acclaimed books on politics and sports . &quot; O.J. is now a bigger celebrity . . . . In my lifetime , we ' ve never had an accused murderer of this fame . There is inevitable . . . exploitation. &quot; Tucker Freeman Smith , editor of Collector ' s Sportslook , a Congers , N.Y. , magazine that tracks the prices of sports memorabilia , acknowledged that &quot; the way everyone has cashed_in_on O.J. is kind of gross , from the network news to the street vendors . But people have a right to make a dollar ; we live_in a capitalist society. &quot; More_than 1 # 000 of the sculptures , introduced earlier this week , have been ordered already by people from as far away as Tokyo , according to Lenward Holness , president of Collectibles , Rarities , Arts and Special Holdings ( CRASH ) , the West Los Angeles company that is marketing the statues . Simpson ' s jailhouse evaluation of the sculpture design included his suggestion that the jawline be firmed_up , Holness said . Simpson ' s friends A.C. Cowlings , Robert Kardashian and Paula Barbieri also added suggestions . Holness said he planned to give the former football star the 32nd statue as a Christmas_present this week , although Simpson would not be allowed to keep it with him in his jail_cell . If Holness sells 25 # 000 of the statues , as he anticipates , that would mean gross_revenues of $ 84.9 million . Holness declined to say what the accused double murderer ' s share of the take will be . Simpson ' s business lawyer Leroy B . Taft declined to return calls . Reached in Texas where he is vacationing , Simpson ' s agent , Mike Gilbert , said he did not recall the terms of the deal . Holness defended the ethics of the sculpture project , saying it had been planned eight months before Simpson was accused of the June 12 murder of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Lyle Goldman . &quot; My personal feeling is that it is a business transaction and O.J. Simpson is the greatest running back of all time , and until he is proven guilty he is innocent , &quot; Holness said . While not endorsing the venture , Los Angeles defense_lawyer Harland W . Braun said it was important to remember that Simpson &quot; is a man who has spent his life exploiting his public image . He is simply continuing to merchandise his public image. &quot; Entertainment law expert Lionel S . Sobel of Loyola Law_School said that Simpson ' s share of such a venture normally would range from 5 % to 10 % of the gross retail sales . But he said the percentage could be higher for the statue because of the unusual circumstances in which it is being marketed . Also , because the sculpture is priced so high , &quot; there is a larger margin of gross_profit built_in than there would be_on sweat shirts or autographed footballs. &quot; If Simpson is ultimately convicted , his profits might be erased by by California ' s &quot; Son of Sam &quot; law , passed_by the Legislature in response to outrage about criminals who made money by selling their stories . A New York law of this type was struck_down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1991 . However , California ' s statute , which has never been tested in court , is sufficiently different that it might withstand challenges , Sobel said . Although Simpson has a legal_right to a share of the proceeds of any merchandise marketed with his likeness , he has decided not to pursue claims against the bevy of free-lance entrepreneurs selling O.J. Simpson T-shirts , cups and Pogs ( with &quot; guilty &quot; and &quot; not_guilty &quot; sides ) at Southland venues such_as the Criminal_Courts Building , according to informed sources . The sources said that Simpson ' s lawyers had concluded that the likelihood of any substantial return from lawsuits was likely to be outweighed by the expense of pursuing such cases . During the summer , Simpson , fulfilling a contract he signed before being arrested , autographed football cards in his jail_cell that were sold to collectors around the country , according to memorabilia experts . Shortly after Simpson was arrested , prices on his cards rapidly escalated , but in recent months there has been &quot; a steady decline to the pre-indictment price , &quot; said Smith of Sportslook . &quot; His rookie card from the 1970 Topps football set is currently trading for $ 175 . We saw it go_up to $ 400- $ 500 in L.A. and Buffalo . Everything got_out of whack in L.A. &quot; Last week , a special coin commemorating Simpson ' s best year with the Buffalo Bills went_on the market . Simpson has approved the design and marketing of the coin , which hails his 1973 performance , when he became the first runner in the history of the National Football_League to gain more_than 2 # 000 yards in one season . The Buffalo , N.Y. , and Provo , Utah , businessmen who are jointly marketing the coins said nearly all_of the 6 # 000 produced have already been sold . Richard Jakubczak , 61 , who previously had coins minted to commemorate the Bills ' four consecutive American_Football Conference championships , said he and Simpson first discussed the project when they ran_into one another at Buffalo Airport in August , 1993 , but nothing came of it . The venture got started in_earnest after the two men discussed it again last January at the inaugural ball of Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello . &quot; All of a sudden , problems started in June , &quot; Jakubczak said , referring to the murders . &quot; We forget about the coin . Who wants to do a coin in relationship to all_the problems O.J. is having ? &quot; But last August , Jakubczak said , Simpson ' s agent Gilbert called him , flew to Buffalo and told him that Simpson still wanted to do the coin . &quot; I was flabbergasted . I said would n ' t it hurt the situation , would n ' t it be sensationalizing ? &quot; Ultimately , Jakubczak said , a deal was struck after he convinced Gilbert that it would be inadvisable to produce unlimited numbers of the coins : &quot; If we do a limited issue , we ' ll have a coin that will be in_demand from now to doomsday. &quot; The silver-dollar-size coin was designed by Blair Buswell , who sculpted the bust of Simpson that is_on display at the Pro Football Hall_of_Fame in Canton , Ohio . One side of the coin has a drawing of Simpson and the words &quot; O.J. Simpson and the Electric_Company , &quot; the nickname of the Bills offensive linemen who paved the way for his record-breaking runs . His 1973 statistics appear on the other side . The coins are selling for $ 69.95 each in gold and $ 34.95 in silver , Jardine said . Additionally , 100 editions of a special boxed set containing a one-ounce silver coin and a one-ounce silver coin layered in 24-karat gold were produced and are being sold for $ 400 . Simpson is receiving royalties from the sale of the coins , but Jardine declined to say how much . The first 32 sets were delivered to Simpson so that he could give them to friends as Christmas_gifts , Jardine said . The balance of the sets sold_out immediately , Jakubczak said , as have almost all 6 # 000 of the individually numbered coins . &quot; I would have bought the coins no matter what , &quot; said Tom Hacker , 45 , a customer in Jakubczak ' s Select Stamp and Coin shop in Buffalo . &quot; He ' s a Hall of Famer ; he played for the Bills . It has nothing to do with the murders. &quot; &quot; The coin is so hot it ' s unbelievable , &quot; Hacker said , referring to the fact that the coins already have a resale value of triple their original price in Buffalo . But Hacker , a Buffalo native , said he has no plans to turn a quick buck on his coin set : &quot; This will stay in my family . This will be passed_on to my son and daughter. &quot; Another purchaser , Democratic New York state Sen . William Stachowski , said he bought the coins &quot; because I ' ve always been a football fan , because of the football accomplishments , not because of the off-the-field stuff . Any time I ' ve been in the company of O.J. Simpson , he ' s been a real gentleman. &quot; Statue marketer Holness said several well-known people have purchased the Simpson statue , but he declined to divulge their names or that of a San Francisco man who purchased a dozen , citing privacy concerns . However , he arranged a telephone_interview with Betty J . Adams of Dayton , Ohio , who said she bought one of the sculptures for her 35-year-old son , whom she described as a longtime football fan and admirer of Simpson . &quot; I figure this will kind of make_up to my son for not taking a picture of him shaking hands with O.J. &quot; when they met on the streets of Barcelona during the 1992 Summer Olympic Games , the mother said . &quot; O.J. was a very nice guy from what I could tell. &quot; As for the morality of marketing the statue now , Adams said : &quot; Hey , ( Simpson ) needs the money . His defense_team is expensive . He ' s going_to be dead broke if he doesn ' t do something. &quot; Times staff writers Helene Elliott and Tim Rutten contributed to this story .</TEXT>
