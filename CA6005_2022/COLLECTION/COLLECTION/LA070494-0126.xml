   <HEADLINE> CRACKING_DOWN ON SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY TEACHERS ; LAW : O.C. EDUCATOR WHO MOLESTED AT LEAST 5 STUDENTS IS ONE OF 177 IN STATE TO HAVE CREDENTIAL REVOKED IN 1993-94 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In January , George Melvin Fairchild , 53 , a teacher and coach in Fullerton district high_schools for 28 years , admitted to a judge that he had a special relationship with some of his students . He had molested at least five of them . But their side of the story surfaced months later in a lawsuit . One alleged that Fairchild called her &quot; B.B. &quot; in class and told her it stood_for &quot; big boobs. &quot; Another said he exposed himself and asked_for oral_sex , and several said he fondled them . One said he continued to write to her after she moved to another school district , repeatedly hinting or asking_for sex . The suit alleges the harassment extended over at least 2 1 / 2 years . Fairchild pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual battery , child molestation and lewd conduct with a minor and was sentenced to three years ' probation , including a $ 500 fine , psychological counseling and 500 hours of community service . The conviction cost him his teaching_certificate . During last year and this , 177 teachers , counselors or administrators in California have had their certificates revoked for sexual misconduct with students , ranging from sexual innuendo to sexual_intercourse . Nationally , at least 552 certificates have been revoked , probably more , given the inexact reporting methods . It ' s the most common reason by far for revoking certificates , both in California and nationally , and has been over the years . &quot; Sometimes they are really reckless , &quot; says Orange County Deputy Dist . Atty . Chuck Middleton , whose child-abuse unit prosecuted Fairchild and similar cases . &quot; They destroy their careers . You have to think they just can ' t control their appetites. &quot; Sometimes unreported by intimidated students , sometimes swept_under_the_rug by embarrassed school officials , sometimes passed_over by prosecutors because of their difficulty , such cases are getting more attention nowadays . Some states are toughening their laws , including making sex between teachers and minor students a crime under any circumstance . A national data bank of teachers ' names who have lost their certificates for sexual misconduct may make_it harder for such teachers simply to change_states and re-enter the schoolroom . And child advocates are calling_on school districts to confront the problem squarely by warning teachers of the consequences of sexual misconduct , then coming_down hard on those who transgress . Legislation pending in Sacramento will allow school districts for the first time to participate in state hearings to revoke teaching credentials . Then , say some education officials , unreported cases might be reported , and the problem might begin to shrink . &quot; We would certainly like to believe we get all_the reports , &quot; says Nanette Rufo , an attorney for the state commission that issues education credentials . Yet , she says , it ' s certain that some cases are not reported . &quot; The school districts ' concern is to get these people out of the district , &quot; Rufo says . &quot; Our concern is broader ; we ' re concerned that they may still be licensed to teach in the state . I ' m sure there are reports that should be filed that aren ' t , but the size of the problem we would have no way of knowing. &quot; Some offending teachers are pedophiles , adults who are sexually stimulated by children . Gene Abel , a psychiatrist at the Behavioral Medicine Institute in Atlanta who sometimes works under federal grants , is researching ways of screening for and treating pedophiles . &quot; Generally , there ' s nothing unusual about the persons perpetrating this . You couldn ' t see it about them . Many of them have a lot of good traits -- excellent teaching , concern about students. &quot; Abel recalled one 40-year-old teacher who was voted teacher of the year while he was molesting an 8-year-old girl by setting_up appointments for her to come_to his office alone . &quot; He sent her an inch-high stack of love_letters . He was married and had children of his own. &quot; Separate from the pedophiles are those teachers who become sexually involved with adolescents , and again , nothing seems to make these teachers stand_out from the rest . &quot; It ' s exceedingly common for males to be attracted to adolescent females , &quot; Abel says . &quot; When males are young , they ' re more likely to be attracted to older_women well beyond their age . As you get older , the arousal shifts . Most males are attracted to individuals who are younger and smaller than they . Now , who ' s younger and smaller ? &quot; They ' re around these individuals all_the time at school , and adolescent girls are constantly trying_out flirtatious behavior . It should be no big surprise that adults are attracted to adolescents. &quot; Patrick Wayne Martin , 34 when he was arrested last year in Costa Mesa , pleaded guilty to two counts of oral_sex with a 17-year-old student at Fountain Valley High_School . Prosecutors said he had no previous criminal_record and was_well liked on campus . A stream of teachers and students testified on his behalf at his sentencing hearing . &quot; He looked_like a real nice guy , &quot; said Middleton , the deputy district_attorney . &quot; He looked_like a typical young teacher , the type where everybody would like to be in his class . He showed a lot of interest in his students . This guy epitomizes the teacher who you ' d never guess was involved in this sort of thing. &quot; It ' s even less likely that anyone would single_out Michelle Lynn Smith , 36 , a home_economics teacher at Kraemer Junior_High_School in Placentia for 13 years . Yet she faces seven felony counts of lewd conduct with a minor that prosecutors allege stem from a nearly yearlong relationship of heavy petting , but not sexual_intercourse , with one of her former students , then 14 years old . &quot; You ' d never expect a female , especially with a 14-year-old , &quot; Middleton said . &quot; She ' s married and has kids . It ' s beyond comprehension. &quot; The effect of molestation on the child or adolescent can be lasting and catastrophic , said Justin D . Call , a psychiatrist who directs child and adolescent psychiatry at the UC Irvine California College of Medicine . Often children simply keep the molestation a secret or force it from their memories . The events are not discovered , or rediscovered , until adulthood . Call estimates that one in every four psychiatric patients has sexual molestation by an authority figure in his or her background . But even when &quot; forgotten , &quot; the molestation has its effects , Call said . &quot; They are mistrustful of all authorities , all figures of power they run_into . And their own sense of morality is undermined. &quot; In extreme cases , the child can grow_up to be a molester . &quot; What happens in a case like that is a young_person ' s sexual development is short-circuited . Their evolution in normal sexuality is damaged . It becomes a distortion of one ' s whole personality , &quot; Call said . Every state declares an age below which a child does not have the legal_power to consent to sex . This &quot; age of consent &quot; varies -- in North Carolina it ' s 13 , in California , 18 -- but all laws are based on the belief that these children are too inexperienced and too easily intimidated to weigh such a decision . &quot; But when you talk with perpetrators who molest , they are great supporters of children being treated as equals , &quot; Abel says . &quot; They take the position that anyone can decide what he or she wants to do . &quot; They say to themselves , ' Well , you know she ' s just asking me to get involved , she wants me to teach her all about sex , and after all , she ' s flirtatious. ' But they never check this reasoning out with anyone else . They keep it a secret to themselves. &quot; Succeeding encounters without being caught often embolden molesters to_the_point of recklessness , Abel says . &quot; Eventually they think what they ' re doing is fine . &quot; When they ' re first questioned , or first arrested , it ' s startling . They ' ll just tell you these preposterous explanations -- she initiated it or she should have refused -- and you ' ll say , ' This guy ' s a nut. ' For the first time , they ' re checking out their distortions. &quot; One of the nation ' s busiest investigators of classroom offenses is Edward F . Stancik , whose office , special commissioner of investigation for the New York City School District , was created 3 1 / 2 years ago in reaction to patronage scandals . A former New York County assistant district_attorney , Stancik is independent of both the city ' s school_board and mayor . Stancik says the teachers he has investigated fall_into categories . &quot; Some are predators . They know which students are vulnerable . They look_for kids with trouble at_home , who don ' t have positive role_models in their lives , who might be flattered by the attention . They target them and continually get themselves in relationships . &quot; Sometimes relationships start off innocently , and after a while something ' s going_on . I think there are those who simply get_in over their head and find themselves in a situation they hadn ' t planned on . &quot; And some do_it just out of lust. &quot; Victims vary , too . According to Abel ' s research , in child-molesting cases not involving touch , 99 % of the victims are girls , but if touch is involved , 62 % of victims are boys . Yet almost all victims who report being molested by their teachers are girls . that ' s because it ' s expected that &quot; we protect girls , &quot; Abel says . &quot; We don ' t protect boys . They ' re supposed to be little_John Waynes. &quot; Most complaints are made to school authorities , and what happens after that can vary . California state law requires that &quot; any child_care custodian &quot; who &quot; knows or reasonably suspects &quot; that a child has been &quot; a victim of child_abuse &quot; must immediately report it to a child protective agency , which usually means the police . But this does not always happen , says Middleton . &quot; Historically they try to deal with them in-house , ship them to another school , maybe they ' ll be OK . Sometimes they try to think_of ways not to report , and that ' s where they get themselves into trouble . They mix administrative policy with the law. &quot; The Fairchild case was an example , according to Middleton . There had been previous complaints , and school authorities reacted by transferring Fairchild to another school , Middleton says . When the latest outbreak of complaints occurred , school officials tried to handle the_matter themselves and never did report the complaints to law_enforcement authorities . Part of the reason , Middleton suspects , is a seeming conflict between California ' s education regulations and its criminal_law . Education regulations require that such cases be reported to Sacramento for administrative action only when the district has firsthand information about sexual misconduct , such_as a statement from a victim , witness or perpetrator . But criminal statutes require educators to immediately report any suspicion of sexual misconduct to law_enforcement authorities . But it ' s not usually that simple , says Peter A . Hartman , superintendent of the 1 # 120-teacher Saddleback Valley Unified School District in southern Orange County . &quot; Half or more of the cases relate to an incident that happened many years ago , usually past the statute of limitations . It ' s like somebody has grown_up and gone_into counseling and decided to go_back and try to clear_up their past . At that time it ' s awfully late to verify what actually happened . &quot; It ' s hard to get witnesses . Usually there are no witnesses , even in those cases that happened within a year . You have one person ' s word against another . You have to balance against teachers that are falsely accused . Occasionally there are false accusations . If you ' re dealing with a teacher with a lot of years with few or little complaints and none in the last four or five years , who ' s generally well liked and gotten good evaluations , it ' s really hard to decide in the middle of the career of this individual who to believe. &quot; And though there are varying degrees of sexual impropriety -- from improper flirting and sexual suggestions to actual sexual_intercourse with a minor -- school administrators have only two alternatives in dealing with such teachers , Hartman says . &quot; You either fire them and take their credentials away or let them keep teaching . I think there should be some intermediate discipline -- suspension for a month or a year , something not so bad they lose their jobs . It ' s like for everything there ' s a life sentence. &quot; Many cases do not lead to trial , Middleton says , because &quot; it ' s a very gray and pretty wide area . These are some of the most difficult cases in our office. &quot; The victim ' s statements must be corroborated in some way , and juries react differently in every case , he says . The older-looking and more promiscuous the victim , the more likable the teacher , the more likely a jury will refuse to convict , he says . Middleton recalled an Orange County case that prosecutors finally withdrew as hopeless . A 13-year-old girl said the teacher had oral_sex with her and once took her to a motel_room for sex , but she could not remember the location of the motel . Though convinced of his guilt , prosecutors could see the teacher &quot; would make a very good impression , because he had a lot of support ( among teachers and students ) . He had denied it all_the way down the line . He was a good-looking guy , studious , the educator appearance . And she ( the victim ) was going_to have problems with credibility on the stand . She couldn ' t remember things and was very vague about some things . Without the motel_room record , we didn ' t have any corroboration. &quot; Even without criminal prosecution , teachers can be fired and their credentials revoked , but there are limitations . To start with , says Hartman , it ' s expensive . Holding hearings to dismiss a teacher can cost a school district as much as $ 100 # 000 in legal and administrative costs . State authorities who issue and revoke credentials have only one investigator and depend mostly on the reports of other agencies . And under state law , persons vocationally licensed by the state , including teachers , can wait a year , then apply for reinstatement of their licenses . Since July , 1990 , four educators convicted of felonies -- having_sex with underage students -- have had their credentials reissued . A bill now pending in Sacramento would plug this hole , forbidding recertification of educators convicted of felony sex offenses or felony drug offenses involving minors . Revoked credentials have not kept some sex offenders out of the schools . Moving to another state and applying for a teaching credential there could reopen the field for a disciplined or even convicted sex offender . Communication between states and checking of references has been lax in the past , says Douglas F . Bates , an attorney for the Utah State Office of Education . &quot; It was so unwieldy to trade information among the states , &quot; Bates says . &quot; There was just a general lack of timely information about people who should never have access to kids. &quot; The answer to this , authorities hope , is a clearinghouse formed by the National Assn . of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification , for which Bates is legal adviser . Formed in the late 1980s , the clearinghouse has finally reached agreement with education authorities in all states on reporting the names of teachers whose credentials have been revoked for any reason . The association now is trying to persuade Canadian authorities to join the clearinghouse . Under the agreement , each state provides and updates information from its own records . Then the composite lists are distributed to all states monthly . But the system is still imperfect . Though requested to specify the reasons for revocation -- sexual misconduct with_children is the biggest category -- some states refuse to do_it . Others lump their sexual misconduct cases with others in the miscellaneous category . Some states have reported no revocations at all . &quot; You get underreporting at all levels , &quot; Bates says . &quot; Teachers are often allowed to resign if they ' ll just leave for good. &quot; &quot; I think the hesitancy to report is common , &quot; says Stancik . &quot; It ' s sort of a natural_phenomenon in bureaucracies generally . The temptation is to try to avoid a problem . Many times administrators want to sweep it under the carpet rather than risk embarrassment for the schools. &quot; Changes are afoot , however . In California , legislation is pending that would require the results of hearings into teacher misconduct to be more thoroughly documented and available to the public . Legislation would also do_away_with the requirement that complaints must be from firsthand sources , and would allow school districts to participate in state hearings . In Utah , where anyone 14 or older can legally consent to sexual_intercourse , a recent law makes a special case of persons in a &quot; position of special trust in_relation_to the victim , &quot; teachers and counselors specifically . In effect , there is no age of consent in these cases . For a teacher to have_sex with a student who is not an adult is a felony , regardless of consent . Punishment can range from five years to life in prison . A task_force in New York City is studying ways to prevent sexual misconduct among educators , but some strategies are already apparent , Stancik says . &quot; For actual employees , you have to make perfectly clear that the system won ' t tolerate this . You ' ll be thrown_out and prosecuted . I think you will deter cases if you do that . &quot; And you have to tell administrators what you expect of them , specifically . If they have evidence , they are to report it to the appropriate law_enforcement authority immediately . And the system should make_it clear that if you don ' t do that , disciplinary action will be taken against you . . . . &quot; Most of the principals we ' ve dealt with , especially since the requirements have been published here , do report now. &quot;</TEXT>
