   <HEADLINE> WESTSIDE / COVER STORY ; OPEN SEASON ; MALLS USE SALES AND GIMMICKS TO BATTLE LARGE DISCOUNT_STORES FOR HOLIDAY DOLLARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One mall features a pet-friendly Santa Claus and a menorah-lighting ceremony . Another sports new &quot; niche &quot; stores , a post_office and valet parking . And all deck their halls with what is now a Yuletide staple -- pre-Christmas sales to get_even Grinches to open their wallets . Across the Westside , malls are offering a crush of new services , merchandise and dollars-and-cents inducements to ensure strong holiday-season business , which typically accounts_for 25 % to 40 % of mall retailers ' annual sales . Their efforts , coupled with an uptick in post-recession consumer confidence , may be paying_off . Though sales figures for this holiday season are not yet available , Westside mall managers and retailers report a marked improvement over last year . There are , to be sure , downsides . Some analysts , for instance , warn that by luring shoppers increasingly with pre-Christmas sales , malls may be making_it harder for themselves to sell during the rest of the year . But most experts agree that malls have had no choice but to find new ways to draw a crowd . With the cost-conscious public shopping increasingly at discount_stores and outlets , malls have sought to become far more_than simply places to buy shoes and clothes . &quot; It ' s not fun when you go_out to a warehouse-type store to buy a carton of paper_towels , &quot; said Mark Schoifet , spokesman for the International Council of Shopping_Malls . &quot; But it can be fun to spend the time with your kids at a mall , shopping , eating and stopping in a museum. &quot; There ' s plenty of evidence that Westside malls have been scrambling to create a broader retailing and service mix that includes automated bank teller machines , movie_theaters , and both fast-food and upscale dining . Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza , angling for the discount dollar , opened a T.J. Maxx cut-rate clothing_store in November , while the major tenant , Sears , has just finished a $ 2.5 million renovation . To trumpet the changes , the mall on Nov . 25 hosted a Christmas parade that culminated at the mall . Beverly Center , meanwhile , has opened 20 new stores in the last three weeks , tempting shoppers with high-profile stores including Guess ? , Timberland and Ann Taylor Studio . And Fox Hills Mall in Culver City is experimenting with billboard advertising that promises shoppers easy access and easy parking . A key goal , mall managers say , is to regularly attract surrounding residents . Sometimes , however , their strategies diverge . Century City mall , for instance , is tailoring its holiday offerings to affluent professionals with little leisure_time . According to mall surveys , the majority of customers come_with an agenda : to buy an item , attend a movie , or go_to a restaurant , said Linda Smith Frost , marketing manager of Century City Shopping_Center and Marketplace . &quot; Generally , during the holidays we try and provide atmosphere , but not host a lot of events , &quot; Frost said . &quot; We believe ( events ) impede business , and get_in the way of why people are here. &quot; Hence , the mall has not sought the services of a Santa Claus -- but provides efficient valet parking . To the west , however , Santa Monica Place offers a multitude of holiday activities and services . The mall has hosted celebrity appearances , Westside school choirs and a menorah-lighting ceremony for the eight days of Hanukkah -- the first night drawing more_than 500 people , according to mall officials . Santa Monica Place even publishes a holiday schedule of events , printed on the paper place_mats used in the food court . And it also provides a Santa -- but not just any Santa . For the savvy kids , the mall demands that Santa must have an authentic , snowy-white beard , said Robin Faulk , Santa Monica Place ' s marketing director . But St . Nick must also be something of a St . Francis . In an effort to cater to Santa Monica ' s many single , pet-owning residents , Santa must also offer his lap to dogs , cats and other critters . &quot; ( Santa ' s ) held everything , &quot; Faulk said , grinning . Meanwhile , at Fox Hills Mall in ethnically diverse Culver City , children can choose their own Kris Kringle . The mall has African American , Caucasian and Latino Santas on_hand . And at the Westside Pavilion , a post_office substation has been set_up so shoppers can immediately ship the gifts they purchase . All six Westside malls have adopted Yuletide sales . Last week , The Limited clothing retail_chain in the Westside Pavilion was prominently displaying &quot; Holiday Countdown Sale &quot; signs offering 10 % to 50 % discounts on various merchandise . Even the perennial after-Christmas sale of holiday greeting cards was advanced at The Nature Company at Century City mall . The specialty_store cut the price of Christmas_cards by 30 % weeks before Christmas . Nowhere is the aggressive mark-down strategy more evident than in the department_stores -- or , in mall lingo , the &quot; anchor &quot; stores . Weekend sales have become the norm in recent weeks at Robinsons-May , The Broadway , Sears , J.C. Penney and Bullock ' s . Hard-core shoppers Anna Irons of Hancock Park and Barbara Hurwitz of Van Nuys were among those taking_advantage of the bargains last week at Westside Pavilion . The pair sat on a couch in the shoe department of Robinsons-May , surrounded by half_a_dozen recent purchases , as Hurwitz tried_on several styles of boots on sale . &quot; Look_at these prices . They were $ 69 now they ' re $ 40 , &quot; Hurwitz said . Irons , a self-described shopaholic , said she shops and buys , Christmas or not : &quot; With these sales , I just buy more. &quot; Some experts warn such holiday bargains could backfire . Jack Kyser , chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. , says consumers begin to expect sales , and become resistant to paying full-price -- exactly what merchants want to avoid . &quot; After years of experience , shoppers learn the lesson that things are going_to be marked_down near Christmas , &quot; agreed Russ Joyner , general_manager of Fox Hills Mall . A far greater challenge to area malls , however , is a trend that the holiday markdowns are in part intended to combat : the competition from discount_stores . Consumers are increasingly turning their shopping_carts in the direction of Ross Dress 4 Less , Target and Toys R Us , eager to pay a_few dollars less . Shoppers also flock to large discount malls , where large-chain retailers sell out-of-season merchandise . Although the so-called outlet malls have yet to appear on the Westside , they have sprung_up in Oxnard , Barstow and the City of Commerce -- and attract their share of Westside customers . &quot; ( Shoppers ) drive across the country to save a dime , &quot; said Dick Carter , vice_president of Blattris Realty Co. , a Century City firm specializing in retail leasing . &quot; People are getting very , very cost-conscious. &quot; Taking a break from their expedition at Westside Pavilion last week , Culver City residents Karen Coyle and Bernice Bradley said they go_to Westside malls only during the holiday shopping season to buy presents , see the decorations and &quot; get_in the spirit. &quot; Both said they prefer to make their regular purchases at such discount_stores as Target , Costco , or Kmart . It is against this background that area malls have been scrambling in recent years to vary their retail and service offerings . Whether or not the strategy has helped bring_about a particularly green Christmas this year is so far unclear . Some mall retailers are far from joyous . Longtime toy retailer Linda Brody said Christmas sales this year have been been anything but booming at her store , Imaginarium , at Century City Shopping_Center . &quot; There has been a tremendous lull between Hanukkah and Christmas , &quot; said Brody . &quot; I just don ' t see the crowds blowing down our door. &quot; On Dec . 9 , she reported that the mall was virtually empty . &quot; I could have rolled a bowling_ball down one of the corridors and not hit anyone , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m not delighted at all. &quot; Yet most retailers agree that compared with last year , more shoppers were out this year on the Friday after Thanksgiving , traditionally the busiest shopping day of the year . &quot; Retail sales have been very , very strong , &quot; said Kyser . &quot; The post-Thanksgiving holiday shopping rush indicated a strong Christmas period. &quot; According to U.S. Commerce_Department figures , Los Angeles County posted retail sales of $ 18 billion during the last three months of 1993 , Kyser said . Taking_into_account what appears to be renewed enthusiasm of buyers , he predicted the final three months of this year will bring_in sales of $ 19.8 billion . &quot; ( The Christmas rush ) definitely came earlier this year , &quot; said Frost of Century City Shopping_Center , echoing the sentiments of other mall officials and many retailers . Last year , people waited until the last weekend to make their purchases , she said . Frost estimates 150 # 000 people came_to the mall in the three-day weekend following Thanksgiving ; the mall ' s normal daily car count is 30 # 000 . &quot; Consumer confidence is definitely up , &quot; said Evette Caceres , marketing director of the Beverly Center . She said approximately 165 # 000 shoppers came_to the 900 # 000-square-foot Beverly Center in the post-Thanksgiving weekend , about 10 % over a normal weekend day . Joyner of Fox Hills Mall estimates that this year ' s holiday sales are 5 % to 10 % ahead of last year ' s pace . Said Joyner : &quot; We ' re pretty optimistic. &quot; Mall managers can thank people like Karen Coyle . Though Coyle prefers to do her regular buying at discount_stores , she still can ' t resist the mall ' s Yuletide allure . &quot; I dread shopping in malls normally , except for at Christmastime , &quot; the Culver City woman said . &quot; Then I don ' t feel guilty about buying lots of presents. &quot;</TEXT>
