   <HEADLINE> TO PUT IT CRUDELY : END OIL EXPORT BAN ; A TIME-WARPED POLICY NEEDS LIBERATION BY WASHINGTON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Does_it make_sense to continue to ban U.S. exports of crude_oil ? No , plain and simple . It ' s high_time to get_rid_of this albatross . The ban is contrary to free_trade -- and unfairly excludes U.S. crude from international markets . There is no oil crisis now ; indeed , the world is awash in low-priced oil . Yet the prohibition on U.S. crude exports goes_on . Why ? Lifting the ban has been called a &quot; no-brainer &quot; by some energy experts , but the politics of oil often defy logic . Common_sense tells us that forbidding oil exports is no substitute for a coherent energy policy . Congress should reject the ban when it comes_up for review later this year . The wall against exports was erected during the 1970s oil emergency . The rationale was to provide a measure of self-sufficiency : Oil vital to U.S. energy and national security_interests would n ' t go_to foreigners . The ban has meant that Alaskan producers have little choice but to send their oil south instead of abroad ; so most of that crude ends_up in California . The Alaskan oil , in turn , depresses prices here for California-produced heavy crude , which is less desirable for domestic refining in the current market . California ' s independent producers say that , given the Alaskan glut , it ' s not profitable for them to pump crude from the ground . But ah , there is a huge overseas market -- especially for Alaskan oil -- in Japan and elsewhere . Alaskan crude would be going overseas instead of to California were it not for the ban . There have been exceptions to the ban : In 1991 , the Bush_Administration granted an export license to two California oil_companies to sell their heavy crude in Asia . Why not allow the free flow of oil for all ? Opponents of lifting the ban cite the need to secure energy resources and the threat of higher prices for consumers . They note that the United States already imports about half of its oil and that prices here could rise with export demand and the increase could be passed_on at the pump . Perhaps , but prices depend_on overall market conditions , domestic production and other unpredictable factors . The U.S. Department_of_Energy plans to launch a study , which will include hearings , on lifting the ban . Restricting U.S. oil exports makes little economic sense . Our judgment is that those hearings will yield the conclusion that the domestic import ban distorts markets and prices and hardly offsets U.S. reliance on oil imports .</TEXT>
