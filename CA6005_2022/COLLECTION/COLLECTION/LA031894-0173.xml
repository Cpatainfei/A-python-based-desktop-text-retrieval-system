   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; CELEBRATION OF D-DAY LANDING : A MESSY FLAP ; KOHL IS IGNORED BY WORLD_WAR_II ALLIES . HE INSISTS IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO GO . GERMANS FEEL EVENTS SHOULD HIGHLIGHT RECONCILIATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How many times must Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s aides explain that , really , the German leader never nosed around for an invitation to the Allies ' 50th anniversary celebration of D-Day in Normandy next June and does not feel snubbed at all that his good friends the_French have not offered him one ? Kohl believes that it would be inappropriate to attend a celebration of the defeat of German soldiers , even if he were asked , aides say -- unless French President Francois Mitterrand were to personally do the asking . But then no one really expects that to happen . Mon Dieu . Mein Gott . What an undiplomatic mess . So far , the 50th anniversary of the Allies ' landing on the beaches of Normandy in Nazi-occupied France is turning_out for Germany about as well as the 40th anniversary did_in 1984 , when Germany also was left_out of the official celebration . that ' s when Kohl arranged to meet with then-President Ronald Reagan in the Bitburg cemetery and insisted upon keeping the date even after it was discovered , to Reagan ' s embarrassment , that some of Hitler ' s Waffen-SS troops were buried there . The commemoration of the Normandy invasion , which turned the tide of World_War_II in the Allies ' favor , is the first event in more_than a year of anniversaries , including that of an assassination attempt against Hitler on July 20 , 1944 , the liberation of Paris , the Battle_of_the_Bulge , the crossing of the Rhine by Allied forces , the meeting of Russian and U.S. troops on the Elbe_River and , finally , the capitulation of Germany . German sensitivity over the issue has reached such heights that Kohl has taken_control of his country ' s commemorations himself and directed all ministries to refer queries to his office . Kohl aides note that post-war Germany has been an unfailing friend and ally of the West , and they are perturbed that the D-Day activities aim to be more a celebration of victory over Germany than of democracy and reconciliation . &quot; If I am good friends now with someone with whom I fought 50 years ago , I would n ' t celebrate my victory over them , &quot; a Kohl aide said . &quot; How long will they be celebrating this ? A hundred years ? Two hundred ? Or is this the end ? &quot; The chancellor fears that Allied breast-beating might offend German nationalism during a crucial election year , and he has barred German diplomats from military-style ceremonies for D-Day . The French and German governments actually are quite close . In 1984 , Mitterrand and Kohl met in Verdun over the graves of World_War I soldiers as a symbol of reconciliation , and Mitterrand apparently had promised Kohl a similar gesture this year . But French efforts to appease Germany sensibilities so far have backfired . French Defense Minister Francois Leotard announced last week that he and his German counterpart , Voker Ruehe , would tour a WWII cemetery together in Normandy . But Leotard quickly withdrew the invitation when it turned_out that , as in Bitburg , Nazi Waffen-SS were buried there . This week , Jean-Marie Girault , the mayor of the Normandy city of Caen , announced that Kohl was welcome to his city ' s evening celebration of D-Day , although the_French government did not invite the chancellor to the main daytime event at Omaha Beach with President Clinton , Britain ' s Queen Elizabeth_II and other dignitaries . Bonn replied that the chancellor did not view this as a formal invitation . WWII Remembrances Other World_War_II anniversaries to be marked beginning this summer : Assassination attempt against Hitler : July 20 , 1944 Liberation of Paris : Aug . 25 , 1944 Battle_of_the_Bulge : December , 1944 to January , 1945 Crossing of the Rhine_River by Allies : March 7 , 1945 Meeting of US . and Russian troops at the Elbe_River : April 25 , 1945 Germany ' s surrender : May 8 , 1945</TEXT>
