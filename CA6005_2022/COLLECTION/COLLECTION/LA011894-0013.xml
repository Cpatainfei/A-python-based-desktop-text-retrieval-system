   <HEADLINE> YOUR BODY / KATHLEEN DOHENY : OPEN HOME MEDICAL GUIDE AND SAY ' AHH '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Suddenly , your back hurts in a place you ' ve never noticed . Or a strange rash on your neck draws you into that familiar dilemma : Do you spend time and money at the doctor ' s office , or is this something you can fix yourself ? Home medical guides -- those hefty bibles that clue you in on everything from diaper_rash to schistosomiasis ( a tropical parasitic disease ) -- might just hold the answer . Many physicians see a role for such books ; some even recommend specific titles . The key to their proper use , of course , is knowing when you need simple reassurance from a book and when you need professional medical_care . In the future , thumbing through these guides might become passe , as more consumers turn_to computerized versions . The Survey : In a random polling of area physicians , the guides most often mentioned good sources of information were : * &quot; Take_Care of Yourself &quot; by Drs . Donald Vickery and James Fries . The fifth edition , published by Addison-Wesley , is $ 17.95 and includes easy-to-follow flow_charts that help the reader decide when it ' s time to call or visit the doctor . * &quot; Better Homes and Gardens ' New Family Medical Guide , &quot; edited by Edwin Kiester Jr . and published by the Meredith Corp. , sells for $ 19.95. Chapters are organized by organ ( lungs , skin ) and problems ( arthritis and related disorders ) . * &quot; AMA Encyclopedia of Medicine , &quot; published by the American Medical Assn . and Random House , sells for $ 44.95. Described as &quot; an A-to-Z Reference Guide , &quot; the 1 # 184-page book includes an index of commonly prescribed drugs and information on more_than 5 # 000 medical terms and conditions . For Young Patients : Families with young children might also want to consider a pediatric health guide . &quot; Your Child ' s Health &quot; is recommended by Dr. Russell Spadaro , a_Thousand Oaks pediatrician . Published by Bantam , the $ 16.95 book by Dr. Barton Schmitt lists emergencies first in alphabetical order and includes information on common newborn health_problems . Dr. Susan Keisner , a family practice physician with FHP Plaza Medical_Center , Long_Beach , recommends &quot; Dr. Mom , &quot; by Dr. Marianne Neifert . The $ 5.99 paperback , published by Signet , includes sections on normal development and care of sick children . Also recommended : &quot; &quot; When Do I Call the Doctor ? &quot; by Los Angeles area pediatrician Loraine Stern , which promises speedy information for nervous parents . Published by Doubleday , the $ 12.50 book provides answers to &quot; 200 common and not so common childhood complaints in 60 seconds. &quot; How to Shop : &quot; Look_for something that is well-organized , by problem or symptom , &quot; suggests Dr. Stephen Brunton , a physician on staff at Long_Beach Memorial Medical_Center . &quot; Look_for a book that tells you when to relax and when to call the doctor , &quot; he adds . Brunton especially likes guides that advise readers what information the doctor will need during a telephone consultation . Taking body_temperature is often overlooked , he finds . &quot; I ' m amazed at the number of people who don ' t even own a thermometer and who don ' t expect that the doctor will ask the patient ' s temperature , &quot; Brunton says . Look_for books with preventive health and practical information , doctors suggest . For instance , Stern ' s book includes a chapter on &quot; How to Make the Best Use of the Telephone. &quot; Like auto repair_shops , she notes wryly , pediatricians ' offices can be busy on Monday mornings . So if parents can wait until a less frantic phone time , they might get more attention . Some books , including the Better Homes and Gardens ' guide , include timetables for checkups . How-To : Use home guides to obtain basic information about common diseases such_as chicken pox , colds and flu or to reinforce the information about a specific condition or treatment already discussed with the physician . &quot; It ' s amazing how much confidence is built by a doctor who says the same thing as the book , &quot; Keisner says . Caveats : Even so , Keisner adds , &quot; I worry some of these books might cross the line and give people false reassurance that everything is OK . I have patients who will grab onto any excuse not to see the doctor. &quot; The Downside : Even very intelligent , well-read consumers can be steered awry by home medical books . One Los Angeles woman who normally doesn ' t get headaches turned_to her home medical guide when one struck . When she matched up her headache and other symptoms , she feared meningitis . The emergency_room doctor diagnosed sinusitis . The Future : Computer whizzes are already getting medical information ( and viewing surgery ) from their home PCs . Experts predict that the practice will become more common . &quot; Mayo Clinic Family Health Book CD-ROM , &quot; released in 1992 , is a computer medical guide included as a package on some CD-ROM equipped computers , says Karl Kortepeter , an account_executive at Connecting Point computer_store in Burbank . Besides basic information , there ' s a bonus for strong-of-stomach viewers : they can watch surgery , including an animated arthroscopic knee operation . The program has sold more_than 250 # 000 copies , according to IVI Publishing , an electronic publisher offering the title in cooperation with Time Life . Another CD-ROM program includes information on heart health and yet another on pharmacy questions is_due out_in 1994 .</TEXT>
