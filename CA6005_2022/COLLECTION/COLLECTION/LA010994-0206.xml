   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK : CALCULATING SOCIAL_SECURITY BENEFITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q : Every year I get an &quot; estimated benefits &quot; statement from the Social_Security_Administration to see if they have correctly recorded my annual earnings and contributions . My 1993 statement shocked me . Even though my contributions to Social_Security for the year were $ 150 higher than what I had paid in 1992 , the amount I was told that I could expect to receive upon retirement was $ 50 per month less in 1993 than it was in 1992 . How can this be ? -- M.R . * A : There is a rather simple , straightforward explanation for the difference , although the Social_Security_Administration didn ' t bother to openly share it with taxpayers . Fortunately , it doesn ' t portend lower benefits upon retirement . Here ' s what happened : Sometime in the middle of 1993 , the Social_Security_Administration decided to begin expressing taxpayers ' estimated retirement_benefits in terms of current dollars . Until then , the agency had been adjusting the benefits by an estimated inflation_rate -- 1 % was the last figure used -- to project the amount a taxpayer might actually receive . What ' s the difference ? The current system is designed to give you the present value of your estimated future benefits -- not the amount_of_money you will actually receive . For example , if your 1993 statement said you were entitled to $ 800 in monthly benefits at age 65 , it means that when you begin receiving benefits , your monthly check at that time should have the same buying power as $ 800 does today . The agency is no longer forecasting exactly what that figure will be , only that it should be roughly equivalent_to $ 800 in 1993 dollars . Why was the switch made ? A couple of reasons . According to the agency , the new system should give taxpayers a better idea of the buying power of their future retirement_benefits . For example , how well can you live_on $ 800 a month right now ? Will it cover your rent , food , utilities , transportation ? Probably not , a conclusion that should lead you to begin -- if you haven ' t already -- your own personal retirement savings program . Another reason was to eliminate confusion caused by the inflation factor projections . In some cases , particularly those involving taxpayers many years away from retirement , the amount of inflation-adjusted future benefit estimates was obviously far higher than current Social_Security benefit limits . It was also far in excess of estimates given to older taxpayers much closer to retirement , a situation that apparently caused tremendous confusion and consternation . Can you imagine the reaction of a 55-year-old taxpayer -- who has paid into the system for decades and is just 10 years from retirement -- when he discovers that his projected benefits are apparently lower than a younger worker who has contributed substantially less into the system and is still decades away from retirement ? Of course , these apparent discrepancies are the result of applying the inflation factor over the remaining employment years of the two workers . But try telling that to thousands of irate taxpayers ! It was easier just to change the estimating system . By the way , taxpayers interested in finding_out how much they have contributed to Social_Security and what they can expect to receive upon retirement should call ( 800 ) 772-1213 and ask_for form SSA-7004 , &quot; Personal Earnings and Benefit Statement. &quot; When you get the form , complete it and mail it back to the enclosed address . The Social_Security_Administration will then send you a listing of your employment earnings and expected retirement_benefits . If you think there is an error in the information , call the toll-free phone_number provided on the form . Taxpayers Responsible_for Their Savings Bonds * Q : I am buying U.S. Savings Bonds on a regular basis as part of my retirement planning effort . However , I am concerned about the safety of my certificates in the event of fire , loss or theft . Is there any way to have the U.S. Treasury hold my certificates just as brokerage_houses hold stocks for their clients ? -- H.M . * A Taxpayers are responsible_for holding their own Savings Bonds . However , the Treasury_Department will replace lost , stolen or damaged bonds free_of charge . Clearly , you would be wise_to keep your bonds in the safest possible location , such_as a safe deposit_box at your local bank . You would also be wise_to keep a list of your bond holdings , including their serial numbers , issue dates , denominations and Social_Security_number of the bondholder , in another equally safe spot . ( You should do the same thing with other &quot; paper assets , &quot; such_as stock_certificates , that you choose to hold yourself. ) If , however , your Savings Bonds are lost or destroyed , you can get them replaced fairly easily . Simply ask your local bank for form PDF 1048 , complete it and mail it to your local Federal_Reserve_Bank . Taxpayers in the central and western United States can mail the forms to the Federal_Reserve_Bank of Kansas City , P.O. Box 419440 , Kansas City , MO 64141-6440 . IRA Contribution Deadline Is April 15 Q : Have I missed the deadline for making my 1993 contribution to my tax-deferred retirement account ? I am self employed and have an SEP-IRA . * R.F . * A The deadline for making contributions to individual_retirement_accounts is April 15 of the year following that for which the contributions are being made . Contributions to Keogh and SEP-IRA accounts can be made as late as Oct . 15 of the year following that for which the contributions are intended , if the taxpayer wins an income_tax filing extension . However , Keogh accounts must be established before the end of the taxable year in_order to be eligible to accept a contribution for that year . SEP-IRA accounts may be established at any time up until the taxpayer ' s income_tax filing deadline .</TEXT>
