   <HEADLINE> SPECULATION TAKES TOLL ON BODY SHOP ' S CLEAN IMAGE ; STOCKS : THE COMPANY ' S SHARES PLUNGE FOLLOWING RUMORS ABOUT UPCOMING ARTICLES QUESTIONING ITS ETHICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rumors of impending bad news have become bad news for the Body Shop , whose stock has plunged nearly 10 % amid speculation that its environmentally conscious image is about to suffer an attack in America . The sale of stock in the cosmetics and toiletry chain , which markets itself as ethically and environmentally responsible , was reportedly prompted by upcoming U.S. articles that criticize the Body Shop ' s ethics . Body Shop Chairman Gordon Roddick acknowledged Wednesday that one incident mentioned in the press recently -- a 30-gallon spill of Fuzzy Peach Shower Gel in New Jersey -- had occurred . But he called the rest of the ruckus &quot; nonsense being created by the zealots of cynicism. &quot; &quot; They are determined to blow trivia and day-to-day events out of all proportion , and to feed a story based on rumor and innuendo , &quot; Roddick said . The Body Shop International PLC is not perfect but is &quot; proud_of our record and proud_of what we do. &quot; This coverage indicates how financial markets can go wild when speculation begins feeding_on itself . The Body Shop ' s trial by headline began last Friday , when the Financial Times , London ' s daily business newspaper , led its Companies and Markets section with a story entitled &quot; U.S. ethical fund turns against Body Shop. &quot; The story said that the ethical investment fund , Franklin Research and Development Corp. , unloaded 50 # 000 shares of Body Shop , amid concerns that upcoming criticism of the company would hammer the stock price . Since that story appeared , Body Shop stock plunged 9.5 % from 242 pence , or $ 3.63 a share , to close at 219 pence , or $ 3.28 a share , in London on Wednesday . The story said Franklin Research would soon &quot; provide a more detailed article on the company in a newsletter &quot; and that its decision to bail_out of Body Shop stock was based on information it has seen in a draft article to be published soon in the United States . The article in_question is scheduled to appear Sept . 1 in Business Ethics , a specialist magazine based in Minneapolis that insisted Wednesday it has not revealed to anyone the contents of an upcoming feature on the Body Shop . The Body Shop ' s environmental stance brings intense scrutiny from a variety of investment funds that keep tabs on the business practices of companies they invest in . A senior_vice_president of Franklin Research , Patrick McVeigh , says in a letter appearing in Wednesday ' s editions of the Financial Times that the newspaper was off base in suggesting his group has &quot; turned against &quot; the Body Shop . &quot; We are independently researching a report on the Body Shop ' s ethical performance , which we have not finalized , nor have we reached any conclusions , &quot; McVeigh wrote from Boston .</TEXT>
