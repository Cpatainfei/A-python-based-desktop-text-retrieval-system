   <HEADLINE> INTERIORS ; LET THE BRIGHT , FRESH LOOK OF SPRING COME IN FROM THE COLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that spring is in the air , thoughts are turning_to the outdoors , to sprucing_up the patio furniture and planting flowers in the garden . Sometimes , in the rush to get_out , the inside of the house gets left in its winter doldrums . With a little time and imagination though , a house ' s interior can , like a garden , be transformed with the seasons . Here are a_few tips from professional designers for bringing the bright , fresh look of spring into your home with a minimal expenditure of energy and cash . Bedrooms can be transformed from their heavy winter look -- beds piled high with blankets and heavy comforters -- by changing the bedding . What could be easier than changing the sheets and bedspread or comforter ? &quot; You can have one bedroom design for winter and one for spring and summer , &quot; said Carolyn M . Wuille , whose interior_design business is based in Irvine . &quot; White cotton with Battenburg lace is a great ( warm weather ) look. &quot; Keeping the dust ruffle neutral to the seasons can make the change even easier . If you have round_tables and night stands , change the cloth to a bright spring shade or match it with the new spring sheets . A matching tablecloth can be made easily from an additional sheet . Dining rooms or eat-in kitchens can be spruced_up for sunny weather by changing tablecloths or place_mats . Sunflower motifs are the hottest things this season , and accessories with the bright yellow flowers can be found at most discount_stores . Changing small details such_as the kitchen towels and pot holders helps create a fresh environment . When choosing fabrics for bed_linens and tablecloths , designer Terri Salazar of Kitchen Del Mar in Corona del Mar suggests staying with the color_schemes already in the house but choosing lighter hues . Fresh flowers also make an interior brighter , she added . Another trick for making a room seem brighter is to use glass accessories instead of pottery . &quot; Glass vases and bowls add a designer touch but do not take_up visual_space , &quot; Salazar said . Transparent objects do not &quot; stop &quot; the eye the way solid objects do . For a long-lasting spring look , nothing beats potted flowering_plants , according to Lisa Weber , who heads her design business in Fullerton . The key to keeping plants healthy and in bloom is to rotate them from outdoors inside . &quot; My house does not have enough light to keep plants blooming , &quot; Weber said . &quot; So I buy three or four plants and rotate them once a week . This way I have a show of flowers inside as well as on the patio. &quot; If you have more time and a modest budget , changing window treatments can add a new lighter look_to any room . Drapes are too cumbersome to change , but replacing curtains or mini-blinds with light colored fabric casually draped is an inexpensive way to update a room ' s look_for spring . &quot; The best thing you can do is bring as much of the outdoors in as possible , &quot; said Lana Barth , a Huntington Beach interior_designer . &quot; To do that you want to keep the view from the windows as unobstructed as possible. &quot; Barth suggests using natural colored gauze or even cheesecloth for windows . If there are already curtain rods , simply drape the cloth over the rod . If you must hang a new rod , a lightly stained wood rod is a good bet . If you do have heavy drapery , try putting_up a new valance or using new drapery ties to freshen the look_for spring . Painting the walls is always a good way to brighten a room , but who wants to paint twice a year just to cater to the changing seasons ? A simple way to use paint seasonally is to limit the amount of surface being painted . Only paint the trim in a room , or , if you have old wood furniture , don ' t be afraid to experiment on it with paint . &quot; Why not paint a tabletop white and then paint each of the chairs a vibrant color ? &quot; Wuille suggested . Slipcovers are a popular way to change the fabric on sofas and armchairs , but do not overlook the kitchen chairs , Wuille said . &quot; Straight-back chairs can get a dramatic new look with simple tie-on slipcovers. &quot; For a big change , replace heavy area rugs with natural sisal rugs , Wuille added . &quot; Actual sisal is great for spring and summer because it ' s light and casual . Pick a flat weave and you can even stencil a border to pick_up motifs in your house . &quot; Just make_sure it ' s a large-scale stencil so the pattern doesn ' t get lost in the nubby texture of the rug. &quot;</TEXT>
