   <HEADLINE> NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE THEY ' LL SEE ; RUSSIA 2010 : AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE WORLD , BY DANIEL YERGIN &amp; THANE GUSTAFSON ( RANDOM HOUSE : $ 23 ; 320 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I am perhaps not alone in thinking a Cold_War needs to be declared on books filled with motivational anecdotes that offer American and Russian leaders inspiration . Once an author gets anywhere near to mentioning streamlined nuclear deterrent strategies , or divulging on the dust_cover that my $ 23 will buy a read which &quot; grew out of a confidential study developed for a select group of international companies by a leading international consulting_firm , &quot; it ' s time to sound a Red Alert . ' Russia 2010 &quot; is yet another foundation-grant spinner in the perpetual motion of Russia / ex-USSR books . Its tragedy is twofold : It misses a huge and untouched constituency of book-buyers who , though curious about Russia , are anesthetized by tautological surveys ; and , perhaps more consequential , this type of hyped discourse mugs State_Department analysts ( who blundered in predicting Mikhail Gorbachev , Boris Yeltsin , the 1991 putsch , and the 1993 artillery barrage ) into conceiving what-it-means-for-the-world Russian strategies like medieval monks locked_in a cloister . Co-authors Daniel Yergin , a 1992 Pulitzer Prize_winner for his book &quot; The Prize , &quot; and Thane Gustafson , a Georgetown University professor and former think-tanker at the Rand Corp. , seem to enjoy drowning in the Russia chaos they want so hard to save us from . After balling together enough Russian yarns to stuff a bear , they unwind these wet narratives around projected events to create four possible life_forms to inhabit Future Russia . The technique is called &quot; scenario planning , &quot; a drill developed at Shell Oil in the early 1970s and now popular among consulting_firms and military forecasters to calculate &quot; a structured , disciplined method for thinking_about the future. &quot; So what ' s new in &quot; 2010 &quot; ? Not much , especially for those who ' ve taken the time to be haunted by Brian Cox ' s recent &quot; Salem to Moscow , &quot; or mesmerized by the prescience in any of W . Bruce Lincoln ' s histories of the early days of Bolshevism . Indeed , the MTV crowd would learn more by spending a_couple_of bucks for the late Frank Zappa ' s 1989 Financial News Network reports on how to develop trade with the USSR . The four &quot; scenarios &quot; are imaginative graduate-school exercises , but alongside the elegant calisthenics of &quot; Rethinking the Soviet Experience &quot; by Stephen Cohen , &quot; Russia 2010 &quot; has as much original power and fury as &quot; The Little Engine That Could. &quot; What ' s angering about &quot; Russia 2010 &quot; is that Yergin and Gustafson have all_the professional gear to be the Lewis &amp; Clarke of the new Russia , yet they wade around in Russia ' s entrails , sometimes divining prophecy like guest experts on McNeil / Lehrer , at other times sounding like the holiday tourist who acquires expertise through a long night drinking with apparatchiks aboard the Red Arrow train between Moscow and St . Petersburg . The authors maintain , for example , that whatever precise form Russian capitalism takes , by 2010 it will be a force to be reckoned with in the world economy . &quot; Increasingly , Russian will be a language heard in the financial district , the industrial fairs , the business hotels , and the ski slopes and beaches of the world. &quot; Such declarative wisdom , especially from a Pulitzer Prize_winner , is an intellectual misdemeanor . In discussing Russia ' s prime_movers , the term used in scenario development for the actors able to alter the game , they go_for the felony : &quot; As powerful as organized_crime has become in Russia the last few years , it is not a prime_mover in the fate of Russia and will not become one. &quot; This kind of announcement is rooted in the disingenuous belief made popular during the Industrial Revolution that society needs a_few crooks to amass wealth so that later generations can afford to grow_into law-abiding capitalists . Each Future Russia scenario is written in Milton-Bradley prose , game boards included . Muddling Down , in which Russia disintegrates , is Chutes &amp; Ladders ; Two-Headed Eagle , in which Russia becomes a militaristic plutocracy , is Stratego ; Time of Troubles is Risk for real ; and Chudo ( Russian for miracle ) is a convincing Candyland . Players in each game are required to accept such basic instructions as , &quot; The core of the Soviet system has been obliterated . The Communist ideology and its center of power , the apparatus of the Communist_Party of the Soviet_Union , have been destroyed. &quot; This might float in an oil_company think_tank , but anyone who ' s done hard_time in Russia will smile at such a notion . In varying degrees , Yergin and Gustafson underpin each sandcastle scenario with the assumption that the ruble can be gauged with an aerodynamic precision , neglecting to consider the drag of conservative estimates that show half the $ 31.7 billion Russia earned from exports in 1992 ( and nearly three times the $ 6 billion designated by the World_Bank for stabilizing the ruble ) fleeing Russia in the same year . A country ' s currency is only as strong as the goods produced by its economy , and money remains robust through reinvestment , not capital flight . Russia manufactures nothing the West wants . The Siberian El Dorado is too expensive for sufficient exploitation ; moreover , the price of reaching , harvesting and transporting this red_herring is too cost intensive to pay_back Western investors while concurrently fueling the velocity of immediate hard currency Russia needs to catapult its 150 million people into the 21st Century . As for the coherent economic_policy necessary to glue an economic miracle together by 2010 , forget it . Russia is still debating how best to invent the wheel while jets zoom overhead , and for Yergin and Gustafson even momentarily to apply Wall_Street wizardry to the ruble is to scumble the basic grammar of Russia . Yet Yergin and Gustafson are obsessive to_the_point of desperation to hold that Russia should be considered a Western-style country . Between the lines of all four scenarios lurks the view that the demise of systemic communism automatically gave Russian leaders a right to be judged as amateur democrats . By the most liberal of Western political and economic standards , Russian leaders are dangerous , Barnum &amp; Bailey with nuclear_weapons . that ' s the reality of Russian realpolitik , and it won ' t get you invited to a Russian Embassy cocktail_party . Tactful ? No , but notarized in whispers by more Western diplomats than one might imagine . There are certainly democrats and economic reformers in Russia , but not in the boxcar loads necessary to pull_off the socioeconomic miracle the authors fancy throughout and try to sell in the final chapter . &quot; What follows is a snapshot taken along Russia ' s road to the market , &quot; Yergin and Gustafson begin in the urgent pomp of a full_page , italicized epigram . &quot; These are not scenarios . The people are real , and their words are their own . Except for the tycoon Neverov , only their names and a_few details have been changed for their own protection . &quot; Then , in this &quot; Dragnet &quot; style , comes the phenomenal tale of young Ivan , a Russian entrepreneur under mafia pressure to turn $ 200 # 000 worth of Western goods over to heavily armed cutthroats . Blistering barnacles ! Ivan calls_in the KGB , who put a recording device on him . The mysterious gangsters are escorted away in handcuffs . &quot; It looks_like an American film , &quot; says Ivan . &quot; If there wasn ' t a KGB , the mafia would be in control . &quot; I ' ve never dreamed about the future , &quot; he says at the end of the visit . &quot; And I don ' t dream about the future now . There ' s a Russian proverb -- that a drunken sailor can come and knock everything over. &quot; Cartoon-bubble reportage with a moral is a fine way to end &quot; The Adventures of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets , &quot; but certainly not a book that offers authoritative jacket blurbs by former U.S. Ambassador Robert Strauss and former Defense and Energy_Secretary James Schlesinger . It makes an old Moscow correspondent wonder who ' s been kidding whom all these years . If Yergin and Gustafson had hoped to leave us with an electric parable on a Russian miracle , they would have done better to locate and identify Ivan ' s tormentors , and find_out how much it cost them to get_back into the miracle economy . In Russian , it ' s called kto kovo , and it ' s a shame the authors , who pepper &quot; Russia 2010 &quot; with selected Russian-language aphorisms , failed to check_out this phrase before concluding &quot; the state never quite managed to control the black market. &quot; Nonetheless , there ' s an influential category of individuals who will regard a book termed &quot; visionary and provocative &quot; by Richard Nixon on the dust_jacket as deserving more_than cynicism honed on reporting Moscow ' s mean streets and Gorbachev / Yeltsin press_conferences . If you count yourself among this distinguished group , I respectfully paraphrase what the late U.S. ambassador Chip Bohlen had to say over a poker_game at Spasso House , &quot; The only people to beware of in life are those who say I never get drunk on champagne , and the ones who want to tell you what ' s going_to happen in Russia. &quot;</TEXT>
