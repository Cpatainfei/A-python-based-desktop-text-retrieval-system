   <TEXT> As Kim Eaves runs errands in her Lake Forest neighborhood , she often takes her daughter , Monet , 4 . Eaves said that at the market , they discuss what types of baby food to buy for 1-year-old Zeb ulun and how to spell items they see . They sing the alphabet song while strolling the aisles and talk_about carrots and spinach as they hit the produce section . Monet delights in_handing the clerk the paper bills . Said Eaves , 31 : &quot; I want her to learn , but I also want to keep her occupied. &quot; Experts say that even with the occasional tantrums and turmoil that can accompany a young child ' s trip in and out of stores , parents are smart to involve little ones in some errands . By introducing or reinforcing math and reading skills in commonplace settings , they add , parents can make school lessons seem more relevant to a child and increase their chances of success . &quot; It stresses that learning isn ' t just listening to the teacher . There are opportunities in everyday life , &quot; said Barbara Willer , spokeswoman for the National Assn . for the Education of Young Children , a Washington , D.C.-based nonprofit organization specializing in the education of children up_to age 8 . And , when parents share_in the excitement and wonder of the learning discovery , this time with their kids can even be fun , said Marcy Cook , a math consultant who has 30 years experience in education , teaching and consulting . Here are some suggestions from Cook and other experts for making errands a learning experience . * On the road : A parent need not wait to get_to the destination ; learning can start en route . A child can try to remember how to get there . Prompting questions like &quot; Which way do we turn next ? &quot; or &quot; What do we pass first : the post_office or the gardening store ? &quot; or &quot; Where do we get_off the bus ? &quot; help jog a child ' s memory and sequencing skills . * At the mall : The child needs something to look_for or figure_out . &quot; A mall to a child is a large play area , &quot; said Studio City therapist Sharon Sackin , who conducts parenting workshops . &quot; A store is a wonderland of places to hide . The child thinks : ' How much fun can I have ? ' &quot; Sackin said the youngster can be given a problem such_as : &quot; We have to stop at the shoe_store , bookstore , and toy store in the mall . Help me figure_out the path so that we end_up at the pet shop. &quot; This helps create spatial abilities needed for geometry and problem-solving skills needed for algebra , experts say . &quot; They often know the lay of the land more_than you realize , &quot; Willer said . Allowing them to show_off their knowledge will make them feel good about the skills they have , increasing their self-esteem . * At the market : This frequent stop for parents can be approached as a game . Children who learn through play find learning exciting . &quot; Make_it like a scavenger hunt , &quot; Cook suggested . Children can help find items on the shopping list by using coupons . Before the trip , the child may be able to help by clipping coupons , Sackin said . Then , going_up and down the store aisles , the youngster delights in_using the pictures on the coupons to find the products . Younger children would be given one coupon at the appropriate aisle ; those with formal reading skills can be given several coupons from which to decide , Cook said . First- or second-graders can begin to learn the value of a dollar . They can be asked to see how many different things they can find to buy with $ 1 . As they scan the aisles for the price label , they are learning relative money values . Parents can ' t help but get pulled into the excitement of helping light_bulbs go_on . Some parents , Cook said , may opt to give the child a dollar and allow him to make a purchase and receive the change . Many children love receiving change because trading a paper bill for an item and five coins feels_like they ' ve made money on the transaction . Cook suggested posing the question : &quot; How could you have gotten the change differently ? &quot; &quot; A good start for a good question begins with ' How many different ways or things . . , ' &quot; Cook said . Counting and adding skills can also be reinforced in the market , Cook said . Preschoolers learn that one , two , three are more_than words to learn in_order ; they are the basis of a concept . Kindergartners can keep a tally of the number of items put into the cart , Cook added . Four lines and a slash equals five items . On the way home , the child counts by fives to figure the total , giving the child a jump_on learning multiplication tables . Once at_home , the parent can show the youngster how to use graph_paper to make a bar_graph showing the number of items purchased . The child colors a column , with each square representing five items . A different color can be used for each trip and the height of the colored_bars compared . Making bar_graphs prepares a child to plot points on a graph in geometry . &quot; Coloring is a fun thing , &quot; Cook said . &quot; Why not make_it meaningful ? &quot; Elementary school-age children can improve their accuracy with a calculator by keeping a running total . On the way home , they can double-check the tape total . The excitement , Cook said , is in trying the catch an error made by the store cash_register . * At the post_office : This is another perfect spot for a parent to engage a child and reduce having to reprimand junior for ducking in and out of the roped-off lines . Cook suggested posing this problem : &quot; I have $ 5 . How many 29-cent stamps can I buy ? How much change would I get ? &quot; Substitute other dollar amounts to keep the child thinking . Allowing a youngster to do the division computations with a calculator lets him or her to practice two skills . Even a child as young as 4-year-old Monet Eaves gets a lesson on pounds and ounces at the post_office . She loves to place envelopes on the electronic scale and push the buttons to enter the ZIP_code . After the scale computes the postage , she and Mom discuss what happens after a letter is mailed . When parents run an errand to the post_office or cleaners , they can also ask the child to remember as_many things as he can , Sackin said . When they get home , the child can draw a picture or write a narrative . Memory and language skills are tied into reading success . A parent may opt to reward the sibling who remembers the most . &quot; You are raising the child ' s desire to be more aware , &quot; she said . Children can even learn on quick trips to the gas_station . Besides conversations about how the car needs gas to run , parents can ask children to estimate how many gallons it takes_to fill the car , Cook said . Youngsters can take_into_account the level of the fuel_gauge . Their first guesses will be so way off they ' ll be entertaining . Estimation is another match skill , said Cook , adding that &quot; the more you know , the more frames_of_reference you have. &quot; * At work : A brief trip to a parent ' s office also provides opportunities for growth . Even by just going_along to pick_up or drop_off something , the child learns about career options , Willer said . Young children will use the career ideas in their pretend play while older children can start to plan their future . Debbie Gilmore of Cudahy took her daughter Kimberly , 15 , by her office at the Southern California Indian Center in Commerce . Gilmore , who once received employment training at the center , went_to drop_off her time_sheet and look over a job skills test . An unplanned lesson ensued : &quot; I told ( my daughter ) ' when you look_for a job , you ' ll take a similar test. ' She didn ' t know what went_into ( job hunting ) , how to fill_out an application or write a resume . She learned something new , &quot; Gilmore said . Quality time , like learning , happens as parents go_about their daily lives , even in such seemingly mundane tasks as errands , Willer said . &quot; It can be a very special time . It helps to create memories that are important for you and your children. &quot;</TEXT>
