   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; GUATEMALA ' S OTHER INDIAN ACTIVIST ; * TUYUC HASN ' T WON A NOBEL . BUT SHE WINS RESPECT AT_HOME FOR HER HUMAN-RIGHTS WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rosalina Tuyuc was a young mother of two when her husband left for work one day and never returned . The family had fled their rural homeland and moved to the capital in search of safety . But in Guatemala in the 1980s , there wasn ' t much safety for Mayan Indians , regarded by the army as pro-communist guerrilla sympathizers and decimated in military scorched-earth campaigns that wiped_out entire villages . For Tuyuc , the destruction around her became a call to action . She founded , and still heads , an increasingly high-profile organization of indigenous women whose husbands were among the tens of thousands of peasants killed or who disappeared during the brutal civil_war . While exiled Nobel peace laureate Rigoberta Menchu receives more international attention , Tuyuc slugs it out_in the trenches in Guatemala , promoting the cause of indigenous rights and challenging the military at great personal risk . Within Guatemala , she has emerged as the country ' s most visible Mayan Indian activist . Today Tuyuc and her organization , known as the Guatemalan National Widows Coordinator are taking_up issues , such_as forced military_service , that place them squarely at_odds with the army and the government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio . &quot; There will be no change in Guatemala as long as the hand of the military is always behind things , &quot; Tuyuc said in a recent interview , sounding a theme that recurs through her many speeches and public demonstrations . The solemn-faced 36-year-old , who wears her dark hair in braids or wrapped in a long ponytail down her back , sat behind a desk at the widows committee office , housed in a drafty , nondescript building that is purposely not marked with a sign or other identification . * Last October , a list circulated with 21 names of people who were threatened with death if they did not abandon the country within 72 hours . Tuyuc headed the list . But the threat -- not the first she ' s received -- barely got a rise out of Tuyuc . &quot; The threats are innumerable , &quot; she said casually . Then she added : &quot; It is a despicable way to try to make us feel terrorized . They are trying to get us to stop making complaints and to stop our work . They will not succeed. &quot; The &quot; they &quot; is not articulated . But the Guatemalan army makes no secret about its opinions of Tuyuc and her followers . As far as the military and the right are concerned , Tuyuc is a leftist front for the guerrillas who have been fighting a civil_war with Guatemalan governments for more_than 30 years . &quot; That is the way they try to destroy us , &quot; Tuyuc said when asked about the labels she is given by her enemies . &quot; First we are communists , then we are terrorists. &quot; She denies ties to the guerrillas , although she and they clearly share some of the same positions , especially with_regard_to indigenous rights . Up to 60 % of Guatemala ' s nearly 10 million people are descendants of the ancient Mayas , yet deeply entrenched racism has denied Indians very much political power . The war has claimed 100 # 000 lives , with some 40 # 000 people missing . Most of the dead and vanished are Indians . A native speaker of Kakchiquel , one of the more_than 20 Mayan dialects used in Guatemala , Tuyuc last year focused_on two principal issues : forced military recruitment and the so-called Civilian Self-Defense Patrols , paramilitary_organizations formed by the army to control villages and implicated over the years in serious human_rights abuses . The Guatemalan army has routinely pressed young Indian men into military_service , often snatching them from their villages or rounding them up after church , at school or during festivals . White and Ladino ( non-Indian ) youth are rarely touched . Consequently , Tuyuc argues , military_service is ultimately used to dilute the Indian culture . &quot; The sons of the farm owners , the sons of the middle-class , they are not forcibly pressed into service , &quot; Tuyuc said . &quot; Only our sons are obligated . . . It is an affront to the very culture of our people . It plants terror from one ' s early youth , it prepares them for violence . They lose their cultural identity. &quot; Rather than call_for military_service to be eliminated , Tuyuc and her organization have proposed an alternative plan . Service would be voluntary , young_men would be allowed to serve nearer to their homes and villages , and those who are conscientious_objectors would be allowed to perform community service instead . Tuyuc led a march_on Congress last August , and Enrique Guillen Funes -- one of only six indigenous Congress members -- agreed to sponsor a bill incorporating the reforms Tuyuc proposed . But since then , the bill has languished . * The army denies its recruitment policies are racist . Most of the officers corps is white or Ladino , while the vast majority of the troops are indigenous . Tuyuc is also challenging the continued use of the self-defense patrols , whose abysmal human_rights records have led to calls they be disbanded . When he was human_rights ombudsman , a position he held until last June , De Leon agreed that the patrols should be eliminated ; now , as president and dependent_on the military , De Leon has backed_away from that belief . Given his work in human_rights , the De Leon presidency raised expectations among many Guatemalans . But it &quot; has been a fairly large disappointment , &quot; Tuyuc said . As with the military recruitment , Tuyuc said she is looking_for a compromise on the self-defense patrols issue . Rather than eliminate the patrols immediately , she is asking that some of the more notorious ones simply be disarmed . In many ways , Tuyuc is grappling with the same questions of direction and strategy that face the indigenous movement as_a_whole . Some organizations are beginning to believe they must move_into the mainstream , join established political_parties and adopt less radical tactics to achieve their goals . Others believe militant tactics are still necessary to be heard . Tuyuc came under much criticism , even from supporters , when she led a takeover of the headquarters of the Organization of American_States late last year . Her goal was to force the issue of the self-defense patrols , but her decision to invade a diplomatic post was controversial . &quot; They are the conscience of the people . . . but some of their measures are now seen as unnecessary , &quot; said political analyst Gabriel Aguilera . &quot; It is true that you have to be aggressive to be heard . . . but it has its limit . What good is it if you don ' t achieve things ? &quot; Tuyuc does not consider the OAS takeover a mistake , although she concedes that it did not accomplish anything very concrete . &quot; Maybe we did not get a meeting with the government , but at least we got the subject ( of the patrols ) to be discussed , &quot; she said . &quot; It has been a subject that has been silenced , but now it is gaining force in the community. &quot; Will the widows committee enter formal politics , form a party and run candidates in future elections ? Tuyuc said no , for now , and denies widespread speculation that she would run_for legislative office in elections that may take_place later this year . * A native of the highlands town of Chimaltenango , Tuyuc formed the widows organization in 1988 , starting , she said , with about 1 # 000 women . Today the group counts 13 # 000 members . Like many Indian children , Tuyuc began working in the homes of Ladinos when she was about six . She cared_for the babies of the Ladino women , but unlike many Indian children she was able to study , learn Spanish and eventually go_to school . First Tuyuc lost her father , who was kidnaped by the army in 1982 . She and her husband moved to Guatemala_City in 1985 to escape the military_campaigns through the countryside . In May of that year , her husband disappeared . &quot; I never knew anything more of him , &quot; she said . &quot; One day some men arrived and told me he was alive at a military base , and what I had to do was accompany them and I would see him . But because of the lies we were told all_the time , I knew not to go_with them . It would be the end of me . And that ' s the only time I ever heard anything about him. &quot; Tuyuc , who had two children with her first husband , recently remarried and has a 6-month-old baby with her current husband . * Tuyuc admires and closely follows Menchu , whose worldwide campaign for indigenous rights won her the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize . Pictures of Menchu are plastered all_over Tuyuc ' s office . It was the widows organization that championed the candidacy of Menchu for the Nobel . &quot; Rigoberta has been a symbol for all_of us who fight in the resistance , &quot; Tuyuc said in admiration . &quot; She is the voice of the oppressed . The work she has done opens_doors at levels we could not have achieved. &quot; But Menchu , who lost much of her family to the Guatemalan military , spent most of the past decade in exile . Thus it has been up_to Tuyuc and activists like her to fight the battles at_home . &quot; Rosalina is my Nobel laureate , &quot; said Fernando Lopez , head of the human_rights office of the Roman_Catholic archdiocese . &quot; The presence , the fighting spirit , the charisma that she has within Guatemala is much greater than Rigoberta ' s . Rigoberta comes here for visits , Rosalina shows her face. &quot; Biography Name : Rosalina Tuyuc Title : Founder and head , Guatemalan National Widows Coordinator .
