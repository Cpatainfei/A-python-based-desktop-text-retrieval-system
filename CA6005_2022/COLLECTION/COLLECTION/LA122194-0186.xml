   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : YIELD SHOPPERS : LOOK TO MUNIS IF GOING ' LONG '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An unfortunate confluence of events in the tax-exempt municipal_bond market is making_for exceptional bargains among longer-term issues -- where yields in_effect are in the double-digit range for high tax_bracket investors . Muni investors who favor shorter-term bonds , however , will find that yields on those issues are downright lousy right now . In fact , taxable U.S. Treasury_notes look_like a far better buy for investors otherwise inclined to buy shorter-term munis . The end of the year is usually a time when sharp investors hunt for muni bond bargains , because sellers often dominate the market through Dec . 31 . Then , historically , the muni market rallies in January , sending yields down and bond prices up . The year-end selling pressure typically arises as individual investors ( who dominate the muni market ) clean_up their portfolios for tax reasons . In years when bond prices decline -- as they have this year -- many investors do bond &quot; swaps , &quot; selling depressed issues to get a tax loss , then using the proceeds to buy another bond or bond-like investment that pays an even higher yield . Institutional muni investors , such_as mutual_funds , also rearrange their portfolios at the end of the year , selling bonds and boosting &quot; cash &quot; levels so that they ' re prepared_for potential redemptions by shareholders . Once January arrives , however , the muni market often sees the selling dry_up . Meanwhile , semi-annual interest payments received on outstanding muni bonds as of Jan . 1 create billions of dollars looking_for a home -- and many of those dollars wind_up being reinvested in the muni market , sparking a rally . But this year , some bond pros are dubious about a January rally in the muni market overall . One big negative is the continuing fallout from the Orange County bankruptcy debacle , which has made investors wary of other potential credit-related problems lurking among muni issuers . Indeed , on Tuesday bond-rating agency Fitch Investors Service downgraded Washington D.C. ' s general obligation bonds to BBB-plus from A-minus , citing the city ' s deteriorating finances . * The bidding war between the White_House and Congress over a federal income tax-cut bill also is causing some investors to step back from the muni market , experts say . The reason : Lower federal tax_rates would remove some of the incentive to seek the tax-exempt income paid by muni bonds . Finally , expectations of further interest_rate increases by the Federal_Reserve_Board in 1995 make many investors leery of locking money up in any type of long-term bond . So what demand there is for muni issues is concentrated in shorter-term bonds , generally those maturing in less than five years , bond pros say . But as a result of all_of this , muni experts say long-term muni bonds are going begging for buyers -- and are offering yields that should be high enough to compensate for all_of the inherent risks . The Bond Buyer index of 40 high-quality long-term muni bonds now sports an average yield of 6.94 % , tax-free . That is the same as a 10 % taxable yield -- such_as on a Treasury_bond -- for investors in the 31 % marginal federal tax_bracket ( which begins at taxable income of $ 94 # 250 in 1995 for marrieds filing jointly ) . * As most yield-savvy investors know , you simply can ' t find 10 % taxable yields today except on high-risk corporate &quot; junk &quot; bonds . And the highest yield you can find on U.S. Treasury issues is 7.84 % on 30-year bonds . Which suggests that anyone interested in locking_in long-term yields at this point ought to be looking_to muni bonds , not Treasuries . The opposite is true if you ' re shopping for shorter-term bonds . Example : The average yield on AAA-rated general obligation muni bonds maturing in three years is about 5.2 % , according to yield-tracker Municipal Market Data . For a married_couple in the 31 % tax_bracket , that ' s equivalent_to a 7.5 % taxable yield . But given that three-year U.S. Treasury_notes themselves now yield 7.7 % , they ' re obviously a better buy than munis . To express the differences in the muni and Treasury market another way , consider the &quot; spread &quot; between two-year and 30-year yields in each market : * Top-rated two-year muni general obligation bond yields average about 4.9 % , while the Bond Buyer index of long-term muni issues now is 6.94 % . So the incentive for &quot; going long &quot; in munis is two full percentage_points . * In contrast , 30-year Treasury_bonds , at 7.84 % , pay just 0.29-point more_than two-year T-notes , which yield 7.55 % . Many investors may rationally balk at buying long-term bonds of any kind , of course . If long-term yields surge again in 1995 , bond prices will plummet . Still , buy-and-hold investors who are shopping for the best yields should definitely give long-term munis ( or long-term muni mutual_funds ) a close look , many pros say . A 10 % annualized return is nothing to sneeze at . On the other hand , if you ' re inclined to play it safe by staying in shorter-term bonds , Treasuries are a more lucrative investment than munis today . * O.C.
