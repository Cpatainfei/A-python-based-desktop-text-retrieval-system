   <HEADLINE> LOCAL FIRMS SAY IF CHINA LOSES , THEY DO TOO ; TARIFFS : MANUFACTURERS WARN OF ' MAD DASH ' OUT OF ASIAN_NATION AND HEAVY TOLL ON BUSINESSES IF THE U.S. REVOKES CHINA ' S MOST-FAVORED-NATION TRADE STATUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Robert Solomon , fresh back from a trip to China , where he was checking on orders of Flintstone plush toys , has one word to describe what effect China ' s loss of the most-favored-nation trade status would have_on his company : horrific . Solomon is chairman of Dakin Inc. , a Woodland Hills marketer of plush toys . At least half of Dakin ' s stuffed animals and other toys are manufactured in China . So if that country ' s MFN status were annulled , as the Clinton_Administration has threatened because of China ' s human_rights record , Solomon would have big cost increases because tariffs on the Chinese-made toys would go_up by at least 10 % . Currently , China ' s MFN trading status allows it to export products to the United States under normal , low tariffs . But China ' s MFN status must be renewed annually , and President Clinton has told the Chinese that MFN , which expires in June , will not be continued unless Beijing makes substantial progress in human_rights . Without favored-nation trading status , duties on Chinese-made goods would increase from an average of 8 % to about 40 % . &quot; If MFN were revoked , I would not be out of business , &quot; Solomon said . But he said he would have to pull_out of China , where he contracts with a dozen factories that were built by Hong Kong investors , and shift production to other Asian_countries such_as Thailand , Indonesia and the Philippines . &quot; That would be chaotic because we would n ' t be the only ones doing_it , &quot; said Solomon , whose private company grossed about $ 75 million in sales last year . &quot; There would be a mad dash out of China &quot; by everyone in the toy_industry looking_for other low-cost manufacturing sites in Asia . Dakin is one of many toy , shoe and apparel companies based in the region and across the country that expect to be hit hard if China ' s MFN status is withdrawn . U . S.-China trade last year totaled $ 39 billion , with China buying $ 9 billion in U . S . products , mostly aircraft and telecommunications_equipment , and the United States taking_in almost $ 30 billion in Chinese exports , much of them toys , shoes and apparel . While considered unlikely , the possibility that favored-nation status could be withdrawn this summer has fueled plenty of concern and anger . &quot; I have a very , very strong personal opinion on it , &quot; said Steven Nichols , the soft-spoken chairman of K-Swiss Inc. , a Chatsworth marketer of sneakers . &quot; If you really want to attack communism , you do_it with free_enterprise , and that means free_trade , &quot; he said , his voice rising . &quot; I don ' t want to defend China , but we ' re out of our mind not to do business with them every day. &quot; K-Swiss gets_about 1 million pairs of shoes , or about 15 % of its annual total , from a 75 # 000-square-foot factory in the countryside along China ' s southeast coast . U . S . tariffs on those shoes average about 10 % , but Nichols said they would jump to 20 % or more if China lost its MFN status . Workers in Chinese shoe factories generally make about $ 60 a month . Without MFN , &quot; we could not operate there and send shoes to the U . S. , &quot; Nichols said . &quot; It ' s difficult enough to compete with Reebok , &quot; he said , adding that giant U . S . shoe companies such_as Reebok and Nike have a greater share of their products made in China than K-Swiss , and are very likely to lead an exodus out of China if its MFN is not renewed . K-Swiss , which does about $ 150 million in annual sales , also buys shoes in Indonesia , Malaysia and the Philippines . &quot; There is more capacity there , &quot; Nichols said . &quot; But if China closed_down , they would know they could get a premium . . . . In the short term , there might be less shoes available and the price would go_up &quot; for retailers and consumers . Like many other U . S . footwear companies , K-Swiss has relied more on China in recent years because of wage increases in countries such_as Korea . Besides lower wages , China ' s shoe factories , which are owned largely by Taiwanese businessmen , have a reputation for high productivity and quality , said Peter Mangione , president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America , a trade group in Washington . &quot; We ' re anxious about it , &quot; Mangione said of U . S.-China trade relations , adding that &quot; there are some wild cards in the deck , &quot; most notably how China reacts to the precarious situation in the Korean_peninsula . &quot; Politics is an inexact science ; we don ' t know what will happen. &quot; One of Mangione ' s 70 members concerned is Cherokee Shoe of Thousand Oaks , which makes one-third of its athletic and casual footwear in China . Cherokee Shoe , a unit of the Sunland-based apparel firm Cherokee Inc. , does about $ 30 million in annual sales . &quot; I don ' t know what human_rights has to do with controlling one ' s economy , &quot; said John Lovely , executive_vice_president of Cherokee Shoe , which has been struggling enough with the recession . &quot; We ' re assuming this is not going_to happen , &quot; he said of China ' s possible change in status . But if it does , &quot; it will be costly to us. &quot; William Mow , founder and chairman of the apparel firm Bugle Boy , in Simi Valley , said he has not taken steps to prepare_for China ' s loss of MFN status . Mow considers it unlikely to happen because of the importance of the rapidly growing Chinese market to the United States . Currently , Mow relies_on China for 22 % of his company ' s production , which translates into 10 million shirts and pants made in China . Mow , whose family fled communist_China when he was 13 , contracts with factories in 26 Chinese cities , including Shanghai . Mow says he has to have production spread throughout China because there are U . S . quota limits for goods made in China , which in turn allocates that quota on a city-by-city basis . If China loses its MFN , some of the duties will be 100 % , Mow said in an interview . &quot; We would definitely have to terminate our business there , &quot; said Mow , who owns 90 % of Bugle Boy , which last year had sales of about $ 440 million . Mow says Bugle Boy produces clothes in a dozen other countries . But those countries also have U . S . quota limits , and some of them are running at capacity . &quot; It would take us two years to allocate the Chinese production. &quot; Mow worries that revoking China ' s favored-nation trading status could cost the United States its share of the potentially biggest market in the world . &quot; I hope we all come_to our sanity , &quot; he said . &quot; We should be courting them rather than dictating to them . We Americans cannot afford to dictate. &quot;</TEXT>
