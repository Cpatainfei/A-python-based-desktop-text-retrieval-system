   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; NUCLEAR TUSSLE RAISES THE STAKES IN KOREAN WAITING_GAME ; WASHINGTON EXPECTS NORTH_KOREA TO COLLAPSE WHEN LEADER KIM DIES . MEANWHILE , IT TRIES TO AVOID PROVOKING THE NORTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Army Capt . Kevin C . Warren gestures toward the North_Korean outpost on the next ridge and muses how he has become part of a test of wills that has gone_on for almost 41 years . Little has changed here since July , 1953 , when North and South_Korea signed a fragile armistice . North_Korea still is run as a Stalinist regime . Its troops stand_guard grimly at the border . Tensions are high . &quot; It ' s basically a waiting game , &quot; Warren concedes . This year , however , the contest has taken_on a new urgency as the Clinton_Administration , moving to block the Pyongyang government ' s bid to build a nuclear arsenal , has rekindled some of the passion in North_Korea ' s defiance of the West . The waiting game has intensified as the United States and South_Korea try to nudge Pyongyang into halting its nuclear_weapons program without setting_off a backlash that might spur North_Korea into military_action . For the immediate term , the United States is patiently trying to coax the North_Koreans into allowing international inspection of all their nuclear facilities by late summer , in time to determine whether one of the last redoubts of communism is going_to reprocess more of its spent plutonium into material for nuclear_weapons . Over the long_haul , Washington is waiting for death to come_to Kim Il Sung -- the 82-year-old North_Korean dictator , known to his countrymen as the Great Leader , who has been the country ' s unchallenged power since before the 1953 Korean_War armistice . U.S. analysts believe that , with no clear successor in_sight , the Pyongyang regime is likely to collapse after Kim dies and that the country will be absorbed by South_Korea , much as East_Germany was taken_in by West Germany . &quot; Once he goes , I ' d give things about six months before the ( Korean ) Peninsula is reunified , &quot; one well-placed U.S. official says . &quot; The question is , what happens in between ? &quot; For the interim , the Administration , under pressure from a nervous South_Korea to be patient and not provoke Kim unnecessarily , has settled into a 1990s waiting game more subtle than the one that began in the 1950s . On the diplomatic front , Washington is retreating from the hard-line stance that it took_in March when it threatened North_Korea with everything from economic sanctions to a possible preemptive military strike to prod it to comply with international inspection of its nuclear facilities . After conferring_with South_Korean leaders late last month , U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry sounded a more conciliatory tone , even putting_off a controversial decision on whether to hold the annual U.S.-South Korean military games . Pyongyang had railed that it would regard resumption of the &quot; Team_Spirit &quot; exercises as an &quot; act of war. &quot; Meanwhile , the Administration has been moving quietly , but determinedly , to provide a long list of equipment designed to help fill worrisome gaps in the military_capabilities of U.S. and South_Korean forces here . Seoul , for example , will bolster its current arsenal with sophisticated artillery-locating radar , precision-guided antitank weapons , improved communications_equipment and more night-vision goggles . And last month , the first shipment of 48 Patriot air-defense missile launchers and Apache attack helicopters , which Washington has deployed to help strengthen American defenses here , arrived in the southern port of Pusan . The batteries became operational this week . There also has been a noticeable cooling in the rhetoric south of the DMZ . Only a_few weeks ago , for example , Perry had warned that the United States would do whatever it took_to halt Pyongyang ' s nuclear program . But more recently , he has pledged that &quot; the United States will not initiate a war &quot; or even &quot; provoke a war by any rash actions on the peninsula. &quot; &quot; What talk you hear occasionally in the media of war is entirely inappropriate , &quot; he told a news_conference on his trip here . The abrupt switch in U.S. strategy stems from several factors . First , the previous , more-bellicose approach did not work , only prompting Kim to dig his heels in more . Pyongyang vowed that Seoul would become a &quot; sea of flames. &quot; Second , the South_Koreans -- who , after all , would suffer the brunt of the damage if North_Korea ever decided to attack -- had become decidedly nervous about the impact of the U.S. saber-rattling . Seoul clearly wanted a change . The two governments finally saw an opening when Kim himself turned unexpectedly more conciliatory , delivering a rare speech in which he denied any nuclear ambitions and vowed to let inspectors in . Both Perry and his South_Korean counterparts lost no time in praising the address -- albeit warily -- as encouraging . Within a_few hours , the United States softened its approach . Ironically , despite all_the worry in Washington about a possible North_Korean attack , those who confront the North_Koreans here every day essentially agree with Perry ' s assessment that there is no sign yet of imminent war . Warren , whose battalion patrols the 4-kilometer-deep stretch of mountainous land that is the DMZ , says there have been no unusual troop movements recently north of the border . &quot; We ' re not seeing anything different , &quot; he says . &quot; It was kind of tense during last November , when there was all that war talk in the papers . But since then , it ' s died down. &quot; U.S. Air_Force Capt . Pat Lee , who flies an A-10 &quot; Warthog &quot; jet from Osan Air_Base a_few miles from the North_Korean border , says he too has not noticed any unusual troop activity -- on either side of the DMZ . It ' s too early to tell whether the Administration ' s new approach on the nuclear proliferation issue is working . Pyongyang last week rejected the latest Western demand that it allow international inspection to sample spent fuel rods from its big reactor at Yongbyon to see whether North_Korea is reprocessing them to produce plutonium for nuclear_weapons . Han Sung Joo , South_Korea ' s suave foreign_minister , plays the waiting game as deftly as anyone . &quot; I don ' t know of any policy of just waiting for the North_Koreans to collapse , &quot; he asserts at a news_conference . He adds , an instant later : &quot; We have to deal with the situation &quot; as it exists . Defending Two Koreas North_Korea has a larger army than South_Korea and more combat equipment in many categories despite spending less . These charts do not reflect the latest U.S. sales to the South , including antitank weapons and air-defense missile launchers .
