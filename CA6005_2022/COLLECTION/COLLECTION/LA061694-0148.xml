   <HEADLINE> U.S. URGES U.N. TO IMPOSE MILD N . KOREAN CURBS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States proposed to other U.N. Security_Council members Wednesday that the world body impose mild sanctions against North_Korea as the first_step in a punitive campaign that the Communist government insists could lead to war . Speaking with reporters outside the council_chamber , Madeleine Albright , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said the North_Koreans would &quot; pay a heavy price in diplomatic isolation &quot; if they kept defying the International Atomic Energy Agency and refusing full inspection of their nuclear installations . Wednesday ' s draft resolution was far less punishing than measures first advocated by the Clinton_Administration . Because of opposition from China and Japan , the resolution would not impose a trade_embargo on North_Korea . It would postpone a ban on the transfers of money from Koreans living_in Japan to relatives and friends in North_Korea . Instead of a trade_embargo , it would halt North_Korea ' s export and import of arms , end U.N. technical assistance , ban technical and scientific assistance , reduce the number of diplomats at North_Korean embassies around the world and curtail cultural , scientific and educational exchange programs . The resolution will probably not come_to a vote for several weeks and may be altered substantially before then . It would take_effect only 30 days after adoption by the council . None of the sanctions appeared likely to exact a heavy price from the North_Korean economy . The country ' s arms trade , for example , is estimated at only $ 50 million a year . U.N. technical assistance is low -- $ 3 million a year from the U.N. Development Fund for projects such_as agricultural productivity and industrial pollution control , and $ 1 million a year from the U.N. Children ' s Fund for projects including the iodination of salt and promotion of breast-feeding . In drafting the resolution , the Administration sought to relieve pressure from opposite directions . It must persuade China , a longtime ally of North_Korea , not to use its veto on the council to shoot_down the sanctions . The Administration also is seeking to convince South_Korea , Japan and other allies in the region that the resolution would not provoke war . President Clinton said the draft reflects his Administration ' s intention &quot; to be very deliberate , very firm. &quot; &quot; I feel that we are pursuing the proper course at this time , &quot; he told reporters as he met with congressional leaders in the White_House . The Administration decision to seek sanctions in phases came_in_for criticism from some Republicans , who argued that more must be done to prepare_for the possibility of war . &quot; To call_for sanctions at this late stage is almost a joke . . . , &quot; said Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , a consistent critic of Clinton ' s handling of the North_Korea crisis . &quot; Sanctions alone , without the threat of military_force behind them , will not be effective. &quot; But House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia , one of the congressional leaders who met with Clinton , said : &quot; I think he recognizes this is the most dangerous foreign_policy problem he ' s faced so far in his term , and I think on our side there ' s a ' Be cautious , be firm but don ' t rush into anything right this minute ' kind of mood. &quot; The current crisis began when North_Korea refused to let IAEA inspectors examine fuel rods removed from a nuclear_reactor at Yongbyon to determine whether the North_Koreans in 1989 had removed enough plutonium to make a nuclear bomb . When the IAEA condemned this action , North_Korea withdrew from the agency . It remains a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , even though the IAEA monitors compliance with that accord . Albright described the sanctions as &quot; carefully calibrated : . . . The more they break the rules , the tougher the sanctions. &quot; North_Korea presumably could head_off the first phase of sanctions -- the arms embargo , halt in U.N. aid and cut_in diplomatic and cultural relations -- if it cooperated with the IAEA in the grace period , which diplomats said would be 30 days . &quot; If there is further backsliding by North_Korea , &quot; Albright said , &quot; we will tighten the economic noose by cutting_off all financial transactions with Pyongyang. &quot; She did not define what might provoke the further sanctions but there is a fear that North_Korea may decide to withdraw from the non-proliferation treaty . An American official said the draft described the second phase of sanctions , aimed at stopping remittances from Koreans living_in Japan . These sanctions would not be activated without a second Security_Council resolution . If the 15-member body decided later to tighten sanctions even more with a trade_embargo , a third resolution would be necessary . Meantime , former President Jimmy_Carter arrived Wednesday in North_Korea , hoping to help defuse the crisis . At a Pyongyang reception hosted by Foreign Minister Kim Yong Nam , Carter said the United States &quot; is ready to meet you in accomplishing &quot; the goals of friendship and peace , and that progress can be made &quot; as soon as the nuclear issue is resolved clearly and the misunderstandings are removed , &quot; news_agencies reported . Asked about Carter ' s visit , Clinton told reporters he hopes the former President &quot; will get a better sense from them about where they are and that they will understand that we ' re very firm in our position but that there is an alternative path and a very good one for North_Korea , that they don ' t have to become more isolated. &quot; * Times staff writers Michael Ross , Jim Mann and Art Pine contributed to this report .</TEXT>
