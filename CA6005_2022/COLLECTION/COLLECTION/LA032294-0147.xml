   <TEXT> The bad news came at_sea . Navy Capt . Chris Cole and his crew of 350 were returning here last summer when they learned their El Paso , a 24-year-old , steel-and-gray amphibious cargo_ship , was coming_home for good . It will be decommissioned next month , its days of ferrying personnel and equipment to far-off places such_as Somalia gone forever . Cole is lean and tall , almost towering , his bearing ramrod straight . He ' s been a Navy_man for two decades . Despite his military demeanor , he struggled against tears to describe the decision to mothball his beloved ship . &quot; As a naval_officer , I understand it , &quot; he said . &quot; The country wants to cut the military budget . But as a captain of a ship , I can hardly talk_about it . It ' s a wonderful ship . It ' s a wonderful crew . &quot; The ship is metal and paint . But it ' s the crew that brings it to life. &quot; The human toll of military downsizing is clear . Across the nation , many people are learning -- grudgingly -- that a service career may_not be as promising or rewarding and certainly not as lasting as it once was . Gone_with the Cold_War is the job security it provided . Units with illustrious pasts are being disbanded . Promising careers are being cut_short . For those who stay in the service , forced transfers are all too common . &quot; It ' s disappointing , &quot; said Maj . David Deykes , a 43-year-old West_Point graduate and one-time field infantry platoon leader . He has been told that June 30 is his last_day in the Army . &quot; You take it personal at first , &quot; Deykes said . &quot; Everybody does . You try_for a goal and you fail . Suddenly , the Army is not placing any special fidelity and trust in you any more. &quot; Deykes fears for his own future and that of the armed forces . But to some experts , the human toll of downsizing is not all that worrisome . Charles Moskos , a Northwestern University military sociologist , points_out that the Army , which has been saddled with the brunt of the reductions , has already made virtually all_the necessary cuts and is &quot; out of the woods. &quot; The Navy and Air_Force , he said , did not face such drastic changes . &quot; Sure , there ' s been a lot of heartbreak , &quot; he said , &quot; but institutionally ( the reduction ) has been a remarkable success . If civilian industry had to cut this far , there would have been blood all_over the floor. &quot; &quot; A lot of the uneasiness is because of the wild stories that are circulating about the cutbacks , &quot; said Lawrence J . Korb , a former Defense_Department manpower official now at the Brookings Institution . &quot; It ' s scared_away some of the kids. &quot; He blames the Pentagon for letting rumors of mass firings , though largely false , go unchallenged . Whether real or imagined , the so-called drawdown has troubled and confused many and even left some feeling betrayed . For eight years , Lt . Pat Dennison devoted his career to the Navy , working aboard the aircraft_carrier fleet and seeing duty in the Persian_Gulf . All he wanted to do was go_to sea . But once he realized that ships were being dry-docked , he was retrained in public affairs . Now 30 years old and at the midpoint of the 20 years ' service needed to earn his retirement , Dennison wonders if he ' ll make_it to the end . &quot; These ship cutbacks are scaring me , &quot; he said . &quot; Getting promoted has become too competitive . Career enhancement isn ' t there . A lot of my friends were giving_up and getting_out . &quot; The future isn ' t there for so many of us. &quot; Two rounds of base closings have devastated dozens of defense installations nationwide . And commanders spared so far are having to justify why their posts should not be shuttered in a third round set for 1995 . Total uniformed personnel , nearly 1.8 million at the end of 1992 , is heading for 1.5 million by the end of next year . Soldiers are returning by the tens of thousands from attractive Army posts in Europe . More_than 100 Navy ships have been decommissioned , many of them mothballed at East Coast shipyards-turned-graveyards . Some are broken_down into spare_parts ; others sold to foreign governments . Stealthy , slender &quot; nuclear attack_submarines &quot; that once spied on Russian subs are serving as escorts for naval_battle groups or as floating museums for cadets at Annapolis , Md . The Strategic Air Command , once the Air_Force ' s &quot; first alert &quot; nuclear defense , closed two years ago , costing 3 # 000 military jobs in Omaha . All four military_services are drastically slashing the numbers of new recruits . Even still , the Army and Air_Force have had to jettison thousands of personnel , mainly by attrition and special retirement incentives . The Navy and Marine Corps so far have not had to let anyone go , but they are requiring all first-term enlistees to compete for a second tour_of_duty . The Navy Training Center in San Diego , where 25 # 000 recruits used to go_through boot camp each year , closed_in November . &quot; They made the Navy sound bigger than it really is , &quot; said Brian Beltz , a 19-year-old from Findlay , Ohio , and a member of the last boot camp class there . &quot; They made_it sound like the President was coming_to our graduation and everything , and he didn ' t . They built our hopes up. &quot; Unlike drawdowns following World_War_II and the Korean and Vietnam_wars , this one seems particularly painful to the rank-and-file trying to make a living in uniform . In the past , the Pentagon has simply cut from the bottom , said Carl Cocke , head of research and analysis at the Center for Military History in Washington . The draftees were the first to leave , almost always by their own decision . This time , it is the career soldiers and sailors who feel they are caught in the greatest swath of personnel cuts . There are fewer jobs , fewer promotions . &quot; The one dark cloud on the horizon in recruiting is we have substantial statistics which indicate a decrease in the propensity to enlist , &quot; Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said recently . &quot; Many young people believe the Army is no longer recruiting , no longer bringing new people into it in the face of the drawdown. &quot; At the San Diego boot camp , it is clear that the Navy is not what it used to be . All but three of the center ' s 80 buildings are closed , the furniture and equipment moved_out . The staff has been cut from 500 to 40 , and the rest are ticketed for departure soon . &quot; When we found_out about this , it was utter disbelief , &quot; said Capt . Patricia M . Spishock , the assistant chief_of_staff . &quot; It was like going_through a denial process. &quot; In Northern California near Monterey , there is -- or was -- Ft . Ord . Once bustling with 35 # 000 service members and dependents , the historic Army post is down to 1 # 000 and targeted to drop to 500 by the end of this month . Gone too is the 7th Infantry Division , which saw action in both world_wars , Korea and Panama . One of its last missions was to help restore calm during the 1992 Los Angeles riots . The 7th is one of four Army divisions that are being eliminated . Soldiers still left at Ft . Ord are turning_to new assignments or preparing_for new lives out of the military . Jon Hatemi , 23 , an infantryman , has decided to take_on one more enlistment , this time as a military_policeman , before returning home to Inglewood . After that , he said , &quot; it ' s time to move onto bigger and better things. &quot; Staff Sgt . Betty Ramos , 33 , has spent 10 years as an Army chaplain and goes from Ft . Ord to Ft . Monroe , Va . &quot; It ' s early mornings and late evenings and it could go_into nights , &quot; Ramos said of her job . &quot; They ' re drawing down and it ' s getting competitive , but I think I can hold my own. &quot; Capt . Bryan Cox is leaving . Thirty-four years old , with nine years ' service , he is taking a $ 60 # 000 severance bonus under the Army ' s volunteer separation program . He plans to open a commercial golfing range . Cox , who has four sons , didn ' t feel he could pass_up the bonus money . &quot; I wanted the cash_in_hand , &quot; he said . And as Ft . Ord closes , those at the Monterey County veterans center are feeling the pinch as well . With the post ' s closing , there go the local health and medical_care facilities . For them , it means a day ' s bus ride to the Bay Area for treatment at the closest military_installation . &quot; If I could have seen what the military was doing today , I would have gone somewhere else , &quot; said Joe DeWitt , a 20-year Army soldier before he retired in 1977 . At Norfolk , where the sailors from the El Paso are living_on a berthing barge and emptying their ship , the future remains uncertain . Some , like Petty_Officer Larry Brock with 24 years ' service , are retiring sooner than they would have liked . With the ship ' s decommissioning , he said , he cannot expect to win another promotion . &quot; I promised my wife not to get_out unless I was forced_out , and here I ' m being forced_out anyway , &quot; Brock said . Others like Seaman Sal DeFazio , with only two years ' service , are being transferred for new training . He ' s hopeful there ' s a future when he ' s done . &quot; My only fear is that they ' re going to cut_down too_much , &quot; he said . Adm . Henry H . Mauz Jr. , commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet , sympathizes with their uncertainty . &quot; They ' re concerned about the future , &quot; Mauz said . &quot; Will there be a Navy ? What will it be ? I tell them to have hope. &quot; Aboard the Gunston Hall , the 325-man crew takes_pride in its re-enlistment rate . They like to call their ship the &quot; Gunston Hilton. &quot; But many feel the pressure to compete against each other for promotions . Lt . Cmdr . Chris Chace , the ship ' s executive_officer , recalled how one sailor was sent to an admiral ' s mast for punishment for a minor infraction -- a short absence from duty -- that cost him any real chance to promote later . &quot; That was it for him , &quot; Chace said . Master Chief Rick Yarbrough thanks the Navy for helping him mature when he enlisted as a troubled youth . &quot; And the Navy did a lot for me . It gave me a life , gave me a career . Now I ' m ready to go out. &quot; His retirement from the ship ' s signal corps will come soon , and already he ' s worried that the skills he has learned will not help him in the civilian world . &quot; There ' s not a lot of jobs out there for a signalman , &quot; he said . Across the base , classes are doubling at the Transaction Assistance Program . Begun four years ago to help sailors ease back into civilian life , the program first offered a dozen sessions a year , with about 75 in each class . That number has climbed to 24 sessions a year , with class sizes of 150 or more . Jeannie Keith , 20 , from Bowling_Green , Ky. , is leaving after just two years , upset that her classification as a machinist mate prevents her from switching to nursing . The Navy health_care slots , she found , are overstaffed , while machinist mate positions are understaffed . So she ' s stuck . She started to talk_about her predicament , and then began to cry . She said it wasn ' t fair to have to quit the Navy to better herself . &quot; I have to leave to get_ahead , &quot; she said . Those same kinds of pressures are being felt in the Pentagon . Col . William Foster , an Army war planner , helped devise the strategy of closing posts in Europe and reassigning soldiers throughout the United States . In the 1990s , Foster said , the military is finding itself undertaking a wide array of responsibilities , such_as drug interdiction and peacekeeping , and many servicemen and women are being deployed more often and to more hot spots . &quot; It causes turbulence and uncertainty , &quot; he acknowledged . &quot; They are being asked to deploy more_than before . Your time away from your home station is increased . There ' s a certain perception that the stress is higher . But there ' s also the old adage that a busy soldier is a happy soldier. &quot; Even those with plum assignments are not feeling all that comfortable . When the old weather tracking operation was closed recently at McClellan Air_Force Base in Sacramento , less than a fourth of the 200 crew_members was chosen for a more ambitious program : flying the Open Skies reconnaissance missions over the Soviet_Union and two_dozen other countries . Most of the weather pilots passed_over for the Open Skies mission at Offutt Air_Force Base in Omaha were given less exciting assignments . Some retired . Some took desk jobs . But even the 43 lucky ones who were selected still do not see it as a firm sign of job security . &quot; Sometimes , &quot; said Capt . Curt Lindskog , a pilot with nearly 20 years in the Air_Force , &quot; the ax falls indiscriminately. &quot;</TEXT>
