   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; AN EYESORE IS TRANSFORMED INTO NET ASSET ; SPORTS : PRIVATE DONATIONS -- NONE FROM WORLD CUP -- TURN TRASHY LOT INTO SOCCER FIELD . ACTIVISTS SAY MONEY FROM INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT HAS NOT REACHED THEIR AREAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , the debris-strewn lot along 3rd Street just west of Downtown has been the haunt of drug dealers and prostitutes , a sinister place avoided by wary neighborhood parents strolling with their children . &quot; It was a dump , &quot; said Gustavo Salazar , a resident of nearby Pico-Union , the densely populated and park-starved heart of Los Angeles ' huge Central_American immigrant community . Almost half the area ' s population is younger than 18 . Green space is rare and graffiti-splashed walls are prevalent . The rate of poverty is almost double the citywide average . Kids play soccer -- the principal sport in this Latino immigrant enclave -- on streets and sidewalks . On Friday , though , the 3rd Street lot was the site of a dramatic transformation : Hundreds of youths kicked soccer_balls on a manicured , newly seeded soccer field where homeless people ' s shanties once stood . Guiding them were veteran community coaches like Fernando Bautista , still stunned that a longtime eyesore would now be available for his teams . &quot; This is such a pleasure , &quot; said Bautista , who has dedicated much of his life to shuttling area kids throughout the city , looking_for often-elusive fields to play soccer on . Inevitably , baseball , softball and U.S. football take precedence on limited park space . &quot; We need two or three more of these fields , &quot; Bautista said . Private donations from more_than 50 organizations , including the Los Angeles Times , financed the new site , dubbed the &quot; Field of Dreams. &quot; Administering activities is the Stuart M . Ketchum Downtown YMCA , whose officials negotiated a long-term lease with the landowner , Cathay City Development , part of a Hong Kong concern . The park is temporary , pending development of the site -- something that is not expected for more_than 10 years . * By then , said Councilman Mike Hernandez , who represents the district and pushed for the new park , the hope is that comparable soccer fields will have been created nearby . The field ' s inauguration was timed to coincide with the World Cup , though no World Cup money was used in the project . With the monthlong soccer celebrations about to conclude , many community activists are bemoaning what they call the lack of Cup proceeds directed to seeding fields and related efforts citywide -- particularly in urban zones with swelling populations of soccer-crazed new immigrants . &quot; This was a huge , huge lost opportunity , &quot; said Madeline Janis-Aparicio , who heads the Tourism Industry Development Council , a nonprofit group that seeks to link tourism to inner-city economic development . With considerable fanfare , World Cup organizers had vowed to leave a legacy in Los Angeles and other host cities . Now , as Sunday ' s final game concludes World Cup ' 94 , Janis-Aparicio and other critics say they ' ve seen little concrete evidence of benefits from the marketing extravaganza accruing to the soccer enclaves of Los Angeles . &quot; Whatever legacy they ' re talking_about hasn ' t touched the Latino neighborhoods , &quot; said Oscar Andrade , executive_director of El Rescate , which works with Central_American refugees in the area . &quot; They haven ' t touched this part of town. &quot; In response , World Cup officials say their promised bequest is_well in place . Organizers cite refurbishments of five fields areawide and installation of four planned artificial-turf practice sites , one already in place at the Nickerson Gardens housing project , along with donations of 500 soccer_balls , 97 uniforms , 500 T-shirts and 12 sets of goals . * The World Cup also donated more_than $ 250 # 000 to the newly created Los Angeles Soccer Foundation , which , officials said , plans to finance field improvements , sponsor clinics and provide equipment , among other activities . &quot; We ' ve exceeded expectations , &quot; said Brad Rothenberg , assistant vice_president of World Cup USA . &quot; I think the impression everyone has is that the World Cup has extremely deep pockets . But we can ' t satisfy everybody . . . . Anything we do is gravy. &quot; Nonetheless , the legacy has not yet been evident to Jess Kimbrell , one of the harried city parks officials who struggle daily to match some of the thousands of club teams in the area with limited numbers of available fields . This spring , authorities made city fields available to World Cup organizers , who conducted soccer clinics and other events . &quot; They were telling us they would leave a legacy , but we didn ' t see it , &quot; said Kimbrell , senior director of municipal sports for the city of Los Angeles . &quot; We haven ' t gotten anything from them . We haven ' t even seen T-shirts. &quot; A lack of fields -- not a paucity of interest -- is often considered the most pressing hurdle facing the development of soccer in Los Angeles . At Belmont High_School , a perennial city soccer power that draws from a large Central_American and Mexican-born student base , players often practice on concrete . &quot; I ' d like to see a little bit of the profit of the World Cup go towards making more fields , &quot; said Nancy Carr-Swaim , a Belmont physical_education teacher who coaches the soccer team . For his part , Mayor Richard J . Riordan complimented the effort of World Cup organizers . &quot; I think the World Cup has been very good , &quot; the mayor said during the inauguration of the 3rd Street park . &quot; The glass was half-empty , now it ' s half-full , and I think they had a lot to do with it. &quot; Many area residents came_out Friday to view firsthand the transformation of the 3rd Street site , which is virtually in the shadow of the glittering high-rises of Los Angeles ' financial district . Though plans to build the field have been in the works for 18 months , a volunteer corps only completed cleanup last weekend , hauling_away remaining refuse . The facility will be staffed six days a week through grants from the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles , which was set_up with profits from the 1984 Olympics . At the site , instructors will offer soccer clinics and youth leagues , along with ongoing education , arts and other programs . Mildred Barrientos , a 26-year-old mother of three and avid soccer fan from Guatemala , examined the shiny new grass and set eyes on hundreds of youngsters cavorting on what was long a dumping ground . &quot; This , &quot; she concluded , &quot; will give the kids something besides gangs and graffiti. &quot;</TEXT>
