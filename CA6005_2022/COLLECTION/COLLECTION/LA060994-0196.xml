   <HEADLINE> NATIVE_AMERICAN CEMETERY EVIDENCE FOUND AT KOLL SITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> New disclosures about human bones unearthed at the Bolsa Chica wetlands have provided evidence that the site was once a Native_American cemetery and raised further questions about proposed development there . The disclosures , which surfaced this week , came as the Orange County Grand_Jury announced it would not pursue an investigation into how the Koll Real_Estate Group , which owns most of the property , has handled the discovery of the bones . The probe was requested by the Huntington Beach City_Council in February after allegations by Native_Americans and others that the Koll group had mishandled the bones , which had been discovered by archeologists . The company plans to build 4 # 286 homes at the site , a controversial development that could be delayed by evidence showing that it was a cemetery . It has been learned that the bones included four intact craniums and the femurs of at least 20 individuals . An archeological map dated March 1 noted some bones were found in graves containing enough skeletal remains to indicate that the bodies were in a fetal position . Nancy Desautels , the archeologist in_charge of the project , said Wednesday that the evidence suggests a prehistoric Native_American cemetery . &quot; More_than one individual means it was planned land use , &quot; she said . &quot; If you find more_than one , obviously they intended it as a plot to inter individuals. &quot; Company officials had previously described the site as containing only scattered &quot; bone fragments &quot; of an unknown number of people . The new information was contained in documents circulated by Samuel H . Dunlap , a former Native_American monitor for the company who said he became disillusioned when the Koll group would not follow his suggestion to expand excavations in anticipation of further finds . Dunlap could not be reached for comment on Wednesday . But Lucy Dunn , the company ' s senior_vice_president , characterized the argument as a dispute over the former monitor ' s request for a 50 % pay increase -- from $ 200 to $ 300 a day . &quot; It appears to be a money issue , not an issue of substance , &quot; she said . Meanwhile , the significance of the discovery was not lost upon the Bolsa Chica Land Trust , which opposes the proposed residential development on the property . Flossie Horgan , spokeswoman for the land trust , said Wednesday that &quot; these are 8 # 000-year-old prehistoric remains we have in our midst . It is not appropriate to build 5 # 000 homes over this ancient site and have this lost to future generations. &quot; Besides the release of new archeological information , there was other news this week as it was learned the grand_jury had declined to investigate the Koll group . &quot; We have determined that this concerns a complex set of problems involving the United States_government , the state of California , the Coastal Commission and the Koll company , &quot; Raymond B . Arballo , chair of the grand_jury ' s environment / transportation committee , wrote in a May 27 letter . &quot; The grand_jury has no jurisdiction over any of these entities , &quot; the letter continued . &quot; The Orange County agencies involved in this matter appear to have acted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. &quot;</TEXT>
