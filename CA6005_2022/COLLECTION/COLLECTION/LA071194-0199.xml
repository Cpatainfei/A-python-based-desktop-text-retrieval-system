   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; SWEDEN ' S BEST SHOT_PUTS ROMANIA OUT ; SOCCER : TENACIOUS BATTLE ENDS IN 2-2 TIE . SWEDEN WINS ON PENALTY KICKS , 5-4 , TO ADVANCE TO SEMIFINAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Soccer has no mercy . Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu said it and who could argue ? The game doesn ' t care who it strings_along and who it uses_up . Soccer gives no thought to expectations or hopes or promises . The game dashes all that . The game always wins , and it is only for one team to survive . Sweden did that Sunday , defeating Romania , 5-4 on penalty kicks after regulation ended in a 1-1 tie and a 30-minute overtime ended 2-2 . It was not a match that either team won so_much as endured , Sweden all_the more as it played a man short for the bulk of the overtime . Sweden was rewarded for its perseverance and advances further than it has since 1958 , when it lost to Brazil in the World Cup championship game . Sweden will play Brazil again , Wednesday at the Rose Bowl , in the semifinal . The teams will reprise their meeting from the first round , which ended in a 1-1 tie . For Romania , too , the echoes resonate : It is the second consecutive World Cup in which the team was ousted on penalty kicks -- the sport ' s cruelest solution . &quot; It was a heart-attack game , &quot; Iordanescu said , and , indeed , his team succumbed . Despite Sweden ' s obvious intention to never stop working , and the fact that Sweden scored first , Romanian players betrayed an arrogance that seemed to indicate that no matter the circumstances the team expected to win . There were high expectations before the game that both teams would offer an attacking , creative show . However , a header by Sweden ' s Martin Dahlin that hit the post in the fourth minute was the sum_total of either team ' s offensive production in the first_half . So unappealing was the play that the crowd of 81 # 715 in Stanford Stadium spent much of the first_half perfecting the wave while Romania incessantly backpassed the ball from its midfield to its defense , until , finally , goalkeeper Florin Prunea gathered the ball and booted it forward . Romania ' s much-vaunted counterattack never materialized as Sweden -- which was reticent to attack -- never offered the opportunity . Romania ' s puzzle : How to counterattack a team that doesn ' t attack ? Sweden had worked_through a puzzle of its own , solving a tenacious Romanian defense . Swedish Coach Tommy Svensson said that during the week ' s closed practices the team drilled on the set play off a free_kick that led to Sweden ' s first goal . It was suggested by Tomas Brolin , who learned it from his Italian club team , Parma . Svensson liked the play and said he ' d remember it . During Sunday ' s game , he reminded Brolin to try it . It worked perfectly because Romania failed to cover its left side on the free_kick . Sweden ' s Stefan Schwarz stood_in front of the ball and pushed it to Hakan Mild . When Mild got the ball , Brolin broke toward the goal , around the wall of Romanian players , took a pass that left him alone against Prunea and scored . That goal in the 79th minute might have been enough if not for Florin Raducioiu . He and Romania ' s other top offensive players , Gheorghe Hagi and Ilie Dumitrescu , had been thwarted by Sweden for most of the game . The trio teamed for Romania ' s tying goal off a free_kick in the 89th minute . Hagi slid the ball to Dumitrescu who gave it back to Hagi . Hagi ' s powerful left-footed shot ricocheted off Sweden ' s wall and Raducioiu picked it up and scored . Raducioiu gave Romania the lead in overtime when the Swedes couldn ' t clear a ball near the top of the box . Raducioiu slammed his shot home_in the 101st minute and Sweden was in_trouble . Romania ' s task should have been to sit on its lead , but to do that it would have been necessary to keep the ball . It didn ' t . Sweden stepped_up its attack and the tireless Brolin appeared to be everywhere on the field , intent_on winning the ball . &quot; When it was 2-1 for us and we had seven or eight more minutes , there were times when the players tried to keep the result as is , and probably exaggerated it , &quot; Iordanescu said . &quot; that ' s why they made a mistake . What I asked_for them in the last minutes of the game was to possess the ball. &quot; Sweden struck quickly . Roland Nilsson lofted a high cross to Kennet Andersson . The 6-foot-4 forward was unchallenged in the penalty area and outjumped Prunea , heading the ball into the net virtually out of the goalkeeper ' s hands . &quot; All of their players just stood there like they were waiting for the goalkeeper to take it , &quot; Andersson . &quot; They just stood there and watched. &quot; What Romania saw was its hopes slipping and the inevitability of the dreaded penalty kick shootout . It is an odd and dramatically different way to end a soccer match . As the players from both teams flopped on the grass to watch , five players from each team were designated to take the kick from the penalty spot , 12 yards from the goalkeeper . Sweden went first and started badly . Mild ' s shot flew over the crossbar . After that , each player , in turn , made his shot until Dan Petrescu ' s shot was parried by Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli . Ravelli allowed himself a pump of his fist and Sweden had remained even at 3-3 . The score was 4-4 after five shots each and , in keeping with the game ' s mood , even the shootout went_into sudden_death . Sweden ' s Henrik Larsson went first and his curling shot hit the back of the net . Solemnly , Miodrag Belodedici walked forward to place the ball on the penalty spot and stepped back to face Ravelli . The Romanian hesitated , then strode forward , striking the ball sharply to the right . Ravelli had guessed as much and his diving save ended the game . Maybe there was mercy on the day . The game was over .</TEXT>
