   <HEADLINE> INDEPENDENT ELECTED MAINE ' S NEXT GOVERNOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Independent candidate Angus King , telegenic former host of a highbrow current affairs program on public broadcasting , emerged from a four-candidate field to narrowly become Maine ' s new governor , winning 36 % of the vote Tuesday . The Independent governors in two other states did not run_for reelection , so King will stand alone as the only state leader who is neither Democrat nor Republican . Catapulted to competitive status by the near-collapse of untested Republican nominee Susan Collins , King targeted front-running Democrat Joseph Brennan as an advocate of stale ideas left over from his previous two terms as chief_executive . Dismissing the Democrat as an echo from the past , King pledged to open_up government to new approaches and bring fresh talent and modern management to the capital . King , who once worked as a Democratic congressional staff aide and considered a U.S. House bid of_his_own as a Democrat in 1986 , withdrew his party enrollment in August , 1993 , to enter the gubernatorial race as an independent . That was nine months after independent Ross Perot finished second -- ahead of summer resident George_Bush -- in the state ' s 1992 presidential balloting . A youthful-looking 50 , King charged state_government with a &quot; gotcha &quot; mentality toward developers and urged adoption of a streamlined permit process . He netted $ 8 million from the sale of an energy management company he founded and provided most of the money for his own campaign .</TEXT>
