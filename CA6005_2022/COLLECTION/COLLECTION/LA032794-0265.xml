   <HEADLINE> DEFIANT KADAFI BACK TO HARD LINE AGAINST WEST ; LIBYA : STUNG BY SANCTIONS , HE WON ' T TURN_OVER LOCKERBIE SUSPECTS . ALSO , HE INVITES MIDEAST PEACE FOES FOR TALKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A German merchant_ship made its way into the harbor of Tripoli not long ago and was boarded by a troop of police who wanted to know if the ship was carrying weapons . Hoping for a laugh , the sea_captain responded with a dirty_joke . But the Libyans weren ' t smiling , and the captain spent a week in jail , released only after the intervention of the German Embassy . A short time earlier , several Europeans living at an expatriate workers camp near the Libyan capital were sentenced to several weeks in prison when their wives placed a large mail_order for poppy_seeds . The women said the poppy_seeds were for baking . The Libyans said they were for merrymaking , perhaps suspecting the seeds would be used as an opiate . Fun isn ' t a marketable commodity in Libya these days . Last month leader Moammar Kadafi imposed Islamic law throughout the country ; one of its dictates makes_it a crime , punishable by imprisonment , to &quot; make rumors or harmful jokes about society or the Koran. &quot; And , in an interview last week here in the homeland of his desert tribe , Kadafi spoke in defiant tones . Reeling under tightened international sanctions that have halted air_travel to and from Libya , slowed delivery of key commodities , forced the country into arrears on its bill payments and sparked a slow exodus of foreign companies , Libya is no longer striking a pose of conciliation with the world . Kadafi , the mercurial Libyan leader who last year was trying to court the West , this year is alarming his Arab neighbors by threatening to set_up a &quot; peaceful Islamic state &quot; in his North African desert country , inviting opponents of the Middle_East peace process for consultations in Tripoli and announcing that he has no intention of handing_over two suspects accused in the 1988 downing of an American jetliner over Lockerbie , Scotland , that killed 270 people . &quot; There are no circumstances whatsoever under which we can turn them over , &quot; Kadafi said in the interview . &quot; Even if there is a war. &quot; Kadafi , who as a young colonel rode the crest of Arab nationalism in 1969 to topple the pro-Western monarchy and establish Libya as one of the West ' s most enduring headaches , hasn ' t mellowed with age . Late last year , Libya hosted a meeting of radical Arab organizations dubbed the &quot; Democratic Arab Revolution , &quot; and Kadafi , who is in his early 50s , said he was considering inviting terrorist leaders Ahmed Jibril and Abu Nidal to Libya . Western intelligence_analysts say at least five terrorist training camps remain operative in Libya , and several years after an international uproar over a purported chemical weapons plant forced Libya to halt production , the German press last month showed photographs of tunnels dug deep into a mountainside at Tarkhounah , south of Tripoli . The reports said German companies were aiding in the construction of a new manufacturing_plant for chemical , and possibly biological , weapons . Libyan officials said the tunnels were being dug for the Great Man-Made River , a huge project for transportation of water from desert aquifers to the coast . Just as worrying , Libyan opposition sources say , they now have eyewitness reports that Libya was behind the disappearance of Mansour Kikhiya , a Libyan opposition leader and human_rights leader who disappeared in Cairo in December while on his way to a meeting with a Kadafi contact . Kikhiya has since been seen alive in Libya , former Libyan Prime_Minister Abdel Hamid Bakoush , now a key figure in the Libyan opposition , said in an interview in Cairo last week . He suggested that Kadafi has returned to the days of terror of the mid-1980s , when the Libyan regime hunted_down its opponents all_over the world . &quot; Kadafi has been calm for the last few years not because he gave_up but because he had other problems to take_care of , and because the international market of terrorism was in recession , &quot; Bakoush said . &quot; He has gone_on television again calling_for the enemies of the revolution to be killed , because imprisoning them is doing them a favor . . . . We see that with these sanctions he has gotten_into a mess , and now he is making the mess worse. &quot; &quot; For several months , he was trying to be nice about ( President ) Clinton and ( British Prime_Minister John ) Major , &quot; said a European diplomat in the Libyan capital , referring to Kadafi ' s charm offensive launched against the leaders last year . &quot; All that has stopped . Now he ' s started shouting again about the Jewish and Christian crusading conspiracy . He ' s become very violent in his speeches . He ' s furious at not being taken seriously , not by the West or even his Arab brothers. &quot; Kadafi , weakened by the international air embargo , a freeze on his assets abroad and a halt on spare_parts supplies for some oil equipment , at the moment does not appear to have the wherewithal to return to the freewheeling days when Libya offered financial and logistic_support for a wide array of international terrorist groups and national liberation movements , from the_Irish Republican Army to the Abu Nidal organization . And in an interview at the modern hotel complex in Sirte , constructed for international conferences , Kadafi repeatedly called_for an end to violence in the Middle_East , although he refused to rule_out further support for violent opponents of the Middle_East peace process . George Habash , head of the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , which has mounted a series of attacks in the Israeli-occupied territories aimed at derailing the peace talks , arrived in the Libyan capital last week for consultations . &quot; If there is a real peace process , we will support it fully , &quot; Kadafi said , sitting quietly in a modern office dressed in the traditional robe of North Africa . &quot; We will wait for the result . If the result brings_about peace , then it is good. &quot; As he spoke , Kadafi sat slumped over slightly in an elegant chair , talking in a low monotone interrupted by occasional sighs . Frequently , his eyes would scan the ceiling as if seeking a way to make the world see the dreamscape on the backside of his eyes . &quot; But you can ' t just talk_about recognizing Israel . Things cannot be put_in that way . Because if you ask one party to recognize Israel , then you have to ask Israel to recognize the other party . When are they going_to recognize Palestine ? Are we seeking peace , or just the recognition of Israel ? If it is just the recognition of Israel you ' re after , then we have to sacrifice peace . This is what has delayed the peace process , and we may never achieve peace in the long term. &quot; The peace process has failed so far , he said , because Israel has focused its efforts on coming_to terms with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat . &quot; Abu Ammar does not represent all_the Palestinians , &quot; he said , using Arafat ' s nickname . &quot; The armed groups and organizations are not part of this process , and so peace is in danger . Abu Ammar ' s organization is not a fighting one . Any agreement with that organization will not end the struggle. &quot; Kadafi defended his ongoing contacts with purported terrorist leaders . &quot; When the_British government agreed to meet with the IRA , does that mean they encouraged them to continue violence ? &quot; he asked , clucking his tongue with irritation . &quot; And when the leaders of the United States received Salman Rushdie , were they encouraging him to attack Islam ? If we do a meeting with these people , it ' s considered evil . Even if I was trying to convince them not to continue fighting , you condemned us in advance. &quot; Kadafi said he has challenged the West to provide evidence that he is still engaging in terrorism , and he raised questions about why the West continues to talk_about Libya and terrorism . &quot; Is it because I posed a threat to you in the past ? &quot; he asked . &quot; What is the basis of these accusations ? If you go_to interview the president of Italy , would you ask him if he is dangerous ? These are wrong accusations . &quot; Is there any terrorist operation that was carried_out by Libya ? I challenge them to provide evidence for even one terrorist act which Libya has committed . . . . These are just colonialist designs on our countries . They would like to subject all_the peoples of the world to surrender and become beggars . This is the difference between me and them , and terrorism is only a cover_for that difference between them and us. &quot; The Libyan leader defended an invitation to Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman , spiritual_leader of an organization that is trying to bring_down the Egyptian government and whose followers were convicted in the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York . He said he has asked the radical preacher to set_up a peaceful Islamic state in Libya . &quot; I still insist on my request that the United States_government should release Omar Abdul Rahman and he should come_to Libya , &quot; he said , &quot; in_order for us to convince him to put an end to the violence in Egypt . . . . &quot; We are against all kinds of violence : that used by the Islamists and the fundamentalists , by the Americans against the Indians . We demand from the Israelis , the fundamentalists and the Americans to put an end to violence . They should be convinced that dialogue is the only way . They should put_away their arms and recognize the existence of each other. &quot; All of this talk may sound as though Kadafi has become a reasonable man . But the pacific overtures have a tinny ring when they come_to the case of Kikhiya , a former foreign_minister and one of the most outspoken critics of the Kadafi regime as well as founder of the Libyan Organization for Human_Rights . Kadafi insists that Kikhiya was kidnaped by the CIA to damage relations between Libya and neighboring Egypt . &quot; We officially accuse you of it as Americans , &quot; he said , grinning cheerfully as he calculated the effect of his words . &quot; American intelligence is responsible_for what happened to Kikhiya . He is a Libyan citizen and the Libyan authorities will follow up the_matter to the end. &quot; Clinton was deceived and manipulated by the CIA when he said in a recent report to Congress that Libya still poses an enormous threat to the United States , Kadafi contended . The Libyan leader and the entourage around him seem to have almost dreamlike hopes about Clinton , the successor to two Republican administrations thoroughly loathed in Tripoli . One Kadafi aide said the Libyans particularly admire Clinton for his avoidance of the draft during the Vietnam_War . At one point , Kadafi , noting his belief that Clinton is the victim of a CIA conspiracy , offered to send an armored car to Washington to protect the President . &quot; Everything that came_in this Clinton report ( about Libya ) , Clinton cannot be responsible_for it , &quot; he said . &quot; It was imposed on Clinton . Clinton is a victim , just like us . He is a victim of the CIA and imperialism , and we ' re concerned about him , that he might face the same destiny as JFK &quot; -- a reference_to President John F . Kennedy , who was assassinated in 1963 . With his country increasingly squeezed_by international sanctions , Kadafi has reason to be worried about himself . According to diplomats in Tripoli , Kadafi uncovered an assassination plot from within the military last October , only a day before his motorcade was to have been attacked in the steel-producing town of Misratah . Although the details are not clear , an uprising began about the same time in the town of Bani Walid , reportedly spurred by a tiff between Kadafi and the powerful tribal leaders in the area and military cadets who , like many other public employees , have gone unpaid for six or seven months . Rumors that Kadafi ' s closest lieutenant , Staff Maj . Abdelsalem Ahmed Jalloud , was behind the coup plot have been fed by reports that Jalloud is under virtual house_arrest . &quot; There was some unrest in the army camps , and at_the_same_time a group of high professional officers , really well-educated people , planned to ambush him , &quot; one diplomat said . &quot; One of the group betrayed them , so they were all picked_up in one day . Most of them were shot. &quot; Four officers have been shown on Libyan television in the last two weeks confessing to being spies for the United States . &quot; There are always rumors . One version has it that 2 # 000 people were rounded up , and 300 were executed , 80 by Kadafi himself , &quot; said one Western envoy in the Libyan capital . Kadafi himself said the four men on television &quot; admitted they were recruited by the CIA &quot; to spy on the Libyan regime . &quot; Now look what America is doing to destroy the world , &quot; he added . &quot; If we did something like that , what would they say about us ? When they do_it , it is legitimate . How can the problems of the world be solved by such a mentality ? They consider the people of the West are human_beings and the people in the East are donkeys. &quot; Although Kadafi said he is adamant about not handing_over the Lockerbie suspects , he repeated past statements that the two men are free to turn themselves in . Most analysts in the Libyan capital believe there are no conditions under which the two men will be released for trial in the United States or Scotland . &quot; I ' m much more pessimistic now than a year ago . Because there is no sign whatsoever that Kadafi is prepared to deliver these two persons , &quot; one European envoy said . Instead , Kadafi appears to be preparing_for a long showdown . With his assets frozen abroad , he worked quickly to transfer overseas funds into accessible accounts before the latest sanctions and has since brought large quantities of cash into the country , in $ 100 bills and treasury_bonds , according to diplomatic sources . Reserves now are said to total a full year ' s oil revenue , or about $ 7 billion . The failure to pay public salaries over a period of several months is driving_out an increasing number of foreign workers but is getting the Libyan populace prepared_for hard_times , with the prospect of a full oil embargo , depriving Libya of virtually all outside revenue , under probable consideration by the United Nations over the summer , these analysts said . &quot; Their policy for the future seems to be to spend as little as possible from their reserves , &quot; said a foreign envoy . &quot; I think they ' re preparing_for a long siege. &quot; Kadafi seems to be taking the long view too . &quot; The struggle of my nation is continuing , &quot; he said with a quiet sigh , staring into space . &quot; It ' s carried_over from one generation to another . And that ' s what we ' re doing . It ' s not a matter of win or lose . The question is , what is the correct thing to do ? To continue to struggle for our right to life. &quot;</TEXT>
