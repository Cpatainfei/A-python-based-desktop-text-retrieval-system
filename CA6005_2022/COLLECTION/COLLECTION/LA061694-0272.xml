   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COVER STORY ; THE ART OF COW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The COW team ' s interactive design style uses a variety of images but little text . The program features a rapid-fire blend of sound , type , graphics and visual_images , including a heavy reliance on film.Below are shots of two of the interactive screens that are part of COW presentations , along with what some are saying about the young designers . * &quot; I think they have an incredible future . They ' ve already separated themselves from the pack . It ' s not just how you present information , but how you give the user a way to navigate through it . They ' ve made_it much easier to navigate. ' Jeannine Parker president of the International Interactive Communications Society * &quot; COW was the one that really impressed us . They break_down the barriers of fear of the technology . Not many companies are doing that . Either they ' re very creative but the stuff doesn ' t flow , or they ' re very technologically oriented but not creative. ' Richard Cassey an associate at SHR Perceptual Management</TEXT>
