   <HEADLINE> BOSNIA ' S SERBS START TO COMPLY WITH ULTIMATUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb forces near Sarajevo held their fire Friday and finally began complying with a Western ultimatum to pull their heavy_weapons outside the city ' s 12-mile exclusion zone , as U.N. and NATO forces began moving to enforce a cease-fire there . After a slow start Thursday , punctuated by at least one violation of the truce , Bosnian Serb militia units were reported slowly moving their artillery away from the outskirts of Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s besieged capital , while Muslims inside Sarajevo turned their heavy_weapons over to U.N. peacekeeping forces . The developments came as the Clinton_Administration , after months of hesitation , began pressing Bosnia ' s Muslim-led government to accept a compromise settlement of the war in the former Yugoslav republic , promising that it will meet the Muslims ' &quot; reasonable requirements. &quot; To help the negotiations succeed , officials warned that they may use military_action against the Bosnian Serbs if they do not cooperate and affirmed that the United States is willing to send as_many as 15 # 000 troops to help carry_out any new agreement . U.S. officials denied that their new approach is designed to pressure the Muslims into accepting a three-way partition of Bosnia . In fact , the Muslims had already agreed to such a division during earlier rounds of negotiations . The pullout by the Bosnian Serb units followed an incident late Thursday in which the first day of the cease-fire was broken by the firing of two artillery shells into the city , accompanied by a barrage of machine-gun fire that witnesses said lasted 10 minutes . However , U.S. officials said Friday that North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization commanders had decided to treat the incident as an aberration . The shelling on Thursday was brief and was believed to be the result of renegade units on both sides seeking to sabotage the truce . Meanwhile , the United States and its NATO partners began deploying 24 additional fighter-bombers and other aircraft to bases in Italy to help enforce the NATO ultimatum . The NATO council on Wednesday threatened the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes unless they withdraw their heavy_weapons from the_hills around Sarajevo or put them under U.N. control by Feb . 21 . The Pentagon said that it was dispatching eight more F-15Es to join the air armada . Bosnian officials welcomed the U.S. negotiating initiative , even though they acknowledged that any settlement that resulted would mean the division of Bosnia into three religious-ethnic areas , something that they long had sought to avoid . &quot; I ' d say we are relieved to see the United States more involved , &quot; said Muhamed Sacirbey , Bosnia ' s U.N. ambassador . &quot; We understand the limitations on our ability to maneuver . . . . At this point , all we are seeking is minimal justice and a viable Bosnian state. &quot; Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff said that the new diplomatic initiative includes a threat of further action against the Bosnian Serbs if they do not cooperate and a U.S. pledge to provide thousands of peacekeeping troops to help implement the plan . At the same time , however , officials said that the Administration , obviously worried about the adverse public reaction it has received over the peacekeeping mission in Somalia , has pared back the number of U.S. troops that it is willing to deploy in Bosnia . Former Defense_Secretary Les Aspin had told U.S. NATO partners last year that the United States was willing to provide about half of the 50 # 000-man force initially estimated . But officials said that President Clinton has now cut that to one-third , calling it &quot; more realistic. &quot; Besides the longer-range F-15E Strike Eagles , the additional air package includes two U.S. AC-130 gunships and two EC-130 electronic_surveillance planes . Officials said that the fighters are equipped with special night-capability radar . The U.S. aircraft will be joined by four F-16 fighters from the_Netherlands , eight F-16s from Turkey and four Jaguar fighters from Britain . Most had been sent to enforce the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over Bosnia but had returned to their bases weeks ago . U.S. Navy Adm . Jeremy M . Boorda , commander of the NATO military operation , said Friday that the deployments will bring the total number of allied fighter-bombers available to enforce the ultimatum to 160 , up from 136 . As the transfer of weapons to the United Nations began , U.N. commanders deployed their peacekeeping forces throughout the city to serve as buffers between Bosnian Serb troops and Muslim residents . Strategists hope that their presence will deter further Serbian attacks . Meanwhile , Clinton and Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin finally spoke by telephone about Bosnia , after being foiled for two days by what officials said Friday were line problems between Moscow and Yeltsin ' s vacation_home . Clinton told reporters after the 30-minute call that &quot; we agreed we had the same long-term objective , which was achieving a just peace agreement , and the same short-term objective , to relieve the shelling of Sarajevo. &quot; But the two men apparently remained far apart on whether further action by the United Nations is needed before the NATO ultimatum can take_effect . The Security_Council had been scheduled to meet Friday to discuss a companion Russian plan but did not do so because of poor weather in New York . In a briefing at the State_Department , officials told reporters thatthe United States hopes to press the Bosnians to come_up with a negotiating proposal focusing_on their bottom-line needs -- a process Clinton has called &quot; getting_to the bedrock , &quot; one aide said . Then , they said , the United States and the European Union will endorse the plan and try to persuade the Bosnian Serbs and Croats to agree to it . Other senior officials said that they expect the Bosnians to come_forward soon with a proposal based on the plan already negotiated by European Union mediator Lord Owen and U.N. envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg . That plan would turn Bosnia into a loose confederation of three areas -- predominantly Serbian , Croatian and Muslim -- and give the Muslims one-third of the republic ' s territory , the Croats 17.5 % and the Serbs 49.1 % . The Muslim-led government has already accepted both of those principles . The Bosnian government -- and the Clinton_Administration -- once hoped to avoid the country ' s partition , but by last fall both had accepted it as inevitable . Two territorial issues remain to be negotiated . One is the Bosnian government ' s demand for an outlet to the Adriatic_Sea at the Croatian port of Neum and access to the Sava River , an important inland shipping_route . A senior State_Department official said several proposals have been made to meet that request . A second issue is the fate of three largely Muslim towns surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces in the eastern part of the country , Srebrenica , Zepa and Gorazde . The Serbs have suggested that the Muslims abandon the towns and trade them for land near Sarajevo . The Bosnian government , pointing_out that Muslims have lived_in the towns for centuries , wants to keep them as safe havens and connect them with road corridors to the rest of their territory . &quot; This has been the hardest issue of all . . . and it may continue to be , &quot; the senior official said . He said that the Administration expects the Bosnians to come_up with a workable proposal soon . He added that U.S. officials have told the Bosnian government in strong terms that it should not hold_out in the belief that it can win more on the battlefield . &quot; The notion of a spring offensive that would roll_up big gains against the Serbs is a chimera , &quot; he said . If the Bosnian Serbs refuse to accept a reasonable proposal , on the other hand , the United States will go_to its allies and propose both military and non-military pressure to bring them around . Such actions could include air strikes against Serbian supply_lines and weapons concentrations , one official said , adding that the Administration has not yet decided to seek such action . Tarnoff and other officials said the Administration would still require that several conditions be met before deploying any American troops in Bosnia -- chief among them that a peace agreement be in place and the first_steps already be taken_to implement it and that the warring factions agree that they want the peacekeepers to come .
