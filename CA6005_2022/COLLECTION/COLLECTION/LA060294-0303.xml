   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; PARTIES AND POSITIONS CAN BLUR IN SLATE MAILERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The official-looking voters ' guide from the California Democratic Alliance may seem as if it came straight to your mailbox from the state Democratic Party . But if so , what is Wilbert Smith , a conservative Republican running_for state superintendent of public instruction , doing on it ? Or Stuart Hirsh , a candidate for judge who faces suspension by the State Bar for multiple acts of misconduct and describes his politics as &quot; just to the right of Genghis Khan &quot; ? Welcome to the world of slate mailers , where , like Alice ' s Wonderland , things are not always what they seem . While critics contend that slate cards are inherently deceptive -- they look_like official endorsements but actually are paid political ads -- millions are being mailed statewide in the final days before Tuesday ' s California primary_election . And this year , with no incumbents running in six of the nine statewide races , the tricky missives are playing a particularly significant role , especially in the &quot; down-ticket &quot; races below those for governor and U.S. senator . Candidates in these contests , as well as in hundreds of local races , rely heavily on slate mailers , which provide a relatively cheap way -- and for some the only way -- to get their names before voters . Their names typically appear next to those of candidates in the big races for governor and U.S. Senate in a format festooned in red , white and blue and bearing icons of donkeys or elephants , depending_on the &quot; endorsing &quot; party . Virtually every major candidate for statewide office below that of governor has bought space on one or more slate cards . Struggling for name recognition , treasurer candidate Phil Angelides and insurance commissioner candidate Burt Margolin have each plunked_down more_than $ 300 # 000 to appear in the &quot; Voters Guide &quot; -- one of the granddaddies of slate cards , which will reach about 2 million Democratic households . And there are the lesser-known mailers , such_as the California Democratic Alliance , produced by political consultant Fred Huebscher , who covers all_the political bases by selling space on slate cards titled &quot; Citizens for Republican Values &quot; and the &quot; Independent Voters League. &quot; Often employing sophisticated technology , the slate card operators target their mailings to carefully defined groups of voters . There are law-and-order cards aimed at senior_citizens , and pro-abortion rights cards aimed at Democratic women . Most slate mailer entrepreneurs boast of the ability to identify and reach &quot; high propensity &quot; voters -- those who year after year show_up at the polls for primaries and special elections . Critics say the people behind the commercial slate cards are callous profit seekers , with no qualms about deceiving voters while selling space to the highest bidder . Often , well-known candidates appear at the top of the card without their knowledge and without paying a dime , just to add luster to the slate . &quot; I have been concerned for a long_time by the deception practiced by the slate mailers , &quot; said Assemblyman Byron D . Sher ( D-Palo Alto ) . Although disclosure requirements have gradually been tightened over the years -- requiring the mailers to say that they are not prepared by official party organizations and to identify which candidates paid_for the mailing with an asterisk -- Sher believes that the current rules are inadequate . Four years ago , a &quot; Democratic &quot; slate card urged votes for Democratic candidates Dianne Feinstein and Kathleen Brown , along with Dan Lungren and Matt Fong . The mailer neglected to mention that Lungren and Fong , who helped pay_for the mailing , are Republicans . Feinstein and Brown , both Democrats , did not pay . The same people who collected $ 219 # 000 this year for slots on &quot; Your Pro-Choice Voter Guide &quot; also collected $ 241 # 000 for &quot; Your Law and Order Voter Guide. &quot; Some political consultants complain of implicit blackmail in the selling of the cards -- the threat that if one candidate or ballot measure committee is unwilling to pay the asked-for price , an opponent could be included instead . The people behind the slate mailers defend their business , saying it differs little from selling newspaper or television ads . Yet the slate cards are different because they imply a thoughtful review of candidates and propositions , even though the decisions are often simply a matter of commerce . One of the pioneers in the business is Democratic political consultant Larry Levine . Two years ago , Levine and his then-partner , Jill Barad , issued a general_election slate card called &quot; Your Ballot Guide. &quot; The version sent to Democrats featured a prominent donkey symbol . It gave space at no cost to national candidates such_as Bill_Clinton and Al Gore . The version sent to Republicans , featuring an elephant logo , omitted Clinton and Gore . But common to both was a prominent endorsement for Deane Dana , a Republican running_for the nonpartisan post of Los Angeles County supervisor , who paid to be there . This year , Levine ' s &quot; Voter Guide &quot; includes Kathleen Brown at no cost as part of a &quot; Democratic Team to Beat Pete Wilson. &quot; State superintendent of public instruction candidate Maureen DiMarco paid $ 42 # 000 to be_on the same card . DiMarco is a Democrat , but hardly_a member of a team to beat Wilson . Rather , she is a member of his Cabinet , as secretary of child development and education . &quot; Most of us in the business have some ideological thread woven through what we ' re doing , &quot; Levine said . &quot; It may get stretched . Sometimes it may be snapped. &quot; The slate cards , he said , probably have little impact on the well-funded major campaigns , such_as those for governor and U.S. Senate . Those campaigns rely_on broadcast advertising and receive abundant coverage in the press , Levine said . It ' s the down-ticket races and the local candidates who depend_on slates . &quot; It ' s an effective means . . . at a low unit_cost . It ' s another form of advertising for candidates asking , ' How many times can I get my message to how many people for a buck ? ' &quot; Not all slate operations are commercial_enterprises . Labor_unions , trade groups and other organizations pick slates of_their_own and distribute them to members -- often at no cost to the candidates . This year , the California Democratic Party decided to send_out a slate card for the primary , creating friction within Democratic ranks because party Chairman Bill Press had been telling candidates that there would be no mailing . &quot; Most of these ( commercial ) consultant slates are purely for-profit , mercenary operations , and the ( group ) behind them has no standing other_than salesmanship , an ability to get candidates to pay , &quot; Press said . &quot; It ' s outrageous . I ' d much rather see one slate put_out by the party and no other slates. &quot; On the official Democratic slate are Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles for secretary_of_state , Assemblyman Rusty Areias of San Jose for controller and state Sen . Art Torres of Los Angeles for insurance commissioner , all candidates in partisan races who were formally endorsed at the state party ' s April convention . Press also included Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin ( D-Fremont ) , who is running_for the nonpartisan office of state superintendent of public instruction and was endorsed at the convention by acclamation . However , a 1986 voter-approved initiative bars political_parties from endorsing candidates in nonpartisan races . Arguing that it was the party ' s 1st Amendment right to inform party members of the convention action , Press included Eastin , who is featured prominently at the top of the card . The California Republican_Party won a state court_order temporarily halting the distribution of the final 250 # 000 of 1 million slate cards with the Eastin endorsement . But on Wednesday , a federal_court judge sided with the Democrats -- agreeing that the state initiative was invalid and allowing the party to put the remaining cards in the mail . Last month , the public got a rare look_at the inner workings of the commercial side of the slate mailer business , when secretary_of_state candidate Michael Woo sued Democratic political consultant Clint Reilly for breach_of_contract . Woo said he was dumped from the Reilly-operated &quot; California Democratic Voter Checklist &quot; after agreeing to pay $ 90 # 000 for a place on two mailings to be sent to more_than 1 million households . However , Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) , a close ally of Moore , phoned Kathleen Brown to complain about Reilly ' s decision to sell space to Woo . Reilly is Kathleen Brown ' s campaign chairman . After the call , Reilly returned Woo ' s $ 60 # 000 down_payment and agreed to put Moore on the card . In a court statement , Reilly contended that Woo should have been aware &quot; that I reserve the right to change endorsements and make any changes I see fit_in the brochures or cards up_to the moment printing starts. &quot; Woo failed to persuade a San Francisco Superior_Court judge to stop the mailing .</TEXT>
