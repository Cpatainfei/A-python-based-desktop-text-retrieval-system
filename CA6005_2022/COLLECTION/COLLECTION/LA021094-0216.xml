   <HEADLINE> NATO TELLS BOSNIAN SERBS TO PULL_BACK ARMS OR FACE STRIKES ; BALKANS : THE REBELS SURROUNDING SARAJEVO ARE OFFERED ALTERNATIVE OF PUTTING HEAVY_WEAPONS UNDER U.N. CONTROL . THEIR COMMANDERS , ANTICIPATING THE ULTIMATUM , AGREE TO A CEASE-FIRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and its West European allies Wednesday issued a 10-day ultimatum to Bosnian Serb forces , warning that they face air bombardment unless they withdraw their heavy_weapons from the_hills surrounding Sarajevo or place the arms under U.N. control . Anticipating the ultimatum , Bosnian Serb commanders in Sarajevo agreed earlier in the day to a cease-fire and said they were prepared to give the United Nations control over their artillery . Wednesday ' s decision on air strikes , made here by the ambassadors of the 16 North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization countries , effectively brings the Western powers to the brink of offensive military_action in the Balkans for the first time . &quot; We will use our air_power to stop the terrible loss of life and suffering down there , &quot; NATO Secretary_General Manfred Woerner told a news_conference after the meeting . &quot; We have to stop the killing. &quot; The decision called_for Bosnian Serb forces either to withdraw or to place under U.N. control all heavy_weapons within 20 kilometers ( 12.6 miles ) of central Sarajevo . An area around the nearby town of Pale , where the Bosnian Serbs have their headquarters , was exempted from the zone . U.S. officials say the NATO plan asks -- but does not order -- the Bosnian government to put its heavy_weapons , estimated to number fewer than 10 , under U.N. command as well . They estimate that the Bosnian Serbs have at least 100 heavy_weapons . The NATO demands come nearly two years after the start of the bitter war in Bosnia-Herzegovina , which has left 250 # 000 people dead or missing , and follow previous threats by Western democracies that achieved little . But NATO is now poised to act , a senior U.S. official told reporters in Washington . &quot; NATO is ready to act in Bosnia . We firmly hope it will not be necessary to do so. &quot; The alliance set a deadline of 10 days from midnight tonight for completion of the withdrawal and specifically listed the weapons involved -- including tanks , artillery pieces , mortars , multiple-rocket launchers and antiaircraft weapons . &quot; Heavy_weapons of any kind . . . found within the Sarajevo exclusion zone , unless controlled by ( the United Nations ) will , along with their direct and essential military support facilities , be subject_to NATO air strikes , &quot; the ultimatum stated . The 10-day delay , the U.S. official said , is to allow U.N. peacekeeping units to take protective measures . The declaration noted that any such military_action would be conducted &quot; in close coordination with &quot; U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali . The alliance on Wednesday also accepted Boutros-Ghali ' s request to use NATO forces for air strikes in a second instance : against any artillery or mortar positions in or around Sarajevo that fire on civilian targets . Wednesday ' s decision stems directly from the groundswell of public outrage that reverberated throughout the West after the massacre of 68 people last Saturday when a mortar round exploded in a crowded outdoor market in Sarajevo . In a letter written the day after the Sarajevo massacre , Boutros-Ghali specifically sought permission to order NATO planes into action under such circumstances . Woerner said that Boutros-Ghali ' s approval would be required prior to any punitive air strikes and that NATO would act &quot; in close coordination with the ( U.N. ) secretary_general &quot; in assessing the need to follow_through on the ultimatum . About 100 NATO aircraft , mainly stationed in Italy , plus other planes stationed aboard British , French and U.S. aircraft_carriers operating in the Adriatic , would be available if the strikes are necessary . Even with the force of public_opinion suddenly mobilized behind them , the ultimatum did not come easily to alliance members . NATO ambassadors met here in a marathon 12-hour session before overcoming the final concerns of some member states -- notably Greece and Canada . Canada , one of several NATO countries that have ground forces in Bosnia as part of the 12 # 000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force , reportedly expressed concern that air strikes might trigger Serbian reprisals against its troops . The Canadian soldiers are particularly exposed in Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia . Greece , the lone Balkan member of NATO and the only member with strong sympathies toward the Serbs , said it would not participate in any air operations around Sarajevo and would not permit NATO aircraft to launch strikes from bases in Greece . &quot; We are against any Balkan people being involved in this , &quot; Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Georg Papandreou told the Cable News Network on Wednesday . There was also concern about the political and military risks involved in air strikes . Slow-moving antitank aircraft would be potential targets for Bosnian Serbs ' surface-to-air_missiles , and opinion is sharply divided on whether NATO involvement would curtail the violence or escalate it . Wednesday ' s decision to issue the ultimatum was also complicated by a strongly negative reaction by Russia , a Serbian ally . Moscow has demanded a meeting of the U.N. Security_Council to discuss the prospect of air strikes . As reports leaked_out of the NATO meeting Wednesday afternoon that the alliance was moving toward agreement on the air strikes , Bosnian Serb and Muslim military commanders struck a cease-fire deal that included a promise to put heavy artillery on the mountains ringing Sarajevo under U.N. control . The U.N. would monitor the heavy_weapons and deploy troops to sensitive areas under the plan brokered by the U.N. commander in Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose . But critical details , such_as which locations would be covered under the agreement , remained undecided . Rose cautioned reporters not to make too_much of the deal . Neither of the warring parties signed a plan , and no document outlining the agreement was produced . But a summary of the cease-fire agreement provided to reporters indicated that Bosnian Serb army Gen . Manojlo Milovanovic and Gen . Jovan Divjak of the Muslim-led Bosnian army agreed to a cease-fire beginning at noon today . Deals like this have been brokered before , with military commanders negotiating bargains that political_leaders later refused to implement . Special correspondent Danica Kirka in Vienna and Times staff writer Doyle McManus in Washington contributed to this report . * NOT DECISIVE MOVE : The allied threat does not mean an end to the war in Bosnia .
