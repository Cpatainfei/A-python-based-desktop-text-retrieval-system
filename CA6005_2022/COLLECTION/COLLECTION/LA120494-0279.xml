   <HEADLINE> SAFETY ; SKI PATROL TO THE RESCUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Don ' t break a leg , &quot; my non-skiing friends would say as I headed_off on a ski trip . &quot; that ' s just a myth , &quot; I would respond , thinking they had been overly influenced by those New Yorker cartoons showing a skier with his leg in a cast sitting_by the lodge fireplace with a glass of cognac in_hand . Then I joined the Ski Patrol and learned that people do injure their legs while skiing -- and their arms , their heads and especially their knees and thumbs . Some even die . Jasper E . Shealy , director of the Human Factors Laboratory at the Rochester Institute of Technology , has studied skiing injuries for 24 years . He estimates the United States ' 10 million skiers suffer about 150 # 000 injuries each season , a third of them to the knee . The National Ski Areas Assn . reported in May that last season there were 84 skiing accidents resulting in serious injuries , including 41 deaths , nationwide . Shealy and industry sources have speculated that improvements in equipment and grooming of the snow to remove bumps and icy spots makes_it easier for skiers to ski fast , which means they are more seriously injured when they fall . Shealy says 85 % of the people killed in skiing accidents are males , most in their late teens or early 20s -- the same age_group with the highest death rate in automobile and industrial accidents . In Europe , injured skiers are assisted by professional rescuers who require payments for their services . In the United States , the National Ski Patrol , which is made_up primarily of volunteers , provides this service free at most ski areas . The Ski Patrol was founded in 1938 by Charles &quot; Minnie &quot; Dole , a skier who had been badly injured in a skiing accident and later lost a friend killed in a ski_race . Today , the Ski Patrol has 25 # 000 volunteers in 10 regional divisions and 2 # 000 professionals registered in a separate pro division . Many of the professionals , who undergo the same first-aid training as the volunteers , work_at the largest ski areas , especially in the West . As one of those people who can ' t conceive_of a vacation without snow and skiing , I had always admired and envied the Ski Patrollers I watched at resorts all_over the country . They wear cool uniforms ( usually rust and blue for the volunteers ) , cut_in front of the lift line and pull injured skiers down the slopes in toboggans . It wasn ' t until I joined that I realized they also spend a lot of time practicing first_aid in the mud and rain before the ski season begins , carrying bamboo poles back and forth to mark trails and explaining to skiers why there are no bathrooms on the back side of the mountain . They have to be_on duty at the top of the mountain before 8 a.m. to make_sure everything is in_order for skiers and after the lifts close late at night for &quot; sweep , &quot; one last run_down to look_for stragglers . Patrollers have also taken_on more &quot; law_enforcement &quot; duties because of an increase in lawsuits brought by injured skiers against ski areas during the ' 80s . Most resorts have developed risk-management programs with stricter rules against skiing out of bounds , jumping and reckless skiing . Then there is the endless training and testing in first_aid , skiing and handling the toboggan used to bring injured skiers off the mountain -- including picking_up the 60-pound fiberglass sled and carrying it on the chair_lift . Every ski area has its own rules and procedures for the Ski Patrol , which is run_by volunteers but must abide_by management ' s policies . Most ski-area managers realize that the Ski Patrol provides an invaluable service , and they reward its members with such perks as meal tickets and free lift tickets for family members . The first_step in becoming a patroller is usually a &quot; ski-off &quot; on the area ' s toughest slopes to choose candidates with the necessary skiing skills . The candidates who pass the ski-off then begin an intensive , 60- to 80-hour course similar to that taken by emergency medical technicians , but with more on skiing and cold-weather-related injuries . Once candidates have passed the course they begin &quot; S &amp; T , &quot; or ski and toboggan training . The culmination of the process is the dreaded &quot; basic patroller &quot; test of skiing and toboggan handling . Passing the test entitles the new patroller to wear that coveted rust-and-blue parka . The test is grueling -- candidates tend to be_on the mountain from early morning until mid-afternoon on the day of the test . But veterans point_out that today ' s patrollers are really wimps : In the old days , the test culminated with a ritual in which all_the new patrollers were required to climb the mountain -- with their skis on .
