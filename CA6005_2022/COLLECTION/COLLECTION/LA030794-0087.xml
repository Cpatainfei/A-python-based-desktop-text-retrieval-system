   <TEXT> James Fujita ' s fascination with insects began on a sunny spring day when he was 3 years old and ran outside his home to greet a fluttering cloud of butterflies . &quot; I would catch them and put them in a jar , &quot; James said . &quot; I could do that all day. &quot; Today , the sixth-grader at Oxnard ' s Rose Avenue School has become a genuine authority on bugs , lecturing in classrooms from preschool to college throughout Ventura County . He has a massive collection of insects , both dead and alive . And his talks around the county range from lectures on insect anatomy to collecting techniques and the values of bugs in society . &quot; James is an outstanding teacher and speaker who manages to keep a classroom really enthralled ( with ) his presentation , &quot; said Anne Benson , a coordinator with the Oxnard Elementary School District for gifted and talented education . For a 12-year-old , James ' accomplishments are many . Just three months ago , he was named the 1993 Young Entomologist of the Year by the Los Angeles chapter of the international Lorquin Entomological Society . He has also worked with professional organizations including the Insect Zoo of the Los Angeles County Natural_History Museum , and has documented insects for the states of Arizona and California . A death-head moth -- similar to those collected by the serial_killer in &quot; Silence of the Lambs &quot; -- is part of James ' enormous bug collection . The family ' s home is decorated with brown-orange cockroaches collected in Hawaii , and exotic spiders and moths . He also boasts a type of cricket , never identified before , that was destroying strawberries at Oxnard farms . But James ' many achievements are not all_in entomology . Throughout the family ' s home , certificates for his outstanding achievements in math and reading are displayed . James also has a love for literature . Of the books in his library , James said he loves to read children ' s novels , particularly Beverly Cleary ' s books . Although he could be in a high school-level class , James said he wants to stay with his peers , a desire that his parents share . James ' teachers have recommended several times that he skip grades . But his parents , who themselves are high_school teachers , have refused to push their only child . &quot; We don ' t want to rob him of his childhood , &quot; David Fujita said . &quot; You can only goof off once. &quot; The Fujitas said they have supported James ' interest in insects by buying him books and taking him to museums . James ' first book on insects took the place of a teddy_bear , his mother said . &quot; He used to sleep_with his bug book , &quot; Carol Fujita said . &quot; He was only 3 years old. &quot; James said he decided to study insects so he could learn about their habits . After the butterflies , James found a potato_bug , which bit him . &quot; I did not know it would bite me . So I began to observe them and learn about their behavior , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s how it started. &quot; His involvement with entomology , or the study of insects , has continued ever since . He has helped in the inventory of insects at nine Nature Conservancy preserves . He has helped farmers in Ventura County identify insects and has donated insects to Los Angeles County ' s Natural_History Museum and the Santa Barbara Natural_History Museum . Those who know James say his motivation and perseverance distinguish him from other children . &quot; He sets his own standards , &quot; said his teacher , Jerry Schuler . &quot; He does not need any pushing , prodding or cajoling. &quot; Other teachers agreed . &quot; A lot of kids develop a passion for something , but then they get involved with something else , &quot; Benson said . &quot; But James has stuck_with his interest. &quot; Teachers like having James speaking_to their classes not only because of his knowledge , but also because of his enthusiasm . &quot; He shows the kids how much he loves to learn and that is important for the students , &quot; said Joanne Black , Hueneme High_School principal . In the past nine years , bug hunting has become the Fujita family vacation activity . His parents have taken James insect hunting both in the United States and abroad . They have gone bug hunting in Japan and hope to get permission to collect insects in the Costa Rica rain_forest in June . The Fujitas have spent more_than $ 5 # 000 on James ' mini-zoo , but it is an activity that they all enjoy . &quot; We have a lot of fun , &quot; said David Fujita , recalling the time when the three of them ran_through people ' s back yards in Hawaii chasing a butterfly . The chase began after James spotted a white monarch_butterfly on Hawaii ' s main island . &quot; That type of butterfly had been found only on Oahu . So I was really excited , &quot; James said . After a three-mile chase , they caught the butterfly , which is now part of James ' collection . In addition to tennis_shoes , sleeping bags and hats , the Fujitas ' traveling gear includes nets , jars and a generator . &quot; We use the generator lights to attract insects at night , &quot; David Fujita said . Besides hands-on experience , James has acquired much of his expertise through books . An avid reader , James returned all_of his Toys R Us presents one Christmas to the store and used the money to buy books , his father said . &quot; I have a lot of fun reading and I learn a lot , &quot; James said . James has also learned about people from observing insects . &quot; I learned teamwork from the leaf-cutter ants , &quot; he said . After they collect tiny pieces of leaves , the older ants hold the baby ants in their jaws so the babies can spit a kind of glue-like substance that attaches the pieces of leaves together . They use the attached leaves to grow their food , a kind of fungus , James explained . &quot; It ' s kind of cool , &quot; he said . &quot; Insects have interesting habits. &quot; But James is not the quiet and studious kid that one may expect . &quot; He is not an aloof kid who just spends a lot of time_studying , &quot; Schuler said . &quot; He has a lot of friends and it is easy to talk to him. &quot; Playing the piano and swimming are some of James ' other interests . Lately , he began to lift weights . &quot; I am trying to get_in better shape , &quot; he said . A polite and friendly child , James said he has not experienced any pressure from his classmates and friends . &quot; My friends show a lot of support , &quot; James said . &quot; Often , they come_back from a trip with bugs for me. &quot; But does this young scientist want to be an entomologist when he grows_up ? &quot; Not necessarily , &quot; he said . &quot; There are many possibilities , and I will play it by ear. &quot;</TEXT>
