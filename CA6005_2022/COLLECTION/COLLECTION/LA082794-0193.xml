   <HEADLINE> YOEST STILL SHOOTING FOR NBA CAREER ; BASKETBALL : FORMER CRESPI AND LOYOLA MARYMOUNT STANDOUT HAS BOUNCED BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE CBA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Mike Yoest graduated from Loyola Marymount in 1988 his goal was to play pro basketball . It didn ' t matter where , he just wanted to play . Working on the court beat any 9-to-5 job he could imagine . He had solid if not spectacular credentials . As a senior , he started 32 games for Loyola , which had a 25-game winning_streak and finished the season ranked 15th in the nation . He averaged 17.6 points and 7.9 rebounds a game . Fortunately for Yoest , the Loyola coaching staff had connections in Sweden . So when he was offered the opportunity to play there , the former Crespi High standout didn ' t hesitate . He spent only one season in Sweden , but his pro career had begun . &quot; The one thing I learned in Sweden is that I don ' t like cold_weather , &quot; he said . &quot; But I needed to see what I could make of the chance. &quot; Since then , Yoest , a 6-foot-7 forward , has spent five seasons bouncing between Europe and the Continental Basketball Assn . with hopes of eventually cracking the NBA . Yoest , who earned a degree in marketing , lives with his parents in Chatsworth during the off-season and has supported himself on low CBA wages and occasional acting work in commercials . He has played for CBA teams in San Jose and Bakersfield , and his European stops include Sweden and Portugal . Last season was his best in Europe . He averaged 25 points and 3.5 steals a game for Zitoira de Setubal in Portugal . But an NBA job remains elusive . &quot; Just once I ' d like to get there and have a taste of it , &quot; Yoest said . He has come_close to satisfying his appetite . The Golden State Warriors and Sacramento Kings invited him to camp as a free_agent in 1988 . He tried_out for both teams , but was cut . Yoest also was cut by Sacramento in 1990 . Still , he considers the experience invaluable . &quot; I didn ' t play well enough to impress anyone , but it was still a great thing for my career in Europe . I learned what it took_to stay_on my game and what they look_for in the pros , &quot; he said . Paul Westhead , who coached Yoest at Loyola , said his former player is just a bounce pass_away from the NBA . &quot; Mike Yoest has missed being an NBA player by maybe 5 % , &quot; said Westhead , a former coach of the Lakers who now coaches at George Mason University . &quot; He ' s a guy who can run , jump , shoot and do everything . It ' s a shame he hasn ' t made_it yet . He ' s the kind of guy any coach would love to have. &quot; Yoest ' s career nearly ended before he left the 11th grade at Crespi . In a tournament game , he suffered a fractured tibia and sat_out the rest of the season . &quot; Here I am in my junior season and I get hurt . That left only one year for me to earn a scholarship , &quot; he said . As a senior , Yoest lead the Celts into the second round of the Southern Section playoffs , averaging 14 points and 10 rebounds . At Loyola , Yoest teamed with Bo Kimble , Hank Gathers and Corey Gaines in the 1987-88 season to give the school perhaps its best team . The Lions advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament before losing to North Carolina . Yoest played one of his best college games during the tournament . In the first round against Wyoming at Salt_Lake_City , he scored 25 points , converting 15 of 17 foul_shots during a 119-115 victory . * Yoest ' s first CBA experience was short . He was drafted by the Rockford Lightning in 1988 , but his rights were traded to Albany before the season started . George Karl , current Seattle SuperSonics coach , cut Yoest at Albany . &quot; For a guy hoping to get a pro career I wasn ' t doing too well , &quot; Yoest said . He signed with the CBA ' s San Jose Jammers in 1990-1991 . Like most players in the CBA , he earned around $ 3 # 500 a month for a six-month season . &quot; Except for the pay , the CBA is like the NBA . You play four games a week and go_on 10-day road trips , &quot; he said . Yoest recorded the first triple-double in Jammers ' franchise history . But the team history is a short one . The franchise relocated to Bakersfield in 1991 . Soon after , it folded . Forced to retreat home , Yoest decided to audition for commercials . His brother Steve already had been to a_few tryouts . Yoest went_to casting calls_for LA Gear and Reebok . &quot; Both companies called and made me offers . I was kind of floored by it , &quot; Yoest said . After careful consideration he decided to go_with Reebok . The company was making its &quot; Dan and Dave &quot; commercials , which focused_on decathletes Dan O ' Brien and Dave Johnson and figured to be prominent during the 1992 Olympics . But the commercials were scrapped when O ' Brien failed to qualify for the Olympics . &quot; That guy not making the Olympics cost me a lot of money , &quot; Yoest said . &quot; But probably not as much money as it did Reebok. &quot; Yoest landed a position in Portugal at midseason and has played there the past three years . He is uncertain about returning to Portugal for a another season . &quot; Being in Europe creates problems , &quot; Yoest said . &quot; There is a new language to learn , the culture is different and you get homesick . You ' re always out of touch with back home. &quot; Yoest was in Portugal in 1990 when he received a phone_call at 4 a.m. His college roommate , Gathers , had collapsed and died from heart_failure in a basketball_game at Loyola . &quot; When I got that call I didn ' t believe it at first , &quot; Yoest said . &quot; Then you realize there ' s nothing you can do . &quot; Hank and I were good friends but I couldn ' t make_it back for the funeral because of the season , &quot; Yoest said . &quot; When things like that happen , you feel helpless. &quot; Yoest is entertaining ideas of trying_out for a new CBA team in Hartford . Paul Mokeski , a former NBA player with the Milwaukee Bucks and a Crespi graduate , is slated to be the head coach . &quot; I haven ' t given_up on any more NBA tryouts but I ' m also being realistic , &quot; Yoest said . &quot; I ' m not upset about how my career has gone . After all , how many people out there would n ' t want to switch places with me ? &quot; I consider myself lucky . And besides , why give_up the dream ? &quot;</TEXT>
