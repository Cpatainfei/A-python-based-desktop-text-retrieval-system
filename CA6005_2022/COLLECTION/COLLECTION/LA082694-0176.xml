   <HEADLINE> A FRESH LOOK_AT ANTIQUITIES ; THE FIRST PUBLIC SHOW OF CYPRIOT ARTIFACTS AT CSUN WILL BE IN A TRAILER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s a paradox in Cal State Northridge ' s first art exhibit of the school_year . Beginning Monday , one can see some of the most enduring artifacts ever to grace CSUN in the show , &quot; Cypriote Antiquities in Southern California. &quot; Among almost 40 jugs , bottles , bowls , plates and oil_lamps are several pieces dating to the Bronze_Age , some of them as old as 2100 BC . But one must view these ancient objects in the most temporary of spaces . Since the January earthquake , the Fine_Arts building that contained CSUN ' s three art_galleries has been closed . To follow_through on presenting this year ' s gallery schedule , an exhibit space was set_up in a trailer near the corner of Nordhoff Street and Etiwanda Avenue . Most pieces in the show come from two local collections held by 75-year-old twins James Stewart Bruce and Janet Bruce-Nathason . This is the first time the objects have been available to the public . &quot; If you think_of the history of this material , and what happened to the campus , it ' s ironic doing_it here , &quot; said Catie Dede-Mihalopoulos , exhibit curator . The show was planned more_than a year ago , having evolved out of Dede-Mihalopoulos ' master ' s thesis . She completed the thesis this year at CSUN under the supervision of Birgitta Lindros-Wohl , professor of Greek and Roman art history . ( Lindros-Wohl is the daughter of John Lindros , the architect and photographer of the Swedish Cyprus Expedition , 1927-1931 . It was during that expedition that the first systematic , stratigraphical excavations of the island of Cyprus were made. ) Dede-Mihalopoulos , originally from Athens , explained that Cyprus , lying between southern Europe and the Near_East , has served as a link between East and West for several millennia . She became intrigued with Cypriot artifacts because , despite the island culture ' s close connection to Greek culture , &quot; what you see there is so different from what you see on the mainland , &quot; she said . Evident are influences of Greek as well as Eastern peoples -- Phoenicians , Assyrians , Egyptians , Persians -- and the Romans , who held Cyprus within its empire from circa 30 BC . &quot; It ' s like a cocktail . You start with the Greek and then you pour all these other things in , &quot; Lindros-Wohl said . The clay , limestone and glass objects in the show made their way to Southern California with the twin collectors , who grew_up on Cyprus during the 1920s and ' 30s while their father served as manager of the Cyprus Mines Corp . United Nations troops now occupy the house that the twins lived_in , a result of the 1974 invasion of the island by Turkish troops . There are seven other Cypriot antiquities collections in the area , including those at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , the Getty Museum , the Claremont Colleges , the Philosophical Research Society in the Los Feliz neighborhood and the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana . &quot; I think it ' s important that people become aware that this heritage is here , &quot; Dede-Mihalopoulos said . &quot; Archeologists like me are able to study them firsthand . As a person who studies these artifacts , I see the uniqueness of them . The uniqueness comes from the cosmopolitan-ness &quot; of the island . Among the more ancient pieces in the exhibit is a Cypro-Mycenaean vessel of the Late Bronze_Age , 1400-1230 BC . A Bichrome Ware Dish dates between 850 and 700 BC , the Late Cypro-Geometric period . Works from the earliest of times were &quot; consistently limited to geometric patterns , but endless patterns . The shapes are pleasant to touch and have a tremendous sense of aesthetic form , &quot; Lindros-Wohl said . Plate-like oil_lamps from the Cypro-Archaic period ( 750-475 BC. ) evolved to be made from two molds , the top mold enclosing the oil in the bottom one . The votive terra-cotta &quot; Bearded Horseman &quot; of the Cypro-Archaic period , from the Royal Athena Gallery collection , represents a significant aspect of Cypriot antiquities -- the depiction of the human figure in rather specific forms . The Late Cypro-Archaic &quot; Head of Aphrodite , &quot; from Lindros-Wohl ' s collection , stands as a symbol of the Cypriot ' s connection to Greek_mythology . Among the numerous examples of Roman glass circa 50 BC-150 AD are small tear bottles , used by professional mourners at funerals , and the substantially larger &quot; Unguentaria , &quot; bottles that resemble the shape of candlesticks . Though Cyprus artisans throughout the centuries assimilated outside influences , their artwork has &quot; remained uniquely Cypriot , &quot; Dede-Mihalopoulos said . WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; Cypriote Antiquities in Southern California. &quot; Location : CSUN Art_Gallery , Art Annex 116 , near Nordhoff Street and Etiwanda Avenue , Northridge .
