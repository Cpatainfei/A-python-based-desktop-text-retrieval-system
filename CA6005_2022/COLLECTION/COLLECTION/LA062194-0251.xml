   <HEADLINE> EDUCATION ; NEW YORK SCHOOL HELPS A WORLD OF STUDENTS TRANSLATE SUCCESS ; INTERNATIONAL HIGH ACCEPTS IMMIGRANT TEEN-AGERS WITH POOR ENGLISH SKILLS . THE HALLS RING WITH MORE THAN 40 LANGUAGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sweat shirts and baseball_caps . Students wearing T-shirts , mouths filled with braces . Horseplay in the halls between classes . At first glance , it could be almost any public high_school . But a closer look reveals that this particular mix of students is a multiculturalist ' s dream : a cornucopia of European , Asian and African faces , all filling the halls with a chorus of Caribbean , Eastern European and Chinese voices . It ' s New York ' s International High , a four-year New York City public_school . Criteria for admission : birth outside of the United States and a score of 20 % or lower on an English proficiency exam . As a result , the school ' s 450 students represent 60 countries with more_than 40 separate languages . In a city that over the last several decades has experienced a vast influx of immigrants , statistics show the school is a necessity . Almost 15 % of New York ' s 1 million students have limited proficiency in English -- a trend that is accelerating , educators say . Half of all entering kindergarten pupils now come from homes where English is not the primary language . Into the Mainstream By clustering immigrants in selected schools , teachers hope to accelerate their transition into American life . &quot; The fact we are all immigrants makes_it easier . We are all more comfortable , &quot; says Molly Yu , 15 , a native of China now living_in Woodside , Queens . The school , located on the campus of La Guardia Community_College , was established in 1985 after educators took_note of the increasing number of immigrant students attending the two-year college . The high_school and college are linked by more_than location . International ' s students are encouraged to take college-level classes . They can use the college gym . And , most important , graduates of International High_School are guaranteed admission to La Guardia . &quot; There ' s no doubt some of these students would fall_through the cracks at a regular comprehensive high_school , &quot; says Charles Glassman , a teacher and administrator at the school . &quot; They aren ' t looked_at as a benefit or resource. &quot; In fact , more_than 90 % of International High_School ' s students continue on to college , a rate that rivals many better-heeled suburban school districts . International ' s students bring_to the classroom a wide variety of life experience . While some had consistent education before coming_to the United States , others attended school in a piecemeal fashion . A few were not even literate in their native language . Students of all linguistic and educational backgrounds are mixed together in classes . &quot; Immigrant students are a vulnerable population in our society , &quot; says Jacqueline Ancess , a senior research associate at Columbia University ' s Teacher ' s College . &quot; One of the most important things International High_School does is provide immigrant students with access to a rigorous academic education . They are not handicapped because they are not American citizens or native English speakers. &quot; But not all educators are supporters of four-year high_schools for immigrant students . Willis Hawley , dean of the University of Maryland ' s College of Education and a scholar of desegregation , questions the appropriateness of separating immigrant students from others . &quot; A concern you could have is if separation of children from the mainstream population might retard their ability to learn the culture , &quot; Hawley says . &quot; Ask yourself the question : If you ' re growing_up in France , would it be the best thing to go_to school with other American kids ? It would be more comfortable , but would it be in your best interests in the long_run ? &quot; But Principal Eric Nadelstern says his students need a special setting like the one International High provides . &quot; My concern is that the trauma all adolescents experience ( is compounded ) . They ' ve left their families , they face a culture they can ' t quite comprehend and a language they don ' t know at a time when undergoing adolescent travails , &quot; Nadelstern says . &quot; Considering the dislocation they ' ve faced , they need to feel connected. &quot; Fleurina Kuka , now 16 , was left with her older brother and grandmother when her parents left Yugoslavia and came_to the United States eight years ago . Lives of Challenge Now in the United States two years , Kuka still misses her grandmother fiercely . &quot; She ' s like my mother . I feel_like my ( real ) parents are just taking_care of me . I can ' t love them like other people love their parents . It ' s not that easy. &quot; And then there ' s Diantha Hall , 16 , one of the few students in the school actually born in New York . Hall ' s Costa Rican-born mother and Panamanian-born father split_up when she was 5 . Her mother remained in New York , but sent Diantha to live with an aunt in Costa Rica for several years and she lost most of her English_language skills . &quot; I ' m really confused . I want to go_back home , but I want to stay here , &quot; Hall says . &quot; If I could do anything , I would turn_back the clock and just do things one way . No changes . When I went_over to Costa Rica with no Spanish , I didn ' t know anybody , not my grandmother , not my aunt . When I come_back here , I didn ' t know nobody . I felt lonely even though I ' m a person who finds friends everywhere. &quot; Spanish is the most common language of the school ' s students , followed by Chinese and Polish . Others include Russian and Korean . Students do not take bilingual classes . English is taught through the immersion method in the school ' s small classes , but students are encouraged to continue studying and speaking their native tongue . Often , older students act_as impromptu translators for more recent arrivals . Students share their fears and problems with one another . They talk_about the violence that ' s pervasive in many of their neighborhoods , missing relatives and friends left_behind in their native countries -- and , for some , their hatred of New York ' s winter climate . &quot; I came_in the winter and it was terrible , &quot; says Kruskaya Cabral , 15 , of her arrival in Brooklyn from the Dominican_Republic two years ago . &quot; Yes , I wanted to leave right away . It was different , I didn ' t feel anyone cared . I miss a lot of things -- friends , my country and I didn ' t know English. &quot; A Place to Fit In Students discover International in a variety of ways . Many are recommended by guidance counselors at other city schools . Others hear about it from neighbors and friends already attending the school . Still others come_after a year at the city ' s Liberty High_School , a one-year transitional program for recent immigrant students . And some graduates find it hard to leave the school . Mohammad Nader , 24 , a 1988 graduate , is studying political_science at Queens College . He also runs International ' s computer lab . Nader arrived_at International in 1985 as part of its first_class . He and his older brother were smuggled out of Afghanistan in the back of a truck . Arriving in Queens to stay with an older brother , Nader spoke no English and found himself in the ninth grade at a junior_high_school while working_at an Arkansas Fried Chicken fast-food restaurant on weekends . A guidance counselor steered him to International . &quot; It was hard then , and it ' s still hard . At ( 15 ) , I was_on my own , no mom , no dad , going_to school , paying bills , no one to check my homework , &quot; Nader recalls . &quot; I personally don ' t think I would have gone_further than high_school if I ' d gone_to another school . I ' d probably be one of the dropouts. &quot; International High ' s success has spawned similar institutions . A second International High_School is now in its first year of operation in Manhattan ' s Chinatown , and still another is slated to open its doors in Brooklyn in time for the 1994-95 academic_year .</TEXT>
