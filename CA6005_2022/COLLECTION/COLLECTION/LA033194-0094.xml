   <TEXT> Frances Donaldson , who wrote an award-winning biography of Edward_VIII , the king who abdicated in 1936 to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Warfield Simpson , has died . She was 87 . Lord John Donaldson said his wife died Sunday of cancer at their London home . The 1974 biography of the king_of_England won the Wolfson Literary Award and was the basis for the 1981 HBO movie &quot; Edward and Mrs . Simpson. &quot; Lady Donaldson served as script supervisor for the TV film , which won an Emmy for &quot; Masterpiece Theater. &quot; Lady Donaldson ' s first biography , in 1957 , was &quot; Freddy Lonsdale , &quot; a loving but candid portrait of her father , a playwright and bon_vivant . Her other books included a sketch of author Evelyn Waugh , a biography of humorist P.G. Wodehouse and a history of the Royal Opera House . When her &quot; P.G. Wodehouse : A Biography &quot; was published in 1982 , a year after the humorist ' s centenary observance , Charles Champlin wrote in a Los Angeles Times review : &quot; It is worth waiting for because it is a superior piece of biographical research and a careful job of literary placement. &quot; Lady Donaldson wrote two autobiographies , &quot; Child of the Twenties &quot; in 1959 and &quot; A Twentieth Century Life &quot; in 1992 .</TEXT>
