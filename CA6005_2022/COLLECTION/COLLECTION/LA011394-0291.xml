   <HEADLINE> LEGISLATION MAKES HIGH_SCHOOL SPORTS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Billy Miller normally has no interest in the fine print of state laws or the stilted language of school district regulations . Yet new state open enrollment legislation and the school policies it will generate intrigue Miller , a football and basketball_player who is the best athlete at Westlake High . Beginning in the fall , students may attend any school in their district , provided there are openings . Miller , a junior , could transfer either to Newbury Park , whose football_team was 14-0 last fall , or to Thousand Oaks , whose basketball_team has won three consecutive league titles . But his coaches can rest easy : Miller is staying_put . He ' s more interested in who might be looking Westlake ' s way . &quot; If a school is not doing too good , their best players could transfer to Westlake , &quot; he said . &quot; For future program building , when I hear about someone wanting to quit here or there , I wonder where they ' ll go. &quot; The legislation , which took_effect this month and gives districts until July 1 to formulate open enrollment policies , reflects the growing desire of parents to have broader choice in the schools their children attend . But many coaches and administrators believe lawmakers might as well have proclaimed : You Must Implement Chaos . The effect on athletics could be far-reaching : The temptation for coaches to recruit will be greater and athletes can shop around for the most appealing program . At stake is the competitive balance of interscholastic athletics . There is even speculation that district all-star teams eventually will develop . &quot; There will be some powerhouse teams , &quot; said Bob Cooper , the Hoover High baseball_coach of 20 years . &quot; This is going_to open_up gigantic questions. &quot; Under current California Interscholastic Federation rules , recruiting is prohibited and transfers must change residence or lose a year of varsity eligibility . Can those regulations remain ? Or does the new legislation change all_the rules ? THE CIF The CIF is expected to announce within weeks whether its current transfer rule will stay_on the books . Some officials want to hold_firm while others believe the regulation must be modified in light of open enrollment . In November , the CIF distributed a letter to schools stating that because of the new law , athletes would be eligible immediately when they transfer . The letter brought an outcry from schools urging the CIF to continue to regulate the transfer of athletes . &quot; There was concern , so we decided to study the residential eligibility issue further , &quot; CIF Commissioner Thomas Byrnes said . Should the current transfer rule be retained , however , it is almost certain to be challenged in court . &quot; A judge somewhere will decide what is right and wrong , &quot; said Richard Newman , a Conejo Valley Unified School District trustee . &quot; This issue will not be decided by school personnel , it will be litigated . that ' s a given. &quot; The probable scenario : An athlete will transfer under the open enrollment law yet be denied a year of athletic eligibility because he or she did not change residence . The athlete will point_out that members of a school band or the drama club are able to continue their extracurricular_activity upon transferring . Why should an athlete be penalized ? State athletic associations in Colorado and Minnesota have loosened their transfer rules_in the past two years to accommodate open enrollment . In both states , students are eligible for athletics providing they transfer between school_years and begin attending their new school on the first day of classes . &quot; There has been a slight increase in the transfers of athletes , but not as much as you would think , &quot; said Bert Borgmann , Colorado ' s assistant commissioner of athletics . &quot; There have been a_few celebrated cases. &quot; As local districts struggle to formulate open enrollment policies , they are counting_on the CIF to provide direction . &quot; A lot of this can ' t be sorted_out until we find_out what ( the CIF ) plans to do , &quot; said Jerry Dannenberg , a Ventura Unified School District official studying the impact of the new laws . Until then , athletes should beware . Unless the residence requirement is stricken , a year of eligibility will be the price of transferring without moving . New law or no new law . &quot; We already got a call , a good football_player is interested in attending Rio Mesa , &quot; said George Contreras , football assistant at Rio Mesa . &quot; Three or four other football_players in the district , the rumor is they want to come here . &quot; If kids are calling us , we want to know what to tell them . I ' d hate to see a kid transfer , then have to tell him he isn ' t eligible. &quot; The situation is clear for incoming ninth graders . They will be eligible at the school they initially attend regardless of residence , according to Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley . SOUTHERN SECTION DISTRICTS For suburban districts with several high_schools -- Oxnard Union and Antelope Valley Union each has five , the most in the area -- drafting open enrollment policies is a complex task . According to the law , students will be accepted into a school outside their residency only if there are openings . Should more students apply for enrollment than a school can accept , selection must be made without regard_to athletic skills . Deadlines for students to transfer must be set to streamline registration . Random selection methods for transfers must be devised . And community reaction must be gauged . Town_hall meetings are being held this month throughout the William S . Hart Union School District in Santa Clarita before trustees adopt open enrollment policies . Hart Union has three high_schools and this fall will open a fourth -- Valencia High . &quot; We will help the community understand requirements of the law and discuss problems the district faces as it implements regulations , &quot; said Lew White , the Hart Union administrator addressing open enrollment . &quot; I am sure that athletics will be a hot topic. &quot; Most districts plan to adopt policies well before the July deadline . Oxnard Union must have regulations in place quickly because registration for the 1994-95 school_year begins in February . Conejo Valley Unified administrators have completed a draft on a transfer policy and will soon submit it to trustees . Antelope Valley Union , Ventura Unified , Glendale Unified , Burbank Unified and Las Virgenes Unified will seek board approval by April . For guidance , districts can look_to the California School_Board Assn. , once it establishes its open enrollment policy . &quot; We will use the ( CSBA policy ) as a starting point and turn it into what is workable for us , &quot; said Bill Studt , superintendent of the Oxnard Union High_School District . Officials from several districts say athletes -- or any other students -- will be unable to transfer anywhere , anytime they please . An enrollment cap will be established at each school , restricting transfers . From an athletics standpoint , such limits might give one school an advantage over another in the same district . &quot; Ventura High could handle more students , while Buena is a bit overcrowded , &quot; Dannenberg said . &quot; We ' d much rather see kids go_to Ventura . W look very carefully at transfers coming_into Buena. &quot; Deadlines for application will force students to plan a transfer well in_advance . &quot; We will not allow transfers mid-year , &quot; said Robert Girolamo , superintendent of the Antelope Valley Union High_School District . The Antelope Valley district already allows students to transfer without changing residence . CITY SECTION In the L.A. Unified School District ' s 49 high_schools , open enrollment means business as usual . The massive district has long offered greater school choice , larger loopholes and more bureaucracy , an equation that results in an enormous amount of cynicism . &quot; I guess the City people are already used to it . A kid can almost go anywhere now . What changes ? , &quot; said Jim Woodard , the longtime Taft High basketball_coach . Athletes have used -- or misused -- voluntary desegregation and magnet programs to transfer without changing residence . Now all they must do is simply apply to the school of their choice . &quot; Being a former high_school principal , I see real problems , &quot; said Francis Nakano , an LAUSD assistant superintendent who is studying open enrollment . &quot; I hope it doesn ' t get_out of hand. &quot; Schools with better reputations , academic and athletic , probably will benefit . But coaches who recruit stand to gain the most of all . &quot; I ' ve been told I ' ll probably be getting a lot of guys because Taft is a desirable school , &quot; Woodard said . &quot; On the other hand , these coaches who deal in youth leagues will be_after those kids early . &quot; Now they won ' t have to say , ' we ' ll provide an address for you. ' This law has eliminated that step. &quot; UNDUE INFLUENCE Recruiting still will be prohibited by the CIF , according to Commissioner Byrnes . But the rules might need to be more vigorously enforced , and the CIF does not have the personnel or budget to crack_down . &quot; The coach who wants to commit mischief is the coach who weakens the entire system , &quot; said Newman , the Conejo trustee . &quot; Other coaches will react . Mischief will determine what is ethical. &quot; Recruiting can be difficult to prove . Typically , athletes in a successful program , or their parents , do the selling . &quot; Kids want to go where there is a winner , &quot; said Contreras , the Rio Mesa assistant . &quot; If it ' s that important to a family , they ' ll find a way. &quot; Channel Islands football_Coach Joel Gershon believes coaches contacted by athletes from other schools should encourage them not to transfer . He raised the point at a recent meeting of the Ventura County Football_Coaches Assn . &quot; I brought this up and there was stone silence , &quot; he said . &quot; That worries me . Everybody is taking an attitude of ' How is this going_to affect me ? ' rather than , ' Who are we as coaches ? What do we stand_for ? ' &quot; Woodard , the Taft basketball_coach , does not believe any kind of ethical standard can be established in the City Section . &quot; A lot of people are teaching kids to lie_about addresses and about who they talked to , &quot; he said . &quot; Everyone is appalled when later they get_in a college scandal , but it ' s no surprise . They ' ve been taught to lie since junior high. &quot; ( MORE )</TEXT>
