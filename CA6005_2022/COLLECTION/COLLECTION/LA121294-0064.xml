   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES : MAKING A DIFFERENCE ; LOS ANGELES FREE-NET : A WEALTH OF INFORMATION , A LOCAL CALL AWAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is a universe of free , valuable information resources on the Internet . What can be costly is the computer and telephone modem , plus the on-line time ( often long-distance ) needed to retrieve it . A fledgling local service , the Los Angeles Free-Net , will make ' Net resources a local_call away for anyone in L.A. County with access to a computer and a modem , whether at_home , school or at community locations such_as libraries or hospitals . Health , education , job and government information is available to free-net members seven days a week , 24 hours a day . There are scores of public access Free-Nets in the works nationwide , 33 of which serve other cities . The Los Angeles Free-Net officially came on-line seven months ago and is operated by the Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical_Center and the H.O.P.E. ( Hope Opportunities Participation Education ) Unit Foundation , a cancer support and counseling center . The free-net grew from their interest in_using modern technologies to offer the same medical information and support by computer that they provide on a personal basis . In October , organizers received a $ 95 # 000 grant from the U.S. Department_of_Commerce to provide local calling access to the Los Angeles Free-Net from anywhere in the county . The free-net expects to offer local_call service from the 213 , 310 and 818 area_codes by mid-1995 . Current Services on the Internet offered through the Los Angeles Free-Net * Los Angeles Public_Library Catalog and Library of Congress Catalog * City of Los Angeles Emergency Information Network * E-mail from any Internet address worldwide * &quot; Ask the Doctor &quot; medical questions confidentially answered by physicians * &quot; Academy One , &quot; a national information center for K-12 grade students , schools around the country have collaborated on assignments using real space shuttle mission information available from NASA * California highway conditions from CalTrans * Access to bulletin_boards and more_than 1000 popular Internet newsgroups Members are encouraged to suggest additional Internet sites to be added_to the Free-Net . HOW IT WILL WORK 1 . Local users dial the Los Angeles Free-Net from home , schools , libraries , senior centers , hospitals , clinics and other community locations . 2 . Local_calls are relayed to switching sites that transfer the calls to the free-net ' s main computer in the San Fernando Valley . 3 . The main computer delivers users ' requests and messages out onto the Internet . The system currently runs_on a computer with 16 telephone_lines . To maximize access members must log-off after each hour of use . Free-Net operators hope to expand telephone capacity to 800 lines over the next three years . Los Angeles Free-Net Facts * Annual registration fee : $ 10 * Number of registered subscribers : 2 # 817 * Average connect time per use : 16.7 minutes WHY IS A FREE-NET IMPORTANT TO A COMMUNITY ? &quot; Getting computer information resources can be extremely expensive . Free-Nets make available much of the same or similar material for much less . Today , information is almost like currency when it comes_to managing your life . And in a democracy we need to make_it available reasonably and in many cases ( such_as free-nets and public_libraries ) free . The Los Angeles Free-Net is another package for information , and it ' s available to people who can ' t afford home computers and long distance bills to dial in on_their_own to computer resources . It ' s is a real work of love and a great public service. &quot; -- Celia Carroll , Santa Monica Public_Library automation and PEN ( public electronic network ) coordinator . PEN is the city ' s electronic_mail and conferencing system . TO GET INVOLVED Dial up by computer modem to ( 818 ) 776-5000 . Set modem to eight bits , no parity , one stop bit -- the standard settings for connecting to a bulletin_board . The free-net supports modem speeds_up to 14 # 400 baud . Or leave a voice message at ( 818 ) 954-0080 .</TEXT>
