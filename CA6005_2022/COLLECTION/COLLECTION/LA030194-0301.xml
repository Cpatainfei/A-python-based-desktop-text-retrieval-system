   <HEADLINE> GLOBOCARS : THE NEXT CENTURY ; ASIA ' S INDUSTRIAL GIANT HITS SOME POTHOLES ; BUT TOKYO REMAINS A FAVORITE IN THE AUTO WARS . IT HAS A GREAT TRACK RECORD AND TOP TECHNOLOGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once seemingly invincible , the Japanese auto industry is suffering declines in both exports and domestic sales . Profits are falling , work_forces are being trimmed . Has the juggernaut reached the end of the road ? Most analysts say no . After all , despite hard_times now , it is the Japanese who taught the world how to build a first-rate car economically -- and how to market it abroad . Whatever the challenges , they will be heavyweight players for many decades to come . London-based Financial Times Business Information foresees 40 % of the cars sold worldwide at the turn_of_the_century bearing Japanese brand names . Pemberton Associates of Britain puts the figure at 50 % . At present , the Japanese share is about 33 % . Still , the old self-confidence has been shaken . After a binge of investment in the late 1980s , Japanese auto_makers have been battered by recession and a painfully strong yen , which drives_up the price of their cars abroad . The days of export-led growth seem gone forever . Industry executives talk_of building new factories overseas to promote growth , while holding their existing capacity in Japan to meet any rebound in domestic demand . The recession and yen appreciation &quot; very heavily damaged the strength of Japanese auto_manufacturers . . . . We are struggling for survival , &quot; said Yoshikazu Kawana , Nissan ' s executive managing director . At least two years will be needed to recover , said Mazda Executive_Vice_President Makoto Miyaji . Since 1971 , Japanese auto_makers have overcome one spurt after another in the value of the yen . But this time they have been staggered . The yen shot_up more_than 20 % against the dollar at one point last year -- with devastating effects on export profits . Although the currency then softened for a while , last month ' s historic summit clash between President Clinton and Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa sent it back to a near-record level . The rate was regarded_as competitive when it was 115 yen to the dollar . Now , Japan ' s auto_makers face a rate of about 104 to the dollar . The strong yen cost Japanese auto_makers 300 # 000 cars in lost production last year , according to Richard Koo of Nomura Research Institute . Suddenly , two new threats have entered the picture : the possibility that the Clinton_Administration might take further action to force open Japanese markets -- perhaps a 25 % tariff ( a tenfold increase ) on minivans and sport utility vehicles , which would effectively wipe_out exports of those vehicles -- or American pressure for an additional increase in the value of the yen . Japanese auto_makers ' share of the U.S. car market slipped to 29.1 % last year , down from 30.1 % in 1992 . And the situation was far worse at_home , with sales down 7 % . Of Japan ' s 11 manufacturers , only one -- Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd . -- posted gains . Toyota , the Japanese giant , saw its profits in the second_half of 1993 sliced razor-thin . Nissan ran in the red last year , as did Mazda . Meanwhile , reinvigorated competition from Detroit ' s Big Three -- General Motors , Ford and Chrysler -- may put further pressure on Japanese manufacturers . * To offset declining profits at_home and in the U.S. market , Japanese auto_makers are seeking a major share of anticipated growth in Latin_America , the Middle_East and , especially , Southeast_Asia . The strategy will be establishment of overseas assembly_plants because many developing countries forbid imports of finished cars . &quot; Maybe profits in Japan will go_down , but on the other hand , profit in the outside operations will go_up , &quot; said Reijiro Kuromizu , a Mitsubishi managing director . &quot; that ' s exactly what we ' re aiming at. &quot; But the Japanese are not giving_up on exports . For instance , Mazda hopes to make itself competitive overseas even at an exchange_rate of 100 yen to the dollar in the next two years , said Toshio Wakiya , manager of its North_American market . &quot; All of the auto_makers will once again rejuvenate their structure , and in two or three years become strong again , &quot; Miyaji , the company ' s executive_vice_president , predicted . Toyota ' s production &quot; will become really global &quot; by the year 2000 , predicted Iwao Isomura , a Toyota executive_vice_president . &quot; On the world scale we ' ll be producing about 6 million cars , with domestic production about 4 million. &quot; This would mean a doubling of overseas production . As it looks_to the future , the Japanese industry still has great advantages to draw upon . Its technology stands at the forefront of the world ' s auto_makers . And of the 12 producers turning_out 1 million or more cars a year , five are Japanese . Japanese factories already operating in the United States have a combined capacity of 2.4 million units a year , ensuring that they will remain major players in the world ' s biggest market . Investments in Southeast_Asia have given the Japanese a big head_start over their competitors in what is widely expected to be the world ' s next boom auto market . And throughout the world , including the United States , auto_makers remain reliant upon the Japanese to supply top-quality parts . Even the higher yen has a positive side . Overseas investments and imports of raw_materials and parts become cheaper . And the excessive investments of the late 1980s in the home market mean there is fat that can be trimmed . Mazda ' s labor_union chief , Takeshi Morikawa , cited several examples . One step , he suggested , would be to reduce the number of models . Mazda , for example , increased its models from six to 30 between 1985 and 1992 and , as a result , was producing only 30 # 000 a year of some of them . Morikawa also said companies end their &quot; excessive competition on sales. &quot; &quot; We workers struggle to save even a single yen on the assembly_line , and they ( the management ) spend 200 # 000 yen ( $ 1 # 942 ) on incentives to sell a single car , &quot; he said . Already , the trend toward offering consumers an ever-expanding array of choices is being reversed . &quot; During the ' bubble era , ' cars became overly high_quality and overdesigned , and too expensive , &quot; said Toyota ' s Isomura . &quot; After the bubble burst , people didn ' t want cars that were too expensive . The biggest issue now is how to redesign cars to be less expensive. &quot; The effort to meet that demand is already paying_off , with the reduction of parts in new models exceeding 20 % , Isomura said . Toyota and other manufacturers are also moving toward greater &quot; commonization &quot; of parts -- using the same parts for various models . Pragmatic collaborations in which manufacturers make certain models for each other are growing . Toyota , for example , offers a fuller line of vehicles by procuring trucks from Hino and mini-cars from Daihatsu . Such hookups help keep Japan ' s weaker manufacturers alive . Harmonious labor-management relations also offer Japanese auto_makers hope for overcoming current difficulties . For example , workers who last year found themselves taking_home smaller paychecks for the first time in decades have not complained . Foreign cars , while still a minuscule 3.1 % of the market , are running against the trend . Last year , sales of_imported vehicles rose 9.1 % . Imports came mainly from Japanese plants in the United States -- which produce right-hand-drive cars for export to the home country -- and from European car_makers . Exports to Japan by Detroit ' s Big Three amounted to only 19 # 000 last year , or 0.29 % of the total market . Although Japan imposes no tariff on car imports , U.S. makers claim the market is closed -- chiefly because few dealers are willing to handle imports .
