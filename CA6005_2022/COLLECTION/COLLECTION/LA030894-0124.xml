   <HEADLINE> TESTS URGED FOR STUDENTS POKED WITH NEEDLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Twenty-one middle-school students who were poked with needles brought_to campus by a classmate should be tested for hepatitis , school officials have recommended . In what Principal Greg Gerard called a &quot; bizarre &quot; incident , a student took blood_test needles belonging_to her diabetic grandmother to Challenger Middle_School last week . Some students were poked with the needles , some several times either by_choice or maliciously , officials said . The student who brought the needles to school handed them to a classmate , who then poked other students , officials said . &quot; Some kids were being poked , some were saying , ' Poke me again , ' &quot; said Gerard . &quot; It ' s kind of bizarre , the whole incident. &quot; At least two students at the 675-student school , which serves grades six through eight , may be expelled as a result of the incident . Gerard said two students were suspended and face an expulsion hearing March 17 . Gerard doubts the students realized the potentially deadly act they were engaging in . &quot; I don ' t think they saw it as being anything serious or malicious . A typical kid thing , perhaps . I don ' t think there was any intent to create a health problem. &quot; Supt . Chet Caldeira said his &quot; biggest concern ( is ) the health of the students involved . We ' re just hopeful there is no contamination or spread of any disease because of this. &quot; Health officials said it is unlikely the students exposed themselves to the human_immunodeficiency_virus ( HIV ) or hepatitis_B by poking one another with the small needles , used by diabetics to prick the skin to get drops of blood to test for blood-sugar levels . &quot; There ' s a very , very small risk , &quot; said Dr. Shirley Fannin , director of disease-control programs for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services . &quot; This happens to be the group with the lowest level of hepatitis_B and the lowest level of HIV . The 5- to 14-year-old has the lowest prevalence in the county. &quot; At the same time , however , Fannin said , &quot; if you ' re looking_for reassurance that it couldn ' t possibly happen , that there would n ' t be exposure to hepatitis_B , I couldn ' t give that. &quot; The incident occurred Feb . 28 , although school officials did not become aware of it until the next day , when parents contacted the school , Caldeira said . The parents of the 21 students who are believed to have been pricked with the needles were advised by the school to seek medical assistance to test for hepatitis . As for HIV testing , officials said students should follow the advice of their doctors . &quot; We have contacted our insurance carrier , &quot; Caldeira said . &quot; The student insurance will be made available to those students who seek medical attention. &quot; Most parents are heeding the school ' s advice , he said . &quot; There ' s a high level of concern among parents for their children. &quot; Fannin recommended that the students who were pricked receive a tetanus booster , which the school started making available last week . A majority of the students have already taken_up the school ' s offer to receive the injection , Gerard said . As for HIV and hepatitis_B testing , Fannin said it will be some time before the students can do that . &quot; If you got a transmission of , say , hepatitis_B , the incubation_period is six weeks to six months , &quot; she said . &quot; With HIV , the earliest is three weeks and usually three months to six months. &quot; Besides the 21 students , the school ' s vice principal was accidentally poked with one of the needles as he was searching the student who brought them to school , Gerard said . In hopes of preventing a similar incident from occurring , Gerard said all_the students have been spoken_to about the seriousness of the incident . A letter was also sent to the entire student body .</TEXT>
