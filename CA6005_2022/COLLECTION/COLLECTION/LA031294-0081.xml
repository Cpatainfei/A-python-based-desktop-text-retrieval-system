   <TEXT> These are the unknown_soldiers in the battle for Palestine : Their graves lie covered by shifting sheets of grass under a wide sky . Their tombstones are four-digit numbers stenciled on haphazard rows of white signs . &quot; Cemetery for the Enemy ' s Fallen , &quot; says a hand-painted sign_on a barbed-wire fence ringing the graveyard . And Rabbi Zion , who carefully tends the cemetery and makes_sure its dead Muslims point southeast toward Mecca , wears a Jewish skullcap and the green fatigues of the Israel Defense Forces , or IDF . &quot; To my great regret , I know all_of these cases . This is the job of an IDF rabbi , &quot; Zion said , sighing as he stood among the graves on a recent afternoon while a jeep full of Israeli soldiers waited outside the fence . Unlike the graves lovingly dug by families for the Palestinians who died last month in a Hebron mosque , no one visits these . Their location is secret , and the cemetery has no name , though it is popularly known as the &quot; Cemetery for Trespassing Terrorists. &quot; Its silent inhabitants are unknown , except to the Israeli army , which says these stark , stenciled numbers identify Palestinians who died trying to infiltrate Israel ' s borders or commit acts of terrorism . In a small hilltop village miles from this windy graveyard , Badriyya Abdullah Sabah on Jan . 19 received official notice that her brother , Bassam , missing since 1984 , is buried beneath the white sign that has 5028 stenciled on it . Though the army has denied family requests to visit , the notice was the first indication of Bassam ' s whereabouts after nearly a decade of anxious searching , of visiting hospitals and prisons and filing requests for the return of his body , if he was indeed dead . &quot; The army ' s answer was always ' No , there ' s no body , ' &quot; Sabah said . &quot; Now , how do I know if this notice is correct ? I told the lawyer , if he ' s dead , let us go and visit the graveyard . I want to know 100 % that this is the case , so I can rest my mind . But it seems this is impossible. &quot; Long after Palestinians and Israelis sort_out the problems of the living , long after the delayed peace negotiations get_back on track , the fate of these dead men and hundreds of other Palestinians who disappeared in Israel and its occupied territories will remain a stumbling_block to any lasting Arab-Israeli peace . As Israel presses Syria and Lebanon for answers on six Israeli servicemen missing from the war in Lebanon , Arabs are raising their own case about missing Palestinians , some of whose families have searched for them since the 1967 Arab-Israeli War . At least 140 , and possibly as_many as 500 , Palestinians are unaccounted for in nearly 27 years of recent conflict . Reports about some of them have surfaced in mystifying fashion over the years : Someone ' s husband was seen in the orthopedic ward of a hospital in Jerusalem ; a brother was spotted in a prison by a friend ; a maid carried a secondhand message from a man long presumed dead saying he was alive and well but imprisoned -- all tantalizing details for which there is seldom any hard evidence . Israeli officials say they have no official statistics on missing Palestinians and have for years given_out information on those it knows about only in response to formal family requests submitted through the Red_Cross . Very few queries ever meet with a reply , and some families have unsuccessfully petitioned for information for years . But the army ' s recent willingness to publicize its two secret cemeteries -- the second is in northern Israel -- and its pledge to return bodies to any family that claims them through the Red_Cross have raised the prospect that the files of the Palestinian missing may , after nearly three decades , finally be closed . &quot; We heard there is a mission of the United States Congress to trace the Israeli missing , which are six persons . This mission should also be informed that there are also Palestinian missing . And they are not six persons . They are 140 or more , &quot; said Issa Hamed , head of the Arab Society for Tracing Missing Persons . &quot; Now , after the peace process and the Oslo agreement , people are starting to talk more about the missing . Before , there was no hope for them . But they think the peace process might help them , &quot; Hamed said . &quot; It gives them hope that , after this long_time , their suffering might be stopped. &quot; Other activists for the missing say they hope the fact that one of the cemeteries is near Jericho , the West_Bank city that will come under Palestinian self-rule in coming months if the peace process stays in motion , may allow families to visit the graves there for the first time . &quot; We want to know if they are going_to return the bodies to the families , to let the families bury them wherever they want to , and especially , if Jericho is going_to be an independent area , is it a place where families can now visit freely ? Are they going_to let them have a place where they can go and cry ? &quot; asked Dalia Kerstein , director of the Hamoked Center for the Defense of the Individual , a Jewish organization that has helped many Palestinian families trace prisoners and missing relatives . Israeli officials say any family that wishes to claim a body can do so through the Red_Cross ; so many go unclaimed , they say , because families may_not wish to associate themselves with a known terrorist . &quot; Israel has always given information on requests from the ICRC and other organizations on a one-to-one basis . Those that had families in the territories who wanted to claim the terrorist were given the bodies , &quot; said Lt . Col . Yehuda Weinraub , spokesman for the IDF . &quot; Many people from the other side ( in neighboring Jordan or Lebanon ) don ' t even request the information because in many countries , belonging_to such subversive organizations or having family members who do is not well looked on. &quot; Indeed , Sabah was detained and questioned by Israeli security services for four days after asking about her brother ' s whereabouts . The Israelis said he and two associates were killed on Sept . 14 , 1984 , while trying to mount a cross-border terrorist operation from Jordan . What did she know about the incident ? the officials asked . Sabah wasn ' t sure . Her brother , Bassam Abdullah Sabah Subih , had been living_in Jordan because he had been denied permission to live_in the family village of Mugheir near Ramallah . Sabah began inquiring about him when she read in a Jordanian newspaper that he had been killed while trying to cross into the West_Bank from Jordan . Another brother came_in from Kuwait and began asking questions of_his_own . As recently as December , he learned , someone claimed to have seen Bassam in Jerusalem ' s Hadassah Hospital . Kerstein , who investigated the case , said the alleged witness has remained anonymous , fearful of coming_forward : &quot; Bassam tells this anonymous person : ' My family doesn ' t know I ' m alive . Let them know I ' m alive . I ' m here for medical reasons . I will soon be taken_back to jail , where I am being held with 16 other persons . We never receive mail . We are never allowed visits . We supposedly don ' t exist. ' &quot; The army ' s response to Kerstein ' s inquiries was the notification that Bassam had been killed and was buried in the Jordan Valley cemetery . But without access to the body itself -- so far -- questions remain . &quot; There is the possibility that they caught him alive , and he died later under torture . When they keep the body , it ' s easy for them to say he was killed in an operation , &quot; said Issa Hamed , whose organization is also investigating the case . Kerstein is inquiring about another body at the Jordan Valley cemetery , allegedly that of a Palestinian man killed in a clash on Israel ' s northern border with Lebanon in 1991 . She has produced an affidavit from a witness who claims to have seen the man shortly after his disappearance in a prison service hospital at Ramle . Another witness swore_in an affidavit that he had received a letter from the man , written from prison . In response , the army said the man is indeed dead . &quot; We were given photographs -- terrible , terrible photographs -- of the three who were supposedly killed in the clash and buried , &quot; Kerstein said . &quot; The mother who came_to us is a Palestinian from Jordan . We contacted her , she came_to the bridge ( linking the West_Bank and Jordan ) , she was asked to identify her son from the photographs . She couldn ' t identify him . It was unrecognizable. &quot; Now , the army has agreed to open the grave where the man is supposedly buried and take a tissue sample that will be compared to the blood of the mother and her husband . Such cases have many families asking whether Israel is holding unidentified Palestinian prisoners for possible future exchanges . Reto Meister , chief of the Red_Cross delegation in Israel , said that while there are Lebanese detainees in Israel to which the organization has no access , there has been no evidence of Palestinians from the occupied territories being detained without record . Among Israel ' s known Lebanese prisoners is Shiite cleric Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid , kidnaped from his home_in southern Lebanon by Israeli commandos in 1989 as a possible hostage to exchange for missing Israeli airman Ron Arad . Arad , a captain and navigator shot down over Lebanon during a bombing raid in October , 1986 , is the only one of the six missing Israelis for whom there is some hope that he might be alive . &quot; For many years , Israel has had the procedure of handing_over the bodies of killed Palestinians to their families , &quot; Meister said . &quot; In recent cases , to our knowledge , there are no corpses that have been buried without notification to the family by Israeli authorities. &quot; Many Palestinian families , like the relatives of those missing in war anywhere , refuse to give_up hope that somewhere , their loved one is alive . Fowaz Abed Youssef Hamad , now 32 , was only 6 during the Six-Day War of 1967 when his father , a builder , left the family home_in East Jerusalem to buy milk on the third day of the war . Neighbors said later that Israeli forces had come_into the neighborhood , there had been a clash , and Hamad ' s father , Abed Youssef Hamad , had been shot in both legs . He was taken_away in a truck of wounded people , witnesses said . A few days later , relatives of the family in Ramallah were contacted by the Israeli army , who told them that they could pick_up Hamad from the Russian Compound jail in Jerusalem . But when the family went_to get him , he was not there . About three months later , some Jordanian soldiers visited the family and said Hamad had been in the hospital in Ramallah but had been taken by the Israeli army to another location . But they said they did not know where . There was no further word until 1990 , when an Arab cleaning_woman who works_at the Alyn Hospital for the Handicapped in Jerusalem spoke_to one of the family ' s neighbors . &quot; She said there was a man in the hospital by the name of our father , &quot; Fowaz said . &quot; He asked her to go and tell his wife that he was there . He gave her the names of his children -- our names . And the cleaning woman had many details . She knew that my mother ' s brother is a barber . She knew many things about our family no one else would know. &quot; The family went_to the hospital , but they were turned_away at the reception_desk . The Red_Cross followed up , according to the family , but received no indication that Hamad had been there . Desperate , one of Fowaz ' s uncles , who works as a garbage_collector for the city of Jerusalem , asked a Jewish co-worker to take a photograph of Hamad into the hospital . &quot; He talked to an Arab patient who was handicapped , and he asked him how long he had been there . He said , ' Since the ' 67 war , ' &quot; Fowaz recounted . &quot; He showed him the picture and said , ' Do you know this man ? ' He said , ' Yes , he ' s inside. ' So the Jewish man wanted to go and look_for him , but a soldier caught him and said , ' What are you doing ? ' He said , ' I have work in there. ' But the soldier said , ' No , your work is outside. ' &quot; Again , the family gave_up until a year ago , when they went_back to the Red_Cross , which did a computer search of the names of all known prisoners . Hamad ' s name wasn ' t among them . &quot; The Red_Cross says for_sure he must be dead , &quot; Fowaz said . &quot; They tell us : ' Why would you think he ' s in the hospital out there ? Why would the Israelis even want him ? He wasn ' t a soldier in the ' 67 war. ' But me , I believe he ' s still alive . My opinion is they don ' t want to release him because then he is going_to start talking_about what happened to him . And people would start to realize that there are other people like my father. &quot; To this faint hope Fowaz clings , as do his sister , an elementary-school teacher who was only a baby when Hamad disappeared , and Hamad ' s wife , who is still dressed in black , as she has been every day since her husband left to buy milk 27 years ago . &quot; We read in the newspapers that there are 500 families like this , who don ' t have answers , &quot; Fowaz said . &quot; I want to forget , but I can ' t . I have to keep looking_for him . If I know he ' s really dead , then I won ' t go_on looking_for him anymore. &quot; Issa Hamed of the Arab Society for Tracing Missing Persons said that opening the files on those buried in the secret cemeteries might be the first_step in determining the fate of the missing . Families want records not only of who has died , he said , but of when and how . His own brother , Abdel Nasser Hamed , disappeared when Israeli forces on April 28 , 1985 , thwarted a navy operation by Fatah -- the dominant wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization -- aimed at killing Israel ' s defense minister . Hamed met with eight Palestinian prisoners who survived the operation and who said his brother had safely jumped_off their ship after it was hit by Israeli missiles . The Israelis picked_up all survivors and took them to prison , but kept them apart for 101 days . No one saw Hamed after that , but Issa Hamed believes it is possible that his brother is being held for exchange . Israeli authorities deny this ; they say the Red_Cross has contacted all survivors . Hamed said full details about those buried in the secret cemeteries , not just responses to individual inquiries from the Red_Cross , may help resolve doubts like his . &quot; The Geneva_Convention says you have to send the family a death certificate , &quot; he said , &quot; including all_the information about the place of death , the date of death , the reason of death . Place of burial , date of burial . And none of this has been complied with. &quot;</TEXT>
