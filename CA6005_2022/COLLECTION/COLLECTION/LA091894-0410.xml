   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL LOW-DOWN REPORT ; 25 WAYS TO TURN $ 10 # 000 INTO A HOUSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the most daunting obstacles facing Southland home_buyers has been the hefty down_payment . But that ' s changing . The traditional 20 % down formula is giving_way to plethora of private and government programs that ease the down_payment shock . Five percent , 3 % and even nothing-down loans are becoming the alternative for many buyers as private industry and government team_up to help more people into homeownership . As a result , with a little luck , some patience and one of the programs described below , it ' s now possible to get_into a first home for $ 10 # 000 down . And the $ 10 # 000 might be easier to raise than you thought . See the accompanying story on page K5 for some tips on how to do that . Among the low-down programs are old-time favorites such_as FHA and VA , as well as a raft of new programs , such_as the city of Santa Ana mortgage for high_school grads who earn a four-year college degree and return home to buy a house . And both the state of California and a big stock brokerage are offering separate programs that link a parents ' assets to a nothing-down program for their children . Other programs are targeted at veterans , public employees or buyers who are willing to purchase homes_in distressed neighborhoods . City of Los Angeles homeownership specialist Linda Buckspan points_out that borrowers must fit the &quot; narrow window &quot; that each of these programs offers . &quot; Not every program is for everyone , but together there is an opportunity for a lot of people , &quot; she said . The lowest down_payments often require excellent credit ; and with all_of the loans , borrowers must meet the qualifying criteria , which often includes employment history , income and credit history . Prospective borrowers should also be patient . The low-down programs are often a complex combination of federal , state and local funding , which can complicate the underwriting process , require more scrutiny of borrowers ' credit histories and slow the approval process . But hang_in there , it can be done . Here are 25 ways to turn $ 10 # 000 into a house : 1 -- FHA : The Low-Down Leader The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development offers a variety of mortgage insurance programs through the FHA , which requires about 3 % to 4 % cash down . There are no income requirements to qualify for a FHA mortgage . Other advantages are that FHA loans do not contain prepayment penalties , and in some cases they are assumable by qualified purchasers . FHA loan limits vary depending_on the county where the property is located . Recently , the FHA loan limit was increased to $ 151 # 725 for single-family homes , but only in high-cost areas such_as Los Angeles . FHA does not lend money ; it insures mortgages . FHA loans are made by a bank , savings and loan , mortgage company or other FHA-approved lender . In addition , FHA does not set the rates and points . The lender determines these , so it is best to shop around by calling several FHA-approved lenders . Call the Los Angeles HUD office at ( 213 ) 251-7122 for more information . 2 -- Vets Apply More_than 2.9 million California veterans and service personnel are eligible to participate in the Veterans Administration Home Loan Guarantee Program , which in most cases requires no down_payment . VA loans can be used to buy a home , build a home , improve a home or to refinance an existing loan . After issuing a certificate of eligibility to the vet , the VA guarantees the loan to the lender up_to $ 184 # 000 . VA loans frequently offer lower interest_rates than ordinarily available with other kinds of loans . To qualify for a loan , the first_step is to complete a Certificate of Eligibility ( Form 26-1880 ) . Call ( 800 ) 827-1000 for more information . 3 -- More Help for California Vets Veterans also can find financing through the state Cal-Vet home loan program , which offers low- or no-down payment mortgages , a low interest_rate and no loan origination_fees . The maximum loan amount for single-family homes_in Los Angeles County is $ 198 # 700 ; $ 220 # 400 in Orange County and $ 203 # 800 in most other Southland counties . For more information , contact Cal-Vet at ( 800 ) 952-5626 . 4 -- No Down for Government Workers The CalPERS Member Home Loan program is offered by the California Public Employees Retirement System ( PERS ) , which invests pension_funds for state and local_government employees . PERS offers a standard 5 % down program and a no-down option for members who currently work for the government and meet other qualifying criteria . To get 100 % financing , members must take_out a personal_loan for 5 % of the purchase_price or the appraised value , whatever is less . This is a personal_loan , secured by the member ' s retirement contributions , and must be paid_back . These funds are used to reduce the down_payment to zero . For more information , call Lomas Mortgage , which services the loans , and can be reached at ( 800 ) 874-PERS . 5 -- 3 % Down for First-Time ( and Other ) Home_Buyers The state-sanctioned California Housing Loan Insurance Fund is offering 97 % loans , which are originated by private lenders . The loan program is a partnership between the California Housing Loan Insurance Fund , Commonwealth Mortgage Assurance Corp. , Federal National Mortgage Assn . and several California mortgage bankers . Borrowers do not have to be first-time home_buyers ; however , they cannot own any other real_estate when they apply for the loan . The maximum loan amount is $ 203 # 150 .

County Pays Costs The County of Los Angeles Homeowner ' s Assistance Program offers low-down loans to home_buyers who purchase houses in 62 targeted neighborhoods that the county wants to stabilize and increase homeownership rates . Therefore , some of the communities are high-crime areas . The typical down_payment is 5 % , but the county pays 1.5 points to the borrower to cover loan costs such_as points and fees .
