   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : FEMA GRANT EXTENDS ' GHOST_TOWN ' PATROLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Federal Emergency Management Agency has granted Los Angeles an additional $ 3.6 million to help prevent earthquake-ravaged &quot; ghost_towns &quot; from becoming overrun by vandals , officials announced Wednesday . The grant provides welcome financial relief for the city , which found itself footing the bill to keep security_guards from walking_off the job at 15 ghost_towns after previous FEMA funds ran_dry . Most of the ghost_towns are in the San Fernando Valley . &quot; If we didn ' t have these funds , the vandals would be taking_over these properties , &quot; said Robert Moncrief , major projects manager for the city ' s Housing Department , which oversees the security patrols . &quot; This will . . . ensure that the ghost_towns have a chance to recover. &quot; The funding extends a program begun last summer by city officials to board_up , fence off , clean_up and hire private security for about 150 damaged buildings that were abandoned after the Northridge earthquake . FEMA provided $ 2.8 million for the effort , which officials hoped would be enough to prepare the buildings for rehabilitation . Despite boarding_up more_than 100 of the damaged structures , however , the city began exhausting FEMA funds by Oct . 31 , said Diedre Reyes of the city ' s Administrative Office . &quot; It took more time to get the construction going . You have to get the owners going . You have to motivate people to repair their property , &quot; Reyes said . The city was forced to pay the private patrol bill , as well as for city work crews assigned to clean_up the ghost_towns . With support from U.S. Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) , city officials asked FEMA for funding to extend the ghost_town program to April 30 , 1995 , including $ 480 # 000 for the security patrols . Community leaders praised FEMA ' s decision . &quot; The only thing that deters crime in these ghost_towns is the security_guards , &quot; said Harry Coleman , president of a citizens advisory group in North Hills , where one of the ghost_towns is located . &quot; It behooves us to repair or refinance to get those boarded-up buildings back in circulation fast enough to stop the bleeding. &quot; At least two guards and one patrol_car have been assigned to each ghost_town 24 hours a day . Additional crime problems in North Hills prompted the city to add even more security there , including a mounted unit that occasionally patrols the streets . To help speed the recovery , Berman said he may seek more quake-relief funds when Congress reconvenes early next year . JEFF SCHNAUFER</TEXT>
