   <HEADLINE> FOUR MORE YEARS FOR ROTHENBERG ; SOCCER : FIFA INFLUENCE FELT AS WORLD CUP ' 94 CHIEF IS REELECTED ON SECOND BALLOT IN CLOSE USSF PRESIDENTIAL RACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alan Rothenberg narrowly won reelection to his second four-year term as president of the U.S. Soccer Federation on Saturday , thanks in large measure to the intervention of FIFA , the sport ' s international governing body . Facing a battle for his political life , Rothenberg called_in all_of his favors . That meant bringing_in the most powerful man in soccer , Brazil ' s Joao Havelange , the FIFA president , who spent the weekend campaigning for Rothenberg . Even with FIFA ' s help , Rothenberg did not gain the landslide victory he had predicted . Needing 51 % of the vote to win , Rothenberg polled 48.8 % on the first ballot . USSF treasurer Richard Groff had 46.9 % and USSF executive_vice_president Hank des Bordes had 4.2 % . During the 20-minute second vote , the huge hotel ballroom grew quiet and tense . &quot; Somebody told me that penalty kicks were bad , &quot; U.S. World Cup Coach Bora Milutinovic , a Rothenberg supporter , said during the lull . &quot; This is worse. &quot; Des Bordes withdrew after the first vote and Rothenberg prevailed on the second ballot , 53.4 % to 46.6 % . Despite the success of the World Cup , which he helped organize , Rothenberg has been a controversial figure within the USSF during his four-year team . His current difficulty centers_on Rothenberg ' s twin positions as president of the USSF and head of the proposed new professional league , Major_League Soccer . Many within the USSF , particularly from the pro division , see this as a conflict_of_interest . The pro vote , which delivered the election to Rothenberg in 1990 , nearly cost him the presidency this time . The three voting blocks -- professional , amateur and youth -- split among the candidates . Only one of the four pro leagues voted for Rothenberg . His strength came from the amateur division and Groff took most of the pro vote and some of the youth . Havelange ' s unprecedented attendance here has angered some delegates who resent FIFA ' s interference in the election . Most voters remember FIFA ' s support for Rothenberg ' s election in 1990 . FIFA ' s role then consisted merely of a phone_call to one presidential candidate , asking him to withdraw from the race . FIFA ' s role in this election has been far more open . At a banquet Friday night , Havelange spoke_for several minutes and lavished praise on Rothenberg , mentioning him by name some 16 times . On an evening that was meant to celebrate the sport of soccer in the United States , Havelange ' s nomination speech seemed out_of_place . Even Rothenberg admitted that Havelange ' s dinner speech lacked subtlety and ran the risk of backfiring -- USSF delegates might not have appreciated an international body meddling in the internal politics of a member federation . &quot; It was a little heavier-handed than I would have written it , &quot; Rothenberg said . &quot; I was cringing. &quot; Earlier in the day , Havelange had summoned candidate Des Bordes to his hotel_room . Speculation was that FIFA would request that Des Bordes , who had little chance to win , withdraw . Des Bordes would not reveal what was said but reiterated late Friday night that he was still in the race . However , Des Bordes dropped_out after the first ballot . Further fueling the FIFA-deal theory , apparently all_of Des Bordes ' delegates went_over to Rothenberg on the second ballot . Groff , for all_of his conciliatory talk after the vote , was clearly angry with the FIFA influence on the outcome . &quot; FIFA is very insensitive to the operation of individuals with their constituents in the United States Soccer Federation , &quot; Groff said . &quot; They didn ' t need to push so hard . FIFA is so scared to death that if Alan is not in front of MLS , it won ' t succeed . &quot; They took that one step further -- if Alan is not president of the U.S. Soccer Federation , MLS won ' t succeed . It was all totally inappropriate. &quot; Havelange and FIFA senior_vice_president Guillermo Canedo were present to observe Saturday morning ' s voting , but their interest apparently extended only to observing the presidential election . Havelange briefly addressed delegates before the vote , then left the room immediately after Rothenberg was reelected . Rothenberg ' s reelection , whatever it might hold for the future of soccer , does seem to settle the issue of Milutinovic ' s future . Milutinovic would have been unlikely to remain as national coach had Rothenberg lost the election .</TEXT>
