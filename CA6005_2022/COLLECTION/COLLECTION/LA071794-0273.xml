   <HEADLINE> PROMISING THE MOON ; LUNAR ROCKS TO BE STARS OF PROGRAM BY FORMER NASA SCIENTIST ON ANNIVERSARY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1969 , after global fascination with the first manned lunar landing had cooled , the scientific community still needed a_few things explained . There were questions , legends and myths about the moon that had existed ever since human_beings first stood erect and stared in awe at the strange , bright orb hanging_in the night sky . How did_it get there ? Is life on the moon possible ? Green cheese or igneous_rock ? &quot; There was intense , worldwide interest in the answers held by the moon rocks . It was an extremely exciting time , &quot; said Douglas Nash , 61 , who was part of an elite group of NASA scientists assigned to answer age-old scientific questions about the moon . &quot; It ' s amazing what heroes our scientists were back then. &quot; As the 25th anniversary of Neil Armstrong ' s historic moon walk is observed around the globe this week , Nash , who now directs the San Juan Institute , a San Juan Capistrano-based think_tank , clearly remembers the excitement of waiting for the first crate of moon rocks to be released from quarantine in Houston . But , he also shakes his head and wonders where in the cosmos has Washington ' s support for space exploration gone_in recent years . &quot; You couldn ' t convince me 25 years ago that we would n ' t be back to the moon several times , &quot; Nash said . &quot; The tragedy is that generations of scientists who have all that knowledge from the early Apollo era are about to retire . All that knowledge will be lost. &quot; With the July 20 anniversary approaching , however , Nash doesn ' t have time for bittersweet memories . He is busy preparing a special , free program at the San Juan Institute for Wednesday that will include a display of moon samples from all six Apollo missions . The daylong event will feature lectures from scientists about lunar exploration and a telescopic peek at the moon . For Nash , the program will be a chance to share his experiences during one of the most historic and significant chapters in space exploration . &quot; This was a big , big event for us , &quot; he said . &quot; The Apollo 11 mission was the first to bring_back lunar samples , and security was tight . Where the rocks were kept we had motion detectors , special locks and closed_circuit television. &quot; The first time Nash took the lunar specimens on a trip , it was like a page from a bad spy novel . &quot; I had escorts , &quot; he said . &quot; The moon rocks were in a suitcase with a chain shackled to my wrist. &quot; George Mueller , an administrator in NASA ' s Manned Space Flight division at the time , said the Apollo 11 launch was the zenith of the country ' s technological achievements . He hopes the anniversary will rekindle public interest in the space_program , but Mueller wonders if elected officials in Washington would commit more money . &quot; To me , it ' s interesting that we ' ve been consigning our space exploration to history before we ' ve started , &quot; said the 71-year-old Santa Barbara resident , who is now president of the International Academy of Astronautics . &quot; That first_step is a very small first_step when you think_of space exploration. &quot; Although much mystery still surrounds the moon , Nash and his fellow NASA scientists solved many moon riddles just a_few weeks after getting their hands on the lunar samples . &quot; A couple of the major questions were answered very quickly , such_as how old the moon is , &quot; Nash said . &quot; Through radioactive dating techniques , we determined that the moon is about 4 1 / 2 billion years old. &quot; As to where the moon came from , studies of lunar rocks have contributed to the theory that the planet was produced by a collision involving primitive Earth . When Earth was still a seething mixture of semi-solid rock and magma , Nash said , a very large object , maybe a tenth of the size of the globe , probably crashed into it , ejecting enough material to form the moon . The moon samples themselves are a mix of orthosite , a type of stone found in the Earth ' s mantle , and basaltic rock , a volcanic material similar to that commonly seen in Hawaii and Iceland . One major difference , though , between Earth and moon rock is that , unlike their terrane counterparts , moon stones are completely devoid_of water . &quot; The moon samples were found to be degassed , missing all volatile material such_as water , &quot; Nash said . &quot; It probably happened during the impact that formed the moon. &quot; As a young scientist working for the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Nash submitted a proposal to NASA along with hundreds of other researchers in hopes of being considered for the moon project . To his delight , NASA chose him to be one of about 100 scientists assigned to the high profile Apollo 11 program . His project : Find_out why the moon appears so luminescent , despite studies indicating that the earthly satellite is basically a dark object . Nash soon found_out that billions of years of bombardment by microscopic meteorites had caused rock on the moon ' s surface to vitrify . The heat caused by innumerable meteor impacts melted the stone over time , turning it glassy and highly reflective . &quot; We saw that the rocks had little ' zap ' pits in them , &quot; he said . &quot; It was the first direct_evidence of micrometeor impacts . Immense heat_energy was caused by these impacts because these tiny meteors , which would normally burn_up in our atmosphere , were landing at extremely high velocities of 10 to 20 kilometers per second. &quot; Twenty-five years after being plucked from the lunar surface , the moon rocks are still helping Nash understand the cosmos with the help of new technology that was unavailable during the height of the Apollo_program . One of them is infrared testing to determine what elements a rock is composed of . &quot; It will help us map the moon ' s surface in more detail than ever before , &quot; Nash said . &quot; This is important because more_than 95 % of the moon ' s surface is unexplored. &quot;</TEXT>
