   <HEADLINE> FBI ARRESTS FATHER , SON IN CD-ROM PIRACY PROBE ; SOFTWARE : THOUSANDS OF COUNTERFEIT COMPUTER_GAMES ARE SEIZED IN THE FIRST MAJOR CASE OF ITS KIND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first major case of CD-ROM piracy in the United States , the FBI said Thursday that it has seized thousands of counterfeit copies of the popular CD-ROM computer_games &quot; Rebel Assault &quot; and &quot; Myst &quot; and prevented the production of tens of thousands of additional copies . A father and son who authorities say were the alleged masterminds behind the operation were arrested in Buffalo , N.Y. , and charged with two felony counts of copyright infringement . Peter Misko , 63 , of Mississauga , Canada , is free on $ 15 # 000 bail ; his son Bruce Misko , 36 , of Chicago is free on $ 25 # 000 bail . Whereas theft of diskette-based computer software has long been relatively commonplace in the United States , authorities say that counterfeit CD-ROMs -- which are much harder to produce than diskettes -- are just now beginning to appear in the U.S. software market in large quantities . The FBI is continuing a sting operation aimed at CD-ROM counterfeiters , and officials said additional warrants were served Thursday in Indiana and New Hampshire as part of a crackdown on retail_stores selling the bogus software . More arrests are expected . Software companies have been up in arms about piracy for years , and they are dismayed -- if not surprised -- to see the problem spread to the increasingly popular CD-ROM format . The specialized equipment needed to duplicate CD-ROMs has grown dramatically cheaper in the past year . &quot; We are now beginning to see counterfeit copies of our mainstream CD-ROM applications being sold here , including Microsoft Office , Encarta and Bookshelf , for a fraction of their retail value , &quot; said Alison Gilligan , senior anti-piracy specialist for Microsoft Corp . &quot; As more and more PCs become multimedia-capable , the counterfeiters will focus_on multimedia CD-ROM applications where there is money to be made. &quot; Robert Roden , general counsel for LucasArts Entertainment Co. , which makes &quot; Rebel Assault , &quot; said the company , working with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , tracked the alleged CD-ROM pirates through a complex series of dummy corporations in several Canadian cities before it brought_in the FBI when the trail led to Buffalo . George Lucas , producer of the &quot; Star Wars &quot; film trilogy and owner of LucasArts , recently vowed to vigorously protect the firm ' s copyrights and trademarks . &quot; We don ' t take any form of piracy lightly , including software piracy , &quot; he said in a statement .</TEXT>
