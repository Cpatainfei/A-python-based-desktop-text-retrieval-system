   <TEXT> Eleven-thousand years after extinction , Ice_Age pygmy mammoths were making news in 1994 . Last summer -- in a discovery that one expert called &quot; spectacular &quot; -- scientists unearthed the most complete skeleton of the species ever found anywhere in the world . While paleontologists rejoiced , you were probably less interested in the pygmy mammoth than the fact that it was discovered on Santa Rosa Island , a mere 30 miles off the Ventura County coast . Is it possible , you wondered ? Could the county be a prehistoric fossil graveyard ? &quot; It ' s true , &quot; said Ray Meisenheimer , a longtime Ventura fossil hunter . &quot; The county is sitting on a fossil bed . Practically anyplace you go , you can find a fossil. &quot; You may be inspired right now to start digging for dinosaur bones in your back yard -- would n ' t a Allosaurus rib look great on the coffee_table ? -- but postpone excavation until you read this . It takes more_than a field trip to &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; to become a fossil hunter . &quot; You can ' t learn fossil hunting at the movies , &quot; Meisenheimer , 78 , said with a chuckle . The education of a fossil hunter requires a study of geology , zoology and botany . Which is why no self-respecting fossil hunter would ever look_for dinosaur remains in Ventura County : Dinosaurs were extinct for perhaps 50 million years before the county emerged from the sea . &quot; Fossil hunting is a great hobby , &quot; said Bruno Benson , Meisenheimer ' s 80-year-old buddy and curator of the tiny Ventura Earth_Science Museum . &quot; But you really have to know what you ' re doing. &quot; To a fossil hunter , fossils are records of life on Earth , helping explain why some species vanished and others survived . Seldom are complete remains found . Instead , fossil hunters have to use bits of mineralized bone or shell or impressions embedded in rock to decipher the past . While some fossils literally can be picked_off the ground , the rare ones , those that will be displayed under glass , are hidden , but sometimes only centimeters beneath the surface . A fossil hunter has to be a detective , following clues and hunches , but relying_on knowledge . Fossil hunting also rewards hunters by giving them a deeper perspective on_their_own place in the universe . &quot; Knowing the past gives me a feeling of continuity , &quot; said Ed Mercurio , a paleontologist with expertise in fossils found in the county . &quot; I can be in a place and know exactly what it was like millions of years ago and what the animals faced for survival . It ' s like seeing things in 3-D. &quot; Paleontologists are the major leaguers among fossil hunters . Working under government permits allowing them to hunt on public land , they bag the dramatic prehistoric trophies , the Cro-Magnon skull , the T-Rex jawbone , even the Santa Rosa Island pygmy mammoth . Although amateur fossil hunters have made major discoveries , county hunters go_after smaller game : fossils usually no bigger than pocket change . This disappoints many beginners , but it shouldn ' t . Fossil hunters will tell you that size has nothing to do with the thrill of discovery . Some hunters , Bruno Benson included , even prefer micro-fossils . The rush comes from finding a rare fossil , but even an ordinary fossil , no matter how small , can excite the_hunter . &quot; When you find something that ' s 5 or 10 million years old -- something that was once alive -- and when you ' re the first_person who ' s ever seen it , it ' s just the greatest feeling , &quot; Meisenheimer said . A fossil doesn ' t even have to be rare to be prized . &quot; If it ' s your first fossil , it ' s very valuable to you , &quot; said Dave Champion , an Oxnard fossil hunter . You could read a_few books , buy a good map and become a fossil hunter on_your_own , but the best way to forge ahead is by getting_in_touch with any of the three clubs in the county . Your first lesson will include some basic facts : The Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago ; life began a_billion years or so later . As_many as 50 million species of plants and animals may have existed ; scientists have named and described only about 1.7 million , but you are not required to memorize all_of them . The oldest fossils found in the county are starfish and sand_dollars in the Pine Mountain area north of Ojai . They date to the Eocene Period , perhaps 55 million years ago , when seawater covered most of Southern California . About 25 million years ago , underwater volcanoes and tectonic forces began forming mountain_ranges , lifting the county from the sea . Ice_ages occurred every few hundred-thousand years , raising ocean levels and inundating the county . Glaciers , however , never paid a visit . The county ' s aquatic history left a large assortment of deep-water marine fossils . Some of the best specimens discovered in the county were actually found on what were once ancient sand beaches in a Simi Valley canyon : giant alligators , whale skeletons as long as 40 feet , and an extremely rare seven-inch tooth from an ancestor of a great_white_shark . Today in the same area , basketball-sized vertebrae from 15-million-year-old baleen_whales await the knowing fossil hunter . &quot; Once you know what to look_for , they ' re pretty easy to find , but if you don ' t , you ' d probably pass_up a lot of them , &quot; said Mercurio , who found the shark ' s tooth in 1961 and loaned it to the Los Angeles County Natural_History Museum . Mercurio considers area a marvel of paleontological diversity . &quot; What ' s fascinating about Ventura County , &quot; said Mercurio , who has a master ' s degree from UCLA and teaches at Hartnell Community_College in Salinas , &quot; is that you can walk through time , from Paleocene up_to Pleistocene , from underwater formations to tropical_rain_forest , in just a single canyon. &quot; In the 1930s , Las Posas Hills in Camarillo yielded one of the country ' s largest mammal fields . According to &quot; Rock &amp; Gem &quot; magazine , &quot; Among the numerous finds were early saber-toothed cats , an early rhinoceros , primitive carnivores , a primitive hedgehog and an early lemur monkey. &quot; Evidence of prehistoric horses and camels is also found in the county . &quot; The horse originated_in ( what is now ) the United States , became extinct and was brought_back by the Spanish , &quot; said Meisenheimer , who has found horse teeth in Camarillo . An example of a tiny fossil on everybody ' s wish list is the Ventura County starfish . Collectors worldwide prize the well-preserved remains of the four-inch creature , which has five slender arms . Pursued by many , the starfish is elusive . &quot; It can be found , &quot; Meisenheimer said , &quot; but not by me . I wish I had one. &quot; Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties are also as rich as Ventura County in fossils . The region ' s most famous fossil graveyard is the LaBrea Tar_Pits in Los Angeles . Old-timers also recall one in Carpinteria . But in the 1920s , the_pit became a town dump and the tar was used to build roads ; today , it ' s a parking_lot , asphalt covering its secrets . Along canyons , washes and road cuts , rains can wash fossils from their hiding_places , exposing them for easy collection . Although fossil hunters are out_in force after a rain , they don ' t do much surface hunting -- the best specimens get nabbed in a hurry . The time-honored practice of digging with a small trowel or scratching the dirt with a three-pronged hand rake pays_off for experienced collectors , who usually limit their search to an area of five or six yards . &quot; You have to do a lot of crunching around on your hands and knees , &quot; Mercurio said . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) ' Fossil Petting Zoo ' the Place to Learn The best way to get involved in fossil hunting ? &quot; Call Bruno , &quot; said Dave Champion , a fossil hunter from Oxnard . Bruno Benson , 80 , is the curator of Ventura ' s Earth_Science Museum , nicknamed a &quot; fossil petting zoo. &quot; Benson and the museum ' s owner , the Ventura Gem &amp; Mineral Society , are eager to initiate the public into the joys of fossil hunting . &quot; we ' ll open the museum for one person , &quot; Benson said . &quot; Anybody who wants to start_up , we ' ll be glad to help , &quot; said Ray Meisenheimer , a museum volunteer . The museum , housed in an old home off Ventura Avenue , is crammed with fossils , most from the county . Glass cases displaying small marine fossils are overpowered by vertebrate remains , like the hefty thigh bone of a 10-foot-long sea creature called Desmostylia , discovered near Oak View . The society has a traveling fossil collection for schools and also sponsors field trips for students . &quot; Kids are good for 45 minutes in the field , &quot; Meisenheimer said . &quot; Then , you know kids . The minute they can ' t find a fossil , they start wandering off. &quot; The museum is free . Schools can take tours by appointment . The Ventura club supplied the fossils for the Gull Wings Children ' s Museum in Oxnard . Although Gull Wings offers many other innovative hands-on activities for children , the fossil pit is popular , enabling kids to find fossils buried in sand . &quot; They can ' t wait to find the shark tooth , &quot; said Jeanne Taylor , assistant director of the museum . &quot; And the older kids get , the more they like to find stuff. &quot; LOCAL CONTACTS All three gem and mineral clubs in the county -- Ventura , Oxnard and Conejo -- have fossil collectors among their members . The clubs often take combined field trips and sponsor children ' s programs . * Conejo Gem &amp; Mineral Club -- 498-4220 * Oxnard Gem &amp; Mineral Club -- 483-6871 * Ventura Gem &amp; Mineral Society ( Bruno Benson ) -- 646-5976 * Gull Wings Children ' s Museum -- 483-3005 . 418 W . 4th St. , Oxnard . Admission : $ 3 adults , $ 2 children .</TEXT>
