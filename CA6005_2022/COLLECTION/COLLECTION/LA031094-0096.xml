   <HEADLINE> A DELICATE TUG OF WAR ON TRADE ; JAPAN : SUPER 301 IS A FLEXIBLE WEAPON , BUT ITS PROCEDURES , ONCE INVOKED , ARE NOT , AND MAY HURT US IN THE END .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher arrives in Tokyo for meetings following the failure of the summit between President Clinton and Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa , the United States is in uncharted territory in its relations with Japan . Some Japan experts caution that the United States has gone too far in insisting on numerical targets as a way of assuring progress toward reduction of the trade_deficit between the two countries . They worry about the effect of the no-pulled-punches trade negotiations , particularly at a time when the Pacific Rim is fixated on North_Korea ' s nuclear intentions . Others say that the United States must stay the course in its hard line . They and their supporters on Capitol_Hill argue that the time has come_to make Japan pay_for its unwillingness to reduce the trade_deficit by invoking the newly revived Super 301 provision and imposing stiff sanctions . Neither approach gives adequate weight to the central fact of the current predicament . While Hosokawa offers the best hope in decades for reform of Japan ' s economy , reduction of Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States is not one of his top priorities . First on his list is reform of the political_system , which is only indirectly related to economic issues . But another top priority , his struggle to reduce the power of Japan ' s bureaucrats , is of enormous significance to American businesses seeking to crack the Japanese market . While there are many explanations for the fact that Japan has unusually low levels of manufactured imports and intra-industry trade for an economy of its size , one of the most important is the pervasive extent of government regulation in Japan . The notion that foreign skis were kept_out on the basis that &quot; Japanese snow is different &quot; is incredible to non-Japanese , but reflects the almost untrammeled discretion and authority of the central government bureaucracy . Much of that authority is exercised through confidential and &quot; informal &quot; administrative guidance , which is no less binding for its informality . One problem that Hosokawa faces in his push for deregulation is a dearth of practical advice on the issue . There is not yet a Japanese equivalent of an American Enterprise Institute or Brookings , where academics and former officials churn_out hard-headed policy advice . Instead , Hosokawa must rely_on the bureaucrats , most of whom would be disinclined to help the prime_minister deregulate even if they knew how . This is an area in which the United States has plenty of experience . In due course , the Japanese will informally seek our advice . We cannot force it upon them . In the meantime , Hosokawa must find his own way . His path won ' t be easy . He has provoked the wrath not only of the bureaucrats , but of the other two groups that share the credit for much of Japan ' s postwar economic success -- politicians and business . His political reform proposals threatened the electoral prospects of many current members of the Diet , and he was forced to accept a severe compromise after his shaky coalition in the Diet failed to support him on the issue . Businesses that have prospered within the strictures of a highly regulated system also feel threatened by his reforms . A recent ill-considered proposal to increase Japan ' s consumption tax hurt Hosokawa with the voters . As a result , Hosokawa ' s grip on power is tenuous at best . He cannot afford to appear to surrender to U.S. trade demands and give his enemies at_home another stick_with which to beat him . Where , then , do we go from here ? Must the United States back_off and again settle for vague assurances of market reforms ? Or should we keep swinging ? It would be counterproductive for the United States to abandon its insistence on verifiable measures of progress in the opening of Japan ' s markets . In view of the dismal results of past trade talks , and domestic political pressures , Clinton needs Japan to go at least that far . But it would be self-defeating for the United States to provoke a no-win confrontation with Hosokawa that wounds him politically . While many Japanese want a prime_minister who will stand_up to the United States , most would judge harshly one who could not forestall a public rift in relations . What is required on the U.S. side is a measured application of pressure for reform in Japan . U.S. pressure applied at the right time can strengthen Hosokawa ' s hand in his dealings with his Cabinet and the bureaucracy , and allow him to play &quot; good cop &quot; to the U.S government ' s &quot; bad cop. &quot; Pressure applied in a heavy-handed manner or at the wrong time can make_it appear in Japan that Hosokawa is pursuing the U.S. agenda rather than his own , thereby crippling his efforts . The intricate timing required in this exercise calls into question the wisdom of invoking Super 301 against Japan , as it forces negotiations to conform_to its timetable . The threat of invoking Super 301 is a flexible weapon ; its procedures , once invoked , are less so . In its timing and tone , U.S. pressure needs to reflect a close reading of Japanese politics . We need a nuanced policy toward Japan , but it remains to be seen whether we have the patience and fortitude to formulate and implement one . Hosokawa represents a historic opportunity for the United States in its dealings with Japan . If we miss this chance , we are unlikely to have as good an opportunity for years to come .</TEXT>
