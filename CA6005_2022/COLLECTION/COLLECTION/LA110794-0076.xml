   <HEADLINE> COMMITMENTS : TWO ' S COMPANY , FRIENDS A CROWD ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles family therapist Marcia Lasswell knows how to spot married_couples who are so closely bonded they might as well be attached with super glue . &quot; You can spot them at parties , &quot; says Lasswell , president-elect of the American Assn . for Marriage and Family Therapy . &quot; When a hostess wants to seat them separately , they want to sit together . And the women won ' t dance with anyone but their husbands . They ' re almost attached at the hip. &quot; Other closely bonded couples go as far as dressing alike , even sewing matching husband-and-wife outfits . While these examples may be extreme , many couples are so content with their relationship that they do not seek friendships outside of their marriage . &quot; I have everything I could want in one person , &quot; says Loretta Pafford , 45 , a Santa Clarita office assistant . &quot; I was looking_for a good buddy and a friend and the person who could be everything in my life . And I ' ve got him . He ' s like a gift. &quot; Pafford is so close to Roger , her husband of 17 years , that she says she &quot; feels_like his heartbeat. &quot; Mabel De Salvo , 35 , a post_office clerk who lives_in Covina , happily admits she feels the need to invite guests to her home no more_than once or twice a year . Her husband of seven years , Russell , is her &quot; best_friend , buddy , playmate and enemy when we fight , &quot; she says . They have two children . Dr. Marilyn Ruman , a psychologist who works with families and individuals in Encino , says several factors produce these kinds of exclusive relationships . First , there is the difficulty of bringing_outside friendships into the marriage . &quot; Couples end_up on_their_own because they ' re unable to mix and match their friendships , &quot; Ruman says . Especially when couples marry later , old friends who don ' t hit it off with the new spouse may gradually be dropped . &quot; You have couples who really enjoy one another ' s company most of all , &quot; she says . &quot; We often hear about couples who lament how it ' s hard to find others they both can relate to. &quot; In addition , Ruman says , these kinds of self-contained relationships are part of the cocooning trend that keeps many modern couples home alone . Rather than deal with traffic and crime , they would rather stay in and spend their limited free_time with each other . Even if one were willing to cultivate new friendships , what with juggling careers , children and running a household , who has the energy or inclination ? Not Loretta Pafford . &quot; I get_up at 5 in the morning and get home at 6:30 p.m. Who has time to socialize ? &quot; she laments . Carlfred Broderick and his wife , Kathleen , both 62 , are also friendly but happily friendless . A sociology professor on the USC faculty , Broderick says that by the time they have taken_care of the needs of their eight grown children and their children plus an assortment of relatives , he and his wife &quot; don ' t have much energy and interest left over for outside friendships. &quot; While some might view these self-contained relationships as stifling or even pathological , therapist Lasswell says they are often warm , loving and intimate . However , they can have their downside . For one thing , the children may feel left_out , says Lasswell . When parents go_on an extended vacation and leave the kids with a care giver , or even slip out_to dinner without them , youngsters understand that the parents ' relationship comes first . In addition , says Lasswell , &quot; If these couples run_into trouble , it ' s because they are so sensitive to each other that it ' s impossible ( for one ) to have a problem without the other being seriously affected. &quot; Usually , in a &quot; more balanced &quot; relationship , when one is down , the other is up and vice versa , Lasswell says . The partners can balance each other . &quot; In this kind of marriage , when it ' s good , it ' s very good , &quot; she says , &quot; but when it ' s bad , it ' s really bad. &quot;</TEXT>
