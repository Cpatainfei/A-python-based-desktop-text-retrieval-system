   <HEADLINE> STORM SENDS QUAKE VICTIMS SEARCHING FOR MAKESHIFT COVER ; WEATHER : PEOPLE IN FILLMORE AND SIMI VALLEY GRAB PLASTIC TO PROTECT DAMAGED HOMES AND BELONGINGS . TWO OIL SPILLS ARE WORRISOME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Earthquake victims in Fillmore and Simi Valley covered their belongings and damaged homes with plastic and tarps as rain began falling Monday night in Ventura County with showers expected to linger through this morning . Simi Valley hardware_stores reported brisk sales of plastic and other waterproof covering materials as owners of damaged properties sought to plug holes inflicted by last week ' s earthquake . Crews worked_through the day in Fillmore to protect buildings against wet weather . The wet storm that originated_in the Gulf of Alaska also brought winds and colder temperatures , with nighttime lows Monday night and tonight expected to dip_into the low 30s inland and into the 40s along the coast . Daytime temperatures should reach_into the 50s and low 60s . But after this morning ' s scattered showers , forecasters said skies are expected to clear , bringing a return to warmer temperatures Wednesday . No further rain is expected later this week , meteorologists said . The city of Fillmore placed huge rolls of clear plastic sheeting at St . Francis Catholic_Church , where residents were snipping_off sections early Monday to prepare_for the rain . The city also provided nails and wooden strips for residents to secure the plastic sheeting . * The city ' s two emergency shelters were_full with about 300 people on Saturday night , when rain was forecast but did not materialize , said Bob Buckles , Fillmore evacuation center supervisor . He said up_to 1 # 000 people were expected in the shelters Monday night . But he said the city and the Red_Cross were planning to bring_in extra tents or drape tarps around an outdoor area at Fillmore Middle_School to accommodate any overflow . &quot; We ' re about out of indoor facilities , &quot; Buckles said . &quot; we ' ll have to start putting them outdoors . We definitely do not want to turn people away. &quot; In Simi Valley , the emergency shelter at Royal High_School has been providing beds for about 100 people , and more were expected Monday night . However , shelter operators said the building ' s capacity is 350 people . Hugh Darby , manager of the Federal Emergency Management Agency center in Simi Valley , said the chilly and wet weather provided an extra incentive to move people quickly through the aid application process . &quot; We ' re moving people as fast as we can every day , but ( the impending storm ) is a factor , &quot; he said . &quot; It gets cold at night. &quot; Hardware_stores were selling hundreds of tarpaulins , sheets of plastic and other makeshift repair materials , employees said . At the Holiday Hardware_store on Tapo Street , customer Steve Cherry said his Simi Valley condominium had suffered major damage , forcing him , his wife and infant daughter into a motel . After the quake , &quot; the rain doesn ' t scare me , &quot; he said . &quot; So things get a little wet . So what ? It ' s all got_to be replaced anyway. &quot; Larry Kerr was among many Simi Valley residents whose homes sustained major damage . On Monday , he and his son were covering the house with sheets of orange plastic . &quot; We ' re just trying to keep this thing as livable as possible , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re just trying to cope. &quot; * The coming rain also caused concern for crews working to clean_up an oil spill along 12 to 15 miles of the Santa Clara River east of Piru . They feared that the contamination from the remaining oil could spread if heavy rain pushes it downstream . More_than 500 people were working_on the spill Monday . More_than 600 fish and at least 20 birds and other animals have died so far . Another 22 birds , as well as a pond turtle and a Western_toad , were found alive but coated with oil . California Department of Fish and Game officials said the agency may increase the estimate of oil spilled above the original 168 # 000 gallons after its investigation is complete . At the same time , Arco , parent company of Four Corners Pipeline , reduced its estimate of oil recovered to 58 # 000 gallons after an analysis of material vacuumed up from the river . &quot; There is still a lot of oil in the river , &quot; said Reed Smith of the Fish and Game Department . &quot; It will take weeks to clean this up. &quot; But he said that if rainfall in the area is limited to half an inch to an inch as forecast , the ground should be able to absorb the water and prevent the oil from being pushed further downstream . The rain could also raise the water_level at tiny McGrath Lake , where an oil spill discovered on Christmas_Day coated the lake and surrounding wetlands with heavy crude . Richard Rojas , chief ranger for the California State Parks Channel Coast District , said the rain could damage more vegetation as the &quot; bathtub ring &quot; of oil that clings_to the edges of the lake moves_up . His department is working with Fish and Game officers to determine how to remove any remaining oil from the bottom of the lake . * County engineers said the rainfall was not expected to be heavy enough to trigger mudslides in areas stripped of soil-holding vegetation after last October ' s wildfires . &quot; I would expect the rainfall to be absorbed into the soil , &quot; said John Weikel , senior engineer for the Ventura County Flood_Control Department . But even a light rain is an unwelcome visitor for Ramona Logan , whose Fillmore home was left uninhabitable by the quake . She and her 6-year-old daughter have been sleeping_in a borrowed motor_home . &quot; This rain just makes_it a whole_lot harder , &quot; she said .
