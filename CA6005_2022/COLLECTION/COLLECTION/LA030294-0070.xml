   <TEXT> S oul is a four-letter_word that carries a crushing accumulation of metaphorical baggage , and Phil Cousineau ponders virtually all its meanings in &quot; Soul : An Archaeology of the Spirit , &quot; an audacious but rewarding anthology of poetry , song , fairy tale , meditation , reminiscence , disputation and confession that spans a_few millennia of human civilization . Cousineau , biographer of myth-master Joseph Campbell , set himself the task of collecting everything he could find on the subject of the soul and offering it up as &quot; a collage of sub-atomic word traces of the soul ' s movement through us and through the world. &quot; The whole enterprise is intended to be -- and is -- inspiring , often mind-blowing , sometimes even a little scary . &quot; To probe the images of the soul as the vital_force , the source of consciousness , the persistence of things , the core individuality , the depth dimension , the raw , blue rhythm of life , &quot; writes Cousineau by way of introduction , &quot; is to suddenly , with Lear , ' take upon us the mystery of things , as if we were God ' s spies. ' &quot; No single unifying principle can be discerned in Cousineau ' s selections , which ricochet wildly from Genesis to Gnostic creation myths to the Second Khanda Upanishad ; from West_African folk tales to Dervish poetry to the verses of T.S. Eliot ; from Aristotle on &quot; The Essential Whatness &quot; to Tracy Kidder on &quot; The Soul of the Computer &quot; ; from Cicero to William Blake to Ramakrishna ; from James Joyce to Eldridge Cleaver to Pablo Neruda ; from Abelard and Heloise to H.P. Blavatsky to Raymond Carver and Alice Walker . Cousineau ' s reach is intentionally ( and appropriately ) cosmic , and &quot; Soul &quot; is a mixed bag of spiritual yearning , theological speculation and intellectual curiosity . To the anticipated criticism that his book is a multicultural and metaphysical hodgepodge , Cousineau simply shrugs and says : Here it is , take it , and make of it what you will . &quot; Frankly , I ' m haunted by vexing questions : Why do I hear Gregorian chant , hell-for-leather sermons , and the whiskey-and-smoke voice of Ray Charles whenever I hear the very word soul ? &quot; he muses . &quot; Why does this cavernous universe within me resound like a cathedral organ reverberating with Bach , the three-tone chords of Tibetan monks , and sometimes , in the heat of the night , the chilling opening chords of Percy Sledge ' s soul-piercing ' When a Man Loves a Woman ' ? &quot; As if to show us exactly what he means , Cousineau has selected fragments that ponder soul in all its disparate and sometimes unrelated meanings . St . Teresa of Avila fancies the soul to be an interior castle fashioned of diamond ; Descartes insists that the &quot; material soul &quot; is seated in the pineal_gland of the human brain ; the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow rhapsodizes on the human voice as &quot; the organ of the soul. &quot; And so we are hardly surprised when Cousineau throws_in a riff on soul music by African American music_critic Al Young . &quot; Was soul something like a breeze , &quot; he ponders , &quot; something you couldn ' t picture or grab but could only feel_like you could the wind_off the Gulf when the day cooled_down . . . ? &quot; Cousineau also considers Bruno Bettelheim ' s argument that the mistranslation of Freud ' s work into English unfairly concealed and distorted Freud ' s interest in &quot; that unknown nether world in which , according to ancient myths , the souls of men dwell. &quot; And Jung , of course , was unabashed in his celebration of the human soul . &quot; Why should the simple mind deny . . . that the ' soul ' lives in a realm beyond the body ? &quot; Jung wrote . &quot; I must admit that I can see as little nonsense in this so-called superstition as in the findings of research regarding heredity or the basic instincts. &quot; Often enough , the readings have less to do with the soul in its classical sense than with ideas and experiences that we know by other names : love , comfort , inspiration , longing , remorse . Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl , for example , recalls how the luminous awareness of his wife ' s love kept him alive in a concentration_camp during the Holocaust , and psychologist Sue Nathan reveals the shattering emotional repercussions that attended her decision to abort her fourth pregnancy . &quot; Committed to life , not death , having always celebrated my fertility and joy in giving_birth , I fell_into an abyss of despair from which I could see no exit , &quot; writes Nathan , somehow echoing the confessional literature of the Middle_Ages as she recalls &quot; a crisis at the deepest center of my being -- a crisis of soul -- unlike any other experience of suffering I have encountered. &quot; And , significantly , Cousineau includes a passage by Albert Schweitzer in which the good doctor invokes the soul as a touchstone of moral behavior : &quot; You know of the disease in Central_Africa called sleeping sickness , &quot; he wrote . &quot; There also exists a sleeping sickness of the soul. &quot; Here , I think , is the essence of what Cousineau hopes to accomplish with his book . If there is a common theme in the crazy_quilt of &quot; Soul , &quot; it is a moral and spiritual wake-up call , a massive antidote to what Wallace Stegner called the &quot; soul-sickness &quot; of contemporary_world . Against what Cousineau correctly characterizes as the &quot; corrosive loneliness , vague purposelessness , and hall-of-mirrors narcissism &quot; of late 20th-Century human existence , Cousineau offers a bracing and yet somehow intoxicating brew intended to revive us and fortify us . &quot; In a postmodern world of instantaneous revisionism of all we hold scared , &quot; writes Cousineau in defense of his whole marvelous enterprise , &quot; soul is an existential anchor for the drifting ship of awareness. &quot;</TEXT>
