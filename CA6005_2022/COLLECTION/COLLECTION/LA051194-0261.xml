   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : OPTIMISM ON RISE , BONDS MAY YET SEE A TURNAROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Investors who ' ve been waiting for a convincing sign that longer-term interest_rates are peaking -- at least temporarily -- may have gotten_it_on Tuesday . When the Treasury offered $ 17 billion in three-year notes to the public , the response from small investors was extraordinary . &quot; Non-competitive &quot; purchase_orders for the notes , the kind of order usually submitted by individuals , totaled $ 1.45 billion . In contrast , $ 846 million in non-competitive orders came_in_for three-year notes at the last such Treasury auction , in February . Back then , three-year notes were yielding about 4.7 % annually . Now they pay 6.5 % . To a significant number of small investors , 6.5 % must look_like an attractive yield if they ' re willing to be stuck_with it for the next three years . that ' s exactly the kind of change in psychology that the bond market needs to stabilize , after more_than three months of surging interest_rates . And while individual investors buying T-notes can ' t turn the bond market around by themselves , they may soon get more help . There are indications that foreign investors also have decided that U.S. rates have reached levels too attractive to pass_up . The dollar ' s value rocketed Tuesday versus key foreign currencies , which bond traders said was in part the work of foreign investors buying dollars to use for Treasury_bond purchases . * While the dollar was falling between January and last week , foreigners had no incentive to buy U.S. bonds , because every drop_in the dollar devalued U.S. assets held by foreigners . But now that the Clinton_Administration has decided to defend the currency , foreign investors can see a double-barreled payoff in buying U.S. bonds if the dollar is in an upswing : They can lock_in decent yields , plus get the gift of price appreciation if the dollar keeps rising . David Rosenberg , who runs the Oppenheimer U.S._Government Trust bond mutual_fund in New York , is one pro willing to bet that the turn_in the dollar also signals that bond yields have reached at least a near-term crest . On Tuesday , he bought some 10-year Treasury_notes , yielding about 7.3 % annually , for his $ 325-million fund . Rosenberg believes that the latest sharp jump in long-term yields , which occurred Friday in response to the strong April employment report and resultant inflation paranoia , represented the kind of capitulation often seen when market moves reach the &quot; blow-off &quot; stage . &quot; People were throwing_up their hands , &quot; he said . And on Monday , Rosenberg noted , many professional traders jumped_on the gloom bandwagon , &quot; shorting &quot; Treasury_bonds ahead of the three-year note auction Tuesday and today ' s planned Treasury auction of 10-year notes . In a short_sale , traders sell borrowed bonds , betting they can replace them with cheaper bonds later on . When bonds appreciated Tuesday ( as yields fell ) instead of depreciating as the shorts expected , some of the shorts were forced to buy bonds on the open market to cover their wrong-way bets . Combined with genuine demand from small investors and the sudden buying interest on the part of foreigners , the bond market rallied . But can this rally stick ? Each time bond yields started to pull_back in recent months , more &quot; bad &quot; news came_along ( usually in the form of healthy economic reports ) that reignited worries about inflation returning as the economy expands . Thus , to be bullish on bonds now , you have to assume that yields have reached a_level that takes_into_account almost any additional signs of economic expansion imaginable in the near term . That appears to be the view of individuals buying three-year T-notes at 6.5 % . The next group that must be convinced consists_of Rosenberg ' s peers , U.S. bond fund managers . Patricia Bannan , manager of the Phoenix Balanced fund in East Hartford , Conn. , is a case_in_point . Short-term &quot; cash &quot; assets make_up nearly 25 % of her fund ' s $ 2.8 billion total . Of the rest , 45 % is in_stocks and 30 % is in bonds . If she were to decide that rates had peaked and that bonds were attractive , she ' d have lots of cash to put_to_work . What would make her a buyer ? First , Bannan says , the Federal_Reserve_Board has to take &quot; real action &quot; to show it ' s serious about keeping money tight enough to restrain inflation . That means a half-point rise in the Fed ' s benchmark short-term interest_rate , from 3.75 % to 4.25 % , she says -- a move she hopes to see next week . Second , &quot; I need to see signs that the economy isn ' t that strong , &quot; Bannan says . A month or two of mostly moderate economic reports could convince her , she allows . There ' s a chance that neither of her wishes will be granted , of course . But with small investors and foreigners already moving_into bonds , even a minor turn_in sentiment by U.S. fund managers could be enough to spark a dramatic rally in this beaten-up market . Rates don ' t go_up forever -- at least not in a straight_line . Enough may be enough . Enough Is Enough ?
