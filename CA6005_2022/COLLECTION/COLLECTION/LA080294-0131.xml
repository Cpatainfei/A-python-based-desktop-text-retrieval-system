   <HEADLINE> U.S.-CANADIAN WHEAT IMPORT LIMIT APPROVED ; COMMERCE : THE NEGOTIATORS AVERT A TRADE WAR WITH TENTATIVE ONE-YEAR PACT . OFFICIAL CITES CURB AT 1.5 MILLION TONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. and Canadian trade negotiators , averting a potential trade war between the world ' s biggest trading partners , tentatively agreed Monday to limit wheat imports from Canada for one year . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the agreed-to limit will result in &quot; a substantial reduction &quot; in imported grain from last year , but he did not reveal the limit placed on Canadian farmers . A weather-damaged U.S. harvest and a major Canadian sales drive pushed sales of wheat from north of the border to about 2.5 million tons in this country last year . One official familiar_with the agreement said trade negotiators had settled_on 1.5 million tons as the limit on wheat imports this year . Kantor said the two governments will establish a joint commission to study each nation ' s marketing systems and subsidies for all grains . After reviewing the two countries ' policies , the commission will recommend ways to improve the balance_of_trade . But neither government will be bound to act_on advice from the panel , which will be composed of six to 10 private wheat industry representatives and trade experts , Kantor said . Restricting imports will not result in any appreciable increases in the prices of wheat products for consumers , he said . Under the accord , which requires the approval of both governments , the United States will hold_off on imposing tariffs on Canadian wheat for 12 months to give the commission enough time to make recommendations to the two governments , Kantor said . Canada has pledged not to retaliate with trade sanctions of its own under a &quot; peace clause &quot; in the agreement . Announcement of the agreement caps a week of tense negotiations between U.S. and Canadian trade officials . Canadian Trade Minister Roy MacLaren met with Kantor over the weekend and trade negotiators have made several conference_calls to hammer_out the last-minute accord , U.S. officials said . Both countries had threatened sanctions after the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled last month that Canadian imports had flooded the American market , forcing U.S. farmers to lower their prices . U.S. trade negotiators had tried to convince Canada to cap its exports to the United States at 1.5 million tons a year , and industry leaders had asked the Administration to seek a limit of 500 # 000 tons . Clinton_Administration officials are expected to announce details of the accord this morning . Officials close to the negotiations said that determining the cap was a difficult issue in the talks . But it was even tougher to persuade the Canadian government to accept that its support of Canadian farmers &quot; is a problem , &quot; one U.S. official said . Under the agreement reached Monday , neither country has to admit wrongdoing , Kantor said . But the joint commission will give trade experts a chance to deal with underlying issues in the dispute , including the pricing practices of the Canadian Wheat Board , which administers Canada ' s national monopoly and serves as a trade advocate for Canadian farmers . Reaction to the accord was mixed among wheat industry leaders . Paul Rosenthal , an international trade attorney representing U.S. pasta producers , said that likely increases in the cost of U.S. and Canadian wheat will &quot; put a real squeeze on producers . We ' re left with no real alternative. &quot; U.S. farm groups praised the agreement as a first_step toward establishing a fair balance_of_trade . Canadian Embassy spokesman George Rioux said the agreement is &quot; not perfect &quot; but &quot; it enables us to move forward and not have to face a trade confrontation. &quot; Canadian government officials said they are hoping to negotiate a final limit of_imports above 1 million tons a year . If there are sticking points in negotiating a final agreement , Rioux said , &quot; it will be in the numbers. &quot;</TEXT>
