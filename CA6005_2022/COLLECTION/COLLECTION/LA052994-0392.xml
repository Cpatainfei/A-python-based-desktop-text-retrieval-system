   <TEXT> My real_estate_agent is pressuring me to make a decision . How should I handle this ? The first_step is to discern whether or not the agent is providing good advice.If he or she seems eager because they want you to take_advantage of a good_deal , a certain amount of encouragement may be unavoidable and even necessary . However , if the agent seems detached from your personal circumstances , beware . An agent may be overworked or believe they have shown enough homes and now it ' s time to reap their commission . &quot; Beware of the agent who ' s desperate to make a sale , &quot; cautions Dian Hymer , author of &quot; Buying and Selling a Home_in California : A Complete Guide , &quot; ( Chronicle Books , San Francisco , 1994. ) &quot; Top agents manage their personal finances so . . . their livelihood doesn ' t depend_on the success of a single transaction. &quot; Try discussing the problem with the agent ' s broker . If the situation cannot be resolved , most experts would recommend that people find another agent . To legally end a relationship with a salesperson or broker when there is a preset agreement on compensation , George Devine , author of &quot; For Sale by Owner , &quot; ( Nolo Press , Berkeley , Calif. , 1993 ) says pay_for the hours used and notify the broker in writing that you don ' t need their services anymore .</TEXT>
