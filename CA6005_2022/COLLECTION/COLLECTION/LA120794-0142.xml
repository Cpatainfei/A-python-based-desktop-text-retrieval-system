   <HEADLINE> CHAPTER 9 MOVE A LAST_RESORT , EXPERTS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s filing for bankruptcy court protection is viewed by legal_experts as a move of last_resort that can send shock_waves through every level of government and trigger severe economic consequences that might take years to overcome . Governmental agencies seeking protection under Chapter 9 of the U . S . Bankruptcy Code risk a host of fiscal woes , including the loss of hard-won credit ratings , the inability to sell bonds to raise money for capital projects , deteriorating relations with employees and creditors , as well as the prospect of raising fees or taxes to help pay the debts that triggered the bankruptcy petition . The legal_fees are enormous , and rounds of cost-cutting measures might become necessary , resulting in layoffs and reduced services . Cities such_as Bridgeport , Conn. , have spent years trying to rebuild their credit rating and overcoming the stigma of Chapter 9 , leaving municipal officials wondering if it was all worth it . &quot; It is often better to work_out your problems with financial engineering rather than to crash and burn , &quot; said James E . Spiotto , a Chicago attorney and one of the nation ' s top experts on governmental bankruptcy . &quot; Chapter 9 is the most extreme remedy , the last_resort , if you can even call it a last resort. &quot; But Spiotto and other bankruptcy lawyers say Chapter 9 could provide Orange County with a powerful shield to fend_off a potentially devastating &quot; run_on the bank &quot; by participants in the beleaguered investment pool that was managed by former County Treasurer Robert L . Citron . A financial crisis developed for Orange County last week when it was reported that the $ 20-billion investment pool had lost $ 1.5 billion -- about 20 % of the investors ' actual stake -- because an investment strategy that Citron had used successfully for many years had turned sour as interest_rates began to rise . In essence , Citron had pledged his investors ' securities as collateral to borrow more_than $ 12 billion in short-term loans to buy long-term bonds that at the time were paying higher rates_of_interest . As the Federal_Reserve began raising interest_rates this year , however , the short-term loans could only be renewed at ever-increasing interest_rates , while the value of the long-term bonds he bought tumbled . Citron resigned in the wake of disclosures about the pool ' s losses . A federal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation is under way . &quot; You file Chapter 9 when the pressure is greater than your ability to handle it , &quot; said Richard Levin , a bankruptcy attorney for 20 years in Los Angeles . &quot; Like a classic bank_failure , you could prevent the race of the swift. &quot; Chapter 9 is a backwater of federal bankruptcy law , which grants governmental agencies time to reorganize their finances and make arrangements with creditors to pay_off their debts . The action is filed voluntarily , meaning that no creditor can force the governmental entity into bankruptcy , as they can with a business . A government_agency such_as Orange County must meet several tests to declare a Chapter 9 bankruptcy , said attorney Marc Beilinson of Pachulski , Stang &amp; Ziehl in Los Angeles . It must meet the legal definition of a municipality . State law must authorize it , which California law does . The governmental entity must be insolvent and willing to develop a plan to pay its debts . It must obtain the approval of creditors holding a majority of its claims or it must have negotiated with investors in good_faith and failed to reach agreement . Municipalities have a great_deal more freedom under Chapter 9 than corporations do under somewhat comparable Chapter 11 bankruptcies , Beilinson said . Municipalities get protection from their creditors but , unlike bankrupt corporations , they do not have to seek a judge ' s permission to borrow new funds or spend them as they see fit . It is unlike a regular bankruptcy in other ways , attorneys say , because as long as the entity has the power to tax or raise fees to help pay the debt , it cannot go_out of existence , as is possible for a failed business or corporation . Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code was developed during the Great Depression , when many municipalities began losing their ability to raise taxes and had trouble paying debts . Since then , 475 Chapter 9 petitions are known to have been filed . Most of those cases involved small , special-purpose districts for schools , utilities , water or sewer services and hospitals . No large or medium-size cities ever have filed a Chapter 9 proceeding and pursued it to a conclusion . &quot; The law is there , but the hope is no one will use it , &quot; said Lawrence P . King , a professor and bankruptcy specialist at the New York University School_of_Law . &quot; When you file it , people want to stop dealing with you . The state starts breathing down your throat . Politicians get some mileage out of it . If there is one thing I would emphasize , it ' s the last resort. &quot; Until Orange County ' s filing , Bridgeport , a city of 145 # 000 people with a debt of $ 200 million , represented the largest entity in the country to seek Chapter 9 protection . After taking the action in 1991 , the city lost its credit rating and could not sell municipal_bonds to raise money . Broad cost-cutting measures were instituted and employee morale plummeted along with the credit rating . There were even doubts that local banks would honor city paychecks . The Connecticut attorney_general challenged Bridgeport ' s action in court , and a judge threw_out the Chapter 9 petition , ruling that the city was solvent and could pay its bills . The city appealed , but Mayor Joseph P . Ganim , who was elected during the crisis , eventually withdrew the appeal . &quot; There is a fiscal , political and moral aspect to it all . The whole impact on municipal_government is enormous , &quot; Ganim said . &quot; Wall_Street is skeptical , and it was been an uphill battle to regain our credibility . It affects all levels of government . There is a freeze on hiring , a freeze on wages . If I were mayor when this started , I would not have filed a Chapter 9. &quot; New York City considered filing a Chapter 9 petition during its fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s and federal law was changed to accommodate such a move . But city leaders decided against the action , fearing that a bankruptcy filing would deliver a devastating blow to the municipal_bond market . At the time , New York City bonds represented about 27 % of the market , and Wall_Street leaders stepped_in to help restore the city ' s credit worthiness . New York appealed_to President Gerald R . Ford for federal help , but Ford initially refused , prompting the memorable New York Daily News headline : &quot; Ford to City : Drop Dead. &quot; But Ford later relented and approved a $ 2.3-billion emergency financing after the Municipal Finance Corp . was formed to handle the city ' s troubled finances . Investment_banker Felix Rohatyn led the agency , which secured the cooperation of the city ' s union and business_leaders and special investments from union and other pension_funds . Similarly , Cleveland never went_through bankruptcy court for protection after it defaulted_on bond payments to investors in 1978 . More recently , Philadelphia officials considered a Chapter 9 filing , but never proceeded with it . In California , the San Jose School District , facing labor problems and the effects of Proposition 13 , sought protection under Chapter 9 and managed to pay its debts on_time . Depending_on the amount of indebtedness , bankruptcy lawyers say , Orange County could face some of the same problems as the troubled cities . If bond and credit ratings plunge , the county would have trouble getting loans or selling bonds to raise money for a new stadium in Anaheim , a new county jail or a road . A bankruptcy would harm Orange County ' s credit standing -- not just its rating by agencies such_as Moody ' s and Standard &amp; Poor ' s , but its long-term reputation among investors . It would immediately become more expensive for the county to borrow funds because investors would demand higher interest_rates to compensate for the increased risk . Just as airline mogul Frank Lorenzo used the bankruptcy laws to break contracts with his unionized employees , Orange County could , if it chose , renegotiate collective_bargaining agreements with its employees or seek to unilaterally change their pay or benefits , with the judge ' s permission . The same applies to the county ' s dealings with trash haulers , for example , or other private contractors . It could press a judge to reject existing contracts , or use that threat to pressure contractors into providing more favorable terms , Beilinson said . Furthermore , bankruptcy lawyers say that investors holding bonds sold by Orange County might not be able to earn interest because interest ceases to accrue when a Chapter 9 is filed . &quot; The biggest problem is the stigma of the bankruptcy . Eventually , you have to go_back to the bond market . Your credit ratings are ruined . Someone always gets hurt , &quot; Spiotto said . &quot; This creates a tremendous strain on governmental relationships. &quot; Beyond county government , the Chapter 9 filing could affect about 180 municipalities , school districts and other governmental entities that had entrusted billions of dollars to Orange County to invest . All of them use their investments to raise money to meet their obligations , such_as new construction or to make loan payments . &quot; I would not be surprised if a number of other municipalities ( that invested in the Orange County fund ) were themselves forced to file for bankruptcy because they won ' t be able to meet their own obligations , &quot; Beilinson said .
