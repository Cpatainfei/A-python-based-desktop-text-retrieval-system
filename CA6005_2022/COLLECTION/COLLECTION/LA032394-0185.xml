   <HEADLINE> ' 3 STRIKES ' LAW BEING USED TO CHALLENGE DEATH_PENALTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Criminal defense_lawyers around the state are using the &quot; three strikes &quot; law to file long-shot challenges to the death_penalty , contending that the new sentencing scheme preempts capital_punishment . A motion to preclude a death sentence for an accused triple murderer already has been filed_in San Francisco , and defense_lawyers elsewhere in the state say they will cite the new law in making similar motions in the near future . &quot; Just because you think you may lose doesn ' t mean you shouldn ' t be filing it , &quot; said San Francisco Deputy Public_Defender Grace Suarez . But some prosecutors believe that such challenges will only tie_up the courts and run_up costs . &quot; The biggest downside is that it will produce years of litigation and add significant issues to each death_penalty prosecution , &quot; said Ventura County Dist . Atty . Michael D . Bradbury , who had warned the Legislature that the bill could endanger death_penalty prosecutions . &quot; We will win the issue , but at tremendous cost of time and money and people power. &quot; A survey of seven counties shows that most of the defendants so far charged with third-strike offenses are alleged robbers and burglars . They range from a thief charged with breaking_into a car in San Francisco to a convicted robber believed to have shot and wounded his wife and her boyfriend in Sacramento County . But some defense_lawyers argue that the hastily passed law can be read in a way that could benefit defendants charged with the most brutal of crimes . Under &quot; three strikes , &quot; third-time felons who have been convicted of two serious or violent crimes must be sentenced to at least 25 years . A second felony doubles the basic sentence . The law says its prescribed sentences must prevail , &quot; not withstanding any other law. &quot; Defense_attorneys say defendants with prior felonies therefore must be sentenced under the provisions of &quot; three strikes , &quot; which does not provide_for the death_penalty . A judge has yet to rule on such a motion . The state legislators who passed the bill had been warned that it could lead to death_penalty challenges . Legal analysts believe the challenges will almost certainly fail because &quot; three strikes &quot; was intended to stiffen penalties for criminals , not diminish them . The debate probably will reach the California Supreme Court and the federal_courts . When the wording of a law is ambiguous , appellate_courts interpret it by examining the intent of the Legislature . But defense_attorneys contend that the law ' s language is not ambiguous , so the intentions of the Legislature need not be considered . &quot; The statute is very , very clear in what it says the sentencing scheme should be , &quot; said San Francisco defense_attorney Mark Goldrosen , who filed a motion on behalf of a man accused of killing three elderly people in 1987 . Defense_attorneys are debating when to file such motions . Los Angeles County Deputy Public_Defender Charles Gessler argues that such an appeal should not be made until after a client has been sentenced to death . Gessler said the new law has not overruled the death_penalty initiative , although an identical measure on the November ballot may . Rather , in his view , the statute &quot; bypasses &quot; the death_penalty . &quot; If the effort is to keep people in prison longer and make the terms longer , &quot; said the coordinator for capital cases , &quot; death is totally counterproductive . It shortens the term. &quot; Others say they will file when their clients are charged with offenses that could bring a death sentence or life in prison without parole . &quot; It is our duty to point_out anything in the law that helps our client , &quot; said San Bernardino County Deputy Public_Defender David Negus , &quot; and certainly if you read the statute as it is written , it helps our client. &quot; Negus ' office intends to file a motion March 30 on behalf of Johnny Miles , who is charged with murder in the course of a rape and robbery . He has at least two prior felonies . The public_defender ' s office will argue that , if convicted , Miles can only be sentenced under the &quot; three strikes &quot; provisions . The California Supreme Court affirms more death sentences than any state high_court in the country , and few believe the court would rule_in favor of such challenges . But Suarez , the San Francisco public_defender , said the Supreme Court may &quot; get sick and tired_of coming in and patching_up these badly drafted statutes and say , ' We are not going_to do_it this time. ' &quot; She is trying to preclude a death sentence for one of her clients . Apart from its potential impact on capital cases , the &quot; three strikes &quot; law has been criticized for imposing hefty prison_terms for offenses that may_not be all that serious . But some county prosecutors simply are not charging prior felonies if they think a third strike would produce an unjust sentence , said Ventura County ' s Bradbury . He contended that prosecutors have such discretion under the California Constitution . &quot; Who is going_to tell me I can ' t do that ? &quot; said the former president of the California District_Attorneys Assn . &quot; Is it the attorney_general ? we ' ll kick his backside out of the county . . . . The only risk a prosecutor runs is at the ballot box. &quot; In Los Angeles County , a Municipal Court judge in Van Nuys reduced a third strike felony against a defendant -- possession of a small amount of drugs -- to a misdemeanor , allowing him to escape the terms of the law , said Sandi Gibbons , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office . She said at least 13 people have been charged with &quot; three strikes &quot; in the county . Most of their prior convictions were for burglary or robbery . The third strikes ranged from receiving stolen property to sexual_assaults and kidnaping . In Sacramento , a man with two felony convictions for robbery and two for possession of a weapon is being charged under &quot; three strikes &quot; with the attempted murder of his wife and her boyfriend . The woman had tried to divorce the defendant when he was in prison . &quot; It makes my job easier , &quot; said Sacramento County Deputy Dist . Atty . Robert Morgester . &quot; For me to get a life sentence under the old law , I needed to prove that he intended to kill , and that he premeditated and deliberated . . . . Under the new law I just have to prove that he committed a felony . If I get him on possession of a weapon , he goes 25-to-life. &quot; In Kern County , one of six defendants charged with a &quot; third strike &quot; is a 48-year-old man with two prior robbery_convictions . His third strike : allegedly stealing five cartons of cigarettes . &quot; He is an inveterate burglar who is also dangerous , &quot; said Kern County Dist . Atty . Edward Jagels . Under the old law , the defendant would have received a maximum four-year sentence . Under &quot; three strikes , &quot; he faces at least 20 years . Jagels said the six defendants are habitual_criminals who have been churned in and out of prison over the years . Although prosecutors generally opposed the statute passed_by the Legislature , Jagels said he sees merits . &quot; We have a lot of prisoners here in Kern County , &quot; said Jagels , &quot; and the word I am getting from correction officials is that this ( ' three strikes ' ) is virtually all_the inmates who are close to release are talking about. &quot; But San Francisco Dist . Atty . Arlo Smith said his office is prosecuting a man who is probably not the kind of criminal that lawmakers had_in_mind when they passed the sentencing law . The 45-year-old allegedly broke_into a locked automobile -- his &quot; third strike. &quot; He was convicted many years ago of two residential burglaries . &quot; Auto burglary is not something we approve of , &quot; Smith said , &quot; but it is not a violent or serious felony. &quot; Times researcher Norma Kaufman contributed to this report .</TEXT>
