   <HEADLINE> STUDY DOWNPLAYS COST OF AIDS TO EMPLOYERS ; WORKPLACE : REPORT SAYS THE AVERAGE TAB IS $ 17 # 000 AND THAT MOST OF THE ULTIMATE EXPENSE IS BORNE BY THE PUBLIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Workers with the AIDS virus cost their employers far less in medical and other expenses than is commonly believed . The average patient ' s tab amounts to $ 17 # 000 , a new report says . Paul Farnham , a Georgia State University health economist who was a co-author of the study , said many employers have been misled by estimates of medical costs related to HIV and AIDS . The purpose of the study was to develop an economic model for estimating &quot; the expected costs that a typical large company would incur over a five-year period. &quot; Federal researchers have pegged the average lifetime medical_bill of a person with the human_immunodeficiency_virus at between $ 85 # 000 and about $ 120 # 000 . But Farnham contends that some employers familiar_with the estimates mistakenly believe they will bear most of that cost . &quot; There ' s this perception that AIDS is completely different , much more expensive and has a much greater economic impact &quot; than other catastrophic_illnesses , Farnham said . Compared to diseases such_as cancer , acquired immune deficiency syndrome &quot; is in the low mid-range in terms of overall costs to society , &quot; she said . The report , in part , was aimed at employers who have cut_off benefits or fired workers with the AIDS virus -- a theme portrayed in the movie &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; in which Tom Hanks portrays a lawyer who is fired after his firm learns he has the AIDS virus . Although they are protected under the federal Americans With Disabilities Act , AIDS groups say workers often face discrimination on_the_job . In one widely cited case , a Houston music store slashed its medical coverage for AIDS after one of its employees developed AIDS-related pneumonia -- in_effect , cutting_off his benefits . W . Shepherd Smith Jr. , executive_director of the Washington-based Americans for a Sound AIDS / HIV Policy , said small businesses tend to have the greatest concerns about the impact of AIDS on their workplaces . They often have skimpier medical coverage and may risk cancellation of their insurance_policies or huge premium increases if an employee develops a serious illness . The findings were the result of three years of research Farnham undertook with co-author Robin Gorsky , an associate_professor at the University of New Hampshire ' s School of Health and Human Services . The study was done under the auspices of the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention in Atlanta . The report was warmly received by AIDS education advocates . &quot; It dispels some of the myths about HIV , including the idea that it is a bottomless pit of costs for employers , &quot; said Patrick May , a spokesman for the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS , an education group backed by business and labor . Fred J . Hellinger , a leading AIDS health_care expert for the federal_government , has estimated that the medical costs of treating someone infected with HIV averages $ 119 # 000 , taking_into_account the entire period from the time the virus is contracted until the patient dies . But Hellinger backed the findings of the study . He said most of the medical costs are picked_up not by employers , but by taxpayers . He explained that the highest medical_expenses come_in the last months of the patient ' s life , usually after the patient has left work and is no longer covered by the company ' s insurance . &quot; It ' s a manageable problem for most employers , &quot; Hellinger said . &quot; It ' s a public burden at the end. &quot; Others , however , contended that many employers continue to incur significant costs in the form of premiums for medical and disability coverage of employees in the late stages of AIDS . James A . Klein , executive_director of the Assn . of Private Pension and Welfare Plans , an employer trade group , said the costs to employers may be understated in the report because of the time_period it covered . Experts noted that two-thirds of the HIV-infected workers in the study had not yet developed full AIDS . The study tracked workers over a five-year period , ending between nine and 10 years after they contracted the AIDS virus . Federal authorities say most people with HIV , on average , don ' t develop full AIDS until 10 years after they become infected with the virus . In another recent study , researchers in San Francisco reported that people with the AIDS virus are living about a year longer than those who were infected a decade ago , largely because of successful treatment of AIDS-related pneumonia .</TEXT>
