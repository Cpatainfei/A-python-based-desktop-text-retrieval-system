   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN CZAR FOR ECONOMIC REFORM QUITS ; RUSSIA : DEPUTY PRIME_MINISTER GAIDAR CITES FRUSTRATION OVER NOT HAVING THE POWER TO CARRY_OUT HIS REFORMS . SOME SEE HIS MOVE AS A MANEUVER TO BE GIVEN MORE MUSCLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Yegor T . Gaidar , the brain behind Russia ' s economic reforms , announced Sunday that he is quitting the government , citing the tremendous frustration of being blamed for decisions that he could not control . &quot; I cannot serve in the government and at_the_same_time be in opposition to it , &quot; Gaidar said in a letter to President Boris N . Yeltsin . &quot; I cannot be responsible_for reforms without having . . . the necessary levers to carry_out the economic_policy in which I believe. &quot; Gaidar , the portly , 37-year-old economist who launched Russia ' s reforms in late 1991 and has done the most to push them forward , has become a symbol of Russia ' s move from a Communist_economy toward a market-driven system . His resignation is likely to worry both financial circles and the Western powers backing the transformation . Yeltsin is expected to discuss the resignation with Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin today , and a spokesman said the Russian president might not accept it . Some politicians called it an ultimatum meant to persuade Yeltsin to give Gaidar more power . But Ella Pamfilova , the social protection minister who added her resignation to Gaidar ' s , said : &quot; This is not an ultimatum . This is an act of despair , including by me. &quot; Gaidar himself , in a television interview and his letter to Yeltsin , did not appear to be merely posturing -- he seemed to be worn down by a one-man fight against inflation and loose-fisted government spending . He said he plans to concentrate_on leading Russia ' s main reform party in Parliament , and he even went so far as_to support Grigory Yavlinsky , a radical economist in a rival party , to replace him as first deputy prime_minister in_charge of the economy . His resignation also came as an unexpected postscript to the Russian-U.S. summit that ended Saturday , at which Yeltsin reportedly told President Clinton , &quot; Gaidar stays. &quot; * In Geneva , however , Clinton_Administration officials said Yeltsin had warned them that Gaidar would resign and that the resignation would be accepted . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher noted in Geneva on Sunday that Gaidar had not been particularly effective in selling his economic program to the Russian public , and he suggested that it might be a step_forward if he was replaced by someone more &quot; sensitive &quot; to the hardship felt by ordinary Russians . &quot; Mr. Gaidar , who is a very interesting , attractive person , was , after all , the head of a party that didn ' t do very well in the elections , &quot; Christopher said on NBC television ' s &quot; Meet the Press. &quot; &quot; So I would n ' t attribute undue significance to his leaving . There are other very strong reformers on President Yeltsin ' s team . And I think the important thing is President Yeltsin ' s commitment to reform. &quot; Gaidar , who leads the Russia ' s Choice reformist bloc that trailed embarrassingly behind an ultranationalist party in Dec . 12 parliamentary elections , did not mention the voting as a reason for his resignation , but it seemed to have influenced him . He and his allies were forced to take responsibility for the pain of the reforms , while Chernomyrdin stayed aloof from the campaign . Gaidar ' s letter to Yeltsin named two recent incidents that contributed to the sense of powerlessness that led to his resignation . First , he said , the government had agreed to let the ruble become the currency of the former Soviet republic of Belarus , a move that could hurt Russia ' s economy , without consulting him . And second , also without his consent , Chernomyrdin allocated $ 500 million to build a new center for the Parliament now that the Russian White_House -- the old Parliament building -- has been taken_over by the government . &quot; This sum far exceeds the resources allocated with great difficulty in 1993 for defense conversion and is five times greater than the federal spending on art and culture , &quot; Gaidar wrote in exasperation . &quot; This sum equals one-fifth of last year ' s social spending. &quot; The two examples were clearly not reason enough to resign ; rather , they reflected the basic difference that has split Gaidar and Chernomyrdin all along . Gaidar advocates a tough monetary policy to fight inflation , while Chernomyrdin has been far more willing to print and spend money . Recently , Chernomyrdin has been promising Russians that there will be no more &quot; shock_therapy , &quot; implying that social spending will be increased . Their conflict reached a boiling point as Chernomyrdin went_about reshuffling the Cabinet under a Yeltsin decree that calls_for slashing the number of posts . The new lineup of ministers is scheduled to be announced Tuesday . Yeltsin , who seems to have tried to remain above the Cabinet infighting , will be forced to referee between his prime_minister and his economics chief today . A year ago , he nominated Gaidar as his prime_minister but ended_up accepting Chernomyrdin after the Russian Congress rejected Gaidar . Whether he will once again choose Gaidar over Chernomyrdin is not certain . Yeltsin has assured the world that his tough reforms will continue despite the strong election showing by ultranationalists who profited from widespread discontent , but he has jettisoned Gaidar before out of political necessity . * If Gaidar and like-minded Deputy Prime_Minister Boris G . Fyodorov -- who has yet to be invited into the new Cabinet -- end_up on the outside , the point_man for Gaidar ' s team of radical reformists will become Anatoly B . Chubais , the head of Russia ' s privatization program and the likeliest man to replace Gaidar as economics czar . Gaidar said his allies had decided they would not quit the government as a group . Some areas of policy , such_as foreign affairs , satisfy reformers , he said , and each will make an individual decision . Gaidar noted that Chernomyrdin had asked him how he would feel about being replaced by rival economist Yavlinsky , and Gaidar said that he would &quot; warmly welcome this. &quot; But Yavlinsky , speaking on Russia ' s NTV network , indicated that he would not be eager to join a Cabinet that he said would be a &quot; traditional Soviet government &quot; with &quot; no ( policy ) line. &quot; A spokesman for Chernomyrdin maintained that the government will continue reforms with or without Gaidar . &quot; The government has been and will be reformist , &quot; spokesman Valentin Sergeyev said . * But Gaidar said he feared that his resignation could be followed by a return to socialist-style economics .
