   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING ; SHAKING_UP STIR-FRIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stir-frying has a lot going_for it . Not only is everything cooked quickly in a very little bit of oil over very high heat , but most recipes also use a high proportion of vegetables and noodles to meat . In this recipe , an American inspiration , noodles with turkey , water_chestnuts and cilantro are stir-fried and tossed_in a slightly sweet , hoisin-based sauce -- much like that served with familiar moo shu pork and pancakes . At the same time , the broccoli and carrots in sesame_oil and the Indian-style spinach and red_onions could easily be served on the same plate -- even as a second course following the noodle appetizer . The flavors are quite different but compatible . Also , unlike most vegetable stir-fries , these vegetables are blanched first in boiling salted water to preserve their color . MOO SHU-STYLE NOODLES WITH TURKEY , WATER_CHESTNUTS AND CILANTRO 1 / 4 cup hoisin_sauce 1 / 2 cup reduced sodium chicken_broth 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar 2 teaspoons peanut_oil 1 jalapeno chile , seeded if desired , minced 10 ounces ground turkey 10 small green_onions , thinly sliced 1 / 2 to 1 teaspoon salt 1 / 2 pound fettuccine , cooked ( rinsed and tossed_in few drops of oil , if cooked ahead ) 1 ( 8-ounce ) can sliced water_chestnuts , drained 2 tablespoons minced cilantro Combine hoisin_sauce , chicken_broth and vinegar in small bowl .
