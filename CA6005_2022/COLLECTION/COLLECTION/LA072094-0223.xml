   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK BETTER THAN IT SEEMS ? ; TRADE : NEW FIGURES INDICATE LARGEST TRADE_DEFICIT IN SEVEN YEARS , BUT AMERICAN EXPORTS ARE SEEN AS POISED FOR HUGE RALLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The trade_deficit ballooned in May to $ 9.2 billion , in what could be lamented as the latest U.S. setback in a hostile world economy . On the surface , the news might seem bleak : The 1994 trade_gap is_on track to be the largest in seven years , and imports flooded_in at record levels , according to Commerce_Department figures released Tuesday . But high anxiety over the trade_gap and the dollar ' s recent assault in currency markets is distracting attention from a much more positive reality , economists say . U.S. exports are finally poised for a rally , one that could provide a crucial boost to the aging national recovery in coming months . The key : a fortuitous turn of the economic cycle , with major overseas economies in Japan and Western Europe starting to recover -- just when the U.S. recovery may be slipping past its prime . &quot; We ' re counting_on exports to help keep the expansion going_in 1995 and 1996 , &quot; said Robert F . Wescott , chief economist at the White_House Council of Economic Advisers . Such hopes might sound surprising in light of the recent evidence . The trade_gap -- the difference between how much the nation buys from abroad and how much it sells -- surged almost 8 % in May , the Commerce_Department reported Tuesday . The deficit in goods is headed beyond $ 140 billion this year , the worst performance since 1987 . Overall trade with Western Europe stands_out as a weak_spot , economists said , with last year ' s U.S. surplus sinking to a $ 1.5-billion deficit so far this year . Nevertheless , &quot; the real story is that the United States is becoming more competitive , &quot; said economist David B . Bostian Jr . * Indeed , the U.S. recovery ' s life span and vitality could be influenced heavily by this little-understood reality . In a new blue_chip survey of 50 economists , American exports to foreign customers topped the list of forces seen as strengthening the national economy next year . Analysts say an unusual confluence of forces could magnify the significance of foreign consumers to America ' s recovery in the coming months . Already , U.S. makers of cars , chemicals , paper goods and other products are enjoying a rising demand for their products , following a notably weak 1993 . On the Gulf_of_Mexico , Union Carbide factories have stepped_up sales of specialty petrochemicals used for paint solvents to meet European demand that has increased about 5 % in recent months . &quot; We ' ve seen a gradual but noticeable improvement since the beginning of the year , &quot; said Irv H . Agard , Union Carbide ' s director of financial planning and analysis . Late last year , executives at paper maker Georgia-Pacific Corp . noticed a jump in_demand from their customers in Italy and Britain . As the pickup spread to Germany and France , it has tested the limits of their U.S. mills , already straining near capacity . &quot; The demand from customers is beyond what we can supply , &quot; company spokesman Ken Haldin said . For all its seeming gloom , at least a_few clues to the shifting picture can be found in the fine print of Tuesday ' s trade report . So far this year , U.S. exports of industrial engines are up 20 % over the first five months of 1993 , for example . Exports of computers are up 13 % , semiconductors 30 % and telecommunications_equipment 21 % . &quot; We ' re increasingly competitive in the areas that are important to us , &quot; said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp . in Minneapolis . Overall , U.S. merchandise exports are up 5.7 % , according to the latest data ; that is somewhat higher than last year ' s rise of 3.7 % . The gains , while limited , encourage those who are searching for continued sources of U.S. growth . The peak levels of housing and auto sales , for example , may already be over , many believe , factors that could slow the economy in 1995 . &quot; That leaves you one thing : exports , &quot; Bostian said . &quot; It ' s a critical bright spot. &quot; Optimists also cite a somewhat crumpled dollar as a sign of trade gains to come . The greenback ' s recent travails in the global currency markets have inspired disturbing headlines and been explained as a rebuke to U.S. leadership in the world . But when it comes_to exports , the reality of the slide is benign . The reason : A cheaper dollar may translate to cheaper prices against products from America ' s strong-currency rivals , notably Japan and Germany . * In addition , some experts believe that a much more intriguing phenomenon is taking_place than a mere shift in the exchange_rate or turn_in the business_cycle . Recent progress in U.S. technology , quality and manufacturing efficiency are increasingly being rewarded in the global marketplace . &quot; There is something at_work other_than economic_growth and changes in the dollar , &quot; said Ross C . DeVol , an economist with WEFA Group in suburban Philadelphia . &quot; Our underlying competitiveness has improved. &quot; DeVol believes he sees evidence of the fundamental change in America ' s recent trade performance with Britain and Canada . Both of those nations emerged from recession by 1992 . And in both cases , U.S. exports soared beyond trends established in previous overseas recoveries , he calculates . Exports to Britain shot_up by more_than 17 % last year -- six percentage_points more_than past history would suggest -- and they surged by more_than 12 % to Canada , possibly three percentage_points above past trends . &quot; If that holds true for Japan and Germany , we could be looking_at an export boom &quot; in the near future , he predicts . None of this means that a swollen trade_deficit , indefinitely maintained , is healthy . It can encourage foreign investors to unload their holdings in a country as the nation ' s currency drops . The United States has experienced some of this effect this year , as Japanese have slashed purchases of U.S. assets . Nor does_it mean that the trade_deficit is going_to narrow swiftly . Rising interest_rates threaten to have a party-pooping effect on Europe ' s nascent recoveries by limiting their ability to pull_in U.S. goods . Americans , meanwhile , are expected to maintain their appetite for foreign products -- ensuring a tremendous monthly import bill . Rising economies overseas &quot; should give us a nice boost in exports , &quot; said economist David Wyss at DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington , Mass . &quot; But they ' re not going_to solve all our problems. &quot; The U.S. expansion is still expected to outpace those of its major trading partners until mid-1995 , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris . * At about that time , the trade_gap is forecast to narrow , helped along by growing U.S. exports , declining imports in a weaker U.S. economy and the dollar ' s favorable , relatively low exchange_rate . In May , U.S. goods exports edged_up 0.2 % to $ 40.4 billion , paced by sales of office equipment . The goods deficit with Japan declined to $ 4.4 billion from $ 5.5 billion . Rising oil prices pushed America ' s foreign-oil bill up by $ 339 million . Imports of clothing , iron and steel and telecommunications_equipment also contributed to the nation ' s $ 54.5-billion tab for merchandise imports . The total deficit in goods was $ 14.1 billion , $ 700 million higher than April . Services -- a category that includes tourism , education and health_care -- registered a $ 4.9-billion surplus , up slightly from April . Despite the improving outlook , &quot; we have such a long way to go , it gives you pause , &quot; said Laurence H . Meyer , a private economic forecaster in St . Louis .</TEXT>
