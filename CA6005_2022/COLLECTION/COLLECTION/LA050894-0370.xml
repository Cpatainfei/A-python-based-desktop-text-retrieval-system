   <HEADLINE> TASTE OF TRAVEL : GREECE ; ATHENS OPENERS ; TRADITIONAL APPETIZERS GOOD_ENOUGH FOR THE GODS ARE MAKING THE MEAL IN MODERN OUZERIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mezedes were always my favorite dishes . As a child growing_up in Greece , I don ' t remember going_to restaurants much . But I distinctly recall the calm , simple and leisurely appetizer-like meals my family and I savored in tiny seaside taverns during summer holidays on the islands of the Aegean . The smell of grilled octopus , of freshly cut tomato and cucumber , the aroma of dried oregano and , of course , the sweet perfume of ouzo are forever tied to those happy summer days by the sea . Perhaps this is the reason small , simple ouzeries where mezedes are served are still my favorite restaurants , even now that I must eat_in all kinds of fancy places for my newspaper food column . Yet it is not just the food but the tradition that makes_it so appealing_to me , and to tourists , who might not have had_the_best food experiences in Athens . The problem is that our best food is still found in homes . While Athenians do go_out to restaurants , our dining-out experience often has more to do with socializing than with eating . It has only been recently that the young people -- who don ' t cook as much as previous generations -- have begun to demand quality . The one exception to this is the meze experience , which in addition to being food of very good quality , is an excellent introduction to Greek cuisine . It is a tradition that we know has existed for centuries , with dishes that were written_about as far back as the 3rd Century BC . * What Italians call antipasti and the Spanish call tapas , we call mezedes ( plural for meze ) . But unlike the Italian and Spanish snack tradition , when Greeks invite someone &quot; for a meze , &quot; we usually mean a meal composed of several little dishes , which often replace lunch although they can also be dinner . Generally , a meze is a bunch of friends sitting around a small table , each one with fork in_hand , diving into small plates that keep coming at a steady pace . Whoever manages &quot; the quickest fork &quot; -- as the Greek saying goes -- will succeed in tasting all_of the dishes . The rest must wait for the next round that will inevitably follow . Such a meze lunch can last for hours , and takes_place in restaurants around the city , as well as at_home in the kitchen , the sitting or dining room , on the balcony or , perhaps , in the garden on a sunny day . Special restaurants that serve meze are mainly the ouzeries , which are named for ouzo , the strong aniseed-flavored drink that usually accompanies mezedes . Ouzo can be drunk neat , but most people dilute it : three parts water to one part ouzo . This sweet tasting drink compliments well the strong flavored meze dishes , especially the pickles and the very garlicky sauces and spreads whose flavors would kill the more delicate wines . Ouzeries used to be shabby little corner shops , typically hangouts inhabited by men , where blue-collar workers and small-time merchants went_to get a bite and a karafaki ( pitcher or small bottle ) of ouzo , share it with friends and discuss soccer , politics and women . . . usually in that order . Not anymore . The new breed of ouzeries -- like those in this story -- are located in the downtown Athens area and are becoming more sophisticated in_order to attract a new clientele . More and more popular among middle and upper Athenian society , ouzeries have become the favored lunch_meeting places of both men and women . Shoppers and shop owners , office clerks and CEOs spend their lunch breaks there , now that most businesses observe continued hours , rather than going_home for lunch and a siesta and then resuming work in the late afternoon , as was the custom until the last five years or so . But ouzo is not the only drink that accompanies a meze . The typical old Athenian taverns , also known as krasopoulia ( wine shops ) , customarily still serve house retsina ( resinated wine ) along with mezedes . Resinated wine is not a modern invention . Ancient Greeks threw pieces of pine_tree bark into wine , thinking that the resin would keep it from spoiling . The result was similar to what we drink today . Although some people dislike it , there are many who love retsina , especially in its lighter , modern version . And like ouzo , retsina goes well with the more zesty Greek meze dishes , especially those with smoky , garlicky or acidulous flavors , such_as roasted eggplant spread or pickled vegetables . There are still a_few krasopoulia operating in Athens around the Central Market and in some old neighborhoods . Most are located in basements with a_few tables set next to large barrels containing the wine . The whole setup would transfer the visitor right back to the ' 50s . These taverns have no printed menu and the four or five dishes they serve ( differing each day ) are usually humble and not remarkable . But if you are lucky , you may stumble upon an exquisite fasolada ( bean soup ) or revithada ( chick pea_soup ) that will taste like good , hearty home-cooked food . Although not necessarily part of a meze , it is so common to these krasopoulia that locals often ask_for_it . It is particularly prevalent in the winter . * One of the pleasures of going_out for a meze lunch or dinner is sharing a tiny table with friends . Hardly anyone goes_to an ouzery or krasopoulio alone . It would n ' t be much fun . The conversation could never be as sprightly and it would be impossible to taste more_than two or three mezedes by yourself . Of course , in the more sophisticated restaurants there is always the possibility of ordering a pikilia , a plate of different meze samples . But somehow the ouzery tradition is synonymous with sharing food and drink that is ordered &quot; for the table. &quot; ( In most ouzeries you will also find a selection of Greek wines and beers , but krasopoulia only serve their own retsina. ) A typical meze may include simple things , such_as feta cheese drizzled with olive_oil and sprinkled with dried oregano , different kinds of olives -- green , cracked olives , smooth , black Kalamatas and wrinkled black_olives -- pickled octopus and lakerda , or marinated slices of smoked mackerel . It may also include more complicated dishes such_as spinach or wild greens pie wrapped in phyllo pastry , either fried or baked , stuffed vine leaves with or without meat , salt_cod fritters served with garlic_sauce , eggplant or zucchini slices dipped in batter and deep fried and served with garlic_sauce or tzatziki , a garlicky yogurt with mint or dill and shredded cucumber . Marides -- tiny fried fish eaten whole ( head and bones , included ) -- is very much sought after as a meze , when the catch provides , and so is fava , a thick paste made by boiling_down yellow split peas into a dish similar to Indian dahl . A specialty of the island of Santorini , fava is mixed with chopped scallions or pungent red_onion , dill , oregano and capers and moistened with fruity olive_oil and fresh lemon_juice and served cold . It is eaten with fresh country bread or as a side_dish . The classic Greek spreads : Eggplant and taramosalata ( made of fish eggs , bread , scallion , lemon olive_oil ) , are seldom missing from a meze table . Fried lamb ' s liver , spleen or other innards are meze dishes very much appreciated by the Greeks . And you will often hear the locals ordering ameletita ( the unmentionables ) , which are fried lamb ' s testicles . Sadly , of the old breed of Athenian ouzeries , only Apotsos has survived . It is only a_few blocks from Syntagma ( or Constitution ) Square , the central area of downtown Athens that contains Parliament ; on the back of a dark but safe shopping arcade . Like many other old-fashioned ouzeries , Apotsos first opened in another location as a grocery_store and ouzery at the beginning of the century . In its present guise , it is located in a large but charming , high-ceilinged , typically Greek room decorated with old Greek and European posters . Apotsos ' specialties include meat and cheese dishes , rather than the vegetables and legumes that are popular in many other places serving mezedes . Fried liver , country sausage and small meatballs served with mustard on the plate , as well as saganaki -- fried slices of kasseri , a cheese similar to Italian Pecorino -- and , of course , ameletita , are the most sought-after mezedes here . The marble tables are filled with journalists and politicians , as the place is only a_few blocks from Parliament . A few years back Apotsos used to be the place for people to go_for a meze lunch but recently its clout seems to be fading as the fashionable crowd has , literally , moved_up the_hill to the Kolonaki ouzeries . Three restaurants in Kolonaki -- a posh neighborhood within the center of Athens , on the slope of Mt . Lycabettus -- represent the new breed of ouzeries that Athenian yuppies prefer . To Grafeio ( The Office ) is situated on Dexameni square and its decor is high tech with old-framed architectural engravings decorating the walls . There is a long window where the foods served each day are displayed . Shrimp baked in individual clay pots with tomato_sauce and feta cheese , several different salads , and expensive delicacies such_as smoked eel and trout , are served along with the traditional fried salted_cod , calamari , taramosalata spread , meatballs and fava . Lunch is served beginning at noon , and by 2 p.m. on weekdays the place is packed with smartly dressed people from the neighboring offices and shops . To Grafeio was until recently open late at night ( from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. ) , serving soups and especially patsa -- the tripe soup traditionally eaten_in Greece in the wee hours , as the ideal food to settle the stomach after a long night of cigarettes and drinks . But earlier this year the Ministry of Public Orders passed a law through Parliament that obliges all bars , cabarets and restaurants to close at 2:30 a.m. There was quite an outcry by many Greeks who like to stay_up late and thought that their civil_rights had been violated by this law , so it is possible that the restrictions will soon be forgotten . But at the moment , To Grafeio only opens for lunch and serves food until 6 p.m. Yali Kafene -- a_few blocks from the Byzantine Museum , is a small place with a lot of character . Its small marble tables are set_on two levels and its walls are filled with bric-a-brac and Greek crafts . In the spring and summer there are a_few tables set_on the sidewalk outside . The food is freshly cooked and varies from one day to the next , but it always has an unmistakable home-cooked quality . I particularly love the chickpeas with spinach , the seafood risotto , the fried salted_cod and also the mayeritsa -- a spring lamb soup with lots of lemon , dill and scallion . Hardly an ouzo meze , mayeritsa is the soup served traditionally on Easter night , right after the 40 days of fasting that precede Greek Orthodox Easter . But it can be found at Yali Kafene after Christmas , when spring lamb is available . * One block uphill from Yali Kafene , To Kafeneio is the only one of the ouzeries that has tables with tablecloths . The place has no character but the food is good . I particularly like the zucchini patties scented with mint , and the gardoumbakia ( lamb ' s innards wrapped in lamb ' s intestines and cooked in a lemony sauce with olive_oil and oregano ) . Eggplant baked with cheese , fava , squid with spinach and an unusual salad with all kinds of seasonal vegetables and shredded uncooked zucchini -- a vegetable rarely eaten raw in Greece -- are other dishes worth tasting . Salamandra is another interesting ouzery . Lodged_in a transformed old neoclassical house -- a block from Athens University law_school in an area filled with bookstores -- Salamandra attracts a more intellectual crowd . Tables are set_on three levels and the food served is imaginative . You will find lahanodolmades ( stuffed cabbage leaves with meat and rice in egg and lemon sauce ) , boiled wild greens , potato_salad with black-eyed beans , shrimp with saffron , mussels cooked in wine , stuffed spleen in tomato_sauce and grilled meatballs served with boukovo ( a condiment that is a combination of dried hot and sweet red_pepper flakes from Northern Greece ) on the side . As a dessert you can have a plate of walnuts with thyme honey , or yogurt with a_few tablespoons of honey and walnuts . In addition to the many kinds of ouzo , all_of those ouzeries also serve tap beer by the glass , as well as a wide selection of Greek white and red_wines . You will also find wines by the glass . For those who would like to try a versatile fruity chilled wine with their food , I recommend Mantinia , from the region of the same name in the Peloponnese . For more adventurous tourists who want to get a glimpse of how old Athenian taverns used to be , I suggest a visit to Diporto , after a tour of Athens ' Central Market . Diporto has two doors , as its name implies : One on Sokratous and one on Theatrou street . It is in a small basement situated under the most spectacular olive shop in the Central Market area and is a typical krasopoulio . The tables -- laid next to the huge barrels -- are few but large and you are likely to be seated with other guests . The waiter will recite the day ' s menu but if you don ' t speak Greek you can go_to the kitchen and point_out the foods you want . Fried or grilled small , inexpensive fish -- the catch of the day from the Central Market fish purveyor across the square -- fried innards , bean or chickpea soup or vegetable stew are usually available . The only drink served here is the house retsina but it is very good . Most of the customers are people who either own or work in shops of the market , and later in the afternoon , after they have consumed a considerable amount of retsina , you may find them in a singing mood . GUIDEBOOK Greek Beginnings Where to eat : The popular ouzeries are usually packed for lunch by about 2 p.m. and from 10 p.m. for dinner .
