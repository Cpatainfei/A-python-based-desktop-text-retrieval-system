   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : MINOR ' S DEATH RAISES ISSUES OF DRINKING ON CRUISE_SHIPS ; LAW : THE AGE LIMIT DROPS TO 18 AT_SEA . A SPOKESMAN REMINDS PARENTS THAT A CRUISE IS A RESORT VACATION , NOT BABY-SITTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Early on the morning of Friday , July 22 , the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line ' s ship Majesty of the Seas made its way from Jamaica to the Bahamas , sailing as usual under Norwegian registry . On an upper_deck , a small group of young people gathered and got_to drinking . One of those young people was Hayman Ronald Lucas , a 14-year-old boy from Elmont , N.Y. , whose father and stepmother were apparently asleep in their cabin . Hayman was a big boy -- 5-foot-4 and 195 pounds -- but he drank a lot more tequila and rum than his body could handle . Over the course of the early morning hours , authorities say , he pushed his blood-alcohol level to at least 0.29 , more_than three times the California legal threshold for intoxication , and apparently drank himself to death . An investigation found that the alcohol the boy drank was supplied by a 24-year-old ship passenger who acquired it ashore during a previous port call . Whose fault is the death ? Whose law applies ? And as an isolated occurrence in a generally placid corner of the travel industry , should this incident send any particular message to the traveling public ? The first two questions may never be sorted_out to the satisfaction of all concerned . But many authorities agree that among travelers and cruise lines , the interaction of young people , alcohol and ships merits close attention . Most notably , many travelers may_not realize that although the minimum legal drinking_age in all 50 states is 21 , the rules of most cruise lines , including Royal Caribbean , allow 18-year-olds to order alcohol once their ships are in international waters . Beyond that , cruise officials and others say , adult passengers need to remember that while they may be leaving American laws and their workaday lives behind , they ' re placing themselves under new laws and retaining plenty of responsibilities , including the welfare of children . &quot; The best advice that you can give , &quot; said Jim Lida , manager of corporate communications for Royal Caribbean Cruise Line , &quot; is that a cruise is a resort vacation . It ' s not a baby-sitting service. &quot; Cruise industry officials say they don ' t see any missteps on the part of Royal Caribbean . But they do acknowledge that the ship staffs need to be sure that their enforcement of shipboard rules keeps_up with their marketing efforts to bring younger cruisers and more families aboard . &quot; This incident has made a lot of cruise lines take a close look_at their policies regarding alcohol and minors , &quot; said Julie Benson , spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Princess Cruises . From the Florida State_Attorney ' s office come the following details from the probe of last month ' s death : The group of drinkers , which apparently included half_a_dozen teens under 18 , one 18-year-old and the 24-year-old who supplied some or all_of the alcohol , was apparently gathered on an upper pool deck from roughly 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. A crew_member found the boy staggering on deck at about 5 a.m. , and escorted him to his family ' s cabin , and his father and stepmother were awakened . It was several hours later , about 11 a.m. , that the boy ' s stepmother called the ship ' s medical office and reported that the boy had stopped breathing . After doctors ' resuscitation efforts failed , the boy was pronounced dead at 12:05 p.m. Preliminary reports named alcohol poisoning as cause of death ; at press time , the Dade County Medical_Examiner ' s Office was still awaiting results of toxicology tests . Based on that information , &quot; I would find it very difficult to hold the cruise line responsible , &quot; said Ed Perkins , editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter . &quot; Are you going_to sue a city park because some 24-year-old buys booze and feeds it to a 14-year-old ? &quot; In the immediate aftermath of the death , many accounts noted that because the Majesty of the Seas was in international waters , there was essentially no minimum legal drinking_age aboard the ship . Not so , say several authorities . After a preliminary investigation by officers from the Miami-based Metro Dade Homicide unit , officials from the Florida State_Attorney ' s office said they could claim jurisdiction because a majority of the ship ' s passengers embarked in Miami . Michael R . Band , chief_assistant state_attorney in that office , said last week that a decision had not been made about whether to file criminal charges in the incident . But jurisdiction questions can be murky . Attorney Larry Kaye , whose firm , Kaye , Rose , Tamulski &amp; Maltzman , has represented more_than a dozen cruise lines ( including Royal Caribbean ) points_out that travelers on ships in international waters ( more_than three miles from land , generally ) are often considered subject_to the laws in the ships ' nation of registry . Cruising on a foreign-flagged ship , Kaye said , can be &quot; basically no different than entering a foreign country. &quot; For various business reasons , including tax_rates and crewing requirements , most cruise_ships serving American passengers are registered in Liberia , Italy , Greece , Norway , Great Britain , Holland , the Bahamas or Panama . But Kaye said he has never encountered a nation of registry with a minimum drinking_age of less than 18 . The daunting problem for a cruise line , Kaye said , is that if there ' s a minor drinking , &quot; how do you become aware of it , especially if it ' s late at night , or it ' s being concealed , or it ' s in a cabin , or it ' s alcohol that was obtained ashore ? &quot; When docked , cruise_ships follow liquor laws of local jurisdictions . Here ' s a sampling of policies at_sea : * Policy on Royal Caribbean ships , as on most lines , is to issue every passenger a boarding card . Most passengers have one hole punched_in their cards to indicate that they have accounts open_to pay_for shipboard purchases . The boarding cards of passengers under 18 , spokesman Lida said , are punched with three holes , to indicate that the bearer shouldn ' t be served alcohol . * On the nine ships of Princess Cruise Line , passengers under 18 have the letter &quot; M &quot; imprinted on their boarding_cards . In &quot; questionable &quot; cases a spokeswoman said , servers can ask_for photo identification . * At Norwegian Cruise Line , which operates six ships , spokeswoman Fran Sevcik said crews in international waters will sell beer and wine to passengers age 18 or older , but hard_liquor only to passengers 21 or older . Servers rely_on photo identification , not boarding cards , to confirm passengers ' ages , Sevcik said . * On the three ships of Royal Cruise Line , the drinking_age at_sea is 18 for beer and wine , 21 for more potent drinks . * On the two U.S.-based ships of Costa Cruise Lines , a spokeswoman said , servers ask_for photo identification whenever they ' re unsure that a passenger is over 18 . * On Carnival Cruise Line ' s nine ships , servers enforce their minimum age of 18 by asking_for photo identification from passengers whose appearance suggests that they may be under age . If a passenger under 18 is caught trying to order a drink , a spokeswoman said , servers are instructed to punch a hole in the boarding card .</TEXT>
