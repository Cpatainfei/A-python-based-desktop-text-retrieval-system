   <HEADLINE> PEROT CALLS GULF DEPLOYMENT A PLOY ; POLITICS : FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ACCUSES CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION OF MOVING TROOPS TO BOLSTER NOVEMBER ELECTION RESULTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Calling President Clinton &quot; a draft_dodger , &quot; a combative and prickly Ross Perot on Sunday accused the White_House of springing news of ominous Iraqi troop movements as a ploy to bolster Democratic popularity as the November elections approach . &quot; It ' s the most cynical thing in the world , &quot; the 1992 independent presidential candidate said . &quot; It is rotten . It is wrong. &quot; Referring to the current U.S. intervention in Haiti , Perot , playing the role of a fictitious Clinton adviser , said : &quot; The first war didn ' t get him a bump in the polls , now let ' s try a second one. &quot; To back_up his charges , the Texas businessman asserted that the President and his national security team &quot; have known this ( the Iraqi troop movements ) for weeks , &quot; assuming , he added , that &quot; the CIA is not dead and buried. &quot; Interviewed on CBS-TV ' s &quot; Face the Nation , &quot; Perot also offered his prescription for defusing the mounting tensions along the Iraq-Kuwait border : &quot; Just tap him ( Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ) on the shoulder quietly and say : ' Don ' t do anything tricky -- because we ' ve got unlimited unmanned missiles , unmanned drones . We will wipe your country out . We did_it once , we ' ll do_it again. ' &quot; If that tactic failed , Perot had a ready alternative : the assassination of Hussein . &quot; Saddam Hussein is the problem . Eliminate the problem , and your problem goes_away , &quot; he said . Perot , who is re-emerging in the political_arena after an unsuccessful personal campaign against the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , did not address the morality of political assassinations . But he left little doubt that he believed_in the efficacy of such action . Referring to U.S. bombing raids against Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi during the 1980s , Perot noted : &quot; We didn ' t kill him , but have you heard from him since ? This guy has repented , been reborn . He ' s a choirboy in the Middle East. &quot; An April 15 , 1986 , U.S. bombing raid on Tripoli killed 38 people , including Kadafi ' s 15-month-old adopted daughter , Hana . Perot also called the President ' s top advisers &quot; a lightweight crowd &quot; and made unsubstantiated allegations that Haiti ' s elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , is a drug dealer -- and that he has misappropriated millions of dollars in U.S. aid . Rick Newcombe , director of the Treasury_Department ' s Office of Foreign Asset Control , could not be reached Sunday for a response . A White_House spokesman refused to comment on Perot ' s charges . Aside from his shrill tone , Perot ' s remarks stand_out because critics of a President usually tone_down their attacks during a time of heightened tensions . But Perot was unapologetic . &quot; This whole_thing with Saddam Hussein is a tiny little event . Don ' t suddenly turn this into a worldwide media event just as you come_to an election . that ' s what I ' m saying , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re going to pay with our sons ' and daughters ' lives if he ( Clinton ) stumbles into something else stupid. &quot; Turning_to a reporter on the program , Perot snapped : &quot; You ' re saying : ' Why are you being so harsh ? ' Some great young_person with stars in his eyes , wearing the uniforms of the United States , will have his life put at risk by people who don ' t know what they ' re doing. &quot;</TEXT>
