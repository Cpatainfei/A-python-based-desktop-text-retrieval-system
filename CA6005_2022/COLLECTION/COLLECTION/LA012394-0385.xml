   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : CENTRAL : LITTLE TOKYO ; YAOHAN WORKERS PICKET OVER WAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joined by members of other labor_unions , employees of Yaohan markets picketed the local store to protest the Japanese supermarket company ' s refusal to grant periodic wage increases to workers at its nine U.S. stores . Carrying protest signs written in Japanese and English , several dozen workers picketed in front of the store at 333 S . Alameda St. , where the headquarters of Yaohan U.S.A. Corp . are also located , for about two hours Jan . 14 . The demonstrators distributed bilingual flyers to customers and chanted , &quot; Contract now ! &quot; The Yaohan grocery employees , who are represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers union , were joined by representatives from Justice for Janitors , the AFL-CIO and Local 11 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees ' Union , as well as by members of local teachers and garment_workers unions . Yaohan U.S.A. is part of Yaohan Group International , a worldwide company with department_stores and supermarkets in Hong Kong , Great Britain , Japan and the United States . The supermarkets feature Asian foods and groceries . The 400 to 500 workers at Yaohan U.S.A. ' s six Southern California stores and its San Jose , Chicago and New Jersey sites have been without a contract since their three-year pact expired in September , according to United Food and Commercial Workers officials . The bone of contention has been the company ' s adherence to a merit-raise plan . The union contends such a system encourages favoritism and discrimination by management , breeding discontent and low morale . In fact , union_members claim the company has granted raises to management officials , most of whom are Japanese , while denying them to hard-working and loyal produce workers , janitors and other grocery workers , many of whom are of other ethnicities . &quot; We want to work_out a reasonable wage-increase table and make_sure everyone gets an increase periodically , &quot; said Art Takei , spokesman for the Los Angeles chapter of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance , a national organization of union_members of Asian ancestry . In a Dec . 28 letter to Yaohan U.S.A. administrators , Ed Miyakawa , president of the alliance ' s local chapter , wrote : &quot; We are concerned with the public perceptions of Yaohan Co . You are a company owned by a Japanese corporation . As such , you are obligated to live_up_to our rules of enlightened labor relations where your employees are treated in a fair and just manner. &quot; Akio Kawai , an administrator for Yaohan U.S.A. , contended the company ' s international negotiator in late December presented to national union leaders a modified compromise proposal that stopped short of offering across-the-board raises but included &quot; several things we felt the company could afford regarding wages. &quot; &quot; We feel we ' re pretty close to reaching agreement , &quot; Kawai said . &quot; It ' s disappointing that the local unions , not knowing what ' s really on the table , are doing this . As a company , we value our employees . They ' re our No . 1 resource . We ' re constantly improving our benefits and wages. &quot; But Andrea Zinder , director_of_research , collective_bargaining and education for local 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers , vowed to step_up publicity efforts -- which she said could lead to boycotts or employee walkouts -- until the issue is settled . &quot; After six months of negotiations with this company , they still refuse to recognize simple union demands , &quot; she said . Other Asian American labor_leaders also chastised Yaohan at the recent rally . Said Susan Minato , an organizer with the Hotel and Restaurant Employees union : &quot; As a person of Japanese ancestry , it makes me ashamed , and as a believer in the Los Angeles community , it really ( ticks ) me off. &quot; IRIS YOKOI</TEXT>
