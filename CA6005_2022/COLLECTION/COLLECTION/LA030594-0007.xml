   <HEADLINE> DOGS TRAINED FOR DISASTERS ARE AN ALL-TOO-RARE BREED ; EMERGENCIES : ALTHOUGH MOST SAT OUT THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE , THERE MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH NEXT TIME , OFFICIALS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They are of a certain breed , these people of the disaster dogs . Crazy about their animals , psyched for catastrophe , altruists at heart . And their dogs ? A very elite corps . In all_of California , there are only seven working dogs certified ready for disaster work , the toughest there is . The Northridge earthquake could have been their Big One , rife_with canine heroics etched in the public ' s mind . But with few collapsed buildings , the dogs mostly sat on the sidelines , without the kind of publicity that could have rallied more people -- and dogs -- to their cause : saving human lives . All of which has left the dog people warning that when the next one hits , the dearth of disaster dogs may prove disastrous indeed . There are hundreds of dogs who work for a living , tracking wandering Alzheimer ' s patients and children lost in the woods . Dogs sniff_out everything from accelerants used by arsonists to narcotics smuggled by criminals to homemade sausages lovingly tucked inside a traveler ' s suitcase from overseas . But disaster dogs , who inhabit yet another realm in the service of human_beings , are much scarcer than the other working types . About four years after California developed its system of eight urban search-and-rescue units -- and assigned four dogs and handlers to each 56-member team -- the state is still 25 dogs short . And all but Hek , the retired police_dog , live outside the Los Angeles County_line . &quot; In the case of a really big disaster , with lots of buildings down , the smartest thing we could do would be to call_on Switzerland , &quot; says Hek ' s owner and volunteer handler , Inglewood Police Sgt . Ty Cobb . In a disaster , not just any dog can have its day . The training is long and arduous . The dogs must be unflappable , agile , obedient and must love to play . They should be able to distinguish between a living person or , say , Pseudo Corpse 1 and Pseudo Corpse 2 , and among the &quot; body in a bottle &quot; scents designed to train the sensitive canine nose . They should not expect anything beyond praise , or perhaps an edible treat , as a reward . The same goes_for their handlers . In the world of canine disaster work , volunteerism rules . Money and time are tight . And , as the Northridge earthquake proved , not even disasters guarantee a stage for the dogs to strut their stuff . In a disaster , trained canines are the quickest and surest way to find people buried by debris . As such , the dog people have spent years trying to persuade government officials that Chicken Littles they are not . Infrared sensors can ' t see_through concrete ; fancy listening equipment is all but useless amid the cacophony of disaster work . Many dog people yearn to emulate the_Swiss , whose state-supported dog teams travel the world on a moment ' s notice to discover people hidden under rubble , mud and snow . Although the_Swiss model may forever be a pipe_dream in the United States , the ranks of certified disaster dogs are expected to grow . California handlers say about a dozen are making sufficient progress . But in Fontana last weekend , nearly half the dogs who took state certification tests flunked . And California , mecca for calamities natural and man-made , is more advanced than any other state in the field of emergency response , including dogs . The Federal Emergency Management Agency copied California when it set_up its own national disaster response network of 25 units , including California ' s eight . But they , too , are always short of dogs . Several disaster teams throughout the country can ' t yet muster a single one . &quot; We are not prepared , &quot; says Shirley Hammond , a volunteer handler in Palo Alto who coordinates disaster dogs for California ' s Office of Emergency Services . &quot; It ' s hard for those of us who have spent all this time training to realize that we are not making that big a dent. &quot; The reasons range from perennial money problems to disasters that strike without warning . Unlike other working_dogs -- such_as those used by law_enforcement to sniff_out drugs , explosives and smuggled human_beings -- a disaster dog could conceivably spend its entire career in training , just waiting for the Big Enough One to strike . &quot; We would love to have seven times 70 dogs , &quot; says Michael Douglass , the Office of Emergency Services ' assistant chief in the fire and rescue division . &quot; It ' s just that it takes a lot of time . And all_the handlers , for the most part , are volunteers. &quot; This brings a special set of problems , too . In California , there are four separate and often feuding associations of search-and-rescue dogs , of which disaster dogs are the most highly trained . Each believes its training methods are_best . All members are passionate about their animals and dedicated to the nobility of volunteer disaster search . Some , such_as Hammond , even quit their paying jobs to always be available should disaster call . &quot; ( But ) their dogs get_along much better than they do , &quot; says Mark Ghilarducci , manager of the program in the Office of Emergency Services . &quot; The handlers can be their own worst enemies . We can ' t get them to agree on a damn thing. &quot; The same can be said for dog people nationwide . &quot; We are all strong-minded and have got an opinion , &quot; says Bill Dotson , a nationally recognized dog trainer who works with Virginia ' s Dogs East . In California , however , the Office of Emergency Services convinced the disaster dog people to form a confederation that administers tests -- such_as the one held last weekend -- to certify dogs for disaster work in the state . The California standard is more rigorous than that used by FEMA for national and international disaster work . The dog associations are still grumbling , however , over the California standards ( too tough or not tough enough ? ) and whether the pass / fail method of grading is best . One recent canine aspirant , for example , failed because it urinated during the exam . Another was hit by a car and injured its leg . Yet another dog , already certified ready , has been involuntarily ( perhaps temporarily ) retired because its owner , an Inglewood police_officer , just gave_birth to her second child . Human families still come first . * San Bernardino awoke to one of its worst disasters May 12 , 1989 , when a freight_train hauling 69 cars full of trona derailed and crashed into a residential neighborhood at Duffy Street . Eleven homes were seriously damaged and four people were killed . But because the trona , an ash-like compound of hydrous sodium_carbonate , had blanketed the area , rescue workers had no way to know whether anybody else was buried under the debris . The state Office of Emergency Services_called for search-and-rescue dogs by 10 a.m. , but it was not until six hours later that Shirley Hammond and her red Doberman , Cinnamon , arrived from Northern California . Within minutes of its arrival , the dog picked_up a human scent and local resident Chris Shaw was rescued . &quot; What I could not understand is that there were literally no qualified dogs around , &quot; says state Assemblyman Paul A . Woodruff ( R-Moreno Valley ) , who was at the scene . &quot; We had to fly one in . If that person had had any serious injury , or just loss of blood , he would have been dead. &quot; Woodruff ' s has been a lonely voice for the dogs in Sacramento , and he is not running_for reelection this year . And the limited use of disaster dogs during the Northridge earthquake didn ' t exactly start a legislative stampede to the cause . &quot; What this does is again postpone the inevitable , &quot; Woodruff says . &quot; The question is : How many children are going_to have to die in a collapsed classroom before local_government takes_advantage of sharing responsibility for acquiring these dogs ? &quot; * Like most of Southern California , firefighter Walt Harrison and his family in Yucaipa awoke with a jolt before dawn Jan . 17 . As a volunteer member of Riverside County ' s urban search-and-rescue team , Harrison was prepared . After the shaking stopped , he and his wife and three children -- and his disaster dog , Misty -- moved_into their trailer stocked with emergency supplies . Then he waited for the call directing him to the quake ' s front_lines . &quot; I was excited about going , &quot; Harrison says . &quot; that ' s what I live for . I want to find live people . I ' ve spent 3 1 / 2 years preparing her . It ' s like being a fireman . You like going_to the big fire. &quot; Harrison ' s mobilization call came at 8 a.m. &quot; Misty knew , &quot; he says of his yellow Lab . &quot; She sees me getting my stuff , she knows we ' re going to search . She loves it. &quot; But mostly , Harrison and his dog just stood_by . To combat boredom , they walked_around and watched TV . By the time they were summoned to the collapsed Northridge Meadows apartment complex , it was the afternoon of Jan . 18 , the day after the quake . There , Misty joined Cobb ' s dog from Inglewood and a golden_retriever from Bakersfield . And she quickly let Harrison know she smelled humanity amid the smashed mass of concrete debris . She did not bark , however , as she had done so many times in training when she &quot; alerts. &quot; Instead , she pawed at the floor . The victim -- the last one found at the complex -- was dead . The smell is distinct . No dog working during the disaster discovered anyone alive . Rescue workers who were at the Northridge Meadows apartments say they believe most of the victims died shortly after the earthquake . Bringing in the disaster dogs earlier would not have changed the result , they say . There were dogs from the Los Angeles Police_Department at the apartment_building on the morning of the collapse , but these &quot; felony dogs , &quot; who track armed suspects , are not trained for disaster work . * There are , of course , many levels of disasters to which dogs and handlers around the country respond . Hundreds of dog teams find people lost in the woods , in the snow , underwater and underground . The training for each location is different , although principles overlap . The Sigma chemical company in St . Louis , for example , manufactures an artificial odor of decomposing bodies -- Pseudo Corpse 1 and Pseudo Corpse 2 -- which dog handlers find ideal for training animals for what they call &quot; land cadaver &quot; work , the uncovering of graves . Using &quot; body in a bottle , &quot; as the chemical is affectionately known to handlers , is much easier than using real body_parts -- primarily from accidents -- which , until Pseudo Corpse ' s arrival about two years ago , was a training norm . Handlers dab the chemical , which is far too subtle for a human to smell , on an object , bury it and order the dog to search . The best dogs for such work , handlers say , are those who love to dig . Other rescue dogs are_better suited to aquatic careers . At a recent dog team training seminar in Wiggins , Miss. , Kody , a 3-year-old golden_retriever , was showing_off his water skills , eagerly jumping into a boat at the 1 # 900-acre Flint Water Park , his black nose held high as he sniffed the air . Soon Kody was barking at a spot in the water where a diver was hidden below . Angie Messina , the dog ' s owner , says Kody has recovered 43 drowning victims in the lakes and bayous around her home_in Slidell , La . The human scent lifts_off the water at the spot where the victim goes_down . But because smell travels much as smoke does , a handler must mentally map the air_currents before sending rescue divers down . Sometimes handlers throw talcum_powder in the air so they can see the air flow . Kody , too , was summoned along with other members of Slidell ' s all-volunteer American Search &amp; Rescue Assn . to the site of Amtrak ' s worst train wreck outside Mobile , Ala. , last September . Forty-four people were killed when a barge pulled by a tugboat strayed into a bayou shrouded in fog , then smacked into a railroad trestle minutes before the Amtrak Sunset Limited roared across -- and off -- the bridge . Although Kody has found many bodies before , the sudden crush of disaster victims seemed to overwhelm the dog . &quot; My dog , as seasoned as he is , he was so depressed , &quot; Messina says . &quot; I had to work real hard over three or four days to bring him back_up . The more experienced dogs , who knew what they were there for , they were depressed . The area was saturated with the death smell. &quot; Usually , however , handlers say that as gruesome as rescue work might turn_out to be , for the dog it is play . Barry Orange , a veterinarian in Clark , N.J. , says his Rottweiler , Maxine , loved the excitement in the aftermath of the World Trade Center bombing last year . &quot; She ' s real rough and tumble , &quot; Orange says . &quot; She does_good in collapsed buildings. &quot; Orange and his dog were called_in two days after the explosion to find bodies , but had to leave because conditions were still unsafe . Still , Maxine was rewarded for a job well done . If dogs don ' t get a prize , they won ' t bother playing the search-and-rescue game . Volunteer Carol Gardner , who works her coon hound , Polly , in searches throughout the South , says experience has taught her to first brief the family of a victim beforehand about on how the process works . &quot; I tell them , ' I ' m going_to do everything I can to find him , ' &quot; Gardner says . &quot; ' And I want you to know that it is not that I am being disrespectful , but when I do find him , I ' m going_to praise the dog . I ' m going_to play with him. ' &quot; That is often tough . Last November , police in Irvington , Ala. , called Gardner and Polly to search for the head of a woman whose sexually mutilated body they had found . They closed_off the interstate freeway and Polly sniffed at the spot in the dense grass where the body had been found . Within 10 minutes , the dog found a tissue with the victim ' s lip print and a perfume bottle -- and then , her head . &quot; She alerted , and was digging and kind of yelped , &quot; Gardner says . &quot; I figured that was it , but I really didn ' t want to see . Then , finally , I thought I ' d better look , to make_sure . It was the head , all right. &quot;</TEXT>
