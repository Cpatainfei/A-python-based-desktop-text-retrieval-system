   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; ' BURNING SEASON ' : REVEALING HUMANITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The word hero tends to get debased in a world that elevates its sports , film and pop_music stars to often gratuitous heights . What makes HBO ' s &quot; The Burning Season &quot; such a memorable viewing experience is that it movingly portrays the type of deep courage and humanity that lies behind our most worthy role_models . In this fact-based film about Brazilian activist Chico Mendes , hero isn ' t defined in the larger-than-life terms sometimes favored by television . Instead , director John Frankenheimer and actor Raul Julia present a decidedly ordinary man driven to extraordinary action through the sheer force of his moral conviction . Indeed , Mendes is a prototypical Everyman who is neither a fiery orator nor a worldly erudite . But what this union leader does possess is a native intelligence and an unshakable determination to fight for the rights of the oppressed rubber tappers in his province of Cachoeira . Armed with basic reading and writing skills that most of his rural compatriots lack , Mendes sets_out to stop the destruction of the Amazon rain_forest by cattle ranchers and government officials . &quot; The Burning Season &quot; concludes with a series of frightening statistics and facts regarding the ever-shrinking rain_forests . It ' s nearly impossible not to be affected by the disturbing aerial shots of lush forest lands being razed by roaring fires . But the film is hardly_a didactic plea to save the earth . For Mendes , who was taught as a child to respect the natural environment , the grass-roots movement he pilots has more to do with defending the land and work rights of his people than protecting the ozone_layer . In fact , the stubborn idealist expresses surprise when he discovers that he has become an international symbol for the environmental movement . An acutely visual filmmaker , Frankenheimer elicits choice performances from nearly all_of his actors . Tomas Milian plays the wicked rancher , Darli Alves , with a chilling arrogance . But it is Julia who anchors the movie . Looking slimmer than he ever has_on film , the Puerto Rican-born actor shows that he can carry a scene whether he ' s deep in reflection or bristling with outrage . * &quot; The Burning Season &quot; airs at 8 tonight on HBO , with repeats Tuesday , Sept . 25 and 28 , and Oct . 3 and 6 .
