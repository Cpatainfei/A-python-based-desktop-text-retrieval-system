   <HEADLINE> WESTSIDE WATCH : LIMITS ON BOARDWALK STALLS SPUR A GRASS-ROOTS PROTEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For 15 years , Jack Herer has been telling anyone who will listen that hemp is &quot; the most important thing in the world . . . . Sails , flags , maps , newspapers -- they ' re all made from hemp , which is the same thing as marijuana. &quot; Who knows ? Maybe there is even a little ganja in the paper used to produce a new plan that limits the spaces and operating hours of groups such_as Herer ' s -- HEMP , or Help End Marijuana Prohibition -- that set_up their shops on the Venice boardwalk . Under a pilot_project approved by the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks , booths along Oceanfront Walk will be subject_to a variety of restrictions -- among them , that they can be no longer than six feet . Officials contend that the booths are getting so big that they block emergency traffic . That burns Herer , whose , uh , grass-roots organization hands_out literature and merchandise every day from a table on the boardwalk . &quot; They ' re just trying to upscale ( the beach ) , &quot; Herer said . &quot; It ' s the last place I know of in Los Angeles where people can take their families and walk in a parade atmosphere. &quot; &quot; Naturally , everyone in the community is very upset about this , &quot; said Jerry Rubin , whose Los Angeles Alliance for Survival , a nonprofit peace group , also hands_out literature . &quot; It ' s unfair , unnecessary and restrictive . It destroys the free_spirit of Venice Beach. &quot; Niki Tennant , an aide to Councilwoman Ruth Galanter , said the pilot_program , which began May 30 , will continue through September . City park rangers will first warn violators , then start ticketing later in the summer , she said . The City_Council may make the program permanent . * TALKING TRASH : No , the &quot; D &quot; in D-day does not stand_for Dumpster . Someone should tell that to the trash haulers who stormed a West Hollywood City_Council meeting Monday on the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion . Waving miniature American flags and invoking everyone from Thomas_Jefferson to Henry Kissinger , haulers and their supporters protested a plan to have one company collect all trash in the city . That would cut truck_traffic and help coordinate recycling efforts , the city contends . But it also could mean lost business for the more_than 15 other haulers serving many apartments and businesses , plus higher prices for a third of city residents and businesses . Full of D-day fervor , opponents cast the plan as an unpatriotic assault on Americans ' fundamental right to choose . . . their own trash hauler . The proposal would create a &quot; legal monopoly that goes_against the American way , &quot; said attorney Tim Agajanian , representing a haulers group . &quot; that ' s not what we fought D-day for. &quot; Unmoved , the council approved the idea . Angry opponents vowed to take their offensive to a second front : the city voters . Two separate challenges may show_up on the local ballot this fall . It could be a lively little Dumpster war .</TEXT>
