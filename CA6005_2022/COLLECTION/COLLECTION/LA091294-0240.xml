   <TEXT> Forget the billionaire founder of Wal-Mart and &quot; Sam Walton : Made in America , My Story. &quot; Don ' t buy &quot; Iacocca : An Autobiography &quot; unless you can get_it for under a buck in the bookstore bargain bin . As for &quot; Get Better or Get Beaten &quot; -- get real . Takeover tales , billionaire bios and how-tos founded on fear are out , replaced by management meditations like &quot; Zen and the Art of Making a Living. &quot; &quot; Zen &quot; bills itself as &quot; a practical guide to creative career design , &quot; a &quot; career guide for human beings. &quot; Says the preface : &quot; It ' s really a book about love in action , about joy , about beauty , about caring. &quot; OK , so your boss doesn ' t define work as &quot; love in action &quot; and likely would not suggest a group visualization exercise to kick_off the next staff meeting . Still , a quick peek these days at the business section in any bookstore -- or the seminar roster at corporations from IBM to AT &amp; T -- will get you more about God and less about greed , more about the soul and less about statistics . Age has hit America ' s corps of corporate baby_boomers , causing hopes to dim and hair to dull . Downsizing has replaced growth . For the first time , this generation ' s universe is finite . In an era of lowered expectations and a search for a different kind of success , &quot; spirituality &quot; and &quot; business &quot; are no longer oxymorons . &quot; Finally people aren ' t laughing_at me , &quot; says Carol Orsborn , author of &quot; How Would Confucius Ask_for a Raise : One Hundred Enlightened Solutions for Tough Business Problems. &quot; Orsborn reads the I Ching along with the Wall_Street Journal and is a leading proponent of spirituality in the workplace . &quot; People are taking this seriously. &quot; &quot; This &quot; is the belief that you don ' t have to put_away your heart when you pick_up your briefcase , that the universe is a caring place that will take_care of you if you let it , that life is cyclical , that trying harder and working more can cause more harm than good . &quot; Though more and more is being written_about the need to apply spiritual principles in the business environment , we often have little idea of what spirituality looks and feels_like , &quot; Orsborn says in &quot; Confucius , &quot; which is her often-funny effort to answer that question . Problem No . 51 is an odd one for Eastern philosophy : What to do about a very Western IRS audit . Nonetheless , Osborne manages an artful I Ching answer that runs to three pages . Problem No . 80 gets a much less mystical response . Problem : &quot; I ' ve got a full-time job that saps so_much of my energy that there ' s nothing left in me to pursue my life ' s passion : sculpture . What can I do about this ? &quot; Succinct solution : &quot; Get a part-time job. &quot; An earlier Orsborn book called &quot; Inner Excellence : Spiritual Principles of Life-Driven Business &quot; was turned_down by more_than a score of publishers in the late 1980s . In contrast , &quot; Confucius &quot; was the main selection for the Fortune Book Club in June and was one of the Book of the Month Club ' s best selections in July . When &quot; Inner Excellence &quot; was being ignored , says Patti Breitman , Orsborn ' s agent , &quot; it was the message they were turning_down . The message was you don ' t have to put your spiritual self on hold when you go_to the office . I don ' t think the world was ready for that then. &quot; It may be now . A slender fable originally self-published in 1988 and called &quot; Zapp ! The Lightning of Empowerment &quot; has sold more_than a_million copies . Authors William C . Byham and Jeff Cox hope to re-create the success of their tale about the troubles and triumphs of the fictional Normal Company in Normalburg , U.S.A , with the more recent &quot; HeroZ : Empower Yourself , Your Co-workers , Your Company. &quot; * Decanted to its essence , the advice given_in most Tao-based business books can sound a tad simplistic without the lengthy historical and philosophical discourse given by most authors . The books in_general are based on Eastern-flavored positive thinking , visualization , relaxation , faith and the giving_up of control over all aspects of one ' s life . In fact , the necessary faith and optimism are perhaps the biggest stumbling_blocks for our oh-so-rational world . &quot; If you don ' t have faith , you end_up turning the business environment into a war zone , &quot; Orsborn says . &quot; Business becomes about survival . . . . If you aren ' t willing to take at least that leap of faith ( that the universe is benevolent and has an order of its own ) , you have to wonder what ' s going_to get you out of bed tomorrow. &quot; Hurdles aside , there is a growing market for this new crop of old ideas filtering into the American workplace , says Steven Piersanti , president of Berrett-Koehler Publishing , which specializes in books that link soul and salary . &quot; Work has taken center place in our lives , &quot; Piersanti says . &quot; People are starting to want more meaning out of it . More_than just a paycheck , they want fulfillment . . . . So the traditional business literature has been expanding. &quot; The New Age of Business Literature does more_than answer questions like : If a tree falls_in the forest , would Georgia-Pacific hear it and turn it into a cardboard box ? Jerry Lynch , co-author of &quot; Thinking Body , Dancing Mind : TaoSports for Extraordinary Performance in Athletics , Business , and Life , &quot; likes to tell the story of how the Tao Te Ching , an ancient book of Chinese wisdom , helped a Silicon_Valley middle manager get a Manager of the Year award . * &quot; When people would make mistakes or have a failure , say , in writing a proposal or making a product , he would reward anyone on the team who would find a solution to the problem , &quot; Lynch recounts . &quot; He had fantastic response . What it does to the people is they ' re more relaxed when working because they know they ' re not going_to get written_up . When you ' re relaxed , you ' re more creative. &quot;</TEXT>
