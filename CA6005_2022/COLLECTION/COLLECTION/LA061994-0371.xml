   <HEADLINE> MAKING IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO STAY ; INCENTIVES : FIRMS THAT HAVE LOOKED_AT GREENER PASTURES ELSEWHERE HOPE THE STATE WILL BUILD_ON ITS BUSINESS-FRIENDLY EFFORTS AND JUSTIFY THEIR DECISION TO REMAIN HERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> George Derby and his partner , Stephen Sellwood , have survived a host of horror stories that would scare any company out of California . Their operation , All Metals Processing of Orange County Inc. , was getting buried under onerous California regulations , high taxes and enough red_tape to strangle the profits out of even the biggest blue-chip business . The partners decided to talk with officials in four other states , with the idea of moving their Stanton metal finishing company and its 110 employees . But recently , with great reluctance , they spurned attractive offers and decided to stay_put . &quot; It was just too expensive to move , and we would have lost our customers , &quot; Derby said . &quot; Now we ' re betting that in three to five years , this will be a viable , profitable business here. &quot; Derby , like many business owners that have looked_at greener pastures elsewhere , is hoping that state lawmakers and regulators like the South Coast Air Quality Management District will shed their hostile attitude , build_on their budding business-friendly efforts and eventually justify All Metals ' decision not to abandon the Golden State . The general problem for business owners is that California , with stricter environmental and business regulations than other states , has become a world unto itself , said Doug Mills , vice_president for Fender Musical_Instruments , a maker of electric_guitars and amplifiers . &quot; The crux of the issue is , do we move_out of this area and become part of the rest of the world , or do we stay here and learn to survive , &quot; Mills said . &quot; For a myriad of reasons , we decided to stay. &quot; Through legislation and the use of so-called &quot; red teams , &quot; state and local leaders have become increasingly effective at getting_to disgruntled business owners quickly and easing such burdens as high electric costs or the quagmire of obtaining clean-air permits . The red teams , especially , have become more efficient and visible in the last 18 months in halting the flight of the state ' s industrial and commercial tax_base . The teams are ad_hoc groups of utility company executives and government officials , from the governor ' s office to the AQMD and local city_halls . Some companies that decided to stay in California rave about the efforts of the red teams . &quot; They really showed me that the state was trying to swing the pendulum back from how bad it was for business in the last four or five years , &quot; said Ron Kishen , plant manager for Avery Dennison Fasson . The self-adhesive paper maker decided last fall to keep its 120 employees in Rancho Cucamonga instead of moving the plant to Phoenix . The California Trade and Commerce Agency , which leads the state ' s overall efforts at economic development , has been prodding the state Legislature , state agencies and local_governments to pay more attention to the needs of business . &quot; Just as a company on a continuing basis looks_at what it needs to grow and remain competitive , California and governments at all levels have to do the same thing , &quot; said Julie Meier Wright , who heads the agency . &quot; Corporations continue to evolve , and government can do no less. &quot; The agency , as well as the business_community , is lobbying the Legislature to adopt new laws for the second straight year to give companies tax_credits and relief from some of the nation ' s strictest laws . But some lawmakers do not want to offer business incentives because they believe the cash-strapped state cannot afford it . Still , Gov . Pete Wilson has stashed_away $ 110 million to pay_for the first two years of a proposed five-year plan to give a 6 % tax_credit to big companies that generate new construction and new jobs . But the tax-credit bill so far is languishing in the Legislature . The regional air quality district , once one of the most intransigent state bureaucracies , also is changing its approach . &quot; The fact of the_matter is that we were starting to get dinged around pretty badly in the media , and we paused to consider the complaints , &quot; said Richard ( Nick ) Nikkila , an assistant deputy AQMD executive_officer . &quot; The more we looked_at it , the more we realized these guys are taking some big hits out there. &quot; * Henry W . Wedaa , the South Coast agency ' s chairman , said the district is driven by state and federal clean-air laws but now is &quot; doing things in moderation. &quot; He said the agency no longer can &quot; simply pass rules without concern about the economy. &quot; Instead of dictating how to reduce certain emissions , for instance , it is letting companies find their own ways to do_it . Business owners notice the changing attitude , but some think Sacramento should do more to compete with the attractive benefit packages put_together by such states as Texas and Nevada . Taco Bell Corp. , which has been_on a well-publicized yearlong search for new headquarters , was believed to be ready to announce that it would build a new home near its Irvine location . But it paused when a state Senate committee voted_down the proposed 6 % tax_credit last month . The Mexican-style , fast-food chain has missed three self-imposed deadlines to announce a decision . Now , the company is believed to be waiting to see if the state Legislature can resurrect the tax_credit in a budget law expected at the end of the month . In addition , Hughes Aircraft Co . is considering closing a Fullerton plant that employs 6 # 800 workers . The El Segundo-based company , suffering from the severe downturn in the defense and aerospace industries , has closed other plants in Southern California as it consolidated operations out of state . Other companies , big and small , simply are not waiting for the state any longer . Thrifty Drug Stores fled Los Angeles in April for Oregon , and house component maker Heydon Building Systems , with four employees in Santa Ana , recently relocated to Tucson . Heydon spokesman Peter Beher said he is upset with the state ' s efforts to &quot; save &quot; Taco Bell and its 1 # 000 jobs at the expense of smaller companies . &quot; What happens is they try to do a quick_fix for the big company , but what needs to be fixed is the entire underlying structure , &quot; Beher said . &quot; They ' ve got_to remember that a small business has two employees today , but it becomes a five-man office , then a 10-man operation , &quot; he said . &quot; California ' s future is encouraging small businesses . . . not trying to keep the big company by offering one incentive or another. &quot; * Companies like All Metals Processing , Avery Dennison Fasson , Fender Musical_Instruments and Martin Molded Rubber Products in north Orange County certainly hope the state continues to improve business conditions . They are part of a group that , with little fanfare and for a variety of reasons , have decided to stick it out_in California . Mills said that a big reason for Fender ' s decision to remain in Corona was a red team ' s help in negotiating &quot; reasonable solutions &quot; to the company ' s air quality problems . Fender moved from Brea three years ago without a comment from city officials . Now it is working with the city of Corona , the state and &quot; people we didn ' t even know existed , &quot; Mills said , to determine ways to comply with air quality limitations on the use of paints and lacquers with ozone-depleting emissions . Southern California Edison ' s special Consumer Technology Application Center assisted Fender by finding manufacturers capable of producing paints that meet AQMD emissions standards . Edison also worked with the agency in testing and evaluating available coatings . Edison ' s tech center in Irwindale helps small and mid-size companies that do not have the expertise , time or money to research and test new methods of manufacturing . &quot; Leaving the state is always an option , &quot; Mills said . &quot; We want to be compliant with state regulations . There are technological advances in paint manufacturing , and the day will come when we will have no volatile paint emissions. &quot; Fender now expects to add_up to 300 employees by this fall_in a new 103 # 000-square-foot addition at its Corona facility . Yet with workers ' compensation premiums still higher than in other states and other restrictions on business operations here , Mills said , &quot; Oklahoma doesn ' t look too bad. &quot; Avery Dennison Fasson also praises a red team that worked to keep the company ' s plant in Rancho Cucamonga . Fasson , a subsidiary of Avery Dennison in Pasadena , employs about 120 people in the San Bernardino County plant to put adhesives on paper to be used as labels , tags , stamps and a host of other pressure-sensitive products . One of Fasson ' s divisions , which makes rolls of adhesive paper , wanted to put a major plant in the West last year but looked_to Phoenix instead of California . Division executives figured the cost of doing business in California was 14 % to 16 % higher than it would be in Arizona , said Kishen , Fasson ' s plant manager . &quot; I didn ' t exactly buy those numbers . I wanted to take another look_at it , &quot; Kishen said , noting that if the rolled-paper division went_to Phoenix , headquarters would follow . He called the office of his state_senator , Bill Leonard ( R-Upland ) , and within 15 minutes an Edison employee -- a member of that area ' s red team -- called_back to ask about the problems Fasson faced and to set_up a meeting the following week . &quot; They brought_in just about everybody to that meeting , &quot; Kishen said . &quot; There were people from the city , the county , the AQMD , the state and the utility companies . About 15 people were there to find_out why we wanted to leave. &quot; * After Kishen detailed the problems -- sky-high workers ' comp premiums , high wages , bureaucratic red_tape , high utility bills -- he told them that the added costs amounted to a big penalty to do business here . Within two months , the red team returned with a series of proposals and also kept the company informed of the legislation then winding its way through the state Legislature to reform workers ' compensation laws . The proposals included ways to reduce all utility bills by 30 % to 35 % , Kishen said , which meant a savings of $ 250 # 000 a year . Soon , it became obvious that the added cost of doing business in California was not so high , certainly not high enough to justify the cost of relocating . Kishen , however , did not contain his analysis to California . Turning_to Arizona , he decided that the infrastructure -- roads , sewers and all_the amenities needed to operate a sizable company -- was in poor_shape . With rapid_growth in the number of companies moving there , he said , state and local_governments would have to start &quot; taxing like crazy &quot; to pay_for improvements . Besides , he pointed_out , &quot; there were a lot of reasons to stay here. &quot; Among those , he said , was that Southern California was a better distribution center for his company . Last fall , the company decided to remain at its Rancho Cucamonga plant , where the rolled-paper division will join it in January . &quot; Maybe the pendulum for business in California is now starting to swing the other way , &quot; Kishen said . If it is , the state might want to amend workers ' compensation laws again . Reforms in the workers ' comp system last year lowered premium rates by 17 % at Martin Molded Rubber in La Habra , and &quot; that ' s a help , &quot; owner Russ Martin said . But it is not enough , he said . If he decides to move_in the future , &quot; workers ' comp will be the reason , &quot; he said . Half of his 20 employees only examine products , yet the company must pay the same workers ' comp rate for them -- $ 16 per $ 100 in wages -- as it does for other employees engaged in actual manufacturing , where the risk of injury is much greater . The company produces gaskets and other rubber products for medical and aerospace products and for household_appliances . Martin is considering creating a second company that would employ the examiners and pay a drastically lower insurance_premium -- 98 cents for every $ 100 in wages . He also is looking_for a bigger plant in Anaheim , where electricity rates are lower . Currently , he spends up_to $ 5 # 000 a month during the summer on electricity , mainly for the heat machines needed to mold rubber . &quot; I looked_at Carson City ( in Nevada ) , and I can save $ 3 # 000 a month just on workers ' comp rates and electricity , &quot; Martin said . &quot; The only thing really stopping me from moving there is the fear of losing growth . I know I ' m going_to grow here. &quot; He hopes to stay in Southern California , at least for five more years , but relocation remains an option . But if any company had reason to leave the state , it would appear to be All Metals Processing , which paints and coats finishes on a variety of metals , from golf_clubs to medical_instruments . Partner George Derby said that after battling with workers ' compensation laws and numerous air quality regulations , the company was hit this year by a special 6 % city tax on utilities that is costing it more_than $ 500 a month just in added electricity costs . But the company ' s woes stem mainly from air quality regulations . The company , for instance , has a permit to use 17 gallons of special paint to coat metals . It had a chance to land a big golf_club contract that would have added six additional employees to its 110-member work_force and $ 40 # 000 a month in revenue . But AQMD bureaucrats refused to allow any expansion of its existing metal painting operations , Derby said . * Instead , air quality officials told him that All Metals could open a new metal processing plant across the street , obtain a permit for that operation and then merge the companies . That , he said , was time-consuming , expensive and unreasonable . Eventually , All Metals could not sign the contract and lost the work . AQMD has also vetoed a number of other plans , Derby said , including a request to reinstall a hazardous-waste treatment machine All Metals wanted to buy from another company . &quot; These are the kinds of things that are making us feel we can ' t survive , &quot; Derby said . &quot; The recession is wasting us away , profit_margins are down , and California wants to beat on you and never let_go . It ' s amazing. &quot; He said he has met often with AQMD officials , agency staff and local politicians , but laws and rules have stymied them . Edison , though , helped the company by providing rebates for cheaper lighting and new heating and air-conditioning components . The savings in electric_bills over the next 1 1 / 2 years will cover the cost of the new equipment , Derby said . The partners had entreaties from 17 states to move their operations out of California . They negotiated with cities in Colorado , Missouri , Nebraska and Texas . &quot; They all said we were clean and complied with federal regulations , &quot; Derby said . &quot; Some were going_to build us a building-to-suit ( for lease ) . One year ' s rent would have been one month ' s here. &quot; But the costs of moving the heavy machinery and disposing_of hazardous chemicals proved to be so prohibitive that the company could not even relocate to Santa Ana , where a specially designated enterprise_zone could have cut the company ' s costs . The company would have had to spend $ 2 million -- or 40 % of its annual revenue -- to move . &quot; If I had a machine_shop , I ' d be out of here , &quot; Derby said . &quot; We have every reason to move and no ability to do it. &quot; Now , he said , he and his partner will likely sell the company to the employees over time through an employee_stock_ownership_plan .</TEXT>
