   <HEADLINE> BY DESIGN ; CLOAK ENCOUNTERS ; PARTY CLOTHES ARE TAKING WRAP FOR VERSATILE COVER-UPS THAT DRAPE DRAMATICALLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Evening wear will be under wraps for the holiday season ' s upcoming round of parties . From sheer , fly-away chiffon shawls to faux mink stoles , wraps of all kinds are among the more versatile ways to top_off party clothes . Unlike a coat , wraps don ' t cover_up an outfit -- they complement it . Their unstructured shapes allow them to adapt to everything from cocktail suits to ball_gowns . Often nothing more_than a rectangular piece of material , wraps can be wound around the body in a myriad styles . They can be flung dramatically over one shoulder or draped simply around the neck so the ends flow down the back . They can tie around the shoulders or hips . &quot; Evening wraps are very important this year . They ' re part of the new glamour , &quot; says Georgette Rubin , creative director and co-owner of Lillie Rubin in South Coast Plaza , Costa Mesa . &quot; They ' re popular because bare dresses are in. &quot; Among Lillie Rubin ' s wraps for the holidays are fluffy marabou stoles in black , white or pastel hues ( $ 190 ) , a black faux beaver cape with a rhinestone clip closure ( $ 185 ) and assorted chiffon scarves . &quot; The chiffon scarves are large and sheer , so you can just layer them over any dress , &quot; Rubin says . &quot; It ' s part of the ( see-through ) lingerie look. &quot; Wraps are not for the fashion timid . Wearing one well requires a bit of fashion daring . &quot; You have to have a sense of style to be able to just fling the wrap around your shoulders , &quot; Rubin says . &quot; You have to throw caution to the wind. &quot; Wraps range_in style from the simple to the dramatic . Some have beaded accents all_over ; some have just a fringed border , and some are a plain swatch of material . A few have only a brushed gold ornament dangling from one of the four corners . &quot; Most are very minimal this season , &quot; says Ramin Hadjipour , manager of Devon Becke in Fashion Island Newport Beach . &quot; Often there will be just a single ornament versus overall glitz. &quot; Among the more understated wraps is Tadashi ' s simple black Lycra shawl with fringe around the edges ( $ 118 ) , available at Devon Becke in Fashion Island and Brea Mall . &quot; The Lycra fabric drapes beautifully , &quot; Hadjipour says . Wrap fabrics run the gamut from lightweight sheer chiffons to the penne velvets and heavier knits used by Tadashi . For dramatic entrances , there ' s A.J. Bari ' s black velvet wrap with a taffeta ruffle around the edges ( $ 190 ) that can adorn the neck like a collar ; a sleeveless black velvet cape by A.J. Bari with a satin hood ( $ 390 ) , and a black velvet shawl with gold tassel fringe by Tadashi ( $ 118 ) , all at Devon Becke . &quot; A wrap is more stylish and practical than a coat . You can still sit_down and have dinner in a wrap , whereas a coat is rather copious , &quot; Hadjipour says . Wraps also allow the wearer more creativity than coats . &quot; You can give a dress a totally different illusion depending_on how you wear your wrap , &quot; Hadjipour says . &quot; You can put the knot on the shoulder or in front , or you can accessorize a wrap with a brooch. &quot; Wraps can change the entire look of an outfit , dressing_up a plain suit or dress so that it can go from day to night . Ames carries elaborately beaded shawl collars that add sparkle to any garment . One comes_in black silk with brushed matte gold beading , while another has jet beads sprinkled on sheer black silk ( about $ 200- $ 250 ) . &quot; They dress_up the plainest of outfits , &quot; says Lainey Presson , manager of Ames in Brea Mall . Other wrap styles at Ames include a black velvet stole ( $ 58 ) , tea-length black velvet cape ( $ 148 ) and a crocheted black shawl with jet beads that seems to envelop the wearer in a sparkling net ( $ 170 ) . &quot; Wraps are good for keeping warm , but some people just wear them for coverage &quot; when they don ' t want to bare too_much skin , Presson says . &quot; The chiffon ones are more decorative . They ' re like a security blanket. &quot; Wraps can be worn day or night . Among the fashion-forward offerings at Mineral and Anastasia in Fashion Island are wraps of brushed cotton , faux fur and cashmere . &quot; Mixing textures is the story this season , &quot; says Ami Gharavi , owner of Mineral and Anastasia . A wrap such_as Amy Chang ' s imitation mink stole ( $ 275 ) can be paired with black leather or lace or the season ' s hot shiny metallics . Other textures include Russell Bennett ' s bolero-style wrap of ultra-soft wool with black feather trim ( $ 469 ) , which makes an excellent cover-up for a lace slip dress , and Myrene de Premonville ' s pure cashmere cape ( $ 589 ) -- a perfect foil to a silver metallic miniskirt and vest . &quot; Wraps are cozier than jackets , &quot; Gharavi says . &quot; They feel better , lighter , and they go_over everything. &quot;</TEXT>
