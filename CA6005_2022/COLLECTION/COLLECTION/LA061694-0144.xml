   <HEADLINE> WARNINGS ON WORKERS ' COMP FLAWS IGNORED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles city officials had repeated warnings for at least five years that the city workers ' compensation system was badly flawed , and even ripe for fraud , but they did little to correct the problems , documents show . By the time serious attempts to reform the system began this year , police say , taxpayers may have been cheated out of as much as $ 1 million by an alleged fraud ring . A task_force reported that the city ' s expenses for injured workers had spiraled out of control , with municipal employees filing injury claims at nearly twice the rate of other government employees and payments per worker averaging $ 2 # 169 , more_than 2 1 / 2 times the national average . The warnings from the task_force -- appointed by Mayor Richard Riordan and City Atty . James K . Hahn -- were far from the first to confront the Workers ' Compensation Division . Auditors from within city government and from the private sector have warned since at least 1989 that the city paid too_much for worker injury cases and that screening to prevent excessive payments to employees , physicians and others was in disarray . The story of the workers ' compensation system ' s imperviousness to change is one of reforms being lost or diluted as they passed_through layers of bureaucracy , of elected officials refusing to make short-term payments for potential long-term gains and of the system ' s resistance to reform . &quot; If they had implemented some of the recommendations , we think it would have prevented much of the fraud that is alleged to have taken_place , &quot; said City Controller Rick Tuttle , whose office audited the workers ' compensation system twice in the last five years . Though others familiar_with the workers ' compensation system agreed that reforms could have saved money , they questioned whether any safeguards can prevent abuse by high-ranking and trusted employees . One such employee is under investigation for allegedly conspiring to defraud the system of about $ 1 million . Thelma Bowman , a principal workers ' compensation analyst who supervised 20 employees , was recently placed on paid administrative leave pending completion of the investigation . * &quot; It ' s certainly exceedingly difficult to prevent ( fraud ) when you have collusion from a high level on the inside , &quot; said Carol Williams , assistant chief of the Workers ' Compensation Division since late 1990 . What is not in_dispute is the need for reform of the city ' s program for paying injured workers . The total cost of the city ' s workers ' compensation claims jumped more_than 2 1 / 2 times over a decade to $ 86.5 million in 1992-93 . With an all-time high of 42 # 000 cases now open , there is the equivalent of nearly one claim for each city employee . About one-third of those are suspected to be files for employees who have returned to work or left city employment , files that should have been closed so that they did not become susceptible to fraudulent billings . As early as a 1989 audit , City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie cited the potential for fraud and recommended hiring a private firm to reduce some of the caseload for workers ' compensation analysts , who have reportedly carried up_to seven times the recommended caseload . Comrie ' s office also said a computer_system should be revamped to ensure the accuracy of payouts and a form created for employees to verify that they had received the treatment that a doctor said they had . The fate of the verification form typifies that of other reform proposals . Comrie ' s report suggested that without such verification of the patients , doctors &quot; may bill against a legitimate claim number for inflated or fraudulent service costs. &quot; In fact , three doctors are being investigated for just such billings . * But the administrators of the Workers ' Compensation Division resisted the change . They reported that they had policies to &quot; provide appropriate control over the bill-paying process. &quot; They also wrote to Comrie that it could be cumbersome and difficult for an overworked staff to process more paperwork . Workers ' compensation managers further cited an opinion from the city attorney ' s office that said employee verification could be requested but that if it was not received doctors would still have to be paid . Assistant City Atty . Thomas Theis wrote at the time that because an employee ' s signature was not specifically required in the state Labor Code , the lack of a signature could not be used to deny payment . Comrie ' s auditors to this day defend the proposal for the verification safeguard , saying it would have drawn attention to doctors who submitted many bills without signatures . But at the time -- faced with the opposition from Workers ' Compensation managers and the city attorney ' s opinion -- Comrie ' s office backed_off on the recommendation . The City_Council tabled the idea . Another recommendation of the Comrie audit , hiring a private firm to reduce the backlog of workers ' compensation cases , also fell by the wayside . Although $ 200 # 000 was set_aside and the City_Council was told the work would begin by early 1991 , the Workers ' Compensation Division let the program languish . Jurutha Brown , former head of the division , and her supervisor , Ray Allen , both said they were waiting for an outside auditor to complete a top-to-bottom review of the workers ' compensation system before beginning attempts to reduce the case backlog . Allen said he was not convinced that such a contract would be the most cost-beneficial and that he also lacked enough staff to draft a proposal to private firms . Tuttle ' s office was the next to make an effort with the Workers ' Compensation Division in a 1990 audit and a review two years later of the division ' s computer_system . In a 1992 report , the firm of Balbin &amp; Co . of Los Angeles detailed 14 weaknesses in the workers ' compensation system and recommended improvements including : improved documentation by analysts when billings and payments differed ; creation of flow_charts so employees could better understand processing of claims , and promulgation of rules that allowed only supervisors to increase the maximum amount that could be paid on an employee ' s claim . But , in a harshly worded response , the Personnel_Department said that about half the recommendations were superfluous and that existing procedures were sufficient . Other changes were being put_in place , the memo promised , but it also accused the auditing firm of a &quot; lack of a full understanding of the system itself and of the complexities of workers ' compensation in general. &quot; Jim Armstrong , auditing director for the controller ' s office , said in an interview this week that Brown obstructed that audit by failing to cooperate with the firm . &quot; It would be kind if I used the word uncooperative to describe her , &quot; Armstrong said . Brown said it was the firm ' s chief auditor who caused conflict by refusing &quot; to understand how our system worked and how the city worked. &quot; She said that , inexplicably , recommendations were made_for improvements that were already in place . By the time the Workers ' Compensation Division made its final response to the audit , Stanley Gronos had replaced Brown . ( Brown had been moved to another post , as part of a routine rotation within the Personnel Department. ) The workers ' compensation management agreed to at least study many of the auditor ' s proposals , to decide whether they could be implemented . Controller ' s office auditors said that they had hoped for more_than the lukewarm response , but that they have limited staffing to enforce audits and were forced to move to other matters . &quot; We are somewhat reliant_on management ' s representations they are going_to take action and make changes , &quot; Armstrong said . The most anticipated review of the department , though , was the study by the Newport Beach-based firm of Warren , McVeigh . The report was conceived in 1989 as the comprehensive review that would draw a new course for administering injured workers ' claims . When a first draft of the report was ready in March , 1992 , it provided a sharp rebuke of the entire Workers ' Compensation Division , calling its performance &quot; well below the industry standard. &quot; The firm also found that city analysts were hopeless about making improvements . Employees shifted blame to others , and few took responsibility to complete a task , the report said . But the observations and nearly 50 recommended reforms were not disseminated for 21 months to the commission that oversees the Personnel_Department . A source familiar_with the report said that division managers Brown and Gronos failed to respond to the audit , leaving it in a draft form that could not be released to the commission and the public . &quot; These things don ' t have to be released until they are finalized , &quot; said the source . &quot; Would you want that report released ? &quot; Brown and Gronos denied that they tried to hold_up the report . Their supervisor , Allen , said the report languished in part because of the shift in command of the worker ' s compensation section from Brown to Gronos . He conceded that the completion of the report &quot; took way too long &quot; and &quot; shouldn ' t have happened. &quot; When it was released in December , it became part of a blueprint for the first substantive changes in the Workers ' Compensation Division . Faye Washington became head of the Personnel_Department in the following months and began to institute many of the recommended changes . A risk manager is expected to be hired within the next few weeks to revamp the entire system for paying injured employees and their doctors . A proposal is expected to go_to the City_Council by the end of the month to hire a firm to reduce the massive case backlog . And the council will also soon be asked to hire a private firm to manage some new cases and to test Mayor Richard Riordan ' s theory that an outside contractor can do the job more efficiently . &quot; Most important , there is an acknowledgment that the system is broke and we do need to fix it , &quot; Washington said . The Warren , McVeigh report also supported the Workers ' Compensation Division management in calling_for a massive increase in staffing , to a total of 40 analysts from 19 . Similar requests have been sent to the mayor and City_Council repeatedly since 1989 , but most have been rebuffed because of the city ' s tight finances . Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , chairman of the council ' s Budget and Finance_Committee , said the managers of the workers ' compensation system never properly emphasized the dire need for more analysts . &quot; Department general_managers know that when you urgently need a hiring freeze exemption , that you should call the mayor , the head of the Budget and Finance_Committee or the head of the Personnel Committee , &quot; Yaroslavsky said . &quot; No such call was made. &quot;</TEXT>
