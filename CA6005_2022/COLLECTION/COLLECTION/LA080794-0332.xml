   <HEADLINE> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS : PROTECTING HOME FROM SUN ' S DAMAGING RAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : The summer sun bakes me through my windows and skylight and fades my furniture . How can I inexpensively block the sun ' s direct heat , yet see clearly outdoors and still get free solar heat in the winter ? ANSWER : Blocking the sun ' s intensity through your windows can lower your air-conditioning costs significantly . In addition to blocking heat and glare , you must block the sun ' s invisible fading rays . These ultraviolet ( UV ) fading rays also slowly break_down the fabrics and cause premature wear . There are several inexpensive do-it-yourself summer-only methods to reduce the intensity of the sun through your windows without obstructing the view . These sun control methods are designed to be easily removed each winter to let free solar heat in through your windows . I use a reusable summer-only self-cling film on several of my own south- and west-facing windows . It is available in lightly tinted gray or bronze , and you can reapply it year after year . It is available in rolls or in do-it-yourself kits that include the film , knife and squeegee for installing it . This window film is made of self-cling vinyl . The vinyl creates a natural static charge that makes_it adhere tightly to your window glass . There is no permanent adhesive . It blocks 55 % of the sun ' s heat and most of the fading rays , yet still provides an undistorted view outdoors . To install it , spray the window with water so the film slides easily . Lay the film against the window , cut it to size and squeegee away the excess water . In the winter , you just pull one corner loose and peel it off . Roll it onto a paper tube or fold it up until next summer . Another option is see-through roll-up interior shades that block heat and stop fading . One type uses a durable tinted Mylar film that blocks 96 % of the UV fading rays . It is mounted on a spring- or pull-chain roller . Sun-control fiberglass screening can also be used for the roll-up shade . It blocks 50 % to 70 % of the sun ' s heat depending_on the weave and color . The most effective new shade is aluminum_foil embedded in tough fabric . It blocks all_the fading rays and much heat , but you cannot see_through it . For a skylight , you can install a removable interior fiberglass screen shade . You attach narrow channels on either end of your skylight . Wrap the screen ends around the rods and snap them into the channels . There are also exterior skylight screen covers that attach with elastic bungie cords . Write to me for Utility Bills Update No . 999 listing manufacturers of reusable self-cling window film ( and a small sample piece to try ) , roll-up film and screen window and skylight shades , prices , specifications and installation instructions . Please include $ 2 and a self-addressed envelope . Does Dripping Faucet Warrant Plumber Cost ? Q : My bathroom faucet drips , and I wondered if the water saved by fixing it is worth the expense of calling the plumber . About how much water does a dripping faucet waste ? A : I opened a bathroom faucet a little in my own home to measure the amount of water wasted . The faucet dripped eight times per minute . Over six hours , it dripped a pint of water . This is equivalent_to 182 gallons per year . You should have the drip fixed . Although the amount of water wasted from your one faucet is not great , the total water wasted from many homes across the country is significant . Also it may be hot water , which wastes energy too . A slow hot water drip feels cold by the time it gets_to the faucet .</TEXT>
