   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; CLASS PUTS THOUGHTS ON FUME SCARE INTO WRITING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cassandra Mattei labeled it &quot; A Horrible Day. &quot; The 9-year-old Lincoln Elementary School student wrote a paragraph in class Tuesday about how it felt to be evacuated the day before during a fume scare that sent more_than 60 pupils to local hospitals . The writing assignment in teacher Anna Ortega ' s fourth-grade class was intended to help students get_back to a normal routine . Cassandra , like many students , found herself trying to spell unfamiliar words to describe an unfamiliar situation . &quot; One day we were working_on math when suddenly our class herd from our speaker ' Please evaporate the building , ' &quot; she wrote . &quot; I was scared because I didn ' t know what was going_on . We went outside to line_up when suddenly fire_trucks were coming_into our school. &quot; Sheriff ' s detectives said they presume the fumes spread through air-conditioning vents from a device -- fireworks , a stink_bomb or something similar -- detonated in the boys ' bathroom . A student turned_in an unexploded firework he said he had found nearby but no fireworks debris or other evidence of an explosion was found . Firefighters said many of the children appeared to be suffering from psychosomatic hysteria , made sick because they were frightened to see other children acting sick . Students taken_to local hospitals , complaining of nausea and burning sensations in their mouths and chests , were released after treatment . Some were given oxygen . Authorities said no lasting effects are expected . Ortega said her students were &quot; a little more talkative and hyperactive &quot; than normal Tuesday , what with the strangers with television_cameras and notebooks still lurking around the school . Nick Blakestad , 9 , was taken_to a hospital complaining of nausea after using a drinking_fountain next to the bathroom . &quot; I didn ' t like being_sick , &quot; he said . Principal Alyce Ellis visited all_of the classrooms Tuesday , talking_about the incident with students and warning that the student or students responsible_for creating the fumes will be expelled from the Lancaster School District . &quot; We can ' t have that kind of behavior at Lincoln , can we , because we spent five years trying to get a good school , &quot; she told Ortega ' s class . Ellis also asked students in Ortega ' s class to share their thoughts about the evacuation . Most of the students ' comments were similar . &quot; I was scared because I thought I would get_it , &quot; said Katie Montana , 9 . Another 9-year-old student said she was &quot; scared because no one would tell me what was going on. &quot; An all-school assembly was planned , but Ellis said she believed that meeting with smaller groups of students would be more productive . &quot; With smaller groups you get more of a feeling for the children ' s feelings , &quot; she said . Lt . Tom Pigott , commander of the detective bureau at the Antelope Valley Sheriff ' s Station , said deputies are looking_for a culprit , but if it was a student prank , &quot; the likelihood we ' re going to prosecute anybody is pretty slim. &quot;</TEXT>
