   <HEADLINE> SENIOR_CITIZENS DECRY POISONING OF RABBITS ; WILDLIFE : LEISURE WORLD PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FIRM DEFENDS PRACTICE , SAYING THE CREATURES ARE DESTRUCTIVE TO LANDSCAPING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 50 senior_citizens protested Wednesday against a property management company ' s practice of poisoning wild rabbits at_Leisure World , which company officials say is necessary to prevent the destruction of flowers and plants . Joined by representatives of two Orange County animal rights groups , the protesters lined a sidewalk in front of the offices of Leisure World Real_Estate and held large signs that condemned the method of killing the rabbits . &quot; They ' ve been disappearing slowly but surely , &quot; said Belle Price , a New York native who retired to Leisure World five years ago . &quot; I moved here from Cement City , and when I saw my first bunny , I thought it was great . Something has to be done . We ' re all_in this together. &quot; California cottontail_rabbits are being blamed by the landscaping company for costly damage to ornamental landscaping in the state ' s largest retirement community . But some residents contend that the severity of the problem doesn ' t square with a scenario given by Professional Community Management Inc. , the firm that provides landscape maintenance for Leisure World . Some residents also fear that other wildlife , such_as hawks , owls , possums and coyotes -- as well as dogs and cats -- could suffer from contact with poison-laced rabbit carcasses or feces . Residents said rodent poison has been used on the rabbits . Scott Weldy , a Lake Forest veterinarian , said that the poison , diphacinone , causes internal bleeding and takes a_few days to kill a rabbit . If ingested by dogs or cats , such poison could be harmful or fatal , he said . &quot; Hopefully , it is being applied in a selective manner , &quot; Weldy said . Jerry Rathje , Professional Community Management Inc. ' s landscape and pest control supervisor , said that the rabbits cause $ 25 # 000 to $ 50 # 000 worth of landscape damage annually in the 750-acre community . Without any population_control , the damage costs would be higher , he said . Rathje said that as of Wednesday , 22 feeding stations containing barley treated with diphacinone were in flower beds or against buildings where residents had complained about rabbits . Rathje could not provide an estimate of the number of rabbits killed , but he said that poison has been used &quot; on and off for as long as anyone can remember. &quot; About 90 % of the baiting was in response to resident requests , Rathje said . Eva Park , founder of Orange County People for Animals , said that the management company could legally poison wild rabbits but that the approach would ultimately damage the ecosystem . &quot; We live_in a natural world . We can ' t expect to live_in a sterilized bubble , &quot; Park said . &quot; They can do anything they want unless there is enough outcry. &quot; But Rathje said that natural predators cannot keep the rabbit population in check . &quot; It doesn ' t work here because it ' s not a natural setting ; it ' s a man-made setting , &quot; Rathje said . Protesters said that other solutions should be sought , such_as altering some of the landscaping or screening certain plants . Leisure World resident Nancy Zeiger said that about 300 residents so far have signed a petition in favor of leaving the rabbits alone . &quot; We will never know the number of rabbits killed , &quot; she said . Zeiger said that half_a_dozen rabbits used to hop around her street but that their number has fallen to two . Babs Escareno , a member of the Canine Club of Leisure World , said that she has heard of instances in which dogs or cats died of mysterious causes , but none of the deaths was linked to rabbit poisoning . Still , she said , she is concerned . &quot; Everyone I know is concerned about this , &quot; Escareno said . &quot; But ( management company representatives ) say , ' Oh , you ' re just a bunch of goofy animal activists , ' so it ' s extremely discouraging. &quot; Price , who wore pink rabbit ears at the protest , said that she would be keeping a tight leash on her two Yorkshire_terriers , one of which has appeared in advertisements in Gentleman ' s Quarterly magazine . &quot; What are they going_to do next ? &quot; Price said . &quot; Kill birds ? &quot; * RETIREMENT COMMUNITY SUED Lawsuit alleges age discrimination by Leisure World in Seal Beach .
