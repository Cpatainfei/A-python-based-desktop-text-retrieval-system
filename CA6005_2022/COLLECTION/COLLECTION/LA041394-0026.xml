   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEWS ; YOUNG VIRTUOSOS TAKE_STAGE AT AMBASSADOR AUDITORIUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Talent takes many guises ; so does musical achievement . The three budding virtuosos who appeared on the Gold Medal series event at Ambassador Auditorium Monday night proved that , again . Pavel Sporcl , born in 1973 in the Czech Republic , showed himself to be a most gifted and accomplished violinist . His demeanor may be modest , but his technique and musicality comprise abundant resources . Pianist George S . Lopez is a native New Yorker raised in Central_America and trained in Connecticut and Paris , among other locales . Swedish pianist Jan Biel , born 1975 , like his colleagues at this performance , is a prizewinner of numerous competitions and a veteran of international tours . These three , traveling under the unwieldy name of Laureates of Holland Music Sessions World Tour 1994 -- the title refers to a summer conservatory all have attended -- gave a demonstration of their present virtuosity in a generous program at the Pasadena showplace . The eclectic agenda contained music by Bach , Mozart , Beethoven , Copland , Saint-Saens and Liszt . Lopez , probably the oldest of the showcased players , certainly showed the greatest maturity and musical perspective , especially in his playing of Copland ' s Piano Variations ( 1930 ) , which emerged compelling in rhetoric and continuity , kaleidoscopic in_color . Sporcl ' s particular moment of glory was the Fourth Solo Sonata of Eugene Ysaye , the mechanical thickets of which he sailed_through without hesitation , all_the while producing a beautiful sound and genuine eloquence . At 19 , Biel has the furthest to go_in overall musical growth . Yet his technical capacity is huge , his speed and control -- especially in flying octaves -- startling . There may even be a poet underneath his cool stage-manner ; at this moment , one would not place any bets_on that , however . DANIEL CARIAGA</TEXT>
