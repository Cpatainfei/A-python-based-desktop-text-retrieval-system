   <HEADLINE> ART ; THE APARTMENT OF ANTIQUITIES ; A COLLECTION OF 200 WORKS FROM THE ANCIENT WORLD MOVES FROM A MANHATTAN COUPLE ' S VERY PRIVATE ENCLAVE TO A RARE PUBLIC VIEWING AT THE GETTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Hi . I ' m Larry Fleischman , &quot; says an energetic man , striding down a hall and shaking my hand as I step_out of an elevator in an elegant high-rise . The high-powered businessman , who gained financial success in television , real_estate and investments before taking_over Kennedy Galleries , one of the world ' s leading American art dealerships , is anything but the intimidating character one might expect . &quot; And I ' m Barbara , &quot; says his effervescent wife , inviting me into the couple ' s apartment , where treasures from ancient Greece , Rome and Etruria compete with stunning views of Manhattan . Bronze and marble statues of Greek gods -- Dionysus , Athena , Apollo and Venus -- stand on pedestals and window ledges . Fragments of ancient frescoes hang_on walls . Painted ceramic vessels sit on shelves , while jewelry , small sculptures and hardware nestle in vitrines . Seen_through a broad sweep of windows , the bustling city resembles a modern tapestry with miniature buildings deliberately organized in geometric patterns . It ' s an astonishing environment , known only to the Fleischmans ' friends and to scholars who make pilgrimages here to see one of the world ' s leading private collections of antiquities . Neither art as decor nor a pretentious showcase , the two-story apartment is a sort of live-in museum that mixes domestic comfort with aesthetic and intellectual stimulation . As befits a couple who treat their art acquisitions as members of the family , the Fleischmans ' collecting is essentially a private love_affair . But it ' s about to go public in &quot; A Passion for Antiquities : Ancient Art From the Collection of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman , &quot; an exhibition of more_than 200 objects opening on Thursday at the J . Paul Getty Museum in Malibu . The show will continue at the Getty through Jan . 15 , then travel_to the Cleveland Museum of Art from Feb . 15 to April 23 . * The upcoming exhibition is the first and -- the Fleischmans say -- only time most of the ancient artworks will be removed from their apartment and put_in the public_eye . Parting_with their treasures for several months may prove to be traumatic , but a_few days before the tedious process of wrapping and crating begins , the Fleischmans are excited about the project . &quot; We trust the Getty , &quot; Barbara says . &quot; They are doing everything in the most professional way. &quot; Going_all_out for the event , the Getty will install the works in about half of its first_floor galleries , which are appropriately housed in a replica of a 1st-Century Roman villa . Getty Trust Publications has issued a fully illustrated color catalogue of the Fleischman collection . In addition , a series of public programs will offer Roman-theme family days , lectures by scholars and Larry Fleischman and performances of ancient_Greek and Roman comedies . The Fleischman celebration recognizes private collectors as a source of inspiration and support for museums , says Getty Museum Director John Walsh . But the exhibition also offers a hint of the future at the Malibu villa . In 1997 , after the Getty ' s collections of European paintings , drawings and sculpture , decorative arts and photographs move to a new museum at the Getty Center in Brentwood , the villa will be converted into a museum and study center for antiquities . Temporary exhibitions will then become a major part of the program . Large private collections of antiquities are extremely rare , but the Fleischmans ' cache is extraordinary , says Marion True , the Getty ' s curator of antiquities . &quot; What distinguishes their collection is both the variety of the pieces -- from a Cycladic head to beautiful late Roman glass -- and their quality . Every single piece is exceptional . . . . I have never seen a collection selected with such sure taste , &quot; she says . The exhibition is designed to celebrate the Fleischmans ' day-to-day relationship to their chosen artworks . The idea is to preserve the intimate character of the relatively small objects and to display them in thematic categories , as at the Fleischmans ' apartment . &quot; Visitors will not only have the chance to view some of the most brilliant works_of_art from ancient Greece and Rome to be seen anywhere , but they will also have the unusual opportunity to experience some of the pleasures and sense of discovery that true collectors enjoy , &quot; True says . One thing exhibition visitors will not witness , however , is Larry ' s penchant for tinkering with the collection ' s arrangement . &quot; He ' s our installation and lighting man , &quot; Barbara says . &quot; If I hear a noise at 5 a.m. , I know it ' s Larry moving things around. &quot; And if all is_quiet at that hour , he is probably reading one of the books in their antiquities library . Sometimes he brings pieces together because of their function , as in a group of metal weights . &quot; Larry became fascinated with weights , &quot; Barbara says of a display of tiny metal objects in the shape of animals . &quot; What makes them so incredible is that they weigh exactly what they are supposed to weigh , but they have been fashioned as something that ' s really quite beautiful and charming . Apparently there ' s always the yearning to make something functional look nice and interesting and pretty. &quot; Leading a tour through the apartment , Barbara points_out themes and connections . One display_case holds athletic figures , while theatrical scenes and characters -- a favorite subject of the Fleischmans -- turn_up in several displays of terra-cotta vases , bronze pots and masks . As we progress from room to room , she compares different artists ' interpretations of Greek gods and points_out details of particularly fine workmanship . But what pleases her most is the timelessness of the art ' s human qualities . &quot; The thing that ' s so extraordinary is that these objects make_it very obvious that life hasn ' t changed much , &quot; Barbara says . &quot; Family life , daily activities , the quest_for intellectual stimulation , all kinds of concerns that you see in these objects are the same today as they were when these pieces were made . We have Saran_Wrap , but life really has not changed. &quot; Pointing_out a Roman bronze statue of a chubby toddler , she says : &quot; Here ' s a little boy , a baby Dionysus from the period before the eruption at Vesuvius . And look how beautifully observed he is . He ' s just a chunky little Italian boy. &quot; Further on , Barbara confides her affinity with an Etruscan sprite clad only in shoes and jewelry -- her own favorite accouterments . Nodding at his wife ' s remarks , and chiming_in with occasional comments , Larry offers a small Hellenistic bronze likeness of an old_woman . &quot; This is a special old_lady , &quot; he says . &quot; Scholars are debating who she is . One thinks she ' s an old madam . One thinks an old prophetess . Another thinks she ' s a spinner of wool. &quot; The varied array of artworks raises questions about how the Fleischmans decide to add_to their collection . &quot; The first thing is , visually we have to like it , &quot; Larry says of potential acquisitions . Barbara agrees : &quot; The objects have to grab us . This is more_than an intellectual pursuit. &quot; And it is something they do together . &quot; We don ' t have his and hers pieces , &quot; she says . &quot; If one of us really disliked something we would n ' t buy_it , but we rarely disagree . I think that after 46 years of marriage we have sort of merged. &quot; The collection is so extensive that it may appear to be a marriage-long project , but most of the works have been assembled during the last 14 years . What ' s more , it is not their first extraordinary collection . Indeed , the Fleischmans are so closely identified with a completely different genre -- American art -- that they might be expected to live with paintings by members of the Peale family or John Singleton Copley , Winslow Homer , Albert Pinkham Ryder , Charles Burchfield and John Marin . They did , during a former life in Detroit . Larry founded the Archives of American Art in 1954 , lectured on American art for the U.S. Information Agency in the 1960s and from 1962 to 1966 served as president of the Detroit Institute of Arts . Larry began to turn his passion into a profession in 1966 , when he became a partner in Kennedy Galleries , a New York-based American art dealership . The Fleischmans moved to New York about 14 years ago , and he is now owner and chief operating officer of the firm , which recently moved its operation from 57th Street to 5th Avenue . What happened to the couple ' s American art ? &quot; We divested ourselves of the collection to avoid competing with our clients at Kennedy Galleries , &quot; Larry says . But once a collector , always a collector . Deprived of their American paintings , the Fleischmans turned their attention to classical antiquities , a field that had long intrigued them . Having bought a_few pieces of ancient art through the years -- beginning in 1951 with a Roman bronze lamp -- they began to pursue antiquities in_earnest . Piece by piece , marble statuary , bronze vessels and sculpture , terra-cotta vases , fresco panels and gold and silver jewelry found their way to the Fleischmans ' apartment . Book by book , so did an extensive library . Before long , word about the collection was out_in scholarly circles . With this exhibition , the public will get the message too . * &quot; A Passion for Antiquities : Ancient Art From the Collection of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman , &quot; J .
