   <HEADLINE> WITHOUT VISION , PEOPLE PERISH ; MANKIND ' S MANIFEST_DESTINY IN SPACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Crackling by radio across a quarter of a_million miles of space came the electrifying message : &quot; The Eagle has landed. &quot; With that , two Americans stepped_out onto the crusty arid surface of the moon , bringing an exhilarating climax to a quest that was as much an adventure of the human spirit as a technological feat . The Apollo 11 mission seemed like the discovery of another New World , a world of exploration of outer space and inner planets . Today marks the 25th anniversary of that warm summer day on Earth when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin pranced through frigid lunar dust . But for those who expected a dawning of a new space_age , there is little to celebrate . The original heady talk_of bases on the moon , huge manned space_stations orbiting earth with 100 inhabitants and human exploration of Mars has proved nothing more_than talk . No human has visited the moon since 1972 . Ironies abound . Twenty-five years after men strode on the moon , Daniel S . Goldin , administrator of NASA , recently told Congress : &quot; The Congress of the United States and the President have to decide whether we want a space program. &quot; NASA ' s budget is shrinking and space-science projects are struggling to survive with scaled-back cheap missions . The deepest irony of all is that NASA is collaborating with scientists and engineers from the former Soviet_Union -- whose Cold_War threat was the motivation for the moon landing -- in new projects to monitor Earth ' s vital signs , to plan for joint Martian exploration and to loft an international manned space_station that is intended to serve as a forward window into outer space to test future space-faring possibilities . Partly this has to do with keeping the Russian experts out of mischief , partly with keeping American space workers employed . The potential scientific rewards are uncertain . But we must look beyond this horizon . It took a century after Columbus landed for Europeans to start large-scale colonization of the Americas . We are in a pause , distracted by earthly problems that are all too apparent here in Southern California . Yet we are inherently adventuresome and curious creatures , fascinated with the awesome powers and mystery of the universe . Witness the public interest this week in the spectacular explosions on the planet Jupiter caused by collisions with a comet . Perhaps the ultimate mystery of all is the possibility that we are not alone in this universe , that life exists in other solar_systems . That possibility is both exciting and frightening . A fundamental biological reality is that life spreads as far as it can . That is perhaps our manifest_destiny in space . And it is what keeps us looking skyward .</TEXT>
