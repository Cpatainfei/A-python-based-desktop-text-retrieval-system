   <TEXT> Here ' s an inexpensive way to find_out about more_than 400 cheap places to sleep_in the United States and Canada : The Hostel Handbook is a 23-page booklet listing hostels that offer lodging for travelers , often in dormitory_rooms , for $ 5- $ 22 per night . In areas where no suitable hostels exist , the booklet includes locations of inexpensive motels . The booklet was created by the staff of New York City ' s Sugar Hill International House Hostel to act_as a companion to any guidebook . It doesn ' t include detailed information on the facilities -- just addresses , telephone_numbers , nightly rates and affiliations . This book ' s advantage , editor Jim Williams points_out , is that it can be much more up-to-date than major guidebooks , which are often researched a year before most travelers use them . The Hostel Handbook can include information that has been gathered only days before printing . The first edition was published in May . An updated pre-1994 edition is now available , and the revised 1994 edition will be released at the end of March . The Hostel Handbook does not include any type of rating scale . Williams , for one , believes that what ' s right for one traveler isn ' t necessarily right for another . &quot; One traveler might complain because there is too_much of a party atmosphere at a particular hostel , while another traveler might be happy with the arrangement , &quot; he said . The handbook identifies a variety of organizations that offer budget accommodations -- some independent , some affiliated with national or international companies , including : * American Youth_Hostels ( AYH ) . Some AYH facilities have curfews and restrictive check-in hours . Non-members of Hostelling International are usually charged $ 3 extra per night . There is no age limit for guests . * American Assn . of Independent Hostels ( AAIH ) . A network of independent hostels that sometimes requires guests to provide a passport or student identification of some kind . * Backpackers Hostels Canada ( BHC ) . A network of independent hostels in Canada . * Canadian Hostelling Assn . ( CHA ) . The first edition of this handbook listed all CHA hostels in Canada . Future editions will list only hostels in CHA regions that request inclusion in the handbook . The Hostel Handbook also includes hostels unaffiliated with Hostelling International and ( for areas where no hostels exist ) Motel 6s . Motel 6 prices vary by location ; a typical charge is $ 24.95 for one person , $ 6 more for another adult . With independent hostels , there are no guarantees . I ' ve visited some excellent independent hostels , friendly and clean ; but not all are operated like that , so it ' s wise_to ask around . The major disadvantage of independent hostels is that they don ' t belong_to an organization requiring them to maintain certain standards . Before you settle in , have a good look . Make_sure that there are adequate fire exits , and that they are not blocked . If you don ' t feel safe , move_on . Copies of the Hostel Handbook are available for $ 2 from the Sugar Hill International House Hostel , 722 St . Nicholas Ave. , New York 10031 .</TEXT>
