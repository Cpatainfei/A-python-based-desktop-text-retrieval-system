   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; SAUDI_ARABIA ' S EXILES CHALLENGE A CLOSED SOCIETY ; THE DISSIDENTS WANT THE KINGDOM TO BE MORE DEMOCRATIC AND MORE ISLAMIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The latest and perhaps most dangerous challenge to the House of Saud is a portable telephone that Mohammed al Massari carries in his pocket around the fashionable hotel lobbies , restaurants and offices of London . It rings every 10 minutes or so , and it ' s always a caller from somewhere in Saudi_Arabia -- dialing through a New York exchange so the call can ' t be traced -- with tidbits of damaging gossip about the royal_family , a report on the arrest of an opponent of the Saudi regime or simply a word of encouragement . &quot; Thank_you for what you ' re doing , &quot; said one caller from Riyadh on a recent afternoon . &quot; We all support you. &quot; Al Massari works for the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights , whose office in London is a virtual guerrilla warfare center , a network of computers , files and fax machines that transmit reams of sedition into the remote desert kingdom , one of the most closed societies on Earth . The London operatives say 300 faxes a month go_to Saudi government_offices ( the military was recently ordered to keep fax machines turned_off unless a specific document was expected ) , and 300 more go_to various merchants , intellectuals , businessmen and clerics who in turn copy them and re-fax them , in numbers totaling more_than 100 # 000 , throughout the kingdom ; the committee claims , with great delight , to have recently acquired the number to the fax machine in the bedroom of Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz , brother of King Fahd . In recent weeks , Prince Sultan might have awakened to find these bits of propaganda at his bedside : that Saudi_Arabia was secretly supplying the southern Yemenis with tanks and other military assistance in neighboring Yemen ' s civil_war ; that the number of pilgrims who died in an accident during the recent hajj pilgrimage was 10 times more_than the government reported , or more_than 2 # 200 ; that King Fahd and his brothers had in April received salary payments of 100 million Saudi riyals , about $ 27 million . To the worry of both the Saudi monarchy and many Western governments , this particular opposition organization is an Islamic group bent_on making the rigorously Islamic nation even more fundamentalist . Yet its calls_for democratization and an end to corruption have attracted the interest of Saudi liberals pushing for greater freedom and public participation in government . Nor are the committee ' s activities the only sign that not all is_well in the kingdom , one of America ' s most important allies in the Arab world and its major partner in staging Operation_Desert_Storm , the 1991 war that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait . In recent weeks , two Saudi diplomats have gone_into hiding in the United States , one from the Saudi consulate in Houston , the other posted to the Saudi mission at the United Nations in New York . Both are seeking political asylum and claiming harassment by the Saudi government . &quot; I join my voice to the increasing number of moderate academics from our great nation who are no longer able to tolerate the breaches of basic human_rights , including the right to freedom of expression and political association , by the present regime in the kingdom of Saudi_Arabia , &quot; said Ahmed al Zahrany , second secretary at the consulate in Houston , in an announcement in late June . Mohammed al Khilewi , the U.N. envoy , in a letter to Saudi_Arabia ' s senior cleric , Sheik Abdulaziz ibn Baz , began his announcement of opposition with a quotation from a Koranic verse that has been frequently circulated in underground cassette_tapes in Saudi_Arabia , to the fury of the royal regime : &quot; Kings , when they enter a country , despoil it , and make the noblest of its people its meanest ; thus do they behave. &quot; Khilewi said that within hours of sending the letter he received a phone_call from the Saudi ambassador in Washington , Prince Bandar ibn Sultan , offering to send his private jet to take him to Washington , where they would discuss the issue in a private suite at the Watergate Hotel . &quot; Based upon my experience , I understood this to be an attempt to kidnap me and return me to Saudi_Arabia for the treatment accorded to vocal opponents of the regime , &quot; Khilewi said in a statement to the press after he went_into hiding . Opposition to the House of Saud has simmered off and on for years , especially in the hot desert north of Riyadh where Saudi_Arabia ' s most radical clerics hold_sway . But in the years since the end of the Persian_Gulf_War , opposition to the regime has reached unprecedented levels , mostly invisible because so few Western observers are granted visas to visit the kingdom , a number of Saudi analysts say . &quot; I think the U.S._government is mistaken to underestimate the degree of support for the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights and the extent of opposition in Saudi_Arabia . There has been a sea change just in the past year , &quot; said Aziz abu Hamad , a Saudi who studies human_rights issues in the kingdom for Human_Rights Watch , a U.S.-based organization . &quot; I have talked to many people in Saudi_Arabia , and I am convinced there are many people in Saudi who support more radical means to achieve the Islamist goals , &quot; Hamad said . &quot; Some of them discuss the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights as too optimistic about the possibility of change without violence. &quot; At first glance , the idea of militant fundamentalists in a country whose Islamic practices are already the most rigorous in the world is a bit confusing . The Saud family ' s power comes_by way of a historic alliance with the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect of Islam . But the new_wave of Islamists in Saudi_Arabia , joined by more militant Islamic voices in neighboring Egypt , Jordan and Algeria , claim Saudi_Arabia is practicing a false brand of Islam . Islamic critics are happy enough that the Saudi_Arabian monarchy requires the veiling of women , bans alcohol and intermingling of the sexes and prohibits women from driving . But they are critical of Saudi economic_policies that allow interest on banking ( considered usury by the Koran , Islam ' s holy book ) , too heavy a dependence on the West in foreign , defense and economic_policy and a legal_system that is not fully based on the Islamic Sharia law . Like more liberal critics of the regime , they are demanding an end to inefficiency and corruption in the government administration and to the continuing favoritism toward members of the royal_family . Saad al Faqih , London office director of the committee , complained that the Saudi government has attempted to lump the whole opposition movement with fanatics . &quot; They try to confuse the fundamentalists and the new educated Islamists . I will not accept to be labeled as backward and without culture , &quot; said Faqih , a medical professor and surgeon . &quot; The truth is they have a lot which does not fit_in with Islamic teachings , especially things that have to do with the relationship between power and the people . . . . I believe we have achieved our aim of telling the people that Islam does not justify a political dictatorship. &quot; The Saudi regime reacted with immediate alarm when the committee was formed inside the kingdom in May , 1993 -- with some cause . For instance , one member of the new committee , subsequently suspended , was a sheik who advocated killing the country ' s Shiite Muslims . ( The majority of Saudis , and the ruling family , are Sunni Muslims. ) The London-based Massari , now the group ' s official spokesman and son of a senior cleric in Saudi_Arabia , says he was awakened at 2:30 one morning when his front_door was broken_down by a group of police_officers . The officers rushed up_to the bedroom with pistols drawn and took him away handcuffed and blindfolded . Nearly every day during the next six months , Massari says , he was beaten with a bamboo cane on the back and feet . Officers would spit in his face , pull on his beard and call him a &quot; criminal insect. &quot; Massari , then a professor of theoretical physics at Riyadh ' s King Saud University , was later joined in prison by 12 other professors . Six members of the group lost their government jobs , and the detainees were released from prison only after signing statements promising to undertake no other campaigns against the government . That is when they began quietly plotting to leave the country , Massari said . Shortly thereafter , the committee announced it had opened_shop in London . Nearly a dozen of Massari ' s relatives and associates in the kingdom , including his 19-year-old son , have since been arrested . Faqih ' s wife has been forbidden to travel outside the country . Opposition leaders claim the United States stays largely silent about human_rights issues in Saudi_Arabia because it fears encouraging Islamic fundamentalism and because Saudi_Arabia has become an increasingly important trading partner . Ray Mabus , the former Mississippi governor recently confirmed as ambassador to Riyadh , said contracts worth more_than $ 10 billion have been announced in the past few months between U.S. companies and Saudi_Arabia . &quot; These contracts are going_to have an enormous impact on our economy and will create or save thousands of American jobs , &quot; Mabus said . Sen . Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) raised the issue during Mabus ' confirmation_hearing . &quot; We will make a huge go-round about Kashmir and India , and Tian An Men Square and China , and pay no heed whatsoever to what is surely the most autocratic regime on Earth , &quot; Moynihan complained . The Saudis have been largely officially silent on the issue , though Prince Bandar , the ambassador to Washington , in a recent newspaper commentary cautioned the West against intervening in issues it perhaps cannot understand . &quot; We come from an almost timeless culture and firmly hold to our religious faith . Islam for us is not just a religion but a way_of_life , &quot; he wrote . &quot; We Saudis want to modernize , but not necessarily Westernize . . . . It does not help King Fahd , for example , to look good in the Washington Post . . . but not to work within the overwhelming consensus in downtown Riyadh and the rest of Saudi_Arabia , &quot; Bandar wrote . &quot; What Western human_rights or other politically correct groups here may want doesn ' t help King Fahd at all when the Saudi people have a strong differing view of_their_own , based on Islam and other basic ways , &quot; he added . &quot; We don ' t have to like all America does , and it doesn ' t have to like all that we do. &quot;</TEXT>
