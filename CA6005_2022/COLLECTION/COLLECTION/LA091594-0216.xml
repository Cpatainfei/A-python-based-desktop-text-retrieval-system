   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : BASEBALL ' 94 : GOING , GOING . . . GONE ; THE GAME TAKES A CLASSIC FALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whereas , the 28 Major_League Baseball_Clubs have really mucked this thing up ; and Whereas , the Major_League Baseball_Players Assn . made demands that insisted upon &quot; More , &quot; &quot; Much More , &quot; and &quot; Lots More ; &quot; and Whereas , neither side has the integrity of a gnat . Now , therefore , be it resolved that : In order to pulverize the integrity of this Game , this Season , this Business , this Pastime , this Farce , this Travesty , this Mockery , this Sham , this Mockery of a Travesty of a Sham , the owners and players have agreed to sell the American public down the river without a paddle and flush the World_Series and everything else down the old commode , hear ye , hear ye . Signed , Baseball Murder , Inc. ( And P.S. : Be sure to come_to our big Going Out of Business Memorabilia Sale from the 23rd through the 25th ! Bargains ! Bargains ! Bargains ! ) * No , Virginia , there is no baseball . Thank_you for your letter , little_girl . I am so sorry that you will not get_to see your favorite team again this year . Please come_back when you ' re older . How did this happen ? How did everybody get so knuckleheaded that an entire baseball_season had to be scrapped ? What went so wrong that the World has to do without a Series for the first time since men started automobiles with a crank ? Virginia , I wish I knew . All I know is that the players called_for an intentional walk . All I know is that the owners called_for the squeeze . All I know is that they both struck_out . What did the players want ? They wanted to increase the minimum salary from $ 109 # 000 to between $ 175 # 000 and $ 200 # 000 . They wanted alterations in arbitration and free_agency . They wanted home teams sharing 25 % of ticket money with visiting teams . They wanted to make as much as they could make . What did the owners want ? They wanted to divvy_up revenue , 50-50 . They wanted arbitration terminated . They wanted to match any offer to keep any player who had been with them for fewer than six years . And they wanted to make as much as they could make . What killed baseball , Virginia ? Money , honey . Fools and their ballclubs are soon parted . The workers walked_out and the bosses said , &quot; Stay out. &quot; The union spokesman and the management spokesman fiddled while baseball burned . The commissioner did nothing because there is no commissioner . The President of the United States did nothing because his job is to protect and preserve the public welfare , not the public recreation . And so , on Sept . 14 , 1994 , a day that will live_in idiocy , baseball dropped_dead . It was hara-kiri . Self-inflicted . Black armbands for everybody . Signs_on every doorknob : CLOSED TILL FURTHER NOTICE One , two , three strikes , they ' re out . Going , going , gone . The Dodgers finished first . Congratulations . Tony Gwynn hit . 394 , the highest batting_average since 1941 . Congratulations . Matt Williams won the major_league home_run title with 43 . Way to go . Greg Maddux ' s earned-run average , a sweet 1.56. Hell of a season , kid . Buff that big Cy Young trophy until it gleams . Save those ticket_stubs , Virginia , because you never know , you might never see a baseball_game again . Maybe somebody will create a new league . Maybe next spring you can see Barry Bonds and the Sacramento Gold Sox versus Ken Griffey Jr . and the Tacoma Tyrannosaurus . Maybe the union organizers can call_up Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey and the heirs of Sam Walton and some more of America ' s Richest People and organize their own league , with no rules and no obligations , $ 1 # 000 for a single , $ 2 # 000 for a double , $ 5 # 000 for a triple and $ 10 # 000 for a homer , sign right here on the bottom_line . The owners called the players ' bluff , Virginia . Never , never , never , never , never , never , never did the players truly believe that the owners would close the cookie_jar on their fingers this way . Oh , the jokes they made about going_out to the golf_course and having a wonderful time washing the doggy with the kids . In their hearts , they believed every owner would crumble like a mummy in a wind storm . Give_up . Go limp . Chicken_out . Some of them nearly did . That owner from Colorado wavered and quavered for a while . Poor fellow , packin ' ' em in 70 # 000 at a pop , raking_in the dough with a sophomore-year team . Rocky in more ways than one , that guy . And , when the formal resolution came_down from the mount Wednesday , with all_of its whereases and therefores and valedictory jabberwocky , a_couple_of signatures remained missing , one from the owner of the Baltimore_Orioles , who might have been too sorrowful for words , and one from the owner of the Cincinnati Reds , who probably had stepped_out for a smoke . The season of ' 94 was dead as a cow turned_into a fielder ' s mitt . And nothing , not a stay_of_execution and not a writ_of_habeas_corpus , could bring it back . 1984 gave us a Detroit gang that won 35 of its first 40 . 1974 gave us some scraggly , scrappy Oakland A ' s . 1964 was worth a whole David Halberstam book . 1954 was Willie Mays vs . the Indians . 1944 put St . Louis against St . Louis . 1934 , Van Lingle Mungo lost the All-Star game . 1924 , the Washington Senators won it all . 1914 , Boston ( not the Red Sox ) swept the Series . 1904 , there was no Series . We thought such a thing could never happen again , Virginia . Baseball was enduring and permanent , perpetual motion and perpetual emotion . Carpetbaggers and money-grubbers had been around forever -- crooks and tinhorns even rigged a bogus World_Series once -- but always was it played . Never in 90 years was it dangled in front of us like a purse on a string , then yanked away , leaving us feeling_like chumps . The World_Series is just like the World Cup , a scoreless tie . Maybe they could stick the names of all_the first-place teams into a hat and pick_out a winner . It beats penalty kicks . Read elsewhere , Virginia , for actual results of actual games . Baseball doesn ' t belong on the sports pages now , but on the obit pages . Be sure to tell your children and grandchildren someday that when you were young , you were there on the day greed and avarice corrupted the sport you so loved . Kiss this one goodby , kid . Baseball has gone foul . BASEBALL STRIKE : DEVELOPMENTS FROM DAY 34 * Games lost : 14 . * Total games lost : 434 . * Games remaining : 235 . * Total income lost by players : $ 150.2 million . * Estimated revenue lost by owners : $ 289 million . * Estimated loss by owners through World_Series : $ 580 million . * Total lost by players through end of season : $ 230 million . * Key development : Acting commissioner Bud Selig canceled the remainder of the season , including the World_Series . * Quote : &quot; I guess I can put my glove away now. &quot; Ken Ryan , Boston relief_pitcher * AN EARLY END : After a 34-day strike , owners cancel the rest of the 1994 season . The World_Series will not be played for the first time since 1904 . A1 * BUD SELIG : Baseball ' s unlikely leader is also its goat .
