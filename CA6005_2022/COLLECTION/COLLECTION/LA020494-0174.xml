   <HEADLINE> U.S. LOWERS VOLUME IN GATT FILM DISPUTE ; TRADE : ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT IS SEEKING A ' QUIETER DIALOGUE ' IN ITS EFFORTS TO ADD HOLLYWOOD TO THE INTERNATIONAL ACCORD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a significant tactical shift , the Clinton_Administration has decided to take a lower-key approach to try to resolve a transatlantic dispute that left the multibillion-dollar movie_industry out of the recent world trade agreement . Joan Spero , undersecretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs , told reporters that the Administration is searching for what she termed a &quot; somewhat quieter dialogue &quot; on the dispute . &quot; This is a critical trade issue for us , ( but ) at_the_same_time , we ' d like to find a way to have a somewhat quieter dialogue with the Europeans , &quot; she said . &quot; It doesn ' t mean the problem has gone_away ; it doesn ' t mean that we don ' t care . . . but we ' d like to see what we can accomplish in a slightly lower tone_of_voice -- on both sides. &quot; Spero ' s remarks followed meetings with European officials here and in Paris on a broad spectrum of trade issues . Strenuous opposition from the 12-nation European Union -- opposition led primarily by France -- prevented the entire audiovisual sector from being included in the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade reached Dec . 15 , which is expected to remove an array of export barriers when it takes_effect in 1995 . In her remarks , Spero indicated that European officials have also been receptive to the idea of searching for new avenues for talks , including industry-to-industry contacts , instead of only government-level discussions . She said there has been &quot; some resonance both here and in France &quot; for the idea . In a telephone_interview , Jack Valenti , president of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America Inc. , said he fully supports the new Administration approach , saying , &quot; I am willing to talk to anybody anytime on the subject. &quot; * An Administration official stressed that no details were discussed in the most recent meetings . The official described the contacts as &quot; a first talk &quot; since the Dec . 15 accord . &quot; I think there is receptivity to a dialogue , but ( there were ) absolutely no specifics , &quot; the official said . Fearful that free_trade in films and other media could unleash a tidal_wave of U.S. imports that would erode its culture and severely weaken its own film_industry , France has insisted that the EU be allowed to continue its policy , which sets a quota of 49 % for the maximum amount of non-European productions aired on television . Europeans also want to retain film subsidies that in 1992 totaled about $ 700 million and restrict non-European access to emerging technologies that are likely to be areas of major growth in the future . To save the entire trade round from collapse in the final hours before the deadline to reach an accord , the United States and EU agreed to disagree on the issue . But the Administration has continued to pursue some form of agreement to allow the audiovisual sector to be included in the final accord . The effort is important because the film_industry is one of the United States ' major exporters . According to MPAA figures , films , television series and home videos produced in the United States generated $ 8 billion in revenue from international markets in 1992 . While Americans tend to view the European attempts to limit U.S. film imports as a form of censorship , the_French see Hollywood ' s motion_picture muscle as a potential threat to their identity and culture . Those viewpoints have added a powerful emotional dimension to the dispute . Tempers flared again earlier this week when Valenti , in an open_letter , criticized French film executive Daniel Toscan du Plantier for stating that the Los Angeles earthquake was proof that God was_on France ' s side in the film trade dispute . Du Plantier , president of Unifrance Films , later apologized for the remark , which he said had been a &quot; bad private joke told among friends. &quot;</TEXT>
