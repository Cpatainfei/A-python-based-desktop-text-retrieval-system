   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : BURBANK ; CITY ' S CRIME_RATE EXCEEDS GLENDALE ' S</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time in years , Burbank had a higher crime_rate than neighboring Glendale , according to figures released this week for 1993 . The per capita crime_rate in Burbank was 48 crimes per 1 # 000 residents compared with 44 crimes per 1 # 000 residents in Glendale . But Glendale has a larger population , so the number of total crimes committed in Glendale was higher than in Burbank . Altogether , 8 # 215 crimes were committed in Glendale last year , compared with 4 # 706 in Burbank . In 1992 , 8 # 282 crimes were committed in Glendale , and 4 # 648 crimes were committed in Burbank . The crime_rate statistics are compiled from the FBI Crime Index , which counts seven different crimes : murder ; rape ; robbery ; aggravated assault ; burglary ; theft ; and auto theft . The index does not give more weight to more serious or violent crimes , so a shoplifting has the same impact on the statistics as a murder . In Burbank , serious , violent crimes declined in 1993 while theft was the only category that increased , said Burbank Police Capt . Gordon Bowers . Murders dropped from seven in 1992 to five in 1993 . Rapes dropped from 22 in 1992 to 16 in 1993 . Robberies declined from 226 to 209 . Aggravated assaults dropped from 312 to 263 . Burglaries dropped from 764 to 665 , and auto thefts were down from 764 in 1992 to 665 in 1993 . Only the number of thefts in Burbank increased , from 2 # 261 in 1992 to 2 # 556 last year , Bowers said . That may be because of an increase in retail_stores in Burbank , he said . The total number of crimes in 1993 increased by 58 crimes , or 1 % , Bowers said . Burbank police are looking_at special programs such_as the downtown summer bicycle patrols and other ways of giving special attention in the community to fight crime , Bowers said . In addition to Glendale , Burbank also compared its crime figures with Torrance , Pasadena , Inglewood , Los Angeles and Santa Monica . A six-year average of crime_rates from 1988 to the present showed Burbank with the lowest rate , with 45.22 crimes per 1 # 000 residents . The other cities ' crime_rate average over the six years ranged from 49 per 1 # 000 in Glendale to 110 per 1 # 000 in Santa Monica . The crime_rate in Los Angeles during the past six years averaged 92 per 1 # 000 residents . ED BOND</TEXT>
