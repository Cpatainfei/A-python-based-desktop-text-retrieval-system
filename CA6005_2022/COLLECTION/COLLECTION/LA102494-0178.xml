   <HEADLINE> ABUSE OF CONSCRIPTS HELPS TO GIVE DRAFT A BAD NAME IN LATIN_AMERICA ; MILITARY : SUICIDES AND BEATINGS HAVE PROMPTED EFFORTS TO DOCUMENT INCIDENTS AND APPRISE SOLDIERS OF THEIR RIGHTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Draftee Cristian Uribe was a day overdue at his regiment after a September furlough . Other soldiers found him and brought him in . His superiors tied his arms and sent him through a gantlet of recruits under orders to beat him . Uribe was hospitalized with serious injuries . In an Argentine artillery battalion , conscript Omar Carrasco asked_for a chair at a meal one day in March . A sergeant , considering the request out of line , beat_up Carrasco . A lieutenant beat him again the next day for not doing guard_duty . Carrasco died of his injuries . His body was hidden for a month before his parents learned what had happened to him . Leonardo Castro , shy and overweight , cried when drafted into the Colombian army at age 17 . A lieutenant taunted him and beat him . After being forced in March to do extra exercises when he forgot to polish his boots and put_on his name_tag , Castro committed suicide . These and many other incidents of abuse of conscripts have made headlines in Latin_America , helping to give the draft a bad name . While such abuse persists worldwide , it has grown controversial in this region because of declining military influence , a more aggressive press and a heightened awareness of human_rights . Uribe ' s beating in the northern Chilean city of Iquique stirred a storm in Santiago , the capital . A lieutenant and a sergeant have been charged in military_court in the case , the latest of many that have triggered protests by Chilean human_rights groups . &quot; Conscripts are continually pressured and humiliated , &quot; said a statement by the church-oriented group Service , Peace and Justice in Chile . &quot; Their own companions are ordered to beat them. &quot; The Latin_American Faculty of Social_Sciences , one of Chile ' s most influential research institutes , has proposed that a commission be created to investigate complaints of mistreatment of Chilean conscripts . Jose Sabat , president of the Youth Rights Commission in Chile , said his group hopes to distribute leaflets outside barracks advising conscripts of their rights and asking them to report abuses . He said the commission has discussed the idea with Defense Ministry officials and &quot; I think they are going_to accept it. &quot; Although the commission is not well-known among draftees , it has received 77 complaints about conscript abuse in the past two years . Sabat said beatings , psychological harassment and other mistreatment are common in the army but rarely reported by conscripts fearing reprisals . So far this year , he said , three Chilean draftees are known to have committed suicide . In Colombia , 71 suicides occurred in the armed forces last year , according to an internal military investigation cited by the press . Psychologists said reasons for the suicides ranged from loneliness to verbal threats and punishments by superiors . Draftee Castro , who killed himself in March , had hoped to study mechanical_engineering at a Bogota university instead of going_into the army . He was the top student in his Cali high_school . With only three months to go before his release from a year ' s tour in the Presidential Guard , he shot himself in the head in his barracks . Colombian judicial authorities are investigating scores of cases of suicide , homicide , injury and verbal abuse in the military . Some complain that officers beat soldiers in the testicles and pummel them with rifles . Soldiers speak openly of the &quot; water bath , &quot; a beating on the buttocks with a sandal dipped in boiling water . The Colombian Defense Ministry created an office of human_rights for the armed forces this year ; soldiers can now present complaints freely and anonymously with the possibility of seeing disciplinary or criminal sanctions meted_out . In Argentina , meanwhile , a lieutenant , a sergeant and a private have been charged with the beating death of draftee Carrasco . Times special correspondent Steven Ambrus in Bogota , Colombia , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
