   <HEADLINE> SENATOR DEFENDS SPEECH BEFORE ALLEGED WHITE_SUPREMACISTS ; POLITICS : DON ROGERS SAYS BAKERSFIELD GATHERING IS FOR ' PATRIOTIC AMERICANS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State Sen . Don Rogers , under_fire for his plans to address an organization accused of white_supremacist beliefs , dismissed the criticism Wednesday , saying that as far as he is concerned the group consists_of &quot; patriotic Americans. &quot; The Republican from Tehachapi , who consistently ranks among the state Senate ' s most conservative members , says he accepted an invitation to speak at a dinner Saturday night during the fourth annual Jubilation Celebration and Conference in Bakersfield . Joining him in the lineup of speakers is Louis Beam Jr. , a former Ku Klux Klan member from Texas and an Aryan Nations organizer who is also a staff writer for the California-based Jubilee newspaper , which is sponsoring the weekend event . Rogers says he does not share the views of white_supremacists and plans to speak only on a Senate resolution he authored to reaffirm state and individual rights . &quot; My impression of the Jubilee people is that they are a group of patriotic Americans who are working to preserve and restore individual rights and freedoms , &quot; Rogers said , adding that he knows_nothing about charges that the group promotes racism . According to the Oregon-based watchdog group Coalition for Human Dignity , the Jubilee is the leading national publication of the Christian Identity movement . Followers believe that white Northern European descendants are superior to other races and often refer to people_of_color as &quot; mud people , &quot; said Noah Chandler , a spokesman for the Center for Democratic Renewal , an Atlanta-based group that tracks the religious right . Jubilee representatives did not return phone_calls seeking comment Wednesday . This will not be the first time Rogers has attended one of the group ' s annual Jubilation gatherings . Two years ago , the senator spoke against gun_control and environmentalists at a conference in Mariposa . The May-June , 1992 , edition of Jubilee heralded Rogers for his talk and praised him for never voting for a tax increase . The same issue carried an article describing the Los Angeles riots as &quot; savage and senseless Negro attacks on white_persons . . . and massive looting by Latinos who swarmed into shattered buildings as mad dogs attacking a helpless lamb. &quot; Jubilee writers also said that their conference had not turned_into a rollicking hate fest , as local sheriff ' s deputies apparently had feared , but was a quiet , family-oriented event . Although the Jubilee maintained in that edition that its stance on race superiority has been overstated in local newspapers , it counts a prominent organizer of the white_supremacist movement -- Beam -- among its staff writers . In 1984 , Beam , a former grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas , was ordered by a court to cease harassing Vietnamese shrimp fishermen in Galveston . Five years later , he led racist skinheads in an Aryan Nations march in Tennessee . Critics were up in arms this week over the fact that Rogers , who has represented Republican-leaning portions of Kern , Inyo , San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties for 18 years as a legislator , would join Jubilee supporters . &quot; These guys are just hatemongers and it ' s an absolute disgrace for a California state_senator to be speaking_to such a group , &quot; said the Rev . Jerry Sloan of the Sacramento-based Project Tocsin , an organization that monitors the religious right . &quot; The people with whom he is breaking_bread may be Christian , but they are definitely also white_supremacists , &quot; he said . Rogers , however , says he is only interested in finding supporters to back his resolution underscoring the U.S. Constitution ' s 10th Amendment , which says the federal_government cannot force unreasonable mandates on states . The 66-year-old senator , who will be ousted by term limits in two years , also authored a resolution to reaffirm Californians ' right to bear arms .</TEXT>
