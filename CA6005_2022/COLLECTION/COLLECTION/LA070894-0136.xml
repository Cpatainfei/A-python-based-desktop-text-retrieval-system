   <HEADLINE> SMOKE JUMPER RECALLS RACE AGAINST DEADLY FIRESTORM ; BLAZE : INJURED SURVIVOR OUTRAN ' EXPLOSION OF HEAT AND FLAMES , ' BUT THE RUSHING INFERNO OVERTOOK 12 COMRADES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the end , said firefighter Bradley Haugh , it came_down to the simple fact that &quot; Mother Nature didn ' t want us up there. &quot; Haugh stiffened Thursday as he recounted trying to outrun &quot; an explosion of heat and flames &quot; when winds whipped a small wildfire out of control near this western Colorado resort town , killing at least 12 of his fellow crew_members in one of the worst firefighting disasters in history . His only chance , the 32-year-old federal firefighter figured , was to try to make_it to a ridge opposite the cresting fire . &quot; It was coming fast , really fast . . . a firestorm that was unbelievably hot and intense , &quot; said Haugh , one of four injured firefighters among the 38 who escaped the inferno Wednesday . Two firefighters remained missing late Thursday . Haugh , seemingly oblivious to the gauze wrapping his burned left elbow , recalled Thursday that after reaching safety he looked_back over his shoulder and saw other firefighters running while yanking at protective fire shields folded at their belts . But he now thinks that some were unable to unfurl the aluminum and fiberglass blankets and get under them before galloping flames overtook them . &quot; We did everything we could with the resources available , &quot; said Haugh , of Gypsum , Colo. , who has worked for two years as a seasonal member of a U.S. Bureau of Land Management firefighting team . &quot; It was a freak microcosm of weather that kicked our butts. &quot; On Thursday , more_than 250 fresh crew_members tried to gain control of the 2 # 200-acre South Canyon fire , named for the area five miles west of Glenwood Springs where lightning sparked the blaze on July 4 . Overhead , aerial tankers and helicopters dropped flame retardant and water on hot spots . And most of the 75 residents evacuated late Wednesday night were allowed to return home . &quot; The fire right now is about controlled , to the extent that there isn ' t much wind and the slurry bombers have doused many of the hot spots , &quot; Garfield County Sheriff Vern Soucie said . Meanwhile , a separate federal fire investigation team had a grimmer mission : scouring the 7 # 000-foot-high blackened ridges of Storm King Mountain in search of the missing firefighters and identifying the bodies of the 12 known to have perished . The team also was trying to determine how the fire crews were overrun by flames and whether their protective equipment , including the shields , operated correctly . Several townsfolk grumbled that not enough crews and equipment were sent to the scene in the first two days of the fire . But U.S. Forest Service and BLM officials defended their actions , saying that larger fires raging elsewhere in nine Western states had a priority for limited manpower and resources until early Wednesday . Some of the firefighters worried that a failure of equipment had contributed to the deaths . Colorado Gov . Roy Romer said several of the surviving smoke jumpers -- specially trained firefighters airlifted to fire lines with heavy equipment to create firebreaks -- pleaded with him to ensure a full investigation . that ' s the reason , Romer said , that the bodies remained on the mountainside until late Thursday afternoon . &quot; Could something have been done ? &quot; Romer asked . &quot; An investigation will tell us . We ' re supposed to fly airplanes without crashing . Sometimes things go wrong. &quot; Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt , who rushed to Glenwood Springs from Idaho early Thursday , called the deaths a &quot; terrible tragedy. &quot; He predicted that it would be weeks before investigators would have any answers . But Babbitt , a firefighter in his youth in Arizona , hailed the fire crews as highly trained young_men and women of all races , many of them on seasonal summer jobs to help pay_for college . They are , he said , &quot; the face of the West. &quot; The deaths , Babbitt said , underscore the fact that &quot; despite all_the technology , all_the new techniques . . . fighting a fire is still a solitary act . . . . It takes tremendous courage to face risks like this. &quot; More_than 30 crew_members on the fire lines Wednesday were smoke jumpers imported from federal firefighting training bases in Missoula , Mont. , and McCall , Ida . Another 20 were members of a &quot; hotshot crew &quot; from Prineville , Ore . Nine of the dead or missing -- including four women -- were from the Prineville crew . The loss was unparalleled for the blue-collar , high desert town of 5 # 900 in central Oregon . &quot; This is going_to be very painful for this town , &quot; said Scott Cooper , Prineville ' s Chamber_of_Commerce executive_director , who went_to high_school with one of the lost firefighters . &quot; Everywhere we have a flag in town they are flying at half-staff . The entrance to the Forest Service headquarters is jammed . People are walking_around in a daze because they knew most of these kids . This was the second or third fire for that crew this year. &quot; Members of the Prineville crew listed among the dead or missing were : Scott Blegha of Claskanie , Ore. ; Jon Kelso of Prineville ; Kathi Beck of Eugene , Ore. ; Levi Brinkley , Burns , Ore. ; Bonnie Holtby , Prineville ; Rob Johnson , Redmond , Ore. ; Tammi Bickett , Powell Butte , Ore. ; Doug Dunbar , Redmond , Ore. , and Terri Hagen , Prineville . The other dead and missing were identified as : Donald Mackey of Hamilton , Mont. ; Roger Roth and James Thrash of McCall , and Richard Tyler and Robert Browning of Grand Junction , Colo . Authorities declined to identify which of the 14 names were those of the still-missing firefighters . Already Thursday , relatives of the dead were expressing bitterness over their loss . &quot; I just see it as somebody making a big mistake by sending them there , &quot; said Nadine Mackey , mother of Donald Mackey , a 32-year-old divorced father of a 4-year-old son and a daughter who turned 6 on Thursday . &quot; If you ' re a smoke jumper , you ' re way back in there by yourself . You have no place to go. &quot; Mackey , in a telephone_interview with ABC News , said she watched reports of the South Canyon fire Wednesday night from her Montana home , relieved that her son was supposed to be in Grand Junction , about 30 miles west of Glenwood Springs , and therefore not on the fire lines . She learned Thursday that she was wrong . &quot; He wasn ' t supposed to be there , &quot; Mackey said . &quot; He was supposed to be coming home. &quot; Of the four injured firefighters , only Eric Hipke , 32 , of Seattle , remained hospitalized Thursday . He was listed in stable condition with first- and second-degree_burns . Much of the talk in Glenwood Springs and elsewhere Thursday was about the resources available to the firefighters when the winds shifted so dramatically Wednesday afternoon . Federal wildfire officials said firefighters were battling 31 major fires that had consumed more_than 160 # 000 acres in nine Western states , including California , Montana , Arizona , New Mexico , Nevada , Utah , Oregon and Texas . On those fire lines were more_than 7 # 700 firefighters , 240 fire_engines , 55 helicopters and 25 air tankers . In Colorado alone , four other major fires burned Thursday . And until Wednesday morning , a blaze that burned at least five homes_in the town of Paonia , about 60 miles southwest of Glenwood Springs , commanded more resources , they said . Cindy McKee , a spokeswoman for the Colorado office of the BLM , rejected any suggestion that not enough crews were fighting the South Canyon blaze early enough . &quot; We put all_the resources available out there when we knew the fire was growing , &quot; she said . &quot; When the wind got high and we had to pull the bombers back ( about 3:30 p.m. Wednesday ) , that ' s when we figured the crew must have died . It all happened simultaneously. &quot; Times staff writer Sahagun reported from Glenwood Springs . Special correspondent Kristina Lindgren reported from Denver . Times staff writer Tony Perry in Glenwood Springs and researcher Ann Rovin in Denver also contributed to this story .
