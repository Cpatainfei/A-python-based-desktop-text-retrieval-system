   <HEADLINE> CLINTONS TURNING WHITE_HOUSE ' GREEN ' ; ECOLOGY : FIRST FAMILY MAKES OFFICIAL RESIDENCE MORE ENERGY-EFFICIENT , INSTALLS RECYCLING BINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bill and Hillary Clinton want to leave an enduring legacy to the White_House , and you can color it green . that ' s green , as in environmentally sound and energy-efficient and easier on the pocketbook . As part of the effort the Clintons already have taken delivery of a super-efficient refrigerator touted as an energy and money saver . And , for the first time , recycling bins have been installed in the White_House residential quarters so glass and newspapers can be separated from the Clintons ' trash . Planning is under way to reglaze the third-floor solarium , increasing window performance by as much as 85 % and reducing the need for air conditioning . Even the incandescent bulbs used in the table_lamps in the President ' s study have been scrutinized and found wanting . New and compact fluorescent bulbs are suggested to save energy and money . Ornate Victorian skylights over stairwells in the Old Executive Office_Building next to the White_House are being scraped free_of decades-old paint and cleaned of grime to bring daylight back into the center of the granite structure and reduce electric_bills . The Administration summed_up the first phase of the effort as it issued an action plan titled , &quot; The Greening of the White House. &quot; The goal is to cut energy consumption in the 18-acre executive complex by 30 % by the year 2005 without reducing the comfort of those living and working there . The &quot; greening &quot; report suggests improvements in heating and cooling systems , indoor air quality , water management and lighting . The effort is being coordinated by a team of 100 architects , engineers , building managers and environmentalists . They aim to produce a package of improvements that could be a model for offices , stores and homes nationwide . Clinton commissioned the enterprise last April 21 in an Earth Day address , saying , &quot; I want to make the White_House a model for other federal agencies , for state and local_governments , for business and for families in their homes. &quot; &quot; Before I ask you to do the best you can in your house , I ought to make_sure I ' m doing the best I can in my house , &quot; he said . Cathy Zoi , deputy director of the White_House Office of Environmental Policy , said the Clintons regard the project as an important legacy . &quot; This could be their contribution to the White_House as opposed to china or other things , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
