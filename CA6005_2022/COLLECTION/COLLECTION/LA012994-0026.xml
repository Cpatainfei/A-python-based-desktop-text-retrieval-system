   <HEADLINE> SACRAMENTO FILE : BILL WOULD FORCE MANSON TO PAY PART OF T-SHIRT ROYALTIES TO STATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A bill to require state_prison inmates receiving outside income from movies , books or other royalties to pay as much as 50 % of the money for their incarceration costs has been introduced in the Assembly . The legislation ( AB 2579 ) stems from the recent sale of T-shirts endorsed by mass murderer Charles Manson that is expected to earn him up_to $ 60 # 000 this year . One T-shirt design has a picture of Manson behind bars on the front and the words &quot; Charlie Don ' t Surf &quot; on the back . Assemblyman Dean Andal ( R-Stockton ) said : &quot; It is inconceivable that this man may make $ 60 # 000 in royalties from his perverse cult following but not pay a penny to defray the costs of his confinement. &quot; The average yearly cost is $ 22 # 000 to keep a criminal behind bars , where Manson has been for 23 years , Andal said . In a related action , Sen . Charles M . Calderon ( D-Whittier ) has introduced legislation ( SB 1330 ) to require criminals who earn outside income based on the notoriety of their crimes to place the money in a trust_fund to reimburse their victims .
