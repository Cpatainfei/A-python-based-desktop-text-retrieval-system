   <HEADLINE> BLAIR GETS A BOOST FROM THE STANDS ; SPEEDSKATING : SHE CITES PRESENCE OF ADVERSARY AS INCENTIVE AND POSTS IMPRESSIVE RESULTS IN OLYMPIC QUALIFYING EVENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Her recent times in the 500-meter sprint weren ' t up_to her standards , and in_general , three-time Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair simply had the blahs . All it took_to cure her was knowing that Qiabo Ye of China , who had edged her out of the world sprint championship last February , was watching her from the stands Friday in the first day of the U.S. long-track speedskating trials at the Pettit National Ice Center . &quot; I think for the most part that anytime I get_into an area where I have very strong competitors , it makes me compete harder , &quot; Blair said after winning the first 500 heat in a track-record 39.92 seconds . &quot; If anything , her being here is going_to be a benefit to me instead of the opposite. &quot; Blair also skated the 1 # 500 meters in a track-record 2:06.50. Dan Jansen , world record-holder in the 500 , tied a record at the year-old track with a time of 36.42 , but was sluggish in his 1 # 500 heat and was third at 1:57.47. Brian Wanek had the day ' s fastest time , 1:57.28. Each race is repeated at least once , with the slowest result discarded . Times are converted into points to determine who will qualify for the Olympic team . Blair , the only woman to win consecutive Olympic gold medals in the 500 , openly disapproves of Ye , who tested positive for steroids at the 1988 world sprint championships and was sent home from the ' 88 Calgary Olympics . Although Ye maintains that she took the drugs unknowingly , on the advice of the team doctor , Blair has said she believes Ye still takes performance-enhancing substances . They were never the best of friends , said Ye , who is in Milwaukee to train for a World Cup event this month , &quot; but we would say , ' Hello , good race , ' if she won or if I won. &quot; They no longer speak . &quot; Bonnie said I still use doping . I was angry , &quot; said Ye , who was second to Blair in the 500 and 1 # 000 at the 1992 Albertville Winter_Olympics . &quot; After that , I don ' t like her anymore . She is a very good skater , even now . Such a long_time she has had successful seasons , and I was proud_of her , too . . . . I don ' t like people to recall such bad things . It makes you sad again. &quot; Said Blair : &quot; I ' ve never been in favor of what she has done . As ( for ) being friends with her , I look_at it as a situation that if somebody does something I don ' t approve of , I don ' t go overboard to associate myself with them because that makes me look bad. &quot; Blair ' s coach , Nick Thometz , credited Ye ' s presence with spurring Blair to her best performance in weeks . &quot; She might not want to go_out and not skate well in front of one of her main competitors , &quot; Thometz said . &quot; There ' s not a whole_lot of women in the world who can skate ( the 500 meters ) under 40 , so for her to do_it here sends a real message. &quot; Ye has yet to regain full strength in her left knee after an operation in August to repair damaged ligaments and cartilage . &quot; This is my last season , so I will do my very , very best , &quot; Ye said , &quot; but if I do very bad , if I just get fifth or sixth in the World Cup and sprint ( championships ) in Calgary , I don ' t think I go_to the Olympics. &quot; Jansen and his coach , Peter Mueller , complained that the brittle ice conditions hurt Jansen ' s ability to accelerate coming_out of turns_in the 1 # 500 . &quot; I didn ' t skate very well today -- my 500 was OK , &quot; said Jansen , who set the world_record of 35.92 last month . &quot; I ' ve been having trouble getting healthy . I had a fever Wednesday night . It is time to get_into racing mode , and I think that will happen naturally with the World Cup coming . I need to skate well and feel good during these races for my confidence . If I skate a first turn like I did today , it ' s not going_to help my head. &quot;</TEXT>
