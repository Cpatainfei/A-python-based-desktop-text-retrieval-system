   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OAK VIEW ; PROPERTIES DONATED TO NONPROFIT GROUP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year after Habitat for Humanity volunteers provided a home for 74-year-old Charles Henderson , the Oak View resident returned the favor by donating two of his three small parcels to the nonprofit group . Using donations of money , building materials and manpower , Habitat for Humanity , which builds housing for poor families , will construct houses on Henderson ' s land for two west Ventura County families , Habitat Chairwoman Elaine Ferguson said . Construction is set to begin later this month . &quot; This is the pioneer concept of barn raising where people help their neighbors , &quot; Ferguson said . The project , expected to cost about $ 30 # 000 per house , is being funded with donations and $ 20 # 000 in Community Development Block_Grant funds from the Ventura County Board of Supervisors . The Ojai Presbyterian_Church pledged another $ 20 # 000 over three years , and several local business and homeowners have promised to donate tile , lumber , windows and other building_materials . The residents , who have not been chosen , will buy the houses at a low price and with a no-interest mortgage . Habitat hopes to have the families selected by July and the first family moved_in by Christmas . The families selected must provide 500 hours of work , called sweat equity , as a down_payment . Seventy-five of those hours will be spent in a training course on how to maintain the house . To qualify for the Habitat project , applicants must need housing , not have resources to buy or build shelter , and be unable to qualify for a government housing loan , Ferguson said . Also , applicants must have lived or worked in the west Ventura County area for at least a year , and have steady incomes of from $ 13 # 000 to $ 27 # 000 for a four-person family , she said . &quot; These are four-bedroom homes so we will be looking_at larger families , &quot; she said . Habitat also plans to build houses in Ventura and Fillmore for smaller families and individuals in the future . Ferguson said Habitat needs people to help choose the families and is holding two community meetings this week to form a selection committee . The first meeting will be at 7 p.m. Monday at the Ojai Methodist_Church . The second will be at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Oak View Community_Center . TRACY WILSON</TEXT>
