   <HEADLINE> WARNING CAME TOO LATE FOR PRECARIOUS FUND ; CRISIS : CITRON AIDE SAW DANGER AND THREATENED TO QUIT . BANKRUPTCY MOVE FOLLOWED COUNTY ' S FRANTIC BAILOUT SEARCH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a defining moment in what would become the county ' s worst financial crisis . In early November , Orange County Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe met with his since-departed boss , Robert L . Citron , and threatened to resign . County officials said Wednesday that Raabe was worried about Citron ' s management of the gigantic bond portfolio that contained billions of dollars invested by more_than 185 municipalities and government_agencies . Raabe feared a cash flow crisis , and he thought the pool was in serious jeopardy . Just a_few days before , the Irvine Ranch Water District had sent the county treasurer a letter expressing similar concerns about the bond portfolio . Citron did not flinch . It was as if he was in denial , official sources said . The unraveling had clearly begun . On Tuesday , county government -- its options apparently exhausted and its financial SOS to the state and the Clinton_Administration unanswered -- filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in United States history . The fateful decision to seek protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code was reached after a long and frustrating attempt by county leaders , attorneys and major investors to salvage the bond portfolio . &quot; We were just trying to hang_in there and make a bad situation better and get some control of it , &quot; Steven E . Lewis , the county ' s auditor-controller , said of the effort to cope_with financial crisis . &quot; We went everywhere looking_for help . In the end , I don ' t think we had much choice. &quot; Raabe ' s threat to resign was a watershed event for county officials , who shortly thereafter began to take seriously the prospect that Citron ' s aggressive investment strategy had placed investors and local_governments squarely in harm ' s way . Citron and Raabe , sources said , met with County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider to discuss the pool ' s problems . Schneider formed a management team of county officials to review the status of the $ 20-billion portfolio . Then , during the first few weeks of November , Schneider individually briefed members of the county Board of Supervisors and revealed that the fund had liquidity problems . Neither Citron , Schneider nor Raabe could be reached for comment Wednesday night . In interviews this week , county supervisors all said they had no idea how severe the bond portfolio ' s troubles were until the weekend before the bankruptcy petition was filed . &quot; The speed with which these events have transpired is of shocking proportions , &quot; said County Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez . &quot; It ' s a difficult challenge that we now face . My reaction was of tremendous shock. &quot; Citron ' s investment strategy relied heavily on using the investment pool ' s U.S. Treasury_bills , notes and bonds as collateral to borrow short-term at low interest_rates , and investing the borrowed funds in mid-term corporate_bonds and securities that pay a higher rate of return . The strategy could yield large returns while interest_rates remained low and stable . But it could backfire when interest_rates rise , as they have since the first of the year . When interest_rates go_up , bonds and securities purchased when there were lower interest_rates lose value . Orange County ' s problem is magnified because Citron leveraged the fund almost 3 to 1 , by putting_up $ 7.5 billion in bonds as collateral for loans that enabled him to buy $ 20 million worth of bonds . Citron has admitted that he did not foresee , as other investors have , the rapid increase in interest_rates this year by the Federal_Reserve_Board , which has been concerned about the prospect of inflation as the economy continues to expand . But according to his next-door neighbor , Dan Miller , Citron still defends his actions as county treasurer . &quot; I have nothing to be ashamed of , &quot; Miller quoted Citron as saying . &quot; I did nothing wrong . And I ' m feeling pretty comfortable with myself. &quot; Miller said Citron told him he could repeat the comments to the news media . In mid-November , the outlook for the fund worsened when the Federal_Reserve_Board raised interest_rates 0.75 % . The move prompted one fund investor , Peer Swan , the president of the Irvine Ranch Water District , to ask Citron to pay_out $ 100 million of the $ 400 million his agency had put into the pool . This triggered further scrutiny of the fund ' s cash position . The review discovered that the portfolio ' s cash balance had dropped rapidly from $ 2.2 billion during the months before to $ 350 million by Nov . 30 . Dec . 1 , rumors swept_through Wall_Street that the county ' s investment pool was suffering from cash flow problems . The unfounded reports sent shock_waves through the financial markets where municipal securities are traded . Before day ' s end , county officials disclosed that the investment pool containing $ 20 billion worth of bonds and securities had plunged in value at least $ 1.5 billion -- more_than 20 % of the pool investors ' total stake . Raabe and Citron were adamant that the fund investors could ride_out the downturn if they stuck_together . In the week since the staggering drop_in value was revealed , Orange County officials , investors and financial advisers frantically worked to stave_off the worsening financial situation . Top county administrators and members of the Board of Supervisors held marathon meetings to unravel the situation and sort_out their options . They have been awakened in the middle of the night by sheriff ' s deputies to attend special closed-door sessions to figure_out what to do as the financial crisis deepened . Lewis said that during one stretch he worked 35 hours straight . Others have put_in longer hours , like Raabe , who was appointed Citron ' s temporary replacement after the treasurer resigned and who reportedly toiled four days with little rest . &quot; We have been working_day and night , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; It has been a killer as far as the amount of work. &quot; Over the weekend , investigators from the federal Securities and Exchange Commission pored over the portfolio ' s books and contemplated appointing a receiver for the fund . Vasquez said the Securities and Exchange Commission consulted with former Gov . George Deukmejian about the possibility of being the county ' s receiver . On Sunday , the crisis had become too_much for Citron to bear . He offered to resign . One county official said that Schneider personally drafted Citron ' s resignation letter and drove to his house in Santa Ana to have him sign it . According to the source , Citron &quot; broke down. &quot; Bert Scott , head of the county ' s General Services_Agency and a close friend of Citron , visited Citron after his resignation . &quot; He ' s doing considerably well under the circumstances , &quot; Scott said . He is &quot; going_through a healing process . That might take a little time. &quot; On Monday , Citron ' s departure was made public . That same day , the SEC told the county it would not get involved in a receivership . At that point , the county made pleas to state and federal representatives to help them solve their liquidity problem . &quot; We went_to the state and even the Clinton_Administration , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; They didn ' t do enough. &quot; Later that day , county officials worked behind the scenes trying to decide whether to sell the entire bond portfolio , albeit at a tremendous loss . The county shopped around for a number of Wall_Street firms to do_it . &quot; You can ' t imagine the pressure we were under , &quot; County Supervisor William G . Steiner said , referring to the proposed liquidation of the fund . Steiner and Supervisor Roger R . Stanton were concerned about liquidating the fund without consulting with investors in the portfolio . While the county found a firm interested in liquidating the entire fund , officials were busy consulting with some of the larger investors . &quot; There was a whole big room full of people in New York City with computers ready to go and sell it in five minutes , &quot; said Steiner . &quot; It was a huge decision for us to make. &quot; The county decided not to sell when it could not determine how much the investment was worth . It appeared that the only option left was bankruptcy . At 3 a.m. the next day , sheriff ' s deputies and county officials rousted the Board of Supervisors from their sleep for an emergency briefing to deal with a growing default situation . While board_members met in closed_session throughout the day , Orange County defaulted_on 10 to 12 loans used to buy bonds in the fund . CS First Boston , a Wall_Street investment bank , and other Wall_Street firms then seized about $ 2 billion in bonds and put them on the market . The Wall_Street firms had made loans to the fund , which were secured by bonds and holders of the county ' s municipal debt . Lenders can look_to their collateral for repayment if defaults occur . County Supervisor Thomas R . Riley said officials were left with no choice after a number of investment_bankers declined to roll_over or renew $ 1.2 billion of existing financial instruments called reverse repurchase agreements . The action resulted in a default of the agreements with the county . &quot; We didn ' t know where we were going . We didn ' t know whether we were going_to be able to operate the county in a manner that would be acceptable to us. &quot;</TEXT>
