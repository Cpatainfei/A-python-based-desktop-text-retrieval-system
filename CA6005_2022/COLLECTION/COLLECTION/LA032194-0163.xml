   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN ALBUM : RIVER HAS PUSHY PANHANDLERS HANGING IN TREES ; FLORIDA OFFICIALS WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE 250 MONKEYS FROM TOURIST ATTRACTION . THE ANIMALS HAVE MANY FANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many years before Mickey_Mouse -- or even Walt Disney -- was born , a monumental artesian limestone spring east of this old town in central Florida became the state ' s first great tourist attraction . Aboard steamboats negotiating winding streams all_the way from Jacksonville , early eco-tourists -- including Ulysses S . Grant , Harriet Beecher Stowe , Thomas A . Edison and Henry_Ford -- came_to relax and marvel at huge fish deep in the gin-clear water gushing from the earth . Visitors from all_over the world still come_to see the spring and ride glass-bottom boats down the seven-mile-long Silver River that flows_from it . Along the banks , they can see all manner of creatures in the wild -- turtles ; fat , contented alligators ; elusive river_otters ; great_blue_herons , and acrobatic rhesus_monkeys . Rhesus_monkeys ? In the wild ? In Florida ? Indeed . As_many as 250 of them in several troops are_on the loose -- this after more_than 200 were captured during the 1980s . They swing in the trees along the river , hide_out in the Ocala National Forest , occasionally loll on boat docks on the Ocklawaha River and show_up near the community of Ft . McCoy . Several years ago , a North Carolina family canoeing found itself surrounded by 60 to 80 monkeys after a small boy taunted one of them with food . Reports indicate that they have harassed picnickers and dogs in the area and raided orange groves . The first reported trouble came more_than 50 years ago , when a lawman shot a monkey for what was regarded_as threatening behavior . Folklore has it that the monkeys were left_behind when MGM came_to film the first of six Tarzan movies along the river . The truth is that they were already here when Johnny Weismuller and Maureen O ' Sullivan arrived with a chimpanzee to make &quot; Tarzan Finds a Son. &quot; Ancestors of the animals that now beguile tourists were brought_in by an entrepreneur in 1938 . Colonel Tooey -- he wasn ' t a colonel , his name was Colonel -- released a monkey troop on an island in the river , figuring they would enhance visitors ' illusions of traveling through a jungle . Tooey , manager of the Silver River Jungle Boat Cruise , knew more about tourists than he knew about monkeys . The animals swam off the island and have proliferated in the forest -- intermittent efforts to deport , sterilize or kill them notwithstanding . But , as Tooey expected , they have added_to the appeal of the Silver Spring Attraction . The bad news is that two years ago , the monkeys were found to be infected with simian Herpes B virus , which can be fatal if transmitted to humans through a bite . The state of Florida -- which had long been interested in taking_over the commercial Silver Spring Attraction , removing all_of its exotic species and turning the area into a state park -- by that time had acquired 4 # 000 acres along the river . Mark Glisson of the state Division of Recreation and Parks stepped_in to get_rid_of the monkeys , planning -- after consultation with Humane Society officials -- to trap , tranquilize and kill them . &quot; I blithely stepped into it and very quickly learned that euthanasia is not an option , &quot; he said . Almost overnight , animal welfare activists and visitors captivated by the monkeys produced petitions with thousands of signatures demanding that they be spared . When the Ocala Star-Banner solicited reader opinions , it received 625 replies , 615 of them calling_for the monkeys to remain along the river . But the viral infection demanded that something be done . The monkeys , Glisson said , &quot; are not only intelligent , gregarious and adaptive , but pushy and very aggressive. &quot; The state has postponed opening its 4 # 000 acres along the river , although the public can pass_through in boats . &quot; Everything else , &quot; Glisson said , &quot; has been deferred until the monkey issue is resolved. &quot; Late last year , owners of the Silver Spring Attraction at the spring itself agreed to sell their remaining property and facilities to the state . Under the arrangement , the owners will continue to operate their animal attractions , the boat rides and tourist facilities for another 15 years . When the property is turned_over to the state , it is understood that all_of the exotic species , monkeys included , will be gone . It is up_to the Legislature to decide how . A study led by the University of Florida has presented several options , including euthanasia , sterilization , relocation or confinement in a huge compound . All of these would require capture . But that , said one bemused local resident , would pose no great difficulty . All it would require , he said , is that Silver Spring Attraction officials stop feeding them sweet_potatoes , as they do to keep them on the property . Then they would simply walk into local restaurants , where they could be arrested , he says .</TEXT>
