   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / JULIE CART ; ROTHENBERG MIGHT HAVE STEPPED OVER LINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alan Rothenberg , president of the World Cup Organizing Committee , the U.S. Soccer Federation and of a proposed new professional soccer league , has always danced closed to the edge . In fact , he seems to revel in the risk . It ' s not always a bad thing . Soccer leaders in this country have traditionally been conservative , narrow and slightly afraid of venturing beyond familiar borders . They had the gumption to bid for the 1994 World Cup , got_it , and then very nearly lost_it through inaction . Along came Rothenberg . Where the former regime would examine a risky situation and ask , &quot; Why ? &quot; Rothenberg -- without pausing to take_a_breath -- would say &quot; Why not ? &quot; He would detail an attorney to come_up with a business plan , and find a way to fund the project . Some risks are calculated , however , and some are foolish . And lately , World Cup ' 94 might very well have taken the latter course . For months , money has been trickling from World Cup coffers into the bank_account of Major_League Soccer , the proposed new pro league . The trickle has grown_into millions of dollars and the Internal Revenue Service is reviewing the legality and tax ramifications of the situation . A few things to consider : Rothenberg is president of World Cup and heads the management team of the proposed league . World Cup is a tax-exempt , nonprofit entity . MLS is a private company that will operate for profit . World Cup is charged with organizing this summer ' s finals and , stop if you ' ve heard this before , leaving &quot; a legacy for soccer in the United States. &quot; MLS exists to form a viable professional league and make money for its investors . Few noticed or seemed to care when nearly half a_million World Cup dollars were used to fund the sophisticated business plan that MLS presented to the U.S. Soccer Federation . The MLS bid won . Remember who ' s president of the USSF . Too_bad the two other bidders didn ' t have the advantage of a multimillion-dollar sugar_daddy . Members of the World Cup board of directors , who are supposed to vote to approve all such expenditures , are a little slow or a little uninterested . But a_few began to notice that the trickle of money to MLS had become a torrent . At a board_meeting in Las Vegas last December , a tax attorney was present , at the request of some board_members . The question : What are the potential problems when a nonprofit corporation funnels money to a for-profit company ? Surprisingly , even with the questions being raised about the advisability of such money transfers , the World Cup board of directors voted to give Major_League Soccer $ 3.5 million for start-up costs . All but two board_members voted for the expenditure . One , Charles Cale , voted against it and another , Marian Wright-Edelman , abstained because she couldn ' t hear the proceedings clearly over the telephone . What ' s still not clear is if the money was a loan or a gift or , as some say , an investment in the league . MLS , if it ever exists as a viable corporate entity , is under no compulsion to repay the $ 3.5 million . Why should it ? Nothing was put_in writing and board_members say it will be settled after the World Cup . Where does the line form for that kind of deal ? The tax issue is thorny . World Cup tax attorneys met with the IRS last month in Washington , D.C. , to seek a ruling . The IRS could say , &quot; No problem . Keep giving your money away. &quot; It could allow the transaction and begin to tax the gift / loan . Or , the IRS could revoke World Cup ' s tax-exempt status and take all that legacy money for itself . One member of the USSF who has knowledge of tax laws called World Cup ' s decision to fund MLS , risky , at best . How sensible is it to spend the legacy money now and risk any future profit ? What business does the World Cup organizing committee have in funding or becoming otherwise involved with the proposed professional league ? The international soccer federation ' s mandate to launch a Division I league was to the USSF , not World Cup . If the United States sports market can embrace professional soccer , and if MLS is the right approach , why not let it stand on the strength of its own proposals and plans , rather than being propped_up by World Cup ? This country has one of the most competitive marketplaces in the world , and if MLS is truly a viable and worthwhile business it will do just fine on its own . Why bankrupt the World Cup ? Why take the risk ? * The other shoe was finally dropped this month , when the American Professional Soccer League made_it clear it was going_to challenge the MLS for the title of North_America ' s premier professional soccer league . The soccer community had been waiting for the APSL , which had bid for Division I status but lost to Major_League Soccer , to declare if it was going_to accept its secondary position or fight . With the announcement of the league ' s expansion by three teams , the APSL clearly is going_to fight . League chairman William De La Pena notes that his league is currently the only professional outdoor league and its longstanding position within the soccer community makes_it perfectly placed to become the new Division I league that is expected to begin in 1995 . The APSL expansion is projected to bring the league to 12 teams by 1995 and De La Pena says that should speak volumes about the APSL ' s financial viability . &quot; There are a significant group of people who want to be part of traditional soccer , &quot; said De La Pena , who is also the owner of the L.A. Salsa . &quot; There are business people who are entrepreneurs and want to run their own team. &quot; His reference was the MLS ' single-entity concept , where all players , coaches and team administrators are employees of the league . De La Pena said the APSL does not want to have an antagonistic relationship with the USSF , but said the league would be willing to go_to court to protect its right to exist . &quot; We will protect our ability to play , that ' s for certain , &quot; he said . &quot; We will meet them on the field -- let ' s compete on the field . that ' s where people will decide the best team or league , on the field. &quot; Regarding the possibility that the professional mess could end_up in the courts , De La Pena said the APSL ' s attorneys are confident . &quot; Look_at the 1967 antitrust_case , &quot; he said . That case involved three competing professional soccer leagues in the United States . The USSF awarded Division I status to one , prompting a lawsuit by one of the others . By the time it was settled , remnants of the three leagues became the North_American Soccer League , the last viable pro league in this country . Soccer Notes The schedule for the U.S. national team is intensifying . The team ' s next game is March 26 against Bolivia at Dallas and World Cup preparation begins in_earnest next month . Three games are scheduled in mid-April to approximate the World Cup ' s first-round schedule . The United States plays Moldova April 16 at Jacksonville , Fla. , and again April 20 at Davidson , N.C. , then Iceland on April 24 at Southwestern College in Chula Vista . Tentatively scheduled is an April 13 game against Argentina at Buenos Aires . The team plays Chile on April 30 at Albuquerque , then three games are scheduled against as yet unnamed opponents : May 7 at Cal State Fullerton , May 15 at East Los Angeles College and May 21 at Cleveland . The U.S. will play Saudi_Arabia May 25 at an undetermined location and Greece May 28 at New Haven , Conn . Bill Nuttall , U.S. team general_manager , said he hopes to schedule Mexico on June 4 at the Rose Bowl .</TEXT>
