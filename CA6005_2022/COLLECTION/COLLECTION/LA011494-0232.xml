   <HEADLINE> CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE : FLOOD OF OPINION ON PHONE RATES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forced to reconsider its decision to boost basic telephone rates due_to procedural irregularities , the California Public_Utilities Commission is giving participants another crack at it . Local telephone_companies and ratepayer advocacy groups have recently filed hundreds of pages of documents seeking changes . Here are some highlights : * The PUC ' s Division of Ratepayer Advocates strongly suggests that the increase in basic residential rates for Pacific Bell customers to $ 13 from $ 8.35 is excessive . The division estimates the rate hike would provide a windfall of up_to $ 200 million for Pac Bell . * Pacific Bell says the division is wrong . It says it could lose toll revenue -- money from in-state calls beyond 12 miles -- as customers switch to cheaper calling plans and services . * GTE of California says its residential rates aren ' t high enough to compensate for an estimated $ 215 revenue shortfall . GTE wants to increase charges for basic residential service to $ 19.50 a month from the current $ 9.75. The rescinded decision set a $ 17.80 rate . As an alternative to the $ 19.50 rate , GTE is asking_for a surcharge on all customers . * The city of Los Angeles called the rescinded decision &quot; anti-business. &quot; It said increases in monthly basic business rates -- to $ 10.86 from $ 8.35 for Pac Bell and to $ 25 from $ 9.10 for GTE -- would &quot; discourage business growth and reduce the amount_of_money flowing into the economy. &quot; The PUC is expected to issue a new decision this spring . * Coupon usage clipped : Consumers redeemed 12 % fewer coupons last year than in 1992 , the first time coupon usage has declined in 23 years , reports the coupon-processing firm of NCH Promotional Services . The company said that while manufacturers issued fewer coupons last year , usage declined primarily because manufacturers shortened average expiration dates on coupons to 3.1 months from 4 months . The shorter expiration period in 1993 meant there were 26 % fewer usable coupons in any given month , the company said . NCH Promotional Services said manufacturers have tightened expiration dates to limit their liabilities and to move products more quickly through stores . The number of coupons issued declined because some manufacturers shifted to everyday-low-pricing strategies . Procter &amp; Gamble , for example , has lowered prices and eliminated coupons on some items , such_as disposable diapers . * Getting your interest : Mellon Bank this week is introducing a credit_card that refunds interest payments to cardholders after 20 years . The bank says that at today ' s interest_rates , the average cardholder would pay 17.9 % on balances and get_back $ 8 # 700 in 2014 . Is this a good_deal ? It depends . The bank won ' t pay you interest on your interest . So people who pay their balances off monthly and invest what they would have paid in interest could earn double or triple what Mellon will pay in 20 years . The card makes more sense for people who seldom pay their balances monthly . But these people may want to choose a card that charges less than 17.9 % interest and enjoy savings now , not 20 years from now . * A better idea : &quot; Put Ford quality in your financial future , &quot; says the letter to Ford car owners from San Francisco-based First Nationwide Bank . The Ford-owned thrift is pitching an annuity issued by another Ford unit , Ford Life_Insurance Co . What the letter doesn ' t say is that Ford may be taking the financial out of its future . The car_manufacturer is reportedly trying to unload money-losing First Nationwide . The life_insurance unit , which is separate from First Nationwide , would presumably remain under the Ford umbrella . * Fast fries : When we spotted &quot; Fast Fries &quot; from Ore-Ida Foods Inc. , we thought we ' d finally found a frozen French fry that cooks quickly . We were wrong . The label says these fries are ready in 20 minutes , fairly typical for frozen fries . What makes them fast ? The label on the back of the package says the fries are &quot; fast-food style. &quot; * Oops : We mischaracterized LDDS Communications in last week ' s column . The Jackson , Miss.-based firm has a tiny 2 % share of the long-distance telephone market , but with about $ 1.5 billion in revenue , it isn ' t small .</TEXT>
