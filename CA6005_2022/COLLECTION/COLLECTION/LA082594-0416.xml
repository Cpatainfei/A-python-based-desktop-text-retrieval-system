   <HEADLINE> HE ' S TACKLING A NEW ENDEAVOR ; SEMIPRO FOOTBALL : AFTER LOSING HIS JOB , CLINT DURAN DISCOVERED HE HAD NOT LOST HIS LOVE FOR THE GRIDIRON , SO HE STARTED HIS OWN TEAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After graduating from Montebello High in 1987 , it didn ' t take long for Clint Duran to discover that there was not a great demand for 5-foot-5 , 120-pound receivers in college football . That did little to quell Duran ' s affection for the game . So Duran did the next best thing -- he created his own semiprofessional team . Next month , he will return to the gridiron for the first time since high_school as a player and owner of the Montebello Panthers . &quot; Some guys might want to use semipro football as a steppingstone to the pros , but there are guys who love the game of football and don ' t care whether it ' s pro or street ball , &quot; Duran , 24 , said . &quot; Just like in any sport , there are die-hard athletes who live and die for football . I created the team for those guys. &quot; Duran has paid the price . About $ 20 # 000 , to be exact , to cover the cost of uniforms , equipment , insurance and rental of the field at Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary High for home_games . The Panthers will play in the California Football_League , which includes the Southern California Storm , San Diego Storm , the Orange County Cowboys , San Bernardino Blitz , Antelope Valley Crusaders and Ventura County Warriors . The Panthers , who open the season Sept . 10 , will play a 12-game regular season schedule under NFL rules , culminating with the playoffs and an all-star game . The team is coached by Jess Hunter , an architect from Pico Rivera . Players do not receive a salary and must pay a $ 100 registration fee . They must supply their own pads and helmets . Ages range from 18 to 34 with varying amounts of experience . Tight end Paul Albertini and fullback Nate Bolton played_at Long_Beach State and Fresno State , respectively . Quarterback Joey Jordan helped Schurr High to a Southern Section title in 1980 and was an All-Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference selection for four years at Whittier College . Jordan , 31 , a teacher at Eastmont Intermediate School in Montebello , played in Europe the past several years . He intended to visit a_couple_of practices but has wound_up as offensive coordinator . One of Jordan ' s former fifth-grade students , Dennis Felix , 18 , is a receiver on the team . &quot; They didn ' t have any plays and they were using simple formations and routes , &quot; Jordan said . &quot; There was no way they were going_to beat anybody with that . I started calling my own plays and got locked onto it . I finally decided to stick it out with them. &quot; For Duran , the franchise has become a full-time endeavor . Duran was released from his job as a quality-control technician for a food manufacturing company in February and spends most of his day searching for sponsors from local businesses . &quot; I got laid_off at the perfect time , &quot; Duran said . &quot; I was working nights and it would have interfered with soliciting sponsorship for the team . Plus , this is a lot more fun than looking_at crackers all day. &quot; Duran , who will play tailback and has gained 35 pounds since high_school , first became interested in semipro football after answering a newspaper_ad for the San Bernardino Blitz last summer . He practiced with the Blitz for several weeks , but said he left the team because of favoritism by the owner , who was also the coach and quarterback . &quot; I was there to have fun , but I was pretty disappointed with all_the conflicts with the owner , &quot; Duran said . &quot; I wasn ' t comfortable with the situation. &quot; The experience , however , put the wheels in motion for Duran to start his own team . The Panthers were unanimously accepted into the league at a board_meeting in March . Finding players was another thing . Only five showed_up on the first day of practice and even Duran ' s brother , Frank , was reluctant to join at first . &quot; There was no organization and it was just a bunch of weekend warriors , &quot; Frank Duran , 27 , said . &quot; A lot of guys would show_up one day and would n ' t show_up the next . I didn ' t really feel it was worth it to get beat_up and not get paid , but I started building friendships and going regularly. &quot; So did others . The team has nearly 40 players and is still growing . Most of the players hold full-time jobs and have families , which are factors_in limiting the team to only two practices a week at Chet Holifield Park in Montebello . &quot; It ' s been a matter of friends telling friends , &quot; Duran said . &quot; Getting_to the first game has been a headache , getting the equipment and getting the guys all out at_the_same_time . It ' s been adventure and hasn ' t been easy . We ' re going into this blindfolded but hopefully we ' ll do_well and get some fan support. &quot;</TEXT>
