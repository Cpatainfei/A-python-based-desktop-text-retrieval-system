   <TEXT> * The plight of writer Taslima Nasrin ( June 11 ) should raise the conscience of all who support the Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human_Rights . The arrest_warrant and other reported demands to kill her are appalling in this day and age.Similar threats and a &quot; death_warrant &quot; were issued against author Salman Rushdie . These are symptoms of the rise of religious right groups and obscure fundamentalism all_over South Asia from Afghanistan to Bangladesh . India , which proclaims itself to be a &quot; secular &quot; state , has not been able to combat the rise of Hindu fundamentalism and its aspiration to bring fascism in the name of nationalism . NIRMAL K . MISHRA Northridge * How about one of your writers doing a story on the effects of &quot; Christianization &quot; of America through stealth candidates , etc. ? Your article , &quot; Bangladesh Writer Hides to Avoid Arrest Over Her Quoted Remarks on Koran , &quot; ought to be an eye-opener for those who lust mightily to turn the U.S. into one giant Christian-dominated penal colony . I ' m an old-time Orange County Republican conservative and this push to Christianize America through politics scares me ! I ' d be interested in reading what your writers could come_up with regarding the potential for our U.S. brand of Christian fundamentalism someday mimicking Islam ' s outrages . As a Christian , I ' m fully aware that a lot of my fellows would be more_than happy to sell their freedoms down the river if they thought , by doing so , they could control or eliminate liberals .
