   <HEADLINE> THESE MOUSE CLUBS AREN ' T FOR MICKEY ; FANS CAN CHAT WITH R.E.M ' S MICHAEL STIPE , TELL CONAN O ' BRIEN WHAT THEY THINK OF HIS JOKES AND EXPLORE THE SUBJECT OF PATRICK STEWART ' S BALDNESS -- IF THEY ' RE ON-LINE , THAT IS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last July , R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe turned_on a personal_computer and chatted with 900 # 000 of his closest friends . Taking occasional breaks from recording &quot; Monster &quot; at Ocean Way Studio in Hollywood , Stipe used an America Online account -- stipey.aol.com -- to post e-mail comments to an R.E.M. newsgroup . AOL subscribers could join in or merely watch as Stipe spent a week clearing_up debates over song lyrics and entertaining system users with anecdotes from past tours . When one R.E.M. fan suggested that the band perform at Detroit ' s Fox Theatre , Stipe answered in the casual style of e-mail , where there is rarely capitalization and minimal punctuation : &quot; we recall being at the fox with campervb ( the band Camper Van_Beethoven ) ' cause i remember climbing to the top and looking down after everybody left we were drunk . the mats ( the Replacements ) too . they took_off their shirts after one song ' if i only had a brain ' and stole our cognac. &quot; &quot; I was in the studio , &quot; Stipe , 34 , recently recalled , &quot; and bored with being there . Someone suggested I try_out the computer . I was surprised that I really enjoyed ( the experience ) . &quot; Stipe isn ' t the only celebrity connecting with the masses on-line . Users can scroll through Hole singer Courtney Love ' s rantings against her father or send e-mail to the band members of Sonic Youth . The staff at &quot; Late Night With Conan O ' Brien &quot; occasionally uses the Internet to see what people think_about the show . The creator of the sci-fi TV series &quot; Babylon 5 &quot; spends hours each day chatting on the Infobahn . Such incidents are the first stages in a unique marriage between show_business and the public . The question is : Does the ' Net merely offer another kind of fan club -- albeit a high-tech one -- or has it forged a greater degree of intimacy between celebrities and fans ? Name a performer and chances are there ' s a newsgroup devoted to that person ' s private and professional_life . These are not the officially sanctioned on-line exchanges arranged with commercial services , such_as David Bowie popping onto America Online , Tom Petty on Prodigy or the Rolling Stones on Delphi . These are freewheeling conversations about or with celebrities . The commercial services offer their own version of a newsgroup . Often called a &quot; topic , &quot; &quot; folder &quot; or &quot; arena , &quot; they act_as in-house , local bulletin_boards for fans . True newsgroups , however , are found on Usenet , the world ' s largest distributed bulletin_board_system , which acts_as a &quot; store-and-forward &quot; network for sites both on and off the Internet . It ' s nearly impossible to pinpoint the number of people who have access to the Usenet , because the Internet is growing so rapidly and many people can share the same computer terminal . Still , Usenet followers estimate that about 10 million computers are on-line . Newsgroups have multi-part names separated by periods , such_as alt.fan.monty-python , a group devoted to the_British comedy troupe . Most groups that focus_on pop culture figures begin with the word rec for &quot; recreation &quot; or alt for &quot; alternate. &quot; A multitude of fan-oriented newsgroups exists , ranging from an anti-Barney faction ( alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die ) to Patrick Stewart groupies ( alt.sexy.bald.captains ) . Users tend to select a_few groups to read and ignore the rest . &quot; I view newsgroups like this : Do you know that in some places in America , there are 24-hour fishing channels ? &quot; said one subscriber to the G . Gordon Liddy newsgroup . &quot; You and I might stop to laugh for a second or two , and then move_on to other stations . &quot; The Liddy group is like that fishing channel . I just stop by to laugh , wonder about the people who post and scratch my head . But other people will stick_around to learn everything they can about Liddy. &quot; To a certain degree , newsgroups do function as fan clubs . Traditional fan clubs are organized and managed by agents , film studios and record companies . Yet most newsgroups are established by the fans themselves . &quot; You pick_up on everything , from album release dates to recent deaths to film deals , &quot; said Michael N . Hidalgo , 18 , a freshman at New York University ' s Tisch School of the Arts . &quot; I heard about dates for the last Guns N ' Roses tour , Stephen King ' s book-signing schedule for ' Insomnia ' and the title of the new R.E.M. album before it was out. &quot; Subscribers can exchange memorabilia and track_down rare footage of their favorite stars . A recent 15-minute scroll through Usenet uncovered such trivia as where to find a board_game based on the pop band Duran Duran and what asteroid was named after Frank Zappa ( answer : Zappafrank ) . &quot; If ( this medium ) was just a bunch of fan clubs , all you ' d be reading is ' I love you , can I have an autographed picture , can I come see the show , I hope you can come_to my town , I love it when you wear jeans , ' &quot; said late-night television host Conan O ' Brien , who follows on-line postings about his show via alt.fan.conan-obrien . &quot; With these groups , it ' s not just ' I love you ' or ' I hate you. ' You get a middle-ground buzz that you don ' t get_through the mail , like debates over why one skit worked and another didn ' t . &quot; And ( posting to a newsgroup ) is so_much easier than sitting_down and writing a letter . If you ' re into computers , you ' re already there. &quot; Subscribers say that compared to the clientele attracted to a typical fan club , newsgroups offer a highbrow alternative . Most of the people who read and post to the celebrity groups are not drooling , screaming pre-pubescents , said a subscriber who goes_by the handle &quot; dougr &quot; and declined to give his real name . &quot; But there is so_much that you can never learn from just listening to his music . It ' s only since I began alt.fan.frank-zappa that I ' ve learned Suzy Creamcheese was a real person ; the name Phydeaux was the name of Frank ' s tour bus ; that Frank was deeply involved in post-revolutionary Czechoslovakia . It ' s a treasure_hunt out there . Newsgroups mark where the treasure ' s buried. &quot; Newsgroups allow fans to chat about their favorite performers on a global level . &quot; A few years ago , I posted a message on rec.arts.startrek.current about ' Star Trek ' Christmas_carols , &quot; said a user named &quot; Burkert , &quot; who peruses 30 groups each day . &quot; I got a response from someone in England ( named ) Rob , asking me to update him on the show . I did , and we ' ve become the best of friends . And I have yet to hear his voice or meet him in person. &quot; Such anonymity plays a large part in the medium ' s appeal . &quot; I can be myself without any pretenses , &quot; said Christine Faltz , 25 , a recent law_school graduate in Brooklyn who subscribes_to 50 lists . &quot; It ' s easy to avoid issues you don ' t want to discuss , easy to pick and choose the people you think you might like to know . And it allows you to be frank , to disagree_with someone without the risk of a face-to-face rejection. &quot; Sometimes newsgroup participants elicit their own on-line following . In August , Faltz began posting a series of notes on alt.sex.fetish.startrek that depict graphic sexual scenarios between the characters of the TV_show &quot; Star Trek : The Next Generation. &quot; Faltz ' s postings -- titled &quot; Oh Captain , My Captain ! &quot; -- take_advantage of the uncensored atmosphere of the Internet and detail the characters engaging in hetero- and homosexual couplings , group situations , light bondage and , in one case , a rape . Publicists for several of the &quot; Star Trek &quot; actors said their clients were aware of &quot; Oh Captain , My Captain ! &quot; but cast members declined to comment . The electronic erotica project , now on its 21st installment , is more_than 250 pages long . &quot; I ' ve gotten an enormous response from people thanking me for making the characters realistic and writing a story that had an actual plot , as well as adding a sexual dimension to the characters , &quot; Faltz said . &quot; I ' ve even received requests for certain liaisons between and among different characters. &quot; W hile anonymity allows sub scribers a certain degree of creative freedom , it also can mask a celebrity ' s identity . After R.E.M. ' s Stipe began exploring AOL , on-line readers spent several days debating whether &quot; stipey &quot; was legitimate or an impostor . Stipe wrote an e-mail message on Aug . 1 to singer Love : &quot; ( A ) ll they really wanted to know was why I hate apostrophes and what are the complete lyrics to the upcoming ( yes it is titled monster ) lp . most of them wanted proof it was me. &quot; Other celebrities have started to explore this electronic frontier . Author Tom Clancy uses his AOL account to chat with the public . Similarly , members of the band Sonic Youth all have on-line access , thanks to AOL . The members of heavy-metal group Megadeth gab with fans through their own World Wide Web site . The Web , a collection of thousands of multimedia databases , is the fastest-growing service on the Internet . Unlike newsgroups , a Web site combines text with visuals , video snippets and sound clips . Guitarist Dave Ellefson and singer Dave Mustaine cruise through the on-line mythical town &quot; Megadeth , Ariz . . . . The Last Rest-Stop for Miles &quot; nearly every day to chat in the Megadiner , tune into the local radio_station K DETH 101 , roll into the Digital Drive-In , check_out their Horror Scope or add_to Ellefson ' s electronic tour diary , dubbed the Obituary . On-line cruisers can access Megadeth , Ariz. , at http : / / bazaar.com / ( the temporary site , which opened two months ago , will be pulled from the Internet on Dec . 31 ) . &quot; At first , no one believed that Megaman was really Dave Mustaine , &quot; said Charles Como , 30 , a Hollywood-based computer_programmer who established the fictional Arizona town for the band ' s label , Capitol Records . &quot; They ' d start asking him all these questions , like who did the solo for this or where was something recorded . They knew more about Megadeth than he did . Finally some kid asked ' What kind of car do you drive ? ' and he said , ' 300 SL , silver. ' There was this pause , then everyone went nuts . You could actually feel the adrenaline rushing through these kids. &quot; Performers sometimes try to hide their identity while on-line . Courtney Love , lead singer of Hole and widow of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain , spent last summer logging_on to both Usenet and AOL using either the handle CMLC ( her initials ) or BRRRKNSTOK . Yet she often signed her e-mail with her real name . Some of Love ' s postings , which were scattered throughout cyberspace , railed against her biological father , whom she condemned for going_on &quot; Geraldo &quot; to discuss Cobain even though he had never met the singer . She also talked_about herself -- &quot; my bad review in spin ( magazine ) , I DESERVED IT , I ' m not complaining I was a mess and we sucked &quot; -- and would-be authors eager to pen an unauthorized Nirvana biography . &quot; I just got caught_up in it , &quot; Love said about her on-line activity in a recent interview with Rolling Stone magazine . &quot; It was the void that you talk to . And since I didn ' t speak_to anybody else , I had to get_in trouble some way. &quot; A_few entertainment_industry figures are permanent fixtures on Usenet . J . Michael Straczynski , the creator-writer-executive producer of the TV series &quot; Babylon 5 , &quot; initially hooked up in 1984 . Now , he has accounts on seven on-line services , including GEnie and CompuServe , and he reads about 500 newsgroup postings a day . &quot; My task as a writer is to create my universe as completely as possible , &quot; said Straczynski , 40 , who spends at least two hours on-line each day . &quot; You need to keep asking new questions about the characters and their universe . When I see 500 messages a day , there are bound to be things I ' ve never even thought about. &quot; Straczynski thinks newsgroups empower the audience : &quot; How many people in Iowa have access to speak_to a television producer ? Zip . But now they have this access , and it makes them a part of the process . It lets them understand how television is made. &quot; B ut how many people in Iowa can chat with Straczynski ? Access to cyberspace is limited . The poor and uneducated are not represented . And since the bulk of the Usenet fan newsgroup postings are written in English , the system also excludes those who only read another language . In general , Usenet is populated by the technological and cognitive elite . Those plugging in fall_into one of three categories : computer professionals , undergraduate college_students or anyone else who is educated enough to understand the software and financially solvent enough to buy the hardware . &quot; It ' s not a true cross_section of American society , &quot; said Chris Carter , creator and executive_director for Fox ' s hit television_show &quot; The X-Files. &quot; Carter logs_on a private news-reader system once a week to scroll through folders dedicated to his show . &quot; You have to know what to do at the keyboard , &quot; said Carter , 38 . &quot; Not everyone can do that . Even our two stars ( actor David Duchovny and actress Gillian Anderson ) are computer-illiterate . They survey the mail occasionally , but that ' s it. &quot; Only rarely does the public connect directly to the stars . Most celebrities , like Stipe and Love , are curious tourists . Some , like Conan O ' Brien , rely_on their staff to read through both fan mail and the on-line postings . &quot; It ' s flattering , but there ' s a real danger of getting caught_up in reading that stuff , &quot; he said . &quot; It takes forever to get_through it all , and for my show there ' s the problem that you might tune everyone else out . Like ' OK , this sketch is for the guy in Baltimore who e-mailed me , this skit is for him. ' &quot; Notes occasionally do amuse O ' Brien and his staff . At one point , subscribers engaged in a debate over the underlying meaning behind Tomorry the Ostrich . This recurring &quot; Late Night &quot; character -- an 8-foot-tall bird -- is used to announce guests scheduled to appear in upcoming shows . &quot; People were reading all this stuff into the bird , &quot; O ' Brien said . &quot; They were saying , ' Maybe Conan ' s saying those guests are going_to lay an egg ' or ' I think the bird is Conan ' s representation of NBC and the hidden anger he has toward NBC. ' But we were just trying to be funny . &quot; Sometimes , an ostrich is just an ostrich. &quot; While the technology may be intriguing , Hollywood insiders like Carter of &quot; X-Files &quot; see Usenet newsgroups as nothing more_than an electronic fad : &quot; So_much of what is written reads like a party_line , with people yakking back and forth about minor things . Maybe I ' m being shortsighted , but I don ' t see the Internet revolutionizing Hollywood . It ' s great for marketing purposes , and a great way for fans to meet and occasionally stumble into a celebrity . &quot; But it doesn ' t affect my creative process . I think most people in Hollywood would agree with me. &quot; * * TRUTH IN E-MAILING You can ' t always believe what you read on the ' Net , as users and celebrities can attest . Page 101 .</TEXT>
