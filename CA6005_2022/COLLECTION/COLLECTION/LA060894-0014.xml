   <TEXT> French-American cultural relations , contrary to some reports , do not consist exclusively of French resistance to American popular culture . True , the much-publicized coolness of French critics had something to do with the poor performance of EuroDisney . And French trade negotiators insisted on protecting their fellow citizens from the U.S. films they love too well . But popular culture is not the whole of culture . In arts and sciences , France and the United States have had lively relations since Jefferson and Franklin were the toast of Paris . In this century , the &quot; Lost Generation &quot; of post-World War I American writers in Paris was followed by a post-World War II generation of only somewhat less famous writers -- James Jones , James Salter and others . Paris has played a particularly important role in providing a refuge and an intellectual reception for black American writers and musicians . From its founding in 1931 , the independent , non-governmental American Center in Paris has been a kind of clubhouse for American artists and writers living there and a magnet for Parisians interested in America . For the last seven years , the center has been closed while it built itself a new home . Tuesday , the new home opened -- a spectacular building designed by Los Angeles-based architect Frank O . Gehry and offering &quot; Pure Beauty : Some Recent Work From Los Angeles &quot; as its inaugural show . ( The art_exhibition will open in Los Angeles Sept . 25. ) The warm reception Parisian critics have accorded the new center comes as a double reminder . First , culture and entertainment , though they overlap , are not quite the same thing , and the_French reaction to American entertainment does not predict , either way , the_French reaction to American culture . Second , though Los Angeles may rightly aspire to be the capital of the Pacific Rim , American institutions are obviously of European -- and in important regards of French -- descent , and the old ties still bind . On a globe , no point can claim centrality . Is Los Angeles -- eight time_zones east of Beijing and nine west of Paris -- central or twice peripheral ? Whatever the answer , the American Center in Paris , celebrating Los Angeles as it reopens , deserves an appreciative look_back . The City of the Angels may have much to learn , even at this late date , from the City_of_Light .</TEXT>
