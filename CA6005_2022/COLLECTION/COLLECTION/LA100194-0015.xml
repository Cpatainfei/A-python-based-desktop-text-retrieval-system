   <HEADLINE> ASIA ; ' BANNED ' BOOK RAISES EYEBROWS AMONG CHINESE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the most talked-about books in the Chinese capital is a thin , provocative paperback titled &quot; Viewing China Through a Third Eye. &quot; The book is an alarmist vision of the future that warns of a looming &quot; catastrophe &quot; if peasants continue to flee the countryside by the millions for the cities . Praised in private by many Chinese leaders , reportedly including President Jiang Zemin , the book was nonetheless banned from government bookstores last month by the propaganda department of the Communist_Party . Despite the ban , sales have been brisk , particularly for a work of political analysis , in private bookstores . Li Shiqiang , owner of Beijing ' s Sanwei ( Three Flavors ) Bookstore , a haven for intellectuals since it opened in 1988 , said he quickly sold_out his 200 copies . Liang Heping , a composer and jazz keyboardist , said he shared his copy with dozens of friends . Adding_to the interest is the uncertainty of the identity of the book ' s author . It was first published in March by Shanxi Province People ' s Publishing_House under the pseudonym &quot; Leininger. &quot; The author was identified as &quot; the most influential China expert in contemporary Europe. &quot; But few took the foreign authorship seriously . &quot; The understanding of China and the Chinese language is too good , &quot; musician Liang said . &quot; I think they used a foreign name to attract attention and give the book an air of objectivity. &quot; Under pressure from journalists , the publisher said the author was , in fact , Wang Shan -- named as the book ' s translator . But that also happens to be the Chinese equivalent of &quot; John Doe. &quot; Because of the book ' s pessimistic view of economic reforms , attention focused_on controversial economist He Xin as the possible author . He , who works for a state-sponsored think_tank , became a controversial figure among intellectuals in 1989 when he defended the army crackdown on the pro-democracy movement . He said the action , in which hundreds of Chinese were killed , was necessary to maintain order and prevent China from slipping into chaos . But in an interview , he denied writing the book . &quot; Back in 1988 I already wrote something similar to that , &quot; He huffed . The main contention of &quot; Viewing China Through a Third_Eye &quot; is that economic liberalization ushered into China by Communist_Party leader Deng Xiaoping has broken the traditional links of the peasantry to the land . Pointing to China ' s huge floating population -- as_many as 100 million who have left the rural interior to seek their fortune in the cities -- the author sees parallels with the decline and fall of Chinese dynasties : &quot; Open the Chinese history books and we will be reminded of an obvious fact ; every dynasty , without exception , was destroyed by roving masses . The roving masses are peasants who have lost their land or who are not satisfied staying_on the land. &quot; By opening_up the economy and allowing peasants to travel_to seek jobs , Deng and his supporters have &quot; let the_devil out of the bottle. &quot; Such thoughts are not uncommon , particularly in hard-line factions of the Communist_Party that see little good in Deng ' s economic reforms . But no target is spared in the book , including the world ' s last great Communist system : &quot; The Chinese Communist_Party has made a lot of serious mistakes after it came_into power . But the most serious mistake is that it covered_up the reality of the impoverished countryside and starving peasants . The result is that the Communist_Party lost the opportunity to gain sympathy , understanding and help from international society. &quot; The mixed reactions the book provoked in the Communist_Party proved that it touched a nerve . Just how seriously the book was received was apparent when , despite the ban , celebrated author Wang Meng wrote a critique for the journal Readings . Wang , one of China ' s most famous living authors who resigned his post as minister of culture in 1989 after the Tian An Men Square crackdown , praised parts of the book but attacked the dismissal of economic reforms . In his most ironic line , Wang noted that the hard-line policies advocated by the author probably would have prohibited the book ' s publication . So Whodunit ? A mystery has surfaced over who wrote the brisk-selling political analysis on China . Excerpts From the Book &quot; Chinese intellectuals first didn ' t have the right to think independently . Then they were given the right but had lost the ability to think on_their_own . that ' s why today they either believe totally in the state or totally believe what they hear on Voice of America. &quot; &quot; To develop the economy , maintaining order is most important . To maintain order , autocracy is the appropriate way. &quot; &quot; If the state could maintain a 30-year program of coercion and education , then the mistakes and vice committed by the dictatorship would be forgiven. &quot; Source : Times Beijing Bureau</TEXT>
