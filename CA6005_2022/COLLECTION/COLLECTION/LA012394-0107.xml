   <HEADLINE> SWITZERLAND SCORES TWO GOALS , ONE FOR UNITED STATES IN 1-1 TIE ; SOCCER : OWN GOAL OFF DEFENDER EGLI IN 88TH MINUTE BRINGS AMERICANS TO EVEN AT FULLERTON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Much was known but little was revealed Saturday , when the U.S. national soccer team tied the national team of Switzerland , 1-1 . Despite soccer ' s taboo against meeting a World Cup opponent before the tournament , the two Group_A teams played before a capacity crowd of 10 # 173 at Cal State Fullerton . The players will probably be different when they meet again , in their first World Cup match on June 18 at the Pontiac Silverdome , so that all but defused concerns about the game revealing too_much tactical information about either team . Key players for both teams are still with their European clubs and , with each coach making five substitutions on Saturday , little can be gleaned from player assignments . &quot; This game has no connection whatsoever with the game in June , &quot; Swiss Coach Roy Hodgson said . &quot; The American team we will see in June will be totally different. &quot; The U.S. team played tentatively in the first_half , giving the_Swiss space . As the warm day took its toll on the_Swiss , the United States attacked in the second_half for the first time . Still , the Americans could not finish the few quality chances afforded them by a solid Swiss back line . They tied the score when Cobi Jones chipped a cross into the penalty area , in the general direction of teammate Alexi Lalas , who was tangling_with Swiss defender Andre Egli . The shot went_off Egli ' s head into the goal . Egli accepted responsibility for the goal with grace . Play professional soccer for 16 years , he said , and you will probably score an own goal . &quot; I intended to hit the ball into the corner , &quot; he said . &quot; But it went_into the net . Lalas was pushing me from behind , but it was correctly done . Lalas is a very competitive guy . He likes to work with his arms and elbows . But it was correct . Clean. &quot; Play was rugged , with four yellow cards . U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel watched the shoving and pushing with bemusement . &quot; They play in an English style , &quot; he said , referring more to the_Swiss ' feisty approach than style . &quot; They were going_for a tackle , and they ' d give you a stud ( spike ) . And it ' s just friendly . It was like the first round of a boxing match. &quot; With the lineup changes , little rhythm was established in the first_half . Jones started on the right side but was switched to the left . Lalas was moved to central defender , and Desmond Armstrong was moved to the right . Coach Bora Milutinovic got another look_at Claudio Reyna and Dario Brose . The second_half was more lively , especially after the_Swiss goal spurred the United States to take chances . The goal was set_up by a shot from Switzerland ' s Nestor Subiat . That was blocked by Friedel , but the rebound was kicked_in by Sebastien Fournier in the 65th minute . The U.S. goal came_in the 88th minute . But what was learned ? The United States got a good look_at a counterattacking team that is opportunistic and dangerous . The Swiss saw a team that was fit and learning to organize itself more consistently . &quot; They ( the_Swiss ) react well to changing situations , &quot; U.S. assistant Timo Liekoski said . &quot; When they get the ball , they love to play it forward quickly. &quot; Tying the_Swiss , Lalas said , &quot; shows we can hang. &quot;</TEXT>
