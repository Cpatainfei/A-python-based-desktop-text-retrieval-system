   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; NORWEGIANS ONLY GET LOUDER , KOSS ONLY GETS FASTER IN 1 # 500</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To Vegard the Viking , add Koss the Boss . Norwegian speedskater Johann Olav Koss , who set a world_record in winning the men ' s 5 # 000-meter event Sunday , did_it again Wednesday in the 1 # 500 at the Viking ship indoor rink . On Norway ' s sports-hero list , that put him up there with cross-country skier Vegard Ulvang . Koss was only the peoples ' choice , not the experts ' . The favorites were Rintje Ritsma and Falko Zandstra of the_Netherlands . Ritsma had skated the 1 # 500 on the same rink Jan . 9 in world-record time , 1 minute 51.60 seconds , and Zandstra is the World Cup leader at the distance . But before a frenzied crowd of nearly 12 # 000 fans , some with Norwegian flags painted on their faces , many of them waving real Norwegian flags , most of them screaming , Koss , skating in the second pair , set the standard . Making_up for an average start with a blistering third lap of 28.85 seconds , then a strong last lap of 29.38 , Koss finished in 1:51.29 to a deafening ovation . No one else could match his kick -- Ritsma was gasping at the end and was second in 1:51.99. Zandstra was third in 1:52.38 and Norway ' s Adne Sondral fourth in 1:53.13. &quot; The last two laps made the difference , but I didn ' t think this could happen , &quot; Koss said . &quot; What a great feeling to have the crowd behind me like this. &quot;</TEXT>
