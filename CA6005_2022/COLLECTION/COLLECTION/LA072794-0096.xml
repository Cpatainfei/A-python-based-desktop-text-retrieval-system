   <HEADLINE> TALKS IN TRANSIT STRIKE RESUME ; OFFICIALS WARY ; LABOR : SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MECHANICS , MTA MAY PROLONG WALKOUT . CONGESTION ON FREEWAYS WORSENS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Striking mechanics and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority resumed talks Tuesday evening as Los Angeles County commuters slowly made their way through town on the second day of a transit walkout that seemed destined to drag_on for several more days . Congestion worsened on the freeways as more commuters abandoned any hope of hailing a bus and flocked to cars . With less than 20 % of MTA buses on_the_road , the small number of riders who braved the buses found tight seating , long delays -- and in some cases no bus at all , due_to foul-ups in scheduling . While leaders of the mechanics union and MTA negotiators agreed to meet , officials were cautious about prospects for a quick settlement , aware of sharp differences between management and labor . &quot; We hope we can make some progress , &quot; said County Supervisor Ed Edelman , MTA board chairman . &quot; We are still far apart. &quot; About 1 # 900 mechanics walked_off the job Sunday morning after they were unable to reach agreement on a new contract . About 5 # 000 bus and train drivers and clerks , whose unions had reached last-minute tentative agreements Sunday , walked_out in support , crippling a system that serves more_than 500 # 000 riders a day . On Day 2 of Los Angeles ' first bus strike in 12 years : * Traffic on surface streets remained at its usual levels , but congestion increased on Los Angeles area freeways . The average commute was increased by about 15 minutes and rush_hour lasted about 30 minutes longer than usual , Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said . Metrolink commuter_trains carried an estimated 20 % more passengers , but ridership on the Blue Line trolley and the Red_Line subway decreased . * Only 318 buses out of the normal 1 # 900 were in_service . The MTA said it was providing service on its 30 busiest routes , but failed to tell riders that in many cases the buses were serving only portions of the line , leaving some would-be passengers stranded . The busiest lines were the No . 21 , which runs_along Wilshire Boulevard , and the No . 30 / 31 on Pico Boulevard , MTA spokeswoman Andrea Greene said . The agency has no plans to reshape its deployment of buses during the strike this week . * MTA officials planned to launch a new commuter phone_service because a transit hot_line was unable to handle the flood of calls . Of an estimated 15 # 000 calls received Monday by ( 800 ) COMMUTE , only 6 # 000 were answered , Greene said . The rest of the callers hung_up after being put_on hold for extended periods_of_time , and the hot_line went_out of service for 45 minutes Monday . The new phone_service , scheduled to begin later this week , will provide recorded information . * MTA supervisors drove 130 of the 318 buses on_the_road Tuesday . They had taken a refresher_course in the weeks before the strike . The rest of the fleet was composed of private_school buses , contracted by the MTA . Negotiations are under way with private companies to expand bus_service should the strike extend beyond this week . The agency has received more_than 1 # 700 applications in response to advertisements placed three weeks ago for temporary strike-related jobs . In two weeks , the agency expects to put 50 more drivers on the street if the strike persists . * Transit officials tripled security patrols of the buses and bus_stops after an attempted hijacking of a bus by three irate strikers was thwarted on Monday . In the only reported act of vandalism , a non-striking driver suffered a minor injury when a rock shattered his windshield . * In the public relations war , the MTA resumed newspaper and radio ads accusing the mechanics of holding the city hostage , but said it would suspend the ads once negotiations began . The ad_campaign so far has cost taxpayers $ 198 # 632 . The Politics of the Strike Tuesday night ' s negotiating session -- the first since talks broke_down Sunday -- was set_up by a phone_call from Jim Wood , secretary-treasurer of the County Federation of Labor , to Edelman , a longtime ally of labor . It was attended by a state mediator . In the delicate negotiations between the transit agency and the unions , the path to a settlement is obstructed by layers of politics on both sides . The key issue in the dispute -- even among the MTA ' s own board_members -- is the subcontracting of work now performed by union mechanics to non-union private companies that pay lower wages . The controversy stems from differing philosophies : Promoted at the national level by then-President Ronald Reagan , &quot; contracting_out &quot; of government services is a longtime Republican cost-cutting staple that has also gained support from budget-conscious Democrats . Union leaders , on the other hand , see contracting as a threat to their survival ; they contend that it lowers the number of higher-paying union jobs , threatens their members ' job security and depresses wages for all workers . In the auto industry , for example , a key contract stumbling_block in recent years has been demands by the nation ' s major auto_makers to buy many car parts from cheaper , non-union suppliers . Contracting has been a hot political issue in transportation in Los Angeles since 1988 , when the now-defunct Los Angeles County Transportation Commission turned_over bus_lines previously operated by the old Southern California Rapid_Transit District to Foothill Transit . Foothill , which pays far lower wages to its drivers , has asked the MTA to let it take_over another 12 lines now operated by MTA , promising $ 10 million in savings . The push for contracting gained momentum with the election of Mayor Richard Riordan , a Republican who has championed privatization , to replace Tom Bradley , a pro-union Democrat . Riordan is a member of the MTA board and appoints three other members . Even Edelman and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , both Democrats , said that contracting must be considered in the current economic climate . &quot; If we can provide better quality service and less costly service , and not jeopardize any jobs and it ' s served the public ' s interest , why should we be precluded from considering ( contracting ) ? &quot; Yaroslavsky said . Wood of the County Federation of Labor called efforts by MTA board_members to contract_out work &quot; an excuse to attempt to move work_out of the public sector and move it to their friends in the private sector. &quot; So entrenched is the dispute that both sides have argued their point with a common symbol : the dustpan . In citing the cost savings of contracting , transit officials have repeatedly said it only costs $ 9 at a neighborhood store to buy a dustpan that costs the union mechanics $ 25 to build . Wood answers : &quot; We can show you dustpans we made 30 years ago that are still in_service . This is the kind of disinformation that management puts_out to try to belittle what we do. &quot; He said the cheaper dustpans may have been made abroad by workers paid sub-minimum wage . Mike Bujosa , president of the local chapter of the Amalgamated Transit Union , representing 1 # 900 mechanics whose top hourly wage is $ 20.83 , called subcontracting the major issue separating the union and the transit agency . &quot; that ' s where we are miles apart , &quot; he said . However , there are several other issues that may be hardening Bujosa ' s position , insiders say . One occurred July 16 when , with negotiations under way , the MTA laid_off 83 mechanics -- a fact that has caused union_members to question the MTA ' s pledge that no mechanics will lose jobs because of subcontracting . MTA officials justified the timing of the layoffs by saying they are under_fire and face a $ 300-million shortfall as a result of a recession-triggered decline in sales tax_revenue . The layoffs of union and non-union employees had &quot; nothing to do with labor negotiations ; it had to do with cost reduction , &quot; MTA spokeswoman Greene said . However , one source close to the negotiations said the layoff of mechanics was the primary reason the strike occurred . &quot; That really was the dynamic that put them in the position where they almost literally couldn ' t justify doing otherwise , &quot; the source said . Bujosa , chapter president for the last three years , will be up for reelection this November , and needed to take a tough stand_in response to the layoffs in_order to win another term , some sources say . Bujosa disagreed . &quot; It ' s good to come_up with a good contract , let ' s face it . But even if I ' m not elected , I want to come_back to a good job , &quot; he said . On the Street With varying degrees of success , MTA officials tried to diminish the snafus Tuesday from their makeshift bus operations . But glitches abounded . Many passengers unaware of the new strike fare of 50 cents on MTA buses , deposited the customary $ 1.10. On the No . 21 Wilshire Boulevard line , four buses converged at one bus_stop during the morning rush_hour . Elsewhere the problem was the dearth of buses . The No . 16 line that normally links Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center at 3rd Street and San Vicente Boulevard near Beverly Hills with Downtown was supposed to be up and running_on Tuesday . In fact , service on the line was limited to the one-third of the route nearest to Downtown . Luisa Abeniante was one of the unlucky eastbound riders counting_on a ride from a stop near the beginning of the usual route . A co-worker at the Medical_Center of North Hollywood , where she is a nurse ' s assistant , had dropped her off at the 3rd Street and La Cienega Boulevard stop at 8 a.m. after she had worked all night and was trying to get_to her home near Downtown . After an hour , with no bus in_sight , she began to get frustrated . &quot; By this time I ' m already home and I could do some things and sleep a little bit more , &quot; she said . The ride to work had taken her three hours and had made_it a long day . She ended_up walking until she found a bus . Aboard another Line 16 bus later in the morning , a light crowd of riders were politely thanking the substitute driver , admiring the cleanliness of the bus and appreciating the MTA ' s no-fare policy on the school_buses . At 5th and Main_streets , a group of picketers yelled , &quot; Scab ! Scab ! Scab ! &quot; at the driver as he passed . A few blocks later , a picketer yelled , &quot; Don ' t take that bus ! Get_off it or you ' re going to get killed ! &quot; Later , the driver , who declined to give his name , said the picketers bothered him and made him fearful . But , he said , the aggravation is only temporary . Across the city , others found ways to cope_with the strike . Officials at EZ Sportswear , a Chatsworth garment manufacturer , started worrying about the bus strike last week . About one-third of the company ' s 225 employees ride the bus . &quot; We had to figure_out how to get people to work , &quot; said Terry Miller , director of human resources . &quot; So we arranged for employees with cars to bring the other people . We had people late , but we haven ' t had any absences. &quot; At Handy J Carwash in Sherman Oaks , owner Joel Gassman said the strike cut his work_force by more_than half on Monday , with 14 workers absent from a crew of 24 . &quot; It ' s making things very difficult , &quot; he said . At the McDonald ' s at Crenshaw Avenue and 71st Street , one-fifth of the work crew has been missing for the past two days . Owner Andrea Bailey hurried past . How was the strike affecting business ? She threw_up her hands . &quot; Horrible ! Horrible ! &quot; she said , rushing behind the counter . Times staff writers Richard Lee Colvin , Nicholas Riccardi and Sam Enriquez contributed to this story .
