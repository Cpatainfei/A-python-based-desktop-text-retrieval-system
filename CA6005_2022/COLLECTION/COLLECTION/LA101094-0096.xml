   <TEXT> Sixty-one guardians of a time_capsule dedicated Sunday in front of the Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks headed straight for the refreshments as soon as the speeches ended . Iced fruit_punch and cookies awaited hundreds of people attending the outdoor ceremony as Mayor Alex Fiore dedicated the capsule that will be opened in 20 years , on the 50th anniversary of the city ' s incorporation . &quot; It ' s hot , &quot; said Ashlee Knight , a 10-year-old Girl_Scout who pledged to return in two decades to oversee the capsule ' s opening . Temperatures reached_into the 90s under cloudless skies as residents deposited dozens of items that reflect life in Thousand Oaks in 1994 . A program from the inaugural season of the Civic Arts Plaza , a local telephone_book , a videotaped City_Council meeting and dozens of other items will remain locked inside a sturdy plastic tube placed within a concrete bench along the wall of the newly opened performing arts center . In 20 years , the 61 mostly 10-year-olds will reassemble to open that time_capsule and begin another . The ceremony will be repeated on the occasions of the city ' s 75th and 100th birthdays , scheduled for the years 2039 and 2064 . &quot; I will not be serving on the City_Council when it comes time to open these , &quot; the mayor joked in his opening remarks . The time_capsule celebration Sunday was a prelude to the city ' s formal 30th birthday_party , a black-tie event to follow the Oct . 21 grand opening of the Civic Arts Plaza . Thousand Oaks artist Denise Filz designed the gray concrete bench that will hold the time_capsule as well as the 200-pound brass oak_tree hanging above it . She spent months bringing the idea to fruition . &quot; I wanted ( the bench ) to be something that could be used and be visible , &quot; she said . &quot; Something for the kids to climb_on . &quot; And we wanted something that would reflect the roots of our lives , &quot; Filz added . &quot; Hopefully , enough of the guardians will come_back in 20 years when they hand_down the new guardianship. &quot; Rob O ' Neill , co-chair of the committee that organized the time_capsule campaign , added_to the tube a letter to the young people who will be_on hand when it is opened in two decades . &quot; In it I tell them not to be disillusioned , &quot; O ' Neill said . &quot; You can take a voice and make a difference in your community. &quot; O ' Neill called the time_capsule a portrait of the city , and predicted that in 20 years the Civic Arts Plaza would still be a state-of-the-art facility . &quot; We ' re really still in our youth &quot; as a city , O ' Neill said . &quot; To blossom and grow_into an antique is really a wonderful thing. &quot; The committee co-chair also took a moment to relish the accomplishments of those who worked for years to open the arts plaza . &quot; It ' s been a long , hard struggle , &quot; he said . &quot; We didn ' t know that we could ever get_to this day. &quot; Ten-year-old Christina Ballas said it was an honor to be selected as a guardian of the time_capsule . She and five dozen other children submitted predictions for the future . &quot; It ' ll be neat for our kids or somebody else ' s in 20 years when they open it , &quot; said Christina , a member of Girl_Scout Troop 646 . &quot; I ' ll probably be gone , &quot; said Julie Zelman , another 10-year-old Girl_Scout selected as a guardian . &quot; But I ' ll remember to come back. &quot; Westlake real_estate_agent Patty Woodard was one of more_than 100 people to sign the six-foot plastic tube . &quot; They said to just put our names on there to leave room for everyone else , &quot; Woodard said after writing_on the capsule with a thick felt-tip marker . Woodard said she has looked_forward to the Civic Arts Plaza opening since she first heard it was planned . &quot; It ' s a much-needed facility , &quot; Woodard said . &quot; It ' s something that will really add_to the community and bring some culture to the Conejo Valley. &quot; Millie Sanabria , whose 10-year-old daughter , Vanessa , was among the 61 guardians , said the time_capsule would become part of the city ' s history . &quot; If I ' m around in 20 years , I will be here to see what ' s changed , &quot; said Sanabria , an insurance_agent who lives_in Thousand Oaks . &quot; But my daughter will definitely be here. &quot; For her part , Vanessa said she wasn ' t sure what she would be doing or where she would be living come 2014 . &quot; I ' ll probably be working , get_married and have a child , &quot; she said . &quot; But I ' ll be here , even if I live_in Florida. &quot;</TEXT>
