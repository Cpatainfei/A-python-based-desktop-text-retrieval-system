   <HEADLINE> FOUR ORDINARY MEN REMEMBER WHEN THE WORLD HELD ITS BREATH ; WORLD_WAR_II : FIFTY YEARS AFTER D-DAY , VETERANS -- AMERICAN , GERMAN AND JAPANESE -- RECALL A DESPERATE TIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In June , wildflowers invade the Illinois prairie . Rose bushes explode in red along the Rhine . In Tokyo , in an old_man ' s garden , plums drop from their branches , a sweet springtime barrage . June brings memories too . Of another spring , when the world stood_still , held its breath . Of a gray morning -- just yesterday ? -- when an untested American lieutenant splashed ashore in France to fight for a continent , and a teen-age German corporal leaped into his boots to meet him . Of a day -- can it be 50 years ? -- when a hard young Marine called &quot; Smiley &quot; hit the beach on an island called Saipan , and a green young sergeant from Kyoto leveled his gun sights to stop him . Four men ' s lives , four memories intersecting on the battlefields of man ' s greatest_war , a struggle that left up_to 60 million dead , a clash of arms that shaped today ' s world . Theirs are only four stories among hundreds of millions of people swept_up in that global tide . But they can tell us much about how it was , about the evil men can do . They can tell us , too , about peace , about twists of history that make friends from enemies , make partners , allies , customers . Even future husbands for future daughters . * Nauvoo was where Lyle Scheetz went_for a good time , a town wedged between the Mississippi mud and a green ocean of Illinois corn . It was 1941 , and farm_boy &quot; Smiley &quot; Scheetz , 6 feet tall and all-American handsome , was a year out of high_school . The Depression was still on , the Scheetzes barely scraped_by , but all you needed was a dollar for a Saturday night -- a tenderloin sandwich and chocolate milkshake at Rouse ' s , maybe a hand of cards , and jitterbugging at the parish-hall dance . And then , one Sunday afternoon , the music stopped . Out for a drive with Virginia , his best girl , Lyle heard it on the radio : Japanese planes had bombed Hawaii . Like the rest of America , Lyle Scheetz was unprepared for war . But the Japanese made_up everyone ' s mind for them . &quot; I felt I ' d have to go. &quot; He rode up_to Peoria in June of ' 42 to enlist in the Air Corps . They didn ' t like the look of his tonsils . Downhearted , Lyle stepped outside . Across the street stood another recruiting station , a big poster in the window : &quot; Join the Marines and See the World. &quot; * By spring of ' 42 , the troublesome student from Kyoto prefecture was pushing his luck at Tokyo ' s National School of Foreign Languages . Military_training was compulsory , but Takeo Yamauchi was skipping the classes . In Kameoka , his hometown , Takeo played soldier like the other boys . But through his teen-age years , swayed by a free-thinking older brother , he grew uneasy about Japan ' s militarism and the war against China . By the time he left high_school , he was &quot; half-socialist , half-emperor worshiper. &quot; And when Japan attacked Pearl_Harbor , uneasiness turned_to despair . Takeo had read about U.S. industrial power . &quot; I knew we would lose. &quot; And yet , after being drafted into the Imperial Army , 21-year-old Takeo Yamauchi , bespectacled , scholarly , confused , allowed himself to be whipped into shape as a disciplined soldier of the emperor . Perhaps he was trying to please his shopkeeper father , the father who would one day erect a tombstone for his soldier son . * &quot; Miller , Joseph E. &quot; was a veteran by the time the bombs fell . His turn had come one Tuesday night in February ' 41 , when Capt . Grimaldi stood before the National_Guard unit in West Haven , Conn. , with &quot; good news. &quot; &quot; You ' re all going_to be inducted in the U.S. Army. &quot; Joe , a 22-year-old toolmaker and Tuesday night sergeant , could handle it . He ' d grown_up rough and ready , one of five kids of a poor young widow . He hadn ' t gone beyond high_school . Maybe the military would be good for him that way . But it meant leaving his bride of three months . At first , Jeannette followed him to the training camps down South . They talked_about the future , about kids . &quot; We were so in love. &quot; Then he shipped out , and she was left to wait , and pray , and someday read in the paper about the hero from West Haven . * Egon Nuess ' mother would n ' t hear of it . He was just 16 . His 37-year-old father , a reluctant draftee , was already fighting in Hitler ' s army on the Russian front . She would n ' t let her boy enlist . Never . In Roebel , his north German village , young Egon had been a member of the Hitler Youth , like all_the boys . Then local Nazis tried to enroll the bright youngster in their elite academy . But his grandfather , an old farm_worker and leftist , said no . Still , the Nazis impressed Egon . In his isolated world , the &quot; People ' s Radio &quot; was all-important : the Hitler speeches , the martial_music . &quot; Today Germany belongs_to us , &quot; they sang . &quot; Tomorrow the world. &quot; There were no Jews around Roebel , but Egon believed the radio when it said Jews were exploiting good Germans . He was so proud , at 13 , when his great nation went_to_war . And too proud , at 16 , to listen to his mother . On Oct . 20 , 1942 , Egon Nuess volunteered for Hitler ' s armies . Within months , the father was dead in the east , and the son was headed west , to France . June 6 , 1944 Utah Beach , Normandy Joe Miller , first_lieutenant , 4th Infantry Division , had trained three years for this day -- Officer Candidate School , amphibious training , Raider courses . He could handle anything . But his anti-tank platoon couldn ' t handle seasickness . After two days aboard a landing_craft in the_English Channel , they were begging for an enemy shore . At 9:20 a.m. on D-day , Miller and the 12th Infantry Regiment bore in , third wave to hit Utah Beach in history ' s greatest amphibious invasion . First off when the ramp dropped was a three-man Jeep . It nosed straight to the bottom -- in 15 feet of water . &quot; Get the hell in closer ! &quot; the Yank lieutenant screamed at the_British boatmaster . German artillery_fire crashed around them . A U.S. ammunition barge exploded on their right . But Miller ' s men got their shaky legs down in France , on a beach where American dead still lay from the first wave . Under mortar and sniper fire , they towed their 57 mm anti-tank guns inland and dug_in . It was bloody going -- a half-dozen wounded in a 30-man platoon . And the frightening German artillery barrages made the sleepless night hell . Some of Miller ' s green GIs sobbed in their foxholes . &quot; I almost cracked myself , &quot; he recalls . &quot; I decided , no way was I going_to live through this war . But I thought , if you ' re going to go , at least take a_few of them with you. &quot; * The siren wailed at 1 a.m. , jolting Egon Nuess into action . In D-day ' s earliest hours , American paratroopers were dropping onto Normandy ' s pastures . Nuess ' 9th Parachute Regiment , 150 miles to the west , was soon on_the_move , by foot and truck , through the pre-dawn darkness , toward the war . The 18-year-old lance_corporal , trained by elite paratroopers , was unafraid . But even the veterans couldn ' t foresee the cruel conflict about to engulf them . On the road into Normandy , they came under nerve-shattering fire from Allied planes . Some of Nuess ' comrades curled_up in terror . &quot; They cried_for their mamas , &quot; he recalls . &quot; They were all 17 or 18 years old. &quot; In the towns , they trudged beneath bodies of Frenchmen hanging from telephone_poles , Resistance fighters strung_up by the German SS . Nuess shuddered . The grim gray German columns pushed_on . Finally , his anti-tank company plunged into battle along Normandy ' s St . Lo-Bayeux road , against an American armored assault . And in days and weeks of close-quarter fighting , Frau Nuess ' boy became a combat veteran , setting_up behind thick hedgerows , covering anti-tank teams as they fired their rocket-propelled grenades , watching American Sherman tanks explode in flame , watching his countrymen fall . And slowly pulling_back . Near St . Lo , they took a stand at a farmhouse . A grenade blast blew down a wall , killed two comrades and buried Nuess , deafening his right ear . They pulled him out , stood him up . The retreat resumed . Hitler ' s &quot; Fortress Europe &quot; was being surrendered foot by foot , soldier by dead soldier . * Miller ' s 4th Division first swung west to capture Cherbourg , then southeast to spearhead the St . Lo offensive , the &quot; breakout &quot; from the deadly hedgerow country . Leveled towns , broken bodies of Germans and Americans , bloated carcasses of cows and horses -- Miller grew hardened to the Norman landscape . And the fighting grew ever more vicious , with little quarter given . One day , an American tank sergeant machine-gunned six of Miller ' s German prisoners as they sat eating K-rations . &quot; Sons of bitches knocked_out one of my tanks ! Burned my men to a crisp ! &quot; he screamed . The lieutenant knew it was wrong . He took names . But &quot; the same thing happened , I ' m sure , against Americans. &quot; At Mortain , German Panzer divisions counterattacked , and Miller and his gunners helped hold_the_line . The Germans pulled_back . But American losses mounted . One night a German plane dropped a flare directly over one of Miller ' s gun positions . Bombs followed , killing all nine men in the squad . &quot; Sgt . Cartwright . A hell of a good soldier . What a mess. &quot; In the mornings , in his wet foxholes , his filthy fatigues , the lieutenant would roll_over , look_up , see American B-24s on their way to bomb Berlin . &quot; I ' d say , come_on , God bless you , get this war over with. &quot; But for Joe Miller , it had just begun . June 15 , 1944 Beach Red , Saipan Breakfast came early on the landing ship that day , 12:45 a.m. But it was good -- steak and eggs . &quot; New Zealand breakfast , &quot; Lyle Scheetz called it . The Marine corporal had learned to appreciate a decent meal . The 2nd Marine Division liked the Illinois farmer ' s size . They made him a machine-gunner . After training in California and New Zealand , he was shipped to Guadalcanal in late 1942 , for some on-the-job training in hell . In the Japanese army ' s dying weeks on the ' Canal , Scheetz learned that the enemy attacked bravely , even suicidally . He also learned that they were not a Marine ' s only problem : On Guadalcanal ' s remote front_lines , he went from a solid 198 pounds to 147 on one C-ration meal a day . But 76 hours on &quot; Bloody Tarawa , &quot; 10 months later , was still worse . The landing boats couldn ' t clear the reef on that Pacific atoll , so squad leader Scheetz and his men had to wade 600 yards through murderous Japanese fire to the beach . Philips was the first he lost , shot through the head . Then Brown and Bright . Then the fellow from Texas and the one from Colorado . Tarawa was taken , but his I Company had more_than 50 % casualties . The stench of Japanese and American dead reached pilots flying overhead . Now it was Saipan , his third campaign , a key stepping stone to Japan . And Scheetz ' s 6th Marine Regiment soon was aboard a flotilla of amphibious tractors , headed for a beach code-named &quot; Red. &quot; H-Hour was 8 a.m. * In a trench 300 yards in from Beach Red , in a moonscape of craters left by U.S. battleship barrages , Sgt . Takeo Yamauchi waited . He had reached the Japanese colony just a month earlier with the 136th Infantry Regiment , sent to help make the island an &quot; invulnerable bastion. &quot; Saipan ' s defenders knew they were next on the Americans ' list . But Yamauchi , fresh from training in the homeland , wasn ' t prepared_for what he saw on June 13 , a vast U.S. fleet assembling far offshore in the morning sun -- a &quot; city at_sea , &quot; he recalls . He couldn ' t stand_up ; his legs grew weak . Precisely at noon , the naval_guns opened_up . Yamauchi and his 13-man squad clung to the bottom of their trenches , terrified by the deafening blasts , choked with earth , but surviving . Then , on the morning of June 15 , a shout went_up , and Yamauchi looked_out . The Americans were coming . * The amphibious tractors clambered over the reefs and chugged in toward shore . They were under_fire -- but , thank God , not like Tarawa , Scheetz thought . The Marines scrambled out of the vehicles , regrouped , began moving across the narrow beach . Then , Scheetz remembers , &quot; they hit us with everything they had. &quot; * For a while , Yamauchi did give them everything he had . His squad opened_up with their bolt-action rifles and light machine_gun . Yamauchi believes he shot at least one Marine dead . But by midafternoon the landing force wiped_out the forward Japanese positions and were within 100 yards of Yamauchi ' s trench . that ' s when a battalion officer ordered him to charge . It was lunacy , Yamauchi knew , but he had no choice . He shouted , &quot; Let ' s go ! &quot; and leaped_out of the trench . Almost instantly he dropped_behind some rocks , under withering Marine machine-gun fire . He looked left and right : Only two of his men had followed him , and one lay dead . Bleeding from a graze wound on his neck , Yamauchi scrambled back to his squad . &quot; Too many bullets , too many bullets , &quot; they said . That night , Yamauchi ' s entire regiment counterattacked . His platoon was kept_in reserve . Silent squads slipped over his trench , headed for the American lines . Suddenly the darkness exploded in Marine gunfire and red streaks of tracers . The Imperial Army ' s 136th was being mowed_down or driven into headlong retreat . Takeo Yamauchi , in his trench , decided he was one young Japanese who would n ' t get himself killed for his emperor . * Scheetz remembers that first night clear as day : &quot; Banzai &quot; charges , no sleep , no food . &quot; And still I wasn ' t tired . Nerves , I guess. &quot; The first 24 hours were devastating . He lost half his squad , dead or wounded . The air support the 6th Marines expected wasn ' t there . It took days to get Marine tanks ashore . But they inched inland day by day , finishing_off pockets of Japanese . And Scheetz , promoted to sergeant , showed_the_way for his men . &quot; I didn ' t get shook_up , not like some of them who swore they would n ' t make_it through the campaign , and they didn ' t . I was coming_back home. &quot; After all , he had left Virginia with a diamond ring . He had his close_calls . Twice he was wounded by shrapnel . And one day , as he checked_out a foxhole , an enemy soldier popped_up behind him . Before Scheetz could react , another Marine ' s bullet dropped the Japanese . The cleanup was gruesome . The Marines had mastered the use of the flamethrower and dynamite for finishing_off holdouts in caves and bunkers . In the end , fewer than 2 # 000 of the 30 # 000 Japanese defenders survived . The Americans , enraged by Japanese atrocities , had made the Pacific a no-holds-barred war . Today , Scheetz wonders . &quot; The generals decided we would n ' t take prisoners . But there were some who wanted to live , to surrender. &quot; Takeo Yamauchi , for one . * He had joined the chaotic Japanese flight inland . Survivors tried to reorganize in the_hills , but were spotted repeatedly by American_planes , bombed and scattered . In the sun and tropical downpours , Yamauchi wandered through valleys littered with the blackened , swollen bodies of his countrymen . Twice he was wounded . He had to dig_out the shrapnel with his own hands . Behind him , Japanese die-hards mounted a last suicidal charge against the Americans . More_than 4 # 000 were slaughtered . Yamauchi straggled northward , toward Saipan ' s greatest horrors . On July 11 , at the island ' s northern tip , he crawled into a cave where soldiers cowered with Japanese women and children . During the nights , he could hear soldiers ' ritual suicides outside : &quot; Banzai &quot; shouts -- &quot; May the Emperor Live 10 # 000 Years ! &quot; -- followed by grenade explosions . Farther off , unknown to him , Japanese civilians were leaping to their deaths from seaside cliffs , panicked by fears of American &quot; atrocities. &quot; In the cave , a dozen babies cried from hunger . A senior sergeant , fearing detection , ordered them silenced , or killed . One mother left with her infant . But in the muffled darkness Yamauchi could hear the other distraught women , sometimes with a soldier ' s help , strangling their own babies . It was the end for Yamauchi , the confused young student who had &quot; half-worshiped &quot; the emperor . He got_away in the night , to wait for the rising sun , to surrender , to take his chances with the Americans . September , 1944 Langenfeld , Germany Hitler ' s armies were disintegrating . Bloodied , moving only at night through the_French countryside , soldiers gathered_in makeshift &quot; fighting groups. &quot; On a road in Belgium , American tanks caught_up_with Fighting Group Hapke and Cpl . Egon Nuess . The outgunned Germans scattered , and their Capt . Hapke surrendered . But Nuess escaped and headed east with other stragglers , through Aachen , over the Rhine , to a small_town called Langenfeld . All but 20 of Nuess ' 200-man company had been killed , wounded or captured in the three-month rout . But at Langenfeld the paratroopers were regrouped and readied for the Third_Reich ' s final military adventure . At Langenfeld , too , at a farm-resthouse , the war-weary Nuess met a pretty young worker named Annelore . He soon left Langenfeld , but she would n ' t leave his mind . Dec . 16 , 1944 Berdorf , Luxembourg In the long drive through France , Joe Miller ' s platoon got just one break , a memorable one -- two August days in Paris , after the 4th Division helped liberate the City_of_Light . The GI celebration is frozen forever in a photo in the regimental history , a snapshot of Miller ' s men thronged by Frenchwomen . &quot; Boy , they sure loved us. &quot; Then it was_on to bloody new battles , at the Schnee Eifel ridgeline on the Belgian-German border , and the Huertgen Forest . A mortar blast wounded Miller -- shrapnel in the face -- but he stayed with his men . By late November , the division needed a rest . Instead , Joe Miller got another place in the regimental annals . The 4th was assigned to an &quot; inactive &quot; stretch of front in Luxembourg . In the town of Berdorf , Miller turned the tiny Parc Hotel into a platoon post . &quot; Beds . A shave . Hot meals ! &quot; But things quickly got uncomfortable . &quot; Are those ours out there ? &quot; someone asked one morning . Miller raised his binoculars : Infantrymen were pouring through the fields , and they weren ' t &quot; ours. &quot; It was Dec . 16 . Hitler had launched the great counteroffensive that became known as the Battle_of_the_Bulge . Miller got_on the radio and called_back his outlying gunners . They were vastly outnumbered , but they ' d make a stand . Gunfire from the holed-up Yanks pinned_down the Germans as they tried to pass_through town . The enemy turned mortars and tank guns on the hotel , blowing_off the roof . But the defenders simply moved downstairs . Then the Germans found some unexpected help . It was GI payday , and an Army paymaster suddenly showed_up , driving his Jeep right into the Germans ' arms . They marched the captured lieutenant down to the hotel . &quot; You guys had better surrender ! &quot; he shouted . &quot; They ' re all_over the place ! &quot; Miller had other ideas . &quot; I thought they ' d kill us. &quot; His men fired from the windows , and a half-dozen Germans fell . The American , unwounded , scrambled into the hotel . And for four more nights and days , the siege went_on . The GI machine-gunners and sharpshooters kept the roads dangerous for the Germans . The holdouts even laid a ring of empty bottles outside the hotel , an early_warning_system for nighttime assaults by &quot; Jerry. &quot; &quot; We ' d hear the noise , open_fire and throw grenades . And every morning there ' d be dead Germans outside. &quot; Miller ' s men ended_up five miles behind the advancing German lines . Finally , on the fifth night , American armor punched into Berdorf and rescued the infantrymen . An Associated Press story flashed word back to the States of the &quot; fortress hotel. &quot; After months of dread and intermittent letters , Jeannette could read about Joe in the New Haven Register . And worry still more . Up and down the line , 4th Division holdouts like Miller had slowed the Germans , contributing to the offensive ' s collapse . But the cost of the Bulge in American lives was heavy -- 19 # 000 dead , including scores of captured GIs slaughtered in cold blood by German troops . And as the huge GI army in the west and the Soviets in the east closed_in on the Third_Reich , evidence emerged daily of still greater crimes , of the Nazi genocide of millions of Jews , the &quot; enemies &quot; in a German country boy ' s simple world . December , 1944 German-Belgian Border The waste of war had changed Egon Nuess ' view of the world . During the Bulge fighting , his unit came under_attack as it held a pillbox on the Siegfried Line , near the Belgian border . The Americans pulled_back , but left_behind a fallen lieutenant . Nuess helped the captured man , wounded in the arm , back to an aid_station . Along the way , U.S. artillery_fire poured in . The American -- instinctively ? -- threw himself on his German escort to protect him . &quot; His name was Lieutenant Stein , &quot; Nuess recalls . &quot; Before the war , he was a police_officer in Ohio. &quot; They exchanged addresses , but in the confusion of the weeks that followed , Nuess lost_it . His single-minded purpose then , as the Reich crumbled , was to get_back to Langenfeld , and Annelore . At one point in April , near the Rhine , Nuess and a half-dozen other soldiers were captured by Americans . But he managed to escape , to cross the Rhine , to finally reach the Langenfeld farm . He took_off his uniform . &quot; The war ended for me April 16 , 1945. &quot; Days later , American troops found him and shipped him off to an internment_camp . * Of the four , Takeo Yamauchi was the last to go_home . And there , in Kameoka , he found his tombstone . In November , 1945 , after 16 months in prisoner-of-war camps , he sailed into Yokosuka harbor and telegraphed his family . A tearful sister met him at Kyoto train_station . The family was mortified . He was supposed to be dead in Saipan . They had held a funeral , and his father made a speech to the townspeople . &quot; My father was bewildered , &quot; said Yamauchi , now 73 . &quot; He might have preferred that I were dead. &quot; He moved to Tokyo , married , reared a son and daughter . Over the years , he worked for a leftist pacifist group , an economic research organization and as an academic . Today , he and his wife , Sumiko , live_in a sedate middle-class district , in a small house with rock_garden and plum_tree . Unlike most Japanese , the socialist Yamauchi is uncomfortable with the U.S.-Japanese partnership that has helped make his country an economic superpower . &quot; I think Japan is now achieving by economic power what it couldn ' t achieve before by force -- domination of other Asian_countries , &quot; he said . And he has never forgiven those responsible_for the war . &quot; The emperor should have been hanged as the No . 1 war_criminal , &quot; the old Imperial Army sergeant said . * Ask Lyle Scheetz what the war was about and the emperor springs to his mind too . &quot; If somebody didn ' t fight , hard to tell what kind of country we would have had if you let Hirohito take over. &quot; But the old Marine recently had to update his views of the Japanese . When he came_home to Illinois , Scheetz had a fine postwar stake , $ 3 # 000 in Marine poker winnings . He settled into farming , gathering_up 430 acres down the road from Nauvoo . Corn , wheat and soybeans -- beans whose price was long kept nice and high by Japanese importers . Today , at 73 , he relaxes in retirement with Virginia in their 1950s prairie farmhouse , renting the land to their three sons . They also have a daughter , Linda , a high_school teacher who came_to her father not long ago with the news that she was marrying a college professor , a foreign-born fellow . Actually , a Japanese . Scheetz smiled at the memory . &quot; Fifty years ago , I kind of hated them , &quot; he said , but &quot; they were just like Americans , sent to fight and have one job to do , surviving. &quot; In fact , the old machine-gunner says he might take_a_look at a Japanese car next time . His &quot; Semper Fi &quot; sticker might look just right on the bumper . * Maybe the war did have its good side , Joe Miller reflects . When the infantry officer hung_up his uniform in Connecticut , he told his factory boss he could no longer settle for a workbench job . He left for a sales career , rising to general sales manager for a tool-and-die company . &quot; The war taught me to be confident , and open , and an optimist , &quot; said Miller , 76 . But the war ' s many victims may have included his Jeannette , he fears . She suffered three miscarriages in the late 1940s . He wonders whether the tense months of wartime waiting had something to do with it . They adopted two little boys and prospered through America ' s boom years . In 1982 , he retired to Florida ' s golf_courses . Seven years later , Jeannette died . Once , in the mid-1970s , Miller went_back to Germany , this time on a friendly scouting mission , looking_for a business partner . &quot; I have great admiration for the German people. &quot; &quot; But , you know , &quot; he said , &quot; they ' re a militaristic people in a way . Hitler had to be stopped . Otherwise , we ' d be ' achtung ' -ing right now. &quot; Still , the old infantryman wonders : Do young people really understand ? &quot; When I talk_about the war , my daughter-in-law just kind of shrugs her shoulders , &quot; he said . All that blood . All those tears . * Egon Nuess looks_out his window onto Hardt Street , the road that brought American tanks -- so_long ago ? -- up from the Rhine , into Langenfeld . Today , the sleek Mercedeses of a new Germany roll_down the road . After the war , Nuess settled in Langenfeld with his bride . She bore a daughter , and the bright young_man from the north found a calling , tax consulting . He lost his beloved Annelore six years ago . But at 68 , Nuess still runs his busy firm and delights in seven grandchildren , including a 17-year-old girl studying in America . The ex-corporal first learned of the Holocaust months after the war . But he doesn ' t evade responsibility for Germany ' s crimes . &quot; I accept guilt . I live with that. &quot; He , like the others , finds lasting lessons in the war : the need for democracy , not Nazi-style narrowness and nationalism ; the need for friendship among nations . But the memory of war , for the warriors , will always be deeply personal , a memory of dreamlike images , of strange moments that somehow don ' t fit the script of history , of random faces , living and dead . The face of the German officer who , surrendering , proudly informed Miller he had a wife and daughter in Chicago . The Marine who amazed prisoner Yamauchi by carrying a wounded Japanese woman in his arms . The buddy who lost a leg fighting beside Scheetz and went_on to deliver mail for 30 years . Or are these the memories that truly get_to the heart of things ? &quot; Sometimes I think_about that day on the Siegfried Line , and Lt . Stein , &quot; said Egon Nuess . &quot; I hope he ' s well . I hope he ' s at_home , with his family in Ohio. &quot;</TEXT>
