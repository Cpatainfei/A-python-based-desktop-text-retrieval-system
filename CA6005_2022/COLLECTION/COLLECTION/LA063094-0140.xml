   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : COMPUTERS ARE BECOMING VITAL IN IMPROVING SOIL ; YOUR PC CAN LINK YOU TO EXPERTS AND MESSAGE GROUPS THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO BETTER THE LAND BY PRODUCING COMPOST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When people hear the term computer composting , they think I ' m suggesting that we grind up old PCs for mulch . And though we are talking_about a means of protecting and enhancing the soil that sustains us , none of us will have to sacrifice our expensive computer_hardware for the good of the garden or the field . The computer composting I ' m referring to is the sort that , as Ventura composting expert Eric Werbalowsky puts it , teaches us &quot; how to be Johnny Appleseed with a horticultural education program on the Internet. &quot; Then he reeled_off the names of some electronic_databases that composters , organic gardeners and professional agricultural experts are already using . Their goal is to promote and practice the gentle art of tending the land -- the soil itself . The idea is this : If you have vital , healthy , biologically active soil , a lot of other growing problems will disappear . Organic , non-chemical , grind-up-the-green-waste ideas predominate on these electronic services . According to Werbalowsky , there are already a large_number of gardeners around the country who have been running to their home computers to seek advice from computer groups , whose members can be found through names such_as tree.zip , plant.zip , slug1.thd and something one might expect , mlchmw.txt , which is about mulching equipment . These pithy monikers represent the e-mail addresses of organizations such_as the Master Gardeners ' Conference and the Montessori Foundation ' s Horticultural Education Within the Schools Program . Go Gardening is the e-mail address for an organization called the Gardening Forum . Users either delve into the electronic data much as they might browse through the best agricultural library in the world , or they post a sort of electronic cry_for help on the Internet and wait for a response . Individuals such_as Werbalowsky -- whose e-mail address is WERB.DELPHI.COM -- is among those ready to play the J . Appleseed role . Later this summer , this hardy band will be joined by some people in Ojai , known as Harmonious Technologies , which plans to offer a sort of electronic composting college / catalogue sales service . The group , headed by John Roulac , is already well-known in national composting circles for its best-selling book &quot; Back-Yard Composting. &quot; California municipalities have been buying copies in the thousands to pass_out to residents to encourage them to compost rather than throw green waste into local landfills . And techniques such_as composting , urban tree trimming and mulching are particularly important for California , where our use of chemicals and a growing shortage of water so imperil our rich topsoil . Computers , in their no-nonsense way , are a great aid in dealing with this issue . Paul Bartels , president of the local citrus growers association and owner of GreenSource , a mulch-producing operation in Fillmore , is a big booster of composting . And he is practicing what he preaches : Within 10 years , the grounds of the 30 acres of orchard he leases will all be covered in mulch for water retention and nutrient replenishment . He predicts that big commercial growers will eventually notice -- electronically -- the experiences of folks like himself . &quot; It ' s going_to show_up on the computer_screen -- just like the info they ' re already checking_out about the best loan packages and most efficient watering patterns -- in a form they have come_to think_of as irrefutable. &quot; Some of this , he said , is already happening . &quot; Their CPAs are recommending bugs ( &quot; friendly &quot; insects , which eat pests ) instead of spraying . The computer will ( eventually ) recommend mulch instead of bare land and fertilizers. &quot; Details * FYI : Computer-savvy and environmentally minded_readers interested in the latest information on composting , organic gardening , and even how to plant and maintain a kitchen_garden from the 1776 Fourth_of_July era can hook_up their modems and address e-mail to Go Gardening , tree.zip , cmpst.Txt. or a local expert , WERB.DELPHI.COM , whose human name is Eric Werbalowsky .</TEXT>
