   <TEXT> A church-owned apartment complex for senior_citizens has been approved for a $ 3.5-million , low-interest loan from the federal_Department of Housing and Urban Development to pay_for earthquake repairs . Thomas C . Baker , administrator of Fickett Towers , 14801 Sherman Way , Van Nuys , said that he had worried about getting the help &quot; night and day since January the 17th. &quot; Word that the loan had been approved was announced by the office of Rep . Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills. ) The Northridge earthquake did not leave the 198-unit apartment_building uninhabitable . The building was green-tagged , meaning it was safe to occupy , despite about $ 3.5 million in damage , Baker said . One wall was weakened structurally , Baker said , and part of the loan money will be used to reinforce it . Other damage at the building included water damage and cosmetic damage to walls . The apartment_building is owned by Shepherd of the_Hills Baptist_Church in Porter Ranch . The aid from the HUD Earthquake Loan Program can be used to make mortgage payments delayed by the earthquake and for bringing the building_up to current city building_codes , as well as for earthquake repairs . The church has been unable to complete repairs on the building without the federal assistance , Baker said . ED BOND</TEXT>
