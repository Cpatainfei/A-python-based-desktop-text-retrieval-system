   <HEADLINE> O.C. STUDENTS IN A LAWSUIT STATE OF MIND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One day he was practicing for a big football game . The next Michael Carter was tackling the legal_system , eventually claiming in a lawsuit he was wrongly kicked_out of his all-boy Catholic high_school for accusing female teachers of &quot; femi-Nazi tactics. &quot; Carter says it ' s a matter of free speech . Since he sued Servite High_School in Anaheim , the Huntington Beach teen-ager has made headlines and received support from Rush Limbaugh , the talk_show host who coined the phrase Carter says got him in_trouble during a school campaign speech . People now stop Carter for autographs and he has coined a message of_his_own : &quot; Question everything , &quot; he tells them . &quot; Don ' t be afraid to speak out. &quot; Carter , whose case is nearing trial in Orange County Superior_Court , is part of a recent wave of students who are not just speaking out at school -- they are hiring lawyers . While attorneys , school and court officials don ' t keep statistics on such lawsuits , many say they believe the number of local cases against schools are rising , from disputes over schoolyard injuries and special_education services to complaints that school administrators are trampling basic freedoms . In recent months , a Mission Viejo teen-ager went_to court claiming a teacher violated his constitutional liberties by disciplining him for wearing a devil mascot logo on his letter jacket . Another South County boy called a news_conference to allege he was assaulted by a teacher who thought he had been hiding dice . And in another case , a former Newport Harbor High_School student sued over what she considered the outrageous and illegal fees of joining her school ' s cheerleading squad . &quot; Ten years ago , people would ask me , ' What do schools need an attorney for ? ' &quot; said attorney Geraldine Jaffe , of the Orange County Department_of_Education . &quot; Nobody has asked me that in years. &quot; Jaffe attributes the apparent rise to the notion that &quot; school districts are truly microcosms of what ' s going_on in society. &quot; Students , their parents and their lawyers have other ideas , talking_of arrogance and stubborn attitudes on the part of administrators and supportive Baby_Boomer parents who fought for their own_rights as students in the 1960s and ' 70s . Strict zero-tolerance disciplinary policies involving weapons , alcohol and drugs , along with changing_state and federal law involving special_education , also are contributing to litigation , lawyers say . Whatever the causes , the cases and legal threats are taking a toll from schools , especially administrators who are &quot; getting yelled at from every corner , &quot; said David Larsen , an Orange County attorney who often represents school districts . &quot; A lot more demands are being placed on people that are time consuming and diverting attention away from the basic education programs they are trying to provide , &quot; he said . The threat of civil and criminal action , as well as the potential of losing their credentials and jobs , is putting teachers in &quot; quadruple jeopardy , &quot; said Tommye Hutto , with the California Teachers Assn . &quot; There is a chilling effect , &quot; Hutto said . &quot; Teachers are more cautious and less willing to take risks with students . &quot; It ' s not good for teachers at all , &quot; she added . &quot; It ' s not good for students either. &quot; School officials say that mistakes can happen and some claims are legitimate , but contend that most of the disputes could be resolved short of the courtroom . The concerns are just as real for private_schools , which have fewer resources to defend themselves in court than larger public districts , said Father Gerald Horan , president of Servite High_School . &quot; I think it ' s unfortunate that any time a person doesn ' t get their way , the first thing they threaten to do is sue , &quot; Horan said . &quot; If we could hear and appreciate another person ' s perspective , if we could respect the fact that another person feels differently , we could make so_much more headway . The minute you threaten to sue , you ' re in a standoff. &quot; Students involved in some local cases say their decision to sue was not made lightly , and they too suffer a heavy price for fighting_back . &quot; This was the last_resort , &quot; said Heather Delaney , the 17-year-old former cheerleader who is suing Newport-Mesa Unified School District . Among other things , Delaney alleges she was illegally charged more_than $ 1 # 700 in one year for her uniforms , coaches and other expenses , fees that boys don ' t have to pay in their athletic programs . Delaney said she has lost friends since making her allegations and felt so &quot; unwelcome &quot; at her school that she transferred to another for her senior year . She fought_back tears as she talked_about what ' s happened to her final year of high_school . &quot; I ' ve been trying to focus not on what I ' m missing , but what I will be accomplishing , &quot; Delaney said during as recent interview in her family ' s living room , her attorney seated at her side . &quot; My goal is that the district will become more sensitive and cheerleading will be more fair and equitable for everyone. &quot; Her lawyer , John S . Roth , declined to discuss the family ' s arrangement for paying_for his services . Delaney said her parents are backing her up &quot; 100 % &quot; in her lawsuit . &quot; My parents are just glad I ' m having the courage to do this , &quot; she said . Attorneys representing the school district could not be reached for comment before press time . In the past , school officials have said they did nothing wrong , and said they tried to work with the Delaney family for six to eight months , enlisting a district committee to review the complaints through an internal hearing process , in the hopes of resolving the dispute . Delaney ' s allegations recall another much-publicized lawsuit brought_in 1990 by a former Irvine cheerleader , Melissa Fontes , who alleged that girls on her Woodbridge High_School pep squad were held to a higher academic standard than the male athletes they cheered . Fontes sued to have the policy_changed -- but did not seek any damages from the school . A state appellate_court agreed with her , overturning a 1992 Orange County Superior_Court decision that had gone_against Fontes . The state Supreme Court eventually allowed the appellate ruling to stand , but ruled that the decision should not set a legal precedent for other cases . Attorney Bonnie K . Lawley is still trying to make the district pay $ 37 # 000 in attorney fees , which she says is just a fraction of the actual cost . She did not charge the Fonteses , but the family paid close to $ 5 # 000 in basic court costs that come_with filing motions and other actions . Fontes , now 21 and a philosophy major at an Oregon college , said the experience ruined her memories of high_school , although she doesn ' t regret going_to court . She ' s considering going_to law_school . &quot; It was one of the most significant learning experiences I ' ve had , &quot; she said . &quot; It really tested my principles and my integrity. &quot; Lawley said she was so committed to the Fontes case because she had faced a similar problem with her own daughter ' s middle_school cheerleading program . But in her daughter ' s case , Lawley said , the school changed its policy without a court fight , something she wishes others would do . &quot; I ' d like to see educators develop more open minds in terms of looking_at the requirements they set and how they affect young people , &quot; she said . Cecilia Carter , whose son Michael is fighting to be readmitted to Servite High_School , said the decision to sue the Catholic_school was a difficult one , and one made_possible only through an offer of free help from an attorney with the Los Angeles-based Individual Rights Foundation . &quot; It ' s a very serious , painful situation , &quot; Cecilia Carter said during a recent interview at her family ' s Catholic supplies shop in Newport Beach . &quot; But above everything else , it ' s a First_Amendment issue. &quot; Attorney John Howard , who is representing Michael Carter , said he believes many students and their parents find themselves faced with a &quot; profound arrogance &quot; on the part of school administrators . &quot; It ' s good that kids are finding_out that they have rights , &quot; Howard said . &quot; It ' s probably a better civics lesson than anything they can get_in school. &quot; Carter , 18 , filed his lawsuit last fall , contending that administrators ordered him to undergo psychological counseling after he made the &quot; femi-Nazi &quot; reference during a campaign speech toward the end of the previous school_year . When he refused to comply with the order , contending it was improper discipline , school officials denied his readmission . Servite officials say the Carters and their attorney have misrepresented what happened , and that Carter was not asked to attend counseling because of the &quot; femi-Nazi &quot; reference . They contend the statement reflected a pattern of behavior teachers found &quot; offensive and disrespectful. &quot; &quot; Clearly we did not punish him for what he said in his speech , &quot; Servite President Horan said . Carter said the lawsuit has made his studies difficult , recalling one night that he was up until 2 a.m. trying to get written verification from his former classmates about the contents of his campaign speech . The next morning he had to take a college-entrance exam . &quot; It really has affected my studies in a big way , &quot; said Carter , who spent his senior year at a public high_school . &quot; I really couldn ' t focus . It was always in the back of my head , kicking at me. &quot; Carter has graduated from high_school and is now working_at his family ' s store and helping_out as an assistant to a priest . He said he is continuing to seek readmission to Servite to vindicate his name , and to improve his chance of getting_into a Catholic college . A judge has denied one request that Carter be readmitted . A jury trial is set for February . Other cases have come_in response to newly stringent discipline policies at public_schools . Irvine attorney Jack A . Fleischli said he has handled three cases involving students who faced possible expulsion for a single violation after having previously unblemished records . He cited an Anaheim Hills honor student who was forced to transfer to another high_school last year after distributing a controversial underground newspaper . School officials said the paper made &quot; obscene &quot; and &quot; defamatory &quot; remarks about school employees . The student sued , but later dropped the case after settling for a voluntary transfer to a school that offered the college-bound academic_programs he needed , Fleischli said . Fleischli said he believes &quot; zero-tolerance &quot; policies that mandate expulsions for various offenses are a &quot; knee-jerk reaction to complex problems &quot; that have increased risk of lawsuits . &quot; It ' s like the ' three strikes ' law , &quot; he said , referring to California ' s new law requiring life prison_terms for three-time felons . &quot; It ' s an easy rule to make and apply , but it ' s not great when you start applying it to individuals who do not seem to deserve the consequences they received. &quot; Fleischli said he has noticed a common thread among student clients . &quot; The kids are all fighters , &quot; he said . &quot; They won ' t give_up . They ' re aggressive in their attitude and they have a strong self-image . Their parents are not the kind who will simply bow away from a confrontation. &quot; While Orange County educators and lawyers cite an increase in school lawsuits , that may_not be the case elsewhere in the country . Perry A . Zirkel , a professor of education and law at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania , said his research shows a nationwide decrease in the rate of most state and federal education cases being filed . He said that more cases nationwide are being won by school districts , reversing trends of the 1960s and 1970s when student lawsuits sparked several landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings establishing student rights approaching those of adults . Zirkel , however , said he has noted two areas -- special_education and disputes over religion -- where the number of cases are consistently increasing everywhere . Locally , school officials and their lawyers have stepped_up efforts to head_off disputes before they land in court . Since 1982 , preventive law has become a major service of the Orange County Department_of_Education , where staff attorneys offer advice , issue legal opinions and hold workshops to help educators avoid problems and resolve disputes . Sexual harassment , child welfare , dress codes and search and seizure of student property were the topics of some recent workshops , said attorney Jaffe , a member of the department ' s schools legal services office . &quot; Our office is busier than ever , &quot; said Ron Wenkart , general counsel for the education_department . Wenkart said most disputes are settled without ever going_to court and administrators are eager to make changes necessary to avoid problems . &quot; We have made changes , &quot; he said . &quot; We have resolved these issues . You only read about the ones that don ' t get resolved. &quot;</TEXT>
