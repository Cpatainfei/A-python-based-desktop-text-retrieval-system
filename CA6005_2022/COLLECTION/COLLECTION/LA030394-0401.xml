   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; ACCURATE TO A FAULT ; SEISMOLOGY : SCIENTISTS ARE SLOWLY UNRAVELING THE COMPLICATED PUZZLE OF QUAKE ACTIVITY IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY . THEIR HIGH-TECH TOOLS MIGHT SHOW WHICH SYSTEMS TO FOCUS_ON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For decades , the San Gabriel Valley has been home to much of the nation ' s earthquake re search . And although the 6.8 Northridge temblor caused only modest damage locally , its deadly upward punch refocused attention on the theory that serious seismic activity is continuing in the Los Angeles Basin -- much of it increasingly centered in or near the San Gabriel Valley . Within the past seven years , four of six earthquakes in the basin registering 5.0 or larger were centered in the San Gabriel Valley or nearby Upland , researchers say . &quot; We ' ve gone from about zero activity to a lot of activity , &quot; said Richard Morton , a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey at UC Riverside . &quot; that ' s what ' s really troublesome. &quot; Geologists and seismologists sprang into action when the Jan . 17 temblor struck Northridge , killing at least 57 people causing more_than $ 20 billion in damage . Since then , they have busied themselves in the San Fernando Valley , setting_up portable seismographs , measuring ground movement and examining cracks in the earth . Their findings about the Northridge quake could affect how scientists view the faults and earthquake activity 20 miles to the east in the San Gabriel Valley . The research &quot; might change our picture of how these ( San Gabriel Valley ) faults interact together , &quot; said Lucile M . Jones , a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist . &quot; It might tell us which are more important than others. &quot; * Scientists have been working for years to unravel the horrendously complicated puzzle of faults in the San Gabriel Valley and much of the Los Angeles Basin . The valley ' s fault system is far more complicated than the notorious San Andreas fault zone just over the mountains to the east , seismologists say . &quot; It ' s not clear how the pieces fit together , &quot; said Jones , the seismologist well-known to local television viewers for her savvy translations of what all_the shaking means . Those pieces include active faults like the 60-mile-long Sierra Madre , considered the biggest threat in the valley capable of generating a 7.5-magnitude shock . Shorter , less-threatening faults such_as the Raymond , Cucamonga , Whittier , Eagle Rock , San Jose and Clamshell Saw Pit also thread through the valley . * Complicating the issue are faults such_as the 50-million-year-old San Gabriel Fault . The San Andreas of its day , the only energy the San Gabriel generates now is controversy . Scientists debate whether movement 11 # 000 years ago on this fault means it still should be considered active , Morton said . At the other end of the activity scale is one of the more recently discovered faults , the Elysian Park Fold and Thrust Belt . A thrust occurs when one side of a slanting fault moves closer to its parallel side . The Elysian Park belt , skirting the San Gabriel Valley ' s southwestern edge , was discovered when it emerged as the prime suspect in the Whittier Narrows quake . Between the giant lines of these faults are webs of smaller faults , not significant enough to even warrant names . Buried and unseen faults become known , as did the Northridge fault and the Elysian Park belt , only when an earthquake shakes the earth , Morton said . Like the Northridge fault , the Elysian Park Fold and Thrust Belt is a blind thrust , meaning the fault_line cannot be seen on the surface . Small hills on the surface may give some idea of the existence of blind thrusts underneath , but because their location cannot be pinpointed , scientists may have no knowledge of these faults until an earthquake hits . With the same seismic energy as other faults , these may_not be more dangerous but do carry the added punch of surprise . &quot; These buried systems are very important criteria , &quot; Jones said . &quot; We can have a 6.6 anywhere in Los Angeles . . . . You can understand them , but basically you can ' t get the extent of them until an earthquake happens. &quot; And earthquakes are always happening . Usually their magnitude registers below 3 , the level at which seismologists begin studying quakes as major seismic events . From 1900 to 1920 , seismologists saw little need to study the Los Angeles Basin , which enjoyed relative seismic quiet . * But the following two decades -- 1920 to 1940 -- saw a cluster of temblors . Big quakes hit the southern end of the county , including a 6.4-magnitude tremor in Long_Beach in 1933 . Residents as far north as Monterey Park still recall pianos rolling_out their back_doors . Then followed 30 more years of quiet , until a 5.2 quake rumbled through the San Gabriel Mountains in 1970 . The temblor was noted mainly by scientists because of its remote location on Lytle Creek . But the following year , nearly everyone took_notice when the 6.4-magnitude Sylmar quake killed 58 people and caused $ 511 million in damage . * It was the only quake this century to rupture the surface of the Los Angeles Basin , a rare event because earthquake fissures typically occur one to 12 miles below the surface . After that , the cluster continued through the 1970s and 1980s . Quakes in the San Gabriel Valley or nearby included tremors in 1987 in Whittier Narrows , 1988 in Pasadena , 1990 in Upland , 1991 in Sierra Madre and this year in Northridge . But what it means , no one knows . Are we at the beginning , middle or end of a cycle ? &quot; Only history will tell , &quot; Morton said . Although the Sierra Madre Fault is the biggest danger locally , Jones said she cannot predict when it might strike the San Gabriel Valley , except to say a 5.0 quake is expected in the next 200 years . The problem , she said , is that society wants earthquake hazard information on a human time_scale measured in years , instead of a geologic one measured in eons . One thing the valley has in its favor , and that makes_it unusual in the Los Angeles Basin , is the relatively solid geology , Morton said . The bedrock of the San Gabriel Mountains -- except for the lower , newer rock of the_hills near Glendora -- provides a stable base during earthquakes , Morton said . In the valley floor , deep water_tables -- below 35 feet -- provide safety against liquefaction , the movement of waterlogged soil that plagued Santa Monica in the Northridge quake . San Gabriel Valley has long been the center of earthquake research in the United States , dating_from 1928 , when Caltech established a seismology lab in Pasadena . In the 1930s , Caltech Prof . Charles F . Richter developed a scale of measuring earthquakes that made his last_name a household word . In 1943 , a group of Caltech scientists , using the name Jet_Propulsion Laboratory , received a $ 5-million Army grant for rocket research . JPL went_on to become an internationally known military and space research lab , entering seismic research with satellites in the 1980s . In the early 1970s , the U.S. Geological Survey affiliated with Caltech , now recognized as one of the world ' s premier quake labs . And the effort to understand San Gabriel Valley ' s faults is always under way , using a variety of methods : Satellite data A constellation of 24 Defense_Department satellites -- circling the globe and sending data back to 45 portable receivers worldwide -- yields information about the creep of tectonic plates , noting movement as little as a quarter of an inch . The receivers , placed at various sites at yearly intervals , record whether the ground has moved since the last placement . Based since the 1980s at JPL , the program received a recent boost of $ 63 # 000 from a National Science Foundation grant . It enabled Gregory A . Lyzenga , a geophysicist at Harvey Mudd College , to add two receivers to the four in California . Armed with the laptop computer-size receivers and one-foot-diameter antennas , Lyzenga and students from the Claremont Colleges last fall roamed the mountaintops and valleys in San Gabriel Valley . They busied themselves placing the receivers in various locations so that the satellites could retrieve the data and compare it for movement against data from the same spot recorded a year ago . When the Northridge quake struck , they were sent scrambling again for aftershock data to measure ground movement . &quot; I ' m a little bit of a strange bird , &quot; said Lyzenga , a college undergraduate teacher suddenly plunged into the world of research science to rub arms with scientists armed with doctorates far removed from the classroom . &quot; This is a very modern development . Literally three to five years ago it would have been unthinkable. &quot; Trenching Digging_into the first five to 20 feet of earth , scientists measure rock displacements and deduce the movement and magnitude of old quakes . They can pinpoint the era of these older quakes using another technology : radiocarbon dating of organic debris captured in rock . Through radiocarbon dating , Caltech geologist Kerry Sieh and others analyzed the Raymond Fault in the San Gabriel Valley and the San Andreas Fault , both near Wrightwood on the north_side of the San Gabriels and 20 miles north into the desert . In one spot , he gathered a history of 12 earthquakes in the last 1 # 800 years , one of the more complete records available . Near Wrightwood , evidence of an 1812 tremor and others yielded clues to earthquake patterns . Some major quakes did not seem to occur at both locations , even though they were separated by a mere 20 miles . Sieh ' s trenching also led him to conclude that the southernmost end of the San Andreas Fault , between Indio and the Salton Sea , is the most likely area to next generate an earthquake . Explosives Beginning this fall , scientists from the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC and the U.S. Geological Survey will set_off 60 small blasts at least 50 feet underground from Seal Beach through the San Gabriel Valley to the Mojave_Desert . The blasts equal a magnitude 2.5 earthquake , tremors that occur at the rate of 40 to 50 on a normal day in Southern California , scientists say . The explosions are usually placed in spots perpendicular to fault_lines to give the best readings and to allow differences in the rock to be easily discerned , said Jim Mori of the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena . The northeast route followed by the blasts will roughly parallel the San Gabriel River , with up_to 10 explosions set_off in the valley , Mori said . Using ammonium_nitrate to create gentle shock_waves , scientists will measure wave travel speeds to reveal the underlying geologic structure -- the geological equivalent of a human X-ray . The speed at which the waves bounce off underlying rock and travel back to the surface allows scientists to determine what sort of rock and soil lies underneath . Mathematically , Mori said , the information gives a detailed picture of the fault location and the geologic structure . Seismic networking Located at Caltech for the past three years , a computerized system stores Southern California quake facts culled from 220 sites . Small sensors the size of a soup can , with accompanying electronic_equipment , are piled in garbage can-size barrels . These barrels are scattered 10 to 15 miles apart to allow scientists to carpet the area and get overall readings for the entire region . A handful of sites are located in the flats of the San Gabriel Valley ; another 20 are in the San Gabriel Mountains , where the bedrock gives better readings , Mori said . &quot; We try to hide them , &quot; he said , adding that solar_panels sometimes used to power the equipment are very often hit by bullets from target shooters or are pulled_off by thieves . Sensitive seismographs , capable of recording zero-magnitude quakes -- that is , the very smallest quakes -- are set_up to collect data . After major shocks measuring magnitude 5 or better , additional portable seismographs are hustled out_to even more sites . The system , called a &quot; jukebox &quot; by some scientists , enables researchers to retrieve data via computer and avoid traveling_to Pasadena to spend weeks reading through computer tapes . Jones and her husband , Egill Hauksson of Caltech ' s seismology lab , are network experts . Together or with other scientists , the couple have written_on most major quakes in the San Gabriel Valley . Their data has helped reveal the geometric structure of faults in the San Gabriel Valley , the direction of slippage in earthquakes , the geometric and geologic fit of faults and the determination of fault systems . Such information can yield the discovery of potentially hazardous faults or future earthquakes . Despite all this research activity , much is unknown . &quot; We don ' t know what makes them start or stop , &quot; Jones said . &quot; Or why they happen today instead of tomorrow . We don ' t know what is the trigger. &quot;</TEXT>
