   <HEADLINE> GO OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY FOR A NONPARTISAN PROSECUTOR ; WHITEWATER : STARR ' S WORK FOR BUSH AND REAGAN HAS THE MARKS OF THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT HIS APPOINTMENT WAS TO AVOID .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Will Robert Bork be appointed the new special prosecutor in the inquiry regarding Agriculture_Secretary Mike Espy ? If last week ' s selection of Republican stalwart Kenneth Starr as the special prosecutor for Whitewater is any indication of how the three-judge panel makes decisions , the selection of Bork might not be as absurd as it sounds . The judges are supposed to make their selection from a list of senior attorneys with judicial or prosecutorial experience and reputation for impartiality . Somehow within these guidelines , the judges managed to select an attorney with no prosecutorial experience and with the appearance of a conflict_of_interest that should disqualify him from heading such a controversial and politically loaded investigation . Granted , an appearance of conflict is often different from an actual conflict_of_interest , but the judges who appointed Starr made_a_point of stating that the Special Prosecution Act &quot; contemplates an apparent as well as actual independence on the part of the counsel. &quot; Further , the judges said that they had appointed someone who would not be subject_to the &quot; perceptions of conflicts. &quot; But how independent can Starr be if , as the press has reported , he recently discussed with other lawyers plans to file a brief opposing President Clinton ' s legal position in the sexual_harassment case filed by Paula Corbin Jones ? This single act alone , which may be an actual conflict , should have disqualified Starr under the appearance-of-conflict standard , but there is more . In selecting Starr , the judges noted that it would be &quot; in the best interest of the appearance of independence contemplated by the act that a person not affiliated with the incumbent Administration be appointed. &quot; Did the court overlook that it was Bill_Clinton who defeated Starr ' s last boss , George_Bush ? That Starr was solicitor_general in the Bush_Administration , chief_of_staff to William French Smith , President Reagan ' s attorney_general , and a Reagan appointee to the federal_Court of Appeals ? Appearance of independence means more_than just independence from the targets of the investigation . A truly impartial special prosecutor must also be independent from those who could benefit most from the publicity and outcome of the investigation . Many Washington insiders , including prominent Democrats , view Starr as a man of integrity who would be able to overcome his partisan background and be fair and impartial . But it defies common_sense and ambition to believe that Starr would be able to reconcile his loyalty to the Republican_Party , his career and his duties as an independent prosecutor . If he is perceived by his own party to be tough on the Clinton_Administration , it certainly would help his chance to become attorney_general or a Supreme Court justice in the next Republican administration . But if the GOP leaders , especially the conservative wing , believe that he was soft_on the President , it would not enhance his status within the party . Hardly the scenario for an independent prosecutor . The subjects of the investigation are entitled to some assurances that the special prosecutor will not try to settle old political scores at their expense . Equally important , the American people who are footing the bill for this operation are entitled to have a truly nonpartisan , independent prosecutor . Can one be found ? Yes , if the judges were willing to look outside the Washington Beltway . There are hundreds of current and former U.S. attorneys and local district_attorneys capable of handling this type of case . While these men and women may have nominal political affiliation , their careers have not been , like Starr ' s , entangled with the office of the presidency . What the judges did_by appointing Starr is to further muddy Whitewater and to give the Clinton_Administration a chance to yell foul . They should not make the same mistake when they choose the next special prosecutor .</TEXT>
