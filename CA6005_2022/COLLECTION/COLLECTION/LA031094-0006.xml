   <HEADLINE> THE TRUE FACE OF INSANITY ; EXTREMISTS LOB MORTARS TOWARD LONDON ' S HEATHROW AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Peace is invariably the victim when the extremists are in a position to inflict their bitter and irrational pain . that ' s certainly the case in the Middle_East , whether the perpetrator is a hardened and trained Hamas operative or a fundamentalist Jewish settler who suddenly snaps . And it is the case in Northern_Ireland , where , it seems , no good deed ever goes unpunished . For the hardened criminal elements on both sides of this insatiable hatred , the great fear appears to be that reason will get the upper_hand , peace will settle over the land , and some day -- many years down the road -- the Catholics and Protestants of Ulster will live together in relative harmony , as of course they do_in both Britain and the Republic_of_Ireland . That prospect is so frightening to the psychotic elements on both extreme ends of the political spectrum there that any slight movement forward -- as , for example , the recent and highly laudatory efforts of the_British and Irish prime_ministers to find new common_ground -- seems to trigger yet another spasm of destruction . The latest violent reaction was the attempted mortar bombing of London ' s Heathrow Airport , one of the busiest and most efficient airline terminals in the world . No less than four mortars were fired from the back of a vehicle toward Britain ' s chief airport . Not surprisingly , of course , British authorities believe the culprits were members of the feared Irish_Republican_Army -- the Hamas-like element of Northern_Ireland . Almost miraculously , there was no reported damage or serious injury . As bad as the IRA is -- and its activities are an affront to all civilized people -- the other side has its extremists , too . And they have scarcely been inactive . Last November , for instance , police authorities intercepted a huge clandestine shipment of arms intended for the Unionist Ulster Defense Assn. , which represents the hard core of the anti-Irish and anti-unionist Protestant majority . There is no gainsaying the vileness on both sides . A recent film -- &quot; In the Name of the Father &quot; -- brilliantly dramatizes the deceptions and ineptitudes of British security_forces when they arrested the wrong suspects in a notorious 1974 British pub bombing case . While the movie takes many liberties with the facts , its central contention -- that the wrong people were imprisoned -- was correct . What the film fails to convey , however , is the difficulty of coping_with such violent terrorism in a democratic society that wishes to allow all accused people the maximum possible legal protection . Criticisms of the_British are fair enough , and proper enough ; but for perspective , imagine some group firing mortal shells from the back of a van at a crowded airport . What you see in that picture is the true face of insanity .</TEXT>
