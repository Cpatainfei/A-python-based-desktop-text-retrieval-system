   <HEADLINE> DOWNEY WILL GIVE BUS_LINE A TRIAL RUN ; TRANSIT : COUNCIL VOTES TO SPEND $ 458 # 000 FOR INTRA-CITY MINIVAN SERVICE DESPITE FORECASTS THAT THE PILOT_PROGRAM WILL NOT BE FULLY UTILIZED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An experimental intra-city bus_line will begin in Downey this spring despite a recent report that said few residents use public transportation already available . City_Council members recently allocated $ 458 # 000 in state transportation funds to pay_for the pilot_program , a four-route system that will use minivans to haul riders within the 12.7-square-mile city . The city ' s newest bus_line will be evaluated after a year , said James Jarrett , director of community services . The city signed a one-year contract with Mayflower Contract Services Inc. , which will provide the vehicles and the drivers . &quot; I ' m just glad that we are finally going_to try ( the buses ) , &quot; Jarrett said . &quot; we ' ll wait to see if ( the new_line ) gets used or not , then make a decision on its future. &quot; Transportation consultants hired by the city last year found that just 12 % of Downey ' s 91 # 444 residents use public transportation such_as Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses , Dial-A-Ride services for senior_citizens and special services for youth and handicapped riders . The consultants estimated that the new_line would probably attract an average of 14 to 19 riders per hour , or fewer than five riders per vehicle . The minivans can carry up_to 20 passengers . &quot; The ( ridership ) predictions look questionable , &quot; Councilwoman Barbara J . Riley said . &quot; I don ' t want to spend a fortune on a system that is not going_to be used . I ' d rather give_out vouchers for taxis -- it ' s much cheaper. &quot; Still , Riley and three others on the council said they were willing to give the bus system a trial run . Despite the dismal ridership figures , Riley said she thinks there is a need for low-cost transportation within the city_limits . &quot; The MTA runs in and out of the city , but you can ' t really get_around unless you have a car , &quot; she said . Councilman Gary P . McCaughan voted against the new bus_line , preferring instead to sell the transportation funds to another city , which would yield about 50 cents on the dollar . &quot; I ' m not saying that public_transit isn ' t important , &quot; McCaughan said . &quot; But it is something we can wait_on . I think we could have used the money to get us through these lean times. &quot; The money comes from Proposition A , the half-cent sales tax initiative that voters approved in the early 1980s . Since 1982 , Downey has received about $ 1 million each year for transportation , paying_for Dial-A-Ride and other transportation-related services . The proposed bus_service drew mixed responses from Downey residents in a survey last year by two transportation consultants , Santa Ana-based DAVE Transportation Services Inc. and Claremont-based A-M-M-A . Although most respondents said they would welcome the bus , others said that by providing low-cost transportation , the city would attract more &quot; non-English-speaking &quot; residents and those who are &quot; unemployed and homeless. &quot; Others said they feared that the new bus_line would bring higher taxes . Some said the city isn ' t big enough to have its own bus_line . &quot; Downey is so small , &quot; wrote one resident , &quot; we can walk to almost anywhere we need to go. &quot; Officials said they hope some Downey residents who also work in the city will use the new bus_service . About 25 % of the Downey work_force lives in the city , according to the 1990 census . Officials are also counting_on members of one-car families , who make_up more_than half the city ' s residents , to use the minivans for shopping and other errands . The final destination point for each of the bus_routes is the Stonewood Shopping_Center The vans will run Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. beginning April 1 . The fare will be 25 cents per ride .</TEXT>
