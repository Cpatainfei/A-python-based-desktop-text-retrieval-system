   <HEADLINE> BEILENSON , SYBERT AND THE HEALTH_CARE ISSUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Having read the respective articles on proposed health_care reform of 24th District congressional candidates Rich Sybert and Anthony Beilenson ( Sept . 25 ) , I was struck by the wide gulf that exists between them . While Mr. Beilenson purports to espouse a &quot; go-slow approach , &quot; he is one of the co-sponsors of HR 1200 , the legislation that would impose a &quot; single-payer &quot; system like that which exists in Canada . Mr. Beilenson avoids any mention of this fact in his article , even though it ' s the centerpiece of his proposals on health_care reform . The likelihood is that he fails to mention his co-sponsorship of single-payer legislation because he has some concern that 24th District voters might not share his view that a single-payer ( the federal_government ) system is the answer . It ' s hard to figure how Mr. Beilenson ostensibly embraces a &quot; cautious approach &quot; while proposing a single-payer system of socialized medicine that could not be more radical . In all events , Mr. Beilenson should make_it plain to 24th District voters that he has taken a leadership role in_advancing single-payer legislation , instead of proposing in his article literally nothing other_than caution . JOHN P . DOYLE Tarzana * On the topic of &quot; legal reform , &quot; Richard Sybert ' s commentary , &quot; How Congress Should Operate on Health_Care , &quot; ( Sept . 25 ) is factually inaccurate , as well as misguided . Sybert claims that &quot; conspicuously absent from the Administration ' s ( health proposals ) is any suggestion of reform of the legal system. &quot; In fact , much to the displeasure of consumer groups , the President ' s health plan would have restricted medical malpractice victims from going_to court against negligent providers ; allowed negligent physicians to hold onto money owed victims and pay in installments ; limited incentives for plaintiff attorneys to take medical malpractice cases by restricting their fees but not defense_attorney fees ; and forced taxpayers to pay_for negligent physicians ' mistakes . For those of us concerned about deterring medical malpractice , at a time when Harvard medical experts report that medical negligence has become the third-leading cause of preventable death in the United States , the failure of these anti-consumer &quot; legal reforms &quot; is no disappointment . Similar restrictions in California have denied injured patients in the San Fernando Valley legal_representation and fair compensation for their losses , while clearly not reducing the state ' s health_care costs . A Panorama City woman with severe jaw damage and a cancerous infection due_to an HMO ' s misdiagnosis and refusal to treat her has been unable to find a lawyer to represent her due_to state legal restrictions . But the woman has carried_on the case alone while the federal_government , which has recognized the injuries caused by the medical negligence as a disability , pays_for her medical_care and basic needs through taxpayer-funded programs because the woman can no longer work . Similarly , a newborn at a Woodland Hills HMO facility was crippled because , despite his mother ' s warning about her &quot; high-risk &quot; delivery , no doctor was present during the birth , only a nurse-midwife who lacked the skill to guide the newborn out . The crippled child , due_to state caps on a victim ' s compensation and barriers to prosecution , received only $ 250 # 000 for life . More troubling to the parents , the HMO has continued its practice of not assigning doctors to births undeterred -- with dozens of other children seriously injured through the same circumstances . This is the declining quality of care Americans can expect if the &quot; legal reform &quot; agenda of Sybert , and of Clinton , is enacted .
