   <HEADLINE> EPA ASKED TO LIGHTEN RULES IN CLEAN-AIR PLAN ; ENVIRONMENT : LOCAL POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT ' S STATEMENT SAYS FEDERAL PROPOSAL COULD DAMAGE VENTURA COUNTY ECONOMICALLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County air quality officials are asking the federal_government to back_off on several severe measures included in a proposed plan to clean_up the county ' s air , saying the measures could ruin the local economy . The harshest measures to curtail local air_pollution sources could force factories to reduce output and drive small trucking firms out of business , the officials say in the county ' s first formal position statement on a proposed federal plan due_to go_into effect early next year . &quot; You ' re looking_at production cutbacks , laying people off or relocating out of the county , &quot; said Bill Mount , assistant manager of the Ventura County Air_Pollution Control District and overseer of local plans for clean air . &quot; that ' s not good for Ventura County . But if you put that type of a burden on business , what other choice do they have ? &quot; Mount and the staff -- siding with county businesses and agriculture in seeking less stringent federal rules -- also recommend in a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that regulations to limit air pollutants in pesticides be phased_in over time . They also are asking that fees on shipping at the Port of Hueneme be removed and surcharges to discourage industrial pollution eliminated in favor of positive incentives to reduce emissions . But the district also called_for tougher controls in other areas . Regulations on private car smog checks , train locomotives , shipping in the Santa Barbara Channel and supply boats to offshore oil_rigs should be more stringent , the district contends . The district ' s written comments on the EPA ' s proposed program will be discussed Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors and the Air_Pollution Control_Board , which includes the board and city representatives . The supervisors will also consider whether to approve their own position statement objecting to several of the same provisions and encouraging consideration of the local plan . The EPA is accepting written comments on the plan through the end of August , and expects to issue its final document in February 1995 . Many of the district ' s proposals parallel those in a local alternative plan developed by the Ventura County Economic Development Assn . and the local Council on Economic Vitality in conjunction with the air_pollution district . Robert E . Paulger , co-chair of the Council on Economic Vitality , said he was pleased that the district offered support for the local plan . &quot; We are really in favor of the enhanced ( smog check ) program , &quot; he said . &quot; We have to get a substantially increased reduction from automobiles. &quot; He called the development of the local plan a &quot; monumental piece_of_work and an extraordinary coming_together of all aspects of the community : the ( air_pollution ) agency , business and environmentalists. &quot; Paulger said he was disappointed , however , that the air_pollution district did not take a position on one of the most controversial measures in the local plan , which would ask the state to impose fees on individual motorists based on the number of miles they drive and the amount of pollution their cars produce . The EPA issued the proposed federal implementation plan in February under court_order , six years after the Citizens to Preserve the Ojai sued the agency . The Citizens contended that the EPA should not have approved a local air quality plan that did not meet federal health standards for clean air . The federal implementation plan also covers Sacramento and Los Angeles , which were also sued by environmental groups . The most contested provision of the plan would require industry to reduce its emissions yearly , without allowing credit for reductions already made . &quot; We already have some of the toughest rules_in the country and most of our sources are already operating with the best available technology , &quot; Mount said . &quot; The sources that have already done the most to reduce emissions would be penalized. &quot; The federal plan should also allow industry to continue trading emission reductions , the district says . It was through that program that Procter &amp; Gamble was able to expand its Oxnard plant by buying emission reduction credits from 3M , which had voluntarily reduced its pollution well beyond the level required . 3M then donated the money paid by Procter &amp; Gamble to create a new clean-air fund in the county to help reduce pollution . Rather than place so_much emphasis on stationary sources of pollutants , the plan should require mobile sources to pick_up more of their share of the burden , the district contends . The smog check program in the state should be reorganized so that cars are checked at centralized locations with sophisticated equipment that provides a truer picture of tail-pipe emissions when the car is running . Those shops would be state monitored and would offer inspections only with out repairs . &quot; That eliminates the possibility of conflict_of_interest , &quot; Mount said . In addition , ocean shipping lanes that handle large tanker and container_ship traffic should be moved outside the Channel Islands , the district recommends . Those ships now travel through the Santa Barbara Channel , allowing their emissions to move onshore into the county . The large boats that supply materials and shuttle crews to the offshore oil_rigs along the Ventura and Santa Barbara coast should also be regulated , as they contribute a substantial amount of nitrogen_oxide emissions . The EPA plan should also allow more credit for reductions in emissions already made by Southern California Edison at its two county plants . The plants have been reducing emissions since passage of a strict new regulation imposed locally that required 90 % cuts_in pollution . But a surcharge on vessels calling_at Port Hueneme should be eliminated , since the port is &quot; too small to regulate &quot; and the charges could discourage use of the county ' s only deep-water port , the district said . And a plan that would require large trucks to make only one stop within the county per trip or convert to clean-fuel engines by 1999 is too tough , and would hurt local businesses , the district said . Instead , the regulation should allow the clean-fuel trucks to be phased_in , and should begin first with the larger fleets and then pick_up the smaller operations . Controls on pesticides , which contain spreading agents that cause air pollutants , should be imposed in such a manner that allows California enough time to adopt statewide regulations . In addition , manufacturers should be able to trade reductions with other manufacturers . For instance , a manufacturer that reduces pollutants by 75 % in one product should be allowed to sell credits to another company that makes a pesticide critical to agriculture . Carolyn Leavens , newly installed president of the Ventura County Economic Development Assn . and a rancher in the county , applauded the district ' s comments and cooperation with agriculture . &quot; It ' s bad enough when you pit California farmers against all_the other farmers in the country , with the stringent requirements we have here . But if you also pit some of the growers in California against the rest of California growers , that ' s compounding the felony. &quot; If the EPA accepts the district recommendations , it will be &quot; win-win for everybody . We ' re working with standards that we can all live with , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
