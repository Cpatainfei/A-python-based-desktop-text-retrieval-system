   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO SEEK SANCTIONS IF N . KOREA STALLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration has decided to seek some form of international economic sanctions against North_Korea if Pyongyang continues to flout international nuclear_weapons inspectors , and the United States will soon begin sounding_out its allies about possible_action , officials said Wednesday . The effort would be launched only if the U.N.-affiliated International Atomic Energy Agency , which is conducting the inspections , formally declares that Pyongyang ' s rebuffs have destroyed inspectors ' ability to determine if North_Korea has diverted fuel to make nuclear_weapons . The Vienna-based agency is expected to issue its report late this week or early next , but U.S. officials said they are assuming it will declare North_Korea out of compliance unless Pyongyang reverses itself soon . North_Korea issued another statement Wednesday saying it will not allow inspectors the access they want . But U.S. officials said privately that they believe that Pyongyang is still considering the international agency ' s demands . &quot; The ball is in their court , &quot; one strategist here said . The consensus on the U.S. approach was achieved by top Administration national security policy-makers before President Clinton left for Europe , where he is scheduled to take_part in a commemoration by the Allies of the 50th anniversary of D-day . Although Clinton left Washington on Wednesday morning , Administration officials continued to discuss the issue late into the afternoon . The President is expected to receive periodic briefings . Officials said initial U.S. soundings of allies are likely to begin Friday , when Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert Gallucci is scheduled to meet here with envoys from South_Korea and Japan . U.S. officials said the central questions are how the sanctions should be structured and how tough they can be and still win approval of the U.N. Security_Council . Washington may have to settle for a gradual imposition of sanctions , particularly as China has opposed punishing North_Korea formally . U.S. officials said they are still unsure how Beijing would vote on the issue . The State_Department , while rejecting Pyongyang ' s statement as unacceptable , continued to hold_out hope publicly that North_Korea would agree to comply with the atomic_energy agency ' s demands . &quot; There is no IAEA conclusion yet that North_Korea has crossed the line of no return , &quot; Christine Shelly , the State_Department ' s deputy spokesman , told reporters Wednesday . She said North_Korea still has a chance to change its mind . At the same time , Vice_President Al Gore told reporters that the Administration &quot; will not flinch &quot; in its showdown with the North . &quot; We ' re not rattling sabers -- we ' re just saying the same thing that American administrations have been saying since the 1950s , &quot; he said . Administration officials said they are still puzzled_over North_Korea ' s intentions -- whether it is trying to cover_up a nuclear_weapons program or merely playing a cat-and-mouse game in hopes of prodding the West into offering more economic incentives . U.S. intelligence officials said North_Korea may well have developed one or two nuclear bombs by reprocessing spent fuel rods after it shut_down its reactor at Yongbyon briefly in 1989 . But they are uncertain any weapons have been manufactured . North_Korea had agreed to allow international inspectors to monitor the Yongbyon reactor earlier this year but later barred them from entry . David Hannay , Britain ' s U.N. ambassador , told reporters that although &quot; there is no smoking gun &quot; at Yongbyon , &quot; there is circumstantial_evidence that points in one direction -- and that is not a direction that makes the Security_Council comfortable. &quot; Whether the council is asked to vote on sanctions , he said , &quot; depends_on the North_Koreans . They have a choice. &quot;</TEXT>
