   <TEXT> Tens of thousands of seals along Namibia ' s desert coastline have died in the worst disaster on record to hit the country ' s Cape Fur_seal colonies . Teams of workers Friday started clearing_away rotting carcasses of seal pups , which apparently starved to death . The fisheries ministry said that &quot; unusual oceanographic conditions &quot; had profoundly affected the fish on which the 750 # 000 Cape Fur_seals feed along the southwest coast of Africa . Ministry scientists estimated that more_than 70 # 000 pups died in Wolf and Atlas bays near the diamond center of Luderitz , where 70 % of Namibia ' s seals breed .</TEXT>
