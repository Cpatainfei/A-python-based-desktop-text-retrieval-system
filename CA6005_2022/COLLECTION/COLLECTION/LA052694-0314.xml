   <HEADLINE> PENTAGON IGNORED SIGNS OF TOXIC ATTACKS , REPORT SAYS ; GULF WAR : SEN . RIEGLE DEMANDS ACCESS TO DATA ON CHEMICAL , BIOLOGICAL AGENT DETECTION . DEFENSE OFFICIAL INSISTS THAT IRAQ DID NOT DEPLOY SUCH WEAPONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pentagon officials have been concealing or ignoring evidence that tens of thousands of U.S. Persian_Gulf_War veterans were exposed to Iraqi chemical and biological weapons during the conflict , a Senate report released Wednesday contends . Sen . Donald W . Riegle Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , chairman of the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee , which interviewed more_than 600 veterans in preparing its report , demanded that the Pentagon declassify all information relating to the detection of chemical and biological agents . Riegle recalled the Pentagon ' s reluctance to release information on Agent_Orange after the Vietnam_War and raised doubts about the effectiveness of devices used in the field to detect the presence of chemical_agents . In a letter sent to Persian_Gulf_War veterans Wednesday , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry and Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , said , &quot; There is no information , classified or unclassified , that indicates that chemical or biological weapons were used in the Persian Gulf. &quot; But veterans ' testimony in the Senate report suggests that chemical and biological contamination was widespread . Operation_Desert_Storm soldiers described 10 incidents of Iraqi rocket attacks that released noxious fumes or set_off chemical_agent alarms , as well as several encounters with irritating chemicals in the air . About 12 # 000 veterans have reported symptoms ranging from skin irritation to memory_loss , claiming that they are victims of &quot; Gulf War Syndrome. &quot; In one incident , eyewitnesses recounted their experiences during the early hours of Jan . 19 , 1991 , when an explosion near the port of Jubayl in Saudi_Arabia sent U.S. troops in a naval construction battalion scurrying for cover . When soldiers emerged from their bomb_shelter , some reported a numbness or a burning sensation on their skin . One soldier who tested the area for chemical_agents that evening reported that two of three tests had positive readings . At a hearing of Riegle ' s committee Wednesday , Pentagon officials said Iraq did not deploy chemical or biological toxins , even though hundreds of chemical alarms were triggered during the war . In some cases , the sensors may have malfunctioned , the officials said , and in others the alarms were discounted after further review . Defense Undersecretary Edwin Dorn said there is some concern , however , about the possibility that soldiers could have been exposed to low levels of chemical_warfare agents or fallout in Kuwait and southern Iraq as a result of Allied bombing of Iraqi military_installations . Riegle accused the Pentagon of concealing or suppressing reports of toxic exposures during the conflict , saying the military Establishment has an &quot; institutional difficulty in coming_to terms with grievous decision errors . . . . I ' ve seen our government lie to us before in other war situations. &quot; Army chemical data included in the Senate report indicates that U.S. chemical detectors may_not have been sensitive enough to register very low levels of certain agents , such_as the nerve_gas sarin , which can still be harmful if soldiers are exposed to it over long periods . Last July , the Czech minister of defense announced that a chemical decontamination unit from his country had detected low levels of sarin in Saudi_Arabia early in the Gulf War . Symptoms commonly associated with sarin include respiratory problems and chest_pain , which many veterans reported . Dorn acknowledged that physicians have been unable to diagnose symptoms of at least 2 # 000 veterans , many of whom claim to have Gulf War Syndrome . &quot; I understand the fear and the frustration that many veterans are experiencing , &quot; Dorn said . &quot; They are_sick , and their doctors can ' t offer definitive answers. &quot; One of those who has suffered since the war is Dean V . Lundholm Jr . of Live_Oak , Calif. , who served with an Army National_Guard unit . Since returning from Saudi_Arabia in 1991 , Lundholm has been so beset by respiratory and digestive problems that he has been unable to work . &quot; I served my country willingly and proudly , &quot; said Lundholm , who founded the California Assn . of Persian_Gulf Veterans , at a National Institutes of Health hearing last month . &quot; But I now expect my country to treat me and other war vets with respect and concern . And that means we vets should get information , diagnosis and treatment about our health status. &quot; Copies of Lundholm ' s testimony were distributed at Wednesday ' s hearing . Recently , the Pentagon has also considered the possibility that experimental vaccines administered to soldiers to combat chemical weapon attacks may have led to some veterans ' symptoms . A panel of experts led by Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg is re-examining evidence of chemical weapon exposure for the Defense_Department and is expected to report its findings next month , Dorn said .</TEXT>
