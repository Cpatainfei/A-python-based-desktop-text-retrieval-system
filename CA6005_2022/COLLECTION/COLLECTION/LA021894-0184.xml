   <HEADLINE> TATARSTAN REACHES PACT WITH MOSCOW , DROPS SOVEREIGNTY BID</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tatarstan , an oil-rich republic whose struggle for independence threatened to unravel Russia , has dropped its claim of sovereignty in exchange for a go-ahead from Moscow to manage and trade many of its own resources . The landmark compromise , published here Thursday , was hailed by leaders on both sides as a model for settling Moscow ' s unstable relations with the 88 constituent parts of the giant , ethnically diverse Russian Federation . Since the Soviet_Union collapsed and split into 15 nations at the end of 1991 , Russia , the largest of them , has lived under threat of a similar breakup as its regions and republics clamored for more local control . Until recently , the struggle appeared to be going the locals ' way . Tatarstan -- a Volga_River republic of 3.6 million people , nearly half of them Muslim , Turkic-speaking Tatars -- was one of the boldest , withholding tax_revenue from Moscow and controlling the export of nearly one-fifth of its 25-million-ton annual oil output . A turning point came_in December when Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin won a nationwide referendum on a new constitution that strengthens rule from Moscow . Voters also gave unexpected support in parliamentary elections to ultranationalists bent_on crushing autonomy movements . Convinced that it was time for a deal , Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaimiyev spent six weeks negotiating the treaty that he and Yeltsin signed Tuesday . The treaty recognized both Russia ' s constitution and one adopted by Tatarstan ' s voters in a 1992 referendum asserting self-rule . But the treaty itself dropped the Tatar leaders ' previous claims of &quot; sovereignty &quot; and separate status . It described the republic as &quot; united &quot; with Russia . In turn , Russia recognized Tatarstan ' s right to manage natural_resources and state enterprises on its territory except for &quot; objects of federal ownership &quot; to be defined later . Tatarstan may also conduct foreign trade and exempt its young_men from the Russian army draft under a program of alternative civilian service . The treaty appears to recognize much of the economic control Tatarstan has seized in the last two years while giving Moscow final say over distribution of tax_revenue . &quot; Russia yielded , let ' s say , the ambitions of the center to decide everything in Moscow , and will leave to the republic a larger sum of tax_revenues , &quot; said Sergei M . Shakhrai , Russia ' s nationalities minister . Vasily N . Likhachev , Tatarstan ' s vice_president , said that his republic controls , and now expects to keep , 83 % of all state-owned property on its territory , including a share of plants that turn_out helicopters , strategic bombers and heavy trucks . He said Tatarstan will also press for control of a bigger share of its oil resources . Shakhrai said the &quot; methodology &quot; of the treaty -- settling specific local concerns rather than broad sovereignty demands -- could be applied to other rebellious areas within Russia , such_as Chechnya , which has declared independence and built its own army , and Kaliningrad , which has declared itself a customs-free zone . Hard-line nationalists in Moscow and Tatarstan criticized the treaty . Sergei N . Baburin rose in the Parliament in Moscow to ridicule the fact that &quot; for the first time the state signed a treaty with part of itself. &quot; He said the separate deals Moscow will now have to make with each constituent territory will weaken Russia . In the republic ' s capital , Kazan , where the mighty Tatar state fell to the Russian army in 1552 , the nationalist Tatar Public Center called the treaty &quot; a step backward from independence. &quot; The treaty paves the way for elections next month to add Tatarstan ' s deputies to the Parliament already sitting in Moscow . The republic , along with Chechnya , boycotted the December vote . Ferit Agi of the Tatar-language service of Radio Liberty , based in Munich , Germany , said Tatar leaders felt compelled to sign a treaty with Moscow after Russian nationalists , including one elected from Tatarstan , gained their stronghold in Parliament . Tatars were also aware of their dependence on Russia for rubles , orders for their military factories and the pipeline through which they ship oil to Hungary . &quot; Russia had to give a little bit to Tatarstan to help bring some_other republics into line , &quot; Agi said . &quot; But Tatarstan knew that Russia could close the pipeline at any time. &quot; Sergei L . Loiko of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
