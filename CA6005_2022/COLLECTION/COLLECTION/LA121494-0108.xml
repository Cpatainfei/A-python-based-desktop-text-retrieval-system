   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; THE CUTTING_EDGE ; STANDARDS FOR QUALITY MAY BE COMPUTERS ' NEXT ADVANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The personal_computer industry remained divided Tuesday over the significance of the flaw in Intel ' s Pentium microprocessor , but hardware and software companies will probably be united soon on the need to improve product quality and reliability standards and to better serve less-sophisticated consumers . Computer makers have long been accustomed to racing to market with the latest innovations , and some industry executives acknowledge that that has often resulted in unfinished , unreliable and bug-ridden products reaching the market . As PCs move_into the home , they are increasingly being purchased by consumers who aren ' t aware of this history -- and aren ' t much interested in $ 3 # 000 machines that don ' t work properly . That reality is part of the reason that a flaw in the Pentium chip that Intel regarded_as insignificant has become something of a scandal . IBM said Monday that it would stop shipping Pentium machines , though most other PC manufacturers , along with Microsoft Corp. , are backing Intel ' s claim that most PC users need not worry . But even if the Pentium dispute blows_over , the broader issue will not . In a survey of nearly 100 # 000 readers reported last month in PC World , an industry publication , 44 % of the respondents said they had at least one problem with their computers , and 6.7 % said their computers were &quot; dead on arrival. &quot; &quot; In any other industry this would be unacceptable , &quot; scolds Rick Thoman , an IBM senior_vice_president , in speeches around the country . Competitive pressures are partly responsible . &quot; Intel is rushing to get new generations of products out_to stay ahead of the competition , &quot; says Michael Cusumano , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who has studied corporate efforts to improve software quality . &quot; They back themselves into a corner with their short delivery times. &quot; Software , which is basically a set of logical instructions that controls the functions of everything from missiles to microprocessors and telephone_systems , has always faced problems as new improvements have been offset by the software ' s growing size and complexity . It is often nearly impossible to predict what will cause a software program to go awry . Capers Jones , a Burlington , Mass. , expert on software productivity , likes to tell the story about an American jet fighter that would turn upside-down every time it crossed the Equator because of a flaw in its software . Although leading computer , telecommunications and software companies have substantially improved the quality of their software over the past decade , Jones says , the average piece of software is still &quot; embarrassingly bad. &quot; Quality problems , which are serious enough in critical business applications , are being magnified a thousandfold as computers are sold to millions of consumers who aren ' t accustomed to defects in spanking-new products . Microsoft announced Tuesday , for example , that it was making available a &quot; patch &quot; for the Pentium chip that would prevent it from causing errors on its Excel spreadsheet program . But customers who want the fix have to download it from an on-line service . that ' s easy for a technically astute user . But a novice may wonder why he has to spend his own valuable time figuring_out how to get_onto a computer_network so he can download fixes for a brand-new computer . To prepare its products better for the expanding consumer market , Microsoft has revamped its approach to testing new products to make_sure those that make their way onto the desktops of novices will be easy to use and relatively flaw-free . &quot; The tolerance people have for things not working is much lower &quot; among novices , says Carl Stork , director of Microsoft ' s Windows hardware program . Microsoft has delayed delivery of its new operating_system , Windows95 , for more_than a year , in part to put it through a vigorous testing program . Stork says Microsoft hopes to have Windows95 at the quality level more typical of a third-generation product when it is released to the public . Although individual companies may implement rigorous quality-control programs , there is still no objective standard on which consumers can judge products . Garr Di Salvo , senior project leader for electronics at Consumers Union , the publisher of Consumer Reports , says that after years of effort , Consumer Reports still hasn ' t found an effective way to grade personal_computer systems . &quot; The industry is very dynamic . Perhaps too dynamic , &quot; says Di Salvo .</TEXT>
