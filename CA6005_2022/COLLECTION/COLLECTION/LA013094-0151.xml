   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; WHY THE ' SCHINDLER ' S LIST ' BACKLASH ? ; CHARGES THAT THE HOLOCAUST HAS BEEN ' SPIELBERGIZED ' MAY CONCEAL THE DEEPER BELIEF THAT IT SHOULDN ' T BE DRAMATIZED AT ALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; has won the best picture award from all three major film critics ' societies , so it ' s not surprising a backlash should set_in . Highly acclaimed movies usually inspire counterinsurgencies , and sometimes the back talk is even justified : Critics groups , along with the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences , have a way of favoring the safe and respectable over the innovative and the disreputable . But the &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; backlash is somewhat unique for appearing to be less a corrective to the overpraise than a cry of betrayal . It ' s one thing to argue that &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; is something less than a masterpiece . I would concur in that . As powerful as it is , it ' s a bit too buffed and noble , it doesn ' t have the clarifying transcendence of great art . But the outrage goes_deeper . What the naysayers are saying is that Steven Spielberg has , in the words of the Village Voice ' s Jim Hoberman , &quot; Spielbergized &quot; the Holocaust . He ' s made &quot; a feel-good entertainment about the ultimate feel-bad experience of the 20th Century. &quot; Hoberman -- who at least has the distinction , along with the New Republic ' s Leon Wieseltier , of writing the film ' s best knock -- also writes : &quot; The poster of a father grasping a child ' s hand is not the only aspect of ' Schindler ' s List ' that recalls ' E.T. ' &quot; Frank Rich , in the New York Times , refers to the scene where Oskar Schindler &quot; gives a sentimental speech to the Jewish factory_workers he saved , and they look_up at him awe-struck , as if he were the levitating mother ship in ' Close Encounters of the Third Kind. ' &quot; ( Wieseltier ' s piece is titled &quot; Close Encounters of the Nazi Kind. &quot; ) Excepting Ben Kingsley ' s Jewish accountant , Rich describes the other Jewish characters as &quot; generic &quot; -- &quot; as forgettable as the chorus in a touring company of ' Fiddler on the Roof ' or , for that matter , the human dino-fodder of ' Jurassic Park. ' &quot; One would like to put these critics to the test : If it could be rigged to show that an unremarked young American or British director had made &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; would the references_to the mother ship in &quot; Close Encounters &quot; or &quot; E.T. &quot; spring so readily to mind ? One of the real-life Schindler survivors said of Schindler , &quot; He was our everything , our mother , our father , our savior , &quot; and her remark is representative . This closing moment in the movie is appropriately full of awe because so were the Jews in the presence of the man who finally saved them . Can anybody look_at this film and seriously assume Spielberg invested the same emotional energy in characterizing its Jewish protagonists as he did_in knocking_over the screamers in &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; ? Rich wishes that the Schindler Jews were as &quot; individually and intimately dramatized as Anne Frank or even Meryl Streep ' s &quot; Sophie , &quot; but , of course , Anne Frank is symbolic if any human_being ever were , and , as long as we ' re overcorrecting , Sophie the Auschwitz survivor was Gentile , not Jewish . This &quot; generic &quot; rap against the Jews in &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; doesn ' t allow_for its many piercing moments of human loss . How can it be said that the Jewish maid of the mad Nazi Amon Goeth is just a generic blur ? Her hair-trigger terror around Goeth , her shuddering self-will , is entirely specific to her predicament . When the Jewish servant boy of Goeth is at first &quot; pardoned &quot; for failing to remove a bathtub ring and then , almost as an afterthought , shot in the back , the moment is casually horrific . Like so_much in the film , the death belongs_to the individual but it has a collective horror . There ' s no way to dramatize the Holocaust without invoking this collectivity ; each death assumes millions . Behind these criticisms may lie the deeper conviction that the Holocaust should not be dramatized at all -- by anybody ; that however one does so is a disservice , an obscenity . This is not a new concept . Jonathan Kirsch , in his pan of &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; in the Jewish Journal , quotes Theodor Adorno : &quot; After Auschwitz , to write a poem is barbaric. &quot; That may be so , but isn ' t it also essential ? And can one rule_out dramatizations of the Holocaust as somehow beyond the grasp of art without also ruling_out all dramatizations of life ' s horrors ? Is &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; any less defensible than , say , &quot; Gettysburg &quot; ? Kirsch compares the scene in the film where a trainload of women are mistakenly routed to Auschwitz to &quot; The Perils of Pauline. &quot; Fearing they will be gassed , the women are shaved and herded into the showers . But they are not gassed . Hoberman calls the sequence , with its &quot; thriller suspense and last-minute rescue , &quot; the film ' s &quot; nadir. &quot; So now Spielberg ' s narrative gifts -- the same gifts that brought him to the preeminent position to make a Holocaust movie , in black-and-white , in Hollywood -- are being held against him . ( Charles Dickens employed suspense and last-minute rescues for emotional effect too . Why the double_standard ? ) The sequence in_question actually happened -- it ' s there in the Thomas Keneally book from which it ' s adapted -- but its expansion in the movie is denounced as a way of giving aid and comfort to the enemy . &quot; Why , &quot; asks Kirsch , &quot; did ( Spielberg ) play_out an elaborate scene in which the fundamental premise of the Holocaust deniers -- no gas_chambers actually existed -- is played_out in vivid and explicit detail ? &quot; But Spielberg doesn ' t deny their existence . As Kirsch himself notes , in the next scene we see the ashes from a crematory wafting into the night sky . Is there anyone who can watch this shower scene -- which expresses the redemptive miracle these women experienced as &quot; Schindler Jews &quot; -- in the context of the entire movie and believe Auschwitz was anything but a charnel_house ? Well , the Holocaust-deniers could . But why frame your movie to refute them when logic plays no part in their thinking anyway ? &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; may deal with a monumental insanity but it should not be faulted for speaking_to the sane . Spielberg comes_out of a popular tradition of movie making that binds audiences with shared emotions -- whether it be uplift or terror . There have been great renderings of the Holocaust -- ranging from from the documentaries &quot; Night and Fog &quot; and &quot; Shoah &quot; to Primo Levi ' s &quot; Survival in Auschwitz &quot; and Art Spiegelman ' s &quot; Maus &quot; -- that were not pitched for the mass audience . Spielberg , however , at his best , is a popular entertainer with a gift -- a genius -- for moving audiences simply and directly . ( At his worst he ' s a nerveless enchanter. ) There is nothing esoteric or ruminative about &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Like Keneally ' s extraordinary book , the film works_up its power by an inexorable accumulation of events that adds_up to a complete vision of hell . Spielberg ' s popularized technique in this film is there to make us see more of that vision , not less . And he doesn ' t popularize indiscriminately . We are never made to understand why Oskar Schindler , the Nazi war profiteer , risked his life to save more_than 1 # 200 Jews ; there is no defining Aha ! moment that accounts_for his heroism . It ' s a mystery , and Spielberg , like Keneally , honors that mystery by refusing to &quot; explain &quot; it . He also doesn ' t try to &quot; explain &quot; Amon Goeth , for to do so would be to &quot; explain &quot; the vicious riddle of Nazism -- a riddle far greater than Schindler ' s . Writing of the film in the Jewish daily newspaper the Forward , Ilene Rosenzweig says , &quot; Given a chance to project to the world an image of Jewish life , Hollywood ' s undisputed box-of fice king chooses one of humiliation and death. &quot; In a commentary on the film in The Times , Rabbi Eli Hecht wrote , &quot; I am_sick and tired_of this generation identifying Judaism with suffering. &quot; In other words , it is bad PR to express the sufferings of the Jewish people ; better to forget . This is a dreamland concoction far more dangerous and denying than anything Spielberg is accused of . ( And , in this age of ethnic cleansing , it also implies the lessons of the Holocaust only apply to Jews. ) As one Times reader wrote in response to the rabbi ' s piece , &quot; Does Rabbi Hecht propose that , as Jews , we let Passover and Purim rest along with the Holocaust ? &quot; Should &quot; Never Again &quot; become &quot; Never Mind &quot; ? It ' s also considered bad PR for a movie about the Holocaust to feature a non-Jew . &quot; Unafraid to accentuate the positive , &quot; writes Hoberman , &quot; ' Schindler ' s List ' necessarily focuses_on Gentiles. &quot; Rosenzweig writes , &quot; A reluctant Christian rescuer is a curious choice for Hollywood ' s definitive Holocaust hero. &quot; This is an argument based on the needs of propaganda , not drama . Schindler saved over 1 # 200 Jewish lives , and the survivors ' offspring account_for many thousands more ; he was honored as a Righteous Gentile in Jerusalem ' s Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum . The concept of the Righteous Gentile in Rabbinic literature predates Maimonides -- it needs no defense now . Rosenzweig sums_up &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; as a &quot; feel good movie of Christian redemption and Jewish defeat. &quot; But this assumes that Schindler ' s fate and the fate of the Jews were not entwined ; that their redemption was not mutual . Is it blasphemous to suggest that one can feel happiness at the end of a Holocaust movie if , in the end , thousands of Jews are saved ? Their rescue does not deny the fate of the 6 million who were not rescued . Quite the contrary : &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; derives its power precisely from how abjectly exceptional its story is . The most damning criticism made against the film is that it gussies up the Holocaust by framing it as a scenario of salvation . But lives were saved . They , too , deserve -- even require -- memorialization .</TEXT>
