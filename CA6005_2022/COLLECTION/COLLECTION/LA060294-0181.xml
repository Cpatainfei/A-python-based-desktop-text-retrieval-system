   <HEADLINE> TUNNELING TO THE PAST ; RED_LINE WORKER UNEARTHS FOSSILS OF ANIMALS THAT ROAMED HOLLYWOOD AREA MORE THAN 10 # 000 YEARS AGO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michael Guinther ' s scientific instincts run deep . About 60 feet deep . Guinther , a worker on the Metro Red_Line subway , has found four prehistoric fossils within a two-month period while boring tunnels beneath Hollywood Boulevard . His discoveries -- teeth of a mastodon and a camel , leg and toe bones of a horse and the foot of an ancient bison -- all are at least 10 # 000 years old , and possibly up_to 200 # 000 years old . Experts said Wednesday that the finds could well be the first of their kind in the Hollywood area , a_few miles northeast of the La Brea Tar_Pits , where similar remains have been unearthed for years . &quot; It fills_in the record . . . of where these animals were living and dying and being deposited , &quot; said Christopher Shaw , collection manager at the George C . Page Museum at the tar_pits . &quot; It gives us more of the L.A. Basin to be able to interpret. &quot; Guinther -- who , fittingly , works the graveyard_shift in the tunnels anywhere from 40 to 80 feet below the Earth ' s surface -- could not be reached for comment Wednesday . But the way his bosses at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority tell it , he stumbled upon the leg and toe bones of a prehistoric horse March 8 , nearly 50 feet below the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue . Then , as the tunnels proceeded westward beneath Hollywood Boulevard , Guinther found a second fossil -- part of a mastodon molar -- on March 31 , followed just a_few days later by the discovery of the bison forefoot beneath Gramercy Avenue . Finally , on April 20 , about 76 feet below the Hollywood Freeway , he came_across molars from an ancient species of camel that was once common in North_America but is now extinct . &quot; He has a good eye , &quot; Jim Sowell , manager of environmental compliance for the project , said of Guinther . &quot; He sees something gleam , hops down , picks it up , puts it in his lunch box and gives it to the paleontological monitor the next day. &quot; For his acute powers of observation , Guinther has been honored with a certificate of appreciation by the MTA , which encourages workers to spot and turn_in fossils or artifacts . &quot; We try to impress upon the workers that the fossils are scientifically important , &quot; said Bruce Lander , the consultant on the project whose company catalogues the finds . Eventually , the fossils will probably be donated to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural_History . Hundreds of fossils have been uncovered since construction of the Red_Line began several years ago , most of them of marine invertebrates , Lander said . Excavation has also turned_up a cache of culturally significant artifacts , such_as cooking_utensils and porcelain from Old Chinatown that was razed half a century ago to make room for Union Station . The fossils found by Guinther closely resemble the remains of animals yielded by the tar_pits . The Pleistocene-era creatures roamed the area for thousands of years until the end of the last Ice_Age , about 10 # 000 years ago . Shaw said fossils of mastodons and camels are relatively rare in the region . The horse and bison , thought by some to be direct ancestors of modern buffalo , are more common , Shaw said .</TEXT>
