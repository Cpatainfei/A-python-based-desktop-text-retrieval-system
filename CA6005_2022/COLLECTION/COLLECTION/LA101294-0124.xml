   <HEADLINE> SHARP DROP BY RUBLE BELIES TALK OF ECONOMIC STABILITY ; RUSSIA : ONE-QUARTER FALL AGAINST DOLLAR RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT ABILITY TO CONTROL CURRENCY DURING POST-COMMUNIST REFORMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The enfeebled Russian ruble tumbled by more_than one-quarter of its value against the dollar Tuesday in a day of panicked trading that heralded greater inflation and instability just as the Kremlin seemed to have the economy nearly under_control . The ruble fell from 3 # 081 to the dollar to 3 # 926 , a record drop that prompted Russians to dub the day &quot; Black Tuesday. &quot; Overall , the ruble ' s value has been cut_in half since July . &quot; What has happened to the supposedly stabilized economy ? &quot; demanded the evening newspaper Izvestia . &quot; What can we expect tomorrow and the day after ? &quot; In a country now getting used to financial debacles , from ill-considered money swaps to massive pyramid schemes , this was one of the biggest , casting doubt on the government ' s ability to control its currency as it navigates through tricky , post-Communist economic reforms . &quot; The jump of the dollar on the currency market is a basis for throwing ( Prime_Minister Viktor S. ) Chernomyrdin into prison , &quot; prominent businessman Konstantin Borovoi fumed in print . &quot; In any other country , after such a jump of the dollar against the national currency there would be a revolution. &quot; In fact , no revolution threatened ; money-exchange booths in Moscow remained calm , and people in_line groused quietly about the speculators who were probably making fortunes off the sharp change in rate . The Central_Bank intervened in trading on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange , the country ' s largest , to keep the ruble from falling below 4 # 000 to the dollar . But the possible consequences of the ruble drop worried both Western and Russian economists deeply . &quot; The continuing sharp drop of the ruble to the dollar means an intensive crescendo of inflation , &quot; Alexander Zhukov , a member of the Russian Parliament ' s Budget Committee , told the Itar-Tass news_agency . As the dollar gains in strength , imported goods become relatively more expensive for Russians to buy with their ruble salaries , and those price hikes fuel inflation . By Tuesday evening , the new rate ' s effect could already be seen in the fresh , inflated price_tags on beer and candy in many of the city ' s kiosks . Lines in_stores and at gas_stations also lengthened as customers struggled to unload their rubles fast . Western economists warn that with the inevitable rise in prices comes a temptation for the Kremlin to print more money and issue more cheap loans to ease the burden on people . That would fuel inflation even further . &quot; Obviously what ' s happened is going_to complicate things , &quot; said a Western economic adviser to the government . &quot; Certainly there ' s been a loss of confidence -- the markets are all voting on that. &quot; &quot; If there is a retreat back to a pro-inflation psychology , to investing in the dollar and daily spending rather than saving , we will have lost this year , a difficult year of deprivations , &quot; said Alexander Livshits , a top economic adviser to President Boris N . Yeltsin . &quot; We simply cannot allow this to happen. &quot; The only winners in the ruble crash -- aside from smart speculators -- seemed to be Russia ' s exporters , the oil and metal magnates who now can offer their goods abroad at lower prices . &quot; It ' s heaven for exporters and hell for importers , &quot; said economist Pavel Bunich of the new ruble rate . Most economists said the ruble fell so sharply mainly because of panic selling , but there was also an objective reason . Beginning last month , the Central_Bank stopped propping_up the ruble by injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into the foreign_exchange market . The Central_Bank &quot; had seen the bottom of its own well , &quot; Bunich said , after it had spent more_than $ 2 billion on buying_up rubles over the last two months . Trading of the ruble , mainly for dollars and German marks , has gone_on since 1992 at the Moscow exchange , but the ruble is still not fully convertible throughout the world , and the government has kept a tight hold_on its rate . When the hold loosened , economists said , the ruble ' s fall was inevitable . Some are predicting that the ruble will rise back to about 3 # 000 to the dollar when the speculation and panic cool_down . But meanwhile , the powerful dollar has Russian importers , whose goods have suddenly skyrocketed in price , near despair . Many are simply freezing their operations until the dollar rate settles_down , Russian media reported .</TEXT>
