   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : OIL_INDUSTRY ' S MOST LASTING RESOURCE IS KNOWLEDGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Without widespread notice , a change has occurred in the world oil_business that will have long-term implications for U.S. job-seekers and investors , companies and universities . The outlook has shifted to growth . The International Energy Agency , an organization of petroleum-consuming countries set_up in the 1970s , recently forecast strong increases in energy demand from now until 2010 , with oil usage growing 4 % a year in Asia and less rapidly elsewhere . But prices will barely increase . The energy agency predicts a world oil price of $ 28 a barrel in 2010 , and other experts say it could be closer to $ 20 . Either way , allowing_for inflation in the intervening years , that would be no rise at all . That means oil and gas will be plentiful , not only in the Middle_East but in Russia , China , Vietnam and other areas of the world where vast oil deposits are only now being discovered . And U.S. industry , thanks to multiple advances in technology , will lead the way in developing and producing the oil of Russia , China and elsewhere . The industry ' s prospects are one reason oil stocks have been strong lately , while shares of other businesses have gyrated and declined . But no business is simple these days . Like all other industries affected by information technology , oil is a study in contrasts . Big companies are shedding employees ; geologists have difficulty finding work . Yet the numbers of independent oil and gas_companies are rising sharply again , after a horrendous decline in the 1980s . Because of turmoil in the U.S. industry , America ' s young people seem uncertain whether it offers opportunity . Geology enrollments at the University of Texas are_well below levels of the early ' 80s . But they have turned_up recently , thanks in part to undergraduate and graduate_students from Brazil , Indonesia , India and elsewhere , who see the oil_business now operating in their countries as high-tech , global and with a long and profitable future . In short , oil contains lessons for all business -- and a particular lesson for Southern California . First of all , it can teach the power of technology to create new opportunities and renew old ones . In the Russian Arctic , Texaco , Exxon , Amoco and Norsk Hydro , a Norwegian company , are awaiting Russian government approval to develop a 2-billion-barrel deposit . The approval is probably forthcoming , because Russia is in desperate need . Its oil_production , which led the world only a_few years ago , has fallen more_than 50 % since 1990 . &quot; It needs U.S. technology and know-how to develop its oil , &quot; says Daniel Yergin , head of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and co-author of &quot; Russia 2010 , &quot; a new book about the former Soviet_Union . Others want help too . China is inviting U.S. companies to explore the Tarim Basin in its northwestern desert . Vietnam is granting oil concessions off its shores . Those are forbidding areas . Oil can be developed economically only because supercomputers can interpret geological information faster and better , meaning fewer wells are drilled and less time is lost . Joseph Tovey of Tovey &amp; Co. , an investment bank that shares_in a concession off Vietnam , reckons oil can be found and produced there for $ 2.50 a barrel , about what it cost for North_Sea oil development 20 years ago . Back home , new oil and gas have been found in old wells in the Gulf_of_Mexico , thanks to sound-wave techniques that can &quot; see &quot; through more layers of the Earth ' s subsurface . On land , old wells are yielding new output because of better information and techniques involving steam and carbon_dioxide injection . All this is possible because more powerful computers reduce costs . &quot; We now can do_in hours what used to take weeks , &quot; says Dirk Koerber , vice_president of investor relations at Western Atlas International , a newly independent oil service_firm spun_off last month from Litton Industries . That brings_up Lesson 2 : Information technology makes low overhead essential . The cost equations in the Gulf_of_Mexico or the Arctic_Ocean make_sense only if fewer people can do more work in less time . So big companies continue to downsize -- even sell properties they cannot produce profitably , but which smaller companies can . That has helped the little guy . &quot; The number of solid , independent companies sank to only 19 in the ' 80s , &quot; says Tom Petrie of Petrie Parkman , a Denver-based investment bank . &quot; But now there are 45 good outfits like Anadarko , Apache , Louisiana Land . And the ranks are growing. &quot; Lesson 3 : Globalization brings competition along with opportunity . As the big oil_companies shift investment overseas , jobs shift also . There are exciting opportunities for geophysicists and petroleum engineers educated in U.S. universities . But for less-skilled jobs on rigs and drill_sites , local employees will be hired . And all_over the world , ambitious young people are studying for the high-skilled jobs too . The business is oil and gas , but the most valuable commodity is knowledge . &quot; Frequently , national oil_companies in other countries will send their brightest employees to study here , &quot; says Prof . William Galloway of the University of Texas ' geological sciences department . &quot; We educate them , and they work in their home country. &quot; Also , Petrie observes , &quot; Houston is still the center of the world oil_industry . Singapore and London are subcenters , but the know-how of world oil is in Houston. &quot; Houston is an object_lesson for Los Angeles and Southern California . When oil prices dropped_in the 1980s , Houston lost jobs , population , companies and real_estate values . But what remained became stronger , and what endured was knowledge . Southern California today remains a world center for knowledge in entertainment ; computer software ; aerospace science , from satellites to transport ; commerce with Asia and Mexico ; finance ; housing , and patterns of living . And knowledge has become the business of America . Whether in an oil field or a classroom , the United States is selling education and brainpower to the world . It ' s a worthy export to other countries and an essential pursuit for our own people .</TEXT>
