   <HEADLINE> MEXICO COVETS ORDER -- AND FINDS IT IN RUMOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rumor swirled through Mexico last week . Following the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the ruling party ' s presidential candidate , Mexico was filled with rumor . Rumor thrives in uncertain times as the least-enlightened tool of reason . Rumor feeds_on chaos , even as it attempts to understand chaos , to detect a design . For though the rumor may be , almost always is , of dark conspiracy , there is within rumor a hope that the core of chaos is comprehensible and worldly , even expected . Greed . Pride . Love . We Americans understand something of what Mexicans are going_through . In the aftermath of the assassination of President John F . Kennedy , rumor has become a permanent part of our political life . Whether or not Mark Lane and his fellow conspiracy theorists uncovered what &quot; really happened &quot; that November afternoon in Dallas , they have made us disrespectful of any official version . Mexican colleagues , Mexican friends , were_on the phone last week . I hear that the Mexican army is_on the move_in southern Mexico . I hear that the accused assassin is a Jehovah ' s Witness -- enraptured , visionary . I hear that the accused assassin is part of a Los Angeles brigade of leftists . I hear that the assassination of Colosio was orchestrated by the old_guard within his own party , those unhappy with changes wrought by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . For most of the century , Mexico has purchased civic peace with a one-party political_system . The Institutional Revolutionary Party , the PRI , has provided stability at the price of corruption . Mexicans are apt to complain now about the PRI , describing it as something imposed upon them . But the PRI was a Mexican invention , and true_to the authoritarianism and paternalism within the culture . Every six years , the Mexican president would emerge from a political conclave to announce his successor . Thus was democracy rendered as theater . Everyone understood that the candidate would , despite token opposition , become president . In Mexico , they never bothered to conceal the strings that made the puppets dance , and that was comforting , in a way . Corruption is comforting , in a way . And rumor , in old Mexico , was simply a matter of remarking on the visible strings . Mexicans are beginning to say publicly that the PRI has outlived its usefulness . Some Mexicans will even say publicly that Salinas , the international symbol of modernity , stole his election . But there are Mexicans who will tell you , to this day , that the PRI has worked because there is a distinctly Mexican genius to the system of party chieftains who take_care of_their_own more efficiently than the new breed of politicians -- technocrats ( many with Ph.Ds from the United States ) -- who think that a country ' s destiny can be charted and graphed , like some Harvard Business_School case study . It is odd that technology has restored rumor to realms of mystery and occult in Mexico . For all_the wires have gone underground . You needn ' t actually steal a ballot_box -- in the grand 19th-Century manner ; you need only alter the electronic tabulation . The result has the quality of miracle : The PRI wins again ! This week , Salinas stepped_forward to name the new PRI candidate for president . He named Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon , a Yale-educated economist . Rumor has it that the old_guard within the PRI is displeased with the choice . Zedillo has been in disfavor since his days as education minister , when he tried to disengage fact from fable in Mexican history books -- sensitive subjects like the Mexican-American War or the 1968 slaughter of Mexicans by the army . Traditionally , Mexico , as a country , has been wedded to myth . In Mexico , there are only four roles : the Indian , the Spaniard , the_Virgin and the gringo . Last January , when Indians in the state of Chiapas revolted against Mexico_City , Mexicans were immediately interested in the narrative possibilities posed by the insurrection . Here again was the 16th- Century myth of the Indian versus Cortes . Only this time , the Mexican government was cast in the role of Spain . Talking to Mexicans last week , I had the sense that Chiapas and the consequent sympathy for the Indian ( a sympathy that momentarily put aside anti-Indian racism throughout Mexican society ) gave Mexicans an opportunity to complain about the PRI and its corruption . An interesting rumor circulating throughout Mexico since January has it that Subcommandante Marcos , the phantom behind the Indian rebellion , is , in fact , a Jesuit priest . A Portuguese Jesuit priest . Lawrence of Mexico . ( The Virgin. ) Last week , two ex-presidents issued fatherly advice to their Mexican children . Miguel de la Madrid spoke darkly of the &quot; participation of the Mexican clergy in politics &quot; ( the Spaniard ) . And Jose Lopez Portillo , the man who , not so many years ago , brought Mexico to the brink of economic ruin , emerged from his luxurious disgrace to warn of &quot; outside forces &quot; threatening Mexico ( the gringo ) . Within the Mexican soul is the fear of disorder , a fear shaped by counter-reformation Spanish Catholicism as it was honed by anti-Catholic politicians of modern Mexico . Order . I have heard it all my life . My own Mexican father looks_at America ' s chaos on the TV screen and prescribes the Mexican solution : What the United States needs is order . Mexico has had order for seven decades . Even as Mexicans were in a frenzy wondering why Colosio was killed , Americans last week were busily speculating about Vincent W . Foster Jr. ' s relationship to Hillary Rodham Clinton , and did he really kill himself in his car or was his body transported to the park ? And who was that mysterious man who phoned the park rangers ? In the United States , for the last three decades , rumor has left us a politically passive people , cynical , skeptical of the possibility that the individual can make a difference . Such could be the fate awaiting Mexicans . On the other hand , true democracy might be born from this dusty season of rumor in Mexico . More inadmissible than any rumor heard on the streets is the possibility that no one is controlling the chaos . And : If history is not the manipulation of cabals or Jesuits or Masons or PRI loyalists or leftist cells or the CIA , then what ? Then maybe history is the responsibility of individuals to shape . Then Mexico will have entered the modern era .</TEXT>
