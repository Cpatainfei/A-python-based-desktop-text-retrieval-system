   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : MID-CITY : KOREATOWN ; BIG RIG GENERATES TALK -- AND POWER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parked on tiny White_House Place , the enormous green tractor-trailer looked_out of place Oct . 7 in the quiet residential_area near 1st Street and Vermont Avenue , moreso considering the neighborhood is part of the Los Angeles Eco-Village , a community dedicated to environmental preservation . Fortunately for the environment , this was no ordinary smoke-spewing big rig . Far from it -- the trailer attached_to the soy diesel-fueled tractor was &quot; Cyrus , &quot; a unique mobile solar electric generator developed by Greenpeace , on its last leg of an educational tour across the United States and Canada . The Eco-Village visit preceded the tour-ending stop in Wilmington the next day . Forty feet long , with 40 solar_panels and 4 1 / 2 tons of batteries capable of storing 100 # 000 watt-hours of electricity , Cyrus -- named after a legendary king of ancient Persia -- has been powering concerts , radio_broadcasts and community events nationwide since April , said Kelly Quirke , a spokesman for Greenpeace , the international environmental organization . It was originally designed to power recording_studios for the production of a benefit rock album titled &quot; Alternative NRG , &quot; released last January . &quot; We decided to take Cyrus on_the_road to demonstrate clean energy and to let people know that the barriers are political , not technical , &quot; Quirke said . &quot; This can do anything regular electricity can do. &quot; Inside the trailer-generator are educational exhibits discussing clean energy , comparing it with fossil_fuels and explaining the possible dangers associated with burning fossil_fuels . Throughout the day , students from nearby White_House Place Primary School and Virgil Avenue Middle_School streamed through the trailer for a quick lesson on solar_power . &quot; We don ' t talk to the kids about the economic side , but we do talk to them about the dangers of waste , &quot; Quirke said . Lois Arkin , who lives_in and helps organize the Eco-Village neighborhood , was glad Greenpeace could include them on the generator ' s itinerary . &quot; It ' s the first time we ' ve had a major organization here that has had a resource that our community could develop , ' she said . The man who has driven Cyrus on its route through North_America is Jim Kron , who powers his San Diego home with solar_energy . Driving around the country pulling a giant green solar generator with Greenpeace emblazoned on the side , he said , has been an enlightening experience . &quot; I ' ve gotten mixed reactions , &quot; he said . &quot; In places that are very resource-dependent , such_as logging areas , you find some antagonism . Then again , one time I was at a truck_stop in Wisconsin , working underneath the truck , and I saw these cowboy_boots approaching . I thought , ' Here we go again. ' &quot; I got_up and found_out the guy wanted to give me a hundred-dollar bill as a donation. &quot; LESLIE BERESTEIN</TEXT>
