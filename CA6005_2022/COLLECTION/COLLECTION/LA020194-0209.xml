   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; DESERT GROUP JOINS FIGHT AGAINST HAZARDOUS-WASTE BURNING ; 1ENVIRONMENT : ANTELOPE VALLEY ACTIVISTS ARE PART OF A NATIONWIDE COALITION TARGETING EIGHT SITES , INCLUDING A CEMENT PLANT NEAR GORMAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Antelope Valley group joined a nationwide coalition of activists Monday in urging federal_officials to halt the burning of hazardous waste at eight sites , including a Southern California cement plant . Desert Citizens Against Pollution was among 12 public health , environmental and waste-treatment groups that filed the petition in Washington , D . C . The document warned U . S . Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner that the groups will file a lawsuit within 60 days unless she moves to halt the waste burning . Among the eight sites targeted by the activists is the National Cement Co . plant just northeast of Gorman , near the Los Angeles-Kern county_line . Members of Desert Citizens Against Pollution have alleged that the plant is releasing toxic air emissions that may be causing health_problems among nearby residents . Sylvia Lowrance , associate deputy administrator with the EPA in Washington , said the activists ' petition &quot; is very consistent with the administration ' s position about what we should be doing regarding cement kilns . . . . We are absolutely committed to going_after these facilities when they cause some environmental problems. &quot; She said the EPA is preparing to take action before the 60-day deadline against some firms that burn hazardous waste , but she did not know if National Cement would be among these . In a prepared statement Monday , National Cement said it is legally permitted to burn hazardous waste-derived fuel . The firm said an independent study filed with the state &quot; showed the facility to be operating well within federal and state health risk guidelines. &quot; In November , the EPA said it planned to deny National Cement a permit to continue burning hazardous waste because its application lacked a signature from Tejon Ranchcorp , which leases its land to the plant . The company can continue to burn waste until a final_decision is handed_down , probably in the spring , said Virginia Donohue , a spokeswoman for the EPA ' s regional office in San Francisco . Tejon Ranchcorp ' s parent company is 30 % owned by Times Mirror Co. , which publishes the Los Angeles Times . More coverage of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys appears today on B8 .</TEXT>
