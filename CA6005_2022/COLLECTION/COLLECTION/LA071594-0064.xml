   <HEADLINE> SCIENTISTS GEAR_UP FOR BIG BANG OF COMET , JUPITER ; ASTRONOMY : AN ARMY OF SKY WATCHERS HAVE THEIR SIGHTS TRAINED ON THE PLANET . BUT THEY WON ' T GET A DIRECT VIEW OF THE CELESTIAL COLLISION BECAUSE IT IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON THE DARK SIDE , OUT OF VIEW OF EARTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the fireworks flare on the far side of Jupiter on Saturday , astronomers around the world will be straining for an indirect glimpse of the collision between a comet and the solar_system ' s largest planet , like someone outside the stadium trying to follow the Super Bowl by the roar of the crowd . Scientists and amateur astronomers will be denied a direct look_at the collision because the 21 or so fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 are expected to hit the planet ' s night side , which faces away from Earth . Instead , they will have to seek secondhand evidence of a once-in-a-lifetime celestial event : powerful ripples in the planet ' s thick atmosphere , disturbances in Jupiter ' s distinctive cloud patterns , bursts of interplanetary static caused by the impacts , and even the momentary glow from the explosive flashes reflected on Jupiter ' s many moons . While it is a daunting challenge , astronomers say they are used to constructing their views of the universe from scant data . They have inferred the existence of planets outside the solar_system by timing stellar static , detected a massive black_hole by the speed of star systems swirling around it , and heard -- in the hum of background_radiation -- the last faint echo of creation ' s Big Bang . No astronomer has ever had a chance before to watch -- even indirectly -- when a comet slams into a planet , so professional and amateur observers are marshaling a global network of telescopes , airborne observatories and space_probes throughout the solar_system to capture hints of the collision . The first piece of the fragmented comet is expected to hit Jupiter about 1 p.m. PDT Saturday , experts predict , with the second hitting about sundown and the third just before midnight . Other chunks of the comet , traveling at 130 # 000 m.p.h. , are expected to rain on Jupiter for several days , with the last piece hitting early next Friday . This weekend , the Griffith Observatory and the Los Angeles Astronomical Society are planning gatherings featuring Jupiter for amateur astronomers and the public . The observatory ' s main Zeiss telescope will be trained on Jupiter , and smaller telescopes will be set_up on the grounds for public use Saturday . The Planetary Society is gathering at the Mt . Wilson Observatory . For observatories in the Western United States , however , the most favorable viewing opportunities will not come until next week , well into the five-day bombardment . Comet experts at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory predict that sky watchers in California will have their best viewing chances late Wednesday and Thursday evenings . Even if the weather cooperates and the night skies are clear , viewing throughout North_America will be limited because most of the impacts will occur during daylight or after Jupiter has set . Although the actual impact will take_place on Jupiter ' s dark side , the impact zone will rotate into view and be visible from Earth for about five hours after each hit . Astronomers caution that no matter where on Earth an observer stands , there will be little visible to the naked eye or to most amateur telescopes . The Assn . of Lunar and Planetary Observers says that for the best results , amateurs should use a telescope with high-quality optics and at least a 10-inch aperture . Some amateur astronomers , frustrated at not being able to see the collision directly , say they will hook_up radios and listen to it instead . The U.S.-based Society of Amateur Radio Astronomers does not know what the crash will sound like , but is urging its members to tune_in . Jupiter normally emits radio_waves at frequencies between 500 kilohertz and 40 megahertz , which radio astronomers think are caused by electrons breaking free_of a magnetic bond between the planet and its moon Io . On an Earth-based short-wave radio , Jupiter ' s transmissions sound like waves crashing onto a beach . Astronomers emphasized that the collisions should have no adverse effect on Earth . &quot; There will be no changes on Earth , except among a very excited group of astronomers , &quot; JPL comet expert Donald K . Yeomans said . They aren ' t sure what to expect . Earlier sightings of comets , such_as Kohoutek in 1973 and Halley ' s comet ' s return in 1986 , did not live_up_to public expectations . Experts at the University of Arizona ' s Seward Observatory predict that the comet -- a &quot; rubble pile &quot; whose chunks are composed of hundreds , if not thousands , of small snowballs -- will disintegrate high in Jupiter ' s atmosphere , going_out with a fizzle , not a noticeable bang . Two reports in the science journal Nature this week suggest that the comet , in a deteriorating orbit around Jupiter and already torn to pieces by the planet ' s gravitational_field , will disintegrate further before it plunges into Jupiter ' s atmosphere . The comet may produce a spectacular meteor_shower , but no massive fireball . Paul Weismann , in JPL ' s Earth and Sciences Division , predicts a &quot; cosmic fizzle. &quot; A University of Chicago astrophysicist , on the other hand , predicts that the fragmented comet will create a spectacular plume of super-heated debris that will shoot hundreds of miles above Jupiter ' s multicolored clouds . His conclusions are based on elaborate computer simulations of the impacts conducted at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center . Willy Benz , an astronomer at the University of Arizona , is optimistic . &quot; Even if this impact is somewhat less spectacular than the media would like to have it , I believe that potentially much can be learned about the structure of comets and the circulation in Jupiter ' s atmosphere , &quot; he said . Slam-Dancing With Jupiter * What : A collision between the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 and Jupiter . * The comet : The remains of a comet that has broken_into a string of 21 or so chunks . Some may be more_than a mile in diameter . * The planet : Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar_system . More_than 88 # 700 miles in diameter , the planet is composed almost completely of hydrogen and helium . * First impact : 12:58 p.m. Saturday . * Last impact : 12:57 a.m. July 22 . * Best West Coast viewing : 10:24 p.m. Wednesday and 9:15 p.m. Thursday . * Where : Jupiter will be about 400 million miles from Earth when the impacts occur . * Watching from Earth : Essentially every observatory in the world . * Watching from space : Voyager 2 , Galileo , Ulysses and the Hubble space telescope . * Watching from Los Angeles : The Griffith Observatory and the Los Angeles Astronomical Society will have telescopes set_up for the public until midnight Saturday . A 40-minute lecture on the impacts will be presented at the observatory ' s planetarium at 9 p.m. Monday , and Tuesday through Friday at 4:30 p.m. All times are Pacific Daylight Time .</TEXT>
