   <HEADLINE> HIV RESEARCHERS STRUGGLE TO HIT THEIR MOVING TARGET ; DISEASE : THE VIRUS FRUSTRATES SCIENTISTS WITH ITS ABILITY TO MUTATE AND HIDE FOR LONG PERIODS IN A HOST ' S GENES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is no cure for AIDS , no good treatment to control its symptoms for long periods and no vaccine to prevent it , for one major reason : HIV , the human_immunodeficiency_virus that causes the disease , is a sloppy housekeeper when it comes_to tending its genetic_endowment . Every time HIV replicates , it makes mistakes , at least one error per generation of the virus . Within a_few generations , it can begin to take_on subtly different characteristics . By all_rights , such sloppiness should be devastating to HIV , causing it to mutate itself out of existence . Instead , it gives the virus an immense advantage in its fight for survival , not unlike the morphing android of the movie &quot; Terminator 2. &quot; Every time the Arnold Schwarzeneggers of science have the virus in their sights for destruction by a drug , it transforms into something else and shrugs the drugs off . When researchers erect a vaccine to keep the virus out of the body , it changes into a form that can slip through defenses like the Terminator slides between the bars of a fence . HIV is a moving target that is always one step ahead of scientists , says virologist Jerry Schochetman of the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention in Atlanta . &quot; As one variant is knocked_down , another pops_up , &quot; he said . &quot; The next variant is attacked , but the virus continues to keep changing and escaping . . . . Eventually the virus wins. &quot; It is this mutability , combined with the ability of the virus to hide in genes -- undetected by the host -- for long periods , that makes HIV such a difficult and deadly opponent , experts say . &quot; This is one of the meanest viruses of them all , &quot; said G . Kirk Raab , president and chief_executive_officer of Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco , which is working_on a number of approaches to AIDS drugs . And it is that inherent difficulty that has slowed the search for an AIDS therapy and vaccine to what many consider a crawl . &quot; The classical approach to new diseases is to identify a viral agent and develop a vaccine , &quot; said Irvin S . Y . Chen , director of the UCLA AIDS Center . &quot; that ' s been the case for all_the viruses that we know . For AIDS , we thought early on that we would be able to do the same thing . It hasn ' t turned_out to be that easy because these properties make_it different from all_the other viruses. &quot; Said Dr. Jay Levy of UC San Francisco , &quot; It is a very difficult ( virus ) to figure out. &quot; Levy should know , because he has been probing HIV from the time of its discovery about 11 years ago . It is widely acknowledged in the scientific community that Levy , unheralded and largely unfunded , isolated and identified the virus that causes AIDS in late 1983 , only to be beaten into print by Dr. Robert Gallo and Dr. Luc Montagnier . &quot; I guess I held_off ( on publishing results ) too long , &quot; he says cheerfully , albeit a bit ruefully . Levy ' s is one of the relatively few laboratories in the country that emphasizes study of the basic science of the virus , rather than concentrating solely on finding a cure or vaccine . Indeed , since the virus was discovered there has been little progress toward finding the &quot; magic_bullet &quot; to cure or prevent AIDS , as HIV continues to claim succeeding generations of victims . Levy and others now believe that a better understanding of how the virus works will lead to new ways to control it . With a team of 20 postdoctoral researchers and technicians and a budget of nearly $ 1 million per year , he is continuing his long quest_for an answer to AIDS . On the 12th floor of the medical_center , they are examining the virus ' strengths , probing it for weaknesses and deciphering its genetics in half_a_dozen projects that typify HIV research around the country . The HIV that Levy is studying is , like all viruses , a wispy organism that is neither inanimate nor fully living , but somewhere in between . Strictly speaking , viruses are not alive because they do not consume food for energy and cannot reproduce without assistance . Viruses are simply small bundles of genetic information encapsulated in a protective protein coat and a viral membrane stolen from the last cell they visited . They are extremely simple , containing as few as four genes or perhaps as_many as a dozen , compared to the estimated 100 # 000 genes necessary to describe a human . But their power is disproportionate to their size . They attack by sneaking into cells and hijacking the host ' s protein- and gene-producing machinery , proliferating until their sheer numbers force the cells to break_open in a death spasm , freeing the newly made viruses to infect other cells and other hosts . Because viruses use the cell ' s own machinery to reproduce , it has been almost impossible to develop antiviral drugs that do not kill healthy cells along with the virus . Sore_throats occur , for example , when the influenza virus kills cells lining the throat . Paralysis occurs when the polio virus bursts muscle_cells . Dementia occurs when the rabies virus short-circuits brain_cells . Death occurs when the hantavirus destroys lung cells . Although HIV shares broad characteristics with other viruses , it falls_into a special category called retroviruses , which makes_it especially unpredictable and , therefore , deadly . Viruses can have two types of genetic material , DNA or RNA . DNA viruses share the same deoxyribonucleic_acid that encodes the genes of all living organisms . Most DNA viruses cause relatively trivial infections , ranging from warts to colds , but one family , the herpes_viruses , causes illnesses ranging from cold_sores to cancer . Most serious diseases , including measles , mumps , encephalitis , polio , hepatitis and rabies , are caused by RNA viruses . Ribodeoxynucleic acids , which are chemically similar to DNA , are used for carrying messages inside cells of all living organisms , but in viruses they store genetic information . HIV and other retroviruses are RNA viruses , but they are unusual ones because they contain an enzyme called reverse_transcriptase , or RT , which makes a DNA copy of the virus ' RNA genes . This DNA &quot; transcript &quot; can then be used as a pattern for making more viruses . Reverse_transcriptase is the sloppy housekeeper in HIV , introducing genetic errors and then failing to correct them . All other organisms , including other viruses , also make mistakes when replicating their genetic information . But they typically have a mechanism , perhaps a second enzyme , that identifies and corrects mistakes like the spell-check function on a word_processor . Retroviruses don ' t have such a mechanism , UCLA ' s Chen said . As a result , HIV makes mistakes a_million times more often than other cells , or about one per generation . Those miscues give the virus a wealth of subtle variants to use in adapting to changing conditions -- and in eluding therapeutic drugs . AZT , the most successful anti-HIV drug , inhibits the replication of the virus by blocking the activity of reverse_transcriptase . But lurking somewhere in each HIV-infected person is at least one mutant form of the virus with a slightly different RT that is not blocked by the drug . That variant eventually predominates , killing the victim . &quot; This virus has impressed us again and again with its ability to change , &quot; said Dr. David Ho , director of the Aaron Diamond Center in New York City . &quot; It always has a new ( variant ) to counter our efforts. &quot; But mutation is not the only unique -- and ultimately , lethal -- characteristic of retroviruses . At the beginning of an HIV infection , another enzyme produced by one of the virus ' genes inserts the DNA copy into the cell ' s own DNA . This copy of the virus ' genetic information becomes permanently hidden from the host ' s immune_system , until it re-emerges months or years later to cause disease . The ability of HIV to lie_dormant for long periods presents the body ' s immune_system with a seemingly impossible task . &quot; How does the defense_mechanism of an organism recognize this foreign DNA from its own ? &quot; asked Schochetman . &quot; It can ' t . If the virus is not functioning , there ' s nothing for the immune_system to recognize . The virus can actually lie there hidden for long periods_of_time , and neither we nor the body are used to dealing with such long-term infections. &quot; &quot; It becomes very tricky to attack the virus , &quot; said epidemiologist Jonathan Kaplan of the CDC . &quot; How do you get_it out of the genetic material ? The answer is , we don ' t know any way to do that . You have to kill the cell. &quot; The final and crushing blow is the nature of the virus ' target . It is not a relatively minor throat cell , or even something as vital as a liver cell . Instead , it is one of the most crucial cells involved in leading the fight against infections : a white_blood_cell called CD4 . CD4 is &quot; the conductor of the orchestra of cells in the immune_system , &quot; Schochetman said . &quot; While the immune_system is trying to galvanize itself to deal with the virus , the virus undermines the system by destroying the leader. &quot; Without direction , the immune_system is lost . &quot; There aren ' t very many reasons why progress against AIDS is so difficult , but they are very big reasons , &quot; Levy said . The key to understanding HIV is understanding retroviruses . So far , not much progress has been made . The first retrovirus was discovered in 1911 by Peyton Rous , a biologist at Columbia University . He identified a simple virus , containing only four genes , that causes tumors in chickens . Rous believed that a similar virus caused cancer in humans , but was never able to find one . Other scientists scoffed and few joined the search . Researchers looking_back today acknowledge that that was clearly a big mistake . &quot; We were probably very naive to think that retroviruses would n ' t be in humans , &quot; Levy said . &quot; They ' re everywhere else in nature . Why not in humans as well ? &quot; But it was not until 1980 that Gallo of the National Cancer Institute identified the first human retrovirus , now called human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-I or HTLV-I . That virus , which is common in Japan , the Caribbean and parts of Africa , causes a rare form of adult leukemia in about 5 % of the people it infects . Some researchers suspect that HTLV-I and a more recently identified companion , HTLV-II -- or viruses very similar to them -- may be responsible_for a wide variety of human illness , including chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple_sclerosis , as well as some forms of cancer . HIV is very similar to the HTLVs -- so similar , in fact , that Gallo initially named it HTLV-III . The main differences are that HIV has more genes than HTLVs , nine versus four , and causes disease in a much higher percentage of the people it infects . Because the viruses are so_much alike , researchers throughout the country are now studying the HTLVs carefully in the hope of gaining new insights into HIV . &quot; There are lessons to be learned from HTLV-I and II , &quot; said William Blattner of the National Cancer Institute . &quot; They may be the Rosetta stone &quot; for understanding HIV . Levy thinks researchers will find other new retroviruses as well that will also aid the understanding of AIDS . &quot; Every new virus opens_up incredible vistas of knowledge , &quot; he said . He is looking_for such viruses , but most of his effort is spent on HIV . Among other things , Levy and his colleagues are working_out the mechanism of Kaposi ' s sarcoma , a tumor that frequently strikes AIDS patients ; studying ways to block transmission from infected mothers to infants ; exploring the function of one of the HIV genes whose role in reproduction is still a mystery ; and probing relationships between strains of viruses in different parts of the world . One of his most promising leads involves the discovery by molecular biologist Chris Walker , a former postdoctoral associate of Levy ' s , that a white_blood_cell called CD8 holds HIV in check by preventing viral replication while HIV is hidden in the host genome , the complete genetic blueprint of an organism . People who have been infected by HIV for many years but who still have not developed full-blown AIDS may possess a stronger or more resilient CD8 , scientists suggest . It appears that the loss of this ability to restrain the virus contributes to the development of full-blown AIDS . Simply transfusing AIDS patients with CD8 cells from long-term survivors to slow HIV infection would not work because the cells themselves would trigger an adverse immune_reaction . So researchers are instead exploring a protein produced by CD8 -- called CD8 antiviral factor , or CAF -- that they believe is the key component in checking the progression of the disease . Molecular biologists Ed Barker and Carl Mackewicz are now trying to collect and purify enough of this protein so they can identify its composition and produce large quantities by genetic_engineering techniques . that ' s a daunting task , Levy said , requiring 100 liters of fluid from CD8 cells , which costs them $ 2 # 000 per liter just for materials to produce the fluid . Nonetheless , Levy said he is &quot; very encouraged by this approach , &quot; because the virus doesn ' t seem to be able to evade this protein by mutating into a different strain . &quot; We haven ' t met a virus yet that can escape it , &quot; he said . The approach may even have the potential to completely rid the body of an HIV infection , Mackewicz said . All white_blood_cells die_off over a period of a_few years to be replaced with new ones . If viral replication could be suppressed by CAF , perhaps in conjunction with drugs , until all_the infected cells die naturally , theoretically the infection would be over . Mackewicz concedes that such a scenario may be overly optimistic . But even if CAF controlled only 90 % of replication , he said , &quot; you could get a situation like herpes , where you are infected for life but don ' t die from it. &quot; But &quot; the most exciting thing we have going_on right now , &quot; Levy said , is the development of a new animal model for AIDS . Although primates have their own version of HIV -- called the simian immunodeficiency virus , or SIV -- it is distinctly different from HIV and does not provide the best possible gauge for testing the effectiveness of new drugs and vaccines . Animal models are crucial in studying AIDS , according to virologist Stephen Morse of Rockefeller University in New York City , because it is the interaction of the virus with the entire organism that produces its adverse effects , and this interaction cannot be mimicked by growing the virus in cells in the laboratory . &quot; The fact that we haven ' t had a good animal model is a tremendous disadvantage , &quot; Morse said . Chimpanzees can be infected with HIV , but the infection is not pathogenic -- the animals do not get sick and die . This makes_it impossible to tell if potential vaccines or drugs tested in the animals are effective . Chimps are also rare and expensive . A far better model would be the baboon , which is more common and less expensive . Scientists have long believed that baboons cannot be infected with HIV , much less develop AIDS . But David Blackbourn in Levy ' s laboratory has proved them wrong . He has infected several baboons on a farm in Texas with HIV-2 , a less virulent strain of HIV that is most common in West Africa . Moreover , Levy will report this week at the 10th International Conference on AIDS in Japan that two of the baboons have now developed symptoms of AIDS , including lymph_node destruction and fibromatosis , a tumor similar to Kaposi ' s sarcoma . That could open_up a whole new track of research . &quot; When I said I was going_to work in baboons , they laughed_at me , &quot; Levy says now with a glint in his eye . &quot; It ' s extra pleasant to get these results because we stuck_with it. &quot; A sense of urgency pervades the laboratory , more so than in a cancer research_center , according to Barker , who has worked in both . &quot; Perhaps it ' s because AIDS affects younger people who are . . . educated and more vocal , &quot; he said . It may also be because many people with AIDS come_through the laboratory regularly , donating blood for research and becoming , in Levy ' s words , &quot; a part of the laboratory. &quot; Sooner or later those donors will die . But perhaps the ultimate difference is that the number of cancer victims has stabilized while the number of AIDS victims is still growing . &quot; I don ' t know where AIDS is going , &quot; Levy said . &quot; But if we don ' t stop it soon , it may spread beyond all our imagining. &quot; Next : The search for an AIDS vaccine A Stealthy Virus The AIDS virus evades efforts to control it because of its unique cycle of replication , which occurs in a white_blood_cell called a T-cell . 1 ) Infection begins when the virus binds to the outside of a healthy T-cell and injects its genetic material into the cell . 2 ) Inside the cell , viral RNA is converted to &quot; proviral &quot; DNA by an enzyme called reverse_transcriptase . This enzyme makes at least one error every time it reproduces the RNA . These errors allow the virus to mutate rapidly , giving it the abiity to develop resistance to drugs . 3 ) Another enzyme unique to retroviruses integrates the proviral DNA into the host cell ' s own DNA , where it can remain hidden for years . Eventually , it serves as a template for the production of more viral RNA . This material forms a &quot; bud &quot; that is released from the cell . 4 ) The enzyme proteinase completes the formation of the new infectious HIV particles , which is then free to continue the cycle by infecting new T-cells .</TEXT>
