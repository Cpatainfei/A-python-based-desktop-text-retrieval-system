   <HEADLINE> 2ND TRIAL DELVES INTO MYSTERY OF BOY ' S DEATH ; COURTS : THE DEFENDANT , WHO ALSO HAD ANOTHER CHILD DIE IN HER CARE , SAYS A MURDER_CHARGE HAS SHATTERED HER LIFE . THE INFANT ' S MOTHER IS HAUNTED BY DOUBTS ABOUT HOW SHE SELECTED A BABY-SITTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Smiling , cooing babies aren ' t supposed to fall unconscious and die after parents leave them at the sitter ' s . But in 1990 , two baby boys died within three months of each other while in the care of PTA president and unlicensed sitter Debra Suzanne Cummings . Since then , the criminal justice system has struggled to resolve whether the deaths were a tragic coincidence or murder . During its protracted journey through Van Nuys Superior_Court , the Cummings case has been an ordeal for everyone involved -- the boys ' families , Cummings , even the jurors whose heated deliberations two years ago produced insults and hard feelings but no verdict . &quot; You don ' t think I haven ' t looked_at myself in the mirror and said , ' Why two children ? ' &quot; Cummings , now 36 , said recently , speaking at length about the case for the first time . &quot; It ' s so horrible. &quot; Toni Majoy-Young , the mother of 9-month-old Kevin Young , the second child to die in Cummings ' care , said in an interview : &quot; All I know is that when I dropped Kevin off that morning , he was alive and well . When I picked him up , he was unconscious and dying. &quot; She has told her story many times . In February , she gave an eloquent statement to her most influential audience yet -- a congressional subcommittee investigating the quality and availability of affordable child_care . Majoy-Young said she still wonders if her firstborn son suffered during his short life because she entrusted him to a stranger who advertised &quot; Loving_Child Care in My Home &quot; for $ 75 a week . At the time , she thought Cummings &quot; was the answer to my prayers . She was the president of the PTA . She impressed me. &quot; It is a problem many working parents face . Child_care , a $ 20-billion-a-year industry , is one of the country ' s fastest-growing small businesses . About 12 million children nationwide are in full- or part-time day_care . Only about 15 % are in licensed homes or centers , according to the subcommittee . Its findings and recommendations are_due in about two months , staff director Steve Jenning said . Majoy-Young says she didn ' t even know what questions to ask Cummings when she hired her . Now , the questions are endless . &quot; I just wonder what hell I put Kevin through every day , &quot; she said . &quot; You never stop wondering . I try not to feel guilty about it , but the hardest part is not knowing what happened . This is a parent ' s worst nightmare. &quot; While the lawmakers prepare their report , the Cummings case is headed back to court for another round . Jury selection for a second trial begins Wednesday . Cummings is accused of second-degree murder in the death of Kevin Young , who died after sustaining a fractured skull and who is remembered by his mother as &quot; a very happy baby and very easy to like. &quot; At Cummings ' first trial , the jury deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal after eight days of contentious deliberations . A month later , a judge dismissed manslaughter charges in another baby ' s death , saying there was insufficient evidence that Cummings ' actions caused the baby to die . Cummings continues to profess her innocence , maintaining that she is a victim of coincidence , and the target of a prosecutor ' s vendetta . &quot; You would think they found 12 or 13 children ' s corpses under my house , the way ( Deputy Dist . Atty. ) Carol Fisch is going_after me , &quot; Cummings said . Said Fisch : &quot; I think she ' s dangerous. &quot; Cummings , on the other hand , describes herself as a loving mother dedicated to bringing_up her daughter . She said she baby-sat to make extra money , and to have other children around to play with her daughter . She said the case has taken a huge financial and emotional toll , shattering the pleasant life she had enjoyed as a Reseda housewife , doting on her husband , running errands in her minivan and working tirelessly as president of the PTA at Shirley Avenue Elementary School . Cummings , who retains custody of her daughter , has since divorced , moved several times , and is driving a 12-year-old Honda . She is bitter , and quick to complain about police investigators and an &quot; incomplete &quot; coroner ' s report used to bring charges against her . &quot; The American way of living has become very colored , very disillusioned , &quot; she said . During her trial , friends recanted their previously glowing statements about Cummings , and her teen-age son testified that he had seen his mother mistreat other children . The son also said Cummings made racist remarks about Kevin and his family . The first signs of trouble came_on March 15 , 1990 , when Matthew Cooley , 14 months old , died during a park outing with Cummings . According to testimony , Cummings left the child unattended on a blanket , and he suffered a seizure . No autopsy was performed . &quot; I truly believe that if the police would have investigated Matthew ' s death thoroughly , my son would be alive today , &quot; Majoy-Young said . Prosecutors admit they don ' t know exactly what happened three months later on the afternoon Kevin received his fatal injuries , partly because the only people present were Cummings and her 2-year-old nephew . Cummings says she stepped into the kitchen momentarily to fix a bottle and returned after hearing a &quot; noise like a thump &quot; in her living room . &quot; If I had done something , don ' t you think I ' d come_up with a better story than I was out of the room ? &quot; If guilty , Cummings pointed_out , she could have plea-bargained . &quot; I could have been out already with good behavior , &quot; she said . Looking_back , Majoy-Young wonders if she should have been concerned earlier . Kevin had begun to cry when she dropped him off , but she attributed it to normal separation anxiety . On one occasion , Kevin ' s nose was red and swollen when she picked him up , and Cummings explained that he had slipped_on the kitchen floor while chasing a cat . Majoy-Young and Cummings give differing accounts of the day Kevin fell_into his coma . Cummings asserts that the Youngs brought the child to the house unexpectedly that day , and she has suggested that he might have been injured before she took_charge of him . He had been vomiting , but she said she agreed to watch him . She insisted that Kevin hit his head on a coffee_table , but the Los Angeles County coroner and other medical experts say the skull fractures he suffered could result only from a blow or a fall from a three-story building . Hearing the noise in the living room , Cummings said she rushed in and found Kevin looking &quot; like a cartoon figure , kind of wobbly , like he was seeing stars. &quot; Kevin was conscious , Cummings said , and she immediately called Majoy-Young at_work . Majoy-Young asserts , however , that while Kevin was indeed vomiting that day , doctors said it was because he was teething . Majoy-Young said he wasn ' t sick , and that no head bumps or other injuries had been detected during a routine pediatrician ' s exam he received at 9 months . She said she arrived about 15 minutes after Cummings called her at_work and found the sitter holding Kevin on her shoulder and patting his backside . &quot; His breathing was sporadic and he was very pale , &quot; Majoy-Young said . &quot; I asked Debbie if I should call 911 , but she told me that it would be faster if I took him myself. &quot; At the hospital , doctors and a social_worker told Majoy-Young the baby had a fractured skull , and that he could not have received such a severe injury by falling against a coffee_table . Kevin died the next day when efforts to control the swelling in his brain failed and life support was disconnected . &quot; We ' re not talking_about a bump on the head , &quot; prosecutor Fisch recently said , describing two large skull fractures and bruising on Kevin ' s intestine that doctors said happened at_the_same_time as the head injuries . Cummings defends herself by pointing to a section of a coroner ' s report , which she interprets as showing the child had previous injuries . Investigators found a &quot; chocolate-colored blood_clot , &quot; which she interpreted as &quot; an old injury. &quot; Additionally , experts hired by the coroner ' s office found &quot; fibroblasts , &quot; a medical term that usually indicates healing is under way . &quot; The fibroblasts are consistent with an older injury , &quot; said Deputy Public_Defender Tamar Rachel Toister . &quot; They are not consistent with an injury that occurred within 24 hours of death. &quot; While Cummings believes the findings vindicate her , Fisch said several doctors who testified at the first trial disagreed , saying fibroblasts occur naturally as children grow . Toister said she believes an earlier injury was exacerbated by a &quot; freak accident &quot; that caused the second , fatal blow to Kevin ' s head . &quot; I think the evidence supports two blows , &quot; Toister said . For the first trial , a neuropathology report , which is part of the coroner ' s investigation and contains the key phrase about the blood_clot , was not submitted to the defense until two weeks before the trial started , Cummings said . While it is not uncommon for paperwork and reports to appear on the eve of criminal trials , Cummings said the report contains the crucial information that shows Kevin had a pre-existing condition . Properly investigated by experts hired by her defense , the information could have exonerated her , Cummings contended . &quot; I was arrested on the basis of an autopsy report , &quot; she said , &quot; and it wasn ' t complete. &quot; Spreading_out dozens of documents and transcripts related to her case , Cummings quietly said , &quot; This is my life. &quot; After spending thousands of dollars gathered from relatives and at fund-raisers staged by friends to pay_for a private attorney , Cummings said she is close to broke . Because she was the only adult present when the child was injured , Cummings was not surprised when police wanted to question her . But detectives never checked the coffee_table for hairs or fibers and there were no other visible injuries on Kevin ' s body , she maintained . Free on bail , Cummings has moved eight times since the first trial because she fears retribution . She says she is ready for a second trial . &quot; I am guilty of one thing , &quot; she said . &quot; I baby-sat without a license. &quot; The Youngs have another child , Kasey , who is now 2 , and have moved to Maryland , convinced that California is no place to raise a family . Both parents work , and child_care is still a concern . &quot; Every day I live_in fear wondering if I ' m going_to get a phone_call and hear someone telling me that something has happened to my son , &quot; Majoy-Young told the subcommittee . &quot; I wonder if he is being cared_for properly , if he ' s being loved or if he ' s being neglected . I will never have the peace_of_mind knowing that my son is 100 % safe. &quot; Mrozek is a correspondent and O ' Neill is a Times staff writer .</TEXT>
