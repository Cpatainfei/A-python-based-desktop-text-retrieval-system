   <HEADLINE> PAST , PRESENT CLASH IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CITY ; ALEXANDRIA : EXCAVATORS ARE GETTING TO WHAT ' S BURIED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE , THEN TURNING THE SITE OVER TO DEVELOPERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Throughout Alexandria , archeologists who want to save the ancient city -- or at least record it -- are in a race with builders determined to erect a new one . At stake is the hazy history of a Mediterranean metropolis built_on the dreams of Alexander the Great . To win , the scholarly excavators must stay one step ahead of the bulldozers . This is salvage archeology : getting_to what ' s buried as quickly as possible , recording what ' s there , then turning the site over to the developers . It is the same story wherever past and present collide : London , Rome , Athens , Beirut , Jerusalem . Even in the youthful United States , road-building crews strike ancient Indian burial_mounds or Civil War remains . In Alexandria , countless treasures sleep beneath a city that has lived more_than 2 # 000 years . Under a blinding sun , French archeologist Jean-Yves Empereur hurries from excavation to excavation -- five at the moment -- where his colleagues are trying to find everything in time . A Roman bath here , bits of mummy wrapping there . Parts of an ancient house , the torso of a statue , a broken amphora filled with 1 # 200 Roman coins . &quot; Perhaps this was once a garden , &quot; Empereur said . &quot; Someone buried the coins here for safekeeping and never made_it back. &quot; Many centuries later , the garden became the site of a theater , which in its turn has been sacrificed to progress . Alexandria probably holds tens of thousands of such tales , but Empereur does not have the leisure of daydreaming . Archeologists estimate they have no more_than a decade left to dig . &quot; Everything is a piece of the puzzle that is Alexandria , &quot; said Empereur , on loan from France ' s National Center of Scientific Research to help the Egyptian Antiquities Organization . &quot; We could lose everything. &quot; Exhuming Alexandria ' s 2 # 300 years of history is a little like cutting_into a pan of lasagna . The earth holds layer after layer of time . For centuries , Alexandria ' s buildings had no foundations . New buildings rose on top of old , leaving a lot of history intact . Also , Alexander ' s architects designed the city in grids , like Washington , D.C. Excavators have an idea where buildings should have been . &quot; Every time you lower a shovel_in Alexandria , great things come_up , &quot; said Bob Bianchi , a Greco-Roman historian from Brooklyn , N.Y. Alexandria ' s story began in 332 B.C. As Bianchi describes it : &quot; Alexander came_down from Syria along the coastline . When he reached the site of what was to be Alexandria , he looked_out and said , ' What a harb &quot; Alexander , a Macedonian prince with great affection for things Greek , ordered a city built right there , to be named for him and to become the capital of his empire . He died nine years later in Babylon without seeing it . Ancient Alexandria , as large as a good-size American city , was designed for beauty , with palaces , temples , gardens , fountains and the renowned Alexandria Library . In its heyday , &quot; the Pearl of the Mediterranean &quot; had the world ' s finest port . In beauty and culture , it rivaled Rome . Alexandria ' s design became so evocative that at least 34 communities around the world adopted it as their own , 12 of them in the United States . The city flourished under many rulers , including Cleopatra and Mark_Antony . But after they committed suicide in 30 B.C. , disaster struck . Riots , battles , invasions , earthquakes , fires and fluctuating sea_levels took their toll on Alexander ' s city . Lost within its ever-changing precincts were the library ; the tombs of Alexander , Cleopatra and Mark_Antony ; colonnaded temples ; the world ' s largest gymnasium ; mosaic-covered baths , and docks for small sailboats that took families on Sunday excursions . By the Middle_Ages even the Pharos Lighthouse , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , was gone . Bianchi said two modern events had done the most to interfere with the preservation of Alexandria ' s past : * A British bombardment in July , 1882 , that destroyed major portions of the city . * Construction of a waterfront highway a_few decades ago that turned innumerable relics to powder , then dumped them into the sea . Modern architecture has become the latest threat . High-rise buildings require deep foundations . At many sites , piles are driven almost 45 feet down , mutilating everything in their path . The archeologists try to get there first . Mohammed Awad , an architect , is a founding member of the Alexandria Preservation Trust , whose 300 members scour the city for signs of antiquities on building_sites . If necessary , they file lawsuits to stop construction . That happened in 1993 when an extraordinary mosaic and other valuable antiquities were discovered at the site intended for a new Alexandria Library .</TEXT>
