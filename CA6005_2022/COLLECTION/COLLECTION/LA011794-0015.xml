   <HEADLINE> ITALY PARLIAMENT DISSOLVED ; ELECTIONS SET FOR MARCH 27 ; EUROPE : THE PRIME_MINISTER WILL REMAIN IN A CARETAKER ROLE . JEWISH LEADERS PROTEST THE VOTE COINCIDES WITH PASSOVER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After two years of tumult that eroded confidence in national leadership , Italy turned toward a new and uncertain political future Sunday as President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro dissolved a scandal-tarred Parliament and a lame-duck government summoned voters to landmark elections . The March 27 vote will mark the end of a closely held political_system that has ruled Italy in increasing prosperity and corruption since World_War_II . Italians say the First Republic , born in the aftermath of war and fascism , is dead . In March , they will choose new faces under new rules to launch the Second Republic . Climaxing weeks of maneuvering , on a wet , blustery Sunday , Scalfaro asked apolitical Prime_Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and his technocrat government to remain in office until the vote . Scalfaro rejected a resignation that Ciampi proffered Thursday , meaning that the former Central_Bank governor can remain in office without having to seek a new majority . The Italian president agreed with Ciampi , however , that it is time for elections , citing &quot; unequivocal facts that require early dissolution of Parliament. &quot; Among them , Scalfaro cited 80 % support for electoral reform in a referendum last April and results in June and December municipal elections demonstrating that the Parliament no longer accurately represents political sentiment in the country . * The four Establishment parties led by the Christian Democrats that hold the parliamentary majority , all_of them tarnished by scandal , were overwhelmed in the mayoral votes by insurgents of the left and right . Scalfaro also cited the demands of justice as one of his reasons for dissolving the Parliament : Nearly one-third of the 630 deputies and 315 elected senators face charges ranging from corruption to Mafia association but are protected by immunity while Parliament is in session . About 3 # 000 business_leaders , politicians and public officials have been ensnared so far in a two-year investigation into massive kickbacks for public contracts . &quot; The word now passes to the voters , &quot; Scalfaro said in a letter to parliamentary leaders decreeing the dissolution of the 21-month-old legislature . A two-hour Cabinet meeting chaired by Ciampi on Sunday set the March 27 date for the country ' s voters , triggering an immediate protest from members of Italy ' s small Jewish community and sympathetic opposition parties : Passover begins that day . The nation ' s 30 # 000 Jewish voters must choose between religious obligation and civic_responsibility in deciding whether to vote . &quot; People will have to follow their conscience , &quot; said Tullia Zevi , president of the Italian Jewish community . &quot; Even in Italy it is clear that although all religions are equal , some religions are more equal than others. &quot; Italian national television said that Ciampi went_to the home of Italy ' s chief rabbi Sunday night to apologize and to explain that the March 27 date was in_effect imposed on his government . &quot; I suffered for not having been able to reconcile the needs of everyone , &quot; Ciampi told reporters . The constitution requires an election within 70 days of the dissolution of Parliament , and Ciampi was warned by government election experts that to call it earlier might jeopardize Italians ' ability to vote_in some cities . * Normally complex ballots will be even more convoluted in March . Amid a surge of new parties , two-thirds of the deputies and senators will be elected directly , U.S.-style , for the first time , while the remainder will be chosen under the old system of proportional_representation that has produced 52 weak coalition governments since World_War_II , all_of them dominated by the now-disgraced Christian Democrats . &quot; It is a new and very complicated ( electoral ) law , &quot; said Paolo Barile , the Cabinet_minister responsible_for relations with Parliament . He said that to have held the elections March 20 , the alternative date , &quot; would have been very dangerous. &quot; Former Communists , neo-fascists , northern-based separatists and reformers clamoring for a piece of the political center all hope to prosper in March at the expense of the Christian Democrats and their allies .</TEXT>
