   <HEADLINE> IT ' S ALL IN THE STARS ; THERE ' S REALLY NO LOGICAL ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHY STARS MAKE WHAT THEY DO. ; BUT HERE ' S A LOOK_AT SOME OF THE MANY AND VARIED REASONS THAT ONLY SEEM TO MAKE_SENSE IN HOLLYWOOD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Until just after the Fourth_of_July , movie_stars were taking a drubbing at the summer box_office . New films featuring Eddie Murphy , Kevin Costner , Julia Roberts were shot down in flames , rekindling Hollywood ' s age-old debate : Why are stars paid so_much money when they can ' t even open a movie ? Then along came Tom Hanks in a box of bonbons called &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; followed by Arnold Schwarzenegger in &quot; True Lies &quot; and , most recently , Jim Carrey in &quot; The Mask. &quot; And the argument was turned_on its side . &quot; The truth is , &quot; says one senior studio executive , &quot; no star is worth the money you pay him -- except in the right movie. &quot; And therein lies the classic Hollywood double-bind . There are about half_a_dozen solid reasons why studios pay upward of $ 7 million ( dollar figures today are merely guarantees against a potentially larger profit share ) to secure the_likes_of Murphy , Costner , Roberts , Hanks , Schwarzenegger , Mel Gibson , Sylvester Stallone , Tom Cruise , Harrison Ford , Michael Douglas , Robin Williams , Sharon Stone , Bruce Willis , Whoopi Goldberg and now Carrey . And only one very good reason why they shouldn ' t . The Wrong Movie vs . the Right A star in the right movie -- Hanks in &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; -- can generate a $ 24-million opening weekend on a film despite its inscrutable title and lack of other obvious marketing hooks . Even in the wrong movie , &quot; Last Action Hero , &quot; for instance , a Schwarzenegger can draw $ 15 million from the curious on opening weekend . The right Schwarzenegger movie , &quot; True Lies , &quot; brought_in almost twice that much . How do you tell the difference ? It ' s almost impossible . &quot; Studio executives sometime become much too excited about the obvious , &quot; says &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; co-producer Steve Tisch . &quot; We ' ve all seen examples of actors who , because of their newly acquired power and leverage , are packaged into the wrong movies . The illusion that excitement creates overlooks some real problems. &quot; When a star is in the right movie , such_as Costner in &quot; The Bodyguard , &quot; the rewards can be astounding -- a worldwide theatrical gross of $ 500 million . When he ' s in the wrong movie , &quot; Wyatt Earp , &quot; shirts can be lost . The $ 60-million Western , which clocked_in at more_than three hours , will gross only about $ 25 million domestically . But it ' s important to know that the one begat the other . The decision to commit to &quot; Wyatt Earp &quot; with Costner came_in the wake of &quot; The Bodyguard &quot; and his two other period-piece blockbusters , &quot; Dances With Wolves &quot; and &quot; Robin_Hood : Prince of Thieves. &quot; In the unlikely event that Warner Bros . had decided against the movie , other studios would have tripped over their spurs to get_it . &quot; You always have to count back 12 or 24 months to find the point on the calendar when the decision was made to get the star and pay him , &quot; says producer and former studio executive Sean Daniel . Even Disney , the one studio known for being hesitant to cough_up $ 7 million or more even for the right actor in the right movie , will occasionally pony_up and pay someone like Roberts her asking price on a film like &quot; I Love Trouble. &quot; &quot; The thing is , if it hits with Julia , it hits bigger , &quot; says one Disney executive . And even if it doesn ' t , as was the case with &quot; Trouble , &quot; the studio needs a_couple_of &quot; loss_leaders &quot; every year -- flat-out star vehicles &quot; that show you ' re still in the business , &quot; according to the executive . The Mediocrity Meritocracy The nature of the film business is such_that the average_cost of a film is now between $ 40 million and $ 50 million -- $ 25 million just to produce and the rest for marketing and advertising . The impetus to get many of these films off the ground is that finite group of star performers . &quot; They give studios a sense of security , &quot; says David Schiff , an agent at United Talent Agency . &quot; Sometimes it ' s a false sense of security. &quot; The insurance the studios are buying is to protect them from their own mediocrity , says a senior studio executive . A great concept movie like &quot; Speed &quot; sells itself , while with a dud , like &quot; Toys , &quot; even a big name like Robin Williams can ' t sell it . Stars are for everything in between . &quot; The truth is , most movies are not really terrible and most are not truly great , &quot; says the executive . &quot; Most of them are just OK . A star is there to help those mediocre movies make money. &quot; This attitude , says another studio executive , is a reflection of the poor management that prevails at most studios . &quot; The studios are struggling with material . They just don ' t have it , &quot; says the executive . &quot; So all they ' re doing now is filling_in slots -- especially summer and Christmas ( which between them account_for 60 % of the year ' s business ) . To greenlight those movies they need a big star name . And so they ' re forced to pay big star prices. &quot; A recent example is Fox ' s &quot; Crisis in the Hot Zone. &quot; Despite continuing script problems , it was given the go-ahead because Robert Redford and Jodie Foster had agreed to star . When Foster dropped_out , the project came_close to falling_apart . The Short_List How do actors get_on that select list of names that has studios panting for their services ? Usually on the heels of a surprise commercial success -- Roberts in &quot; Pretty Woman , &quot; Willis in &quot; Die Hard. &quot; Carrey leaped onto the list with &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective , &quot; going from $ 650 # 000 a film to $ 7 million overnight . &quot; The actor establishes his price when the market is most favorable , &quot; says UTA ' s Schiff . &quot; And success has a funny way of securing that position . You have a long_time to disprove yourself. &quot; Another way for an actor to climb_on the list is an accrual of fine supporting performances , which seems to be the way Tommy Lee Jones is headed . Standout performances in support of Harrison Ford in &quot; The Fugitive &quot; and Steven Seagal in &quot; Under Fire &quot; have led to co-star outings in &quot; The Client , &quot; &quot; Blown Away &quot; and the upcoming &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; and &quot; Batman Forever , &quot; gradually upping the actor ' s price ( $ 5 million for &quot; Batman Forever &quot; ) . Whether he can carry a film solo , however , will be the ultimate test , and should his starring role in &quot; Cobb , &quot; the Ty Cobb biography due for release later this year , be a substantial hit , Jones could be breathing the rarefied air of the Short_List denizens . At all times , however , the list remains small and is based on a number of factors , a primary one being foreign appeal . Certain actors , especially action stars ( Schwarzenegger , Stallone , Willis , Seagal , Jean-Claude Van Damme ) , have become commodities to be bought and sold on the international market . &quot; Whether he opens a movie or not , it ' s the ultimate economic results that justify the actor ' s fee on the next film , &quot; Schiff says . Since action films often gross twice as much abroad as in the United States , Van Damme and Seagal are major stars offshore . Most of their films do_well here but clean_up overseas . Christopher Lambert is the exception of an actor who is a major action star overseas but not in the United States . Based on the success of &quot; Speed , &quot; Keanu Reeves has been penciled onto the list of action stars . &quot; It will take months and years before the movies that came_out of that momentum are looked_at , &quot; says Daniel . Depending_on the outcome of those films , Reeves will either move onto the permanent list or be scratched off . A component in Reeves ' favor &quot; is that Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner can ' t star in every movie , &quot; says Tisch . &quot; Besides , Cruise and Costner are in a position to develop their own material . That makes_it tougher for me as a producer and I have to pay more for actors on the next level. &quot; The Teflon Coating The old saying &quot; you ' re only as_good_as your last picture &quot; doesn ' t apply to today ' s highest-paid stars . Once they ' re at a certain level , stardom creates a Teflon coating , shielding the actor from mistakes . In the industry , &quot; Wyatt Earp &quot; is considered an honorable failure , a film with high ambitions that didn ' t quite come_together . Despite the losses incurred in making_it , were Costner up for grabs ( he ' s already filming another mega-budget film , &quot; Waterworld , &quot; for release next summer ) , there would still be a stampede for his services . And they would pay his asking price -- said to be $ 10 million to $ 12 million . If Costner ' s no lesser a star after &quot; Earp , &quot; neither is Roberts following &quot; I Love Trouble. &quot; She is protected by her appearance in three of the most successful women ' s vehicles in recent years -- &quot; Pretty Woman , &quot; &quot; Sleeping With the Enemy &quot; and &quot; The Pelican Brief , &quot; all_of which grossed northward of $ 100 million . And were a producer with a starless script to get a commitment from Roberts , the project would find financing overnight . Schiff makes the comparison with the sports business . If a baseball_player has a multiyear , $ 15-million contract and has one bad season , he argues , the contract isn ' t canceled . &quot; He still draws fans to the games and to the sport itself . There are additional values. &quot; &quot; When Julia Roberts stars in a movie , &quot; says entertainment attorney Peter Dekom , &quot; it creates a higher awareness on the part of the audience and the press . Until such time as that ' s no longer true , she can command big bucks. &quot; The most in-demand stars not only have Teflon coatings , they develop infrared bomb deflection devices . &quot; No one blames Robin Williams for the failure of ' Being Human ' or ' Toys , ' &quot; says one industry source . That ignominy goes_to the films ' creators , Bill Forsyth and Barry Levinson , respectively . But Williams , and not necessarily director Chris Columbus , is credited with the mega-success of &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire. &quot; Does anyone remember that Tom Cruise ' s &quot; Far and Away &quot; was a misstep ? Do you suppose when he offered his services for &quot; Interview With the Vampire &quot; that anyone suggested that he should take a cut_in his reported $ 12-million per film salary since his last period_piece didn ' t work_out ? No , the project went from being a long-awaited adaptation of an Anne Rice novel to a potential blockbuster starring Tom Cruise . Producer Wendy Finerman spent nine years waiting to get &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; made . And one of the main reasons it did get made , says co-producer Steve Tisch , is Hanks ( along with in-demand director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriter Eric Roth ) . The industry will recognize Zemeckis and Roth ' s contributions . But to the public , it ' s a Tom Hanks film . Hot to Un-hot Teflon , like any other coating , is subject_to erosion . Eddie Murphy ' s coating may have been damaged , if only temporarily . Industry insiders still consider him bankable , &quot; a continuing delusion , &quot; says one studio executive . &quot; Beverly Hills Cop III &quot; was a disappointment from the standpoint of cost ( $ 65 million with his salary alone eating_up $ 15 million ) . And he is coming_off a bad run , including &quot; The Distinguished Gentleman &quot; and &quot; Boomerang. &quot; &quot; To get cold takes two or three movies that have contempt for the audience , &quot; says the senior studio executive . &quot; Eddie has one more chance with ( the upcoming ) ' The Nutty Professor. ' Otherwise he ' ll suffer the Burt Reynolds syndrome . He ' ll have trashed his career. &quot; But , counters entertainment attorney David Colden , &quot; Murphy still has a following if he ' s in the right vehicle. &quot; And as was true with a Bill Murray or a Sylvester Stallone , career lulls are made to be broken . that ' s why even during a down time , certain actors maintain their high prices . &quot; There ' s always a chance that the actor ' s next film will be the one you want it to be , &quot; Daniel says . For Murray that slump-breaker was &quot; Groundhog_Day &quot; ; for Stallone , &quot; Cliffhanger. &quot; But since &quot; Rocky , &quot; Stallone has never not been a star . &quot; Some actors remain stars no matter what , &quot; says Colden . &quot; Studios will take risks on those actors , especially within a specific genre , hoping to hit the lottery on the next one. &quot; What stars do_in the meantime , suggests Dekom , is maintain the appearance that they ' re not taking a salary cut -- like demanding the same gross participation in a film but not taking a salary up front . Another alternative is to either lower the cash amount or the profit percentage . &quot; Studios will look_for an opening to cut a salary if they can , &quot; Daniel says . &quot; Agents will look_for an increase or to hold_the_line . Studios rarely succeed. &quot; Some actors who ' ve had some bad_luck try to climb back_up by taking assignments in which they can shine but don ' t have to carry the film . Bruce Willis , for one , has done cameos and small roles that redefine his parameters as an actor . He ' s been garnering great notices for the upcoming Quentin Tarantino film &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; which had a budget of $ 8 million -- or almost half of what Willis will reportedly be getting_to star in &quot; Die Hard III. &quot; One star whose name rarely appears on the high-priced list , but is as big as most of those names , is Clint Eastwood . He is unique among the short-list players in that his long-term agreement with Warner Bros . waives big up-front payments in favor of a large share of a film ' s profits . Consequently , says one top agent , his films come_in under the $ 25-million average , allowing him to experiment with projects like &quot; White Hunter , Black Heart &quot; and &quot; Unforgiven. &quot; The former failed and both he and WB took their lumps . The latter was an Academy Award-winning blockbuster and everyone went_home much richer . Gender and Genre The &quot; price club &quot; is almost exclusively male . The reasons are that the most reliable genres are action films and comedies -- which are male-dominated -- &quot; and that most movies are written for men , &quot; says one producer . The exceptions are Roberts , Sharon Stone , Whoopi Goldberg and Barbra Streisand . &quot; Women , regrettably , have less to gain and less to lose , &quot; says Schiff . &quot; They ' re rarely called_on to carry movies and rarely given credit for their success. &quot; However , top-ranking women are not given as_many chances to fail , says the talent_agent . And Roberts and Stone are no exception . &quot; They have to be extremely careful about their material , &quot; says the agent , who is putting his money on more consistent and varied actresses like Jodie Foster , Meg Ryan and Michelle Pfeiffer . The same devaluation afflicts dramatic actors , male and female , although there are a select few -- Robert De Niro , Meryl Streep , Al Pacino -- who command high prices because they bring a certain critical cachet to their projects , despite the hit-and-miss performance of their individual films . Performers like Streisand , Redford and Dustin Hoffman set themselves apart by doing fewer films than they ' re offered . Consequently , each outing becomes an event -- at event prices . It would only be a slight exaggeration to say that such names as Cruise , Ford and Hanks attached_to a film version of the Los Angeles white pages would merit serious consideration from studios . Each has proven himself in various genres . And their percentage of recent hits to failures is extremely favorable . &quot; The fact that they could do the phone_book , however , doesn ' t mean that they should , &quot; says the talent_agent . What Price Stardom ? Those are the reasons certain stars can and do get megabucks for their films . But are they really worth it ? In terms of glamour and appeal , probably so . When it comes_to overall profitability of the movie business , maybe not . As Daniel points_out , the really profitable pictures this year have been &quot; Four Wedding and a Funeral , &quot; &quot; The Crow &quot; ( both independently released ) and &quot; Speed &quot; -- films without big box-office names and , consequently , much lower budgets . &quot; The high profit_margins come from the surprises , &quot; Daniel says . A hit movie with box-office names , a film such_as &quot; Maverick , &quot; not only costs more ( reportedly $ 60 million ) because of star salaries , but is ultimately less profitable for a studio because actors like Gibson retain what is called &quot; first dollar gross &quot; : They get a percentage of the gate from every ticket sold , even before the studio recoups its investment . The top stars get between 10 % and 15 % of the gross . &quot; You have to subtract at least $ 20 million of the profit from hit movies with stars who have gross participation , &quot; says Daniel . &quot; If you have more_than one gross player , &quot; says the Disney executive , &quot; in_order for the studio to make money , it has to be a really big success. &quot; But from the studios ' viewpoint , says the talent_agent , &quot; they ' re happy to collect their distribution fee ( 35 % of receipts ) and overhead ( 15 % of the budget ) . So the talent comes_out OK and so does the studio , even though films like ' Rain Man ' and ' Batman ' don ' t technically break even. &quot; Overall , the rate of return on movies today is &quot; pretty shabby , &quot; according to Dekom , who quotes a recent Variety statistic placing the figure at around 8.7 % . A better-performing mutual_fund returns 10 % to 13 % , he says . &quot; It used to be that the studios saw rates of return between 30 % and 50 % , &quot; says Dekom . &quot; Those profits have gone_to actors and some directors . They ' re the ones who make that profit today. &quot; Does that mean actors will eventually price themselves out of the market ? &quot; In theory , yes , &quot; says Dekom . &quot; In reality , no. &quot; *</TEXT>
