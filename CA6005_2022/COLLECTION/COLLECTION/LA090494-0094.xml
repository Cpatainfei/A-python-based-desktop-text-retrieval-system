   <HEADLINE> WESTSIDE WATCH : MAKING LIGHT OF HARMAN ' S INDECISION ON HEALTH_CARE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They could have held a sit-in or waved placards . Instead , they delivered balloons . Members of the Health_Care Reform Project , a coalition of unions and other groups , delivered about 100 helium-filled balloons to Rep . Jane Harman ' s LAX-area office , calling_on her to support one of the several reform plans -- preferably one with universal coverage -- that Congress has been debating . &quot; The balloons were not so_much a slap in the face but simply a colorful reminder ( of the health reform issue ) , &quot; said Jarvis Stewart , who organized the protest . Harman , a Rolling Hills Democrat whose district includes Marina del Rey , Westchester and Venice , &quot; just isn ' t saying ( what plan she supports ) , which is driving everyone crazy , &quot; said Joyce Moscato , a spokeswoman for the Service Employees International Union , a member of the project . Harman , who was not in her Century Boulevard office at the time of the demonstration , has not taken a position because &quot; she ' s at the point of weighing the options that are out there , &quot; said her chief_of_staff , Ed Hatcher . &quot; What ' s to criticize ? &quot; Hatcher said . &quot; You are talking_about a monumental policy issue . The fact that the congresswoman has to be deliberative and thoughtful in her approach is what her constituents expect from her. &quot; Harman is not alone in being singled_out . The Health_Care Reform Project has been staging the demonstrations across the country , either protesting lawmakers ' positions or their lack of one . * BIG SPENDERS : Many South Bay candidates for Congress or the state Senate spent well_over a_hundred grand in the June primary races . Most losers are stuck holding a hefty bill ; winners have spent much of the summer trying to raise more money . In the 36th Congressional District , Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks spent $ 179 # 720 in her successful bid for the Republican nomination , according to campaign finance reports . ( The figures include spending only since Jan . 1. ) Her opponent , former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance , spent almost twice as much : $ 336 # 589 , more_than half of which was his own money . Incumbent Jane Harman ( D-Rolling Hills ) , who had no opposition , spent $ 183 # 856 . But you have to look_to a state race -- the 28th State Senate District -- to find this year ' s biggest_spender : incumbent Ralph C . Dills ( D-El Segundo ) . He paid $ 459 # 797 , the bulk of it on a barrage of mailers in the last weeks of the race . His chief opponent , Torrance Councilman George Nakano , spent $ 195 # 797 . Dills won the race with 47 % of the vote to Nakano ' s 34 % . Attorney Michael Sidley , who spent $ 212 # 720 on his campaign this year , got 11 % of the vote . Manhattan Beach real_estate_broker Jo Ann Rodda got 8 % , spending less than $ 1 # 000 . Sidley financed much of his campaign with his own money or with loans from his father . But he plans to run_for office again . &quot; I think I was everybody ' s second choice , &quot; Sidley said . &quot; Next time around , I will be positioned very well. &quot; * SPEAKING OF SPENDING : Heard about taking_back our streets ? Well , here ' s a chance to take_back our Waterford crystal . This and more goes_on the auction_block at 3 p.m. Thursday in Century City . The occasion is the sale of booty seized by the U.S. Customs Service and the Internal Revenue Service ' s criminal investigations division . The site is the J.W. Marriott Hotel , 2151 Avenue of the Stars . Preview and registration start at noon . Among the items up for bid , organizers say , will be 900 ounces of gold bullion and rare coins seized in an IRS money_laundering case . There will also be 100 pieces of Waterford crystal and 150 bottles of rare wine that the Customs Service and other federal agencies bagged in a fraud and money_laundering case . Boy , those crooks must be miserable now .</TEXT>
