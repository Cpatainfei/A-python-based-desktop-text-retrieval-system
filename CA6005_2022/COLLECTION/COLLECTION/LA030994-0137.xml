   <HEADLINE> RAPID SHIFTS SIGNAL MAJOR QUAKE IN REGION IS LIKELY , EXPERT SAYS ; SEISMOLOGY : SCIENTIST CALLS SANTA CLARA RIVER AND OXNARD PLAIN HOT SPOTS , ADDING THAT AREA IS ONE OF THE FASTEST-MOVING PARTS OF THE STATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The geological plates underneath much of Ventura County are buckling and shifting rapidly , signaling that a major earthquake will likely hit the region , a seismologist said Tuesday . By measuring the rate at which the Earth ' s crust deforms , seismologists can identify which pockets of California are most vulnerable to earthquakes , Caltech scientist Kate Hutton told the Thousand Oaks City_Council . Ventura County , especially along the Santa Clara River and through the Oxnard Plain , qualifies as one of these hot spots . &quot; Seismologists have had their eyes on the Ventura basin , &quot; Hutton said during Tuesday ' s presentation designed to inform residents about the potential for future earthquakes . &quot; We can see that it ' s one of the fastest-moving parts of California , shrinking in a north-south direction . That pattern should have earthquakes accompanying it in the long term. &quot; While the imprecision of words such_as long term might frustrate shaky residents , Hutton said she simply could not offer detailed predictions . But she did say seismologists had reached a consensus that &quot; sometime in our lifetime we expect to see a magnitude-8 quake on the San Andreas Fault. &quot; Furthermore , she noted that &quot; there ' s still a lot of stress to be relieved &quot; by earth movement in a fan-shaped swath of land stretching from the western San Fernando Valley up through Simi Valley . Many of the aftershocks following January ' s 6.8-magnitude temblor have been centered in that region . &quot; The aftershock sequence is certainly not over , &quot; Hutton said . Commenting wryly on the vague language of seismologists , she added : &quot; One hundred years is an important time_scale for urban planners , but it ' s not necessarily useful for people planning their vacations. &quot; Because her specialty is seismology -- measuring and studying earthquakes -- Hutton could not answer council_members ' questions about the geology and soil composition in Thousand Oaks . She could say only that several active faults lie underneath the Conejo Valley . Other fault_lines thrusting from the ocean toward Point Mugu and Malibu could endanger Thousand Oaks as well . &quot; This is a seismically active area , so it ' s best to be prepared_for an earthquake , &quot; she said . To start her presentation , Hutton showed dozens of slides detailing devastation from the Northridge earthquake that struck before dawn Jan . 17 . None of the dramatic photos -- of collapsed buildings , ruptured freeways and sagging garages -- came from Thousand Oaks . But several illustrated possible dangers should a future earthquake hit closer to the Conejo Valley . One slide , for example , showed an expensive home with a tiled_roof that crashed to the ground during the heavy shaking . Many Thousand Oaks homes and businesses have red-tile roofs similar to the house in the photo . And indeed , Building and Safety Director Barry Branagan told the council that homeowners with tiled_roofs should expect some breakage during earthquakes . Most roof tiles are designed with an interlocking grid system , where the tiles click together but are not nailed_down , he said . &quot; There really is no such thing as a house that ' s earthquake-proof , &quot; Branagan said . &quot; That would be almost impossible to design . The whole idea is that the house will not collapse and , after the initial shaking stops , the residents can exit safely if need be. &quot; The weakness of interlocking roof tiles was especially apparent in the northern end of Thousand Oaks , which suffered the most damage in January ' s quake , Branagan said . In all , city building inspectors declared 10 homes unsafe , slapping them with red tags warning residents not to enter until the damage is repaired . An additional 174 homes received yellow tags , indicating limited entry . Branagan said his inspectors have looked_at 1 # 300 homes_in the past 2 1 / 2 months . Requests for inspections are still coming_in , he said . The City_Council agreed to schedule an open forum in the next few weeks for quake-shaken residents to voice concerns and frustrations . Branagan and City Atty . Mark Sellers will be_on hand to answer questions about building_codes , inspection practices and legal recourse in the case of faulty construction .</TEXT>
