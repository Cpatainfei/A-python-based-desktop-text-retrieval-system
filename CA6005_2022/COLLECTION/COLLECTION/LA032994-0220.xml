   <HEADLINE> CANON COMPUTER A LATECOMER TO PC MOVEMENT ; INDUSTRY : COSTA MESA COMPANY RELYING_ON BRAND NAME RECOGNITION , WITH AMBITIOUS GOAL OF $ 1 BILLION IN SALES BY 1997 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Yasuhiro Tsubota , president of Canon Computer_Systems Inc. , doesn ' t have a personal_computer on his desk . His secretary prints his electronic_mail for him every morning so he can read it and respond on paper . Tsubota has used PCs before , he says , so he isn ' t intimidated by them . His preference , though , is &quot; to deal with people rather than computers , &quot; he said . Soon enough , he will have a PC in his office as part of an internal electronic_mail network at the company headquarters in Costa Mesa . &quot; But I would use a computer as a driver uses a dashboard , &quot; he said , &quot; to get a quick look_at how our company is doing today. &quot; Tsubota has to know where his company stands to take the division , a relative latecomer in the computer_industry when it started in 1992 , from annual sales of $ 300 million now to its ambitious goal of $ 1 billion by 1997 . He is betting that Canon ' s reputation as a reliable brand name in the printer and copier business will win it PC customers . This year , he expects sales for the company , a privately held subsidiary of Tokyo-based Canon Inc. , to total $ 500 million . &quot; We plan to be very aggressive , &quot; he said . &quot; You have to do that in this industry or else. &quot; Tsubota is venturing onto a field that has defeated some formidable competitors . Cypress-based Mitsubishi Electronics America , for example , left the PC systems market in 1990 after losing more_than $ 65 million . But Tsubota is betting that Canon ' s game_plan -- a flexible management team that can respond quickly to fast-changing American tastes for computer products , a diverse line of low-priced PCs , the resurgence in brand loyalty and the technological superiority of its printers -- will guarantee his company a place among the industry ' s leaders . &quot; Japanese companies have done badly in the PC market in the last five years because the product cycles shortened and their centralized management operations reacted too slowly , &quot; said Philippe de Marcillac , PC analyst for Dataquest Inc. , a market researcher in San Jose . &quot; Canon is definitely late to the market . It has to move fast. &quot; Canon could have suffered the same fate as Mitsubishi . It stumbled in the PC market in 1989 , when the Japanese parent company introduced the Navigator , a computer that combined a PC , a printer , fax machine and telephone headset . The Japanese designers of the product , unfamiliar_with the U.S. market , didn ' t realize that the $ 2 # 449 computer lacked the speed and permanent memory to be competitive . It was discontinued in early 1992 , said Ron Okamoto , director of PC product marketing for Canon . Tsubota explained that there have always been two schools of thought_about PCs . &quot; One said the multiple functions would be integrated on the PC , while others believe they would be like separate stereo components. &quot; Navigator was introduced before its time , Canon officials say , and it taught them to create an autonomous U.S. subsidiary that could anticipate market trends better . Tsubota , fresh from consulting for Steve Jobs ' NeXT Computer Inc. , was brought_in to head the Canon computer unit in April , 1992 . The parent company gave him $ 20 million to create the organization . While other brand-name companies have been slashing their prices to wipe_out competition from so-called clone makers , Canon has banked instead on using the success of its unique printer technology to expand its PC sales , which now account_for roughly 20 % of the parent company ' s overall revenue . The so-called BubbleJet printer lays_down tiny bubbles of quick-drying ink on paper with nearly the same print quality as a laser_printer but at a lower cost . Canon has won 5 # 000 patents related to the technology since the 1970s . It exchanges licenses on the patents with market leader Hewlett-Packard Co . and makes the hardware , or engines , for HP ' s laser_printers . But in the lower end of the market for so-called inkjet printers , Canon chose to compete with HP . Canon has seized 18 % of the inkjet printer market from HP , which holds 51 % , according to Dataquest . Earlier this year , Canon launched a second generation of bubble-jet printers to appeal_to small businesses that can ' t afford laser_printers , which cost three times as much . Canon has also introduced a color bubble-jet printer . That market is expected to grow from 1.2-million units sold in 1994 to 2.72 million by 1997 , according to BIS Strategic Decisions in Norwell , Mass . Canon has about 5 % of the market , while HP has 90 % . For Canon , &quot; printing is their ticket for the future , &quot; said David Dukes , co-chairman of Ingram Micro Inc. , a computer distributor based in Santa Ana . The black-and-white printers are priced at about $ 399 , low enough to be affordable for the small businesses that Canon has targeted for its computer sales . Analyst De Marcillac said that strategy seems wise , given that small businesses and home_offices will soon be the largest part of the market . Canon ' s computers are sold in more_than 5 # 000 stores now , up from about 3 # 800 last fall . Tsubota is expanding the number to target larger corporations as well as the government . The company also successfully revived the multi-function computer concept with a new model , the seven-pound NoteJet , which doubles as a portable_computer and a bubble-jet printer . Okamoto considers it the company ' s flagship product , and he predicts more innovations to come . The company faces challenges , one of the biggest being from HP . &quot; We shipped 5 million inkjet printers last year , &quot; said Richard Snyder , group general_manager for HP ' s deskjet printer group in Vancouver , Wash . &quot; that ' s means we ship more in a month than Canon does_in a year. &quot; But Canon isn ' t wavering from its goal of having $ 1 billion in revenue by 1997 , Tsubota said , and he envisions the company growing from 200 employees now to about 500 . Recent expansion has been outside Orange County , where Canon employs 130 at its headquarters . The company built a warehouse and computer assembly_plant in Memphis , Tenn. , and established a research unit in Portland , Ore. , to develop computers that run software developed by NeXT , in which Canon owns a stake . The company chose to build outside California , Tsubota said , not to escape the state ' s high business costs but to locate the warehouse near the assembly_plant . The philosophy at Canon , as at other Japan-based computer makers , is that a company should design and manufacture its products in the markets where they are sold , Tsubota said , so that management can stay flexible . &quot; Our structure is set_up so that we have more freedom here , &quot; he said . &quot; Japan participates only in certain product lines. &quot; This year , Canon has already introduced 10 computer models , including a new printer line and color scanners . Tsubota ' s strategy so far has been to divide the company ' s resources among several categories of computers : portables , office models and multimedia computers , which have fancy video and sound capabilities for entertainment software . Tsubota is also betting that the industry ' s new PowerPC computer chips , the first to challenge Intel Corp. ' s hold_on the market for the microprocessor , or main computing brain , will gain acceptance slowly over the next several years . The chips are a product of a joint_venture of Apple , IBM and Motorola . Canon would make computers based on the chips under a license . &quot; we ' ll jump in when the timing is right , &quot; he said .
