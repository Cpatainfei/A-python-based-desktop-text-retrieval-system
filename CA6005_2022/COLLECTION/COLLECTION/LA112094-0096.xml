   <HEADLINE> TEXAS BUNKERS HOUSE NUCLEAR ARMS MATERIAL ; PLUTONIUM : COMPONENTS WILL REMAIN INDEFINITELY IN GROUND BECAUSE NO DECISION HAS BEEN MADE ON FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Think_of William A . Weinreich as the warden of a maximum security federal institution -- miles of razor wire , electronic sensors , fortified watchtowers , heavy steel doors , guards with automatic weapons . The occupants are dangerous and potentially explosive . But this is not a prison , and Weinreich ' s charges are not people . As the general_manager of the Energy_Department ' s Pantex plant northwest of Amarillo , Weinreich is the custodian of more_than 6 # 000 bowling-ball-size &quot; pits &quot; of highly toxic plutonium retrieved from dismantled nuclear_weapons . Removed from bombs and missiles and separated from casings of high_explosive , these pits -- each the former trigger of a nuclear_weapon capable of incinerating hundreds of thousands of people -- are stored in racks in earth-covered bunkers . There they will remain indefinitely because the U.S._government has not decided what to do with all that surplus plutonium . It ' s a sensitive issue , because as little as 15 pounds of plutonium can easily be fashioned into a crude bomb , a potential goal for terrorists . As the U.S. nuclear_weapons stockpile shrinks rapidly in the post-Cold War era , Pantex is the only one of the Energy_Department ' s network of nuclear_weapons facilities that is getting busier . This is where the old weapons come_to meet their end , and Pantex is to plutonium what Ft . Knox is to gold . Not that big a deal , according to Weinreich , who -- like many people who have spent their careers working with nuclear_weapons -- views them with respect but not fear . &quot; We put people through a lot of training and we have a lot of security , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re fairly comfortable with our procedures &quot; for preventing either of the two worst things that could happen here : a nuclear accident , or invasion and seizure of plutonium by terrorists or other rogue groups . Weinreich and other officials of Mason &amp; Hanger-Silas Mason Inc. , the Energy_Department ' s operating contractor here , point_out that Pantex workers have been assembling nuclear_weapons and taking them apart for more_than 40 years without a major accident or breach of security . But for most of that time the plutonium was recycled into new weapons . Now the United States is not building nuclear_weapons , so the weapons-ready material has nowhere to go . As the U.S. stockpile of strategic nuclear_warheads heads down from an estimated peak of 12 # 000 in 1987 to a target of 3 # 500 in 2003 , about 1 # 400 weapons a year are being disassembled here and their plutonium pits are added_to the surplus . The Energy_Department promised in January to limit the number of pits in &quot; interim &quot; storage here to 12 # 000 &quot; until further decisions are reached concerning long-term storage of plutonium. &quot; The Energy_Department is coordinating a Clinton_Administration study of long-term disposition options for the plutonium , but in the meantime the Administration has not yet officially made the most fundamental decision : whether the material is waste to be destroyed or a potential_energy resource to be kept available if needed . Pantex lies_in the approach_path of Amarillo airport , and officials acknowledged some concern about what might happen if a plane crashed into one of the bunkers and started a fire that would spread plutonium in the atmosphere . As for terrorists , security supervisor Dale F . Morgan smiled as he displayed the weapons carried by Pantex guards , including an M-60 light machine_gun . It is theoretically possible for someone to parachute into Pantex or land a helicopter , he said , &quot; but it would n ' t do ' em much good . They might get_in , but they would n ' t get out. &quot;</TEXT>
