   <HEADLINE> FDA ALLOWS LABELS FOR MILK FROM COWS NOT GIVEN HORMONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stores and dairies can label milk as coming from cows not treated with a controversial new hormone , but the labels can ' t suggest the milk is any safer than that from treated animals , the government said Monday . In guidelines to be published today , the Food and Drug Administration said companies may label milk , ice_cream and other dairy_products as coming from &quot; cows not treated with &quot; recombinant bovine somatotropin . But the label also would have to carry a statement like , &quot; No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rbST-treated and non-rbST-treated cows , &quot; the agency said . The genetically engineered version of the naturally occurring hormone went_on the market Friday . The agency said labels could not carry the claim that milk is &quot; bST-free &quot; because the hormone occurs naturally in milk .</TEXT>
