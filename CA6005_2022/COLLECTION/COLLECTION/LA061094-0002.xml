   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW ; A MIXED BAG OF MOSTLY GAY FICTION IS EVOCATIVE , GENERIC ; DANGEROUS DESIRES , BY PETER WELLS ( VIKING ; $ 20.95 , 220 PAGES )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Timing is important , even in telling a story that happens all_over the world every moment : a young_man ' s discovery that he is gay . For too long , this story couldn ' t be told at all , or had to be disguised . Then , a generation ago , there was a brief , golden moment when a gay writer ' s personal struggle coincided with the larger story of gayness going public . Telling it , then , was an act of courage ; the social significance of the story enhanced its literary value or , in some cases , compensated for its flaws . No longer . Even in New Zealand , where Peter Wells sets these three novellas and five short_stories , openly gay lives and the ravages of AIDS are old news . This doesn ' t mean that Wells ' subject_matter is any less suitable for fiction than it was before . Who would object to heterosexual love_stories just because they have been written for centuries ? But it does mean that , once again , literary value is the only kind that counts . For Wells , a filmmaker best known for his 1986 adaptation of James Agee ' s novel &quot; A Death in the Family , &quot; this is his first book of fiction . Though &quot; Dangerous Desires &quot; won prizes , including the New Zealand Fiction Award , it ' s a mixed bag . Wells ' prose is sometimes subtly evocative , sometimes only mannered ; he deals intelligently with serious issues but often without fully rendering them into stories -- assuming a margin of error that no longer exists . Three of the shorter_stories are linked . In the first , a 38-year-old Auckland food writer named Eric finds that his old friend Perrin -- whom he had met on his first tentative visit to a gay bar -- has AIDS . In the second , he cares_for the ailing Perrin while trying to relate to his current , much younger lover , Matthew . In the third , with Perrin dead and Matthew gone , Eric consoles himself with anonymous gropings in &quot; that dark zone of pleasure known as a sex club. &quot; The vain , crotchety Perrin is a good character , but Eric is gen eric . Wells eloquently mourns AIDS ' &quot; savage hewing down of men who had just climbed out of the darkness &quot; of the closet , and celebrates , even in the face of death , &quot; the grid of sexual_desire , which lit_up the entire globe in great flames of energy . . . a kind of life force , &quot; but the stories themselves , as distinct from the ideas they express , are static . Things get_even slower in one of the novellas , &quot; Bum to You , Chum. &quot; A 34-year-old newspaperman named Nick Burns finds evidence that &quot; Aunty Tizz , &quot; the woman who lived next door to the grandparents who raised him , had actually been his mother . He travels_to Sulphur City , a volcanic resort area , to find someone who knew Tizz and can shed_light_on her life of pretense , which he compares to his own life as a gay_man . An interesting idea , surely . Add a colorful setting , good dialogue ( though not enough of it ) and a brave affirmation that even pickup sex in public_toilets need not be sordid , and the story should work . But it doesn ' t . Too_much of it consists_of Nick brooding over old photos in his motel_room and drinking gin ; and Wells ' description , like steam from the sulfur pools , blurs more_than it reveals . The other two novellas , in contrast , show Wells at his best . &quot; One of THEM ! &quot; is the basic gay coming-of-age story , told with the drama and individuality that each retelling needs . Two teen-age boys -- slim Jamie and fat Lemmy -- don ' t yet know they are gay , though we know and their parents and teachers have suspicions . Jamie tells the story , but it ' s Lemmy who first identifies the fate that has been bearing_down_on them all along . Plenty of conflicts here , against a backdrop of schoolboy pranks , popular_music and dreams of Swinging London , epicenter of hipness for the English-speaking world . Plenty of scenes -- this is what we miss in Wells ' less successful stories , in which the characters tend to slip_by one another rather than collide . &quot; Of Memory and Desire &quot; is a twofold departure : The lovers are heterosexual and Japanese . A young executive , Keiji , marries an older , lower-class woman , Sayo , against his mother ' s wishes . He is a virgin ; she is sexually experienced . On honeymoon in New Zealand , they struggle to communicate in erotic , savage scenes that recall D.H. Lawrence or Yukio Mishima . The foreignness of his characters forces Wells to make them act_as much as they think . And , as in the gay stories , their fringe status only emphasizes the human ordinariness of most of what they feel .</TEXT>
