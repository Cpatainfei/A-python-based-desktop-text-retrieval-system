   <HEADLINE> O.C. KILLING SHATTERS ROMANIANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Zoia Ungureanu ' s voice , once famous throughout her native Romania , had been virtually silent for more_than a decade . A celebrated pop and folk_singer during the reign of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu , she had been kept_off the stage after emigrating to the United States in 1983 by a jealous husband and hard_times . The woman who had once entertained Romanian television and nightclub audiences in seven languages worked here as a department_store makeup artist . With a turbulent marriage behind her , the 41-year-old performer was reviving her singing career and dreaming of opening a jazz club when her estranged husband , Lorel Ungureanu , gunned her down in a murder-suicide outside her home Jan . 28 , friends and authorities said . &quot; She was so happy to be singing again , &quot; said her 22-year-old niece , Margo Campeanu . &quot; that ' s what hurts her family the most , knowing that she was finally happy. &quot; The slaying came just after Zoia Ungureanu had triumphantly returned to the stage , performing recently in what she called &quot; comeback concerts &quot; with other Romanian immigrants in Fullerton and Hollywood , said Aristide Buhoiu , editor and publisher of Universul , a Romanian-language newspaper based in Los Angeles . While even the woman ' s closest neighbors in the condominium complex knew little about her background , the singer ' s death was front page news in her native Romania -- where she was known as Zoia Campeanu -- and to the community of 120 # 000 Romanian expatriates who live_in Southern California . &quot; I think people had wondered what had happened to her , &quot; said Buhoiu , who attended her recent performances along with hundreds of other Romanian immigrants . Her husband &quot; was very jealous , &quot; Buhoiu said . &quot; She got very isolated in Orange County because of her husband . But she was so happy to be up there on the stage again that she would not accept any money for the performances . And she performed great . She was still so very good. &quot; As a co-worker watched , Lorel Ungureanu shot his estranged wife twice at close range_in the parking_lot outside her condominium , hitting her in the face and torso before turning the handgun on himself , police said . Zoia Ungureanu &quot; was walking_around to get_in my car when she saw him , &quot; said Tina Browning , who had arrived just minutes before the shooting to take her friend to dinner . &quot; They talked for a_few minutes , then she turned_away quickly and walked to my car . I opened the door for her . Then he walked very fast behind her ( and ) said , ' Zoia ! ' She turned_around and he shot her and shot her again. &quot; Friends and family said this week that Zoia Ungureanu left her husband three months ago after eight years of an often turbulent marriage . Lorel Ungureanu often threatened his wife and verbally abused her , they said , keeping her from her first love , singing , out of jealousy . Later , after Lorel Ungureanu ' s business went sour , his wife was forced to support the family as a cosmetologist . After the couple separated , Lorel Ungureanu ' s life appeared to be falling_apart , friends and family said . He was facing hard_times financially , had been sued by his former business partner and was distraught over the prospect of losing his wife , they said . &quot; There were so many problems around him , &quot; said Sebastian Pereanu , a longtime friend who emigrated to the United States with Lorel Ungureanu 20 years ago . &quot; The last time I spoke_to him , he was very depressed. &quot; News of the shootings quickly spread throughout Southern California ' s Romanian immigrants , many of whom live_in Los Angeles . Zoia Ungureanu ' s parents in Chicago received hundreds of telephone_calls from friends and admirers they had never met , Margo Campeanu said . &quot; People are very , very upset , believe me , &quot; said Michael Istrate , owner of Mignon , the oldest Romanian restaurant in Los Angeles and a regular gathering place for expatriate Romanians . The couple , who met at a beauty trade show in Chicago in 1986 , were married that year at Istrate ' s restaurant before more_than 150 guests . &quot; It was just the happiest day , &quot; Istrate recalled . &quot; The restaurant was_full of people and Zoia sang for everyone . Everything was beautiful. &quot; At that time , Lorel Ungureanu was a successful businessman and a partner in Venice Trading Co . Inc. , which manufactured furniture and equipment used in beauty_salons . But he and his partner in the company , Claudio Bonazza , had a bitter business dispute in 1989 which resulted in Lorel Ungureanu selling his 50 % interest in the company to Bonazza , according to court records . &quot; He had been very rich . . . . But he went from having several Mercedes and houses to nothing , &quot; Buhoiu said . At the time of their deaths , Lorel and Zoia Ungureanu were being sued by Bonazza for allegedly producing and marketing equipment that was &quot; confusingly similar &quot; to Bonazza ' s products , the lawsuit claims . Bonazza declined to discuss his former business partner or the lawsuit , which is pending in Orange County Superior_Court . By all accounts , Zoia Ungureanu had tried to remain on friendly terms with her husband after their November separation . She spent Christmas and New Year ' s Eve with him and his two young sons from a previous marriage . Zoia Ungureanu had helped raise the boys , ages 13 and 14 , who are now living with their mother . &quot; My aunt ' s biggest mistake was that she kept_in touch when she left , &quot; Margo Campeanu said . &quot; I think she was so scared that she wanted to be polite and diplomatic and tried to end things in a nice way . But he was so miserable and realized she wasn ' t coming_back . He was penniless and had lost everything. &quot; At the time of her death , Zoia Ungureanu was employed by Shiseido Cosmetics as a makeup artist at Nordstrom ' s in the Brea Mall , Browning said . &quot; She was afraid that something would happen , &quot; Browning said . &quot; She would come_to work and tell me that she was scared . That night , she sounded depressed and I told her that I was taking her to dinner . When I arrived to pick her up , she looked absolutely beautiful , as always . I compared her to Ivana Trump. &quot; Browning said that as the pair walked to her car shortly after 8 p.m. , Lorel Ungureanu drove_up to the condominium complex in the 800 block of Springwood Street . After the shooting , as Zoia Ungureanu lay on the asphalt of the complex ' s parking_lot , Browning said she drove_away in panic to call police . She said she did not see Lorel Ungureanu shoot himself . The couple were married two years after Ungureanu divorced his first wife , Linda Jean Cox , the mother of his two sons . Cox , too , had contended that Lorel Ungureanu was abusive . In court papers Cox filed at the time of the couple ' s separation , she claimed he beat , pushed and kicked her in the presence of their children . Ungureanu has &quot; a very violent and uncontrollable temper . He flares_up at the slightest incident and goes crazy with rage , &quot; Cox declared in court records . She claimed Ungureanu vowed to kill her if she ever complained to police or anyone else . But the courts and Orange police have no record of Zoia Ungureanu taking legal_action to keep her husband away from her . Police &quot; had no indication that she was fearful of him or that there was any domestic violence prior ( to the shooting ) , &quot; said Lt . Timm Browne . &quot; There wasn ' t anything that would lead us to believe that this would be the outcome. &quot; Times staff writers Lynn Franey and Rene Lynch contributed to this report .</TEXT>
