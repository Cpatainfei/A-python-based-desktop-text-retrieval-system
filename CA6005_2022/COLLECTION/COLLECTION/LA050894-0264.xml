   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ; SWEDEN IS LED BY GOALIE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Goalkeepers naturally hate giving_up goals . For Thomas Ravelli , it was a relief finally conceding his first goal after four straight shutouts , including one for Sweden ' s national team . &quot; Letting_in that goal was probably good , &quot; Ravelli says . &quot; The media would have started writing even more about my shutouts , and that adds mental pressure. &quot; Ravelli , 34 , is the most experienced goalkeeper in this World Cup . He was unscored upon for 8 hours 45 minutes during the first month of the Swedish season . The stretch started April 10 after Ravelli gave_up a 10th-minute goal for IFK Goteborg in the Swedish first division and ended 15 days later with just 10 minutes left of another league game . In between , he also played for Sweden in a 2-0 exhibition victory at Wales . &quot; Sure , shutouts are nice , &quot; Ravelli says . &quot; But only if you play well and your team wins . You don ' t play for the shutouts . You play to win . The shutout is just a bonus. &quot; IFK Goteborg started the season 5-0 . Sweden ' s World Cup team also is off to a good start . Despite missing several key players who had commitments with their foreign-based clubs , Sweden won the Joe Robbie Cup in Miami by beating the United States , 3-1 , in February . Ravelli ' s backup , Lars Eriksson , played in that game , but Ravelli earned a shutout in a scoreless tie against Colombia . The 1990 World Cup was a nightmare for Ravelli . He gave_up six goals as Sweden lost all three preliminary-round games by 2-1 scores to Brazil , Scotland and Costa Rica . Ravelli predicts better results for Sweden this summer . &quot; But only barring injuries to the key players , &quot; he says . &quot; Don ' t expect good results if three , four players are not fully fit or if they ' re coming_back from recent injuries and aren ' t match-tough . We don ' t have the depth compared to other teams. &quot; Coach Tommy Svensson , who led the Swedes to the semifinals in the 1992 European Championship , is expected to keep Ravelli in goal throughout the World Cup . Last year , Ravelli joined the elite group of players who have made at least 100 appearances for their national team . Ravelli earned his 107th &quot; cap &quot; against Wales and if he plays the remaining exhibitions and first-round World Cup games against Cameroon , Russia and Brazil , he would be just one game shy of Bjorn Nordqvist ' s Swedish record of 115 games . Two retired goalkeepers , Peter Shilton of England and Pat Jennings of Northern_Ireland , top the career list with 125 and 119 games respectively . &quot; It ' s one of my goals to break his record , &quot; Ravelli says of Shilton . &quot; It depends_on how I ' m playing , but I plan to go_on for at least two more years . We have the European Championship finals in 1996 and I ' d like to play in England if we qualify. &quot; Making the 1992 European semifinals was great , but &quot; we lost to the Germans and didn ' t make the final . So honestly , I hope the biggest moment of my career is yet to come_before I retire. &quot; Maybe in the United States this summer .</TEXT>
