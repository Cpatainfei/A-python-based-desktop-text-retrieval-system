   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY : APOCALYPSE NOT ; CBS MOVIE ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A BELIEVABLE CATACLYSMIC EVENT THAT NO ONE ACTUALLY WILL BELIEVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Oct . 30 , 1938 , much of America panicked as Orson Welles ' &quot; Mercury Theater on the Air &quot; presented H.G. Wells ' &quot; The War of the Worlds &quot; as an apparent live radio-news broadcast of a Martian invasion . Now 56 years later , CBS hopes to scare the living daylights out of viewers Sunday evening with &quot; Without Warning , &quot; a science-fiction drama that simulates a live television_news broadcast . While we ' ve had warning this time around , reality and fiction continue to collide . The premise : Three pieces of a huge asteroid suddenly plunge to Earth and land in China , France and the United States . The regularly scheduled movie-of-the-week is preempted by the &quot; Evening World News &quot; anchored by veteran newscaster Sander Vanocur . Besides Vanocur , &quot; Without Warning &quot; features scientist and science-fiction writer Arthur C . Clarke ( &quot; 2001 : A Space Odyssey &quot; ) and TV journalists Bree Walker-Lampley , Warren Olney and Sandy Hill . Actress Jane Kaczmarek plays Vanocur ' s co-anchor . &quot; Without Warning &quot; isn ' t the first time a network has presented a TV movie masquerading as a newscast . In 1983 , NBC aired the acclaimed &quot; Special Bulletin &quot; about the threatened nuclear destruction of Charleston , S.C. , written by Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz , who later created &quot; thirtysomething. &quot; However , in &quot; Special Bulletin &quot; actors , not actual television journalists , played newscasters . CBS plans to air disclaimers throughout &quot; Without Warning &quot; explaining that the film is a fictionalized newscast . The disclaimers will begin before the program starts and continue at frequent intervals throughout , says Kenneth Martin , director of program practices . &quot; It will be at least every 15 minutes , &quot; he says . The first disclaimer will say : &quot; ' Without Warning ' is a realistic depiction of fictional events . None of what you are about to see is actually happening. &quot; During the program the disclaimer will change to , &quot; None of what you are seeing is actually happening. &quot; As far as responding to audiences ' fears , Martin says , &quot; Our audience services_area in New York will be responding to inquiries , &quot; he says . &quot; We are interested in having a very compelling and dramatically intense program that is highly believable , but which no one believes. &quot; &quot; Without Warning &quot; was inspired by the events that occurred last July when fragments from the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 struck the planet Jupiter in numerous places . At the time , executive producer Mark Wolper ( &quot; Queen &quot; ) , son of executive producer David Wolper , happened to be perusing old scripts from Wolper Organization files to see if any might still be viable as network fare . &quot; I happened to be doing one of my searches and came_across this script called ' July 13th , ' written in 1969 , &quot; Wolper says during a break_in the filming at a Burbank sound stage . &quot; I read the script and said , ' This is perfect . This is asteroids coming and hitting the Earth. ' So the next day , which was a Friday , I gave the script to CBS and on Monday they called and ordered it. &quot; The original script by David Seltzer ( &quot; Punchline &quot; ) was revised by former Emmy-winning ABC News correspondent Peter Lance . The first thing Lance did was take an intensive course in astronomy from the film ' s technical adviser , Donald Yeomans , senior research scientist at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena . &quot; I basically treated the script like a piece of journalism , &quot; Lance says . &quot; I took the weekend to understand the science . I wanted to do something that would be really believable . I wanted the science to be bulletproof . If you are going_to do something that comes_out of the headlines and appears to be a news broadcast , it has to make_sense . It has to have logic to it. &quot; Yeomans is impressed with the technical details of the film . &quot; It ' s not a documentary , so within the limits of the story itself , we tried to keep it quite realistic , &quot; he says . &quot; There is always a chance of getting hit with an asteroid . We make the point in the script that it is very unlikely , but very unlikely is not the same thing as impossible . These comets smacking into Jupiter this summer show this kind of thing on a cosmic_time scale happens all_the time . In a human lifetime it ' s quite a rare event . The Earth is not immune to these impacts. &quot; According to Yeomans , 250 large asteroids relatively near Earth are being tracked by scientists . Still , he adds , &quot; that ' s only 10 % of the believed ( asteroid ) population . The large ones we can track for hundreds of years into the future and see if they get close to the Earth . We do that at JPL. &quot; The problem , Yeomans says , are the smaller ones . &quot; The 200-meter-sized objects have to get very close to the Earth before they ' re bright enough to be seen . What ' s worse is that if they are heading straight for you on a collision course , it ' s almost impossible to see until the very last minute. &quot; To further heighten the realism in the film , Wolper sought_out real newscasters . &quot; We thought nobody could be better news reporters than news reporters , so whenever possible we tried to hire news reporters . They were very excited and they loved it . We had to audition them for the parts , so we only selected people we thought could carry it. &quot; Actors are interspersed among the real news people . &quot; We are trying to convince people this is news and fool people , but at_the_same_time , this is drama , &quot; Wolper explains . &quot; I needed actors to play the more dramatic roles -- the breaking_down , the crying . Those kinds of scenes I have given to actors , because it ' s very difficult for news reporters to do that because they don ' t have acting experience. &quot; &quot; Acting &quot; as himself in movies is fun for the genial Vanocur , a renowned correspondent for NBC , ABC and PBS . He recently appeared as himself in &quot; Dave &quot; and &quot; TimeCop. &quot; &quot; This is being filmed_over a period of four days , &quot; Vanocur explains during his lunch break . &quot; I started_out ( in the film ) low key and now I ' m trying , though I ' m not a trained actor , to convey a sense that I ' m still dispassionate . But something is going_on and I ' m not quite sure what it is . But I can ' t go beyond what the information is , so unless I start to eat the furniture and the drapes at the end , I will remain rather dispassionate. &quot; Vanocur doesn ' t know if &quot; Without Warning &quot; will scare media-sophisticated audiences . &quot; Even though there are disclaimers , there ' s an awful lot of channel surfing , &quot; he says . And , he adds , &quot; I think the line between reality and fiction gets increasingly blurred . For example , I was in Nashville watching the NBA playoffs and suddenly there ' s O.J. Simpson ( in the white Ford Bronco ) . I still don ' t know what that was . Was it news ? Was it fiction ? Was it theater ? &quot; The newscast depicted in &quot; Without Warning , &quot; Vanocur says , is neither tabloid nor sensationalized . &quot; I think there ' s a great attention to detail , accuracy and no attempts as far as I can see to make_it more hyped up then it needs to be . The tension arises from the story itself . Some of the scenes are realistic and , I think , because of the Shoemaker-Levy earlier this year , a lot of people think that may be the way the world will end. &quot; &quot; If I had still been a correspondent at ABC News , I ' d have done this as a piece on ' 20 / 20 , ' &quot; Lance says . &quot; I ' d have done this as a piece of journalism . It has to be done_in a really responsible way . So , throughout the two hours , it ' s done_in ' real time. ' At the beginning , it clearly looks_like an asteroid problem . And then , little by little , all_of this evidence starts surfacing and sort of semi-responsible members of the search-for-intelligent-life community begin to make charges that there may be something more . ( The newscasters ) keep coming_back and saying this is speculation . I think ( in the movie ) you get what the best TV network would do today , what the most responsible TV network would do if something like this ever happened in real time. &quot; Wolper says &quot; Without Warning &quot; is meant to skewer the &quot; tabloidy kind of people . Hopefully , what will happen with this show is that it will spark a lot of controversy after it airs . People will be scared . Is this responsible_for a network to put_on a show like this that could potentially scare people ? When you get that controversy going , then it sparks conversations on what shows should be and the line between news and drama. &quot; But , Wolper adds , the movie also pokes_fun at the &quot; TV movie-of-the-week makers because we have a little fake movie-of-the week at the beginning of this with Loni Anderson . that ' s kind of humorous in itself . That is what we break_into it . So we are making_fun of ourselves , which is interesting because our company , the Wolper Organization , is known for documenting reality with ' Roots , ' ' North and South ' and all_the Wolper documentaries . Now we are creating reality and fictionalizing the documentation of it . We are making our own reality and covering it. &quot; Because Wolper and director Robert Iscove have no news experience , Wolper knew he needed the expertise of news veterans who understood the business . So he hired Lance and producer Nancy Platt Jacoby , a former CBS News producer and KCBS-TV executive producer . &quot; We needed someone who understood how ( news ) is done , understood how ( newscasters ) talk , so it will be as real as possible , &quot; Wolper says . &quot; The audience is smart . They will know if you are faking them or not. &quot; &quot; Without Warning &quot; was taped in just 17 days . Besides shooting at the Burbank studio , crews were dispatched to Washington , D.C. , New York City , Los Angeles , Moscow ' s Red Square , China ' s Tian An Men Square , Paris and Sri Lanka . &quot; We are shooting simultaneously , &quot; Wolper says . &quot; It has been very difficult . Everything happens at night and with our time schedule and time frame , we had to get permission to shoot in all_of these areas. &quot; But the hasty schedule , he says , actually served the picture &quot; because in the frantic nature of trying to get the work done , it ' s giving the feel of news , which is always very frantic . I think it has helped_out the process that we had to rush because news people would have to do that too. &quot; Putting the production together was a learning experience . &quot; How do we get all_of this material together ? How do we shoot it ? &quot; were some of the questions he had to ask . &quot; Do I hire a film crew on the outside to shoot or do I hire a real news crew because they know how news is shot ? &quot; Eventually , Wolper hired a combination of crews and brought_in a supervising director of photography who is responsible_for the look of the whole movie . Still , Wolper says , &quot; I didn ' t want too_much continuity. &quot; Wolper hopes &quot; Without Warning &quot; terrifies audiences . &quot; What I suspect will happen is that if you sit_down and start watching this , about five minutes into it , you ' ll say , ' My God . Is this really happening ? ' The first thing audiences are going_to do is pick_up their channel changer and switch it to CNN or another network to see if the other network is covering it . And then they will go_back to our channel because they won ' t want to miss anything. &quot; &quot; Without Warning &quot; premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS .</TEXT>
