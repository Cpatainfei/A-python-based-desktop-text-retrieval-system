   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : TUSTIN ; CITY ATTORNEY QUITS POST , CITES ELECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> City Atty . James G . Rourke said Thursday that he has retired as a municipal employee and has given_up his medical and life_insurance benefits to keep his employment from becoming an issue during campaigning for the April 12 city election . But Rourke , 67 , said he will stay_on as a contract attorney for the city through his law_firm , Orange-based Rourke , Woodruff &amp; Spradlin , which already provides legal services to the city . &quot; Certain people are trying to make me an ( election ) issue , &quot; said Rourke , who has worked for the city since 1953 . &quot; But I ' m not supporting any candidate , nor am I opposed to any candidate. &quot; Four candidates are contesting the two City_Council seats at stake in the election and two of them , Michael Doyle and Tracy Worley , have said that the city must find ways to cut legal expenses , including possibly hiring an in-house attorney . The other candidates , incumbents Leslie Anne Pontious and Charles Puckett , said they are satisfied with Rourke ' s work . In a letter to council_members on Jan . 24 , Rourke said he would give_up his benefits , including participating in the Public Employees Retirement System . Finance Director Ron Nault said the city pays about $ 1 # 700 a month for Rourke ' s life and medical insurance_premiums and contributions to the retirement_plan and a so-called deferred compensation plan . Since the city joined PERS in the 1960s , contributions to PERS on Rourke ' s behalf have reached more_than $ 90 # 000 . Rourke said he expects pension payments from PERS of about $ 40 # 000 a year . Rourke ' s announcement has added a new twist to the campaign . This week , Doyle and Worley , who are seeking public office for the first time , were endorsed by the police and city employee unions . Anne Bonner , who heads the employee union , said it is backing Doyle and Worley because they appear to be more sensitive to the views of the employees about labor problems . Bonner said union_representatives interviewed the candidates to seek their ideas on certain issues . Pontious declined to be interviewed by the unions . &quot; I think it would be a conflict_of_interest to seek their endorsement , &quot; Pontious said.BERT ELJERA</TEXT>
