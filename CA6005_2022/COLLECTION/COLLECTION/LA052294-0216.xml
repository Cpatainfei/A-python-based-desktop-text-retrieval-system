   <HEADLINE> KLOPAS SCORES TWO BUT can ' t HEAD OFF U.S. LOSS ; SOCCER : DEFENSE BREAKS_DOWN IN SECOND_HALF AS BAYERN MUNICH WINS , 3-2 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In most countries , Frank Klopas ' hot head would have earned him a place on front pages , billboards and perhaps even ballots for political office . With his two goals Saturday , both on headers , he has six in the last six games . But the Greek first division veteran is now playing soccer in the United States , where six or even 60 goals and a_couple_of dollars still will not buy a glass of ouzo . He also is playing for a side , the U.S. national team , that often cannot win even with an exceptional performance from one of its performers . That was the situation at Municipal Stadium , where a crowd of 16 # 492 left not in elation over Klopas ' goals but in distress over the final score . It was Klopas 2 , Bayern Munich 3 . Even though it would not be fair , it would be easy to second-guess U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic for removing Klopas from the game at the end of the first_half , when his team had a 2-1 lead . But Milutinovic is more concerned about this summer ' s World Cup than he is about beating Bayern Munich and wanted to see Ernie Stewart , who arrived 11 days ago after finishing his season with a Dutch professional team , play the striker position . Besides , it was not the offense that cost the United States the game but the defense , which broke_down often in the second_half , giving_up two goals within one particularly stupefying four-minute stretch . So now there are only three games remaining for Milutinovic to find the answers to his prayers before the United States opens play June 18 against Switzerland in the World Cup . Asked about U.S. chances in that monthlong tournament , Bayern Munich ' s general_manager , Uli Hoeness , said : &quot; If the United States plays like that , it will be very difficult for them. &quot; But the U.S. coaching staff did not panic after Saturday ' s loss for a_couple_of reasons , one of them having to do with the strength of its opponent . Bayern Munich , the champion of Germany ' s first division , would be a match for a number of national teams , and one of its assets is its depth . Among the five starters absent Saturday was striker Adolfo Valenica of Colombia , but Mehmet Scholl moved_up from his usual position in the midfield and scored two goals . Also , the United States was unveiling a new defensive scheme , and it is only natural that there was some confusion . That is the charitable analysis . It is less charitable to point_out that some U.S. defenders not only were a step behind in their movements against Bayern Munich but also in their thinking . And they did not appear to be thinking at all when Scholl dribbled unimpeded down the middle of the field to score the winning goal in the 60th minute . No one was more astonished than U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel , who was left in the unenviable position of having to face Scholl one on one . All three Bayern Munich goals resulted from errors in front of Friedel , which he no doubt hopes the coaches will note as they try to decide whether he or Tony Meola will be the starting goalkeeper . Because of Klopas ' streak , the coaches also will be faced with an unexpected difficult decision concerning the starting striker . Until recently , it was assumed that the job belonged_to Stewart . &quot; The bottom_line is that it ' s the striker ' s job to score goals , &quot; U.S. assistant Steve Sampson said . &quot; Anyone with a history of scoring goals , especially a recent history , has got_to be a strong contender to be in the first 11 . Klopas is quickly making a name for himself. &quot;</TEXT>
