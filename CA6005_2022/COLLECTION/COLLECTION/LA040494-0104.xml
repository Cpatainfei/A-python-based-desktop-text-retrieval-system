   <HEADLINE> QUARTERLY STOCK MUTUAL FUND REVIEW ; ERODING SHARE PRICES SET BOND INVESTORS AQUIVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mutual_fund industry ' s greatest concern right now isn ' t whether some small percentage of stock fund investors will decide to cash out . The bigger worry is how millions of conservative investors in bond funds will react to the news that they ' re losing money , as surging market interest_rates devalue older bonds . Bond funds &quot; are where the real crisis is , &quot; says Eric Kobren , head of the Mutual Fund Investors Assn. , a fund newsletter publisher based in Wellesley Hills , Mass . In the first_quarter , the average stock fund fell 3.35 % , the largest quarterly loss since the third quarter of 1990 . But in theory , anyway , most stock investors understand that they ' re taking a risk of loss in the market . The same may_not be true for bond fund investors . Many of them bought_into high-yielding bond funds in recent years simply as substitutes for low-yielding bank certificates_of_deposit . Substitution was fine as long as market interest_rates were falling , which they did from 1990 through most of last year . Bond fund investors earned their high yields , and their principal ( the money originally invested ) also increased because older , higher-yielding bonds appreciated in value . But now market interest_rates are rising rapidly , as the economy expands and investors fear higher inflation . The result is that bond mutual_fund share prices are sliding , eroding investors ' principal -- and their willingness to stick_with the funds . Michael Lipper of fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York says preliminary figures show that the average bond fund had a &quot; negative total return &quot; of 2.53 % in the first_quarter . That means that despite the interest earned on its bonds during the quarter , the average fund ' s share price fell enough to effectively wipe_out the interest earnings , and then some . The damage was much worse for some types of funds , as the accompanying chart shows . The Dreyfus General Municipal_bond fund was off 6.2 % for the quarter ; the Vanguard Long-Term Treasury fund dove 5.6 % . Many bond funds are showing their largest losses in seven years . Naturally , funds that own bonds maturing farthest in the future have been slammed hardest , because longer-term fixed-rate bonds depreciate most rapidly when market rates begin to rise . That makes_sense , if you think_about it : The longer a bond ' s term , the greater investors ' fear of being stuck_with its fixed yield while higher-yielding opportunities become available in the interim . So potential buyers are dropping the prices they ' re willing to pay_for bonds , depreciating the market across the board . Should most bond investors care if their underlying principal is eroding ? If they ' re investing solely for current income , they may_not . They ' re still getting paid their interest -- anywhere from 4 % to 8 % annualized , depending_on the type of fund -- even if it ' s being used to buy more shares ( i.e. , it ' s being &quot; reinvested &quot; ) . Also , if the bond market is overreacting to the economy ' s strength , market interest_rates could soon begin to fall_back , which means bond fund share prices would appreciate again , though not necessarily back to their peak levels of 1993 . Lipper believes that conservative , risk-adverse older individuals who are solely invested in long-term bond funds ought to instead build a &quot; laddered &quot; portfolio : Sell one-half to three-quarters of your long-term fund , even if it means taking a loss , and reinvest half the proceeds in a short-term bond and half in an intermediate-term fund . Though short-term interest_rates have been rising with long rates , shorter-term bonds don ' t depreciate anywhere near as fast as long-term bonds in this kind of environment . You ' ll earn a lower yield on shorter-term bonds , but your principal will be more stable . For example , Vanguard Group ' s long-term municipal_bond fund has suffered a loss ( negative total return ) of 6 % this year . But the firm ' s short-term muni fund is down just 0.1 % . The long-term muni fund currently yields 5.5 % , while the short-term muni fund yields 3.2 % . By blending a portfolio of short- , intermediate- and long-term bond funds you can earn a mid-range yield while protecting against deep principal losses . Some experts , however , believe that truly conservative investors who can ' t stand to lose any principal ought to just admit they were wrong to buy a bond fund , sell it , and go_back to a bank CD . &quot; If you really don ' t belong in it , get_out , &quot; Kobren advises . The mental agony such bond owners now face is &quot; just not worth it , &quot; he says . The Times will present a detailed report on first-quarter bond fund performance on Thursday .
