   <HEADLINE> THE PULL OF MAGNETS ; EDUCATION : POOR TEST SCORES AND THE LOSS OF TOP STUDENTS PROMPT A FLURRY OF APPLICATIONS BY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOLS TO JOIN SPECIAL PROGRAMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Motivated by falling test scores and the loss of high-achieving students , 18 schools -- three times the number that typically apply -- want to become part of the highly prized magnet system in the L.A. Unified School District . The schools hope to offer specialized courses ranging from Latin music to journalism and media technology . Magnets -- considered the gems of the school_system -- offer smaller classes , more money for special activities and facilities and a handpicked faculty . Students must apply for entrance and the competition is stiff . Application brochures are available beginning today at all schools and Los Angeles public_libraries . But while the pull of the magnets is strong , lack of funds could prevent many schools from achieving their goals . The smaller classes and enrichment activities cost more money . Because the students and teachers choose magnets -- and are not just assigned to them -- principals of schools that have applied for that status say magnets have lower absenteeism , higher staff morale , more involved parents , higher test scores . &quot; Our test scores are going_down , down , down , &quot; said Jan Walsh , the principal at Gledhill Elementary in North Hills . &quot; We feel something is needed . We have to find something to turn these kids around . We ' re in a desperate situation. &quot; The magnets also could attract students who plan to leave regular schools . Across the district , principals say they lose some of their high-achieving students to magnets . About 38 # 000 students apply to magnets every year for about 9 # 500 openings . &quot; I lose many good kids , &quot; said Marilyn Erickson , the principal at Haskell Elementary in Granada Hills , which wants to specialize in math , science and technology . &quot; It would be a way of keeping kids at my school and provide a program for parents who want magnet schools for their children. &quot; At Millikan Middle_School in Sherman Oaks , which is proposing to offer performing arts courses , Principal Pete Ferry said the campus could tap parents who work in the entertainment_industry for support . Students at the school already are excited about the prospect . &quot; One boy told me he has to check with his agent to see if he could do these kinds of things for free , &quot; Ferry said . &quot; But there ' s a lot of interest. &quot; Millikan also loses students to magnets and other campuses , Ferry said . The magnet center could attract students to the campus . &quot; We ' re trying to plug up the drain , &quot; Ferry said . * But whatever their intentions , the principals have a tough hurdle ahead . The Board_of_Education must approve their requests , and limited funding could be the death blow for schools ' plans . The board probably will consider the applications in the next few weeks . Board_member Julie Korenstein , whose daughter attended magnets , said the problem is strictly financial . &quot; I wish I could make every school a magnet , &quot; Korenstein said . &quot; It ' s going_to be a tough choice with the limited amount of funding we have. &quot; Korenstein represents the board district with the most magnet students -- 8 # 086 . She also has the most students on the district ' s waiting list -- 6 # 367 . The district expects to receive about 38 # 000 applications for the 108 magnets next year . &quot; Wherever they are and whatever they specialize in , students are doing better , &quot; Korenstein said . The district receives about 80 % of the magnet funding from the state . A one-time , $ 10-million federal grant is paying in part for the math and science magnets . That grant could be another reason for the increased number of schools applying to be magnets . &quot; When there ' s money and the word goes_out , applications start coming_in , &quot; said school_board President Leticia Quezada . &quot; My preference is to establish the spirit and the environment in all our schools . &quot; The greatest benefit will be when all our schools become much more like our magnets , &quot; Quezada said . Created during the divisive busing battles in the late 1970s , magnets are intended to provide students from throughout the sprawling district with smaller , integrated and more specialized educational_programs . Many principals believe the change will benefit parents who are seeking a better education for their children . &quot; Magnets carry an aura of superior programs and instruction , &quot; said Merle Price , principal of Palisades High_School in Pacific Palisades . &quot; With all_the recent concern about the quality of public education , I think there ' s a built-in constituency. &quot; Added Anna McLinn , principal of Marvin Avenue Elementary in West Los Angeles : &quot; I think it ' s a last chance for our district . To me , it ' s the answer to low test scores. &quot; District officials caution schools that becoming a magnet takes commitment and the desire on the part of the staff to make the change . &quot; You can ' t just pin a label on the school door , &quot; said Richard Battaglia , who oversees the district ' s magnet program . &quot; Doing a good job in a magnet takes work. &quot; Aside from students , teachers also select magnets . Principals interview and hire teachers who are interested in their specific programs . At Granada Hills High , which opened a magnet last year , 60 teachers applied for seven openings . After a month ' s delay , the magnet brochure and application -- called &quot; Choices &quot; -- is available , and the deadline is April 15 . Students currently enrolled in magnets are given priority along with siblings of magnet students and those whose names already are_on the waiting list . If any new magnets are approved , a supplemental application and brochure will be printed , officials said .</TEXT>
