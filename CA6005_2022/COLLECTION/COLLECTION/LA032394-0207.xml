   <HEADLINE> ASIA TIRES OF BEING THE TOXIC WASTE DUMPING GROUND FOR REST OF WORLD ; ENVIRONMENT : A GLOBAL CONFERENCE IN GENEVA COULD END MANY RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN DEVELOPING NATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a large factory on the rutted outskirts of Manila every day , huge containers disgorge an unusual cargo -- thousands of dead car_batteries from such places as Australia , Europe and the Middle_East . With the politically correct-sounding name of Philippine Recyclers Inc. , the factory was established in the early 1980s with tax incentives from the government to reprocess the world ' s discarded auto batteries by reclaiming the lead inside and using it to make new batteries . The company has been a big success by the standards of the economically depressed Philippines , employing 280 people to recycle 24 # 000 tons of car_batteries every year . In 1993 , sales hit a respectable $ 11 million . Hundreds of similar companies have mushroomed across Asia in recent years as Western companies facing costly and environmentally sensitive waste-disposal problems at_home have opted to ship much of their toxic trash overseas for reprocessing . By one estimate , more_than 100 tons of plastic , which many countries regard_as toxic when burned , leaves the Port of Los Angeles every day for recycling plants in Asia . With cheap labor , economies desperate for investment and little or no regulation , countries from China to Indonesia to Pakistan scramble to compete for the waste business . But an international conference taking_place in Geneva this week could dramatically change the way the world disposes of its hazardous wastes and spell the end of companies like Philippine Recyclers . Even the term recycling , the mantra of &quot; green &quot; movements for the past two decades , is suddenly becoming a dirty word . &quot; The bottom_line is , we don ' t want to become the garbage_dump of the world , &quot; said Philippine Sen . Orlando S . Mercado , a leader on environmental issues . &quot; A lot of the industries , the recycling industries that are being exported to developing countries , are dirty industries . We have enough garbage of our own. &quot; The Geneva meeting is designed as a follow-up to the 1989 adoption of the so-called Basel convention on international shipments of hazardous wastes , which was enacted under the auspices of the U.N. Environment Program following scandalous revelations about rich countries dumping toxic_wastes in the territories of poor nations . In one famous incident , an Italian company rented a farm in Nigeria for $ 100 and used it to dump 4 # 000 tons of hazardous polyvinyl_chloride wastes , or PVCs . The Basel convention banned shipments of a long list of toxic_wastes , but in the view of environmentalists it left two gaping loopholes . One is that shipments can still take_place if the governments involved agree , and the second , more important exception concerns material that could be recycled . Last month , Denmark suggested a dramatic tightening of the law , banning outright exports of hazardous wastes from the world ' s richest countries to all developing countries . While Italy , Spain and 77 developing countries expressed support for the ban , some of the world ' s leading industrial powers , including Britain , France and Australia , announced their opposition . That set the stage for the confrontation this week . &quot; It seems to our government that it is one of the worst forms of imperialism for us to want to keep a way_of_life in rich countries by getting_rid_of our waste by sending it to people who have no way of defending themselves , &quot; said Thomas Becker , an official with Denmark ' s Environment Ministry . The answer , Becker said , is for the rich countries to process the waste themselves or eliminate it . Significantly , the United States will not have a voice in the debate because the George_Bush Administration never sought ratification of the original Basel convention . So U.S. officials are attending the Geneva meeting as observers only . Earlier this month , the Clinton_Administration announced that it will introduce legislation banning exports of hazardous wastes , bringing U.S. regulations in_line with the Basel convention . But the proposal exempts what are termed &quot; safe recyclable &quot; exports , such_as plastics . &quot; The U.S. exports only a fraction of a percent of our hazardous waste , &quot; said Carol Browner , the Environmental Protection Agency chief . &quot; But that fraction adds_up to a significant amount . The current policy puts people in other countries at risk of dangerous exposures to toxic materials . That has to stop. &quot; Sen . John Kerry ( D-Mass. ) , who heads an environmental group called Globe USA , said that it is important for the United States to set an example to the rest of the world by adopting strict limits on toxic exports . &quot; If the convention is to be enforced , the least we can do is follow the regulations ourselves , &quot; Kerry said . One of the worst examples of the United States exporting hazardous materials occurred in 1992 , when a U.S. firm sold Bangladesh 6 # 300 tons of fertilizer that contained toxic lead and cadmium wastes from copper smelting . A U.S. court fined the company that provided the waste $ 1 million , but the damage was already done -- more_than 3 # 400 tons had been spread on farms and could not be removed . Asia has become the focus of the hazardous-waste debate because many other developing countries , notably in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific Islands , have banned imports of toxic materials . Nigeria and Cameroon have even imposed the death_penalty for toxic-waste importers . China , Taiwan and India are big importers of metals for recycling , while the Philippines , Indonesia and Thailand reprocess everything from batteries to scrap paper and plastics . One U.S. company has proposed to pay the tiny Pacific island of Tonga $ 9 million annually to establish a toxic-waste dump on a volcanic atoll , and an Oakland firm wants to ship trash as landfill to the low-lying Marshall Islands . Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos , among Asia ' s poorest and least regulated countries , have received offers from a number of Western corporations about opening waste-treatment facilities . According to the environmental group Greenpeace , between 1990 and 1993 , five nations -- the United States , Canada , Germany , Britain and Australia -- shipped 5.4 million tons of toxic_wastes to Asian_countries . A resolution this month in the Philippines ' House of Representatives on the toxic-waste issue estimated imports at 15 million pounds in 1991 and 5 million pounds in the first_quarter of 1992 . They were mainly plastics , scrap metal , computer junk and lead scrap . The Philippines illustrates the often contradictory attitudes of Asian governments toward toxic_wastes . While the Board of Investment has given millions of dollars in tax incentives to companies to set_up recycling businesses , the Department of the Environment and Natural_Resources has sent a high official to Geneva to campaign for a worldwide ban on shipments of toxic_wastes for recycling . Jacob Tagorda , president of Philippine Recyclers , the country ' s leading battery recycler , said a ban on battery imports would be fatal to his company as well as two other lead reprocessors . Tagorda said his company uses technology imported from a firm in East Los Angeles and follows every applicable health and safety regulation . He acknowledged that blood_tests have shown high levels of lead in some workers ' blood but said the workers are transferred to safer jobs until the levels return to normal . Anne Leonard , a toxic-waste specialist for Greenpeace , said that tests of workers and agricultural land near lead reprocessors , not only in the Philippines but in Indonesia and Thailand , have indicated serious health concerns created by the industries , from lead levels in topsoil to pollution of drinking_water . Similarly , Leonard said that the process of recycling plastics often releases hazardous gases and exposes workers in developing countries , who are too poor to afford protective clothing , to contamination from the chemicals contained in the plastics , such_as pesticides and solvents . Another industry that has been dramatically affected by the recent debate on recycling is the world trade_in &quot; technojunk &quot; -- computers and related devices that have been overtaken by new technology and discarded . After Greenpeace campaigners raided a Russian ship near Manila earlier this month , the Philippine government impounded two containers of computer junk sent to an Australian-owned company that separates the valuable pieces for resale . Randell Carman , chairman of the recycling company , said he was astonished at the government ' s action because the firm had been operating with government approval for eight years . Carman said cheap labor in the Philippines made the business economically more practical than it would be in Australia , but he insisted that the work was purely mechanical and not harmful to either the workers or the environment . Nonetheless , Raquel Vasquez , director of the government ' s Environmental Management Bureau , declared the shipment toxic because it contained unacceptably high levels of the element cadmium and ordered the seized goods , which had grown to four containers by the time a decision was reached , returned to Australia . &quot; The Philippines has learned to live_by getting its basic commodities from recycling , and they are very good at it , &quot; Carman said . &quot; Our business is basically finished without the imports. &quot;</TEXT>
