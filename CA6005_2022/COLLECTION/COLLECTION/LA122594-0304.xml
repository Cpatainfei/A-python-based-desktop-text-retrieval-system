   <HEADLINE> 1994 : YEAR IN REVIEW ; ROCK TURNS A VERY YOUNG 40 ; THANKS TO A NEW GENERATION OF MUSICAL REVOLUTIONARIES , FIVE ALBUMS QUALIFY AS THE YEAR ' S FINEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Who would have imagined that rock ' n ' roll would be so vital and inspiring at 40 ? Despite evidence as recently as 1990 that the music had once again lost its relevance , a new generation of musicians has stepped_forward with purpose and direction -- just as the Beatles and Bob Dylan did_in the ' 60s , Bruce Springsteen and the Sex Pistols in the ' 70s , R.E.M. and U2 in the ' 80s . This latest rescue unit is drawn chiefly from artists whose music expresses the anger and alienation of growing_up amid broken homes , hostile surroundings and meaningless job expectations . It ' s a rock revolution so deeply rooted that it has given us an abundance of riches in 1994 . Some years it is difficult to find one album that lives_up_to the ambition and craft suggested by the term album of the year . This year , there are five : * ( 1 ) Hole , &quot; Live Through This &quot; ( DGC Records ) . The cover photo of a beauty queen at the moment of victory is the ideal introduction to Hole ' s major-label debut . In a more innocent age , being elected queen was seen by young_girls as one of life ' s ultimate joys -- right up there with meeting Mr. Perfect and raising those beautiful kids . In the best of these songs , singer-songwriter Courtney Love slashes with the force of a machete at the idea of guaranteed happiness . She expresses disappointment and disillusionment in songs so naked and raw that you expect the photo on the album ' s back cover to show the queen ' s dead flowers . &quot; Someday , &quot; she warns , &quot; you will ache like I ache. &quot; Instead , the photo shows a young , barefooted Love , back when all her childhood dreams were intact . What gives Hole ' s music its power is that Love -- despite her loudmouth , confrontational persona -- still clings_to fairy tales and the hope that life can be transformed magically by romance or , heaven forbid , rock ' n ' roll . The strength of &quot; Live Through This , &quot; with its tales of obsession and betrayal , lies_in the tension between what Love wants to believe and the stark reality of_her_own experience . * ( 2 ) Nine Inch Nails , &quot; The Downward Spiral &quot; ( Nothing / TVT / Interscope ) . Trent Reznor may be the most gifted blend of singer , writer and producer since Prince . His tenacious guitar- and synthesizer-driven music is not as overtly confessional as Love ' s but it explores today ' s youthful Angst with breathtaking dynamics and craft . Prone to dark , desperate themes and frequently shocking language , Reznor misses no opportunity to startle or jolt -- in the tradition of the horror movies he loved as a kid . Yet &quot; The Downward Spiral &quot; isn ' t a celebration of nihilism . Rather , the songs chronicle the moments of self-destruction and rage in an age in which nothing , from family to religion , seems to offer hope of comfort or salvation for millions of young people . In a career year , Reznor also was the star of Woodstock ' 94 . * ( 3 ) Pearl Jam , &quot; Vitalogy &quot; ( Epic ) . The most difficult thing in rock is stepping_up to greatness after you ' ve already been declared a superstar , which is why Pearl Jam ' s rise to creative excellence after two commercial blockbusters stands as one of the most remarkable feats of ' 90s rock . Where it was once predictable and stiff , Pearl Jam ' s music now seduces and assaults you in unexpected and frequently spectacular ways . Eddie Vedder too has improved dramatically as a writer , able now to reflect upon the world around him -- from relationships to rock ' n ' roll pressures -- with the mastery and heart of_his_own hero , Pete Townshend . * ( 4 ) Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse , &quot; Sleeps With Angels &quot; ( Reprise ) . Young , who began making records long before most of this new crop of rockers entered grade_school , also focuses_on today ' s troubled youth . The result is an album as tender and soul-baring as anything Young has done since 1975 ' s &quot; Tonight ' s the Night , &quot; which was written after the drug-related deaths of two friends . This album also refers to a pair of deaths : the drive-by_shooting of a young victim and the suicide of Kurt Cobain . The message is one of renewed optimism and hope . * ( 5 ) R.E.M. , &quot; Monster &quot; ( Warner Bros. ) . Following the mostly muted , melancholy textures of &quot; Out of Time &quot; and &quot; Automatic for the People , &quot; R.E.M. takes a sharp turn_into the world of feisty rock ' n ' roll , and it ' s a pleasure ride indeed : a virtual jigsaw_puzzle that invites the listener to unscramble the themes and identify the teasing musical influences . Most of the themes deal with romantic obsession , and the influences range from the Beatles and grunge to R.E.M. itself . * ( 6 ) Liz Phair , &quot; Whip-Smart &quot; ( Matador / Atlantic ) . Even those who admired Phair ' s debut collection last year had to wonder just how much her appeal depended_on the titillation factor . While not above resorting again briefly to sexual imagery that might make her mom blush , Phair proves that her strongest weapons in these tales of sexual politics and desire are her wry intelligence and writing skills . A major arrival . * ( 7 ) Soundgarden , &quot; Superunknown &quot; ( A &amp; M ) . Like Pearl Jam , this is a band that has grown creatively while under the spotlight . The sound still seems a bit too close at times to the Led Zeppelin-Black Sabbath power-driven tradition , but the questioning , independent spirit updates nicely the honesty and punch of the Minutemen , Husker Du and other trailblazing underground rock_bands of the early ' 80s . * ( 8 ) Beck , &quot; Mellow Gold &quot; ( DGC ) . &quot; Loser &quot; is the song that made this young hip-hop-folkie-rocker-whatever a star , but other tracks on this wonderfully eclectic debut , including the Dylanesque sarcasm of &quot; Pay No Mind , &quot; could have done the trick if college radio programmers had picked_up on them instead . It ' s too early to tell where this 24-year-old ' s bootheels are going_to wander , but he ' s worth following . * ( 9 ) Dionne Farris , &quot; Wild Seed -- Wild_Flower &quot; ( Columbia ) . To the rest of the pop world , Farris , the only non-rock entry on this year ' s list , took a big chance when she left Arrested Development , where she had contributed soulful vocal coloring on the much-admired &quot; Tennessee. &quot; But Farris knew one thing we didn ' t until now : She ' s a richly talented singer and writer with an adventurous musical vision that stretches from commentary to caress , from the Beatles to Curtis Mayfield . * ( 10 ) Various artists , &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; soundtrack ( Nothing / Interscope ) . Don ' t judge a soundtrack by its movie . Oliver Stone ' s film about murderers as ' 90s superstars was maddeningly overwrought , but this collection , produced by Trent Reznor , takes us on an exhilarating roller-coaster ride through these violent , unsettling times as it mixes music ( from Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan to Patti Smith and L7 ) and dialogue . A classic . More Top 10 Picks * For all 17 of the Top 10 lists of Calendar ' s pop contributors , check the new TimesLink on-line service .
