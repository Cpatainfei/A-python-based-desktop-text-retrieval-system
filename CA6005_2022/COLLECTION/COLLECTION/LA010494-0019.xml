   <HEADLINE> REAGANOMICS-IN-THE-TROPICS FALTERS ; LATIN_AMERICA : VOTERS ARE REJECTING ECONOMIC SHOCK_TREATMENTS AND RIGID TWO-PARTY DIVISIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has been a long_time coming , but a Latin_American electorate has finally rejected the Reaganomics-in-the-Tropics scheme of economic and social_policy that has reigned supreme across the hemisphere since the late 1980s . In Venezuela , the region ' s oldest standing two-party system provided voters with a substantive choice on Dec . 5 : more of the same policies that had been implemented by President Carlos Andres Perez before he was impeached , such_as trade liberalization , privatizations , wage_freezes , subsidy cuts and higher prices for public goods and services , or a rejection of those options in favor of a so-called adjustment with a human_face and a social conscience . Venezuelans decisively chose the latter approach . In Peru in 1990 , voters thought they were rejecting the option of an economic shock_treatment , as proposed by writer Mario Vargas Llosa . In fact , that ' s what they got , in spades , through the ideological about-face of Vargas Llosa ' s rival , Alberto Fujimori . In Argentina , last October ' s congressional vote was an endorsement of President Carlos Menem ' s policies , although the voters may have been swayed by false premises . And in Chile , on Dec . 12 , voters overwhelmingly elected Eduardo Frei to the presidency , but as head of a coalition in which everyone could find something to like : Some thought they were voting for a partial continuation of the radical free-market policies of the Pinochet years ; others expected repayment of the &quot; social debt , &quot; a keystone of the outgoing Christian Democratic administration of Patricio Aylwin . But in Venezuela , the electorate expressed itself clearly and knowingly by giving 28 % of the vote to old-timer Rafael Caldera , who won the presidency , and 27 % to center-leftist Andres Velazquez . Both ran against neo-liberalism ' s radical free-market policies . For the first time , the fashionable and supposedly inevitable trend was voted_down , the supposedly archaic and not viable was voted_in . Matters are , of course , more complicated than this brief assessment suggests . To begin with , the corruption and discredit of Perez explains much of his party ' s debacle . The entire political elite has been tainted by scandal , largely because the two-party system in Venezuela is more a formalistic facade than a forum for exercising apposite ideological tensions . As Terry Karl , one scholar of the country ' s 1959-60 transition from dictatorship , put it , &quot; Regardless of who won the elections , each party was promised participation in the political and economic pie. &quot; The two military coup attempts of 1992 were largely directed against this cozy arrangement . Either the pie had to be split differently , or those gorging on it would have to go . Indeed , the sea change symbolized by the Venezuelan elections may consist_in the end of these types of political_systems , where ideological , social , ethnic and even regional cleavages are wished away or ignored . Complex , urban , literate and ideologically diverse societies without long-standing party loyalties or traditions cannot fit into neat , simple categories -- Liberals or Conservatives in Colombia , Peronists or radicals in Argentina and their traditional equivalents in Venezuela , Costa Rica and Uruguay , among others . Splintered electorates , atomized parties and the broad coalitions needed to stitch them together should be the norm in incipient democracies like Latin_America ' s . Only then can the true colors and quirks of deeply divided nations be identified and addressed . And only when the economic_policies applauded in Washington for others ( but becoming discarded for Americans ) actually deliver the goods_will they receive the type of support that democracy requires . Growth is flattening_out in the more recently successful Latin_American economies -- Chile , Argentina ; it has simply vanished in others , like Mexico and Venezuela . Income inequality , for example , has become worse in Mexico , despite poverty alleviation programs . 1994 will see a rash of presidential elections in Latin_America , ranging from tiny El_Salvador to Brazil and Mexico , from Colombia to Costa Rica . In each one , a pair of issues seem to be dividing the electorate : continuity vs . change , neo-liberal adjustment vs . something ill-defined but strongly embraced : growth , justice , jobs , dignity . Voting for all_of the above is no guarantee of achieving any of these aims . But there is every reason to believe that more and more Latin_Americans over the next 12 months will follow the Venezuelan path , wherever it actually may lead .</TEXT>
