   <HEADLINE> THRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE ; RELATIONSHIPS : MANY COHABITATING ORANGE COUNTY COUPLES JUST AREN ' T INTERESTED IN A WEDDING AND REMAIN HAPPILY UNMARRIED , DESPITE FAMILY PRESSURES AND TAX DISADVANTAGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Eric and Tricia are spending time with friends , it ' s not uncommon for someone to call them &quot; Mr. and Mrs. &quot; or for Tricia to be asked what ' s new with her &quot; husband. &quot; Comments like that are laughed_off ; everyone in their circle knows that Tricia O ' Toole , 25 , and Eric Moe , 33 , are unmarried although they have lived together almost two years . But to the group , they &quot; seem &quot; married . &quot; Our friends sometimes say we forgot to get_married , &quot; says Moe . &quot; The fact that we ' re living_together without a marriage_license just isn ' t an issue. &quot; Renting a small house on Balboa Island , which is easier to do with two incomes than one , was a prime reason they decided to live together . They ' re comfortable planning a future that may include marriage one day , but it ' s a day that gets referred to most often when they ' re around their families . &quot; People are always asking about our plans , especially since my sister is getting_married , &quot; says O ' Toole . &quot; But we ' re going to let her have her year ; we don ' t feel_like planning a wedding right now. &quot; The statistics show that more couples like O ' Toole and Moe are cohabitating than ever before in America . The Census_Bureau reports that in 1970 , about 523 # 000 unmarried couples lived together . In 1992 , the number jumped to 3.3 million . While some states recognize a common-law_marriage for couples who live together seven years or more , California has no such statute . Cohab couples who want the protection the state gives married people have to buy the license and do the vows . &quot; Not being married frees you from some entanglements , but it can hurt you in other areas , &quot; says family law attorney Carlos Cuesta of Fullerton . &quot; Tax law favors married_couples , as do insurance_companies when you ' re shopping for life and health insurance. &quot; &quot; It ' s very rare for a couple to come_to me who haven ' t lived together before getting_married , &quot; says Judy Albert , a marriage , family and child counselor in Huntington Beach . &quot; I never ask , ' How long have you been married ? ' I say , ' How long have you been together ? ' &quot; Most of the cohabitating couples Albert sees are open about their lifestyle . Whether their reason for cohabitating is economic , or if they just aren ' t comfortable with the formalities of the marriage bonds , the growing number of cohabitants may be a sign that living together is no longer something to hide . When Cheryl Bowman and Rich Neary of Sunset Beach found their first apartment together , they wore bogus wedding_bands . &quot; It was 1973 , and I think landlords felt that if you were cohabitating , you were probably into drugs and porno and who knows what else , &quot; says Bowman . &quot; We just weren ' t into the whole wedding thing ; we wanted to be ' together ' rather than ' married , ' and we still feel that way. &quot; &quot; For the first few years , I think we both thought we ' d get_married in the future . Now the future is here and we still haven ' t done_it , &quot; says Neary . &quot; I think living together lets us feel_like we ' re still in our 20s . Being married means being an adult , ( and ) we still want to experience childhood. &quot; Bowman and Neary , both 46 , believe that cohabitation is more acceptable than ever and that few couples have to shield the truth about their home lives like they once did . &quot; I ' ve always been a grade_school teacher , and a teacher ' s off-campus image is important , &quot; says Neary . &quot; It was only about five years ago that I told my administrator that Cheryl wasn ' t my wife . I did this after realizing that most of the parents I deal with are either living with someone now or they have in the past. &quot; Friends and family have &quot; given_up &quot; in Bowman ' s words , any hope of the couple marrying , but both feel some family pressure . &quot; We ' re treated like any other married_couple at family gatherings , but there ' s often an edge . When we tell people we ' re planning a trip to Reno , they always ask if we ' re going to visit one of the little chapels. &quot; While Bowman says her mother now loves Neary like a son , it wasn ' t always that way . &quot; She was hurt that I had decided to live with a man I wasn ' t married to , and ( my mother and I ) had a very tense relationship the first couple of years , which was difficult because we had always gotten_along so well. &quot; &quot; I ' ve seen parents become a little more accepting of children who live with someone before marriage , &quot; says Albert . &quot; Because of the trauma of divorce , they feel that a trial without the legal constraints of marriage might be good for a couple . It may go_against their feelings of morality , but they want what ' s best for their children. &quot; * Family pressure to marry , whether it ' s good natured or harsh , can put an undue strain on a cohab couple . &quot; When faced with that kind of resistance from a parent or other family member , people often feel they need to change that person ' s opinion , &quot; says Jackie Singer , a marriage , family and child counselor in Irvine . &quot; But you have to try not to do this . &quot; You can say , ' I know this must be hard for you , but you need to let me live my own life. ' It ' s important to remember that while you may_not understand their position , they ' re having a hard_time understanding yours . The other person is just as upset as you are. &quot; For Moe , his sister ' s decision to live with her boyfriend a year earlier helped him . &quot; She kind of ' broke the ice ' by being the first in our family , which made_it easier when I told them that Tricia and I were going_to live together. &quot; &quot; Eric stayed_at my parents ' house for a short time after college , &quot; says O ' Toole . &quot; From that experience everyone got_to know him and he became like a part of the family . When we told everyone that we would be living together , the fact that he ' d been around made_it easier. &quot; Bruce Eden , 38 , was a bachelor who had lived alone since leaving college . But in December of 1992 , he moved_into the home of girlfriend Wendy Carter , 36 , of Anaheim , and her 5-year-old son , Andrew . &quot; For years I never did much during the holidays , and suddenly I ' m putting_up a Christmas_tree and setting cookies and milk out for Santa on Christmas_Eve . It was an amazing transformation for me , &quot; says Eden . &quot; Having Bruce move_in has been great ; he and Andrew get_along and my ex-husband likes him and he appreciates having a man around the house with Andrew , &quot; says Carter . &quot; But I ' ve had some strange reactions from other people . Some friends were outraged , saying I was a bad influence on my son by having Bruce come_to live with us . They don ' t trust my judgment ; Bruce and I had been close a year before he had moved_in and they liked him fine before then . They act_as though I were living with a guy I met two weeks ago. &quot; Carter ' s parents in Arizona were a little uncomfortable when she told them about her new living_arrangement . &quot; They wanted to meet Bruce , and when they did they liked him and approved , although I ' m sure they ' ll be thrilled when we actually get married. &quot; When Carter and Eden planned to spend a weekend at her parent ' s home last summer , they faced a typical problem for cohabitating couples who visit their parents : Where do we sleep ? &quot; My parents have two extra bedrooms . One has two twin_beds , the other has a double_bed . I wasn ' t going_to quibble about the sleeping arrangements . If they wanted us to have the twin_beds , and Andrew to have the double , that was fine , &quot; Carter said . As it turned_out , Carter ' s mother showed her to the double_bed , and Andrew and Eden to the twin_beds down the hall . &quot; This is what they were comfortable with ; it ' s their house , and we were comfortable with that. &quot; &quot; That sense of ' you do what you want in your home , but not in my home ' still prevails , &quot; says Singer . &quot; Even if the parents accept the couple living together , there ' s often something about sleeping_with that person in the parent ' s house that causes discomfort . They feel it ' s a violation. &quot; When Bowman and Neary visited his parents for the first time , she slept_in the spare bedroom while he got the couch . &quot; The next time , we did the adult thing , &quot; says Neary . &quot; We bought them a queen-size bed and had it delivered the day before we arrived , assuming we ' d get_to use it . But they had it put_in their room , tossed the old bed out , and I was_on the couch again . Now we just stay_at a hotel. &quot;</TEXT>
