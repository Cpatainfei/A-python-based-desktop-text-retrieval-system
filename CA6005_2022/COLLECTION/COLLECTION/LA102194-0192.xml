   <HEADLINE> GM ' S STOCK DIVES ON ANEMIC EARNINGS ; AUTOS : THE NO . 1 CAR_MAKER SUFFERS ANOTHER HUGE LOSS IN ITS NORTH_AMERICAN OPERATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> General Motors Corp . reported improved but surprisingly weak earnings Thursday as it suffered another big loss in North_American auto operations despite the most robust U.S. vehicle market in years . In the three months ended Sept . 30 , the nation ' s No . 1 auto_maker earned $ 552 million , or 40 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 113 million , or 49 cents a share , in the year-earlier period . The earnings were boosted by a one-time , $ 200-million tax_credit . In its key North_American operations , GM lost $ 328 million , compared to a loss of $ 825 million a year ago , not including special items . However , the company , which has lost $ 17 billion in North_America since 1990 , is still likely to be profitable domestically for the full year . GM blamed the weak North_American results on slow launches of new vehicles , production limitations and two strikes . The operating results were_well below Wall_Street expectations and GM shares plunged as low as $ 42.375 on the earnings news , but they recovered somewhat to close at $ 43.125 , down $ 3.75 for the day . It was the most heavily traded issue on the New York Stock_Exchange on Thursday . &quot; The Street reacted so negatively because of what this says about GM ' s long-term profitability , &quot; said David Garrity , analyst with Smith Barney Shearson in New York . Investors are concerned that GM lost money on its core auto business even while U.S. car and truck sales were booming . Only the tax_credit and good performance of GM ' s non-auto units allowed it to report a profit . GM officials blame the deficit in North_America on increased overtime to meet buyer demand , higher product development costs and strike-related production losses . &quot; We ' re not very happy with the third-quarter results , &quot; said Michael Losh , chief financial_officer . GM ' s performance pales in comparison to its competitors and comes amid the strongest car and truck market since 1988 . Chrysler Corp . reported earnings of $ 651 million in the third quarter and Ford Motor Co . is expected to report earnings of about $ 900 million next week . In the third quarter , GM lost an average of $ 296 on every vehicle it sold in North_America . In comparison , Chrysler made about $ 1 # 000 per vehicle in the period . In addition to slow production start-ups and excessive overtime , GM was hurt by two strikes that closed numerous assembly_plants and cut production by about 40 # 000 vehicles . The strikes translate to about $ 150 million in lost profits , Losh said . Separately , the firm ' s GM Hughes Electronics Corp . subsidiary reported third-quarter earnings of $ 244 million , a 9 % gain , on a fractional rise in revenue to $ 3.4 billion . Operating profit jumped 29 % .</TEXT>
