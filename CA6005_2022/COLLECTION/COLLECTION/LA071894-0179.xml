   <HEADLINE> PEELING RUBBER IN JAPAN ; SALES OF U.S. CARS ACCELERATE BECAUSE OF WEAKER DOLLAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Toshiaki Yamamoto and his wife dropped_by their neighborhood Ford dealer after a recent Sunday morning of golf , they were impressed with what they saw . &quot; Before , I wasn ' t interested in American cars because they obviously were not fitted to Japanese road conditions , &quot; Yamamoto said . &quot; They were too big for Japanese narrow streets , and the steering_wheel was_on the other side . . . . What I ' m seeing is the ( steering_wheel ) is now on the right side of the car , and what I ' m especially interested in is their pricing and their safety features. &quot; Ford , Chrysler and General Motors have been gearing_up for two or three years to challenge the Japanese auto_makers on_their_own turf . Now , as the dollar hits post-World War II record lows against the yen , imports are increasingly price-competitive in Japan and those efforts are beginning to pay_off . While still a small percentage of the total market here , U.S. car sales this year are booming and seem headed for continued rapid_growth . The Big Three of Detroit expect to sell about 37 # 000 U.S.-made vehicles here this year , almost double the 19 # 630 sold last year . That represents about 0.6 % of the Japanese market , but the American presence is somewhat greater than the figures indicate because of sales of other cars American auto_makers build here and in Europe . Overall , imports of passenger_cars , including those made by Japanese firms in the United States and elsewhere , are up 30 % this year . In May , imports accounted_for a record 8.6 % of the market . The dollar ' s fall was a bit of luck for the U.S. makers . They have been able to take_advantage of it because of long-overdue design changes , the development of dealer networks here and , at least for Ford , more successful advertising . Shuko Mizuno , a 29-year-old Tokyo jewelry_store employee , last week bought a Chrysler Jeep Cherokee Limited . She said she intended to buy a smaller , moderately priced Japanese car , but the Cherokee was a bargain this year at the equivalent of $ 37 # 755 . Two years ago , a Jeep Cherokee cost $ 42 # 400 at the exchange_rate then . &quot; The price has come way down on the Cherokee , and I heard it ' s very sturdy , &quot; Mizuno said . &quot; It has power , too . If it ' s in an accident , it seems it would be relatively safe. &quot; Mizuno said she was also attracted to the Cherokee because it is kakko ii -- which translates roughly as &quot; neat &quot; or &quot; cool &quot; -- and because it will be good for going_to the mountains with friends for fly fishing . &quot; Compared to the past , people are using cars for leisure more , &quot; she said . &quot; Outdoor activities are fashionable now , and people are taking more vacations. &quot; Said Konen Suzuki , president of Ford Japan : &quot; Japanese consumers are not always looking_for the same car they have been using for many years . They are looking_for new things. &quot; Of America ' s Big Three , Ford is the one expanding most rapidly here . It aims to sell about 60 # 000 Ford brand cars here this year , including 12 # 600 imported from the United States . ( Ford also manufactures some of the models it sells here in Mazda factories. ) It plans to boost its sales in Japan to 200 # 000 units -- half will be imports -- by the end of the decade . General Motors President John F . Smith Jr . said here Friday that his firm aims to sell 100 # 000 cars annually in Japan by 2000 . &quot; We are very serious in Japan , &quot; he said . Although simplified customs procedures have lessened the once-daunting regulatory obstacles that had inhibited U.S. car sales , U.S. manufacturers still face great difficulties in Japan . Most Japanese dealers maintain strong relationships with a single Japanese manufacturer , so it is still difficult to get American cars into many showrooms across Japan . This too is starting to change , but slowly . The sky-high price of real_estate makes_it difficult for American companies to build their own dealership networks . Ford has marketed its cars here for more_than 20 years through the distributor Autorama Inc. , which has 288 dealerships and is jointly owned by Ford and Mazda . Ford also holds a 24.5 % stake in Mazda . In May , as part of an effort to raise Ford ' s profile , the &quot; Autorama &quot; signs came_down at these showrooms and new &quot; Ford &quot; signs went_up . That makes Ford the first U.S. firm to sell cars here through a dealer network bearing its own name . General Motors cars are sold at 200 outlets of the Yanase chain ; Chrysler vehicles are sold by Seibu Motor Sales Co . and through Honda . Ford achieved what was seen in the industry as a modest but important breakthrough in May , when Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales Co . converted one of its 53 outlets to serve as a Ford dealership under the name Ford Tohnichi . Chrysler ' s connection with Honda is a complex manufacturer-to-manufacturer relationship . The Ford hookup with Tokyo Nissan , by contrast , set an important precedent as the first time a U.S. manufacturer has made a sales contract with a dealer that has some independence but is also part of a Japanese keiretsu chain of related firms . Nissan Motor Co . owns 25 % of Tokyo Nissan . Deals such_as the Ford-Tokyo Nissan one are critical if U.S. car sales are to really take_off here . Finding ways to encourage other Japanese dealers to take similar steps is a goal of American negotiators in the U.S.-Japan trade talks . Tokyo Nissan ' s decision to devote an outlet to selling Fords was triggered by Japanese automobile executives ' desire to do something to ease the trade tensions , said Toshio Nakano , president of Ford Tohnichi . But the deal would not have been made unless his firm thought it could make money , he added . &quot; Ford Japan ' s President Suzuki said Ford will supply cars at reasonable prices , and they will put the ( steering_wheel ) on the right-hand side , and they will emphasize service and availability of parts , &quot; Nakano said . &quot; The market in Japan is close to saturation , and now customers are not only looking_for Nissans or Toyotas . The type of customers who want to enjoy car life is increasing . So we figured that if Ford makes enough effort , we can make a business out of it . that ' s why we decided to open this company. &quot; The American offensive began early last year , when Chrysler began building a right-side-drive Jeep Cherokee for Japan and cut its price . Chrysler sales here spurted to 5 # 698 last year from 1 # 602 vehicles in 1992 , and sales this year are running at more_than triple the pace of the first_half of 1993 . Last month , a second U.S.-made right-side-drive model was introduced here , the Ford Probe . At the same time , Ford began shipping to Japan its European-made right-hand-drive Mondeo . Festiva and Laser models made at Mazda factories in Japan were added_to the Ford lineup . General Motors sells right-side-drive cars here from its European Opel subsidiary . GM cut Opel prices 10 % just last week in response to the latest currency fluctuations . &quot; The strengthening of the yen against the dollar has done more to level the trade playing_field between Japanese and U.S. companies than all_of the rhetoric and policy initiatives of the previous 20 years , &quot; GM ' s Smith said . All of the Big Three have announced plans to start U.S. production of other right-side-drive vehicles for the Japanese market over the next year or two . If U.S. manufacturers can deliver a wider variety of right-side-drive vehicles at competitive prices , American cars have some advantages that should help boost sales . Design differences give them a distinctive look , and air_bags are more widely available in U.S. vehicles . &quot; I think , in_general , Japanese cars are a little behind in safety feature installation , &quot; Yamamoto said . &quot; That is a very regrettable thing. &quot; The Ford Mondeo ' s ceiling light , located next to the rear-view mirror , caught the eye of Yamamoto ' s wife , Nobuko . She had never seen a Japanese car designed that way , she said . &quot; I ' d like it , &quot; she explained , &quot; for when I put_on cosmetics. &quot; American cars are beginning to regain a good reputation , said Yamamoto , who was leaning strongly toward buying a Ford Mondeo wagon priced at the equivalent of $ 27 # 550 . &quot; Japanese consumers don ' t have prejudice , &quot; he said . &quot; If something is inexpensive and good , they will buy. &quot; U.S. Car Sales in Japan After years of effort , U.S. auto_makers appear to have gained a foothold in Japan and are enjoying a growth spurt this year , primarily because of the falling value of the dollar .
