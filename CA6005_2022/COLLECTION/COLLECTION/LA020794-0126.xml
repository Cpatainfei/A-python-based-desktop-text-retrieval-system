   <HEADLINE> BMW TAKES ON BRITISH CONNECTION ; AUTOMOBILES : THE GERMAN COMPANY HAS SIGNED DEALS WITH ROVER AND ROLLS-ROYCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> BMW , synonymous with German industrial quality and craftsmanship , is acquiring a British taste . The auto_maker known for status cars made news this past week with the purchase of Britain ' s Rover , the formerly state-owned maker of four-wheel drive vehicles . Less publicized , however , is BMW ' s other move_into the_British business world : a joint_venture with Rolls-Royce -- the jet_engine maker , not the luxury car_manufacturer . That deal , signed_in 1990 , returned BMW to its original business of making aircraft_engines . BMW and Rolls-Royce are each investing $ 570 million for a factory near Berlin to make jet_engines . Already they have orders totaling $ 850 million from Gulfstream of Savannah , Ga. , and Bombardier Inc. of Montreal . The BMW trademark , a circle with blue and white quadrants , represents an airplane_propeller . It reflects what the Bayerische Motoren Werke made in 1916 under one of its founders , Gustav Otto , son of the developer of the four-stroke engine . After World_War I , the Munich-based company had to retreat to making only railroad brakes for several years because of treaty restrictions , and World_War_II left its auto and aircraft_engine plants in ruins . Despite the setbacks , BMW has clawed its way up the global auto industry with farsighted management . The purchase of Rover cars roughly doubled BMW ' s share of the European auto market , disrupting the Europe strategy of Japan ' s Honda Motor Co . Honda holds 20 % of the Rover car-making subsidiary and , after 15 years of raising Rover quality , suddenly finds itself in an ungainly partnership with competitor BMW . BMW , which is building a plant in Greer , S.C. , to produce sporty two-seaters , is the only German car_maker to make money in 1993 . It is paying British Aerospace $ 1.2 billion for Rover from ample cash reserves . The combination will intensify competition in Europe , said analyst Hans Hartmann of the research arm of Dresdner Bank , which is BMW ' s house bank . &quot; Both BMW and Rover will want to export more intensively into the European market , &quot; he said . BMW will be able to add the four-wheel-drive Range Rover to its extensive distribution network in the United States , where BMW posted a sales gain in 1993 that helped offset the dismal German market . While the German auto industry overall registered a 23 % fall_in production to 3.75 million vehicles last year , BMW kept its production drop to 9.2 % , making 534 # 000 autos worldwide .</TEXT>
