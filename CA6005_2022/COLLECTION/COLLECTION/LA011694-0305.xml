   <HEADLINE> 4 VITAL MINUTES ; OUTLYING COMMUNITIES can ' t COUNT_ON TIMELY EMERGENCY SERVICE . A NEW ASSESSMENT DISTRICT MAY BE THE ONLY SOLUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The acronym is EMS . It stands_for the emergency medical service which the city provides you and your family when you phone 911 . Los Angeles Fire_Department paramedics arrive on the scene to help you -- fast ! -- most of the time . Nearly all_the 104 operating fire_stations in the city were positioned to serve densely populated areas . In central parts of the city , fire_stations tend to be closer to one another than elsewhere . Their normal response_times are within the department ' s goals . However , if you happen to live_in some areas on the outskirts of Los Angeles , say Hidden Hills , Sun Valley , Tujunga or the Pacific Palisades Highlands , or if your home is located in some of the hillside areas , paramedic help cannot get_to you as fast as you may need it . It is delayed because of long distances between homes and the nearest fire_station or because of miles of winding roads in the_hills . Despite best efforts , in some parts of the city paramedic help is several minutes away , longer if the team closest to you is_on another call . * For the victim of a severe heart_attack , a seizure , choking , a possible drowning or electrocution -- one whose breathing has stopped -- unless cardiopulmonary_resuscitation is administered within four minutes , the chances of survival drop precipitously . If six more minutes elapse , recovery is virtually out_of_the_question . The Fire_Department and the city ' s newly appointed Board of Fire Commissioners are aware of this problem . Faced with a severe shortfall in revenues in the coming months , the city ' s budget constraints have indefinitely postponed any plans to construct new fire_stations . One solution that has been suggested is asking residents of the few areas at risk if they want to form special_assessment districts . This idea is worthy of careful consideration . If an area approved such a district , the plan would work roughly like this : Bimonthly charges would be added_on water and power bills to residents . The money would be used to build , equip and staff new fire_stations in those areas . The response to both fires and medical emergencies would be speeded_up . An objection to this idea has been voiced based on the assumption that paramedics in the district could not help people who live outside it but nearby . That should never be the case . The sharing of fire resources ( including EMS ) is an overriding and well-accepted rule_in this region . We see it every time an emergency arises . We saw it happen in the fall brush_fires . Firefighting units arrived on the scene from hundreds of miles away -- even from out of state . When a community has an emergency , nearby communities pitch_in with whatever help they can reasonably provide . Emergency help should never be denied because of boundary_lines , whether they be city boundaries , state_boundaries or special_assessment district boundaries . That should be agreed upon before a district is formed . * We need to make the best of a difficult situation . No person should be deprived of fast , efficient medical emergency service when needed . Since we cannot build additional resources without more revenues , and since a general tax increase is politically out_of_the_question , some program of direct financial assistance to the city , approved by a majority vote of those living_in underserved areas , should be considered . Why not let those people who prefer the more open spaces or mountaintop views decide for themselves ? I , for one , would welcome the chance . One more step should be considered . That is referring many of the 60 # 000 non-emergency calls the Fire_Department receives each year to private medical_care givers , as our fire_chief proposed a_few days ago . * I ' m talking_about such things as stubbed toes and splinters . They account_for three-fourths of the runs made by our EMS teams . Turning them over to the private sector would save $ 6 million in the first year . The fact is , we don ' t have enough money , people or equipment at enough locations to respond to every call within four minutes . As with national health_care , EMS policy making is fraught with danger . There are always misunderstandings and misplaced expectations lurking about . Clearly there are political risks inherent in making any changes in the system . The debate becomes a process of deciding which advantages are most important to the public and which disadvantages ( costs among them ) the public is willing to live with . In the meantime , lives hang_in the balance . It ' s a growing problem that demands a solution -- now .</TEXT>
