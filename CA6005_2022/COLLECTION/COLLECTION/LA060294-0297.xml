   <HEADLINE> CONGRESS JOINING RANKS OF D.C. HIGH-CRIME AREAS ; ETHICS : SOME OBSERVERS SAY LATEST SCANDALS ARE RESULT OF GREATER PUBLIC SCRUTINY . OTHERS BLAME A CORRUPT SYSTEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , the neighborhood surrounding Capitol_Hill has been a high-crime area . Now the crime_wave looks_to be moving under the Capitol dome itself . With the indictment Tuesday of Rep . Dan Rostenkowski ( D-Ill. ) , the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , the number of criminal proceedings involving members of Congress has grown to imposing lengths . Two former lawmakers are currently in federal prison for financial misdeeds , another is free pending appeal of a bribery conviction last fall and still another is awaiting sentencing on charges of misusing public funds . Three other former legislators recently served time for bribery and related offenses . In addition to Rostenkowski , two other senior legislators also are under indictment and at least two more appear to be the targets of FBI investigations . In this century , only in the late 1970s -- when Congress was rocked by the so-called Koreagate and Abscam bribery scandals -- have so many members simultaneously been in prison , just out of prison or facing the prospect of prison . Even that accounting does not include the ethical lapses that did not lead to criminal prosecutions : the House post_office and banking scandals , which implicated dozens of members ; the sexual-misconduct allegations against Sen . Bob Packwood ( R-Ore. ) ; the exertions to protect savings and loan owner Charles H . Keating Jr . by five senators ; or the questionable financial transactions that forced the resignations of Democratic leaders Jim Wright and Tony Coelho in 1989 . Some attribute this confluence of scandal not to declining ethics but to intensifying scrutiny from the press , public and prosecutors , which has made behavior criminal that once was tolerated , if not endorsed . But others insist that the climate on Capitol_Hill is encouraging legislators to confuse incumbency with immunity and power with license . &quot; There is a clear environment up there that the rules aren ' t to be enforced , &quot; said Fred Wertheimer , president of Common Cause , a group that monitors government ethics . &quot; It does enormous damage to the institution because it allows lowest-common-denominator ethics to set the public standard for the institution. &quot; The flow of charges has been steady enough to guarantee a good living for lawyers who specialize in defending public officials charged in corruption cases . &quot; For me , it ' s been constant , &quot; said attorney Stan Brand , who has represented more_than two_dozen legislators since leaving his post as counsel to the House of Representatives to open his own firm 10 years ago . Over the years , congressional scandals have covered the gamut of human misbehavior . Legislators have fallen_into the bottle or the arms of prostitutes . A handful have been hauled into court on matters of high principle . In 1919 , for example , socialist Victor L . Berger of Milwaukee was convicted of violating the Espionage Act for opposing World_War I and was denied his seat in Congress . But the Supreme Court later overturned his conviction and Berger served three more terms in the 1920s . For almost all legislators who have gone astray , though , the path from lawmaker to law-breaker has involved no principle prouder than greed . Almost all_the prosecutions of sitting legislators in recent years have involved bribery , tax_evasion or misuse of public funds . The list includes : * New York Democratic Rep . Mario Biaggi , who served 26 months in a medium-security federal prison for an extortion conviction in a case involving Wedtech Corp. , a South Bronx company that spent lavishly in its search of defense contracts . Fellow New York Democratic Rep . Robert Garcia was twice convicted of extortion in the case and at one point served three months in prison , but each conviction was later overturned by a federal appeals court . * Former Rep . Lawrence J . Smith , a Florida Democrat who served three months last year for tax_evasion and lying to the Federal Election_Commission about using campaign funds to pay_off a gambling debt . * Pat Swindall , a former Republican representative from Georgia , is scheduled to remain until February , 1995 , in the minimum-security U.S. penitentiary camp in Atlanta after a perjury conviction in a case involving a personal_loan . Undercover agents told him that the loan involved the proceeds of laundered drug money . Swindall has filed a brief with the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals claiming new evidence and seeking to reopen his case . * Former Democratic Rep . Nicholas Mavroules of Massachusetts is to be confined until September at a medium-security federal institution in McKean , Pa. , after pleading guilty last year to an array of bribery and tax-evasion charges . * Albert G . Bustamante , a former Democratic representative from Texas , was sentenced last fall to 42 months in prison for accepting a bribe but is free on bond while appealing his conviction to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals . * Carroll Hubbard Jr. , a former Kentucky Democratic congressman , pleaded guilty in April to falsifying campaign reports , using public employees to work_on his wife ' s campaign for Congress and obstructing justice . While awaiting sentencing on June 30 , Hubbard has solicited his former colleagues to send letters to the judge urging leniency . * In addition to Rostenkowski , two other legislators are currently under indictment : Sen . Dave Durenberger ( R-Minn. ) on charges of fraudulently billing the Senate for use of a condominium he secretly owned , and Rep . Joseph M . McDade ( R-Pa. ) , who was indicted in May , 1992 , on charges of accepting bribes and illegal gratuities from defense lobbyists . Published reports also have indicated that the FBI is investigating at least two other legislators : Rep . Jay C . Kim ( R-Diamond Bar ) , on charges of illegally funneling money into his 1992 campaign from a business he owned , and Walter R . Tucker III ( D-Compton ) , as part of an investigation of corruption in Compton , where Tucker formerly served as mayor . Does this constitute a congressional crime_wave ? Compared to other professions , the frequency of ethical transgression in the contemporary Congress appears relatively high but not entirely out of line . During the last 20 years , about three dozen members of Congress either have been convicted of criminal offenses or censured by the House and Senate . That averages_out to about 3.5 legislators in any two-year congressional session -- or put another way , about one serious ethical sanction per 150 sitting legislators at any given time . Compare that to lawyers . In the 1989-1990 period , the latest for which complete figures are available , about 4 # 500 practicing lawyers were publicly sanctioned by the American Bar Assn . That averages_out to roughly one serious ethical problem per 190 accredited lawyers during the two-year period . Among securities dealers , serious ethical violations have been more rare : During the two-year period of 1992-1993 , less than one out of every 500 licensed securities dealers at the time was disbarred . But compared to historical standards , today ' s Congress might not look so bad . Throughout the 19th Century , and even well into this century , Rostenkowski might have had considerable company in the activities for which he was indicted -- allegedly padding his payroll and diverting official accounts to his personal use . In those years , the intimacy between money and power , like a particularly impetuous infidelity , was often consummated in plain sight . When Daniel Webster defended the Bank of the United States against President Andrew_Jackson ' s crusade to revoke its charter early in the 19th Century , for instance , the famed Massachusetts senator had more incentive than ideology : He was_on the bank ' s payroll as an attorney for its president . It is against the backdrop of such history -- and the 20th Century equivalents involving the now defunct urban political_machines -- that attorney Brand labels the current surge of congressional prosecutions &quot; part of the over-criminalization of life in America. &quot; Brand attributes the rising number of cases not to deteriorating ethical standards but a &quot; higher level of scrutiny , more rules , less tolerance for old ways -- not illegal ways but mores -- and more aggressive prosecutorial theory , taking peccadilloes and violations of House rules or Senate rules and making them into criminal cases. &quot; Prosecutors are devoting more energy than ever before to rooting_out public misconduct . Since 1976 , the Justice_Department has operated a public-integrity section that investigates members of Congress and other public officials . To most reformers , the real measure of Congress ' ethical problems is found not in such egregious examples of misconduct , but in the corrosive workaday trading of money and favors permitted under current campaign-finance and gift laws . For these critics , the workings of Congress testify to journalist Michael Kinsley ' s maxim that in Washington the real scandal almost always involves behavior that is legal . Wertheimer turns Brand ' s argument on its head : One key reason prosecutors have become more aggressive in dealing with public officials , he maintains , is that Congress has been so lax about enforcing its own ethics rules . More important than individual criminal prosecutions , Wertheimer argues , are system changes -- such_as the reforms in the laws governing gifts and campaign contributions now facing an uncertain future in House-Senate conference committees . &quot; While these individual cases of criminal prosecution are a serious warning_signal , &quot; Wertheimer said , &quot; the entire system up there is designed to allow improper conduct to occur under the guise of proper conduct. &quot;</TEXT>
