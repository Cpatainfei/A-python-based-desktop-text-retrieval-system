   <HEADLINE> SMOKING INITIATIVE FACES LEGAL TEST ; ELECTIONS : ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE SEEKS PERMISSION TO FIND WHETHER PEOPLE WERE MISLED INTO SIGNING PETITIONS FOR THE BALLOT MEASURE BACKED BY TOBACCO GIANT PHILIP MORRIS . OPPONENTS CALL THE MOVE POLITICAL GRANDSTANDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Contending that there is reason to believe that tobacco giant Philip Morris &quot; engaged in a systematic scheme of deception &quot; to gain signatures for a statewide smoking initiative , acting Secretary_of_State Tony Miller filed legal_action Wednesday that could lead to disqualification of the ballot measure . In what he says is an unprecedented step , Miller asked the Superior_Court in Sacramento to give him permission to question a sampling of voters who signed the initiative petition to determine whether they were deliberately misinformed . The ballot measure would abolish all local smoking bans and replace them with a looser , statewide standard . A spokesman for the Philip Morris-financed Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions argued that Miller ' s action was unconstitutional and that he was grandstanding to give him an advantage over his opponents in Tuesday ' s Democratic primary . &quot; It is blatantly clear that this is a fairly desperate attempt to call attention to himself in his campaign for secretary_of_state , &quot; said Lee H . Stitzenberger , whose firm , the Dolphin Group , represents the smoking initiative committee , Californians for Statewide Smoking Restrictions . One of Miller ' s primary opponents , former Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo , agreed . &quot; There is the appearance that ( Miller ) continues to use the office to advance his campaign goals that could have been avoided by waiting until after the election , &quot; said Woo ' s campaign manager , Steven Glazer . Miller said politics played no part in his decision to go_to court this week ; that he needed to act quickly to get the_matter settled by June 30 , the deadline for certifying measures for the November ballot . Miller ' s action was hailed by anti-smoking forces . Carolyn Martin , chairwoman of the Coalition for a Healthy California , said &quot; a scientific survey will prove that a least half of those who signed the tobacco_industry petition were duped or signed under false pretenses. &quot; Since 1972 , when signers of an initiative to legalize marijuana said they were being harassed by police , state law has protected the confidentiality of names on initiatives , referendums and recall petitions . They can be checked for accuracy by county election officials , but may be inspected for other purposes only with court approval . Miller wants the court to allow him to identify 400 or more randomly selected signers , who would be asked to describe what they were told by signature gatherers . Documents released by Miller show that paid signature gatherers were told not to deviate from two pitches made to potential signers -- that the petition imposed &quot; statewide smoking restrictions &quot; and that it increased penalties for selling tobacco to minors . The hired workers were apparently not to tell voters the initiative would strike_down local smoking ordinances that were stronger than the new law or that Phillip Morris was the sponsor . The smoking initiative committee ' s financial_statements show that Philip Morris provided $ 491 # 213 to qualify the measure . A smattering of bars and restaurants , including Willy ' s Lounge in Pomona and the Tonga Hut in North Hollywood , provided the rest , a total of $ 480 . Miller said that if he establishes that there was deception , he would ask the court to invalidate the ballot measure under a statute barring circulators from misrepresenting the contents of an initiative petition . The initiative committee has gathered 607 # 000 signatures to place the measure on the November ballot . It takes 423 # 473 to qualify . Election officials in each county , who by law have access to the names , are now determining the validity of the signatures .</TEXT>
