   <HEADLINE> DOCTOR FILES BIAS SUIT OVER LOSING KEY KING HOSPITAL JOB ; COURTS : OFFICIALS SAY DR . WILLIAM SHOEMAKER WAS REASSIGNED BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS IN KEEPING ACCREDITATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Almost 30 years ago , when Martin_Luther_King Jr . was leading his historic march from Selma to Montgomery , Ala. , the legendary civil_rights leader needed medical attention . A young white physician who had come from Chicago to join the protest was summoned to care_for King . He was Dr. William Shoemaker , and although he rarely discusses the_matter nowadays , his eyes still water at the recollection . Shoemaker , 70 , is an internationally renowned pioneer in the field of intensive care who has spent his life in teaching hospitals that serve the poor across the country . But now he is now engaged in a civil_rights struggle that he never envisioned . He is fighting to keep his job , a top post at the South-Central Los Angeles hospital that bears King ' s name -- the Martin_Luther_King Jr. / Drew Medical_Center . The legal shield he is using in an unusual lawsuit filed against the hospital is the Ku Klux Klan Act . &quot; I never dreamed that I would find myself , at this stage of my career , involved in a lawsuit to save my reputation and good name and resist what I believe to be fundamental unfairness and discrimination against me based upon my race and my age , &quot; Shoemaker said in a court declaration . After he was abruptly ordered to resign last month as chairman of the emergency department , Shoemaker filed a Los Angeles Superior_Court lawsuit charging that hospital officials acted_out of racial and age bias as well as in retaliation for his apparent whistle-blowing . A hearing is scheduled today . Medical_center officials denied the allegations and said Shoemaker was merely reassigned with no cut_in his $ 164 # 000-a-year salary . They say they acted in response to an accrediting agency ' s report that questioned Shoemaker ' s credentials and found major deficiencies in the emergency department ' s training_program for resident doctors . Within the next few weeks , the agency will decide whether to revoke the program ' s accreditation . Dr. Reed Tuckson , president of the Charles R . Drew University of Medicine and Science , said Shoemaker had to be reassigned because the accrediting agency is requiring that the emergency_room chairman be a board-certified emergency specialist -- and Shoemaker is not . &quot; I have spent my life fighting for human equality and I resent these allegations ( of discrimination ) , &quot; Tuckson said in an interview . &quot; They are not only untrue , they are unfair. &quot; Shoemaker assumed the post in 1991 after a nationwide search for a permanent chairman of the emergency department , which had been without a leader for about nine years . His recruitment was viewed_as a coup for a hospital that had struggled to attract good doctors . Shoemaker ' s resume is 36 pages long , listing about 400 articles in scholarly journals , as well as a leading textbook on critical care . Shoemaker alleges that he was demoted without good cause from a post that he was entitled to hold for six years and that carried an extra stipend that has now been withdrawn . The demand for Shoemaker ' s resignation came Dec . 17 . Shoemaker contends in his lawsuit that the move was prompted in part by a perception within the hospital that he is a whistle-blower who had provided information to the district_attorney ' s office and the Los Angeles Times about the death of Deputy_Sheriff Nelson Yamamoto . The rookie deputy died at the hospital in 1992 after surgery on gunshot wounds . The Times reported Nov . 15 that his death is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation . Tuckson said Shoemaker ' s dismissal resulted exclusively from the November report by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education threatening to shut_down the emergency department ' s training_program for 42 resident doctors , who provide the bulk of the patients ' care . The agency criticized the hospital ' s treatment facilities and supervision of residents by senior physicians . It noted that more_than half of the 13 supervising doctors , including Shoemaker , are not certified as emergency specialists and that three of the certified doctors only work one shift per week supervising patient care . The agency acknowledged that Shoemaker is an excellent surgeon but said he has limited experience in emergency medicine . Shoemaker disputed that , saying he has worked in emergency departments or interacted with them for 30 years in Chicago , New York City and Los Angeles . * In hopes of saving the residency training_program , county health services official Walter Gray said the hospital is hiring several physicians to bring the number of certified emergency specialists to 14 . He also said a national search has been launched for a new chairman who must be an emergency specialist . Meanwhile , the department will be run temporarily by a certified emergency specialist , Dr. H . Range Hutson , 44 , who is in_charge of the main admitting area of the emergency department at County-USC Medical_Center . Hutson is a graduate of Stanford_University and UC Davis School_of_Medicine . Not all_the emergency departments at teaching hospitals nationwide are headed by certified specialists in emergency medicine , which is a newer field than , for example , surgery or internal_medicine . * The largest emergency department in the country , at County-USC Medical_Center , is headed by Dr. Gail Anderson , who is not a certified specialist . But he said he is viewed_as having the equivalent qualifications , partly because he founded the department . He said his successor at County-USC will undoubtedly be certified as an emergency specialist . Of Shoemaker , Anderson said : &quot; I like him . I respect him . But it was a mistake &quot; that the hospital named him emergency department chairman in 1991 because he is not an emergency medicine specialist . He said Shoemaker ' s removal was appropriate . Dr. Mohamed Parsa , director of the trauma center at Harlem Hospital in New York City , said there is &quot; no question about Dr. Shoemaker ' s abilities and qualifications . . . To be disgraced with this kind of dismissal after he ' s given his life to humanity and to medicine is terrible. &quot; Parsa described Shoemaker as an unusually truthful man who sometimes offends people with his honesty . &quot; People gang_up on him , &quot; Parsa said , &quot; so he has had to pick_up and run &quot; from one hospital to the next like a &quot; scientific gypsy. &quot; Shoemaker said he has moved where opportunities present themselves , devoting most of his medical career to exploring new methods for boosting survival rates among acutely ill or injured patients . He joined the department of surgery at King in 1986 with the hopes of improving survival rates among patients with gunshot wounds and other severe trauma . He said he wants to stay_at King to complete his work and energize the younger residents . &quot; I am fighting for my position because much more_than a position is at stake -- fundamental fairness , 48 years of work , and my good name , which is being destroyed , &quot; Shoemaker said . * In 1965 , when he was setting_up the first organized trauma center at Cook County Hospital in Chicago , he heard the news that marchers in Selma had been attacked by police_dogs on &quot; Bloody Sunday. &quot; The doctor packed his bags and headed to Alabama with one of his sons , then 9 years old . March organizers immediately selected Shoemaker as part of a doctor squad to be ready in case violence broke_out . As it happened , there was no violence , but King needed minor medical attention . It was Shoemaker ' s privilege , he recalled , to provide care . Afterward , he met and talked with King on many occasions . &quot; It breaks his heart to be filing a lawsuit against an institution named after Martin_Luther_King Jr. , &quot; said Shoemaker ' s attorney , Rees Lloyd . &quot; But we both feel we ' d be hypocrites if we didn ' t. &quot;</TEXT>
