   <HEADLINE> INCHING AHEAD ON A ROUGH ROAD ; BANKS AND S &amp; LS POST IMPROVED RESULTS , BUT THE QUAKE ' S IMPACT , WEAK LOAN DEMAND LIMIT UPSIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Half of the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County area ' s largest banks and savings and loans reported improved earnings during the latest quarter as the recession loosened its grip on the region . But banking executives complained of sagging demand for loans and said that damage from the Northridge earthquake continued to hurt their profits . In the quarter ending June 30 , four of the area ' s eight largest banks and S &amp; Ls reported improved earnings , and two posted profits after year-earlier losses . Glendale Federal Bank reported a narrower loss , while Citadel Holding Corp . of Glendale has not yet filed its second-quarter results . American Pacific State_Bank in Sherman Oaks watched its profit climb to $ 360 # 000 in the second quarter ended June 30 , up 8 % from the year-earlier period . But were it not for the Northridge earthquake and its rattling of consumer confidence , &quot; We ' d have doubled our earnings , &quot; said Frank J . Ures , chief_executive of the bank . The earthquake hurt commercial and residential property values just when they appeared to be stabilizing , Ures said , and tripped businesses that had begun to gain momentum , including restaurants , car dealerships and other mid-size businesses that are among American Pacific ' s customers . As a result , the bank is still uncertain about how many firms will be able to survive earthquake-related setbacks . So the bank ' s provision for loan losses was $ 3.25 million on June 30 , up 35 % from a year earlier . The uncertainty could linger through the spring , when damaged businesses may finally be finished making repairs , Ures said . &quot; It ' s like a cancer , &quot; Ures said . &quot; You don ' t know whether you ' ve licked it or not. &quot; One banking institution that was troubled before the earthquake is Glendale-based Citadel Holding Corp. , the parent of the S &amp; L Fidelity Federal Bank . Citadel announced Friday the closure of a deal in which several unnamed investors purchased a combined 80 % ownership of its Fidelity Federal Bank subsidiary . Fidelity Federal received $ 109 million from the investors in the deal , giving the S &amp; L a badly needed cash infusion . Citadel lost $ 67 million in 1993 , and concern over deteriorating capital has prompted the Office of Thrift Supervision , the federal agency that regulates S &amp; Ls , to increase its oversight of the company . Citadel , which has also planned a separate bulk sale of $ 465 million in problem assets , said it expects to post a second-quarter loss of about $ 92 million . Glendale Federal Bank ' s $ 4.81-million loss in the latest quarter was an improvement over the $ 29-million loss reported a year earlier , but still came as a disappointment in light of the S &amp; L ' s goal to reach profitability by the end of its fiscal_year on June 30 . For its full fiscal_year , Glendale Federal reported a $ 209-million loss , compared to $ 80.8 million a year ago , largely due_to a third-quarter write-off of goodwill and other assets related to the sale of its Florida branches . Glendale Federal ' s total assets on June 30 were $ 16.8 billion , down from $ 17.9 billion a year earlier . Last September , Glendale Federal averted government seizure by undergoing a $ 451-million recapitalization . * Despite its struggles , Glendale Federal showed several signs of improvement . Its non-performing assets -- delinquent loans or foreclosed properties -- declined to 4 % of its total assets as of June 30 , from 5 % a year earlier . And the decline of its deposit base -- fueled by customers ' concern for the S &amp; L ' s financial_condition -- slowed to a $ 696-million outflow in fiscal 1994 after deposits declined by $ 2.1 billion a year earlier . One local bank that has been in existence since the 19th Century will soon be sold . Last week , Levy Bancorp , parent of Bank of A . Levy , announced that it had agreed to be purchased by Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp in a stock deal valued at $ 86.5 million . Marshall Milligan , president of 112-year-old Levy , said the bank welcomed the deal because it allowed Levy to choose a suitor at a time when options are dwindling because of increasing consolidation in the banking_industry . Milligan also said Levy had grown increasingly concerned with the pitfalls of being a local bank . &quot; We see increasing price_competition being driven by non-bank competitors , and that favors larger banks because they are the ones that are more efficient , &quot; Milligan said . Milligan acknowledged that some of Levy ' s 275 employees are likely to lose their jobs in the restructuring , and that some of the bank ' s 17 branches in Ventura County will be closed . In the latest quarter , Ventura-based Levy reported a profit of $ 1.87 million , compared to a loss of $ 3.48 million for the second quarter of 1993 . For the first six months of 1994 , Levy had income of $ 3.23 million , compared to a $ 4.28-million loss through the first six months of 1993 . With a 1.16 % return on average assets , Levy was the only local financial_institution to exceed the 1 % ROA benchmark that is considered a strong performance . Levy ' s non-performing assets were $ 30.5 million at the end of the latest quarter , down 55 % from a year ago . Still , 5 % of the bank ' s assets were in the non-performing category , and that ' s about twice the level of healthy banks . * Ventura County National Bancorp , the Oxnard-based parent of Ventura County National_Bank and Frontier Bank , reported meager earnings of $ 29 # 000 for the June quarter . But that marked the bank ' s first profitable quarter since 1992 , although the latest results were boosted by $ 791 # 000 in income from its Small Business Administration loan portfolio as a result of an accounting change . For the first six months of 1994 , VCNB reported an $ 85 # 000 loss , compared to a $ 4.25-million loss posted for the same period last year . Richard S . Cupp , president of Ventura , declined to comment on whether the bank wants to be purchased or is up for_sale . &quot; There will always be room for profitable , well-run independent community banks , &quot; Cupp said . Improvements in VCNB ' s loan portfolio enabled it to cut its quarterly loan-loss provision to $ 2.08 million , half the amount set_aside in the same quarter a year ago . But the bank remains below capital ratio requirements imposed by federal regulators earlier this year . The bank has until Sept . 30 to raise two ratios that measure equity as a percentage of risk-based assets . The bank must raise its so-called Tier 1 capital ratio from the current 8.25 % to 12 % , and its leveraged capital ratio from 6.16 % to 7 % . Failing to meet the Sept . 30 deadline could lead to sanctions , possibly including civil penalties or removal of personnel . Great Western Financial Corp. , the Chatsworth-based parent of Great Western Bank , had a solid second quarter , as earnings climbed 6 % to $ 55.9 million . For the first six months of 1994 , earnings were $ 105 million , up 7 % from the year-earlier period . The net interest margin -- the profit between the interest a financial_institution charges its borrowers and what it pays its depositors -- expanded to 3.71 % from 3.66 % in the first_quarter , and the S &amp; L has shed $ 800 # 000 in non-performing assets since June 1993 . Total provisions for loan losses in the quarter were $ 58.9 million , down 32 % from a year earlier . CU Bancorp , the Encino-based parent of California United Bank , reported its sixth straight quarter of increased profit after undergoing a major restructuring two years ago . In the latest quarter , the bank earned $ 608 # 000 , up 9 % from a year earlier . For the six months ended June 30 , net_income was $ 1.19 million , up 26 % from a year earlier . * CU Bancorp ' s strategy has been to move away from commercial real_estate lending and instead focus_on lending to mid-sized businesses . &quot; Last year . . . we brought_in $ 100 million in new loan commitments to middle market business , &quot; said CU President David Rainer . &quot; This year , we ' re ahead of that pace. &quot; Meanwhile , the bank has aggressively slashed costs : The bank moved its Beverly Hills branch to a cheaper Westwood location 18 months ago , and cut 10 jobs at the branch , which saves the bank $ 600 # 000 a year , Rainer said . CU Bancorp ' s assets dipped 16 % from a year ago to $ 278 million on June 30 , but non-performing assets for the latest quarter were $ 1.04 million compared to $ 9.99 million a year earlier . The bank ' s net interest margin improved to 5.84 % in the latest quarter from 5.42 % a year ago . On Friday , CU Bancorp said that its merger discussions with Bay Cities National_Bank , based in Redondo Beach , were terminated . On June 8 , the two organizations had signed a letter_of_intent to merge . TransWorld Bancorp , the Sherman Oaks-based parent of TransWorld Bank , posted earnings of $ 625 # 000 for the June quarter , up 16 % from the same quarter a year earlier . Even with a $ 300 # 000 charge in the first_quarter for earthquake-related damage and foreclosed property , the bank ' s earnings for the first six months were $ 893 # 000 , up 12 % from the same period of 1993 . * Since January , TransWorld has added $ 40 million in new deposits , said John R . Marquis , executive_vice_president . That figure is padded by earthquake insurance money that has poured into the region , but Marquis also said deposits have grown because the economy has strengthened and businesses have more cash . Now the bank is waiting for loan demand to pick_up , Marquis said . American Pacific reported that its assets reached a record $ 265 million in the June quarter , up 17 % from a year ago , thanks to the introduction of new products and the opening of a branch in Van Nuys . But the bank remains cautious of more earthquake-related loan problems , and has built_up its allowance for loan losses to $ 3.25 million from $ 2.4 million a year ago . &quot; Our biggest problem is finding loans , &quot; Ures said . &quot; People who are credit-worthy are still waiting . Nobody wants to borrow. &quot; Second-Quarter Report From the Region ' s Largest Financial Institutions For the quarter that ended June 30 : Note : This table may be divided , and additional information on a particular entry may appear on more_than one screen . 05 # 18 , 12 # 10 , 17 # 13 Assets Change June 30 from Profit Change from Banks ( millions ) year ago ( Loss ) year ago Levy Bancorp $ 625.5 -14 % $ 1.87 million NA ( parent of Bank of A .
