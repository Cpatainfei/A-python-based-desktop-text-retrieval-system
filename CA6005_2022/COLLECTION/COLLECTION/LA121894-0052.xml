   <HEADLINE> WILD STORMS RAGE FAR BEYOND MOTHER EARTH ; WEATHER : THE MOST IMPRESSIVE OF ALL ' BLOCKING HIGHS , ' JUPITER ' S GREAT RED SPOT , IS A CALDRON OF CLOUDS STIRRED BY FIERCE WINDS THAT HAVE BEEN IN TURMOIL FOR AT LEAST 300 YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If any strange weather occurs in the next few months , some people probably will blame Jupiter and the chunks of comet that slammed into it . Wrong , but not as far-fetched as it sounds . By studying the effects of the comet ' s impacts , scientists may learn more about Earth ' s atmosphere and weather . Like Earth , Jupiter and some_other planets in the solar_system come equipped with an atmosphere , clouds , jet_streams and storms . In fact , Jupiter ' s Great Red Spot , the longest-running known storm in the universe , has a lot in common with a weather pattern on Earth called a &quot; blocking high. &quot; &quot; Both are high-pressure systems that prevent other conditions from intruding , &quot; said Timothy E . Dowling , a planetary scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . &quot; On Earth , blocking highs can last for months and cause droughts by fending off the rain_clouds that would normally water a region . They commonly occur in central Russia and the Midwestern United States. &quot; The granddaddy of all blocking highs , Jupiter ' s Great Red Spot , is a caldron of whirling clouds stirred by fierce winds that have been in turmoil for at least 300 years . At times , as_many as three Earths would fit inside it . Like a rock in a stream , the Red Spot blocks other swiftly passing clouds and sends them spinning into short-lived eddies . &quot; And there are hundreds of little guys too , &quot; said Dowling . Jupiter roils with smaller versions of the Great Red Spot . These vortices interact with heat from the planet ' s interior , setting_in_motion bands of jet_streams . Winds on Jupiter have been calculated at more_than 260 m.p.h. &quot; Instead of meandering unpredictably like terrestrial hurricanes , storms on Jupiter simply drift at a constant rate either eastward or westward , &quot; said Dowling . &quot; One reason for the simpler situation is the lack of mountain_ranges and air-sea interfaces that act_on Earth to thwart the natural tendency for winds to settle into steady east-west patterns. &quot; But winds on Jupiter are gentle zephyrs compared to those on Neptune . Orbiting in a deep_freeze of minus 328 degrees , Neptune unleashes winds estimated at nearly 1 # 250 m.p.h. , the fastest in the solar_system . The largest storm on Neptune , an Earth-size vortex called the Great Dark Spot , wears a scarf of bright clouds , much like those on Earth ' s mountain_peaks . Winds racing around Neptune are deflected upward by the storm , creating the rapidly changing companion clouds . The clouds and storms form as convection shoots hydrocarbon gases_up into colder regions , where they condense into bright ice . As with Jupiter and Neptune , internal heat drives Saturn ' s turbulence . About every 30 years , a huge area of white clouds erupts near the planet ' s equator and encircles Saturn for a_few months . The last episode occurred in October , 1990 . In these clouds , moisture condenses and liberates its latent_heat , said Dowling . &quot; This kind of storm seems to explode like a bomb . It ' s the same kind of energy source that raises cumulus towers high into the air on Earth and powers hurricanes. &quot; Once mistaken for clouds by telescope astronomers , great dust_storms periodically rage across Mars for months , creating a yellowish haze . Some grow so large that they blanket the entire planet . &quot; We see dune fields on Mars as big as the Sahara , &quot; said Ronald Greeley , an Arizona State University geologist . &quot; It takes 100 m.p.h. winds to raise the dust into the atmosphere . The violence of extraterrestrial volcanoes also intrigues scientists studying the possible correlation to eruptions on Earth . &quot; Venus has a large amount of volcanic activity , so_much so that it appears that the surface is , in geological terms , relatively new , although the planet itself , like Earth , is 4.5 billion years old , &quot; said Edward C . Stone , director of the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena . &quot; The surface has been recoated by volcanic flows to the extent that its average age is only about 500 million years. &quot;</TEXT>
