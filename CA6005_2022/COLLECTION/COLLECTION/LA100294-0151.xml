   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON MEDIA ; ' INFORMATION POLLUTION ' IS REAL ; TALK ABOUT ' POLLUTING THE JURY POOL ' IS JUST A METAPHOR , BUT IT GIVES LIFE TO THE NEW MEDIA ECOLOGY MOVEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rising to the surface of debate surrounding the O.J. Simpson trial is the notion of information as pollution . Judge Lance A . Ito and lawyers for both the prosecution and the defense all have talked_about media exposure possibly &quot; polluting &quot; the jury pool . Technically speaking , this is a metaphor , but it ' s one that is extremely useful to understanding the growing media-literacy movement . Behind the metaphor lies an awareness that not everything that pours_out of that tube or out of those speakers is good_for_you . More information may_not necessarily be better information . The idea is starting to take_hold , that is , that some kinds of information -- particularly but not solely with_respect_to a jury ' s deliberations during a trial -- may be noxious , harmful or even , in some respects , poisonous . The idea is not a new one , but it is newly salient and persuasive this time around . Many of us remember the wartime slogan , &quot; Loose lips sink ships. &quot; That was a dramatic way of reminding Americans during the two world_wars that the free flow of certain information could cause mortal damage . More recently , during the Persian_Gulf_War , when Saddam Hussein caused propagandistic interviews with downed American airmen to be aired on CNN , the notion of information and imagery as potentially toxic to the morale of U.S. forces took_hold . More recently still , in the debate over violence on television , one increasingly hears scholars such_as George Gerbner , dean emeritus of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania , speaking explicitly about launching a &quot; media ecology movement &quot; and arguing for the need to think in terms of conserving the quality of our media environment . Gerbner calls persuasively for a cleanup of what he calls &quot; happy violence &quot; on television , as if images of violence presented without their negative consequences were a toxic effluent being poured into the air that surrounds us . We are increasingly aware , in other words , that what we unthinkingly refer to as &quot; the media &quot; literally is the stuff , the_matter , the environment in which we live . While our bodies live_on nutritious food , clean water and fresh air , our minds are nourished ( or not ) by both the quantity and the quality of the information and images that we expose them to . Information and imagery provide , that is , our brain ' s sole food and the only air it has to breathe . Truth and falsity are essential to the quality of our information environment , but they are not the only relevant variables . In the courtroom , the question of whether information , accurate or not , may be prejudicial to jurors ' judgment helps to determine ( in Judge Ito ' s terms ) the degree of possible &quot; pollution of the pool. &quot; The power of images as role_models for behavior establishes a further set of criteria for evaluating media ecology by raising such questions as , does this picture advocate or endorse helpful or harmful behavior ? In a currently controversial example , the Postal Service has issued a stamp commemorating blues legend Robert Johnson ; the stamp replicates an old photo of Johnson in which the cigarette between his lips has been air-brushed out . The &quot; information &quot; in the original photo may be more &quot; truthful , &quot; but the alteration furnishes further evidence that the idea of media ecology -- &quot; down with toxic imagery ! &quot; -- is starting to stick . The current courthouse discussions of preserving the jury pool from pollution by exposure to the wrong information have gone even further in planting the idea . We might even be led to hope that without spending_a_penny of real money , a &quot; superfund &quot; of sorts might be established to clean_up the toxic_waste_dumps of our media by encouraging us to begin on our own to sort_out what ' s worth noting in the media from what ' s worth nothing or worse . Media literacy means knowing how to avoid media litter . Even amid the dross of the overplayed story of sex and violence surrounding the Simpson trial , a kernel of goodness can be found : Media environmentalism is born !</TEXT>
