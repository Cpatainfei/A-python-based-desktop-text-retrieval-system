   <TEXT> For the band of traders who peddle souvenirs to tourists taking_in the sweeping view of the Russian_capital near Moscow State University , there is one preferred currency for doing business : the U.S. dollar . Even the local police like their bribes in greenbacks . Half a world away in the Cambodian_capital , Phnom Penh , foreigners entering the country must pay_for an entry visa , a hotel taxi and the hotel itself in a single currency : the U.S. dollar . In Hamburg , Germany , a local trader buys oil from a Dutch company and ships it to Switzerland . The transaction is completed in a single currency : the U.S. dollar . &quot; It ' s the global currency , &quot; says Peter Stroink , a spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell in Rotterdam , the_Netherlands . &quot; that ' s the tradition , that ' s the reality. &quot; And to a far greater extent than most Americans appreciate , that simple fact is responsible_for much of their current prosperity . In effect , the rest of the world is helping Americans go_on a global shopping binge . It is a benefit no one else has -- one the late French President Charles de Gaulle called the &quot; exorbitant privilege &quot; of the country with the leading international currency . Exorbitant indeed . As recently as 1980 , the United States had a credit of $ 400 billion with the rest of the world -- in_effect , a positive balance of $ 400 billion on its global credit_card . But so profligate has America been since then that the United States today is easily the world ' s biggest debtor country , with a negative credit balance of a staggering $ 550 billion . What if dollars suddenly fell_out of fashion around the world ? What if other countries were no longer eager to get their hands on American greenbacks ? In effect , America would be disciplined , much as a youth whose parents take_away his credit_card . But in this case the mechanism would be the law of supply and demand : The dollar ' s new global unpopularity would drive its price down , as surely as unpopular cars cost less than desirable ones . While the cheaper dollar would have some advantages for Americans , the bad news would be that the dollar ' s buying power overseas would shrivel . In short , Americans would find that they could afford fewer Sony video recorders and BMW sedans and less Chanel perfume than now . Their standard_of_living would take a turn for the worse -- a sharp turn . Already the dollar is showing signs of losing some of its global magic . It has taken a beating against the Japanese currency ; in June , for the first time since World_War_II , it bought fewer than 100 yen . It once bought 360 . But the shopping spree goes_on . In fact , the most recent government figures show that in July , Americans registered an $ 11-billion deficit in their trade_in goods with the rest of the world , the second-largest monthly figure ever . That means Americans added another $ 11 billion to the supply of dollars floating around outside the United States . They could do that only because the preferred currency , whether in Moscow , Mogadishu or Montevideo , remains the U.S. dollar . Foreign governments , banks , businesses and individuals still cannot get enough of it . Consider : * Trade . Although the United States accounts_for only 12.5 % of international trade , slightly more_than half of the $ 3.7 trillion in goods and services sold across international borders last year were priced and paid_for in U.S. dollars . Every drop of crude_oil , no matter where produced or where consumed , is bought and sold in dollars . The same is true of many other commodities , such_as sugar , wheat , coffee , cotton , natural_gas , gold , silver , zinc , lead and copper . Likewise for many other products that will never have anything directly to do with the United States : cotton shirts made in India and sold to Tanzania , Argentine beef exported to Mexico , Polish ham packaged in Denmark and shipped to Canada . Even in Japan , where there is a national allergy to foreign-made goods , the greenback is an exception . Nearly half of Japan ' s exports are sold for U.S. dollars , according to the Ministry for International Trade and Industry , and Tokyo pays_for nearly three-quarters of its imports in dollars . * Reserves . The dollar remains the preferred currency for global reserves -- money socked away in government central_banks to guarantee a nation ' s financial stability and well-being in much the same way a savings account provides security for a family . Of the $ 1.1 trillion in official reserves held by central_banks throughout the world , just over 60 % is held_in U.S. dollars , according to the International Monetary Fund . Led by the new economic powers of the Asian Pacific region , developing nations alone added $ 250 billion to their reserves from 1988 to 1993 . Among the world ' s largest holders of U.S. dollars , with $ 51 billion , is little Taiwan . * Foreign exchange . A study by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel , Switzerland , found that of the $ 880 billion worth of currency traded daily on global foreign_exchange markets in April , 1992 , the U.S. dollar was involved in no less than 83 % of all deals . Anyone in Tokyo wanting to trade yen for German marks must first sell the yen for dollars . Only with dollars is it possible to buy the marks . * Cash . The U.S. Federal_Reserve_Board has found a steady increase in_demand for cash dollars abroad since the early 1960s . In 1991 , the latest year for which the Fed has figures , there were nearly twice as_many greenbacks floating around outside the United States as there were within the 50 states . Seven of every 10 $ 100 bills in circulation were estimated to be physically outside the United States in 1991 , and Fed officials believe the share is higher today . &quot; There ' s a large potential market out there , with the Russian appetite for dollars unslaked and the Chinese looming over the horizon , &quot; said Richard Porter , a Fed economist . Battered Bucks But even all this has not been enough to stem a sharp decline of the dollar against the world ' s strongest currencies . Compared with 20 years ago , it now takes nearly three times as_many dollars to buy a Japanese television_set or a Swiss watch whose price in the local currency has not changed . On a similar basis , the cost of a German car has more_than doubled . But at_the_same_time , the dollar has gained strength against the currencies of some of America ' s biggest trading partners . The dollar ' s power to buy Canadian lumber , British marmalade and Brazilian coffee has actually increased since 1973 . Besides sustaining a comfortable lifestyle , the dollar ' s global popularity provides Americans other , more subtle , benefits . &quot; The dollar is a symbol of power worldwide , &quot; noted an international economist . &quot; It ' s part of what makes other countries look_up_to the United States as the world ' s preeminent economy. &quot; Norbert Walter , chief economist at Germany ' s largest financial_institution , the Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt , added : &quot; The dollar is not just a strong currency . It is the reflection of a strong continent which comprises military , political and economic power. &quot; The dollar emerged as an international currency in the years after World_War I as nations sought an alternative to the_British pound when Britain abandoned the gold_standard . The greenback ' s rise helped signal that the era of Pax Britannia was ending and that the American Century was at_hand . After World_War_II the dollar became the global currency , reflecting America ' s dominance at a time when Germans survived in bombed-out ruins , Parisians limped along on four hours of electricity a day , the Japanese reeled from nuclear destruction and even the victorious British were forced to grub for coal to keep warm . Unchallenged in the Pacific , dominant in Europe , the United States held two-thirds of the world ' s gold reserves , half of its manufacturing production and half of its shipping capacity . It supplied one-third of total global exports . Just as English quickly became the Western world ' s lingua_franca , so too did the dollar become its accepted medium for business . Today America ' s relative power in the world has diminished . Europe collectively outproduces the United States by a wide margin . Japan ' s trading power seems to mock American efforts to control it . The U.S. share of global exports is less than half of what it was in the late 1940s . Still , the dollar holds its monopoly . Pakistanis and Thais , Kenyans and Filipinos , Canadians and Chileans -- people everywhere have grown accustomed to communicating in English and conducting their trade_in U.S. dollars . &quot; It ' s a common_denominator , &quot; said Miron Mushkat , chief economist for Asia at Lehman Bros . in Tokyo . &quot; If you have multiple parties engaged in trade , they need . . . a common language . It ' s very difficult to trade with hundreds of countries in their own currency . If I have to deal with China in Mandarin , with Malaysia in Malaysian and with the Philippines in Tagalog , this is very costly . Over time , one language , one currency dominates international trade and commerce. &quot; Easy to Use While America ' s position as the world ' s leading trading nation certainly helps keep the dollar popular , the American currency is also easy to use . Like a bottle of Coke or a pair of Levi ' s , the dollar is instantly recognizable . Unlike those of other major currencies such_as the yen , the mark and the_Swiss franc , all dollar denominations are the same size , shape and color . What ' s more , U.S. paper_money has not changed in more_than half a century . &quot; It ' s good to know the presidents , &quot; noted Sasha Ivanov , a 27-year-old Muscovite whose street-side table in the city ' s Sparrow Hills tourist area is stacked with nesting dolls , amber jewelry and other trinkets he hopes to sell for dollars . &quot; I know them all_in order : It goes Washington , Lincoln , Hamilton . . . . &quot; &quot; No , you ' re wrong , &quot; interrupted another trader , Dmitri Turkin , triumphantly . &quot; It goes Washington , Jefferson , Lincoln , Hamilton , Jackson , Grant , Franklin . You forgot the $ 2 bill. &quot; The Russian language probably has more words for the dollar than for the ruble : baksi ( bucks ) , zelyonyiye ( green ) , kapusta ( cabbage ) , krop ( dill ) , zelon ( green herbs ) and even just green in accented English . &quot; There ' s no currency here more widely accepted than American dollars , &quot; said Igor Doronin , chief adviser of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange . &quot; Just try to use Swiss_francs or Japanese yen here . No one will take them . No one knows what they are. &quot; The story is similar almost everywhere . In Rio de Janeiro : &quot; When people come from Europe or Asia or other countries , they don ' t bring their money ; they bring dollars because they know they can get a better exchange_rate , &quot; said Fabio Mamedio , whose downtown Rio travel_agencies have changed money for years . &quot; If they bring yen or francs , I charge them an extra 10 % because there ' s just no demand for it. &quot; Never mind the local currency ; the_British Broadcasting Corp. ' s World Service_programs routinely note business dealings in U.S. dollars . Despite their multinational membership , the International Monetary Fund , the World_Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development invariably express statistics in dollars . Before the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe , anyone managing to get_hold_of a_few dollars could go_to special hard-currency stores to buy goods impossible to purchase with local money . A standing joke in Warsaw holds that the only similarity between the United States and Communist-era Poland was that a dollar could buy anything in either country , while the Polish zloty was worthless in both . Although the post-Communist zloty has become a currency of genuine value , the dollar remains king in Poland . Buy a foreign car in Warsaw and the price is in dollars . Renting property to foreigners for dollars may be technically illegal , but many Polish landlords do_it . &quot; The dollar is the hedge against inflation , &quot; one Warsaw resident said . &quot; It ' s the basis people compare everything to. &quot; In Latin_America , where national currencies have been historically vulnerable to bouts of hyper-inflation that make them all but worthless , citizens have frequently turned_to the dollar . Brazil is the latest example . With an inflation_rate reaching thousands of percentage_points per year , many Brazilians used the dollar as a measuring stick for what things really cost . &quot; It was the reference_point , &quot; said Clarice Pechman , executive_director of the Brazilian Assn . of Exchange Dealers . In the business_community , merchants routinely asked that long-term agreements and payments on consignment be made in dollars , even though this was technically illegal . &quot; You had to do_it , &quot; said Antonio Gomes , a furniture maker . &quot; Otherwise , by the time you got your money in cruzeiros , it could be half or even one-third of the original selling price. &quot; A black_market quickly developed to supply dollars to those who wanted to hold more_than the government allowed . Newscasts routinely broadcast not only the dollar ' s official exchange_rate but the black_market rate . So many dollars were circulating by 1988 that the central_bank began legalizing some dollar outlets and buying dollars itself from what was once the black_market . In July , Brazil introduced a new currency , the real , and pegged its value to that of the U.S. dollar . That brought inflation down to about 2 % in August from the 50 % rate in June , the last month of the cruzeiro . But the public remains understandably jittery . Rosanna Gois , an administrative assistant at a Sao Paulo architectural firm , is just one of many Brazilians who are not quite ready to declare the government ' s new economic plan a success and give_up their caches of dollars . &quot; These plans come and go , &quot; she said . &quot; But I know that the dollar is always going_to be there. &quot; Neighboring Argentina experienced a similar crisis and tried a similar solution . As inflation reached 100 % a month in the late 1980s , supermarkets had teams of employees whose only job was to go_through shelves and mark_up prices . Finally , Argentina did what Brazil would do a_few years later -- it &quot; dollarized &quot; the economy by fixing the_Argentine peso ' s value to the dollar and committing the central_bank to offering dollars at a guaranteed rate to anyone who wanted them . Now inflation has dropped to U.S. levels and the economy is growing , but new strains are also apparent that make economists worry whether keeping pace with the dollar might be too_much to ask of Argentina ' s economy . It is only in the past decade that other currencies -- namely the mark and the yen -- have grown in importance in global finance . And it is only recently that they have begun cutting_into the dollar ' s preeminence . The Competition Despite the cases of Brazil and Argentina , the number of foreign countries that peg their currencies ' values directly to the dollar has dropped from 36 in 1988 to 20 today . Industrialized nations have reduced the percentage of their central_bank reserves held_in dollars . Even the greenback ' s presence in 83 % of all foreign_exchange dealings represents a drop from 90 % in 1989 . Jozef Van ' t Dack , an economist with the Bank for International Settlements , also sees evidence that the mark , yen and ecu -- an artificial , weighted mixture of several European currencies -- have begun to erode the dollar as an invoicing currency and medium_of_exchange . &quot; International investors don ' t like the dollar , &quot; he maintained . &quot; You can see it in the latest figures . Over the last 20 years , the mark and yen have become much more important. &quot; Andrew Smith , a currency specialist at the London-based securities firm UBS Ltd. , calls this part of a &quot; measured decay &quot; of the dollar , an inevitable consequence of chronic , massive U.S. trade_deficits . &quot; It ' s the same thing that happened to the pound , &quot; he said . Still , few see an immediate threat to the dollar ' s worldwide dominance . &quot; These are tectonic shifts that will take decades to play_out , &quot; Smith said . Other factors have blocked the yen and mark from playing roles commensurate with their strength : * The attraction of a nation ' s currency is more_than simply a reflection of its economic might . It is a measure of a country ' s power -- military and political as well as economic . Nearly half a century after the end of World_War_II , both Germany and Japan remain military midgets that play only marginal roles in shaping major global political decisions . Only the United States is giant in all three departments . * For many years , both the German and Japanese central_banks actively opposed the use of their currencies as global reserves , fearing that large foreign holdings would sap their ability to manage their own economies . &quot; A deutsche_mark in foreign hands meant that something unexpected could happen , &quot; explained Walter , the Deutsche Bank chief economist . &quot; The Bundesbank feared earthquakes , landslides . Only when they realized they could not prevent the mark being used as a reserve currency did they grudgingly accept it. &quot; At the Bank_of_Japan , it was the mid-1980s before resistance to foreign holdings of yen turned_to reluctant acceptance . * A lingering antipathy toward Germany in Europe and toward Japan in East Asia has dampened enthusiasm for holdings of both currencies in the regions where they would naturally be the strongest . Because of these and other factors , many currency specialists find it hard to see how the dollar could ever be completely eclipsed . &quot; The dollar ' s importance will decline gradually over time , but it will still keep the dominant position it has had in the past , &quot; said Van ' t Dack . &quot; Demand for the dollar will remain , &quot; argued Walter . &quot; You would need massive mistakes like another Vietnam and a weak , vacillating ( Jimmy ) Carter presidency with all_the costs and political errors associated with them to change this. &quot; New technology and sophisticated new currency markets have helped blunt any perceived need to switch from a sagging dollar . &quot; It ' s not so_much a question of dollar strength ; it ' s more the growing irrelevance of denomination , &quot; said Bank of International Settlements economist Gavin Bingham . &quot; It ' s now much easier to protect against a currency exposure than in the past , so there ' s no pressure to move away from the dollar . &quot; The dollar is the premier currency and will remain so . The weight of history will keep it there. &quot; Times staff writers Rone Tempest in Beijing , William R . Long in Buenos Aires , Michael Parks in Jerusalem , Juanita Darling in Mexico_City , Ron Harris in Rio de Janeiro , Charles P . Wallace in Singapore , David Holley in Tokyo , Dean E . Murphy in Warsaw and Joel Havemann in Washington contributed to this report , as did Steven Gutterman and Beth Knobel of The Times ' Moscow Bureau . The Mighty Dollar The value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies , calculated by showing how much of the particular currency $ 1 would buy : Advantages of a strong dollar * Foreign vacations cheaper for American tourists . * Imports cost less in American stores . * The price of_imported raw_materials and components for American industry are reduced . * America ' s image is enhanced overseas . Advantages of a weak dollar * American exports become cheaper and thus more competitive on world markets . * The attractiveness of foreign investment in the United States is increased . * More foreign tourists visit U.S. Source : U.S. Federal_Reserve_Board</TEXT>
