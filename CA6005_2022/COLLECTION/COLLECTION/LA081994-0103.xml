   <HEADLINE> LAST-SECOND MALFUNCTION ABORTS SHUTTLE LAUNCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The space shuttle Endeavour roared to life Thursday as the countdown clock read zero . Then it suddenly shuddered into silence -- its main engines shut_down before the scheduled dawn launch because of an overheated fuel pump . It was the fifth engine shutdown at the pad in 13 years of shuttle flights and the third since March , 1993 . But none had been so close to launch . Deidra Baker , wife of the shuttle commander , was watching from the launch control_center three miles away with their two daughters . Her voice quivered as she described seeing husband Michael Baker stuck inside a vibrating , rumbling , 2 # 000-ton rocket ship filled with explosive fuel . Baker said he and the five other astronauts fell silent when red warning_lights flashed in the cockpit . The astronauts were strapped in their seats for about an hour after the launch was aborted , as ground_crews rushed to make_sure that Endeavour was safe . The launch team ' s prime concern was the possibility of hydrogen fuel leaks ; that ' s why 300 # 000 gallons of water were sprayed at the pad . &quot; I think everything went well . The systems did their job and shut us down , &quot; said Baker , a Navy captain and former test_pilot . When the three main engines fired on cue 6 1 / 2 seconds before liftoff and spewed huge clouds of steam , NASA ' s deputy manager for engines , Boyce Mix , said he thought &quot; we had it in the bank. &quot; One by one , the engines were turned_off automatically by computer command , starting 1.9 seconds before the solid rocket boosters were to have ignited . NASA ' s countdown clocks got all_the way to zero when the launch was halted . Mix said the problem was with a high-pressure fuel pump in main engine No . 3 that overheated . The pump had just been refurbished , and there was no immediate explanation for why it failed , he said . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing a redesigned version of the pump that is intended to improve safety while reducing maintenance . If an engine had failed soon after liftoff , Baker would have had to attempt a dangerous emergency_landing at the space center . The Earth-monitoring mission -- a repeat of an April flight -- is off until early October . Shuttle managers decided to proceed with Discovery ' s scheduled Sept . 9 launch and move Endeavour off the pad next week in_order to replace all three engines .</TEXT>
