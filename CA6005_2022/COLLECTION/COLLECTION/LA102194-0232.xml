   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; GOVERNOR ; BROWN ASSAILS WILSON OVER COLLEGE FEE HIKES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Democrat Kathleen Brown , moving quickly to frame newly proposed college fee increases as a political liability for Gov . Pete Wilson , said Thursday that the Republican incumbent had engineered such hikes as hidden_tax increases on the middle_class . In a hastily arranged appearance in front of the Long_Beach headquarters for the California State University system , Brown said that as governor she would refuse the proposed 10 % fee increase voted upon by CSU trustees two hours earlier . The trustees did not formalize the increase , saying they would prefer that the Legislature and the governor find enough money to cover their shortfall for the coming year . The 1995-96 fees for undergraduate students would rise to $ 1 # 740 if the increase is implemented , up from $ 1 # 584 this year . Graduate fees would rise to $ 1 # 830 . &quot; This is a system that used to be affordable and accessible for all , &quot; said Brown , whose father , Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown , was instrumental in developing the state ' s university system . &quot; Well , it isn ' t affordable and it isn ' t accessible anymore. &quot; Brown has long derided Wilson for the dramatic fee increases that have occurred during his term as governor , and she has gained substantial support from college_students who are angry over the high cost of education . Her effort Thursday was meant to broaden that support beyond students who vote_in low numbers to their more dependable -- politically speaking -- parents . She targeted her arguments toward the &quot; middle_class , &quot; a term she repeated several times , and cast them along classic Republican lines . &quot; This is just another example of Pete Wilson trying to levy yet another tax on middle-class Californians , &quot; she said . &quot; As we all know , these so-called fee increases are really simply hidden_tax increases , hidden_tax increases on middle-class families who are trying to send their kids to college. &quot; Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur sharply rebuked Brown for criticizing the fee increases in an election year when , he said , she had not objected previously . &quot; If she has any evidence of any lobbying she did , any letters she wrote , any written correspondence , we ' d love to see it , &quot; he said . &quot; What Kathleen Brown didn ' t say today is how she would pay_for this fee increase : She would raise taxes , &quot; he said . Brown , who has sworn she will not raise taxes , contended that Wilson ' s support for past fee increases and her refusal to allow them next year signaled a clear demarcation between the candidates . &quot; The incumbent governor believes California can solve problems by raising taxes and fees , &quot; she said . &quot; I think we ' ve got_to cut , not tax. &quot; Such conservative language is meant to attract the ear not only of tuition-paying parents but also moderate voters who may be fearful of stereotypes about Democratic spending and Republican thriftiness . Wilson is targeting those same voters with television commercials alleging that Brown would sharply increase taxes if elected . In seeking to turn party stereotypes on their ear , Brown faces an uphill struggle : In Los Angeles Times polls taken_in September and early October , voters rated Wilson as the candidate best equipped to handle the economy . He also was rated better than Brown on fighting crime and grappling with illegal immigration . Brown ' s strength was seen as the subject she addressed Thursday : education . The Democratic nominee , when pressed by reporters , said she would be able to fund education at current levels without harming any other state programs because she would generate savings through a performance review of all state functions . Brown says that such a review would pinpoint $ 5 billion in savings over four years . Since the review has not been undertaken , she cannot say specifically where the savings would occur , but insisted Thursday that she was confident of finding the excess . &quot; My budget plan does not contemplate fee increases at community_colleges and CSU next year , and I ' ll be fighting to hold_the_line , &quot; she said . In her brief remarks , which were applauded by a_few college_students gathered nearby , Brown cited college system studies that blamed Wilson-era budget_cuts for slicing 5 # 000 courses out of the CSU schools . In the last three years , as fees have risen 130 % , nearly 200 # 000 students have dropped_out of the state ' s colleges and universities , including 30 # 000 CSU students , Brown said . Schnur , however , countered that the University of California system recently reported record high enrollments , suggesting that higher fees have not dissuaded students there .</TEXT>
