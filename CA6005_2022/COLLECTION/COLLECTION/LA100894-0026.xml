   <HEADLINE> HAITIAN SENATE SENDS AMNESTY BILL TO ARISTIDE ; CARIBBEAN : LEGISLATION LEAVES QUESTION OF IMMUNITY FOR COUP PARTICIPANTS IN OUSTED PRESIDENT ' S HANDS . SO FAR , CEDRAS STAYS_PUT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Haitian Parliament completed work Friday on a limited bill renewing and slightly expanding the right of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to extend political amnesty to the military_forces that overthrew him three years ago . By a 9-1 vote , with one abstention , the Haitian Senate passed a bill already approved Thursday by the Chamber of Deputies . A copy of the provision was sent by fax to Aristide for his signature , and it will become law when it is published here Monday . The measure itself does not provide_for amnesty , nor does_it define who would be qualified . In fact , it leaves the question of political amnesty entirely to the discretion of Aristide , who has said frequently that he could not give immunity to anyone involved in the September , 1991 , coup who engaged in &quot; general &quot; or &quot; criminal actions. &quot; The new measure renews amnesty powers granted the Haitian president under two existing laws and contains language that appears to increase Aristide ' s latitude in exercising those powers . Under an accord brokered by former U.S. President Jimmy_Carter on Sept . 18 , the leaders of the military who overthrew Aristide agreed to give_up power upon passage of &quot; a general amnesty &quot; or by Oct . 15 , whichever comes first . Sources close to Haitian army commander Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras said after the Senate vote that the parliamentary action falls_short_of the Carter accord requirement and that he would not resign , at least not before Oct . 12 , the anniversary of his appointment as head of the military . Senior U.S. officials visiting here said they will consider the possibility of forcing Cedras to leave in the next few days on grounds that the Parliament ' s vote did meet the accord ' s criteria . * Another U.S. official indicated that the measure would be used as leverage to ensure that Cedras not only retires from the military quickly but that he leaves Haiti altogether . &quot; It is clear that we would like to see him leave the country , &quot; said yet another U.S. official . Meanwhile , U.S. Army teams , backed by tanks and mounted machine_guns , continued their disarmament program in Haiti . Acting on intelligence supplied by detained Cedras aide Jerry Murra , a large force raided the Citadelle Protection Agency , arresting five security_guards as suspected paramilitary members and confiscating four shotguns , an M-1 rifle , an Uzi submachine_gun and two pistols . It was clear the Army ' s ongoing crackdown on Haiti ' s paramilitary forces , in which more_than 80 suspected agents have been taken into custody , was paying_off . Throughout Friday , several pro-democracy demonstrations snarled traffic in the capital but passed without incident . With U.S. MPs heavily patrolling and protecting the route of the march , thousands of demonstrators cursed Haiti ' s generals and praised Aristide and the United States as they paraded through the same district where marchers in a similar pro-democracy rally were clubbed and shot at by civilian thugs a week ago . Some carried giant U.S. flags or portraits of the ousted president as they paused outside the Haitian army ' s headquarters to kick and spit on an effigy of Cedras . Dominique Baubrun summed_up the sentiment of many in the crowd at the end of the three-hour march . &quot; I ' m demonstrating for Aristide today , &quot; he said . &quot; I wasn ' t pro-Aristide before . But I spent four years doing nothing -- not working . Now I ' m convinced he ' s the only one who can save the country. &quot;</TEXT>
