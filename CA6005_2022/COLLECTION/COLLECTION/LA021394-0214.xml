   <HEADLINE> MOVIES ; DARKNESS AND LIGHT OVER TUSCANY ; FOR 40 YEARS , ITALY ' S TAVIANI BROTHERS HAVE DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO IDEALISTIC FABLES THAT SHED_LIGHT_ON DARKNESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Nostalgia doesn ' t interest us , but memory is a different matter , &quot; says Italian filmmaker Paolo Taviani , whose new movie , &quot; Fiorile , &quot; made in collaboration with his brother Vittorio , travels into the past to tell a rural Italian folk tale that they hope sheds some light on life in Italy today . &quot; Memory must be nurtured because coming_to grips with the past makes_it easier to decipher the reality we live_in now. &quot; &quot; ' Fiorile ' pivots on the idea that we must pay_for the sins of our ancestors , and beliefs of this sort are typical of folk tales , &quot; adds Vittorio Taviani of the film , which opens Wednesday , &quot; but I believe the will of man can be stronger than any curse. &quot; An unabashedly idealistic film , &quot; Fiorile &quot; -- like all_the Tavianis ' work -- is infused with issues of class_struggle , and juxtaposes the stately rubble of the past against utopian visions of the future . Acknowledging the politically charged Italian Neorealist school of the ' 40s and ' 50s as the main influence on their work , the Tavianis expand on the stark Neorealist tradition by dressing it up with theatrical metaphors often drawn from history . However , the populist beliefs central to Neorealism remain at the heart of their work . Though &quot; Fiorile &quot; was recently dismissed by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane as being &quot; flawed with a rather broad streak of ideological sentimentality , &quot; the Tavianis ' idealism is viewed by many as the great strength of their work , and it ' s something for which they make no apologies . &quot; There are two forces at_work in this film , &quot; says Paolo , speaking through an interpreter during an interview at a Hollywood hotel , &quot; and it moves through the clash between these two energies ; there ' s the negative force of gold , and the force of those who oppose it in the name of love . And we ' re not just speaking here of the love between a man and a woman , although that ' s an important part of the film ; we refer also to the love of the idea of a different and better world . For Jean , the young hero who appears early in the film , the memory of the principles of fraternity and justice is very prominent in his mind , and this memory represents another kind of love. &quot; The same could be said of the Tavianis , who were born in San Miniato , Italy ( Vittorio in 1929 , Paolo in 1931 ) . The sons of a lawyer who rejected the Catholicism that dominated Italy at the time in favor of more liberal ideas , the Tavianis ' early_childhood was cultured and relatively idyllic . &quot; Our first experience with the spectacle of entertainment wasn ' t film -- it was the dramas of Verdi and Puccini , &quot; Vittorio recalls . &quot; As children , if we did_well in school , our father would reward us with a trip to Florence to see an opera . I can remember seeing the red stage curtain go_up and suddenly a torrent of emotion would be unleashed before my eyes -- it thrilled us completely , and when we returned to our little town we ' d dress_up in rags and play_out our child ' s version of what we ' d just experienced. &quot; While in their early teens , the Tavianis ' lives were disrupted when World_War_II descended on their small village in 1944 . Their memory of the destruction wrought_on the village by the Nazis was to be the subject of their most critically acclaimed film to date , &quot; The Night of the Shooting Stars. &quot; The seeds for that film , however , were planted in 1946 when they had an experience that was to change their lives . &quot; When we were teen-agers , just by chance we happened into a movie_theater , &quot; Paolo recalls . &quot; Several people were leaving as we were going_in and they told us , ' Forget it , it ' s a really boring film , ' but we went_in anyway and found ourselves confronted on the screen by the war exactly as we ' d lived it just a_few years before . The film was Roberto Rossellini ' s ' Paisan , ' and seeing it made us realize that through art we can gain an understanding of our experiences that ' s greater than what we derive from living them directly . By the time we left the theater we ' d decided to dedicate our lives to making movies . Living_in the provinces as we did , we knew this was going_to be hard -- we were the sons of a lawyer so we were expected to be lawyers . Nonetheless , we made a pact that for 10 years we ' d try to make movies , and if in 10 years we hadn ' t succeeded , we ' d kill ourselves ! &quot; &quot; So , we started writing_about film for trade papers , saw every film that came_through town , and saw lots of American movies , &quot; says Vittorio , picking_up the story . &quot; John Ford was the most important American director for us -- we were fascinated by the relationship he creates between his characters and the immense landscapes that surround them . Ford simultaneously exalts his characters and dwarfs them in their relationship to nature ; he seems to say that although what man knows is very important and wonderful , what he doesn ' t know is infinitely greater . &quot; When we were growing_up America seemed very far away , and we envisioned it as a place where strange technological things happened , &quot; he adds . &quot; I remember the first time we saw an American -- we ran_into two U.S. soldiers on a little country road who were part of an advance party , and they were brushing their teeth with their rifles slung over their shoulders . They seemed like creatures of great simplicity and strength , and it was like encountering an entirely new , oddly childish breed of people . It was wonderful -- American culture seemed so young. &quot; Completing their first film in 1954 , a short titled &quot; San Miniato , July 1944 , &quot; ( later to be expanded into &quot; Night of the Shooting Stars &quot; ) , the Tavianis went_on to release &quot; A Man for Burning &quot; in 1962 and &quot; The Marriage Outlaws &quot; in 1964 . They didn ' t begin to hit their stride until 1967 , however , with the release of &quot; The Subversives , &quot; which combined documentary footage of a prominent Communist leader ' s funeral with the stories of four people who are profoundly affected by his death . Two years later they completed &quot; Under the Sign of Scorpio , &quot; which was followed in 1971 by &quot; Saint Michael Had a Rooster , &quot; a tale of social conflict in Italy at the end of the 19th Century inspired by a Tolstoy story . The Tavianis didn ' t make_it to America until 1977 when their seventh feature , &quot; Padre Padrone , &quot; the tale of a young Sardinian who survives a traumatizing relationship with his domineering father , premiered at the New York Film Festival . &quot; I remember thinking that young New Yorkers would have a hard_time relating to our story of a poor shepherd who lives alone in his hut , &quot; recalls Vittorio Taviani of the film , which was their first to win an international audience . &quot; But after it was over , many young people came_up_to us and said , ' This man ' s loneliness in his little hut , and his need to communicate , are the same as our loneliness in our apartments. ' &quot; ( The Tavianis have made just one film in the United States : &quot; Good_Morning Babylon &quot; ( 1987 ) , the story of two Italian artisans who come_to America to work in the movies during the early days of Hollywood. ) The Tavianis have looked_to Italian fables for source material for the bulk of their films , and &quot; Fiorile , &quot; a romantic fable spanning several generations of an Italian family , has roots there as well . The film opens with a shot of a sleek automobile gliding down the highway through present-day Tuscany ; Luigi Benedetti ( played by Lino Capolicchio ) , his French wife ( Constanze Engelbrecht ) and their two children are en route to visit a reclusive grandfather the children have never met . From that simple beginning , the film time travels into the past and blossoms into a fable revolving around the idea that history repeats itself , and love and money are eternally at war . &quot; This is a story our mother used to tell us when we were children , and she heard it from her mother who heard it through her mother -- it was always through women that this particular story was told , &quot; Paolo points_out . &quot; This story supposedly took_place near our little village in Tuscany , in a peasant hamlet at the end of the 17th Century when Napoleon ' s troops passed_through the area . &quot; We were struck by this story when we were children , and we thought_of making a film based on it for many years , &quot; he continues . &quot; Two aspects of the story were compelling to us : the injustice of a young innocent who is killed , and the devastating force of money . This story returned to us quite vividly a_few years ago because Italy went_through a period in which the shadow of pervasive corruption was over us , and the stink of dirty money was in the air . The governing class had made power into a myth and was promoting the idea that the only thing that matters in life is getting_ahead and scratching_out your own share of power . &quot; We decided to try to throw a little light on this darkness by making a film based on this old tale about the devastating effects of money , and that ' s how the film was born . In making a film , we always begin with concrete realities that concern our personal lives , &quot; he adds , &quot; then we break from that concrete reality and throw ourselves into the great space of imagination and fantasy. &quot; The greatest bit of poetic_license the Tavianis grant themselves with &quot; Fiorile &quot; is in leap-frogging their story from one century to the next as it charts the star-crossed fortunes of the Benedetti family ; the linking device in all this episodic time travel is that car cruising through present-day Italy . &quot; One of the first images that came_to us when we began working_on the film was the idea of a car traveling from France to Tuscany , &quot; Vittorio says . &quot; We envisioned this car as a kind of spaceship or vehicle for time travel , like something out of a book by Jules Verne , and the car gave us the rhythm of the film , which is conceptually scored to the rhythm of a trip . &quot; The central challenge of this film was finding a way to combine several different characters and time_periods into a single story , and the car moving through time and space opens_up the idea of a story with various chapters that allow us to see the relationship between the past and the present . The children in the back seat of the car listen to their father speak , and through the eyes and ears of their imagination we see these chapters from the past come_to life. &quot; Reflecting on the oral tradition of folk fable central to much of the Tavianis ' work , one wonders what the fate of such stories will be as mass media gathers ever more steam . &quot; Cultural legacies always run the risk of being devoured by new means of communication , but there will always be people who struggle to defend these traditions , &quot; Paolo says . &quot; Moreover , a great anthropologist once said that the human_race has 33 narrative lines that are repeated one generation after the next , and what this means is that a story you might invent in L.A. today is probably based on an old story . The way you tell it might make_it modern , but its tie with the past is nonetheless present. &quot; In talking with the Tavianis , one is struck by the fact that they virtually never disagree when it comes_to the themes and ideological core of their work . One wonders , however , how this partnership actually functions on a set . &quot; It ' s often the case that several different people will work_on a screenplay , so that aspect of our collaboration isn ' t unusual , &quot; Vittorio says . &quot; When we ' re actually shooting , we simply divide the work in half . Say we have 10 set-ups to do_in a day -- Paolo will direct five , then I ' ll direct five , because the crew must have a single point_of_reference . &quot; By this point we ' ve developed an almost telepathic kind of communication and on the set all it takes is a look_to communicate that something isn ' t working , &quot; he continues . &quot; We ' re two very different characters when we play tennis , but when we ' re making films we ' re in perfect harmony . The creative relationship we share would be difficult if we were painters , but one of the unique things about film is that it ' s a collaborative form that requires many different forces to unite. &quot; &quot; Kurosawa has said that whenever he ' s shooting a film he keeps a copy of ' War and Peace ' on his night table , and every evening he reads a_few pages , and we do the same thing , &quot; adds Paolo in conclusion . &quot; Some people read the Bible -- we read Tolstoy . His wonderful writing makes us feel less alone , and reminds us that in other times , under other skies , man has sought the truth. &quot;</TEXT>
