   <HEADLINE> WHEN PIERCE SAYS ALLEZ , GRAF BIDS ADIEU TO STREAK ; FRENCH OPEN : AFTER 33 CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES IN GRAND_SLAM MATCHES , NO . 1 PLAYER FALLS IN PARIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steffi Graf ' s remarkable string of victories had to end . The winner of 33 consecutive matches in Grand_Slam events was seeking her fifth consecutive major title when the_French Open began last week , but it appeared there was no one to challenge her . Until Thursday . In an unimaginable turn of events , women ' s tennis was jolted when 12th-seeded Mary Pierce displayed a mastery of Graf seldom seen since Monica Seles was grunting her way to Grand_Slam tournament titles . Playing almost superhuman tennis , Pierce , 19 , swept aside top-ranked Graf in the semifinals at Roland Garros Stadium as if she were a first-round qualifier , 6-2 , 6-2 . Giving women ' s tennis an injection of freshness , Pierce will play in Saturday ' s final against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , who defeated Conchita Martinez , 6-3 , 6-1 , in an uninspired semifinal of Spanish clay-court specialists . Pierce , who lives_in Florida but is playing_out of France , particularly when in Paris , ended Graf ' s streak of having reached tournament finals at 20 . &quot; I didn ' t feel I was out there , &quot; said Graf , whose last defeat in a Grand_Slam event was inflicted by Sanchez Vicario in the quarterfinals of the 1992 U.S. Open . Graf wasn ' t out there long . Play lasted 1 hour 17 minutes , and about the only thing that seemed to slow Pierce was the weather . After breaking Graf for the second time in the second set , the match was postponed for 40 minutes because of a downpour . &quot; I really didn ' t want to stop , &quot; said Pierce , who lost in the fourth round of the last two French Opens_to Jennifer Capriati . &quot; ( It ) entered my mind that she was waiting for that. &quot; For a while , it was doubtful whether the women ' s semifinals would be played_at all . The roller-coaster weather had gone from cold to hot , to very hot , to humid , to thunderstorms during the week . But the sun poked through Thursday long enough for Pierce and Sanchez Vicario to make their marks . The rain delay gave Graf a moment to collect her thoughts and consider changing her strategy . Instead , she did nothing . &quot; I just changed clothes and waited , &quot; she said . Once the match resumed , Pierce needed only 12 more minutes of slam-bang tennis to call it a day . She has lost only 10 games in six matches , a tournament record , and is the first French woman to reach the final since Francoise Durr won the title in 1967 . Pierce , whose mother is French , is enjoying the adulation of French fans but seems to be having an identity_crisis . &quot; I don ' t really know if I am either-or , &quot; she said when asked if she were French or American . She was definitely feeling French on Thursday . Yelling &quot; Allez ! &quot; to herself when her potent ground_strokes hit the deep lines , the bilingual Pierce blew kisses to the appreciative Center Court crowd after the victory . &quot; I ' m very , very happy and a little shocked at the way I won so easily , &quot; Pierce said . Graf was surprised , too . Although she had not played well in reaching the semifinals , she is so dominant that most opponents celebrate a moral victory when winning a set against her . Pierce had not been challenged in her blitzkrieg to the semifinals , and many thought her flawless game would crumble under the pressure of the indomitable Graf . After all , she had beaten Pierce in straight sets_in their only previous encounters , both last year . But Boris Becker , who has become a good friend , told Pierce on the eve of her biggest match , &quot; If you think you are nervous , Steffi will be twice as nervous. &quot; Pierce was nervous , but kept smacking the ball as if it had been shot from a cannon . &quot; She had no chance to attack me because I was playing very deep , &quot; Pierce said . &quot; And I was changing the rhythm all_the time. &quot; The ease with which Graf was broken was the most surprising aspect of the match . Pierce showed from the opening moments that she was not intimidated , either by Graf or the idea of playing in her first Grand_Slam semifinal . She broke Graf for a 1-0 lead , and then did_it again to go_up , 3-0 and 5-1 . Graf could recall only a_few other times when she faced such a devastating opponent . Even when losing to Seles , who has not played since she was stabbed during a tournament in Hamburg , Germany , in 1993 , Graf usually was not overwhelmed . Despite her disappointment , Graf realizes Pierce could revitalize women ' s tennis . &quot; It has definitely been very healthy , &quot; she said of Pierce ' s emergence as a force . &quot; I think it is a good thing . It is difficult for me to say that right now. &quot; By contrast , there was little tension in the Sanchez Vicario-Martinez match . Martinez , ranked No . 3 , lost her serve in the first game and went downward from there . Giving her Barcelona rival a chance to win the_French Open again , Martinez made 48 unforced errors in 72 minutes . No . 2 Sanchez Vicario , who won here as a 17-year-old in 1989 , has defeated Martinez five times in six meetings . But Martinez will get a big assist for this one . &quot; The whole match was unforced errors , &quot; Martinez said . &quot; It was all my mistakes . She was just putting the ball in the court. &quot;</TEXT>
