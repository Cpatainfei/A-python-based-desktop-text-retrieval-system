   <HEADLINE> THE SUNDAY PROFILE ; THE VIEW_FINDER ; HE HAS SEEN THINGS AND GONE PLACES NO OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS DARED . BUT HOWARD BINGHAM ' S BEST SHOTS HIT VERY CLOSE TO HOME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Howard Bingham is chatting easily through his power lunch , explaining between mouthfuls how he goes_about snagging the photos that have eluded some of his peers . He is not at Morton ' s , enjoying an icy martini as he destroys a filet_mignon and Caesar_salad . Nor is he perched on a leather booth at Maple Drive , noshing on homemade turkey sausages washed_down with an interesting little Chardonnay . Instead , he is hurtling south on the Harbor Freeway -- well above the posted speed_limit -- crunching on a taquito swimming in a lethal salsa verde and taking gulps of Snapple from a bottle clenched between his knees . Not a drop spills on his handmade ostrich-skin cowboy_boots , which , despite their beat-up appearance , cost more_than many middle managers make in a week . That lunch says a lot about how Bingham sees himself and his work . He is a homeboy who has done_well and who is still firmly attached_to his home_in southeast Los Angeles . Although he has documented the glamorous and famous , Bingham ' s eye wanders to the undocumented parts of the city , to the people who often serve lunch rather than &quot; do &quot; it . For more_than 35 years , he has captured African American life here , doing his work with an unobtrusiveness that has become his trademark . &quot; I can ' t recall exactly when I met him , &quot; former Mayor Tom Bradley says with a shrug , &quot; he was just there . . . . &quot; His face may seem naggingly familiar , his name may or may_not register , but Bingham ' s photographs garner instant recognition : an elegantly glowering Huey P . Newton , the former ( and very late ) chairman of the Black Panther Party , surrounded by party faithful ; black Angelenos shouting at tense , weapon-brandishing LAPD officers ; Muhammad Ali , glistening with sweat , after championship bouts in Miami , Zaire , Manila ; Bill Cosby mugging for his Kodak ads ; Robert Redford on his illuminated steed as the Electric Horseman . Bingham ' s photo files are too disorganized to be called archives . Still , as drawer upon drawer of his filing_cabinet opens , pieces of forgotten local history come_forward . Here is former Peace Corps Director Sargent Shriver ( father of Maria , father-in-law of Conan the Republican ) cutting the ribbon that opened the Watts Family Health Center_on Compton and 103rd during the Watts Festival , once an annual cultural celebration . In his summer suit and boutonniere , Shriver looks_like a benevolent colonial come , from the mother_country , to inspect the natives . Here are Burt Lancaster , Marlon Brando , Sammy Davis Jr . and James Brown , all young and slim and frightfully earnest , sharing a dais at a Hollywood fund-raiser for Mississippi Freedom Riders . And a dashiki-clad Maulana Karenga , book-ended by look-alike security_guards , addressing mourners at the Coliseum in April , 1968 , after the Rev . Martin_Luther_King Jr . was assassinated . And , a year or so later , an almost willowy former opera student named Coretta Scott King in solo concert at Second Baptist_Church . Budd Schulberg instructing his proteges at the Watts Writers ' Workshop . The eerily pristine Watts Towers , without scaffolding . Malcolm X , as agog as any other fan , leaning_back to snap a photo of Muhammad Ali at a Miami lunch counter . Although he has lived here nearly all_of his life , Bingham was born in Jackson , Miss. , in 1939 , the first of seven children . His parents , the Rev . Willie E . Bingham Jr . and Willie Emmaline Bingham , sought to escape the suffocating weight of segregation and struck_out for a new beginning in the West . The family settled near 49th and Hooper but soon moved_out to Imperial Highway , a bucolic place where young Howard and his friends could finish their chores and fish in a nearby canal surrounded by tall grass meadows . &quot; We lived one block east of Central , right on the canal -- we used to catch crayfish down there , &quot; Bingham says . &quot; The canal ' s still there , but it ' s all concrete now. &quot; The neighborhood contained a little bit of every ethnicity and was a world unto itself . &quot; There was a mom-and-pop store run_by a Mexican couple_on the corner ; we had an account there , &quot; Bingham recalls . &quot; And on the next corner was a drive-in. &quot; The Bingham children rode the Red Car to San Pedro , Long_Beach and Downtown . &quot; We had a bus_line -- the Southern California Transportation_Company -- that would take you anywhere . You could go_to Compton or Huntington Park for a dime. &quot; Their parents didn ' t worry , partly because they were quite clear on the consequences of &quot; acting_out &quot; -- the Rev . Bingham was a strict disciplinarian -- and partly because the streets were safe . * Bingham attended Compton public_schools , graduating in Centennial High ' s second_class in 1956 . Several classmates went_on to successful athletic careers : Roy White with the Yankees , Bobby Thompson as a New York Giant , Reggie Smith with the Dodgers and Charlie Dumas as a world-class high-jumper . He enrolled in Compton Junior_College and started to have fun . Fun , of the social sort , had been forbidden in the reverend ' s strict household . &quot; To this day , I don ' t know how to dance , &quot; Bingham says with a laugh . &quot; My parents didn ' t allow it. &quot; But his considerable charm compensated for a lack of motor skills , and to his amazed delight the college ladies favored him -- despite a machine-gun stutter . &quot; They don ' t know why I do_it , &quot; he says . &quot; One doctor told my mother it was because I kept too_much in when I was a kid . But in my father ' s house , you watched what you said if you didn ' t want to get whupped. &quot; His new social life was wonderful but threatened to torpedo his academic status . &quot; I was actually a music major . I ' d taken piano and could play the violin . As a child , I ' d been told I had a gift for music , but , &quot; Bingham says sheepishly , &quot; I lost interest in it because I always had to practice while other kids were out playing football. &quot; He left college , where he had failed a photography course , and went looking_for work . He found it at Vons , mopping_up and moving stock . After two years , it dawned on him that it was useless to aspire to bagging or checking , &quot; because black folks didn ' t have those kinds of jobs back then. &quot; Bingham decided to do what he most wanted . &quot; A couple of my neighbors were photographers , La Vern and Myron Hodson , so I ' d go_over there and watch them work. &quot; It wasn ' t the picture-taking that he found so attractive : &quot; I liked their ( modus_operandi ) -- they always had girls over the house , for photo contests. &quot; After appearing at the door of the Los Angeles Sentinel for a solid week to beg for work , photo editor Cliff Hall took pity on Bingham and allowed him to observe . ( &quot; He told me ' Come_in -- but don ' t touch anything ! ' &quot; ) A week later , Hall consented to inquire whether Bingham might be hired . To their mutual surprise , management agreed . &quot; I went_off on jobs , came_back with underexposed film , blurred film , no film -- and I always had an excuse for what went_wrong , &quot; Bingham says of his early on-the-job training . Under Hall ' s guidance , Bingham ' s photos improved and were reproduced regularly , and he spent much of his time chronicling the daily life of black Los Angeles . Meanwhile , private clients wanted the photographer to capture weddings , church functions and other social_events ignored by the mainstream press . ( &quot; Black folk made very infrequent appearances in the ( regular ) paper , unless the crime was big-time and / or against whites. &quot; ) Moonlighting increasingly interfered with his day job , and the Sentinel ultimately fired Bingham 18 months after hiring him . &quot; I was devastated at first , &quot; Bingham admits , &quot; but actually , in retrospect , it was the best thing in the world that could have happened to me . Because if I ' d stayed_at the Sentinel , I never would have done half the things I ' ve done since then. &quot; Such_as documenting the career of his best_friend , Muhammad Ali . * Bingham met Cassius Marcellus Clay when the Sentinel assigned him to cover the sleek young fighter ' s bout with George Logan at the Sports Arena . Driving down Broadway , near 5th , a_few hours after the fight , he spotted Clay and his brother hanging_around , soaking_up the ambience of a city much larger than their Louisville , Ky. , hometown . &quot; I pulled over and asked them what they were doing , and they said , ' Looking_at girls. ' I told them I could drive them around , show them a little L.A. , but they ' d have to come_with me while I did some errands first. &quot; The two young_men hopped into Bingham ' s car and saw such exotic sights as his photo lab and a Compton bowling_alley before he took them to see black Los Angeles and finally to his mother ' s for a meal . By day ' s end , a rapport that would strengthen and deepen over the years had been established . Whenever the boxer was in town , he tagged_along with the photographer . Bingham photographed Clay ' s rise and metamorphosis into Muhammad Ali while also covering the burgeoning unrest in America ' s cities . But when Watts imploded in 1965 , he was out of the country . &quot; In Sweden , with Ali , &quot; he says , shaking his head . &quot; Here we were , surrounded by white people , while L.A. was burning_up . . . . &quot; A few months later , a second &quot; mini-riot &quot; broke_out . Jordan Bonfante , then Life magazine ' s L.A. bureau chief , caught Bingham at_home and asked him to shoot . &quot; They ' d sent all_the white photographers down there that evening , but the next week , they only ran my photos , &quot; Bingham says . And they were some photos . His shots of a weapons cache -- rifles , handguns and ammunition neatly aligned on a yellow towel -- were an exclusive peek into the explosive potential of angry teen-agers . &quot; The rioters knew I was with Life , &quot; Bingham recalls , &quot; and in_order to help me , they took me to where their ammo was stashed . They knew I ' d not tell_on them. &quot; &quot; He became a fixture free-lancer after that , &quot; says Bonfante , now L.A. bureau chief for Time magazine . &quot; Some people fussed about those photos when they were published , &quot; says Danny Bakewell , Brotherhood Crusade president and an old friend of Bingham . &quot; They thought Howard should have turned those brothers in to the police . But Howard was able to get those pictures because he didn ' t violate press ethics -- but he didn ' t violate the brother-in-the-street ' s ethics , either. &quot; Because of such unusual access , Life put Bingham on summer retainer . He crisscrossed the country , covering urban uprisings in Buffalo , N.Y. ; Bakersfield , and San Francisco . ( &quot; Have riot , will travel , &quot; he says with a grin. ) * Things got more grim the next summer in Detroit . &quot; It was wild , bullets everywhere . I didn ' t know if we were going_to get_out alive , &quot; Bingham recalls . &quot; I got_on the floor of my hotel ( room ) , called my mother and Jordan Bonfante , &quot; and prayed until dawn -- &quot; when I got the hell out of there. &quot; That was Bingham ' s last riot . &quot; I got tired_of war duty , &quot; he says . In 1968 , he went_to Chicago to cover the Democratic National Convention . Thinking_back on the vicious police beatings of anti-war protesters there , his face hardens : &quot; I always say that if I had had a gun that night , I would n ' t have minded going_to jail. &quot; Those photos were also widely circulated in Life , and Bingham became the second black contract photographer , after Gordon Parks , in the magazine ' s history . He brought_back a graphically stark portrayal of the Mississippi Delta ' s black poor . And , closer to home , chronicled the rise of the Black Panther Party . The Panthers allowed the photographer and writer Gilbert Moore unprecedented access for a story that Life ultimately chose not to run . ( &quot; It scared them , &quot; Bingham says. ) But the weeks-long project became &quot; A Special Rage , &quot; a book in which Moore wryly describes how Bingham almost blew it on their first day with the group in Berkeley : &quot; You not taking no pictures in here -- mother------ , &quot; a voice behind us said . We spun_around to confront another Panther . He couldn ' t have been more_than eighteen , but his voice had all_of the raspy authority of an Army master_sergeant . Howard whipped out his press credentials . In his haste to show that he was &quot; clean , &quot; his hand obscured half of the press pass . The visible portion read : &quot; Los Angeles Police Department. &quot; The Panther was astonished . &quot; You a pig ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Now I know you not takin ' no pictures ' round here. &quot; They were saved by Bobby Seale -- a Panther and the only black member of the infamous Chicago Seven -- who vouched for them and went_on to give them a valuable piece of advice : &quot; If you cats are gonna be taking pictures , better watch your step . These brothers are not playin ' . &quot; * Bingham ' s dealings with such groups as the Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam might have blocked his entree into other , more mainstream venues . It hasn ' t . A.S. Doc Young , the grand old columnist of the Sentinel , credits Bingham ' s affability . &quot; He ' s genuinely a nice person . You cannot find anybody to say bad things about him . Really , it ' s miraculous , because for all_of his loyalty to Ali , for instance , he never got drawn into the controversy surrounding the Black Muslims . So he could be close to Ali , Elijah Muhammad , even Malcolm X at a time when to associate with Black Muslims , you were shunned by the media. &quot; Nor has he been touched by the tawdry side of boxing . &quot; People who may be_on the fringes of that other world would never think_of Howard doing wrong , or asking him to , &quot; former Mayor Bradley says . &quot; He ' s just accepted as part of the club for who he is. &quot; And who he is still very much the reverend ' s son . He is unfailingly polite to virtually everyone . Calls to check on the neighborhood old folks . Visits his mother , who was widowed in 1985 , almost daily . Does not confuse legitimate black anger with wanton violence . ( &quot; Look , those guys who beat Reginald Denny , that verdict was a joke . They should be under the jail , in cells right next door to those cops who beat Rodney King . Both groups were wrong. &quot; ) Bingham ' s low-key personality , touted by Bill Cosby to network management , also helped him break_into the entertainment_industry . He became one of the first black members of Local 659 of the cameramen ' s union . He would later become one of the first black still photographers on a movie set , shooting such box-office successes as &quot; All the President ' s Men , &quot; &quot; The Electric Horseman &quot; and &quot; The Candidate. &quot; Between movie gigs , he continued to accompany Ali around the globe , acting_as an anchor in the boxer ' s turbulent personal life . A photograph taken near Boston in 1975 shows Ali with three attractive women . Standing slightly behind the fighter , linking arms , are his regal second wife , Belinda ; the woman who would soon be his third wife , Veronica Porche , and Lonnie Williams , the shy , freckled young Louisville neighbor who would become his fourth wife . &quot; Be sure to say ' his fourth and last wife , ' &quot; Lonnie Ali says with a laugh while trying to dress wiggle-worm Assad , the couple ' s 3-year-old son . &quot; Howard often tells me , ' I was here before you , and I ' ll be here after you go. ' He was laughing when he said it , but he wasn ' t kidding. &quot; Bingham married only once , to Carolyn Turner , with whom he has two sons , Dustin and Damon . The marriage succumbed after 14 years to Bingham ' s single-minded focus_on his work . &quot; Look , this was his way_out of Compton , and it took him around the world , &quot; says Regina Jones , a longtime friend who is fond of both Binghams . &quot; Howard saw his work as his only means of caring for his family . And it took him away a lot , which , to a wife , doesn ' t feel very good. &quot; Damon , 21 , lives with his dad and manages a rap_group . Seventeen-year-old Dustin is in Redlands with his mother but often spends weekends with Dad . The kids seem unfazed by their father ' s connections , and for good reason : A family photo shows infant Damon carefully cradled in one of Ali ' s arms , while the other shakes a mock fist at him . A huge pastel portrait of Dustin by LeRoy Neiman hangs over the fireplace ( &quot; to -- and for -- Dustin &quot; ) . They both have closetfuls of boxing mementos . * Howard Bingham ' s trip from his modest stucco bungalow in southeast L.A. to the exotic wood-paneled private planes of the glitterati doesn ' t mystify anyone who knows him well . &quot; He ' s personable and very funny , and this has given him entree everywhere , &quot; Time magazine ' s Bonfante says . &quot; Doors fly_open before him . With all sorts of people. &quot; &quot; Howard , &quot; explains Nashville , Tenn. , businessman and political operative John Jay Hooker , &quot; is the world ' s best professional guest . There ' s nobody who has more dignity and worthwhileness. &quot; And he has remained , in the words of former Life reporter Gil Moore , &quot; jes ' plain folks. &quot; &quot; The average person who has achieved what Howard has achieved would normally not be living_in his neighborhood , &quot; agrees the Sentinel ' s Young . &quot; They ' d be in the Hollywood Hills or Beverly Hills somewhere. &quot; Bingham doesn ' t see the point . &quot; I have always lived south of Imperial , &quot; he says with pride . &quot; It makes me crazy when they call everything south of Wilshire South-Central . All of black L.A. ain ' t South Central . And Watts is one mile by one mile. &quot; That sense of community fueled Bingham ' s quixotic run_for Congress in 1978 . &quot; He did_it because he genuinely wanted to use his connections to help his neighborhood , &quot; Bradley says , &quot; but he hadn ' t given careful thought to the enormity of the House campaign -- fund raising , the necessity of getting the message out , things like that. &quot; In retrospect , Bingham is amused at his own naivete . He organized a fund-raiser with an all-star roster ( friends Marvin Gaye , Richard Pryor , Redd Foxx , Barry White , Louis Gossett and Sammy Davis Jr . came_to help ) , but neglected to delegate such critical details as publicity . &quot; Nobody came . Instead of financing my campaign , I went_deep into the hole -- but the party afterward was fantastic ! &quot; * With the publication last fall of &quot; Muhammad Ali : A Thirty-Year Journey &quot; ( Simon &amp; Schuster ) , Bingham has achieved a longtime goal : Here , finally , is the fruit of three decades of travel and friendship with the person he knows best . ( Ali , in turn , says he has been blessed with Bingham ' s friendship . &quot; We met in Los Angeles in 1962 , and we ' ve been friends ever since. &quot; ) That accomplished , might Bingham take some time_off ? &quot; I should , &quot; he murmurs , looking distractedly at his jumble of a living room , where plaques of appreciation are stacked vertically like storm_windows waiting to be hung . But there are a_few things to take_care of first . The phone rings constantly ; one day ' s backlog of messages is astonishing : Lonnie Ali , with whom he speaks several times daily ; Camille ( Mrs . Bill ) Cosby ; producer Scott ( &quot; The Firm &quot; ) Rudin ; television journalist Charlayne Hunter Gault ; Sen . Orrin Hatch ( Yes , that Orrin Hatch . &quot; He ' s a friend . When Anita Hill testified , I was in Washington , and he got me in and got me a good seat. &quot; ) ; Madonna ' s office ( &quot; She ' s a boxing fan. &quot; ) . And King Hussein would love for him and Ali to visit ; would that be possible ? All these messages , letters and faxes from power centers across the country and the world , and they land , not in the salt-misted Palisades or the cloistered wealth of Bel-Air . Instead , they land just shy of the Century Freeway , in a small house crammed with the detritus of a too-full life . Far east of La Cienega . Way south of the 10 . Mr. Bingham ' s neighborhood . Howard Bingham Age : 54 . Native : No . Born in Jackson , Miss. , lives in southeast L.A. Family : Divorced ; two sons . Passions : Chronicling the life of his community . Interests : Documenting the life of Muhammed Ali . On being the son of a minister and strict disciplinarian : &quot; To this day , I don ' t know how to dance . My parents didn ' t allow it. &quot; On starting work with no experience : &quot; I went_off on jobs , came_back with underexposed film , blurred film , no film -- and I always had an excuse for what went wrong. &quot; On covering the Detroit riot for Life : &quot; It was wild , bullets everywhere . I didn ' t know if we were going_to get_out alive. &quot; On keeping the same address : &quot; I have always lived south of Imperial . It makes me crazy when they call everything south of Wilshire South-Central . All of black L.A. ain ' t South-Central . And Watts is one mile by one mile. &quot; ( MORE )</TEXT>
