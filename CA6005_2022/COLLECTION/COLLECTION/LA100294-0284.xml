   <HEADLINE> THE LAW OF THE SCHOOL YARD ; JANE DOE , A PETALUMA STUDENT , STARTED A RUMOR THAT CAME BACK TO HAUNT HER . NOW SHE ' S AT THE CENTER OF A NATIONAL DEBATE OVER KIDS AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Jane Doe heard the smutty story , she acted like any normal sixth-grader : She giggled , got &quot; grossed_out &quot; and passed the rumor on to her friends . Then , in the fall she entered seventh grade , where she became the target of the very same rumor . Boys and girls from her Petaluma junior_high taunted her between class , during class , after school : &quot; Hey , I hear you had_sex with a hot dog &quot; or &quot; I wonder what kind of hot dog she prefers &quot; or just plain &quot; hot dog. &quot; The abuse made Jane grow_up fast , too fast . By the middle of eighth grade , she had stopped riding her bike to friends ' houses or designing dresses for her paper dolls , instead locking herself in her bedroom while she listened to Ugly Kid Joe belt_out &quot; I hate everything about you &quot; over and over . By then , her depression and anger had grown so deep , the only way her parents could think to rescue her was to relocate . They moved 30 miles up the highway , leaving_behind their schools , their friends , their church . When Richard Homrighouse first heard the hot dog rumor , from Jane and her father , he acted_as he believed a competent guidance counselor should : He listened sympathetically , told them the behavior was unacceptable , and warned one of the boys . Four years later , Homrighouse would find himself sitting before a legal reporter , racking his brain for every detail of that and other encounters with the straw-blond girl he had befriended in 1990 . What Homrighouse said or didn ' t say , did or didn ' t do , during his encounters with Jane Doe , as she is known to protect her anonymity , is at the heart of a lawsuit she has filed against Homrighouse and the Petaluma schools . Doe ' s lawyers say there is a name for the kind of bullying Jane endured : &quot; sexual harassment. &quot; And by failing to stop it , they contend , the school violated Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 . Terms such_as sexual_harassment are increasingly entering the lexicon of the schoolyard , and in this post-Anita Hill era , adults are hastily borrowing from their own experience to explain -- and cope_with -- childhood breaches of civil behavior . We know that sexual language and innuendo are common to children , particularly junior_high students as they stumble awkwardly into puberty . The question is : Should we be using legal_action , rather than families or school mediation and education , to try to socialize young people ? And what will happen if we do ? The Petaluma case has become a cause_celebre for feminist groups and could have far-reaching consequences on how educators address a discipline problem as old as co-ed schools . Ever since 1988 , when another Petaluma mother complained to the federal_government about her daughter ' s abuse , the U.S. Department_of_Education has quietly pressured school districts to treat tawdry teasing , even among elementary-school children , as illegal sexual_harassment . Defense_lawyers in the Doe case will challenge that practice , contending that the department broke its own rules when it construed Title IX , historically used to attain equity in girls ' sports programs and the_like , to outlaw schoolyard name-calling . Women ' s rights groups , meanwhile , see this issue as the latest front in their battle for gender equity . They hope the judge in the Doe case will clearly delineate a school ' s obligation to protect students from vulgar verbal assaults . The Education_Department ' s Office for Civil Rights &quot; has been investigating and resolving complaints but without clear guidance , &quot; says Ellen Vargyas , senior counsel at the National Women ' s Law Center . &quot; People at all levels are struggling with the issue . We know what the model is in employment . But we also know the workplace is different from schools. &quot; Feminist legal_experts like Vargyas contend that a school has an even broader obligation to stop harassment than an employer . If the court upholds that interpretation , school districts will rush to cover their legal backsides with policies designed to treat sexual teasing differently than other discipline problems . &quot; What responsibility do the schools have , versus the parents ? &quot; asks Scott N . Kivel , attorney for the Petaluma schools and formerly a school_principal . &quot; Are we trying to protect our children from every wrong ? If every offensive comment is going_to bring litigation , we ' re not giving children a sense of reality that they have to deal with these situations. &quot; Petaluma , the quiet farming-turned-bedroom community of 47 # 000 north of San Francisco , is typical of the towns across America where &quot; peer-on-peer sexual_harassment &quot; is being played_out . Gangs and guns in school are still remote , and , mostly , the kids here get_in trouble for alcohol and cigarettes and fights . What added_to the horror of last year ' s kidnaping and murder of local girl Polly Klaas was precisely the ordinariness of the place : Wide sidewalks and huge supermarkets and affordable houses in developments sprawling east of the 101 freeway . Even the town ' s underlying social drama seems almost quaint : Eastsiders newly ensconced in their tract houses feel they can ' t get a fair shake from an Establishment controlled by the westsiders living across the railroad_tracks , smug in their lovely Victorian homes and spending their old money in the antique stores now dotting Petaluma ' s vintage downtown . Kenilworth Junior_High , which Jane attended , is an eastsider school tucked under the shade of the freeway . Jane Doe ' s dad is a firefighter , and her mom worked as an office administrator until a bad back forced her to quit . The defense_attorneys want to portray Jane as an angry underachiever who has had to live_in the shadow of her older sister , a track_star and honor student . They question the motives of parents who hired an attorney to consider legal_action after reading about the earlier Petaluma case , which resulted in a $ 20 # 000 settlement -- an agreement , they hasten to add , that was made by the school ' s insurance_company without its consent . Doe ' s attorneys , meanwhile , depict Homrighouse as a middle-aged man who still subscribes to the outdated notion that &quot; boys will be boys. &quot; Feminist groups say Homrighouse , 53 , and his school are examples of how America ' s education Establishment has dropped the ball on sexual_harassment . &quot; Why did they throw their hands up_in_the_air and remain passive ? &quot; asks Doe attorney Maria Blanco , staff lawyer at San Francisco ' s Equal Rights Advocates . &quot; Or did they believe it was not that serious ? &quot; Doe ' s side faces an admittedly steep legal hill : Under an earlier ruling in the case , they must prove that the school intentionally discriminated against Jane because of her gender . They also must make a case that girls can sexually harass other girls , something Blanco says has already been established in the workplace . Jane ' s lawsuit focuses_on the behavior of boys , but it is clear from her own words that the most vicious bullies were the Kenilworth girls who wore Raiders jackets and too_much makeup and ran together as the tough crowd . &quot; The girls were more spiteful , &quot; Jane recalls , in an interview granted after much negotiation with her lawyers . &quot; If a girl wanted to get_into a fight with me , she ' d call me a ' hot dog ' or something like that. &quot; But her $ 1-million lawsuit could have implications far beyond any new legal ground it may hoe . Its mere filing poses troubling questions about how we should admonish childhood aggressors . Do we tell them their behavior is wrong , or that it is illegal ? What do we want to teach them about the role of the courts and the government in settling interpersonal disputes ? What will be the impact of attaching an adversarial adult label such_as &quot; sexual_harassment &quot; to broad categories of childhood behavior ? Are we helping our children connect across the gender divide , or are we drawing new battle_lines ? To the feminist attorneys and educators leading the crusade on schoolyard sexual_harassment , the issue presents a tempting opportunity to shape the behavior of boys before they turn_into abusive men . Nan Stein , project director at Wellesley College ' s Center for Research on Women , calls today ' s schools &quot; training grounds for domestic violence. &quot; There are plenty of horror stories for Stein to draw_on : the Spur Posse ' s game of sexual_conquests in Lakewood ; newspaper descriptions of &quot; whirlpooling &quot; in New York City pools , where boys surround girls to rip_off their bathing_suits ; the trial of boys in a New Jersey suburb accused of gang-raping a mentally disabled girl . The everyday sexual teasing that goes_on outside the glare of news cameras can be equally disturbing . First-graders on a bus in Minnesota shout about sexual acts they couldn ' t possibly understand . Fifth-graders in Missouri rub their penises through their pants to embarrass the girls . In Maryland , elementary-school girls try to kiss boys ' genitals ; the boys , in turn , jump_on the girls ' backs , crotches pressed against the girls ' buttocks , in a stunt called &quot; nutting. &quot; Teen-agers at an elite Los Angeles high_school use their computers to publish a newsletter filled with lurid descriptions of the supposed sexual habits of the popular female clique . In interviews with nearly a dozen parents and children around the country , a consistent story emerges : Watching a child tormented daily by peers , parents go_to the school for help . The discipline meted_out by school officials doesn ' t stop the abuse . The parents transfer their depressed child out of the school and into therapy . Increasingly , they then call_on the Education_Department ' s Office for Civil Rights to discipline the school district . As of 1993 , the office was investigating 78 cases of schoolyard sexual_harassment , up from 10 in 1988 , though some of those recent cases involved teachers accused of abusing children . Across the phone_lines , the voices of these parents and their children crack with anger and sadness . From Linda Wolfs in Iowa : &quot; I understand why she can ' t trust people . She ' s lost friends . It ' s just not fair . Jenny will be in therapy for a long time. &quot; From Mary DeRosa in Massachusetts , whose daughter had to finish her last two years of high_school at_home : &quot; It breaks your heart thinking what they go through. &quot; From Lisa Bye of Maryland , a junior high-schooler who was the target of a boy who grabbed at her shirt and crotch : &quot; I felt so sick and ashamed . My counselor said I should just get_on_with my life. &quot; &quot; We ' re beginning to realize this behavior is unacceptable and dangerous to females , &quot; says Diane K . Shrier , clinical professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at George_Washington University Medical_Center in Washington , D.C. She notes that research studies show girls have high self-esteem until adolescence , &quot; where you see increased depression and self-esteem problems . Some of that may very well have to do with how they are treated sexually. &quot; But before feminists and judges and lawmakers reach_into the adult arsenal of language and tools to combat the problem , it ' s important to keep a_few things in mind . First , the studies that purport to prove that sexual_harassment is rampant on schoolyards cast a wide net . The most widely quoted research , a 1993 survey of 1 # 632 eighth-to-11th grade students by the American Association of University Women , included dirty_jokes and gestures , spying in the showers and &quot; mooning &quot; alongside forced kissing , grabs or pulling_at clothes . In that report , 81 % of all students -- boys and girls -- reported that they had experienced sexual_harassment at least once in their school experience . But , says James Garbarino , director of Cornell University ' s Family Life Development Center , even as some adolescents are acting more abusively toward each other , others are treating the opposite sex in a spirit of casual egalitarianism . And John Schowalter , director of training at the Yale Child Study Center , sees the rise in peer-on-peer sexual_harassment cases as the fallout of an inevitable cultural change . &quot; Young_women are much more aware of their rights , of people trying to invade their space and person . They ' re much quicker to say : ' I ' m not going_to put_up with this. ' &quot; Second , the feminist groups pushing this issue usually portray the problem exclusively as another example of female oppression . As Jane Doe ' s case shows , though , the truth is more complex . In the AAUW survey , nearly as_many boys ( 76 % ) as girls ( 85 % ) reported being harassed , and girls were commonly the accused . At its root , sexual_harassment is about the abuse of power . But it ' s not clear whether that should apply to the schoolyard . &quot; Sexual harassment has a power differential , an exploitative component , &quot; says Celia B . Fisher , director of the graduate program in developmental_psychology at Fordham University and a paid expert witness for the defense in the Jane Doe case . &quot; It ' s difficult to see the power differential between a 13-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl , &quot; she continues . &quot; Boys do not have more power . Adolescent boys are just as insecure as girls . There is no evidence that girls see boys in a more powerful position. &quot; Third , research suggests that this is a normal , if ugly , stage of development . The AAUW survey found that first incidents of sexual_harassment peaked in the seventh grade , a year when pimple-faced students are awkwardly discovering and testing their own sexuality and , not surprisingly , the year that Jane Doe ' s torment began . Academic surveys show that bullying in_general drops_off dramatically after age 12 or 13 . Children tease and flirt and touch and fight -- all behaviors widely considered off-limits in the workplace . And even the teasing has shades of meaning . A child may be experimenting with new sexual language or awkwardly expressing interest in someone or being cruel , researchers say . Brad Brown , professor of educational psychology at the University of Wisconsin , says that sexual teasing is particularly prevalent among junior high-schoolers because they have just emerged from late elementary_school , a period where children have a strong tendency to segregate themselves by gender . &quot; One important task of that ( junior_high ) age is to reacquaint oneself with the opposite sex , &quot; Brown says . Teasing at this age , he adds , is &quot; clumsy . They don ' t know how to be playful , rather than hurtful. &quot; A child ' s perspective on the impact of that name-calling , researchers say , isn ' t fully developed until late adolescence . All of this nuance is lost on the Education_Department ' s staff , which , after all , is paid to write and enforce regulations , not analyze child development theory . Officials at the department ' s Office for Civil Rights see more similarities than differences between the workplace and schools . &quot; In employment , victims of harassment complain of lost income , lost promotion opportunities and unfair working conditions , &quot; says Norma V . Cantu , President Clinton ' s assistant secretary for civil_rights . &quot; In education , victims complain of hostility , inability to concentrate , poor grades , depression . So the stakes are very high . The control by the ( school ) administration is identical to the control in the workplace . You are in a controlled classroom setting where there are disciplinary practices in place to create an environment where students can learn . The administration has been held responsible_for what happens within the four walls of the classroom , just like the employer is responsible_for how the employees are treated. &quot; Before the words &quot; sexual_harassment &quot; entered any school district ' s vocabulary , many schools were guilty of ignoring this kind of behavior . But others treated it as they would any other discipline problem : with warnings , written apologies , detention and suspension . Now schools , responding to pressure from the Education_Department and women ' s groups , are putting this behavior in a separate category . Off-limits to most school officials in this charged political environment are such common strategies as mediation efforts ( a victim shouldn ' t have to face her abuser ) and dress codes ( that would suggest the school is blaming the victim ) . There is also an emphasis on punishing the abuser , even though many researchers say it is far more effective to first educate children about the hurt they are inflicting . Even among some feminists leading this charge , there is deep concern about courts and legislatures applying an adult standard to children -- particularly when it doesn ' t take_into_account age and childhood development . Wellesley ' s Stein employs terms such_as &quot; bullying &quot; and &quot; teasing &quot; in the curriculum she is designing for elementary_schools , reserving the words &quot; sexual_harassment &quot; for junior_high and above . And , notes Eleanor Linn , associate director of programs for educational opportunity at the University of Michigan and a paid expert witness for Jane Doe ' s side , education efforts should be cautious about branding misbehaving children as criminals because of the frightening images the word &quot; illegal &quot; would conjure_up in the mind of a young child . But the agencies and legislatures now drawing_the_lines on schoolyard sexual_harassment have never been particularly adept at subtle distinctions . A 1993 California law permits children as young as the fourth grade to be suspended or expelled for sexual_harassment . And the Office for Civil Rights operates under the assumption that all sexually explicit taunting is sexual_harassment , regardless of the age . When elementary_school boys on a bus in Eden Prairie , Minn. , hurled dirty words at the girls , school officials employed the usual artillery of discipline -- detention , suspension and transferring a student to another bus . But an Office for Civil Rights official called to town in 1992 to investigate concluded these actions weren ' t enough : The matter should have been handled as &quot; sexual_harassment , &quot; adhering to the procedures and disciplines set_forth under the district ' s own policies . At the federal level , Jane Doe ' s lawyers saw an opening for a lawsuit in 1992 when the Supreme Court ruled that students could seek damages from schools under Title IX . Kim Jamieson , deputy superintendent of the Petaluma City School District , contends that these cases could be financially devastating for struggling schools . But Ruth Jones , a staff attorney for the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund and one of Doe ' s volunteer lawyers , sees lawsuits against schools and their officials as a necessary evil : &quot; I feel really strongly that girls have a right to go_to school without this happening . The way we establish the rules and lines of behavior is by litigation. &quot; With its shifting alliances , power struggles and raw brutality , the seventh grade world that spawned Jane Doe ' s lawsuit is complex and subtly savage . A 12-year-old can be summarily exiled for crimes not apparent to the adults in her life , teased and tormented mercilessly while her parents look helplessly on . It ' s unclear even to Jane why she became the target of the hot dog rumor . She didn ' t develop early . She wasn ' t a slow student . She ' s always had lots of friends . One former Kenilworth student said in a deposition that Jane became a target simply because she had started the rumor about someone else the year before . In her deposition , Jane acknowledged hearing the rumor from an out-of-state friend and passing it on to her girlfriends . Photos from that period , on the upstairs bureau of the Doe ' s new red-tile-roof house to the north of Petaluma , show a petite blond girl with a wide smile . The rebellious James Dean posters plastered in her room are softened by the surrounding dried flower bouquets , mementos from her dance performances in high_school musicals . The story the walls don ' t tell is that , like any family , Jane ' s has had its share of internal strife -- marital and other conflicts that led to family therapy when Jane was in sixth grade , fights with her parents that once prompted Jane to leave home and stay with a friend overnight . All of these sensitive details are now the prerogative of lawyers who have license to pick_over Jane ' s family life like hungry gulls . The girl who opens the door this August morning is a matured version of the thin 12-year-old her mother pointed_out in a photo the week before . At 16 , she ' s 5-foot-6 , with the curves of a grown woman and the same pretty , wide- brimmed face of a Midwestern farm_girl under her blond bangs . As Jane settles into the BarcaLounger , curling her stockinged feet under her jeans , two personality traits begin to emerge . The first is the tough , nonchalant exterior she has so carefully constructed . The previous week , Jane ' s mother had described her daughter well : &quot; She ' s very strong willed . You never have to guess what she ' s thinking , and yet she ' s this really soft person inside who gets her feelings hurt easily. &quot; On this day , Jane ' s responses to questions about the teasing and taunts she endured are languid : &quot; I didn ' t care ' cause he was a jerk anyway , &quot; she says of one incident . Only toward the end of the interview does she hint at her level of depression during that period . In describing an encounter with a friend at church camp , she says : &quot; I was having a hard_time because everyone in my group was feeling like God is there for you , that He feels everything . But I had a really hard_time with that because I didn ' t think that if He could feel all_the pain I was going_through , He would have kept me at Kenilworth. &quot; The second trait is her exceptionally strong streak of distrust toward the adults in her life : Her mother , her therapists , her attorneys . &quot; I don ' t believe_in counseling . I think it ' s stupid , &quot; she says at one point . &quot; There ' s something about people being paid to listen to me , it doesn ' t comfort me. &quot; Later , she says she found the deposition process good sport , saying she enjoyed playing &quot; mind games &quot; with the opposing attorney . &quot; I would make sarcastic retorts , and he would turn and do_it back to me , except he was getting really mad and I wasn ' t , &quot; she says . &quot; I guess it ' s kinda mean , but I ' m glad I did it. &quot; Jane ' s troubles started in the fall of seventh grade , when a boy came_up_to her and said , &quot; Hey , I hear you have a hot dog in your pants. &quot; Shortly after , another boy made the same comment . When she realized that she had become the target of the hot dog rumor , she told Homrighouse , and one of the boys involved was warned . Although the boys were the first to start the name- calling , girls would use the hot dog taunts as a way to try to provoke Jane into physical fights . Jane complained to Homrighouse about a girl who was threatening her . The following year the school suspended another girl who slapped Jane in the face while she was waiting in_line for her yearbook . When the harassment was at its peak , Jane says she was most afraid of riding her bike past one particular girl ' s house : &quot; She was just psycho . She ' d harass me . She was just mean. &quot; Much of the court ' s decision in the case is likely to turn_on contested facts about how often Jane actually sought help . Jane says she complained to Homrighouse as_many as two to three times a week during this period , and that the counselor -- concerned about her plight -- allowed her and her friends to eat lunch in a school office so they would n ' t be bothered . One of the defense ' s child development expert says that Homrighouse took an appropriately &quot; holistic &quot; view of Jane ' s problems , disciplining provocateurs when necessary but also working_on Jane ' s self-esteem and continued conflicts with both teachers and peers . Homrighouse , who declined to be interviewed for this story , recalled in depositions that during the seventh grade , he met with Jane about the hot dog rumors only once -- which resulted in the warning . In other meetings with Jane , he says , they discussed her conflicts with a girl , problems with a history teacher and his recommendation that she attend a self-esteem-boosting leadership camp . He says he doesn ' t recall allowing Jane to eat lunch in the school office . When Jane entered the eighth grade , she came_to him to discuss the stress she was enduring because of the hot dog rumor , Homrighouse recalled . He told her at the time that the behavior constituted illegal sexual_harassment and added that as a counselor , he was not authorized to suspend students , though he described alternative punishments . He stressed that Jane hadn ' t provided the names of any students and seemed mostly to want to talk to someone about it . &quot; My understanding was that since I had invited her to return and she hadn ' t , then ( the teasing ) had stopped , &quot; Homrighouse added . The Does -- particularly Jane -- had viewed Homrighouse as a friend and ally , but gradually changed their minds . &quot; He acts like a very concerned person , &quot; says Jane ' s mother . &quot; But you walk_out the door and forget it -- he doesn ' t have time. ' &quot; The school ' s attorneys respond that if Jane was so miserable , she and her parents should have immediately taken their case to the assistant principal , Linda Noll , who was in_charge of both discipline and Title IX . Jane knew that Noll was the school disciplinarian , but says she was more comfortable with the more amicable counselor . She adds in her deposition : &quot; I thought_of it more as whenever people got_into fights , they were sent to Mrs . Noll. &quot; In any case , once Noll did get involved -- during the second semester of Jane ' s eighth-grade year -- heads began to roll . Noll suspended the girl who slapped Jane . Later , she suspended a boy who stood_up in class and asked Jane why she had had_sex with a hot dog . The day after that incident , Jane ' s father marched into the school , met with the principal , vice principal and Homrighouse , and demanded that they put an end to the abuse . By then , Jane was deeply distraught . She didn ' t want to go_to school , or even leave the house , and got_into angry fights with her mother , saying she wanted out of Kenilworth -- and Petaluma . &quot; She ' d have screaming fits , &quot; recalls her mother . &quot; She refused to go_to school in the morning . I was the bad_guy because I made her go_to school . Our relationship just kind of fell_apart at that point . She realized we would n ' t move , we would n ' t take her out of school . In her eyes , we weren ' t doing anything to help her. &quot; The last straw came just one week after Jane ' s father met with school officials . Jane was eating her lunch when a new girl at school demanded they make a date to fight after school . When Jane refused , the girl and her friends began obscene name-calling . A playground supervisor rescued Jane , who was taken_to Noll ' s office . &quot; After that last incident , she just said , ' I can ' t stay here anymore , Mom , ' &quot; Jane ' s mother recalls . &quot; I went and picked her up , and she fell_into my arms sobbing . I said , ' that ' s it , ' and I pulled her out that day. &quot; The following week , Jane was enrolled in a Santa Rosa school , 25 miles away . When that commute became untenable , and the harassment in their Petaluma neighborhood continued , the Does moved to a town half-an-hour north . Jane now attends a private high_school and says she ' s happy with her new life . &quot; I ' ve changed so_much in the past few years , &quot; she says as she describes with enthusiasm the church summer_camp that has helped her blossom . Then she laughs_at how her newfound confidence sometimes surprises her : &quot; I feel so well-rounded ! &quot; Her parents say the move was the best thing ever to happen to Jane , but they remain bitter that the school ' s unwillingness or inability to stop their daughter ' s torment forced them to uproot their family and incur the costs of private tuition and therapy . &quot; It was a big disruption in our lives , &quot; says her father . &quot; I ' m a basic person with real basic values . You can mess with me , but once you treat my wife or kids unfairly , then you have to deal with me , and we ' ll do_it through whatever legal avenues we have to do it. &quot; This story has a deeper history , and it can be found in the clutter of file boxes crammed inside Louise Brawdy ' s formal dining_room . Louise ' s daughter , Tawnya , attended eighth grade at Kenilworth Junior_High in 1987 . Her mother is convinced the experience almost killed her . The full-sized chest that Tawnya inherited from her mother came early in puberty . Tawnya was also a special_education student . To the school ' s insensitive jocks , that combination was irresistible . The chanting -- &quot; moo , moo &quot; -- began every morning and followed Tawnya throughout the day . &quot; Every day she would walk into the classroom , people would make obscene gestures , say disgusting things , mooing , &quot; recalls one girl , Jennifer Childs . &quot; I ' d try letting her off at different spots , &quot; Louise Brawdy says . &quot; I ' d just say , ' Don ' t pay any attention . They ' ll realize it ' s not getting a rise and it ' ll go away. ' &quot; Louise complained to school officials . The principal was alerted at least four times , by school employees as well as Louise . He warned the students that they would be suspended if the abuse didn ' t stop . But the name-calling continued . Then one day , when she was cleaning Tawnya ' s room , Louise found a will . &quot; She had written who she was leaving her stuffed animals and her tapes to , &quot; Louise recalls one August morning as her eyes brim with tears . &quot; This was a 13-year-old kid and these were her most prized possessions . I was devastated. &quot; Louise sighs as she tells her story . By now the tears have washed clean her eye makeup and she no longer bothers to hide them . &quot; I didn ' t know what else to do , who else to turn_to . I didn ' t know how else to explain or say it . I had been watching her with the headaches , the stomachaches , not wanting to go_to school , the grades dropping . But I didn ' t even realize the depth of depression she was in. &quot; In December , 1988 , after learning about Title IX from an acquaintance knowledgeable_about education law , Louise took her daughter ' s case to the Office for Civil Rights , filing the first peer-on-peer sexual_harassment complaint under that law . A federal investigator in 1989 concluded that the Petaluma schools had engaged in sexual discrimination under Title IX by failing to stop the abuse . The schools promised to clean_up their act with new policies , procedures and training . So by the time Jane Doe brought her complaint to Homrighouse , the school had in place a sexual_harassment policy . Indeed , on Feb . 24 , just a week before Jane ' s mother pulled her out , Kenilworth teachers received a memo urging them to review the policy and distribute it to students if necessary , &quot; in addition to taking disciplinary action. &quot; The memo was prompted in part by the meeting with Jane Doe ' s father . The Does didn ' t apply the words &quot; illegal sexual_harassment &quot; to their own daughter ' s abuse until reading about a lawsuit that the Brawdys subsequently filed . They got_in_touch with the Brawdy attorneys and began considering legal_action . Meanwhile , with the help of an experienced civil_rights activist named Linda Purrington , a Petaluma copy_editor raising a young daughter on_her_own , Brawdy founded a group called &quot; Parents for Title IX &quot; to support families going_through similar experiences , publishing a newsletter for more_than 400 subscribers . The boxes crammed into her living room contain the details of cases around the country . Whenever she starts to wallow in grief about her own daughter -- who , she says , still suffers from depression and troubled social_relations -- Louise Brawdy grabs on to the lifeline of language from her newfound political cause . &quot; This is a cycle that has to be broken , &quot; she asserts , as she puts her emotions in check . &quot; If we don ' t start teaching our girls about equality in the system , it ' s not ever going_to change. &quot; Teaching girls -- and boys -- to stand_up for themselves . teaching boys -- and girls -- to stop hurtful behavior . In the 1990s , parents and educators and policy-makers need to decide whether the legal_system is the best vehicle to teach those lessons . No one should minimize the emotional toll on children like Tawnya Brawdy and Jane Doe , who , researchers say , are at risk later in life for all sorts of problems . The lesson from these children is that even with all our strides toward tolerance and equality , we are still inept at teaching our youth how to respect each other and their bodies . &quot; We are fumbling and learning , &quot; says the University of Wisconsin ' s Brown . &quot; There ' s a discomfort with many adults over what qualifies as normal and what doesn ' t . Because we as adults are confused , we are not very effective at instructing children . There is a lack of consistency among adults in their lives. &quot; &quot; Kids are so confused about their own sexuality , &quot; says Vargyas of the National Women ' s Law Center . &quot; We sort of pressure boys to experiment with their behavior , and somehow girls are supposed to know what ' s welcome or unwelcome , what ' s appropriate or not appropriate . Then there ' s the whole issue of how do you communicate the unwelcomeness ? &quot; Popular culture is no ally in this . America ' s children are being raised in a culture of wholesale commercial sex and in-your-face displays of wrath . They mindlessly mimic rap lyrics referring to girls as &quot; hos &quot; and &quot; bitches &quot; or scratch graffiti on bathroom walls with imaginative descriptions of the barely concealed body_parts they see sprawled across the tube . The sexual liberation of the ' 60s and ' 70s obliterated the old rules of etiquette between the sexes , leaving adults at_a_loss to provide the language and social skills to replace them . But labeling the abusive behavior &quot; sexual_harassment &quot; may take us down a road we don ' t want to go . &quot; Maybe there should be a moratorium on touch , &quot; one feminist educator said during a national strategy session last spring . Another sexual_harassment crusader , author Susan Strauss , suggests : &quot; How about asking if a hug is OK before giving it ? &quot; Keith Geiger , president of the National Education Assn. , warns that just as teachers and coaches have had to affect a more distant physical relationship with their students , so too will children with each other . &quot; It saddens me , &quot; he adds . This is a litigious society , and sexual_harassment is a legal term . It takes judgment calls_out of the hands of educators and gives the accuser a powerful tool over schools , teachers and even other parents . The law punishes rather than educates , and it draws lines of behavior in black_and_white , rarely capturing the gray nuances of childhood life . It doesn ' t distinguish between the name- calling of an elementary-schooler ( which probably doesn ' t deserve suspension ) and breast-grabbing by a high-schooler ( which probably does ) . A better answer instead may lie_in the schools ' latest response to a different problem , violence . Conflict resolution programs , adopted by more_than half of the nation ' s schools in the past five years , teach children how to rely_on themselves and other peers to resolve disputes . Another answer must come from home . Because most bullying takes_place outside the view of adults , adult role_models can be particularly important , especially , says Geiger , because too many parents encourage a &quot; macho attitude. &quot; Acutely aware that schools alone aren ' t equipped to deal with all interpersonal disputes , the National PTA now urges its local units to &quot; encourage parents not only to look_at what they are teaching , but also what models they are providing in their own relationships , and what they are saying to children in response to what they see on TV or in other media , &quot; says Ginny Markell , chair of the group ' s Health and Welfare Commission . Since the Doe and Brawdy cases came_to_light , the Petaluma schools have adopted a new &quot; sexual_harassment &quot; policy that provides_for punishment ranging from counseling to expulsion . They may have missed the point : An earlier policy growing out of the Brawdy case , brimming with legalese about sexual_harassment and Title IX , didn ' t prevent Jane ' s abuse . What school districts here and across the county still need is widespread teacher training and a curriculum designed to teach children how to treat one another with respect . Before filing their lawsuit , the Does suggested to Petaluma administrators that the school discuss the issue of sexual_harassment at student assemblies and that a policy be sent home for parents to sign . &quot; They need to educate those children and they ' re not doing_it , &quot; says Jane ' s mother . Now , though , it ' s too late . The issue is in the courts , and the Does have no intention of backing_down . &quot; This has been real hard for me , &quot; Jane ' s mother adds . &quot; But it ' s important for us to be aggressive in following it through to show our daughter that we believe_in her , and what was done was wrong . And that we ' ll do whatever needs to be done to protect her now. &quot;</TEXT>
