   <HEADLINE> REALTY WOES , HEALTH_CARE CUTS HURT FRAWLEY ; HOSPITALS : TROUBLED TIMES MAY HAVE HIT TOO HARD FOR THE COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZED IN RUNNING SCHICK ADDICTION TREATMENT CENTERS TO RECOVER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Frawley Corp. , which claims its Schick tobacco , alcohol and drug_addiction treatment centers have restored thousands of patients to productive lives , is itself suffering such a severe financial hangover that its own recovery is dubious . The company has been forced into a tailspin by the push for cost containment among health_care insurers combined with the collapse of the market for Southern California real_estate -- another of Frawley ' s principal holdings . Since 1988 , Frawley ' s last profitable year , its total losses have piled_up to $ 12.8 million -- including a $ 689 # 000 loss on revenue of $ 1.82 million in the quarter that ended March 31 . Meanwhile , its annual revenue has tumbled from $ 35.4 million six years ago to $ 9.83 million last year . Frawley ' s stock , which traded at $ 8.50 a share_in the late 1980s , was down to 6 a share before it was delisted by the Pacific Stock_Exchange in 1992 . And the company ' s auditors , Deloitte &amp; Touche of Los Angeles , raised a classic red flag by saying they have &quot; doubt about ( Frawley ' s ) ability to continue as a going concern &quot; in documents filed_in April with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Patrick J . Frawley Jr. , the eccentric chief_executive , says he will pull his company out of its hole by selling_off real_estate , jettisoning two of Schick ' s three addiction treatment hospitals , and putting smaller Schick units in acute care hospitals across the country . A millionaire who once chaired the Schick Safety_Razor Co. , Frawley , 71 , may have the wherewithal to succeed , but the odds against him are long . As of March 31 , the company owed $ 4 million in current liabilities -- due within 12 months -- while its current assets had shrunk to $ 2 million . &quot; I think they ' re trying as hard as they possibly can to turn things around , &quot; said Frank Hawrylak , an analyst with Tweedy , Browne Company , a New York investment_firm that held about 7 % of Frawley ' s stock before unloading it earlier this year . &quot; Frawley believes he ' s got a good product , &quot; Hawrylak said . &quot; I don ' t know if he does or not. &quot; The company ' s core business has always been its Schick Laboratories unit , which has a handful of small addiction treatment centers and , until recently , large addiction treatment hospitals in Santa Barbara , Seattle and Fort_Worth , Tex . Schick treats addictions by administering small electric_shocks or drugs that induce nausea while patients are confronted with the substances they are addicted to . Frawley says Schick has a 70 % success rate in treating alcohol and tobacco addictions , and a 50 % success rate treating addictions to cocaine and other drugs . Schick thrived in the 1980s as Americans were becoming more health conscious , and celebrities and athletes seemed to be tripping over themselves to check_into addiction treatment facilities such_as the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage . At the same time , Nancy Reagan was fervently pushing her &quot; just say no &quot; to drugs campaign . From 1980 through 1988 , Frawley was dependably profitable . But by the late 1980s , insurance_companies became increasingly reluctant to pay_for expensive treatments . The expansion of cost-conscious health_maintenance_organizations accelerated the trend . In the past decade , the money HMOs budget_for mental_health coverage , including addiction treatment , has dwindled from $ 2 per patient per month to about 50 cents , said John Edelston , president of HealthPro Associates , a consulting_firm in Woodland Hills . Much of the cost savings has been achieved by curtailing inpatient care in favor of cheaper outpatient treatment . Schick has bucked this trend , and it still requires patients to check_in for a 10-day stay , followed by a pair of two-day treatment sessions . Patrick Frawley insists that altering the Schick method would reduce its effectiveness . As a result , Schick ' s price of about $ 12 # 000 for treatment is more_than twice the cost for typical outpatient treatments at other detox centers . Schick ' s high prices have made_it difficult for the company to land contracts with HMOs , which provide an ever-growing share of the nation ' s medical_care . Once able to attract patients by advertising on late-night TV , Schick now finds that it isn ' t even an option on &quot; preferred providers &quot; lists of most HMOs . Increasingly dependent_on patients who pay_out of pocket for treatment , and facing more competition from nicotine patch treatments and other alternative products , Schick ' s business has shrunk . The company treated about 2 # 000 addicts in 1988 , and Patrick Frawley acknowledged the number &quot; has gone_down steadily &quot; ever since . Frawley Corp . has managed to stay afloat largely because it has sold_off Southern California real_estate that it had purchased with 1980s profits from the Schick division . By 1989 , the company owned 713 acres of largely undeveloped land in the Santa Monica Mountains near Agoura that cost about $ 12.9 million , according to SEC documents . But just when Frawley needed to start selling the land to raise cash , the local real_estate market began to slow . Over the past three years Patrick Frawley said the company sold 450 acres in the Santa Monica mountains and suffered a $ 3-million loss . Frawley and his son -- Michael P . Frawley , vice_president of the corporation -- have also lent the company $ 416 # 000 , according to SEC documents . That Frawley has dipped_into his own pockets reflects his obsessive commitment to the business . For Frawley , who admits he is a former alcoholic , curing the nation ' s addicts has become a personal crusade . In the 1940s Patrick Frawley started to make a business name for himself by taking_over a failing ballpoint_pen parts maker and turning it into the Papermate Pen Co . He later chaired the Schick Safety_Razor Co. , and Technicolor , a North Hollywood maker of film prints and videotapes . Frawley also made millions in real_estate deals , including the sale in 1987 of a 4.5-acre Holmby Hills property -- once owned by Bing Crosby -- to television producer Aaron Spelling for $ 10.25 million . Spelling subsequently demolished the Crosby mansion and built a 56 # 000-square-foot house . Frawley ' s life took a new turn_in the early 1970s , when he was treated for alcoholism at the Shadel Hospital in Seattle . He was so impressed with the hospital that he bought_it and launched Schick treatment centers in 1972 . Fighting addictions became his life ' s mission , and often he seems able to talk_about little else . During a series of lengthy telephone_interviews , Frawley expounded on the personal and social costs of addictions . Asked to discuss the condition of his business , Frawley repeatedly resisted . &quot; You ' re not interested in the guts of it -- saving people ' s lives , &quot; he said . Sketching out his plan to save the company , Frawley said the first_step is to &quot; get_rid_of the bricks and mortar. &quot; So the company shut_down its 50-bed detox hospital in Fort_Worth in May , and Frawley said the building was expected to be sold this month for $ 1.6 million . The 30-bed Santa Barbara hospital was closed_in June , and Frawley hopes to sell it for about $ 2.5 million , he said . The proceeds from the hospital sales will be used to pay_off debts , he said . The hospitals will be replaced by a network of smaller treatment centers within acute care hospitals across the country . One such unit , a 13-bed facility at St . Mary Medical_Center in Long_Beach , opened in November . Four others could be in place by the end of the year , Frawley said , though he declined to give more details . Frawley , whose family owns about 70 % of the company ' s stock , said he hopes the Schick unit can cut its costs by sharing administrative , clerical and maintenance costs with hospitals . And hospitals , Frawley hopes , will welcome the business because the trend to outpatient care has left many hospitals with empty beds . &quot; We ' re trying to lower costs as much as we can , &quot; said Frawley . &quot; I think we ' re going to be successful eventually. &quot; But with revenues on a steep five-year slide , the escape_hatch for Frawley Corp . grows narrower by the minute . That is a problem even Patrick Frawley acknowledges . &quot; Obviously we can ' t do_it much longer , &quot; Frawley said . &quot; We ' ve got_to come_up with some solutions. &quot;</TEXT>
