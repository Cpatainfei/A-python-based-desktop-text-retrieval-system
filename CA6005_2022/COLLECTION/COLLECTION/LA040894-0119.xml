   <HEADLINE> 715 ; IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO TODAY THAT HANK AARON ECLIPSED ONE OF SPORT ' S MOST MAGICAL NUMBERS , BREAKING BABE_RUTH ' S HOME_RUN RECORD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> April didn ' t come_in like a lion or a lamb in the Eastern United States 20 years ago , but blew in with Ruthian gusto , as if presaging the ensuing tumultuous events . On April 3 , 1974 , a series of wicked tornadoes touched_down in the Cincinnati area . Hail the size of tennis_balls pelted traffic on Interstate 75 . The small_town of Xenia , Ohio , an hour or so north , nearly disappeared , as did several neighborhoods of Cincinnati itself . On the heels of the twisters , Hank Aaron and the Atlanta Braves blew into the city for the next day ' s baseball opener , trailing a media cyclone that cut a swath the length of the baseball world , from the United States to Latin_America to Japan . Aaron was one home_run away from tying Babe_Ruth ' s career record of 714 , one of sport ' s magical numbers . The countdown had been_on hold since the previous October , when the 39-year-old Aaron finished fast , hitting his 40th homer of the season -- No . 713 -- in Houston on the final Saturday . The media and publicity crush -- a virtual caravan had begun traveling with the Braves late in the ' 73 season -- was such_that Aaron often had to stay separately from his teammates , check_into different hotels under assumed names and generally live like a rock_star , though he remained largely the same quiet , unassuming man he had been when he joined the Milwaukee Braves as a skinny 20-year-old in 1954 . Remarkably , Aaron was outwardly unfazed by the hubbub , from tornadoes to media to racist hate mail . But his actions touched_off storms of controversy throughout the week leading_up to the record . &quot; He handled it better than everybody . He was amazing , &quot; Eddie Mathews recalled from his Del Mar home . Mathews , who had paired with Aaron to become the most prolific home-run hitting teammates in baseball annals , was the Braves ' manager as Aaron approached the mark . * Aaron trivia : Starting late in the 1973 season , umpires used different baseballs for Aaron ' s at-bats , with special stamps ( visible under UV light ) so fans -- or even players -- couldn ' t claim to have a historic ball ; advertisers from as far away as South_America were offering $ 25 # 000 for No . 715 . * Thursday , April 4 , dawned sunny and breezy , thankfully calm of tornadoes . Vice_President Gerald Ford was_on hand for the game , after a helicopter tour of the remains of Xenia . The tornadoes dominated the day ' s headlines . They would n ' t for long . Aaron , recently turned 40 , wanted to set the record in Atlanta . He was going_to sit_out the opening three-game series at Cincinnati , but at the urging of major_league baseball , he started the opener against right-hander Jack Billingham , who had slept on the floor while twisters tore through his neighborhood . Aaron didn ' t keep people in_suspense long . With two on in the first inning , Aaron sent homer No . 714 on a low trajectory over the left-field fence . It was his first swing of the season . Left_fielder Pete Rose watched it sail over the wall into an area below the permanent stands , where it was retrieved by a policeman . The game was stopped , Aaron made a brief speech and waved . Billingham then retired the side . In the dugout after the first inning , Billingham saw teammates looking_at him pensively . &quot; Didn ' t waste any time , did I ? &quot; he commented . Aaron ' s next at-bats were uneventful , and the Reds came_back to win , 7-6 . That home_run would make Mathews ' job tougher . Friday , April 5 , was an off-day . Before Saturday ' s game , Mathews announced that Aaron would sit_out the games Saturday and Sunday ; the Braves thought Cincinnati had gotten its fair share of him . Atlanta had drawn poorly the previous two seasons , had an 11-game home stand coming and envisioned sellouts . &quot; He was getting some miles on him , it wasn ' t like he was going_to play every day , &quot; Mathews said of Aaron , who eventually played in 112 games that season . But baseball had other ideas -- best interests of the game , fielding your most competitive team , etc . Commissioner Bowie Kuhn told the Braves to play Aaron . Mathews got his hackles up and kept Aaron on the bench Saturday against young fireballer Don Gullett , saying : &quot; Right or wrong , this is Eddie Mathews ' decision. &quot; News_conferences occurred hourly . Influential New York columnists Red Smith and Dick Young took the Braves to task . The Atlanta media hotly told these carpetbaggers to butt out . Kuhn phoned . Mathews recalled : &quot; He made_it clear there were going_to be repercussions . He said , ' I ' m going_to suspend you , the general_manager , the owner and everybody in the Atlanta front office. ' So I played him Sunday. &quot; The finale of the series proved anticlimactic , even embarrassing . Aaron struck_out twice and grounded_out weakly against Clay Kirby , misplayed a fly_ball in left field and was replaced by Ralph Garr in the seventh inning . The caravan packed up and moved to Atlanta for a home stand starting against the Dodgers on Monday , April 8 . The Dodgers arrived in town at 1:30 a.m. Believe it or not , there were tornado warnings in Atlanta , but the threat subsided for that night ' s game . Dodger left-hander Al Downing was the scheduled starter . Kuhn , as vilified as Gen . Sherman in Atlanta , was in Cleveland addressing a banquet that night . He feared that his presence in Atlanta might detract from the event and sent assistant Monte Irvin in his place . A national TV_audience was tuned_in . There was a palpable air of expectation in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium . The sellout crowd was treated to a pregame ceremony honoring Aaron . A soft drizzle began . In the second inning , Aaron walked without offering at any of the five pitches . In the fourth , Aaron came_to bat with Darrell Evans on first_base . Downing threw a changeup for a ball . His second pitch , at 9:07 p.m. , was a fastball that was supposed to tail but didn ' t . With his first home-field swing of the season , Aaron sent the ball_over the left-field fence into the Brave bullpen , where pitcher Tom House caught_it . Dodger left fielder Bill Buckner , who had discussed splitting the reward with center_fielder Jim Wynn , tried to scramble up the wire fence , but saw House glove it . &quot; Our first game in Atlanta , I ' ll be darned if he doesn ' t hit the homer , &quot; Mathews remembered with a laugh . &quot; About half the stadium got_up and left in the middle of the game . If he hadn ' t hit it ( right away ) , we ' d have had 55 # 000 every game. &quot; Aaron was swamped at_home plate by teammates and a_few fans who made their way onto the field while he was circling the bases . His parents were brought_down from the stands . House , approaching the mob to present the historic ball to Aaron , was shocked to see the new home_run king fighting_back tears as he hugged his mother . &quot; Suddenly , I saw what many people have never been able to see in him -- deep emotion , &quot; House said later . &quot; I looked , and he had tears hanging_on his lids . I could hardly believe it . I put the ball in his hand . He said , ' Thanks , kid , ' and touched me on the shoulder. &quot; A few minutes later , Aaron took a congratulatory call_in Mathews ' office from President Nixon . He expressed relief , saying it felt_like &quot; the weight of a stove &quot; was off his shoulders . Downing had control problems after the ceremony , walked two batters and was taken_out of the game by Manager Walter Alston . A cab was called , and Downing left the stadium . With good cheer that has never failed him , he told the one reporter who tracked him down before he left : &quot; I ' m more concerned about my next start . This thing is over . It ' s history . It won ' t bother me. &quot; Downing has joined Tracy Stallard , Tom Zachary , Dennis Eckersley and a select few other pitchers remembered as the answers to home_run trivia . * Aaron trivia : Steve Garvey was the first_baseman for two of the most documented hits in baseball history : Aaron ' s 715th homer and Rose ' s 4 # 192nd hit , which broke Ty Cobb ' s career record . Garvey was with the Padres for Rose ' s hit and was the first player to greet him . He apparently had no plan to cop a souvenir . If Aaron had caught Ruth at the end of the ' 73 season , Houston first_baseman Lee May told George Plimpton he had planned to bear-hug Aaron as he rounded the bag -- and grab his batting_helmet . He ' d planned to keep it in his den and display it : &quot; There it is , the helmet Bad Henry wore when he hit 714. &quot; * Twenty years later , no one has approached Aaron ' s final total of 755 , and there ' s nobody on the horizon . Check back in 15 or 16 years to see if Ken Griffey Jr . or Juan Gonzalez or Frank Thomas mounted an assault . But in some ways , Aaron never supplanted Ruth , which he readily admits . &quot; Somebody can come_along and hit 800 home_runs , and it ' s never going_to mean as much as Babe_Ruth ' s record , &quot; he said recently . &quot; Babe_Ruth ' s homers are always going_to be legend. &quot; Did Mathews ever have the sudden realization that Aaron might be the one to finally overhaul Ruth ? &quot; We didn ' t look_at things like that , &quot; Mathews said , adding : &quot; He was the best player I ' ve seen , all-around . He went_out there every year to play every game. &quot; Two decades later , there ' s a radical thought .</TEXT>
