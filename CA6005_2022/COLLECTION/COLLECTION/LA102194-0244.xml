   <HEADLINE> CHINA PLANS ' A FEW MORE ' NUCLEAR TESTS ; ASIA : EFFORT AIMS TO FEND OFF ' BLACKMAIL. ' BEIJING ALSO CONSIDERS COMPUTER SIMULATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China plans to conduct &quot; a_few more &quot; underground nuclear tests during the next two years , or at least until an international test ban treaty is reached , a senior official in the Foreign Ministry said Thursday . &quot; We need a little more nuclear testing just to show that we can do_it , so no one will try to blackmail us , &quot; said the official during an unusually candid discussion with a_few Western reporters . The &quot; blackmail &quot; reference dates to the Korean_War , during which China claims that the United States threatened it with nuclear attack in what it termed at the time &quot; nuclear blackmail. &quot; The official , who has an extensive background in arms control negotiations , also said China is interested in pursuing a proposal by U.S. Secretary_of_Defense William J . Perry that it substitute computer simulation for nuclear tests . However , he said , the computer simulation procedure , while an attractive idea among the five major nuclear_powers , faced likely opposition from non-nuclear countries that view it as another form of nuclear proliferation . &quot; Whereas it might be technically feasible , it may_not be politically feasible , &quot; the official said . Perry , who visited China earlier this week , said in a news_conference Tuesday that he had discussed with senior Chinese officials &quot; ways of eliminating the need for testing ( that ) had to do with computer simulation techniques. &quot; &quot; We discussed the possibility of exchanging information in that field , &quot; Perry said . &quot; To the extent we can do that without compromising security , I think that would be a positive step forward. &quot; One objective the U.S. defense_secretary set as part of his four-day visit , which ended Wednesday , was to dissuade the Chinese from further nuclear testing . Since Oct . 5 , 1993 , the Chinese have conducted three underground nuclear tests , breaking a moratorium observed by the four other nuclear_powers -- the United States , Britain , France and Russia . The most recent blast , estimated at between 40 and 150 kilotons , took_place at China ' s remote Lop Nor testing ground in Xinjiang province on Oct . 6 . Officials in Beijing argue that since China has the fewest warheads among the nuclear_powers , it needs the testing to close the technological gap between it and the four other countries . According to arms control specialists , China ' s nuclear forces are made_up of about 300 warheads mounted on intermediate- and long-range missiles , bombers and submarines . Some arms control specialists speculate that the latest round of testing is aimed at improving China ' s submarine nuclear_weapons system , the only one in its arsenal capable of threatening targets in the United States . U.S. officials are encouraged by Chinese pledges to halt all testing by 1996 , or even before , if a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is reached in Geneva . On Thursday , the senior Foreign Ministry official reaffirmed this position . &quot; China has made a political decision not to conduct nuclear tests after the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , &quot; the official said . However , he suggested that the 1996 deadline for signing the treaty may_not be firm . &quot; It ' s an artificial date just to show there is political will , &quot; he said . The biggest block to the conclusion of the treaty , the official said , is U.S. opposition to a statement promising that it will not be the first party to use nuclear_weapons in a conflict . &quot; A U.S. commitment on non-first-use , as well as the commitment of other powers , would certainly help in China ' s participation , &quot; the official said . The briefing for foreign reporters was the latest in a series of steps by the Chinese government to be more open about its nuclear programs .</TEXT>
