   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON CHINA ; SPEAK LOUDLY AND HIDE THE STICK ; KEEP CHANNELS OPEN ON HUMAN-RIGHTS SUPPORT ; RESERVE SANCTIONS FOR EXTREME CRIMES , SEVERE THREATS TO U.S. INTERESTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The diplomatic train wreck resulting from Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher ' s trip to China highlights the urgent requirement for a workable U.S. human-rights policy toward Asia . The issue goes well beyond China and resonates powerfully in South and Southeast_Asia as well . Democracy and human_rights have been themes in U.S. foreign_policy as old as the Republic . In fact , the idea that America could exert influence in the world on behalf of these values can be traced back to colonial days , when John Winthrop , the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , evoked the classic image of America as &quot; a city on a hill &quot; -- an example to the world . No successful U.S. foreign_policy can long ignore these values ; the electorate will not permit it . But the Clinton_Administration ' s strong impulse to champion human_rights has not been matched with a clear strategy to avoid provoking disputes that undercut other important policy interests . In Asia , these interests involve economic ties with a region that is the world ' s fastest-growing . U.S. security commitments include the Korean_peninsula where , not incidentally , Chinese cooperation is critical to dealing with an emergent North_Korean nuclear_weapons capability . America and Asia come_to the human-rights debate each bolstered by recent historic successes . The U.S. victory in the Cold_War seemed to validate American political and economic_values . Given the region ' s spectacular economic performance over the past two decades , many Asians believe ( and some Western observers agree ) that they have developed a model for an advanced modern economy that differs in significant respects from -- and is demonstrably superior to -- the American orthodox faith in free markets and minimal government intrusion . Newly confident Asian leaderships are in no mood to take lessons from a United States that many see as deeply flawed , living well beyond its means with a society ill-disciplined and riven by crime . Moreover , the cultural foundations of Asian society differ importantly from those in the West . Among these differences is the comparatively higher value Asians assign to group welfare and harmony as opposed to individual rights . Consequently , Asian views of democracy and civil_liberties often differ substantially from those in America . What , then is to be done ? Is there a policy mix that supports vital U.S. interests in Asia while giving due regard_to human-rights concerns ? There is , and it can be summarized as &quot; speak loudly and keep your stick_in the closet. &quot; Specifically : * Articulate support for democratic and human-rights values through a variety of political and diplomatic means : official government statements , speeches by political_leaders , congressional resolutions and diplomatic representations , including contact with and sympathy for victims of political oppression and human-rights abuse . * Do nothing to discourage the activities of nongovernmental human-rights organizations like Asia Watch . * Cooperate fully in preparing congressionally mandated reports regarding the human-rights performance of other countries . But : * Adopt a little humility in dealing with Asia by acknowledging that these are some of the world ' s most ancient and sophisticated cultures , and maybe Americans do not have all_the answers about how they can best organize their domestic affairs . * Acknowledge that on some of the issues in which the United States adopted sanctions for human-rights purposes a full U.S. ( or at least congressional ) understanding of the circumstances and motivations was often lacking . For example , U.S. sanctioning of Malaysia for its rejection of Vietnamese boat people came despite Malaysia ' s years of accepting these refugees or , in the worst case , diverting them to refugee centers in Indonesia . * Understand that the most powerful agents for democratization are : modernization and rising living standards ( including the emergence of a middle_class ) ; the explosion of international communications ; person-to-person contact with America , especially through education in the United States of Asian college_students and military_officers , and the example of a successful , democratic and humane America . * Sanctions , such_as trade restrictions or denial of most-favored-nation status should be reserved for core national interests ( to pressure China regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , for one ) not human_rights . The only exceptions should be when the human-rights abuses are sustained and brutal in the extreme , as in the Khmer Rouge slaughter in Cambodia , or when voted by the U.N. Security_Council . President Kennedy summarized his hemispheric human-rights policy more_than three decades ago with the phrase : &quot; A polite handshake for dictators ; a warm abrazo for democrats. &quot; It is a formula as applicable today in Asia as it was then in Latin_America .</TEXT>
