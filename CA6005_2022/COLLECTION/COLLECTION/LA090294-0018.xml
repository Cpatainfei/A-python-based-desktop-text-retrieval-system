   <HEADLINE> BALTICS-MOSCOW FEUD OUTLASTS TROOPS ISSUE ; EUROPE : THE RED ARMY IS GONE , BUT RUSSIAN SURVEYORS ARE TRYING TO CLAIM LAND IN BORDER DISPUTE WITH ESTONIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A day after the tiny Baltic nations bade good riddance to the Red Army , Russian surveyors were hacking through a forest Thursday in what is viewed here as a menacing new incursion . Escorted by lumberjacks and gun-toting soldiers , the surveyors are marking a 56-mile stretch of the Russian-Estonian border , planting concrete poles every 50 yards to tighten Moscow ' s hold_on 1 # 430 square_miles . A two-headed eagle , the Russian symbol , glares from a plaque on each pole . The demarcation began just after Russia agreed in July to withdraw its last troops from Estonia and just as Estonia was reviving its claim to the territory , which the Soviet_Union gave_up in 1920 and grabbed back in 1940 when the Red Army occupied all_of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania . That occupation is over now . But the eagles on the poles are a sign that the bitter , half-century conflict between Moscow and the Baltics is not . Leaders across the Baltics say the feud is simply entering a more subtle phase_in which border claims , trade restrictions , energy dependence , television propaganda and infiltration by criminals are the main threats to national security . &quot; I call_upon our friends abroad not to fall prey to the illusion that the withdrawal of occupation forces has brought the final solution to the ' Baltic question , ' &quot; Estonian President Lennart Meri said in a speech Wednesday after the last Russian naval vessel left port . &quot; We need your support , sometimes even greater support now that the future seems more secure and less dramatic. &quot; After the Baltics regained independence from a collapsing Soviet_Union three years ago , Moscow insisted on better treatment of ethnic Russians -- the occupiers and their offspring who make_up a third of Estonia ' s and Latvia ' s populations -- as a condition for bringing the troops home . Lithuania , where Russians are 9 % of the population , imposed no restrictions on citizenship , and the last troops left a year ago . Prodded by President Clinton and European leaders , Estonia and Latvia brought their citizenship laws into line with international norms and agreed to let thousands of retired Soviet officers stay . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , bowing to the same Western pressure , ordered the troops out Wednesday . But not before he signed a decree formalizing the Kremlin ' s role as self-appointed guardian of 25 million ethnic Russians scattered across the former Soviet empire . In explaining the decree , Russian officials say they still regard the Estonian and Latvian citizenship laws as too restrictive -- naturalization of Latvia ' s half a_million non-citizens , for example , will be spread_over nine years -- and intend to apply economic pressure to change them . &quot; There are lots of options , &quot; Alexander Udaltsov , a Russian Foreign Ministry official , said in a telephone_interview Thursday . &quot; It is no secret that most of the cargo transferred through the Baltics is destined for Russia . By choosing which ports the cargoes go_through , we can make these countries take notice. &quot; * Moscow is already withholding promised trade preferences that would boost Latvia ' s and Estonia ' s exports to Russia . And Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis said the Russians have hinted recently at cutting_back supplies of natural_gas -- a weapon used against the Baltics in winters past . Lithuania is also being denied most-favored-nation trading status , for a different reason . Russia wants to make permanent its temporary right to move military equipment and personnel across Lithuania for a major buildup in the Russian Baltic_Sea enclave of Kaliningrad . Reluctant to accept the loss of its empire , Russia plays big-stick politics with all its neighbors , and so far the Baltics have outdone the others in asserting their independence . They have created stable currencies and dynamic private sectors , kept inflation low and attracted foreign investors . But there are important differences among the three nations that will bear_on how successfully they deal with Russia in the post-occupation era . Lithuania , the slowest to reform , clings_to government subsidies for producers . Its economy is more dependent_on agricultural exports and has few markets outside Russia . Latvia and Estonia have pushed economic reform more consistently -- at the cost of bankruptcies and unemployment . While Latvia ' s industry is heavier and tied to Russia ' s , Estonia ' s is geared to electronics and is more competitive globally . Just 18 % of Estonia ' s trade is with the former Soviet_Union , compared with 60 % of Latvia ' s and 80 % of Lithuania ' s . Estonia has broken its dependence on Russian fuel ; its neighbors depend_on subsidized Russian gas . With an economy expected to grow 7 % this year , Estonia can afford to challenge Moscow more aggressively . In the spring , it pulled the plug on Russia ' s Ostankino television network -- a prime source of Russian propaganda that offends the Baltics -- for falling_behind in rebroadcast fees . And Estonia is pressing its claim to disputed border territory , despite Russia ' s refusal to negotiate . Latvia also has a border quarrel with Russia but is taking a different approach . &quot; We have to be_active in our foreign_policy without creating any conflicts , &quot; Ulmanis said . All three countries have signed free-trade agreements with the European Union and expect to gain associate membership soon . They have joined NATO ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program and are forming a joint military battalion for U.N. peacekeeping duties . * Meeting with the three Baltic presidents here in July , President Clinton agreed to set_up a $ 50-million American Enterprise Fund to promote U.S. trade and investment in the region . &quot; Latvia isn ' t a lonely country anymore , &quot; said Lija Busa , 66 , who was deported from Latvia at age 12 and spent 16 years in a Soviet labor camp . &quot; It is joining the world. &quot; But as the troops left , Baltic leaders said they feared that the West might not be so attentive to new pressures , including activism by paramilitary groups of retired Soviet officers and organized crime by mafia gangs linked to Russian intelligence services . Presidents Ulmanis and Meri put high priority on keeping peace with ethnic Russians . But ultimately , they say , the fate of their countries depends_on an unpredictable Russia , where ultranationalists like Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky speak_of reabsorbing the Baltic lands . &quot; They are small countries on the edge of a very large one , and they ' re never going_to be as totally independent as their nationalists like to believe or as Russians fear , &quot; said Paul A . Goble , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington . &quot; They are always going_to be heavily influenced by their eastern neighbor. &quot; Times special correspondent Matt Bivens in Tallinn , Estonia , and Steven Gutterman of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
