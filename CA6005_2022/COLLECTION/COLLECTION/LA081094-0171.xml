   <HEADLINE> INDEPENDENT COUNSEL SOUGHT IN ESPY CASE ; PROBE : THE ATTORNEY_GENERAL MAKES THE REQUEST . HER DEPARTMENT ALLEGES THE AGRICULTURE_SECRETARY RECEIVED GIFTS FROM GROUPS HIS OFFICE REGULATES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Atty . Gen . Janet Reno on Tuesday sought appointment of an independent counsel to investigate whether Agriculture_Secretary Mike Espy broke the law by accepting gifts worth &quot; at least several hundred dollars &quot; from a major poultry producer regulated by his department . In a broadly worded mandate to the special three-judge court that would name the counsel , Reno said the Justice_Department ' s preliminary investigation uncovered a number of instances in which Espy is alleged to have received gifts from organizations and individuals with business pending before his department . The mission of the independent counsel proposed by Reno was broad enough to include allegations that Ronald Blackley , Espy ' s chief_of_staff in March , 1993 , ordered Agriculture_Department officials to halt work_on developing tougher poultry inspection standards and to erase a draft of the proposal from their computers ' memories . Blackley has denied giving the orders on the inspection standards , which were strongly opposed by poultry producers . Although Espy has proclaimed his innocence and White_House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers Tuesday reiterated President Clinton ' s confidence in his Cabinet member , the investigation is sensitive for the Clintons because it involves Tyson Foods Inc. of Arkansas . Tyson President Don Tyson is a longtime Clinton backer and the firm ' s outside counsel , James B . Blair , helped First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton make nearly $ 100 # 000 in commodity trading profits in 1978 , 1979 and 1980 on an initial investment of $ 1 # 000 . The Justice_Department ' s preliminary inquiry found no evidence that Espy accepted gifts as a reward for past or future acts , Reno said in her application to the court . But the law bars the department from declining to ask_for an independent counsel because of lack of evidence of the required intent &quot; unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the person lacked such state of mind. &quot; Moreover , she noted that the Independent Counsel Act significantly restricts the department from exercising &quot; its customary prosecutorial discretion when investigating a person under the act &quot; and removes such traditional investigative tools as a grand_jury . The discretion and the tools are left to an independent counsel to exercise . The special court took no immediate action in naming an outside prosecutor . The same panel last Friday named Kenneth W . Starr , solicitor_general during the George_Bush Administration , to take_over the Whitewater probe from Robert B . Fiske Jr. , whom Reno had appointed after a previous independent counsel law had expired . In the Espy case , the department ' s investigation developed evidence that he had accepted gifts from Tyson Foods on two separate trips , one to Arkansas in May , 1993 , and one to Texas last January , Reno said . The 1993 trip involved a speech by Espy to the Arkansas Poultry Federation in Russellville , Ark. , and a stay with a companion , Patricia Dempsey , at a group of Tyson cottages on a lake there . Espy and Dempsey returned to Washington on a Tyson plane , which Espy has explained by saying that he had to return quickly for an unexpected White_House meeting . Tyson said Espy reimbursed the company for the cost of a first-class ticket . The January trip reportedly involved Espy and Dempsey sitting in Tyson ' s sky box during the National Football_League ' s National Conference championship game between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys . At the time , Espy has said , he was in Texas for a meeting with an Agriculture_Department official . The other instances in which Espy is alleged to have received gifts from organizations with business before his department are understood to include a request that he had made of Chicago-based Quaker Oats for a ticket to a Chicago Bulls playoff_game . He is alleged to have used the personal season_ticket of Quaker Oats ' chief_executive , William Smithburg . In a statement , Evan T . Barr , one of Espy ' s lawyers , said all_of his client ' s &quot; official and personal travel and entertainment expenses have been properly accounted_for and reimbursed . Secretary Espy has never misused his office in any way at all. &quot; In her application to the court , Reno noted that the anti-gratuity statute , one of the laws under which Espy ' s actions will be examined , is a strict statute that bars department employees with responsibilities under the Meat Inspection Act from accepting any gift from anybody engaged in commerce , without regard_to intent .</TEXT>
