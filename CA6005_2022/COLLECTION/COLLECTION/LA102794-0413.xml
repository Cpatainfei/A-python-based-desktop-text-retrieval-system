   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY ; NO BREATHING ROOM ; AN AQMD EFFORT TO TARGET TOXIC HOT SPOTS HAS BOGGED DOWN . THUS , FEW RESIDENTS WHO LIVE NEAR POTENTIAL AIR POLLUTERS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE HAZARDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> El Monte homemaker Estelle Ruiz , 53 , was hospitalized twice this year with water in her lungs . Her husband , Felipe , 55 , nurses a nagging sore_throat and stuffy nose . Next door , two children suffer nasal polyps that have turned their sinuses into solid blocks , and a doctor across the street resigned his hospital job with a crippling lung disease . People are worried in a blue-collar El Monte neighborhood adjoining the San Bernardino Freeway ; they lack statistics but it seems to them that breathing has become a struggle for too many people . Some say it ' s the smog or car pollution that muddies the air . But lately , residents are raising questions about emissions from a nearby chrome-plating plant , Sargent-Fletcher . A 1991 report the company submitted to regional air quality officials found that the air_pollution caused by the company ' s emissions posed the biggest health risk of any factory in the San Gabriel Valley . Residents , however , only found_out about the report ' s findings when a reporter came_to call . And they ' re not happy that no one told them before . &quot; We ' re citizens here , and we ' ve got our rights , &quot; said Felipe Ruiz , an evangelist . &quot; How many people have gotten sick without even knowing about it ? &quot; Under South Coast Air Quality Management District rules , neighborhoods such_as this one are supposed to be notified about air polluters in their midst . But both businesses and environmentalists complain that the new rules set_up an unwieldy procedure so mired in bureaucracy that they doubt the program will ever get_in gear . In 1989 , the five-county South Coast Air Quality Management District began an ambitious program to target toxic hot spots throughout Los Angeles and surrounding counties . Companies had to report the amount of toxins they release into the air and calculate the likelihood that those pollutants would cause health_problems , ranging from cancer to lead_poisoning , among their neighbors . After the agency performs a series of reviews on each report , the program ' s regulations require a business to inform neighbors if its emissions could cause more_than 10 cancer cases per million people . If emissions increase the cancer rate by 100 cases per million , the company is required to take steps to reduce the toxic chemicals that it releases . AQMD officials say they have been working as fast as they can , but the exhaustive study has been under way for five years now and officials say it may be years more before it is completed . Preliminary documents on file at the AQMD show that of 45 San Gabriel Valley companies that were required to submit reports to the agency , 12 might have to notify neighbors . Only Sargent-Fletcher , with a cancer risk estimated in 1991 at 120 per million , showed levels high enough to require reductions . The company disputes the risk , saying the environmental consultant who prepared the report made technical errors that resulted in mistakenly high numbers . In fact , government analysts have tentatively lowered the company ' s health risk levels , but to a still-high 85 per million . The company also contends , however , that it has reduced emissions since the writing of the 1991 report , which is still awaiting final AQMD review . The companies targeted by the study make everything from aerospace parts to glass bottles to mothballs . They ' re mostly found in lower-income areas such_as El Monte or industrial towns such_as Irwindale and Industry . But one is across the street from a sparkling new senior_citizens complex in Claremont . And virtually none of their neighbors know of the health risks . As stacks of reports awaiting approval pile_up at the South Coast Air Quality Management District , both businesses and environmentalists are holding their breath . * The AQMD ' s Toxics Hot Spots program was intended as &quot; the first sweeping approach to air toxics , &quot; said Ben Shaw , the program ' s senior enforcement manager . &quot; This was the first one where we said , let ' s look_at everything. &quot; So they looked_at everything . More_than 5 # 000 facilities in the district ' s five-county area filed reports on their emissions . Of those , 343 facilities that appeared to be polluting the most were required to perform a more detailed study called a health risk assessment . In the assessment , a company estimates how much toxic chemical it emits , using mathematical models of its manufacturing processes and air-flow patterns . Then it combines that with toxicology studies of people and animals to put a number value on the risks to humans . One part of the report calculates how many extra cancer cases per million people the plant ' s pollution is likely to cause . Another index measures other health risks , such_as lung problems , nerve damage or kidney_disease . The numbers in the reports are largely educated guesses rather than facts . It ' s almost impossible to measure the hazards of long-term exposure to low levels of a chemical , so environmental consultants fill_in gaps in data with best-guess assumptions . As a result , neither industry representatives nor environmentalists are happy . Industry decries the Toxics Hot Spots program as burdensome bureaucracy that exaggerates health risks and drives businesses from the state . Air quality activists say the program ignores some hazards and creates &quot; human sacrifice zones &quot; in the interest of economic gain . &quot; It ' s really a jobs-or-an-environment type of issue , &quot; said Randle Solganik , a board_member of the Metal-Finishing Assn . of Southern California , a trade association of the metals industry , which relies_on some highly toxic compounds in its manufacturing processes . &quot; It really comes_down to that . The question really is , how protective do you want to be. &quot; Businesses point_out that although the program measures the risk per million people , the number of residents exposed to the emissions is generally much less than that -- maybe a_few hundred at most . So the actual number of extra cancer cases that would occur is usually less than one . In addition , the model calculates the amount of chemicals a resident would be exposed to over the course of a lifetime , literally 24 hours a day , for 70 years . Few , if any , people would remain in one place for that long , industry experts assert , and therefore the regulations overestimate the level of exposure , and thus the risk , to neighbors . Furthermore , they say , the hazards from industrial chemicals pale in comparison to other carcinogens , such_as cigarette smoke or smog . Fred Cooper , a Bay Area environmental consultant to industry , calculated the health risks of air measured at various sites throughout California . He concluded that the average cancer risk was 600 in a_million -- six times the level permitted for industrial emissions . And the biggest contributors to that risk were auto emissions . And Gene Huber , an environmental consultant who performed the health risk assessment for an Azusa firm , Rubber Urethanes , said matching a cancer case with a particular chemical is like looking_for a needle in a haystack . &quot; Statistically , it ' s very impossible to even prove , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re looking_at one cancer death per million people in 70 years. &quot; The general cancer rate suggests there will be 350 # 000 cases of cancer in 70 years in any group of 1 million people , he said . &quot; How do we pick_out the one ( caused by toxins ) ? &quot; Environmentalists see those arguments as evasions . Air quality activists lobbied the AQMD board to require facilities with risks higher than one cancer case per million to reduce emissions . AQMD staff recommended setting the standard at 10 in a_million , the same level at which companies are required to notify neighbors . The board finally adopted the 100-in-a-million standard proposed by industry . Environmentalists say that leaves neighbors in limbo because many companies will have to tell neighbors about the risk but won ' t have to do anything to reduce it . &quot; The rule the board adopted is woefully weak and will provide scant protection for members of the community , &quot; said Denny Zane of the Coalition for Clean Air . &quot; It gave a false expectation of protection when no protection was being offered. &quot; Dr. Melanie Marty of the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment , which reviews the health risk assessments for AQMD , said the method of calculating the risks is designed to balance uncertainties on both sides of the equation . However , there are a number of glitches the method cannot account_for , Marty said . Risk assessments don ' t measure the mixed effects of different chemicals -- toxic substances may cancel each other out or multiply each other ' s effects , but the reports don ' t include those reactions , Marty said . Nor do they count the combined hazards of different facilities in the same area . that ' s a real concern in parts of the San Gabriel Valley . Of the 12 companies that might have to notify neighbors based on their preliminary reports , three are located in the City of Industry and three are in the El Monte-South El Monte area . The risk assessments also ignore chemicals that are transformed into carcinogens , or more potent carcinogens , after they are released , Marty said . And although 729 chemicals must be listed in emissions reports , there is only data on the health effects of about 200 of them . Furthermore , danger is measured in terms of healthy adults . But toxics may be more dangerous to children , the elderly or those with a genetic predisposition to cancer or other diseases . &quot; I don ' t think the health risk assessments are overly ( cautious ) , &quot; Marty said . &quot; They are designed to be health protective , but they are not overly ( cautious ) like industry likes to say. &quot; Solganik , though , complains that the limits set by California laws exceed those of other states , which could send businesses fleeing toward looser regulations -- or could close them down completely . &quot; They ' re trying to be overly protective , &quot; Solganik said . &quot; There ' s a price that you have to pay_for that , and the price is economic well-being. &quot; * Seven employees of Specialty Organics in Irwindale paid that price five years ago , said the company ' s president , Joe Seruto . In 1989 , the company compiled the health risk assessment required by the AQMD . The report estimated a cancer risk of 27 cancer cases per million for neighbors and 80 cases per million for workers , based on the chemical para-dichlorobenzene , used to make mothballs . Unsure about what changes AQMD would require of the company as a result of those risks , and facing other regulations over emissions , Seruto simply stopped making the chemical , he said . That meant laying_off seven of nine employees , some of whom had been with the company up_to 15 years . Specialty Organics had been manufacturing para-dichlorobenzene since Seruto ' s father opened the plant in 1962 . &quot; It ' s basically just mothballs , &quot; Seruto said . &quot; The problem with these rules is , they go overboard. &quot; Ted Garner , president of Garner Glass_in Claremont , said his company has danced a toxic two-step trying to keep_up with the regulations but still can ' t match the pace . Garner Glass is among the 12 area companies that might have to notify neighbors of the potential health hazards of their emissions . Its health report showed a cancer risk of 74.9 per million as a result of the chemical trichloroethylene , which its factory emits in the process of manufacturing glass tubing . &quot; I have a lot of problems with this program , &quot; Garner said . Most other glass manufacturers switched from trichloroethylene , which causes smog , to a related chemical that creates less air_pollution , he explained . But that chemical , it turns_out , tainted the water_supply , raising an outcry from water quality officials . So now the EPA is urging manufacturers to go_back to the original chemical , Garner said . Meanwhile , Judy Snow , manager of Claremont Villas Senior Apartments across the street , knew_nothing of the risk when the seniors complex , with its gleaming commons_room and cozy apartments , opened in January . * &quot; They really should have notified us when we opened , &quot; she said , &quot; because we have 154 seniors living here , and some of them have lung problems. &quot; Residents of the El Monte neighborhood near Sargent-Fletcher didn ' t even know the rules existed , much less that emissions from a facility near them might be so high . Now they think the rules don ' t go_far enough . Or fast enough . * &quot; I didn ' t know about this company , &quot; Felipe Ruiz said . &quot; If I knew about ( it ) . . . I would have organized the neighbors . I want to know what they ' re releasing and how long this has been going_on . I think people should get_together and start complaining. &quot; Sargent-Fletcher says it has cut production of the aerospace parts that it makes , reducing the amount of chromium it emits . And Ed Hilbert , the company ' s environmental consultant , said the first consultant , who wrote the report , made mistakes that exaggerated the risks . A state environmental official said that when her agency reviewed the report , it found that the risks were indeed lower than the original estimate -- but not by much . Judy Rosenbaum , a research scientist with the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment , said the company ' s health risk level now is set at 85 in a_million -- below the original 120 per million but well above the 10 in a_million level that would require the company to notify neighbors . In fact , the fear of angry neighbors is what makes these rules work , said Pat Leyden , AQMD ' s deputy head of stationary-source compliance . Proposition 65 , an earlier right-to-know law , prodded facilities to reduce emissions on_their_own , simply to avoid bad publicity . &quot; What we ' ve seen is that right-to-know legislation is very powerful , that companies do take aggressive steps to reduce emissions that they release . And they do that to maintain good relations with the community , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' ve seen many companies reduce emissions simply to avoid notifying the community . So it ' s a powerful tool. &quot; But only if the community knows about it . &quot; People affected have to be notified so that they can organize and work with the emitter to clean it up , &quot; said Doug Doepke , an environmental activist from Azusa . &quot; I don ' t know how the public can take action unless they ' re notified. &quot; Ironically , frustration over delays in the review process is probably the only point agreed on by both industry and environmentalists . &quot; This whole process has been typical bureaucracy at its worst , &quot; said Gene Huber , the Bay Area environmental consultant who measured the risks of background air . &quot; They went_out and did this and no one did_it before . So they did_it en masse and they did_it very badly . . . . They haven ' t completed the process in five years . They ' re supposed to repeat it every two years. &quot; To date , AQMD has finalized two of 343 health risk assessments received . Shaw said 20 more will be done before the end of the year , and the first batch of notifications will go_out in January . Air quality officials say they would have liked reviews to go more quickly , but they bristle_at criticism that they ' ve dropped the ball . When the program began , many companies submitted late reports , incomplete reports or didn ' t submit them at all , Shaw said . The ones that did come_in often had to be sent_back for corrections . But Marty said by far the biggest problem was volume . &quot; At the beginning of the program , nobody had any idea how many facilities would need risk assessments , &quot; she said . &quot; We thought ( there would be ) 60 or 70 . The final number ( statewide ) was 725 . Nobody foresaw that , so the resources needed to keep_up with the workload aren ' t there. &quot; Shaw said that , among those 725 , between 100 and 200 companies in the South Coast district will probably have to notify neighbors about their facility , the toxic air pollutants they emit and the health risks they might cause . The facilities will then hold public meetings to answer their neighbors ' questions and concerns . Even without notification and meetings , Shaw said , the program already has had an effect . &quot; Companies reduced because they didn ' t want to notify . . . . Let ' s face it , the public has an effect on policy. &quot; Excessive Emissions Under a regional air-pollution program , 12 San Gabriel Valley companies reported that their emissions of toxins would cause 10 or more cases of cancer among 1 million people , meaning they might need to notify their neighbors about potential health risks : A .
