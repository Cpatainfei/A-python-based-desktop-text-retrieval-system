   <HEADLINE> U.S. ESTIMATE OF BOSNIA ROLE CALLED LOW ; MILITARY : JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CHAIRMAN PUTS NUMBER OF AMERICAN TROOPS NEEDED FOR PEACE EFFORT AT 50 # 000 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff said Wednesday that the number of U.S. ground troops needed to enforce any peace accord in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be greater than the Clinton_Administration is estimating . Gen . John M . Shalikashvili warned against understating the number for political purposes . He said he believes that the enforcement effort would take about 50 # 000 troops rather than the 15 # 000 to 45 # 000 the Administration estimates . And , he said , the United States would have to provide half that total , not merely a third , as U.S. diplomats have been saying . His comments marked the first time that he has publicly taken_issue with the Administration since taking_office in October . They highlighted growing differences between the White_House and the military on the most sensitive issue in the peace process . There was no immediate reaction from the White_House or State_Department to the general ' s comments . The Administration floated the 50 # 000-troop estimate a year ago in earlier peace negotiations but has reduced the figure recently in an effort to blunt critics ' assertions that participation in peacekeeping would require a massive commitment of U.S. forces . Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff has been telling U.S. allies that fewer troops might be required if the three warring factions signed a peace accord voluntarily and that Washington would be willing to supply no more_than one-third of the total . President Clinton said at a news_conference last month that &quot; all we ever said about &quot; U.S. participation in the peacekeeping effort &quot; was that we would expect to have less than half . We never specified a specific amount. &quot; But Shalikashvili told reporters Wednesday that the estimates of a year ago are still valid and warned &quot; we must guard against sending less because we think that ' s politically more salable. &quot; He also threw cold water on suggestions by some top Administration policy-makers that the allies should expand the threat of air strikes by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization to bring peace to other parts of Bosnia , such_as Tuzla and Srebrenica . The threatened air strikes helped break the Serbian siege of Sarajevo , Bosnia ' s capital . He said Sarajevo was unusually well suited to the use of such threats because of military and political factors that do not exist in other Bosnian cities . Shalikashvili also made these points : * The peace around Sarajevo is still &quot; very fragile , &quot; and U.N. forces there must be given more troops to consolidate their gains or the situation &quot; could get_out of hand quickly. &quot; But he said that the United States should not send ground troops until there is a peace accord . * The military is trying to influence the negotiations for a peace agreement to avoid saddling peace enforcers with unrealistic restrictions -- such_as a provision in an earlier version of a peace accord that required approval by all sides just to move troops . * NATO is prepared to send ground troops to help enforce a Bosnian peace accord within days after an agreement is signed . The bulk of any U.S. troops involved would come from American units stationed in Europe , with only a_few specialized units flown from the United States . &quot; We are very confident that the military part can be put into place quickly , &quot; he said . * The most important objective facing allied forces in Bosnia is &quot; that we do not lose the balance between keeping the momentum going and overreaching. &quot; But he warned that the allies must also ensure that &quot; we ' re not too timid and lose momentum. &quot;</TEXT>
