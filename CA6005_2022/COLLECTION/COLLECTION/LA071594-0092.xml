   <HEADLINE> ON THE ISSUE : INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY ' S TOPICS ; HOW CAN WE SPEED RECOVERY FROM QUAKE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sunday marks the six-month anniversary of the disastrous magnitude 6.8 Northridge earthquake . Damaged freeways are operable , but still being repaired . Most homes and businesses either destroyed or damaged in the Jan . 17 quake are in various stages of reconstruction . But telltale rubble lies here and there in the streets , still waiting to be picked_up . Many damaged apartments and condominium complexes -- some in ruins -- stand vacant . And this week , owners of the Laurel Plaza mall in North Hollywood said some of its stores may_not reopen . Recently , the City_Council asked the Community Redevelopment Agency to establish emergency redevelopment areas so that property_taxes can be used for earthquake repairs . What should the government do to continue helping the victims of the Jan . 17 quake ? Zev Yaroslavksy , Los Angeles city councilman : &quot; The SBA has to become more responsive to the realities of the San Fernando Valley quake . While FEMA ( Federal Emergency Management Agency ) has been terrific , the SBA ( Small Business Administration ) has been virtually as rigorous as conventional services . The SBA has to be more forthcoming with resources to help businesses and apartment_buildings , not to mention single-family homes . I think the rules have to be changed and the criteria for loans have to be liberalized so that the SBA can become a positive factor_in the recovery of the San Fernando Valley and other damaged areas of the city . &quot; The City_Council this week approved the development of a redevelopment plan . We are looking_at a project in Sherman Oaks that has been reasonably well-received by the public . . . SBA has to become a constructive agent of recovery instead of a source of bureaucratic frustration. &quot; Liliana Perez , field coordinator for Project Rebound , a FEMA-sponsored agency providing crisis counseling for the mentally_ill and other recovery services : &quot; What the government needs to do is continue with the public relations and with grants to nonprofit organizations in Los Angeles County and , in my opinion , especially in the San Fernando Valley . This information should not just be in English . . . and needs to be disseminated to the school and local organizations . . . They should create more job opportunities for the youth and create more educational classes for adults on disaster preparedness . . . ( The government should also make_sure that people seeking aid ) will not be intimidated because they might not have complete , proper documentation. &quot; Scott Spooner , president of the Northridge Chamber_of_Commerce : &quot; In my opinion , FEMA and the SBA did a magnificent job in getting the information out . They probably could have done a little bit better job at coordinating . We are still getting calls from people . . . who haven ' t heard back or don ' t know where they are in the loop . What I would love to see is for the SBA or FEMA to come_out with a statement about where we are and how long do we expect to go until things are satisfied . . . A quarterly update at least through the end of the year . . . should be sent to the chambers or the communities. &quot; Marc Littman of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency : &quot; The CRA is working closely with the nine districts including the Valley to put emergency projects together . We ' re not there for the quick_fix . We pick_up where the state and federal_government leave_off . . . . By October or November , the City_Council could adopt a redevelopment plan to rebuild abandoned housing tracts and work with commercial strips like Ventura Boulevard . . . . &quot; We ' re not the Lone Ranger . But clearly , with the recent failure of the state bond measure , federal money is limited . Local_government has to do more and we ' re prepared to help with that . . . . Redevelopment can ' t be done overnight . It ' s a vehicle for focusing public and private resources to the community . . . . The main thing is we are a tool if the community wants us. &quot;</TEXT>
