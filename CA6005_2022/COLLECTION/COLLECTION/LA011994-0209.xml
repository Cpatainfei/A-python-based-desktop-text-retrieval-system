   <TEXT> For thousands of pets , as well as their owners , the earthquake was a nightmare of pain , heartache and terror . In the chaos of the hours after the quake , an untold number of dogs , cats , horses and other animals became separated from their owners , left to wander the streets , spooked by the trembling earth . Many were killed by cars and trucks on darkened roads and freeways while others became strays , their owners looking desperately for them . Perhaps nowhere was that more evident than at the West Valley Animal Shelter in Chatsworth , where a stream of animals and their owners have arrived since the quake . &quot; It ' s pandemonium out there , &quot; said Los Angeles City Animal Control Lt . Richard Felosky . &quot; It ' s terrible , the worst I ' ve ever seen . When I got here ( Monday ) the animals that were already here -- we ' ve got sheep , horses , pigs , dogs , cats , everything -- were going crazy . Some of the ( kennel ) doors had been jarred loose and some dogs were wandering around inside . Now people are coming_in nonstop with animals , or looking_for their animals , by the dozens. &quot; By late Tuesday afternoon , about 300 animals had been brought_to the shelter , and an equal number to the East Valley shelter in Van Nuys . Animal control officers also worked frantically to provide water for horses in canyon areas where utilities were out . Department of Water and Power tankers reached more_than 700 rapidly dehydrating horses . Most of the animals arriving_at shelters and clinics were brought_in by strangers . Cats had been injured by flying bricks and timbers . Dogs ' paws were sliced open as they ran in panic through broken glass . Birds had feathers torn_off as they were tossed around in their cages . &quot; We had a little hamster that was injured when a book fell on it , &quot; said Bill Thomas , co-owner of the Southern California Veterinary Hospital in Woodland Hills . Still other pets were struck by cars on darkened , unsignaled streets . Some were killed . Meanwhile , hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of pets were believed to be wandering the streets or the makeshift camps that earthquake refugees set_up in parks throughout the San Fernando Valley and the Westside . Some of the disoriented animals helped by people were normally wild ones . At the West Valley shelter , animal control officers were brought 26 opossums and one raccoon , which they released in a mountain canyon Tuesday . &quot; It ' s raining possums , &quot; said Gary Olsen , general_manager of the Department of Animal Regulation . Chris Fix , 28 , of Woodland Hills , seemed surprised when asked why he picked_up an injured female Airedale lying_in a gutter and brought the dog to the West Valley shelter in his car . &quot; There was a dog in need of help , &quot; Fix said simply . About half of the animals brought_to the West Valley shelter had been claimed by Tuesday afternoon , Felosky said . &quot; There he is ! &quot; shouted Eddie Blair , 29 , of Reseda , as he spotted his bloodhound , Red , who ran_away when a fence was knocked_down in the quake . &quot; I ' ve been looking all_over . . . . I was afraid I ' d never find him. &quot; * Others took lost pets into their homes and put_up homemade signs seeking the owners . &quot; Found , Black Dog , &quot; said one posted on Topanga Canyon Boulevard . &quot; Earthquake Cat Found , &quot; said another . &quot; Horse Found &quot; said a third . There were dozens like them . Kirsten Thye and Todd Smith put_up a sign by Topanga Canyon Boulevard asking drivers to watch for disoriented animals wandering in the traffic . &quot; Slow -- Pets Out , &quot; the sign announced in large , bright-pink letters . &quot; People just aren ' t thinking_about dogs being freaked_out and wandering in the street , &quot; said Thye , who has two dogs . &quot; We thought if we put_up the sign people might think and slow_down a little. &quot; Some panicked pets caused accidents -- and not merely when they were struck by cars . One woman rushed to Thomas ' clinic with her stricken bird , who in its distress pecked her repeatedly as she drove -- causing her to wreck her brand-new car .</TEXT>
