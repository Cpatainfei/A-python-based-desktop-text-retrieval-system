   <HEADLINE> WHY JORDAN WILL BE NEXT TO MAKE A DEAL WITH ISRAEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With Palestinian self-rule closer to becoming a reality after Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a second agreement last week , the next Middle_East breakthrough may well involve the Jewish state and Jordan . King Hussein hopes to meet &quot; before too long &quot; with Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , and during a recent visit to Washington , the Jordanian monarch reportedly confided to a group of Jewish-American leaders , &quot; I have met with all_the Israeli prime_ministers but Begin. &quot; His readiness to admit this &quot; secret &quot; is surprising , though it ' s one of the best-known &quot; secrets &quot; in the Middle_East . Truth be told , Hussein has met with most of Israel ' s prime_ministers . Even so , the king has logged more &quot; Israeli hours &quot; than any other Arab ruler . In the decade following his ascension , in 1953 , to the throne , Hussein assigned the task of conducting clandestine encounters with Israelis to his military advisers . Newly declassified State_Department documents reveal that as early as September , 1957 , Israel ' s intelligence operatives were relaying -- via the Central_Intelligence_Agency -- secret information to Jordan , warning of &quot; internal movements &quot; that sought to undermine the king ' s regime . Later on , the Mossad uncovered and then informed Amman of several plots against the king ' s life . In 1963 , Hussein felt sufficiently self-confident to meet face-to-face with Israelis . His first meeting , held_in London , was with Ya ' acov Hertzog , a top aide of Israeli Prime_Minister Levi Eshkol . The central topic was the Jordan_River . Two years later , he met with then-Foreign Minister Golda Meir in Paris , which produced a secret understanding on how to share the Jordan_River ' s water . After defeat in the 1967 War , Hussein continued to meet with his enemies , hoping to regain land lost in the fighting -- the West_Bank and East Jerusalem . In a series of meetings in London with top Israeli ministers , Hussein agreed to sign a peace_treaty in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories . The pact was never signed , because Israel refused to return all_the conquered land . Still , the two sides reached several secret understandings on such topics as aviation safety and ecological threats in the Gulf of Agaba . After Meir became prime_minister , in February , 1969 , the king accepted the Israeli explanation that because of her &quot; poor health , &quot; the sites of future talks would have to be in Israel . Some of the locations were downright exotic . One meeting took_place on an Israeli missile boat in the Gulf of Agaba , with Mossad agents posing as &quot; waiters. &quot; Altogether , between 1969 and 1973 , there were at least 10 secret meetings between Hussein and top Israeli officials , among them prime_ministers . The meetings produced some tangible results , especially in the areas of defense and intelligence . At the request of the Nixon Administration , in 1970 , Israel deterred Syrian forces from carrying_out their mission to help overthrow the Hashemite monarchy . The Syrians had invaded Jordan to assist PLO leader Yasser Arafat . Direct phone_lines were established between Israeli and Jordanian army headquarters . Intelligence on Palestinian plots to unseat Hussein were exchanged . Hussein reciprocated in September , 1973 . During a meeting with Meir , he raised the possibility of an imminent Syrian-Egyptian attack on Israel . The Israeli prime_minister ignored the tip . Two weeks later , Israeli defenses were unprepared when the invaders struck . Talks between the king and Israeli leaders soon continued . During his three years in power , Rabin , Defense Minister Shimon Peres and Foreign Minister Yigal Alon met five times with the king and his advisers . But the political stalemate remained . Hussein repeated his position that he would not settle for anything less than the entire West_Bank and East Jerusalem . The meetings came_to an end in 1977 , when Menachem Begin and his right-wing Likud came_to power . Advocating the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West_Bank , which he perceived as part of &quot; Greater Israel , &quot; Begin found no room for any compromise with Jordan . The clandestine talks resumed in 1984 , after Begin ' s sudden resignation and the formation of a Labor-Likud government . But during the seven &quot; lean &quot; years under Likud , Jordan had relinquished its responsibility over the West_Bank to the PLO . Rabin and Peres continued to meet Hussein during most of the ' 80s , but there was no place for the king in the peace process . Nonetheless , Hussein -- the second longest-serving leader in the world , after Kim Il Sung of North_Korea -- has risen , again and again , from the political ashes . The Israeli government and , to a lesser degree , the PLO realize that there is a place for Jordan in their future plans . Since Israel and the PLO signed their peace accord in September , Rabin and Peres have met at least twice with Hussein . Both sides still oppose an independent Palestinian state in their midst . For them , the ideal solution would be a confederation between the future Palestine entity and the Hashemite kingdom . Arafat has not ruled_out this possibility . One thing is clear . Once the agreements between Israel and the PLO are consolidated , Hussein will agree to end his more_than 30 years of secret diplomacy and surface in a public meeting with Israeli leaders . Such a meeting will undoubtedly produce another peace_treaty .</TEXT>
