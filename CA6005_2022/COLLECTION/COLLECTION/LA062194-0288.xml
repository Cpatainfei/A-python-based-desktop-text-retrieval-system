   <TEXT> Two-thirty in the morning . The responsibility nudges Alan Rothenberg awake , tugs him out of bed and across a hardwood floor , drops him into a leather chair at a cluttered desk . He reaches for the phone . He dials his secretary at the office . Her voice mail answers . He dictates . For the next 90 minutes he makes decisions for others who are sleeping , who will hear about them six hours later and have no idea they were issued by a man in his nightclothes . Sometimes the responsibility leads him other places . One recent night his wife , Georgina , investigated an ominous squeaking and discovered her husband riding his stationary bike . The digital clock read 3:27 a.m. &quot; I ' m lying_in bed and a_million things go_through my mind , &quot; Rothenberg says . Each one capable of staining the world ' s largest sporting event and the Los Angeles entertainment lawyer who has dared to run it . This is the responsibility that will not let Rothenberg rest , this World Cup soccer tournament he is trying to sell to a country that doesn ' t know soccer from kickball . By July 18 , as chief_executive_officer of World Cup USA 94 , Inc. , Rothenberg will have supervised 52 soccer games at nine U.S. sites . He will attempt to do_it calmly , despite international passion that can turn tailgate parties into riots . He will attempt to do_it confidently , despite many in the soccer Establishment who privately hope he trips . Underneath the monogrammed shirts and silk suits , Rothenberg , 55 , looks_like a boxer . His voice is like sandpaper , his eyes still and cold . His thick hands move with his words . &quot; You can ' t unnerve him , &quot; former law partner Ronald Silverman said . &quot; You can ' t scare him. &quot; But this , Rothenberg concedes , is different . If he succeeds , he will be able to look in a mirror and see the reincarnation of Peter Ueberroth , who was making a runaway success of the ' 84 Olympics while Rothenberg was serving as the Los Angeles Games ' commissioner of soccer . Gone forever will be those back-room days as president of the Clippers , owner of the Los Angeles Aztecs pro soccer team , lawyer for Jack Kent Cooke . But if he fails , soccer as a spectator sport in this country fails with him . Gone forever . &quot; You get so intense on the inside , &quot; Rothenberg said . &quot; But you have to stay calm on the outside . You can never let them see you panic. &quot; Some of his fears have become successes : -- Ninety-five percent of World Cup tickets have been sold , although there were distribution problems . Rothenberg says they were minimal . -- More_than $ 250 million has been collected in fees from major corporations . -- By the time the final is played July 17 at the Rose Bowl before an estimated worldwide TV_audience of 2 billion , Rothenberg said , the World Cup is expected to have netted $ 20 million for the advancement of soccer in this country . Ten years ago , the checking_account of the U.S. Soccer Federation had a balance of $ 900 . Other fears , though , have manifested themselves into enough enemies to fill a 120-yard field . In his attempt to establish a legacy for both soccer and himself , Rothenberg has offended many of those he is trying to serve . Charging him with everything from conflicts_of_interest to schoolyard bullying , many in soccer ' s Establishment have decided his price for success is too high . &quot; The man has the morals of a bandit , &quot; soccer entrepreneur Michael Hogue said . Rothenberg hears the charges and laughs . &quot; Joining the U.S. Soccer Federation was like joining the PTA , &quot; he said . Many of those who have worked closely with Rothenberg , even some who resigned to escape his combative reign as USSF President and World Cup boss , also scoff at his opponents ' credibility . The failings of the accusers , some say , represent the reason soccer needed Rothenberg in the first place . &quot; Some people are going_to say bad things about Alan Rothenberg , &quot; said Charles Kenny , a former World Cup executive . &quot; Others are going_to say good things . But you can ' t have an event of his magnitude without a man like him. &quot; Then there is agent Leigh Steinberg , who , even though he represents the U.S. team in sometimes tense negotiations with the USSF , says he has walked away from Rothenberg with one overwhelming feeling . &quot; He is the best thing to ever happen to U.S. soccer , &quot; Steinberg said . &quot; I understand what is being said about him , but you have to look_at what has happened to soccer in this country before he was in_charge . . . then what has happened since. &quot; * Eleven at night , a lower middle-class section of Detroit , a pharmacy known as Eddie ' s Drugs , 1954 . Eddie Rothenberg is the father . Alan is the 15-year-old son who spends a lot of time selling gum and sweeping floors . While walking_out the back after closing , Alan sees a gun . In seconds , he and two others are back inside , on their knees , three gunmen standing above them counting money and swinging pistols . &quot; Kneeling there with my eyes closed , I heard a thunk and a groan , a thunk and a groan , &quot; Rothenberg recalled . &quot; I was third in_line . I ' m thinking , ' God , what ' s going_to happen ? ' &quot; He had sort of the same feeling in 1990 , when he was elected president of the USSF and given one mission : make the World Cup work . It had been awarded to the United States in 1988 but there were no marketing partners , no interest , and a good chance that soccer ' s world governing body , FIFA , would move it to another country . Rothenberg , despite having played in only two soccer games in his life , did not wait to be the next one knocked in the head . Before soccer ' s car-wash and bake-sale crowd could blink , he had fired everyone from World Cup CEOs to secretaries , changed everything from marketing plans to salary structures , and basically appointed himself soccer king . &quot; Some of these people had to realize , there is a big difference between lining the field for a youth-league game and running a potentially billion-dollar business , &quot; Rothenberg said with a laugh . And those gunmen 40 years ago ? Rothenberg laughs about them , too . They left a scar on the back of his head with the butt of a gun . But several weeks later he spotted their pictures in a newspaper -- he said he had been so frightened he would never forget those faces -- and they were soon in jail . Rothenberg learned then that there was nothing wrong with a little fear . As long as you know how to use it . Said Ron Newman , coach of the San Diego Sockers professional team : &quot; Everybody says this guy is using soccer to promote his own interests . . . . I say , ' Hey , we ' re also using him . ' This guy has his whole career on the line . He cannot afford to fail. &quot; But some have decided it ' s not a fair trade . They say he is working not for soccer ' s fortunes , for which he had little concern four years ago , but for his own fortunes . &quot; Some of the things he has done are . . . morally wrong , &quot; said Louis Palivos , president of the Illinois State Soccer Federation and a candidate in the coming USSF presidential elections . Among the things that have many upset : -- The six-figure salaries and about $ 15 million in bonuses and severance pay that top_executives of nonprofit World Cup USA 94 , Inc. , are receiving . This includes an anticipated $ 3-million bonus for Rothenberg for his &quot; volunteer &quot; efforts . Rothenberg has already taken_out a $ 300 # 000 loan against that bonus , according to World Cup Board_members . -- Rothenberg not only is taking_over World Cup USA 94 , but also a proposed new major soccer league , even though he was elected president of only one organization , the USSF . -- An attempt by Rothenberg to bill World Cup for his hours in the name of his law_firm . Rothenberg says that his firm of Latham &amp; Watkins was never paid_for his time spent on World Cup business , but sources have told The Times that on one occasion he tried to bill World Cup for time spent on television negotiations and was rebuffed . -- Rothenberg ' s standard practice of flying first_class and staying in suites . &quot; This is still a charity . . . and I just don ' t think anyone should fly first_class in a charity , &quot; said Richard Groff , USSF treasurer who is also running against Rothenberg in the August elections . * Two in the afternoon . Rummaging through that day ' s mail , oil salesman Allen Gilmore has discovered a surprise check for $ 4 # 300 from the M &amp; M / Mars company . Gilmore , the president of the state soccer federation in Wyoming , earlier had received a check of $ 5 # 000 from Adidas . There was a time , he said , that &quot; people in the U.S. Soccer Federation didn ' t even know Wyoming existed. &quot; Today , because of sponsorship deals nurtured by Rothenberg , Gilmore is able to offer college scholarships to his state ' s junior soccer players for the first time . &quot; Alan has turned everything around , &quot; Gilmore said . &quot; If he wants to run everything involved with soccer in this country -- and keep bringing_in money -- I ' d be tickled to death. &quot; Not every Rothenberg story , though , has such a happy ending . Ask Hogue , a Torrance businessman who produces soccer games and is the agent for U.S. player Hugo Perez . Unhappy with the state of soccer here , Hogue and brother Skip raised $ 49 # 000 and spent nine months organizing a campaign to elect an unknown outsider as USSF president in 1990 . The outsider was Rothenberg , whom Hogue and others claim promised to make him the U.S. team ' s general_manager . Later , after Hogue had helped build the training facility in Mission Viejo , he says he was promised an opportunity to run it . Today , Hogue is weighing a lawsuit against Rothenberg , who he says reneged_on both promises . &quot; Alan Rothenberg ' s word means nothing , &quot; Hogue said . &quot; His regard for the truth is a joke. &quot; Rothenberg said he never promised Hogue anything . &quot; I can deal with a lot of images . . . but ( Hogue ) just never worked_out , &quot; Rothenberg said . As varied as Casper , Wyo. , and Torrance , the paradoxes of Rothenberg ' s last four years cling_to him like annoying lint . Behind his back , some of the World Cup ' s 400 paid employees call him &quot; Rothenweiler. &quot; But this is the same man who once hired a helicopter to transport him from a World Cup function to a nephew ' s bar_mitzvah because he didn ' t want to disappoint the youngster . This is the same man whose wife gets teary-eyed when she talks_about a 34-year marriage that has survived the pressures of Hollywood . Then there is the Rothenberg who , upon firing Charles Cale as World Cup CEO at the end of 1991 , failed to offer Cale ' s secretary another position , contrary to most standard business practices . Sophia Alvarado , one of the first two World Cup employees in Los Angeles , needed six months after her severance pay ran_out to find a full-time job to help support her two children . &quot; Chuck was fired and they gave me no options , &quot; she said . &quot; Alan never even spoke_to me. &quot; Said Rothenberg : &quot; I don ' t beat_up people because I enjoy beating_up people . . . but if I have to leave some strewn bodies in_order to win , within the rules , that ' s the way you have to do it. &quot; * Eight at night , an Orlando hotel , the USSF general meeting in August of 1990 . While Rothenberg sits at a dinner on the night before his election as USSF president , his campaign workers are up_to dirty tricks . In a story corroborated by several others , Los Angeles businessman Paul Hinkley said workers used tweezers to remove clippings of a damaging newspaper story about Rothenberg that had been slipped under hundreds of hotel doors . Hinkley , who said he also spied on the opposition for Rothenberg , is another who claims World Cup organizers failed to find him a full-time job , as promised . Rothenberg , who denies any knowledge of dirty tricks , admittedly would n ' t have even run_for office except for the influence offered by FIFA , soccer ' s powerful governing body . &quot; I never would have gone_for that office if its wasn ' t for the World Cup , &quot; Rothenberg said . With attitudes like these , he was immediately mistrusted by many of the 3.5 million mostly working-class soccer volunteers he represented . They are the sort of people he grew_up with , but left . Rothenberg spent his first 21 years near downtown Detroit , in a modest three-bedroom home that housed seven people , including a grandmother . His mother , Bebe , pushed him to expand his mind beyond the family-owned pharmacy . His father quietly pulled_at him to remain close to his roots . After graduating from the University of Michigan law_school with top honors , he listened to his mother and headed for California . When he and Georgina drove_off , his father turned his head so his son would n ' t see him cry . &quot; Detroit seemed a little confining , &quot; Rothenberg said . &quot; If you were from the right family , or from the right background , you would get certain breaks . If you ' re not , you don ' t -- and we weren ' t . &quot; I was a nobody in Detroit. &quot; The soccer community says he runs the World Cup as if he has forgotten those roots . They point to the time that , while pushing the proposed Major_League Soccer , Rothenberg flew to Oregon to meet with the renowned Nike CEO , Phillip Knight . Nike sources say Rothenberg did not have an appointment and that Knight was scheduled to be in Europe then . When a receptionist refused to admit him , Rothenberg said that as the leader of the World Cup , he was not leaving until Knight recognized his presence . Knight , who coincidentally had canceled his trip and was in his office , finally met with him . Staffers also twitter about a memo from Rothenberg urging everyone to help him rise on the Sporting News ' annual list of the 100 most powerful people in sports . In 1991 he was ranked 86th . Last year , he was unranked . &quot; I didn ' t care if that ( publication ) thinks I ' m a jerk , this was not about me , but about my position , &quot; Rothenberg said . &quot; I was pushing our people to get Sporting News to recognize the World Cup ' s impact in this country. &quot; Said former partner Silverman , &quot; Other tough_guys can deliver their tough messages with a little more subtlety. &quot; This includes his approach to salaries . Although Rothenberg turned_down an offer from his board of directors to pay him $ 300 # 000 a year , the salary of his top assistant has rankled many . Scott LeTellier , the No . 2 person at World Cup , is making $ 210 # 000 in salary this year with a bonus package that includes a $ 40 # 000 allowance for country-club dues and a $ 1 # 225 monthly car allowance . In addition , LeTellier will be paid_for nine months after the completion of the World Cup , and will also be paid moving expenses to any of the 48 contiguous states for up_to 18 months after the event . Included in that moving package are 12 round-trip_tickets anywhere on the U.S. mainland , with a promise of payment for first-class upgrade coupons . &quot; I think the USSF is a charity , and as a charity , our priority must be developing the program , &quot; said Groff , the USSF treasurer . &quot; Too often , we are developing perks. &quot; Rothenberg , whose current estimates of a $ 20-million profit are 20 % less than his quoted estimates in published reports last year , defends the salaries and perks . &quot; We are working with a $ 400-million budget , and we are only paying market_value -- less in some cases -- for some of the people we have to have , &quot; he said . Through it all , Rothenberg continues to work 20-hour days while defending his reputation as a man who gets things done . He has a back condition that sometimes causes him such pain that he lies_down in airports . Yet he was recently strong enough to open the doors of the White_House , where he became the first U.S. soccer official in recent memory to have a personal meeting with the President . &quot; I do care what people think_about me , care about the community , care about what is left_behind , &quot; he said . &quot; But ultimately , I ' ve got a job to do. &quot; And ultimately , that job is soccer . Rothenberg laughs when recalling his two encounters on the field , both with employees during the 1984 Olympics . In the first game , he said , he stood outside the penalty area in front of_his_own team ' s goal and played the thug . &quot; I told them I would stand_out there and knock people down , and that ' s what I did , &quot; he said . In the second game , he moved_up to forward , ran in front of a crossing pass , and had no idea what to do with it . Unnerved ? Scared ? &quot; I didn ' t know what to do with the ball , and it was coming right at me , and . . . &quot; Rothenberg stuck_out his belly . The ball hit it and bounced into the net . His employees fell to the ground in laughter . By the time they had risen , Rothenberg had already walked_off the field , caring nothing about how he looked and everything about how he had scored .</TEXT>
