   <TEXT> In 1980 , after Portuguese runner Rosa Mota had been competing successfully for half_a_dozen years , something went inexplicably wrong . In races where she should have been finishing among the top three , she began placing 12th or 13th . Her legs felt dead . She just couldn ' t get them to move . She went_to doctors , but they couldn ' t figure it out . They told her it was psychological . They told her she was too old ( she was 21 ) and past her prime and should quit racing . Jose Pedrosa , her coach and companion , who was fresh out of medical_school , had his own theory . He thought her difficulties might be respiratory related , even though she wasn ' t having any obvious breathing problems . He turned_out to be right : She had suddenly developed exercise-induced asthma . Generally , asthma is a disease characterized by a reversible obstruction -- a temporary blockage -- of the bronchial airways , the tubes through which people breathe . The blockage results from inflammation and mucus in the airways , the contraction of the muscles that surround the airways and airway swelling . In most cases , it is triggered by any number of things , including irritants such_as tobacco smoke , a cold , allergens ( pollen , dust , animal dander ) or certain foods . When exercise is the catalyst , it is called exercise-induced asthma , or exercise-induced bronchospasm . It is a most peculiar affliction , where the symptoms can either be subtle , as they were with Mota , or very obvious . When symptoms are apparent , they typically strike after three to eight minutes of strenuous exercise : chest tightness , coughing , shortness of breath , even dry throat , stomachache and headache . It can last for up_to 15 or 20 minutes , and it can affect athletic performance . &quot; I was diagnosed just after the 1988 Olympic trials , &quot; says U.S. marathoner Kim Jones . &quot; I was running and just couldn ' t race . I couldn ' t take a deep breath , and I was wheezing . It was a terrible claustrophobic feeling . I actually panicked. &quot; It is not a new phenomenon . Several centuries ago , physicians were writing_about the effect of exercise on breathing . Modern medical literature described exercise-induced asthma in adults at least 50 years ago , and it has been about 30 years since experts reported similar symptoms in children . But it has been only in recent years that the condition has begun to attract increasing attention -- in part because so many well-known athletes have developed it or have begun to speak about it . They include marathoners like Jones and Mota -- who went_on to win the 1987 world track_and_field championships marathon , two Boston marathons and the 1988 Olympic race . Also Janis Klecker , a member of the 1992 Olympic team , and Joan Benoit Samuelson , who in 1984 won the first Olympic women ' s marathon in Los Angeles ; Jackie Joyner-Kersee , who earned a silver medal in the 1984 Games , two gold medals in the 1988 Games , a gold in the 1992 Games , and won the long_jump and heptathlon in the 1987 world championships . Others include swimmer Nancy Hogshead and basketball_player Danny Manning . In fact , 11 % of the athletes who competed in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles had some form of exercise-induced asthma , and 1988 Olympic athletes with the condition included five gold medalists , 10 silver medalists and one bronze medalist . But exercise-induced asthma can strike anyone and can begin at any age , just like regular asthma . The American Academy of Allergy and Immunology has estimated that up_to 15 % of the population suffers from exercise-induced asthma , including at least 40 % of those with hay fever-type allergies and up_to 95 % of individuals who already have regular asthma . An estimated 12 million Americans have asthma , and more_than 22 million suffer from allergic_rhinitis ( hay fever. ) &quot; Exercise is one of the most common precipitants of acute asthma seen in clinical practice , &quot; says Dr. Gary S . Rachelefsky , director of the Allergy Research Foundation and a clinical professor of pediatrics at the UCLA School_of_Medicine . &quot; This occurs in people of all ages , although it is more common in children because of their increased physical activity. &quot; It typically occurs when airway obstruction increases after three to eight minutes of a vigorous workout . &quot; You can have increasing symptoms over the next five to 10 minutes , and then it goes_away . . . usually within an hour , &quot; Rachelefsky says . Occasionally , however , &quot; it can become serious and lead to hospitalization. &quot; * Experts believe the attack occurs because exercise often involves breathing through the mouth , which introduces cool , dry air . During exercise , the person hyperventilates by taking rapid , shallow breaths . Hyperventilation cools the airways . A reflex reaction to the cooling of the airways can trigger an asthma_attack . ( Breathing through the nose , on the other hand , helps warm and humidify the air before it reaches the bronchial tubes. ) The condition seems to be at its worst when the weather is cold and dry . Not surprisingly , runners , cyclists , ice skaters and cross-country skiers suffer more_than swimmers , who are inhaling moist air from just above the waterline . Exercise-induced asthma can be very subtle , as it was with Mota -- with some people not even being aware of it , except in their performance -- or it can be quite severe , as it was with Jones . &quot; It ' s a variant of asthma , but some people don ' t even consider asthma , ' says Dr. David Tinkelman , an Atlanta allergist who has studied exercise-induced asthma in high-performance Olympic marathon and 10 # 000-meter runners . &quot; They say : ' I ' m in great shape . I don ' t have a problem . Just this tightness when I run , ' &quot; Tinkelman adds . &quot; Well it does exist , but it can exist without people being aware of it. &quot; Tinkelman studied elite athletes to see whether long-term use of anti-inflammatory agents -- which attack the underlying inflammation of the airways -- can alleviate the problem and , as a result , enhance performance . Use of these drugs , known as inhaled corticosteroids , is often standard asthma therapy but is not routinely used to treat the exercise-induced kind . &quot; Yes , it did help high-level athletes , &quot; he says , adding most of them improved their performance times using the therapy -- although he says he would n ' t recommend the regimen for average or recreational athletes . * There are established ways of preventing exercise-induced asthma through medication and other means , experts say . Athletes who suffer from the condition are usually encouraged to exercise in warm , humid air , or to take_up water_sports . If this is not possible , it helps to use a scarf or face_mask when working_out in cold , dry weather . This allows the athlete to breathe air that has been warmed . Because the condition can subside for two to three hours after an initial episode , elite athletes , such_as Joyner-Kersee , routinely provoke an attack through wind sprints or another vigorous warm-up right before competition so they will not be hampered during the event . &quot; You have it a little bit , and then it goes_away for an hour or more , &quot; Rachelefsky says . Many athletes with the condition also routinely use inhaled medications known as bronchodilators before exercise . These include beta-2 agonists , cromolyn sodium or both . These drugs provide symptomatic relief and thus far are not among those substances banned in international competition . Rachelefsky adds that if someone is in the middle of a marathon or another event , it is often wise just to keep going when an attack hits -- run_through it -- because it will almost always go_away . &quot; If you stop , it can get_worse , so don ' t stop , &quot; he says . &quot; Sometimes that ' s hard to do , but it works. &quot; This is the approach Jones takes when she runs a marathon -- a 26.2-mile event that the world ' s swiftest women typically complete in less than 2 1 / 2 hours . &quot; I do go_out fairly hard and I go_through a mild attack , &quot; she says . &quot; Then I back_off , but keep running . Then I take_off after I ' m breathing efficiently again . I ' ve learned to adapt. &quot;</TEXT>
