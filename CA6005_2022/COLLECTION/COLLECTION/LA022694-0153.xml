   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; NOTEBOOK ; GERMAN WINS GOLD IN WOMEN ' S 5 # 000 , BUT NOT NIEMANN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German speedskater Gunda Niemann isn ' t going_home empty-handed from her last Olympics , but there won ' t be any gold in her satchel . The skater who was expected to dominate the women ' s distance events here missed again Friday , tiring badly in the 5 # 000-meter event and finishing second to teammate Claudia Pechstein . &quot; Close , but I didn ' t make_it , &quot; Niemann said . &quot; Claudia was_better today. &quot; Niemann finished the Games with the silver , a bronze in the 1 # 500 and a DNF in the 3 # 000 , the race that started her problems here . She fell_in that one , the first of the women ' s five races . Niemann won gold in the 3 # 000 and 5 # 000 , and silver in the 1 # 500 , in the Albertville Games two years ago . In winning her first gold medal , Pechstein cut nearly 20 seconds off her personal best and finished in 7 minutes 14.37 seconds . Hiromi Yamamoto of Japan was third . * Russia won its third biathlon gold medal in the women ' s 30-kilometer relay , taking_advantage of two lapses on the rifle_range by Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm , favored Germany ' s third skier . The Russians -- Nadejda Talanova , Natalia Snytina , Louiza Noskova and Anfisa Reztsova -- won in 1 hour 47 minutes 19.5 seconds , all four shooting perfect scores , which meant no penalty loops to ski . Biathlon combines target shooting with cross-country_skiing . Greiner-Petter-Memm missed three times shooting prone , then missed three more times from the standing position and had to ski a 150-meter penalty loop for each miss . Her team finished nearly four minutes behind the Russians in second place . France , the defending Olympic champion , took the bronze and host Norway was fourth . The U.S. team was a surprising eighth in the 17-team field , the best any American team or individual has done_in Nordic events here . Competing for the U.S. were Beth Coats of Breckenridge , Colo. ; Joan Smith of Honeoye Falls , N.Y. ; Laura Tavares of Lake Placid , N.Y. , and Joan Guetschow of Minnetonka , Minn . * Espen the Eagle ? Norwegian ski_jumper Espen Bredesen didn ' t take_kindly_to that nickname at Albertville two years ago , when he was struggling with a change in jumping styles , and he still doesn ' t like it as an Olympic gold- and silver-medal winner . &quot; It was meant a little different when they said it in Albertville , &quot; he said . And indeed it was . It was a none-too-flattering comparison of Bredesen to England ' s Michael ( Eddie the Eagle ) Edwards , the semi-blind Englishman who as a ski_jumper at Calgary in 1988 was a pretty good house_painter . &quot; I don ' t like it any better now , &quot; Bredesen said after winning the 90-meter hill championship . &quot; I don ' t think I should be compared to Eddie the Eagle. &quot; * Speedskater Dan Jansen , who ended years of Olympic frustration when he won the men ' s 1 # 000 meters Feb . 18 , will carry the flag for the U.S. team Sunday at the closing ceremony . &quot; It ' s an honor because it seems very appropriate to end my Olympic career with something like this , &quot; Jansen said . &quot; It ' s a different honor than winning a medal , because it ' s something that ' s been voted on by my teammates . I ' ve enjoyed these Games more_than any of the others and this is a fitting way to end it. &quot; * Norway ' s medal outburst Friday -- three in Alpine combined skiing and two in ski_jumping , moved the host country into the overall lead , where it figures to remain . Norway has 25 medals , Russia 22 . Norway , however , has medal prospects in Sunday ' s men ' s slalom and today ' s 50k men ' s cross-country ski_race . Russia has medal prospects in hockey and the men ' s biathlon relay . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
