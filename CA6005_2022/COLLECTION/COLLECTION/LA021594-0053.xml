   <HEADLINE> THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD : VIOLENCE SHOULD HAVE NO PLACE IN PLAYOFFS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Let ' s hope that the high_school basketball playoffs , which begin today , are without any of the ugly incidents that have occurred this season . There have been too many cases of unnecessary shoving , punches thrown and benches cleared . Coaches have become too abusive to officials , and in some cases , to each other . High_school basketball in the Southland is looking more like the game on the collegiate and professional levels , and we are not talking_about the caliber of play . There are numerous examples : --Last month , assistant boys ' coaches at Santa Ana Mater Dei and Dana Hills got_into a fight before a game and had to be separated by campus police at UC Irvine . --A week later , Dean Bradshaw , boys ' coach at Simi Valley , was suspended for grabbing one of his players and shoving him to the floor during a game against Westlake . Bradshaw is suspended for the season . --Three weeks ago , players , coaches and fans came onto the court of a boys ' game between Gardena Serra and Santa Monica St . Monica . One parent was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon . --A similar incident took_place last Tuesday in a boys ' game between Riverside Poly and Riverside Rubidoux . A fight involving players , coaches and fans broke_out in the third quarter , and officials called the game . --The Long_Beach St . Anthony boys ' team had violent incidents at two of its games last week , and Southern Section officials are investigating . Punishments have been left to the individual schools and leagues and have ranged from suspensions to reprimands . In most cases , however , they have not been tough enough . Sitting_out one game for fighting is too easy . How about five games ? Fans who get involved in tussles should be barred from the gymnasium for the rest of the season . Coaches who fight or are thrown_out of the games should sit_out at least a week . &quot; You hope high_school sports can be different than the rest of our society , &quot; said Mike Vanta , boys ' basketball_coach at Riverside Poly . &quot; But I think that may be a little wishful thinking. &quot; * Three days after his son set a national prep record for most three-point shots in a game , Stan Bickley was not offering any apologies . &quot; The team wanted Chad to get the state record for three-pointers , &quot; said Bickley , boys ' basketball_coach at Santa Maria Valley Christian . &quot; We didn ' t really think or imagine anything beyond that. &quot; Chad Bickley , a 6-foot junior point guard , made 20 of 35 three-point attempts and finished with 89 points in a 130-48 victory over Cuyama Valley at Valley Christian . The 20 three-pointers is a national record , the 89 points a state record . Chad ' s previous high was 39 points . &quot; We only have eight players and they all played , &quot; Stan Bickley said . &quot; We didn ' t press_on defense and we didn ' t try to run_up the score . We would have scored that many points whether Chad played the whole game or not . It was never our intention to rub their nose in it. &quot; * The Brea-Olinda girls ' basketball_team , which has won three consecutive state titles , enters the Southern Section playoffs this week on a roll . The Ladycats ( 25-0 ) have won their last five games by an average margin of 75 points . It started with a 112-23 victory over Anaheim on Feb . 1 and ended with a 110-16 victory over Anaheim Savanna last Thursday . Coach John Hattrup , who replaced Mark Trakh last summer , said he is not embarrassed by the big margins . &quot; The sad thing is that most people look_at those scores and assume we ' re just running_up the score , &quot; Hattrup said . &quot; And that ' s not at all true. &quot; Hattrup said all 12 of his players get_into most games and the reserves often score more points than the starters . In lopsided games , starters are normally pulled_in the second quarter . Hattrup said his reserves are better than most starters on other teams , a sentiment echoed by opposing coaches . &quot; I think Brea ' s junior varsity team would be a strong contender in our league , &quot; said Lori Giroux , Anaheim ' s coach . &quot; Their program is just that good. &quot; * College recruiters are finally knocking_on the door of Sarah Hagman , a senior basketball_player at Crescenta Valley . They are coming_to watch the 5-foot-9 guard , who has been setting various three-point shooting records this season . The latest occurred Wednesday , when Hagman made four three-point baskets in a victory over Pasadena . That gave her 115 for the season , breaking the Southern Section record of 112 set by Amee Pina of Chino last year . The state record is 169 , set by Danielle Vigilone of Fair Oaks Del Campo in 1992 . Hagman also holds the Southern Section record for most three-point shots in a game with 13 against Arcadia last month . Prep Notes The Lakewood boys ' basketball_team finished second in the powerful Moore League , but won ' t be in the playoffs because it used an ineligible player all season . The Lancers had to forfeit all_of their victories . . . . More_than 1 # 000 high_school athletes will compete in the Sunkist Invitational track_meet Saturday at the Sports Arena , starting at noon . . . . Eleanor Dykstra , girls ' basketball_coach at Cerritos Valley Christian , improved to 400-86 last Thursday with a victory over Orange Lutheran .
