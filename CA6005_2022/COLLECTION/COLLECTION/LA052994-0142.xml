   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIME INTERVIEW ; EDOUARD BALLADUR ; DEFENDING FRENCH CULTURE FROM INVADING AMERICANS BY SCOTT KRAFT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Jacques Chirac led the Gaullist conservatives to an overwhelming victory in national elections last year , he had his eye on a bigger prize -- the presidency . Unfortunately , the sitting president , Francois Mitterrand , planned to keep the job until his term expired in 1995 . So the conservatives devised a cunning , though politically risky strategy . They selected Edouard Balladur , one of Chirac ' s oldest friends , a modest man without presidential aspirations or thundering charisma , to take the job of prime_minister , the nation ' s second-most-powerful job . That way , they figured , Chirac would be free to run_for president while the mild-mannered Balladur , a seasoned politician , attempted to &quot; cohabit &quot; with Mitterrand and grapple with the domestic problems . But , to the surprise of many and to the dismay of Chirac , Balladur has in just a year on_the_job become the odds-on favorite to replace Mitterrand , a Socialist , in the country ' s highest office . The 65-year-old prime_minister ' s popularity has baffled political analysts , journalists and even his own colleagues . Analysts say Balladur ' s popularity stems , in part , from his relative anonymity . Although a career government official , whose jobs included chief_of_staff to President Georges Pompidou in the 1970s , Balladur was not well-known to most voters . And many in France were looking_for a fresh face . Balladur is known for his formality and his courtesy , characteristics that have helped him stay out of range of the arrows frequently fired by his opponents . As he sat for a rare interview at Matignon , the prime_minister ' s office on the Left_Bank of Paris , he wore a tailored , Saville Row suit and kept the jacket buttoned . He is not a large man , standing just 5-foot-7 , and he wears his thinning gray hair combed back . Balladur usually arrives_at his office around 7:30 a.m. and leaves at 8 p.m. , heading back to his home across the Seine_River in the up-scale 16th arrondisement . He and his wife , Marie-Josephe , married for 29 years , have four grown sons . Born in Turkey to a well-to-do French banker , Balladur earned a degree from the Ecole Nationale d ' Administration , the school of France ' s bureaucratic elite . He understands English , but prefers to speak in French . &quot; I have a complex with English , &quot; he explained . &quot; I don ' t like to appear ridiculous. &quot; Though an unabashed protector of things French , the prime_minister is fond of the United States and Americans . Under his guidance , the government is spending millions of dollars this year on D-Day landing ceremonies . And , at the government ' s invitation , President Bill_Clinton will become only the second foreigner in decades to address Parliament next month . * Question : Many Americans , and many people in Southern California where the film_industry is primarily based , are beginning to believe that France wants to close its cultural doors to competition . What ' s your feeling ? Answer : Yes . Yesterday , Ted Turner was in this office and we talked_about that . I think there is one thing that must be understood : We are strongly against a uniform world culture with one single world language . We the_French consider that we have a great culture and a great civilization language and that it ' s perfectly legitimate that we should defend our culture . I forget what the exact percentages are , but American films have much more_than 50 % of the_French market . And French films in the United States are just a_few percentage_points . So I think really the question is for me to put to you . Q : Maybe you should put it to Ted Turner . A : I said the same thing to Ted Turner , and he agreed with me that we need a diversity of culture worldwide . Q : The question is , though , can you protect it by legislation , by law ? A : I think one can , yes . And it ' s our firm intention to do so . Now , this brings_up a problem . It ' s really a problem of principle . Should world progress only spring from the law of the markets ? And that applies to everything . Economy , trade , culture . If that is the case , then nations are no longer of any use . We could just &quot; leave it to nature , &quot; so to speak . As you know , the tendency of nature is that the strongest become stronger , and the weakest become weaker . The basis of civilizations is their struggle against nature . That is the basis of education , of religion , of democracy , of law . So , it is a civilization endeavor that we are engaged in . It ' s a bit of a paradox . Q : that ' s pretty philosophical . A : ( laughs ) It ' s an interesting idea , you might say . I don ' t know if you can put that in your newspaper . Q : What baffles many Americans is why France , such a powerful country and with such a rich culture , needs laws to protect its culture and its language . The French didn ' t need to protect their culture in the 19th Century . A : There are two different aspects . First is the language and , secondly , there is what you might call the cultural industry . As for the language itself , this is not something new we are doing . Three and a half centuries ago , the Academie Francaise was set_up ( to protect the language ) . It ' s not something my government has thought_up that is new . One has to have an open mind on this . Words like le weekend are part of the_French language now . The only thing is , you shouldn ' t overdo this . When the precise French word exists , there ' s no point in not using it . Q : And culture ? A : What is more interesting , really , is the cultural industry , the cultural economy , if you like . You ' re perfectly right . In the 19th Century , this wasn ' t necessary , nor at the beginning of the 20th Century . But cultural activity has become a very big consumer product . It ' s true of books , films , shows . It needs a market to live . And a country whose territory isn ' t big enough needs to help those cultural activities , to give them what the market cannot provide . It ' s a problem you don ' t have in the United States , because the market is already there . You have almost 300 million consumers of cultural products . But it is a problem in Europe , and especially in European_countries that don ' t use English as a national language . The inadequacy of the market has caused a certain number of film_industries to almost completely disappear in Europe . Luckily , the_French film_industry still exists , but I think it exists only thanks to this machinery that we have . And that ' s why you have to correct market forces . If we had a Francophone market with 300 million people , then we would n ' t need to have this machinery . But your products and your cultural activities already pay_for themselves in the U.S. market , and , therefore , they can be exported at a very low cost . We can ' t do that . So I think it ' s a consequence of the fact that France is smaller than the United States , both in geographical terms and in population . Q : Do you watch films or television ? A : Television , yes . I do look_at films sometimes on television . I don ' t go_to the cinema often because people recognize me on the streets . Q : What do you like ? A : I like sentimental films . Q : Such_as ? A : I like &quot; Dr. Zhivago , &quot; &quot; Gone With the Wind , &quot; &quot; Love Story. &quot; They are very pretty films . I don ' t like horror movies . Q : Action pictures ? A : Yes , I like a good war film . I like comedies . I don ' t like sad pictures , even though &quot; Love_Story &quot; is sad and &quot; Dr. Zhivago &quot; is sad , too , in the end . But they are very beautiful films . I recently saw Bertolucci ' s &quot; The Last Emperor. &quot; It was an excellent film . Q : Clint Eastwood was recently honored by the_French culture minister for his work in films . That kind of thing is confusing to many Americans . The French seem to like Hollywood films , but the government seems to not want them to like those films . A : that ' s not at all it . First of all , Clint Eastwood would n ' t have had his declaration if the government hadn ' t agreed . But you need both . We like American films . I ' m very fond of American films and American actors and actresses . There are some very fine actors . But it doesn ' t mean that they should be the only ones on the screens . They have a monopoly . We also were a very powerful country in the past , and our tendency at the time , probably , was also to consider that French language and French culture excluded all others . Now history has moved . Things have changed . And things will go_on changing . One day you ( Americans ) may have to defend yourself against Chinese films . Q : Speaking of that reduction in French power . Is it difficult for the_French to accept a lesser role in world affairs ? A : I think the_French people have gotten used to this for a number of years . But at_the_same_time , I think at the heart of every Frenchman there is a feeling that his civilization has a worldwide value . It ' s a heritage we get from the_French Revolution . At the heart of all French men and women is the feeling , perhaps , that they embody an international value , related to principles , to rules , to laws , to behavior . If you look_at our colonial past , it essentially consisted_of seeing_to_it that the largest possible number of populations were able to join the_French model of civilization . There are two ways of looking_at that phenomenon . You can say that it was generosity , if you like . But you can also say it was a sort of imperialism . You can say both and there probably is a bit of truth in both , anyway . So , basically , France considers that she has a special mission in the service of peace and human_rights . That doesn ' t mean she always fulfills that mission in a proper way , but she tries to do_it . Q : So France feels a world responsibility , much in the way the United States does . A : Yes , but in the United States , you have public-opinion reactions that are somewhat contradictory . Some people say , &quot; Why aren ' t you doing something in this or that country ? &quot; and others say , &quot; Why did you try to deal with another country ' s problems when you have problems of_your_own at_home ? &quot; American public_opinion oscillates between those two attitudes . Q : A few months ago , President Clinton suggested that America should try to strengthen its economic ties with Asia rather than focus only on Europe . Does that worry you ? A : I do not share your analysis . If he shows a bigger overture to Asia , such an evolution seems to me to be natural . It ' s the same for us . We are more interested in Asia than 10 years ago . It should not be interpreted as U.S. disinterest in Europe . We often forget in Europe that a seashore of your country is turned toward the Pacific , and that your interest in Asia is ancient and constant . But it does not constitute an alternative to the privileged relations that have to go_on between the two seashores of the Atlantic . Q : How are relations between France and the United States at the moment ? A : I am satisfied by the state of Franco-American relations now , and optimistic about their future . France and the United States base their relations on identical , fundamental interests . We have always found solutions to our temporary problems without affecting the privileged character of our alliance , which has seen our countries side_by_side in major crises . This was true in the time of Gen . ( Charles ) de Gaulle , during the Cuban missile crisis , and it was even more true during the Gulf War . The celebration of D-Day in Normandy next month will give us the opportunity to again celebrate an important page of our common history. *</TEXT>
