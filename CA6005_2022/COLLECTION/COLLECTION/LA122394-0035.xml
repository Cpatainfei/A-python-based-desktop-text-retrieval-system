   <HEADLINE> TO BOLSTER CALIFORNIA ' S RECOVERY , LOWER THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX BURDEN ; ECONOMY : THE CORPORATE BITE IS 60 % ABOVE THE NATIONAL NORM AND THE WEST ' S HIGHEST , WHILE COMPETITOR STATES ARE BOOMING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s economic recovery is_well under way . But a major source of California ' s growth in the 1980s -- the revolution in computers and communications -- has made businesses across the country footloose : The new plant need not be near the old one ; the plants need not be located near the corporate headquarters . States are competing more and more to attract new enterprises and keep the pieces of the ones they have . In this environment , California ' s high taxes put it at a disadvantage . The tax on corporations , at 9.3 % , is the same as Arizona ' s , but higher than that of New Mexico ( 7.6 % ) , Oregon ( 6.6 % ) and Utah ( 5 % ) . The state of Washington ? Zero . Nevada ? Zip . Texas ? The same . In corporate tax dollars collected per $ 100 of personal_income ( the relative measure that ' s usually used ) , California is fifth in the nation , first among its Western competition and more_than 60 % above the 50-state average . The competition is tough on the personal income-tax score . Washington and Nevada have no tax on personal_income ( neither does Texas ) . California imposes a tax of up_to 11 % on personal_incomes , the highest marginal rate ( although scheduled to decline to 9.3 % Jan . 1 , 1996 ) of any state except Massachusetts and Montana . In dollars collected per $ 100 of personal_income , California was 15th in the nation in 1993 -- 27 % above the 50-state average . The overall tax burden per household in California is 19 % above the national average . There was a time when economists found no relationship between state taxes and economic_growth . State and local taxes were low enough to be swamped by other important influences -- labor availability , infrastructure and so forth . But the state and local tax burdens have risen steadily and are increasingly becoming a significant cost to business , either as a tax on profits or through their influence on the cost of labor . More recent studies show that states that have cut their tax burdens have stronger economic_growth than those that have increased them . The changes in tax burden seem to signal a favorable or a hostile environment , what the executives making locational decisions call the &quot; tax climate. &quot; And the tax climate ranks second only to labor availability and labor costs ( which are themselves affected by taxes ) in determining location . The danger for California is the possibility that the recent economic upturn is merely a cyclical upswing , not a strengthening of the basic economic structure . The communications revolution has made_it easier for the structure of an economy to change -- easier for new enterprises and new jobs to move_in , but also easier for them to move_out . Thus the decline in the national defense budget is not fatal for California ; with appropriate policies , California , with all its other advantages , can attract new businesses . In the same way , it can lose more_than its defense industries . In the year ending this past September , California ranked 49th among the states in growth in non-farm employment , actually losing jobs while its Western competition added them . Non-farm employment increased 6.7 % in Utah , 6 % in Nevada . New Mexico was up 5.2 % , Arizona 4.4 % and Oregon and Texas 3.1 % All of these states have tax burdens less than California ' s . If California is to compete effectively , it must lower its tax_rates significantly .</TEXT>
