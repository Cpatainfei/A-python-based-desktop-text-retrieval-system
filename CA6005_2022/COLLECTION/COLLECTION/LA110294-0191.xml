   <TEXT> Are you a horseplayer ? A Buddhist ? A fiend for needlework ? An emigre pining for Seoul ? There ' s a place for you in cyberspace , but it may_not be the place you think . Everyone is always talking_about the Internet , and sign-up forms for America Online seem to flutter out of every magazine . But in all_the hubbub about the burgeoning information highway , it ' s easy to overlook one of the richest resources available by modem : your friendly neighborhood computer bulletin_board . There is a BBS , as they are popularly known , for almost everyone , yet even many experienced users of such services as Prodigy and CompuServe never venture far enough afield to see what a good BBS has to offer . that ' s a shame , because in terms of sheer value , it ' s hard to beat a good BBS . Many systems offer multiplayer games , movie and TV listings , USA Today news , vast stores of software free for the downloading , and the chance to &quot; chat &quot; onscreen with other users who have a little too_much time on their hands . Perhaps best of all , many BBSs offer unlimited electronic_mail , including e-mail to the Internet and the various commercial services . In fact , users who just want e-mail from an on-line service should seriously consider adopting a BBS as their main post_office . BBSs are especially good for serving far-flung individuals who share a common interest . There are BBSs for Zen_Buddhists , outdoor enthusiasts , horseplayers , entrepreneurs and just about everybody else . With an estimated 50 # 000 to 100 # 000 BBSs in America , there is a general or specialized BBS for almost every conceivable lifestyle , interest or taste . BBSs are also increasingly popular as a way for organizations to disseminate information . Government_agencies such_as the Food and Drug Administration and Small Business Administration have their own BBSs , and software companies such_as Microsoft have BBSs that carry product information , programming patches and other useful stuff . BBSs are often cheap -- from $ 30 to $ 75 a year -- and sometimes free . Using a BBS is especially cost-effective when it isn ' t a long-distance_call away , but even then it can be worthwhile if the BBS has something you want ( and you dial during off-peak hours ) . Experienced BBS users adopt what are known as off-line mail readers , which squeeze all your new messages and forum postings into a compressed packet for fast downloading . The software then organizes the information for easy reading or responding off-line , compressing responses into a reply packet that can usually be uploaded in no time at all . BBSs are also , it must be said , a font of pornography . Not all , of course , but a good many BBSs -- often the biggest and most expensive -- are &quot; adult-oriented , &quot; specializing in sexually explicit material of all kinds . These boards tend to disclose their nature upfront , so beware . Even the tamer boards often offer personal ads , and in the heavily male world of cyberspace , women sooner or later seem to get hit on , or worse . BBSs have come a long way since the earliest ones functioned simply as electronic cork boards for a handful of users . Various networks -- FidoNet is perhaps the most famous -- tie local boards together , so that a local BBS forum on golf might be part of a much larger discussion encompassing golfers from all_over North_America and even the world . There are networks of specialty boards too ; many gay and lesbian BBSs , for instance , are connected by GayCom . A great way to get started exploring the world of BBSs is to dial a free one close to home ; a favorite of mine is the Los Angeles Valley College BBS . All you need for this is your modem and whatever telecommunications program it no doubt came_with . You can tap into this particular BBS by dialing it with your computer at ( 818 ) 985-7150 , at modem speeds of up_to 14 # 400 bps . Once there , you ' ll find a wealth of offerings , including free Internet e-mail ; your address will become mary.jones.support.com , assuming your name is Mary Jones . Thus equipped , you can send and receive mail to anyone on CompuServe , America Online and so forth . To message someone on CompuServe , replace the comma in his ID number with a period and append .compuserve.com. For America Online , it ' s just username.aol.com. ( Fill_in the recipient ' s actual username. ) You can also use your address to subscribe_to any Internet mailing_list . The Valley College BBS carries more_than 900 Internet and FidoNet special-interest forums . And , of course , you can download shareware files , including off-line readers . You get access to almost everything on this easy-to-use system for free , but a payment of at least $ 15 annually gets you complete access and the feeling that you ' ve paid your share for using this worthy enterprise . Once you get_the_hang of using BBSs , your biggest problem , aside from finding time for your children , may be finding new systems to dial . A number of publications carry BBS lists , and there are lists all_over in cyberspace , especially on many BBSs . On America Online , use the keyword BBS . On CompuServe , hit the IBM BBS Forum . On the Internet , check_into any of the BBS newsgroups . Sooner or later , you ' ll find a BBS you ' re comfortable with . Horseplayers might try the Handicapper ' s Log ( modem to ( 213 ) 934-6026 ) . Searchers for satori can download some koans from the Tiger Team Buddhist Information Network at ( 510 ) 268-0102 . Korean speakers ( or English speakers interested in matters Korean ) can try Korea America Online at ( 213 ) 962-3634 . Local Boards Some local BBSs that are either free for newcomers or free for everyone : * LA Online : ( 310 ) 372-4050 ; what ' s happening in Los Angeles * One World : ( 310 ) 372-0987 ; ecology , gardening * LA Free-Net : ( 818 ) 776-5000 ; community-based system * Beyond the Realm : ( 805 ) 987-5506 ; chat , games and shareware for the family * Midnight Unicorne Tavern : ( 714 ) 572-6155 ; medieval theme * Stitches Source BBS : ( 714 ) 589-1718 ; needlework * Small Business Administration : ( 800 ) 697-4636 ; entrepreneurs . Today marks the debut of Postcard from Cyberspace as a biweekly column . Daniel Akst welcomes messages at akst.news.latimes.com , but regrets that he cannot reply to each and every one .</TEXT>
