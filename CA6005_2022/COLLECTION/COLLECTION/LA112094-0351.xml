   <HEADLINE> SAVING GRACE ; SALVAGE YARDS TREASURE-TROVES OF ARCHITECTURAL ANTIQUES AND ACCESSORIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When John Frayer sets foot in a salvage yard , he feels_like a kid in a candy_store . &quot; Seeing those stained glass windows , antique doors and decorative hardware makes me want to buy_it all , &quot; said Frayer , whose passion for architectural antiques makes him roam local salvage yards every weekend . &quot; It ' s like a treasure_hunt , &quot; he said . Frayer ' s richest treasure_chest is Scavenger ' s Paradise , a fancy salvage yard in North Hollywood . Stepping into the tile-roofed church turned salvage yard on Satsuma Avenue means taking a tour through Los Angeles ' architectural past . Hundreds of panel doors , a choir_loft full of antique lighting_fixtures , fireplace mantels in brass or wood , claw-foot bathtubs , chandeliers and architectural gems such_as a majestic pair of walnut columns fill almost 6 # 000 square_feet . Scavenger ' s Paradise is one of about a dozen salvage yards in the greater Los Angeles area that specializes in some form of architectural antiques . Scattered from Malibu to downtown Los Angeles to East L.A. , they serve a diverse clientele ranging from homeowners to interior_decorators and restaurant owners . While some look_for old pieces to keep the style of a renovated building intact , others want to add a dose of nostalgia to a new home or commercial establishment . The inventory of local salvage yards consist_of just about everything from used sinks and hardware to highly decorative items such_as ornate doors and antique fountains . The majority of raw_materials come from about-to-be-demolished commercial and residential buildings such_as hotels , offices , schools and private homes . Prices range from $ 2 for plumbing odds and ends to $ 10 # 000 for a pair of 4-foot-tall Art Deco lamps . According to salvage yard owners , the market for architectural remnants has skyrocketed over the last 10 years . Rooted in the preservationist movement of the 1970s , the demand for those rare reminders of times long gone was boosted by the recycling wave that started in the 1980s . In recent years , tight economic times and the trend to individualize homes have sent even more people to salvage yards in search for one-of-a-kind architectural antiques . &quot; A house is like a mirror of your personality , &quot; Frayer said . &quot; It reflects your likes and dislikes and gives you a chance to show creativity and imagination. &quot; The 60-year-old former dancer has been a regular at salvage yards for many years . Among Frayer ' s most treasured finds are a gracious pair of Art Nouveau lamps and a dozen French-made terra-cotta tiles from the 1990s . Frayer ' s love for antique remnants has forced him to add_on to his 1918 Laurel Canyon home over the years . Just a_few months ago he finished a deck as the perfect stage for two salvaged turn-of-the-century lamp posts . Frayer ' s current project -- a sleeping house on top of a 28-foot-high waterfall in his back yard -- is a charming hodgepodge of Victorian wooden ornaments , cast-iron railings and corrugated tin from the 1940s . &quot; Since I gave_up dancing , I ' ve made architectural salvage my creative outlet , &quot; said Frayer . &quot; I ' m the choreographer who puts castoffs in the spotlight again. &quot; As a third-generation Hollywood resident , he feels the need to preserve history . &quot; Within 15 minutes a wrecking ball can demolish an old building worth 80 years of beauty , &quot; said Frayer , who always keeps tools and pickup_truck ready for a short-notice rescue mission . &quot; You don ' t find the same kind of magic in new things. &quot; Inspired by salvage-decorated nightclubs such_as the Magic Castle and Dan Akroyd ' s House of Blues , imaginative buyers like Frayer find news uses for recycled architectural items . In Frayer ' s home , parts of a bowling_alley came_to new life as a kitchen countertop , and old-fashioned doors serve as wall paneling . A solid nickel curtain rod from murdered lawyer Stanford White ' s apartment was revived as door hardware . &quot; Detailing is what excites me , &quot; Frayer said . &quot; But it can take years to get the right hardware. &quot; Finding the correct hardware for antique doors and light fixtures has become less time consuming since Liz ' s Antique Hardware opened on south La Brea Avenue last year . Liz ' s specializes in mass-produced hardware for doors , windows , lightning and plumbing from the 1850s to 1950s . &quot; Paint and hardware are the most inexpensive ways to change the look of your house , &quot; said owner Liz Gordon , 37 . &quot; People come_in here and are inspired just by the presentation of the hardware. &quot; Most of the some 350 # 000 pieces that adorn the store ' s 50-foot-long wall are chronologically organized from Victorian , Eastlake , Art Nouveau to Arts &amp; Crafts and Art Deco styles . The counters below hold milk crates overflowing with knob spindles , porcelain cabinet knobs , keyhole covers , keys and casters . Period bathroom_fixtures such_as wall sconces , towel_bars , faucets , toilets and purple or white sinks with or without trimmings have a section of_their_own . Stacked on a shelf in the back , some 100 metal claw feet , once stable support for weighty bathtubs , wait for a second , third or even fourth life . A set of hardware for an inner door sells for $ 35 , a pedestal sink is priced at $ 500 . &quot; In the old days , a lot of time and effort went_into making hardware , &quot; Gordon said . &quot; If you want to buy that quality new today , it ' s much more expensive than an antique piece . And it doesn ' t have the look and the patina of old metal. &quot; Besides looks and quality , the recession has sent more people to salvage yards . &quot; When the economy gets tight , people start emphasizing do-it-yourself renovations , &quot; said Gordon , whose customers are equally split between private clients and professionals such_as architects or set designers . To stock her 3 # 500-square-foot store , Gordon roams flea_markets and salvage yards from Los Angeles to Chicago . In addition to selling fragments of yesterday , Gordon rents architectural highlights to studios for movies and commercials . Set designers come_to her for authentic period bathtubs complete with original fixtures . A cast-iron roll-top bathtub with a brass faucet has already made numerous appearances on screen . Gordon also acts_as matchmaker for large quantities or missing pieces . For a $ 10 handling fee and a photograph of the desired item , Gordon can locate almost any piece of hardware . Sales jumped even higher after the Northridge earthquake . Some customers flocked to Liz ' s in search for lampshades to replace shattered ones . Others were_on the lookout for stylish latches to prepare old cabinets for the next temblor . &quot; Crisis or no crisis , people nowadays have a strong sense of reusing , &quot; said Gordon . &quot; Recycling is not only a fashionable trend but the way of the future. &quot; For self-declared salvage junkie Susan Mazer , recycling is only one facet of architectural salvage . &quot; Shopping for antique items is a combination of reusing building_materials , salvaging heritage and , in my case , bargain hunting , &quot; she said . When the 48-year-old massage therapist started remodeling her Hollywood Hills cottage last year , she wanted to keep renovation costs low without sacrificing the charm of her 1955 home . Friends recommended a trip to MRM Building_Materials , a salvage yard in East Los Angeles . For $ 65 a piece , Mazer bought four ash doors from the 1920s . &quot; They would cost about $ 250 each if you buy them new , &quot; said Mazer . &quot; And the new ones don ' t even have the old Craftsman feel , the heavy wood and the nice look. &quot; MRM actually seems to belong in a different time and a different world . With old-fashioned grace , owner Gloria Sperry guides customers through the corridors between piles of used bricks and old lumber on the one-acre lot . &quot; I like the people who come_in here , &quot; Sperry said . &quot; I help_out those who are poor and come_by bus to get a used toilet for $ 30 . And I consult those with a Rolls-Royce who look_for an extravagant antique accent for their Beverly Hills villa. &quot; Customers can find just about everything at MRM . Doors , the most numerous item at local salvage yards , occupy half a warehouse . Next to them , hundreds of wood-framed windows from an old_school in El Monte are stocked by size . Stained glass , mostly shipped to California from England in the 1950s and 1960s , is carefully stored in dusty corners . Used bricks , wrought iron and all kinds of oddball things like a 60-year-old iron press_on shaky legs await their revival in the fenced-in yard . Parliament hinges from the 1920s for $ 3 each and rusty items that defy immediate identification overflow milk crates . Fifty-year-old Spanish Mission tiles , MRM ' s bestsellers for 75 cents a piece , pile_up in the back . All of these great architectural leftovers are sold as-is to keep costs and prices down . To keep track of the almost opaque mass of things , Sperry relies_on a computer . &quot; Without the machine it would be impossible to know what we have and where it is , &quot; said Sperry . &quot; It is a godsend for us and for our customers who quickly find what they want . They only have to find us first. &quot; For many architectural antique buyers that has been a problem . Like most salvage yard owners , Sperry does little advertising and relies_on word_of_mouth and the off-the-street crowd . &quot; Advertisement is expensive and the profit_margin is slim as it is , &quot; said Sperry . &quot; But when people have finally found us , I always see happy faces when they carry home their piece of history. &quot; Kessing is a Santa Monica free - lance writer .
