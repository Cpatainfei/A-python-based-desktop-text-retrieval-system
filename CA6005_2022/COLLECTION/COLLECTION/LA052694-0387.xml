   <HEADLINE> ENDLESS QUEST ; LOCAL MEN RETRACE SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT WAVES OF CLASSIC MOVIE ' S SURFING SAFARI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pat O ' Connell had dreamed of pulling his surfboard down that strand of white beach that went_for miles without a footprint . Robert ( Wingnut ) Weaver envisioned riding that perfect wave at Cape St . Francis , South_Africa , the one that kept going and going and going . . . They had watched Huntington Beach ' s Robert August and Mike Hynson ride that surf break before , in Bruce Brown ' s 1964 surfing documentary &quot; The Endless Summer. &quot; They couldn ' t wait to get their shot . Thirty years after Brown and August visited Cape St . Francis , pro surfers O ' Connell and Weaver returned with the filmmaker for &quot; The Endless Summer II. &quot; And they discovered that the perfect wave -- and the world around it -- has imperfections . They flew halfway around the world , drove over miles of highway and dirt roads and hiked across the hot sand only to find . . . Mission Viejo ? Hundreds of condominiums covered the shore , vegetation had grown_over sand that in the past had blown_out to the ocean to create a smooth , breaking wave that offered rides up_to 45 seconds long . &quot; I saw that , &quot; Weaver said , &quot; and the first thing I said was ' Oh nooooo. ' &quot; It was a familiar sight for Weaver , who grew_up in Newport Beach before moving to Santa Cruz in the late 1980s . It reminded O ' Connell a little of Dana Point , where he has lived for 10 years . &quot; What happened at Cape St . Francis is a classic example of what happens when population spreads uncontrollably , &quot; Weaver said . &quot; There were still waves there , but they weren ' t as_good_as the first movie. &quot; Weaver and O ' Connell found great waves during two years of filming at prime surf breaks_in South_Africa , Australia , Indonesia , Mexico , Costa Rica , Hawaii and the Fiji Islands . But the trip offered them more_than a chance to see how many floater maneuvers O ' Connell , 22 , could do while riding a shortboard , or how smooth Weaver , 28 , could be riding a longboard . They picked_up a little perspective along the way . &quot; Growing_up in Orange County isn ' t like growing_up in the real_world , &quot; O ' Connell said . &quot; You look_at life so_much differently once you have traveled around the world . &quot; Sure , I had traveled before on the pro surf tour , but your perspective is limited because you ' re concentrating_on that quarter-mile of beach where you ' re competing . This was different . I learned that the world stretches far beyond the beach. &quot; It stretched all_the way to South_Africa , where the waves were great but the politics lousy , last spring . The elections were still nearly a year away , and protesters lined some of the streets the surfers and film crew passed . O ' Connell and producer Roger Riddell were driving down a winding coastal road near Cape_Town when radio reports warned that protesters were rolling boulders off freeway overpasses onto cars below . Those overpasses were just a_few exits away . &quot; They told us if we were coming_through , &quot; O ' Connell said , &quot; that we should come_through late , late at night , after everyone had gone_home , or in broad daylight . &quot; We went_through at dusk , the worst time . We looked ahead and saw people standing on the bridge , and I thought , ' No , this can ' t be. ' &quot; When we got closer , we saw soldiers and a tank sitting on the bridge . They had everything under control. &quot; A_few months after returning to California , O ' Connell read about Amy Biehl , a Newport Beach college_student who was pulled from her car in Cape_Town and was stabbed and beaten to death . He wondered , could that have been us ? &quot; There were so many militant uprisings when we were there , &quot; Weaver said , &quot; that we didn ' t know if we would ever get_to go_back . &quot; Now , it ' s just extraordinary to see how everything worked_out so well . The elections are over and transfer of power ( to President Nelson Mandela ) has gone_through . Pat gets_to go_back in July with the world tour . What a great place to have an opportunity to go_back to. &quot; Brown discovered much has changed since he made the first picture . Filmed on a $ 50 # 000 budget , the first movie grossed an estimated $ 30 million worldwide . It was shot on a wind-up 16-millimeter camera by Brown , who worked alone . The new version was shot with multiple state-of-the-art 35-millimeter cameras and includes underwater scenes . Brown , who directs the movie and co-wrote the script with son , Dana , had a budget of $ 3.3 million and an eight-member crew to capture the adventures of O ' Connell and Weaver . Brown considered dozens of surfers for the starring roles . Former world-champions Kelly Slater and Tom Curren , considered the Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson of surfing , were rumored to be the favorites . But Brown wanted to create a visual difference -- the ballet steps of the longboard ride along with the break_dancing moves of a shortboard surfer . Mutual friends put Brown in touch with Weaver and O ' Connell in 1991 . The surfers met for the first time during auditions at Brown ' s ranch north of Santa Barbara . Brown saw potential in O ' Connell , a blond-mopped kid who can match the energy level of 20 kindergartners on a sugar rush . And Brown saw potential in Weaver , the clean-cut , well-spoken surfer with an economics degree from UC Santa Cruz . &quot; I didn ' t want some guy with tattoos on his forehead and saying , ' Yeah , dude , groovy , trendy , ' &quot; Brown said . &quot; When I met Pat , we talked for about 10 minutes and I thought , ' He ' s perfect. ' He epitomized my perception of surfing . He ' s enthusiastic and doesn ' t look_at the dark side of things. &quot; Neither O ' Connell nor Weaver are native Californians . O ' Connell was born in Chicago and moved to Laguna Niguel with his parents when he was 12 . Weaver was born in Germany and moved to Newport Beach when he was 4 . Weaver learned to bodysurf from a 65-year-old woman who was a regular at Corona del Mar beaches . He didn ' t start riding a board until 1982 , his junior year at Newport Harbor High . He always rode a longboard , refusing to try the shorter , faster version , even for Brown ' s cameras . He considers himself a surfing purist , a link from the legends who rode the longboard before him to the kids he hopes will ride it in the future . &quot; The whole style of longboarding appealed_to me , &quot; Wingnut said . &quot; It was a different approach to surfing , and I had always been into the 1950s and ' 60s . And surfing just captured that era so well. &quot; He was one of the founding members of the Blackie ' s Longboard Contest in Newport Beach , and has won several contests , including the Malibu Club Invitational and the Coastline Cup . &quot; Wingnut was the first of the young guys to really dedicate himself to riding the longboard , &quot; said August , who shaped 25 boards that Weaver used in the movie . &quot; Before him , it was mainly older guys like me riding longboards . Now , younger kids are finding that you can have fun on them when the waves are three feet and mushy. &quot; O ' Connell started surfing in his early teens , sharpening his skills on breaks such_as Upper and Lower Trestles and Salt Creek State Beach . He graduated from Dana Hills High in 1989 and a year later won the first pro contest he entered , a U.S. tour event at Imperial Beach . By 1991 , O ' Connell was in surfing ' s major_leagues -- competing in a_few world-tour events and qualifying contests . He upset former world champions Damien Hardman and Tom Carroll on his way to a fifth-place finish at Huntington Beach ' s Op Pro , but struggled on the European leg of the world tour . &quot; I surfed OK here or there in a contest , &quot; he said . &quot; But I was not a complete surfer . I took these two years off to focus just on surfing , not the contests . Now , I feel a lot more confident coming_into contests. &quot; It has been more_than a year since the film crew called it a wrap , and O ' Connell and Weaver are eagerly awaiting the movie ' s June 3 premiere . They ' re traveling the country with Brown to promote the movie . A photo spread in GQ magazine is scheduled for next month . Reporters from New York to Santa Cruz are calling_for interviews . O ' Connell hasn ' t seen the finished product , only a preview showing before &quot; Major_League II &quot; at a Dana Point theater . He paid a matinee price for the movie , watched the preview and left . He hopes people leaving the theater will have the same feeling he did making_it . &quot; There ' s so_much violence in all_the movies around now , that I hope people will see this film and give a second_thought to what the world can be like , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s still a way to get_away , out of the concrete jungle . You just have to get_off your butt and go find them. &quot; Endless Summer II Travelogue Dana Point ' s Pat O ' Connell and former Newport Beach resident Robert ( Wingnut ) Weaver logged nearly 70 hours on airplanes in search of the perfect wave . Filming for Bruce Brown ' s surfing movie &quot; Endless Summer II &quot; took O ' Connell and Weaver to seven countries , including Australia and South_Africa .
