   <HEADLINE> CHIEF SEEKS CHANGES IN LAPD SEX , BIAS POLICY ; HARASSMENT : WILLIAMS PROPOSES NEW OVERSIGHT UNIT . TRANSFERS ARE UNDER WAY AT TROUBLED WEST L.A. STATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles Police_Chief Willie L . Williams proposed sweeping changes Tuesday in his department ' s handling of sexual_harassment and discrimination complaints , while sources said his subordinates are working behind the scenes to transfer a number of sergeants , detectives and other officers out of the West Los Angeles police_station . Three sergeants have been transferred out of West Los Angeles recently , said Capt . Robert Kurth , the commanding_officer of that station . The transfers , which sources said may eventually involve detectives and officers of other ranks , are not intended to punish the officers but are an attempt to improve the working environment of a police_station with a long -- though disputed -- reputation for hostility toward women . Williams has generally declined to comment on developments at the West Los Angeles station and did not mention the transfers in his report Tuesday to the Police Commission . Instead , the report highlighted a number of proposed LAPD reforms , most notably creation of a specialized unit to investigate all harassment and discrimination complaints . Creation of such a unit has been eagerly sought by some women ' s advocates , but reaction to Williams ' proposal was mixed , largely because many proponents of the concept hoped that the group would report directly to the Police Commission , rather than through the LAPD chain of command , as Williams recommended . Commission President Gary Greenebaum , who referred the chief ' s proposal to a committee , said he was gratified by the chief ' s recommendations , which he described as &quot; generally on the right track , &quot; but added that he was inclined to favor having the unit report to the commission . &quot; It ' s my sense that people who have complaints do not feel comfortable working_through the department because there ' s a sense of reprisal , &quot; Greenebaum said . &quot; When I hear over and over again the same fears and the same concerns it makes me feel that ( complaints ) ought to come_through us. &quot; The unit , if approved by the commission during the coming weeks , would be &quot; responsible_for receiving and investigating all complaints dealing with discrimination based on ethnicity , gender or sexual orientation , &quot; Williams said in his report . The unit would be part of a newly configured Equal Employment Opportunity Division , which also would be charged with providing employee counseling and with coordinating harassment , bias and discrimination training . Under the present system , some harassment and discrimination complaints are handled by Internal Affairs , while others are investigated by the Employee Opportunity and Development Division , the Women ' s Coordinator or the complainant ' s commanding_officer . &quot; This diluted process has caused confusion for the employees of this organization and implies to employees and people who examine the department from the outside that there is not a concerted effort to quickly and concisely prepare resolutions to these complaints , &quot; Williams said . In addition to the creation of the new complaint unit , Williams outlined several other proposals for combatting harassment and discrimination . The chief wants every LAPD officer to receive special harassment training , and he pledged to forward to the commission a timeline to assure that the training is delivered promptly . &quot; It is not enough to simply reorganize and respond to complaints of our employees , &quot; Williams said . &quot; We must also ensure that all_the current and future members of the department receive training to ensure that they fully understand the policies and procedures relating to discriminatory behavior in the areas of ethnicity , gender and sexual orientation. &quot; As part of that training , every officer will receive a packet of material on sexual_harassment and discrimination , Williams said . Some critics warned that repackaging the department ' s current harassment and discrimination material is not enough . They said the LAPD should instead revisit those materials and draft better ones . In a bow to the City_Council ' s Personnel Committee , the chief said he also has ordered that every departing LAPD employee be questioned about harassment , gender bias and other forms of discrimination . Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg , who chairs the Personnel Committee , had asked that discrimination and harassment questions be posed as part of the exit interview process . The chief ' s recommendations come_in the midst of a shuffle at the West Los Angeles station , as a_few longstanding officers there are being asked to take positions elsewhere in the department . Kurth , the commanding_officer , stressed that the officers who are moving are not accused of any wrongdoing and said that such transfers are encouraged to &quot; recharge the batteries &quot; of employees who have been in their assignments longer than five years . The West Los Angeles station has been the subject of a long-running internal LAPD audit into the working conditions there , particularly with_respect_to sexual_harassment , though allegations of racism also are being addressed . Although some elements of that audit still are under way , it has sparked a number of changes . At least two officers are under investigation , and disciplinary action could be brought against them or others . The transfers and the proposed LAPD reorganization come_after news_reports and City_Council hearings this spring that detailed the problem of sexual_harassment in the LAPD ranks . The department ' s responses represent its most sweeping efforts to root_out that problem , but they fall_short_of changes that some women ' s advocates had proposed and they were greeted with guarded enthusiasm Tuesday . &quot; It ' s a step_in the right direction , &quot; said Katherine Spillar , national coordinator for the Feminist Majority and co-chairwoman of the Women ' s Advisory Council to the Los Angeles Police Commission . &quot; It ' s not enough . It ' s something that we would never have seen under the previous chief or the previous police administration , but it ' s still not enough. &quot; Carol Sobel , an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who will announce today the filing of a class-action gender discrimination lawsuit against the LAPD , agreed . &quot; I think it ' s fair to say that all_of us . . . are pleased that there are some affirmative steps toward dealing with this problem , &quot; she said . &quot; But there ' s enormous concern that this piecemeal approach does not cut it. &quot; Most of the attention Tuesday was focused_on the chief ' s proposal for the new unit . If approved , the division would be located outside police_headquarters , a move Williams said &quot; should reduce the stress that some of our employees currently express about entering Parker Center to express a concern about their peers , supervisors or managers. &quot; That and other changes were sought by women ' s advocates during a series of Personnel Committee hearings in March and April . But some women ' s advocates worried that the new unit ' s effectiveness would be undermined if it is staffed by police_officers and required to report through the Police_Department . &quot; We need an independent , civilian-staffed unit that reports directly to the Police Commission , &quot; Spillar said . &quot; that ' s the only way to insure that this unit can do the job. &quot; From the start , however , department insiders had questioned whether the chief would be willing to turn_over such a sensitive function to a civilian unit , particularly because personnel issues are involved . The LAPD traditionally does not release personnel information except in rare circumstances , such_as when it surfaces in matters that go before police disciplinary boards .</TEXT>
