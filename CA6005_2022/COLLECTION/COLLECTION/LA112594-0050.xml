   <TEXT> American troops far from family dinners and Thanksgiving football games were treated to a hotel feast and an exotic dance , courtesy of a group of Kuwaitis grateful for U.S. protection . More_than 1 # 800 U.S. troops wolfed_down roast turkey and cranberry_sauce in a huge hall at a five-star hotel , while sword dancers in white robes and checkered headdresses performed . &quot; This is great , better than sitting in the barracks , &quot; said Spec . Jay Nix , 23 , from Portland , Ore . At the entrance , Bedouin tents were set_up , and soldiers had their photographs taken beside camels . The $ 87 # 500 tab was picked_up by a number of Kuwaiti families and companies that wanted to show their appreciation for the troops , most with the 24th Infantry Division based in Ft . Stewart , Ga . They flew to Kuwait last month to counter an Iraqi military buildup just north of the Kuwaiti border . The buildup raised fears that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein planned to repeat his August , 1990 , invasion of the emirate . But Iraq pulled_back after the United States rushed tens of thousands of troops to the region , and Russia promised Baghdad to campaign to ease U.N. sanctions imposed after the invasion . Businessman Faisal Kazemi , 51 , was one of the hosts . He brought his two young boys to dine with the troops . &quot; This is the least we could do for our American friends who came quickly to support Kuwait , and who fought the Gulf War to free us , &quot; he said . Most of the dinner guests were scheduled to leave by mid-December . Only a_few hundred will stay to maintain heavy_weapons in Camp Doha , north of Kuwait City . The six-hour extravaganza , complete with prizes and live music , was the idea of an American couple , Sheila and Lionel Gittens , of Mt . Holly , N.J. , who have lived_in Kuwait for more_than three years . Sheila Gittens said she wanted to give her countrymen and women a chance to familiarize themselves with Kuwaiti culture . Spec . Terry Beyer , 28 , of Freeport , Ill. , said the Thanksgiving dinner was his first foray outside the camp since he arrived Oct . 8 . He thought the party and the food were wonderful . Only one thing was missing though , he said : beer . Alcohol is banned in the Muslim country .</TEXT>
