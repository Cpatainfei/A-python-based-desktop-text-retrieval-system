   <TEXT> Ah , those parenting books . Written by psychiatrists and other physicians , grabbed by Mom and Dad on the run , consulted the way parents used to consult their parents or Mrs . Jones down the street . Walk into any bookstore and you ' ll find hundreds of them , their titles reflecting the growing number of problems children have been &quot; discovered &quot; to have and the legions of professionals who feel qualified to solve them . &quot; Why Johnny can ' t Concentrate. &quot; &quot; Raising Your Spirited Child. &quot; &quot; The Misunderstood Child. &quot; &quot; Children With Asthma , &quot; &quot; Children With Epilepsy , &quot; even &quot; The Emotional Problems of Normal Children. &quot; &quot; There seem to be more parenting books every year , and I find that alarming , &quot; says Ann Ruethling , who skims at least five new titles a week for her Chinaberry Book Service , a mail-order firm specializing in books for children and families . &quot; It says to me that as parents we see problems , and we ' re groping . We don ' t know ourselves anymore , much less our children. &quot; The world ' s most famous baby_doctor , Benjamin Spock , who still travels and lectures despite his advanced years , says uncertainty is the most prevalent difficulty he observes in his audiences today . &quot; American parents are losing more and more confidence in themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; I don ' t think that ' s a healthy sign. &quot; In addition to books , there are parenting magazines -- 97 , according to the National Directory of Magazines . Some , such_as Child , Parenting , and Parents -- the grandmother of them all -- have a broad circulation , but many_more are local . The information-hungry parent can also cruise the info-highway and find at least a dozen electronic_bulletin_boards offering advice and conversation . In the beginning , when today ' s parents were smearing oatmeal on_their_own high chairs , there was Spock . Period . &quot; Trust yourself , &quot; he began &quot; Baby and Child_Care , &quot; published in 1946 . But no one listened , and soon came Brazelton and Leach , Ginott and Faber , Eisenberg and hundreds more . Parenting by intuition was gradually replaced with parenting by technique , says psychologist David Elkind , and responsibility for child-rearing shifted subtly from parent to Ph.D. The early experts , such_as Spock and Arnold Gesell , outlined general norms of development by age and assured parents they could translate these norms , Elkind says in his latest book , &quot; Ties That Stress : The New Family Imbalance. &quot; Later authors , he says , became more &quot; prescriptive in tone , judgmental in attitude and specific in their aims. &quot; The new breed appears to want to help parents modify , rather than understand , their children ' s behavior , says Elkind , who doesn ' t altogether approve of this trend . Elkind suggests that many of today ' s parents prefer the quick technique because it ' s just that -- quick . Freddi Greenberg , editor-in-chief of Child , agrees that that ' s one reason . &quot; Sixty percent of our readers work full-time , &quot; says Greenberg , whose magazine_articles combine a developmental approach with specific techniques . &quot; They want to be told , ' Here are two or three choices that will make_sense for your child. ' &quot; Greenberg , a mother of five , adds , &quot; We ( parents ) really do try to make every minute count. &quot; Previous generations of parents spent more time at_home , she says , and &quot; they didn ' t obsess as much. &quot; Lawyer Lisa West , 37 , gave_birth to Alex about a year ago , and like many of her contemporaries , she has attacked child-rearing with the same degree of seriousness with which she pursues her career -- perhaps even more . She ' s the kind of reader that Peter Ginna , senior editor at Crown Books , has_in_mind when he peruses new manuscripts , because she wants to know not only what she is supposed to do but why . Michelle Testani , a former psychiatric nurse , sees the same intensity in mothers who stay_at home . She attributes this to the later age at which parents are having children . Older parents are both &quot; more wise_to the ways of the world &quot; than mothers and fathers in their 20s , and more reflective , she says . They ' re also more likely to have undergone psychological counseling , says Testani , and to have thought_about the families in which they grew_up and to want to not repeat past mistakes . Yet parents can be too reflective , read too_much and expect too_much . As Elkind notes in his book , they can feel pressured to rush their children into skills prematurely and to expect certain behaviors the youngsters are not ready for , setting_up their children for failure and themselves for deep disappointment . &quot; Parents may become overly concerned about doing things the ' right ' way and convey this inhibiting and constraining concern to their child , &quot; he notes .</TEXT>
