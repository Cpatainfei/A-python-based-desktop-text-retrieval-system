   <HEADLINE> HOAG HOSPITAL ENDS BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENTS ; SECURITY : CONCERNED ABOUT BABY STEALING , IT IS THE LAST OF THE COUNTY ' S BIG MATERNITY HOSPITALS TO STOP PROVIDING NEWBORNS ' NAMES TO NEWSPAPERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It used to be that proud parents clipped a birth announcement from the local newspaper and glued the treasured clipping into a baby book . But these days , those crinkly , yellow mementos might not be worth the risk . Concerned by the threat of baby stealing , Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian last month became the last of the county ' s big maternity hospitals to end the practice of providing the names of newborns to local newspapers . Some hospitals even warn new parents who choose to alert the newspapers themselves that seeking the public announcements might not be wise . &quot; Usually this would be a happy announcement , but people have to watch what they say about those things these days , &quot; said Maureen Mazzatenta , Hoag Hospital spokeswoman . The hospital also stopped distributing &quot; It ' s a Boy &quot; and &quot; It ' s a Girl &quot; bumper stickers as gifts to new parents . &quot; The hospital staff is acutely in tune to security concerns and abductions at other hospitals. &quot; Hoag has been placing birth announcements as a courtesy since the hospital opened in 1952 , but the staff there decided recently that heightened concern about crime and security supersedes the desire for newspaper souvenirs . &quot; It is sad that people have to be so careful , &quot; Mazzatenta said , adding that the hospital has never had an abduction . While most big hospitals gave_up birth announcements years ago , a_few still provide the information only with parental consent and most leave it up_to parents to supply newspapers with the information . &quot; Twenty years ago that was the big deal , &quot; Dr. B.J. Snell , a director at UCI Medical_Center ' s birthing center in Anaheim . &quot; Today , infant security is a huge issue. &quot; Yet , baby stealing is quite rare . In the past 11 years , 19 babies have been abducted in California from either a hospital or , more commonly , the mother ' s home , according to statistics compiled by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the FBI . Earlier this month , an infant was snatched from a Los Angeles hospital was but recovered after a security camera captured the kidnaper ' s image on tape . In only four cases in the past 10 years did abductors use published announcements to target victims , according to the national statistics . &quot; It is not an epidemic , &quot; said Ruben Rodriguez , senior analyst at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children . &quot; But try telling that to a parent who has had their child abducted . . . . And hospitals have gotten burned &quot; in lawsuits that found them liable for having published infants ' names in the first place , he said . When Cathy Fitzpatrick of Lake Forest gave_birth to her daughter last July at Hoag Hospital , she and her husband kept that day ' s newspaper as a souvenir but never got_around_to clipping the actual birth notice from the paper . &quot; I sent_out my own personal birth announcements to people I know , &quot; Fitzpatrick said . &quot; It really doesn ' t surprise me ( that Hoag stopped having announcements published ) ; there really are people out there who are wacky . . . . It is sad that you have to remain so paranoid. &quot; At a_few hospitals countywide , the tradition lives on . Placentia Linda Community Hospital in Placentia sends the information to the local newspaper , but only with the parents ' consent , said Catherine McMiller , director of medical_records . Samaritan Medical_Center in San Clemente and Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical_Center routinely provide a short notice for the community newspaper . One community newspaper , the Irvine World News , said it receives three to 15 announcements a week . Reporter Peggy Goetz said that even before Hoag Hospital stopped sending a monthly list of births , she and editors at the newspaper discussed the risks of printing notices that contain the baby ' s name and sex , birth date and the parents ' names and home city . &quot; We checked with the hospitals to make_sure they had permission from parents , &quot; she said . &quot; We still get cards from parents who send their own in . . . . There are still people who really want those ( announcements ) in there. &quot; Hospitals , in deference to patients ' privacy , generally provide a package of information to parents that includes both an announcement card for the newspaper -- and a warning . The warning might include a recommendation that parents shy_away_from publishing birth announcements or hanging signs_on front_doors advertising the arrival of a baby . &quot; I think some of ( the mothers ) are still excited to see their new baby ' s name in the paper , &quot; said Jennifer Lefebvre , spokeswoman at Saddleback Memorial Medical_Center in Laguna Hills . &quot; But I do know that with an increase in concern over child safety , a lot of people have opted &quot; not to send the newspapers the announcement cards .</TEXT>
