   <HEADLINE> TEST FOR TOXINS IN BACK YARDS TURNS_UP DDT ; POLLUTION : OFFICIALS SAY CONCENTRATIONS OF THE LONG-BANNED PESTICIDE IN HARBOR GATEWAY AREA ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO CAUSE ILLNESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal investigators who took soil samples from the back yards of 12 homes near Harbor Gateway in September were looking_for contaminants that might have spread from the nearby Del Amo Pits , a proposed Superfund site . But they were surprised to find that , while none of the soil samples contained unsafe levels of the toxic chemicals they were searching for , two of the samples contained unusually high levels of the banned insecticide DDT . Investigators , who announced their findings recently , were in the neighborhood to check whether any heavy metals from a former rubber manufacturing_plant nearby had found their way into residents ' yards . The former plant , a 280-acre site known as Del Amo Pits , produced such byproducts as benzo ( a ) pyrene , a carcinogen , said Tom Dunkelman , U . S . Environmental Protection Agency project manager . He said the agency is at_a_loss to explain the source of the DDT . Although EPA officials do not believe the DDT concentrations are high enough to cause illness , they intend to conduct additional tests next month at the two homes where DDT was found . If the next round of more intensive tests reveal high levels of the pesticide , federal_officials might replace the soil . &quot; These are not levels that would cause anyone to become sick over a short-term exposure , &quot; Dunkelman said . &quot; The way in which EPA evaluates risk is very conservative and puts safety first . The risk numbers assume that people ingest a certain amount of soil every day for years. &quot; Once a widely used pesticide , DDT has been banned in this country since 1972 . People exposed to high doses of the contaminant for short periods typically suffer tremors , rashes and irritation of the eyes , nose and throat . DDT also has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals . Typically , federal_officials recommend taking precautions when the concentration of DDT exceeds 100 parts per million , although recent changes in how authorities assess human risks will probably lead to more stringent standards in the next few weeks . Samples from one back yard yielded DDT at a concentration of 32 parts per million , while the other contained DDT at 110 parts per million , leading the agency to advise the residents to wash their hands after working in the yard . Tests at the other 10 homes detected only traces of DDT , no more_than 5 parts per million . The two homes with soil containing substantially higher levels of DDT are next to each other on West 204th Street , between Normandie and New Hampshire avenues in an unincorporated area . The elderly couple who live at the home with the higher DDT levels could not be reached for comment . At the home where the lower concentration of DDT was found , renter Cynthia Babich , 44 , who regularly eats vegetables from her garden , said she is not worried about contamination because she grows her greens in beds with out-of-area soil . And , she believes , the several chickens she raises in the yard will be fine as long as they continue to lay eggs . &quot; I am concerned on a planetary level more_than a personal level , &quot; she said . &quot; It would take 70 years of me ingesting DDT every day for there to be any health_problems . Right now , our main concern is the red-tailed_hawks that live_in the fields next door. &quot; EPA investigators are looking_at the nearby Montrose Chemical Corp. , a 13-acre Superfund site that produced the pesticide from 1947 until the plant closed_in 1982 , as a possible source of the DDT . The company is currently working with the EPA to evaluate ways to clean_up its former facility . But it is also possible that the two homes were once sprayed with the pesticide to kill mosquitoes . &quot; You ' re going to find DDT just about anywhere you look_across the state , &quot; Dunkelman said . &quot; DDT was used across the county for mosquito control at one time . And this area , before it was developed , was an agricultural area , so it is likely the farmers applied DDT. &quot; Environmental authorities began testing the neighborhoods ' soil in the early 1980s because of its proximity to the Montrose site and Del Amo Pits . Although the entire Del Amo Pits area is a proposed Superfund site , the EPA has paid special attention in recent years to a 3.7-acre waste dump within the property that investigators said contained harmful levels of the heavy metals . Last year , Shell Oil and Dow Chemical , the two companies that had operations on the site between 1955 and 1969 , agreed to spend $ 10 million to figure_out how to clean_up soil and ground_water contamination . The EPA keeps a list of hazardous sites believed to pose the greatest health and environmental threats . Today , 1 # 300 sites are_on the Superfund National Priorities List , a designation which allows the EPA to enforce cleanup efforts against responsible parties or to spend money to ensure that sites containing hazardous waste are cleaned_up .</TEXT>
