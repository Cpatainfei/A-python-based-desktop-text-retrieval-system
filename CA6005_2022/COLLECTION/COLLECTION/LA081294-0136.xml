   <TEXT> Eric Corley , a.k.a. Emmanuel Goldstein -- patron_saint of computer hackers and phone phreaks -- is having a party . And perhaps it is just in time . 2600 , the hacker magazine Corley started when he was 23 , is a decade old . It has spawned monthly hacker meetings in dozens of cities . It has been the target of a Secret_Service investigation . It has even gone aboveground , with newsstand sales of 20 # 000 last year . But the wild expansion of the computer and phone networks that have traditionally been hacker stomping grounds -- and an accompanying rise in electronic crime -- has made life more complicated for Corley and others in the computer underground who claim to adhere to a higher ethical standard . And as more corporations rely_on electronic_communications to conduct daily business , computer security -- once the exclusive concern of elite computer technicians and their mischievous adversaries -- is now a topic of heated public_debate . Many are calling_for tighter restrictions on those who roam their digital networks , and tough criminal penalties for unauthorized activities -- even those that stop short of information theft or vandalism . As hundreds of hackers converge in New York City this weekend to celebrate 2600 ' s anniversary , Corley hopes to grapple with how to uphold the &quot; hacker ethic , &quot; an oxymoron to some , in an era when many of 2600 ' s devotees just want to know how to make free phone_calls . ( Less high-minded activities -- like cracking the New York City subway ' s new electronic fare card system -- are also on the agenda ) . For Corley and other purists , the hacker ethic begins with the notion that &quot; all information should be free. &quot; They view themselves as valiant holdouts against complete corporate and government control of ever-more-powerful information technologies . They break_into computers , copy software and tease computer_system administrators not out of greed or malice , they say , but out of a desire to understand the high-tech infrastructure and to keep the technocrats honest -- and they say they take pains to do no harm . It is an outlook that tends to run contrary to the principles of private_property and ownership under capitalism . Businesses whose computers and phone_systems are broken_into in the interest of exploration and the greater good of society generally do not think much of hacker ethics . Neither do law_enforcement officials . &quot; They say they ' re doing_it for the intellectual pursuit , and that sounds real nice , &quot; said James Settle , former head of the FBI ' s Computer Crime Squad , who was responsible_for the indictment of &quot; Phiber Optik , &quot; an outspoken New York hacker who went_to jail for computer trespassing this year . &quot; But there are much bigger ramifications. &quot; Corley ' s magazine takes its name from the 2600-hertz tone that used to control AT &amp; T ' s switching system . Mimicking it -- a way to gain free access to long-distance lines -- was one of the first hacks learned by phone phreaks , those who focus_on illicit entry into the public phone network . Legendary phone phreak John Draper , for example , received his alias , &quot; Captain Crunch , &quot; after discovering the whistle in a Cap ' n Crunch cereal_box emitted a perfect 2600 tone . Although the phone_company has long since abandoned the signal , the fundamental problem of defining a hacker morality remains much the same . &quot; How do we know what constitutes criminal behavior and what does not ? &quot; asks Corley in a recent 2600 editorial . &quot; Regrettably , the law no longer seems an accurate definer . With many of us , we just know when something doesn ' t feel right . And in such a case , trusting your instincts is always a good idea. &quot; The 2600 editor in chief , who wears his hair long and sports a tool belt full of electronic gadgets , is quick to condemn the paranoia that he says amounts to a desire to stifle innovation and put the best and brightest explorers of the electronic frontier behind bars . But Corley also goes as far as wishing that fewer people bought his magazine : &quot; It ' s gotten a lot bigger , which can be a bad thing , because a lot of people don ' t really understand what hacking is about , &quot; Corley said . &quot; It requires a certain kind of spirit. &quot; Many law_enforcement officials -- and engineers charged with maintaining security on corporate and governmental computer_systems -- say they could do without hacker spirit of any kind . They are genuinely spooked by a huge increase in computer break-ins in recent years , and by the emergence of sophisticated hacking techniques that they do not understand . In an ongoing attack on the Internet network that has extended into military computers and alarmed_system administrators throughout the world , hundreds of thousands of passwords have been stolen by intruders using a program known as a &quot; sniffer , &quot; which records the first 128 keystrokes of every message that passes_through a computer . Security experts have been unable to trace the source of the attacks . But there is no evidence that the passwords have been used to harm or steal anything . &quot; It ' s probably too early to tell if it ' s just an ' intellectual enterprise , ' &quot; said Dain Gary , manager of the Computer Emergency Response Team , a government-funded agency at Carnegie Mellon University that investigates security violations on the Internet . &quot; But the point is the integrity of those systems has been compromised. &quot; The team received 773 break-in reports in 1992 . This year , the agency estimates that it will receive more_than 2 # 300 reports . Many local law_enforcement authorities now view computer crime as a major threat , and are training investigators accordingly . Because no one likes to admit being a victim of break-ins , it is hard to assess the magnitude of computer crime . But security professionals believe that economic espionage via computer_networks is_on the rise . And they say that the criminal hacker stunts of earlier years -- such_as Los Angeles-based Kevin Poulsen manipulating radio call-in contests to win free Porsches -- are being replaced by higher-stakes hacking . &quot; You want me to screw around with your credit report ? I can get that done for less than $ 1 # 000 , &quot; Settle said . &quot; Just to get a report would probably cost me only $ 400 . Why bomb the World Trade Center ? Just shut_down the power_grid . There are hackers claiming from foreign countries that they can shut_down the air conditioning in any city in the U.S. It ' s all remotely monitored . You get_to that computer , you can make the building you ' re in right now 105 degrees. &quot; Gary said one problem is the lack of a value system . &quot; Cyber-ethics are not being taught . Parents don ' t know what their kids are doing . The kids themselves think_of it as joy riding -- but joy riding can be dangerous. &quot; Hackers counter that in a society increasingly dependent_on technology , the very basis for democracy could be threatened by limiting technological exploration . &quot; Hacking teaches people to think critically about technology , &quot; says Rop Gonggrijp , a Dutch hacker who will attend the Hackers on Planet Earth conference this weekend . &quot; The corporations that are building the technology are certainly not going_to tell us , because they ' re trying to sell it to us . Whole societies are trusting technology blindly -- they just believe what the technocrats say. &quot; Gonggrijp , 26 , publishes a magazine much like 2600 called Hack-Tic , which made waves this year with an article showing that while tapping the mobile phones of criminal suspects with radio scanners , Dutch police tapped into thousands of other mobile phones . &quot; What society needs is people who are independent yet knowledgeable , &quot; Gonggrijp said . &quot; that ' s mostly going_to be young people , which society is uncomfortable with . But there ' s only two groups who know how the phone and computer_systems work , and that ' s engineers and hackers . And I think that ' s a very healthy situation. &quot; 2600 and its supporters have an unlikely ally in AT &amp; T computer security expert Kevin Hanely , who plans to attend HOPE and says he is looking_forward to meeting the infamous &quot; Emmanuel Goldstein. &quot; &quot; I sometimes wonder how he knows so_much , &quot; Hanely admits , noting that 2600 has published articles on several internal AT &amp; T documents over the years . &quot; And I ' m concerned when the information he shares gets_into the hands of people who use it as a tool to hurt the customers that I try to represent . But we recognize the distinction between the hacker community and a community of criminal abusers. &quot; AT &amp; T just formed an investigative team to stage electronic stakeouts on systems known to be violated in an effort to &quot; take the bad hackers off the street. &quot; Hanely said : &quot; Hopefully the true hacker , the hacker who believes_in the ethic of information and knowledge expansion will laud these efforts , because we ' re going to help untarnish their image. &quot; LA Cellular appears to take a less sanguine view . The company says it hopes to find and prosecute a hacker who broke_into a call between John Scott , the firm ' s director of engineering , and his wife this month . &quot; TEK , &quot; as the hacker calls himself -- it ' s short for &quot; The Electronic Knight &quot; -- showed_up at last week ' s Los Angeles 2600 meeting in Union Station , armed with a notebook_computer and cellular_phone . The 19-year-old college_student has written a computer_program that allows him to track cellular calls throughout the region and trace the phone_numbers . TEK and a friend found Scott in the Cerritos Sheraton bar one evening . After disconnecting him from his wife , they listened as he called the office to demand that his engineers track them down . They paged him at the hotel , and left messages on his voice mail . The following week , TEK says , he called Scott back and the engineer told him that he should come work_at the company ' s fraud unit . &quot; He offered to buy my equipment , but I said no way . I ' m not in it for the money. &quot; Still , he says he has stayed_on the right side of the blurry line that separates hacking from criminal behavior . He has nothing but scorn for the hangers-on at the meeting who want him to help them reprogram their cellular_phone so they can make free calls . &quot; that ' s kiddie stuff , &quot; he said . &quot; I do this because it ' s cool to figure things out , to do stuff no one else has done before. &quot; Despite the elaborate measures they use on-line to disguise their identities , hackers flock to meetings like HOPE and the monthly 2600 gatherings . Attendance dropped_off a bit , however , after a meeting in a Washington shopping_mall in 1992 was broken_up by mall police who were working with the Secret_Service . ( The illegal activities discussed in the magazine have long drawn the interest of the Secret_Service , which along with the FBI is responsible_for investigating federal computer crime ) . Still , the desire to share information and meet other people like themselves is strong . The younger ones introduce themselves nervously by their handles . The older ones look_out for police . Meetings are always held near banks of pay phones , so other meetings nationwide can be called . At Union Station , about two_dozen men and a_few women , most in their teens and early 20s , gather around TEK ' s computer , plugged into a handy outlet by the phones , until a guard breaks the meeting up . Corley said : &quot; One thing we tell people is if you want to know if you ' re really a hacker , look and see if people are chasing you around wanting to cash_in_on your skills . If they are , you ' re probably about to cross the line . If people think you ' re just wasting your time , they think it ' s all nonsense and you ' re wasting your whole life , you ' re probably a hacker. &quot; Corley does not hack anymore . He was arrested in 1983 for allegedly hacking into a system that gave him access to the electronic_mail of corporations including Raytheon and Coca-Cola . ( Charges were later dropped. ) &quot; It had a one-letter password -- an a , &quot; he said . The then-23-year-old was told it would not be wise for him to continue with his plans to publish his magazine . Not big on taking advice from authority figures , he went_ahead . But he now treads_on the safe side of the tricky hacker dividing line , taking the role of hacker spokesman and sometime-caretaker of his young colleagues . That has not kept him entirely out of trouble . Numerous phone_company attorneys have sent him &quot; cease and desist &quot; letters threatening lawsuits over 2600 articles about their networks , ( all_of which promptly are printed in the next issue ) . Still , Settle , who left the FBI this year , says he repeatedly told his team that Corley was not doing anything wrong . &quot; I have no problems with what Emmanuel does . We ' ve been_on panels together. &quot; Sometimes described as the hackers ' Fagin , Corley gave 22-year-old Mark Abene , a.k.a. Phiber Optik , a lift to jail , and responds to hundreds of letters from hackers and wanna-bes asking for information . He even finds himself giving advice sometimes : &quot; We get letters from people who say : ' I want to be a hacker , I want to get credit_cards . We tell them you ' ve obviously watched ' Geraldo ' too_much , this is not hacking . We say , read the magazine. &quot;</TEXT>
