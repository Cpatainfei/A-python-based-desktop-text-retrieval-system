   <HEADLINE> JORDANIANS TURN_BACK RELIEF FOR TOMATO-STARVED ISRAELIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first fruits of Israel ' s peace with Jordan -- a 20-ton truckload of ripe tomatoes bound for Israel -- were turned_back at the border crossing Thursday by Jordanian agricultural officials . The tomato turnaround at the Jordan_River -- ordered because the fruit was of inferior quality -- was bad news for Israeli consumers . They are suffering a tomato shortage that is causing near-panic in a society that commonly eats the acidic fruit at breakfast , lunch and dinner . Israeli officials want to import Jordanian tomatoes to help bring prices down . In October , the Israeli market saw only 8 # 000 tons of tomatoes ; the normal monthly volume is 13 # 000 tons . By Thursday , tomato prices had hit 10 shekels a kilo -- about $ 1.50 per pound -- in grocery_stores . Tomatoes have not been so costly since 1989 , when they briefly sold for 12 shekels a kilo . The tomato crisis already has produced several public polls on who is to blame -- a majority think it is the government ' s fault -- and on whether Israelis are willing to boycott the fruit until the price drops . Ninety percent of people polled by Israel Radio said they will boycott . But sales remain brisk . The crisis also has led to charges that the Labor government has destroyed Israeli agriculture by trying to end subsidies and institute market principles in farming . &quot; Following the Finance Ministry ' s disastrous policy , which led to an unprecedented price increase of vegetables and fruits , the state ' s capacity to provide the citizens with the basic foods . . . at reasonable cost is in doubt , &quot; charged Shalom Simchon , general secretary of the nation ' s cooperative farm movement . Simchon called_for a commission to be appointed to investigate the government ' s actions . At this time last year , tomatoes were selling for less than 60 cents a pound . Over the summer , farmers sold tomatoes wholesale for as low as 6 cents a pound . The low summer prices sparked angry demonstrations by farmers , who pelted Agriculture Minister Yaacov Tsur ' s office with tomatoes . The Israeli Agriculture Ministry had already been importing tomatoes from the_Netherlands to try to alleviate the current shortage . But transportation costs make the Dutch tomatoes as expensive as local ones . In desperation , the Agriculture Ministry turned_to Jordan . Israel signed a peace_treaty with the neighboring Arab state last month , and the treaty went_into effect last week . But Jordanian officials turned_back the first post-peace shipment of tomatoes because much of it had been damaged in the picking process , said Ronni Hassid , a spokesman for the Israeli Agriculture Ministry . &quot; We hope to try again , with a new shipment , on Sunday , &quot; Hassid said , adding that the ministry hopes to start importing 100 tons of tomatoes a day by the start of next week . The tomato shortage was caused partly by farmers ' anticipation that inexpensive fruits and vegetables would start flowing in from the Gaza Strip after Palestinian autonomy was instituted there in May , Hassid said . &quot; We advised the farmers to plant something else instead of tomatoes , &quot; he said . But earlier this month , Israel banned the import of Gazan produce after several dozen cases of cholera were discovered in the impoverished strip . Within days of the ban , the price of tomatoes began to rise . Consumers started to complain , but they kept buying . They were not even deterred by Finance_Minister Avraham Shohat ' s televised advice earlier this week that prices would fall if Israelis would stop buying . &quot; When I was a child growing_up , I didn ' t eat tomatoes in the winter , and I didn ' t turn_out so badly , &quot; Shohat told a television_reporter . &quot; What does Shohat know ? &quot; said Eli Mizrachi , a produce seller in Mahane Yehuda , a popular open-air_market in Jerusalem . &quot; He ' s too busy eating tomatoes to worry about their price. &quot; Mahane Yehuda is where the capital ' s shoppers buy high-quality fruits and vegetables at bargain prices . Mizrachi was selling tomatoes Thursday for eight shekels a kilo -- about $ 1.20 per pound . &quot; We don ' t have a choice but to buy them , &quot; said Mark Edelman , a shopper who handed Mizrachi a bag of tomatoes to weigh . &quot; Besides , the price of all food is expensive , so we would have to stop eating everything if we stopped buying because of the price. &quot; Indeed , although tomatoes jumped 53 % in price in October , other popular items of produce were not far behind . Cabbage rose 46.3 % , eggplant increased in price by 36.6 % and cucumbers rose by 28.2 % . All are staples of the Israeli diet .</TEXT>
