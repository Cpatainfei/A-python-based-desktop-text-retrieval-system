   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / LAWRENCE J . MAGID : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; D.C. GETS ON-LINE WITH THE PUBLIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After several days skulking around White_House offices and talking with people in and out of government , I ' ve come_to the conclusion that the use of technology to improve citizen access to government information may turn_out to be the Clinton_Administration ' s most enduring legacy . Staff_members at the White_House Office of Science and Technology Policy are justifiably proud_of the progress made this year on the Administration ' s national information infrastructure . One goal , according to OSTP special assistant David Lytel , is to &quot; make government information easily available to the public. &quot; To that end , the White_House has encouraged all federal agencies to disseminate information via the Internet , computer bulletin_boards and even commercial on-line services . Easy is a relative term . Using the Internet is still a challenge for most people , but it ' s getting better . One development is the increased use of the World Wide Web . The web makes_it possible for agencies or companies to create their own menu and icon-based graphic interface , with leads not only to their own information but to data from other organizations . Each web site has its own &quot; home page , &quot; which serves as a pointer to additional information from that and other sites . Just about anyone with access to the Internet can peruse web pages , but to see graphics you need a special type of Internet account and special software . Mosaic , a federally developed public-domain program , is available for Windows , Macintosh and other systems . Some commercial Internet providers , including Netcom ( ( 800 ) 501-8649 ) , provide similar software for use on_their_own systems . Although it hasn ' t been publicly announced , the White_House will unveil its own World Wide Web home page next month , sources say . But you don ' t have to wait to access White_House documents . The White_House already posts news releases and transcripts of presidential speeches , radio addresses and other documents on commercial on-line services and on the Internet . Subscribers to CompuServe , Prodigy , America Online and GEnie can also access White_House discussion forums . And anyone with access to Internet electronic_mail can get instructions on how to obtain documents by sending an e-mail message to publica-tions.whitehouse.gov. The message can be blank or contain the word help . Information from the White_House and more_than 60 other federal agencies is available via FedWorld , a service of the Commerce_Department ' s National Technical Information Service . NTIS , which receives no taxpayer funds for information dissemination , stays in business by selling specialized government information . But it also offers a lot of free information and serves as a gateway to other government_agencies . FedWorld ' s databases include documents from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , the Office of Management and Budget , the Consumer Information Center and the Department_of_Agriculture . You also find federal job openings and information about federal grants and funding programs . Files are updated daily . You can access FedWorld via the Internet ( Telnet fedworld ) or through WWW at http : / / www / fedworld.gov. You can dial into FedWorld ' s electronic_bulletin_board at ( 703 ) 321-8020 . The Library of Congress ' Marvel system is another rich source of government information . You can reach Marvel ' s main menu by typing gopher marvel.loc.gov. Gopher is another Internet menuing system ; it doesn ' t display graphics , but it is relatively easy to use . From the main gopher , you can browse the Library of Congress ' card_catalogues and access information from federal agencies and both houses of Congress . Select the &quot; government information &quot; option and you ' ll be able to get information from the federal_government and numerous state and local_governments . Interested in outer space ? NASA Information Services -- including images from outer space -- can be reached on the World Wide Web by typing http : / / hypatia.gsfc.nasa.gov. How about the environment ? The Environmental Protection Agency has an enormous amount of information available via the Internet . The EPA ' s main menu can be reached by typing gopher gopher.epa.gov. Many agencies offer information on grants and contracts . The National Institutes of Health hasgopher.nih.gov , which provides grant and research information among other data . The Department_of_Education ' s web page can be reached at http : / / www.ed.gov / or you can reach a menu of agency resources by typing gopher.ed.gov. Data includes a &quot; Teacher ' s Guide to the U.S. Office of Education &quot; and a listing of educational software you can download for free . The Small Business Administration ' s Web page http : / / www.sbaonline.sba.gov / is particularly impressive , especially if you have Mosaic or another program that makes_it possible to view graphics . You can take a tour of the agency , its services and its offices , or click on a map of the United States to locate SBA offices around the country . The service provides detailed information on SBA programs , including those for managing , financing or expanding your business . Even the National Information Infrastructure Task_Force , which is spearheading the Administration ' s forays_into cyberspace , has its own information on-line : Type gopher iitf.doc.gov. Researchers , telecommunications entrepreneurs and nonprofit groups will be especially interested in the information about the grant programs . Non-Internet users can reach a similar bulletin_board at ( 202 ) 482-1199 . As you start to explore these information sites , you ' ll notice that one menu or home page leads to another . It ' s easy to get lost , but once you get_the_hang of it , it ' s also pretty easy to discover more sources of information . Get ready for some delays when using any of these services . The on-line federal information sites aren ' t quite as sluggish as the Beltway at rush_hour , but they ' re getting there . The dreaded traffic_jams on the information highway are already upon us . Computer_File welcomes your comments . Write to Lawrence J . Magid , 898 Chestnut St . Suite 3 , Red-wood City , CA 94063 , or message magid.latimes.com on the Internet or KPVN58A on Prodigy .</TEXT>
