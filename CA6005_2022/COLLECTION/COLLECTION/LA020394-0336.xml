   <HEADLINE> SOUTH O.C. AUTO MALL PLANNERS DEAL WITH REALITIES ; MARKETING : RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA SITE ' S SUCCESS DEPENDS_ON IMPROVING ECONOMY , THOUGH IT IS THOUGHT TO HAVE A GREAT LOCATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Building a 36-acre auto mall in the midst of a four-year slump in car sales might seem like financial suicide , but the developer of this planned community is undaunted and Orange County auto dealers say such a South County mall could be a winner . Auto malls -- the car industry ' s version of regional shopping_centers -- generally are conceded to be the future of new car marketing . But the key to this mall ' s success is timing . And only time , the experts say , will tell whether the mall ' s developer -- Santa Margarita Co. , also the master developer of the entire 5 # 000-acre planned community of Rancho Santa Margarita -- is being prescient or imprudently premature . The smart_money seems to favor foresightedness , but if the region ' s economy does not start improving , all bets are off , said Kevin Allen , executive_director of the Orange County Automobile Dealers Assn . And there are problems to be dealt with . One is that a group of homeowners has risen in opposition , claiming that the auto center was not revealed until after they bought properties overlooking the site . They say they fear the traffic and brightly lit lots will be unsightly and reduce property values . In addition , California law gives existing dealers the right to challenge a competing dealership opening within a 10-mile radius . The Santa Margarita Auto Center will be about eight miles from the Irvine Auto Center with its 16 franchises , including most of the major domestic and Japanese brands , and the Mission Viejo strip , which has three luxury car dealerships . &quot; Car malls are the future of the business , &quot; said Bob Fitzharris , who conducts consultant J.D. Power and Associates ' annual auto mall study . &quot; But unless the economy turns_around pretty quickly , there could be a lot of challenges &quot; filed against manufacturers who want to set dealerships in Rancho Santa Margarita . Such a challenge is filed against the manufacturer , not the potential new dealer . That puts the complaining dealership in the position of fighting the factory that supplies its cars , and tends to give the manufacturers a strong hand in the ensuing negotiations -- one reason , perhaps , that there are numerous dealers who compete daily with other franchises selling the same makes just a_few miles away . So far , only Ford has announced plans for a presence in Rancho Santa Margarita , leasing a four-acre site for Downey Ford owner Jim Graham ' s second dealership . And in what could be a good sign for the new mall , Graham and Ford won ' t be challenged by Bob Tuttle , co-managing partner of the Tuttle-Click Automotive Group and owner of the Ford and nine other dealerships in the Irvine Auto Center . Although located within the 10-mile protest area , Tuttle said that Ford representatives helped persuade him to accept a new competitor . If the mall were to open this year , &quot; then I would oppose it , &quot; Tuttle said . &quot; But since the soonest it can open is mid-1995 , then I am not opposed as a Ford dealer . We find it acceptable given the timing , the hope that the economy will start improving by then and the fact that most of the growth in Orange County is in the South County. &quot; A marketing study prepared_for the developer says that the population within a 12-mile radius of the mall site is expected to increase by 15 % , or 80 # 000 people , to a total of 611 # 400 by 1998 . At an average of four people and two cars to a household , that added population would need about 8 # 000 new and used cars a year , several dealers said . Mark Sumpf , an associate with Auto Center Group , the Newport Beach consulting firm that did the marketing studies , said the anticipated population growth and the distance that residents of Rancho Santa Margarita now must travel_to find new car_dealers or repair facilities were major considerations in the decision to go_ahead with the mall . The deciding factor , of course , was the belief -- one shared by most regional economists -- that Orange County ' s economy should start improving in 1995 . After discussions with several auto_manufacturers and Orange County car_dealers , Sumpf said there should be few challenges from other area dealers . The county has about 120 new car_dealers , although the number changes frequently with consolidations , bankruptcies , partnership breakups and new franchise deals . But there are only five auto malls in Orange County and two of those -- Garden Grove and Anaheim -- are relatively small , with fewer than six dealers each . Most of the rest of the county ' s car_dealers are clustered in a number of strips . The biggest , with about a dozen dealers and two_dozen brands of cars each , are_on Beach Boulevard in Huntington Beach and Harbor Boulevard in Costa Mesa , but most every city in the county has several new car lots . Santa Margarita Co . said it wants a car mall because it would provide a healthy draw for the 460-acre commercial center destined to be the heart of the planned community and because , if the community ever incorporates , it would provide a tremendous tax_base . Unlike baseball_diamonds in Iowa cornfields , though , auto malls don ' t come_with an if-you-build-it-they-will-come guarantee . But Rancho Santa Margarita ' s mall is thought to have a great location . With construction planned to start this summer , the mall ' s fall , 1995 , opening is expected to coincide with the extension of the Foothill tollway . &quot; Location , location , location , &quot; that ' s the key to auto mall success , said John Rettie , editor of J.D. Power and Assn. ' s California Report automotive newsletter . Equally important is getting enough dealers to create a critical mass -- six is the minium for sustained success , Power analyst Fitzharris said . Given an improving economy , getting that many dealers should not be a problem in Rancho Santa Margarita , because manufacturers are no longer reluctant to set_up shop surrounded by potential competitors . &quot; It ' s really the customer who dictates malls , &quot; said Reed Chesworth , vice_president of MacPherson Enterprises , which operates half_a_dozen franchises in the Tustin and Irvine auto centers . &quot; that ' s why dealers are in them . It makes_it easy for customers to do comparison shopping , provides convenience and a nice environment. &quot; MacPherson owner Joe MacPherson was the driving force behind the Tustin mall and moved his four Santa Ana dealerships there when it first opened in 1989 , just as the economy and car sales began souring . &quot; We did_it with the economy in mind , &quot; Chesworth said . &quot; We just didn ' t think the slump would last this long. &quot; Even with a recession , he said , his dealerships all have consistently better sales and higher customer counts than when they were in central Santa Ana and the economy was booming . Not every dealer is a mall fan , however . Gary Gray , owner of Orange Coast Jeep Eagle on Costa Mesa ' s self-titled Harbor Boulevard of Cars , said he finds the heavily traveled street to be a much better location than any mall . &quot; I catch the guy driving down the road who might not even be thinking_of buying a car until he sees something juicy I ' ve got_on display out front and pulls_in , &quot; Gray said . &quot; He never even goes_to the malls. ' Another Jeep-Eagle dealer , Rick Evans of Huntington Jeep-Eagle , said he was attracted by a package of information he received last week from the Santa Margarita mall developers . &quot; I put it in my ' things to read file , ' which is a lot better than most of my mail gets. &quot; Although he has no plans to leave Huntington Beach , Evans said that Rancho Santa Margarita would be a logical place for him to set_up a second Jeep-Eagle dealership . He would be joining a statewide trend -- analyst Rettie estimates that 23 % of all new cars in California are sold in auto malls , compared to just 7 % nationwide . The first auto mall in the nation , in fact , was the Riverside Auto Center , built_in 1965 . And the three largest malls -- by number of franchises , acreage and gross sales volume -- are in California as well . Rettie said that he expects 25 % of all U.S. new-car sales to be logged by franchises in auto malls within 10 years , partly because the number of malls will increase and continued dealership consolidation . J.D. Powers has predicted that by 2005 there will be only 5 # 000 new car_dealers in the United States , down from about 16 # 000 now . But those dealers would control 20 # 000 individual franchises . O.C. Auto Malls Orange County auto malls range from the three-dealer facility in Garden Grove to the giant 20-dealer cluster in Tustin .
