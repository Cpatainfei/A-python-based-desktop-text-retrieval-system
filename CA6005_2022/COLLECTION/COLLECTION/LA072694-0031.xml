   <TEXT> Alexander_Graham_Bell spoke through a wire to his colleague Thomas Watson in 1876 . &quot; Come here , &quot; he said , the first command uttered on a telephone . Oh , what Mr. Bell wrought . Around the world , different cultures have developed characteristic phone manners since Bell ' s day . No people open a call with more effusive hospitality than the Arabs . Whatever the subject of the conversation , it begins with what seems like five minutes of generally meaningless but absolutely essential greetings . A ringing phone is answered : &quot; May your morning be good. &quot; &quot; May your morning be_full of light , &quot; the caller responds . &quot; Praise God , your voice is welcome. &quot; &quot; Welcome , welcome. &quot; &quot; How are you ? &quot; &quot; Praise God. &quot; &quot; Praise God. &quot; &quot; What news ? Are you well ? Your family well ? &quot; &quot; Praise God . How are you ? &quot; &quot; All is_well . All is_well . Welcome . Welcome. &quot; Only then might the reason for the call be mentioned . And the goodbys will take almost as long and are again excruciatingly polite . Compared to the Arab world , responses elsewhere are the soul of brevity : Britons and Americans generally say &quot; Hello , &quot; although the latter sometimes simply say &quot; Yes , &quot; and if they ' re in business or the military they may just answer with their surnames : &quot; Smith. &quot; The French answer their phones with the familiar &quot; Allo , &quot; and they often add their name and the phrase &quot; Qui est a l ' appareil ? &quot; that is , &quot; Who is_on the phone ? &quot; In a number of countries , calls are answered with a touch of suspicion or curiosity , a reluctance to talk until it ' s clear who the caller is . Italians answer &quot; Pronto , &quot; or &quot; Ready , &quot; and then it ' s the caller who demands &quot; Chi parla ? &quot; -- &quot; Who ' s speaking ? &quot; -- assuming the right to know the identity of the person at the other end . Germans tend to answer the phone by barking their last_names : &quot; Schmidt &quot; or &quot; Mueller , &quot; even the women -- and even if they have titles , like Herr Doktor , which in other circumstances they would insist upon . In Copenhagen , Danes will answer with both first and last_names , even women : &quot; Karen Andersen. &quot; In Spain , the response to a ringing telephone is : &quot; Diga , &quot; or &quot; Speak. &quot; &quot; Diga &quot; is also a common response in Mexico , but Mexicans usually answer &quot; Bueno , &quot; meaning &quot; Good &quot; or &quot; Well. &quot; Like the Italians , the Mexicans will demand : &quot; Where am I calling ? &quot; And if they have the wrong number , they ' ll indignantly hang_up , sometimes with a curse , as if it were the respondent ' s fault . Because of a cultural tendency to speak cautiously with strangers , callers must clearly identify themselves and state their purpose . Even then , the respondent may become vague and evasive . &quot; Is this the Mexico State Justice_Department ? &quot; a caller might ask . &quot; I would n ' t know what to tell you , &quot; is the answer . Business people and government officials commonly refuse to speak_to strangers on the phone even if it concerns simple inquiries like &quot; Where can I buy one of your vacuum_cleaners ? &quot; The train system won ' t divulge ticket fares or schedules on the phone ; you must go_to the station and ask_in person . * In Brazil , after slowly and patiently dialing a number , if you are lucky enough to get an answer , the respondent will say : &quot; Who ' s talking ? &quot; not to be rude but to make_sure the right number has been reached . Goodbys are elaborate , as if in_person : &quot; A hug &quot; is a frequent sign-off , even to end formal business calls . &quot; A kiss &quot; is more casual , with someone you know personally . And the response in both cases is &quot; Outro , &quot; &quot; Another. &quot; Like American teen-agers , many cultures have love_affairs with the phone , none more_than the Italians . They talk endlessly with relatives , friends and schoolmates . The telephone_call has replaced formal letters of invitation , congratulations and condolences . As almost everywhere else , the cellular_phone , called a telefonino in Italy , has become a popular status symbol , used widely and indiscriminately . Telefonini have recently been barred from parliamentary sessions , for instance . * In Germany the telephone is hardly ubiquitous . You can get an unlisted number at no extra charge , and information operators will not indicate the fact to callers -- in_effect denying your existence . One wrinkle that arrived under Germany ' s liberal immigration policy : the installation of illegal phone_booths where foreigners can call home without paying long-distance tariffs . Officials of cellular-phone networks have countered the trend by blocking all calls going_to Pakistan , Togo , Gambia and Vietnam . * In Russia , like most things , phone use is affected by the growing gap between rich and poor , new and old , foreign and Russian . So mobile phones are big hits among the rich , but most Russians have no phones at all . Thus ads for apartment rentals specify &quot; telephone &quot; with the same pride as &quot; garbage chute &quot; or &quot; closet. &quot; For those with phones , the answer to a ring is the_French &quot; Allo , &quot; which can be pronounced to reflect wide degrees of happiness or annoyance . Also popular are the curt &quot; Da , &quot; or &quot; Yes , &quot; and &quot; Slushayu vas , &quot; or &quot; I am listening to you. &quot; Because of the history of KGB taps , Russians are still careful of being overheard , often using the phrase , &quot; It ' s not telephone_conversation , &quot; to warn a caller to be discreet . Often in Moscow an alien conversation will break_into yours , and sometimes , according to Muscovites , you can ' t help listening . These aural glimpses show a Russian life that is never the relaxed , gossipy &quot; reach_out and touch someone &quot; conversations so typical in America . Instead they have some urgent goal -- such_as arranging a meeting or a deal . &quot; The reason for this urgency is the poor quality , &quot; says a Moscow resident . &quot; Pay phones are unreliable and the caller wants to get his message across before the connection breaks down. &quot; In closed Arab societies , the telephone is a means of contact for those forbidden to see each other in_person . A woman will call random numbers asking_for &quot; Mohammed , &quot; and when she finds a voice she likes , will strike_up a conversation . In India , you wait up_to seven years for a phone -- so when the connection is finally made_it often prompts a neighborhood party . The euphoria ends about a month later when the first bill arrives and the subscribers realize how much it costs . In the Indian middle-class home , the telephone occupies the place of honor , often atop its special table , and is usually kept locked to prevent neighbors from making calls . But in the countryside where 70 % of Indians live , phones are still a rarity : In some cases there is not a single phone in a village . In Southeast_Asia , almost everyone uses a version of &quot; Hello &quot; to answer the phone . Hong Kong Chinese say , &quot; Wei. &quot; In countries like Thailand , Vietnam and Indonesia , with a shortage of phone_lines and a two-year waiting_list , cellular_phones are prized , but expensive -- running $ 500 to $ 1 # 000 in Singapore and twice that elsewhere . Bangkok ' s most popular radio program is a call-in show with phoners talking while stuck_in the city ' s infamous traffic . Many posh restaurants have signs saying , &quot; No Handphones , &quot; because people are fed up with the guy at the next table shouting into a phone . Some cinemas show trailers indicating that it is rude to talk on the phone during the movie . In Japan , the person answering will customarily say , &quot; Moshi moshi , &quot; the equivalent of &quot; Hello , &quot; or perhaps &quot; Hai , &quot; that is , &quot; Yes. &quot; If he or she has the right connection , the caller may say something like &quot; Osewa ni natte imasu , &quot; or &quot; I am indebted to you for your kindness. &quot; Sometimes people bow over a phone , although the other party cannot see the bow . Many older Japanese , who never saw phones until the era of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics , continue to use ceremonial phrases and bows over the telephone -- as if it weren ' t there . The standard goodby is &quot; Ja , mata &quot; -- &quot; See you later &quot; -- with the word &quot; Sayonara &quot; reserved only for occasions of a long or final parting . In many Third_World countries it definitely helps to know an operator . The Indian writer Khushwant Singh remembers trying to place a call from New Delhi to Lahore in neighboring Pakistan -- when services were notoriously bad . After hours of trying , Singh was contacted by the international operator who suggested that she had relatives in Pakistan who had wanted to visit India but needed visas . Being a member_of_Parliament , she said , he might come_up with the necessary stamps . Singh accepted the deal and within three minutes his connection was through .
