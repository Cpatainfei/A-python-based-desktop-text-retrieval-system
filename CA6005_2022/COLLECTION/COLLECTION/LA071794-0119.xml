   <HEADLINE> SCORING GOALS ; THE WORLD CUP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AS POLITICAL PARABLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Who do you like in the World Cup ? When Germany played Bulgaria , German Americans backed Germany , Bulgarian Americans and perhaps other Slavic Americans backed Bulgaria . That was fairly predictable . But when the match is between Italy and Brazil , where does the American sentimental allegiance fall ? Do we take our stand with Brazil in the Western_Hemisphere or with Italy in the Northern ? As the eagle flies , Washington is only a little further from Rio than it is from Rome . But these days , which route does the American_eagle prefer to fly : east-west or north-south ? Latino sympathy pretty clearly rides with Brazil . &quot; Solos contra el Mundo , &quot; trumpets the headline on the July 14 Nuestro Tiempo , &quot; Brasil el ultimo representante de America &quot; : &quot; Alone against the world , Brazil the last representative of America. &quot; America there means the Americas , not the United States . But does pan-American solidarity outweigh Euro-American solidarity ? Not for Italian Americans and probably not for most European Americans . It ' s fun to think_about these matters when nothing more is at stake than the world championship in a sport most Americans don ' t follow . But the underlying question , a question of national identity , is as rich , and interesting , as it is difficult . Wolf Lepenies , rector of the Berlin Wissenschaftskolleg , Germany ' s equivalent of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton , recently greeted a group of visiting Americans with a soccer story . Twenty years ago on his first visit to the United States , he watched a soccer game played_on an American_football field : &quot; How far apart America and Europe were became painfully clear to me when the announcer excitedly shouted : ' And now , ladies and gentlemen , we have a free_kick from the 45-yard line ! ' &quot; The distance between football and Fussball ( German for soccer ) may seem a matter of small moment , but Lepenies linked that memory of his to another . German Chancellor Helmut Kohl held a reception for visiting American foundation heads . Why , he asked , were they so little inclined to get involved in Europe ? &quot; You know , &quot; came the lapidary answer , &quot; we tend to invest in the more interesting parts of the world. &quot; &quot; This was before 1989 , &quot; Lepenies adds ruefully . Since 1989 , he says , the collapse of communism has not just unleashed long-dormant intra-European hostilities , it has also provoked scarcely foreseeable antipathy toward the United States . No longer needed as the Lady Bountiful of the Marshall Plan or the Captain Courageous of NATO , the United States may now be resented with impunity . And yet , Lepenies says , the American experience may be more relevant than ever in Europe . He quotes the great 19th-Century German historian Leopold von Ranke , who , refusing to see Europe and the United States as opposites , expressed his view , somewhat astonishingly , as follows : &quot; New York and Lima are growing nearer to us than Kiev and Smolensk. &quot; Though Lima may be spiritually a bit further from Berlin now than it was then , New York is closer . As for Kiev and Smolensk , they are at least as distant as ever , the Iron_Curtain having been replaced by a Silken Curtain of trade_barriers and immigration quotas . The United States has its own trade and immigration problems , of course , but NAFTA has lowered the trade_barriers , and Lepenies sees the European future in the current American immigration struggles rather as Jacob Burghardt , another great 19th-Century German historian , saw &quot; an experiment in the European future &quot; in the multiethnic European state that had come_to_life in North_America . The question , of course , is whether the United States can manage this feat once again with a population so large and diverse that there is scarcely a World Cup team for which Americans cannot cheer . And yet if we do succeed , ours will be , once again , a historic success . For now at any rate , let us celebrate historic success that is far less profound : the culmination of a highly successful World Cup tournament in Pasadena ' s Rose Bowl . May the best team win .</TEXT>
