   <HEADLINE> NO PATH BEATEN TO SOCCER VICTORS ' DOOR ; SPORT : ALL IS SERENE AT U.S. TEAM ' S DANA POINT HOTEL , WHERE AN EX-FOOTBALL COACH MAKES BIGGER SPLASH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a 44-year wait , you ' d think there would be a toast , a party , something . Instead , many of the guests at the Dana Point Resort , where the U.S. soccer team is staying for the World Cup and sports editors are having a convention , had no idea who the guys sporting the crisp new U.S.A. hats were , let alone what they had done . Just in case somebody drop-kicked you Wednesday night and you missed it : the U.S. squad notched the biggest victory in American soccer in nearly half a century , dropping Colombia , 2-1 . You ' ve heard of the Miracle on Ice in the ' 80 Olympics and the Miracle Mets of ' 69 -- well , this was the Miracle on Grass . But you could hardly tell that Thursday -- The Day After -- in and around the team ' s hotel . For all_the excitement and fans , there might as well have been a convention of Maytag repairmen in town . Vince Lima , banquet waiter : &quot; Well , no , it ' s been pretty quiet. &quot; Quiet ? There would be more noise at a meeting of mimes . &quot; Well , maybe nobody knows they ' re here , &quot; Lima sighed . * Stephan Kachani , a hotel valet parking attendant , said he ' s not sure people could recognize a U.S. World Cup soccer player even if they knew the team was here . After all , they ' re not like professional_basketball players or football_players , he said . &quot; They ' re all so . . . so . . . tiny , &quot; he said . And so it was that only 24 hours after what was arguably the greatest day in U.S. soccer history , team member Ernie Stewart , he of the game-clinching goal , did his laundry , teammate Paul Caligiuri slept_in and former Dallas Cowboys football_coach Jimmy Johnson , at the Dana Point Resort_to address a gathering of the Associated Press Sports Editors , got a bigger police escort than the entire U.S. soccer squad . As if there needed to be any more evidence that soccer , favorite sport of the rest of the civilized world , has yet to catch_on in this country . Aside from the throng of reporters who interviewed the players Thursday afternoon at the hotel , it ' s a good bet that the U.S. soccer team was bigger news just about anywhere else in the world . Overheard at the stately hotel ' s front desk near where the players were being interviewed by reporters from France , the_Netherlands and points beyond : Woman 1 : &quot; What ' s going_on here ? &quot; Woman 2 : &quot; The U.S. soccer team is here. &quot; Woman 1 : &quot; You ' re kidding. &quot; Pause . &quot; Did you know they had a shuttle that goes_to the hotel beauty_parlor ? &quot; Joe Schroeder of San Diego , who was attending a credit_union meeting at the hotel , heard the U.S. soccer team was in the next room . Did he know what any of them looked_like ? &quot; Not really , &quot; he said . &quot; They don ' t really stand_out . They ' re not 6-foot-9 or anything. &quot; Laurel Schmidt of Rancho Santa Margarita , who was at a park just down the knoll from the hotel : &quot; You ' d think they ' d be mobbed. &quot; You ' d think . But then again . . . . Schmidt thought it was bigger news that Johnson , the football_coach , was at the hotel . &quot; He came_in a helicopter and had probably five or six police_cars as an escort , &quot; she observed . &quot; Soccer has just never been as popular a sport here , &quot; she said , almost apologizing . For their part , the players seemed to be a patient , forgiving lot . If they play , they seem to think , the fans will come . . . eventually . &quot; I have been asked so many questions over the past couple of months . . . about the future of soccer . I can ' t worry about that , &quot; said Alexi Lalas , a mop-headed , 25-year-old rock guitar_player turned elite defender . &quot; I don ' t care if two people tune_in to the game Sunday , &quot; he shrugged , referring to the upcoming contest against the Romanian team , which is also staying in Orange County . &quot; We ' re still going_to play in the World Cup. &quot; Stewart , the striker who scored what ended_up being the game-winning goal Wednesday , said America ' s young people have a case of soccer fever , so it ' s only a matter of time . &quot; I don ' t think we should look_at it happening next year or the year after that . It ' s just not realistic , &quot; said Stewart , who said he took the opportunity to &quot; do laundry &quot; Thursday . Added Caligiuri , who did his interviews with his 4-year-old daughter , Ashley , crawling on his lap : &quot; I wasn ' t really aware of the World Cup until I was 10 , 11 , 12 years old. &quot; He said it was enough to see the 90 # 000-plus fans chanting &quot; U-S-A &quot; at Wednesday ' s contest and see motorists paint their cars with the improbable outcome of the game . Actually , there is hope that soccer will gain a toehold , so to speak . Before discovering that the U.S. squad ' s first_team wasn ' t practicing at the Mission Viejo training facility Thursday morning , about 100 people had lined the grassy hills above the soccer fields to get a glimpse of their heroes . Wednesday ' s &quot; win was the best , I ' m totally into this soccer kick now , &quot; said Alicia Martin , 17 , a Sherman Oaks resident who sat on a blanket with three friends . &quot; I think the U.S. is going all_the way . I just hope I can find tickets &quot; for Sunday ' s game against Romania . Several brokers reported sales booming for World Cup tickets , particularly for games involving the U.S. team . &quot; A ticket for Sunday that was $ 45 before ( the victory over Colombia ) is now costing $ 65 , &quot; said Lance Keller , manager of Murray ' s , an Anaheim ticket agency . &quot; We ' ve had a lot more people calling us today than ever before looking_for Cup tickets. &quot; Meanwhile , back at the hotel in Dana Point , Schroeder , the businessman there for the credit_union meeting , said his kids , after seeing sweeper Marcelo Balboa perform an acrobatic &quot; bicycle kick &quot; Wednesday , immediately padded out_to the back yard to give_it_a_try . &quot; They saw that kick three different times on replay and they immediately went_out back and started trying it , &quot; he said , adding , &quot; and these are kids who sleep_with their baseball mitts. &quot; Ah , baseball . America ' s true national pastime . For now . * RELATED STORIES : C1 , C13-C16 , D2</TEXT>
