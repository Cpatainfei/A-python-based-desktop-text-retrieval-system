   <TEXT> Luis Donaldo Colosio , widely expected to be Mexico ' s next president , was assassinated Wednesday in this border city -- a killing that stunned the nation and cast a cloud_over the future of its scheduled August national elections . Colosio , 44 , was pronounced dead of gunshot wounds shortly after 8 p.m. , said Lievano Sainz , spokesman for the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party , known as the PRI , which had chosen Colosio as its presidential candidate in November . &quot; It is with great grief that I announce that , despite the efforts of doctors , Luis Donaldo Colosio . . . has died , &quot; Sainz told a somber crowd of journalists and onlookers gathered_in the smoke-filled lobby of Tijuana ' s General Hospital , where Colosio had undergone emergency surgery . Cries of disbelief emerged from the disconsolate crowd , guarded by black-uniformed Tijuana police and plainclothes state and federal police . &quot; Murder ! &quot; and &quot; Assassin ! &quot; shouted some of those who jammed the lobby and steps of the hospital . Colosio was shot twice -- once in the head and once in the abdomen -- shortly after 5 p.m. in a Tijuana neighborhood not far from the city airport . A suspect , identified by authorities as Mario Aburto Martinez , 23 , was in the custody of Federal Judicial Police . He reportedly told police who interrogated him , &quot; I saved Mexico ! &quot; Also detained was Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela , 47 . Authorities initially were unclear whether he was a witness or a suspect . But they said late Wednesday that he was a former head of the homicide division of the Baja California State Judicial Police in Tijuana and was being held as a witness . Officials offered no immediate word about the motive for the assassination . Colosio ' s death shocked this nation , which prides itself on its political stability , and disrupted preparations for the Aug . 21 national elections . Because no ruling party presidential candidate has died since the PRI was founded more_than six decades ago , it was unclear how a successor will be named . But the process probably will involve the party hierarchy and federal elections officials , experts said . That issue , however , seemed a distant concern Wednesday evening , when an air of national mourning seemed to grip Mexicans , who stayed glued to their television_sets and radios awaiting word on Colosio ' s fate . He was shot after an hourlong campaign appearance in the poor neighborhood of Lomas Taurinas , a gritty community of unpaved roads and makeshift housing northeast of downtown . Wednesday was the first of a scheduled two-day campaign appearance in Baja California . Colosio , dressed casually in a brown Windbreaker and open-neck blue sport_shirt , spoke_for about an hour . As he had in recent appearances , he stressed the importance of development in poor neighborhoods . &quot; We are going_to bring the power of the citizenry to the presidency of Mexico , &quot; Colosio told residents . During his address , Colosio made_a_point of predicting victory for the ruling party in the state of Baja California , which is controlled by the rival National Action Party . &quot; Viva Baja ! &quot; Colosio said at the end of his address . Upon completing the speech , witnesses said , Colosio walked down a sloping dirt road , shaking hands with residents , as he headed back to his motorcade . He was shot at 5:08 p.m. &quot; I was looking down when I heard a shot , &quot; said Maria Vidal , a supporter who was walking with Colosio at the scene . &quot; I looked_up and saw the gun right in front of me . Then I saw him fall to the ground . Blood was coming_out of his head. &quot; After the shooting , what one witness called an &quot; avalanche of humanity &quot; descended on the confusing scene . Loud music blared as the candidate walked down the road , so many were initially unaware that Colosio had been shot . But the furious Tijuana crowd then surged around at least one of Colosio ' s apparent assailants , beating him savagely . Television broadcasts from the chaotic scene showed the suspect as a muscular man in his 20s . He appeared bloody and disheveled . Meantime , Colosio , critically wounded , was put into a Ram Charger truck and rushed_away . He was later transferred to an ambulance and taken_to Tijuana ' s General Hospital , where hundreds of people gathered . Some offered to donate the rare blood_type that Colosio was said to need . Physicians at one point hoped to transport Colosio to nearby UC San Diego Medical_Center , which could offer state-of-the-art trauma care . A helicopter was even dispatched for him around 7:30 p.m. , but he was judged to be in too delicate a condition to be moved . Dr. Rosalinda Guerra Moya , the Tijuana hospital ' s director , said a team of eight physicians sought to save Colosio . Among those attending him was Dr. Patricia Aubanel , who runs a clinic in Tijuana and practices at the prestigious Scripps Clinic in San Diego . Aubanel was the primary physician for Mother Teresa of Calcutta when the 83-year-old Roman_Catholic missionary and Nobel Prize_winner was treated in San Diego for a heart ailment and pneumonia in 1992 . But physicians said later that Colosio ' s head wound had been too severe . Throughout Mexico , there were denunciations of Colosio ' s murder . Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari -- who ordered the attorney_general to go_to Tijuana to investigate the killing -- called Colosio ' s assassination &quot; a vile act . . . that hurts us deeply. &quot; In San Cristobal de las Casas in the southern state of Chiapas , Manuel Camacho Solis , the government ' s peace negotiator and a longtime political rival of Colosio ' s , called the killing a &quot; grave offense to his family and a great , grave offense to all Mexicans. &quot; As angry Mexicans gathered at the police_station where the suspect was said to be held , others at the hospital complained about the poor security at Colosio ' s campaign stop . By contrast , some said that security was much tighter during a recent visit to Tijuana by Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , presidential candidate of the National Action Party . &quot; This is not the deranged act of a fanatic , &quot; said Lourdes Felgueres , a human_rights activist and ruling party supporter who was present at the rally . &quot; This is the work of a hired killer . He knew exactly what he was doing . Justice must be done. &quot; For Mexico , and especially its ruling party , the assassination could not have come at a more difficult time . The government was badly embarrassed in January by the Indian uprising in Chiapas that left at least 145 people dead . Grass-roots rebels are now considering details of a tentative peace accord . Colosio ' s shooting also came one day after Camacho Solis announced that he would not run_for president . The prospective candidacy of Camacho Solis had threatened to split the ruling party since January . Tension about August ' s elections has been mounting steadily since the Chiapas uprising . The rebels have called_for broad national reforms leading toward a truer democracy ; Salinas had pledged to push for a more democratic electoral process . Mexican lawmakers on Wednesday were considering a broad package of reforms . In Washington , a State_Department spokesman expressed shock , horror and sorrow over Colosio ' s assassination . Colosio was an amiable politician whose open manner contrasted with the stiff persona of many Mexican lawmakers . But Colosio had been controversial since he was named as the party ' s candidate Nov . 28 . Salinas , exercising a traditional prerogative of Mexican presidents , personally chose Colosio -- a native of the border state of Sonora and a longtime protege -- as his likely successor , passing_over Camacho Solis and other rivals . But critics complained that Colosio adhered too closely to Salinas ' view on free_trade and other neo-liberal economic_policies of the PRI . Since the Chiapas rebellion , he had been distancing himself from Salinas ' economic plans , stressing the need to help the great numbers of poverty-stricken Mexicans . Within the PRI , which has been synonymous with government here since its founding in 1929 , Colosio was considerably more popular . Party stalwarts favored him for the presidency , confident that he would do nothing to erode the PRI ' s longtime dominance . He was also much favored by this nation ' s business_community and international investors who , via the Mexican markets , expressed deep displeasure at the mere prospect that Camacho Solis might challenge Colosio . Before being named PRI presidential candidate , Colosio headed Mexico ' s vast Social Development secretariat , which included a multibillion-dollar anti-poverty initiative called Solidarity . In the wake of the Chiapas rebellion , many criticized Solidarity as a program that did little to resolve the pressing problems of rural and urban poverty that still characterize Mexico . Colosio also served as a PRI senator and chairman of the national party . An economist , he was a native of Magdalena de Kino , near the Arizona border , and did postgraduate work_at the University of Pennsylvania and in Austria . His survivors include his wife , Diana Laura Riojas , an economist , and two children , Luis Donaldo , 7 , and Mariana , 10 . Rotella reported from Tijuana and McDonnell from Los Angeles . Times staff writers Fernando Romero in Tijuana and Anthony Perry and Chris Kraul in San Diego and Juanita Darling in Mexico_City , as well as Susan Drummet of The Times ' Mexico_City Bureau , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
