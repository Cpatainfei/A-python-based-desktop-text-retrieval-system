   <HEADLINE> ALLIGATOR ' S MONDAYS NEW AND IMPROVISED ; EXPERIMENTAL ARTISTS ARE FEATURED IN SANTA MONICA CLUB ' S NEW MUSIC MONDAY SERIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You might not like it . Not even the musicians who play it always like it ; that ' s a law of experimental music , &quot; new &quot; music , avant-garde , whatever you want to call it . Risking a kick from the classicist boot , you might even call it jazz . Why not ? The word has been flexible enough to include ragtime , Dixieland , swing , be-bop , hard bop , modal , free jazz , jazz fusion . If they ' re all jazz , they have only one thing in common : improvisation . Improvisation is what Nels Cline , guitarist of the Nels Cline Trio , has_in_mind when he books the New Music Mondays he ' s been hosting at Santa Monica ' s Alligator Lounge for more_than a year now . And newness . Cline says what he puts_on the Monday-night stage is about &quot; a kind of skewed multiculturalism , the effects of people hearing a lot of stuff -- how it changed them , and how they didn ' t take the tried-and-true path and ended_up with their own kind of music. &quot; It ' s a scene of individuals . At root , their music is what jazz always has been : change and challenge . It won ' t accept models , and it won ' t stand_still . For instance : On the left side of the low stage , G . E . Stinson lets his fingers scratch_out an almost funky guitar riff about three-quarters of the way to a standard realization before strangling it and beating it into a dissonant chord . He likes the effect , so he does_it again . He ' s come_up with a rhythm out of this , and on the other side of the stage , bassist Steuart Liebig has picked_up on it and starts inserting precise slides , pops and echo-effect digital washes into the spaces . In back , Joe Berardi performs the opposite of standard drummer chores : instead of reinforcing the newly established beat , he plays off it with lopsided rolls , tinkles and crashes . In the middle , seated on a high stool , Japanese vocalist Kaoru moans a word , cuts_in a phrase . Her microphone is plugged into an effects machine ; she twiddles its controls to sample and repeat her vocals for rhythmic input , or to cathedralize them for godvoice authority . Or , since the sounds of the rest of the band are also leaking into her microphone , she can amplify her associates , turn them back on themselves , or mash them into a new paste . The mass gets denser . The in tervals between beats gets smaller and smaller , until everything blends into a roar . Stinson ' s guitar starts feeding_back ; Liebig ' s bass follows_suit . Berardi is pounding and thrashing now . It sounds as if the roof has been ripped_off of hell . This New Music Monday performance is by Unique Cheerful Events , a name Stinson settled upon after getting tired_of changing the band ' s name for every gig . Typical ? Here , there ' s no such thing . Next up could be a neoclassical improvisational chamber trio of violin , flute and bass_clarinet , or a steel-grip ' 90s version of a free-jazz quintet . Format , doormat . What matters is the level of commitment , invention and skill , and the Monday Alligator crowd knows about those . Look : people are listening . Teeth fluorescent under the purple influence of black light ( plugged_in so you can appreciate the primitive black-light paintings that glare from the blood-red walls ) , the audience , except for that occasional leather fetishist , skinhead or orange-mop , doesn ' t looks strange enough for the music . Squinting at the stage , patrons tilt pint glasses of Sierra_Nevada Pale Ale ( on_tap ) , dressed in jeans , tennis_shoes , faded plaid shirts or T ' s , hair unfussed . Boho maybe , but more like post-hippie . Age range of 25 to 45 . People who read books and listen to music . Hunched on a bar stool , regular customer Andy Rotter says he used to be a business litigator , and came_in contact with musical avanticians when his firm did some pro bono work for the Independent Composers Assn . in the early ' 80s . &quot; People come here , and they can take some chances , &quot; he says . &quot; Some things bomb , but that ' s one of the purposes of the series. &quot; Not to bomb , but to take_a_chance of bombing . No matter what , though , says another visitor , San Gabriel resident Shiroshi Goto , &quot; It makes you think differently. &quot; The scene ' s so-what intelli gence rules_out faddism , and indeed the history of experimental music is too unglamorous , intellectual and obscure to make_it a decent gimmick or dilettante fixation . Twentieth-century European composers like Schoenberg , Bartok and Berg , bored with classical harmony , rhythm and melody , got the bomb rolling in the early 1900s . But they weren ' t improvisation-minded . It took later theorists like John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen to reshuffle concepts of what composition was , and the influence of ' 60s explorers confused things more . Beginning in the ' 50s , Gunther Schuller and others merged classical and jazz elements into a &quot; third stream. &quot; Pianist Cecil Taylor made a unified message from thousands of flying bits of condensed information . In the mid- ' 60s , saxists John Coltrane and Albert Ayler pushed sonic / rhythmic abstraction as far as it could go . Anthony Braxton created a complex , static world of theoretical alienation and refused to swing . Here in Los Angeles , Charles Mingus experimented with European neoclassical forms and harmonies in the mid- ' 50s . Later in the decade , Texan Ornette Coleman formed a band here to perform his free , non-chord-based conceptions . Coming_out of the mold-breaking bands of Chico Hamilton and Mingus , L.A. windman Eric Dolphy superimposed atonality onto the rhythms of Charlie Parker and worked tough new meters and ensemble colors into his compositions . In the ' 80s and ' 90s , the local focus for experimental music slid_down to Long_Beach , where the California Outside Music Assn. , organized by Titus Levi and currently helmed by Walter Zooi , lobbied Long_Beach clubs for rare gigs for its members -- many of whom play the Alligator Mondays -- and hosted a yearly Day of Music that showcased the outest of the out . Until May , 1993 , when Cline shoehorned his trio into the Alligator slot and took_on responsibility for filling the rest of the bill each week , no L.A. venue regularly booked the weird stuff . But Cline doesn ' t think his own music is especially weird . &quot; I don ' t think_of myself as an avant-gardist , &quot; he says , &quot; I think_of myself as kind of a convoluter of tradition. &quot; He and his twin brother , drummer Alex Cline , grew_up listening to rock_bands like the Allman Brothers , Jimi Hendrix and Quicksilver Messenger Service ( &quot; I liberally rob John Cipollina &quot; ) and then ' 70s fusioneers such_as Ralph Towner , Tony Williams and Miles Davis ' electric groups ( &quot; We know every note on ' Live / Evil ' -- I bet we can sing every solo &quot; ) . After a time spent playing &quot; noisy , drony &quot; rock , the brothers started taking themselves more seriously as musicians and improved their technical and theoretical chops . In the ' 80s , their atmospheric , inventive chamber band with violinist Jeff Gauthier and bassist Eric von Essen , Quartet Music , was one of the few projects that couldn ' t be dropped into an easy file of jazz , classical or fusion . Sometimes concurrently , Cline worked in the critically loved pop / rock / funk band Bloc with guitarist Nick Kirgo , bassist Liebig , drummer Chris Mancinelli and vocalist Camille Henry . They made an album for A &amp; M , but never caught_fire commercially . Closing each New Music Monday ( unless Cline goes solo or duo ) , the Nels Cline Trio , Cline ' s current workshop with drummer Michael Preussner and bassist Bob Mair , shows all_the guitarist ' s background . His playing can be delicate , melodic and meditative , the qualities that fit_in best in Quartet Music . Other times , his twisting modern-bop flair could stack him alongside John Scofield . But he ' s most entertaining at the extremes of rock noisemaking where Hendrix once ruled , using his guitar as a direct emotional vehicle . &quot; Some people have suggested that it ' s because of my frustration and bitterness that I ' ve become a more interesting guitar_player , &quot; says Cline . But he wants his feelings to translate into something more universal . &quot; Beauty is what I want to do . Though my conception of beauty these days is something pretty raging. &quot; At the other two corners , drummer Preussner and bassist Mair display the kind of instant communication that comes only from playing together a lot . They shift from one edge of the sonic scale to the other without seeming even to think_about it . And that ' s especially remarkable considering they have no fixed repertoire . Cline is writing all_the time , and he ' ll often declare a given Monday a &quot; tribute &quot; night , wherein the trio will perform the music of another artist he likes -- Wayne Shorter , Polly Jean Harvey , Sonic Youth ' s Kim Gordon -- or focus_on the ineffable qualities that define some iconic personality such_as Charlotte Rampling or Anjelica Huston . These tributes may also come_with visual mood enhancers -- one night , supermodel posters . &quot; That was pretty undignified . I had a great time , &quot; Cline says . Cline has released a_couple_of fine CDs on the German Enja label as well as a pair of collectible chaos-intensive 45s that you ' d probably be able to find only at Rhino Records , where Cline used to work . ( These days he pays the bills by working_at a bookstore. ) Good as the records are , the sight of Cline onstage , davening over his strings , stomping his effects pedal or wiggling his whammy bar , is something to remember . The experimental-music com munity is tight . Many of the same musicians reconfigure to form different entities with entirely different sounds . One New Music Monday regular is Other Parts , a trio featuring flutist / vocalist Emily Hay ( a member of U-Totem and one of three rotating hosts of the Wednesday-night experimental-classical KXLU radio show &quot; Trilogy &quot; along with NMM perennials vocalist Bonnie Barnett and saxist Kim Richmond ) . Along with the group ' s instrumental interplay , Hay improvises ministories and melodies vocally . Like many of the scene ' s most versatile artists , she ' s classically trained but not classically constrained . &quot; A lot of it is imagery inside my head , &quot; says Hay , who works as a paralegal . &quot; And now that I ' ve been singing for a_few years , imagery that comes_out of words , experiences , or maybe a feeling I ' m getting from the audience . It ' s also interacting with the other musicians sonically , and whatever their mood is . And it ' s being able to be_on your feet and answer someone else ' s instrument or sound. &quot; Going outside is a choice ; it ' s not like these people can ' t do anything else . Unique Cheerful Events ' Kaoru : &quot; I was doing music business in Japan for five years -- that R &amp; B , Top 40 kind of thing . I released , like , five albums , and I wanted to change direction , but all_the record-company people hated it , because they wanted me to stay_on the same kind of thing . So I just came here. &quot; Here , she could break rules . &quot; I didn ' t like the idea of the singer being in front of the band -- I always wanted to interfere with the other instruments , and I could get different kinds of tones using the effects box. &quot; After his hitch with Bloc , Liebig also felt he had used_up what interested him about popular_music . He now plays with violinist Gauthier and trumpeter John Fumo ( the excellent drummer Jeff McCutchen recently died ) in Quartetto Stig , a composed / improvised project whose 9 Winds CD , Hommages Obliques , is one of the music ' s most fully realized artifacts . &quot; There ' s this thing about moving forward and trying to find_out what you find attractive , &quot; Liebig says . &quot; I got_into music-history classes at Northridge . I went nuts , hearing all this stuff that I ' d never heard , and some of it I hated , and some of it I went , ' Wow , this is really great. ' &quot; No discussion of L.A. edge music can omit Vinnie Golia . Like Kaoru , he started as a painter . One by one , he began to pick_up woodwind_instruments ; he ' s now proficient on 20 or 30 . Studies with Anthony Braxton and a careful ear to early Charles Mingus and a variety of modern classical_music pushed him to become the scene ' s most prodigious composer and most traveled ambassador . He ' s also its greatest promoter , through his 9 Winds label , on which he has released recordings by many whose music is too extreme for the major labels and most of the minors . Asked to point_out someone in the club who might serve as an impartial observer untainted by his acquaintance , Golia looks_around doubtfully . &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' ve been around a long_time . I ' m a pretty big stain. &quot; Naturally , Golia is a regular New Music Mondays performer , often in ad_hoc duos or trios.The Alligator is hardly big enough to display one of his acclaimed Large Ensembles of about 20 musicians , but any venue can be made to fit Golia , who , as one of his album titles says , is &quot; worldwide and portable. &quot; Echoes of his jagged , intense compositional / improvisational style can be heard in the music of many Alligator habitues , many of whom he ' s employed in one context or another . In addition to the L.A. army , Cline sometimes books outsiders of national stature . Mark Dresser awed the assembly with his compositions for solo bass -- no one expected to be nailed to the floor by one guy with a four-string . And maybe the most uncompromised performer was saxist Charles Gayle , who has made a media minisplash by getting his total-obliteration spiritual music heard despite being homeless on the streets of New York . Says Cline of Gayle , who stayed with him when he was in town , &quot; His mind was exploded by Coltrane . He carries everything he needs on his person . Even the food he was planning on eating , he already had with him when he stayed here . He had a special way that he ate it . And we gave him a Diet Pepsi . He liked that Diet Pepsi -- he was very excited about it . He drank half of it one morning , and half of it the next day. &quot; These are the rewards of being your own person . Small , but savorable . So why do they do_it ? Hay : &quot; I think that it arises out of abstract reasoning and thought . I think that to be able to open yourself up_to hear sound abstractly is an unusual thing. &quot; Liebig : &quot; Overamped , hyperthyroid curiosity . Sometimes the music is really annoying , and sometimes it ' s , like , godhead . And it ' s an eye-of-the beholder thing -- you and I can look_at the same thing and it ' s totally different. &quot; And who are they ? Cline : &quot; Seekers -- people who want to be enlightened in some way , or challenged . The spirit of challenge in art is not something that one things of when one thinks_of America. &quot; Especially Los Angeles . Liebig : &quot; People tend to think that L.A. is sort of the Motley Crue town , and they don ' t think that anything real is happening. &quot; But who cares what they think ? Cline : &quot; I still think that people are gonna find_out about this music and dig it . I know that seems really dumb . I sense the interest in people 10 , 15 years younger than me . I sense a lot of interest. &quot; And what makes him keep doing these shows ? &quot; I ' m astounded and humbled by hearing people who will confidently set things on their ear. &quot; * The Alligator Lounge is located at 3221 Pico Blvd , Santa Monica , ( 310 ) 449-1844 .</TEXT>
