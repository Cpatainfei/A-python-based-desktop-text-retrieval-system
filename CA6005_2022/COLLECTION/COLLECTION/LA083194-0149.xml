   <HEADLINE> 2-INCOME WORKER LOSES 1 , WINS 1 IN SUMMER OF LABOR DISPUTES ; JOBS : BASEBALL STOPPAGE IDLES MORT ROSE , A DODGER STADIUM PEANUT VENDOR . BUT HE PROBABLY WON ' T HAVE TO TAKE_PART IN A TEACHERS STRIKE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For weeks Mort Rose had been afraid that it would only take two strikes to get him out . He had lost the income from his job as a peanut vendor at Dodger Stadium because of the baseball strike . And until last weekend , he had been afraid that a threatened strike by Los Angeles teachers would cost him the salary from his other job -- teaching sixth grade at Selma Street Elementary School in Hollywood . So he was relieved that a teachers strike was probably averted when the Board_of_Education approved a new contract offer that would restore 8 % of the 10 % salary cut that teachers have absorbed for two years . &quot; At least I don ' t have to think_about that ( a teachers strike ) anymore , &quot; said Rose , sighing with relief . &quot; It ' s been bad enough with the baseball strike. &quot; Normally on a day like today Rose would be at_work at Dodger Stadium , walking through the stands_in his blue-and-white striped shirt and black pants , pitching peanuts into the hands of fans . Instead , he spends his time watching television , feeling depressed about the strike . &quot; I rely_on selling peanuts . I ' m one of the top guys , &quot; said Rose , 52 , who has been working Dodger games for 35 years . The strike also has been a financial hardship for both his sons , who sell pizza and cotton_candy at Dodger Stadium . His oldest attends UCLA , where tuition is $ 1 # 300 per quarter . For 27 years Rose has taught at Selma Elementary , a job that he loves as much as the one at Dodger Stadium . He rarely has to miss a game because most are played in the evenings and on weekends . &quot; Plus , they travel a lot , so it ' s not like they ' re here all_the time , &quot; he said . Rose had feared that his shaky finances would force him to cross the picket_line if teachers went_on strike . &quot; I ' ve been out on every teachers strike , but with all_the money I ' ve lost from the Dodgers , I have a big decision , &quot; Rose said before the board made the new offer . Now , he hopes that the baseball strike will end soon . &quot; I don ' t understand why the owners and players can ' t get_together , &quot; Rose said . &quot; They ' re making millions. &quot; He figures that if the strike continues to the end of the season , he will lose $ 3 # 000 . Rose moved to Los Angeles with his parents from Philadelphia when he was a teen-ager . He sold his first bag of peanuts at the Coliseum during a Dodger game in 1959 . &quot; The first game I worked , they were honoring Roy Campanella , &quot; Rose said . &quot; He had just had the auto accident that disabled him the year before . They lit matches , thousands of them , in his honor . I ' ll never forget that. &quot; He said he usually makes $ 140 a game , keeping a percentage of the profits . Because he is one of the top sellers , he said , he gets_to pick what he wants to sell . Peanuts are the most popular items sold by vendors , Rose said , although on a really hot day he prefers to sell snow cones . But the most gratifying aspect of being a vendor , he said , is running_into former students . &quot; Many times , I get stopped during a game : ' Mr. Rose , do you remember me ? ' Then they ' ll introduce me to their children , &quot; Rose said . &quot; All the kids knew I worked for the Dodgers , and when they see me , they say : ' You ' re still here ? ' &quot; When Doris Dent came_to Selma Avenue as the new principal last fall , she also recognized Rose . Dent searched through Rose ' s file and found a short article printed in a local magazine about a day in the life of a peanut vendor . &quot; Then I realized why he looked so familiar , &quot; she said . &quot; I go_to Dodger games frequently. &quot; Rose is the kind of teacher that children come_back to visit years later , Dent said . &quot; He remembers the kids and follows_up_on them , &quot; she said . Teachers or staff who want to vent their complaints or frustrations seek_out Rose , said teaching assistant Sandy Gagnier . &quot; He ' s looked_up_to when people have problems , or they need an ear , &quot; said Gagnier , who has worked_at Selma Avenue Elementary for 18 years . Venice High_School teacher George Woods said he had spoken_to Rose during the contract negotiations . &quot; I knew Mort was frustrated , and I understood his concerns , &quot; Woods said . &quot; Teachers want to have some peace in their life , &quot; said Woods , who is in_charge of keeping Westside teachers abreast_of developments in the negotiations . &quot; They want a three-year contract , to be able to buy a car or house or pay_for their kids ' college education. &quot; He said he is convinced that most teachers agree with Rose and are satisfied with the compromise . &quot; They ' re not happy , &quot; said Woods , after attending a Monday morning meeting of teachers and union_representatives , &quot; but they ' re at least willing to accept this. &quot; At a recent teachers union strategy session , teachers bemoaned the fact that more media coverage was being given to the baseball strike than to their negotiations . Leaders of the teachers union accepted the district ' s one-year contract offer Saturday . Teachers will vote on the offer Sept . 12 , the day most schools reopen . Rose , whose teaching salary is $ 38 # 000 ( he earned $ 41 # 000 before the pay_cut ) , said it used to anger him that baseball_players &quot; make more during one game than I do_in a year. &quot; It does not bother him anymore . &quot; I realized that the value of teachers is not understood by the public , &quot; he said . &quot; They don ' t realize the importance of the education profession . that ' s just the way it is. &quot; He laughs when asked what made him pick teaching as a career . &quot; It was so many years ago , &quot; Rose said . &quot; But I always enjoyed working with_children . I spent one summer as a camp counselor , and after that I decided to try teaching. &quot; The weight of their new financial strain forced Rose and his wife , Kathy , who works_at a Culver City preschool , to scrap plans to vacation at Lake Tahoe and San Francisco this summer . With no money coming_in since the beginning of the baseball strike , Rose said he is considering filing financial_aid applications for his son at UCLA . Meanwhile , Rose is looking_forward to the new school_year , and that first paycheck . But he really misses baseball -- and not only because of the money . &quot; Dodger Stadium is such a nice place to work , and they do a good job of keeping it a nice , family environment , &quot; Rose said . &quot; And I ' m a fan too. &quot;</TEXT>
