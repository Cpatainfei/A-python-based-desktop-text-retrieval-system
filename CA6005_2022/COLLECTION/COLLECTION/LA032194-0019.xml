   <HEADLINE> NEED FOR VIRTUOUS CAPITALISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The excerpt of Michael Novak ' s remarks on winning the Templeton Prize identifies the dangers for a democratic capitalist society adrift of its moral and ethical moorings ( &quot; The Urgent Need for Virtuous Capitalism , &quot; Commentary , March 13 ) . However , he neglects to offer a viable intellectual basis for the &quot; virtuous cultural awakening &quot; required for free societies to survive . The strength of Weber ' s &quot; Protestant Ethic &quot; is founded on individual responsibility and accountability . The theory of the firm does not dispel this maxim . It is when human associations and institutions depart from individual responsibility and accountability that society ' s moral bearings begin to fray . Such is the root of the tyranny of bureaucracy , the torpor of socialism , the hubris of unchecked political power and the corrupted ethics of free_enterprise . The costs and benefits of human_action must be internalized and borne by the individual actor whenever and wherever possible in_order to promote prudent social behavior . This is an economic , legal and moral basis for justice in a society that seeks to ensure individual liberty and individual preference . MICHAEL HARRINGTON Santa Monica Michael Novak has his work cut_out for him if he is going_to reconcile Catholic theology with capitalism . The problem is not that it is impossible to imagine moral ways of acting within capitalism if one should choose to do so ; people can always choose ( and some have chosen ) to act morally . The problem is that the system of capitalism itself does not require moral action outside the context of its own operation . Honoring contracts , for example is &quot; morally necessary &quot; for capitalism to work , but having economic hardship for someone else result from one ' s actions has no moral_force in capitalism . The potential problem with Adam Smith ' s &quot; invisible hand &quot; has always been that it might crush us . In reference_to Novak ' s description of &quot; the distinctive capitalist social invention , the business_firm held together by voluntary consent and teamwork , &quot; this is more of a political economist ' s ideal than a reliable generalization about the real_world . It is possible to see one ' s work as being part of a team , but the concept of mutual loyalty and interdependence between worker and company in fact only fully exists in those economic situations which are controlled markets rather than free markets . It is precisely in paternalistic , mercantilist economies , the sterling example of which is Japan , that such relationships can be pursued . I don ' t see how this squares with Novak ' s otherwise laissez-faire description of how capitalism properly works . PAUL TURPIN Los Angeles</TEXT>
