   <HEADLINE> WORLD PERSPECTIVE ; BRITAIN ; ANGLO-IRISH PEACE LINKS , POLITICS BECOME TANGLED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the_British government suffering a political thrashing anew and the_Irish government only now sorting_out its own internal tumult , many analysts here are saying the already difficult search for peace in Northern_Ireland may get_even more complicated . British Prime_Minister John Major ' s government suffered its latest disastrous defeat Thursday when it lost a &quot; safe &quot; Conservative seat in Parliament to the surging Labor_Party -- which , under new leader Tony Blair , is running far ahead of the Tories in polls . In balloting in wealthy Dudley West , in the Midlands in central England , Labor won by a whopping 20 # 694 votes -- the worst by-election drubbing for the Conservatives since World_War_II . The Tory defeat was particularly painful because only 7 # 706 people voted for the ruling party . In the April , 1992 , election , the Conservatives won 34 # 729 votes . Labor ' s vote held steady at 28 # 400 . If translated into national terms , the voting this week would leave the Conservative_Party without a single parliamentary seat . Meanwhile , in Dublin , a new government has finally been cobbled_together in a coalition led by newly installed Prime_Minister John Bruton , leader of the Fine Gael party , replacing the Fianna Fail administration of Albert Reynolds . * Reynolds had led the Anglo-Irish move for talks with the maverick Sinn Fein , the political arm of the_Irish Republican Army , and extremist Protestant paramilitary groups in Northern_Ireland . While Bruton ' s Fine Gael has less close ties with Sinn Fein and has often viewed the group as an anti-democratic force , he has promised to continue the peace process ; on Friday , Bruton met Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams and leading Northern Irish militant Republicans . But even as the quest to end 25 years of violence continued , there were signs of just how tangled the peace process may become : * On the one hand , in what was viewed_as an encouraging development , Bruton reappointed Dick Spring , head of the Labor_Party , as Ireland ' s foreign secretary . Spring held that post under Reynolds and used it to promote peace talks on Northern_Ireland . * Without firm direction from London , though , the 900 # 000 Protestant Unionist majority in Northern_Ireland has indicated it may be loath to reach any agreements with the 600 # 000 Catholic minority . * In London , the Conservatives were holding their heads , trying to figure their course now . They have lost a series of by-elections caused by deaths of Tory incumbents , and the party has been racked by internal squabbling . Analysts say Major ' s grip on power has grown so tenuous that he cannot count_on members of his party to stick_with him in any vote -- except perhaps in a vote_of_confidence , which could bring_down the entire government and force premature national elections . The defection of right-wing , anti-Europe Thatcherites is doubly harmful to the Tories because Major could be forced to rely_on votes of Northern_Ireland Unionist members_of_Parliament on critical issues ; this would leave him in their political debt , and they might seek to be repaid in matters concerning the province . Major gave no indication he is prepared to bow to right-wing pressure to change policies . &quot; I think some good can come_out of it , &quot; he declared of Thursday ' s vote , &quot; providing that people realize within the Conservative_Party that we are all pulling_in the same direction for the same cause at_the_same_time and against the same opponent. &quot;</TEXT>
