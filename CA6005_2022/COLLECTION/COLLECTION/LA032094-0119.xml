   <HEADLINE> IMMIGRATION DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I agree with Elton Gallegly ' s &quot; Column Right &quot; ( Commentary , March 13 ) insofar as the need to document the number of illegal aliens , or undocumented workers , if one prefers . We simply cannot put our head in the sand and pretend that we don ' t have a problem with the major drain on our welfare , education and medical systems caused by immigrants who have arrived in this country illegally . Whether they are legal or illegal is , to a large extent , immaterial . It is against our moral standards to turn_away those in need of medical_care , regardless of their immigration status . The child becomes an American citizen at birth and is legally entitled to certain services . How can we afford to pay_for this tremendous burden without federal assistance ? There is no doubt that illegal immigration is a federal problem . In many cases , assistance is federally mandated without provisions for federal funding . In any case , we will end_up having to deny benefits to someone , if sufficient funds are not available . We should start now by surveying the population to determine the number of illegal residents in California . One thing is certain : We will never be able to do this without a bipartisan effort . In order to accomplish this , we must stop pointing the finger of blame at one another . The important thing is to solve the problem . BYRON SLATER , San Diego * The recent tragic accident in which a truck full of illegal immigrants ran_off the road and killed many of the occupants can be blamed both on those who crossed our border illegally and on the federal_government . The government entices people to come here illegally by its unwillingness to pass and fund the necessary legislation to enforce our immigration laws . That information spreads around the world with predictable results . To prevent this type of accident from continuing to happen , we should either throw open our border and invite the rest of the world to come_on in or else put a stop to illegal immigration by whatever means are necessary . A.L. TANNER , Irvine * Politicians who drink the wine of corporate interests and sing their song discover that screaming &quot; illegals &quot; is more convenient than discussing the homeless , jobless and their voting record . Old folks who have forgotten that long ago they were the ones to be branded &quot; foreigners &quot; now demand the expulsion of those of ancient North_American seed whose ancestors ruled this territory . A few voices protest that these hard_workers will not bankrupt us . Their labor produces value , they pay sales , gas and other hidden taxes , their low wages produce lower costs and lower prices for food , clothing , etc . and if they leave , no one will make a mad dash for the open jobs . Why the influx ? Why risk hardship , robbery and even death in_order to slip into a country where undocumented aliens often sleep 10 to a room ? They are driven by hopeless poverty and murderous repression , from Guatemala , Haiti , Mexico , El_Salvador and on and on . Countries with small wealthy elites whose military shows no mercy to the peasants . Further research reveals U.S. corporate investment in these nations and a flow of funds and arms to them by this country in_order to maintain the status_quo . The Ft . Benning , Ga. , Army school trains ( these nations ' ) officers . Here they learn &quot; death squad tactics &quot; and the art of subduing the field hands . MAX ROBINSON , Los Angeles * This letter is in response to the commentary by Wayne A . Cornelius titled &quot; Border Control : Smoke , Mirrors &quot; ( March 14 ) . It is almost inconceivable that today , in one of the world ' s most civilized countries , there are still a_few who believe that there are certain types and levels of crime that are acceptable . Illegal immigration is illegal . It is a crime . A case could be made to mitigate the punishment for those who are violating our immigration laws , if they were fleeing from persecution or civil upheaval , but certainly not just to obtain a better way_of_life . This is the usual case for those coming from Mexico . To ignore any crime at the border is to invite disrespect for our laws and ultimately to encourage anarchy . Where there are violations of law , the customary solution is to increase police personnel with the most advanced equipment . It makes_sense to properly equip the Border_Patrol so that they do their assigned duties more efficiently . JESSE LAGUNA , Spring Valley * The stadium lights along the Tijuana border lighting_up the sky every night , costing U.S. taxpayers thousands of dollars , is a waste_of_time . It boggles the mind to think that we can stop a madman ' s army from invading Kuwait but can ' t stop unarmed peasants from invading our country . T . DAWKINS , Huntington Park</TEXT>
