   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : VAN NUYS ; HE ' S BEEN CALLED GOOFY , BUT CAR HONORS MICKEY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One look_at his 1989 Buick Le Sabre and people ask Fabio Rodriguez if he is crazy . But no one asks him if he has lost his marbles . From bumper to bumper , more_than 30 # 000 multicolored glass marbles adorn Rodriguez ' s four-wheeled &quot; Fantasia , &quot; the latest of his offbeat projects . &quot; They have called me crazy so many times , &quot; the 48-year-old Rodriguez said Wednesday . &quot; But they admire the artistic marbles and the patience , for you have to do_it one by one . This is like a mural on wheels. &quot; For the last seven months , Rodriguez has spent most of his time at his condominium / art studio in Van Nuys -- away from his Mesa , Ariz. , home -- where he painstakingly glued the imported Mexican marbles on his Le Sabre . If this seems madness , there is a method -- an ongoing dream to create one-of-a-kind cars . Rodriguez ' s previous creation , a 1969 Honda covered with 27 # 000 dimes , was sold in 1991 for an undisclosed sum to Ripley ' s Believe It Or Not , which put the vehicle on display at its London museum . The story behind Rodriquez ' s current project is almost as bizarre as the car . The inspiration for &quot; Fantasia &quot; came not from some childhood affection for marbles , which Rodriguez played growing_up Colombia , but from a rodent . A Mickey_Mouse fanatic , Rodriguez has amassed more_than 1 # 500 Mickey_Mouse collectibles -- from watches to train sets . Rodriguez wanted to create a car that honored his hero , but knew that gluing a_thousand Mickey_Mouse figurines , pens , phones and other collectibles would look tacky , at best , and get stolen , at least . &quot; You can ' t put $ 10 # 000 worth of collectibles on top of a car , &quot; Rodriguez said . &quot; It would n ' t be a carjacking . It would be a Mickeyjack. &quot; Instead , he took an idea from one of Mickey ' s films . &quot; If you remember the movie ' Fantasia , ' it ' s the most colorful movie he made , &quot; said Rodriguez . For the next two years , Rodriguez searched for the marbles he needed to create a cruising cascade of colors , finally finding them in Mexico . Using a special mixture of three glues , Rodriguez spent at least 5 1 / 2 hours a day covering doors , hubcaps , fenders , etc . with the marbles , which more closely resemble oblong stones than the playground variety . The car also features green rhinestones and colored wooden sticks_on the front grille . To honor Mickey directly , each door carries a silhouette of Mickey ' s head , re-created in dimes and quarters . Known for his abilities as a &quot; coin artist &quot; -- he once covered a suit_of_armor with 6 # 258 dimes -- Rodriguez also glued more_than 4 # 500 dimes around the windows and on the hood to create an eagle . Now , Rodriguez is hoping to sell his creation . He works part time as a Spanish-language commercial and television_announcer , as well as on cartoons , but he says it is not enough to support a wife and three kids . Until the sale , Rodriguez just wants to keep_from losing his marbles . So far , he ' s been lucky : &quot; Fantasia &quot; has been driven through three car washes without rinsing_off a single dime or marble . And the car security_system shrieks a wicked alarm . But if the youths who admired &quot; Fantasia &quot; on Wednesday at Balboa Park Lake were any indication , Rodriguez should not leave the car alone for too long . &quot; It ' s nice , &quot; one 17-year-old teen-age girl from Reseda said innocently . &quot; I ' d like to steal it. &quot; JEFF SCHNAUFER</TEXT>
