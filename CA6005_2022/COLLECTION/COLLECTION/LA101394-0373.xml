   <HEADLINE> EPA ACCORD COULD BAN UP TO 85 PESTICIDES ; AGRICULTURE : AFFECTED INDUSTRIES WILL URGE A FEDERAL JUDGE TO REJECT THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT . SUBSTANCES ON THE LIST CAUSE CANCER IN LABORATORY ANIMALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ending a five-year legal dispute with California environmentalists and farm_workers , the Clinton_Administration signed an agreement Wednesday that could ban up_to 85 popular pesticides because of their potential to cause cancer . The proposed settlement -- if approved by a U.S. District Court in Sacramento -- means the federal Environmental Protection Agency must make long-awaited decisions on what pesticides can be used in raw and processed foods . In 1989 , the state of California , environmentalists and the AFL-CIO sued the EPA to uphold a controversial food-safety provision called the Delaney clause , which prohibits any trace of cancer-causing additives in processed foods , such_as juices and canned vegetables and fruits . For years , the EPA allowed what it calls &quot; negligible risk &quot; from small amounts of pesticides , but under the proposed settlement , the agency now agrees to enforce the &quot; zero risk &quot; in the Delaney clause . That essentially means the federal agency would prohibit use of 36 popular insecticides , herbicides and fungicides on most crops within two years and review an additional 49 within five years . &quot; I ' ve been doing pesticide litigation since 1969 , and this is the most important pesticide case that has ever been brought , simply because it involves such a large_number of chemicals . It addresses all these pesticides in one fell swoop , &quot; said Ralph Abascal , general counsel for California Rural Legal Assistance , one of the five parties that sued the EPA . &quot; This is the first time such a comprehensive , cross-cutting policy has been challenged and resolved. &quot; Pesticide industry and food processing representatives said Wednesday they will try to persuade the federal judge to reject the proposed settlement , which will be submitted to the court Dec . 2 . They also vowed to beef_up efforts to persuade Congress to revoke the law , contending that it is unreasonable and unrealistic to enforce zero tolerance of pesticide residue in food . &quot; There is no need to panic right now with_regard_to agriculture producers and the availability of these tools . This isn ' t going_to happen tomorrow , &quot; said John McCarthy , a vice_president of the American Crop Protection Assn. , which represents pesticide manufacturers . &quot; This settlement hasn ' t been accepted by the court , and chances are we will get a new law that will fix this before the sky falls. &quot; However , Abascal said &quot; it is a very steep hill &quot; for the pesticide industry to persuade the judge to throw_out a settlement reached among so many parties . Jennifer Curtis of the Natural_Resources Defense Council , another of the plaintiffs , called the proposed settlement &quot; great news for consumers , farmers and the environment. &quot; The 85 pesticides , many of them widely dispersed , cause cancer in laboratory animals -- although in some cases only after they are fed large volumes . Biologists also believe some of the pesticides mimic or block hormones and can trigger reproductive defects such_as low fertility in wildlife and perhaps humans . EPA Administrator Carol Browner said the agreement &quot; assures that America will continue to enjoy the cheapest , most abundant and safest food supply in the world. &quot; Browner added , however , that the settlement &quot; addresses only one complex part of the nation ' s system for safe pesticide management . The Administration believes the entire food safety program requires overhaul. &quot; EPA officials say the agreement , if approved , is likely to lead to bans on many uses of the pesticides , including alachlor , one of the nation ' s most widely used herbicides ; dicofol , an insecticide spread on citrus , grapes , apples and other fruits ; atrazine , an herbicide used on sugar_cane and corn , and lindane , used on tomatoes . In California , many of the chemicals are used by growers to kill pests and weeds . Under the proposed settlement , however , they would have time to search for new biological controls or chemical replacements . &quot; Because there are so many ' ifs ' involved , it is hard to know what the impact will be_on growers , &quot; said Dave Kranz , a California Farm Bureau spokesman . &quot; Even if the settlement is accepted , the chemicals would be removed from the market during a period that could last as long as two years , and that would give growers some time to adjust or find alternatives. &quot; The first 36 pesticides will probably be phased_out because the EPA already has determined that they cause cancer in animals and that they concentrate in processed foods . The 49 others have been linked to cancer but the agency must conduct further research to determine if they leave residue in foods . The Delaney food-safety clause , enacted in 1958 , is one of the strictest environmental laws on the books , and Congress for years has debated its future . &quot; Because of its impact and its scope , this settlement could be the catalyst that breaks the logjam in Congress , &quot; Abascal said , &quot; and forces us and the industry and the government into a major change for the future. &quot; Industry officials and many toxicologists contend that the small amounts of pesticides most people consume are not hazardous , so the chemicals should not be banned . But environmentalists argue that scientists do not understand the cumulative effects , or what amounts might trigger cancer . &quot; The only thing certain about all_of this is that something needs to be done with the Delaney clause , &quot; Kranz said . &quot; With our ability to detect pesticides down to parts per trillion , a zero standard becomes almost impossible to enforce. &quot;</TEXT>
