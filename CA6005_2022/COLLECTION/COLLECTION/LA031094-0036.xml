   <HEADLINE> TOMATO OF THE FUTURE DELAYED . . . AGAIN ; BIOTECHNOLOGY : THE COMPANY SET TO MARKET THE NATION ' S FIRST GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TOMATO IS FINDING THAT IT ' S NOT EASY TO GET ITS CONTROVERSIAL PRODUCT INTO GROCERY_STORES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The debut of Flavr Savr , the genetically engineered tomato , suffered yet another setback recently when a public hearing on its safety was canceled without rescheduling by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . Developed by Calgene Inc. , the Flavr Savr was originally supposed to reach supermarket produce counters more_than a year ago , but its introduction has been repeatedly delayed as the FDA reviews the genetic alterations in the tomato that allow_for vine ripening and extended shelf_life . The FDA , which had planned to hold the two-day session this week , canceled the hearing because the agency was unable to assemble all_the relevant scientific experts . An FDA spokesman said that the cancellation was a matter of scheduling and not a reflection on the status of the Flavr Savr . Others are not so sure . They believe the climate for food biotechnology has changed in the aftermath of the controversy surrounding FDA ' s approval of recombinant Bovine Growth_Hormone , or BGH , a genetically engineered drug administered to cows that increases milk production . Calgene officials , for one , were surprised by the cancellation , especially since they were given only about a week ' s notice that such a session would take_place . * &quot; We don ' t think that a meeting is necessary but we don ' t believe that FDA will take final action till after such a meeting is held , &quot; said Carolyn Hayworth , public relations manager for Calgene in Davis , Calif . &quot; The consumer reaction to BGH may have had some hindrance on the FDA and its final approval of the Flavr Savr. &quot; She said the FDA appears to want to make a public demonstration that it has thoroughly reviewed the Flavr Savr . Charles M . Benbrook Ph.D , a Washington-based agriculture consultant , agreed that the FDA is being especially cautious about Flavr Savr because of its experience with BGH , now being marketed by the Monsanto Co . Just Monday a Washington advocacy group , the Pure Food Campaign , placed a full-page advertisement in the New York Times that was extremely critical of the FDA ' s approval of BGH and its subsequent presence in the dairy supply . Among other things , Pure Food denounced the FDA decision against labeling milk products derived from cows treated with BGH . Benbrook , former executive_director for the National Research Council ' s Board on Agriculture , said that in the aftermath of BGH , Calgene will likely be required by FDA to label its Flavr Savr tomato as a product of biotechnology . * &quot; The strength of negative consumer reaction to BGH makes labeling fait_accompli for Calgene , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m sure it is aggravating and very disappointing for them. &quot; Even before the hearing cancellation , FDA delays prompted Calgene to lay off an undisclosed number of employees at Calgene Fresh , a subsidiary formed to distribute the Flavr Savr . Initially , Calgene Fresh was test-marketing conventionally grown and vine-ripened tomatoes that approximated the care that will be needed to pack and distribute the Flavr Savr . Yet , Hayworth said that Calgene Fresh was losing too many of the vine-ripened tomatoes to spoilage during the 18-month pilot_project and that the firm decided to pull_back operations in_order to control costs . Calgene ' s conventional tomatoes , marketed under the MacGregor label , are sold to more_than 500 supermarkets . The company said that the Flavr Savr tomato , upon FDA approval , will not have as high a spoilage rate as conventional vine-ripened fruit . Hayworth estimates that the Flavr Savr could be in supermarkets within four weeks of getting the government green_light . All the delays , however , have allowed Calgene competitors using conventional breeding practices to improve on the quality of commercial tomatoes now on the market . * &quot; The whole industry has changed dramatically in the last year , &quot; said David Marguleas , senior_vice_president for Sun World International , which markets the DiVine Ripe Tomato . &quot; More specifically , many of the tomatoes we find in supermarkets today are improved varieties with better flavor , color , shelf_life and size. &quot; Marguleas asked : &quot; If you can produce a superior-tasting , fresh market tomato with conventional breeding -- and many growers are doing just that today -- then why mess with a genetically engineered product and all_the emotional , political and environmental concerns that go_along with it ? &quot; He also questioned Calgene ' s contention that it trimmed its test distribution because of spoilage . &quot; I ' d hate for the public to think that the reason they can ' t bring_up a product is because they are throwing too many away . That sounds like the reasoning of someone who doesn ' t understand agriculture , &quot; he said . Rather than spoilage , Marguleas says that the most common reason produce companies get_into trouble is because of overproduction and resulting low prices . At present , he said there is a glut of tomatoes coming from Mexico at less than half the regular price for this time_of_year . Calgene ' s Hayworth said the company expects its losses for the fiscal_year ending June 30 to exceed the $ 25.6 million loss from the previous year . The company ' s stock price has also declined in the wake of the FDA ' s cancellation of the Flavr Savr hearing .</TEXT>
