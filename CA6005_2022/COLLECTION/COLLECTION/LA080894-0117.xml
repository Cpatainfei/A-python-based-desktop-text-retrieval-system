   <HEADLINE> DEEP IN HISTORY ; RESEARCHERS PLUMB OCEAN , DOCUMENTS FOR CHANNEL SHIPWRECKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scuba diving off the coast of Santa Rosa Island one day , Don Morris came_across an archeological puzzle : the scattered remains of a ship . As the Channel Islands National_Park archeologist , Morris had spent years researching shipwrecks around the islands off the Ventura County coast . But he had no record of a ship sinking at that spot . Then a volunteer came_across a paragraph in an obscure 1931 Coast Guard document : &quot; received word by radio that the W . T . &amp; B No . 60 , a motor barge , was_on fire and abandoned . . . . Derelict was sighted and towed to East Point , Santa Rosa Island , where derelict was demolished. &quot; Logbooks from the Coast Guard cutter confirmed that the metal and wood Morris spotted was the remains of the Washington Tug &amp; Barge Co . ship destroyed 63 years ago . Morris added another shipwreck to his list . That list -- compiled from yellowed newspapers , ships logs , Coast Guard records and sightings of remains -- now includes 79 wrecks within a mile of the five-island park . Another 25 ships sank within the park ' s sanctuary , which extends for six miles around the islands . Morris , working with volunteers , has documented each of those wrecks in a 250-page report set for publication this December . Researchers , students , scuba_divers and park rangers trying to protect wreck sites could use the report one day . But Morris has not finished his research . &quot; I ' ve still got 50 wrecks to find , &quot; said Morris , running his hand through his long graying hair . &quot; I compare the archeologist to a trial_attorney . If you just went_with victims ' testimony , that gives you part of the story . But to get a fuller picture , you really need to go_out and find the physical evidence. &quot; This is no treasure_hunt . Any gold that sank with the ships has long since disappeared . Rather , it is more like a scavenger hunt , searching for odd pieces of history that reveal how ships were built , why they wrecked , even the way people lived . There is the anchor from the three-masted schooner Comet buried in the sand on San Miguel Island . And the pale-blue piece of plank , a clue to what the schooner Golden Horn looked_like before it wrecked on Santa Rosa . And the brass fixtures of the Winfield Scott , the elegant side-wheel paddle boat that sank near Anacapa Island . &quot; In terms of loss to history , the worst thing is when these vessels are scrapped , &quot; Morris said . &quot; They really do vanish . Wrecks in the water are really quite durable . An awful lot is preserved under water. &quot; * Morris still remembers the memo he found in his files when he took the Channel Islands job in 1985 . Written in the 1960s , it asserted that there were no shipwrecks in the area . By 1985 , the U.S. Park Service had found only two . Today , a map on Morris ' wall is covered with steel thumbtacks , each one indicating a wreck site he has surveyed . He scans the map , then adds another tack for a wreck he has just found on the south end of Santa Rosa . The islands , sprinkled across the Santa Barbara Channel and often shrouded in fog , create a natural navigational hazard . The oldest wreck found in the park ' s waters is the Winfield Scott , a steamer laden with gold that sank_in 1853 . The most recent occurred this spring , when a boat pulled_away from its moorings and rammed into the San Miguel coastline . Most of the shipwreck searches begin in the library , scanning old newspapers and merchant vessel books for accounts of accidents . This spring , researchers turned_to the National Archives for further detail . Bob Schwemmer , a volunteer from Santa Clarita , traveled_to San Francisco and Washington , D.C. , to tap archives there . He returned with century-old handwritten wreck reports . One of his document searches solved a Channel Islands mystery , the legend of the Legend . Rumor had it that the sleek racing_yacht , famous for winning the Transpac race from California to Hawaii , had sunk off the islands . There were even pictures of the wreck . But no one had seen the remains or found any records of the accident . Schwemmer checked one registry for a pleasure_craft called the Legend . When he found it , he checked another book for the owner ' s name . He called directory information , got the owner ' s telephone_number , and asked him about the Legend . The owner was able to confirm that the yacht had , indeed , gone_down off San Miguel Island . &quot; The mystery of the research -- it ' s exciting , &quot; Schwemmer said . &quot; It ' s that challenge to uncover somebody ' s history. &quot; * That history will be set_down in the 250-page report Morris and his volunteers have compiled . The report will appear in a series of National_Park_Service books with the uninspiring title , &quot; Submerged Cultural Resources Assessment. &quot; Eventually , the Park Service hopes to create a more popular version of the book , which students , park visitors and scuba_divers can use . Morris admits his work this summer has been overshadowed by another archeological find : A rare fossilized skeleton of a pygmy mammoth on Santa Rosa Island . He was_on the island , looking_for shipwrecks , when two colleagues stumbled across the mammoth . This week , he will join an excavation team unearthing the fossil , believed to be the first full skeleton of the ancestral elephant ever found . Like the mammoth bones , the shipwrecks reveal far more_than the battered remnants left_behind , he said . &quot; Take the Gold_Rush era . Most people came_to California by sea , not land , &quot; Morris said . &quot; By far the most accessible of these vessels , the easiest one to see , is the Winfield Scott . that ' s the only place to see the best example of what ' s left of the Gold_Rush era steamer. &quot; But the research could also draw new scavengers hunting for treasure in the ruined ships . For years , scuba_divers have pocketed gold coins , picked_up antique nails , even sawed off brass fixtures . &quot; I suppose we ' re like the people who run Mt . Vernon , &quot; Morris said . &quot; We want people to come . We want people to enjoy the history . But we don ' t want people to walk away with the good silverware -- or the bad silverware. &quot; In a 1987 sting operation , the Park Service put two rangers on a diving trip and ended_up charging the ship ' s captain and about 20 divers with violations . By locating more wreck sites , Morris said , the park rangers can protect them better .</TEXT>
