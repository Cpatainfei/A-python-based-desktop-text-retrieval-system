   <TEXT> If you followed World Cup soccer , you might want to lace_up those cleats and try one of the following games . * The oldest of the trio is Accolade ' s Pele ! I played the Sega version , and it ' s great if you like to control many of the variables . In addition to solid graphics and good control , Pele ! gives you six game options : exhibition , practice , start tournament , continue tournament , start season and continue season . As the last two indicate , you can stop your team ' s season in the middle , then power up and resume it later . One player can compete against the CPU , or you can invite a friend over . Pele ! lets you pick teams , uniforms , change the level of important attributes such_as offense , defense and aggression , and even substitute for players . * Another solid effort that gives you a lot of control is Champions World Class Soccer . CWCS has_the_best graphics and the most realistic game play . It ' s so realistic that when the goalie lets one get_by him , he jumps up and down in frustration . You can select from among a one- or two-player exhibition match , begin a tournament or resume a previous tourney , using a password . You pick from among 32 national teams , select from four formations and decide if you will control all , some or none of the goalie functions . If you pick none , the CPU will defend your goal . It does a nice job . On the screen you have a clock showing time elapsed , the score and a &quot; radar &quot; feature that shows the position of all players on the field . I found that pretty useless , because it looks_like a bunch of colored dots floating on a green background . Besides , if you take your eye off the field , your opponent steals the ball . * The easiest to play -- and my favorite for that reason -- is World Championship Soccer II . You can select an exhibition or a challenge round in which you play against 16 increasingly tough opponents . You can also play any game -- and any team -- from the 1986 , 1990 or 1994 world championship , or build your own championship tournament from 32 of the world ' s top teams . I don ' t even like soccer , but this game is so easy to control that I won my first six matches , including a crushing 5-1 defeat of Sweden and a hard-fought 2-1 overtime win against Bolivia . You get all_the options of a real game -- penalty kicks , overtime , corner_kick , throw_in , slide tackle . The graphics are large and clear and control is excellent . If you ' re a soccer fan , any of these carts will give you a good taste of what the real_thing is all about . If you ' re not a fan , you might be converted . And if that doesn ' t happen , take_heart . Football_season is just around the corner .</TEXT>
