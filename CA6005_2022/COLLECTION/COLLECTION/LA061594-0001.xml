   <HEADLINE> FRIENDS RECALL SIMPSONS AS A VIBRANT COUPLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whether at star-studded parties , trendy clubs or just shopping_at neighborhood boutiques in Brentwood , O . J . Simpson and his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , were a couple that grabbed attention . Fit , attractive , and accustomed to expensive cars and lavish lifestyles , they were strong-minded and witty people who seemed to command a room , even during a stormy marriage and fitful attempts to reconcile , friends said . The former football great and the athletic Nicole Simpson , who divorced him in 1992 , were seen together frequently during much of the last year as they made what appeared to be a sincere attempt to reunite , especially on O . J. ' s part , friends said . But Nicole Simpson -- who was murdered late Sunday night outside her home -- apparently told Simpson in recent weeks that they could not hope to resolve their differences , police sources said . &quot; They were definitely courting each other again , &quot; said one friend , who declined to be named , recalling times when the couple were seen at popular Brentwood restaurants and at the Brentwood Mart , a mall of shops and eateries on 26th Street . In addition , they had begun sharing more time together with their two children -- Sidney Brooke , 9 , and Justin , 6 -- the friend said . &quot; They were very visible . . . . He had the highest regard for her , and for her as a mother , &quot; the friend said . Simpson , 46 , and his former wife , 35 , were together at a number of high-profile bashes after their divorce , including a fund-raising benefit for Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center held_in May , 1993 , at the Century Plaza Hotel . Don Klosterman , former general_manager of the Los Angeles Rams football_team , remembered attending the fete and noticing that the couple appeared close . She held his arm , and they attracted the usual amount of attention , Klosterman said . &quot; Walking in , you ' d see them arm in arm , &quot; he said . &quot; She ' s a very , very attractive lady . . . . There always seemed to be a lot laughter ( around them ) . Like any couple , they were going_to have misgivings with each other at times , but I ' ve never seen it flare at all . They were just a great couple together. &quot; Klosterman , a longtime friend and golfing partner of Simpson ' s , described him as a charismatic personality who never showed a tendency toward anger . &quot; In all_the years that I ' ve known him , I ' ve never seen him lose his temper or his composure , &quot; Klosterman said . &quot; He was always up . . . kidding people . He has a great sense_of_humor . He is a lot of fun to be with , and always has been. &quot; Like others in Simpson ' s circle , Klosterman expressed disbelief at the growing evidence that police say could link the Hall_of_Fame athlete to Nicole Simpson ' s murder . That evidence includes a bloodstained glove recovered from his Brentwood home , as well as drops of blood found on Simpson ' s driveway . &quot; I just can ' t conceive that he would be involved in anything like this , &quot; Klosterman said . &quot; It ' s so inconsistent with his demeanor and his behavior that I ' ve known through the years. &quot; * Yet it was no secret that the relationship had been rocky at times . Three years before their divorce , Simpson pleaded no contest to a spousal battery charge after he allegedly kicked and hit his wife , yelling , &quot; I ' ll kill you , &quot; at his estate on Rockingham Avenue . That incident occurred shortly after 3 a.m. on New Year ' s Day , 1989 . In January , Nicole Simpson bought a $ 625 # 000 , Mediterranean-style condo just a_few miles from the couple ' s previous home on Rockingham . Since then , police said , officers have had to intervene in several domestic disputes between Simpson and his former wife . One officer described it as &quot; an ongoing problem. &quot; Late Sunday night , Nicole Simpson and a male friend , 25-year-old Ronald Lyle Goldman , were slain at the gate of the condo . According to police and friends , the nature of the relationship between Nicole Simpson and Goldman remains a mystery , but it appeared likely that there was no romantic involvement . Investigators theorized that Goldman -- a waiter at a nearby restaurant -- was killed after he returned a pair of glasses that Nicole Simpson had left at the restaurant earlier that night . Although Nicole Simpson and Goldman knew each other , one family friend of the Simpsons said , &quot; There was no romance ( between them ) . that ' s a fact . ( He ) was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. &quot; Nicole Simpson began dating Simpson shortly after graduating from Dana Hills High_School , where she was called a popular student and &quot; campus beauty &quot; by instructor Harlen Chambers , who said she was a member of the homecoming court in 1976 , her senior year . She was married to Simpson for seven years , often traveling with him , before filing for divorce . In ending the marriage , she cited irreconcilable differences . Nicole Simpson was funny , sometimes opinionated and an aficionado of the good life , friends said . She drove a white Ferrari , spent much of her time working_out at Brentwood athletic clubs or jogging on San Vicente Boulevard , and liked to dance at Renaissance , a popular club on Santa Monica ' s Third Street Promenade . Usually , she danced there on Thursday nights , often until 2 a.m. , said Ray Barron , 37 , a bartender at Renaissance who also lives_in Brentwood . &quot; She was very charming , very attractive , fun to be with , &quot; Barron said . &quot; There was always a group of guys hitting on her . ( She was ) a sexy dresser , a good-looking woman . . . . You could see how somebody could become very attached to her. &quot; Even on nights when 500 people jammed the club , Nicole Simpson seemed to stand_out , Barron said . Occasionally , she could be seen holding hands or kissing someone , he said , but more often she tended to stay with a female friend and she seemed more interested in dancing than in trying to meet men . &quot; She was a nice lady -- she wasn ' t sleazy by any means , &quot; Barron said . &quot; I always thought she was very classy. &quot; Barron , who met Nicole late last year , said he later got_to know her because they own the same type of dog -- an Akita , a Japanese breed known for its fierce protectiveness . Not long ago , her dog , Kato , escaped the yard and he returned it to her , Barron said . Nicole gratefully invited him into the house for coffee . There were pictures of her children in the condo , but no obvious sign of her marriage to Simpson . &quot; She never , ever mentioned O . J. , &quot; Barron said . &quot; She really didn ' t go too deep into her personal life. &quot; But other friends said she maintained strong feelings for Simpson . Pam Schwartz , a close friend of the Simpsons , said another friend saw them together Sunday afternoon at a dance recital for their daughter , Sidney . Schwartz said she talked to Nicole Simpson on Saturday afternoon during a rehearsal at Paul Revere Junior_High , where the ex-wife said , &quot; I ' ve always loved O.J. &quot; * During the years they were together , the Simpsons liked to throw frequent , celebrity-filled parties , first at a beachfront home they owned in Laguna Beach , then later at the estate on Rockingham , friends said . &quot; They ' d make_up games for everyone to play , &quot; including scavenger hunts , with awards and gag gifts for the winners , said Schwartz . &quot; Nicole would have a huge crowd and cook for everyone. &quot; Rocco Cedrone , 56 , a friend of Simpson ' s since his days as a Heisman Trophy winner at USC in the 1960s , remembers attending the elaborate 1985 wedding for the couple at Simpson ' s home . The event was held_in a tent that housed about 150 guests , plus a band , flowers and gourmet food . &quot; I ' ve been to some of the great weddings of our times , and this ranks right up there , &quot; said Cedrone , who owns a menswear store , Rocco , in Beverly Hills . &quot; He always had a large crowd up at the house . The atmosphere was always upbeat , whether people were playing pool , playing tennis , watching sports . &quot; His house was always open_to people . If you were in the neighborhood , you dropped_in . He always liked having people around. &quot; As Simpson and his ex-wife began trying to patch_up their relationship , word spread , both through Brentwood and in entertainment and sports circles . A saleswoman at one upscale clothiers on San Vicente Boulevard remembered Simpson coming_in near Christmas , talking happily about the couple getting_back together . &quot; He said he was going_to reconcile , &quot; said saleswoman Jodi Kahn of the shop , Theodore . &quot; He seemed like he was really happy. &quot; The tabloids also took_notice . In October , the National Enquirer reported that Nicole Simpson was once again wearing her old engagement_ring . Under a headline that proclaimed they were &quot; madly in_love again -- and talking marriage , &quot; the Enquirer wrote that Simpson visited his ex-wife one evening for dinner , and that she greeted him at the door in a sexy new outfit . The couple jetted off to Aspen together soon afterward for a romantic get-away , the story said . &quot; He ' d marry me tomorrow if I wanted to , &quot; the Enquirer quoted Nicole as telling a friend . &quot; My heart says yes , but my head says slow_down . I just keep telling O . J. , ' We ' ve got nothing but time to get this thing right.
