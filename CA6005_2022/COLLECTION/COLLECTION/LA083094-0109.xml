   <HEADLINE> FINAL TALLIES SHOW MEXICO ' S LONG-RULING PRI MAINTAINING ITS HOLD_ON NEAR-ABSOLUTE POWER ; POLITICS : THE PARTY OF PRESIDENT-ELECT ZEDILLO WILL FACE STIFF OPPOSITION ONLY IN CONGRESS ' LOWER HOUSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Federal Electoral Institute switched_off its computers Monday , stopped answering dozens of telephone_lines and shut its new multimillion-dollar headquarters , as the last of its official returns confirmed that the Institutional Revolutionary Party will have a lock on Mexico ' s presidential and legislative power until the end of the 20th Century . The quasi-independent institute ' s final tallies showed that the long-ruling PRI will control 75 % of the Senate and 60 % of the lower Chamber of Deputies when Congress convenes Nov . 1 . The first order_of_business for the new 500-member Chamber will be to officially declare as Mexico ' s next president Ernesto Zedillo , the ruling party candidate , who , according to final returns that included spoiled and annulled ballots , won with 48.77 % of the record vote on Aug . 21 . The bottom_line for Mexico -- after this election , which was to be a watershed of democratic change -- is six more years of near-absolute rule by the party that has governed the nation for 65 years , analysts said . For pro-democracy forces , which had mobilized unprecedented scores of poll-watcher groups , quick counts and vigilance_committees for the election , there were only a_few encouraging figures for the future : The 200 Chamber seats the opposition will control represent a significant increase over the last Congress . The PRI also will not have the two-thirds Chamber majority it needs to amend Mexico ' s constitution with impunity -- an impossibility , in fact , under a package of pre-election reforms . Further , with more_than a third of the votes_in the lower house , the combined opposition of the conservative National Action Party ( PAN ) and the populist Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) -- although on opposite sides of the political fence -- will have a stronger voice ; analysts said it will prevent Congress from assuming its traditional role as a rubber_stamp for the ruling party president . But it also was clear that conservative forces , either resistant or fearful of radical change , won hands_down in Mexico ' s year of uncertainty . That , perhaps , was the only clear conclusion as Mexico ' s political pundits , politicians and analysts attempted Monday morning assessments of why , amid unprecedented talk_of change , so_much of Mexico ' s political scene appeared to remain the same after the elections , in which a record 77.73 % of 45.7 million registered voters cast ballots . &quot; Strangely enough , Mexicans have come_out to vote as never before , to vote as always before , &quot; observed Gabriel Zaid in an editorial in Mexico_City ' s respected daily La Reforma . &quot; Strangely enough , the tenacious struggle of so many Mexicans to bring_about change will serve ultimately to legitimize the fact that there will be no change . . . . How to explain the ferocious resistance to each millimetric advance of electoral reform ? It is not easy to understand. &quot; Zaid and other commentators speculated that the clue to that mystery resides in &quot; public insecurity , &quot; which began Jan . 1 with an armed uprising that left 145 dead in the southern state of Chiapas , deepened after the March assassination of the ruling party ' s original candidate , Luis Donaldo Colosio , and has continued with grass-roots uncertainty about the economic effects of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . But beyond the conservatism of fear , most analysts concluded that the final result did reflect a deep desire for change -- but without risk . Zedillo , after all , campaigned strenuously on promises of extensive reform from within -- he promised self-imposed alterations in a system that has rendered his party and the government inseparable after six decades in power . Such promises , though , have become PRI traditions , analysts stressed . Further , at least one ruling party official appeared to dampen hopes that Zedillo will follow_through on hints that he might include opposition members in his Cabinet ; many analysts said this might be the only effective vehicle for reform if the PRI swept the Congress . In the aftermath of just such a sweep , there was ample evidence Monday of deepening post-election skepticism among the Mexican media and the opposition . Much of the cynicism focused_on Zedillo ' s widely publicized pre-election vow to end the PRI practice of handpicked presidential succession , known here simply as &quot; the finger. &quot; A cartoon in La Reforma pictured a worried Zedillo , saw in_hand , sitting on the tip of a giant finger , gazing with uncertainty at a dotted line just above the knuckle labeled &quot; Cut here. &quot; The opposition weighed in with even more force . &quot; We cannot prolong the Mexico of impunity , of fraud , of dishonesty , &quot; declared a frustrated PRD President Porfirio Munoz Ledo , whose party has asserted that the PRI won only through massive fraud and who called_for a national campaign to document it . &quot; For moral , populist reasons , we must now find truth. &quot; Fernando Antonio Lozano Garcia , a PAN leader , argued : &quot; To truly separate the PRI from the government is both urgent and cannot be delayed . This must be the end of presidential rule. &quot; Speaking just hours after electoral officials announced final results , Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , the charismatic , conservative criminal lawyer who carried PAN to its strongest electoral showing in 54 years as the opposition , advised Zedillo and his party against adopting &quot; a victorious attitude. &quot; He too reminded that Mexico needs fundamental change . He repeated his central election theme that the economic_system , in which 40 million Mexicans live_in poverty while 40 families control more_than half the nation ' s wealth , &quot; simply cannot endure. &quot; But Fernandez stopped short of fulfilling what President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had said was among his ultimate goals in these elections : a concession of defeat by a presidential loser for the first time this century . For his part , Salinas pronounced the election a major advance for democracy and pluralism , which he had vowed to ensure through a range of reforms . In an interview published Monday , he focused_on changes the elections will bring , rather than the structures that appear to remain the same . &quot; The result is that Mexico is plural , that Mexicans want to be respected and recognized for their diversity , that they do not want to exclude anyone and that they want to participate in grass-roots politics , &quot; Salinas said in the La Reforma interview . He noted : &quot; I would say the Mexican people not only gave us a great election , they also gave us a great lesson : a lesson in civil politics , in patriotism , in magnificence . We have an extraordinary people. &quot; The Final Vote Count Here are final results of the Aug . 21 Mexican presidential and legislative elections . There was a record 77.73 % voter_turnout for the Aug . 21 election . Totals in each of three races listed and the total vote may differ . This is because some voters cast ballots in only select races and because some ballots were annulled by the Federal Electoral Institute .
