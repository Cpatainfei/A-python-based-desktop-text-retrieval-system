   <HEADLINE> DANA PARSONS : BOTHERED BY TOUCHY-FEELY CARDS ? WE ' RE THERE FOR YOU</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While browsing a greeting card shop the other day , I saw headings like &quot; Your Diet Is Going Well &quot; and &quot; You ' ve Quit Smoking. &quot; These cards were in the &quot; Congratulations &quot; section reserved once upon a time for such mundane acts_as having a baby or being promoted . Obviously , some sharp-eyed greeting-card executive who ' s seen a lot of Oprah shows realized those achievements only begin to tap the potential in the self-actualization movement . Before talk_shows expanded our consciousness , life ' s milestones were somewhat limited : a birthday , high_school graduation , getting_married , having a baby . Maybe it ' s more accurate to say that was the only stuff we knew about . Remember when people actually kept other personal endeavors to themselves ? No longer . &quot; Mind your own business &quot; has been replaced by &quot; May I share ? &quot; as the operative expression of the day . We ' ve convinced ourselves we can ' t be truly evolved unless we inform someone else of our achievements . It only follows that , once informed , our friends will want to acknowledge these great moments in our lives by sending a card . It ' s all part of nurturing each other . Hallmark must be loving it , because in this new era , the greeting-card possibilities are endless : &quot; You Secured a Point-Free Loan. &quot; &quot; Your Lawn Looks Marvelous. &quot; &quot; You ' re Saying Fewer Stupid Things Lately. &quot; &quot; You ' re Down to a Six-Pack a Day. &quot; &quot; That Casserole You Served Was Exquisite. &quot; &quot; You Finally Got That Wart Removed From Your Big Toe. &quot; &quot; Your Progress on the Tuba Is Exciting. &quot; &quot; You Found Your Keys. &quot; &quot; Your Tummy Tuck Has Made a Difference. &quot; According to Hallmark , the custom of exchanging greeting cards was spurred by three developments : the rise of literacy in the 1800s , low postal rates and modern ways to print color . Printed valentines became widely popular only after 1840 , followed by Christmas_cards a decade later and then Easter and everyday cards . Lois Hunt , editorial manager for Hallmark Crown cards at company headquarters in Kansas City , Mo. , said consumer research led to the proliferation of &quot; all-occasion &quot; card-sending . I asked her why people want to branch_out and send more personal cards . &quot; I think there ' s a lot going_on in the world that ' s changing right now , &quot; she said . &quot; People have more blended families , they ' re moving around more so they ' re not staying in as close touch with their families , and friends are becoming more important because of that. &quot; The troubled economy of recent years also has caused shared problems and , in_general , people are more aware of other people ' s personal struggles , Hunt said . One thing Hallmark writers and editors try to develop are &quot; universal specific &quot; cards that can be construed by anyone as a response to their particular situation . An example , Hunt said , is the card reading , &quot; I ' m There For You. &quot; It will be interesting to see how far the greeting-card industry can go . Keep_in mind that card-sending includes more_than congratulatory messages . What about sympathy_cards ? They once were limited to deaths , but the new openness also makes the condolence field ripe for expansion . For example : &quot; Word Has It You ' ve Been Ruined Financially. &quot; &quot; We Just Learned Your Son Was Expelled Again. &quot; &quot; The Article on Your Arrest Was Overplayed. &quot; &quot; No One Expected Him to Fleece You. &quot; &quot; Sorry to Hear About Your Parrot and the Lawn Mower. &quot; &quot; We Heard You Singing. &quot; And then , there are the cards that don ' t fit a specific category . They ' re neither congratulatory nor consoling . that ' s probably where Hallmark puts their most talented writers . &quot; I ' m Thinking of You , &quot; expresses a fine sentiment , but there ' s lots of room for messages with a more personal touch : &quot; Incessant Chatter Can Grow Tiresome. &quot; &quot; You Seem Shorter. &quot; &quot; In Some Countries , Peeping Tomism Is Nothing to Be Ashamed Of. &quot; &quot; You Burst Into Tears for Reasons I can ' t Fathom. &quot; &quot; Your Column Strikes Me as an Odd Waste of Time. &quot;</TEXT>
