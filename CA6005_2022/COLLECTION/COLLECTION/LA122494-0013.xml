   <TEXT> I have a question regarding Bruce McNall ' s assertion that he had planned all along to pay_back the &quot; borrowed &quot; $ 2.36 million . Oops , multiply that by 100 . Did he ever offer to return the coins he smuggled to the countries he took them from ? I didn ' t think so . MARK BERNSTEIN Los Angeles</TEXT>
