   <HEADLINE> TRADE FLAP CASTS SHADOW OVER HOSOKAWA ' S U.S. VISIT ; COMMERCE : JAPANESE AND AMERICAN OFFICIALS BOTH RESIST COMPROMISE . PRIME_MINISTER IS_DUE IN WASHINGTON ON FRIDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American and Japanese officials engaged in diplomatic brinkmanship Wednesday on the eve of Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s visit here , with both sides refusing to compromise in an increasingly bitter trade dispute . Japanese Ambassador Takakazu Kuriyama said his nation will not yield to an American demand that the two countries determine a specific method to measure increases in Japan ' s purchases of U.S. goods and services and firmly reminded the Clinton_Administration that &quot; any negotiation requires compromise on both sides. &quot; The U.S. response was blunt . &quot; What we will wait for until hell freezes over is an agreement that there will be measurements , &quot; Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman said . The argument between the two countries stems from an agreement reached by President Clinton and Hosokawa ' s predecessor , Kiichi Miyazawa , just hours before Clinton left Tokyo last July . That agreement , couched in vague language that has come_back to haunt officials in Washington and Tokyo , committed the two nations to devising a framework that would lead to a reduction in Japan ' s towering trade surplus . The United States has since insisted that unbendable measurements must be developed to determine whether that goal is being met in four areas -- sales to Japan of telecommunications_equipment , medical equipment , insurance and autos and auto parts . American officials have insisted that they will not accept an agreement that papers over their differences with Japan , raising the possibility that the angry trade relationship will finally rupture . But much of the heated rhetoric is common in such negotiations , and U.S. officials have privately sent signals suggesting that neither side wants the situation to deteriorate into a trade war . Negotiations have taken_place in Washington and Tokyo , with the aim of reaching an agreement before Hosokawa ' s visit Friday . But U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said that , as of today , the two nations &quot; are stuck_on dead center . We are looking_for tangible progress. &quot; American officials temporarily broke_off talks Tuesday night , and the two sides did not meet Wednesday , in anticipation of the negotiations resuming at a higher level today when Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata joins the discussions . Clinton has come under increasing pressure in Congress to impose trade sanctions if the talks do not move the two countries closer to more open trade relations and a reduction in Japan ' s $ 132-billion trade surplus , nearly half of which is with the United States . Sen . Max Baucus ( D-Mont. ) , chairman of the Senate Finance_Committee ' s subcommittee on trade , said that without demonstrable progress , there will be strong support for imposition of economic sanctions intended to force Japan to open its markets to more American products . His counterpart in the House , Rep . Sam Gibbons ( D-Fla. ) , said any agreements reached by Clinton and Hosokawa &quot; must provide_for tangible and measurable results . If they do not , the United States should reject them and pursue an alternative course of action that will truly restore some semblance of balance and equity to our bilateral trade relationship. &quot; Kuriyama , the Japanese ambassador , said Hata ' s presence at the negotiating table today will reflect Japan ' s readiness to make &quot; every effort possible to reach agreement by Friday. &quot; He said Japan does not oppose &quot; objective criteria &quot; or &quot; numerical criteria &quot; that would be used to guide the U.S.-Japanese trade relationship . But , he said , &quot; What we are opposed to is to set_up some sort of numerical or quantitative targets or goals to which Japan should commit itself. &quot;</TEXT>
