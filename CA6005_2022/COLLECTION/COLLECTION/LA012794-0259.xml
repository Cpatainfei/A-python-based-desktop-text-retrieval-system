   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN PROSECUTOR CHARGES ZHIRINOVSKY AS WARMONGER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia ' s top prosecutor brought criminal charges of warmongering Wednesday against ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who advocates Russian military expansion and has made menacing statements against Japan and Germany . The case opened by Russia ' s prosecutor general is the most serious legal challenge yet to Zhirinovsky , whose unlimited promises and jingoist Great Russia stance made his party the biggest vote-getter in December parliamentary elections . Zhirinovsky denied that he knew of the charges and attributed claims that he preached war to the &quot; sick imagination &quot; of his enemies . He told reporters at a joint news_conference with visiting German right-winger Gerhard Frey that the book on which the charges are partly based , a combination autobiography and political treatise , &quot; will soon be_on the curriculum of all Russian universities. &quot; Zhirinovsky , in such an ebullient mood that he repeatedly hugged and kissed Frey for the cameras , did not back_down from former statements about creating a new Hiroshima in Japan and a new Chernobyl in Germany . He said he wanted to warn the world that it will indeed face World_War III if &quot; the humiliation of Russia doesn ' t cease. &quot; The prosecutor ' s charges are based on an article in the Russian Criminal Code that forbids the propagation of war . Those convicted under Article 71 face three to eight years in prison . As a deputy in the Russian Parliament , Zhirinovsky is immune to arrest , but Prosecutor General Alexei Kazannik still has the right to open a case against him , according to the Itar-Tass news_agency , which reported the charges . Eventually , however , prosecutors will have to ask lawmakers to remove Zhirinovsky ' s immunity if they want to send him to jail . The charges pending against Zhirinovsky raise the question of whether authorities will allow him to leave the country on an impending trip planned to include the Yugoslav capital , Belgrade , and Warsaw . In the long term , they could also conceivably block his run_for the presidency in 1996 , if he is in prison at the time . Zhirinovsky allows that his book , &quot; The Last Dash South , &quot; envisions Russian troops marching across Asia to the Indian_Ocean . But he contends that in the scenario , the troubled countries of the south would have pleaded for the troops to intervene and bring order . In another scenario Zhirinovsky described Wednesday , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin would give_up on the new Cabinet he has now put_together and come_to Zhirinovsky by next autumn to ask him to form a new government . Zhirinovsky said he would be prepared to serve as prime_minister or head of the Foreign , Interior , Security or Defense ministry . Meanwhile , the post-election Cabinet appeared to be nearly complete . After extended vacillation over Boris G . Fyodorov , the reformist finance_minister who fought to keep a cap on inflation , Yeltsin appeared to give_up on him Wednesday . Fyodorov had insisted that if Yeltsin wanted him to stay , the president would have to dump the head of the Russian Central_Bank and the Communist agriculture minister . Instead , the Interfax news_agency reported , Yeltsin let Fyodorov go and appointed the deputy finance_minister to take his place . The deputy , Sergei Dubinin , appeared to be a compromise candidate . Fyodorov told Interfax that Dubinin best fits the post now because he &quot; won ' t allow the collapse of the ministry ' s apparatus and will continue the former course. &quot; Since Yegor T . Gaidar , the main designer of Russia ' s last two years of economic reform , quit Jan . 16 , concern has mounted among Russian reformers and Western governments that the Kremlin will revert to its old ways . &quot; Boris Nikolayevich , the country has had an economic coup , a turn_back , &quot; Fyodorov told Yeltsin in a letter carried by Itar-Tass . &quot; Our only hope is you ! &quot; He called the new Cabinet &quot; red managers , &quot; meaning that they want to run the economy by issuing commands , fixing prices and mandating supplies in the old Communist style . Fyodorov and Gaidar have warned that conservative Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin will send inflation rocketing by increasing subsidies to failing industries and farms . Chernomyrdin , in his defense , has maintained that the Russian government will not deviate from its basic reform program , but he has said that the time has come_to concentrate more on halting the sharp drop_in Russia ' s production . His views appeared to gain more weight with Yeltsin in the wake of the Dec . 12 elections , in which the strong support for Zhirinovsky came_across as a protest vote by a population feeling the pain of reform . But the Gaidar camp warns that if the government tries to cushion the impact of reform through heavy spending , Russia will end_up like Ukraine , so deep in crisis the economy appears barely functional .</TEXT>
