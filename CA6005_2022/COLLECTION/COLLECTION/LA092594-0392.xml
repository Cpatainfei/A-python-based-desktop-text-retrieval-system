   <HEADLINE> COUNTDOWN TO HAITI COMPROMISE ; BACKGROUND : LAST-MINUTE DEAL REFLECTED IMPROVISED NATURE OF CLINTON POLICY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a long , frustrating day of negotiations with Haiti ' s military rulers last Saturday night , former President Jimmy_Carter abruptly excused himself from a dinner with Haitian businessmen , closeted himself in his suite in Port-au-Prince ' s Villa Creole Hotel and typed for an hour on his laptop_computer . The page that he produced -- and handed to Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras a_few hours later -- became the first draft of what soon evolved into the American agreement with Haiti ' s military regime . Remarkably , Carter did not clear his proposal with President Clinton ; indeed , the White_House did not even see it until the next morning , almost 12 hours after Carter gave it to Cedras . By then , the Haitian general had already accepted the document as the basis for an agreement , and it was too late for Clinton or his advisers in Washington to make major changes . &quot; It ' s the best we can get , &quot; Carter told Clinton late Sunday afternoon , shouting over a balky satellite telephone to the White_House from a little_office at Cedras ' military_headquarters . As he spoke , 2 # 900 paratroopers of the U.S. Army ' s 82nd Airborne Division were already in the air , counting the minutes until the planned American invasion of Haiti . Offshore , Navy SEALS were standing_by motorized black rubber rafts , ready to head for the beaches around Port-au-Prince . And at a secret location in the city , a team from the Army ' s secret Delta Force was already on the ground , poised to grab Carter and his fellow negotiators , retired Gen . Colin L . Powell and Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , and &quot; extract &quot; them from Cedras ' headquarters by force if need be . Clinton ' s advisers were divided on what to do . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher complained that Carter ' s document was too loose , too favorable to Cedras . Vice_President Al Gore , National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and special adviser William H . Gray III said the wording was not as important as the reality that the pact would put Haiti under the control of 15 # 000 U.S. troops , without the use of force . Clinton hesitated , then told Carter : &quot; Go ahead. &quot; As soon as the agreement was signed , the arguments began again : Exactly what had been agreed to ? Were Haiti ' s generals going_into exile or not ? Who would police Port-au-Prince ' s squalid streets ? How long would the U.S. Army and Marine Corps stay ? Last weekend ' s frenzied negotiations , which climaxed the Clinton_Administration ' s long struggle over Haiti , also captured its essence . Committed to restoring democracy but uncertain how to do_it , Clinton has lurched from one improvised strategy to another , from negotiations to sanctions to the brink of war and now U.S. military occupation . Throughout , his policy on Haiti has been unusually susceptible to the influence of strong-minded outsiders , from the CIA to the Congressional Black Caucus and , most recently , Jimmy_Carter . Here , based on interviews with Carter , Nunn and more_than 30 other sources in Haiti and Washington , is the story of how Clinton decided to invade Haiti , how Carter engineered the agreement that averted war and how both sides began remaking the pact as soon as it was signed . I : Policy Reversal Even before his election as President in 1992 , Bill_Clinton was out on a limb over Haiti . When Haiti ' s fiery , populist president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , was overthrown in a military coup in 1991 , then-President George_Bush promised that the United States would work to &quot; restore democracy. &quot; Clinton asserted that Bush wasn ' t doing enough and denounced his policy of returning Haitian refugees to Port-au-Prince as &quot; cruel. &quot; &quot; My Administration will stand_up for democracy , &quot; Clinton promised . His first decision was forced on him even before Inauguration_Day . Emboldened by the new President ' s rhetoric , thousands of Haitians began building boats and preparing to sail to Florida . Bush warned the President-elect of impending disaster . Clinton reversed himself and ruefully announced that Bush ' s policy would stay . The new President was stung by reports that he had &quot; flip-flopped. &quot; At one of the first meetings of his national security team , he blew_up at a report that promised no real movement on Haiti . &quot; It ' s just not good_enough , &quot; he railed . &quot; I want more progress. &quot; Lawrence Pezzullo , who later quit as his special negotiator in Haiti , observed that Clinton &quot; had a sense that Haiti was a problem that he could solve and come_away with a diplomatic victory . I thought it was naive . . . . Haiti is always more complicated than it looks . He didn ' t understand that. &quot; Still , the Administration ' s first efforts had some success . Pezzullo told Cedras , the head of Haiti ' s military regime , that this President was serious about putting Aristide back in office . After American cajoling , the U.N. Security_Council imposed an oil and arms embargo . Cedras and Aristide agreed to work_on a negotiated settlement . At the wind-swept Coast Guard station at Governors Island in New York , they made a deal last year : Cedras would retire in four months with a grant of amnesty ; Aristide would return ; the Haitian armed forces would be retrained by a multinational force . It didn ' t work . The two sides quarreled over what the agreement meant . And , only 10 days before the United States was scheduled to land its first large group of military trainers , U.S. Army Rangers were ambushed by guerrillas in Mogadishu , the capital_of_Somalia , and 18 Americans were killed . Congress and the public went_into an uproar over the Administration ' s visions of deploying U.S. peacekeeping troops around the world . On Oct . 11 , 1993 , the tank landing ship Harlan County steamed into Port-au-Prince harbor carrying 218 military_engineers and police trainers armed only with M-16 rifles . A group of the junta ' s thugs waited_on the dock and created a fracas . Washington didn ' t want to lose any lightly armed trainers to a mob . On Oct . 12 , the Harlan County sailed away . The message to Cedras , American officials later acknowledged , was all too clear : Clinton didn ' t care enough about Haiti to take risks . Meanwhile , liberals in Congress were upset over the apparent drift in American policy and the practice of returning refugees to Haiti , despite grisly repression there . Randall Robinson -- head of TransAfrica , an African American lobbying group , and a longtime acquaintance of National Security Adviser Lake -- launched a hunger_strike , demanding that refugees be granted hearings . Lake called Robinson several times , and Clinton announced that he agreed with the protest of_his_own policies . That produced a huge jump in the number of Haitians taking_to the sea and sent the Administration scrambling to pressure Cedras from power . Clinton tried a complete U.N. trade_embargo , a ban on commercial airline flights , a freeze on assets of wealthy Haitians . But Cedras did not budge . Clinton sent more Navy ships into the Caribbean . But Cedras , remembering the Harlan County , was unimpressed . On July 31 , the Security_Council authorized the United States and its allies to use &quot; all necessary means &quot; to depose the military . Cedras did not believe the threat . When the United Nations sent an envoy to Haiti to try to set_up talks , the general refused even to meet . &quot; That told Clinton that these people would not be moved , &quot; said Gray , the President ' s new special envoy . Further , he said , the State_Department kept a stream of atrocity reports flowing to the White_House . On Aug . 26 , Clinton met secretly with his advisers and ordered preparations for an invasion of Haiti . Deputy Defense_Secretary John M . Deutch announced on Aug . 31 that U.S. forces were &quot; going_to Haiti &quot; one way or another . From then on , events went_on fast-forward . On Sept . 10 , Clinton ordered Perry to plan for an invasion &quot; as soon as possible. &quot; H-Hour was set for one minute after midnight Sept . 19 . II : Call to Carter Both sides said they were ready for battle , but neither wanted to fight . Clinton ' s seemingly abrupt veer toward war caused near-panic in Congress . Polls found massive majorities opposed to invading Haiti . Clinton had been emotionally engaged in Haiti for months but , preoccupied by his domestic priorities , had never gone_to the nation to build support for military intervention . Haiti ' s leaders had their own doubts . All through July and August , a flurry of messages came_to Washington through men who said they were acting for Cedras or his cohorts , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby and Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois . They sought meetings , negotiations , a deal . After months of dead_ends , the Administration was skeptical . A senior official later said , &quot; Some of those overtures were more real than we judged them to be. &quot; Clinton and his aides had long agreed that they wanted to send a last-ditch envoy to Haiti to give the generals one last chance to back_down . Now , with two U.S. aircraft_carriers and dozens of other ships carrying thousands of troops to Haiti ' s shores , the question was : Who ? Christopher , dubious about the mission , suggested William L . Swing , U.S. ambassador to Haiti . But Cedras ' wife , Yannick Prosper , had scornfully told an intermediary that her husband no longer wanted any messages from Swing . Lake and Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , were proposed and rejected . Then , five days before H-Hour , an alternative appeared . Jimmy_Carter had returned from a trip to find a letter from Charles David , Cedras ' foreign_minister , asking him to mediate . Carter , as an observer at Aristide ' s election , had met Cedras in 1990 . On Sept . 14 , Carter asked a mutual acquaintance in Haiti to tell Cedras to call him if he was serious . In minutes , Cedras telephoned Carter ' s home_in Plains , Ga . &quot; Dialogue is the only way to end the crisis , &quot; Cedras said , according to notes taken_on an extension by Carter ' s wife , Rosalynn . &quot; Clinton ' s solution is the worst of all possible ones. &quot; He warned that Aristide ' s return would touch_off a civil_war . Carter ' s response was tough , the notes show . &quot; I do not represent the U.S._government , but it is necessary for me to tell you the truth , &quot; he said . &quot; An irrevocable decision has been made to invade Haiti unless you . . . are prepared to leave. &quot; Cedras seemed taken_aback . &quot; As a Christian and a nationalistic Haitian , I will do everything possible to avoid any problem for my country , &quot; he said . &quot; My long career has not prepared me for this situation . . . . How will history judge me if I depart and leave my fellow citizens to face death ? &quot; They argued for more_than an hour without resolution . But Cedras said he wanted to talk again . &quot; I invited him to come_to my Sunday_School_class , either to hear me or to teach it , &quot; Carter ' s notes recounted . Carter made a transcript of the notes and faxed it to the White_House . Then he called Powell and Nunn . &quot; They both were totally against the invasion , &quot; Carter said in an interview . &quot; I asked both of them if they would be willing to go_to Haiti with me. &quot; Carter faxed a letter to Clinton proposing a Haiti mission ; he followed up with a call . &quot; He was equivocal about it , &quot; Carter said . &quot; He was catching hell in the White_House about the concept. &quot; Several of Clinton ' s top aides , including Christopher , were skeptical about Carter , who had irritated Christopher by trying to inject himself into sensitive Middle_East negotiations and by acting_as a free-lance negotiator with North_Korea . Two factors turned the tide in Carter ' s favor : He already had a measure of Cedras ' confidence and , if rejected for the job , he could go public and embarrass the Administration . Carter ' s decision to recruit Powell and Nunn helped too ; officials expected the general and the senator to keep_an_eye_on the former President . On Thursday evening , Sept . 15 , Lake phoned Carter and told him to expect a call after Clinton made his televised speech explaining the reasons to invade . The speech was bellicose . &quot; Cedras and his armed thugs have conducted a reign_of_terror -- executing children , raping women , killing priests , &quot; Clinton said . Carter , watching , was distressed : Would the Haitians still want to negotiate ? He sat_by the phone , but it didn ' t ring . &quot; Finally , we went_to_bed , &quot; Carter said . A little after 11:30 , Clinton phoned , Carter recalled . &quot; What he told me that night was : ' See if he will let you come down. ' &quot; Carter phoned Cedras , who called_back at 4:30 a.m. Friday to invite Carter , Nunn and Powell to come_to Haiti the next day . At the White_House , Clinton and his advisers discussed Carter ' s instructions -- the detailed goals and limits that normally guide negotiators . But &quot; this was an unusual situation , &quot; one official recalled . &quot; President Carter was going as an unofficial person , and we wanted him to have as much flexibility as possible. &quot; So Clinton merely called Carter , Powell and Nunn to spell_out three goals : to persuade the Haitian generals to step_down , to get their agreement to a peaceful entry for U.S. forces and to get_it done_by noon Sunday . There were no written instructions . III : Role-Playing On Saturday morning , Carter , Powell and Nunn boarded a blue-and-white Boeing 707 at Warner Robins Air_Force Base near Atlanta . Although the three had never worked as a group before , aides said they seemed to mesh immediately on the three-hour flight to Port-au-Prince , working_on the roles they would play . Carter was to maintain Cedras ' confidence , be sympathetic to the Haitians ' concerns and work_out proposals to bridge gaps between their demands and what Washington wanted . &quot; It was implicit from the start that Carter was to be first among equals , &quot; said a White_House aide who was_on the plane . The charge to Powell , as one of the world ' s most admired military_officers , was to appeal_to the Haitians ' sense_of_duty -- and , in a word that later became controversial , their honor . &quot; Never mind whether we think they are honorable men , &quot; a senior official noted later . &quot; The important thing in this context is that they think they are honorable men. &quot; Officials also hoped the Haitians might find it more palatable to hand_over their swords to a Caribbean American ( Powell ' s parents came from Jamaica ) than to a white officer . Nunn ' s function was straightforward : to explain to the Haitians that Congress was not going_to stop Clinton from invading their country , no matter how much noise members had made . &quot; The Haitians were under a lot of illusions on that count , &quot; one official said . The delegation ' s first task , they agreed , was simply to break_through the Haitians ' skepticism and convince them that the American forces they could see offshore were prepared to invade their country . After that , they hoped to persuade Cedras and Biamby to step_down -- but not to leave Haiti . Clinton and other American officials had said they wanted the generals out of Haiti . But in recent weeks , officials had concluded that U.S. troops would be better_off with Cedras and Biamby in command than with the chaos of a headless opposition army . As the Carter plane landed at 12:20 p.m. , anti-American demonstrators , bused in by the regime , marched at the airport . The first meeting was dreary : a long session with a room full of pro-military Haitian politicians delivering harangues about U.S. policy . At 2:15 , the three Americans were ushered into a conference_room at military_headquarters to meet the men they had come_to see : Cedras , Biamby and seven others in the high_command . But to the Americans ' distress , this meeting was more of the same . When the delegation emerged and called the White_House on their portable satellite telephone , their report was grim : We aren ' t getting far but will keep trying . In Washington , the invasion was moving inexorably toward H-Hour . Clinton was briefed in the Pentagon war room . His press secretary , Dee Dee Myers , solemnly read reporters a deliberately Churchillian quote , ostensibly from Clinton : &quot; I will not be delayed . I will not be deterred. &quot; In Port-au-Prince , during a long dinner with leading Haitian businessmen , Carter seemed impatient . &quot; What can you do to create conditions for reconciliation ? &quot; he asked them . &quot; Not much , &quot; one replied . By dessert , Carter had excused himself and gone_to his suite . There he drafted the document that , with few significant changes , would become the seven-point accord on Haiti ' s future . Its essential elements : an &quot; honorable retirement &quot; for top officers in Haiti ' s armed forces ; an agreement to cooperate with U.S. armed forces ; a pledge to hold free , fair legislative elections . Any requirement that the generals go_into exile was absent , as was any mention of Aristide . About 10 p.m. , the phone rang : Cedras wanted another meeting . This time only Cedras and Biamby were there . The discussion was more cordial , with more give-and-take . Cedras , talking_about his love of country , said he would be shot as a traitor if he tried to leave : &quot; I ' d rather be killed by an American bullet in my chest than a Haitian bullet in my back. &quot; The key contribution came from Powell , who soberly told Cedras and Biamby about the firepower of U.S. forces poised to storm ashore : 20 # 000 well-armed troops to Haiti ' s poorly armed 5 # 000 ; more_than 300 helicopters plus tanks , armored vehicles , close-support planes -- the fury of America ' s arsenal concentrated against a small , poor republic . Carter said the generals sagged visibly . &quot; Cedras was bewildered , &quot; Nunn said in an interview . &quot; He said , ' Once you get all those troops on the ground , Haiti won ' t be the weakest country in the hemisphere anymore. ' And he laughed. &quot; Powell and the others were quietly elated . They had broken_through the facade of defiance . It was_after 2 in the morning . Carter had given the generals his draft accord , but a full discussion of it would have to wait until morning . On the way_out , Carter told Cedras that he wanted to meet the general ' s family . Cedras grimaced . &quot; Yesterday was my 10-year-old son ' s birthday , &quot; Cedras said . &quot; I love my family , and I ' d like to see my son. &quot; Back at the Creole Villa Hotel , Carter phoned his wife and recounted the talk . &quot; Jimmy , I ' ll give you some advice , &quot; she said . &quot; Go see Gen . Cedras ' wife. &quot; IV : A Wife Speaks Cedras ' home is no mansion by American standards . It ' s a sprawling , whitewashed suburban house with a handsome swimming_pool behind high walls and tropical shrubs . Even in Petionville , the Beverly Hills of Port-au-Prince , it is overshadowed by more lavish neighbors . But when Carter , Powell and Nunn arrived Sunday morning at 8:30 , they noticed little about their surroundings . Their attention -- particularly Carter ' s -- was captured by imperious Yannick Prosper , Cedras ' wife . &quot; She was a good-looking woman , not beautiful , but very attractive . . . tough , competent , strong , determined , &quot; Carter recalled . U.S. intelligence reports described her as a Haitian Rasputin , a suspected drug abuser who had both her husband and Biamby under her thumb . Now she turned her charm -- and her intensity -- on the three Americans . &quot; People outside this country don ' t recognize the grandeur of Haiti , &quot; she said , as Carter recalled it . &quot; They underestimate our pride and our motivation . We are the oldest black republic on Earth ; Haitian slaves defeated the finest army that France could marshal . . . . ( We may be ) one of the poorest countries on Earth , but we have not lost our dignity. &quot; She spoke_of her father and grandfather , both generals in the Haitian army . Then she talked_of her children , ages 17 , 13 and 10 . &quot; Last night , when my husband didn ' t come_home and we knew that the Americans were going_to come_in with waves of strength that we could not meet , we took an oath to give our lives , &quot; she said . The children had agreed , knowing their home would be one of the Americans ' first targets . &quot; We will never yield to foreign invaders , &quot; she said . Powell broke the silence . He said he understood what Mrs . Cedras meant by honor and integrity , why she felt an invasion of her land should be fought to the death . But he said the real duty of a general is to defend his nation and his people from destruction -- and that means knowing when a battle is not worth fighting . &quot; It would not be a betrayal , &quot; he said , if her husband was to defend Haiti from harm by leaving_office . Carter spoke too , saying : &quot; The greatest duty of a leader like your husband is not to give his life , not to go_to_war , but to work for peace . The decision to wage war , even if it means giving your life , is a simple decision . The decision to wage peace is more difficult. &quot; More_than an hour had gone_by , Carter said . Mrs . Cedras was_quiet . Then she looked_at her husband . &quot; Mr. President , I ' ve got your written proposal , &quot; Cedras said , referring to the draft Carter had given him . &quot; Let me meet with you at the headquarters and give you our response. &quot; Carter , believing the generals finally ready to negotiate , handed a copy of his draft to Larry Rossin , a White_House aide with the delegation . Rossin immediately faxed it to the White_House . &quot; No , no , no , &quot; Clinton groaned , as he read the agreement with aides in the Oval Office , said an official present . Carter ' s draft said nothing about Aristide ' s return , not even indirectly . It didn ' t seem to bind the generals to step_down . It said the hard-won U.N. trade_embargo would end &quot; without delay. &quot; In Port-au-Prince , Carter , Powell and Nunn began meeting with Haiti ' s generals only 40 minutes before the noon deadline . Down the hall in the military_headquarters , Rossin got_on an open phone_line to the White_House . In Washington , Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott , a former Time magazine correspondent , began drafting a new agreement . Too late , Carter said ; the generals had agreed to use the first draft as a framework . A U.S. official in Haiti was struck by the realization that Carter was no longer acting_as a Clinton emissary but &quot; as a mediator , as a broker in the middle . He was negotiating with us on behalf of the Haitians as much as the other way around. &quot; Clinton focused_on one big problem : The Carter draft committed the generals to step_down once the Haitian Parliament passed a &quot; general amnesty. &quot; The President interrogated his aides : Could the generals use this to stall and stay in office ? &quot; It could be OK if a date certain could be added &quot; for the generals to step_down , said Christopher , a longtime Los Angeles lawyer . Clinton said the deadline had to be no later than Oct . 15 . Christopher , using a secretary ' s telephone outside the Oval Office , told Rossin to tell Carter that the President insisted on a deadline . In Port-au-Prince , the generals now were unhappy . Giving Cedras the deadline , Carter said , &quot; was an insult . He was willing for the Parliament of Haiti to determine when he left . . . by passing the amnesty . But he wasn ' t willing for me to do it. &quot; Biamby told Powell that he would commit suicide rather than surrender . Clinton gave Carter a three-hour extension of the deadline . The arguing went_back and forth for that long and longer . Meanwhile , at 1 p.m. , Shalikashvili , after checking with Clinton , had ordered the 82nd Airborne Division at Ft . Bragg , N.C. , to board planes for Haiti . The invasion was still scheduled for one minute after midnight , and &quot; I frankly had come_to the conclusion that we were not going_to reach an agreement , &quot; Clinton said later . About 5 p.m. in Port-au-Prince , Biamby burst into the conference_room , shouting : &quot; You men have tricked us ! You ' ve been here talking_about peace . . . and I ' ve just been informed from Ft . Bragg that paratroopers are_on their way to invade our country. &quot; ( Haitian officials later said Biamby had been tipped_off by a Haitian American serviceman at Ft . Bragg. ) Biamby charged that Carter ' s talks had been nothing but a ruse . He announced that he was taking Cedras to a command_post to begin directing Haiti ' s defense . Clinton would later assert that dispatching the 82nd was the decision that pushed the talks to success , but Carter disagrees . At that moment , Carter said , &quot; We knew we had failed. &quot; Nunn agreed : &quot; We thought we had lost_it all. &quot; Carter , desperate , launched a last emotional appeal , beginning with the Haitians ' own complaints that the embargo was causing malnutrition and disease among children . &quot; If I go_back home and we give_up this effort for peace , what ' s going_to happen to your children ? &quot; he asked . Then he turned_to Cedras . &quot; I had respected you for your integrity and unselfishness , &quot; he said . &quot; But here , in_order to stay in Haiti a_few more weeks , you ' re willing to sacrifice the well-being of_your_own people and the lives of many Haitians and , perhaps , Americans . And the children that you claim you love quite often will not live. &quot; Cedras suggested that they talk to Emile Jonassaint , 81 , the interim president whom he had installed after Aristide ' s ouster . At 5:30 , the Americans and the Haitian generals drove to the Presidential Palace . According to some Haitian officers , Cedras already knew that Jonassaint would bless the accord -- including the Oct . 15 deadline -- and take responsibility for signing it . But Carter thought he would turn it down . &quot; You have 30 more minutes , &quot; Clinton had warned , &quot; and then I will have to order you to leave. &quot; Jonassaint , imposing with white hair and huge , expressive hands , listened gravely and announced his decision : &quot; We will take peace instead of war . I will sign this agreement. &quot; Down the hall , one of the U.S. aides had found a usable phone and dialed the White_House direct . Clinton and his advisers were in a near-panic ; Carter and his party had been out of touch for half an hour , and the invasion force was_on its way . And now Clinton was having second_thoughts . Talbott asked if it was too late to add a clearer reference_to the U.N. resolution calling_for Aristide ' s return . Carter lost his temper briefly . Powell brought the process back under_control . &quot; Let ' s not get lost in the details , &quot; he told Clinton , an aide recalled . &quot; The important thing is that you will have 15 # 000 troops on the ground . You will control what happens on the ground. &quot; By about 7 , the deal was ready . Clinton asked each of his advisers once more if there was any reason not to accept it . &quot; There ' s no choice , &quot; said Gray . &quot; We can worry about the details tomorrow. &quot; At 7:45 , Clinton gave his approval . The 61 transport planes carrying the 82nd Airborne turned_around in midair . Carter , Powell and Nunn headed_home ; Powell ordered rum and Cokes all around . &quot; Our objective . . . has been to make_sure that the military dictators leave power and that the democratically elected government is returned , &quot; Clinton said on television two hours later . &quot; This agreement guarantees both those objectives. &quot; V : Bitter Reception In Washington , Aristide was not happy . The elected president of Haiti , joined by Lake and Gray , glumly watched Clinton ' s announcement . &quot; I don ' t like this agreement , &quot; Aristide said , according to Gray . &quot; I understand what the President had to do , but I don ' t quite agree. &quot; Aristide was unhappy that the accord did not explicitly promise that he would be restored to power ; he was upset that it seemed to let the generals remain in Haiti . &quot; These are all issues that are subject_to interpretation , &quot; Gray lobbied Aristide . &quot; And we ' ll have 15 # 000 troops on the ground -- so our interpretation will carry some weight. &quot; But when Aristide finally issued a statement 36 hours later , it did not mention the United States at all . Not until Wednesday , two days after U.S. troops began taking_control of Port-au-Prince , did he say &quot; Thank you &quot; -- at a Pentagon ceremony where he received a 21-gun salute . In Haiti , Cedras was not happy . Like Aristide , he watched Clinton ' s televised speech Sunday night and did not like what he heard . Only hours after he assented to Carter ' s agreement as a man of honor , Clinton was again denouncing him as a &quot; military dictator. &quot; And Clinton announced that the 15 # 000-strong force was about to enter Haiti &quot; immediately , &quot; whereas Cedras thought the issue was still to be worked_out . Cedras called Carter ' s assistant , Robert Pastor , who had stayed behind in Port-au-Prince . The accord was &quot; breaking_down , &quot; he complained . At the White_House , Carter was not happy . The rhetoric from Clinton ' s aides was infuriating the Haitian generals and threatening to wreck his deal . Carter telephoned the Cable News Network and asked to be interviewed . Without telling Clinton or anyone on the White_House staff , he left the mansion at 6:30 a.m. , went_to CNN ' s Washington studio and gave his startling version of the talks : that Haiti ' s generals had acted in_accord with their sense of honor and dignity , that Clinton ' s decision to put the 82nd Airborne in the air had nearly blocked a deal and that nothing in the agreement required the generals to leave the island . On Capitol_Hill , Congress was not happy . The invasion had been averted , but had the concessions been too great ? Briefing leading senators and members of Congress , Carter was asked why he did not make_it explicit that Cedras must leave Haiti . His response : Forcing the general to leave his country would be a violation of his human_rights . &quot; Give me a break , &quot; moaned Rep . David R . Obey ( D-Wis. ) . But in Port-au-Prince ' s streets , Powell was being proven right . By week ' s end , more_than 10 # 000 American troops were in Haiti , patrolling towns , delivering supplies and bringing the army and police under_control . &quot; The cooperation has been superb , &quot; said Brig . Gen . Richard Potter , commander of the Army Special Forces_unit that seized the Haitian army ' s heavy_weapons . &quot; But what choice do they have ? &quot; Times staff writers John M . Broder , David Lauter , Jim Mann , Jack Nelson and Art Pine in Washington , Kenneth Freed in Port-au-Prince and researcher Edith Stanley in Atlanta contributed to this report .</TEXT>
