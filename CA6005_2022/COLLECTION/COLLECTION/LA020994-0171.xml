   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA FILM FESTIVAL UNDAUNTED BY EARTHQUAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It isn ' t easy launching a new film festival -- even under the best of conditions . It can be difficult to generate enough attention to draw a large audience . And competition for films , in an age when it seems most medium-sized cities boast of a local film festival , can be stiff . Good speakers are hard to find , and the amount of organizational work is enormous . And a large earthquake makes things even tougher . But the recent quake hasn ' t stopped the fledgling Santa Clarita Valley International Film Festival , scheduled for March 18-24 in an area hit particularly hard by earthquake damage . The show must go_on , and it will , though with some changes in the program . &quot; We decided we would go_forward with the festival , and we originally thought we would have to make real programming changes , &quot; said festival director Chris Shoemaker . None of the scheduled speakers , including Jerry Mathers of &quot; Leave It to Beaver &quot; fame and writer Michael Medved , has canceled , and while the festival will now run seven days instead of 10 , only two seminars of 17 have been dropped . It is difficult to predict what effect the earthquake will have_on attendance , especially with damage to key freeways in the area , but the festival ' s director is optimistic . &quot; It ' s hard to say how ready people will be to travel , but we hope people will want to go_to something relatively close ( to Los Angeles ) , &quot; Shoemaker said . &quot; And it could be an important part of the healing process. &quot; The idea for the festival grew out of the film committee of Santa Clarita ' s chamber_of_commerce . &quot; We ' re losing part of our film_industry to out-of-state and out-of-country film concerns , &quot; Shoemaker said . &quot; The festival will focus_on Santa Clarita as a film-friendly community. &quot; The festival will screen family-oriented films , with a special concentration on animation and Westerns . A definite screening schedule has not yet been set . The festival will also include tours of Santa Clarita Valley and a special showing of &quot; Tumbleweeds , &quot; the last film of William S . Hart , a longtime Newhall resident who acted in early Westerns . A lifetime achievement award will be presented to Warner Bros . animator Isadore ( Friz ) Freleng , creator of Porky Pig . Festival organizers are recommending Interstate 5 as the best route from Los Angeles to the Santa Clarita Valley . Though the festival will focus_on family-oriented films , it will be &quot; sensitive to the fact that our concept of a family is being broadened , &quot; Shoemaker said .</TEXT>
