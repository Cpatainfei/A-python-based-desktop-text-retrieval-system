   <HEADLINE> NEW EUROPEAN TRADING BLOC IS USHERED IN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The New Year ushered_in a giant new trading bloc -- the European Economic Area -- linking the European Union and European Free_Trade Assn . and setting the stage for an enlarged EU in a year ' s time . &quot; The EEA . . . will create the biggest integrated economic zone in the world with their more_than 370 million inhabitants , &quot; the European Union ' s external relations commissioner , Hans van den Broek , said recently . &quot; The EEA will give a most welcome impetus toward liberalization on a broader European scale , &quot; he said . The EEA upstages the North_American Free_Trade Agreement as the world ' s biggest free-trade zone by extending the Union ' s single market , celebrating its first birthday , to five out of seven of the EFTA countries -- Austria , Finland , Iceland , Norway and Sweden . While NAFTA is five times bigger than the EEA in terms of land mass , the EEA has 372 million consumers compared with 360 million in NAFTA and is two or three times bigger in terms of trade . It is expected to bring economic benefits in an area stretching from the Arctic to the Mediterranean but is seen by four of the five EFTA states taking_part as just a stepping stone to full EU membership . The EEA will , in particular , provide more competition for public procurement contracts and in the banking and insurance sectors . Norway and Iceland also stand to gain from better access for their fish to the EU . But aware of the market ' s limitations , the EEA does not give the EFTA countries a say in the rules they will have to apply and leaves customs borders intact . Austria , Finland , Norway and Sweden all started negotiating Union membership in 1993 . They hope to spend the next New Year ' s Eve crossing its threshold . If they do , that will leave only Iceland , and maybe Liechtenstein , which hopes to join shortly , in the EEA . But European Commission President Jacques Delors has said he sees the EEA as a way of integrating Eastern European_countries into the European trading scene . The remaining EFTA country , Switzerland , will not take_part in the EEA after its people voted against membership in a referendum . It is seeking to cut its losses by negotiating bilateral accords with the Union .</TEXT>
