   <HEADLINE> MUST KEEP CHILDREN AWAY FROM CRIME , CLINTON SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton decried youth violence Monday , reminding a convention of police_officers of a recent Chicago tragedy in which two boys , 10 and 11 , murdered a 5-year-old who had refused to steal . &quot; We can hire 5 million police_officers and , if we keep losing the battle for what these kids think is right and wrong , we ' re going to be in a lot of trouble , &quot; he said . &quot; Kids are going_to look_up_to somebody , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; It ' s up_to the adults in this country to decide who they ' re going to look_up to. &quot; America has many resources to carry it into the future , Clinton said . &quot; But what we must be worried about is wave upon wave upon wave of these little children who don ' t have somebody both good and strong to look_up_to , who are so vulnerable that their hearts can be turned_to stone by the time they ' re 10 or 11 years old. &quot; As is often the case , those remarks -- which formed the emotional highlight of Clinton ' s speech -- came as a departure from his prepared text . Aides said that Clinton penned the thoughts while flying here from Washington , adding them to a text initially focused_on the anti-crime bill that passed Congress in August . Clinton ' s speech , to the International Assn . of Chiefs of Police , came as part of a continuing campaign by the Administration to rehabilitate the anti-crime bill , which has come under unrelenting attack from Republicans , who have attempted -- with some success -- to hang the &quot; pork &quot; label on the package . Responding to that charge , Clinton told the convention that with the bill now law , federal and local officials together must &quot; demonstrate to our people that the money is being_well spent . &quot; For most of its life , this crime bill enjoyed broad , bipartisan support , &quot; Clinton said . But , he said , the bill &quot; became a political football &quot; at the end of the process . &quot; We must never again permit crime to be divisive in a partisan political way , &quot; Clinton declared . He almost immediately followed that declaration with an attack on Republicans , suggesting that the GOP ' s pledge to both balance the federal budget and cut taxes would require &quot; cuts_in everything else &quot; including &quot; this crime bill. &quot; Clinton ' s remarks generally were_well received by his audience . White_House officials hope that personal endorsements of the crime bill ' s provisions by local law_enforcement officials will help refurbish the image of the package . In a further effort toward that end , the Administration has begun rapidly distributing the money for more police_officers contained in the bill , releasing the first round of grants last week . In his speech , Clinton announced new rules designed to speed_up additional grants . The rules will allow many cities to hire additional officers before actually receiving their federal money , with Washington paying part of the payroll costs once the officers are sworn_in .</TEXT>
