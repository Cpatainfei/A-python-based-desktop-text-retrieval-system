   <TEXT> On Aug . 11 , 1984 , Paul Gonzales started a gold_rush at the Los Angeles Olympics , becoming the first of nine American boxers to win a gold medal . The victory also was significant because Gonzales became the first Latino to win an Olympic gold medal . On the 10th anniversary of his achievement , Gonzales announced his retirement from boxing at the Amateur Athletic Foundation in the Adams District . &quot; Boxing has been a very important and exciting period of my life , &quot; Gonzales said during Thursday ' s press_conference . &quot; But it ' s time to close that chapter of my life. &quot; Al Stanke , the Los Angeles Police_Department officer who transformed Gonzales from a barrio street punk to a Olympic champion , spoke first about his protege . &quot; I met Paul when he was 9 years old , &quot; Stanke said . &quot; He was a mischievous kid . A cute kid . . . . He was scrappy , and good and tough . And he had attitude. &quot; Stanke brought Gonzales to the Hollenbeck Division , where the building ' s basement had been converted to a boxing gym . &quot; ( Paul ) threw punches even when he was_on the ground . I knew he had all_the D ' s : dedication , desire and determination. &quot; Coached by Stanke , Gonzales won 18 national Amateur Athletic Union titles . As a pro , Gonzales had an 18-4 record as a flyweight and a bantamweight . His success was limited by injuries . Before he announced his retirement , Gonzales asked Danny Valdivia , who was ring announcer of that fight , to re-enact his gold medal victory announcement from the 1984 Games . &quot; The gold medal_winner of the 106-pound division , from East L.A. , Paul Gonzales ! &quot; Valdivia said . In his farewell speech , Gonzales said that he wants to end his much-publicized feud with Oscar De La Hoya , the 1992 Olympic champion and fellow East L.A. resident . &quot; Oscar and I , as Olympians , need to work together and need to show kids a brighter future , &quot; Gonzales said . * The Great Western Forum reshuffled its boxing card for Monday night when Mark Johnson of Washington failed to recover from a shoulder injury . Johnson , ranked No . 2 by the International Boxing Federation , dislocated his right shoulder during workouts for his scheduled 12-round bout against Narcisco Rodriguez of the Dominican_Republic . &quot; No one feels worse about this than me , &quot; said Johnson , who is 20-1 with 13 knockouts . Rodriguez , who was making his U.S. debut , is 13-0 with seven knockouts . The main event will match Marco Antonio Barrera ( 31-1 , 21 knockouts ) against Vinicio ( Junior ) Rodriguez ( 14-3-1 , 11 knockouts ) in a super bantamweight bout . Preliminary bouts begin at 7:15 p.m. Of local interest , Julio Cesar Borboa of East Los Angeles will make his sixth IBF junior bantamweight title defense against Harold Grey of Colombia on Aug . 29 at the Forum . Borboa , originally of Sonora , Mexico , is 23-4 with 21 knockouts .
