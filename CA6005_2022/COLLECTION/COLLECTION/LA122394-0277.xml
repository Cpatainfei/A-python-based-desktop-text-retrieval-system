   <HEADLINE> COUNTY MAY HAVE LAW ON ITS SIDE IN VOIDING CONTRACTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County appeared to have the law on its side as the Board of Supervisors tore_up collective_bargaining agreements with county employee groups Thursday in_order to rescind pay raises and make_it easier to lay off hundreds of workers in coming weeks . The job cuts are part of an emergency effort to trim $ 40.2 million from the county budget . Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection Dec . 6 after disclosing that the investment pool run_by the county treasurer had lost $ 2.02 billion from risky bond investments . The board ' s unanimous decision Thursday to rewrite seniority-based layoff policies that have been central to labor_agreements is not going_to be accepted gracefully . John H . Sawyer , head of the Orange County Employees Assn. , which represents nearly 70 % of the county work_force , expressed outrage at the board ' s vote to allow department_heads to order layoffs based on productivity . He said his group would consider a court challenge . The move could &quot; violate the vested constitutional rights of county employees &quot; and is &quot; predicated on a crude and ill-thought-out application of Chapter 11 to a Chapter 9 proceeding , &quot; said John Sawyer Jr. , the employee group ' s attorney and son of its general_manager . &quot; Eliminating seniority seems to be designed to replace the merit_system with favoritism , &quot; he said . Some bankruptcy law specialists say an oddity of municipal bankruptcy law allows the board action . In revoking sections of their collective_bargaining agreements with nearly 16 # 000 county employees , the supervisors and the county ' s attorney cited a 1984 Supreme Court decision that says a company in bankruptcy can unilaterally abandon a collective_bargaining agreement if revisions cannot be agreed upon . That case involved the Continental Airlines bankruptcy in 1983 , when then-Chairman Frank Lorenzo took the airline into Chapter 11 bankruptcy specifically to break its union contracts during a protracted labor dispute . Acting at the behest of labor_unions outraged by the airline ' s bankruptcy , Congress in 1984 added a section to the federal Bankruptcy Code that overrode the Supreme Court decision and prohibited employers from canceling labor_agreements . Although that new provision was incorporated into Chapter 11 , which regulates business reorganizations , Congress overlooked the little-used municipal bankruptcy rules of Chapter 9 . &quot; They probably would have added it to Chapter 9 if they had they thought_about it , but they didn ' t , and so the law ( for government bankruptcies ) gets thrown_back &quot; to the 1984 Supreme Court ruling , said Daniel J . Bussel , a UCLA law professor specializing in bankruptcy . Kenneth N . Klee , a Los Angeles attorney who was minority counsel to the House Judiciary Committee when Chapter 9 was revised and updated in 1975 , said there is a history of Congress exempting governments in bankruptcy from the rules that bind private parties . &quot; In 1975 , when New York City was considering a Chapter 9 filing , it was considering abrogating its union contracts and the unions were very opposed , &quot; Klee said . &quot; But when Chapter 9 was revised ( later that same year ) , there were no special provisions put_in to protect unions and their collective_bargaining agreements. &quot; He said that because Chapter 9 does not include special protections for labor_agreements , a municipal bankruptcy is governed by an older provision of bankruptcy law that allows a debtor to void any contract if it determines that honoring it would be financially harmful . Klee , whose law_firm is advising Orange County in its bankruptcy , declined to comment on the appropriateness of the county ' s action Thursday . But Rich Reuben , a labor law specialist with the Newport Beach office of Pillsbury Madison &amp; Sutro , said the county seems to be supported by current law . &quot; Of course , there haven ' t been very many Chapter 9 filings , so there probably isn ' t anyone who really knows how a court would treat this , &quot; he said . &quot; This case is going_to set ground_rules for handling a host of issues in the Chapter 9 arena , and this issue of collective_bargaining definitely will be one of them. &quot; Labor attorneys and representatives were reluctant to lash_out at the county without seeing first just how far supervisors are willing to go_to slash personnel costs . &quot; We definitely have a different view of the law from that which the county apparently has , &quot; said John Sawyer Jr .</TEXT>
