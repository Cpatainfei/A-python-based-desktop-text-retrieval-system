   <HEADLINE> THE SUNDAY PROFILE ; THE ' MODEL MILLIONAIRES ' ; THE NORTONS RODE THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION TO A STATE OF FINANCIAL BLISS . THEN THEY DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO PLAY -- WITH THEIR KIDS , ART AND CHARITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is a rare quiet day at the Santa Monica villa of computer software king Peter Norton and his wife , Eileen . Hillary Rodham Clinton has recently come and gone , as have William Gray , head of the United Negro College Fund , a group of 800 looky-loos on a garden tour and the guests at a preschool fund raiser . The Nortons are hanging_out at the kitchen_table . Their butler , who used to work for Malcolm Forbes , hovers discreetly . &quot; We ' re ordinary . We ' d be living_in Torrance with crabgrass if it weren ' t for a bit of luck , &quot; Peter offers , sipping a Snapple . &quot; We ' re average . He ' s a programmer . I ' m an elementary_school teacher . It ' s what happened to us that ' s unusual , &quot; chimes Eileen . What happened is that Peter Norton became a living legend in the software world , turning a $ 30 # 000 investment into multiple millions through great timing and technological savvy . First he created Unerase , which allowed personal_computer users to retrieve lost data . Then he invented the Norton Utilities_program now employed by virtually all_of mankind to solve a wide range of PC problems . What happened next is perhaps even more amazing . In 1990 , after seven years in business -- and before his company had reached its growth potential -- the couple called_off &quot; the money acquisition phase &quot; of their lives . He had not hit 50 , she was not yet 40 . Their two children weren ' t in kindergarten yet . Their wealth , estimated at between $ 200 million and $ 400 million , was not immense by computer-biz standards . ( Microsoft ' s Bill Gates , for example , is a multibillionaire. ) Still , the pair decided to stop working and start playing . And to find ways to repay society for their good_fortune . Nowadays , they share a passion for art ( their private collection numbers 1 # 000 pieces ) , for philanthropy ( they will donate $ 2 million this year ) and -- &quot; this may sound sappy , &quot; Eileen warns -- for each other . &quot; The Nortons are America ' s model millionaires , &quot; says David Ross , director of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York . &quot; If this country had even a_few more like them , we ' d be a better place. &quot; Could his enthusiasm be colored by a Norton Family Foundation gift of $ 134 # 000 -- in 1993 alone -- to the museum ? &quot; Irrelevant , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' ve known them for years . They ' re warm , unpredictable , fearless . There ' s something wonderful and unusual about the fact that they act_as a couple , that they do their philanthropy together . I get the feeling that as their children grow , they ' ll be engaged in it as well. &quot; The foundation , set_up in 1989 to benefit cultural and humanitarian causes , is &quot; small potatoes &quot; compared to those of America ' s wealthiest families , Peter says . On the other hand , it ' s more flexible than the big &quot; belt and suspenders boards , &quot; helping the young , the new and the needy within hours or days . All either Norton has to say is &quot; yes. &quot; Curator Simon Watson sent_out 50 applications last fall_for funds to bring an exhibition on cross-dressing from the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston to his alternative-space museum in New York . Only the Nortons answered in the affirmative . &quot; They have a world_view , &quot; Watson says . &quot; They like the new , the talented , the offbeat and the untried. &quot; Joshua Decter , who asked the Nortons for $ 7 # 500 to continue publishing his New York-based alternative art journal , Acme , received the same response . &quot; They came_through , turning_on a dime. &quot; The couple also gives to larger art institutions and humanitarian causes . They sponsor admission-free Thursday nights at the Museum of Contemporary Art and last year gave to such groups as Big Sisters of Los Angeles , Coalition for Clean Air , Children of the Night , Dance Theater of Harlem , the Fund for a Free Africa and the Democratic Party , which received $ 100 # 000 . * No one could have predicted that Eileen Harris and Peter Norton would ever meet . &quot; We tell people the story and they don ' t believe us , &quot; she says . Peter and his two brothers grew_up in Seattle in what he calls &quot; a real white-bread , white-picket fence , Ozzie-and-Harriet type of family. &quot; His father was an insurance sales executive , his mother a homemaker . &quot; There was no great art on the walls , &quot; Peter quips . During summer vacations from Reed College in Portland , Ore. , he worked for an actuarial firm , where he learned programming . &quot; They showed me a new IBM 1620 , threw the manual at me , and I took_to it like a duck to water. &quot; After college , he spent five years in a Zen monastery in Northern California ( &quot; Yes , I was a monk , &quot; he says , declining to elaborate ) and took a series of conventional programming jobs . None lasted more_than two years . &quot; I get bored too easily , &quot; he says . At 39 , he was living_in a small Venice apartment , working in Van Nuys and wondering how to meet Ms . Right . &quot; I was seeking a black spouse , &quot; Norton says , &quot; because I have always been attracted to black_women . I find them gorgeous. &quot; He decided to place a personal ad in the singles magazine Intro . * Eileen grew_up in Watts , in a household with her divorced mother , two uncles and a grandfather . The men worked for the postal_service , her mother was a retail salesclerk . After Hamilton High_School , she commuted from home to UCLA , where she earned her bachelor ' s degree . And to USC , where she earned her master ' s in bilingual education . And after that , to a series of teaching jobs in the Los Angeles Unified School District . &quot; Most parents push their kids out of the house at one point or another . But not my family , &quot; Eileen says with a smile . She dated -- always African Americans -- but had yet to meet anyone exciting . &quot; I was 29 years old , working_at an elementary_school where there was nobody to meet , and all my friends were having the same problem . I was beginning to wonder exactly what my options were. &quot; Her mother urged her to listen to Dr. Toni Grant on the radio . The talk-show therapist mentioned the personal ads in Intro magazine . &quot; I bought a copy , said ' no way ' and chucked it , &quot; Eileen says . Six months later , she changed her mind . * Their ads ran in the same issue . She noticed his , but didn ' t respond , preferring to see who would answer hers . Three men responded . She met two , but nothing clicked . &quot; And then there was Peter . . . . &quot; Their first date at a falafel place , now closed , in Westwood Village went so well that they crossed Westwood Boulevard to the Chatham restaurant , also now defunct , where they continued to eat and talk . They dated again . And again . In January , 1983 , Peter purchased an IBM personal_computer . He told Eileen that he wanted to quit his &quot; nowhere job &quot; and live_off his modest savings while playing with the computer to see if he could &quot; become independently employed. &quot; He began by writing books and programs for the first PC owners . As mail_orders started trickling in , he offered Eileen a job as his gofer . Bored with teaching , she agreed . Working in his Venice apartment , he wrote while she packed , labeled and mailed packages . &quot; He was a terrible boss , &quot; she recalls . &quot; You had to do things his way. &quot; But they were in_love , and the little business was growing . They married on a Sunday morning , Nov . 27 , 1983 , at the Albertson Wedding Chapel on Wilshire at La Brea . Their families never mentioned the racial difference , Eileen says : &quot; They were very happy for us. &quot; * Within five years , they had hit the financial big-time . And Peter was bored : &quot; I had done programming for so_long , I ' d had my fill of it. &quot; Entrepreneurship no longer titillated him . But what else does one do with wealth ? Peter studied the_matter . &quot; American wealth normally has three phases , which are usually lived_out in three successive generations : making a fortune , using it , dissipating it , &quot; he says . &quot; We wanted our life to encompass the first two phases. &quot; The couple decided to spend the rest of their lives &quot; indulging in the recreation of philanthropy. &quot; ' Norton merged his namesake firm with Symantec Corp . of Cupertino , receiving one-third of Symantec ' s stock , some of which he sold in the early ' 90s for prices varying between $ 20 and $ 47 per share . He still owns 1 million Symantec shares , and earns royalties for the use of his name and face on Norton products . Long before they had any &quot; real money , &quot; Eileen and Peter visited art_galleries . ( &quot; What else does a couple do on a date ? &quot; she asks. ) Later , they focused their philanthropy on art because it was a shared interest and because they wanted to help local talents . &quot; L.A. has some of the world ' s best young artists just starting careers . If no one buys . . . they have to stop making art and get another kind of day job , &quot; Peter says . The Nortons , listed by Art News magazine among the world ' s top 200 collectors , still gallery-surf on Saturdays . &quot; We have a one-vote policy , &quot; he explains . &quot; If either one of us votes for ( a piece ) , we buy it. &quot; As a result , their high-ceilinged , 15 # 000-square-foot house ( 36 phones , 10 bedrooms , 13 baths , three playrooms , a kids ' computer room . . . ) has scarcely a wall , table , mantel , niche or crevice unadorned by eye-popping , socially conscious art . &quot; I would n ' t necessarily call ( the art ) cutting edge . . . sometimes it ' s just out on the edge . . . period , &quot; says Robert Storr , curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York . Storr means that as a compliment , but some in the art world question the erratic quality of the Nortons ' acquisitions -- and suggest that their money has won them undue influence . &quot; They ' re sincere and adventurous , but they have no defined taste , &quot; says one critic who requested anonymity . Another suggested that the couple has tried too hard and too fast to advance the careers of perhaps undeserving artists . &quot; that ' s ridiculous , &quot; counters Paul Schimmel , chief curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art . &quot; Taste is for fashion_designers and decorators , not art collectors . The Nortons are specialists in the area of emerging artists with strong political and social content. &quot; The Nortons respond sensibly to criticism . For heaven ' s sake , the curmudgeonly Peter scoffs , he and Eileen are relative novices at all this . Isn ' t that the fun of it ? &quot; I spent my life doing what I ' m good at -- computer_science . It ' s more interesting to do what I ' m not particularly good at , what I must struggle with and may even be incompetent at. &quot; * Although the Nortons own works by household-name artists ( Chagall , Goya , Hockney ) , most of those pieces are in storage or on loan . Their penchant for the new and unusual is evident in the art they choose to live with . A quick reading of the computer printout itemizing their home collection reveals works fabricated with marijuana leaves , brown paper shopping_bags , grease , hair , wire hangers , smoked cigarette_butts , a bedpan filled with straw and eggs . Alongside the spiral staircase , naked light_bulbs dangle from a rope attached_to a skylight 50 feet above . The piece , by artist and AIDS activist Felix Gonzalez-Torres , is a family favorite , Peter says . &quot; It looks whimsical , but it has to do with memory and loss , with having the bulbs burn_out at different times . It ' s very much a metaphor for life. &quot; Niches in a hallway contain colorful little sculptures of the Seven Dwarfs , prison bars in front of a painted blue_sky and other visually entertaining pieces . Life-size deer peer out the library ' s French_windows , their antlers wired to light_up at night . A rug reads , &quot; There are two things I need to watch for the rest of my life : My weight and my racism. &quot; And the dining_room table is perpetually set with Lenox plates commemorating such people as Harriet Tubman , &quot; for being willing to take even her husband ' s woman to freedom. &quot; In the sun room , among objets d ' art on the coffee_table , a $ 5-million dollar check to the Internal Revenue Service is encased in a Lucite brick . &quot; It was the largest check I ever wrote ; whenever I write one for more_than $ 1 million , I keep it around , &quot; Peter says . &quot; Do the kids ever mess with all this art ? &quot; a visitor asks the butler . &quot; Never , &quot; he replies loftily . As if on cue , little Michael , 5 , enters , twirling dervishly . He promptly loses_control of his toy baton , scoring a direct hit on a fragile sculpture . &quot; It ' s inevitable when there are kids around , &quot; Eileen says later with a shrug . Fortunately , a staff_member maintains the art . The Nortons have no idea how much of it is in the house on any given day . &quot; It changes all_the time , &quot; Eileen says . &quot; When we ' re tired_of looking_at one thing , we replace it with something else. &quot; And sometimes , one of their two full-time curators removes a work for repair or for an exhibition . * Unexpected art is one thing . Unexpected intruders , another . As she shows a guest around upstairs , Eileen opens a door and literally stumbles onto a crouching man who , it turns_out , is fixing the elaborate phone_system , which has gone kaflooey . ( The system includes a home-to-office hot_line used only by Eileen and Peter . &quot; It ' s the boss , &quot; he says when it rings. ) &quot; You scared the hell out of me , &quot; Eileen tells the phone man , hand on heart . Then , turning_to her guest , says , &quot; You see why this house is too big for us ? I never know who ' s in it. &quot; Both Nortons believe the house , bought_in 1992 , was a mistake . &quot; It ' s great for displaying the art , and it sings when there are hundreds of people around . But there are only four of us -- two adults and two kids . Who needs all this ? &quot; Eileen asks . At her old house , she says , &quot; I used to answer my own phone like a normal person . I can ' t do that here. &quot; Nor can she oversee the two maids , nanny and other occasional help to her satisfaction . &quot; There are just too many. &quot; In a later conversation , Eileen does confess it was she who wanted the big house . And it ' s not the only residence she has persuaded Peter to buy . &quot; We were walking on the beach at Oak Bluffs on Martha ' s Vineyard , and I saw this white Victorian that looked_like a wedding_cake . ' Oh , let ' s get_it , ' I said. &quot; Peter reminded her that they had just bid on a much larger house in the same community . &quot; Well , we got them both , &quot; Eileen says . &quot; And it ' s a good thing . Because while the big one was being renovated , we had a place to stay. &quot; The truth , she confides , is that the little house , now designated for summer guests , is much more fun to live_in than the big one . Oak Bluffs is a summer community populated by some of East Coast ' s most successful and influential African American families . &quot; Let ' s face it , &quot; Eileen says . &quot; Our children look more like me than they look_like him . They are black . But here in Santa Monica , they ' re in a white environment . &quot; On the Vineyard , there are lots of black upper-middle-class families . The children get_to see successful black people doing all_the same things that successful white people do here . They see doctors , lawyers , bankers , artists . We want them to grow_up knowing that black people are just as successful as whites , something they don ' t see around here . I mean , there is one other black child in Diana ' s class and none in Michael ' s. &quot; The Nortons have chosen to live_in such communities , they say , partly to protect Diana and Michael from the pain of racial intolerance . The children ' s horse will be shipped to the Vineyard for the summer . * The business of maintaining and managing all this stuff is complex . At first , the Nortons took_care of it from their bedroom . When that became inadequate , Peter &quot; studied up_on the history of American wealth. &quot; He was drawn to the concept of the family office , which flourished in the 19th Century . The Norton Family Office opened in the 1991 , on the second floor of an elegant Santa Monica building . With a staff of 13 ( including an executive_director , the two curators , a bookkeeper who is also mayor of Santa Monica and various support personnel ) , it consolidates management of all_the personal , philanthropic and professional activities . On a typical day , Peter arrives there at about 8:30 , after dropping his daughter off at a private_school . Dressed for comfort in blue oxford-cloth shirt and chinos , he settles into a small office that offers a long view of the perpetual circus on the Third Street Promenade . &quot; I thought when I sold my business my time would be rather idle , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s why our offices are strategically placed across the street from not one , but two multiplex theaters , where I thought I would spend a substantial portion of my weekday afternoons . &quot; But the reality is that I work a solid day , and then half of the evening after my wife goes_to_sleep , dealing with what the_French like to call affaires ( business ) . &quot; A &quot; demon correspondent , &quot; he sends_out 10 # 000 pieces of mail annually to friends and associates , he says . Most are postcards featuring his &quot; goofy pictures of the family. &quot; One shows the foursome in front of Air_Force One , which they toured the day of the infamous presidential haircut . In recent months , he has been traveling often as his ties on the East Coast grow stronger . He is_on the board of the Museum of Contemporary Art and the California Institute of the Arts , both in Los Angeles . In New York , he serves on committees at the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum , and is_on the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art . * Eileen drives their son to school each morning . Although she has &quot; a huge closet and no budget constraints , &quot; she zips around town in white cotton T-shirts , pants , simple vests . &quot; The kids wear Gap , &quot; she says . She gardens , plays tennis , does yoga or works_on her philanthropic projects until the children , 5 and 6 , come_home . Then she chauffeurs them to their activities -- listed daily , along with hers , on a computer printout . Her charitable work has become increasingly non-art-related . She is_on the board of the Children ' s Defense Fund , in Washington , D.C , and masterminds a kind of think_tank in Los Angeles called the Forum on Children ' s Issues . It brings_together experts from various disciplines to network on issues critical to children . In April , for example , a health-care forum at the Century Plaza hotel included Rep . Pat Schroeder ( D-Colo. ) , Marian Wright Edelman of the Children ' s Defense Fund , L.A. Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , and a host of medical experts and other advocates . Eileen ' s staff of two Forum consultants also work_out of the family office . Ironically , Eileen and Peter see each other less now that he ' s not &quot; working. &quot; And she admits she doesn ' t like it : &quot; I tell him he ' s away too_much , and the children notice the difference. &quot; He says he understands . &quot; For a surprisingly long_time we were inseparable , &quot; he says . &quot; We spent 22 hours a day , day after day , week after week , together. &quot; * What could go_wrong with their grand life plan ? Nothing so far , Eileen says . They have wonderful friends -- mostly the parents of their children ' s schoolmates -- good_health and more_than enough things . Yet no life is ever totally placid , she adds . Aside from struggling to find the right spot , physically , in which to comfortably settle , there are niggling problems relating to social comfort . &quot; We open our house to so many fund-raisers , because we want to share it . that ' s what it ' s here for . We have also thrown many private parties . Hundreds of people have been invited to our homes over the years . I ' m not taking_notes or anything , but I can count_on the fingers of my hands the number of people who have reciprocated . &quot; When you ' ve invited so many people , and you never get an invitation for a drink or a cup of coffee , you realize something is amiss . I think it ' s because of me . I think if Peter had a blond , blue-eyed wife , he ' d be inundated with invitations. &quot; Peter says he ' s totally untroubled about the lack of invitations . In fact , he barely perceives a problem . &quot; But then again , I ' m white , &quot; he says with a grin , &quot; which makes me less sensitive to these things. &quot; &quot; We are different from other people and we know it , &quot; Eileen says . &quot; Not just different in our marriage , but in the whole way we approach the world . I guess it ' s difficult for us to find_out exactly who our peers are. &quot; that ' s understandable . &quot; They have few equals , &quot; says the Whitney ' s Ross . &quot; Not because of their money , but because they live their lives in active gratitude. &quot; Peter and Eileen Norton First date : Chow at a falafel place , now defunct , in Westwood Village . Married : Nov . 27 , 1983 , at the Albertson Wedding Chapel in Los Angeles . Children : Two ; Diana , 6 , and Michael , 5 . Interests : Aiding young , new and / or needy artists , as well as myriad humanitarian causes . Passions : Collecting art with an edge . Peter Quoted : * On being average : &quot; I am not a genius . I ' m not even gifted . I ' m just your garden-variety smart person. &quot; * On being a non-player : &quot; Player is one of those pretentious terms that is used to invoke the idea of people who have power and can influence or manipulate things . It is not a word . . . I would aspire to have applied to me. &quot; * On being restless : &quot; If this were a cowboy movie , I ' d be the drifter. &quot; Eileen Quoted : * On having a good_deal of money : &quot; It does not buy you happiness or health or inner peace . But it buys you the freedom to have things , like a wonderful garden. &quot; * On opening their home for fund-raisers : &quot; People say , ' Oh , you ' re so kind. ' They say they could never have all those hundreds of people in their yard . . . . It just amazes Peter and me that people are so possessive of their . . . grass. &quot; * On the meaning of life : &quot; What it all comes_down to is family . that ' s really the only thing of_value anyone has. &quot; ;</TEXT>
