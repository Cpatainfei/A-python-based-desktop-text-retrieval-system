   <HEADLINE> FRONT BRINGS WIND , SNOW ; WAVE BREAKS CRUISE_SHIP WINDOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A brief but energetic cold_front blew through Southern California on Sunday , leaving up_to a half-foot of snow on local mountains and injuring 15 people when a wave broke a window on a Catalina cruise vessel . The storm forced cancellation of the Renaissance Pleasure Faire in rural San Bernardino County , sending visitors at the open-air event running_for their cars to get_away from the wind , rain and pea-sized hail . &quot; The storm was obviously very vigorous , but not very large as far as area covered , &quot; said John Henderson , a meteorologist for the National Weather Service . &quot; We had very strong winds but we didn ' t get a lot of precipitation. &quot; The gusts , reported at speeds of up_to 50 m.p.h. , kicked_up 6-to-12-foot swells in the Catalina Channel , where a vessel operated by the Catalina Cruises company lost a port side window about 25 minutes out of Long_Beach shortly after 2 p.m. Sunday . Rescue boats met the cruise_ship as it returned to Long_Beach Harbor , where paramedics treated three passengers for neck and back injuries before taking them and 12 others to St . Mary Medical_Center in Long_Beach . The 12 were treated for minor injuries , including cuts from flying glass . All were released . A Long_Beach Fire_Department official said there were several hundred passengers on the ship , which has a capacity of 700 . &quot; They were in pretty rough seas out there and they were hit by a big wave that broke a window , &quot; said Petty_Officer Billy Williams of the U.S. Coast Guard . &quot; People out there know the weather ' s bad but that never stopped anybody from getting_in a boat and going_out there. &quot; Carolyn Carter , spokeswoman for St . Mary Medical_Center , said some of those treated complained of back and neck pains . &quot; A lot of them have symptoms of anxiety , so they ' re being counseled by our social_worker , &quot; she said . &quot; They ' re just upset by the incident. &quot; Representatives of the cruise firm were not available for comment . High_seas tossed ashore a California seal pup that perched atop a parked car near Santa Monica beach until animal control officers could capture it and send it to Sea World for medical treatment , according to lifeguard Lt . Ira Gruber . The same storm was expected to bring heavy rains to the Midwest by midweek . Another cold_front was expected to move through Southern California tonight or Tuesday morning , dropping a tenth of an inch of rain on coastal areas and up_to a quarter-inch of precipitation in the mountains . The weekend precipitation was too slight to be measured at Los Angeles International Airport , but weather spotters called_in reports of two inches of snow at Big Bear , three inches at Idyllwild and six inches at Tehachapi .</TEXT>
