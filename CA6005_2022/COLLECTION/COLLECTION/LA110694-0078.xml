   <HEADLINE> AN ANCIENT CHINESE PRACTICE GOES UPTOWN ; NEW YORK : FENG SHUI IS REPUTED TO CREATE A POSITIVE ENERGY FLOW , BRINGING GOOD_LUCK AND FORTUNE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It might have been the seven gold and two black fish . When the owners of Las Americas Jewelry put the nine fish in their small Chinatown store , as recommended by their feng shui master , business jumped 12 % by the end of last year . The personal lives of their employees are looking_up , the owner has new business_deals and the prescription marble floors generate great traffic flow . &quot; Not only that , there ' s a harmony in the store , there ' s no internal feuding -- and we ' re having two girls getting_married this year ! &quot; manager Anna Fung said . Just about anyone in New York ' s Chinatown will tell you what they ' ve known for years : The ancient practice of creating positive energy flow through a home or place_of_business brings good_luck and fortune . But today , feng shui -- the Chinese characters for wind and water , pronounced FUNG-shway -- is making its way uptown . Way uptown . As in Donald Trump uptown . The architects , designers and real_estate moguls in Manhattan ' s skyscrapers are discovering feng shui , due in part to the enormous influence of Asian financiers . &quot; He who has the dollars will make the decisions on how buildings are oriented and designed , &quot; said Abe Wallach , vice_president for the Trump Organization . And those who have the dollars for Donald Trump ' s billion-dollar Riverside South project are from Hong Kong , where the use of feng shui is rampant . &quot; If the capital sources are coming from this part of the world , those capital dollars come_with certain perspectives that need to be recognized , &quot; Wallach said in a telephone_interview from Hong Kong . Long before mainstream Manhattan discovered the practice , the ancient Chinese believed there were shaman who could interpret signs from the elements on where to build a house or cemetery to best harmonize with nature . Feng shui masters have been revered in the Far East for centuries as priests and doctors able to read the heavens and take the pulse of the Earth . Tin Sun , one of the most respected feng shui masters in New York , trained at a temple for nine years in Canton , southern China . Today , he has a radio show and writes columns on feng shui for Chinese-language publications . &quot; The universe is very mysterious . There ' s so_much energy to pick_up , but most people don ' t know how , &quot; said the 66-year-old master . It was Tin who advised the owner of Las Americas on everything from lighting , wall colors and the aquarium with nine fish , an auspicious number in Chinese culture . &quot; The two black fish always die because they absorb the negative energy , &quot; said his daughter , Pun Yin . &quot; I always tell people not to buy expensive fish. &quot; Much of what Tin does sounds like common-sense renovation . Although that ' s true , he said , most people don ' t know how to apply it properly . So he guides them , using a Chinese compass called a luopan , the Chinese Almanac and a lunar_calendar to combine metaphysics and intuition . Working with Pun Yin , also a master , they enter a home and determine the most auspicious positioning for desks , beds , the dining-room table , the kitchen_stove and mirrors , which should never be placed in front of or over the bed . &quot; Everyone has a soul , &quot; Tin said . &quot; Some people believe when the spirit travels , trying to go_back to the body , it can bounce off the mirrors . Some people wake_up with bruises. &quot; Clodagh , one of New York ' s leading designers , worked with another feng shui master on her interior_design at Felissimo , a cozy New Age department_store just off Fifth_Avenue . &quot; She helped us locate the best position to generate money , &quot; said Clodagh , who uses only one name . &quot; The Chinese are very pragmatic about money . Clean running water denotes money . So when you walk through Felissimo , you ' ll see that there ' s a lot of water going on. &quot; Clodagh worked_on Felissimo and other projects with Sarah Rossbach , the author of three books on feng shui who studied for 10 years to become a master . When she steps into a room , Rossbach said , &quot; I ' m seeing how the structure or the layout of the home and the office and the external elements are affecting that person. &quot; For example , Rossbach told one client designing a penthouse apartment that there was a bad feeling as you entered . &quot; When you walked in , she wanted to have an angle pointed at you , almost like this threatening knife , and I thought that was very hostile , &quot; Rossbach said . So they softened the angle with light and plants . Some masters charge by the square_foot . Rossbach charges , depending_on the type of job , $ 250 an hour or $ 750 for a half-day . Steve Robinson , a Santa Fe , N.M. , architect who follows pueblo Indian architecture in much of his designs , became interested in feng shui when he realized its similarities to the ancient belief of the southwestern American_Indians , who built their pueblos to harmonize with the Earth ' s energy . They , too , had a term for it : &quot; po-waha , &quot; which roughly means that wind , water and breath is the essence of life , Robinson said . Working on the design for a new art_gallery , he sent the blueprints to Rossbach , who recommended several changes . One focused_on a western wing of the gallery , where visitors would enter on an axis toward a fireplace . &quot; She felt there ought to be something suspended from the ceiling . . . something to catch the energy before it gets_to the fireplace , &quot; he said . Feng shui is becoming so popular in the design field that Robinson said he fears it will lose its traditional roots . &quot; It ' s on the verge , I ' m afraid , of it becoming somewhat of a buzzword , &quot; he said . &quot; we ' ll have to survive that . It ' s far more powerful than that. &quot; Feng Shui Tips for Home and Office Some basic_principles of feng shui , according to several masters : In the Home * The bed should be cater-corner to the door so you can see anyone entering the bedroom . Don ' t place mirrors in front of the bed , as they absorb negative &quot; qi , &quot; or life force , that can enter you while you sleep . * Avoid placing the bed directly under a beam . A beam over your feet will hinder travel ; a beam over the middle of a bed can disturb a couple ' s love . * During pregnancy , don ' t dust under beds . Some Chinese believe the universe is_full of &quot; ling , &quot; or spirits . The ling try to enter the womb during pregnancy to give the fetus its life force . Dusting can scatter the ling and cause the woman to miscarry . * In ancient China , food represented wealth , so stoves are symbolic of fortune . Cooks should not have their backs to the kitchen door or domestic harmony will suffer . In the Office * The presence of water draws_in money . Companies next to rivers or lakes can hang mirrors to reflect the water ' s qi into their environment . * Desks should sit cater-corner to the door with the occupant facing the door so they maintain control of their space . Exteriors * Homes should never be built next to cemeteries and bridges , which can reflect negative forces . * Homes should not face oncoming traffic , which is like a knife to the heart . Offices should not face glass buildings , which absorb the negative energy of their surroundings and reflect back on the company . Colors * White is the most dreaded color because it symbolizes mourning and death , just as black does_in the West . White_rooms should always be dotted with red or green to break the color ' s negative force . * Red is the most auspicious color , denoting happiness , fire and power . * Green symbolizes tranquillity , growth and good_health .
