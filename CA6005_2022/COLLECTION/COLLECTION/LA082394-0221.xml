   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA , GERMANY PLEDGE TO BATTLE NUCLEAR SMUGGLING ; EUROPE : OFFICIALS FAIL TO DETERMINE ORIGINS OF SEIZED PLUTONIUM . THEY URGE GLOBAL INFORMATION-SHARING ON ISSUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wake of last week ' s plutonium scare , Russia and Germany agreed Monday to boost their joint efforts to prevent nuclear smuggling , but they failed to determine whether the atomic contraband captured in Munich actually originated_in Russia . Wrapping_up three days of talks in Moscow , Bernd Schmidbauer , the German intelligence coordinator , and his Russian counterparts issued a determinedly neutral statement concluding that they must all fight harder against the nuclear black_market &quot; regardless of its origins. &quot; German officials have said the 10.5-ounce cache of purloined plutonium-239 , nabbed in Munich on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow two weeks ago , probably came from Russia . But Moscow has strenuously denied it could have been produced here , and Sergei Stepashin , Russia ' s counterintelligence chief , told reporters Monday that its point of origin remains unclear . The plutonium incident , the fourth lot of nuclear contraband to surface in Germany in four months , reignited global fears that chaos and corruption in the former Soviet_Union could spawn a plentiful supply of illicit uranium and plutonium that could end_up in the hands of terrorists or a hostile dictatorship . According to reports from Bonn , the Russian-German agreement calls_for greater intelligence swaps between the two countries on illegal nuclear materials and tougher control at the borders . It also proposes an international clearinghouse for information on nuclear smuggling . &quot; There is no bad without good , &quot; Stepashin said . &quot; This latest case has stimulated both agencies to move to concrete , operative work. &quot; Aware that confrontation would only make matters worse , both sides made_a_point of the cordial atmosphere of Schmidbauer ' s talks . But the friendliness appeared strained . Germany ' s finance_minister had said in remarks published over the weekend that continued economic aid -- Germany is Russia ' s largest donor -- would depend_on Russian efforts to stem nuclear smuggling . Meanwhile , Russian nuclear officials concentrated_on proving that the plutonium could not have originated_in their plants or laboratories . At the Kurchatov Atomic Energy Institute in Moscow , Russia ' s premier nuclear science center , the director for external affairs said an extensive check of supplies is under way . But , so far , the nuclear materials there &quot; have not decreased by even a gram. &quot; Russian television_showed the extensive security precautions taken at the institute , including a special gate that checks for traces of nuclear materials . But in the past , Russian officials have acknowledged that theft of atomic material is likely given the low salaries of most nuclear workers and the messy state of Russia ' s new borders . Plutonium is dangerous not only because it is a key ingredient of nuclear bombs but because it is so extremely toxic that even the tiniest grain can cause cancer . Security officials ' nightmares range from the prospect that states like Libya and Iraq could get an atomic_bomb to the possibility that terrorists could poison a whole city ' s water_supply with a_few pounds of plutonium . Schmidbauer did not provide his Russian hosts with samples of the plutonium seized in Munich ; he gave them only European scientists ' reports on its profile . But Russian experts continued to insist it did not appear to have been made here and that its quality indicates it came from a Western reactor . Some Russian officials believe the plutonium affair has been cooked_up to justify the imposition of international control on Russia ' s nuclear plants . Stepashin and Schmidbauer tried to take the emphasis off finger-pointing and said they devoted far more discussion to planning joint action . They accused the media of trying to depict a confrontation where one never existed .</TEXT>
