   <HEADLINE> OFFICIALS HOPE ARREST OF CARLOS SENDS MESSAGE ; MIDEAST : CAPTURE MAY HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON TERRORIST ACTS . BUT IT COULD PRESSURE NATIONS HARBORING EXTREMISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although the arrest of Carlos the Jackal is unlikely to affect international terrorism directly , American counterterrorism officials said Monday that they hope the capture of the infamous terrorist will send a message to extremists around the world . &quot; We hope they understand that the international community does not forget , &quot; a senior U.S. official said . &quot; However long it takes , they will be brought_to justice. &quot; Since the wave of anti-U.S. terrorist attacks in the 1980s , both Republican and Democratic administrations have more actively promoted law-and-order responses to terrorism , including new laws giving American agencies power to go beyond the nation ' s borders . But few foreign extremists actually have been caught or extradited for trial in the United States or other Western countries . Sudan ' s decision to turn Carlos over to France could be a boost to Western efforts to squeeze countries that harbor terrorist groups . It is unlikely , however , to remove a major player from the terrorism scene . &quot; This guy ' s been out of business since the early 1980s . He ' s a terrorist emeritus , &quot; a counterterrorism expert said . &quot; Despite his notoriety , he was probably credited with three times the number of operations he ever really undertook . There are contemporary terrorists who are of much more concern to us. &quot; Indeed , Israeli officials denied that Carlos played a role in several of the most notorious acts with which he is associated . The officials also refused to comment on speculation that Israel might ask France to extradite Carlos for trial in Israel . Shlomo Gazit , former head of Israeli military intelligence , said Monday that Carlos was not involved in either the 1972 Munich massacre of 11 Israeli athletes or the 1976 hijacking of an Air France plane to Entebbe , Uganda . American and Egyptian officials speculated Monday that Sudan , which has been_on the State_Department ' s terrorism list since August , 1993 , decided to hand Carlos over to France because the terrorist is now expendable and because of potential good publicity . Sudan has been an international outcast since shortly after the 1989 coup that brought_to power the hard-line Islamic government of Omar Bashir , primarily because of allegations that it supported international terrorism . Groups such_as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas have offices in Khartoum . Agents of Palestinian renegade Abu Nidal are said to have operated in the capital . The government has also repeatedly been accused , with little concrete evidence , of operating terrorist training camps , primarily for Sunni fundamentalist groups challenging governments in neighboring Algeria , Tunisia and especially Egypt . Sudan , cut_off almost entirely from international aid and going bankrupt in the process , has been eager to make amends with the West and get money flowing again . As a figure of the past , Carlos does not have strong ties with active movements , eliminating the danger of retaliation . &quot; This was a winner for the Sudanese , &quot; the U.S. official said . &quot; Carlos is not someone with ties . He ' s out of the old sectarian school that isn ' t terribly active now so no one is likely to complain that he ' s been turned_over . And they ' ll get good publicity which they can desperately use . So there ' s no down side. &quot; But while welcoming Sudan ' s decision , sources in Washington said the Khartoum government knew the action was not sufficient to win its removal from the American terrorist list . Counterterrorism officials said it is unclear whether Syria , which had played host to Carlos since he was expelled from Hungary in the late 1980s , had decided to kick him out . He was in Sudan for about six months , U.S. officials said . Because Syria has also been anxious to get_off the terrorist list , U.S. officials said they believe Damascus would have wanted credit for expelling Carlos . But in the context of revived U.S.-led peace efforts , the sources speculated , Syria may have made life difficult for Carlos to force him to leave . It was not the first time he left the country . Carlos reportedly went_to Yemen in the early 1990s . Libya is also believed to have turned him away in 1991 after a purported eviction from Damascus . He also reportedly obtained a passport for his second daughter from the Venezuelan Embassy in Beirut . But U.S. officials said they considered Syria his primary residence until recently . He probably went_to Sudan because there was nowhere else to go . Times staff writer Mary Curtius in Jerusalem contributed to this report .</TEXT>
