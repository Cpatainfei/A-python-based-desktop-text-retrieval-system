   <HEADLINE> AFRICA WATCH ; PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The White_House should send a special envoy such_as veteran diplomat Donald F . McHenry to Nigeria , Rwanda and Burundi . In Nigeria , McHenry , a professor at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , might persuade the stubborn generals to free unconditionally Moshood Abiola , the leader who should be president based on last year ' s annulled election.The illegal military government had offered to release him from jail , but only if he promised never to engage in politics again . Abiola refused . So did his supporters -- millions of oil workers , students and other Nigerians who demand democracy . If this bitter quarrel turns_to war , the populous West_African nation could suffer as_many as 1 million fatalities , double the body_count in Rwanda ' s civil_war . After Nigeria , McHenry should go_to Rwanda and Burundi , where he could encourage reconciliation between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority that dominates the governments and armies of both of the Central African_nations . There is now some hope in Rwanda . Representatives of the new , Tutsi-dominated government are reportedly holding talks with members of the defeated Hutu army . Neighboring Burundi is an ever-increasing worry . Tutsi youths , angered at the massacres of Tutsis who lived_in Rwanda , seek revenge , and the Tutsi government is cracking_down . The presence of a seasoned diplomat like Ambassador McHenry might help keep Burundi from exploding like Rwanda .</TEXT>
