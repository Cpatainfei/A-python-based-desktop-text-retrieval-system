   <HEADLINE> CANADA WATCH ; SEPARATION ' S HIGH COST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite the recent victory in Quebec ' s provincial parliamentary elections of the separatist Parti Quebecois , a referendum on secession could well find most Quebecers voting for continued federation with the rest of Canada . Here ' s why . Canada is a country on the international A-list -- one of the G-7 nations , the elite group of seven major industrialized powers , and a member of NATO . A nation that with some reason styles itself as a European state on North_American soil , Canada has played an influential , mediating role in international deliberations on security and economics . Because its relations with Mexico are so_much calmer than those of the United States , Canada has been particularly important as a balancing factor_in post-NAFTA North_America . But what if Quebec secedes ? Neither Quebec nor English Canada alone would be large enough for G-7 or NATO membership . As for NAFTA , neither Quebec nor English Canada could bargain from the kind of strength that federated Canada has enjoyed . In the end , that ' s why most Quebecers will choose federation . And that , clearly , is the outcome most Americans favor . English Canadians , resentful of the special cultural treatment Quebec has received , occasionally drift toward a huffy &quot; Who needs you anyway ? &quot; attitude . But Canada does need Quebec ; and if a measure of special treatment for French culture is the price of continued federation , English Canadians should find the will to pay it . For both Canadas , the cost of accommodation will be far lower , in the long_run , than the cost of separation .</TEXT>
