   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE STRESS EVEN RATTLES RATS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s OK if you think you ' ll never get used to earthquakes . It ' s natural to become unglued . Biological , even . At least , that inference might be drawn from the work of Natalie Alexander , a USC researcher who studies environmental stress . Alexander has subjected laboratory rats to simulated earthquakes to see how they react , and found that rats do not adapt to the shaking . They are just as stressed-out by their 100th earthquake as they were during the first . In three years of research , Alexander has also found that the rats ' stress increases with the speed of shaking . Some try to escape_from their cages . She measured the rats ' stress by looking_at changes in blood_pressure , heart_rate and the release of hormones and neurotransmitters into the blood , which are natural defense_mechanisms to stress . These studies may be applicable to humans , she says , because rats are mammals with cardiovascular and hormonal systems very similar to ours . SHARI ROAN</TEXT>
