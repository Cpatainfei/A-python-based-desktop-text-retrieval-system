   <HEADLINE> SECURITY LIES ONLY IN PEACE , RABIN SAYS ; ISRAEL : THE NATION HAS NO TOTAL DEFENSE AGAINST RADICALS , PRIME_MINISTER ACKNOWLEDGES . HE IMPLORES PEOPLE TO SUPPORT TALKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , while seeking to calm the nation after two terrorist bombings that have killed 12 Israelis , acknowledged Monday that Israel -- despite all its military might -- does not have a total defense against attacks by radical Palestinians opposed to Arab-Israeli peace negotiations . The lives of Israelis and Palestinians have become far too integrated to untangle , Rabin said , arguing that real security lies only in peace and imploring his people to remain with the peace process despite the bloodshed . &quot; We will probably not be able to prevent completely terrorist attacks , but peace will be victorious , &quot; Rabin told the Knesset , Israel ' s Parliament , as heckling from the opposition Likud Party and other right-wing members rose to a roar . Even with troop reinforcements along &quot; sovereign Israel ' s &quot; borders with the occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip , closing Israel to most Palestinians , Rabin warned that Israelis would continue to be targets for terrorist attacks by Muslim fundamentalists from the Islamic Resistance Movement , known as Hamas , and other radicals . &quot; Hundreds of thousands of Jews and Arabs , thousands of vehicles mix with each other every day , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; One population lives inside the other . There are many ways to cross from the ( occupied ) territories to Israel , fewer from the Gaza Strip , more from the West_Bank , some ways are known , others are secret . . . . The territories cannot be hermetically sealed. &quot; Benjamin Netanyahu , the Likud chairman , replied that since the government and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed the Declaration of Principles on Palestinian self-government , &quot; the pace of murder and terrorism has been multiplied by four. &quot; &quot; The government has failed in the central mission of every government in Israel -- to defend the life of every citizen , &quot; Netanyahu declared . &quot; That failure is a direct result of ( its ) policy. &quot; The debate came just two hours after another terrorist attack . A 17-year-old Palestinian from the Kalandiyeh refugee camp outside Jerusalem struck two Israelis with an ax while riding_on a bus headed toward the capital ' s northern suburbs , police said . An army sergeant_major shot and wounded the youth , who also had two firebombs , as well as three other Israeli passengers . Rafi Peled , Israel ' s police_commissioner , urged more public vigilance , especially on buses , after the latest attack . In two suicide attacks earlier this month , Hamas bombers killed 12 Israelis and wounded 73 people . Hamas said the bombings were in reprisal for a Jewish settler ' s massacre of about 30 Palestinians at a Hebron mosque in February . Warning that more attacks are probable , Rabin insisted that peace efforts must continue -- and he implied that the bloodshed will end only when Israel withdraws from the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank . &quot; For 27 years , we have ruled another people who do not want us to rule over them , &quot; he said . &quot; For 27 years , Palestinians in the territories get_up in the morning -- Palestinians who today number 1.8 million men and women -- and nurse their burning hatred for us as Israelis and as Jews , &quot; the prime_minister continued . &quot; Every single morning , they get_up to a difficult life , which is not exclusively but ( partially ) our fault . We cannot deny that continuing to rule over a_people foreign to us , who do not want us , has inflicted a painful price -- the price of never-ending conflict between us. &quot;</TEXT>
