   <HEADLINE> MAN CONVICTED OF ASSISTING IN SUICIDE GETS PROBATION ; COURT : JUDGE ALSO ORDERS ALEX COVENTRY , 44 , OF TUJUNGA TO PERFORM 500 HOURS OF COMMUNITY WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Tujunga man convicted of encouraging his despondent roommate to commit suicide was sentenced to four years probation Tuesday by a judge who called the episode a &quot; tragic case. &quot; Alex Coventry , 44 , who had been found guilty of violating California ' s rarely used , 121-year-old assisted suicide law , was also ordered by Van Nuys Superior_Court Judge Ronald S . Coen to perform 500 hours of community service . Coventry gave his roommate a loaded shotgun last July and told him to &quot; Just do it. &quot; &quot; I am convinced that even the most diligent of advocates for assisted suicide for purposes of mercy would condemn the actions of the defendant , &quot; Coen said at the sentencing proceedings . The judge made a &quot; strong recommendation &quot; that Coventry do his community service &quot; in the area of suicide prevention , &quot; such_as a suicide hot_line . Coventry was found guilty of the felony charge in the suicide of Leonard Medina , a 42-year-old unemployed man who shared a Tujunga apartment with Coventry and Linda McDowell , Coventry ' s live-in girlfriend . Medina and McDowell had been drinking heavily most of that day of the suicide . Medina , who had previously attempted to kill himself , was depressed over a number of issues , including an eviction notice the trio received for not paying the rent on their one-bedroom apartment , according to evidence presented at the trial . After Medina threatened to kill himself , Coventry handed him a shotgun and told him to &quot; Stop talking_about it , &quot; according to testimony . Coventry maintained that he had no idea his friend was serious about his threats to commit suicide but after the verdict members of the 10-man , two-woman jury said Coventry had the specific intent for Medina to kill himself . Otherwise , they said , he would have handed Medina an unloaded shotgun or called a crisis hot_line . Defense_attorney Kenneth P . Lezin on Tuesday said he &quot; strongly disagreed &quot; with the guilty verdict , suggesting the panel blurred the line between specific intent -- which was required for the felony conviction -- and acting in a negligent manner . &quot; However , the jury has certainly found that Mr. Coventry has criminal , in addition to moral , responsibility , &quot; Lezin said . Jurors also said they focused_on the facts of the case and state law , stating they saw no relationship between this matter and the controversy surrounding Michigan ' s Dr. Jack Kevorkian , the retired pathologist who has admitted helping 20 terminally ill patients end their lives . During the trial , prosecutors stressed that Coventry was not a medical professional and that Medina was only depressed , not terminally ill . Coventry faced a maximum sentence of three years in state_prison , but Deputy Dist . Atty . Andrew R . Flier asked only for &quot; some minimal jail time. &quot; &quot; I still think that his conduct was completely outrageous , &quot; the prosecutor said . &quot; At the bottom_line of this case , he did hand someone a loaded gun and that person is now dead -- even though that person was going_to kill himself anyway. &quot; The judge noted that Coventry had no criminal history . The defense_attorney said Coventry , a recovering alcoholic , has spent the past 140 days in a &quot; sober house &quot; and has been under a great_deal of stress because of the trial and related publicity . &quot; This was clearly situational and very unusual conduct in an unusual situation , &quot; Lezin said as he asked the judge for probation . &quot; Clearly this situation came_up due_to lifestyle and due_to his drinking as well as his companions he was with. &quot;</TEXT>
