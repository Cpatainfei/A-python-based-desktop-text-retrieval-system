   <HEADLINE> RIGHTIST GETS LANDSLIDE WIN IN EL_SALVADOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Right-wing politician Armando Calderon Sol won a landslide victory Sunday over a leftist coalition of former guerrillas to take the presidency and conclude El_Salvador ' s first postwar elections . In voting meant as a test of the country ' s troubled efforts to rebuild after 12 years of civil_war , Calderon Sol of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance , or Arena , was defeating leftist legislator Ruben Zamora by a 2-1 margin . The election was a runoff required when Calderon Sol fell just shy of an absolute_majority in voting on March 20 . Arena militants burst into celebration late Sunday , driving their cars through the streets of the capital , waving red , white and blue banners and singing their anthem , which pledges to make El_Salvador &quot; the tomb where the reds will end up. &quot; The elections pitted bitter enemies from the civil_war against each other and exposed the lingering hatreds that continue to polarize this country two years after U.N.-brokered accords brought a fragile peace . &quot; Our great challenge now is to consolidate the peace and to ensure the stability and governability of the country , &quot; Calderon Sol said in claiming victory at a nighttime news_conference held_in San Salvador ' s El Presidente Hotel . Minutes earlier , Zamora , flanked by the former commanders of the guerrilla front , conceded defeat . &quot; We have widely confirmed that we are the alternative force indispensable to making this country truly governable , &quot; Zamora said . With more_than 80 % of the vote counted , Calderon Sol had 68 % , with Zamora trailing at 32 % , the official Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced . Throughout the 1980s , the rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front , or FMLN , fought a series of U.S.-backed governments until exhaustion and the end of the Cold_War forced the two sides to agree to peace and an array of judicial and political reforms , many of which are still incomplete . The elections marked the FMLN ' s first foray_into civilian politics , after years of ridiculing and boycotting voting . &quot; With this election , a new chapter is being opened in the history of El_Salvador , a history marked by injustice , marginalization and much blood , a history that must be changed , &quot; Msgr . Gregorio Rosa Chavez , auxiliary archbishop of San Salvador , said in his weekly homily . The March election was plagued by allegations of fraud and serious irregularities that prevented more_than 100 # 000 people from voting , according to a newly revised estimate by U.N. election monitors . Officials made the runoff somewhat easier by establishing a larger_number of voting stations . Still , basic flaws -- such_as names omitted from registries -- remained and have led to calls_for a complete overhaul of an electoral_system that seems weighted against the uneducated and in favor of the status_quo . The FMLN complained that the irregularities cheated it out of several municipal and legislative posts ; Arena won control of the National Assembly and most of the country ' s mayoral offices . The lingering anger raises questions about future stability because some on the left say that if Calderon Sol does not work with them , they will respond with strikes and unrest . &quot; We will have a constant and permanent dialogue with all sectors and with the FMLN , now more_than ever since they . . . have won political space , &quot; Calderon Sol said after his victory . Earlier , tension between the two sides was evident moments before Calderon Sol cast his vote . As Arena militants chanted their traditional slogan , &quot; Fatherland , yes ! Communism , no ! &quot; FMLN supporters responded by shouting the name of Roman_Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero , whose 1980 assassination was ordered by the late founder of Arena , Roberto D ' Aubuisson , according to a U.N. report on war_crimes . Calderon Sol is said to represent a more hard-line faction of Arena than the man he will replace , President Alfredo Cristiani , who is barred from running_for reelection . Arena sources said Calderon Sol will probably turn_away from the technocrats Cristiani favored and instead choose a number of party militants to join the government . &quot; He will have a lot of political debts to pay_off , &quot; a European diplomat said . Calderon Sol has pledged to continue Cristiani ' s free-market economic_policies , placing emphasis on the lucrative privatization of public_utilities , while paying closer attention to long-neglected social areas such_as health and education . Arena ' s multimillion-dollar campaign was sophisticated and offered stability . Calderon Sol and his associates , ignoring their own violent history , portrayed the left as Communist terrorists who were exclusively responsible_for the war ' s death and destruction and who are incapable of governing . Zamora and the left also have to share the blame for their electoral defeat . Divided and disorganized , they overestimated their support in some areas and failed to calculate the level of resentment against them in other areas .</TEXT>
