   <HEADLINE> CONGRESS MAY PUSH THROUGH BARE-BONES HEALTH PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Senate ' s Democratic and Republican leaders said Sunday that they would try to get a pared-down health_care reform bill approved by Congress before adjournment for the November elections . &quot; It will clearly be less sweeping than I would prefer , but I think there ' s a lot that can be done that represents good progress in health_care in our country , &quot; Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) said on CBS-TV ' s &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) said a &quot; bare-bones &quot; package that would provide coverage to those with pre-existing conditions or those making job changes would have a chance of passage before the 103rd Congress quits for the year in early October . &quot; My view is that Republicans should not be perceived as -- and are not at this time -- a negative force in this debate , &quot; Dole said on the CBS program . He said the public would support only &quot; very targeted , modest reforms &quot; for now . Major health_care bills remain stalled in both the Senate and House because of a lack of consensus on how or whether to overhaul the nation ' s medical system . The stalemate is a major defeat for President Clinton ' s efforts to achieve comprehensive changes . Now , with only about four weeks remaining before Congress adjourns to allow lawmakers to campaign before the Nov . 8 midterm elections , major health_care legislation is dead for this year . Dole proposed that bipartisan leaders in both houses try to agree on a bill making relatively minor changes in health_insurance . &quot; There are about 20 areas where we have pretty complete agreement , &quot; Dole said without providing any details on a possible consensus approach . &quot; We may_not get_it done . . . but I ' m willing to try it. &quot; Mitchell , however , objected to Dole ' s proposal for a leadership-written health_care bill on grounds that it would give too_much power to four or five members of Congress to shape the outcome . Mitchell and Dole also were at loggerheads on another issue before lawmakers this month : ratification of a world trade agreement . Dole , who strongly backed the President on the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , said he wanted to delay a vote until 1995 on whether to ratify changes in the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Clinton has recommended congressional approval this year . &quot; We may be able to resolve it , but so far I haven ' t seen any ( budget ) numbers that would lead me to believe we are going_to pay_for it , &quot; Dole said , referring to revenue-raising provisions needed to offset the loss to the Treasury from lower tariffs provided by the GATT changes . Noting traditional Republican support for tariff reduction and trade-expanding measures , Mitchell said he was &quot; deeply disappointed &quot; by Dole ' s stand against ratifying the GATT agreement this year . &quot; I ' m going_to try very hard to get_it passed , &quot; Mitchell said . &quot; This is a good agreement for the United States . It will reduce tariffs in other countries for American goods by one-third , it will protect American intellectual-property rights , it will increase access for Americans who offer services in other countries , it will strongly enhance America ' s economic future. &quot;</TEXT>
