   <HEADLINE> 60 AND STILL STEALING SCENES ; SOPHIA LOREN BRINGS HEAT TO ALTMAN ' S ' READY TO WEAR. ' BUT BEING IN MOVIES ISN ' T THE FILM ICON ' S TOP PRIORITY -- FAMILY AND HER CHILDREN STILL COME FIRST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sophia Loren doesn ' t mean to not lie_about her age , exactly . Having been famously 15 when first discovered , and 44 heralded years of screen acting having healthily ensued since then by anyone ' s count , she explains , it ' s simply too late not to cop now . &quot; What can I do ? I started so young , that it ' s impossible. &quot; A chuckle . &quot; Why deny it ? &quot; Is the milestone just reached one she perhaps takes some pride in ? &quot; No , &quot; she says matter-of-factly . &quot; I ' m just surprised I am 60 . I ' m surprised ! &quot; she reiterates , voice pitching up at the emphasis . &quot; I didn ' t see the time go_by . I feel 12 , I feel 13 . . . and so , I ' m 60. &quot; Disbelief or denial is not limited to the actress ' s professedly arrested psyche , but can be presumed_to shortly extend_to audiences about to watch Loren more or less steal &quot; Ready to Wear , &quot; the Robert Altman-concocted mega-ensemble farce that opens Sunday . Here is a picture engendering controversy with nude models a-go-go , and featuring no less contemporary an icon than Julia Roberts as a lovable sex-aholic . And yet it ' s Loren -- in recent years , more visible wearing glasses than making_passes -- providing very nearly all_the smolder in_sight . The movie ' s most memorable scene , at least for film buffs , comes when Loren meets her long-lost lover , Marcello Mastroianni , for a tryst and does a striptease for him . Italian film enthusiasts will immediately recognize this as a re-creation of a similar scene between the oft-paired couple in &quot; Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow , &quot; a De Sica anthology comedy released three decades ago with the scent of scandal , thanks to said legendary scene . Altman is rarely one to deal in such direct homage or overt cinematic referencing , so it ' s not entirely surprising to learn that the specific concept for this diverting remake-within-a-film was not the director ' s . &quot; I think that in principle it was Bob ' s idea , &quot; says Loren , &quot; to have me and Marcello together in the film and to re-propose something that we had done before . But he didn ' t know what we would come_up with. &quot; The eureka moment in determining that she and Mastroianni would re-create the &quot; Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow &quot; scene came , she says , when she found the record she had stripped to in 1964 in her house . &quot; So I think : Should I bring it back to Bob and make him listen to it and talk_about the striptease that I did with Marcello such a long_time ago ? Because I was a little bit reluctant . It ' s a kind of prudeness , a kind of timidity ; we don ' t know how the public will accept it . But we would n ' t have done anything vulgar or too pushy or wrong , I don ' t think . So , just in the name of what we had done before , I said , ' I ' ll ask Marcello , we ' ll propose it and see what happens. ' He jumped_on the ceiling and bonked his head when he heard about it. &quot; As Altman recalls it : &quot; We were talking_about what kind of scenes to do with them , and I had that bedroom scene , and then I think one of them said , ' Oh , remember what we did_in &quot; Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow &quot; ? ' And it brought_back my memory , and I said , ' My God , let ' s just paraphrase that and do the same thing. ' I mean , people that haven ' t seen the other picture and don ' t make the connection , it doesn ' t hurt ' em , and the people that do , it ' s just a bonus. &quot; In &quot; Ready to Wear , &quot; as in the ' 64 film , the literally howl-inducing striptease for Mastroianni doesn ' t actually lead to consummation , although the cold shower of a punch_line is different this time . In any event , a certain chasteness even in the midst of sauciness is right in keeping with the career of Loren , who , now as then , declines to see herself as a sex symbol , and who seems to have a genuine reservedness beyond most actors ' protestations of shyness . On the front of the current Detour magazine , Loren is busting out from the cover in such decolletage-revealing decorative force that the casual browser might mistake her arresting image as lure for the Russ Meyer article also contained therein . This particular hearkening back to her ' 50s and ' 60s pinup days is , of course , a put-on : The real Loren , as we meet her in a Westwood hotel today , goes_a_long_way toward defining a cliche such_as &quot; the picture of elegance , &quot; in a tannish suit just lighter than her enviable , sun-burnished skin , modest in the extreme but for still nearly heart-stoppingly evidencing the gift of gam . &quot; Family values &quot; have been her focus -- really &quot; a fixation , &quot; even , she adds -- since the arrival of her two sons , Edoardo and Carlo Ponti Jr. , both in grad school now . &quot; My home is wherever I am with my family , with my children -- that ' s my home , anywhere with them &quot; is her answer when asked where she lives now ; that includes a residence outside of Los Angeles , where one son goes_to school , though she ' s said to maintain a Geneva home as her primary residence . &quot; If you want to have a family , absolute dedication should be your first thought ( so ) the children can really feel the roots . You have to concentrate_on your profession as a mother and really have to give all you have -- your time and anything -- to be able to succeed and be happy about your job . Which is the most difficult thing . Your children judge you ! &quot; * Is she aware of how other women might have related to her over the years , with empathy , as would seem to be the case given her success as something near a populist character actress in certain periods , or , perhaps , with envy , given her ideal-establishing beauty ? &quot; Not envy , &quot; she says emphatically . &quot; I think that I inspire kind of an admiration . But I can ' t explain to you why that is. &quot; Her tone is more genuinely quizzical than boastful . &quot; It ' s something very strange . Maybe for how I handled my life and when I was raising my children . Or the fact that I ' ve never gone_off the bridge in the sense that I changed my life , and I ' m going_on to other people. &quot; Loren has been married to producer Carlo Ponti since 1967 . &quot; I don ' t know , I have no idea . But I have always inspired respect , which is very nice. &quot; That admiration extended_to the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences in 1991 bestowing upon her an honorary lifetime achievement Oscar , citing her as &quot; one of the genuine treasures of world cinema. &quot; It wasn ' t even as if this were one of the Oscars ' occasional oversight consolation prizes , as Loren had already picked_up a standard-brand Oscar three decades before , for De Sica ' s &quot; Two Women. &quot; Some viewers might have assumed , provided the actress ' s near-complete lack of screen credits in the ' 80s , that the academy ' s was a retirement present of some sort . But , she assures , unlike , say , fellow honoree Audrey Hepburn , she never made any conscious decision to stay_away_from the movies -- nor did she , with family to raise , she hastens to add , fret unduly when she wasn ' t working . Her story is the same as most actresses , but with an Italian accent and more of a predilection for choosiness : A good movie is hard to find &quot; not only for women of my age , but also younger than me . Because I think that men write for men -- and they don ' t write for women. &quot;</TEXT>
