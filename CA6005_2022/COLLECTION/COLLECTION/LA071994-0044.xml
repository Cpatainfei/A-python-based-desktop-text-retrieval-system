   <HEADLINE> DOING BUSINESS ; HOLY ALLIANCE GETS A VENTURE FLOWING ; A CALIFORNIA ENTREPRENEUR AND A RUSSIAN ARCHBISHOP TEAM UP TO TAP SPRING_WATER FOR SALE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What ' s clear , comes_in a bottle and is one of the few Russian products that can compete on the world market ? No , it ' s not vodka , it ' s voda -- plain old water . So say the producers of Saint Springs , an upscale bottled spring_water whose source is an unorthodox joint_venture between a retired California plastics man and the Russian archbishop of Kostroma and Galich . Call it a holy alliance , call it a blessed business partnership . John V . R . King , the Lake Arrowhead entrepreneur who hopes to strike it rich selling Russian water , calls it a Russian business miracle . King , 58 , met Archbishop Alexander during a 1992 sightseeing cruise on the Volga_River . The young cleric was angling for money to rebuild the crumbling churches of his diocese , seated 200 miles northeast of Moscow in Kostroma . He gave King the time-worn Russian spiel to foreigners -- the old story of having unlimited resources and ideas , but just needing a shot of das kapital to bring it all together . At first King , 10 years into a comfortable retirement , was wary . &quot; Then he mentioned springs , &quot; King recalled . &quot; I didn ' t sleep at all that night. &quot; The dreams that kept King up have now sprung to life , with the help of what he says is a multimillion-dollar sum from 17 U.S. investors , many of them friends from Lake Arrowhead . Last month , 1.5-liter bottles from the factory -- the only plant in Russia to make PET plastic bottles except those of soft_drink giants Coca-Cola and Pepsico -- hit supermarket shelves and hotel bars in Moscow and St . Petersburg . King said that while the water meets or exceeds international standards , the bottle is Saint Springs ' prime selling point . Designed by a team headed by one of the investors , Napa Valley winery owner Neil Knott , the bottle has an onion-domed shape , and its costly clear-plastic label sports a drawing of an old wooden church and Archbishop Alexander ' s official seal . The bottle is made with the PET ( polyethylene terephthelate ) recycling process . Is it unholy for the church to be taking_part in such a venture ? Patriarch Alexi II , leader of the Russian Orthodox Church , apparently doesn ' t think so : He blessed the springs earlier this year , and in February promoted Alexander , 37 , from bishop to archbishop , making him the youngest of 40 Russian clergymen who hold the lofty rank . While King hopes to strike it rich , Archbishop Alexander said his motives are as pure as the water . It is unclear exactly how potential profits will be divided . King said the church &quot; will realize financial benefits in 1994. &quot; Alexander insisted that &quot; all profits &quot; from the venture will go_to rebuild the infrastructure of the Kostroma diocese , repairing the ravages that took_place under communism . The archbishop said the diocese -- population 850 # 000 -- had about 1 # 200 houses_of_worship before the 1917 revolution but emerged from more_than seven decades of official atheism with just 70 churches intact . By blessing the springs -- and the factory itself , as he will in the official ribbon-cutting ceremony Friday -- Alexi II lends spiritual support to an effort to carve out a niche for a Russian product in Western-dominated markets . But the Russian Orthodox Church has given Saint Springs more_than its blessing . King said the church has been &quot; the ideal partner , &quot; a skilled navigator on the murky waters of Russian business , where numbing bureaucracy and profit-gouging taxes lurk just beneath a surface solicitation of foreign investment . &quot; The church is in a position of growing power and influence in Russia , and they have been instrumental in getting this project where it has gotten , &quot; King said . &quot; Russian laws often contradict each other . When we needed to do something at_variance with the law , they were able to get an exception made. &quot; But King said there were fewer problems than he had expected , and the partners managed to get the plant up and running within budget , if not quite within the time frame he had originally set . King said he originally looked_for investment to the Overseas Private Investment Corp . and other U.S._government foundations that support entrepreneurial activity in Russia but decided to go it alone after running_into &quot; red_tape and delays worse than anything we ' ve seen in Russia. &quot; At first , King worried that the water ' s Russian origin would be a sales obstacle . A recent study by the Russian Environment Ministry found that a third of the country ' s 148 million citizens get sick every year from drinking_water tainted by pollution , dirty pipes and old purification facilities . But the question has rarely come_up with buyers . For Aeroflot , which will be serving Saint Springs_water exclusively on international_flights from Moscow ' s Sheremetyevo airport beginning Aug . 1 , the Russian factor is a positive one . &quot; We looked_at a lot of waters , and Saint Springs was the best , &quot; said Daniel Souders , domestic purchasing director for Aeromar , which caters most flights out of Moscow . &quot; No . 1 , the quality , and No . 2 -- it ' s Russian. &quot; King said Delta , the only U.S. airline with direct flights to Moscow and St . Petersburg , had expressed interest , and that New York ' s legendary Russian Tea Room had placed an order . Jari Ahde , the manager of alcohol and waters at a Moscow branch of the Finnish store Stockmann , was less gung-ho about sales . He said Saint Springs is competitively priced at $ 1.80 for 1.5 liters -- 55 cents less than Evian and a little more_than two Finnish brands -- but that it would take some time to erode customers ' loyalty to the Western brands they are used to . &quot; People have to understand that there can be a good water made here too , &quot; he said . King is confident that consumers will respond , and he is ready to expand . He said that by next winter , Saint Springs_water will begin flowing into U.S. markets with large Russian-speaking communities , such_as Los Angeles , San Francisco and New York .</TEXT>
