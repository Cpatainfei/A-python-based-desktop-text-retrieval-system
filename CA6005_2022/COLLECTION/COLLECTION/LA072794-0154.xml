   <HEADLINE> ROCKET BOOSTER ; MOON ASTRONAUT URGES RENEWED SPACE EXPLORATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Speaking in Simi Valley Tuesday , the last man to leave his footprints on the moon called_for a renewed emphasis on space exploration as a way to advance technology . &quot; We need to develop a national public awareness &quot; of the benefits of space research , said former astronaut Eugene A . Cernan , who walked on the moon as part of Apollo 17 ' s December , 1972 , voyage -- mankind ' s last lunar trip . &quot; The space_program has done a very poor job . . . of developing an identity. &quot; Addressing more_than 300 people at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum , Cernan said that discoveries yet to be made in space will further technology , thereby working indirectly to solve problems such_as homelessness , cancer , AIDS and heart_disease . The silver-haired , 60-year-old Cernan , who now lives_in Houston , Tex. , came_to the library in commemoration of last week ' s 25th anniversary of the first moon walk . In a 40-minute speech , he recounted in detail his own 12-day voyage to the moon with fellow astronauts Ronald E . Evans and Harrison H . Schmitt . Then , still standing on the library ' s auditorium stage , Cernan took questions from would-be future astronauts . &quot; Were you afraid ? &quot; asked John Fatollahi , 7 , of Newbury Park . &quot; Maybe my heart was beating a little fast , &quot; Cernan admitted . &quot; But I was glad to be there. &quot; The boy also wondered what would happen if the Earth was struck by a comet like the one that just hit Jupiter . &quot; I think that we would look_at the earthquake you guys experienced here as a very minor infraction , &quot; the astronaut replied . A priest from Santa Barbara wanted to know whether the moon landing made Cernan want to talk with God . &quot; I was inspired . I was convinced that there is a God , &quot; Cernan responded . The priest , Father Antonio Cacciapuoti of St . Raphael Church , said later that he has always been fascinated by astronauts . As a boy in 1969 in Naples , Italy , he recalled , he left a soccer game to run home and watch the first Americans walking on the moon . Space fan Mike Bliss , 51 , of Simi Valley , confessed that he harbored doubts about whether man actually had walked on the moon . He asked Cernan why photographs of the moon show different colors on the lunar surface . His skepticism was somewhat diminished , he said , by Cernan ' s explanation : &quot; On the moon you do see shades of gray , &quot; Cernan said , adding that solar_radiation causes changes in_color . Five-year-old Sam Rosenblum of Thousand Oaks stole the show with his question about how one goes_to the bathroom in space . An amused Cernan -- who said he had been asked the same question countless times -- told the boy that urine is dispensed into space , where it turns_to ice_crystals . Solid waste is kept_in bags that are stored in a pressurized compartment &quot; because for some reason doctors want to look_at it. &quot; The ideas of today ' s children will determine the direction of the space_program in coming decades , Cernan said .</TEXT>
