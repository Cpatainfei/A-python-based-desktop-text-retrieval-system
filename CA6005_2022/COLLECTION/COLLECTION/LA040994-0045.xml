   <TEXT> Usually the nerve_center of this cavernous warship is strictly a Navy affair . Naval officers and enlisted personnel bend over their radar screens , straining to keep tabs on nearby ships . They leave bombing to the Air_Force and ground-fighting to the Army . But on this deployment -- a special four-service training exercise off the North Carolina coast -- all that has changed . Besides the sailors , the ship ' s computer-filled air-control center is crammed with Army , Air_Force and Marine Corps officers . And the Mt . Whitney has become a command_post for coordinating everything from high-level bombing raids to tank and artillery attacks on a make-believe Third_World country . Such scenes are becoming common as the four armed_services , whose isolation and rivalries once were legendary , turn more to integrated operations as a key to survival in the post-Cold War world . Advocates say that &quot; jointness &quot; -- the Pentagon ' s catch-phrase for such interservice collaboration -- uses defense dollars more efficiently , improves the effectiveness of military operations and avoids some of the planning and communications gaffes that led to earlier fiascos such_as the attempt to rescue U.S. hostages from Iran in 1979 . Moreover , the concept has become deeply imbedded in today ' s military . &quot; It ' s the new way of doing business , &quot; says Capt . Tom Scolarici , a 33-year-old Air_Force tanker pilot who is serving as fuel-delivery coordinator aboard the Mt . Whitney . &quot; We ' re all working as part of a team. &quot; Don Snider , a former Army colonel now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , agrees . &quot; The military is much more joint than it was even a_few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s becoming deeply accepted by officers at all ranks. &quot; The evolution includes these developments : * The Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , once merely a forum for the heads of the four services , now runs the entire military . Its chairman , who is the principal military adviser to the President , may present his own views without reflecting those of individual services . * The Pentagon ' s Joint Staff , which hammers_out doctrine for all four services , has evolved into the most influential staff organization in the military . Including the Joint Staff , there are 9 # 100 joint billets throughout the military and no officer can make general or admiral without serving in one . * Joint doctrine -- how to operate in conjunction with other services -- is part of the curriculum at all_the military and naval command and staff colleges . And the services are working together to develop aircraft , missiles and other weapons . * More_than ever , the military is organized into joint commands , in which elements of all four services take orders from a single admiral or general . And almost every major combat action is a joint operation . Just last summer , the Pentagon established a joint U.S. Atlantic Command , designed to train , package and deploy U.S.-based forces from all services for overseas operations including Somalia and Bosnia . Adm . Paul David Miller , who is in_charge of the operation , has already proposed restructuring U.S. military_forces overseas using &quot; adaptive joint force packaging &quot; -- in which units from all services are assigned to joint task_forces to be ready for action at any time . The change has been dramatic . Former Secretary_of_Defense Les Aspin , who served in the Defense_Department in the 1960s as one of then-Secretary Robert S . McNamara ' s whiz kids , says that jointness has significantly improved the quality of the Pentagon ' s military staff . &quot; It used to be that all_the hot-shots from the services never went_into a joint assignment because it was looked ( upon ) as a sidetrack , &quot; Aspin says . But today &quot; the quality of people on the Joint Staff is a lot higher now than it was . . . . ( It ' s ) a very impressive pool. &quot; Military experts say that the change has come for several reasons : * Army Col . C . Kenneth Allard , a strategist at the National War College , says that the advent of sophisticated technology &quot; has speeded_up the pace of combat operations and blurred the differences among the individual services. &quot; An example : The new J-Stars aerial reconnaissance system uses an Air_Force plane equipped with state-of-the-art electronics to pinpoint enemy vehicles and armor for Army ground troops and Navy ships . All three services must know the others ' needs and use compatible gear . * Budget_cuts and force reductions are prodding each of the services to share its workload , rather than using large parts of its budget to perform tasks that the other services can do . * Congress has been explicitly pressuring the services toward more jointness . It passed legislation in 1986 elevating the chairman of the Joint Chiefs to be the de_facto head of the entire military . The trend has intensified steadily . * Finally , lessons learned from previous snafus have prompted the services to make their operations more compatible . During the Vietnam_War , Navy and Air_Force warplanes often crossed signals -- and complicated entire operations -- because they were under separate commands that acted autonomously . Desert One , former President Jimmy_Carter ' s disastrous effort in 1979 to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran , failed largely because the equipment , doctrine and training that each of the four services used were not compatible . Marine helicopter pilots were not accustomed to working with Army special forces hostage-rescue teams . And the refusal of the services to combine the operation left important gaps in planning that doomed the venture . During the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983 , Army and Marine ground forces were under separate commands and used different communication_equipment so were were unable to communicate with each other . That led to delays -- and excessive U.S. casualties . &quot; If there ' d been real opposition , we ' d have had a disaster , &quot; one officer says . And during the Persian_Gulf_War in 1992 , the Navy found that its computers and communications_equipment were not compatible with those used by the Air_Force , effectively preventing its aircraft_carriers from receiving daily air tasking orders . As a result , the elaborate daily air operations plan , drawn_up by the Air_Force each day and distributed to the other services , had to be flown to Navy aircraft_carriers by special messenger plane -- at considerable effort and delay . &quot; The Desert One debacle really blew_up in our faces , &quot; says Robert W . Gaskin , a former Air_Force strategist . Special operations for all four services now are under a single command . Military_personnel in joint billets now even have their own nickname . They are called &quot; purple-suiters &quot; -- an allusion to a mix of Army and Marine Corps green and Air_Force and Navy_blue . ( Fortunately , one officer says , no one actually has to wear a purple uniform. ) Even so , the push toward more cooperation has not been easy . To begin with , each of the services is deeply imbued with its own cultural mores . In the Navy , for example , a ship captain has far more autonomy than his Air_Force or Army counterparts . And strategists say that the armed_services need to retain some of their interservice rivalry to help build spirit and morale . &quot; To a certain degree , you want to instill that , &quot; says retired Adm . David Jeremiah , former vice_chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff . Just how far the services have come can be seen in one of the joint training exercises for which the Mt . Whitney serves as floating command headquarters . The situation : A Third_World government has been toppled , and the local capital is in chaos . The U.S. military ' s mission is to secure the city and restore the rightfully elected administration to power . As the operation begins , heavily camouflaged soldiers from the Army ' s joint special-operations task_force scout the potential battlefield . Three days later , B-52s from the 12th Air_Force make long-range bombing_runs to soften up enemy positions . The next day , members of the 75th Ranger Regiment from Ft . Benning , Ga. , launch a parachute assault to seize the country ' s major airport and seaport , followed 30 minutes later by the 18th Airborne Corps from Ft . Bragg , N.C. At the same time , infantrymen from the 28th Marine Expeditionary Unit make an amphibious landing on nearby &quot; Blue Beach &quot; -- actually a neighboring island . Over the next three days , the Army and Marines link up in a joint assault and evacuate key civilians . In all , about 20 # 500 soldiers , sailors , Air_Force personnel and Marines take_part -- along with about 400 aircraft , 17 ships and dozens of tanks and armored vehicles . The Mt . Whitney carries three Navy admirals and four generals -- two Army , one Air_Force and one Marine . Vice Adm . William J . Flanagan Jr. , who served as commander of Joint Task_Force 140 , which conducted the operation , says that exercises such_as this are rapidly becoming standard . &quot; The key is in putting packages together that make_sense , &quot; he says . Air_Force Col . David Hall , a 45-year-old B-1 bomber pilot now on his third such exercise aboard the Mt . Whitney , says that joint operations give members of one service a keener appreciation of the problems and capabilities of the others -- a must for combat operations . The Air_Force and Navy , for example , have had to overcome differences in everything from doctrine to operating_procedures . Even the acronyms -- the alphabet-soup of names given to organizational divisions and nomenclature -- are different . &quot; It takes about two days to get that common language down and trust each other , &quot; Hall concedes . Gaskin , a major force behind the entry of the Air_Force into joint operations , recalls commanding a joint military operation in which he was searching for ways to mark infantry positions for air support when a Marine volunteered that his unit would be able to do_it from the ground . &quot; I ' d never imagined they had that capability , &quot; says Gaskin , who is now a vice_president of Business_Executives for National Security , a research group . Even so , jointness has its limits . Except for the joint exercises and a_few of the more senior billets , the individual armed_services undertake day-to-day training and exercises largely on_their_own . Despite the cooperation at the top , interservice rivalry remains alive as the services vie ever more intensely for declining defense dollars . &quot; There ' s no love lost among us at budget time , &quot; one top admiral concedes . And the U.S. military still is a long way from the total unification that Canada tried in the 1970s , when it essentially combined its armed_services under a single command and rank structure and a single ( forest green ) uniform . Experts say that Canada ' s experiment fizzled because it undermined the specialization that had been the core of each service ' s effectiveness and because it shattered the professional cohesion that had kept esprit de corps high . The move was abandoned in 1979 . Still , there are those who object that U.S.-style jointness has already gone too far . Some officers argue that the hours spent on jointness come_out of the time that each service has to train and equip for its own individual mission . They also warn that taking_on some of the role traditionally played by another service can give a unit a false_belief that it can do that service ' s job as well . &quot; People can get the impression that they can do things that they really aren ' t prepared_for , &quot; one critic says . Indeed , the Atlantic Command ' s experiment with &quot; adaptive force packages &quot; ran_into trouble earlier this year as battle_groups carefully deployed with the precise mix of personnel and equipment to handle one set of problems found themselves ill-prepared to deal with others . Many military planners say that such difficulties are all part of the growing pains that inevitably occur when any new concept is tried . And those who have had the opportunity to serve in a joint billet seem to emerge convinced that &quot; jointness &quot; is worthwhile and probably the way of the future for the post-Cold War military . Military analysts say that jointness is only at about a third of its full potential . There is room for more joint staffing and more interservice expertise about other services . Gaskin , for one , believes that much will depend_on the military ' s new role after the Cold_War . If future operations turn_out to involve mainly regional conflicts , as is expected , &quot; jointness &quot; will spread . The concept may also be propelled by the growing pressure to revamp the roles and missions assigned to the individual services to help eliminate duplication and eventually save money . The services are already gearing_up to merge their basic flight-training schools into a single operation , and they are studying other ways to consolidate operations . Last month , a new , independent commission began looking_for more ways that the services can pool their resources . Meanwhile , Air_Force Capt . Brent Baysinger , a 27-year-old B-1 bomber pilot -- is learning more about the Navy than he cares to . Like many of the officers visiting from other services ( and like some naval personnel as well ) , he got seasick when the Mt . Whitney left port .</TEXT>
