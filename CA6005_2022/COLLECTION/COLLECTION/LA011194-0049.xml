   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; SOUTH_AFRICANS MAKE WAVES OVER MINE PLAN ; 300 # 000 HAVE SIGNED PETITIONS TO PROTECT WETLANDS , ENERGIZING THE NATION ' S TINY ' GREEN ' MOVEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The provincial parks board offers the following words of warning about some of the residents here in one of Africa ' s largest and most diverse estuaries . In a pamphlet titled &quot; How Not to Be Eaten by a Crocodile , &quot; for example , is this helpful hint : &quot; Do NOT paddle , swim or play about in rivers or other areas where there are likely to be crocodiles. &quot; And if confronted by a hippopotamus , be prepared to make &quot; an instant decision. &quot; Either stand perfectly still or run as fast as you can . &quot; Alternatively get_up or behind a tree -- not a bush or a sapling , but a tree. &quot; Hippos , it turns_out , kill more tourists in Africa than lions . Aside from hundreds of hippos and countless crocs , St . Lucia Park and Game Reserve is crowded with vast flocks of pelicans , flamingos , eagles and 483 other species of birds . Most feed_on fish -- some found nowhere else -- that teem_in a shallow , 25-mile-long brackish lake . Endangered black rhinos , leopards , wildebeests , zebras and other large game roam in rolling hills covered in acacia and thornbush . There are 47 species of frogs alone in the meandering rivers and swamps that drain into the Indian_Ocean . The surf , in turn , crashes over a rich coral_reef onto mile after mile of deserted golden sand beaches crowned by towering dunes , some hundreds of feet high . St . Lucia , about 150 miles north of Durban on South_Africa ' s eastern coast , is one of the nation ' s largest , oldest and most popular conservation areas . It is even a candidate for designation by UNESCO as a World Heritage site , which guarantees international recognition and protection . But the St . Lucia wetlands are also the focus of one of South_Africa ' s biggest and most bitter environmental controversies . Over the last four years , more_than 300 # 000 people have signed petitions to oppose plans by Richards Bay Minerals , a multinational mining_company , to dig_up about 10 miles of coastal dunes inside the park to extract titanium_oxide slag , a material used in paints and other pigments . The dispute probably won ' t be settled until a new national government is elected in April and decides whether to issue a mining permit . But St . Lucia has already produced one obvious winner : It has energized the country ' s tiny environmental movement and sparked one of the first mass protests among South_African whites . &quot; Mining has been king here , and the environment has been way , way down the line , &quot; said David Lindley , conservation ecologist at the Wildlife Society of Southern Africa . He cites his group as an example : The Sierra Club clone has only 20 # 000 members -- but is South_Africa ' s largest conservation group by far . &quot; We are probably 20 , 25 years behind the states and 15 years behind Europe as far as environmental law is concerned and as far as environmental opposition is concerned , &quot; Lindley said . But the furor over St . Lucia may change that , he said . &quot; Never before has an environmental issue gotten so_much public support . It has set a precedent for future environmental problems in this country. &quot; If so , the precedent is a disaster , insists Barry N . Clements , a well-known conservationist and former park ranger who was hired by Richards Bay Minerals , or RBM , to repair what has become a public relations nightmare . &quot; This is the greatest hoax that has ever been perpetrated in the history of conservation , &quot; Clements complained . He blamed &quot; a green left_wing who are opposed to any development whatsoever &quot; and a mining_company totally unused_to considering public_opinion . &quot; These headlines are normally used for world_wars , &quot; he said with evident disgust as he pointed_out some of the local media coverage . In his view , environmentalists and reporters have misrepresented the facts . The 3 # 500 acres that RBM wants to mine are no &quot; ecological wilderness , &quot; he said . More_than half the area is covered by dense government-owned commercial pine forests that will be logged whether the dunes are mined or not , he said . Nor is the rest of St . Lucia pristine . Early settlers slaughtered so_much game that several species became extinct . Rivers have been diverted , swamps drained and dams built to make_way for vast sugar_cane and pine plantations . The lake is choking with topsoil from overgrazing and poor farming practices . Until recently , there was even a military missile testing range nearby . So RBM wants to use massive floating dredgers to suck_up 30 feet per day of coastal dunes for the next 17 years . After valuable minerals are extracted and pumped away in a buried pipeline , the company says , the sand will be spit back_out so the dunes can be rebuilt , covered with topsoil and replanted . Clements said most park visitors will &quot; hardly know &quot; a huge mining operation is under way and that the replanted dunes someday will appear identical to the natural ones . But he concedes that could take decades . &quot; There ' s no way we can leave ( the area ) as_good_as it was , &quot; he said . &quot; Mining is dirty , dangerous and destructive. &quot; RBM , which is half owned by the South Africa-based Gencor and half by the London-based Rio Tinto Zinc , is the world ' s largest supplier of titanium slag . The company operates dredging and smelter plants for 42 miles up and down South_Africa ' s Natal coast , processing 3 # 000 tons of sand an hour and producing 1 million tons of slag a year . And that ' s the problem : They are running_out of sand to mine . Adding the St . Lucia dunes would add five years to the company ' s local reserves -- and hundreds of millions of dollars to company coffers and the country ' s economy . &quot; I would find it lunacy not to mine here in a cash-strapped South_Africa , &quot; Clements said angrily . But Ricky Taylor , chief estuary ecologist with the Natal Parks Board , which administers the area , says St . Lucia &quot; is priceless and irreplaceable , &quot; while titanium slag mining is neither . And he doesn ' t buy Clements ' claim that the vegetated dunes , supposedly the world ' s highest , won ' t be damaged . &quot; There ' s absolutely no proof that the rehabilitation process would be successful , &quot; said Taylor , who has been a leader in the anti-mining fight . He laughs_at Clements ' claim that visitors won ' t see the mining . &quot; You ' ll be able to see it from large portions of the lake. &quot; * Taylor , a lanky bearded man in shorts and knee socks , warns that the rest of Africa is watching to see how the continent ' s richest country regards its critical natural habitats . &quot; If the precedent is set here for mining in conservation areas , the rest of Africa will follow , &quot; he said . For now , the odds appear to be against the company . After months of often acrimonious hearings , a five-member official review panel unanimously voted_in December to recommend that the government reject the mining license . The recommendation is not binding , but it does carry considerable weight . &quot; Because of its special value , St . Lucia is too precious to risk , &quot; the 142-page report said . The mining , it added , &quot; would cause unacceptable damage to a place which is special because of its rich history , ecology and biological diversity. &quot; But the panel also recommended that the government help St . Lucia ' s original inhabitants . Several thousand subsistence farmers once lived_on the narrow strip of land that separates the huge lake from the open ocean . But over the decades , the white government forcibly evicted these black residents , with little or no compensation , to create the game reserve and pine plantations . &quot; If there is no restitution for what the original inhabitants lost because of apartheid , St . Lucia would effectively be a special place for only the elite to enjoy , &quot; the report said . But it rejected a suggestion that the displaced families be returned to the area .</TEXT>
