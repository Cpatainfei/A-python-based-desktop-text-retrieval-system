   <HEADLINE> SIZE AT HEART OF AIRPORT DEBATE ; BURBANK : NEIGHBORS AGREE THAT THE TERMINAL MUST BE REPLACED TO COMPLY WITH FAA RULES . BUT THEY OBJECT TO MAKING IT FOUR TIMES LARGER THAN THE CURRENT FACILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This much can be agreed upon : The aging terminal at Burbank Airport must be replaced to comply with orders from the Federal Aviation Administration . But should it be expanded to more_than four times its present size ? That question is at the center of a simmering debate that has pitted airport officials against vocal opponents of the plan . The Burbank Airport has gained popularity in recent years as a more convenient alternative to Los Angeles International Airport , thanks largely to low-fare carriers such_as Southwest Airlines . Operating revenues for the 1994-95 fiscal_year are projected to be $ 56.4 million , more_than double those of the past two years . Airport officials say they must act to accommodate the 10 million passengers expected to fly in and out_in the year 2010 . But some residents contend that steps are being taken_to build a regional -- and perhaps international -- airport larger than many of them ever imagined . Today the two sides will gather for a town_hall meeting that is sure to be charged . At the last such gathering , some Burbank residents complained that the president of the airport ' s governing board , Brian Bowman , talked so_much that not enough public comment was heard . &quot; A lot of times , there are walls built_up artificially high that prevent proper dialogue , &quot; said Chris Holden , a Burbank Airport commissioner . &quot; The two have to coexist , and the two can coexist. &quot; Yet neither side seems willing to budge . The airport ' s present 163 # 000-square-foot terminal lies just 312 feet from the runway , but must be 750 feet away to comply with FAA safety regulations . Airport officials hope to build a $ 185-million terminal just north of the present one , on 120 acres of land once used by the Lockheed Corp . to build military aircraft . But three underlying factors hinder plans for the 670 # 000-square-foot facility that is supposed to be completed in two phases by the year 2010 : * Lockheed ' s efforts to clean_up contaminated soil in Burbank have been slow , and it is not clear how much longer work_on the 120 acres will take . * A Superior_Court judge in January ordered airport officials to re-examine the potential for noise , traffic and air_pollution that a new terminal might bring . The city of Los Angeles had sued the Airport Authority , charging that the board failed to properly study those issues . Until the case comes_before the judge again on Sept . 23 , airport officials are prevented from purchasing land related to the terminal expansion , among other things , said Los Angeles Deputy City Atty . Keith Pritsker . * Funding for the terminal expansion has not been found , but airport officials said they expect it will come from bond issues and federal grants . Yet public support for the project has been all but silent , with the loudest voices belonging_to opponents . &quot; We ' ve never said we ' re anti-airport . We ' re anti-big airport , &quot; said Jim Gordon , co-founder of the Burbank Flatlanders Home Protection League , a homeowners ' group with about 200 members . &quot; Whatever gains they make , they will have to fight for , &quot; he added . &quot; They want the moon and we ' re willing to give them a little chunk of it. &quot; What airport Executive_Director Tom Greer wants is for more people to recognize the economic benefits that the 435-acre facility brings now , including 38 # 000 jobs directly and indirectly related to operations . &quot; The airport , &quot; he said , &quot; can be the single most significant factor_in continuing the economic revitalization of this area . &quot; We will never see , out of Burbank , an international_flight to Japan or Australia or Europe . However , with NAFTA ( North_America Free_Trade Agreement ) it is quite possible we ' ll see service into Mexico or Canada . . . . When we say we ' ll never be international , we ' ll never be transoceanic. &quot; A critical question in the debate over the airport ' s future is how to define the role of the Airport Authority , the nine-member board in_charge of operations . Is it answerable to the public because the board ' s commissioners are appointed by council_members in Burbank , Glendale and Pasadena ? Or is it an independent , separate legal entity , accountable only for its success in its mission to provide state-of-the-art regional airport facilities ? Or both ? Airport commissioners themselves disagree on the answer . &quot; It is without question a governmental agency with lots of constituents , &quot; said board president Bowman . But Commissioner Holden , who is also a Pasadena councilman , said : &quot; It ' s quasi-governmental , with a leaning toward business. &quot; &quot; There ' s a sense_of_duty to provide information to the community , &quot; he said . &quot; But it is a business so we need to be mindful that the priorities set for the business will help the business flourish. &quot; Opponents of the terminal expansion suspect that making money is all_the Airport Authority has_in_mind . They claim Robert Garcin , a commissioner and until recently the board president , is aloof to their concerns and that the authority ' s regular monthly meetings are purposely held Monday mornings so as_to limit the amount of public input . &quot; The authority acts_as though it ' s running Vatican_City . Their policy is to plunge ahead , &quot; said R.C. &quot; Chappy &quot; Czapiewski an aviation buff who regularly attends the meetings . &quot; It ' s the Garcin attitude of damn the torpedoes , full speed ahead . &quot; The airport commission is absolutely determined to have its way , and damn the people . What ' s different now is more people are more aware of what the Airport Authority is and how it operates , &quot; Czapiewski said . Strangely enough , the issue of expansion at the Burbank Airport was a hot topic even before the Airport Authority purchased the facility from Lockheed Aircraft Co . in 1978 , with the help of taxpayers ' money . In 1975 , neighbors of the airport accused Burbank city officials of scheming to acquire the facility for the sake of expanding its operations . Soon after , the City_Council passed a resolution prohibiting expansion without a strong plan for minimizing increased noise and pollution . That seemed to satisfy Burbank residents . The following year , residents in Burbank , Glendale and Pasadena voted overwhelmingly to approve the purchase . A joint powers agreement among those cities creating the Airport Authority prohibited runway expansion and required that the airport take steps to mitigate noise . Plans for the new terminal call_for nearly twice as_many aircraft gates as there are now , and almost double the number of flights . But airport officials insist that quieter commercial airplanes will be used to take_off and land . Debate over the proposal has spilled into Burbank City_Council meetings , where a question about conflict_of_interest has swirled around two councilmen who are also airport commissioners .</TEXT>
