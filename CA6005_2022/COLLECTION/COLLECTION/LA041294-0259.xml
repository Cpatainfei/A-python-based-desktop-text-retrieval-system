   <HEADLINE> BROCCOLI HELPS FIGHT CANCER , RESEARCHERS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Broccoli contains substances that can block or retard formation of breast tumors in rats by promoting anti-cancer enzymes , medical researchers at Johns Hopkins University report . In a study to be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today , the scientists said doses of compounds that are found in broccoli and in some_other vegetables provided cancer protection for a group of rats that had been exposed to powerful cancer-causing chemicals . Dr. Paul Talalay , a Hopkins researcher who is co-author of the study , said Monday that sulforaphane and some related compounds are apparently able to amplify the body ' s own defenses against chemicals that can lead to cancer . &quot; Most cancer-causing chemicals are themselves innocuous until they enter cells where they are converted to enzymes which are highly reactive and are capable of initiating tumor formation , &quot; said Talalay . Sulforaphane and its chemical cousins , he said , cause the body to produce another type of enzyme that blocks the cancer-causing action of the first enzyme . In the study , Talalay and his colleagues exposed 145 rats to DMBA , a powerful cancer-causing chemical . Twenty-five of the rats were used as controls and received no drug treatment . At the end of 50 days , 68 % of the control rats had developed mammary tumors , but only about 26 % of those receiving high doses of sulforaphane developed cancer . Similar results were found for a related substance , called compound 2 . Other related compounds were effective to a lesser degree . Talalay emphasized that the vegetable compound seems to work only as a cancer preventer and has no effect on tumors that have already started .</TEXT>
