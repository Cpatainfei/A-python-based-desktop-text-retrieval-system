   <HEADLINE> CITIES JOIN FORCES TO TACKLE COMMON PROBLEMS WHILE CUTTING COSTS ; GOVERNMENT : COALITION SEEKS TO GIVE COMMUNITIES MORE CLOUT AND ACCESS TO FUNDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The borders marking city_limits in Southeast Los Angeles County symbolize municipal pride , independence and a sense of friendly competition to residents . But some of those boundaries are beginning to blur as leaders of eight cities in the region increasingly cooperate to attack nagging social and economic problems . The concept of regional collaboration -- combining the resources of individual cities to address common concerns , cut costs and improve service to residents -- has been proposed in the region for years , but little has come of it . Now , inspired partly by the sluggish economy and years of budget_cuts , the eight cities are seeking new joint methods to bring jobs , education , transportation and safety to the area ' s estimated 370 # 000 residents . Their efforts follow a national trend , experts say , and may be more comprehensive than most . &quot; ( Regionalization ) is the thing of the future , &quot; Huntington Park Councilman Raul Perez said . &quot; It has to be . We have to pool our resources if we ' re going to survive. &quot; That cooperative spirit has evolved out of the admission that although the cities may promote their individualism , their problems -- and their futures -- are inextricably linked . More_than 1 # 500 jobs have been lost in the last year as industry continues to trickle out of the region , analysts say . Most of the cities have adopted a utility-users tax to stabilize budgets rocked by the loss of state funding during recent budget_cuts . Compounding the problems are population density , below-average education levels -- up_to 70 % of the adults in the area do not have high_school diplomas -- and high unemployment , which hovers around 10 % , according to a report compiled by the office of Assemblywoman Martha M . Escutia ( D-Huntington Park ) . Under Escutia ' s leadership , the cities formed the Southeast Community Development Corp . last spring . The coalition unites Bell , Bell Gardens , Commerce , Cudahy , Huntington Park , Maywood , South Gate and Vernon under a nonprofit umbrella , which leaders hope will give the area more clout with government_agencies and funding sources that would not ordinarily fund city programs . One of the corporation ' s first proposals is to create a trolley system using alternative-fuel vehicles to feed into the Blue Line and Metrolink systems . Under the $ 500 # 000 plan , individual cities would pool unused funds from the Air Quality Management District and apply to the AQMD for matching funds to pay_for the project . The AQMD collects money from motor_vehicle registration fees and distributes a percentage to cities to be used for local transportation projects . Because each city ' s share is based on population , an individual municipality may_not have enough money to fund its own project . &quot; Commerce ( with about 12 # 000 residents ) only gets $ 13 # 000 a year based on population , &quot; said Ira Gwin , the city ' s director of community development . &quot; that ' s nothing . But if we can pool that together with other cities , that makes_sense . that ' s what we want. &quot; The corporation is also waiting to hear whether it will be designated a federal enterprise_zone and has submitted an application to the Department of Housing and Urban Development for up_to $ 1 million in tax_credits for employers , said Dolores Sanchez , Escutia ' s spokeswoman . The type of cooperation seen in Southeast Los Angeles County is part of a growing trend , said Jeff Fletcher , spokesman for the National League of Cities , an organization representing 1 # 450 cities . &quot; Most of the forward-looking communities realize that their future economic and social stability depends_on the region as_a_whole , &quot; Fletcher said . Another cooperative effort among seven Southeast cities began in October with an agreement to fund a satellite campus for East Los Angeles College in Huntington Park . The cities allocated $ 24 # 000 each to help set_up the program . Had Huntington Park been asked to foot the $ 150 # 000 bill on its own , the project would have failed , officials have said . In a separate venture also launched last year , Bell , Maywood , South Gate and Huntington Park formed the Metro Gang Task_Force to track the dozens of gangs in the area , where 45 % of all crime is believed to be gang-related . Now , Perez , of Huntington Park , is proposing that five of the cities , which are served by 12 separate water districts , re-evaluate their programs with an eye toward combining water services . Although the cities ' many similarities have helped persuade leaders to collaborate , officials say that cooperation has its limits . Maywood City_Manager Ron Lindsey recalled how Maywood voters soundly rejected a 1976 ballot measure to merge their city with Bell and said residents are still skeptical when talk turns_to regionalization . &quot; People are real protective of their small_town and worry about ( the town ) losing ( its ) identity , &quot; Lindsey said . Others worry that combining efforts could erode the personal service that smaller cities provide , Bell City_Manager Robert Rizzo said . Getting seven or eight political entities to agree on larger issues may require the same diplomacy it took_to form the European Economic Community , quipped one city official . But Escutia remains optimistic . &quot; It requires a different mind-set , &quot; Escutia said of the regional approach . &quot; You can ' t be parochial. &quot;</TEXT>
