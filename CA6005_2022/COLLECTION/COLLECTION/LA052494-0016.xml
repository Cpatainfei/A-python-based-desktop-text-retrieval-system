   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW / ESSAYS ; A FLUID VOYAGE OF CRYSTAL BLUE PERSUASION ; ON WATER BY THOMAS FARBER ; ECCO , $ 20 , 183 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I n the deep blue off Diamond Head , running downwind before the howling trades , kayak all too eager to pitchpole , to broach . The waves , also wind-inspired , giving chase . A following sea . These three sentences form an entire chapter in &quot; On Water , &quot; Thomas Farber ' s collection of ruminations on his chosen element . It is a book to read instead of actually being in the water , not to gain information about the ocean or about Farber ' s life . To read it on the beach would be redundant . &quot; Reading water . . , &quot; Farber writes , and then drifts_off , just like that . Then he quotes Italo Calvino , then Pablo Neruda , then a fellow surfer . &quot; Eh ? &quot; you yell back across your board , bobbing in the surf off the coast of Hawaii , the South Pacific or California . He needn ' t finish that thought , he ' s moved_on to another : &quot; It may be necessary , &quot; he yells back , quoting Lyall Watson , &quot; to think_of water as an organism in its own_right . . . . &quot; A riot of parentheses , Walt Whitman comes_to_mind and leaves . . . &quot; Out so_long , &quot; writes Farber , &quot; one ( almost ) forgets to come in. &quot; You feel a little chilly . The waves have taken him over completely . Farber writes in a cycle of lulls and sets , and thinks in a tidal pattern . This collection of ruminations on water is only the second time I have read an author who seems to have become the natural element he writes_about . ( The first time was reading Charles Bowden ' s &quot; The Sonoran Desert , &quot; in which he seems to fold himself into the desert , embodying all its space and bitterness. ) Decades ago , the Sierra Club published a series of books on wilderness that made their way into backpacks and onto coffee_tables and bookshelves across the country . They were often a combination of quotations and photographs and some text by the author . One in particular -- &quot; On the Loose , &quot; by Terry and Renny Russell -- became a sort of bible , not so_much read as incorporated , not so_much memorized as inhaled . If you were trapped in the city , this book could re-create the experience of camping in the Western wilderness , subtly , subliminally capturing those things that would catch in the corner of one ' s eye : the veins in an outcropping of rock over a river , dusty boots , the flash of a red truck . All juxtaposed with quotes from Ecclesiastes , Homer , Whitman and Aldo Leopold . In &quot; On Water , &quot; Farber ' s language and meaning are so densely intertwined that he re-creates the experience of being in the water without the help of photographs . If there were photographs , they would be the kind in which you see the edges of the fisheye_lens and feel yourself trapped inside the camera as the water splashes on the glass . Only a graceful ( fluid ! ) writer can pull this off -- to write_about whatever you want , to wander all_over the map , to present information in no other perceptible way than how your own mind works , to pull readers through that labyrinth and keep their eyes on the horizon . There is some raw information here ( although it must be said again that one reads this book for the feeling of the water ) . We learn , for example , that we are two-thirds water , &quot; ten to fifteen gallons in most of us ( human brains are three-quarters liquid , bones more_than 20 percent liquid , the just-formed fetus nearly entirely water ) &quot; ; how to drown properly ; why seawater is so mysterious , and the role cowries have played in human history . There ' s also a little bit of autobiography here -- memories of the waters of Farber ' s childhood in Boston , something about a family and saying something that hurts someone -- but Farber is probably three-quarters water and only one-quarter human flesh where memory is stored , so ruminations on_his_own life are kept to a fairly obscure minimum . &quot; Thank you , God , &quot; Farber writes . &quot; For what ? Oh , for this pulsing undulating , shimmering , sighing , breathing plasma of an ocean . For the miracle of warm water . For rideable waves and no wind. &quot; It may be a marketing trick , but I swear the book smells like seaweed .</TEXT>
