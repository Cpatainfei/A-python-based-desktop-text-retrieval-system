   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / JOSE DE LA TORRE : MEXICO IS UNLIKELY TO RETREAT FROM A DECADE OF RAPID PROGRESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Recent events in Mexico -- the revolt in Chiapas , executive kidnapings and the assassination of the leading presidential candidate -- have understandably spooked international investors . In April alone , more_than $ 3 billion in short-term capital flowed_out of Mexican securities and the stock_market took a 5.2 % plunge . Doubts are being expressed as_to whether Ernesto Zedillo , who took_up the ruling party ' s banner to run in the August presidential elections , is up_to leading the nation . There is a great_deal of confusion surrounding the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio in March -- and a lack of confidence as_to whether justice will prevail . In financial circles , there is also fear that the government may be forced to reinflate the economy in anticipation of the elections . But the Cassandras are wrong . The transformation taking_place in Mexico in the last decade is monumental -- and largely irreversible . Pre-1980s Mexico was characterized by trade_barriers that shielded domestic business from foreign competition . The state subsidized products from tortillas to public_transport , at huge costs . More_than 7 % of all_the credit created in the banking system during the late 1970s went_to finance deficits in public enterprises , which numbered more_than 1 # 200 by 1980 . While the economic_growth rate was high -- real growth in gross_domestic_product averaged 6.5 % between 1965 and 1980 -- inflation averaged 11.8 % annually . The built-in inefficiencies of protected industries worsened income inequities and produced massive trade_deficits . Foreign debt went from 9 % to 50 % of GDP between 1970 and 1982 , mainly to pay_for consumption and poor investments . After the crash of 1982 , Mexico began a long and painful process of transformation . From a_level of nearly 15 % of its GDP in 1986 , Mexico ' s fiscal deficit was erased entirely by last year . Tax_rates were simplified , the tax_base was broadened and a start at weeding_out corruption was made . The rich lost their tortilla subsidies . Average tariffs were reduced from 34 % to 4 % and other trade restrictions were nearly eliminated . As a result , the inflation_rate dropped to 8 % in 1993 from 160 % in 1987 . Meanwhile , foreign corporations rushed into Mexico as regulations were liberalized , and the modernization of financial markets attracted individual and institutional investors to a booming Bolsa index . Fully 65 % of these funds were channeled into productive enterprises . The number of public enterprises was reduced to 206 by 1993 . The North_American Free_Trade Agreement served to consolidate these gains . Still , it is in the social arena that many of the more dramatic changes have occurred . The &quot; lost decade &quot; of the 1980s left more_than 17 million people -- nearly a fifth of Mexico ' s population -- subsisting below the poverty_line . President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ' s &quot; solidarity &quot; program , in reaction , earmarked more_than $ 2.5 billion for infrastructure investments , and social spending has increased from 32 % to 50 % of the budget during his term . Since 1988 , more_than 150 # 000 local committees have been formed to plan and execute projects that have brought clean water , electricity and sewers to millions of people . In addition , 1.8 million deeds were issued to farmers for their property . While that obviously was not enough -- judged by the Chiapas uprising -- one can only ask what would have occurred in the absence of such programs . Looking ahead , the Salinas administration has two major responsibilities . One is to guarantee the integrity of the electoral process . A recent request for &quot; technical assistance &quot; from the United Nations and an invitation for foreign observers as witnesses -- both unthinkable just a_few months ago -- indicate the seriousness with which the government takes this duty . Salinas ' second , more difficult task : to ensure that justice is done_in the pursuit of Colosio ' s assassins . Tough challenges will remain for the next administration as well . The social pact signed_in 1987 among government , labor and industry kept inflation low by controlling prices , wages and the exchange_rate . Mexico ' s next president will face a sluggish economy that has yet to bear fruit for the majority of people . Real wages , for example , are still at 82 % of their 1980 level ; they must rise soon . Social spending in the provinces must increase , perhaps backed by more_than $ 3 billion in banking and telecommunications shares still held by the government -- and , if that is not enough , by privatizing the electrical_power and oil monopolies . The stability of the peso was central to the pacto de solidaridad , but now it has become a drag_on the economy . The strong peso has damaged export industries and shifted investment toward non-trading sectors . A rapid slide in the peso ' s value could be Salinas ' going-away present to his successor , in the manner typical of outgoing Mexican administrations . These are the consequences of a process of change that aims to accomplish in 10 years what has taken 50 or more elsewhere . Meanwhile , opportunities for foreign -- particularly U.S. -- investors and exporters are bullish . Already , many foreign firms have begun to redefine their North_American operations to include Mexico , a shift nowhere more evident than in the automotive industry . When General Motors Corp . moved production of its Cavalier models from Mexico to Lansing , Mich. , it also announced a $ 1-billion plan to build a plant in Mexico that would turn_out more_than 250 # 000 light trucks a year . Ford Motor Co . is increasing investments in various plants in Mexico , yet it estimates that U.S. exports of finished automobiles will rise to more_than 25 # 000 this year from fewer than 2 # 000 units . Indeed , Mexico ' s real business transformation is just beginning . Wal-Mart and Pepsico will dramatically alter patterns of competition and bring economies of scale to retailing and distribution . A TRW affiliate ' s introduction of reliable credit rating_systems will help reduce the cost of mortgages and consumer_credit by unleashing a market of 85 million eager consumers . Participants in the telecommunications industry will share_in a $ 3-billion modernization program over the next five to seven years . Manufacturers will find a large work_force willing to learn new skills . An old Spanish saying holds that fishermen profit in turbulent waters . Perhaps the real risk to U.S. business would come from not casting a net .</TEXT>
