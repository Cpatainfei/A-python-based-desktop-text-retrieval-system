   <HEADLINE> AMA OPPOSES EFFORT TO REVERSE SEX ORIENTATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The American Medical Assn. , reversing a 13-year-old policy , has stopped recommending efforts to turn unhappy gay_men and lesbians into heterosexuals . In a report adopted by the AMA ' s governing House of Delegates earlier this month , the association calls_for a &quot; non-judgmental recognition of sexual orientation by physicians. &quot; &quot; All patients , regardless of their sexual orientation , have a right to respect and concern for their lives and values , &quot; says the report , titled &quot; Health_Care Needs of Gay_Men and Lesbians in the U.S. &quot; The policy paper , adopted at a meeting Dec . 6 , replaces a 1981 paper titled &quot; Health_Care Needs of the Homosexual Population. &quot; The 1981 paper supported treatments aimed at changing the sexual orientation of homosexuals . The notion that gays could not be turned_into heterosexuals , it said , was a myth . &quot; There are some homosexuals who would like to and probably could change their sexual orientation , &quot; the old policy read . &quot; Because some homosexual groups maintain , contrary to the bulk of scientific evidence , that preferential or exclusive homosexuality can never be changed , these people may be discouraged from seeking adequate psychiatric consultation . What is more important is that this myth may also be accepted by homosexuals. &quot; In its new policy paper , the AMA notes that homosexuals may have &quot; some unique mental_health concerns &quot; related to negative social attitudes regarding homosexuality . However , it says , most of the emotional_disturbance homosexuals may feel about their orientation &quot; is_due more to a sense of alienation in an unaccepting environment. &quot; For this reason , the policy says , &quot; aversion_therapy &quot; -- such_as showing a gay_man nude pictures of men and then administering electric_shocks or a substance to induce vomiting -- &quot; is no longer recommended for gay_men and lesbians. &quot; Dr. M . Roy Schwarz , the AMA ' s vice_president , said Wednesday that he was surprised the policy paper was adopted without dissent . &quot; There were physicians who announced from the floor ( of the meeting ) that they were gay , &quot; he said . &quot; That would n ' t have happened five years ago. &quot; The new policy paper was drafted after a meeting last year between AMA leaders and officials from the Gay and Lesbian Medical Assn. , a group that has pressed the AMA for years to change its policies toward gay physicians and patients . &quot; I really believe that the truth won out more_than politics , &quot; said Benjamin Schatz , GLMA executive_director .</TEXT>
