   <HEADLINE> SETTLER ACTED ALONE IN MASSACRE , ISRAELI PANEL REPORTEDLY FINDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An inquiry commission found that Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein acted alone when he killed Muslim worshipers in February ' s Hebron mosque massacre , Israeli newspapers reported Friday . Testimony by Palestinian witnesses and some Israeli army guards had suggested that there was a second gunman or that Goldstein had an accomplice in the Feb . 25 blood bath at the Cave of the Patriarchs.At least 30 Muslim worshipers died and scores were wounded at a site sacred to Muslims and Jews before the crowd killed Goldstein . The five-member commission of three judges , a professor and a retired general is to publish its findings Sunday , but the contents of the report have already been leaked extensively . The commission is not seeking criminal indictments , but criticized senior army_officers for ignoring intelligence warnings about possible violence by Jewish extremists against Palestinians , the Yediot Aharonot and Haaretz newspapers said . The commission also found that law_enforcement against Jewish settlers in the occupied lands has been too lax , the dailies said . Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who also testified before the panel , shouldered some of the blame . As defense minister , Rabin is directly responsible_for the occupied lands . &quot; Steps that were taken were not sufficient , including by groups that I am in_charge of , &quot; Rabin said in remarks published Friday . In other findings , the commission said soldiers did not fire on worshipers fleeing the massacre site and did not intentionally block the evacuation of wounded .</TEXT>
