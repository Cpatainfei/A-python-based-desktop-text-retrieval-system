   <HEADLINE> L.A. SEEKS TO ACCELERATE EVICTION OF SQUATTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles city attorneys are looking_for a way to speed_up legal_proceedings to clear squatters and scavengers out of vacant , quake-damaged apartment_buildings in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood and to seal the structures , officials said Friday . Tactics for eliminating the &quot; ghost_towns &quot; of vacant buildings that have become a haven for vandals , drug_users and prostitutes were discussed Friday at a City_Hall meeting of a special task_force assigned to battle the problem . Officials from the Los Angeles Police_Department , the Building and Safety Department , the Housing Department and other agencies who participated in the meeting plan to outline a strategy and submit a report Tuesday to an ad-hoc earthquake recovery committee of the Los Angeles City_Council , they said . During the meeting , attorneys for the city were asked by other city officials to investigate whether they can shorten the normal 45-day process that building and safety officials need to clear and board_up vacant buildings that have become a public nuisance . But officials said it is unclear whether the city can bill property_owners for the cost if the notification process is shortened . &quot; We are not sure if we will be able to put liens on the properties , &quot; said Pat Bonino , a chief analyst for the city administrative office . &quot; There are some fine legal points about what the Building and Safety Department can do. &quot; If the property_owners cannot be forced to reimburse the city for the cost of securing the vacant buildings , Bonino said , the city may consider paying the bills by using some of the $ 20 million in discretionary quake relief funds from the federal_Department of Housing and Urban Development . But she said officials will continue to press the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help pay_for the effort , even though FEMA officials have already indicated that the problem does not qualify for disaster funds . Another concern among city officials is that police may_not have enough officers to sweep all_the problem buildings before they are sealed , suggesting that the city may have to hire security_guards to assist in the sweeps , said Gary Squier , general_manager of the city ' s Housing Department . He said city officials are considering using the HUD funding to pay_for the security_guards needed for such sweeps . The meeting was held after city officials instructed administrators Wednesday to come_up with a plan to deal with the growing problem of scavengers , squatters , vandals , drug_users and others taking_up residence in vacant buildings . City housing officials have identified 10 clusters of vacant quake-damaged buildings , which they dubbed &quot; ghost_towns , &quot; in the hardest hit areas of the Valley and Hollywood . Neighbors and owners of businesses near the vacant buildings say they fear the blight and crime of &quot; ghost_towns &quot; will spread .</TEXT>
