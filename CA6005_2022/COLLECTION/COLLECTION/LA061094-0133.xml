   <HEADLINE> JOINT_VENTURE TARGETS TOKYO FOR U.S.-MADE ELECTRIC TRUCKS ; AUTOS : UNDER TERMS OF THE DEAL , TRADER ITOCHU CORP . WILL INVEST $ 15 MILLION IN U.S. ELECTRICAR , A CALIFORNIA COMPANY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first deal to market roadworthy American-made electric vehicles in Japan , California-based U.S. Electricar Inc. and Itochu Corp. , one of the world ' s largest trading companies , have formed a joint_venture to target Tokyo ' s market for light delivery_trucks . The first models scheduled to be sold by Tokyo-based Itochu , until recently known as C . Itoh &amp; Co. , will be Grumman Corp . Long Life delivery_trucks , which are widely used by the U.S. Postal Service , and Chevrolet S-10 pickups -- both converted to run_on electric_batteries . U.S. Electricar is also designing an electric vehicle from the ground up that it hopes to eventually sell in Japan . &quot; We ' re excited about this just from the viewpoint that a company of our size would not ( otherwise ) have looked_at the international market . . . this early in our development , &quot; said Ted Morgan , chairman and chief_executive of U.S. Electricar , which has converted more_than 200 gasoline cars to run_on electricity in the last 10 years . The fast-growing firm is headquartered in Santa Rosa and has production facilities in Los Angeles , Redlands , Hawaii and Florida . The deal includes a $ 15-million investment in U.S. Electricar by Itochu , in exchange for a 4.5 % ownership share . Itochu ' s automobile group , already an international distributor for Mazda Motor Corp . and part owner of the Korean auto_maker Kia Motors Corp. , will market the vehicles in Japan . Another partner in the joint_venture , Tokyo R &amp; D , an engineering firm that has designed prototype electric vehicles for major Japanese auto_makers , will evaluate the U.S. vehicles and help get them licensed for_sale in Japan . &quot; This strategic alliance . . . ( will ) increase the global good by supplying pro-environmental technology and goods to the world , &quot; Motoyuki Katsube , a senior officer in Itochu ' s automobile division , said in a statement issued in Tokyo . Morgan said the joint_venture , to be called Japan Electricar Corp. , will target commercial fleet operators because the infrastructure does not yet exist in Japan to support widespread private use of electric vehicles . Fleet vehicles generally return to the same facility at the end of the workday , simplifying maintenance and recharging . There are no estimates yet of what the vehicles will cost in Japan . But U.S. Electricar is currently selling converted S-10 pickups and Geo Prisms for about $ 43 # 000 each . In quantities of 30 or more , fleets pay about $ 33 # 000 for the trucks and $ 29 # 000 for the cars . Morgan estimated that the vehicles sold in Japan would have a range of 60 to 80 miles , depending_on use , and cost 3 cents a mile to operate , compared to 8 cents a mile for gasoline-fueled vehicles . Itochu , with 10 # 000 employees in 865 businesses around the world , has been particularly active in the U.S. entertainment_industry and owns an interest in Time Warner Inc. The firm ' s 1993 revenue was $ 149.6 billion , according to the Japan Foreign Trade Council . Apparently , the only other significant export to any nation of U.S. electric vehicles has been from an older California company based in Anaheim . Taylor-Dunn Manufacturing Co . has sold hundreds of small electric vehicles in Japan , Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia , but these have been off-road service vehicles for use in airports and similar work sites .</TEXT>
