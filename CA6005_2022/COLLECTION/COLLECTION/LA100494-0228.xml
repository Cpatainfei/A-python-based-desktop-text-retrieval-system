   <TEXT> It was an astonishing sight , even in the new South_Africa . Three white policemen , symbol of the worst of apartheid , were driving an armored vehicle in Radebe , one of the most dangerous &quot; no-go zones. &quot; It was deserted but for burned-out shops , bullet-riddled homes and the sad debris of years of township war and neglect . Suddenly , a dozen black_men emerged from an alley . In the van , Sgt . Willie Naude grabbed his rifle and peered out a gun port . He tensed for an attack . Then it happened : The group smiled and waved . The surprised police waved back and stopped . A lanky youth with scars on his face walked up . &quot; Always , when we see police before , we run_away , &quot; explained Abel Mbena . &quot; Now we don ' t want a misunderstanding . Things have changed. &quot; Warrant_Officer Danie van der Berg grinned . &quot; It ' s kind of amazing . People say it ' s nice seeing the police. &quot; Five months after a historic election ushered_in South_Africa ' s first black-led government , attitudes are changing in battle-weary townships where police were the enemy and urban war was a way_of_life . Trust is still tenuous . Many police oppose reform , and many militants reject the rule_of_law . But the new constitution requires community policing , and blacks are starting to provide what long seemed impossible -- oversight of the long-hated police . &quot; In my whole lifetime , I only went_into a police_station when I was being arrested , &quot; laughed Sipho Tshabalala , a dapper 49-year-old insurance_broker who heads the new Katlehong community policing forum . Convicted of sabotage , he served eight harsh years on Robben Island with a far better-known prisoner , Nelson Mandela . Now president , Mandela is being feted this week in New York and Washington . From Wall_Street to the White_House , he hopes to persuade skeptical business_leaders that it is safe to invest in South_Africa . But law and order is elusive back home . Political violence fell sharply after the election but is rising again . And murder , rape , carjacking and most other reported crimes are at record levels . Even police aren ' t immune : 189 officers have been killed so far this year , half since the election . Last year , 271 were slain . The legacy of apartheid is largely to blame . Paramilitary police enforced injustice and bigotry for decades and ruthlessly repressed dissent with a network of informers and vicious anti-riot squads . Top officials sanctioned assassination and other terror tactics to maintain the authoritarian state . The anti-apartheid struggle , in turn , led to a culture of violence and contempt for the rule_of_law . Self-styled vigilante squads took_over townships , targeting rivals and police and forcing thousands of families to flee . Consumer boycotts and strikes were used as political weapons . The result is a nightmare like Katlehong , a bleak , treeless township on the East Rand outside Johannesburg . Most of the estimated 500 # 000 residents live_in matchbox homes , dilapidated migrant hostels or squalid squatter camps . Unemployment is rampant , schooling is dismal , violence is endemic . Katlehong last year racked_up 1 # 058 homicides , the highest murder rate in South_Africa . Most victims were shot or burned to death in the bitter political and criminal wars that racked the ghetto . Los Angeles , by comparison , had 1 # 076 homicides in a population more_than seven times as large . But Katlehong has only one police_station . And the 319 uniformed officers -- including dispatchers , clerks and other posts usually held by civilians in the United States -- share 15 vehicles and one incoming phone_line . The phone is always busy , complained Meverett Koetz , a community activist . &quot; And people are dying. &quot; Such problems are typical . Although most crime is in townships , 80 % of the police_stations are in white areas , home to only 15 % of the population . And while 60 % of the patrol force is nonwhite , nearly every officer is white . Even worse , brutal police abuses are still widespread . The Independent Board of Inquiry , a church-backed human_rights group , is investigating more_than 100 alleged torture cases since the election just in the Vaal Triangle , a cluster of townships south of Johannesburg . &quot; Torture is routine , &quot; said Sally Sealey , the board ' s senior researcher . &quot; It happens every single day . It ' s the only way police know to investigate and get confessions . It ' s the same in the new South_Africa as it was in the old. &quot; Torture is no longer official policy , of course , and police insist they are cracking_down on misconduct . But like many things involving police here , ending abuses remains more a goal than a reality . Ultimately , the government plans to merge the 115 # 000-member South_African police with the country ' s 10 other police services , a widely disparate array of segregated forces from the former black homelands . Sydney Mufamadi , minister of safety and security , has pledged that the new , 130 # 000-member force will function as a &quot; legitimate and popular police service , &quot; with heavy emphasis on community policing in high-crime areas . But legislation to create the force isn ' t likely to pass Parliament before May . Part of the problem is trying to integrate 11 separate bureaucratic and logistic systems , as well as pay scales and promotion policies . Another obstacle may be harder to overcome : police resistance to reform . &quot; To a large extent , the police_force is a totally intact force that was inherited from the previous government , &quot; said Melanie Lue , coordinator of the Policing Research Project , an independent group at the University of the Witwatersrand . &quot; As a result , the new government must tread very lightly. &quot; Gen . Johan van der Merwe , the holdover commissioner of police , concedes the revamping is going slowly . &quot; We are trying to speed_up the process to end the uncertainty , &quot; he said . &quot; It obviously affects the morale of our members. &quot; But more_than morale needs repair . Experts say the police must undergo a psychological shift to change their racist culture and military structure . &quot; In the years of apartheid , they were the masters , not the servants . That kind of thinking isn ' t going_to change overnight , &quot; warned Chris Boetha , a former police_captain who now teaches at the University of South_Africa . &quot; Police have to know that the right of protest is protected by law , &quot; he added . &quot; They ' ve been taught that protesters are the enemies of the state . . . . We ' ve never been an open and free society . We ' ve got_to teach police what an open and free society really is. &quot; But except for the name -- the South_African Police is now the South_African Police Service -- Boetha sees little real change . &quot; The commissioner is the same , &quot; he said . &quot; The general_staff is the same . The brigadiers , colonels and most station commanders are the same . If your recruitment hasn ' t changed , if your training hasn ' t changed , if your command hasn ' t changed , how can you expect police operations to change ? &quot; A recent night with police in sprawling Soweto , the country ' s largest township , showed the steep challenge ahead . &quot; There ' s nothing really changed except the government , really , &quot; said police Capt . Sarel Coetzee , head of the &quot; flying squad &quot; quick-reaction force , as he patrolled the dark , deserted streets . &quot; We ' re still doing the same job. &quot; He said his men have had no training on detailed provisions in the new constitution and bill of rights for protection of human_rights and civil_liberties . &quot; The only training we get is experience , &quot; he added . So they had no search_warrants , as required by law , when they burst into two homes , guns drawn , looking_for suspects . Nor , as the law requires , did they warn two men arrested later for car theft that they had the right to remain silent and the right to ask_for a lawyer and that anything they said could be used against them in court . But neither did anyone ask to see warrants , charges or even identification . &quot; They are police , &quot; said one man , puzzled when asked why he allowed officers to search his home and frighten his family . It turned_out that the cops , who never explained their presence , were in the wrong house . They left without a word . Such behavior infuriates Tshabalala , head of the Katlehong policing forum . He mans a desk each morning at the police_station to hear complaints and arranges weekly meetings between civilians and police brass . At a recent Saturday morning session , he said public education is desperately needed . &quot; Our people should know that police can ' t come_into their homes anymore without a search_warrant , &quot; he said . &quot; All we know is they come_in our homes and do whatever they like . They don ' t identify themselves or tell you your rights. &quot; Tshabalala clearly knows his rights : The local police_chief was transferred after he refused to cooperate with the forum . But the forum itself is in_trouble . There is no money to pay members , and interest is low . Only 40 of 150 people invited showed_up for the special Saturday session . The regular meeting , several days later , was canceled when no one came . Still , there are signs of progress . For the first time , residents have begun reporting crimes and identifying suspects to police . &quot; People were scared to be seen talking to the police before , &quot; said Lt . Jeshop Shabangu , head of the 15-member murder unit . &quot; If you did , you were a sellout to the enemy . And eventually you were a target. &quot; Capt . Phillip Mokoena , who heads the new community relations office , sees the shift in attitudes when he goes_to high_schools to talk to students . &quot; In the past , I would not even enter the school premises , no less address them , &quot; he said . &quot; Now I don ' t wear a bulletproof_vest , use an armored vehicle or carry a weapon . I am showing them that I can trust them and they can trust me. &quot;</TEXT>
