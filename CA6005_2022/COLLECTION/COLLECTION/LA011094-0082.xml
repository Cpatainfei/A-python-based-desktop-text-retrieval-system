   <HEADLINE> COUNTY ISSUE / THE PLAYBOY CHANNEL AT THE FIRE_STATION ; A VENTURA COUNTY FIRE CAPTAIN HAS FILED A GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE COUNTY CHARGING THAT A SEPTEMBER DECISION TO BAN THE PLAYBOY CHANNEL AT FIRE_STATIONS IN THE THOUSAND OAKS AREA HAS VIOLATED HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS . SHOULD FIREFIGHTERS BE ALLOWED TO WATCH THE PLAYBOY CHANNEL DURING THE HOURS WHEN THEY ARE IN THE STATION ON CALL ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Annie Muno , Probationary firefighter , Ventura Fire_Department , Station 3 I don ' t have any problem with it and , if I did have a problem with it , I would just walk_out_of the room . This is a big firehouse , and there are a lot of places we can go and a lot of things we can do_in our free_time . I can go read a book or a magazine , or I can ask to have the channel changed if it ' s something on that bothers me . It would be different if someone took a picture of a naked woman and taped it to my locker or shoved it in my face . That would be offensive . But we have choices here . I ' m not being forced to sit_down in front of the Playboy Channel . I have other places I can go . And besides , we ' re professionals here and we ' ve never had to deal with something like that . We have to work together here , and I think everybody has enough respect for each other that if they were watching something offensive to me and I told them , they would just change the channel . * George Lund , Ventura County fire_chief I say no . I think that my position is clear by the action we have already taken . We have the union filing a grievance saying this ban is unfair , but I feel very strongly that it ' s inappropriate and shouldn ' t be permitted . Regardless of whether they have freedom_of_speech , I see this as an issue of the workplace , and I feel that we have to be able to control what goes_on there . Let ' s remember , it ' s still a place where work is done . It ' s still a place that ' s shared with both sexes -- we have women and men working there . And it ' s a place where there are often juveniles present ; we have a cadet program where young people are frequent visitors to the station_house . Whether they are responding to an emergency or on a work cycle or just on their free_time , that doesn ' t change the fact that they are in a workplace and we should have the right to control the activities that occur within it . * Ken Maffei , President , Ventura County Professional Firefighters Assn . My answer to that is that our issue is not with the Playboy Channel or with Playboy magazine . Our issue is with the idea of censorship and the First_Amendment . What if the county said they don ' t want you to read the Bible in the fire_station ? We ' re talking_about the Constitution of the United States here . When it ' s an issue of censorship of any kind , we feel that the government should be opposed to it and that ' s why we ' re opposed to their banning anything . Certainly we respect the sensitivity of some people . If this stuff is offensive to even one person at the station , by all means it should not be watched . We do recognize that this is a place_of_business and , of course , the firefighters ' first priority is their work . But this is a unique place_of_business because the firefighters also have to spend their free_time and leisure_time there . The question is , then , should they be censored from watching something they want to watch while they are not working ? While it is a public building , there are places in it that are private , and they should be able to use those spaces however they wish . * Vicky Howard , Ventura County supervisor I personally think that allowing the Playboy Channel in the workplace is , without question , totally and completely inappropriate . This is a public building , a county building . So I don ' t see the difference whether it ' s the day room of the fire_station or in my office . It ' s simply not right to have that kind of thing on television in any county office . We have to be able to draw_the_line somewhere and , if we are going_to draw_the_line , I don ' t think there ' s any question that the Playboy Channel would fall on the wrong side of the line . The thing about it is , I think we are dealing with a very professional Fire_Department here . that ' s why they recognized this as a problem and dealt with it . I think if you went_out and asked them , the vast majority of the firefighters would agree that it would be totally inappropriate for employees of the county to be watching that kind of television in a county facility . * Charlene Pizzadili , Past coordinator , Simi Valley / Conejo chapter of the National Organization for Women I don ' t know of any other job where something like that would be allowed . And this isn ' t just any job . The taxpayers are paying_for the firefighters to be working . The whole argument that they are just on standby or that they are_on their free_time just doesn ' t hold water . No matter what they ' re doing , when they are_on the clock , they are supposed to be professionals . What makes this whole_thing disturbing to me is that I have to wonder , what kind of people are these that would fight for the Playboy Channel when they know it could make their co-workers uncomfortable ? Why in the world can ' t they leave something like this for the privacy of their home ? If I was working under that captain , I would be asking myself , is this somewhere where I can be treated equally as a woman ? Do I want to be working for somebody who is insensitive to the idea that this is offensive ? I don ' t see any difference between this and some firefighter arguing he wants to show racist films to black firefighters and expecting them to sit there and allow it to happen . Sexism is just as serious as racism .</TEXT>
