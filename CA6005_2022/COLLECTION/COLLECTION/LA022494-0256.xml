   <TEXT> On the theory that extraordinary athletes deserve extraordinary medal ceremonies , the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee came_up with a unique victory rostrum for these Games . The podium on which skiers , ski_jumpers and other winners stand to receive their medals was carved out of a 600-year old block of ice taken from the Jostedal Glacier , an idea contributed by architect Ketil Moe of the LOOC ' s design office . &quot; For hundreds of years local people have made use of these chunks of glacial ice for their households and the fish industry , &quot; Moe told the official Olympic newspaper , Hugin . &quot; Thus , glaciers play a role in the everyday life of many Norwegians. &quot; Lights were placed below the block , creating an impression that the medalists are floating . And lest these Olympians slip , there ' s an aluminum grid embedded in the surface to give them traction . * Finland ' s hockey_coach , Curt Lindstrom , owns a betting parlor in Stockholm , his hometown . The action is usually confined to horse_racing and soccer , but he makes exceptions -- and makes bets , too . Lindstrom made a wager on_his_own Olympic team but said it was &quot; a long_time before the tournament . No betting during the tournament. &quot; Asked how much he had wagered , he got coy . &quot; For some people , two crowns is a lot , &quot; he said . Pressed again , he again declined to specify the amount . &quot; My wife can hear it , &quot; he said . HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
