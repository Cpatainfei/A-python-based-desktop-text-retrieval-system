   <HEADLINE> OOZE CRUDELY REBUKES RUSSIAN DENIALS ON OIL SPILL ; ENVIRONMENT : ARCTIC VILLAGERS WATCH OIL FROM LEAKING PIPELINE SEEP INTO WATERWAYS . OFFICIALS DOWNPLAY DISASTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Oil coats the hulls of fishing_boats in the ice along the banks of the Pechora River . In bays and inlets near this Arctic_Circle village of reindeer farmers and salmon fishermen , frozen oil droplets fleck the ice . The black crude is a greasy rebuke to Russian officials , who insist that the majestic Pechora -- and the rich fishing grounds that stretch to the Arctic_Ocean -- have not been polluted by this country ' s largest oil spill . This autumn , the people of Ust-Usa watched helplessly as thousands of tons of oil began oozing into the vast watery network that flows_from the desecrated oil fields of Usinsk into the Pechora , then 450 miles north through the tundra to the Barents Sea . Fishermen say the oil traveled at least 70 miles downstream before the Pechora began to freeze . The riverside meadows in Ust-Usa where cattle fatten each summer are befouled , they say , and the few fish that swam upstream this fall reeked of petroleum and were inedible . Now the 2 # 500 villagers are bracing for spring , when the oil-drenched marshes , streams and rivers that feed the Pechora will melt . Unless the oil is excavated from frozen swamps before the thaw , the people of Ust-Usa expect a slimy deluge that could wipe_out their way_of_life . &quot; If they ( officials ) say it ' s just a miniature , local catastrophe , they are only fooling themselves , &quot; said Viktor Obaidakhanin , an Ust-Usa police major . &quot; We are all living on this one small planet. &quot; And the damage continues . Earlier this month , journalists and environmentalists discovered more fresh oil hemorrhaging from three new ruptures in the decrepit Usinsk oil_pipeline network . One huge leak , captured on videotape by the environmental group Greenpeace , gushed about 13 # 000 tons of oil , Russian scientists say . In a practice once typical of Soviet oil fields , cleanup crews tried to get_rid_of the oil by setting it afire , sending up huge black clouds of toxin-laden smoke that hovered darkly on the horizon . Yevgeny Grunis , industry minister of the autonomous Republic of Komi , where Usinsk is located , has denied that any new spills have occurred . Other officials said the oil had been spilled in August but only now set_ablaze . The videotape , however , shows a vast black lake of oil , not yet solidified nor covered by snow . At another site_visited by journalists this month , tarry pools of oil had oozed over the fresh snow , and cleanup workers said the pipeline had leaked there two days earlier . The story of the Usinsk oil spill is a familiar Third-World tale of environmental pillage and official indifference , analysts say . &quot; They get the wealth from our earth , they sell it , and instead of improving the lot of the local population , they ruin our lives , &quot; Obaidakhanin said . &quot; Those in power spit on the people. &quot; The oil spill began in July , when 23 separate leaks sprang in a 30-mile pipeline owned by Komineft , a former state-owned oil giant based in the city of Usinsk . Komi officials say 14 # 033 tons were spilled , while Western estimates range up_to 270 # 000 tons . If Western sources are correct , the accident would be about eight times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska . &quot; The debate about how much oil spilled is academic , &quot; Greenpeace biologist Paul Horsman said . &quot; This is the largest of many spills that have occurred here , and there is going_to be major environmental damage. &quot; The spill was discovered Aug . 23 , when members of the Usinsk Ecology Committee flying in a helicopter noticed a huge blotch of oil in a swamp north of the city , committee head Sergei V . Zhunyov said . City officials called a meeting of Komineft and the seven other companies -- three of them Western -- that use the 22-year-old pipeline , a decaying facility that all sides agree should have been scrapped at least four years ago . But the oilmen refused to shut the pipeline for repairs . &quot; They gave many reasons for not wanting to shut it down , &quot; Zhunyov said . &quot; If they had done_it sooner , maybe this tragedy could have been avoided. &quot; Komineft officials promised to have a new pipeline completed by December , and the city agreed to allow the old one to keep operating until Sept . 6 , while a bypass was being readied . But on Sept . 5 , the pipeline sprang another massive leak . Thousands of tons gushed into the Palnik-Shor creek , blackened the Kolva River and moved_into the Pechora . Earlier this month , workers at Palnik-Shor were using an excavator to smash the ice , scoop congealed oil from the frigid water and pour the black gunk atop a heap of dirt . Workers said the oil recovered from areas near roads will be reprocessed whenever possible , but in remote areas it will be burned . Western environmentalists shudder at the prospect of giant clouds , laced with toxic hydrocarbons , blanketing the tundra . As temperatures plunged to 15 degrees below zero Fahrenheit this month , the struggle to clean one 20-foot-square pit looked haphazard and excruciatingly slow . By official estimates , 66 acres have been contaminated . &quot; I think if they can remove even 50 % before the spring melt , that will be very good , &quot; Zhunyov said . &quot; They ' ll never be able to clean all_of it . It will always wash into the rivers every time it rains. &quot; Greenpeace , the Green Cross and other ecologists are calling_for an immediate shutdown of the pipeline and an international effort to halt the spread of the catastrophe . Komi officials say they can handle the cleanup themselves -- and accuse Western companies of dramatizing the spill to sell expensive oil-spill cleanup equipment . However , workers at Palnik-Shor were unsure they could finish the huge job before the thaw . &quot; Of course we need international help , &quot; said Ivan V . Dorokhin , 43 . &quot; If we don ' t clean it up in time , the oil will be in Norway by spring. &quot; Today , the Kolva River is coated with more_than a foot of frozen oil . Moose and bears fled the area long ago . But tundra_swans , ducks and geese still nest in nearby marshes in springtime . Even the gruff oil workers are praying that the migrating birds will not stop in Usinsk this year . Last week , they found the corpse of an oil-drenched Arctic_fox . Dorokhin and his comrades say the new capitalist oil_companies care as little about the environment as their Soviet predecessors -- and far less about the oil workers . The laborers jumped , though , at the chance to earn $ 9.70 in cash a day from a cleanup company called Priroda , as Komineft has not paid their salaries in five months . Instead of money , the workers have been receiving coupons that are valid only at Usinsk stores that are supplied by Komineft . The coupons have been dubbed &quot; Leonidovs &quot; after former Komineft General Director Valentin Z . Leonidov . The despised company scrip will buy_food , soap , razor blades , cheap boots and other essentials . But Leonidovs cannot be used to pay a phone_bill or buy a train_ticket , and only one bread store in this city of 40 # 000 will accept them , said Natalia Nikolayevna , a 32-year-old shopper , who added : &quot; If the kids get sick , I give them whatever medicine we still have left. &quot; One oil worker complained that he had forgotten the taste of vodka . Another said he could not get Komineft to pay his back wages in cash_in time for him to attend his mother ' s funeral . Bitter about the turn their lives have taken since the fall of the Soviet_Union , local residents say the Republic of Komi is under the political thumb of the oil_company . They call the region &quot; the Republic of Komineft. &quot; Workers said that when Komineft was privatized , they wound_up with just a handful of shares , while managers snagged thousands . Employees call it prikhvatizatsia -- a pun that combines privatization with the verb to seize . &quot; They only think_of one thing -- how to line their pockets , &quot; said Vladimir P . Fedulov , 32 , who operates the earthmoving machines . He complained that Komineft pleads poverty when asked to build a new pipeline , pay its workers , buy spare_parts or even supply lubricating oil for the equipment . But somehow the oil barons have the money to cruise Usinsk in shiny new Mercedes-Benzes . &quot; They think_of us as slaves , not workers , &quot; Fedulov complained . Since the spill , the oil_company has demonstrated its political clout . The former head of the Usinsk Ecology Committee , who told authorities and journalists he believed that Komineft had grossly understated the accident , promptly lost his job when the agency was &quot; reorganized , &quot; said Valentina Semyashkina of the Committee to Save the Pechora . The Usinsk Ecology Committee ' s Zhunyov , who survived the purge , confirmed that a &quot; reorganization &quot; had occurred but declined to discuss details . After a brief interview last week , he asked reporters to leave quickly , saying he was expecting a visit by security officials and did not want them to find a foreign journalist in his office . Russian officials have dismissed worries that the spill will foul the Pechora or the Arctic_Ocean . Yevgeny Khailov , chairman of a commission that inspected the Usinsk accident , said &quot; there is no oil &quot; in the Pechora -- but even if there is , &quot; it could have come from anywhere , &quot; the newspaper Argumenti i Facti reported . When the Moscow press and Western media began crying cover-up , Komi officials suggested that American estimates of the oil spill had been deliberately inflated as part of what one TV broadcast called President &quot; Bill_Clinton ' s renewed doctrine of U.S. unconditional supremacy in the world. &quot; Komi officials have repeatedly suggested that Western oil_companies exaggerated the size of the spill to drive down the price of Komineft stock , then bought_up shares that had fallen to one-third of their earlier price . The conspiracy theory appeared to have a wide following in Usinsk , where many suspect Western oil_companies of making off with Russia ' s mineral wealth and leaving as little money as possible behind to rebuild the decaying Soviet-built oil infrastructure . But Ust-Usa residents said they would be happy to see Western oil_companies pumping in their neighborhood , as long as the work was done cleanly . They say the oil_industry has brought them nothing but harm . Although they live 19 miles from vast natural_gas reserves , villagers in Ust-Usa must heat their homes with wood they chop themselves . For 20 years , authorities have failed to deliver on promises to run a gas pipeline to the village . Meanwhile , the longer oil development goes_on , the slimmer nature ' s pickings . Locals depended_on fish caught in the Pechora , berries and mushrooms picked in the Arctic wilderness . Now , villagers say the fish are disappearing , river water is no longer fit to drink , and the government turns a deaf ear to their complaints . Valentina Svyatokho , an official on an Ust-Usa collective_farm , recalled the magnificent catches of her childhood , when every villager had barrels overflowing with dried and salted fish . Last week , she said , a local could not even find enough fish to serve at his daughter ' s wedding . &quot; We miss our fish , &quot; she said with sorrow .</TEXT>
