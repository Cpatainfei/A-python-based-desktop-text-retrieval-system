   <HEADLINE> SUPREME COURT BARS SEX BIAS IN JURY SELECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saying the day is past when women or men can be excluded from juries based on &quot; group stereotypes , &quot; the Supreme Court on Tuesday outlawed sex discrimination in jury selections . &quot; Equal_opportunity to participate in the fair administration of justice is fundamental to our democratic system , &quot; retiring Justice Harry A . Blackmun wrote . Permitting trial_lawyers to exclude people from juries because of their sex &quot; serves to ratify and perpetuate invidious , archaic and overbroad stereotypes about the relative abilities of men and women , &quot; he said . The 6-3 decision culminates a century-long struggle to assure women equality in the courtroom . After the Civil War , the 14th Amendment guaranteed all people the &quot; equal protection of the laws , &quot; and the Supreme Court in 1880 invoked that clause to say states could no longer bar blacks from juries . However , almost as an aside , the all-male tribunal added that unquestionably states &quot; may confine the selection ( of jurors ) to males. &quot; In this century , the legal barriers to women serving on juries slowly fell . But as late as 1947 , 16 states continued to exclude women from juries . Even after those barriers were removed , sex discrimination in the courtroom did not end . By tradition , trial_lawyers are permitted to exclude a fixed number of potential jurors based on a hunch that the person will look unfavorably on their client . At least until recently , the hunches behind those &quot; peremptory strikes &quot; often involved judgments relating to a person ' s race or sex , as well as his or her appearance , nationality or occupation . Peremptory strikes are justified on the theory that , by permitting both sides to exclude the potential jurors most likely to be biased , the result will be a jury panel that is fair and impartial . But beginning in the 1986 case of Batson vs . Kentucky , the Supreme Court moved to forbid lawyers to use race in striking potential jurors . Follow-up rulings broadly extended the principle . The sweeping logic of those rulings virtually assured that blatant sex discrimination would soon be outlawed as well , and that final step came Tuesday . The National Women ' s Law Center applauded the ruling as a &quot; landmark decision for women ' s rights &quot; that recognizes &quot; the shared history of discrimination faced by women and racial minorities in this country. &quot; The ruling requires no change in the courtrooms of California . The state Supreme Court and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San Francisco already have forbidden sex discrimination in jury selections . Dissenting Tuesday were Chief_Justice William H . Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas . Scalia called the ruling a triumph for &quot; thoroughly up-to-date and right thinking &quot; that may hurt women more_than it will help them . &quot; But times and trends do change , and unisex is unquestionably in fashion , &quot; he said . Scalia noted that the victor in Tuesday ' s decision was an Alabama man who , because all males had been excluded from his jury , won a retrial in a paternity suit even though a blood_test showed with 99.9 % certainty that he was the father . The defendant , James E . Bowman , had protested when a state prosecutor moved to strike men from the roster of potential jurors . The panel concluded that Bowman was indeed the father of the boy born in 1989 , and it ordered him to pay the mother $ 415 a month in child_support . The Alabama Supreme Court upheld the ruling and said Bowman had not suffered any prejudice in the jury selection . It noted that his lawyer had moved to exclude as_many women as possible from the jury . In the high_court , state prosecutors argued that in sensitive cases , such_as those involving rape , paternity or sexual_harassment , they should be permitted to exclude as_many men as possible . But the justices disagreed , reversed the state court in the case of J.E.B. vs . Alabama , 92-1239 , and overturned the paternity judgment . Despite the outcome of that case , a women ' s rights advocate said the wider effect of the ruling will be a benefit for all . &quot; Everyone -- men and women -- has an interest in having jurors selected on a non-discriminatory basis , &quot; said Deborah L . Brake of the National Women ' s Law Center . Although prosecutors in Bowman ' s retrial will not be permitted to exclude all_the men , the defense_lawyer will not be permitted to seek the exclusion of all women , she said . During jury selection , an allegation of race or sex bias can trigger the judge to intervene . Then , the lawyer who had moved to strike a particular juror is called_upon to explain the reason for his or her move . If the lawyer can supply a non-discriminatory reason , the juror can be excluded , Blackmun said . His opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens , Sandra Day O ' Connor , David H . Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg . In a separate statement , Justice Anthony M . Kennedy said he agreed with the result . In her concurring opinion , O ' Connor , the first woman to serve on the high_court , made clear that she did not share the majority ' s view that all sex distinctions must be banned . &quot; We know that like race , gender matters , &quot; she wrote . &quot; In rape cases , for example , female jurors are somewhat more likely to vote to convict than male jurors. &quot;</TEXT>
