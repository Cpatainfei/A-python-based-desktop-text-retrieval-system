Pac Rim said about $ 16.8 million of the proceeds from issuing debt would be used to increase the capital of its Pacific Rim Assurance Co . subsidiary .

If one party breaches the agreement it must pay $ 1.5 million in liquidated damages , and Pac Rim must pay an equal amount if it enters a competing agreement with another investor . The convertible debt , or debentures , will carry an 8 % interest_rate and will be_due in five years . The debentures are convertible into shares of Pac Rim common_stock at $ 2.75 a share . The warrants will allow PRAC to acquire 1.5 million shares of Pac Rim common_stock at an exercise price of $ 2.50 each , another 1.5 million shares at $ 3 apiece , and 800 # 000 shares at $ 3.50 a share .
