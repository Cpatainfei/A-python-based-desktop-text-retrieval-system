   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187 ; RIORDAN , LUNGREN AMONG NEUTRAL OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s the hottest political issue to hit California in years . But less than a week before the votes are counted , Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and some of the state ' s most prominent elected officials have yet to take a stand on Proposition 187 , the emotion-packed ballot measure that would bar illegal immigrants from most government services and require local health , educational and police officials to report suspects to state and federal authorities . The list of lingering fence-sitters includes state Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren ; Matt Fong , Republican candidate for state_treasurer ; state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi ; Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez , and San Diego Mayor Susan Golding . Also failing to weigh in has been the state ' s senior public official emeritus -- former President and two-term Gov . Ronald Reagan . Political observers say there is a natural inclination among cautious officials to gauge which way the wind is blowing before stepping into the fray . &quot; Sometimes you guess wrong and you get burned , &quot; said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the Center for Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate_School . In the case of the sweeping anti-illegal immigrant measure , the wind ' s direction has become less clear as Election_Day approaches . Once boasting a runaway lead in the polls , the measure ' s support has narrowed in recent weeks and its passage no longer appears certain . However , the measure ' s volatility and divisive nature have also led both sides to thinly veil their distaste for politicians refusing to make their preference known . &quot; There ' s no hiding in the dark on this subject -- we have made this an issue of national attention now , &quot; said Robert Kiley , political strategist for the pro-187 campaign committee . &quot; Some of them are trying to duck it . Some of them have taken a long_time to come_around . But it is the obligation of every elected official to tell their constituency how they stand on Proposition 187. &quot; For once , opponents of the ballot measure agree with their foes . &quot; I think you show leadership by saying ' this is how I ' m going_to vote , ' &quot; said Scott Macdonald , spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187 . &quot; These are people asking the voters to follow them or put them in a position of responsibility. &quot; Republican Riordan , who drew national news coverage last weekend for his endorsement of Democratic Senate incumbent Dianne Feinstein ' s reelection bid , has decided to stay neutral precisely because the issue is so rancorous , says mayoral press secretary Noelia Rodriguez . &quot; He ' s not planning to take a position , &quot; Rodriguez said . &quot; He has said . . . it would be divisive for the city if he took a position on it , recognizing the fact it is such an emotional issue. &quot; At the same time , the mayor of the nation ' s second-largest city has made some cryptic comments indicating he has problems with key provisions of the measure , which would bar illegal immigrants from virtually all government services except emergency health_care . &quot; He has said he doesn ' t believe that any person , especially children , should be denied basic services such_as health , education and nutrition , &quot; said Rodriguez . &quot; He also believes that local_governments should be compensated by the federal_government , because it is not enforcing immigration laws adequately and local_governments have to incur the expenses. &quot; Riordan may be caught in the middle of his ongoing relationships with leaders on both ends of the Proposition 187 spectrum , observers say . For years , the first-term mayor and prominent businessman has been close to Cardinal Roger M . Mahony , one of the most outspoken opponents of Proposition 187 . On the other hand , Riordan also has close ties to Gov . Pete Wilson , who has employed the get-tough ballot measure as a cornerstone of his reelection campaign . Jeffe terms the mayor &quot; a real puzzle. &quot; &quot; He ' s got political cover from ( conservative former Republican Cabinet secretaries ) Jack F . Kemp and William J . Bennett . He himself has criticized the initiative and has endorsed one highly visible candidate . Perhaps he ' s holding_back so as not to embarrass Pete Wilson , who he has also endorsed. &quot; Lungren , also a Republican , has been attacked repeatedly by Democratic election foe Tom Umberg for failing to take a stand on Proposition 187 . Lungren , who has said recently that he is still studying the measure , said Monday that he intends to take a position prior to Election_Day . Questioning why Lungren would still be studying the issue at this late date , Umberg says he came_to his own conclusion to oppose the measure by reading the attorney_general ' s own brief summary of the initiative in the state ' s official ballot pamphlet . During a news_conference Monday , Lungren said he would defend the initiative against expected lawsuits if it is approved by state voters . But he also made clear that he would not prosecute educators , health administrators and others for failing to report suspected illegal immigrants to state and federal authorities , since the measure makes no specific provisions for enforcement . To those seeking his position on Proposition 187 , treasurer candidate Fong has sent_out letters saying that there are good arguments on both sides -- and that he is remaining neutral . &quot; We do have a problem with illegal immigration . And , our state Legislature and the federal_government are unwilling to address this problem , &quot; writes Fong , who serves on the State Board of Equalization . &quot; However , the unintended consequences of Proposition 187 concern me . Also not publicly announcing a position has been Garamendi , who was defeated by Kathleen Brown in the June Democratic gubernatorial primary . San Diego Mayor Golding has also declined to take a position on Proposition 187 , despite being a staunch supporter of Wilson and one of the first public officials to express concern about illegal immigrants and crime . While a county supervisor in the late 1980s , Golding caused a furor by blaming illegal immigrants for a large portion of the crime_wave plaguing the county ' s affluent suburban_areas . She was forced to back_down when her statistics proved faulty . Golding is not alone among San Diego officials in sitting_out the Proposition 187 debate . Neither the San Diego City_Council nor the San Diego County Board of Supervisors , which has sued the federal_government to recover millions of dollars spent on providing services for illegal immigrants , has taken a position . In Orange County , the birthplace of the Proposition 187 movement , Supervisor Vasquez , the county ' s highest-ranking elected Latino official , has drawn fire for his refusal to take a stand . &quot; I haven ' t taken a conclusive position , &quot; Vasquez said last week . &quot; I don ' t intend to get involved in the campaign for either side. &quot; Proponents of the measure , including William S . King , executive_vice_president of Americans Against Illegal Immigration , say Vasquez is acting_out of fear of losing his job . &quot; I think every official should show his colors on it , &quot; said King . &quot; I don ' t think he has shown much courage . These people should be standing_up one way or the other . This is not the time to be hiding around the skirts of ' no comment. ' &quot; Arturo Montez , a spokesman for the League of United Latin_American Citizens , has also attacked Vasquez , who was appointed to the board by Gov . George Deukmejian in 1987 and elected to a four-year term in a predominantly non-Latino district in 1992 . &quot; Gaddi Vasquez is the highest-ranking Latino in the county and he ' s used it to propel his political career here and on the national level , &quot; Montez said . &quot; But obviously he feels he is_on the right side of the street , the safe side , and he wishes to become a spectator just like the good Germans did when they watched other Germans being marched to the ovens. &quot; Former President Reagan , whose endorsement or opposition would be seen as valuable , could not be reached for comment . Repeated calls to his Century City office were not returned by his press spokesmen . Longtime Reagan insider Lyn Nofziger , contacted in Washington , said , &quot; It ' s hard to get a ( public ) statement from him on anything anymore. &quot; Times staff writers Tony Perry and Matt Lait contributed to this story .</TEXT>
