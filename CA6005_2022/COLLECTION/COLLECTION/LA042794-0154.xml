   <HEADLINE> VOTERS , INCLUDING BOMB VICTIM , RELISH MAKING MARK ON HISTORY ; SOUTH_AFRICA : WHITES AND BLACKS WAIT SIDE BY SIDE AT POLLS . IT ' S SOMETHING MANY THOUGHT THEY WOULD NEVER SEE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two days before , a car_bomb blew shrapnel into Zibani Dube ' s chest as he walked to church here . But on Tuesday , the tall 19-year-old , in a hospital_bed and barely able to move , used his uninjured right_hand to cast his first vote as a free black_man in South_Africa . &quot; I feel very satisfied , &quot; he said , wincing in pain as he spoke from beneath a plastic oxygen_mask . &quot; The government I am voting for is the one that will meet our needs . But I feel it has got_to take some strong measures so we do not face these kinds of criminal actions again. &quot; Whom did he vote for ? &quot; that ' s my secret , &quot; Dube said , managing a smile . It was a day that many in South_Africa , and many_more around the world , thought they would never see . White suburban women stood_in line to vote with their black maids . Retired white businessmen were there with elderly black gardeners . All across the country , South_Africa ' s black , white , mixed-race and ethnic Indian citizens began choosing their country ' s government -- together -- for the first time in 350 years . The first of three days of balloting was set_aside for special voters , such_as the elderly and the ailing , as well as police and election workers . At a suburban Johannesburg school , used for dozens of whites-only elections in the apartheid past , a black policeman was the first voter through the doors . &quot; It actually put a lump in my throat to give him that ballot , &quot; said Jennifer Dunn , 45 , a white voting officer in the school . &quot; It ' s all very exciting . It ' s incredible the enthusiasm I see , especially among the older black voters. &quot; At Hillbrow Hospital , which has mostly black patients and staff , men and women in hospital-issue checkered robes , some on crutches and others carrying bags of fluid for intravenous drips , stood_in a line that snaked up two flights of stairs to voting_booths in the hospital auditorium . Although they had been taught how to cast their votes , many blacks appeared tentative at first . Election officials checked each voter ' s identity document . The voter ' s hand was put beneath an ultraviolet_light to ensure that he had not already voted , then the fingers were sprayed with a dye . Voters received a national ballot first and went_to a row of small booths where they marked an X next to one of the 18 parties . That ballot was placed in a box , and the procedure was repeated for the provincial ballot . &quot; This is the first time in my life , &quot; said August Renoto , 32 , who was in the hospital with pneumonia . &quot; My father -- even my grandfathers -- never has been allowed to vote_in this country. &quot; Under South_African law , voters cannot be asked how they voted as they leave the polls . But Renoto volunteered that he voted for the African National Congress , the likely election winner . &quot; There is no one else but Nelson Mandela , &quot; he said of the ANC president . Francina Malatye , a 49-year-old black_woman , said she was confident that her vote would &quot; bring a new South_Africa . It ' s going_to be nice from now on . We will live well , just like in America. &quot; Zibani Dube had been so determined to vote that he obtained his laminated temporary voter card more_than a month ago . When the bomb_blast killed nine and landed Dube in Hillbrow Hospital , his first request was for his voter card . His parents brought it in , placing it in a steel drawer next to his bed . On Tuesday , election officials walked the bare halls of the hospital to find the bedridden and others unable to make the climb to the hospital auditorium . They found Dube almost alone in a 20-bed ward , surrounded by black nurses and lying beneath a long white sheet with tubes running_out of his body . &quot; The election is going_to help this country a lot , &quot; Dube said . &quot; Things are going_to change , and there will be an atmosphere of peace and love in South Africa. &quot; But , he added , &quot; if the new government is not aware of the right-wingers who threaten the system , it will cause much trouble for the country . Every South_African , be he black or white , must be able to live_in safety. &quot; If the recent spate of bombings , which killed 21 Sunday and Monday in the deadliest campaign ever waged by the far right , was designed to keep voters away from the polls , it didn ' t appear to have worked Tuesday . President Frederik W . de Klerk had sought to reassure voters that they would be safe , and at least a dozen police and army soldiers guarded most polling_places . Most voters said they felt the day was too important for them to be deterred by small groups of right-wing terrorists . &quot; I did have a little worry , &quot; said Christine Oxton , a 43-year-old white_woman who uses a wheelchair . &quot; But I had to be here . And this is long overdue. &quot; Oxton , who does volunteer work for a black education aid group , said she hoped the voting will foster big changes in race relations . &quot; As a white South_African , I actually feel cheated that I know so little about my black brothers and sisters , &quot; she said . &quot; That will change now . I just hope it will be the right thing for this country at the end of the day. &quot; Maria Loudon , a white_woman from Johannesburg ' s suburbs who has voted_in elections for three decades , arrived_at a polling_station with her retired husband and a disabled son . She said she was concerned more about the country ' s future than her safety . &quot; I ' m worried about where this country is going , &quot; she said . &quot; And I think a lot more whites are going_to vote than ever before , not because of the bombings but because we ' re worried about the country. &quot; But she said that voting alongside blacks , who have been denied the vote by white governments in South_Africa , seemed only fair . &quot; They should have had the vote long ago , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t think black people would have run the country as well , but they still should have been able to vote. &quot; Her husband , J . R. , added : &quot; There ' s really no question who ' s going_to win . It will be the ANC . But the important question for us is who finishes second and third . that ' s the problem. &quot; Many blacks , as well as whites , seemed to take the new , all-race voting in stride . Despite the racism that has been a characteristic of South_Africa for years , blacks_and_whites do_work together , though often in situations that make_it clear who is the boss . And many millions of them share a desire for calm in their society . Dorah Kubela , a black maid from Soweto , has cleaned white-owned houses and taken_care of white children all her life . While visiting her daughter , who works as a maid in a white household in Johannesburg ' s suburbs , she cast her ballot in a voting station used primarily by whites . &quot; It ' s very nice that charwomen and madams are voting together , &quot; said Kubela , 69 . &quot; But I just wish it would all be over . There is just too_much trouble in this country. &quot;</TEXT>
