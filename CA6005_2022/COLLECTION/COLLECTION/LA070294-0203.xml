   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / ROUND OF 16 ; ANALYSIS ; NOW FUN REALLY BEGINS ; SECOND ROUND : WITH SUDDEN-DEATH ELIMINATION , TEAMS can ' t AFFORD TO COAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Officially , the 1994 World Cup began at Soldier Field two weeks ago , when Oprah Winfrey fell on her face and Carlos Leonel Trucco fell on another part of his anatomy . Unofficially , it begins today , and from now on falls from grace will be a lot more painful . Winfrey ' s abrupt exit from the opening-ceremony stage was the cause of mild amusement on June 17 , especially when it was learned she had injured nothing more serious than her dignity . Goalkeeper Trucco ' s pratfall caused amusement of another kind , especially in the German camp , since it allowed Juergen Klinsmann to score the tournament ' s opening goal and started Bolivia on its way home . Since then , seven teams have joined the Bolivians in making an early exit from the World Cup , the most notable of these being Colombia , whose decaffeinated performance was not worth a hill of beans , coffee or otherwise . That leaves 16 nations still in the running for international sport ' s most coveted trophy . By Tuesday night , that number will have been cut_in half . &quot; Now is the round it really gets going , &quot; Klinsmann said earlier this week . &quot; In the ( first-round ) matches , you tend to take_it_easy . You don ' t go_into the duels as hard because you know if you get injured you don ' t get_through the World Cup. &quot; That will not be the case in the second round . From now on , it ' s win or catch a cab for the airport . There are no more ties , no more appallingly dull , foul-plagued exhibitions such_as Thursday ' s Bulgaria-Argentina disgrace . Games that are all square at the end of 90 minutes will be extended for 30 minutes of overtime . If that doesn ' t end the tie , penalty kicks will , starting with the best of five , then going_to sudden_death . It is not the most pleasant way to be eliminated from the World Cup -- as top-notch teams such_as France , Brazil and Italy will attest , having been penalty-kick victims in the past -- but it does make_for some dramatic television . Chances are , at least one of the remaining teams will have been beaten on penalties by the time the eight second-round games are complete Tuesday . The 16 teams include four former World Cup winners -- Argentina , Brazil , Germany and Italy -- and the only four unbeaten teams after the first round of 36 matches -- Brazil , Germany , Spain and Sweden . They also include two teams -- Nigeria and Saudi_Arabia -- playing in their first World Cup and another , the United States , playing in the second round for the first time since 1930 . The pairings have produced some formidable games , not the least of which is today ' s clash between defending champion Germany and its strongest opponent to date , Belgium . &quot; They are the outgoing world champions and I know they are afraid of us , &quot; Michael D ' Hooghe , president of the Belgian soccer federation , said when the team left Brussels for the United States . &quot; We might not be stronger than others , but then again the others are not any stronger than we are , &quot; added midfielder Enzo Scifo , the Belgian captain . &quot; We can take_on any team. &quot; The Belgians proved that in the first round when they held a technically superior Dutch team scoreless in a 1-0 victory at Orlando , Fla . That , combined with a 1-0 defeat of Morocco , meant that Belgium ' s surprising 1-0 loss to Saudi_Arabia in the third game was nothing more_than that , a surprise . Perhaps the most intriguing aspects of today ' s game will be the battle between Klinsmann , who has scored four goals and needs two more to catch leading scorer Oleg Salenko of Russia , and Belgium ' s Michel Preud ' homme , far and away the best goalkeeper in the tournament so far . At the other end of the field , Belgium ' s Croatian-born striker Josip Weber , who has yet to hit full stride , will be testing the increasingly shaky German defense , which will have yet another new look now that Stefan Effenberg has been sent home_in disgrace for his sign-language message to the crowd in Dallas , where Germany clung to a 3-2 victory over South_Korea . This game could go either way and the winner will have to face nothing more fearsome than Mexico or Bulgaria in the quarterfinals . Today ' s second game , between Switzerland and Spain in Washington , is equally difficult to call . Neither team has risen to any great heights and neither has a player who has seized the tournament by the throat and made_it his own . Instead , both are fairly ordinary teams that are in the second round thanks more to the weakness of their first-round groups than to any exceptional effort on_their_own part . The inconsistent Swiss were tied by the United States in their opener while still staring at the Pontiac Silverdome roof , then humbled Romania before falling to a resurgent Colombia . Spain , meanwhile , survived the loss of team captain Miguel Angel Nadal for two games after his expulsion in the opening-day tie with South_Korea and went_on to tie Germany on an admittedly fluke goal before beating Bolivia . Sunday ' s first game pits the surprise team of the World Cup , Saudi_Arabia , against the tournament sleeper , Sweden , at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas . This will be the Swedes ' first exposure to really intense heat , their first game having been played_at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and their next two at the Silverdome . The Saudis , on the other hand , will not be overly troubled by the temperature . In Tomas Brolin and Martin Dahlin , Sweden has scorers who could break_open the game at any time . But the Saudis have speed that can stretch the Swedish defense and are sky-high after beating Belgium . Sweden ' s accomplishments have been largely overlooked . The nightmare of 1990 -- three games and three losses in Italy -- has been put to rest . A third-place finish in the 1992 European Championship and only a single loss in 10 qualifying games indicate that Coach Tommy Svensson knows exactly what he is doing . That Svensson could cook_up a game_plan to tie the hitherto unstoppable Brazilians suggests his team will be more_than the Saudis can handle . But this has been a tournament of upsets . As German Coach Berti Vogts pointed_out this week , &quot; The gap ( between teams ) is no longer as wide as it used to be. &quot; The second game Sunday easily could turn_into a repeat of Thursday night ' s fiasco . Once again , it features Argentina , a team shattered by the loss of Diego Maradona because of a failed drug test . The Argentines ' opponent at the Rose Bowl will be Romania , a team not unlike the Bulgarians but with perhaps a shade more World Cup pedigree . Romania was one of the unfortunate teams to be ousted on penalty kicks four years ago . Earlier in the 1990 tournament , it played Argentina in a cynical , foul-ridden game in Naples that ended in a 1-1 tie . The absence of Maradona normally might be enough to give the edge to Romania this time but for the fact that it too is missing a star , Florin Raducioiu , who is serving a suspension after picking_up two yellow cards in the first round . Against Bulgaria on Thursday , the_Argentines produced their usual theatrics , diving at the merest hint of a challenge , writhing about as if they had been shot and generally fooling Tunisian referee Neji Jouini , who was_well out of his depth and showed it . On one occasion , the television_camera caught forward Gabriel Batistuta spitting at a Bulgarian player . The Romanians have a chance to win Sunday ' s game and put the tournament out of its misery by sending the rest of the_Argentines home to join Maradona . But they will have to be very careful . It is unlikely that the_Argentines again will miss the scoring opportunities they squandered on Thursday . Monday brings potentially the most historic doubleheader in American soccer history -- Ireland against the_Netherlands in Orlando and the United States against Brazil in Palo Alto . The Florida Citrus Bowl was a sea of green when the_Irish played there in the first round and awash in orange when the Dutch came_to town . What it will look_like with both teams ' fans there staggers the imagination . Bring sunglasses . It will be hot , it will be humid , it will be fiercely fought and it very well could be decided on penalty kicks . When Ireland and Holland met in Palermo in the first round of the 1990 tournament , the Dutch took an early lead and continued to attack while the_Irish defended and eventually earned a tying goal late in the game . That pattern will be repeated . But two elements will be missing Monday -- the two scorers from 1990 , Holland ' s Ruud Gullit and Ireland ' s Niall Quinn . The 1-1 tie four years ago also produced something else that the Dutch , in particular , will want to erase from their memory . Because of the tie , the teams had to draw straws to see which finished second in the group and which finished third . Ireland won , went_on to play Romania and eventually reached the quarterfinals . Holland lost , had to play West Germany and was ousted . Both teams have suffered in the Florida heat , but Ireland Coach Jack Charlton has complained about it a lot more_than the_Netherlands ' Dick Advocaat . The Irish are playing to the best of their ability , whereas the Dutch have yet to fulfill their considerable promise . Dennis Bergkamp should have been challenging for the scoring title by now , but he has only one goal . The Dutch will find the_Irish defense every bit as difficult to penetrate as the Belgian defense was , but it seems unlikely that they can create as_many chances as they did_in that game and again come_away empty-handed . The fans , meanwhile , could be Ireland ' s secret weapon . The Dutch have their outrageous costumes and their brass_band in the stands , but the_Irish fans are every bit as passionate in their support . &quot; They make a difference , &quot; Irish goalkeeper Pat Bonner said . &quot; They enjoy themselves . They ' re not there probably having too_much expectation . They ' re there just to enjoy themselves and so far everything ' s gone well for them . It ' s a big holiday for them. &quot; Also wanting to celebrate another kind of holiday -- Independence_Day -- the Americans travel_to Palo Alto knowing they have never beaten Brazil and if they do so they will have taken the most attractive and popular team out of the tournament . The United States ' victory over Colombia was a tremendous and unforgettable achievement , but a victory over Brazil would make_it pale into insignificance by comparison . But it ' s not going_to happen . Brazil is an altogether different team than Colombia . Whereas Colombia was predictable , Brazil is innovative . Improvisation is the hallmark of Brazilian players , who can be counted_on to do the unexpected . Colombia attacked down the middle and only down the middle . Brazil will attack from every position on the field . If the ball is in the Americans ' half , watch_out . This is not the best Brazilian team ever assembled and even Pele has pointed_out what he regards_as deficiencies in its starting lineup , but in terms of raw_talent , it stands head and shoulders above the U.S. squad . U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic has achieved his miracle for 1994 and should be able to rest_on his laurels for another four years . This World Cup has Brazil ' s name stamped on it and no amount of American pluck , grit , determination , work or even luck is going_to erase that . Not even on the Fourth_of_July . Six years to the day after being awarded the World Cup , the United States will see it taken_away . The loss of the United States from the tournament need not necessarily be the end of North_American involvement in the World Cup , however . One Tuesday , the final pair of second-round games includes Mexico playing Bulgaria in a match it very easily could win . Before that , however , there is the intriguing prospect of Nigeria-Italy at Foxboro Stadium near Boston . The Italians have come and seen but they have not conquered . Scraping into the second round as a third-place team is not what Coach Arrigo Sacchi had_in_mind when he set_out for the New World , and the Italian press has let him know its feelings in no uncertain words . It is difficult to pinpoint Italy ' s troubles , but an inability to function as a team seems to be foremost . The players all have individual skills and their experience playing in the toughest league in the world is evident . But there is no joy to the Italians ' game , no free-flowing movement of the ball , no inspiration from those who should inspire , especially Roberto Baggio . It is as if the players are merely going_through the motions . Against Nigeria , they will have to do_better than that . Coach Clemens Westerhof stated flatly before the tournament that Nigeria ' s goal in 1994 was to do_better than Cameroon had done_in 1990 . Since Cameroon reached the quarterfinals , Nigeria will have to defeat Italy on Tuesday to have a shot at that goal . It is not beyond the bounds of possibility , and with nothing more_than Spain or Switzerland facing the winner , even a place in the semifinals is within reach . Somehow , though , it just seems time for the Italians to awaken and impose themselves on the tournament . Finally , there is Mexico . It plays badly depleted Bulgaria in the last second-round game at Giants Stadium . History is_on Mexico ' s side . The teams met in the second round of the 1986 World Cup and Mexico won , 2-0 , in a game that featured one of the great World Cup goals of all time -- a scissors_kick by Manuel Negrete that brought awed the crowd of 114 # 580 . The Bulgarians have been collecting yellow cards by the barrow load and will be minus the services of several key players . Two who will be there , however , are forward Hristo Stoichkov , whose three goals leave him in striking distance of the scoring title , and midfielder Krasimir Balakov , the team ' s most talented player . If Coach Miguel Mejia Baron ' s team can stifle those two , and if forward Luis Garcia can retain his scoring touch and if goalkeeper Jorge Campos can keep luck on his side and if . . . . But the second round of the World Cup is always full of ifs , and the only sure thing is that in four days the eight quarterfinalists will be known . The stage is set . There ' s no need for Oprah . In the next few days , eight teams will find a way to trip themselves .</TEXT>
