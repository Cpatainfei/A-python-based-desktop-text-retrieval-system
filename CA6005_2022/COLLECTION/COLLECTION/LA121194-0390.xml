   <HEADLINE> BLINDSIDED / ORANGE COUNTY ' S FINANCIAL CRISIS ; LESSONS FROM THE PAST : THE NEW YORK CRISIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1975 , the nation ' s largest city teetered on the brink of bankruptcy . The causes of the worst fiscal crisis in New York since the Great Depression were cumulative , and the rescue almost two decades ago brought_together an extraordinary coalition of government officials , banks , union leaders and the Wall_Street investment community . Much of the machinery , born in the crucible of crisis , remains to ensure a cliffhanger like it never happens again . An important thing to remember is that New York never got as far as filing for bankruptcy , but it came_close . What were the lessons learned ? For anyone who might have been watching , the New York debacle provides a cautionary tale for Orange County ' s high-rolling public financiers . HOW IT HAPPENED Known as Fun City , New York had an economy thoughout most of the 1960s that outpaced the booming U.S. economy . Amid the wealth , spending was immense and financial controls were lax . That set the stage for what happened next : * In 1969 , a prolonged recession sets_in . But as revenues shrink , spending for social_services continues to grow . * The city increases taxes , but it is a temporary solution . Municipal officials begin to rely_on short- and long-term financing gimmicks . * The city begins to use long-term bond sales , in_effect borrowing money to fund operating expenditures . Officials also start selling short-term revenue anticipation notes . When there isn ' t enough money to pay_back the notes , the city rolls them over at ever-higher interest_rates . * By 1975 , New York needs to borrow $ 6 billion in short-term debt at ever-increasing rates . At the same time , Wall_Street sours on the city . One sad day , there are simply no bids from the investment banking community to further roll_over New York ' s debt . * Bond_rating agencies sharply downgrade the city ' s paper , effectively slamming the door on city financing . * Frenzy overtakes city government . State and city officials scramble to pay workers . Record keeping is so sloppy that no one knows how many employees are_on they city payroll . One city official finds shoeboxes containing billions of dollars ' worth of negotiable securities in a closet . * The crisis deepens . Then-President Gerald Ford turns_down a request for $ 1.5 billion in short-term federal loans . CLIMBING OUT OF THE HOLE The once wealthy enclave starts living hand to mouth . Here are the steps involved in New York ' s gradual recovery : * The state of New York assumes the cost of key functions like the court system and some welfare payments . * The municipal work_force is reduced . * Just about all capital spending by the city ceases . Badly needed repairs on such vital structures as roads and bridges and the subways are suspended -- to be resumed many years later as deterioration mounts . * Short-term debt is rolled_over into long-term debt by a newly created Municipal Assistance Corp. , with payments based on the city ' s sales tax . The city borrows $ 1.6 billion from union pension_funds , and the Administration of Democratic President Jimmy_Carter -- elected in 1976 -- provides loan guarantees . AFTER THE CRISIS Fallout from the debacle contines to this day . The most enduring legacy remains a series of oversight organizations that still scrutinize city finances . Among the safeguards : * New York City must update its budget four times a year and issue four-year financial plans . * A Financial Control_Board , with representatives from the governor , the state controller and the city controller plus public members , oversees debt . It sounds the alarm when revenue projections are off course . * A special New York State deputy controller also guards the city ' s finances . &quot; You can ' t finance yourself out of structural problems . You have to change the way the system works. &quot; -Raymond D . Horton , president of the Citizens Budget Commission Inc. a private watchdog group and a veteran of the budget crisis .</TEXT>
