   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN CONSERVATIVE GAINS FROM REFORMERS ' FAILURES ; POLITICS : AS PRIME_MINISTER CHERNOMYRDIN ' S POWER STRENGTHENS , HOPE FOR A WESTERN-STYLE ECONOMY FADES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When it comes_to charisma , he ' s no match for Boris N . Yeltsin or Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky . He sat_out last month ' s parliamentary elections , quietly supporting two parties that finished far back . His job performance in 1993 , his first year as head of the Cabinet , was just as mediocre : The economy shrank 14 % ; prices shot_up 900 % . Yet Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin has gained more clout than any other figure from Russia ' s recent political upheavals . As President Yeltsin comes_to resemble an aloof constitutional monarch , and Zhirinovsky ' s populist tantrums start to bore fellow lawmakers , Chernomyrdin is shaping a far more conservative government in his own gray , managerial image . The 55-year-old prime_minister , who once ran the Soviet gas industry , took the initiative after free-market candidates close to Yeltsin fared poorly in the parliamentary vote . While two reform economists quit the Cabinet last week and Yeltsin kept silent , Chernomyrdin announced a new lineup and a new mandate -- no more Western-style monetarist reform at the expense of production . &quot; What sort of reforms can one talk_about at a time when huge enterprises come_to a standstill ? &quot; he asked . &quot; No matter how progressive it might be , no theory can by itself salvage a huge country from shortages of food , energy and commodities . . . . If we fail to boost production , we will fail to salvage the emerging market economy. &quot; Chernomyrdin is convinced that the state must return to a bigger role in the economy , supporting heavy industry and collective agriculture -- unprofitable stalwarts of the failed Soviet system . How far he can go_in slowing the reformers ' 2-year-old effort to shrink the state -- or in reviving a central-command economy -- remains to be seen . It is unclear , for example , whether Boris G . Fyodorov , the strict-monetarist finance_minister who quit Thursday , is really out . Amid signs of unease in the West , Chernomyrdin asked him Saturday to stay but refused his demand for more authority in the Cabinet . Fyodorov said he will press his case in a meeting with Yeltsin this week . It ' s also worth remembering that Chernomyrdin serves at Yeltsin ' s pleasure . If the prime_minister tries his statist approach and it fails , the president has a constitutional right to fire him . But Russian politics is more complex . As Yeltsin has retreated from the details of government , Chernomyrdin has spread his influence throughout the Russian bureaucracy . He is far more confident , and much less malleable , today than the awkward , mumbling , seemingly transitional figure who became prime_minister 13 months ago . &quot; Before our very eyes , power is shifting from Yeltsin to Chernomyrdin , &quot; said Mikhail Berger , a columnist for the newspaper Izvestia . &quot; Maybe with the president ' s consent or maybe without it , but that is what ' s happening. &quot; People who know Chernomyrdin say two life experiences define him . First , he ' s a consummate apparatchik . A street-fighting village kid from Russia ' s Orenburg region , he finished high_school with a C-minus average and flunked math in a technical institute entrance exam . But thanks to army and party connections , he got a degree and moved_up the Communist ladder , rising from machine operator at an oil_refinery to a Central Committee post . Second , that career ladder passed_through the gas industry , still the most regulated sector of the Russian economy . He became Soviet gas minister in 1985 and turned the ministry into a profitable state corporation , earning a third of Russia ' s export revenue . The experience gave him only a narrow understanding of economics and a strong bias toward state control . A gruff , heavy-set man prone to wisecracks and foul language , Chernomyrdin shares Yeltsin ' s earthy , muzhik image and Communist background . He won Yeltsin ' s admiration -- and a post in the Cabinet -- by giving a better speech at a 1992 gas seminar than the pro-reform government economist in_charge of that sector . In December , 1992 , with living standards falling and reformers in retreat , Yeltsin named him prime_minister , replacing acting premier Yegor T . Gaidar , the brains behind the reforms . At Yeltsin ' s insistence , Chernomyrdin kept most of Gaidar ' s team around him and brought_in Fyodorov to control the money_supply . Gradually , however , Chernomyrdin became his own man . His ministry ballooned to more_than 1 # 000 bureaucrats , taking from other agencies such powers as export licensing . He boosted his own political standing by touring the country with pork-barrel promises , then dumping on Fyodorov for refusing to pay_for them . &quot; Chernomyrdin has a keen sense of power , but no sense for policy , &quot; said Swedish economist Anders Aslund , an adviser to Fyodorov . A Western official who meets with the prime_minister added : &quot; He doesn ' t understand that ruling the country means making some people unhappy . He wants to please everyone. &quot; As Russia slid toward violent civil conflict last fall , Chernomyrdin wisely chose to back Yeltsin against the Soviet-era Parliament , then stayed out of the fractious Dec . 12 elections of a new one . With his nod , the state gas_company helped finance two centrist parties -- Future of Russia-New Names and the Russian Party of Unity and Concord . Together they got 9 % of the vote . Luckily for Chernomyrdin , no party gained a majority . In part because Yeltsin didn ' t want a fight with Parliament over a new nominee , Chernomyrdin kept his post as a compromise between Gaidar ' s Russia ' s Choice on one side and the Communists and Zhirinovsky ' s ultranationalists on the other . Reading the vote as a mandate against reformers , Chernomyrdin muscled out Gaidar , who had rejoined the Cabinet in September , and stripped Fyodorov of his deputy prime_minister rank . He brought_in two ex-Soviet economic advisers , Nikolai Petrakov and Leonid Abalkin , to modify the plan they wrote for Civic Union , a centrist party led by factory bosses with little voter support . &quot; The return of these men means the return of administer-by-command economy , &quot; economist and Yeltsin adviser Pavel G . Bunich said . &quot; The Civic Union lost the elections , but they have won the government. &quot; Chernomyrdin told reporters last week that he will make_good on $ 5 billion worth of promised credits to money-losing farms and defense plants , doubling the first-quarter budget_deficit . To hold_down inflation , he offered to try such &quot; non-monetary &quot; methods as wage and price_controls . He also expressed support for a currency union with Belarus , which critics say will cost Russia $ 1.4 billion . Many economists believe that Chernomyrdin simply doesn ' t understand the inflationary consequences of such mega-spending and may be leading Yeltsin , who also has little grasp of economics , toward disaster . A cartoon in Izvestia illustrates that view . It shows Chernomyrdin piggyback on Yeltsin , cupping his hands like horse blinders to narrow the president ' s vision . Yeltsin is staggering in circles , declaring , &quot; We will not stray from the path of reforms ! &quot; Andrei Ostroukh , a reporter in The Times ' Moscow Bureau , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
