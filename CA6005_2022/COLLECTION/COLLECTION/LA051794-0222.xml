   <HEADLINE> NEW ITALIAN PREMIER WOOS LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Appealing for a parliamentary vote_of_confidence , rookie Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Monday promised Italians a fairer , more open and efficient government based on free-market economics and political dialogue . The billionaire media tycoon , who entered politics earlier this year , must win confirming votes from both houses for his new conservative government . His coalition , built around federalist and neo-fascist allies , has a clear majority in the Chamber of Deputies but not in the Senate , which votes Wednesday . Addressing the Senate on Monday , the entrepreneur presented a government plan that he said would create &quot; a freer , fairer and more modern Italy. &quot; He said his coalition embodies &quot; the unity and indivisibility &quot; of the country , a clear reference_to fears awakened by his government partners from the Northern League , who sometimes speak_of federalizing Italy into three regional republics . &quot; Judge this government on facts , not prejudice , &quot; he urged . He said his own reputation and the checks and balances built into the constitution should reassure critics who worry about potential conflicts_of_interest between his official role and his vast business empire . In his 55-minute maiden address , the 57-year-old Berlusconi also pledged to combat &quot; racism , xenophobia and anti-Semitism. &quot; On a get-acquainted visit to Brussels over the weekend , Antonio Martino , Italy ' s new foreign_minister , was careful to assure Italy ' s European Union partners that there are no Mussolini-style fascists in the Berlusconi government . Italy ' s commitment to the EU , the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and the Helsinki accords on human_rights will be cornerstones of his foreign_policy , Berlusconi told the 315 elected and 11 life senators . Berlusconi ' s Forza Italia ( Go Italy ) , the Northern League of Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist National Alliance of Gianfranco Fini are a_few votes short of the 164 they will need Wednesday if all senators vote . Berlusconi , sworn_in last week after victory in March , expects to win enough supporting votes from centrist senators to win the mandatory confidence . Inaugurating the 53rd Italian government since World_War_II and the first in which the now-shattered Christian Democrats sit in the opposition , Berlusconi won a standing_ovation with a pledge to continue the government ' s anti-Mafia crackdown , personified by two Sicilian magistrates who were murdered for their crusade against organized_crime . He urged Italians to overcome pessimism induced by the corruption scandals because &quot; universal skepticism risks turning_into a subtle and lethal poison. &quot; On the economic front , Berlusconi told senators , his government will pursue an ongoing program to privatize telecommunications , electricity , energy and insurance giants now in government hands . It will jump-start a sluggish economy by encouraging investment , he said , promising new jobs and reform of what he called a &quot; pathological &quot; confusion of taxes .</TEXT>
