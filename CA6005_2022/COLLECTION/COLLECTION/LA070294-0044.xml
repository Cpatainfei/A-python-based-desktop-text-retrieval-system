   <HEADLINE> CLINTON BARELY AVERTS REBUKE ON BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration , under continuing congressional criticism for its handling of foreign_policy , narrowly averted a major rebuke in the Senate on Friday when it defeated legislation that would have required the lifting of the Yugoslav arms embargo . The Senate split 50-50 over a Republican measure that would have directed President Clinton to ignore the United Nations and end U.S. participation in the almost 3-year-old embargo , which many have criticized , saying it has hamstrung the Muslim-led government from defending Bosnia-Herzegovina from Serbian nationalist aggression . Although the tie defeated the measure -- a majority was required for approval -- its near success underscored the persistent unease among lawmakers over Clinton ' s handling of Bosnia and other foreign_policy trouble spots . A tie vote on an issue &quot; of such importance is a ' no ' vote-of-confidence , &quot; said Sen . Richard G . Lugar ( R-Ind. ) , a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who voted to end the embargo . &quot; The message here , &quot; added Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) , who opposed the measure , &quot; is that the Senate does not agree by a very large majority with the Bosnian arms embargo &quot; and remains split only over &quot; the consequences of lifting it unilaterally. &quot; With Clinton personally working the phones to sway wavering senators and his Senate allies delaying the vote until one Democrat could rush back from his home state , the arms embargo dominated debate over a $ 263.3-billion defense bill that the Senate was struggling to complete before adjourning for its July 4 recess . In other votes , the Senate decided by a margin of 55-45 to retain the option of building more B-2 Stealth bombers and agreed by an overwhelming margin , 88-12 , to move_up by six months the date on which military retirees receive cost-of-living increases in their pensions . But it was the Bosnia issue that provided the drama as the Administration worked feverishly to avert a highly embarrassing foreign_policy setback just days before Clinton embarks on an overseas trip for economic talks with European leaders . The House , by a decisive 244-178 margin , attached an almost identical Bosnia amendment to the version of the defense bill that it passed earlier this month . A similar move by the Senate could have sent the measure to the President ' s desk -- forcing him either to lift the embargo or cast the first veto of his presidency . Vetoing the defense bill , several Democrats noted privately , would have been especially embarrassing for Clinton , given his record of avoiding military_service in the Vietnam_War . With the stakes so high , Clinton personally spoke with several Democrats who were leaning toward supporting the Bosnia amendment , sponsored by Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) and Sen . Joseph I . Lieberman ( D-Conn. ) . Other senior officials , including Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , joined the effort , working the phones and offices of wavering Democrats as Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) maneuvered to postpone the vote to give them more time . In the end , three Democrats who had been expected to vote with Dole -- Sens . Richard H . Bryan and Harry Reid of Nevada and Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado -- switched sides . In all , 37 Republicans and 13 Democrats voted to lift the embargo , while 43 Democrats and seven Republicans voted against it . California Democrat Barbara Boxer voted with Dole ; Democrat Dianne Feinstein sided with the President . &quot; We really went_to the brink this time and almost didn ' t make_it , &quot; a Democratic aide involved in the behind-the-scenes machinations confided . &quot; There is a lot of disaffection , among Democrats as well as Republicans , with Clinton ' s foreign_policy and with Bosnia in particular , and a lot of them kept saying they wanted to vote with Dole to communicate that disaffection to the White House. &quot; It was not the first time that the Senate has been at this particular brink , however . Last May , it voted , 50-49 , to pass a similar Dole amendment . But still deeply divided over what course to follow in Bosnia , the Senate mixed its message then by also voting , by an identical 50-49 margin , to urge Clinton to lift the embargo only in consultation with U.S. allies . In the end , that earlier , self-contradicting resolution -- which had no companion in the House -- went nowhere . But this time the stakes were higher , both because the House had since passed its own legislation and because senators were expressing increasing frustration with the embargo . Imposed in September , 1991 , the embargo was adopted by the U.N. Security_Council in a bid to contain the bitter fighting among Muslims , Serbs and Croats in the Balkans . But it has been widely criticized for preserving the advantage enjoyed at the outset of the conflict by the better-armed Serbs as they pressed their campaign of &quot; ethnic cleansing , &quot; especially against Bosnia ' s beleaguered Muslim-dominated government . While the Administration agrees with that assessment , it has resisted growing congressional calls to lift the Balkans embargo without the consent of its European allies and Russia , saying such unilateral action might imperil other , key international efforts , such_as the Iraqi sanctions . Christopher , testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the eve of the Bosnia vote , said that lifting the embargo at this time would also have a devastating effect on the efforts now under way to find a peaceful solution to the Bosnian crisis . In Geneva next week , Christopher and the foreign_ministers of Russia and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization are to complete a new plan for the partition of Bosnia and present it to the warring factions . The Senate debate showed that Bosnia ' s supporters in Congress remain highly skeptical of the still sketchy plan .</TEXT>
