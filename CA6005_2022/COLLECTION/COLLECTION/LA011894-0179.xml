   <HEADLINE> SEPARATISTS WIN BIG IN CRIMEA VOTE ; UKRAINE : CANDIDATES WHO FAVOR INDEPENDENCE OR REJOINING RUSSIA GET 73 % OF PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTS . SHOWING COULD DERAIL NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT PACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a development that could inflame Russian-Ukrainian relations and derail the nuclear disarmament agreement that President Clinton signed_in Moscow last week , Crimean separatists have scored a stunning electoral victory in the peninsula ' s first presidential elections . Five candidates who want the strategic Black_Sea outpost to seek independence from Ukraine -- or to rejoin Russia -- won a total of 73 % of the vote , according to preliminary results Monday . A nearly unknown candidate who was backed by Russian neo-fascist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky and who had promised to defend the interests of the Russian majority in Crimea won 13.5 % of the vote . By contrast , the former Communist boss who supports keeping Crimea an autonomous republic within Ukraine won only 17.5 % . Because no candidate received a majority , a runoff will be held Jan . 30 , with separatist candidate Yuri Meshkov favored to become the new president of the region . Last week , Russian and U.S. officials said they feared a secessionist movement in Crimea could pit Ukrainian nationalists against Russian extremists . Such a conflict could torpedo the agreement that calls_for Ukraine to give_up its nuclear_weapons in exchange for guarantees that Russia will respect Ukraine ' s existing borders , which include Crimea . &quot; that ' s the nightmare scenario -- for everybody , &quot; a senior U.S. official said . The issue is so touchy that Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s press secretary , Vyacheslav V . Kostikov , refused to accept a question last week about Crimea ' s possible impact on the disarmament deal . &quot; You ' ll put our president in a very awkward position if you ask this question , &quot; Kostikov said . &quot; You must understand that this is an explosive issue. &quot; The lovely , subtropical Crimean peninsula juts smack into the center of the Black_Sea , making_it a geopolitical prize that has been fought over for centuries . But though populated by about 105 different ethnic_groups , it was considered Russian territory until Moscow gave it to the Ukrainian Soviet_Socialist_Republic in 1954 to celebrate &quot; Ukrainian-Russian friendship. &quot; Crimean restiveness was evident even before Ukraine achieved independence from the Soviet_Union . In January , 1991 , Crimeans voted for autonomy , and on May 5 , 1992 , while Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was_on a visit to the United States , the peninsula declared independence . Crimea quickly rescinded the declaration after the Russian Supreme Soviet declared the 1954 transfer of Crimea to Ukraine unconstitutional . Russians make_up 68 % of the 2.5 million residents , and Ukrainians , at 28 % , consider themselves an embattled minority . But 83 % of all residents -- including Ukrainians -- say Russian is their native language -- and many see in Russia a prosperous homeland . Opinion polls taken_in August -- polling has since been banned -- found that 62 % of Crimeans wanted some kind of reunion with Russia . Some secessionists are Russian military families in Sevastopol , while others are retirees who long for the re-establishment of the Soviet_Union . Meanwhile , more_than 200 # 000 ethnic Tatars , deported by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in 1944 for allegedly collaborating with the Germans , have returned from exile in Uzbekistan and are camped_out in tents and shantytowns . Tatar leaders , wary of Russia , want Crimea to remain part of Ukraine . They have supported Nikolai Bugrov , the former Communist boss who is now Speaker of the new Crimean Parliament . Bugrov placed second with 17.5 % of the vote ; separatist Meshkov , head of the Crimean Republican_Party and of the Russian Society , got 38.5 % . &quot; Meshkov is an extremist , &quot; said Vasyl Bohutsky , director of Crimea ' s only Ukrainian-language newspaper , &quot; Crimean Chamber. &quot; &quot; He has said that his first act_as president would be to hold a referendum on joining Russia. &quot; Like many Ukrainians , Bohutsky believes that a separatist victory could bring armed conflict . &quot; People are poor and angry , &quot; he said . &quot; Just throw_in a match and it will explode. &quot; Since November , two politicians have been killed , two beaten and the Tatar movement ' s headquarters bombed with Molotov_cocktails . The paramilitary Ukrainian National Self-Defense group is reportedly preparing_for conflict . U.S. officials note that by signing the agreement on Ukraine ' s nuclear_weapons Friday , Yeltsin has renewed Russia ' s commitment to respect Ukraine ' s borders . But Russian parliamentarian Zhirinovsky ' s ideal map of Russia includes both Ukraine and Crimea . &quot; We will protect Russian people wherever they are , &quot; Zhirinovsky said last week , endorsing the separatist leader of the Russian Party of the Crimea , Sergei Shuvainikov , for president . Such rhetoric awakens Ukrainians ' worst fear : Russia meddling in Crimean ethnic strife . Kravchuk , who is trying to persuade the Ukrainian Parliament to give_up nuclear_weapons , has argued that Ukraine faces no outside military threat . Violence in the Crimea could weaken his case . Efron , of The Times ' Moscow bureau , reported from Kiev and Moscow .</TEXT>
