   <HEADLINE> 3 TRIBES ALLOWED TO KEEP VIDEO SLOT_MACHINES UNTIL COURT RULES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three area Indian tribes have struck an unprecedented deal with the U.S. attorney here , allowing them to keep controversial slot-style gambling machines for now if they agree to hand them over if a court rules against them . The tribes pledged not to expand their casinos without approval from the courts . In return , U.S. Atty . Alan Bersin promised not to confiscate the tribes ' electronic gaming devices , which resemble slot_machines . California officials consider the devices illegal . And they were leery of the deal worked_out Thursday between the tribes and Bersin . &quot; The state ' s position is clear . You have to have ( permission ) from the state to offer video gambling , &quot; said the state_attorney general ' s spokesman Dave Puglia . &quot; The Supreme Court has affirmed that . &quot; The agreement described doesn ' t seem consistent with that. &quot; The pacts were struck with the Barona , Viejas and Sycuan reservations in San Diego County , all_of which offer Las Vegas-style video gaming . Currently , the tribes are subject_to conflicting federal and state regulations . Court decisions have said clearly that tribes need state permission to offer Las Vegas-style gambling . California officials have refused to grant that permission or to discuss the issue , even though courts have ordered the state to negotiate . At the same time , courts have ruled that only federal authorities can regulate or police Indian gambling . Several conflicting decisions surrounding the issue are now being appealed . Rulings in the next six months could clarify the situation . Bersin said Gov . Pete Wilson , who strongly opposes Indian gambling , should welcome the deal because it puts the tribes on record as agreeing to remove their machines if they lose in court . By freezing operations , the deal also lays the groundwork for removing the machines if courts rule against the Indians , he said . San Diego ' s tribal casinos have about 2 # 000 of the machines . They have proved a cash_cow for the once poverty-stricken tribes . Tribal leaders , almost gleeful at Bersin ' s appearance on their reservations Thursday , called the deal a watershed in Indian-government relations . &quot; No U.S. attorney has ever come here before , &quot; said Anthony Pico , chairman of the Viejas band of Mission Indians .</TEXT>
