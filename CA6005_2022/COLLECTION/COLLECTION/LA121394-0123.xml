   <HEADLINE> RELATIONSHIPS / ORANGE COUNTY : FOR SOME , HOLIDAYS ARE A SEASON OF LOSS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Denise Crofton ' s only child passed_away 3 1 / 2 years ago , she felt as if she died with her 18-year-old daughter , Alexa . Since that tragic day in May , 1991 , Crofton has found all holidays , except her daughter ' s birthday , impossible to celebrate . &quot; Christmas was always a wonderful time for us , but without Alexa , my husband and I just can ' t handle the festivities . It ' s too painful , &quot; says Crofton , 46 , who moved from Orange County to San Diego after her daughter ' s death . &quot; Even though we know Alexa would want us to celebrate , we just can ' t . We don ' t decorate , send_out Christmas_cards or go_into the stores during the holidays , &quot; she says . Although the holiday season is supposed to be a time of joy , comfort and fellowship with loved ones , it can be an emotionally difficult time for individuals who have lost a loved one , says Costa Mesa marriage , family , child counselor Elizabeth Slocum . &quot; People are acutely aware of the fact that they no longer buy a present for the deceased_person and that there is an empty chair at the dinner_table , &quot; she says , adding that holidays trigger feelings of grief and loss . How deeply the loss is felt during the holiday season depends_on a number of things , including who the loved one was , how he or she died and how far along a person is in the grieving process . &quot; The bereavement process is often more difficult for the person who lost a loved one suddenly , and if the deceased is his or her child . That can take a lifetime to get_over , &quot; says Slocum . &quot; Every Christmas , parents can ' t help but think_of what could have been. &quot; Denise Crofton says that it ' s too painful to think_about what life could have been like for her pretty , athletic , outgoing daughter . &quot; When we see babies , it kills us to know that we ' ll never be grandparents and our daughter will never be married , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s very difficult to think_about , so we try not to. &quot; The Croftons find the holiday season as painful today as it was the first November and December they spent without her . &quot; Our first Thanksgiving we went_to a coffee_shop at 4 in the afternoon for turkey , dressed in terrible , dirty sweats . That first Christmas we drove through the Pacific Northwest and spent Christmas morning in a hotel_room holding onto each other and crying , &quot; she says . Subsequent holidays haven ' t been any easier for the Croftons . &quot; We thought the pain would soften , but it hasn ' t , &quot; she says . Crofton ' s daughter , Alexa , was found to have incurable adrenal cancer in late January , 1991 , and died less than four months later at St . Joseph Hospital in Orange . Although she had been suffering from a variety of symptoms since her senior year in high_school , doctors didn ' t diagnose her condition until she became seriously ill and returned home during her first year at college in Indiana . By the time doctors removed the tumor in her left adrenal_gland , the cancer had spread throughout her body . Despite doubts , she did survive surgery and spent the next few weeks in and out of the hospital until she told her mother she loved her and died in her father ' s arms May 27 , 1991 . Since their daughter ' s death , the Croftons have received many invitations to friends ' houses for the holidays , but they always decline . &quot; It is too difficult for us to celebrate the holidays , &quot; says John Crofton , 54 , who retired in 1985 from an executive position with a fast-food restaurant_chain to spend more time with his daughter . &quot; The void is tremendous , &quot; he says . &quot; We had it so good and now we can ' t have it , so why bother watching another family celebrate ? I suppose there ' s a little bit of jealousy involved. &quot; John Crofton looks_back fondly on their last Christmas together , which was a little more_than a month before Alexa ' s cancer was diagnosed . &quot; We normally open presents in the morning with the entire extended family , but that particular Christmas we decided to open them on Christmas_Eve , just the three of us . Alexa really enjoyed that , &quot; he says . Although they won ' t celebrate , remembering their daughter during the holiday season is important to the Croftons . &quot; We talk_about Alexa and the good times we shared , &quot; says John Crofton . &quot; Whenever something triggers a memory , we ' ll share it with each other and other people . We are very open_to hearing from her friends as well. &quot; People who have lost someone like to talk_about the person and like others to mention him or her , says Denise Crofton . &quot; I love it when people say her name , &quot; she says . &quot; The more people mention Alexa and talk_about her , the more therapeutic it is for me . The absolute worst would be if she was forgotten. &quot; Thirty friends visited Alexa in the hospital the day before she died and there were 750 to 800 people at her funeral . Even though she ' d only attended college in Indiana for one semester , 100 people showed_up at her memorial service there . &quot; I miss Alexa tons , &quot; says Erin Marlin , 21 , who was close friends with Alexa for four years before she died . &quot; She was a wonderful person who was beautiful inside and out . She didn ' t dislike anyone or talk bad about people . She was always happy and laughing and made me feel good , even when I was in a bad mood. &quot; Marlin was a year younger than Alexa and met her through friends at Foothill High_School in Tustin . &quot; We clicked and became the best of friends really fast , &quot; says Marlin . &quot; We ' d spend the summers and holiday breaks together and stay_up until all hours of the night talking . I trusted her completely. &quot; When Alexa became sick so quickly , Marlin found the experience very difficult . &quot; I was so frightened for her when she was_sick , &quot; she says . &quot; When she passed_away , it felt_like someone had torn the insides out of me . All I wanted to do was lay_in bed and cry. &quot; Since her death , Marlin has found the holiday season difficult to celebrate . &quot; In my house , we have a Hanukkah dinner and invite our friends , but it ' s difficult , because my best_friend isn ' t able to be there with me , &quot; says Marlin . Although Marlin usually doesn ' t pray aloud in temple , she always says a mourner ' s kaddish for Alexa . &quot; I say the prayer with her in mind every time , and then I read a poem in the prayer_book about life and death , &quot; says Marlin . &quot; That calms me and makes me remember all_the good times we shared. &quot;</TEXT>
