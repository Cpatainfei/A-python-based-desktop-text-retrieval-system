   <HEADLINE> AMERICA FROM ABROAD ; DEPARTING GIS can ' t STOP THE MUSIC ; SOMALIS LOVE U.S. ROCK ' N ' ROLL , BUT WASHINGTON ' S POLICIES ARE ANOTHER MATTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the rickety stalls of Mogadishu ' s Bakara market , in the heart of the neighborhood where 18 U.S. Army Rangers were killed and dozens more wounded in the most intense firefight involving U.S. troops since Vietnam , the hottest-selling items in the final days of the U.S. deployment were cassette_tapes of American rock ' n ' roll . They were pirate tapes_recorded from Armed Forces Radio_broadcasts here during the 15 months that U.S. soldiers took the lead role in the U.N. mission to feed , pacify and rebuild war-torn Somalia . And they were recorded by some of the same clan militiamen who shot down U.S. helicopters , held an American pilot hostage , blew_up passing Army patrols and ambushed Marines on the streets . &quot; We love American music -- you know , Guns ' N Roses , man , &quot; one of the militiamen , who identified himself only as Abdi , told me as the U.S. presence drew to a close this month . &quot; Hey , we even like your soldiers . Very tough . Very strong . In fact , we like America . It ' s the American policy that was wrong. &quot; It was a poignant image that caught the ambivalence of so many Somalis toward the people who came_to save them from starvation , killed hundreds of Somalis in armed combat , lost dozens of_their_own soldiers in the process and finally chose to leave rather than risk losing any more . As the U.S. military_mission approached its scheduled departure Friday , America ' s image in this still-ruined land seemed to run the gamut from the militiaman ' s love for rock ' n ' roll , to respect for the foreign soldiers he fought so hard to drive_out of town , to the satisfaction of his leaders that the Americans were finally going_home . On a night when hundreds of U.S. troops left Mogadishu ' s harbor in early March in a high-security naval withdrawal , scores of Somalis packed into an open-air theater to watch the movie &quot; Patton. &quot; It was the largest crowd the theater ' s owner could remember since the Marines landed here in December , 1992 . There was even a smattering of applause when a mammoth American flag filled the screen . On the higher political level , there was enduring anger -- particularly from the leadership of former Somali Gen . Mohammed Farah Aidid ' s Somali National Alliance , which declared war on the United States and the United Nations when Aidid and his men became convinced the foreign forces were trying to marginalize their party and their clan . &quot; Before they came , I had a different concept of America , &quot; said Abdul Karim Ahmed Ali , secretary_general and spokesman for Aidid ' s party . &quot; From childhood , I thought America is the most democratic country in the world after England . When I grew_up , I changed my mind . I thought America was the most democratic country . &quot; But when they arrived here , things went the opposite . They immediately started marginalizing us -- supporting our rivals . Now I believe the policy of the American government and the feelings of the American people are different . And this is a contradiction I can no longer understand. &quot; For Ahmed Ali , there ' s a personal dimension . In January , during one of the last U.S. troop convoys through Mogadishu ' s streets , his eldest son was accidentally caught in a cross-fire and shot in the stomach , he said . &quot; Now , of course , I wish they had never come_to Somalia . My son would be healthy now. &quot; But outside of politics , and at the grass roots of what ' s left of Somali society , the view was far different . There was an almost universal gratitude for the initial Marine intervention that helped break a war-induced cycle of famine . Most Somalis appear to believe that the intervention saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of their compatriots . &quot; If President Bush hadn ' t sent the Marines in , I think 50 % of the Somali people would have died , &quot; said former Somali Gen . Mohamed Nur Galal . &quot; What is not clear to me now is what kind of policy America has_on Somalia . The U.S. Congress is saying , ' We have no interest in Somalia. ' And I see the U.S. ambassador here , and he tells me the United States is going_to stay involved in this country and they are going_to still support the U.N. &quot; I just don ' t understand this . It ' s all very strange to me. &quot; It ' s less strange for Hirei Gassem , who has visited the United States four times and whose son graduated from a U.S. university . Once among Somalia ' s most prominent businessmen , Gassem lost his detergent and soap factories during the civil_war that destroyed most of the capital and the nation . But as he started to rebuild from the rubble , beginning with the 10-room Quality Inn motel he plans to open this month near Mogadishu ' s international airport , Gassem said he too is somewhat confused about America ' s intentions in Somalia . &quot; I know the American mentality is progressive , &quot; he said . &quot; And the Americans can still do much here . But they must get involved with the local people . I always thought the Americans , if anyone , would understand this . But for some reason , they failed in this here . &quot; Looking_back , I would say the Americans succeeded about 70 % here . Before they came , people were starving . Battle wagons roamed the streets . We were in a state of civil_war , and maybe we ' re about to be in the same state again . &quot; But today , at least , we are talking . We are surviving . We are moving_around . We are seeing a little ray of hope . For me , this is a success . And for me , they are not successful because they withdraw just like that. &quot; There was yet another perspective from the Somali women , who suffered in the clan wars and had perhaps the highest hopes for the U.S. troops when they first arrived . &quot; After all , we were the real victims of this civil_war . It is not us who took_up arms , it is the men , &quot; said Habiba Nur Raghe , who ran a small hotel before the war destroyed the capital . &quot; We lost our sons , our husbands , our fathers and our brothers . &quot; When the Americans arrived , we hoped only that this would stop . And the Americans have fulfilled their obligation , morally and politically . So it is time for them to leave . Now , we only hope that , in their leaving , we will somehow resolve our differences among ourselves. &quot;</TEXT>
