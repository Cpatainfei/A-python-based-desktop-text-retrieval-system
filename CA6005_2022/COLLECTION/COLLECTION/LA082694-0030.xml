   <HEADLINE> THE WEST , BLINKERED , KEEPS BLUNDERING ; ISLAMIC WORLD : ITS EVOLUTION HAS EVERY CHANCE OF BEING DEMOCRATIC IF DEMOCRACIES WILL PUT IDEALS AHEAD OF DEAL-MAKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pardon my French , but the government of France barely gives_a_damn about Rwanda . France cares first and foremost about Algeria , a volcano about to erupt . Algeria , once the jewel of the_French empire , was the scene in the 1950s of a vicious war of independence that spilled_over into France , nearly bringing_about a right-wing dictatorship . Today it is the cradle of a North African fundamentalist revival that is overflowing into French domestic politics with consequences that could again polarize France . Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur calls it France ' s &quot; greatest threat. &quot; In America , influential intellectuals beat the same drum . If there is a crisis -- and this is by no means certain -- the West has made its own sizable contribution . For decades , the Western powers have rallied behind oil-rich governments in the Islamic world that were unpopular , inefficient , wasteful , self-servingly corrupt and unwilling to embark_on the reforms that would have used wealth more efficiently and equitably to build a farsighted pattern of development . Now , having backed and failed with the shah of Iran , having backed and failed with Saddam Hussein , the West is backing the generals in Algiers . Following the_French lead , all_the major Western powers supported the Algerian government when it canceled the second round of elections in early 1992 ( the first free elections since independence ) after it saw the Islamic fundamentalists win the first round . It was a narrow-sighted decision , and the beleaguered Algerian government is now under siege from an Islamic movement that has seen in a short two years its nonviolent , pro-democracy leadership taken_over by quite ruthless political killers . But Algeria does not have to be the first domino that goes_on toppling throughout North Africa , even to that stalwart of Islamic rectitude , Saudi_Arabia , producing militant anti-Western states , able to arm themselves with anything the ex-Soviet black_market will provide . Some fundamentalists indeed may have a rough agenda of this sort . Most do not . Most fundamentalists are moved by a down-to-earth search for values in a world that appears to have lost many of its bearings -- the essential and timeless qualities of family life , integrity , probity and individual responsibility . It is often the fundamentalists in these countries who offer free medical treatment , clean the streets and distribute cheap photocopies of textbooks . Many of its ranks , compared with those that rule , are highly educated people , often prominent in the professions . Fundamentalist movements , despite their public image , are in a number of countries democratically inclined . In Algeria , 2 1 / 2 years ago , the movement was certainly democratic . In Tunisia , it still is . Yet it is the secretive , violence-prone groups , the gamaat , that we most hear about and are taught to fear . They are strong and getting stronger ; in Iran and Algeria , they have the upper_hand . There is a battle for the mind under way . The West , having little direct influence , can encourage the democratic seed wherever it sprouts . This means uncoupling itself from the economically satisfying but spiritually corrupting partnership with the arms buyers of the old order . The West , moreover , must recall its own history more clearly . Christian culture for its first millennium and a half had no other tradition than autocracy . Islam will , I am sure , engage before long , if it hasn ' t started already , in its own political Reformation and discover democracy for itself . But first it probably has to be purged by a spiritual Reformation . Fundamentalism is probably an unavoidable step along the way . The West can choose to help or hinder this process . At the moment it appears to be making all_the wrong decisions . The French for their own pathological reasons that lie deep in their tortured history with Algeria may be making a terrible mistake . But there is no good argument why the rest of the West has to follow them .</TEXT>
