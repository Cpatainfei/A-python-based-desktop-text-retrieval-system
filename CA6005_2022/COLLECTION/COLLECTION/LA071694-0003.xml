   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; WHEN THE LAWYER ' S BILL IS OUT OF BOUNDS ; A RISE IN REPORTS OF OVERCHARGING HAS RAISED CONCERN . MOST ATTORNEYS ARE CONSCIENTIOUS , OFFICIALS SAY , BUT THE PRESSURE TO PUSH_UP FEES IS HIGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Randy Blim winced as he pored over the legal bills in his Hollywood office . Tens of thousands of dollars in_charges had almost no documentation . When he called his firm ' s respected New York lawyer for an explanation , the attorney brushed him off as a rube . &quot; This is what you get when you hire a big New York City law_firm , &quot; Blim said the lawyer chided him good-naturedly . Blim backed_off but resented the lawyer ' s superiority . He would later learn that the lawyer had , among other things , dined at client expense at the priciest of restaurants and charged the Hollywood post-production company for a female friend to accompany him on a business trip . Blim ' s dilemma is not uncommon , according to legal_fee auditors . Clients often hesitate to challenge their lawyers ' bills because they are uncertain about how much such services should cost and , more significantly , fear alienating a hired advocate . But legal consultants say there are plenty of reasons for clients to worry . Many lawyers inflate their bills , whether by charging $ 1 a page for a facsimile that costs the firm 15 cents or by charging for a paralegal when the work was performed by a lesser-paid secretary . In some cases , the offenses are more egregious . Even the American Bar Assn . acknowledges the problem . &quot; One major factor contributing to the discouraging public_opinion of the legal_profession , &quot; the association wrote in guidelines issued in December , &quot; appears to be the billing practices of some of its members. &quot; Thirty-eight percent of 270 lawyers responding to a 1991 survey of a cross-section of the American Bar acknowledged that clients are occasionally billed for work not performed , and 17 % admitted they had charged more_than one client for the same work . Most common , according to fee auditors , are charges for unnecessary work or for training less-experienced lawyers . Most lawyers are conscientious , said Lawrence J . Fox , an ABA official who helped write the overbilling guidelines , but the pressure to bill hours , combined with the economic downturn , has &quot; created an environment &quot; that may encourage some lawyers to bill for more hours than they work . &quot; The number of reported instances of billing abuses has increased , &quot; Fox said . About 3 # 000 billing disputes in California were assigned to private arbitrators last year . In one small program run_by the State Bar , California lawyers were found to have overcharged last year in at least 33 % of 128 disputed cases . A federal judge in April castigated the prestigious Los Angeles law_firm of Gibson , Dunn &amp; Crutcher for charging for repetitive and unnecessary work and excessive hours in a bankruptcy case . Particularly galling to the judge : Gibson ' s $ 99 # 000 charge for time spent preparing its bill . The firm launched an internal investigation of the case . &quot; We are certainly looking_at what happened , &quot; said Gibson managing partner Ronald Beard . He said he knew of no past instances of overbilling . &quot; This is the only time I ' m aware of &quot; such a problem , he said , adding that the lawyer who oversaw the case left the firm last fall . Even one of the nation ' s top law_enforcement officers was implicated in overbilling . Associate Atty . Gen . Webster L . Hubbell resigned this year amid reports that his former Little_Rock firm was investigating him for inflating his legal charges in Arkansas . At Laser-Pacific Media Corp. , lawyer Lewis Eslinger had initially impressed executives , including Blim , a senior_vice_president . A hefty man with silver-streaked hair combed straight back and monogrammed shirts , Eslinger oozed confidence and competence , Laser-Pacific executives said . He also possessed a credential that meant a lot to the Hollywood company : He had represented Sony , an industry giant . According to Laser ' s new attorneys , Eslinger was supposed to prevent competitors from infringing on its patent for converting video from the American television standard to the European standard . He filed lawsuits against the competitors on Laser ' s behalf , and they , in turn , filed counterclaims against Laser . His bills , &quot; reasonable &quot; at first , became &quot; enormous &quot; as the months stretched into nearly two years , Blim said . &quot; There was no itemized breakdown of the bills , just line_items with the dates and a big dollar amount , &quot; Blim recalled , sitting in his modest office , where cardboard boxes of legal files line one wall . Laser-Pacific lost its patent battle . A federal judge ruled that the patent was invalid , forcing Laser to spend more_than $ 1 million to settle its competitors ' claims . Reeling from the losses , the company eventually instructed the Los Angeles-based firm of Kindel &amp; Anderson to sue Eslinger and his law_firm , Cooper &amp; Dunham , for malpractice . &quot; This case is an example of a client who really got intimidated by his lawyer , &quot; said Manuel Klausner , Laser ' s attorney in the malpractice action . Eslinger should have told his client that he had qualms about the strength of its case , Klausner said , so the company could have settled and avoided losses . Eslinger , reached in New York , declined to comment , citing the pending litigation . His lawyer in the case also declined to comment . In preparing_for the lawsuit , filed_in January , 1993 , Klausner and his colleagues eventually obtained the receipts for Eslinger ' s expenses -- which were later entered into court records . They were staggered by some of the charges . While visiting Los Angeles , the lawyer and others had dined lavishly at Laser-Pacific ' s expense -- L ' Orangerie , $ 561 , Jimmy ' s , $ 474 , L ' Ermitage , $ 306 . He had racked_up a $ 547 charge for dinner for nine at a New York restaurant and played golf in Phoenix at the company ' s expense , although Laser-Pacific had no business there . He also submitted charges for air fare for the female friend and hotel , rental cars and groceries for his wife , according to Laser ' s new lawyers , and billed the company $ 116 for a Chinese takeout meal delivered to his house . For one day , Eslinger billed Laser-Pacific and other clients a total of 25 hours . In sworn depositions , Eslinger said he had inadvertently charged Laser-Pacific for some expenses , but properly charged the company for meals where Laser ' s case had been discussed . He could not always remember , however , who had dined with him on those occasions . &quot; He said he tabulated his expense charges while watching television , &quot; Klausner said . But in the eyes of Barry Kaiman , a Los Angeles lawyer representing Eslinger ' s firm , the dispute boils_down to &quot; an unhappy client trying to shoot the messenger that brought the bad news. &quot; Kaiman refused to comment on the propriety of the bills , but said Laser-Pacific had disputed only $ 17 # 000 of the New York firm ' s approximately $ 100 # 000 in expenses . Klausner called that estimate &quot; vastly understated. &quot; Consultants who audit lawyers ' bills said extravagant spending for travel and meals is less common than other billing abuses . They traced the excesses to the 1980s , when the legal_profession , like the rest of the economy , was booming . Law_firms grew , and the new bureaucracies became more expensive to run . Some firms began charging for office overhead . Photocopying became part of the profits . Clients noticed curious charges on their bills : &quot; HVC &quot; -- heating , ventilation and air conditioning -- or word_processing ( typing ) or filing . One attorney recalled that during the 1980s , she and others in her San Francisco firm would go_to lunch and decide at the restaurant whose client would be billed for it . Sometimes two or three attorneys would attend , sometimes many_more if they were celebrating a birthday . &quot; Everybody does the lunch , &quot; said the lawyer , who asked that her name not be used . &quot; You say : ' I had to go_out to lunch to discuss your case with a partner. ' You try to be ethical . You talk_about the client for 10 or 15 minutes and then you have a nice lunch . We used to do_it once a week. &quot; Only the rich clients got soaked for those meals , she said . Now she is working for a firm that represents poorer people , and the expensive meals and first-class travel are gone . &quot; Now I stay_at Holiday Inns and below , &quot; she said . Lawyers usually bill by the hour . Rates vary widely , but tend to range from $ 85 to $ 400 an hour . An associate at a small San Francisco firm told Santa Rosa litigation consultant Jim Schratz that a senior partner instructed him to bill for any time he thought_about a case , even if it was in the shower . &quot; When you are getting paid by the hour , &quot; legal bill auditor Gary Greenfield said , &quot; there is an inherent inefficiency . The more time you spend , the more money you make , so there is a disincentive to be efficient. &quot; Associates , usually the less experienced lawyers in a firm , are fired if they do not meet minimum billing requirements . Some resort_to billing for more time than they work . An hour may become an hour and a half . &quot; The pressure ( to bill ) is unbelievable , oh unbelievable , &quot; said a young San Francisco attorney who left private practice because she could no longer endure it . She is now a government lawyer . She said her former associates frequently padded their time and thrived on minimum billing requirements , a common practice whereby firms do not bill for any time less than 10 or 15 minutes . &quot; A lawyer may write a one- or two-sentence letter : ' Enclosed are responses to the interrogatories . Please get_back to me , ' &quot; said Greenfield , founder of Oakland ' s Litigation Cost Management . &quot; That is a 45-second letter that gets billed for 15 minutes . That is a widespread practice. &quot; Clients began watching their legal bills more carefully when the economy turned bad , and insurance_companies hired auditors such_as Greenfield to go_into law_firms and comb their files . Such scrutiny stemmed some of the abuses , but many continue . U.S. Northern District bankruptcy Judge Edward Jellen cited several billing abuses by Gibson , Dunn &amp; Crutcher when he decided in April to disallow half of its $ 1.35-million bill for representing creditors in the bankruptcy case . If the hours billed were correct , the judge calculated , a senior attorney at the firm had reviewed a mostly boilerplate retention agreement &quot; at the incredible rate of 14 minutes per page , or 4.3 pages per hour. &quot; Attorneys are allowed compensation in bankruptcy cases for the costs of preparing fee requests . But Jellen complained that the Los Angeles firm ' s $ 99 # 000 charge for compiling the bill was a &quot; staggering &quot; 7.3 % of its fees in the case . Gibson &quot; is not entitled to be compensated for overhead , general record-keeping and accounting , or multiple reviews of the same material by numerous attorneys , &quot; Jellen wrote . &quot; It is also not entitled to be compensated for the excessive time that an army of paralegals spent reviewing and redoing each other ' s work. &quot; Legalgard Inc. , one of the biggest legal auditing firms in the country , has found that some firms charge more when the client is not paying particular attention to the bills . John J . Marquess , chief_executive_officer and general counsel of the Philadelphia-based firm , calls it &quot; cost-shifting. &quot; He said Legalgard ' s audits since March showed the following : * A Phoenix firm charged a client $ 1 million for creation of a database that &quot; had nothing to do with the client ' s business. &quot; Although the longtime client eventually would benefit from the system , so would other clients . * A Philadelphia lawyer charged for time in depositions that he did not attend . * A Cleveland lawyer charged a client for the purchase of a suit when he ran_out of clothes during a trial . &quot; The response was , ' Get them dry-cleaned , ' &quot; Marquess said . * A New York City law_firm submitted a bill for $ 500 # 000 -- half of it for educational conferences . * A Miami firm charged a client $ 2 # 000 for preparing his $ 40 # 000 bill . Many lawyers also tend to train young associates or new lawyers at client expense , consultants said . When a lawyer leaves a firm or moves onto another project , the client may be billed for the hours it takes the new lawyer to become familiar_with the case . Firms also may charge for a partner ' s time to review an associate ' s work , part of the training process for new lawyers that consultants say should be taken_into_account when billing . Although clients want their lawyers to be prepared_for all possibilities , some consultants believe that firms do more work than is necessary when the client ' s potential liability is low . &quot; Unfortunately , big law_firms are in the habit of giving a Cadillac defense in cases that require only a Chevette defense , &quot; said Schratz , the Santa Rosa consultant . Challenging a lawyer about a bill often saves the client money . &quot; Most of them will very quickly cut 25 % of the bill , &quot; said John W . Toothman , founder of Devil ' s Advocate in Virginia , a litigation consulting_firm that examines legal bills , &quot; especially if they think it will repair the relationship and keep your business. &quot; State bar associations try to guide lawyers in appropriate billing . The California State Bar is developing recommendations based in part on guidelines from the American Bar Assn . According to these guidelines , lawyers should not charge for normal overhead but may for photocopying , computer research , secretarial overtime and telephone_calls if the charges reflect the actual costs to the firm or the client has agreed to them in_advance . Lawyers also should not charge more_than one client for the same work . For example , an attorney who spent four hours at a courthouse for three clients on the same day may_not bill each of the clients for four hours , the ABA said , even though each case by itself would have required four hours . A lawyer who flies across the country for one client and works_on the plane for another may_not bill both clients for that time , according to the guidelines . Nor should a firm charge a client for research when it is recycled work done for another client . The State Bar of California said it received 865 allegations of legal_fee improprieties last year and referred some of the complaints to arbitration . A Bar spokeswoman said figures were not available on how many lawyers were disciplined for improper billing . Lawyers who blatantly overcharge clients are occasionally prosecuted . A 30-member San Jose law_firm recently pleaded guilty to 12 counts of felony mail_fraud after prosecutors accused its partners of telling the accounting department to add arbitrary time on bills . The firm primarily practiced workers ' compensation defense law . Some counties , including Los Angeles , have discovered fraudulent billings by attorneys appointed by the court to represent indigents . Six Los Angeles criminal defense_lawyers agreed in 1986 to settlements totaling $ 129 # 500 for allegedly overbilling the county . In the patent case , Laser-Pacific received bills from the New York firm for about $ 1 million . After Laser sued for fraud and malpractice , the New York firm filed a counterclaim for unpaid fees and expenses of about $ 500 # 000 . As the negotiations dragged_on and the depositions mounted , the New York firm agreed to remove all_of Eslinger ' s time and expenses from the bill -- about $ 400 # 000 . He was the lead lawyer , but others in the firm also worked_on the case . It has yet to be resolved . Laser ' s new lawyers are seeking at least $ 2 million and potentially $ 60 million in damages . A trial was scheduled for this month , but the case may be settled out of court . &quot; A lay person in a litigious society is , to some degree , defenseless , &quot; said Emory Cohen , Laser-Pacific ' s president . &quot; If you find you can ' t necessarily trust your lawyer , where are you ? &quot;</TEXT>
