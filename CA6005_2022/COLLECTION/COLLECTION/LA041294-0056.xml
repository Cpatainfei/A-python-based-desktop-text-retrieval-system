   <HEADLINE> JUDGE REFUSES TO BAR NURSES FROM STRIKING ; LABOR : BUT HE AFFIRMS ORDER REQUIRING NOTICE OF WALKOUT . HOSPITAL POLICY FORCING STAFF TO HAVE DOCTOR ' S EXCUSE FOR SICK DAYS IS NULLIFIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Superior_Court judge Monday rejected Ventura County ' s bid to block county nurses from striking , but kept_in place a temporary order requiring at least 72 hours notice of a walkout . Judge Ken W . Riley also freed nurses at Ventura County Medical_Center from a morale-breaking new policy that forced them to bring_in a private doctor ' s note after taking sick_leave . &quot; I feel the judge has upheld the professional integrity of nurses , &quot; said Judith Overmyer , co-chairwoman of the local chapter of the California Nurses Assn . &quot; It was beyond me that you couldn ' t trust a nursing staff with a decision on whether they were sick. &quot; Monday ' s ruling represented the first victory in a string of disappointments for the county ' s nurses -- who have faced layoffs , pay_cuts and failed contract negotiations in the past year . But the decision raised concerns for county officials , nervous that the health_care workers will follow_through on their threat to walk_out . Union leaders voted three weeks ago to authorize a strike , but say they will use the labor action only as a last_resort . &quot; Certainly the county has been examining the steps necessary to protect public health , &quot; said Ed McLean , assistant personnel director for the county . The possibility of a strike escalated last week after the county Board of Supervisors imposed a pay and benefits package on 350 health_care workers at the county hospital . &quot; Now perhaps , there ' s a greater motivation for some type of work action , &quot; said Assistant County Counsel Leroy Smith , arguing in court for an injunction against a strike . Today , the nurses ' union will ask the court to block the county ' s plans to impose the contract and any possible layoffs . Short of that , union leaders say Monday ' s ruling allows them to keep the option of a strike -- and the leverage to bring the county back into contract negotiations . * &quot; There are , at this time , no plans to strike or engage in any work_stoppage , &quot; Donald Nielsen , attorney for the nurses ' union , told the judge . &quot; They want the county to come_back to the bargaining table , so we can settle this matter once and for all. &quot; Faced with the decision of imposing a strike ban or dismissing a temporary order setting the 72-hour notice requirement , Riley asked the attorney for the nurses ' union to consider a compromise . The union agreed to support an extension of the temporary order until at least May 9 , rather than risk an outright ban . &quot; If he took_away our ability to even consider a strike , what tools do we have to even get the county back to the negotiating table ? &quot; Overmyer asked . * The judge also issued a writ of mandate that effectively blocks a new sick-leave policy that nurses found expensive and insulting . Under the policy , which the hospital began enforcing in February , nurses had to show a note from a private physician after returning after even one day ' s absence . The visit to a private physician cost nurses time and money , the union argued . The judge agreed with the union ' s position that such a policy should be discussed in negotiations , not imposed unilaterally by the hospital .</TEXT>
