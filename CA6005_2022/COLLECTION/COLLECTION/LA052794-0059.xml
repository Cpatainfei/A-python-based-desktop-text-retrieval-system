   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 / 21 DAYS AND COUNTING ; MOVING_UP ; AFRICAN TEAMS GAINING RECOGNITION ; NIGERIA STRONGEST OF THREE ENTRIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sixty years have passed since Abdel Rahman Fawzi of Egypt wrote his name into the history of the World Cup . That was in Italy in 1934 , when Egypt became the first African_country to take_part in the tournament . It was a brief appearance , a 4-2 loss to Hungary at Naples that sent the Egyptians home right away . But not before Fawzi had scored two goals to become the first African to score in the World Cup . Six decades later , another African is considered a good bet to win the scoring title in World Cup ' 94 . Few American fans may have heard of Rachidi Yekini , but if Nigeria lives_up_to its potential in this tournament , Yekini will quickly become just as well known as Cameroon ' s Roger Milla in Italia ' 90 . This is the first World Cup in which three African_countries will be participating , Cameroon ' s excellent performance in Italy four years ago having earned the continent a third berth . The three nations that qualified are Nigeria , Cameroon and Morocco . Of the three , Nigeria is clearly the one with &quot; most likely to succeed &quot; stamped on its passport . Cameroon is in chaos , its preparations for the World Cup thrown into confusion by a lack of funds and constant political interference . Morocco doesn ' t have much of a team and is expected to struggle . But Nigeria , that ' s a different story . &quot; We ' ve proven we ' re a good side with great individual players , &quot; the team ' s winger , Victor Ikpeba , said after Nigeria had won the African_Nations Cup in Tunisia in April . &quot; There is so_much talent we could form two different sides and still be the best in Africa. &quot; Clemens Westerhof , Nigeria ' s oft-embattled Dutch coach of the past five years , is somewhat more restrained in his enthusiasm . &quot; My only aim is to produce results that will surpass Cameroon at the last World Cup_finals , &quot; he said . That in itself will be no small feat . After upsetting defending world champion Argentina in Milan in the opening match of the Italia ' 90 tournament , Cameroon went all_the way to the quarterfinals . Only an unlucky 3-2 overtime loss to England at Naples prevented it from reaching the semifinals . Cameroon ' s showing was the best ever by an African_country in the World Cup , and its open and attacking style earned favorable reviews in a tournament that was almost devoid_of adventurous play . No player typified this fun-loving spirit better than Milla , who at 38 showed he could still dance through defenses with ease . His hip-swinging post-goal celebratory dances with the corner flag drew smiles from one end of Italy to the other . Milla , Africa ' s player of the year in 1976 and 1990 , is 42 now but still dreams of being included in Cameroon ' s World Cup team for 1994 . Henri Michel , the country ' s French coach , is noncommittal , recognizing Milla ' s popularity with the fans and especially President Paul Biya , but also knowing that age has caught_up_with the player known as &quot; the Old Lion. &quot; Not that Yekini , Milla ' s heir_apparent as Africa ' s World Cup star , is exactly a youngster . At 30 , Yekini is closer to the end of his playing career than the beginning . But his credentials as a striker are impressive . His eight goals in World Cup qualifying play for Nigeria made him the top goal-scorer in Africa ' s qualifying tournament . He scored another five in Tunisia to win the goal-scoring title at the African_Nations Cup , the continental championships . And he is just as prolific with his club team . Although playing for unfashionable Victoria Setubal , he leads the Portuguese League in scoring with 21 goals so far this season . It ' s small wonder that Nigeria ' s Super Eagles believe they will fly_high this summer . There is a lot more_than national pride at stake , however . Cameroon earned Africa a third_World Cup berth . Nigeria has the possibility of earning it a fourth or even fifth spot in the quadrennial world championships . Now that FIFA , world soccer ' s governing body , has decided to expand the tournament to 32 teams in 1998 , there is competition to see just how the six continental confederations divide those extra eight places . The Europeans have offered a plan that gives Africa , Asia , CONCACAF ( the North and Central_American and Caribbean region ) and South_America each one additional place while reserving the other four places for the continents that provide the four semifinalists in this World Cup . Potentially , all four could go_to Europe , which has not escaped the notice of the Africans and Asians . Both continental groups would like two extra places rather than one . Much will depend , therefore , on how well Nigeria , Cameroon and Morocco do on Africa ' s behalf this summer and on how well South_Korea and Saudi_Arabia fare in the cause of Asia . Morocco and Saudi_Arabia are in the same group , adding a little spice . Cameroon is grouped with tournament favorite Brazil , Sweden and Russia . Russia -- then the Soviet_Union -- defeated Cameroon , 4-0 , in the World Cup four years ago and is unlikely to be any easier to deal with this time around . Milla or no Milla , Cameroon has a tough task ahead . So does Morocco . Besides the Saudis , the Moroccans must play the_Netherlands and Belgium in the first round . The best hope for Coach Abdallah Blinda ' s team is a third place , which probably will require defeating Saudi_Arabia . That leaves Nigeria carrying Africa ' s banner . The Super Eagles have a potentially less-intimidating opening round . They play , in_order , Bulgaria , Argentina and Greece . Bulgaria has yet to win a World Cup match in 16 attempts , Argentina ' s defense is a shambles and the Greeks bear gifts of three points for each of their World Cup opponents . In other words , the Nigerians have a chance to do more_than just well . They could win the group . All of which leaves Issa Hayatou with somewhat mixed emotions . Hayatou , 47 , is president of the Confederation Africaine de Football ( CAF ) , soccer ' s governing body on the continent . He is also a member of the FIFA executive committee and is regarded_as being in_line for the FIFA presidency one day . He is also from Cameroon , which leaves him hoping that Nigeria succeeds , but not at Cameroon ' s expense . During Hayatou ' s tenure with CAF , African teams have done increasingly well in international competition . In addition to Cameroon ' s quarterfinal appearance in the World Cup in 1990 , Ghana won the Under-17 World Championship in Italy in 1991 ( Nigeria had won in 1985 and finished second in 1987 ) and finished second in the Under-20 World Championship in Australia in 1993 . Ghana also won the bronze medal in the 1992 Olympic Games at Barcelona , the best Olympic performance by an African team . And in the first All-African final in a world championship tournament , Nigeria defeated Ghana in the 1993 Under-17 World Championship in Japan last year . Clearly , Africa ' s youth teams are among the best in the world . According to Hayatou , the sport in Africa is &quot; in evolution , &quot; and with the exception of a_few national federations , the level of play is rising throughout the continent . &quot; As a confederation , we are second only to Europe , &quot; Hayatou said , adding that of CAF ' s 52 member nations , &quot; there are at least 20 countries that play_at a very good level -- higher than teams from Asia , Oceania and Central_America . &quot; As far as South_America is concerned , there are only two countries , Argentina and Brazil , that are strong . The others are at the same level as those in Africa. &quot; Hayatou said there are more_than 500 Africans playing professionally in Europe , including such world-class stars as Ghana ' s Nii Lamptey in the_Netherlands and Anthony Yeboah in Germany ; Liberia ' s George Weah in France and Yekini in Portugal . &quot; African football is progressing and improving , and we ' re going forward to seriously challenge Europe , &quot; he said . &quot; The problem in Africa is that we don ' t have enough financial means and material and sports infrastructure , and therefore we are handicapped . If those conditions were achieved , we could have a very worthwhile role in the worldwide soccer family. &quot; The return of South_Africa to the CAF and FIFA fold probably has hastened the day when Africa plays host to a World Cup . For the immediate future , however , all attention is_on 1994 and the hope that before the World Cup goes_into Africa , a World Cup winner can come_out of Africa .
