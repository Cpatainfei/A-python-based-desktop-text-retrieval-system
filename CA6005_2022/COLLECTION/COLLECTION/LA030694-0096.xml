   <HEADLINE> POTSHOTS AT THE RESALE OF GUNS CONFISCATED BY POLICE AGENCIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Police_departments selling guns for profit ( &quot; O.C. Police Take Heat for Selling Seized Guns , &quot; Feb . 25 ) is not only the ultimate in rationalization , it ' s the ultimate insult to law-abiding citizens . While the citizenry is coming_up with creative , albeit desperate , ways to remove guns from the streets , the Orange and Huntington Beach police_departments sell them for eventual redistribution back to where they came . If there was one last chance / hope we had_on the street-gun issue , it should have been the leaders of the brave men and women who have to wear a bulletproof_vest under their clothes just to go_to work ! It ' s a new level of insanity . Personally , I liked it better when you could find a cop at a doughnut shop instead of making deals for profit with private arms dealers . N . DOUGLAS MAZZA Orange * Why don ' t the police open a retail gun shop to sell the guns they confiscate ? Eliminate the middleman and make lots more money for city coffers . ED THOMPSON Irvine * Oh , it does my heart good to read that Southern California ' s elected officials and city_managers are so up_to doing their duty as those in Northern California . Let ' s take_a_look at what yours have recently accomplished . According to &quot; O.C. Police Take Heat for Selling Seized Guns , &quot; they are managing to step_in and attempt to halt our law_enforcement agencies from raising badly needed budget funds to combat crime ! Boy , they will just do anything to interfere with law_enforcement ' s ability to protect us private citizens ! No matter that they have now created enough pressure to force a legitimate businessman to close his doors . A businessman who has legally assisted these agencies in returning over $ 10 million to the public coffers to help combat crime ! And that doesn ' t count the sales tax and state registration fees collected when this product is legitimately resold through licensed channels to a law-abiding consumer ! They should be so proud_of themselves ! And , these are the same people who will be coming_to you and me for more taxes because they can find tax money to earmark for combatting crime . A special note to Santa Ana Councilman Ted R . Moreno . You had better also stop your ( city ' s ) practice of selling confiscated vehicles from drug dealers . If you look_at recent studies published in this very same paper , your kids have a much better chance of being run_over by one of those vehicles . And those confiscated and recovered bicycles : Why , your child has an extremely good chance of being injured by one of those terrible evil products . A simple question . Have any of you ever read the 1968 United States Gun_Control Act ? When will this lunacy end ? When will my intelligence ever be safe from insult by these people and your newspaper ? KIP CANFIELD Roseville * Who are the people turning_in guns at the Anaheim Pond , Aamco transmission or any other guns for goodies exchanges ? By all accounts , gangbangers and crooks are not filling the lines . It is ironic that at_the_same_time that these guns for goodies programs are going_on nationwide , there are law_enforcement agencies selling confiscated firearms that were in fact taken from -- you guessed it -- gangbangers and crooks ! Politicians defend this policy as a fiscal necessity and a legal practice . Some law_enforcement officials say : &quot; It is not like you are adding_to the supply by selling confiscated weapons. &quot; This is political hypocrisy and ignores ethical as well as moral issues . Is it ethical to defend this practice as legal while at_the_same_time seeking to outlaw currently legal sales of other types of weapons ? Is it moral to ignore the fact that a police_officer has already risked his or her life once to take these guns off our streets ? This policy of selling cheap , secondhand guns by cities and law_enforcement agencies must be halted immediately . Weapons stockpiled should not be sold . It is time to shed some light in this hypocritical practice and demand that all cities and law_enforcement agencies nationwide get_out of the business of adding_to the supply of guns on our streets .
