   <HEADLINE> RULING ON HOLOCAUST DENIAL IS DENOUNCED IN GERMANY ; COURTS : APPEALS JUDGE DECIDES EXTREMIST ' S CLAIMS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO CONVICT HIM OF INCITING RACIAL HATRED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jewish groups , politicians and the press_on Wednesday denounced a decision by the highest_German appeals court that an extreme rightist ' s claim that the Holocaust never occurred is insufficient grounds to convict him of inciting racial hatred . The Federal_Court of Justice sent the case against Guenter Deckert , leader of the rightist National Democratic Party , back to a lower court in Mannheim on Tuesday . Although spreading Nazi ideas is a crime in Germany , the court said it was &quot; too_much of a generalization &quot; to assert that Deckert had incited racial hatred simply by disseminating the view that the mass_murder of Jews at Auschwitz never happened . The case against him shows &quot; peculiarities &quot; in its &quot; factual and legal aspects , &quot; said Judge Guenter Gribbohm , who read the decision in court in Karlsruhe . Printed copies of the ruling will not be available for several days . But Rabbi Abraham Cooper , associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles , called the decision &quot; a new interpretation of existing anti-hate laws &quot; in Germany and said it &quot; set the stage for whitewashing the crimes of the Nazi era. &quot; Cooper said German courts traditionally have linked denial of the Holocaust to racism and racist violence . In Germany , the ruling was reported on newspaper front pages and condemned across political lines . The leftist Greens Party said it was &quot; dangerous and irresponsible , &quot; while the conservative Die Welt newspaper wrote that &quot; one rubs his eyes in astonishment. &quot; &quot; Until now , it was regarded in this republic as common_sense that injustice is condemned as injustice and that there is no leniency for Nazi apologists , &quot; Die Welt said . &quot; He who belies Auschwitz not only attacks Jews ' human dignity but also shakes the foundations of how this society sees itself. &quot; Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger added , &quot; We must_not allow the belittling or even the denial of Nazi crimes to be accepted with a shrug. &quot; Only the left-of-center Social Democratic Party said the ruling was positive in that the court confirmed that the Holocaust occurred and refused to be used as a forum for those who wrongly contend that it did not . Deckert , 52 , a former schoolteacher , had been convicted of inciting hatred in 1992 , given a one-year suspended sentence and fined about $ 6 # 000 . He was charged after organizing a lecture by Fred Leuchter , an American neo-Nazi and designer of U.S. prison execution chambers who told the rightist party that he had visited Auschwitz and claimed to have proven that it never had gas_chambers . Leuchter asserted that no war_crimes had been committed there ; Deckert translated Leuchter ' s speech into German and marketed videotapes of it . The fallacy that the extermination of 6 million Jews never took_place has been spreading throughout the world as the 50th anniversary of the end of World_War_II approaches . There is a proliferation of books , neo-Nazi advertisements in college newspapers and even infomercials on satellite networks contending that the Holocaust did not occur . As Germans reacted to the court decision , police tried to determine whether a fire that killed four adults and two children in a Stuttgart house occupied mainly by foreigners was deliberately set and if rightist extremists were involved . A 27-year-old Turkish woman , her 4-year-old daughter , a Croatian couple and a 24-year-old German mother with her baby died in the blaze Wednesday morning . Stuttgart Police_Chief Michael Kuehner said it was not known whether the fire was arson . He said there was no indication as yet that the fire was an attack by right-wing extremists . Extreme rightists have targeted foreigners in arson and other attacks that have taken 30 lives since German reunification in 1990 . Germany ' s anti-foreigner sentiment and irritation with the Holocaust issue were highlighted in a poll released earlier this month in which most Germans agreed that their country &quot; should not talk so_much about the Holocaust but should rather draw_a_line under the past. &quot; A third of the 1 # 400 German adults interviewed said the Holocaust &quot; is not relevant today because it happened almost 50 years ago. &quot; Twenty-two percent said they prefer not to have Jews living_in their neighborhood , while 68 % said they felt that way about Gypsies , 47 % about Arabs , 39 % about Poles and 36 % about Turks . The survey was commissioned by the American Jewish Committee . German and European leaders have been trying to fight these sentiments . On Wednesday , Danielle Mitterrand , wife of the_French president , was in Germany promoting a German &quot; passport &quot; against racism -- an identity_card with advice about what to do when witnessing a racist incident . The document is to be distributed in schools .</TEXT>
