   <TEXT> Very quietly , as tourists click snapshots of Confederate monuments in the Vicksburg National Military Park , black people arrive in pairs or whole families and fill_up area hotels . They come from near -- Alabama , Texas , Louisiana -- and far -- Michigan , California , Nevada , Illinois . Hugs go_around , as do exclamations of joy when family and friends collide . It ' s Fourth_of_July weekend in Vicksburg , a city of 25 # 000 that lolls among sun-seared pines on the banks of the Mississippi_River . It ' s also reunion time and , if you ' re black and you ' re from Vicksburg , you drop what you ' re doing and go_home . The South still means home to so many black Americans , despite its brutal history . Their ancestors were slaves whose labor drove the antebellum South ' s agrarian economy , who were freed to endure lynchings and rigid segregation and then jailed , bombed or killed trying to break racism ' s grip on their futures . So why do blacks , like those in Vicksburg , hold the region in such high esteem that they eagerly return ? &quot; There ' s a saying , ' The greater the oppression , the better the product , ' &quot; said Marshall Sanders , 43 , an attorney who has practiced in Vicksburg for 16 years . &quot; The South is where you will see the leadership that will bring our people out of the dirt. &quot; Blacks in the South now earn college degrees , run businesses , own land . They hold elected office in far greater numbers than in any other region . Parents send their children to spend summers with grandparents here , because the racial danger the South once represented is nowhere near the perils black children everywhere now face . Many credit the region ' s face_lift to the Freedom Summer Project of 1964 , through which 1 # 000 college_students registered voters , educated children and ran community_centers to chisel away at formal segregation . According to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies , Freedom Summer ' s greatest impact was in the political_arena . The students put 80 # 000 black voters on the rolls and boosted black participation in elections from 6.7 % to 60 % within two years . Mississippi now has 751 black elected officials , the most of any state . &quot; It set_in_motion a series of political and social changes that were slow to come but that nonetheless were profound , &quot; Frank Parker , a Washington law professor who litigated civil_rights suits throughout the South , wrote_of Freedom Summer . &quot; One might say that Mississippi has generally caught_up_with the rest of the country only to find that it shares the rest of America ' s lingering social and racial problems. &quot; In Vicksburg , the impact of Freedom Summer these 30 years later is embodied in the contrast of the easy coexistence of blacks_and_whites and the still-keen sense that racist attitudes never will vanish . &quot; In the South , where there seems to be a lot of prejudice , I didn ' t learn to dislike or hate , &quot; said Doris Tatum-Clavelle , 49 , a Vicksburg native who returned home 20 years ago after living_in Chicago and New Orleans . &quot; There is still that inner peace , life that is just a little bit easier , a little bit more comfortable . You get_back in Mississippi and the differences just slap you in the face. &quot; Being black in the South means acceding_to a love-hate existence . It means loving the laid-back , nearly conflict-free life , but hating the history of oppression that underlies , and too often undermines , this hard-earned ease . It means frustration when black people shrink_from public fights for their place in history and the community , but comfort that , when someone needs a meal or a ride or a flat_tire changed , someone else in the community always steps_forward . Hundreds of individuals in Vicksburg regularly wrestle with this duality . There is the woman who spent much of her life staring_down racists in the civil_rights movement , only to fear today ' s rebellious , gun-toting black children more_than she ever dreaded the Ku Klux Klan . The man who became the city ' s first black mayor , only to feel the anger of black voters who felt he had abandoned their concerns for the interests of the city ' s wealthy whites . The woman who stepped across invisible boundaries to become Vicksburg ' s first black female police_officer , only to encourage her twin sons to seek law_enforcement careers elsewhere , knowing they could only go so far at_home . And the children growing_up in this new South , struggling to find their place in a world of subtle and sometimes conflicting messages . As so many of these Southerners say , they can be so many things , achieve so many things , but still , to many people , they are only one thing : They are black . And so they remain here . The South is their home . * It happened in 1928 , but Lee Willa Miller remembers it as if it were yesterday . She was 11 , and her father had died . Within days , a white_man came_to collect a $ 300 debt . Her mother had no money , so he seized the family ' s 200-acre farm . He took two mules , a wagon and a_couple_of houses too . &quot; I always felt_like I had nothing to lose , &quot; Miller said . &quot; And I was ready to fight . I ' ve stepped_on a lot of white people ' s toes , happily. &quot; Lee Willa Miller is 77 now , sitting with her left_hand gently propped on the metal cane resting beside her in her painfully neat white frame house . Her knees are sore and scarred from recent surgery , but she is cheerfully dainty , like a genteel grandmother entertaining members of the garden club . Her presence and her words don ' t match . There ' s still a lot of unspent anger in Miller , who joined the NAACP in 1950 as a wife and mother and promptly began registering black voters in the Mississippi backlands . This is a woman who worked shoulder-to-shoulder with such seminal black figures as Medgar Evers , Fannie Lou Hamer , James Meredith . She quit her catering job when her boss called her in to work as she tearfully watched the Rev . Martin_Luther_King Jr. ' s funeral on television . Miller is a sage of sorts on politics , civil_rights history , black voting habits . Politicians court her endorsement and seek her advice . Those who win say they would n ' t be in office without her . In a recent election , Miller worked to help state Rep . Ken Harper in a runoff for a U.S. Senate seat . Harper won , but Miller was disappointed : Black voter_turnout was only 7 % not much more_than it was before 1964 . &quot; Somewhere along the line , some of us got too comfortable and relaxed in going_to vote , &quot; Miller said . &quot; I stay_on my telephone . I sit_up in my bed , and I call and call. &quot; With 1928 burned in her memory , Lee Willa Miller marched and organized during the civil_rights movement , encouraging black folks to get an education and attack racist systems from within , like cancer . The places she ventured were so dangerous she often didn ' t tell her husband for fear he would try to stop her . Miller doesn ' t see racism scraping against black people in the South as roughly as it scraped her back in 1928 ; she sees a more insidious form that foments black self-destruction through unemployment , drugs , crime or the breakdown of the family . &quot; Somewhere along the line , we ' ve made progress , but somewhere along the line , we ' ve gone_back , &quot; she said . &quot; You ' ve got some black folks who live well . But it ' s not enough . The white_man has still got his foot on us here . White people are white people , and don ' t ever forget they ' re white . They ' re not going_to ever want you to come_up_to their equal. &quot; Miller ' s own deprived childhood -- she never finished high_school -- made her determined to educate her five children , all_of whom are college graduates . Naturally , she pushed other black children to go_to school . There was a time when she would report truant children , scold them and send them back to class . But not anymore . Today ' s children fill Miller with more fear than any number of the shotgun-toting mobs , hooded Ku Klux Klansmen or lurking pipe_bombs she confronted in the ' 60s . &quot; You don ' t do that now , you know , because they will shoot in your houses , &quot; she said . &quot; Crack ' s got me more fearful now than back then . There used to be a time when black folks didn ' t kill black folks ; white folks killed black folks . &quot; Looks_like the white folks now are sitting_back to say , ' I don ' t have to kill ( them ) because they gonna kill one another. ' And doesn ' t it look_like we ' re doing_it ? &quot; * Despite its majority black population , Vicksburg didn ' t elect its first black mayor , Robert Walker , until 1988 . Black residents poured a lot of energy into Walker ' s campaign ; they were proud when he took_office -- and are still reeling over his defeat last year . Many feel Walker lost because some blacks deliberately stayed home on Election_Day , feeling he was too eager to please white constituents and didn ' t do enough for the people who helped elect him . Now , though , black residents are unhappy with the current mayor , and there is an effort to get Walker to run again . He ' s not sure he will . &quot; Maybe I ' ve had my time , &quot; he said . &quot; You have to do your best , and I did my best while I was there. &quot; Walker , 48 , is a former state NAACP official who teaches political_science at two black colleges . He is a product of the civil_rights movement -- &quot; All my summers have been Freedom Summers &quot; -- who wants to put his energy into grooming young blacks for political careers . &quot; People of my generation have , in many ways , had their best shot with history and destiny , &quot; Walker said . &quot; And for the last 20 years of their holding onto positions , they have done more harm than they have done_good . It ' s somebody else ' s turn now. &quot; Despite the number of Mississippi ' s black elected officials , there is a sense in Vicksburg that blacks are slowly losing grip on public office . Gertrude Young is the only black member of the city_council , even though Vicksburg is more then 55 % black . &quot; Where did we go_wrong ? &quot; Young said . &quot; I don ' t care how high you climb , you are still black. &quot; that ' s one reason that Dora Smith -- Vickburg ' s first black policewoman -- and her husband , Charles , want their children to leave Vicksburg , as they did temporarily . That is not unusual . Many black folks were born here and moved away , then returned to rear children whom they actively encourage to leave . &quot; I don ' t care about moving nowhere , but ain ' t nothing here for them , &quot; said Charles Smith , a 48-year-old welder , referring to his five children . The couple ' s two eldest sons will graduate soon from historically black Alcorn State University with degrees in criminal justice . Dora Smith , a 17-year veteran who works in juvenile investigations , said she doesn ' t expect her sons to join her on Vicksburg ' s force . &quot; If they want to make more money , they have to move , &quot; she said . &quot; It would be best. &quot; &quot; Blacks don ' t make any money , &quot; Charles Smith said . &quot; Whites have all_the money. &quot; But still , Smith is too taken with the quality_of_life in Vicksburg to leave . He owns 11 acres of land , and has bequeathed parcels to his children , with the condition that they sell their shares only to another sibling . &quot; There ' s no place like home , &quot; he said simply . * Vicksburg has no juvenile detention center , so children who commit crimes often are back on the streets quickly after a first offense and later crimes can land them in jail with adults . So the Rev . James Warren decided to try to save them himself . He cleaned_up an abandoned community_center and turned it into a program for young first_offenders , nearly 95 % of whom are black males who have flirted_with gang activity . Warren takes them in_for up_to 90 days , after an informal hearing and before they stand trial . If they pass Warren ' s program , they are recommended for probation , training or correctional school and stay out of court . So far , only one of 34 youths had to be returned for trial . &quot; The male needs a male figure . I am Coach , Reverend , Doctor or Dad to all_of them , &quot; Warren said . &quot; Of course , I have to pray and understand that I can ' t save everybody. &quot; Warren simply gives the children praise and encouragement , and requires them to read three books . They draw inspiration from his I Am Somebody Wall , with photos of people ranging from President Clinton to local judges and politicians , to let them see the futures they could have . Two of Warren ' s charges , Altonia Bland , 17 , and Quincy Watson , 15 , say they sense that racist attitudes hold young people down in Mississippi . But they aren ' t inclined to blame white people for it . &quot; You get treated differently , &quot; Watson said . &quot; Some people are racist . Some ain ' t . You can ' t say they ' re racist just because of their skin_color . It ' s how they see their mom and dad , if they feel_like their mom and dad do about black folk. &quot; Bland , an Army brat who has lived_in most parts of this country , has concluded that the South offers a good life , despite its stereotype as an oppressive place . Although he found a chance here to get_into trouble with gangs , he also found the program that got him off the track to jail and back to high_school and football . &quot; They ' ve got more jobs here than in , say , D.C. , &quot; Bland said . &quot; They give you more education here than anywhere else . When I was in New York , they didn ' t care . I didn ' t ever go_to school . Here , the coach would come looking_for me . &quot; Still , there ' s a lot of stereotypes around here . I thought we had come a long way from the past . I ask why we don ' t have our black history in our books . Since I never grew_up around real harsh stereotypes , it confuses me a lot. &quot; * Lunch at the Kitchen in the Garden , a wooden shack of an eatery in the heart of black Vicksburg , is a release mechanism for the tight knot of black professionals who laugh loud and debate life over its $ 4.25 soul food specials . The Kitchen has a backwater flavor , with its tin roof , battered screen_door and neon beer signs_in red-curtained windows . Inside , there are maybe a dozen booths and tables , and a big white jukebox with old blues and soul tunes on it . Soap_operas cast moonglow from a television_set perched over the bar . It is twilight-dim at high_noon , because the Kitchen sits under shady trees at the end of a dead-end_street . These professional folks descend on the Kitchen every day for ethnic rejuvenation ; they are among the few blacks in their respective workplaces . The Kitchen was here when Freedom Summer swept_through Vicksburg . The crowd then gathered for news of the movement and to dream of grandeur after the death of Jim Crow . And though Jim Crow eventually died , so did the Kitchen . Blacks began to patronize other , prettier restaurants ; the Kitchen , in its rustic splendor , wasn ' t good_enough anymore . &quot; There are some people who look_at this place and turn their noses up at it , &quot; said Willie Thomas , an engineer . &quot; But for me , it ' s my roots . I ' m not ashamed of it. &quot; When the Kitchen reopened eight years ago , Thomas and his lunch colleagues -- noting the precarious state of Mississippi ' s historically black colleges -- decided to do whatever was necessary to preserve a local black institution . So they routinely linger_over lunch to talk louder than they can anywhere else about religion , sex , politics and race . Besides Thomas , the crowd consists_of an airline pilot , a federal_department head and Gertrude Young , the lone black member of the city_council . The pilot , Brady Tonth , finds escape and identity in the ritual give-and-take . He has lived_in Vicksburg all his life , and he has no illusions about the status he feels he is accorded in society . He also has no plans to leave . &quot; In my environment , I ' m around white people all_the time , and I prefer to be with my people as much as I can , &quot; he said . &quot; See , in America , you ' re going to always be a nigger to white folks . I don ' t care how much money you make , how successful you are , where you are , what you do or how you do_it . You gotta understand that. &quot; * The words are an afterthought on the cornerstone of the Vicksburg Courthouse : &quot; Built by slave labor. &quot; Although no official histories credit him by name , a black_man named John Jackson designed the building . Tillman Whitley , a local high_school teacher , is confounded by the fact that , in an area so rich with black history -- and still full of people who lived it -- a man like Jackson could be overlooked so easily . He wants Jackson to get his proper credit . He wants it known that slaves laid the bricks_in Vicksburg ' s quaint cobblestone streets . Whitley ' s musings on that subject speak_to the lasting dilemma of the black South . &quot; The contributions the slaves made are still evident here . But you can hardly find a thing mentioned about what black people have done . That is by design , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
