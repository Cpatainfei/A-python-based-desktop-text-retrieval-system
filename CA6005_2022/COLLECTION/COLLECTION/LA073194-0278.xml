   <HEADLINE> TRYING A CASE IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC_OPINION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When O.J. Simpson ' s scientific experts decided not to participate in the prosecution ' s DNA testing , they held a press_conference to announce this . When they nonetheless showed_up at the laboratory the next day to observe the division of the blood samples , they explained that to the press , too . Such behavior is what we have come_to expect from the publicity-minded Simpson defense_team . But when the prosecution or defense creates this kind of hoopla outside a criminal-case courtroom , does_it really affect the verdict ? Let ' s put it this way : It ' s like the Jewish joke about the man who ' s on his death bed when his mother comes_to visit and says , &quot; What you need is a bowl of chicken soup. &quot; So the man croaks to her , &quot; Chicken_soup ? How could that possibly help ? &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; she says , a little miffed , &quot; it couldn ' t hurt. &quot; In any single case , no one really knows whether outside publicity will sway the population and the jury . But Simpson ' s is a capital case . The stakes are as high as they can be . The defendant has enough money so he can spend in_proportion_to the size of the danger . And in his situation there ' s a chance the publicity will do him some good . The noise surrounding this trial is hardly unprecedented in our criminal history . For example , it by no means exceeds the public excitement that attended the 1859 murder trial of Rep . Dan Sickles , who emerged from his Washington townhouse one afternoon and shot his wife ' s lover dead . The newspapers were beside themselves with anticipation . They spread rumors that his wife was pregnant with her lover ' s baby and that this was the reason for the murder . They speculated , alternatively , that Sickles had decided to act because he was about to be humiliated by public revelation of the affair . So these things are perennial . But there is no field of endeavor that does not offer room for improvement . Human_beings have congregated in the marketplace since time_immemorial , but only 20th-Century America gave_birth to the shopping_mall . Eye-popping criminal cases have always produced lurid public curiosity and attempts to manipulate it , but not until the O.J. Simpson trial did defense_attorneys offer the world an 800 number to phone in support for the defendant . There have been advances on the prosecution side as well . For instance , beginning in the 1960s , adventurous prosecutors began trying to focus public attention on criminal cases that did not feature violence or organized crime . Instead , these cases involved what had once seemed like relatively arcane white-collar crimes , in fields such_as tax law . The trend greatly accelerated in the 1980s , when Manhattan ' s U.S. attorney -- Rudolph W . Giuliani , now mayor of New York -- set the style . In sight of invited TV cameras , he had an alleged Wall_Street inside trader arrested and taken_away in handcuffs . The Giuliani office worked with the press , giving journalists a close look_at the inner workings of big cases . Yet the effect of the increased publicity on particular cases was not clear . The prosecution had a large advantage , since people are far readier to envision a guilty businessman than an innocent one . The publicity certainly added_to the pressure on defendants to plead guilty . But in the courtroom , there were big losses as well as big wins . In criminal cases where one side does not have such a huge edge over the other , it is even harder to predict if a publicity campaign will affect the outcome . The chief reason for uncertainty is that once a criminal trial has begun , it takes_on a life of its own . Evidence can look very different in a courtroom from the way it appears on the nightly news , as the first Rodney G . King trial showed . Many of a trial ' s crucial decisions are in the hands of a judge , who will apply specialized standards in making them . This judge , when he or she sees lawyers trying to generate publicity to sway the case , is more likely to be annoyed than impressed . A trial has its own pace : Facts that at first seem explosive can lose much of their power after they have been mauled by challenges and contradictory accounts . Jurors also develop strong opinions about particular defendants , law_enforcement officials and other witnesses on the basis of qualities not apparent on the outside . Indeed , because the relationship between the publicity and the verdict is so tenuous , it is tempting to conclude in these media-logged cases that prosecution and defense are generating press attention to advertise themselves rather than out of any rational eye to what effect they are having_on the bottom_line . Yet there are some cases where outside factors have a huge potential to affect the outcome . These factors can not be manufactured by an enterprising attorney ; they have to pre-exist in the population from which a jury will be drawn . Race , gender , attitudes toward particular sorts of crimes -- these are the types of sentiment that can overwhelm legal argument . The Simpson case has idiosyncratic features that could serve this purpose . He is a sports hero . He has given pleasure to millions . He has been a man with whom people want to identify and therefore a man they want to think they know . More_than a_few potential jurors who judge themselves open and fair-minded probably share the unacknowledged feeling that Simpson ' s life record should be taken_into_account . Some doubtless have the sense that because of this record , Simpson somehow deserves an acquittal . These are , of course , not attitudes that can be revealed outright . Those who hold them may_not acknowledge it even to themselves . But a juror who harbors such feelings will be looking , in the courtroom , for events and facts that he or she can point to as a source of reasonable doubt about a defendant ' s guilt . In Simpson ' s case we can already see from the publicity what lifelines his lawyers may try to throw to these would-be doubters : The DNA tests were performed improperly . The bloody glove was planted evidence . The policeman was a racist and a liar . Because of the predispositions in Simpson ' s favor that already exist , the publicity generated by his lawyers might conceivably reinforce it , and make jurors more receptive to the doubts that the defense_team will sow_in court . Maybe . This is a fairly thin chain on which to hang the large amount of effort that the defense is putting into its activity outside the courtroom . But it has been said that the verdict in any murder trial ultimately comes_down to whether the jury thinks the victim deserved to die . It might also be said that this verdict will depend_on whether the jurors think the accused deserves to live . If many potential jurors already think the answer to this latter question is &quot; yes , &quot; the defense is right to try to give them arguments to support their emotions. *</TEXT>
