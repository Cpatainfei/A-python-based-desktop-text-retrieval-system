   <TEXT> Manuel and Edilia Feliz entered the Old Orange County_Courthouse on Sunday just as they did_in 1941 . Only this time , negotiating the steep courthouse steps during a heat_wave took its toll on the elderly couple , married for 53 years . &quot; I remember coming here to get our marriage_license in , let ' s see , when was it ? &quot; Manuel Feliz said . &quot; Oh , yeah ! It was in May , 1941. &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; said his wife , Edilia , who wore her original , white brocade wedding_dress . &quot; And , we got_married June 22 , 1941 , right before World_War II. &quot; The Santa Ana couple was among 150 people taking_part in Sunday ' s &quot; Legalizing Love &quot; program , sponsored by the Old Courthouse Museum Society . It recognized couples who got their marriage_licenses at the historic , three-story building from 1901 to 1964 . The courthouse , the oldest in Southern California , was built_in 1901 and stood as the center of the county ' s judicial affairs until 1968 , when most of the court operations were moved to a new , 11-story complex . All court activity at the old facility ceased in 1979 . The building underwent a $ 4.5-million renovation in the early 1980s and reopened in 1987 as a county museum and historical center . &quot; We knew that a lot of people who got their marriage_license have never returned to the old courthouse because it ' s been closed for so_long , &quot; said Elynore M . Barton , Old Courthouse Museum Society president . &quot; But now that it ' s been renovated , we wanted to invite those who got their marriage_licenses here so they could reminisce about the old days. &quot; Those who attended got_to drink champagne , eat a sumptuous wedding_cake and have their pictures taken_for $ 2 . About 30 couples , including Manuel and Edilia Feliz , also renewed their wedding vows in a brief ceremony officiated by Orange County Clerk Gary L . Granville . &quot; We have our original wedding pictures , &quot; beamed Edilia Feliz . &quot; You want to see ? &quot; She handed a reporter an old black-and-white photograph . It depicted a strikingly handsome pair : She looked elegant in her white dress with veil , holding a bouquet of white_lilies . He looked dashing in a black tuxedo . &quot; You know how much I paid_for that dress ? &quot; she asked . &quot; Fifty dollars . I bought the dress in Los Angeles at , at . . . let me see . Give me a minute . I ' ll remember it . Oh , yeah , La Ideal Department_Store ! that ' s La Eye-Dee-All . &quot; We were married at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church right here in Santa Ana , &quot; she said . The couple had said their vows three times before : first at their wedding , then at their silver_wedding_anniversary and again three years ago at their golden anniversary . They have two children , three grandchildren and a 2-year-old great-grandchild . When Gene and Carol Bilau of Orange got their wedding_license in 1964 , the Beatles were taking the U.S. music scene by storm . &quot; I was in the Navy , &quot; recalled Gene Bilau , 51 . &quot; We got_married that year on July 4th . It ' s easy remembering your wedding_anniversary on July 4th. &quot; He and his wife , who will celebrate their 30th wedding_anniversary this year , were told of Sunday ' s program and decided to attend because &quot; it sounded like a neat idea , &quot; he said . But they didn ' t remember the courthouse . &quot; We were talking_about that , &quot; Bilau said . &quot; I couldn ' t remember , and Carol said she couldn ' t remember either. &quot; Carol Bilau brought along their wedding album to share with others . &quot; They didn ' t use color photos then ; they ' re in black_and_white , &quot; she said . Homes were cheaper then too , her husband said . He recalled that the couple paid $ 18 # 300 for their first home_in Orange . &quot; And , we only paid $ 2 for a marriage_license , &quot; Bilau said . A far_cry from today ' s Orange County marriage_license fee of $ 62 , said Granville .</TEXT>
