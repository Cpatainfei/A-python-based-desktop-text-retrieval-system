   <HEADLINE> ' 90S FAMILY ; TODAY ' S BEAVER CLEAVER HAS A LOT MORE ON HIS MIND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the American family in unprecedented flux , the ' 90s may be the toughest decade ever for children , according to a recent Rand study . The yearlong study by the Santa Monica research institute distilled the results of 200 studies of the American family by major researchers , and matched their results with Census figures from 1960 and 1990 . The conclusion : June and Ward Cleaver are long gone , and the ' 90s Beaver Cleaver has a lot more to worry about than whether he ' s gotten his brother , Wally , mad at him for some prank . In a telephone_interview from Harvard_University , M . Omar Rahman , visiting professor and co-author of the comprehensive study , said the 1992 Murphy Brown debate over single parents piqued his curiosity , as well as that of Rand co-researcher Julie DaVanzo . &quot; A lot of people seemed to think that the American family was worse off today than it had been , &quot; he said . &quot; We wanted to know whether this was just nostalgia , or whether this was rooted in fact . &quot; We also wanted to know whether children from single-parent families are actually worse off than children from conventional , two-parent families. &quot; Their findings , Rahman admitted , surprised them . They concluded that the traditional American family , while still alive , is no longer the single predominant social institution . Rather , it has become one of several common household models . Because of this trend , and the aging of America , &quot; It ' s harder than ever to be a kid today , &quot; Rahman said . &quot; Above all , we need to redefine who we really are , and see how we can make society a more hospitable place for our children. &quot; Among the findings : * Although the average American is better_off today than in 1960 , the average family ' s median income has fallen substantially . This is because the number of households headed by women has tripled , with nearly half of those households existing at or below the poverty_line and receiving federal help . * The median annual income of a married_couple with_children under 18 is $ 43 # 000 . The median annual income of a comparable household headed solely by the mother is $ 13 # 000 . Fatherless families have increased to account_for a quarter of all American families . The middle ground prevalent in the ' 60s is disappearing , leaving more children growing_up in either have or have-not homes . * The majority of American children do not have Mom or Dad waiting at_home after school . Even most infants 6 months and under don ' t see Mom most of the day . Instead , 60 % of their mothers work -- three times the rate in 1960 . * Not only is Mom more likely to work , Dad , too , is increasingly absent . The American divorce rate also has tripled since 1960 to its current 60 % level , and for many divorced dads , out_of_sight is often out of mind . Only half the country ' s kids have seen their divorced dads even once in the last year . And only one in three divorced dads sends full child-support payments . * Because of longer commutes and work weeks , even married dads are spending less time at_home . The average parent in a two-parent household spends just seven hours a week with the child -- a third of the time spent in 1960 . Thus , even kids in two-parent families are increasingly growing_up on_their_own . * Today ' s children are also more likely to grow_up without siblings . The average family today has 1.8 children , compared with 2.2 children in 1960 . * One-quarter of today ' s children are born_out of wedlock -- five times the rate in 1960 . * In 1960 , children made_up more_than a third of the population , while the elderly constituted a mere 10 % . Today , kids make_up just a quarter of the population , while the elderly have shot_up to 15 % . * The next-door neighbor is not only likely to be older , he is also twice as likely to be single ; that ' s because the rate of &quot; non-family &quot; households has doubled , from 15 % in 1960 to 30 % today . This is_due largely to the rise in divorces , and in adults living together . In 1960 , only 10 % of American adults lived together as an experimental prelude to marriage ; today , 50 % do so . * Should current trends continue , in 30 years the country will have more senior_citizens than children . Thus , today ' s kids , who have grown_up largely on_their_own , will probably be strapped with ever higher taxes to help support the parents who neglected them , the authors concluded . * Kids whose parents divorce will most likely see them split_up within the marriage ' s first seven years -- before the kid is mature enough to deal with it . Half of all children will spend some time in a single-parent household , often before the parent remarries . A sixth of all children will at least partially grow_up in families with one non-biological parent . * On a more positive note , because people_of_color constitute a growing segment of the American population , children in the ' 90s are increasingly learning to deal with multiethnic groups . Whereas their ' 60s counterparts wore Native_American headbands and grew long hair to dramatize their diversity , ' 90s children are more diverse to begin with , and are more likely to come from mixed backgrounds . Rahman said he and DaVanzo were surprised by some of their findings , which fly in the face of popular myths . The most popular current myth , he said , is that a typical single mother has more children today than in 1960 . In reality , she will have about the same number of children . But because there are more single mothers , and because married_couples are having fewer kids , single mothers appear relatively more prolific . Rahman said many factors have joined together to help dissolve the traditional ' 60s family . Among them : * Higher incomes for both men and women have made_it easier for them to live independently of one another . * Rising earnings by women have made_it relatively more &quot; costly &quot; for them to stay_at home with the kids . * An escalating divorce rate has made prospective parenting a less-attractive option . * Aid to Families with Dependent Children , Social_Security and similar programs have reduced economic gains to marriage for the poor and the elderly . * The sexual revolution has made_it increasingly acceptable to bear children outside marriage . Thus , only 20 % of Americans today believe that parents should stay_together just for the children . In 1960 , half of all Americans believed this .</TEXT>
