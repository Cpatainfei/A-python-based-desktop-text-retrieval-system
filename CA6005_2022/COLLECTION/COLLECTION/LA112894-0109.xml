   <HEADLINE> SHOP_TALK : ORIENTATION , OTHER MANDATORY HOURS COUNT TOWARD PAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Question : I was hired as a temporary helper for a store in the local mall . We were required to come_in on a Sunday for a three-hour orientation . Are they required to pay us for that ? L.C. , Brea Answer : Yes . Generally , hours devoted to activities required by an employer count toward the maximum of 40 hours of work_permitted per week . Calling the activities orientation , training or continuing education does not exclude them from the maximum hour calculation . -- Calvin House , attorney , Fulbright &amp; Jaworski L.L.P. Adjunct professor , Western State University College of Law * Our organization is composed of salaried employees involved in apartment management . All of our offices are staffed seven days a week . Our question is : What are the holidays , if any , for which the employer must allow his or her employees time_off ? -- S.D. , Laguna Hills . Answer : Neither the California Industrial Commission Welfare Order nor the federal wage and hour laws require an employer to give holidays off . However , an employer may have to grant time_off to reasonably accommodate the religious needs of its employees unless this would cause the employer undue hardship . For example , an employer does not have to close its entire operation on Christmas_Day . -- William H . Hackel III Employment law attorney Spray , Gould &amp; Bowers * Question : Is it legal for an employer to withhold any vacation , holiday or sick_pay accrued until the 91st day of employment ? -- L.F. , Westminster Answer : There is no employer obligation to provide vacation , holiday or sick_leave benefits for employees . Any obligation would depend_on whether these benefits are included as a provision in an employment_contract , collective_bargaining agreement , stated as a written employer policy or a company established practice . Vacation as well as sick_leave plans can vary significantly among employers . If your employer has a policy or a practice that accrues vacation from the first day of employment , you can ' t lose what the employer states you will receive . Employers will often write policies that disallow accruals during probationary ( orientation ) periods , typically the first 90 days of employment . Therefore the accrual is based on only the last nine months of employment in the first year . It is certainly not uncommon for an employer to permit accrual from the first day of employment but clearly indicate that an employee must complete a full year of service before being allowed to request vacation time_off . However in this situation , if an employee should leave the company , all vacation pay earned but not taken must be paid at termination at the employee ' s final rate_of_pay . If the company policy states that sick_leave accrual can be taken only after completion of 90 days and only if the employee is_sick , there is no entitlement at separation . I recommend you review company policies very carefully , if indeed there is an obligation . -- Elizabeth Winfree-Lydon Senior staff consultant The Employers Group * Question : I worked for a large company and was denied breaks for two years . I was wondering if it was too late to seek compensation , as it has been two to three years since I worked there . -- L.C. , Aliso Viejo Answer : According to state law , an employer must provide a paid rest_period for at least 10 minutes for non-exempt employees working_at least 3 1 / 2 hours in one day . For an eight-hour work period , two rest_periods are required ( in addition to an unpaid lunch break of at least 30 minutes ) . The required rest_period must be , if possible , within the middle of the work period . It is clearly improper for your employer to deny you the breaks allowed you by law . You have a variety of ways of possibly handling this matter . If you rely_upon breach of the statutory_law , according to the Orange County office of the state labor commissioner ' s office , you have no additional claim for compensation because you were in fact paid_for the time worked . You cannot treat the denied breaks as a claim for unpaid vacation . They do say , however , that complaints made to their office can result in a civil penalty against the employer payable to the state as well as an order to cease such practices in the future . Even if the labor commissioner ' s office does not think that you have a valid claim based on such a statute , a judge may feel differently if you pursued it in small claims court or through an attorney . The statute of limitation ' s deadline for breach of a statute is three years from the date of each denial of breaks , which you still may be within . You may also have contractual claims . It the employer orally represented that it would allow you these breaks , then the deadline is two years from the date of each breach of such agreement , which you have passed . The deadline for breach of a written agreement , as shown by an employee ' s handbook or a poster regarding such polices in the office , is four years from the date of each breach . Thus , you still may have a claim in this regard . If your employment ended because you complained about such practices , then you may also have a claim for illegal retaliation , with a three-year deadline from the date of your termination . If you were fired for performance reasons , you also might have a possible claim against the company for wrongful termination if your poor performance was_due to the failure of the employer to follow the law giving you breaks , which were designed to improve performance . If you quit because you objected to the denial of your breaks , you might have a &quot; constructive wrongful termination &quot; case . You would have to show that the conditions of working there under those circumstance were so intolerable that any reasonable person would have likewise quit . This may have a three-year statute of limitation deadline from the date of termination . Even if you do make a claim for compensation , evaluate whether it is even worth it . If it has been , for example , 2 1 / 2 years from the date of your termination , then you can realistically only argue for a half year of denied breaks , at least on a statutory deadline of three years . Six months of denied breaks of 20 minutes per day would amount to approximately 43 hours at your normal hourly rate . Conceivably , if you show that the breaks would have extended a normal eight-hour work_day to beyond that period , you might be able to argue overtime compensation of 1 1 / 2 times your normal rate . Combining your claim for unpaid compensation with one of your other potential claims might give your case enough substance to get your former employer ' s attention . -- Don D . Sessions Employee rights attorney Mission Viejo * Question : My company has always been a direct manufacturer with a direct sales force . They have now decided to open_up all their production facilities to brokers but also keep a direct sales force . As their direct salesperson for almost 20 years , I feel that it is in my best interest to go_out on my own and broker my product to my current customer base through my current company , or any other company that can give my customer a better deal . Is the work contract that I signed 20 years ago enforceable by the company now that they have changed their method of operation ? Answer : Probably , unless the contract you signed is somehow an invalid restraint of trade . However , even if the contract is illegal there are various laws , such_as the Uniform Trade_Secrets Act , that would prohibit you from taking confidential_information that you have learned from your employer and using it to compete with your employer . You could subject yourself to substantial legal liability if you pursue the course of action you are apparently contemplating . -- Michael A . Hood Employment law attorney Paul , Hastings , Janofsky &amp; Walker * Question : I was terminated by my company less than two months after being placed on disability for severe back problems . I am over 50 and had been employed in a salaried professional-technical position for 20 months . My benefits were terminated immediately , but I received two weeks ' severance pay and the company paid_for short- and long-term disability to supplement my SDI payments . I was told the reason I was fired &quot; was the need to fill my position. &quot; My termination letter said &quot; because of the nature of the business. &quot; The company . . . employs more_than 100 people . No mention was ever made in company policies of the California Family Rights Act or the federal Family and Medical Leave Act , although it does mention 12 weeks of unpaid &quot; family care leave. &quot; I understand that the law allows 12 weeks of leave in a 12-month period for the employee ' s own serious health condition . Was my termination legal ? Should I file a complaint ? All employees were required to sign a document agreeing to arbitration for dispute resolutions regarding termination or harassment in early 1993 , when a change was made in the company ' s benefit package . Does this prevent me from filing a complaint ? Could I receive any financial compensation ? I am now able to return to work after 10 months on disability and was told to check with the company for possible openings when I was available . -- B.P. , San Clemente Answer : Employees who have worked for more_than one year for a company with 50 or more employees and who have worked a minimum of 1 # 250 hours in the previous 12 months may take_leave for up_to 12 weeks for a serious health condition under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and the analogous state law . These laws entitle the employee to various job protections , including the right to be restored to the same or an equivalent job when they return from leave . The right to job restoration applies only if the employee is capable of returning from family act leave within the statutory 12-week period , however . Thus , while you have had a valid Family and Medical Leave Act claim if you had been able to return to work within 12 weeks of beginning your leave , you do not have a right to reinstatement to your old job 10 months later . Since your company has expressed an interest in re-employing you , instead of filing a lawsuit or a claim against the company that likely would not be successful , you should take them up_on their offer to explore possible open positions . -- James J . McDonald Jr. , Attorney , Fisher &amp; Phillips , and labor and employment law instructor , UC Irvine</TEXT>
