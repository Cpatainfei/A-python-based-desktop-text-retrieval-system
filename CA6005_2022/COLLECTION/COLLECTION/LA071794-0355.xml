   <HEADLINE> MICROSOFT AGREES TO LOOSEN GRIP ON SOFTWARE INDUSTRY ; TECHNOLOGY : JUSTICE_DEPARTMENT SAYS THE ANTITRUST ACCORD SHOULD SPUR COMPETITION AND INNOVATION , PLUS LOWER PRICES . PACT ALSO APPLIES TO OVERSEAS MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ending the most important antitrust investigation of the past decade , the Justice_Department announced Saturday that Microsoft Corp. , the world ' s largest maker of computer software , had agreed to end marketing practices that &quot; choked_off competition and preserved its monopoly position. &quot; Industry experts and government lawyers predicted that the settlement will increase competition and spur innovation in the software industry and lower prices for consumers . Its main beneficiaries will be other makers of software , such_as IBM and Novell , who will gain openings to sell their products to computer makers . More broadly , the settlement marks the first time that U.S. officials have coordinated an antitrust accord with the nations of the European Union . As a result , Microsoft must abide_by the new restrictions on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot; Microsoft is an American success story , but there is no excuse for any company to try to cement its success through unlawful means , &quot; said Assistant Atty . Gen . Anne K . Bingaman , who heads the antitrust division of the Justice_Department . Without admitting any wrongdoing , Microsoft officials said they agreed to a settlement late Friday evening to head_off a threatened antitrust lawsuit that could have kept the company tied_up in court for years . Since 1990 , federal antitrust lawyers have been investigating complaints that Microsoft had used its near-monopoly power in the software industry to force its products onto computer makers . Last year , it was estimated that Microsoft ' s programs ran 80 % of the world ' s 150 million computers . Many in the computer_industry feared that Microsoft ' s dominance -- based on its near-monopoly , with MS-DOS and Windows , on the software that controls the basic functions of a personal_computer -- was irreparably damaging even large competitors while driving smaller software firms out of business . Microsoft ' s largest direct competitor , Novell Inc. , applauded the settlement . &quot; Clearly , we see this as a victory , &quot; said David Bradford , general counsel for Novell . &quot; This has been a long effort by many companies for many years , and this decision today will provide consumers with increased choices and more innovative products. &quot; The agreement will be in_force for six years . It must be approved by a federal judge , but both parties agreed to abide_by its terms immediately . It ' s main provisions bar Microsoft from : * Using volume licensing_agreements on the sale of MS-DOS and Windows that effectively block_out competitors . * Imposing highly restrictive confidentiality agreements on software developers who create programs that work with MS-DOS and Windows . * Entering into certain multiyear software licensing_agreements . The volume licensing practices were the centerpiece of the Justice_Department ' s complaint . MS-DOS and Windows are usually installed by the computer manufacturer , and Microsoft gained a competitive advantage by giving computer makers -- such_as IBM , Compaq and Dell -- volume discounts on software . In exchange , the manufacturers signed licensing_agreements to pay Microsoft a fee for MS-DOS and Windows on each computer sold , regardless of whether that software actually was installed . Government lawyers had contended that these agreements locked_out competitors . If , for example , a buyer wanted different basic software for a new computer , the manufacturer would have had to pay_for that software in addition to the MS-DOS / Windows fee it paid to Microsoft -- a double royalty . &quot; Microsoft has used its monopoly power , in_effect , to levy a ' tax ' on PC manufacturers who would otherwise like to offer an alternative system , &quot; Bingaman said . This is the kind of illegal restraint of trade that violates the antitrust_laws , according to the Justice_Department complaint . The agreement &quot; will prohibit the company from continuing to engage in monopolistic practices in the future , &quot; Atty . Gen . Janet Reno said . &quot; While the company fairly and lawfully climbed to the top of the industry ladder , it used unfair and illegal practices to maintain its dominant position. &quot; Lawyers for Microsoft called these agreements incentives to use their programs . In a news_conference Saturday , Microsoft officials said they have operated &quot; in a perfectly legal fashion &quot; but nonetheless agreed to make a &quot; few reasonable accommodations &quot; to end the federal investigation . Microsoft has flourished by providing &quot; good technology at low prices , &quot; not because it has locked_out its competitors , said Bill Neukom , the company ' s vice_president for law and corporate affairs . Neukom also said he doubted that consumers would see much change from the settlement because the operating system accounts_for only 1 % to 2 % of the cost of personal_computers . It also is not clear that manufacturers will necessarily want to change the terms of their contracts , he said . Since Microsoft ' s products are enormously popular , the manufacturers may prefer to pay_for a license that allows them to put the software on all their machines . The additional provisions of the settlement will make_it easier for Microsoft ' s competitors by freeing them from restrictive agreements under which they were virtually unable to work with competing operating systems if they were developing software for Microsoft systems . The agreement also prevents long-term contracts that lock computer makers into some Microsoft products and require them to purchase a minimum number of products . In 1981 , Microsoft , which is based in Redmond , Wash. , won the right to put its operating software on IBM ' s first personal_computer . Since then , MS-DOS and Windows have become the industry standard . Saturday ' s announcement symbolizes a new , more aggressive approach to antitrust_law under the Clinton_Administration . The Microsoft case was the most significant one to be pursued by the Justice_Department since it ended antitrust suits against IBM and AT &amp; T in 1982 . The case against IBM was dropped , but the case against AT &amp; T ended in a landmark settlement that broke_up the Bell System and paved the way for a new era of competition in telecommunications . In the previous Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George_Bush , federal prosecutors eased_off enforcement of the nation ' s antitrust_laws , arguing that government should not interfere in the market simply because more efficient companies were dominating an industry . But Clinton_Administration lawyers under Bingaman have countered that the government must police &quot; unfair competition. &quot; &quot; This historic agreement will level the playing_field , &quot; she said at a news_conference Saturday at Justice_Department headquarters . The investigation of Microsoft began at the Federal Trade Commission four years ago but languished there . The Justice_Department took_over the case last year and was apparently ready to go_to court . But a trial could have been long and costly for both sides , and it is not clear that the government would have prevailed . Microsoft could argue strongly that its incentives and volume discounts were legal , even if they had the effect of hurting its weaker competitors . &quot; This settlement is everything we could have hoped for , &quot; Bingaman said . The High-Stakes Battle Over Software Microsoft Corp. ' s agreement with the Justice_Department and the European Commission ends one of the highest-profile antitrust investigations ever . Here are some key elements in the drama : THE AGREEMENT * Microsoft required computer makers to pay a fee for each machine shipped even if it contained another software maker ' s operating system . This allegedly gave Microsoft an advantage by forcing makers to pay two royalties if they wanted to use a competitor ' s operating system . The agreement ends this practice . * Microsoft required computer makers to sign lengthy contracts that often prevented customers from buying more advanced products . The government charged this discouraged new competitors . The agreement bans contracts longer than one year . * Software designers who created applications using Microsoft ' s operating system had to sign confidentially agreements precluding them from working with Microsoft ' s competitors . That in_effect tied the new products only to Microsoft . The agreement prohibit overly restrictive confidentially contracts . * The deal with the Justice_Department will have the force of law after it is approved by a judge . It lasts for 6 years . THE IMPACT * Will lead to greater competition and perhaps a broader range of products . * May eventually lower prices for consumers . * Could create confusion at the retail level and hard choices for consumers over what products to buy . THE MARKETPLACE * Microsoft has dominated the business for operating systems , which control basic computer functions , with its DOS and Windows products . Market share figures are for 1993 . DOS : 39 % DIS with Windows : 35 % Macintosh : 9 % Unix : 7 % Others : 6 % IBM OS-2 : 3.5 % * Software dominance has kept Microsoft ' s revenues and profits rising steadily . Revenues in billions of dollars ' 93 : $ 3.75 billion THE TIME FRAME March 1991 : Microsoft and IBM reveal that Federal Trade Commission has begun investigating both companies for potential anti-competitive practices . April 1991 : Microsoft says FTC investigation has been broadened to include nearly all_of its operations . April 1992 : Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates says he is not worried about the FTC investigation and other legal problems as business booms . February 1993 : FTC Chairman Janet D . Steiger seeks a preliminary injunction barring Microsoft from using unfair tactics . But board deadlocks on taking action . July 1993 : Justice_Department steps_in to review the Microsoft complaint . August 1993 : FTC folds its inquiry , but the Justice_Department officially launches its own people . June 1993 : Federal prosecutors say they are holding negotiations with Microsoft as they were close to filing a lawsuit . July 1994 : Microsoft avoids a lawsuit by agreeing with Justice_Department and the European Community to end unlawful anti-competitive practices . Source : Associated Press</TEXT>
