   <HEADLINE> THE SUNDAY PROFILE ; IN THE BEST OF HANDS ; HERE AND AROUND THE WORLD , DR . RANDY SHERMAN REPAIRS DEVASTATING WOUNDS INFLICTED BY NATURE AND ACCIDENTS . ONLY FAMILY AND FLYING , PERHAPS , BRING HIM MORE HAPPINESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Unlike the others , the boy ridiculed by classmates as medio beso , or half-kiss , does not squirm as he gets closer to the operating_room and Dr. Randy Sherman . Maicol Diaz has waited too long , prayed too hard for this day , and now that it is here , he is treating it like a big adventure . Barefoot and dressed in hospital pajamas and an orange plastic visor , Maicol shoots smiles at the nurses and happily greets Sherman , a Los Angeles plastic_surgeon who speaks_to him in passable Spanish . Sitting on the surgery table on the fourth floor of Hospital Infantil , the children ' s hospital , Maicol looks_out the window and sees the tidy red-tile rooftops and weather-beaten brick and stucco walls of the small homes and businesses in the neighborhood . Beyond them are the scalloped shapes of the Andes , topped by a slate_roof of low clouds . Maicol takes a last look , then lies back so they can put him under . He was born with a cleft in his lip : a large , ugly separation that has pulled_up and stretched the right side of his mouth and nose for all his nine years , exposing gums and a cluster of badly aligned teeth . Had Maicol been born in the United States , the congenital disability almost certainly would have been surgically corrected shortly after birth . But this is Colombia , and it has not been fixed . He has been forced to live with the deformity . Tormented by classmates , Maicol quit school when he was 7 , his father says . &quot; He is a tough kid , &quot; Gonzalo Diaz says . &quot; But they kept calling him bad names , like medio beso . The names made him sad , angry . He got_in fights . Finally , he quit school. &quot; As surgeries go , this one does not pose much of a challenge for Sherman , who sees himself as &quot; a wound doctor , &quot; rather than as a specialist in tummy tucks , nose_jobs and face_lifts . &quot; We take_care of people ' s wounds -- congenital wounds , traumatic wounds , wounds from the ravages of cancer , &quot; he says . In Los Angeles , where he works_out of USC University Hospital and teaches at the USC School_of_Medicine , he is acclaimed for his ability to repair badly damaged hands . Drawn by the unique rewards of operating_on children such_as Maicol , Sherman regularly volunteers for missions like the one that brought him to Bogota . Past trips with Operation Smile International , a nonprofit group that exists solely to provide corrective surgeries for children , have taken him to Vietnam , China , Russia , Kenya , Ghana and Jerusalem . Maicol is Sherman ' s second patient on the first of five days of almost nonstop surgeries . He begins by painting fine lines on the boy ' s mouth in black ink , mentally rearranging the lips and mouth , imagining a perfect face . He seeks_out physical markers , such_as the Cupid ' s bow , the little heart-shaped dip on the upper lip of a normal face . And he studies the nose , which has been pulled unnaturally to the right by the cleft in the lip . Working intently , almost wordlessly , he spends just more_than an hour on Maicol , cutting , sewing , taking_apart , then rearranging . Sherman ' s gifted hands are graceful and sure . They are hands that once molded Missouri_River clay into bowls , that have played the piano with artistry . And now they are releasing Maicol from the face that has brought him so_much pain . After it is over , looking_at the changes , Sherman nods his head approvingly . An immense smile creases his face as he studies the nose , the geometry , depth and thickness of the repaired lip . &quot; See the rectangular shape of that nostril ? &quot; he asks . &quot; It ' s almost a perfect match to the other one. &quot; The success erases the fatigue of the 12-hour trip from Los Angeles , makes a memory of the start-up jitters that go_with working in an unfamiliar hospital . &quot; It ' s very wonderful to take a kid who has such an outstanding facial defect and normalize him , &quot; Sherman says . &quot; We don ' t know whether the kid ' s going_to grow_up to be the president or a criminal . . . . You have given them a little more of an equal chance . What more can you give someone ? &quot; Then , it ' s back to Surgery Room II , where the next patient is waiting . Her name is Irma . A lively 6-month-old , she has big brown eyes that never seem to rest . Irma has been brought_to the hospital from a local orphanage . Its administrators would like to place her with an American family , and they believe surgery will make that possible . Inspecting the little_girl , Sherman sees that she has a more serious problem than Maicol -- a bilateral cleft , or two gaping openings on each side of the mouth that stretch to the nose . He knows that Irma will need follow-up surgeries . On the plus side , she has what he calls &quot; fresh lips , &quot; meaning no doctor has worked_on them , and he can do the surgery right the first time . &quot; Let ' s go , &quot; he says , turning_to scrub . * And so it will be as if all_the stars were laughing , when you look_at the sky at night . . . . And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look_up at the sky ! Then you will say to them , &quot; Yes , the stars always make me laugh ! &quot; And they will think you are crazy . . . . -- Antoine de Saint-Exupery in &quot; The Little Prince &quot; * Sherman , 43 , says he caught the flying bug while reading &quot; The Little Prince &quot; in the third grade . He still loves the book and gives_away copies to friends . He even calls one of his three dogs Saint-Exupery . The passage captures Sherman ' s spirit , but it ' s off in one respect : His friends would not be astonished to see him laughing as he looked skyward . &quot; He is the only person I ever met who learned to fly at night , &quot; David Weininger , Sherman ' s best_friend , says approvingly . The two became friends after meeting at the University of Rochester in central New York . Sherman , describing Weininger , may as well be describing himself : &quot; He likes to fly . He likes to look_at the stars . And he is very simple about life. &quot; One day this summer , weeks before leaving for Bogota , Sherman stood on a runway at Santa Monica Airport , where he had been giving rides to teen-agers in an open cockpit biplane as part of the Young Eagles youth aviation program . &quot; Flying is extraordinarily romantic , &quot; Sherman said , wearing a brown leather bomber_jacket , his head and face covered by goggles and a World_War I-era flying cap . &quot; When you are out over the Pacific , and the sun is low in the sky , and you are cruising along at 2 # 500 feet , and the wind is in your face . . . . Well , I mean , what ' s better than that ? &quot; Recalling flights to the Arctic_Circle and throughout North_America , he adds : &quot; There is nothing like standing on the runway right before dawn , getting ready to get_into the airplane to go_to Vancouver or Anchorage or Aspen or Mexico or even San Bernardino . A runway is that kind of magic door. &quot; Santa Monica ' s Museum of Flying , which loaned Sherman the biplane , figured in both the courtship of and marriage to his wife , Sandi , a real_estate attorney . She met her future husband while he was negotiating the purchase of the home they now live_in , with 5-month-old son Max , atop Kenter Canyon in Brentwood . Sherman , who had been married briefly during his surgical residency in San Francisco , offered her a helicopter ride . She passed . &quot; It was something she absolutely didn ' t want to do , &quot; Sherman says . But Sandi , a volunteer for a group called Caring_for Babies With AIDS , remembered the offer and called one day to ask if she could bring some children to the airport for a tour . They began dating and were married at the Museum of Flying in 1992 . Although not thrilled by her husband ' s flying , Sandi Sherman accepts it . &quot; We met when we were both sort of established . This was like a package deal , &quot; she says , gesturing to her husband and the sky . &quot; The flying makes me nervous , but at_the_same_time Randy loves it . How do you take that away from him ? &quot; When they were dating , Sandi remembers that her future husband , juggling surgery , flying and volunteer work , kept falling_asleep . &quot; My friends referred to him as the narcoleptic microsurgeon because he only has , like , full speed or stop . Every time we went_out , he fell_asleep . He sits_down , he falls_asleep -- in movies , at dinners . I just thought he hated me , &quot; she says . Determined to get his pilot ' s license , Sherman had taken flying lessons after the long shifts required by his surgical residency at UC San Francisco Medical_Center . After a lesson , recalls Weininger , a chemist who lives_in Santa Fe , N.M. , Sherman would sometimes play piano in a Haight-Ashbury jazz club . &quot; Randy balances one stress against another . As soon as something comes_up , he puts something else on top of it , &quot; Weininger says . * Knowing that Sherman is a plastic_surgeon , people can ' t help but wonder about the nose . They figure he has the resources to fix things , right , so . . . ? Sherman ' s nose , broken repeatedly while playing football , is mashed in , knobby , like a prizefighter ' s . It also says something about his priorities , and sometimes causes trouble in a field long identified with cosmetic beauty . &quot; A woman once came_in_for a consult , &quot; he recalls . &quot; We were almost finished when she looked_at me , then kind of turned_away and asked : ' I have only one question : Why don ' t you have your nose done ? ' &quot; He laughs_at the memory . &quot; I said , ' I did , I had my nose done about four times on the football field. ' Needless to say , she didn ' t book. &quot; Sherman does cosmetic_surgery , but his specialty is reconstructive surgery -- correcting birth_defects , reattaching limbs , repairing the devastation caused by fire , gunshots or industrial accidents . &quot; There is this classic reaction I get when people hear my husband is a plastic_surgeon , &quot; Sandi Sherman says . &quot; They say , ' Oh , can he do my eyelids ? ' I say , ' No , no , chop_off your hand and then we ' ll talk. ' &quot; Sherman ' s march into the surgery room followed a twisting path . He never knew his father , who died when Sherman was a baby . He and two older brothers , Andy and Farrel , were raised by their mother , Pearl . &quot; She is an extraordinary woman , &quot; Sherman says . &quot; She lost my father when she was 33 . She was left to raise three kids , all under 5 years old. &quot; Growing_up , one important mentor was Dr. Bernard Jaffe , the physician for Sherman ' s Clayton , Mo. , high_school football_team . Now vice_chairman of surgery at Tulane University Medical_School , Jaffe helped Sherman through knee surgeries and broken noses . He became a role_model and surrogate father . &quot; We love each other a lot , &quot; Sherman says . Turning_down football scholarships to two Big Eight Conference schools , Sherman chose the small but academically demanding University of Rochester , Jaffe ' s alma_mater . There , he gained distinction as the barefooted punter who performed in frigid temperatures . After two years at the University of Missouri Medical_School , Sherman became restless and left . This was in the early 1970s , a prime_time for what Sherman calls his &quot; hippie phase. &quot; He joined a commune on the banks of the Missouri_River , lived_in a tent and learned to make pottery . &quot; He was going_through growing pains , &quot; Jaffe recalls . Within months , and without admonishments from Jaffe , Sherman ' s interest in medicine returned . At USC University Hospital , he heads the team of highly specialized microvascular surgeons who earlier this year performed the rare surgical feat of reattaching the scalp of a young_woman , Patsy Bogle , who had been hurt in an industrial accident . Sherman oversees a 24-hour , 7-day-a-week countywide &quot; replantation hot_line , &quot; which offers emergency services to people who lose limbs . Despite his professional accomplishments , and the humanitarian award he received this year from the California Medical_Center , Sherman believes he faces an uncertain future . For one thing , he wonders whether surgeons like him will have a place in the rapidly evolving world of medicine and managed care . Already , the third-party second-guessing of his treatment plans -- by insurance_companies mostly -- infuriates him . &quot; You train doctors for nine years to know how to treat people and then you start having administrators tell them what tests they can order and can ' t order , what procedures they can and can ' t do , &quot; he says . &quot; I am seeing the deterioration of something that I hold_dear , which is the quality of what I do. &quot; As a player in academic medicine , he spends much of his time overseeing the education of young plastic_surgeons , lecturing at conferences and seminars all_over North_America , writing papers , helping to edit peer-review journals . But capturing a spot on the academic fast-track and keeping it can be tricky . Even so , academic medicine , he believes , is something &quot; you can ' t hold_on to forever. &quot; One day you may wake_up and find &quot; everybody is moving one way and you ' re moving the other , &quot; Sherman says , and then &quot; it ' s time to get out. &quot; * Sherman brought those concerns with him to Bogota , but he was soon too busy to dwell_on them . The beauty of the trip is the simplicity of the Operation Smile mission : to take_care of children , each badly in need , one after the other , from sunrise to nightfall . He finds the rewards immediate and profound . &quot; Where else in the world can you go and do an operation , do anything for a person , and change them so dramatically , so drastically , so graphically ? &quot; asks Sherman , who stayed with a contingent of volunteers at a Spartan but supremely peaceful convent-turned-hotel run_by the Sisters of the Poor . &quot; The bottom_line is , you help children . It ' s that simple. &quot; That is the vision of Dr. Bill Magee , a Norfolk , Va. , plastic_surgeon who co-founded Operation Smile with his wife , Kathy , in 1982 . Reflecting on the motivation for moving 4 # 100 pounds of medical equipment and more_than 35 surgeons , nurses , anesthesiologists and others to Bogota , Magee offers the case of one of his first patients , a 35-year-old man with a hideously deformed mouth . &quot; Try to imagine living 35 years of your life and never feeling the gentleness of a kiss , &quot; he says . On the day before Sherman is to leave , two things stand_out . First , Maicol Diaz comes_back for a follow-up examination . The lip is healing perfectly and looks great . There are smiles all around . &quot; Bien , bien , &quot; Maicol ' s father says . &quot; With the operation and all your help , he will go_back to school. &quot; The second involves the worst case Sherman comes_across on this trip . Juan Vargas , 8 , was in a Bogota factory looking_for his father when a heavy automatic door closed on his foot . It was crushed . Sherman meets the boy on Sunday evening , five weeks after the accident . The local doctors had just covered the wound and left it , hoping the microsurgeon due soon from Los Angeles would have some answers . Sherman is appalled by what he sees . The boy , lying on a cot in a six-bed ward , is in such intense pain that he cries_out in agony even as doctors reach down to take_off his bandage . The next day , having decided to put the boy under anesthetic before looking_at the wound , Sherman finds the foot badly infected . A significant part of it is simply gone . Sherman is confronted with two options , neither of which he finds attractive . One is to attempt a complicated surgery known as a &quot; free flap , &quot; in which muscle and tissue taken from the boy ' s shoulder and thigh would be attached_to the missing part of the foot . Sherman isn ' t sure . What troubles him is that , even if the proposed operation is successful , Juan would require follow-up surgeries , including complex bone grafts . Remembering the neglected state he found the boy in , Sherman has serious doubts that Juan would get the care . Option two is to amputate part of the foot , with enough remaining so that Juan could walk freely . Sherman thinks this might be the cleanest , most humane thing to do . &quot; He ' d be back on his feet in no time and would never have to come_to the hospital again , &quot; he says . Still , it is decided to try to save Juan ' s whole foot . Sherman works for 3 1 / 2 hours , with the help of a Bogota surgical resident . Medical_students peer over his shoulder , watching the meticulous microsurgery unfold . The sewing up of veins and arteries requires a high-powered surgical microscope . Once the operation is over , Sherman spends several tense hours wondering whether the graft will take . Around nightfall he holds a Doppler , a highly_sensitive listening device , to the gauze-wrapped area just above Juan ' s foot . Suddenly , Sherman hears a rhythmic &quot; whoosh , whoosh , whoosh. &quot; The doctor smiles broadly . &quot; that ' s a great pulse , &quot; he says . Walking down the hall , free to relax after 12 grueling hours , the squealing babies , concerned parents , language problems and little crises behind him , Sherman is a happy , contented man . &quot; It always surprises me how well things turn_out in the midst of all this chaos , &quot; he says . Dr. Randy Sherman Age : 43 . Native ? : No ; born in Clayton , Mo. , now lives_in Brentwood . Family : Married for two years to Sandi Sherman , with whom he has a 5-month-old son , Max . Passions : Family , flying , medicine . On becoming a surgeon : &quot; The demands put_on you are physical , intellectual , psychological , and they are unrelenting . There is never really a down time . People are always evaluating you , everything you do gets a mark , and just when you think you have it mastered , you get pushed_up to the next level . That goes_on year after year after year. &quot; On the appeal of flying : &quot; For a driven individual , it ' s the perfect kind of hobby , because you can always improve your skills , you can always improve your proficiency , you can always get more into it . It ' s not the kind of hobby that you can say , ' OK , I ' ve mastered this. ' &quot; On being raised by his widowed mother : &quot; I never acutely felt the loss of a father , which means my mother was doing double duty . She was incredibly compassionate . You could just tell that she would never let you down . Never . I probably was used to every third night on call_at the hospital , because I had every third night on call with the dishes since I was 5. &quot;</TEXT>
