   <HEADLINE> SOFTER VERSION OF BERGESON ' S 1-STRIKE BILL WINS KEY VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A key Senate committee on Tuesday softened but ultimately approved an Orange County lawmaker ' s one-strike bill that would set sentences for some first-time rapists and child_molesters at 25 years to life . The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the measure by Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) on an 8-0 vote , but not before narrowing the scope of the legislation so it now reaches only the worst offenders . Bergeson began to carry the bill at the behest of Gov . Pete Wilson , who has made the rape measure one of the centerpieces of his election-year fight on crime . As originally drafted , the bill required a blanket sentence of life without the possibility of parole for nearly all sex offenses . That tough stance drew broad attacks from civil libertarians and other groups , including some district_attorneys and women ' s organizations , who said the measure was so harsh it might actually hinder prosecutions or prompt rapists to kill their victims . Bergeson redrafted the bill to delete all references_to sentences of life without parole , substituting a penalty of 25 years to life for the most serious offenses and doubling current penalties -- now ranging from three to eight years -- for all others . The Judiciary Committee went even further Tuesday to tone_down the measure , most directly by eliminating the doubled penalties for less-serious sex offenses . As now drafted , a rapist or child_molester could get the maximum sentence of 25 years to life only if one of the following circumstances applied : The victim was kidnaped ; she suffered great bodily injury ; the rape was committed during a burglary ; a deadly weapon was used ; multiple victims were attacked ; or the rapist had a previous felony conviction for a sex offense . Bergeson said she was pleased that the measure had survived the committee and expressed hope that it will be signed into law . &quot; The committee ' s changes didn ' t take_away the force of the one-strike provisions , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; It ' s a bill I think we all can be proud of. &quot; Her measure still faces several tough votes_in the months to come -- and will be competing with a bill authored by Assemblyman Bob Epple ( D-Cerritos ) , who chairs the Assembly Public Safety Committee . Epple ' s measure would apply a life sentence only when rape was committed during a kidnaping or residential burglary at_the_same_time that a weapon was used or a victim suffered great bodily harm .</TEXT>
