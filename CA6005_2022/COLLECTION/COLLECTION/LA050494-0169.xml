   <TEXT> It was the prostitute loitering in his driveway that tipped the balance for Patrick Donnelly . For Karen DeMasi-Risk , it was the drive-by_shooting just a_few houses down from her own . All the residents of the Five Oaks neighborhood can identify the moment when they felt the streets around their homes slipping from their control . In the summer of 1991 , this integrated , middle-class area just north of downtown seemed on the brink of collapse . Suburban commuters dodging a nearby interstate clogged the residential streets at rush_hour . Chipped paint and rotting porches testified to sinking home values and absentee landlords . Open-air drug deals , random gunfire and prostitution were snaking from the neighborhood ' s scruffy periphery into its heart . After conventional police crackdowns failed , the city and neighborhood association , almost in desperation , brought_in architect Oscar Newman , known for his innovative design responses to urban problems . Newman surveyed Five Oaks and devised a solution at once simple and radical : With brick and iron gates , he closed_off 35 streets and 26 alleys across the neighborhood to all but pedestrians . His aims : to eliminate commuter_traffic , to make the area harder to navigate for people cruising off the interstate for drugs and prostitutes , and to give residents a greater sense of control over the public spaces around their homes . One year later , the results have been dramatic . Traffic has plummeted , neighborhood watch activities have increased , housing prices are up 15 % , violent crime has dropped_in half and arrests for burglary , auto theft and vandalism have fallen sharply . With this aggressive initiative to arrest a cycle of disorder in Five Oaks , Dayton joined a new urban policy movement that has raised complex questions of rights , responsibilities and fairness from coast to coast . A loose network of law_enforcement officials , architects and urban theorists is advancing an agenda to combat threatening behavior in public spaces , particularly city streets and parks . By cracking_down on rowdy teen-agers , aggressive panhandlers , low-level drug dealers and prostitutes , they are trying to nip disorder and incivility before they lead to more serious crime . In its quest to dispel some of the menace clouding urban life , Dayton has not gone as far as some cities , whose emphasis on law_enforcement has raised stiff objections from civil libertarians . Even such traditionally liberal bastions as San Francisco and Seattle are pushing ordinances to restrict aggressive panhandling . New efforts to combat truancy are sprouting in Milwaukee and St . Louis . In New York City , Mayor Rudolph W . Giuliani and his police_commissioner , William J . Bratton , have built their law_enforcement strategy around a coordinated attack on all_of these &quot; quality_of_life &quot; violations , from graffiti and street prostitution to small-time drug dealing and truancy . In the spirit of Newman ' s work in Dayton , others are redesigning urban parks , including Bryant Park in Manhattan and Pershing Square in Los Angeles , to attract nearby workers and discourage drug-dealing and panhandling . And dozens of cities , including Los Angeles , are moving toward community-based policing -- more officers walking a beat and combatting disorder . These efforts to reclaim public spaces are based on the theory that disorderly_conduct , by signaling a breakdown in social and law_enforcement controls , leads to more serious law-breaking . In a classic 1982 article in The Atlantic , criminal justice experts George L . Kelling and James Q . Wilson concluded that disorder invites more serious crime in the way that broken windows on a car invite vandals to strip the tires . &quot; We start with the premise of the broken windows theory -- it is important to maintain a sense of order , and for people to feel the public spaces are available to them , &quot; says Jeremy Travis , deputy commissioner of police for legal matters in New York City . &quot; Our belief is that if you take_care of the little things , the big things will follow. &quot; Civil libertarians and homeless advocates denounce these attempts to restrict panhandling as authoritarian efforts to shelter the middle_class from the problems of destitution . They charge that &quot; defensible space &quot; plans such_as Five Oaks ' are really intended to exclude minorities . Without greater efforts to shelter the homeless and treat those addicted to drugs , they argue , attempts to impose order through law_enforcement will only overload police_departments and courts that are already groaning under the weight of more serious crimes . &quot; The trouble with all_of these proposals is they just focus_on reclaiming public spaces through more punitive measures . . . rather than focusing_on the underlying problems and trying to deal with them in a more humane way , &quot; says Ramona Ripston , executive_director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California . Advocates of the public spaces agenda counter that disorder is not only a symptom but a cause of urban distress . As much as muggings or burglary , they maintain , threatening street behavior drives the middle_class from cities . With arguments that parallel calls_for greater personal responsibility from the recipients of government aid , they say that while society is obliged to help the needy , it must also demand minimum standards of personal conduct from everyone . &quot; These initiatives are coming from the cities regarded_as the most progressive , the most enlightened and tolerant , &quot; says Robert Teir , general counsel for the American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities , a group supporting these new laws . &quot; These cities seem to have concluded that a tolerance for diversity doesn ' t have to mean an end to standards of public conduct. &quot; This nascent movement has caught the attention of senior White_House officials . William A . Galston , deputy director of domestic policy for President Clinton , recently hosted a private daylong seminar at the White_House with Kelling , Travis , George_Washington University sociologist Amitai Etzioni and other advocates of the order agenda . Beneath the rhetorical volleys , the debate is actually about balancing the enduring American values of order and liberty . Few Americans would want to live_in cities that enforce order as enthusiastically as Singapore , where chewing gum is illegal and graffiti can be cause for caning . And only the purest civil libertarians argue that the First_Amendment protects all street behavior short of assault . &quot; We are trying to strike a balance between individual civil_liberties like freedom_of_speech and freedom of movement against the rights of the community to expect certain minimum standards of behavior that are necessary to preserve a well-ordered community , &quot; says Seattle City Atty . Mark Sidran , who drafted that city ' s law against aggressive panhandling . For law_enforcement officials , this renewed focus_on order carries a distant echo . Maintaining urban order was the principal mission of police_departments when they were formed in the mid-19th Century : &quot; They preserved the public peace ; they monitored public spaces , &quot; wrote one historian . But over time police shifted their focus from maintaining order to responding to crime . In large part the change came because of growing concern that maintaining order was a euphemism for suppressing minorities and others viewed_as undesirable . In 1972 , the U.S. Supreme Court accelerated the transformation by invalidating vagrancy laws -- the principal legal tool used by law_enforcement to regulate street behavior -- for being unconstitutionally vague and granting police too_much discretion . Cities then advanced broad anti-loitering laws that , unlike vagrancy statutes , banned particular forms of behavior such_as panhandling and soliciting prostitution . But the courts generally also have rejected this approach as too broad . A federal appeals court in 1993 voided a New York state law that amounted to a complete ban on begging , saying that it violated the First_Amendment rights of the poor . Cities have responded by still more precisely identifying prohibited street behavior . Seattle is typical . It is considered relatively generous in its policies toward the homeless . But as the number of street people has increased , particularly in shopping areas , merchants grew increasingly fearful of lost business and pushed the city to restrict disruptive begging . Last fall the City_Council passed ordinances that bar sitting or lying on the streets during business hours and outlaw aggressive panhandling that could &quot; intimidate &quot; pedestrians . Sidran says the measures were necessary to prevent a &quot; dangerous downward spiral &quot; that would invite more crime . But to John Fox , coordinator for the Seattle Displacement Coalition , the measures sought only to &quot; drive homeless people out of public places &quot; where they might offend shoppers and tourists . Homeless advocates quickly filed suit to overturn the new laws . In early March a federal_district court upheld the city ' s ban on sitting or lying_in the streets and trimmed -- but did not overturn -- the restrictions on panhandling . Five days after the Seattle decision , another federal_district court judge denied a motion from homeless advocates for an injunction against aspects of San Francisco ' s coordinated crackdown on public drinking , obstruction of sidewalks and aggressive panhandling . Teir says those decisions show that courts now appear willing to give cities more freedom to regulate street behavior if they narrowly tailor their restrictions and have a history of providing services to the homeless . But Beth Andrus , attorney for the Seattle coalition appealing the district court decision , says these initiatives remain vulnerable if they criminalize innocent conduct , such_as sitting in the street . The final boundaries on cities ' ability to regulate panhandling will not be set until the Supreme Court tackles one of these cases , which probably won ' t be for at least two years , Teir predicts . Truancy crackdowns , propelled by the same concerns , have raised a different set of issues . In some cities , truancy initiatives have been almost entirely non-controversial . Since last November , Milwaukee police have been rounding_up 30 to 40 truants daily and taking them -- typically in handcuffs -- to centers run_by the the city ' s Boys and Girls Clubs . At the centers , counselors advise the students on programs the clubs offer , and sheriff ' s deputies notify their parents , who are obliged to retrieve them . The program has drawn almost no complaints from parents and community leaders -- and high marks from law_enforcement . Police have confiscated weapons and drugs from truants , and officials at the centers say that few students swept_up a first time have been found on the streets again . &quot; We ' ve all been talking_about crime prevention , &quot; says Milwaukee County Sheriff Richard Artison , an enthusiastic supporter . &quot; This is one of the best ways. &quot; But in other cities , critics hear echoes of the discredited vagrancy laws . In New York , the American Civil Liberties Union fears that truancy sweeps will come_down hardest on black and Latino students . In Philadelphia , the Board_of_Education was forced to shelve a Milwaukee-like plan this year when several City_Council members recoiled from the prospect that police would demand identification and even handcuff youths because they were not in school . &quot; We had City_Council members who described the proposal as turning Philadelphia into South_Africa in terms of stopping people and asking them for ID , &quot; says Jane Malone , who studied truancy for the organization Philadelphia Citizens For Children and Youth . And yet in some cities , heavily minority neighborhoods are among those clamoring loudest for greater efforts to suppress disorder . Some community organizers argue that the loss of parks and other public spaces to disruptive behavior most harms lower-income residents , who cannot retreat to country_clubs or private pools . &quot; In the nice white communities don ' t be drunk on the street , don ' t be throwing down litter , the cops will stop you , &quot; says Ace Backus , a community organizer for the Sherman Park Community Assn . in Milwaukee . &quot; In the middle of the black ghetto you can do that and the police will drive past . It ' s reverse discrimination. &quot; Racial politics also shadowed the redesign plan in Five Oaks . Some residents , both black_and_white , complained that the plan was designed to wall off the community from an almost all-black neighborhood to its southwest . Those criticisms did not derail the plan , primarily because Five Oaks itself is integrated . But the allegation of discrimination and exclusion remains a sore point in Dayton and virtually everywhere cities have taken steps aimed at deterring disorder . For all_the political and legal fireworks that the order agenda is generating , its impact remains uncertain . &quot; Why do they think if you pass another law , police will be able to enforce it ? &quot; Ripston wonders . Still , the order advocates can claim some successes . As chief of New York ' s transit police in the 1980s , Bratton implemented an anti-crime strategy that emphasized regulating disorderly_behavior . From 1990 to 1993 , subway robberies and assaults dropped_by about 40 % . In Five Oaks , Newman ' s plan -- supplemented by targeted police and housing code violation enforcement and an assistance program to encourage homeowners and landlords to spruce_up properties -- has lifted the cloud of demoralization over the neighborhood , residents say . On a warm night earlier this spring , children and families had almost entirely supplanted cars on the tree-lined streets . Two summers earlier , said Patrick Donnelly , families avoided the streets for fear that cars would screech away at high speeds from drug deals . As families have moved_back onto their front_porches , the area has experienced what some here term the reverse of the &quot; broken windows &quot; cycle . With more families in the streets , residents feel more confident censuring disorderly_behavior , and the heightened vigilance has made the area less hospitable to criminals , says Major Jaruth Durham-Jefferson of the Dayton Police_Department . &quot; In the minds of some residents , this was about setting_up a zone that we could defend , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s not that at all . It ' s setting_up a zone where they can have more control. &quot; There is a strong sense that all_of these gains are fragile . Drug dealing remains a problem in some areas , and the daily conflicts of a racially and economically diverse population persist . The lesson here may be that in urban_areas , disorder is like the tide : It can be held_back only with constant exertion . &quot; We ' re not sitting_back saying we ' ve got the streets closed , we ' re done , &quot; says Karen DeMasi-Risk , who has lived_in Five Oaks for 14 years . &quot; We ' re not done . Now we are saying , ' We can breathe , what ' s the next step ? ' It never stops. &quot;</TEXT>
