   <HEADLINE> WHAT ' S THAT SMELL IN HERE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is there no limit to the cynicism and gall of the cigarette industry ? Now comes the R . J . Reynolds Tobacco Co . with a cute new promotion putting the puckish images of Old Joe Camel and his fellow cartoon dromedaries on &quot; collector ' s packs &quot; of its Camel cigarettes . This just two weeks after tobacco executives prevaricated , dodged and slunk before a congressional committee looking_into the addiction and disease caused by their product . This after studies showing that children as young as 6 are familiar_with Old Joe , that adolescents are being drawn into smoking at alarming rates and that Camel ' s share of the youth market has grown since the cartoon advertising began . The daunting news from the most recent surgeon_general ' s report on smoking and health is that one of every three youngsters in this country uses tobacco by age 18 -- despite all_the warnings about the clear_and_present_dangers of smoking and chewing tobacco . The Reynolds move is a clever marketing device , one obviously meant to link the product directly to the advertising that uses the rakish and hip cartoon caricatures of animals . The company asserts that the advertising is not aimed at youngsters , that the new cardboard packs are , as a spokeswoman put it , &quot; just a fun thing &quot; for current adult smokers . And it rests_on the free-speech guarantees of the First_Amendment . We smell in all this more_than just the foul odor of secondhand smoke . As Big Daddy said to Brick_in Tennessee Williams ' &quot; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof &quot; : &quot; What ' s that smell in this room ? Didn ' t you notice it , Brick ? Didn ' t you notice a powerful and obnoxious odor of mendacity in this room ? &quot;</TEXT>
