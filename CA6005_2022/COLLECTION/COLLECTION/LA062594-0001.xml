   <HEADLINE> MINISTER QUITS IN ANGER OVER MEXICO ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo MacGregor resigned Friday in a move that undercut the credibility of this nation ' s planned presidential elections . &quot; I am more_than angry , I am indignant and disillusioned , &quot; he wrote to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in a resignation letter in which he accused politicians of lies and libel in connection with preparations for the Aug . 21 vote . &quot; One has to know when to leave . That moment , for dignity and conviction , has arrived. &quot; Salinas refused to accept the resignation . He said in a statement that talks with Carpizo -- a former attorney_general and chairman of the government human_rights commission -- will continue through the weekend . But whether Carpizo ultimately resigns , the political salvo he fired Friday &quot; is a serious blow to the whole electoral process , &quot; analyst Jorge Castaneda said . Mexico is in the midst of its most closely contested election in more_than six decades . Analysts have insisted that clean elections may be the most critical means to diffuse the growing threat of social unrest . In the last year , Mexico has suffered a peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas , the assassination of the leading presidential candidate and a rash of kidnapings of prominent executives . Carpizo ' s appointment to head the Interior Ministry -- which has been the government_agency traditionally blamed for questionable or unscrupulous electoral conduct -- was considered the best guarantee of a fair vote_in a country where election_fraud has been so endemic as_to almost become part of the national folklore . that ' s because integrity has been Carpizo ' s main political asset . But Carpizo , who vowed Friday to never again accept a political appointment , said he could no longer work impartially with one Mexican political_party because of actions by one of its sectors . He did not specify which party . On the Mexican stock_exchange , investors reacted quickly to news of Carpizo ' s resignation . The Bolsa stock index , which had been down 20 points before the news hit , plunged to a loss of 55.66 points for the day , to 2 # 187.27. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , and the Democratic Revolutionary Party , or PRD , an outspoken opposition party , immediately blamed each other for Carpizo ' s resignation . The PRD -- whose presidential candidate , Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , is widely believed to have lost the 1988 presidential election because of fraud -- has been highly critical of measures that officials have proposed to prevent electoral wrongdoing in the August presidential vote . PRD activists earlier this month applied for and received duplicate voter credentials , then showed them publicly to prove just how easily the system could be duped . Election officials responded by filing legal_action against them . In its statement , the ruling party called_on the PRD to &quot; get_rid_of its confrontational attitude and to avoid obstructionist actions. &quot; But Cardenas , after speaking_to a business conference in southern Mexico , told reporters that he believed that Carpizo had &quot; meant the ruling party &quot; had prompted his resignation . Meantime , divisions within the ruling party have also grown evident as its presidential candidate , Ernesto Zedillo , publicly attacked former Mexico_City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis for failing to get a peace agreement with rebels in Chiapas . Camacho Solis , whom many consider a proponent of more democracy , resigned . &quot; With that , Zedillo ' s supporters became determined to seat him in the presidential chair , &quot; said economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O . Other opposition parties released statements urging Salinas not to accept Carpizo ' s resignation . Mexican election officials have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on voter registration rolls and an accreditation system , as well as a sophisticated computer setup to count votes . All this effort has been aimed at averting a national embarrassment similar to what occurred in 1988 : While opposition candidate Cardenas was in_the_lead , the computerized national vote-counting system suspiciously crashed ; Salinas went_on to win the contest by the narrowest margin ever accorded a PRI candidate . Besides concerns about elections , analysts have said it was critical to have a politician of Carpizo ' s integrity in the Interior Ministry because of the agency ' s involvement in other delicate issues : The ministry , for example , is overseeing the controversial investigation into the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , which is being conducted by a special prosecutor . Mexicans have already expressed grave doubts as_to whether the investigation will fairly determine Colosio ' s killer .</TEXT>
