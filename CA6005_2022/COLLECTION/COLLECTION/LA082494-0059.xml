   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : CARLOS TAKES TINSELTOWN ? HE COULD ' VE BEEN A TERROR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s not easy being a pudgy former terrorist in the throes of a midlife crisis . Although initial reports indicated that Carlos , the infamous international operative , was arrested 10 days ago at a Sudanese hotel , a London newspaper reported Sunday that French agents actually nabbed him in a hospital . According to The Observer , he was picked_up just after receiving general_anesthesia in preparation for surgery . The French were able to make their move thanks to Egyptian authorities , who had provided the_French with a detailed dossier on Carlos , complete with pictures and videotapes . In one of the tapes , he is shown socializing at Khartoum parties , and in at least one instance , his girlfriend &quot; chides him for not taking better care of his appearance. &quot; News_reports chronicling the terrorist ' s hard-living ways suggest to me that the surgery from which he might have benefited most is a liver transplant . But Carlos -- who has used his wits and cunning to elude authorities for more_than two decades -- could not , apparently , elude the perils of_his_own appetite . . . or his girlfriend ' s nagging . * So what kind of surgery was the scourge of counterterrorism about to have ? Liposuction . The objective : removal of excess fat from his midriff . But his unsightly bulges are dwarfed by the rest of his problems . Having failed in his misguided efforts to cripple the running dogs of capitalism , Carlos , after 20 years on the lam , has become not only fat but beside the point . &quot; A whiskey-swilling Communist who doesn ' t believe_in God isn ' t much use to any Islamic government , &quot; said one former CIA official . &quot; For most of the last decade , he ' s been dead drunk in Damascus. &quot; &quot; He ' s a terrorist emeritus , &quot; said a counterterrorism expert . So what ' s a terrorist emeritus to do ? According to my highly placed sources , Carlos had decided to take the next train to Tinseltown . Which is how the_French agents came_to find him on a Sudanese gurney , moments away from terminating those unsightly love handles . * Liposuction , you see , was merely a first_step in the repackaging of Carlos . The next steps would include lipo-reinjection , getting a good agent , learning to work the crowd at Morton ' s , joining a 12-step program , and hitting the talk-show trail with segments on &quot; Your Wounded Inner Terrorist. &quot; Through my sources , I was able to beat_out Vanity_Fair and Diane Sawyer for an exclusive interview with Carlos about his career aspirations . He told me he hopes to position himself as a cross between a Marxist Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rodney Dangerfield -- a revolutionary who can ' t get no respect . Ridiculous , really , but no more outlandish than the life he has already lived . He sees himself as a leading man , naturally , with a love life as explosive as any of his missions . &quot; You think terrorism is tough ? &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ll tell you what ' s tough . Juggling a girlfriend and a wife , that ' s what . My wife is a former terrorist herself , you know . &quot; For years , I spent half my time making_up excuses for why I wasn ' t anywhere near a kidnaping I was supposed to be masterminding , and the other half checking under my car for explosives my wife might have planted. &quot; that ' s what I call stress , I told him . Maybe that ' s why you let yourself go . &quot; Sure it is . I can ' t get a home-cooked meal , because I don ' t have a home , &quot; said Carlos . &quot; I busted my buns trying to tilt the balance of world_power , and all I get is two women telling me how fat I am. &quot; Sounds like they just don ' t understand you , I said . &quot; that ' s why I went_in for the liposuction , &quot; he said . &quot; It was easier than listening to them complain . And you know , I didn ' t have Sudanese health_insurance , so I was footing the entire bill with money I had managed to save from a_few Paris bombings I had organized back in the early ' 80s . &quot; What a joke . I thought I was going_to wake_up 10 pounds lighter ; instead I woke_up in handcuffs . And the damn hospital in Khartoum won ' t give me a refund . &quot; that ' s gratitude for you . Do you know how much business I ' ve thrown to hospitals ? A lot , that ' s how much. &quot; Sounds like you ' re underappreciated , I said . &quot; For years , I did other people ' s bidding -- with no pension , no sick time , no vacation pay -- then they toss me aside like a piece of rotten meat . &quot; How do they thank me ? By ratting me out for a_few lousy public relations points , the sharks . There ' s no loyalty in this business anymore. &quot; Sounds like he ' s got potential . But I don ' t know . Hollywood might just eat him alive . * Robin Abcarian ' s column is published Wednesdays and Sundays .</TEXT>
