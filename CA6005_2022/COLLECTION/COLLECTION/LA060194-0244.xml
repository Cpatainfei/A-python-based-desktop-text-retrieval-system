   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 : 16 DAYS AND COUNTING ; ON A LARK ; SOCCER SIMPLY MEANS FUN FOR COLOMBIA ' S ASPRILLA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Try as he might -- and the extent and sincerity of his effort must be seriously questioned -- Faustino Asprilla can ' t seem to adopt the attitude of a European soccer professional . The 24-year-old Colombian lives his life with a wink and a shrug . His success as a forward on Parma ' s first division team has the citizens of this tidy town in Italy ' s breadbasket chanting &quot; Tino , Tino &quot; at games with every feint and daring dribble . Asprilla ' s two years here have bonded him to a culture and people utterly different than his own -- a relationship that has enriched both parties . Fans appreciate that Asprilla , unlike some non-Italian stars , bothered to learn the language , to which he adds a decidedly Spanish flavor . The fans have learned a little of Asprilla ' s infectious South_American love of life , with all its complexities . &quot; As a person , I am happy , very happy , &quot; Asprilla said , laughing . &quot; I am always in good_humor . I like to sing. &quot; Residents of Parma love Asprilla as they would a wayward but good-hearted neighborhood kid -- the boy who habitually breaks windows with a baseball . Their tolerance was stretched when , after months of deluging his neighbors with high-decibel blasts of his beloved salsa music , Asprilla and his wife moved_out of their in-town apartment to a house where , reports say , Asprilla still plays his music at levels that shake the olives out of the trees . Still , Parma ' s adoring fans happily indulge his eccentricities , usually involving automobiles . Asprilla is aware that there are rules governing the road , he simply doesn ' t believe they apply to him . Asprilla was involved in six car accidents in his first two weeks in Italy . He once thought nothing of parking his sports_car in a busy intersection for two days , reasoning that the light had been red when he left it . . . . &quot; The players know how he is , &quot; a journalist who covers the team says . &quot; They know it is impossible to ask him to be a European player . For him , football is a game , not work . that ' s the difference . It is not right to say he ' s not professional . He ' s professional . But he ' s a South_American player , and that means football is a game and not a business. &quot; But to Parma club officials , Asprilla is big business . His modest transfer fee of $ 4.5 million two years ago would likely be doubled should Parma wish to sell him , which it doesn ' t . His salary is reported to be about $ 700 # 000 . &quot; Asprilla is our Diego Maradona , &quot; said Parma ' s president , Giorgio Pedraneschi . &quot; He is the player who can turn a match around at a moment. &quot; In last season ' s Cup Winners ' Cup competition , between the postseason tournament winners of Europe ' s pro leagues , Parma rallied to beat Dergefors of Sweden , 2-1 , when Asprilla scored two spectacular goals in eight minutes . That night , the president of Colombia called Asprilla and let him know that when he played so well he was an &quot; ambassador &quot; of Colombia . Asprilla took diplomatic license the next week against Turin in an Italian league match , scoring three goals , each showing his versatility : The first came_on a header , the second using his left foot , the third using his right foot . In the midst of his scoring run , Asprilla reverted to his old antics . The day of the game in Sweden , teammate Luigi Apolloni took Asprilla fishing at a nearby lake , although the Colombian had never fished . Asprilla saw it as an adventure , which it very nearly was . As he was rowing a small wooden boat to shore , Apolloni suddenly stood_up , causing the boat to tip . Asprilla fell_in . Fortunately , he could swim better than he could fish . When Asprilla returned to the team hotel less than an hour before the match , he offered no explanation . His philosophy was that his two goals in the game spoke_for him . Asprilla said he doesn ' t see the need to explain his sometimes erratic behavior . &quot; How I play , this is important , &quot; he said . But his biggest stunt didn ' t allow him to play in Parma ' s most important game of last season , the Cup Winners ' Cup_final against Antwerp of Belgium . Ten days before the game , Asprilla had returned to Colombia because of the death of his mother . When he returned to Italy , Asprilla limped in with a deep gash on his right calf , a cut that required 27 stitches and a month of recovery . His coach , understandably , demanded an explanation . Asprilla initially offered none , but eventually said he had stepped_on a bottle at his home ' s pool . No one believed the story , but Asprilla stuck_with it . The injury was seen as Asprilla ' s letting_down his teammates and even Parma ' s victory against Antwerp did little to soften public_opinion against him . Neither did the real story of his injury . Typically , it involved an automobile . Asprilla was driving_in Medellin and a city bus cut him off . He sped and cut_off the bus , jumped_out of his car and attempted to treat the bus to several of his free_kicks . Asprilla was already in_trouble in Colombia for an incident during World Cup qualifying . He missed a penalty kick against Paraguay and was benched . Angry and embarrassed , Asprilla sneaked_out of the team hotel and drove 150 miles in the middle of the night to see his wife , Catalina . The Colombian Football Federation wanted to ban Asprilla for life , but World Cup Coach Jose Maturana argued that the team would not qualify if Asprilla did not play . Again , Asprilla let his actions on the field speak_for him -- he scored two goals in Colombia ' s 5-0 upset of Argentina last September in World Cup qualifying . While journalists frequently bring_up these incidents , Asprilla doesn ' t care to dwell_on them . &quot; I have forgotten completely what happened last year , &quot; Asprilla said in his soft , husky voice on the eve of Parma ' s return to the Cup Winners ' Cup_final , which it lost to Arsenal of England . &quot; The life in Colombia is very different than the life in Europe . Not so fast . ( My adjustment ) has been difficult , because in Italy football is very different . The mind is different here . Here , they are all more involved in the game . All they think is football. &quot; Asprilla began to play soccer at 8 in his hometown , a small farming village near Cali . His professional career began at 15 with Cucuta Deportivo . He also spent three seasons with one of Colombia ' s most powerful teams , Atletico Nacional in Medellin , the team owned by the late drug lord , Pablo Escobar . Italian scouts saw Asprilla play in a youth tournament and were dazzled by his combination of explosive strength and grace . The frequent comparisons to Maradona are a reference_to Asprilla ' s exceptional ball control and his elusive running . The elusive nature of Asprilla as a personality has perplexed his long-suffering coach , Nevio Scala . Parma and Scala were taking_a_chance on Asprilla even with his obvious talent because no Colombian player had lasted more_than a year with an Italian club . &quot; My coach gave me the opportunity to play here , &quot; Asprilla said , smiling . &quot; When I had bad things , he was very patient with me . He always gives me a chance to play. &quot; Asprilla is not specific about what bad things have happened . &quot; Everybody has problems . Whatever problems I have are solved and I can solve them alone , &quot; he said . Asprilla remains unfazed , as ever . His ample enthusiasm is now turned_to the World Cup and Colombia ' s status as sleeping tiger , waiting to pounce on Group_A , which includes the United States , Romania and Switzerland . &quot; This is the best Colombian team ever , &quot; he said . &quot; We hope to play good football . I know we will. &quot; World Cup Player Profile Name : Faustino Hernan Asprilla . Born : Nov . 10 , 1969 , Tulua , Colombia . Height : 5-6 . Weight : 160 . Position : Forward . Club : Parma , Italy .
