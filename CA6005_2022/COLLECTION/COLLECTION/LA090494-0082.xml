   <HEADLINE> WILD RUSSIA FALLS PREY TO CIVILIZATION ; NATURE : ECONOMIC CRUNCH HAS GIVEN PROFIT THE EDGE ON PRESERVATION . BUSINESSES AND LOCAL_GOVERNMENTS ARE TAKING_OVER LAND AND RESOURCES . POACHING HAS INCREASED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pyotr Seryogin blows four blasts on a battered hunting horn , then calls into the thick green forest : &quot; Little ones ! Little ones ! Little ones ! &quot; A family of five huge European bison answers , slowly emerging from the birch_trees and lumbering through chest-high ferns toward the fence where Seryogin , 61 , waits with pails of feed . It looks_like something out of a Russian fairy tale : the forest idyll , the beasts with long , curved horns , and their white-haired keeper . But even in places like this , the protected heart of a nature reserve , the troubles of modern-day Russia are pressing in . The bison , fenced_in because of poaching and development , are suffering for lack of space , workers say . Other animals , allowed to roam outside the reserve , are being wiped_out by poachers . Reserve workers are underpaid and under-equipped . Some have been dismissed ; others take_time_off to tend their own small farms . Russia ' s vast protected lands -- 88 nature reserves , two_dozen national_parks and various other wilderness designations -- include virtually every kind of ecosystem and an abundance of wild species and natural wealth . Like many things now , however , their management runs largely on autopilot while the country absorbs the shocks of the last few years and figures_out who is in_charge of what . Prioksko-Terrasny , a 12 # 350-acre reserve two hours south of Moscow , has been assigned to six different ministries and departments in as_many years . Its exasperated director , Yevgraf Litkens , has resorted_to using a letterhead with just his name . &quot; We couldn ' t change stationery fast enough , &quot; Litkens said . Natalia Danilina , director of the Nature Reserves Department , says the reserves are in no danger of being dissolved , but that the government is still learning how to respond to a variety of new threats . From one angle , Russia ' s industrial decline could be seen as an environmental boon , causing some polluting factories to close and sidetracking large development projects . But from another , the economic crunch has given profit -- or simple survival -- the edge on preservation . Businesses and local_governments are taking_over land and resources . Poaching has increased . &quot; Local nature-protection organs are not always strong enough to oppose authorities interested in fast profits , &quot; said Vasily Khramtsev , director of the Lazovsky Reserve in the Far East , where trees have been felled in the habitat for endangered Siberian tigers . At a marine reserve near Vladivostok , an inspector said people were &quot; literally emptying coastal waters &quot; of salmon to sell the caviar . Russia ' s new rich are grabbing up protected woodland along roads and rivers for country_houses . &quot; Many people are under the illusion that we have such vast resources and such a tremendous country that it ' s inexhaustible , &quot; Litkens said . Under communism , the rules were clear . Across the Soviet_Union , local party_bosses used reserves and parks for their own private recreation , in the process protecting them from damage by others . Now the system of party patronage is gone , and the new government has much less clout . Aside from some flagrant violations -- a pulp mill on the shores of Lake Baikal , for example -- environmentalists say the Soviets generally took their parks and reserves seriously . Reserves were off-limits to the public . &quot; It ' s a paradox : They made a mess , but they also protected a lot of territory , &quot; said David Gordon of the Pacific Environment and Resources Center in Sausalito , Calif. , which works_on Russian forest preservation . The Soviet system also controlled the land around wilderness areas , which now feel the loss of those buffers . In other former Soviet republics , the challenges may be even greater because wilderness managers have lost the Kremlin ' s financial_support and the influence they had as part of a large parks system . In recent months , Russia has tried some Western-style solutions . One of the new Moscow banks finances programs to save endangered cranes and tigers , advertising its support for wildlife on television and billboards . Environmental groups such_as Greenpeace are taking polluters and developers to court , although with little success so far . Federal_officials say the most effective way to deal with violators is still the old-fashioned way : winning_over prosecutors and local administrators who can apply pressure . Some communities and local_governments are trying to attract big-spending tourists , hunters and fishermen . Alexander Lisitsin , who guides groups of foreign hunters for a Moscow company_named Greenfield , says money from hunting_licenses can protect bear populations that are being devastated by poaching , and habitat now being cleared by loggers . &quot; There ' s no money anymore to pay the bureaucrats , so who ' s left to protect wildlife ? &quot; he said . &quot; Everything ' s commercial now. &quot; Even officials of some closed reserves talk_of opening areas to the paying public . &quot; Many see it as a necessary evil , &quot; Gordon said . &quot; Others are very upset by it. &quot; Park rangers earn the equivalent of only $ 25 to $ 30 a month , which could make them susceptible to bribes . At Prioksko-Terrasny , director Litkens tries to supplement employees ' incomes with livestock and supplies . Seryogin , in his 15th year at the bison-breeding center , says survival is getting harder for both staff and animals . &quot; There used to be lots of deer and wild_boars , &quot; he said , but &quot; this winter , there were no boars and only a_few dozen deer. &quot; He blames poaching and road traffic outside the reserve , pollution from local factories , even the 1986 nuclear_explosion at Chernobyl , in Ukraine . &quot; There ' s something wrong with the climate , &quot; Seryogin said . &quot; I don ' t know . There are hardly any birds anymore. &quot;</TEXT>
