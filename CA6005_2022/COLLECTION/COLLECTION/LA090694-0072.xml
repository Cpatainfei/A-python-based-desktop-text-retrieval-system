   <HEADLINE> DISEASE ON CRUISE_SHIP IDENTIFIED ; HEALTH : 600 PASSENGERS AND CREW OF VIKING SERENADE WERE STRICKEN WITH SHIGELLOSIS , A VIRULENT INTESTINAL AILMENT . THE SOURCE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 600 passengers and crew_members who fell ill aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise_ship last week were stricken by shigellosis , a virulent intestinal disease , investigators from the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention said Monday . The source of the shigella bacteria aboard the San Pedro-based Viking Serenade had not yet been determined , and CDC investigators were sampling the ship ' s food and water and testing its food preparers for signs of infection . The cruise liner returned to port from Ensenada , Mexico , on Thursday , a day early from what was supposed to be a four-night journey , after large_numbers of passengers fell ill with severe bouts of vomiting , fever and diarrhea . Of the passengers aboard , 583 , or 37 % of the total , reported signs of the illness , while 40 crew_members out of 612 were also stricken , according to the CDC . The bacteria was found in half the stool samples taken from the passengers . &quot; It is a nasty bug . Any disease that causes fever , diarrhea , cramps and vomiting is extremely uncomfortable , and particularly the very old and the very young are especially impacted , &quot; said CDC spokesman Bob Howard in Atlanta . &quot; For 37 % of a group to be made ill , we certainly have to classify this as a large outbreak. &quot; Six people aboard the ship were hospitalized , including one 78-year-old man , Clarence Bazar of Long_Beach , who died -- apparently of a heart_attack -- after he fell ill with the intestinal symptoms and was hospitalized in Ensenada . Bazar was seriously ill before the cruise with heart_disease , diabetes and cancer . Howard said investigators have not yet determined whether the disease contributed to Bazar ' s death . Shigellosis spreads through contact with feces , usually via food or person to person , although it can also be transmitted through the water_supply . Just a small number of the organisms -- 10 to 200 -- are enough to make a person violently ill , and Howard said one infected food handler could spread the bug to hundreds of people aboard the ship without even knowing he or she had the disease . At the request of the CDC , the cruise line is testing all food handlers , surveying the water_system and removing all prepared food from the ship . CDC investigators said Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines , which is sanitizing and inspecting the vessel , is acting &quot; expeditiously. &quot; The cruise_ship , according to Howard , received &quot; an excellent score &quot; in a sanitary inspection conducted by the CDC earlier this year . &quot; You can have a vessel that is absolutely spotless and all it takes is one infected food source or one infected handler who may or may_not know he or she is infected , &quot; Howard said . &quot; A lot of it has to do with a large_number of people in a confined area . The bottom_line is we simply don ' t know the mode of transmission in this case . We continue to do testing on water , stool samples and blood samples. &quot; Royal Caribbean ' s chairman , Richard Fain , said the company is cooperating with the CDC to ensure that the bacteria is eradicated before the ship ' s next scheduled voyage Friday . The Viking Serenade left San Pedro on Aug . 29 , and the first reports of illness occurred the next day , while it was docked off Santa Catalina Island . The number of ill grew steadily as the ship cruised toward Baja California . With an incubation_period of 12 hours to five days , shigellosis typically begins with fever , stomach pain and diarrhea , which often turns bloody after a day or so , and can last a week . The type of shigella found in the passengers -- Shigella flexneri -- can be successfully treated with antibiotics . It is spread through physical contact or in food by an infected person who fails to wash his or her hands . Some people can be infected with the bacteria and pass it on to others without experiencing any symptoms ; the infection can even be transmitted to others up_to four weeks after the illness ends . In some cases , such_as with a recent waterborne illness in Milwaukee , bacteria can cause outbreaks of intestinal disease that afflict hundreds of thousands of people . Shigellosis strikes about 15 # 000 people a year , Howard said . The Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines promised full refunds to the passengers . Fares for the excursion ranged from $ 599 to $ 1 # 899 a person including air fare .</TEXT>
