   <HEADLINE> THE FALL COLLECTIONS / NEW YORK ; ITSY-BITSY CHIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a three-week hiatus , time enough to repack the slip dresses and combat_boots that are the uniform of fashion hounds , the shows of fall ready-to-wear resumed Wednesday under two tents pitched behind the New York Public_Library . The eight-day schedule could choke even the most voracious clotheshorse : 76 back-to-back shows , a cocktail reception by the Council of Fashion_Designers of America , panel_discussions sponsored by Mirabella and Harper ' s Bazaar , a Diamond Information Center breakfast and a slew of private parties , including a dinner hosted by Calvin Klein and a model-celebrity bash given by the_British firm Ghost . But even such inducements as free bottles of Evian , stacks of fashion magazines , a Prescriptives make-over and a Pantone color consultation won ' t stifle the weariness sure to set_in by week ' s end . The fashion troops seem a tad grumpy already . Maybe it ' s the combination of chilly , rainy weather and a spate of opening shows that were repetitious , uninspired and at times downright silly . The runways were swimming in itsy-bitsy dresses and skirts that barely covered the crotch . Pants made only rare appearances , and forget about jackets . They ' ve been replaced by loose , droopy sweaters , either ribbed or in nubby wool . Although it ' s laudable that designers have labored to find a fresher , softer alternative to the conventional structured suit , it ' s doubtful women will swoon over fuzzy sweaters and teeny knit dresses paired with over-the-knee stockings and chunky boots . It ' s a look better suited to Kate Moss than to the rest of us . No one tried harder to make a statement for little flared dresses than Donna Karan in her hipper-than-thou DKNY collection , whose target audience seems to be blank-faced twentysomethings with disheveled hair and daddy ' s charge_card . If you had to choose a single item to sum_up the DKNY attitude , it would be a baggy , bunched-up oatmeal tweed sweater drooping over a tiny flippy skirt revealing pipe-cleaner legs in suede desert_boots . Or maybe a tartan mini fluffed out with a crinoline and paired with a riding jacket and a pristine , schoolgirlish white blouse . * Karan doesn ' t miss a trend : &quot; deconstructionist &quot; chinos with raw-edge hems , distressed shearling coats , leather aprons , shrunken sweaters , kilts , and the ubiquitous over-the-knee stockings , among others . And she is probably the first designer to show bouffant dance dresses and ball_gowns in hot-pink and acid-green neoprene . The fluorescent scuba styles bobbing down the runway drew applause , probably from editors eager to do photo layouts titled : &quot; Neoprene Dives Into Style ! &quot; Buyers may have a tougher time envisioning customers plucking them off the racks . But you never know . Adrienne Vittadini was also crazy about tiny pleated tartan skirts and little knit dresses , but she presented her collection with less attitude . Although her restraint was admirable -- Karan ' s street chic can be contrived -- the clothes seemed bland . Why didn ' t Vittadini , who is masterful with prints , liven things up with her signature patterned knits ? Except for a group of shrunken sweater sets_in neon-bright mohair , the designer stuck_to dark and sober shades , such_as navy , plum and gray . Her nubby , flared sweater-dresses grazed the derriere and were worn with ribbed tights and riding boots . For more coverage , they could probably be tossed over pants , which were scarce here . Her oversize knit tunics had knit scarves coiled at the neck to form deep , cowl-like collars . Not exactly an earth-shattering idea , but one that looked great . On a different wavelength entirely was Randy Kemper , whose fans include Margaux Hemingway and Hillary Rodham Clinton . Forget shrunken mohair sweater sets and itty-bitty kilts . Kemper is into commercial wearability -- cuffed trousers , crepe trousers , strong-shouldered jackets -- stuff to wear in the boardroom . Next to the babyish clothing in other lines , these day clothes looked surprisingly staid . The best items in Kemper ' s show were his big , plush , fake-fur coats ; floaty silk trench_coats lined in a leopard print , and a streamlined sage wool jumpsuit gleaming with little zippers . Old-time film goddesses were the inspiration for Kemper ' s vampy evening_clothes , from satin lounging pajamas to bias-cut slip dresses that should never leave the boudoir . Mark Eisen ' s show started off on a promising note with skinny black pantsuits , a camel duffel coat , and vests and minis in black and camel tartan . After that , things turned . A tight mohair suit in screaming tangerine , shiny black vinyl jeans worn with four-inch spikes , and micro minis trimmed with stiff , brushlike feathers had more_than a_few viewers staring blankly into space . If only the talented Eisen would get_rid_of the gimmicks . * If there was one streak of light in the early round of shows , it was Byron Lars ' zippy collection that tossed together the fashion passions -- fake fur , riding jackets and sweater-dresses -- with bits of colorful beads and feathers and vibrant African prints . Everything was done_in a lighthearted , don ' t-take-fashion-so-seriously spirit , and the show worked because firmly tailored , well-cut sportswear was the foundation of all_the fun . Narrow , pin-striped charcoal suits ; slouchy charcoal wool trousers ; men ' s shirts , and leather aviator jackets were enlivened with collars of colorful beads , coiled and feathered headdresses , African mask backpacks and shawls lined in vivid African prints . Even the models seemed to enjoy tossing their acrylic cornrows and swirling their printed shawls as they strutted to pulsating music . Let ' s hope some of the other designers pick_up Lars ' beat .
