   <HEADLINE> ATTORNEYS SAY TEENS WERE PAWNS IN SCHEME TO KILL TAY ; COURTS : ROLES OF ABRAHAM ACOSTA AND KIRN KIM ARE DOWNPLAYED , BUT PROSECUTOR COUNTERS THEY WERE WELL AWARE OF THE PLOT . JURY IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN DELIBERATIONS TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One teen-ager who acted_as a lookout and another who landed the first blow should be spared murder_convictions in the 1992 New Year ' s Eve slaying of honor student Stuart A . Tay , their attorneys said Tuesday . Abraham Acosta , 17 , of Buena Park and Kirn Kim , 18 , of Fullerton were unwitting pawns caught_up in a murder scheme hatched by another teen-ager , who has since been convicted of orchestrating Tay ' s death , defense_attorneys told the Orange County Superior_Court jury during closing arguments Tuesday . Defense_attorneys downplayed their clients ' roles in the murder by shifting the blame to Robert Chan , 19 , of Fullerton , a onetime high_school valedictorian who was convicted in May of organizing the murder . Deputy Public_Defender Denise Gragg told jurors that Acosta is a mentally disabled youth who was &quot; easily led &quot; into participating in what he believed was a prank to scare Tay but never believed a murder would take_place . &quot; Robert Chan used Abraham Acosta , &quot; Gragg told jurors . &quot; Who better to use than someone far below you in maturity and intelligence ? &quot; Gragg said jurors , who are expected to begin deliberating today , should convict Acosta of assault with a deadly weapon . Defense_attorney Allan H . Stokke asked jurors to find his client guilty only of being an accessory to murder after the killing had occurred . Stokke said Kim considered Chan a &quot; big talker &quot; who bragged about involvement in crimes but never actually committed them . Kim also dismissed Chan ' s talk_about killing Tay as bragging , and had no idea Tay was being beaten to death while Kim waited outside Acosta ' s home , Stokke said . &quot; It ' s unfair , it ' s not reasonable and it ' s not just &quot; to convict Kim of murder , Stokke said , adding that a murder_conviction would be like &quot; killing &quot; the defendant . &quot; Don ' t make Kirn Kim into another victim . . . . We ' ve got enough victims of Robert Chan ' s twisted mind. &quot; But Deputy Dist . Atty . Lewis R . Rosenblum blasted attempts to portray Kim and Acosta as victims , saying they were_well aware of and played key roles in a sophisticated murder scheme . Acosta helped dig a grave in his back yard the day before the slaying and participated in a rehearsal of the slaying , Rosenblum said . Kim acted_as a lookout and dumped Tay ' s sports_car in Compton to make_it appear Tay had been the victim of a carjacking , Rosenblum said . If Acosta and Kim truly did not know a murder was underway , Rosenblum told jurors , they had an obligation to call police or halt the scheme . Instead , Acosta was paid $ 100 and Kim received $ 20 -- money Chan took from Tay ' s wallet , Rosenblum told jurors . &quot; There comes a point_in_time where people must be held accountable for the choices they make , &quot; Rosenblum said . Chan faces life in prison without parole when he is sentenced this summer . Mun Bong Kang , 19 , also of Fullerton , pleaded guilty in May and faces the same sentence for his role in the slaying . The four teens have been prosecuted as adults . A fifth defendant , Charles Choe , 18 , of Fullerton , was prosecuted as a juvenile after he agreed to testify against his former co-defendants . The defendants attended Sunny Hills High_School in Fullerton . Tay attended Foothill High_School in Santa Ana . Chan and Tay became friends while planning to rob an Anaheim computer-parts dealer . Chan later turned_on the victim when he feared Tay was a police informant . Tay was beaten unconscious with baseball_bats before he was forced to drink rubbing alcohol and had his nose and mouth taped shut . He was buried in a shallow grave in Acosta ' s back yard .</TEXT>
