   <HEADLINE> IN STATISTICAL FLUKE , O.C. JOBLESS RATE TOOK BIG DROP IN NOVEMBER ; UNEMPLOYMENT : DESPITE 1 % DECLINE IN OFFICIAL ESTIMATE , THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COUNTY JOBS IS FEWER THAN IN NOVEMBER , 1992 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s jobless rate for November dropped to 5.6 % from October ' s 6.6 % as 11 # 000 people were erased from the official estimate of the local labor_force in what a state analyst called a statistical glitch . The big drop is a result of the averaging method used to compute local unemployment each month and was repeated in nearly every county in California . &quot; It ' s a one-month anomaly , &quot; said Eleanor Jordan , Orange County labor_market analyst for the state Employment Development Department . &quot; We always caution people not to rely_on a single month ' s figures to predict a trend. &quot; Still , economists generally expect Orange County ' s employment situation to improve . The lower November jobless rate &quot; gives a greater level of confidence to our forecasts , &quot; said Anil Puri , head of the economics_department at Cal State Fullerton . In a separate report issued Friday , EDD analyst Jordan said that businesses in Orange County added 800 jobs during November . That report counts positions with businesses in the county , while the unemployment_rate estimates the number of county residents who have jobs , regardless of where they work . While the November job increase computed by Jordan certainly is welcome in a recession-ravaged county , the total of 1.1 million full- and part-time jobs still was 16 # 900 fewer than in November , 1992 , when the county ' s unemployment_rate stood at 7.0 % . All of the gains for the latest month came_in government and in retail trade , which typically swells in November because of the annual pre-holiday hiring spurt . The increase of 3 # 300 retailing jobs and 1 # 700 government positions , however , was nearly offset by the losses of 1 # 800 jobs in_service industries , 1 # 100 in construction , 800 in manufacturing and 500 in finance , insurance and real_estate . Except for Los Angeles County , where the jobless rate for November was barely changed at 9.4 % , other Southern California counties fared as well as or better than Orange County in the month ' s number-crunching . The unemployment_rate in San Diego County fell to 7.2 % from 8.5 % for October ; Riverside ' s double-digit jobless rate plunged nearly two full_points to 11.8 % from October ' s 13.6 % ; and San Bernardino County ' s rate was lopped to 9.2 % from 10.7 % for October . The statewide jobless rate for November -- released earlier in December -- was 8.6 % , down from 9.4 % for October . Lower Jobless Rate Because of a statistical glitch , Orange County ' s unemployment_rate for November fell to 5.6 % from October ' s 6.6 % , a decline that was repeated in nearly every county across California . O.C. ' s job picture : Unemployment_rate : 5 / 6 -- Jobs : 1 # 108 , 400 Source : State Employment Development Dept .</TEXT>
