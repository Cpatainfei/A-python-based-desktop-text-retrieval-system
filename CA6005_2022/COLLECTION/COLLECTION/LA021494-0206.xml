   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : WHAT MAKES A FILM ' FOREIGN ' ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As expected , &quot; The Piano , &quot; a film from New Zealand , has been nominated for an Oscar as best picture while &quot; Farewell My Concubine , &quot; a film from Hong Kong and co-winner with &quot; The Piano &quot; at the Cannes Film Festival , is relegated to a nomination from the Academy of Motion_Pictures Arts and Sciences as best foreign language film . Although the distinction is ostensibly based on language , there is something very insidious about categorizing movies in this manner . Generally , as long as a film contains English dialogue , the film is no longer considered &quot; foreign &quot; and it can rank right up there with Hollywood ' s best work . Doesn ' t this suggest that &quot; The Piano &quot; is not a foreign film but &quot; Concubine &quot; is ? But wait ! In an added irony , the Academy chose to nominate &quot; The Wedding Banquet &quot; for best foreign language film . Didn ' t this film use mostly English dialogue ? Never mind that &quot; Banquet ' s &quot; main characters are American ( OK , so the protagonist is a naturalized American and the female lead an &quot; illegal &quot; immigrant ) . The story takes_place in New York , and the protagonist ' s lover is a white American male . ( I guess it could be argued that &quot; Banquet &quot; was made with Taiwanese money . But wasn ' t &quot; The Piano &quot; financed with French_francs ? ) I must conclude that in Hollywood anything Anglo is considered non- &quot; foreign &quot; while anything non-Anglo is &quot; foreign. &quot; I am disappointed -- though not surprised -- that the Academy did not see fit to nominate Gong Li ( from &quot; Concubine &quot; ) for best supporting actress . The New York Film Critics were alone among various film awards groups in picking her as best supporting actress . No Asian actor in a &quot; foreign language &quot; picture has ever been nominated for an acting award by the Academy . European ( read Anglo ) actors have fared better ( Sophia Loren won an Oscar ; Marcello Mastrioanni , Isabelle Adjani , Catherine Deneuve , Gerard Depardieu have been nominated ) . Will Hollywood one day extend its vision to include non-Anglo actors ? I know I run the risk of being criticized for political correctness . All I know is any segregation on racial lines is divisive and artificial . &quot; Foreign &quot; is such an ugly word anyway . The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. , which also nominated &quot; The Wedding Banquet &quot; in its best foreign language film category , would be wise_to change its name to the Hollywood International Press -- would n ' t that make_it HIP ? And all our award givers should include meritorious works without artificially segregating films on the basis of what is and what isn ' t foreign . But if we must make the distinction , take a hint from the Independent Spirit Awards . This group did not use language as its criterion and instead nominated &quot; The Wedding Banquet &quot; for best feature , and named &quot; The Piano &quot; ( New Zealand ) , &quot; Orlando &quot; ( Britain ) and &quot; Naked &quot; ( Britain ) as foreign film nominees .</TEXT>
