   <HEADLINE> TO SEEM IS NOT TO BE ; AND OTHER RULES OF LIFE , LOVE AND AUTISM DONNA WILLIAMS TAUGHT ME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three years ago , shortly after publishing &quot; Nobody Nowhere , The Extraordinary Autobiography of an Autistic , &quot; Donna Williams met me in the lobby of Manhattan ' s Mayflower Hotel . That is , Donna avoided me . After emerging from the elevator , she immediately shielded her face behind a sheaf of papers -- her written answers to the questions I had submitted -- and quickly bolted_out the door . Wispy blond curls around a prettily freckled face gave her a waif-like appearance , camouflaging the iron will that led her to liberty after more_than 20 years in what she calls the prison and sanctuary of autism . Avoiding any brush with passersby , she fled down the street and headed into Central_Park as I trotted breathlessly behind . Donna didn ' t have much use for people then . Even less for journalists . I spent my first two hours with Donna trying to conduct an interview as she walked briskly through Central_Park . Pacing reduced the terror of speaking_to strangers , and provided a rhythmic_pattern for conversation . She didn ' t lower her defenses until she could be sure I had mastered the rules : No touching , no inflections , no fluttery gestures , no tape_recorders , no changes in plan . Especially , no eye_contact . Interviews had to be conducted outside . Sentences had to be simple -- subject , verb , object -- until she got used to strange voices . Questions had to be drawn_in pictures if words didn ' t work . Goodbys had to be speedy , without any emotion . These were the strict terms of Being with Donna . Symptoms vary among individual autistic people -- about 1 % of the U.S. population -- and have been blamed on everything from demonic possession to bad parenting to sleep deprivation . Today , autism is known to be a neurological_disorder in which sensory information floods the brain . It is , as Donna experiences it , &quot; like having a brain without a sieve. &quot; When people speak_to her , especially excited people with booming voices , she sees only waving hands and hears only &quot; blah , blah , blah. &quot; Overstimulation can trigger a &quot; shutdown &quot; -- the catatonic stare and frozen body that Donna has said is like being &quot; involuntarily anesthetized. &quot; With obsessive concentration , another symptom of autism , she managed to write her first astonishing autobiography in four manic weeks . She had plopped the 500-page manuscript on the desk of a child psychiatrist at the London clinic where she was a temporary clerk , asking him &quot; to read it and tell me what kind of mad I was. &quot; At age 25 , she finally learned that the massive confusion and mighty frustration she had been wiring around all her life had a name : autism . Despite severe sensory and neurological impairment , she is a high-functioning autistic individual with exceptional talents ( &quot; idiot savant &quot; in psychological lore ) . The doctor passed the manuscript to a literary_agent in London ; it became a bestseller in the United States and abroad . Donna has now completed another memoir describing the obstacles she overcame to move from &quot; Donna ' s world &quot; to &quot; the world. &quot; The New York Times described Donna as &quot; prodigiously talented . . . . And oh , can she write . The windows through which she allows us to view her experience are metaphor , perfectly rendered details and wonderful surprising phrasing. &quot; &quot; Somebody Somewhere &quot; is an almost incomprehensible achievement for someone who never thought_of words as her first_language . Throughout childhood , Donna communicated mainly through gestures and objects . Objects had life : &quot; My bed was my friend ; my coat protected me and kept me inside ; things that made_noise had their own unique voices which said vroom , ping , or whatever . I told my shoes where they were going so they would take me there , &quot; she wrote . Since words were meaningless strings of sound , she was never moved to ask the ubiquitous childhood question : But why , Mom ? Why do I have to look both ways / turn_off the TV / kiss grandma goodby ? Instead of learning how and why people did what they did , she learned to copy conversation and behavior , exhibiting the echolalic and echopractic habits of autistic children . During her childhood in Australia , she memorized episodes of &quot; The Brady Bunch. &quot; Whenever a situation triggered this stored dialogue , she would become Marcia or Greg or Alice . She responded to questions at school or home with the answers she thought people expected : &quot; I said a lot of yes , yes , yeses . Cups_of_tea arrived without any connections between their arrival and the yes that had brought them there. &quot; &quot; Life was just a great long game of strategies and battle tactics to hide the flaws , holes and deficits , &quot; she wrote . Information did not translate from one situation to the next . &quot; If I learned something while I was standing with a woman in a kitchen and it was summer and it was daytime , the lesson would n ' t be triggered if I was standing with a man in another room and it was winter and it was nighttime , &quot; she explained . Her alcoholic mother interpreted Donna ' s strange behavior as a sign that she was possessed by evil_spirits . Aside from a weekly paycheck , her father largely absented himself from his troubled family . At age 16 , Donna left home . She supported herself with routine factory jobs , but the next 10 years were a constant struggle , including episodes of homelessness and unemployment . Eventually she moved to London , where her exceptional ability to store facts helped her pass the entrance exam for college . ( Donna has scored both genius and retarded on IQ tests. ) Haunted by the constant threat of institutionalization , she hid her difficulties from most of her teachers and fellow students . After watching Donna for a_few months , however , an observant classmate tried to confirm her hunch : &quot; Donna , you ' re different , aren ' t you ? &quot; she asked . &quot; I guess so , &quot; Donna said . &quot; Just how different are you ? &quot; she pressed . &quot; Put it this way , &quot; Donna replied . &quot; I ' m a culture looking_for a place to happen. &quot; Passing a London consignment shop on her way home from work one day , Donna saw a used typewriter and decided on impulse to buy_it . She put_in a sheet_of_paper and , four sleepless weeks later , had the book that &quot; both saved me and destroyed me. &quot; Dr. Lawrence Bartak , an Australian specialist in autism , offered to help Donna begin building bridges instead of walls between worlds . &quot; I think I can now accept that I am disabled , with a very big abled and still quite a dis , &quot; she says . While Donna had much to gain by joining &quot; the world , &quot; there were excruciating losses as well -- she learned that without a nervous_system , inanimate objects could not think or feel . Her treasured objects lost their life with this concept . &quot; I realized I ' d lived_in a world of object corpses . God has a curious sense_of_humor , &quot; she wrote . She braved the initial loneliness and shock because &quot; I was in_love with my own aliveness and completeness. &quot; The alternative was not to give_a_damn . &quot; I gave_a_damn bigly. &quot; I HAD NOT IMAGINED THREE YEARS AGO that this woman from another world would move me so deeply , introducing me to another way of seeing , another way of knowing . Donna and I stayed in touch after our first memorable meeting , by fax and phone and once , when she returned a year later , through a long weekend visit at my home_in Connecticut . Conversations with her are often a humbling experience -- though that is never her intention . &quot; What have you been doing all summer ? &quot; I ' d ask . Well , she ' d learned French and German , written another book , composed a musical_score for a movie , finished several paintings and was preparing an instruction_manual for teachers of autistic children . &quot; What have you been doing ? &quot; she ' d ask . Well , I was almost finished with the essay I started three months ago . One of us was once thought to be retarded and one of us was not -- and all_of us , it seems , should rethink the usefulness of labels . Ours was not to be a conventional friendship . Donna is a wholly mature intelligence with a highly original take_on life , questioning the meaning of everything and forcing me to do the same . Last year , as we were walking through my neighborhood , Donna looked_up at the sky , stopped abruptly and sang a tune I had never heard before . Did she write that song ? I asked . No , she replied , the birds wrote it . She pointed to the telephone_lines where dozens of blackbirds were perched . At least I saw birds . Donna saw a musical_phrase . The universe is_full of unsung music most of us never hear . A lot has changed in the past three years . She has gained greater insight into the ways of Red People ( the &quot; so-called normal people &quot; who are like noisy , vibrating colors to her ) and though one is never cured of autism , Donna now grasps more meaning from speech . &quot; You don ' t have to speak so slowly now , &quot; she told me recently . She ' s also found a way to reduce the distracting visual overload . Donna ' s earliest companions were bright spots of translucent color dancing before her eyes -- a mesmerizing light show no one else seemed to notice . Much later , she learned that she wasn ' t hallucinating -- the spots were real : Because of her acute vision , she can see air particles of reflected light that are invisible to Red People . Now , she has more visual mastery with a pair of special glasses that &quot; provide context , &quot; minimizing the distracting details that could lock her attention for hours . She has also ceased the tapping , pounding , beating behavior commonly observed in those with autism , &quot; the outward sign of the earthquake nobody saw , &quot; Donna wrote . When her senses overloaded as a child , she would bite her flesh like an animal bites the bars of its cage , not realizing the cage was her own body . &quot; My legs took my body around in manic circles as though they could somehow outrun the body they were attached_to . My head hit whatever was next to it , like someone trying to crack open a nut that had grown too big for its shell. &quot; Before she learned new strategies , the rhythmic tapping , pounding and slapping also helped her keep track of where the edges of her body left_off and the Big Black Nothingness began . In &quot; Somebody Somewhere , &quot; she describes the two painful extremes of autism , both of which obliterate any concept of self : &quot; Autism makes me feel everything at once without knowing what I am feeling or it cuts me off from feeling anything at all. &quot; Though human touch and emotions present the risk of shutdown , Donna discovered she could brave these hurdles between autism and intimacy with Paul , her new husband . She met Paul , a musician , in a London music store . After noting his shy mannerisms and abrupt conversation , she correctly concluded that &quot; he is like me. &quot; She wrote her phone_number on a piece_of_paper and gave it to him . Four weeks later , he rallied the courage to call . For an autistic couple , the recognition of love is not a wholly pleasant sensation . As her emotions approached &quot; five on a scale of one to five , &quot; Donna battled to keep the self she had worked so hard to uncover from submerging again . &quot; Something awful is happening , &quot; she told Paul . &quot; I have a feeling I don ' t understand. &quot; &quot; Is it something you ate ? Are you upset ? Do you need to eat ? &quot; Paul asked . She finally worked her feelings out on paper and wrote him a letter : &quot; The safer and happier I feel , the more it will make me want to run and escape . Do you realize this ? Do you care enough , have patience enough and understanding enough , to support my fight against this stupid compulsion ? If you do not , it is OK . But it would just be too hard if you didn ' t understand. &quot; He did understand . Together , they developed systems to keep the &quot; self &quot; from disappearing during frightening emotions -- Donna into her characters , Paul into his &quot; faces , &quot; both manifestations of memorized behavior that they had used previously to cope_with everyday life . They established what Donna calls their &quot; ongoing specialship , a place of belonging. &quot; They had to talk a lot about sexual_desire -- or the lack of it . They could both remember sexual experiences in their past when there was no &quot; self &quot; involved . An adult going_through the motions of sex without a self , Donna said , feels much the same as a child who is &quot; molested , abused and confused. &quot; The worst part , they agreed , was having to pretend to feelings they didn ' t have because that ' s what the Red People expected . &quot; We were a pair of comrades discussing a decade each of self-rape , &quot; Donna says , &quot; a pair of prostitutes talking trade. &quot; The desire to touch came slowly , with respect for their acute sensitivities . Conducting their courtship was tricky -- the usual gift exchanges held no appeal for Donna , who rarely wants to own anything . The things she most enjoys are clouds , sunshine , trees , plants , flowers , wind and waves , a fire in a fireplace . How to wrap_up the ocean ? Paul once adopted the persona of man-romancing-woman and tried to buy a crystal Donna had admired in a gift_shop . She told him to put it back -- she didn ' t want it . &quot; There was too_much ' I want to please you ' in the air , &quot; she wrote , &quot; too_much ' let me escape me by focusing totally on you. ' I could accept nothing in this atmosphere. &quot; Such blunt honesty is crucial to their relationship . Maintaining the self -- not characters , not facades , not routinized behaviors or patterns -- was perhaps the first and most critical rule of specialship . I FELT MY ANXIETY RISING AS I DROVE INTO MANHATTAN TO MEET Donna and her husband for the first time . Traffic was moving at a crawl after a blizzard had dumped a foot of snow on the streets . I was already an hour late that February morning when I parked outside the Lyden Gardens , hoping their rule against changes in plan was flexible during natural disasters . Donna had always stayed_at the Mayflower because familiarity was necessary to a sense of security . Whenever she enters a new room , she feels secure only after memorizing every detail : the windows , the blinds , the wallpaper pattern , the color of the furniture , the marks on the floor and , of course , the position of the door . Change frustrates autistic people because this memorizing is hard work . If one item is moved , the whole room has to be memorized again . When Donna returned to the Mayflower last year and asked_for the same room , she instead was given an identical room with exactly the same furniture , colors , paintings , floor_plan . But it might as well have been a tent in Central_Park . What was so different , the concierge wanted to know ? The view from the window . But this time , they had switched hotels so as_to have a suite with a kitchen . Because of their multiple food allergies -- to milk , cheese , wheat , onions , among many others -- Paul preferred to cook their meals rather than risk eating unidentified ingredients in restaurants . &quot; Our suite looks_like a biscuit , &quot; Donna had said over the phone , meaning that it was beige . &quot; It gives me a floaty feeling. &quot; Strongly affected by color and light , she was unmoored by beige . Donna opens the door when I ring the bell , then steps immediately back into the foyer . She hums softly , makes a chuckling sound , then hums again . I recognize this pattern as her way of reducing terror . Though we have spoken freely on the phone , the initial moments of being together again are still frightening . &quot; Hello-Donna , &quot; I say evenly , looking over the shoulder of her yellow sweater . She puts her fingers on her lips , as if deciding whether to bite her nails or invite me in . I stand_still as she hums , chuckles , hums , letting her take me in peripherally through her dark , tinted glasses . Finally , she speaks . &quot; Please take_off your hat , &quot; she asks_in her flattest , most mechanical tone , like a voice in a car telling me to put_on my seat_belt . I realize she can ' t see me yet . Even with the special glasses that provide context , I am The Friend Donna Mistook for a Hat . I remove the obstacle and she smiles in recognition . She introduces Paul , a slim , tall man standing very still in the foyer . He looks past me and says hello , then disappears . Behind his colored glasses , the lower half of his handsome face appears stoic and solemn . Paul seems ill_at_ease , which I attribute to the presence of a stranger , my being late and their jet_lag after a harrowing trip from London to New York . The blizzard had delayed their flight , the airports at both locations had been filled with frenzied crowds and they were living_in a biscuit that made them feel floaty . When Donna sits on the carpeted floor and immediately begins talking to me , I sit_down on the floor , too . Our plan for the morning had been to take_care of business first -- she had called the night before , greatly upset , because her printer wasn ' t working . Since Donna did her thinking on paper first , the broken printer rendered her mute , as it were , just as she was headed into a full week of media interviews . I had offered to take them to a computer_store first , then visit for a while , then take a walk through Central_Park together , blizzard or no . Paul had picked_up his coat as soon as I arrived , preparing to go_out , then had put it down again when Donna and I sat_down and began talking . He keeps walking in and out of the room . Half an hour later , his level of anxiety seems to escalate . &quot; Are you doing an interview ? &quot; he asks . &quot; Not really an interview , &quot; I explain . &quot; We ' re just visiting. &quot; He gives no sign that he appreciates the difference , but my remark triggers a question about whether we want a cup_of_tea . Paul is the member of their team in_charge of food and refreshments . We both say yes . While Paul makes two cups of chamomile tea , a loud knock_on the door abruptly halts all conversation . Donna , startled by the sudden sound , stares at the door as a key slips into the lock . The hotel maid materializes in the doorway . &quot; Stop ! &quot; Donna calls . &quot; Don ' t come_in ! &quot; Paul hollers from the kitchen . A clamor of raised voices -- from Donna and Paul , from me , from the maid -- fuse in mutual alarm . &quot; We told them at the desk . . . do not disturb . . . I ' m sorry . . . thought you were out. &quot; The maid quickly disappears but all equanimity is destroyed in an instant , as if a tear-gas bomb had dropped into the room . Paul delivers two cups_of_tea , then sits_down on the couch away from Donna and me . Then he gets_up . Then he sits_down . He becomes absorbed in making a list of some sort . His jaw is set_in grim endurance , as if he is lifting weights . Donna sees his distress , recognizes a case of the &quot; jubblies &quot; coming_on -- &quot; the yukky , gripping things inside your stomach under stress. &quot; &quot; Paul , what ' s wrong ? &quot; she asks . No response . Paul looks straight ahead , his face frozen . Emotional overload . Her words aren ' t getting_in , so Donna steps over to the couch and gently bows , putting the crown of her head in Paul ' s face . Humming softly , she holds perfectly still for a_few minutes , letting him smell and feel her hair . Then she reverses position , burying her face in his hair . This must be what they call a &quot; jubblie-ectomy -- a ritual to get_rid_of the jubblies. &quot; Paul ' s jaw finally unlocks . Words now flood_out . He reminds Donna of the plan -- and how anxious she had been all morning about the broken printer . Having absorbed her anxiety , he was prepared to take action as soon as I arrived . Now here we were , sitting on the floor , acting like two talking heads . All order and structure had disintegrated . Donna apologizes for abandoning the agenda . My appearance had started a chain_reaction of triggered behaviors -- the compulsive speaking , the rote social questions , the automatic &quot; yeses &quot; that once more brought cups_of_tea seemingly out of nowhere . In record time , we don our coats , get_in the car , complete our chore . After a brief autistic tour of the city -- noticing the honking horns and the loud behavior of the Red People , seeing how the air conditioners just outside of apartments form a pattern like black_boxes in a crossword_puzzle -- we return to the hotel . Errand accomplished , everyone is more relaxed . I am invited to stay for lunch . Quicker than I can make a peanut_butter sandwich , it seems , Paul arrives with three plates of steak , broccoli , cauliflower and beans . &quot; We don ' t talk while we eat , &quot; Paul informs me when I start to chatter . &quot; If you start talking , Donna won ' t know what she ' s eating. &quot; We click knives and forks and &quot; simply be. &quot; Occasionally , a hum meets a good bite or signifies a private thought . I mention after lunch that Donna doesn ' t seem to be interested in &quot; buzzing &quot; on colors and sounds as much as she used to . I remembered standing under a pink street light with her late one evening , our faces turned_up to catch the falling snow directly -- it felt_like we were speeding through space , rushing through a field of tiny pink planets . Did the willful control of autistic symptoms that imprisoned her also mean giving_up the extraordinary pleasures of her acute sensory perception ? What activities does she now enjoy ? She says the concept of &quot; enjoy &quot; is a whole new realm . She and Paul have &quot; developed a checking procedure which gives us , for the first time , an ability to tell compulsion from ' want ' or ' like. ' &quot; That was a huge breakthrough in autism terms ; now that she knows the difference , she buzzes only when she &quot; wants &quot; to and not because the snow is there . I put_on my coat and prepare_for terse farewells . The first time Donna and I parted company , she said , &quot; Good-by &quot; and closed the door . The next time , as if teaching herself to be more social , she said , &quot; Goodby . . . and thank_you . You have been a great bagful of information. &quot; Now , with the blunt honesty of her real self , she says : &quot; I can ' t say I ' ve enjoyed your company . But I didn ' t mind it. &quot; She means to be clear , but then worries . &quot; Did that hurt your feelings ? &quot; she asks . Red People have complicated feelings that are always cropping_up unexpectedly , getting hurt unintentionally . &quot; No , &quot; I answer honestly . After three years , I understand that while I may be enjoying Donna , she is most likely enduring me . AFTER A WEEK IN NEW YORK with another week of interviews to go , Donna calls to ask whether she and Paul can come_to Connecticut for the weekend . When I come_to pick them up , Paul asks me to look directly at him before we leave . It ' s a necessary hurdle to surmount before he can move_into close proximity with me . I make eye_contact , which , just like loud voices and fluttery gestures , can cause sensory pain . He jumps , then laughs_loudly , then shivers . &quot; It ' s like being pelted with ice_cubes , &quot; he explains . It hurts , but it ' s done . Now he can bear my company for the weekend . Donna mentions that she and Paul have a firm house rule : No leaving soap suds in the sink after doing the dishes . Suds contain rainbows of color , and they can nearly paralyze an autistic person . If one of them happened by the sink , he or she could get stuck until the bubbles burst . I ask Donna if they have any other household rules . Here is a partial list : No reading newspaper_headlines in gas_stations or newsstands . No watching Oprah Winfrey or Sally Jesse Raphael without checking first if I want to . No making the fruit bowl symmetrical . Attempt to keep track of your face and your body at all times . Say , &quot; It ' s important to me , &quot; instead of just going_ahead and doing things when you face opposition and can ' t battle verbally . Don ' t force yourself to stay in rooms or situations , eat food or be with people that are allergenic or that force you to disassociate or overload . Say &quot; time &quot; instead of throwing wobblies . Don ' t talk or answer people in a triggered way -- triggering gets_out of control and the consequences are entirely out of your hands . To seem is not to be . No lining feet up with the furniture . Scrub your underarms -- just putting soap on your body is not washing . Take your glasses off before dressing ( and put them back on afterward ) . Dare to mess . Don ' t use stored voices , stored intonation , stored movements or stored facial_expressions . Never buzz on a road . Be nice to your body . I have instructed my son Ryan , who is home from college , on the basic rules of Being with Donna and Paul . He ' s a gregarious kid with a ready handshake and hearty laugh . I tell him to reverse all his usual instincts : &quot; You ' ll make them most comfortable by ignoring them. &quot; When we enter through the back_door that afternoon , he quickly turns_off the TV and disappears so that they can get acquainted with the house . After depositing their copious luggage , computer equipment and grocery_bags in the guest room and kitchen , they begin feeling my house -- touching objects , tapping walls . &quot; What ' s that noise ? &quot; Paul asks suddenly . I recognize the faint electrical hum of the refrigerator -- which Paul hears reverberating off the walls , blasting his ears . When they are acclimated , I bring Ryan back into the kitchen to introduce him . &quot; Hello-glad-to-meet-you &quot; he says , looking down at his feet and speaking like a robot . He stands awkward and still for a moment , like a rookie actor who doesn ' t know where to put his hands . Donna wonders whether he is autistic or well-educated . She asks : &quot; Are you always this quiet ? &quot; Simultaneously , we answer , &quot; Never &quot; and &quot; Sometimes. &quot; I mean that Ryan is not autistic ; he means that he can handle the rules . Getting a straight answer from the Red People is a trial . Ryan and I go_out for lunch to give Donna and Paul the kitchen to themselves . When we return , they have cooked , eaten , done the dishes and are now outside in their snowsuits . My yard , front and back , is filled with exquisite snow sculptures : A perfect cat , with thin twiggy whiskers ; a penguin on an iceberg with a fish at its webbed feet ; a large snail with antennae . Their masterpiece is a two-story cottage landscaped with shrubs and trees ; Paul is placing lighted windows in the second story . He asks if it was OK to take a_few yellow Post-It notes from my office . Without a word , Ryan goes_to the front_porch and picks some flakes of chipped concrete off the steps . As Paul puts the last Post-It in a second-story window , Ryan makes a flagstone path to the front_door . Donna hums . &quot; There are other ways of communicating besides language , &quot; as she often says . Aware of their food allergies , I ask whether Paul would like to cook dinner . Paul freezes at the suggestion . I don ' t know what part of my question has thrown him . Donna , reading his expression , calmly begins what I now recognize as a familiar litany of questions : &quot; Does Paul want to cook ? &quot; No response . &quot; Does Paul not want to cook ? &quot; A faint smile . &quot; Do Paul ' s defenses want to cook ? &quot; No response . &quot; Does Paul want Mary Kay to cook ? &quot; A faint smile . &quot; Does Paul want Ryan to cook ? &quot; A big smile . So now we know . AS WE GET INTO THE CAR the next day , Paul says , &quot; Look , Donna ! The big black arm is swinging back and forth instead of around in a circle ! &quot; &quot; Oh , yes ! &quot; she says , like a tourist spotting a cultural peculiarity in a foreign country . I look_up from the ignition to see what they ' re talking_about . What black arm ? &quot; There , &quot; Paul points to the house next door . I look_at the broad white exterior , the windows , the shrubbery . I see no arms . &quot; In the electric meter , &quot; he explains . I squint and focus , finally spotting a tiny black dot moving along a slotted opening . Even with perception glasses , Paul and Donna take_in every minuscule movement . I start to understand Paul ' s earlier comment that 80 % of the information overload is visual . I have lived next door to the big black arm for four years and never noticed it . Donna ' s agent has invited us all to her country_house for Sunday brunch . It qualifies as a &quot; dinner_party , &quot; which is never fun -- but Donna knows Ellen will appreciate the effort and she chooses to go . She and Paul have established their decision as a &quot; want to &quot; and not a compulsion to be polite . ( &quot; Mary Kay can take_care of the ' blah , blah , blah , ' &quot; Paul says. ) During lunch as Ellen and and I talk , Donna overhears a remark that gives her a new insight . &quot; So you don ' t just sell books for the money -- you keep them for a while and make them better . You have feelings about the books ? &quot; Donna asks . &quot; You care about them before you sell them ? &quot; &quot; Yes , that ' s right , &quot; Ellen clarifies . &quot; So , you are like a baby-sitter of books ? &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; Ellen says , smiling broadly . They connect . Ellen walks us to the car after lunch . &quot; Goodby , Donna , &quot; she says warmly . &quot; I ' ll miss you. &quot; &quot; Good-by , &quot; Donna says , and closes the car_door . We drive_in silence for a while . &quot; Why did she say , ' I ' ll miss you ? ' &quot; she asks . I explain the concept of missing . &quot; Why didn ' t she keep that feeling to herself ? &quot; There is no accusation in her questions -- she is merely consulting her bag of information , trying to understand the mysterious ways of the Red People . We like to blah-blah , we get attached , we love and enjoy , we miss . AFTER DINNER SUNDAY night , we realize we are getting close to our own goodby . Donna starts twirling a napkin on the table , buzzing on the spin . &quot; Stop that , Donna , &quot; Paul says , then looks toward me . &quot; She ' s doing that to make you irrelevant , &quot; he states matter-of-factly . Donna laughs her real laugh . She is delighted to be understood so perfectly , to be called_on her &quot; autie &quot; behavior . When a similar exchange occurred the day before , Paul wondered if I had taken his comment as criticism of Donna . He explained their agreement to help each other this way , to recognize autism and assist each other in controlling it . Several times throughout their visit , one or the other had issued a reminder -- &quot; Don ' t use ' voices ' when you tell a story &quot; . . . &quot; that ' s a ' stored dialogue , ' not a ' conversation ' &quot; . . . &quot; Build a sculpture but don ' t ' perform ' for people. &quot; The No . 1 rule : Be your real self . Which means you have to have a self . Donna can mesmerize audiences with her ability to recite whole books on the subject of autism -- and just about anything else -- but Paul recognizes that those compelling speeches are not always what she means to say . Her own conversation is much more of a struggle . Much harder , but authentic . &quot; It ' s like if someone you knew could walk sat_down in a wheelchair and would n ' t get_up , &quot; Paul explains . &quot; You could push her around , but that would n ' t be good because you know she really wants to walk. &quot; He sees his role as her companion walker . Donna now looks directly at Paul . &quot; I think you are a good man , &quot; she says . It is a whole , emotional speech . His real smile lights_up as he simultaneously laughs and cries in soft , quiet gulps . It ' s painful , but he stays with the emotion . He doesn ' t overload . I realize then that their rules for an autistic marriage would be useful to all married_couples : Pay_attention to details -- they matter ; don ' t aggravate each other with compulsive , thoughtless habits ; don ' t assume you understand -- check feelings out with each other ; be tolerant of comforting quirks ; teach each other what you are learning about the world ; get_out of your wheelchair and walk on_your_own two feet . My sister hopes that Donna will write another book , called Everybody Everywhere , a kind of etiquette manual that would teach people to be more sensitive and less presumptuous about the rules and expectations we impose on other people . &quot; I am an accidental educator , &quot; Donna says when I tell her she has taught me a lot about my own life . She had no choice about instructing the Red People in the ways of autism if she wanted to come_out of her private world . Now that she has , maybe she doesn ' t need to write any more books . All she wanted , for nearly 30 years now , was to find a specialship where she could belong -- a place where her culture could happen . I drive my odd couple to their next destination . Then , after speedy goodbys , I drive_home , numb with exhaustion . Being a chauffeur to two autistic people in_love -- explaining , learning , running interference between small planets -- I feel_like I ' m approaching overload myself . I recognize shutdown not as an absence of emotions but too many at once . A surge of affection rises , a fierce yearning for happiness and safety and cosmic understanding . The two small red taillights from the car ahead disappear around a bend and my mind goes blank .</TEXT>
