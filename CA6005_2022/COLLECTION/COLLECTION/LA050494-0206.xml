   <HEADLINE> KEY CONSERVATION QUESTIONS RAISED BY COUGAR ATTACK ; WILDLIFE : THE MOUNTAIN_LION POPULATION HAS INCREASED IN CALIFORNIA . IS A RESUMPTION OF HUNTING THE ANSWER ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has been more_than a week since Barbara Schoener was ambushed and killed by a mountain_lion while jogging on a trail in the Northern California wilderness . But the focus , because of the nature of the incident April 23 in the_hills northeast of Sacramento , remains on cougars . A fairly large lion attacked Schoener from behind while she jogged down the remote trail , killing her with bites to the neck and head . The lion then dragged her body 300 feet before covering it with leaves and debris . The state , responding to concerns of citizens , finally located the animal on Sunday . Dogs treed the female lion and a marksman shot and killed it . But the issue won ' t die . Parents are keeping a close watch on their children . Sightings , or alleged sightings , of mountain_lions are rising sharply in rural Northern California . The attack and subsequent lion hunt has been front-page news nearly every day throughout the region . The hunting community is using the highly publicized attack , only the latest of many recent encounters between mountain_lions and humans in California , as ammunition in its drive to put lions back on the list of animals it can hunt . There has been no sport hunting for mountain_lions since temporary moratoriums went_into effect in 1972 . A permanent ban on hunting lions , with the exception of depredation hunts for animals that harm humans , livestock or pets , went_into effect in 1990 with the passage of Prop . 117 . &quot; The animals are overrunning their ranges , &quot; said Dan Heal , chairman of the Chico-based Sportsmen ' s Task_Force of California , an organization that represents 38 state hunting clubs . &quot; Hunting would make the animals more wary of man . Now the lion population has lost its fear of man . Up here in Chico , we have encounters daily . Things are so bad that people are taking things into their own hands , killing the lions and letting them lay. &quot; A concerned public again is expressing concerns that mountain_lions are finding deer and smaller animals -- their natural prey -- so hard to come_by that they have no choice but to attack and eat humans . Some are worried that the animals are so numerous now that encounters between man and mountain_lion will become common . The attack on Schoener was by a healthy adult lion , and against an adult who was seemingly in excellent physical condition . Schoener , 40 , was an avid jogger who liked to run marathons . It was not the first such incident . On Jan . 14 , 1991 , an 18-year-old jogger near Idaho Springs , Colo. , was running alone on a remote trail near his high_school . Scott Lancaster was jumped , killed and partially consumed by a 100-pound male lion . The lion was later tracked and killed and an examination showed no signs of ill_health . &quot; ( Mountain_lions ) are predators and they are opportunistic , &quot; said Terry Mansfield , chief of the wildlife division for the California Department of Fish and Game . &quot; The way lions eat livestock , they get_into a flock of sheep -- they may kill 30-60 sheep in one night . Not because he thinks he ' s going_to eat it all , but because he ' s a predator. &quot; Paul Beier , of the Department of Forestry and Resource Management at UC Berkeley , has documented records of 53 unprovoked attacks by cougars on humans in the United States and Canada from 1890 to 1990 . In an appendix to the report in 1992 , Beier said , &quot; There is no substantial evidence that habituation ( to humans ) has played a role in any particular attack nor in the general recent increase in attacks. &quot; Mansfield , who has done extensive research on mountain_lions , discounted the theory that they are responding to a decrease in the numbers of deer in California . Deer herds are at an all-time low . &quot; Their primary food item is deer , but they can eat anything from ground_squirrels to an ostrich in a back yard , &quot; Mansfield said . &quot; They ' ll eat dogs and cats . They love porcupines , skunks , opossums and bobcats . A mature lion will even eat another lion . In coastal areas from Humboldt to Santa Barbara , wild pigs have expanded . Wild pigs are now part of their diet. &quot; In the case of Schoener , it was discovered that the 80-pound female lion had been lactating , and state wildlife experts as of Tuesday afternoon were still searching the_hills northeast of Sacramento for the lion ' s den . Was the cougar merely protecting her cubs ? Possibly , but not likely . &quot; Quite frankly , our knowledge of female lions when they ' re giving_birth to kittens is that they usually go_to a remote , rugged spot away from any disturbance to give_birth , &quot; Mansfield said . &quot; And if they are disturbed , or if you come_into the area , they will often remove kittens the first night after that , so there really is no basis to the theory that this lion was defending her kittens. &quot; Mansfield refused to speculate on what prompted the lion to attack Schoener , but he wasn ' t surprised that the attack took_place . &quot; What we ' ve got is an increasing lion population over the last 25 years , &quot; he said . &quot; On top of that , there are 31 million people in California . People are living , working and recreating more and more in lion habitat . This shouldn ' t be a surprise to anyone. &quot; Indeed , mountain_lions and humans have been_on a collision course since &quot; the bounty days &quot; from 1907 to 1963 , when cash incentives to kill cougars were offered , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 12 # 500 , or about 220 a year . Since then , both species have experienced population explosions . There were an estimated 2 # 400 mountain_lions in California in 1971 . There are 4 # 000 to 6 # 000 today . Depredation permits are up from five in 1971 to about 190 a year in the last three years . The number of lions killed each year in depredation hunts is up_to about 70 per year . &quot; And that ' s a very minimal estimate because some people take things into their own hands ( and kill a lion ) and never report it , &quot; Mansfield said . Is the resumption of hunting the answer ? California is the only state in the western United States that does not hold regulated hunts for mountain_lions . Prop . 117 , besides prohibiting the hunting of mountain_lions , mandated the state to spend $ 30 million annually on land acquisition for wildlife , a portion to go toward lion and deer habitat . &quot; There are some good things about it , but the unfortunate thing is that it isn ' t good for the state , &quot; said Heal , of the Sportsman ' s Task_Force . &quot; There is no management . The DFG ' s hands are tied and kids are being mauled in state parks. &quot; Heal ' s allusion was to two incidents in 1986 , when children were mauled in Ronald W . Caspers Wilderness Park near San Juan Capistrano . Since then , lion sightings and encounters have been increasing steadily in Northern and Southern California . Said Mansfield : &quot; There ' s no biological need to prohibit hunting . But on the other hand , we can ' t guarantee public safety . You can ' t say this ( attack on Schoener ) would not have happened if we would have had hunting taking_place . You just simply can ' t say that . &quot; But there is a message : We can and should be more flexible in the way we manage lions , both to reach our goal of maintaining a lion population , but also of minimizing conflicts . We could turn_around and try to manage the lion population by allowing hunting by the public with quotas and zones in specific areas. &quot; Hunting or no , Mansfield said , the problem isn ' t going_to go_away . &quot; We can expect more conflicts to occur in the future , &quot; he said . &quot; I hate to predict that , but quite frankly , it ' s not if it ' s going_to happen again , but when . &quot;</TEXT>
