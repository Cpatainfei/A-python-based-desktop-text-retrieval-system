   <TEXT> The State Board_of_Education has been sued over its lack of regulations against sexual_harassment and sex discrimination in public_school districts . In the suit announced Wednesday , the Los Angeles-based California Women ' s Law Center alleges that the state board has ignored a mandate from the Legislature to develop regulations to protect students and their families . The center bases its case on the 1982 Sex Equity in Education Act prohibiting sex discrimination in academic and athletic programs , extracurricular_activities and occupational training . It called_for the state boards that oversee public education to &quot; issue rules , regulations or orders &quot; to implement the law . Joseph R . Symkowick , general counsel for the Department_of_Education , said his office has not had a chance to thoroughly review the lawsuit . &quot; While we understand the concerns , we have to consider carefully whether the law required us to do what they claim or whether there was some discretion left for the board &quot; in whether to come_up with regulations , he said .</TEXT>
