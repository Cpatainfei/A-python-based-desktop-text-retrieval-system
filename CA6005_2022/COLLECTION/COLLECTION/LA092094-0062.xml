   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; COMING TO THE AID OF HIS PARTY ; GREGOR GYSI HAS REBUILT THE FORMER EAST_GERMANY ' S COMMUNIST FACTION INTO A NEW POLITICAL FORCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was Nov . 8 , 1989 , and the Berlin Wall was but a day away from its appointment with the sledgehammer . In East Berlin , the governing class was running_for cover . The Politburo of the East_German Communist_Party had just resigned en bloc ; the government , in a hapless , too-little too-late attempt to contain the uncontainable , had announced that it would ease the regime ' s detested travel restrictions . On the steps of the Zentralkomitee building , tens of thousands of protesters gathered to tell the party that such half-hearted measures were not quite what they had_in_mind . Out of the crowd stepped a small man , his hair thinning at the top , a lawyer and single father whose round glasses and intense brown eyes suggested a life of reading and contemplation . Few outside the nascent East_German reform_movement even knew Gregor Gysi -- much less what he stood_for . No one , not even Gysi himself , supposed that just one month later he would be elected chairman of what was left of the Communist_Party and given one of the great Missions Impossible of the socialist world : to reform the decrepit , wholly discredited , Soviet-installed entity , and to persuade Germans that they should not only forgive and tolerate it , but to vote for it of_their_own accord . &quot; I just wanted to go_to the rally , make a speech and go_back home , &quot; Gysi said recently in an interview in the eastern German town of Potsdam , where he stopped for lunch during a day of electioneering . It has taken_five years , but Gysi has done the undoable : He has rebuilt the Communist_Party -- doing business now as the Party of Democratic Socialism -- and made_it such a force in today ' s united Germany that the country ' s established politicians have resorted_to a campaign of old-time red-baiting to try to put it in its place . &quot; The Democratic Socialist cadres will lead the people over the precipice , &quot; German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned a jeering crowd recently in this far-eastern German town . &quot; As long as we ( Christian Democrats ) are here , we will never let the fascist , Communist rabble tyrannize the people. &quot; Politicians of Kohl ' s cut worry not that the former Communists could ever govern again -- this is not Hungary or Poland -- but that they are gaining strength in the east at a time when Germany ' s electoral dispensation is at a watershed . Ever since the Federal_Republic_of_Germany was founded in 1949 , parliamentary power here has been divided among three established , centrist parties : the conservative Christian Democrats , the center-left Social Democrats and the independent Free Democrats , who have moved_back_and_forth into coalitions with two big entities . Now , though , with federal elections looming on Oct . 16 , the Free Democrats are faring so poorly that they may_not even be represented in the next Parliament . That would leave Kohl ' s governing Christian Democrats without a suitable junior coalition partner , should they fail to achieve a clear majority by themselves . With the former Communists flourishing in the old East , Germany ' s mainstream politicians thus face the unappetizing prospect of having to parley with their lifelong enemies come the morning of Oct . 17 , just to be able to form a workable government . This is precisely what happened in June , in elections in the state of Saxony-Anhalt : The Social Democrats were able to form a viable coalition government only with tacit cooperation from the former Communists , a party with which , they had sworn long and loud , they would never to do business . Kohl called the move &quot; a scandal on an enormous scale &quot; and &quot; a treasonous act. &quot; If anyone is to blame -- or to thank , depending_on one ' s point_of_view -- for this remarkable comeback , it is Gysi , who says all_of it is as much of an astonishment to him as_to any German . &quot; I have a good fantasy_life , but not that good , &quot; he says , laughing_at the way things have been turning_out . that ' s typical Gysi : jocular , personable -- his remarks , in short , are nothing like the one-sided discourse East_Germans were for so_long accustomed to hearing from their political_leaders . In a part of Germany where people spent 40 years listening to stolid comrades yammer on and on about sociopolitical abstractions , Gysi is something new : a politician who can speak well off the top of his head , who can articulate the dreams and disappointments of his constituency , and best of all , who can make people laugh . His style has been so arresting in eastern Germany that he has become something more_than a leading politician here ; he is also seen , these days as a charmeur . German newspapers have taken_to printing regular updates on his personal entanglements , and otherwise serious interviewers seem unable to resist asking him about his &quot; effect on women. &quot; They might better ask Gysi , formerly a general-practice lawyer and low-level member of the Communist_Party , what made him choose to stand_by the party after the East_German regime collapsed . It wasn ' t as if he had had no options , after all . He could have left for the West , as tens of thousands of other East_Germans did_in 1989 , or he could have stayed_put and gone_to work with one of the new reform groups that were coming_together that summer and fall . Gysi himself did the legal work for the first and most prominent such group , the New Forum . So why didn ' t he join , say , the New Forum , instead of pressing_on with the Communists ? The answer lies , in part , with Gysi ' s family history , and the loyalty he felt to an organization which , in the 1930s , fought the Nazis head-on and suffered terribly for doing so . Gysi ' s father , a Communist_Party member and a Jew , spent the war years dodging concentration_camps and doing underground work for what there was of a German resistance . Gysi grew_up in a household where this past was a living , shaping force ; his parents ' social milieu included Communists from all_over Europe . &quot; I inherited a certain family history , &quot; he says . &quot; The Gysi family lost a total of 18 members in concentration_camps . Although there were certainly things ( about the East_German Communist_Party ) to criticize , overall , I believed when I became a member that I was joining the biggest anti-fascist force in Germany. &quot; And then , when the party Old_Guard stumbled in 1989 , Gysi says , &quot; I didn ' t want the socialist ideals just to drown , even though those ideals have been damaged and spoiled . I thought that I had responsibility for this country , and for a process that was under way. &quot; Not the least of his fears at the time , he says , was the possibility that hard-liners might seize control of the party and order goons into the streets to crush dissent , as happened in Nicolae Ceausescu ' s Romania . &quot; It was crucial that people come_to the top of the party who could guarantee that peaceful changes take_place , &quot; he says . But it ' s one thing to want to keep a party nonviolent and something else again to want to make_it into a modern , relevant institution . Gysi says his reforms got an initial boost from the simple fact that so many former Communists abandoned the party . &quot; A party that loses 90 % of its members simply has to be a different party , &quot; he says . When the party lost all power , he points_out , the opportunists and careerists departed , leaving the field wide open for reformers like him . Which is not to say it was easy to turn_around the party ' s reputation . &quot; I felt a lot of hatred , &quot; Gysi says of the early months and years after the Berlin Wall fell , when the Communist_Party was written_off as stake-through-the-heart dead , and western Germans were accusing remaining leaders like him of siphoning its resources out of the country . In 1992 , the newsmagazine Der Spiegel even published reports that he had cooperated with the East_German secret_police . &quot; It was really difficult for me , &quot; he says . &quot; If I had known the personal consequences ( of assuming the party leadership ) , I never would have done it. &quot; Gysi sued Der Spiegel for libel and the court decided in his favor . But in January , 1993 , overextended and exhausted , he chose not to run_for another term as party chairman . He remains today the party ' s top representative in Parliament -- the Democratic Socialists now hold 16 seats in the 662-seat Bundestag -- and is the Communists ' unquestioned conscience and locomotive . To be sure , many of those who follow Gysi these days do so not because they embrace his socialist vision , but just because they are shocked by the changes that German unification has brought . Unemployment in eastern Germany is at double-digit levels , prices have soared compared to East_German times and the social safety net -- while downright cushy compared to America ' s -- is peanuts compared to the cradle-to-grave security that the old German Democratic Republic used to offer . Against this unhappy backdrop , the Democratic Socialists have helped found various citizens ' rights groups -- a tenants ' union , for instance and an unemployed people ' s society -- and maintained close , grass-roots ties with the sick , the elderly and the unemployed . Over the last few weeks , as the former Communists have come under increasingly strident attacks from centrist politicians , these disadvantaged eastern Germans have proven some of Gysi ' s most militant supporters . But one recent poll found that 44 % of the party ' s supporters claim satisfaction with their economic lot . These well-off supporters have turned_to the Democratic Socialists , in many cases , because they live_in the former East and have grown convinced over the last five years that they will never be adequately represented by a western politician or party . Still more support comes from idealistic young eastern Germans who , despite everything that has happened , still believe_in socialism . To them , the fall of the Eastern Bloc was not a sign that socialism is a doomed ideology ; rather , it was simply evidence that socialism won ' t work without democracy . Biography Gregor Gysi Born : Jan . 16 , 1948 , in Berlin Education : Studied law at East Berlin ' s Humboldt University and received his doctorate in 1976 ; he is also a certified cattle breeder , thanks to the former East_German requirement that all university_students learn a manual trade . Marital status : Gysi has been divorced since 1974 . He has two sons , ages 22 and 30 . Quote : &quot; At the moment , we ' re the most honest , upstanding party in Bonn . There is not one scandal involving Democratic Socialist delegates . And the reasons for this are clear to see : First , we are morally superior , and second , we haven ' t had the chance to become immoral because no one will make deals with us. &quot;</TEXT>
