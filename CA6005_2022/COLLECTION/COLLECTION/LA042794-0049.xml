   <HEADLINE> DOW FALLS 6 AHEAD OF 1-DAY CLOSURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Dow Jones industrial average closed slightly lower Tuesday as investors took profits from the previous day ' s surge and prepared_for the market being closed today in memory of former President Richard Nixon . The Dow meandered at modestly lower levels throughout the uneventful session . It closed at 3 # 699.54 , off 6.24. The popular market indicator advanced 57.10 points Monday to end above 3 # 700 for the first time in about a month . Most broad market measures heavily weighted with New York Stock_Exchange issues also lost ground . The NYSE composite slipped 0.06 to 250.41 ; Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index shed 0.84 to 451.87. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly small issues rose 3.41 to 734.21. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones about 7 to 5 on Big Board volume of 288.12 million shares , down from 263.55 million the day before . The lackluster day for stocks came despite a decent showing for bonds amid mixed economic news . Reports of a boost in consumer confidence eroded some of the optimism sparked by a Labor_Department report on employment costs . The Treasury ' s 30-year bond yield fell to 7.10 % from 7.15 % on Monday . The bond ' s price , which moves_in the opposite direction , rose 19 / 32 point , or $ 5.94 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . The weeklong rally has pushed_down long-term bond yields about a third of a percentage_point since April 18 , when the Federal_Reserve_Board raised short-term interest_rates for the third time this year . The positive reaction of fixed-income investors contrasted with the market ' s sharp negative response to previous Fed rate hikes in February and March . In the stock_market , investors seemed unwilling to take positions before a potentially market-moving economic report due Thursday . U.S. financial markets are closed today in honor of Nixon , who died Friday . The Conference Board , a New York research group , said its index of consumer confidence jumped 5 points in April to 91.7 and was up 24 points from last April . Signs of strong economic activity usually upset bond traders , who worry that rapid_growth will breed inflation , which devalues fixed interest-bearing investments . Good inflation news , however , muted the impact of the confidence report . The Labor_Department said its employment cost index , considered one of the best gauges of wage inflation pressures , rose 3.2 % in the year ended March 31 . That was the smallest increase on record . Among the market highlights : * Tobacco stocks were ignited by the news that Britain ' s BAT Industries has agreed to pay $ 1 billion in cash for American Tobacco , a division of American Brands , which jumped 2 7 / 8 to 34 5 / 8 in active NYSE trading . * Other heavily traded tobacco stocks were RJR Nabisco , which gained 3 / 8 to 6 7 / 8 in Big Board-leading volume , and Philip Morris , which moved_up 2 to 54 1 / 4 . * Healthy quarterly results helped Disney gain 1 1 / 8 to 43 1 / 2 . An unexpectedly poor report drove the insurer UNUM ' s stock down 4 1 / 4 to 50 1 / 4 . AST Research rose 3 / 4 to 19 . * Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing rose 1 to 48 3 / 4 . Prudential Securities upgraded the stock ' s rating to &quot; buy. &quot; * Oil stocks came under pressure . Chevron fell 1 3 / 4 to 90 7 / 8 after it reported a 23 % plunge in earnings . Texaco slipped 1 1 / 4 to 64 3 / 8 . * RHI Entertainment surged 9 1 / 8 to 35 5 / 8 on the American_Stock_Exchange in response to news that Hallmark Cards will acquire all outstanding RHI shares for $ 36 each . * One big loser was the Mexican issue Gupta , which tumbled 9 3 / 4 to 13 1 / 2 and headed the Nasdaq list of active stocks . Overseas markets turned_in a mixed performance . In Europe , the Frankfurt DAX 30-share average index ended at 2 # 243.20 , up 1.86 % or 40.98 points ; London ' s Financial Times 100-share average ended 19.2 points higher at 3 # 125.3. In Tokyo , the 225-share Nikkei average closed_down 80.21 points at 19 # 628.93. Mexico ' s Bolsa index came_on strong in late trading to close 93.05 points higher at 2 # 284.13 , on expectations of a drop_in Mexican interest_rates and news of a multibillion-dollar currency swap agreement among the United States , Canada and Mexico . In other markets : Light , sweet crude_oil fell 33 cents to $ 16.91 a barrel on the New York Merc . Gold rose on the New York Comex to $ 373.90 an ounce , up 50 cents ; silver fetched $ 5.173 , up 4.5 cents . Elsewhere , the dollar was mostly lower against major foreign currencies .
