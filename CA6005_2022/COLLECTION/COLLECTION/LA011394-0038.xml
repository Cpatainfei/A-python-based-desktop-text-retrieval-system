   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON OPENING NATO MEMBERSHIP ; NO : THE ALLIANCE IS ONLY A HUSK OF OUTDATED MYTHS ; ADDING EASTERN EUROPE COULD SUCK AMERICA INTO A MAELSTROM OF BIG-POWER RIVALRIES AND FUTURE BOSNIAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The quibbling over whether Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Ukraine should be admitted to NATO masks the real issues in America ' s post-Cold War European policy -- whether NATO ' s extension into Eastern Europe , or indeed the alliance ' s continuing existence , serves U.S. interests . The Clinton_Administration has pulled_out all_the stops to reaffirm NATO ' s continuing importance . But these arguments are nothing more_than a collection of shopworn myths . * Myth No . 1 : European security is crucial because America invariably becomes involved in the Continent ' s wars . Since America gained independence , Europe has experienced great-power conflicts in 1792 , 1801 , 1805-1815 , 1866 , 1870 and 1877 -- none of which remotely affected U.S. security . American intervention in World_War I was driven by ideological concerns , not security threats , and foreclosed the possibility of a compromise peace that might have ended the war before revolutions unhinged Europe . Washington ' s attempt to impose a Wilsonian peace on post-World War I Europe sowed the seeds both of World_War_II and of many of today ' s conflicts . * Myth No . 2 : The United States can unite post-Cold War Europe . In fact , modern Europe has never been united because the East has consistently lagged behind Western Europe in politicaland economic development and has been more prone to domestic political turmoil . * Myth No . 3 : By promoting the spread of democracy in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet_Union , the United States can ensure peace . The notion that democracies do not fight democracies is popular but untrue . Thus even if democracy takes_root firmly in Eastern Europe , peace is not guaranteed . * Myth No . 4 : The spread of free markets and economic interdependence to all_of Europe will promote peace . The idea that free_trade creates a &quot; harmony of interests &quot; and thus leads to peace is another fashionable idea than has been repeatedly disproved . No doubt European turbulence will have some effect on American economic interests . But great_powers that depend_on distant and unstable regions for their prosperity pay a big price . Far from being a force for peace , today ' s version of interdependence simply rationalizes the dangerous extension of American security guarantees into an endemically turbulent region . * Myth No . 5 : The United States can bring &quot; stability &quot; to post-Cold War Eastern Europe just as it did to post-World War II Western Europe . Peace and cooperation supplanted war and competition because the Soviet threat forced Western Europe to coalesce and because America protected the West Europeans from themselves . The Soviet presence in Eastern Europe stabilized relations in that region . The &quot; long peace &quot; since 1945 was a product of the Cold_War and without bipolarity , Europe inevitably is headed back to its normal patterns featuring war , great-power security and economic competition . NATO has failed conspicuously to resolve the Bosnian conflict -- the archetype of the kind of instability NATO is supposed to deal with -- because , at least until now , its members wisely have been reluctant to become involved in such quagmires . But even more troubling than the prospect of U.S. military involvement in future Bosnias is the certainty that if NATO &quot; moves east , &quot; the United States will find itself in the middle of big-power rivalries involving Germany , Russia and Ukraine . The Administration ' s policy will not prevent European upheaval , but simply ensure that the United States is swept_up in the maelstrom . In the final analysis , Eastern Europe ' s quarrels are between people of whom we know -- and should want to know -- nothing .</TEXT>
