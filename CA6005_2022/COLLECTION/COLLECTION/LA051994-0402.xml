   <TEXT> Tony Henderson and Mikael Black , 20-year-old Mormons from Utah , remember trembling with excitement as they held their sealed letters from Salt_Lake_City summoning them to serve missions . Both had taken three years of German in high_school and thought the odds were pretty good they ' d get_to use it . Then they opened the letters . Destination : Long_Beach . Language : Khmer ( the predominant language of Cambodia ) . &quot; I was kind of shocked because I didn ' t know there were Cambodians in the United States , &quot; Henderson said . Now in the middle of their two-year missions for the church , they spend six days a week combing Long_Beach apartment neighborhoods is search of Cambodians willing to learn about the Mormon faith . Wearing white short-sleeve shirts with plain-print ties , Henderson and Black look_for tell-tale signs of Cambodian households : rice embedded in lawns , tassels hanging from rear-view mirrors of cars , sandals stacked outside doorways . Their objective , Henderson said , &quot; is to help bring souls to Christ. &quot; Once a homogeneous church best known outside its ranks for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir , Brigham Young University and the Osmond family , the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints is expanding and diversifying at a rapid pace in Southern California and around the globe . Mormon_church membership grew by 22 % in the United States between 1982 and 1991 , while some mainstream Protestant_denominations reported declines of up_to 40 % , according to the National Council of Churches . Mormon_church membership worldwide has climbed from 5 million in 1982 to 9 million currently , according to church figures . And for the first time in the church ' s 164-year history , half of the world ' s Mormons now live outside the United States , officials say . In Southern California , the trends have been mixed . The church has seen some of its white membership age and retire to other regions of the country . But in Long_Beach and other local areas , the church has reached_out to replace its departing white members with Latinos , Samoans , Tongans , Cambodians and others . Within the 4 # 000-member Long_Beach East Stake , a Cambodian branch that didn ' t exist 13 years ago has nearly 800 baptized members and picks_up 50 converts a year , Mormon leaders say . ( Stakes are regional units of the church comprising congregations called wards , which typically have 400 to 600 members , and branches , which range_in size from a dozen members to several hundred. ) A neighboring unit that covers the western section of the city , the 3 # 600-member Long_Beach Stake , includes two Samoan wards , one Tongan ward , a Spanish-speaking ward and a Spanish-speaking branch . Only four of the stake ' s nine congregations are English-speaking . Robert Ward , president of the stake , said its membership was 95 % white 40 years ago when he was a Polytechnic High teen-ager entering the church ' s priesthood . &quot; We really are multicultural , and it ' s great , &quot; Ward said . To keep_up with the growth , the church has poured millions of dollars into its Southern California facilities . Four years ago , the church opened a $ 4-million , 50 # 000-square-foot worship center at 228th and Main_streets in Carson . The Huntington Park West Stake center is expected to open this summer , and the church is planning to spend $ 4 million renovating the Hollywood Ward and the Wilshire Ward in Koreatown . The church also is purchasing an eight-acre parcel at 3000 E . South St . in Lakewood . Church officials say plans for the site may include a building that could house as_many as eight congregations . The recently renovated stake center at 3701 Elm Ave . in Long_Beach is equipped to translate services and meetings into several languages . While leaders speak from the pulpit in the main chapel , Samoans , Tongans and Latinos in the audience wear headphones and listen to translators who sit in nearby rooms and watch the proceedings on television monitors . The demographic changes are in striking contrast to a common perception that the Mormon_church is a predominantly white church that has sought to stay that way . After all , the church denied its priesthood to blacks for more_than a century until a &quot; divine revelation &quot; in 1978 ended such discrimination and opened the door to &quot; every faithful , worthy man in the church. &quot; But researchers say the common perception of the Mormon_church is increasingly outdated . Almost from its inception , the church began sending missionaries to Europe and to Mexico . Since then , the church has ventured into 149 countries , &quot; every country that allows it to come_in , &quot; said J . Gordon Melton , director of the Santa Barbara-based Institute for the Study of American Religion . &quot; Today , Mormons would be among the five most ethnically and culturally diverse churches going. &quot; The Book_of_Mormon , the pillar of the church ' s faith , tells the story of immigrants from the Middle_East who founded elaborate civilizations in the Americas . Visited by Christ after the Resurrection , they prospered for centuries , only to disappear after falling victim to evil ways and fighting among themselves . Their story , inscribed on golden tablets , was said to have been found by Joseph_Smith in 1823 , guided by a vision of an angel named Moroni . It is an image of Moroni , covered in gold_leaf , that can be seen holding a trumpet atop the church ' s temples around the world . * Smith established for the church a strict code_of_conduct that has been modified over the years but continues to place a large_number of demands on its members . Mormons are expected to donate a tenth of their income to the church , wear special undergarments decorated with markings that symbolize a covenant with God and follow dietary rules known as the Word of Wisdom , which bans alcohol , coffee , tea and tobacco , and urges that meat be consumed only sparingly . Families gather one night each week for a &quot; home evening &quot; devoted to prayer , study and other activities that can range from board_games to night skiing . The church teaches that it is important for families to get_along because they will spend eternity together in heaven . Devout Mormons pray , study and socialize every Sunday at chapels , or meeting_houses . Classes , worship and meetings can fill_up to 10 hours a week , with volunteer pastors , known as bishops , and higher-ranking church officials putting_in much more time . With no professional clergy , church_services are led by members of the congregation . Church_members can baptize their own children or spouses , they can practice healing rites and all male members of the church are eligible for its priesthood . Manuel Vasquez , president of a Latino branch in Long_Beach , says such opportunities for participation didn ' t exist in the Catholic faith he abandoned 20 years ago . &quot; In this church the priesthood is for every man ; there , it ' s only for one , &quot; said Vasquez , 64 . &quot; I can bless my sons and I can bless other people . This is the true church. &quot; Keith J . Atkinson , a church spokesman who served a mission in Mexico , said the church ' s hands-on approach has attracted many Latinos who have found the Catholic faith too distant . Other Mormon converts are attracted by the church ' s commitment to traditional family values and stringent moral guidelines . Matt Chheng , who was a member of a Cambodian branch in Long_Beach until he moved to South Carolina recently , said his parents joined the church when he was a child because they wanted him to have a strict upbringing . Chheng , 24 , said he was skeptical at first but came_to appreciate the sense_of_purpose and direction instilled by the church . &quot; I know where I ' m going , &quot; he said . &quot; I know I ' m not supposed to do drugs , drink a beer -- that kind of thing . I know what ' s right and wrong. &quot; Chheng taught those values to a new generation of Cambodians joining the church in Long_Beach . He was the branch ' s first nonwhite to be appointed Young_Men ' s President , who oversees the branch ' s youth activities . Chheng , an insurance salesman , said his colleagues at_work often were surprised to learn he is a Mormon . Some wondered how a Cambodian can relate to a church in which the vast majority of leaders , including the president of the Cambodian branch , are white . &quot; We ' re all His children ; we just happened to have come from a different part of the world , &quot; Chheng said . Joseph_Smith could just as easily have been Cambodian , Chheng said , &quot; if it was supposed to be that way. &quot; * The church depends_on members such_as Vasquez and Chheng to be examples of Mormonism ' s virtues . Church leaders say many converts are introduced to the church by Mormon neighbors . But casual contacts alone do not account_for the church ' s rapid expansion . Clues to understanding that phenomenon lie_in the church ' s structure and tenets . When it was a fledgling religious_movement in the early 19th Century , the church espoused polygamy . Though justification was said to be found in the Old_Testament , the practice had the pragmatic impact of expanding the ranks of the church . Polygamy was officially discarded in 1890 , but the church continues to promote a high birth_rate even today . Temple statues and church literature depict large families as the ideal , and women ' s roles as mothers and homemakers are emphasized . To encourage marriage , the Long_Beach East Stake has established a ward for single members . Stake President S . Lynn Richards proudly points_out that since its inception 4 1 / 2 years ago , there have been 35 marriages in the 130-member ward . Worship centers equipped with everything from kitchens to indoor basketball_courts are used for numerous social_gatherings and are loaned out_to local organizations such_as the Boy_Scouts of America . Through these activities , potential converts are continually introduced to the church and its members . Perhaps the most effective mechanism is the church ' s missionary operation . Mormon children are groomed for missionary_work from the moment they ' re old enough to learn the words to &quot; I Hope They Call Me on a Mission &quot; in the Mormon hymnal . * By the time they are 19 , the age at which they are eligible to serve , few Mormon men consider doing anything else . They send letters to Salt_Lake_City stating their willingness to serve and wait for marching orders . Women are eligible at 21 to serve 18-month missions and now constitute 22 % of the missionary roster , church officials say . If a foreign language is required , missionaries are trained at the Missionary Training Center in Provo , Utah . The center offers courses in 44 languages and trains about 3 # 300 missionaries each month , church officials say . Virtually all missionaries are expected to cover their own expenses , and the church instructs families to prepare_for this obligation . For instance , Henderson and Black , the missionaries_working in Long_Beach ' s Cambodian community , rely_on the $ 8 # 400 each of their families was advised to set_aside . While serving their missions , Henderson and Black are expected to abide_by rules of conduct that make everyday Mormon standards seem relaxed : no dating , no television , no radio , no movies , no family visits and no more_than two phone_calls home per year . * They rise at 6 a.m. , study religion for a_few hours , hit the sidewalk by 9:30 a.m. and are not permitted to return to their apartment until 9:30 p.m. They travel_by foot and bicycle through dangerous sections of the city . A shooting took_place behind their Washington Place apartment just weeks ago , and they say a police_officer once sized them up and asked sarcastically , &quot; Is it your job to be victimized ? &quot; But the young_men say that their dress code , the same as for their numerous predecessors , makes them instantly recognizable and apparently unappealing targets to neighborhood hoodlums . &quot; They know why we ' re there , &quot; Black said . &quot; Two white guys in white shirts and ties -- you stick_out like a sore thumb. &quot; Henderson and Black are among 50 # 000 missionaries_stationed around the globe , church officials say . There are 212 missionaries in the Los Angeles Mission , which includes Long_Beach and most Southeast cities . The reaction of other local religious_leaders to Mormonism ' s tenacious campaign ranges from grudging admiration to restrained irritation . The Mormon missionary activity is &quot; far more aggressive than anything we ' re doing , &quot; said Father Gregory Coiro , a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles . &quot; I don ' t want to say being aggressive is bad . Maybe we should be saying we ' re not aggressive enough. &quot; * The Catholic_Church has begun strengthening its ties to the ethnic communities of Southern California , he said . The St . Thomas_Aquinas parish in Monterey Park , for example , was recently designated a Chinese-speaking evangelical center . The move was intended to offer a home parish to the region ' s Chinese population , although the decision also angered a large segment of the parish ' s predominantly Latino membership . But Coiro said he does not believe the Catholic_church ' s Latino stronghold is being eroded by the Mormon_church . The Mormon_church is &quot; one of the many religions , sects and cults that are out there trying to attract people , &quot; he said . &quot; The best way for a Catholic to remain a Catholic is to remain well versed in what it is that makes us Catholic. &quot; He also said : &quot; Mormons ask people to believe_in some very fantastic things , like they can become the gods of_their_own planets . Someone who ' s well grounded in Christianity is not going_to join a religion that says you can become God. &quot; Most Cambodians joining the Mormon_church have converted from Buddhism . But Kong Chhean , a monk at a temple at 2100 W . Willow St . in Long_Beach , said Mormonism is not seen as an enemy or a rival . Buddhism is an open-minded , passive faith that does not forbid its followers to explore other philosophies , Chhean said . &quot; On Sunday they are going_to church , and on Cambodian New Year they come_to temple , &quot; Chhean said . Chhean ' s only complaint about Mormon missionaries is one of the most common . &quot; They shouldn ' t go from house to house , &quot; Chhean said , &quot; because we are busy doing our housework. &quot; On the Cover : Elder Mikael Black , left , and Elder Tony Henderson , 20-year-old Mormon missionaries from Utah , pray with Heng Heing in her home as they seek converts in Long_Beach ' s large Cambodian immigrant community .
