   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAREERS ; WHERE THE JOBS ARE ; SEEKING REAL_ESTATE GOLD ? TRY PROPERTY MANAGEMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the housing market was white-hot in the 1980s , more_than 3 # 000 Californians a month took_out a salesperson ' s license in the hope of making a killing by selling real_estate . Even some part-timers earned more_than $ 50 # 000 a year in_commissions , until the market went bust and the recession took_hold . Now , the economy is back on the mend and the realty market is pulling_out of its long slump . If you ' re thinking of pursuing a real_estate career , this could be an ideal time to do_it -- as long as you don ' t expect to start making a lot of money overnight . &quot; This is a great time to get_into the industry , because things are slowly getting better and you ' ll have some time to build a foundation before the business really takes_off , &quot; said Pat Neal , an Orange County broker and president of the California Assn . of Realtors . &quot; But if you think that working in real_estate is an easy way to make a fast buck , forget it . The ' easy_money ' days are long gone. &quot; Indeed , most realtors say that new salespeople trying to break_into today ' s tepid market are lucky if they make $ 15 # 000 a year . Experienced California agents with a long list of &quot; repeat &quot; customers average about $ 55 # 000 , according to the National Assn . of Realtors . In fact , Neal and other experts say , the hottest real_estate jobs and most opportunities are no longer in sales : They ' re in property management . With vacancies high and inflation low , owners need help in wringing every_last cent of profit out of their buildings . True , dealing with tenants and making_sure an office or apartment complex is in good_shape may_not sound like much fun . But it does offer a steady paycheck -- unlike a job as a commissioned salesperson -- and much more room for career advancement . As with any industry , pay scales vary widely . An entry-level position that involves dealing with tenants and supervising maintenance workers at several small buildings pays between $ 25 # 000 and $ 35 # 000 a year , said Bob Sullivan of Sullivan-Dituri Real_Estate , which manages about 2 # 500 rental units in West Los Angeles and Santa Monica . If you have some experience and a degree in business or a related field , you could earn more_than $ 50 # 000 a year by working as an account manager for a big firm , where you ' d be responsible_for the cash-flow analysis and supervision of a large portfolio of properties . There ' s even bigger money at the top . Sullivan said the heads of many big property-management firms or supervisors of large office complexes earn more_than $ 100 # 000 a year -- and many got their start by managing a small apartment_building or shopping_center . Although a college degree will be helpful if you ' re looking_for a white-collar job with a large property management firm , many smaller companies and most real_estate sales offices aren ' t as demanding . As an alternative to getting a four-year degree , many newcomers instead simply take a_few courses in their chosen real_estate field at a community_college . Local chapters of trade associations , such_as the nonprofit Institute of Real_Estate Management , also offer inexpensive programs . Not all property managers work full-time . Many are apartment-dwellers who simply do some light maintenance work around their building and show vacant units to prospective tenants for a_few hundreds dollars a month , or for a reduction in their rent . Others are homeowners who ' ve agreed to handle the leasing duties for neighbors or co-workers who ' ve been transferred , but have decided to rent out their house instead of sell it . Their typical fee : Between $ 100 and $ 500 to screen tenants and handle all_the paperwork , plus $ 100 to $ 300 a month for supervision and collecting the rent . &quot; There are a lot of ( free-lance ) jobs for people who want to specialize in managing houses or small apartments , because they ' re just too small for most management firms to mess with , &quot; said David Gribin , co-owner of Citiscape Property Services in Encino . &quot; If you can manage four or five houses in your spare_time , you can make $ 1 # 000 or $ 1 # 500 a month . Plus , you ' ll get a feel_for what the property-management business is all about and then you can decide if you ' d like to make_it a career. &quot; If you ' re serious about getting any type of job in the real_estate industry , experts say you should start by obtaining a salesperson ' s license . In California , that requires taking 45 hours of training in real_estate fundamentals at a private_school or college and then passing a three-hour exam administered by the state_department of real_estate . &quot; Even if you ' re not going_into sales , you ' re going to need a license if you ' re handling contracts or money , &quot; said property manager Sullivan . &quot; Besides , the stuff you learn in real_estate school is useful , even if you never go_into the business. &quot; Sluggish sales and rising mortgage rates have dimmed the short-term prospects for two other key jobs in the industry -- mortgage brokers and real_estate appraisers . Professionals in those fields can enjoy six-figure incomes when the market ' s hot , but their earnings plunge when activity cools .</TEXT>
