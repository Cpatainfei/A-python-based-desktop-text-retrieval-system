   <HEADLINE> AMID SERB STRIKES , U.N. FORCE SEEKS A RECAST BOSNIA ROLE ; BALKANS : BROADEN PEACEKEEPERS ' POWERS OR PULL_OUT ALTOGETHER , OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY URGE . REBELS STEP UP GORAZDE POUNDING , AND A BRITISH JET IS SHOT DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Humiliated by Serbian rebels who have attacked Bosnian civilians and U.N. troops with impunity , officials of the U.N. Protection Force on Saturday proclaimed their mission &quot; meaningless &quot; if the Serbs ' aggression continues , and sources said they are considering pulling_out of the Balkans . After U.N. officials were unable to halt another Serbian onslaught against the besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde , the civilian chief of the peacekeeping force reluctantly authorized punitive air strikes . One of two British jets answering the call_for air strikes was shot down , and no Serbian targets were attacked . But the mission chief , Yasushi Akashi of Japan , also announced that he is appealing_to his U.N. superiors for urgent reconsideration of the entire mission . Since NATO staged a limited bombing raid against Serbian heavy artillery attacking Gorazde last week , angry rebels have overrun much of the U.N.-designated safe area , fired on U.N. aircraft and soldiers , taken peacekeepers captive and expelled Western journalists . On Saturday , a surface-to-air_missile fired by Serbian nationalist forces near Gorazde downed a British Sea Harrier carrying_out a search-and-destroy mission against Serbian tank units , reported Maj . Rob Annink , the U.N. spokesman for Bosnia . The pilot ejected safely into Bosnian government-held territory , but the attack on the plane highlighted the recent harassment and menacing of U.N. peacekeepers deployed to Bosnia 21 months ago to assist in humanitarian relief . Later , U.N. officials claimed to have arranged a provisional cease-fire for all_of Bosnia on condition the Serbian rebels release all U.N. hostages and that the mission , in return , call_off NATO warplanes buzzing the Gorazde region . Western mediators and U.N. officials were expected to discuss the truce with the Serbs today . At least 200 U.N. soldiers have been taken captive by the Serbs in retaliation for last week ' s air strikes by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . Movements are restricted for the more_than 4 # 300 peacekeepers deployed in Sarajevo , and attacks on U.N. personnel have skyrocketed . The British jet downed Saturday was from the_British Royal Navy carrier Ark Royal on patrol in the Adriatic_Sea , a NATO official in Brussels said . It was reportedly one of two planes from the ship responding to a U.N. request to attack Serbian forces besieging Gorazde late Saturday afternoon . &quot; The two aircraft were attempting to conduct a close air support mission ( and had targeted ) a tank reported to have been firing directly into Gorazde , &quot; said a statement issued by NATO ' s Southern Command headquarters in Naples , Italy . NATO officials in Brussels said one of the Sea Harriers was hit near the target_area and that the pilot managed to eject safely . He was reportedly rescued by helicopter and returned to the Ark Royal without serious injuries . &quot; He suffered only minor scratches , &quot; a NATO official said in Brussels . The NATO statement noted that neither plane actually fired at the tank . Earlier Saturday , a U.N. plane carrying the mission commander , French Gen . Bertrand de Lapresle , was hit by three shots as it landed at Sarajevo ' s airport . A French reconnaissance aircraft was also damaged by gunfire a day earlier when it flew over Serb-held positions near Gorazde . The deliberate targeting of U.N. aircraft prompted suspension of U.N. air traffic and closure of Sarajevo ' s airport , which already had been closed to relief flights as a security precaution . Near Gorazde a day earlier , a British special forces officer was killed and another wounded when the rebels fired on their clearly marked observation vehicle with artillery and small-arms fire . At the end of a particularly devastating day for the U.N. mission , Akashi announced Saturday night that &quot; unless there was serious and manifest intention by the Bosnian Serb army , supported by clear action and cooperation on the ground , it would be meaningless in the present circumstances for UNPROFOR to continue to fulfill its present activities. &quot; The U.N. mission chief said he was &quot; urgently reviewing the future role and status &quot; of the peacekeeping mission with U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and that the two would soon approach the Security_Council for new orders . U.N. sources said the officials would appeal_to the Security_Council to either empower the mission to use force to protect its troops and endangered civilians or to pull it out altogether . One source close to the mission command said officials were leaning toward a complete pullout of the 33 # 000 troops deployed throughout the Balkans . The U.N. commander for Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , denounced the situation as &quot; untenable &quot; after Serbian gunmen killed the_British military observer near Gorazde on Friday . Rose ' s appeal_to Akashi to order air strikes then was turned_down . The current mission mandate charges the U.N. soldiers in Bosnia with little more_than escorting relief goods . Some peacekeeping duties have been added with the designation of six U.N.-protected safe areas , including Sarajevo . But the 13 # 000 soldiers deployed to Bosnia are authorized to use weapons only in self-defense , which has prevented them from offering more_than symbolic protection of embattled Bosnian civilians in the face of heavily armed Serbs . Akashi conceded that the U.N. mission is incapable of fully defending Gorazde , saying too few troops are at Rose ' s disposal and that U.N. officers are unclear just what parts of the safe area they are obliged to protect . U.N. officials have privately accused Akashi of stubbornly pursuing a failed course of diplomacy with the Serbs , who have dragged_out peace talks for nearly two years . Even Russia ' s special envoy to the Balkans , Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin , conceded that the prospects for a peaceful solution looked bleak . &quot; It isn ' t going very well , &quot; Churkin told the Yugoslav news_agency Tanjug after a weeklong endeavor to bring angry Serbs and the Muslim-led government back to the negotiating table . On Saturday , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev flew to Belgrade for emergency talks with Serbian officials . Buoyed by the international community ' s reluctance to use force , the Serbian rebels have challenged U.N. troops to give_up on their mission . The deputy military chief , Gen . Milan Gvero , insisted that Rose be replaced before his rebels would consider resuming negotiations . Bosnian government leaders have warned that U.N. timidity has emboldened the Serbs to further aggression and scuttled any hopes of a negotiated solution . &quot; How can you talk to the Serbs now , when they think they have defeated all_of NATO ? &quot; asked Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic . Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic boasted that Gorazde would be captured Saturday , a Belgrade radio_station reported . His headquarters had called_for Gorazde ' s surrender a day earlier . The crisis within the peacekeeping mission has unfolded in tandem with the deadly Serbian assault on Gorazde , which government officials warn is_on the verge of falling . Serbian rebels now hold all_of the high ground around the city and have inflicted terror and bedlam with incessant firing into densely populated suburbs and city apartment blocks . At least 240 people have been killed since the offensive began March 30 , said Kris Janowski , spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees . The refugee agency said that it has no contingency plan for evacuating Gorazde ' s 65 # 000 residents and refugees because the enclave is surrounded by hostile Serbian territory and no other area of Bosnia is prepared to accommodate such an influx . &quot; I do hope some sort of cease-fire can be worked_out , because the fall of Gorazde , which is packed with refugees , would cause a humanitarian disaster , most likely with tens of thousands of people fleeing in disarray , &quot; Janowski said . While Rose and other U.N. military officials have contended throughout the Serbian advance on Gorazde that the rebels are unlikely to conquer the enclave , those outside the doomed mission fear that the Serbs have every intention of applying their brutal policy of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; to the area supposedly under U.N. protection . Gorazde , Zepa , Srebrenica and Bihac -- all U.N.-designated safe areas -- are besieged pockets of Muslim communities surrounded by Serb-held territory . &quot; I think the Serbs ' long-term strategy is obviously to sweep the enclaves , &quot; one U.N. official said . &quot; They are not interested in having these little ulcers here and there . . . . Gorazde will be a test_case . If it falls , the others will follow quickly. &quot; More_than 2 million people have already been displaced and more_than 200 # 000 are dead or missing since Serbian nationalists rebelled against Bosnia ' s March , 1992 , vote for independence from Yugoslavia .
