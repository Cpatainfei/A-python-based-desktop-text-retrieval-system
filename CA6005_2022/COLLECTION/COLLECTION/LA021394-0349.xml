   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; AMID THE ICE AND SNOW , SPIRIT BURNS ; OPENING : A TIMELESS SIMPLICITY MARKS THE BEGINNING OF A SPECIAL WINTER FESTIVAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four hundred twenty-five miles from the Arctic_Circle , the XVII Winter_Olympics began here Saturday with reindeer-drawn sleighs , fiddlers on the hoof and fanfare from rams ' horns , all on a far-as-the-eye-can-see fleece of snow . Let the giant Viking games begin . His Majesty King Harald V of Norway , royalty in a parka , made the formal announcement , &quot; I hereby declare opened the 17th Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer , &quot; after which his 20-year-old son , His Royal Highness Crown_Prince Haakon , put the torch to the Olympic flame . They are the descendants of King Olav V , a competitive skier and Olympic sailor himself before his death in 1991 . In these , the winter carnivals that have introduced worldwide audiences to athletes as eclectic as Sonja Henie and Tonya Harding , as electric as the 1980 U.S. hockey_team , as glamorous as Alberto Tomba and Prince Albert of Monaco , as triumphant as Rosi Mittermaier and Eric Heiden and as eccentric as a bobsled crew from Jamaica and a blind-as-a-bat ski_jumper who called himself Eddie the Eagle , rarely has a setting seemed so natural and traditional as this . Here , where by legend two skiers in 1206 carried the original Prince Haakon to safety from enemies of the crown , children have been known to ski before they can walk . The town of Lillehammer , population 23 # 000 , pictures a skier on its coat of arms , something seen in no other city in the world . Although adventurous Norwegians have journeyed by land and by sea -- among them the actress Liv Ullmann and the explorer Thor Heyerdahl , who served as emcees of Saturday ' s opening ceremonies -- and have excelled_at other games , as did the Norway-born football legend Knute Rockne of Notre Dame , this is a nation of skiers and skaters , of children whose first sleds mean as much to them as one did to the fictional Charles Foster Kane . Twanging mouth_harps and melodic violins were played by musicians of all ages who entered the Lysgardsbakkene ski-jump arena aboard wagon , sled and horseback , some on dainty &quot; Dela &quot; horses the size of Shetland_ponies , bays with white manes and tails , so colorful that they looked_like carousels come_to_life . Children garbed in Viking regalia danced around grandfatherly men who played willow flutes , ram-horn trumpets and lures , ancient bugles made from birch-tree bark . The ceremony was far less avant-garde than the one staged two years ago in Albertville , France , where women crouched inside crystal-like globes and men swung from bungee_cords or swayed atop 50-foot stilts . For these Winter_Olympics , the first ones to follow so closely on the heels of another , the kickoff pageant featured woodland creatures and characters from fables , with few things so modern that they couldn ' t have been seen in the 1952 opening ceremony at Oslo , 110 miles away . What newness there was Saturday came_in an appeal for peace in the former Olympic host city of Sarajevo by the president of the International Olympic Committee , Juan Antonio Samaranch , followed by a minute of silence for the embattled citizenry there . Parachutists delivered the national_flag and skiers the flame , one of them an eleventh-hour replacement for a ski_jumper originally assigned to advance the torch , whose crackup during rehearsal will make him as famous here as the opening credits of American TV ' s &quot; Wide World of Sports &quot; made famous another unlucky ski_jumper many years ago . Many of the athletes , too , were new , although familiar faces abounded . Mingling with the many experienced Olympians in the parade of nations were such newcomers as Michael Shmerkin , a figure skater who is about to become Israel ' s first Winter Olympian , and fellow skater Dino Quattrocecere , who , though born in Virginia , will represent South_Africa as its first participant in these games in 34 years . New flags galore flew before republics from the former Soviet_Union , while athletes such_as Carolina Photiades , a skier from Cyprus , walked alone , flag in_hand , a one-man Olympic band . At times spectators did need a program to tell which nation was which , as when several athletes marched into the stadium behind a banner identifying them as being from the nation of JOMFRUOYENE . This was , as it turned_out , the Norwegian version of Virgin Islands . DEN TSJEKKISKE REPUBLIKK was the Czech half of the former Czechoslovakia , TYSKLAND stood_for Germany , STORBRITANNIA for Great Britain and , near the beginning of the alphabetical parade , strode the mighty team of the AMERIKAS FORENTE STATER , 157 cowboy-hatted athletes representing the United States . Oh , for the curious , Canada was CANADA and Mexico was MEXICO . The words that rang_out in the Norwegian night , however , were these , spoken by Liv Ullmann to the thousands in_attendance and the millions listening worldwide : &quot; Tap og vinn med samme sinn , &quot; she said . &quot; Lose and win with the same attitude. &quot; It was something to embrace , something for everyone to carry with them or wrap around them , for now or for later , while sitting here on top of the world .</TEXT>
