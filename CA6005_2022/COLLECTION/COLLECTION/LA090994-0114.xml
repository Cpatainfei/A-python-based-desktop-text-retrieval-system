   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR ; ' ONE STRIKE ' RAPE BILL IS SIGNED BY WILSON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson came_to Los Angeles on Thursday and signed what he called the toughest rape law in the nation : the so-called one strike bill , which requires up_to life in prison for first-time violent sex offenders . Wilson deliberately staged the signing of the bill in the largest media market in the state , and the campaign-like nature of the event -- held_on a rooftop at the Los Angeles Police_Department headquarters in Van Nuys in the presence of nine television_cameras -- prompted immediate criticism from his November election opponent , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown . &quot; This is a made-for-TV governor ' s event -- nothing more_than a campaign event paid_for at public expense , &quot; said John Whitehurst , Brown ' s campaign spokesman , who attended Wilson ' s lengthy news_conference armed with news releases that said Wilson had backed_down to Brown on the &quot; one strike &quot; issue . Wilson termed the Brown campaign ' s criticism &quot; a pathetic postscript &quot; to a historic day . By following_through on his promise to sign the &quot; one strike &quot; bill , he said , he was slamming the prison doors shut , converting career criminals to career inmates . &quot; The revolving door has stopped revolving , &quot; said the Republican incumbent . &quot; If you commit aggravated rape or child molestation , you are going_to go_away for a very long time. &quot; Boosters of the new law , authored by state Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) , say the long sentences should deter some violent rapists and child_molesters from continuing to commit sex crimes and put those who persist behind bars before they harm multiple victims . But civil libertarians and defense_attorneys contend it will have little or no deterrent effect , and they worry that stiff penalties could be applied in cases where they are not warranted . Thursday was not the first time that sex crimes have dominated the gubernatorial debate . Wilson has aired a television commercial charging that Brown was opposed to the &quot; one strike &quot; bill . Brown called Wilson ' s ad a &quot; despicable lie , &quot; arguing that she supported an amended version of the bill . The original &quot; one strike &quot; bill by state Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) would have required that nearly all sex offenders be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole . Although it was praised by Wilson , the measure was widely attacked for being so harsh that it might hinder prosecutions or prompt rapists to kill their victims . The bill that Wilson signed Thursday calls_for a penalty of 25 years to life for sexual_assaults involving torture , mayhem , kidnaping or burglary with the intent to commit rape . Lesser sex crimes could bring sentences of 15 years to life but would have to include special circumstances such_as the use of a firearm . &quot; If I had my way , we would have LWOP -- life without possibility of parole , &quot; Wilson said Thursday , directing many of his remarks to two women who sat nearby . Wilson said the women , each a survivor of a sexual_assault , had helped educate legislators about the need for tougher sentencing . Wilson also praised Bergeson , saying her efforts to pass the bill were so impressive that &quot; maybe we should retire her jersey. &quot; Bergeson , meanwhile , called the law &quot; the most important bill to get_through the Legislature this year &quot; and praised the efforts of victims who came_to Sacramento to testify on behalf of the measure , saying &quot; they made the difference. &quot; &quot; This bill will remove those predators from our streets , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; Women and children will feel safer. &quot; An analysis by the state_Department of Corrections has determined that the new law , which goes_into effect Nov . 30 , will have a marginal initial impact on the state ' s prison population because most repeat sex offenders would already be covered by the state ' s &quot; three strikes &quot; law . By 1998 , the &quot; one strike &quot; law is expected to add 11 inmates to the state_prison system above and beyond those imprisoned under the &quot; three strikes &quot; law . But the &quot; one strike &quot; law ' s effect would increase dramatically in the years that followed . By 2025 , the number would have grown to 2 # 026 additional inmates , requiring more_than $ 157 million for prison construction and another $ 42 million each year in operating_costs .
