   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ; ECONOMISTS REVISE THEIR RATTLED OUTLOOK ; RECOVERY : A GROWING NUMBER SAY STATE RECESSION WILL END BY EARLY NEXT YEAR , DESPITE PREVIOUS GLOOM OVER QUAKE IMPACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the full economic impact of the Northridge earthquake comes slowly into focus , a small but growing number of economists say the temblor will not delay the Southland ' s long-awaited recovery for very long and are renewing their forecasts that the regional recession will be over by the start of next year . Earlier predictions that the Jan . 17 quake would keep Southern California mired in recession well into 1995 are being replaced by more upbeat forecasts that the temblor may delay the recovery by only a month or two . Some forecasts say the economy will turn_around as early as this fall . Economists credit their new optimism to a variety of factors , including the quick repair of the region ' s telecommunications network and a relatively fast and effective response by disaster relief agencies . The full-scale meltdown of the transportation_system that some analysts said was imminent never materialized , so most merchants and manufacturers are having little trouble getting the goods and materials needed to stay in business . &quot; At worst , I think the quake might push_back Southern California ' s recovery by 60 days , maybe even less , &quot; Jack Kyser , chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. , said Thursday at a breakfast meeting of downtown executives . * &quot; The score right now is Optimists 1 , Doomsayers , &quot; he said . &quot; The recovery should still arrive by the end of the year. &quot; Although Kyser initially worried that the businesses that were closed by the quake could raise the region ' s unemployment_rate , he now believes the rebuilding effort could create more jobs than the temblor cost . For example , before the quake , Kyser predicted that employment in the construction_industry would be flat this year . But now he says the rebuilding effort should create 10 # 000 construction jobs , plus nearly 20 # 000 others in related industries such_as engineering and furniture making . &quot; If there are any silver_linings in the clouds , this is one of them , &quot; Kyser said . Analysts at Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bank are also more confident about the future of the Southland economy than they were immediately after the quake . &quot; Initially , I thought the improvements we were seeing ( before the temblor ) were so fragile that the quake was going_to push our recovery back farther into next year , &quot; said Adrian Sanchez , the bank ' s regional economist . &quot; But L.A. bounced_back quickly , and there ' s a lot of insurance money and federal help on the way . So I ' m sticking_to my original forecast : Southern California will be in recovery by early ' 95. &quot; With the region ' s infrastructure on the mend , most economists now are more concerned about tourism than transportation . The quake is expected to cost about 9 # 000 tourism jobs , according to Pannell Kerr Forster , an industry consultant . But most of those jobs have already disappeared , said PKF director Bruce Baltin , and Los Angeles ' $ 20-billion-a-year tourism industry should return to normal by the end of May . Officials at the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau say the industry could rebound even sooner if no more major aftershocks hit . &quot; Every time there ' s a big aftershock , the networks show it on the nightly news , and it erodes visitors ' confidence in our city , &quot; said Gary Sherwin , the bureau ' s spokesman . &quot; People see a collapsed apartment in Northridge and they think all_of Southern California looks_like that. &quot; Even assuming the best about the earthquake , California ' s economy is hardly out of the woods . Standard &amp; Poor ' s Corp . on Thursday changed its long-term outlook on the state to &quot; negative &quot; from &quot; stable , &quot; citing dwindling funds and budget_deficits . Although S &amp; P did not mention last month ' s quake , California officials have said the disaster caused $ 13 billion to $ 20 billion in damage , making_it the second-worst natural disaster in U.S. history . The credit agency said that , with economic recovery in the state now expected to slip to late 1994 or early 1995 , balancing the state ' s 1995 budget will be difficult . S &amp; P said California faces pressures from school , welfare and prison needs . The recovery has been hampered by the loss of 868 # 000 jobs , or 7 % of the work_force , since 1990 . Half those were in defense and 40 % were in construction , S &amp; P said .</TEXT>
