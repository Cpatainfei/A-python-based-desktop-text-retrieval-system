   <HEADLINE> DO NOT OPEN ' TIL , ER , NOVEMBER ; CRUSH OF NEW , STARRY FILMS FORCE STUDIOS TO LAUNCH CHRISTMAS FARE EARLIER . THE HOPE : BEST YEAR ' S TOTAL EVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are a full 89 shopping days left until Christmas but for the motion_picture industry , the holidays officially kick_off in a little more_than a month . The opening salvos are &quot; Mary Shelley ' s Frankenstein &quot; from TriStar Pictures , starring Robert De Niro , and Universal Pictures ' coming-of-age drama &quot; The War , &quot; pairing Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner . Both films debut Nov . 4 . Wait a second . Isn ' t that rushing things a bit ? Not as far as MCA / Universal motion_picture group chairman Tom Pollock is concerned . When he went_to one of the better department_stores last weekend , Christmas decorations were already up . If retailers continue to move the season up earlier and earlier , he contends , there ' s no reason why the movie business can ' t do_it too . Besides , points_out Disney marketing president Robert Levin , the holiday season is a bit of a misnomer . Unlike summer , which witnesses a consistent attendance expansion from Memorial_Day through Labor_Day , the end of the year holiday window delivers a business rush only in fits and starts : for about five days around Thanksgiving and another week between Christmas and New Year ' s Day . It makes_sense then , he says , to get as_many playing days for such films as his studio ' s &quot; The Santa Clause , &quot; starring Tim Allen , and 20th Century Fox ' s remake of &quot; Miracle on 34th Street. &quot; Both will be out prior to Thanksgiving because Christmas-themed movies usually peter_out after the calendar celebration of the holiday . However , many of the coming season ' s significant early releases won ' t be Yuletide titles . &quot; Frankenstein &quot; will make haste to get established with audiences a week before the arrival of another florid monster movie , the much ballyhooed &quot; Interview With the Vampire &quot; starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt . The Samuel Goldwyn Company will open David Mamet ' s sexual_harassment drama &quot; Oleanna &quot; nationally on Nov . 11 to get some attention before another similarly themed film , &quot; Disclosure , &quot; starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore , arrives in December . The largely animated &quot; The Pagemaster &quot; debuts Nov . 11 , a week before New Line ' s animated &quot; The Swan Princess. &quot; ( &quot; Pagemaster &quot; features super-tyke Macaulay Culkin who also stars in Warner Bros. ' December release &quot; Richie Rich. &quot; ) Other early-in-the-season &quot; big gun &quot; titles include Paramount ' s &quot; Star Trek : Generations , &quot; Disney ' s re-release of &quot; The Lion King &quot; and Universal ' s Arnold Schwarzenegger-Danny DeVito comedy &quot; Junior. &quot; &quot; There is so_much new movie product this season that the so-called Christmas season has grown to accommodate the crush of new films , &quot; says Howard Lichtman , spokesman for the Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon theater chain . If the front-loading strategy of releasing so many films so early works , says Tom Boris of box-office tracking firm Entertainment Data Inc. , those films could raise the overall attendance level through to the end of the year . If it doesn ' t , there will be the inevitable back-to-the-drawing-board re-evaluation . Still , exhibitors are buoyed by this steady flow of releases -- about 35 films in all -- observing that as_many as a dozen have the potential to gross from $ 50 million to more_than $ 100 million . The line-up of commercially viable product for the holidays is as strong as it ' s ever been , according to Fox ' s distribution chief Tom Sherak , whereas last year was largely dominated by the family films &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; and &quot; Aladdin. &quot; A strong holiday season could ensure the shattering of 1993 ' s box-office record tally of $ 5.2 billion . Through the end of this past summer , business was almost 5 % ahead of last year . And it ' s shaping_up to be a better than average fall , say exhibitors and distributors . With more playing days for the &quot; big gun &quot; holiday titles , industry executives are hoping this year ' s increase in ticket sales will continue unabated , making 1994 the best performer ever . Of course , as with every year &quot; you better have the goods , or you should get_out of the kitchen , &quot; cautions Sherak about the upcoming holiday slate . And there will undoubtedly be some last-minute defections . New Line Pictures , however , has made a last-minute addition to the season with the Jim Carrey comedy &quot; Dumb and Dumber. &quot; Originally scheduled for release in 1995 , the company took the plunge at the behest of exhibitors . &quot; The trailer was playing gangbusters , &quot; says Chris Pula , head of marketing at New Line , which also released Carrey ' s $ 100-million-plus comedy hit &quot; The Mask. &quot; The company ' s distribution chief , Al Shapiro , began receiving phone_calls from theater chains asking him to move_up the date since there was no broad-based comedy appealing_to the young male demographic at Christmas . &quot; Dumb and Dumber &quot; debuts Dec . 16 ; Jean-Claude Van Damme ' s action film &quot; Streetfighter &quot; is its main competition . For more sophisticated laughs there ' s Nora Ephron ' s &quot; Lifesavers , &quot; starring Steve Martin , and two romantic comedies : Paramount ' s &quot; I.Q. , &quot; teaming Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins , and MGM / UA ' s &quot; Speechless , &quot; starring Michael Keaton and Geena Davis . The latter could benefit from comparisons to the real-life political romance between James Carville and Mary Matalin . More adult-oriented fare usually waits until Christmas_Day to open , when its constituency becomes available . But , observes MGM / UA marketing head Gerry Rich , this year Christmas falls on a Sunday , robbing the industry of one holiday weekend ( Christmas_Eve and most of Christmas_Day are normally box-office low points for moviegoing ) . That makes_it all_the more crucial to establish a film before the Christmas weekend . Hence , the stacking of releases on Dec . 16 and 23 . What seems to be missing this Christmas is the usual line-up of Oscar-worthy prestige movies . With the exception of Fox ' s drama &quot; Nell , &quot; starring Jodie Foster , and Warners ' baseball biography &quot; Cobb , &quot; starring Tommy Lee Jones , there don ' t seem to be any major studio releases on the order of last year ' s &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; &quot; Remains of the Day &quot; and &quot; In the Name of the Father. &quot; It ' s just the luck of the draw , say industry nabobs . Such directors as Steven Spielberg , Martin Scorsese , Jonathan Demme and Jim Sheridan , who can be counted_on to deliver potential Oscar offerings , didn ' t make a film this year . Others like Barry Levinson and Neil Jordan ( &quot; The Crying Game &quot; ) have tackled more overtly commercial projects , &quot; Disclosure &quot; and &quot; Vampire , &quot; respectively . There will be several independently-made Oscar hopefuls , including Roman Polanski ' s drama &quot; Death and the Maiden , &quot; starring Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver , Robert Altman ' s fashion satire &quot; Pret-a-Porter , &quot; with an all-star ensemble cast , the inter-generational saga &quot; The Perez Family , &quot; with Anjelica Huston and Marisa Tomei , and &quot; Mrs . Parker &quot; with Jennifer Jason-Leigh in the title_role as writer Dorothy Parker . Barring last-minute surprises , many of the stronger best picture hopefuls may already have been released , suggest insiders -- Disney ' s &quot; Quiz Show &quot; and &quot; The Lion King , &quot; Paramount ' s &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; and Gramercy ' s &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral. &quot; Fox is a Times staff writer and Natale is a free-lance writer and frequent contributor to Calendar .</TEXT>
