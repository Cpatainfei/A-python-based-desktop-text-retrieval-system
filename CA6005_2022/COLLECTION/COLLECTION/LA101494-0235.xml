   <HEADLINE> IRAQI RETREAT HALTED ; U.S. WON ' T CUT FORCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iraqi forces abruptly halted their retreat back to Baghdad on Thursday , and U.S. officials responded immediately by suspending a plan to scale back American military deployments to the region . The Iraqi move startled U.S. defense officials , who hours earlier had announced that the United States was slowing its flow of forces to the region and were even talking_about returning troops from Kuwait to the United States &quot; within weeks. &quot; As night fell , it was unclear whether the pause in the Iraqi withdrawal was merely a logistic foul-up or the beginning of a serious military challenge to the United States and its allies . In Baghdad , in Washington and at the United Nations on Thursday there were rapid-fire diplomatic developments that promised some progress toward an easing of the Persian_Gulf crisis , while raising the likelihood of a substantial long-term American military presence in the area . Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein , after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev , announced on state television that he would recognize Kuwait ' s sovereignty and its borders . Such recognition is one of the key requirements Baghdad must meet before the United Nations will consider lifting harsh economic sanctions imposed in the aftermath of the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War . However , U.S. officials all but dismissed Hussein ' s announcement as a propaganda ploy . &quot; We are skeptical because of all_the broken promises in the past , &quot; a U.S. diplomat said . In Washington , a senior official said the Clinton_Administration is seeking U.N. Security_Council approval of a resolution to bar threatening Iraqi troop movements in the southern part of the country . The Administration will station air and possibly ground forces in the region indefinitely to enforce the prohibition , the official said . The United States is prepared to use force &quot; unilaterally &quot; to prevent or punish any Iraqi moves that Washington considers hostile to Baghdad ' s neighbors or a threat to international peace , the official added . And at the United Nations , U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright excoriated the_French defense minister for accusing the United States of exaggerating the Iraqi threat for domestic political reasons , even as she sought the approval of France and other Security_Council members for the Iraq resolution . The most dramatic news of the day was the disclosure by officials in Washington and in Saudi_Arabia traveling with Defense_Secretary William J . Perry that the withdrawal of the Al Nida division of Iraq ' s elite Republican Guard had come_to a halt . An estimated 10 # 000 troops of the armored division took_up defensive positions near the city of Nasiriyah , about 120 miles northwest of the Kuwaiti border and well south of the line that U.S. officials consider the minimum safe distance from Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia . An official with Perry ' s delegation said that while Hussein may be testing U.S. intentions in deploying troops to the Middle_East , the action will actually bolster American aims . &quot; It looks as if this may be another test of our resolve by Saddam , which I am sure we will pass with flying colors , &quot; he said . Senior Pentagon officials , clearly concerned about the development , immediately suspended the plan to scale back U.S. deployments , saying that they want to watch the situation for at least another 24 hours before deciding how to respond . &quot; What I can tell you is ( that ) we don ' t like what we ' re seeing , &quot; said a key Pentagon official involved in the operation , who briefed reporters Thursday evening . &quot; They are clearly south of where we would like them to be. &quot; Pentagon officials who described the Iraqi turnabout on Thursday said that the move came as a surprise to U.S. intelligence_officers , who had previously believed that the Republican Guard division in_question was proceeding all_the way back to its home base of Mosul in northern Iraq . But instead , an official said , the unit abruptly halted near Nasiriyah and proceeded to dig_in , at least partly , in an apparently defensive position . Some units that should have gone_to other locations have not and others remain &quot; unlocated , &quot; he said . Early in the day , the Pentagon announced that , in_view of Iraq ' s rapid withdrawal from the Kuwaiti border so far , it was delaying the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops and aircraft , including the 18 # 000-member 1st Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Pendleton . &quot; I ' m pleased to say that Iraq heard our message . Its forces have begun a broad retreat from the border area , &quot; President Clinton told a group of radio and television_news directors in Los Angeles in a speech beamed via satellite from the White_House . Moments later , National Security Adviser Anthony Lake informed Clinton that the Iraqi retreat apparently had halted , and the President made no further comment on developments in the Middle_East . The surprise move by the Iraqi unit raised fears by some analysts that their worst nightmare may be coming true -- that Hussein might play cat-and-mouse with U.S. troops , forcing Washington to react continually and keep troops in the area for months . Indeed , a senior Administration official late Thursday said that Washington is prepared to maintain a large contingent of warplanes and possibly ground troops in the Persian_Gulf indefinitely to keep Iraqi forces in check . The Iraqi turnabout also cast doubt on an earlier statement by Perry , who told reporters in Jidda that Washington will probably limit the number of troops it sends to the region to 30 # 000 , rather than the 40 # 000 cited last week . Perry met for 90 minutes with King Fahd at the Royal Palace here , and they discussed joint commitments in turning_back the Iraqi threat . The senior defense official said that the king endorsed the expansion of the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone in southern Iraq to include a &quot; no-drive &quot; zone for Iraqi tanks as well , a plan that has been rejected by Russia and France . But in Washington and New York , U.S. officials were outlining a plan to force the full withdrawal of the Republican Guard and limit future Iraqi troop movements in the southern part of the country . A White_House official , who briefed reporters on condition that he not be named , said the Administration believes that it has sufficient authority under existing U.N. resolutions to respond on its own to Iraqi military moves . &quot; We have the authority now to act_as we see fit , &quot; the official said . &quot; In the future , we will act unilaterally if we have to. &quot; The means of enforcing the resolution do not appear in the draft of the resolution , but officials made clear that the primary tool to be used to contain Hussein is American air_power . Even after the current crisis eases , the United States will station more_than 100 attack and fighter_aircraft at bases in Saudi_Arabia , Kuwait and elsewhere in the region , officials said . But , the official added , the Administration hopes that new international restraints on Hussein ' s behavior will lead to a permanent end to his adventurism . &quot; It ' s certainly not our intention to tie_down unnecessary ground forces or even air_power there , &quot; the official said . The official said that the American proposal goes beyond requiring Hussein to remove his Republican Guard units from the Kuwait border area . While the current American_plan would allow Hussein to maintain the 50 # 000 regular_army troops now stationed in southern Iraq , they would not be allowed to carry_out any maneuvers that appeared to threaten Kuwait , Saudi_Arabia or any other nation in the region . The proposed resolution would also prohibit any Iraqi actions that interfered with the functioning of a U.N. team monitoring the dismantling of Iraq ' s weapons of mass destruction . At the United Nations , Albright delivered a decidedly undiplomatic tongue-lashing to French Defense Minister Francois Leotard . Clearly annoyed by Leotard ' s charge in Paris on Wednesday that domestic politics powered Clinton ' s policies on Iraq , Albright derided his remarks as &quot; ludicrous , &quot; &quot; uncalled-for &quot; and &quot; counterproductive. &quot; &quot; While we ' re talking_about politics , &quot; she said , &quot; there are countries that have commercial interests with Iraq , and I think that one ought to look_into that and consider reactions in that guise. &quot; Despite this squabble , Albright insisted that the five countries with a Security_Council veto -- the United States , France , Britain , Russia and China -- are close to agreement on a proposed resolution designed to pressure Hussein into not moving his forces in a provocative manner toward Kuwait again . Serrano reported from Saudi_Arabia and Broder from Washington . Times staff writers Art Pine in Washington and Stanley Meisler at the United Nations contributed to this report .</TEXT>
