   <HEADLINE> QUAKE AID FOR FILLMORE , SIMI CALLED SLOW ; RECOVERY : FEMA AND SBA ARE CRITICIZED BY SOME WHO SAY THEY ' VE BEEN WAITING MONTHS FOR HELP . BUT AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES SAY THEIR EFFICIENCY HAS BEEN PRAISED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly three months after the magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck a sleeping Southern California , federal emergency aid is reaching most Ventura County victims , disaster officials and aid recipients say . But some residents of Simi Valley and Fillmore -- the Ventura County communities hardest hit by the quake -- are still fighting with federal_officials for the aid they say they expected long ago . Simi Valley resident Mike Piper , for example , isn ' t sure which was more upsetting -- the earthquake that wreaked $ 60 # 000 worth of damage on his home , or the following weeks spent wrangling with federal disaster officials , trying to glimpse one penny of the emergency aid they promised him in late January . &quot; They said , ' You ' ve got_to understand , we ' ve got 400 # 000 of these cases , ' &quot; he said . &quot; I said , ' You ' ve got_to understand , I can ' t live_in my house. ' &quot; But representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency say the efficiency of their response and the friendly attitude of their employees have won them satisfied customers across Southern California . &quot; We have had people come_in here , bringing us candy and cakes , &quot; said Joe Garriga , FEMA ' s spokesman in Fillmore . &quot; When we take lunch breaks here , people see us with our IDs and they are very kind to us. &quot; Officials with the Small Business Administration , which works with FEMA in awarding emergency home and business loans , say they had processed more_than half their Ventura County home loan_applications and about one-eighth of the county ' s business loan_applications by April 5 . Diane Brady , a spokeswoman for the SBA , said the agency tries to process home loan_applications before dealing with business loans , figuring the home loans are a more immediate priority . Of the 7 # 556 home-loan applications filed with the SBA by Ventura County residents , 3 # 725 were processed and 2 # 660 loans were approved by April 5 . Of the 869 business-loan applications filed with the SBA by county residents , 112 had been processed and 65 loans were approved . FEMA figures are less precise . Officials say county residents have filed 7 # 723 applications for FEMA disaster aid since the Jan . 17 quake , and they estimate that most residents either receive their check or an explanation of why they are not eligible within three weeks of their application . Fillmore resident Irma Eyzaguirre said her grant check took two months to arrive , but she still has few complaints with FEMA . FEMA officials &quot; were very pleasant , &quot; she said . &quot; They reacted very quickly , I think , to the earthquake and to Fillmore. &quot; Eyzaguirre ' s house suffered only minor damage in the quake . The grant check she received was under $ 1 # 000 , or less than one-sixth the cost of the total damage . Still , she said , the grants are not meant to repair every crack , just make a house livable again . &quot; I had no problems , &quot; she said . &quot; Then again , if my house had crumpled to the ground , I probably would n ' t have wanted to wait that long. &quot; Not every applicant is satisfied with the wait or the service . Some residents and business owners say federal_officials have lost their case files . In some cases , officials have sent key documents from the same file to different cities in different parts of the state , making applications impossible to process . Some complain they were awarded money with so many conditions attached that they could make_out better at their local bank . &quot; From what I have heard from Bill_Clinton and ( U.S. secretary for Housing and Urban Development ) Henry Cisneros , they are taking their kudos far too early , &quot; Piper said . &quot; They are spending a lot of their time patting their backs in front of the public , when those of us in Southern California are hurting , and their system is hurting us. &quot; Piper ' s pain began at 4:31 a.m. on Jan . 17 . &quot; The rafters came_down through the ceiling like spears , &quot; he said . &quot; The toilet turned upside down . And then , of course , there was all_the standard cosmetic damage. &quot; Since then , his emergency relief case &quot; has been one of those Murphy ' s Law type things , &quot; said Rep . Elton Gallegly ( R-Simi Valley ) , whose office has worked with Piper , a former Simi Valley city councilman , to get Piper ' s paperwork straightened_out in the FEMA bureaucracy . At first , weeks went_by without a word from FEMA officials . So Piper started making phone_calls on the Small Business Administration loan for which he ' d applied . Turns_out , part of his aid request ended_up in Pasadena and part landed on a desk in Sacramento . Nothing further could be done until both portions arrived in the same place , officials told him . Calls from Gallegly ' s office and persistent requests from Piper eventually got the Pasadena package up_to Sacramento -- where an employee opened it only to find it empty . FEMA officials told Piper he had two choices : He could either wait two months or so for them to locate the missing materials , or he could resubmit his application . Piper put_in yet another call to his congressman . &quot; After being harassed by Elton ' s office , they suddenly did find my paperwork , &quot; said Piper , who on March 28 received a package from the SBA saying that he ' d been approved for a $ 45 # 000 loan . He ' s still waiting_on the SBA loan for his quake-impacted telephone_service business . SBA officials have lost his paperwork twice so far , he say . Officials say they will process his latest , faxed application within the next few weeks . Local officials say FEMA and SBA must be doing something right . Otherwise , local offices would be flooded with calls from irate quake victims . As it is , Gallegly ' s office and local city_halls have heard from some frustrated constituents . But many_more , officials say , seem to be quietly dealing with FEMA on_their_own . In all , officials at Gallegly ' s office say , they have dealt with about 245 problem cases from individuals around the county . About 100 of those cases are still pending , they say . &quot; The main problem I perceive , &quot; said Laura Herron , Simi Valley ' s deputy city_manager , who fields most of the city ' s FEMA problem calls , &quot; is people call_up to find_out the status of the application , and they ' re told it ' s pending , and that word pending is very vague. &quot; Jess and Deana Gonzales know all about pending . &quot; This is the longest 10 days I ' ve ever seen , &quot; Jess Gonzales grumbled nearly 2 1 / 2 months after his promised FEMA grant was supposed to arrive . Today , the Gonzaleses and their three toddlers live_in a sparsely furnished , rented condominium atop a hill in Fillmore . The stained plaid couch , the children ' s beds , the blond wood dining_room set -- -- all are donations from the Red_Cross . The clothes on their backs were also bought with Red_Cross money . Even the $ 995-per-month rent on the condo is subsidized by FEMA vouchers . All this because the earthquake rattled their rented house into a red-tagged shambles . And they couldn ' t get_at most of their clothes , or their furniture , and in fact their nerves were so rattled that Jess crashed his pickup later in the day . The resulting insurance money and the remainder of their savings went_into buying what they call &quot; the love boat &quot; -- a lemon_yellow , 1978 Oldsmobile Royale . &quot; We ' re more_than happy with what we ' ve gotten , &quot; Jess Gonzales said as the family ' s television , the only piece_of_furniture salvaged from their rented house , played a soap_opera in a corner of the family_room . Still , ever since Jess , who is disabled , and Deana , who is_on a leave_of_absence from her cashier ' s job , learned they might receive up_to $ 12 # 000 in grant money , they have counted_on the money to help them put their life back together . &quot; I feel kind of cheated , &quot; Jess Gonzales said . If the Gonzaleses feel cheated , Vernon Devitt , owner of a severely damaged motor_home in Fillmore ' s El Dorado Mobile_Home Estates , is pleasantly surprised . FEMA and SBA were efficient as far as Devitt is concerned . Within two weeks of his application , they had mailed him grant and loan money he didn ' t recall asking_for . &quot; I don ' t understand what the inner workings are there , &quot; Devitt said of FEMA , acknowledging that he filled_out lots of forms and may actually have requested the grant and loan money . The grant , the size of which Devitt will not disclose , is sitting in the bank while he decides what to do with it . &quot; I didn ' t know what else to do with it , &quot; he said . Not that Devitt can ' t use some extra cash . His mobile_home may have to be demolished , in which case the SBA loan money , at just over 3 % interest , will come_in_handy . But he has earthquake insurance , and he expects that to cover many of his expenses . Devitt has nothing but praise for FEMA . &quot; I was very satisfied with the operation the whole way through , &quot; he said . &quot; What you have to take into consideration is a lot of these ( applicants ) are going_to give bad reports because they ' re under a lot of stress. &quot; Chappy Morris Sr . admits he ' s under a certain amount of stress , but lays at least part of the blame on his dealings with the SBA . &quot; Their regulations and stipulations are making_it impossible for us to utilize our money , &quot; said Morris , owner of William L . Morris Chevrolet and Oldsmobile , a downtown Fillmore institution that faces $ 2.5 million in earthquake damages . Morris ' father started the business in 1929 on the day the stock_market crashed , and today Morris and his two sons run the family enterprise . Morris needs a low-interest emergency loan before he can even think_of repairs on the massive scale the business requires . He ' s willing to put_up everything he owns as collateral , but since he has the entire family on the ownership deed for estate purposes , the SBA says his assets alone are not enough to secure the loan . &quot; We are not asking_for a gift or any subsidy , but a loan , and we are willing to pay interest , &quot; Morris said . &quot; But we do not want to put everything in our family in jeopardy. &quot; Hank Carrillo , owner of yet another El Dorado park motor_home severely damaged in the quake , decided , after waiting weeks to hear on his emergency loan , that the SBA ' s terms were so onerous he will go_to a local bank instead . For a loan large enough to cover the $ 25 # 000 worth of damage the structure suffered , Carrillo would have to pay more_than 7 % interest since his income is too high to qualify for the 3 % or 4 % interest_rates some quake victims receive . Furthermore , if he accepts the loan , FEMA says , he will have to use the first $ 5 # 000 to pay_back the grant the agency awarded him . Carrillo said he ' s now leaning toward a local bank . &quot; Personally , I was thinking , ' This is great , ' &quot; he said . &quot; I didn ' t expect anything free . But some of the things they insinuated looked_like a gift from the heavens . &quot; I think if people had been told , ' We will do the best we can and we will get you the answers when we can , ' then that would have been OK , &quot; he said . &quot; But that ' s not the impression I got . It sounded like very low interest_rates , and the aid would be coming_in right away . And now , immediately has turned_out to be weeks and months. &quot;</TEXT>
