   <HEADLINE> PARKER ' S PLACE : A WRITER GETS TO SEE THE WORLD , FROM HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last night I dreamed that one of my living heroes , writer Thomas McGuane , called me out_of_the_blue to say he loved my work and to offer me a job teaching with him in the prestigious writing program at the University of Missouri . Even dreaming , I knew this situation to be preposterous because Mr. McGuane lives_in Montana , has probably never read a word I ' ve written , and not only does not teach but is an unapologetic critic of writing programs everywhere . Still , I was agog that Mr. McGuane had called , and told him I was interested in the job just so we could keep talking for a while . We made plans for me to visit him , tour the campus and hammer_out the specifics of my contract . Seconds later , in that wonderful fast forward of dreams , I was right there on the campus , walking_around with Mr. McGuane ( he asked me to call him Tom ) and so elevated by his company that I neglected to tell him I had no intention at all_of taking the job . On the opening day of the term I was still here in Orange County , doing my usual , not having notified McGuane nor anybody at the University of Missouri that I would n ' t be there . In one of those little codas you get_at the end of a dream , I looked_back on the episode , feeling wonderful about developing a relationship with the great McGuane , hoping he ' d invite me bird hunting this fall , and quite happy to have gotten_out of a job that sounded kind of tedious . I was jolted from this dream about 5 a.m. , which is when the Times delivery person comes_up my driveway and the dogs explode into a frenzy of mock alarm -- barking , shrieking , stampeding around the deck -- until the paper hits the ground , after which they hustle back to their doghouses for a quick five-hour nap before rising , bleary-eyed and groaning , to greet the day . Back in bed , I got_to thinking_about the Missouri job , and if McGuane would ever talk to me again for standing him up like that . More importantly , I started to ponder the larger meaning of the dream , which was this : Jeff , you are free to do just about anything in the world you want ; you can live anywhere you choose ; you can pursue any interests you might have because you are a widower without children and gainfully employed in work that can be done just about anywhere on Earth or , for that matter , in a space_station . I immediately began thinking_about places I might like to live . First I thought_about Aspen , Colo. , because I visited there 20 years ago and thought it was really great . I pictured myself ripping down the slopes on a snowboard , hurtling through the invigorating alpine air and flying through an open window only to land directly in the study of my rustic , snow-covered cabin and begin another chapter . Now , I can ' t ski , let alone snowboard , and to be honest , I hate snow except in pictures , so the fantasy began to lose its luster pretty quickly . Friends and People magazine have informed me over the years about the terrible decline of the place and I seriously wondered whether I should leave California to live with so many self-obsessed loonies from Hollywood . Next was Key West , a place I visited about six years ago and thought was cool . I pictured myself in the town of Earnest Hemingway , Tennessee Williams , Wallace Stevens , Phil Caputo and , of course Thomas McGuane . I would drink where they drank , fish where they fished , eat where they ate and just generally inhale the robust literary breeze that blows across this tiny island in the stream . Then I thought_about all_the tourists -- the place makes Laguna Beach at festival time look deserted -- the punishing heat and humidity , and the fact that Jimmy Buffett ' s for-profit smile seems to be all_over the town . It also bothered me immensely that the place has no supply of fresh_water ( it has to be trucked down A1A from points north ) and that , according to some kind of study done years ago , Floridians have the lowest IQs in the republic . Next I thought_about moving to Los Angeles . There I would be , smack-dab in the middle of the city that spawned the great detective fiction of Raymond Chandler , surrounded by those mean streets he wrote_about , immersed in a city synonymous with the California Dream . The Lakers . The Dodgers . Malibu , downtown , Chinatown , Beverly Hills , Watts . Hollywood and Vine ; Florence and Normandie . Dylan , Jack , Warren and Annette . Yes , a metropolitan giant in every sense of the word : size , influence , populousness , vitality . But why would I want to live there when I live an hour away by car and still avoid the place like the plague ? Why not just mount excursions into the city , enjoying what it has to offer , then escape back to the ( slightly ) cleaner air , ( barely ) diminished congestion and ( minimally ) more affordable rent to be found right here in Orange County ? Still figuring in the McGuane factor , I recalled that the only time I actually met the man outside a dream was in Los Angeles , to which I ' d driven from Laguna Beach . I pondered Paris , which I find romantic ; Fiji , which I find beautiful ; Costa Rica , which I find exciting ; Northern California , which I find relaxing ; New York , which I find terrifying ; New Orleans , which I find inspiring ; Washington , D.C. , which I find fascinating , and Paradise Valley , Mont. , which I ' ve never found at all but is where Thomas McGuane is supposed to live . Finally I just gave_up , feeling as dazed by limitless possibilities as a Russian expatriate in his first Price Club . I realized that in_order to move I ' d have to pack , fill_out change-of-address forms and find a new dentist . If I moved , I ' d have to say goodby to the odd county I grew_up in , have buried loved ones in , have adored and despised , inhabited and been inhabited by for almost an entire lifetime . Stick it out for a while , I told myself . Home is where you launch your dreams .</TEXT>
