   <HEADLINE> SET TO SELF-DESTRUCT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * There appear to be as_many special_interest groups and cult followers in our country as there are politicians.Now , that is scary ! I give our ever-failing system of government 10 years ( plus or minus five years ) before self-destructing . There is too_much political greed and corruption going without punishment . Tick , tick , tick . . . God , I wish there was cause to feel otherwise , but the media say it all , I guess . C . W . LARSON Solana Beach</TEXT>
