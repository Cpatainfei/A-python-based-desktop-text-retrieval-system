   <HEADLINE> HIV-POSITIVIST ; MICHAEL KEARNS HAS MADE A STAGE CAREER OF HIS ACTIVISM , AND A SUCCESSFUL LIFE IN HOLLYWOOD -- SAYING THE HECK WITH HOMOPHOBIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For more_than 20 years , Michael Kearns has divided his time between the highly visible world of mainstream TV and film and the less-seen arena of gay theater . It hasn ' t been a cakewalk . But what Kearns is_best known for is the fact that he has insisted on working without camouflaging who he is -- an outspoken , openly gay and , later , openly HIV-positive actor . He has , after all , been &quot; out &quot; for two decades in an entertainment_industry infamous for its homophobia . And while he ' s found himself turned_away often for reasons that he feels may be connected to his sexuality , he ' s also gotten a lot of work , perhaps as much as anything by virtue of what he calls his &quot; unwillingness to take ' no ' for an answer. &quot; For example , he ' s managed to find directors and others to cast him in such shows as &quot; The Waltons &quot; -- as John Boy ' s older brother -- as well as for guest appearances in &quot; Murder , She Wrote &quot; and &quot; Cheers. &quot; He also had a part in the TV movie &quot; And the Band Played On. &quot; Yet for all_the Hollywood barriers Kearns has helped to dent , he is most often hailed as one of the outspoken pioneers of the emerging genre known as AIDS theater . Especially in the past decade , as it ' s become clear that there -- and not on the sitcoms -- is where Kearns ' true life ' s work lies . &quot; It ' s a contradiction , but to me it makes perfect sense , &quot; says Kearns of his Jekyll-and-Hyde creative life . &quot; There ' s the assumption that L.A. is this nirvana for gay people , but Los Angeles is more homophobic at its core than Des Moines , because it ' s a factory town ruled by television and motion pictures. &quot; As a writer , actor , director and teacher -- and co-founder , with playwright James Carroll Pickett , of Artists Confronting AIDS ( ACA ) -- Kearns has been making AIDS-related theater in L.A. for more_than a decade . He has been dubbed both &quot; the only openly gay actor in Hollywood &quot; and , later , the &quot; only openly gay , openly HIV-positive actor in Hollywood , &quot; and he hasn ' t shied_away_from either label . He has appeared on network television_news and talk_shows , speaking out against entertainment_industry homophobia and on AIDS issues . Yet as visible as Kearns has been as an advocate for gay concerns , he has also reached many people through his performances in theaters across the country . His multi-character monologues featuring men and women whose lives have been touched by AIDS have played to gay and straight audiences alike , in both big cities and small . And the many other projects Kearns has produced , directed , written or conceived have given the theater-going public important new perspectives on the complexity of the AIDS epidemic . Kearns will perform his newest solo , &quot; Heart Copy , &quot; Wednesday at Highways . The following night , also at Highways , he will open &quot; Robert ' s Memorial , &quot; an interactive environmental theater piece in the style of &quot; Tony &amp; Tina ' s Wedding &quot; and &quot; Grandma Sylvia ' s Funeral , &quot; where the audience is situated in the midst of the event . His play &quot; Mijo &quot; reopens at the Whitefire Theatre in two weeks , and Kearns is also producing several other upcoming ACA shows . This nonstop productivity , in part , has made Kearns a role_model for many gay actors . But the fact that he has managed to be successful in both the entertainment_industry and the theater without compromising his identity as an HIV-positive gay_man has been even more of an inspiration . Indeed , his unwillingness to compromise has earned Kearns respect from some lofty quarters . &quot; As a performance artist , Michael Kearns has my admiration , &quot; says Sir Ian McKellen , the acclaimed , openly gay British classical stage and film actor , who was in New York recently to perform his &quot; A Knight Out. &quot; &quot; And as an openly gay_man working in Hollywood , he has earned a place in the history books. &quot; Kearns , 44 , was raised in St . Louis and came_of_age at the cultural moment -- 25 years ago last week -- when the gay civil_rights movement first came busting out of the Stonewall bar in New York ' s Greenwich_Village . In the summer of 1968 , the then-teen-age Kearns had gone_to New York to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts , but he ended_up doing most of his &quot; studying &quot; at the Stonewall bar . One year later that downtown hangout became the site of the riots now cited as the first defiant act of the modern gay movement . Kearns went_on to get training at Chicago ' s Goodman Theatre . Then he followed his ambition -- and a lover -- to Los Angeles . Armed with leading-man cheekbones and the vicarious aspirations of Midwestern relatives , Kearns came_to Hollywood with the hope of becoming a movie_star , but found himself instead cast in Tom Eyen ' s &quot; The Dirtiest Show in Town , &quot; a flamboyant revue featuring nudity that was about sexual freedom and other 1970s hot_issues , such_as war and pollution . &quot; During that show it dawned on me that I was much more comfortable on the live stage , playing gay characters , &quot; says Kearns . &quot; That didn ' t stop my pursuit of the other , but the invigorating work was in small theater playing gay roles. &quot; Kearns continued to do theater while beginning to work as a screen actor during the 1970s . He had some success landing a number of other &quot; straight &quot; roles , yet it was his exploits as the fictitious &quot; Happy Hustler &quot; making the rounds on the talk-show circuit that brought Kearns the most attention , and probably also the most unhappiness . The Happy Hustler began when Kearns sold a photograph of himself to Warner Paperback Library for use on the cover of &quot; The Happy Hustler , &quot; by Grant Tracy Saxon . Saxon was Kearns ' lover at the time , and his work was a takeoff on Xaviera Hollander ' s best-selling &quot; The Happy Hooker. &quot; When a New York talk_show wanted an interview with Saxon , the publishers suggested that Kearns could instead pose as the character in the book , passing the novel off as his autobiography . He went_along with the ruse for two years , twice appearing on &quot; Donahue &quot; because he thought it would help his career , but found himself increasingly miserable in the role , feeling he was &quot; only playing an untrue fraction and a distorted version &quot; of himself . Toward the end of the 1970s , Kearns began to wend his way_out of a period of what he describes as &quot; self-loathing. &quot; He acted in a_couple_of productions now seen as landmarks in local gay theater : Robert Patrick ' s &quot; T-Shirts &quot; and Harvey Fierstein ' s &quot; International Stud. &quot; The productions were staged in tiny houses -- including the now-defunct Smitty ' s Deja Vu Coffee-house , a pioneering gay theater venue -- but they became word-of-mouth cult hits that are still recalled today . &quot; Suddenly there was this audience for gay theater , &quot; says Kearns . &quot; Meanwhile , the community had bloomed in that decade . We were even being reflected in television and film to some extent . That was the honeymoon period. &quot; Kearns hosted a KNBC documentary called &quot; Gay &quot; and network TV began to include gays in mainstream shows , such_as Billy Crystal ' s character on &quot; Soap , &quot; played , not insignificantly , by a straight actor . Other advances came_in such films as William Friedkin ' s &quot; Cruising , &quot; which , while much-criticized for its depiction of gay life , nonetheless made gays less invisible . But these semi-halcyon days weren ' t to last . &quot; Then comes AIDS , &quot; says Kearns . &quot; People started dying. &quot; And as the deaths started to accumulate during the early 1980s , Kearns continued in both gay theater and TV and film roles , although he began to feel more urgency about his role as an activist and spokesperson . He also wrote his first autobiographical solo , &quot; The Truth Is Bad Enough , &quot; formed a professional partnership with playwright Pickett , directed several theater pieces that were the first widely seen works of AIDS theater in Los Angeles and did a stint as artistic director of the gay-oriented Celebration Theatre . Paradoxically , Kearns found a new lease on creative life in the midst of all_the dying . &quot; Somewhere in that time , I became an artist , &quot; recalls Kearns . &quot; Whatever that pain , that loss , that tragedy was , I managed to spin it like an alchemist into something passionate . And it ' s been increasingly so since. &quot; During the pivotal mid-1980s , he continued to expand his theater efforts . He also hooked_up_with such fellow-traveler activists as performance artist Tim Miller , who co-founded both New York ' s PS 122 and , later , Santa Monica ' s Highways . In 1984 , Kearns and Pickett founded ACA , an organization of artists and others who were intent_on finding ways to nurture their own works , as well as those of other artists , about AIDS . &quot; We realized that art and AIDS were inextricably linked and that somehow we wanted to address this -- whether it was by raising money or consciousness or both , &quot; he says . A docudrama series titled &quot; AIDS / US &quot; quickly became ACA ' s calling card . The works consisted_of various men and women whose lives had been affected by AIDS , telling their stories to the audience in a collage-style format of direct-address speeches , with only minimal staging . &quot; The ' AIDS / US ' pieces have always been the backbone of our organization , &quot; says Kearns . &quot; We ' re taking real-life stories and telling them in first-person docudrama form -- which , for my money , is somehow more artistically meritorious than most AIDS plays , just because it ' s so raw and edgy. &quot; &quot; AIDS / US / TEENS , &quot; which will tour to various locations throughout L.A. beginning in September , will be the fourth piece in the series that began with &quot; AIDS / US. &quot; &quot; Jim ( Pickett ) and I conceived_of that ( docudrama ) format together because we felt that no matter how close to the bone the plays were that were coming_out around 1984-85 -- and there were only a handful of them -- they weren ' t really giving the entire picture of AIDS , &quot; Kearns says . &quot; They certainly weren ' t , and still aren ' t for that matter , dealing with issues of class , race , sexism and all those myriad issues which seem to rear their ugly heads in relationship to AIDS. &quot; The students in one of the small group acting classes that Kearns teaches out of the back-yard studio of his Glendale home take 10 before heading back for more of the intensive coaching that is Kearns ' specialty . When they reconvene , it ' s time for scene work . First , there ' s some fine-tuning to do on a section from &quot; Waiting for Godot. &quot; Then , next up is an excerpt from Edward Albee ' s &quot; Who ' s Afraid of Virginia Woolf. &quot; This is not standard casting , though : Two guys play the leads , so the original script ' s Strindbergian dance of George and Martha becomes a George and Martin pas de deux . After nearly 15 minutes of visceral work -- with Kearns constantly coaxing the actors to stretch and experiment -- fatigue begins to set_in and humor gets the better of the group . &quot; You know , I ' m going_to lead a workshop called ' Discovering Your Inner Martha , ' &quot; jests Kearns , who soon has the room in stitches . &quot; we ' ll do_it at the retreat . we ' ll bring costumes , booze , slutty clothes . Well , everybody just seems to be so drawn to this material. &quot; But then , it figures that Kearns should be a master of making_fun of this stuff . Hollywood and he have had , after all , as tempestuous a relationship as George and Martha . And it ' s only gotten rockier during the past decade . When Rock Hudson died in 1985 , Kearns , who once had a brief affair with Hudson , spoke out about industry homophobia and AIDS . &quot; Although I had been out , never was I so out as when Hudson died , &quot; Kearns says . &quot; I got assigned a middle name -- ' Michael ( only openly gay actor in Hollywood ) Kearns ' -- because I was the only one who was willing to go_on ' Nightline ' and scream and yell and stamp my feet , which I did . Then I made a habit of that. &quot; Kearns took his own HIV test in 1989 , the same week he premiered his multi-character show &quot; intimacies. &quot; This one-man show , and its sequel , &quot; more intimacies , &quot; quickly garnered Kearns new recognition as a performer . In these works , which remain among the artist ' s most popular , he portrays a gallery of people whose lives have been affected by AIDS . Using just a long red scarf , he transfigures into such disparate characters as a deaf boy , a priest , a flamenco dancer , a prostitute-mom and an accountant . &quot; ' ( I ) ntimacies ' is where I took_flight and thank God haven ' t landed , &quot; says Kearns . &quot; ' ( I ) ntimacies ' was proof that I had something to say and I took that seriously . Then , not only was I an artist , I was an activist . So at 39 , I accepted myself as an artist-activist . that ' s really only a short time ago . &quot; I could have easily died at age 38 , &quot; Kearns continues . &quot; Think_of all_the poor people who did . that ' s why I have a tendency to not take one day for granted and to overwork the way that I do. &quot; Among those who have died is film and TV actor Brad Davis . When Davis died in 1991 , Kearns spoke out again , and went public about his own HIV-positive status during an NBC interview . &quot; Rock Hudson dies of AIDS , Brad Davis dies of AIDS -- it ' s six years later and people wore a_few red ribbons , but the shocking thing was that nothing had changed , &quot; Kearns says . Despite his often-scathing criticisms of industry prejudice and inattention to AIDS , Kearns continued to work in the entertainment business , including roles on the sitcom &quot; Life Goes On &quot; and in &quot; And the Band Played On. &quot; Meanwhile , Kearns-the-stage-performer kept writing and performing new shows like &quot; Rock. &quot; Inspired by his own 1983 &quot; dalliance &quot; with the late actor , Kearns again used this production to play multiple roles : himself , Marilyn Monroe , an Arkansas teen called Rocky and Reggie , a composite character based on men whose job it had been to &quot; butch-up &quot; Hudson ' s mannerisms . Rock himself never appears . In &quot; Rock , &quot; Kearns more directly attacked Hollywood ' s homophobia than he had in his previous shows , pointing toward the even higher-profile stance he has maintained since Davis ' death . Progress since then has been no more_than incremental . &quot; Since Brad died , there has been more movement on some level , &quot; says Kearns . &quot; Yet the thing that Hollywood would probably break its arm patting itself on the back over is ' Philadelphia , ' which is a dismal , pathetic representation of AIDS and gayness. &quot; Kearns believes that the powers in the entertainment_industry are homophobic and that they cater to a perceived homophobic audience . &quot; And lots of ( these decision-makers ) are gay . But they , who are gay , have chandeliers that need to be cleaned and car phones and Bill Blass suits and blah . . . blah . . . blah . At what point is one selling_out ? How many people do they have to have die of AIDS before they wake_up ? &quot; It ' s internalized homophobia , an unquenchable self-loathing , &quot; Kearns says . &quot; There ' s some ' physician heal thyself ' which needs to go_on here -- and which has , a little . There are a_few more out writers , producers and even actors . But it ' s still unsafe overall , and that has been created by ' us. ' &quot; Kearns doesn ' t turn the other cheek . &quot; I like to be in the ring fighting with these people , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s what spurs us on : the contradictions , the red ribbons and the superciliousness , self-serving qualities of Hollywood that have been around AIDS from the beginning . that ' s what fuels us theater artists. &quot; It was a warm Sunday afternoon on May 29 when Kearns was feeling pre-show butterflies -- and then some . His latest play , &quot; Mijo , &quot; was about to open in front of critics and he ' d spent the day ministering to his longtime colleague , the increasingly ill Pickett . &quot; Jim had spent the day getting markedly more demented , &quot; recalls Kearns . &quot; Eventually I said to the nurse , ' Is it my imagination or is he going downhill fast ? ' The nurse agreed that he was . So at 2:20 , literally 40 minutes before ' Mijo ' is to open at 3 , we ' re getting Jim ready to go . It becomes slapstick : ' Get him out the door , take him to the hospital . Go_to the play. ' It ' s so farcical that it ' s sad. &quot; But the show must go_on . And Kearns continues to create in defiance of the devastation that surrounds him . He has , however , noticed some unconscious accommodations on his part . In 1993 , Kearns wrote or performed works that featured characters who died , including an elaborate revival of Charles Ludlam ' s version of &quot; Camille , &quot; with Kearns in the title_role . Yet even though audiences could sometimes be heard sniffling as the heroine died in the third act , Kearns feels that some gay people may have stayed away because it was just too difficult to watch . &quot; ' Camille ' was not the audience-grabbing play we had anticipated , because no matter how it was gift-wrapped , it was about death , &quot; says Kearns . &quot; And they didn ' t want to see death , even in a $ 1 # 000 dress. &quot; Significantly , Kearns ' two 1994 works -- &quot; Mijo &quot; and &quot; Robert ' s Memorial &quot; -- have the deaths occur offstage . In the former , a play about the mother and lover of a dying man , the person who has AIDS is unseen . And in the latter , he has already died before the play begins . Perhaps that will break_down some of the resistance -- although the urge to look_away is a response that Kearns understands all too well . He ' s seen too_much death himself . And that -- along with a longstanding desire to parent -- is partly what has driven him to recently become accredited to be a foster_parent . During the period in which he was interviewed for this article , Kearns was playing temporary host to a pair of 4-year-old boys , and he looks_forward to having more young charges in the future . &quot; I want to see somebody go from age 1 to age 2 to age 3 , as opposed to seeing somebody in their final days , &quot; he says . &quot; I want to see the life process , as opposed to the death process , begin. &quot; Foster-parenting also marks another battlefield for Kearns . &quot; Just like I deserve to work in the entertainment_industry as an openly gay , openly HIV-positive actor , I also deserve to be a foster_parent as an openly gay , openly HIV-positive man , &quot; says Kearns . &quot; that ' s another battle I ' m fighting here , to point_out that HIV does not equal immediate death and that people with HIV can have productive , busy lives . &quot; I want to leave a mark , more_than just in terms of ' he was this loud gay actor-activist. ' I want to leave it on a personal level , with individuals -- kids , students , anyone. &quot; * &quot; Heart Copy , &quot; Wednesday , and &quot; Robert ' s Memorial , &quot; Thursday-next Sunday , 8:30 p.m. ( continues on Sundays , 5 p.m. , indefinitely ) , both at Highways Performance Space , 1651 18th St. , Santa Monica , $ 10 .
