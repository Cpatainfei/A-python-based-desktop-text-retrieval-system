   <HEADLINE> END NEAR IN ICN BATTLE ; BUT ISSUES RAISED IN THE SQUABBLE WILL PERSIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It began as a colorful but straightforward story , one of an ambitious and smooth-talking stockbroker who wanted to oust the dapper , mercurial chairman of a mid-sized pharmaceuticals company . But in the 10 months since , Rafi Khan ' s effort to topple Milan Panic , founder of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Costa Mesa , has evolved into an extraordinarily nasty battle whose repercussions have ricocheted throughout the financial services_industry . On Tuesday , at ICN ' s long-awaited annual meeting , the question of whether Khan and a six-member slate of candidates should replace Panic and eight other ICN board_members will finally be settled . It appears almost certain that Panic , whose troubles stem in part from his seven-month sojourn as prime_minister of Yugoslavia , will emerge victorious . The broader issues raised in this battle , though , will not disappear as quickly . For starters , Khan may still have to answer allegations of criminal wrongdoing that surfaced as a result of ICN ' s concerted effort to discredit him . More important , the ICN-Khan affair has focused overdue attention on the standards and practices of the booming mutual_fund industry . Khan ' s relationships with mutual_fund companies that are ICN ' s largest shareholders have led to questions about possible conflicts_of_interest on the part of fund managers -- and may have contributed to the firing last month of prominent Invesco Funds Group Inc. manager John Kaweske . Invesco said Kaweske was terminated because he broke company rules by not reporting personal trades . His portfolio included shares_in a private placement of stocks in Cardiac Science Inc. , an Irvine medical device company that Khan has promoted for the past two years . Howard Cooper , chairman of Cardiac Science , is a member of Khan ' s slate of would-be ICN directors . And the managers of three mutual_funds that are large holders of ICN stock -- Glickenhaus &amp; Co. , Putnam Investments of Boston and Chestnut Hill Management Corp . -- also bought shares_in Cardiac Science . These funds and several other institutional holders of ICN shares also own stock in a laundry list of companies that Khan has recommended in a series of reports , written in an unabashedly campy style . Most of those stocks have risen sharply in the past 24 months -- though one of them , Future Communications , is in bankruptcy and the subject of a number of lawsuits . The implication , subtly suggested by ICN , is that Khan has a network of fund managers who would support him in exchange for insider tips on new stock_issues and other similar favors . While no clear evidence has emerged to support such a theory , it has prompted federal and state regulators to focus_on the links between stock promoters and fund managers . Khan , who owns less than 1 % of ICN ' s outstanding shares , and the fund managers who have invested in the drug firm say the implications of wrongdoing are ridiculous . &quot; I think it is a sham that all this ( controversy over Cardiac Science stock ) comes_up right before the annual meeting , &quot; Khan said . &quot; All this is inspired and contrived by Panic. &quot; Khan and the fund managers note that Cardiac Science has hardly been a stellar investment , and cite a far more innocent reason for their involvement with Khan : He has a good record in picking stocks . &quot; I ' m very sympathetic to Khan , &quot; said Seth Glickenhaus of Glickenhaus &amp; Co . &quot; He ' s a salesman , a very bright person. &quot; ICN has invested heavily in an effort to discredit Khan , taking_out full-page ads in newspapers and hiring private_investigators to delve into his past . Unfortunately for Khan , the investigators uncovered evidence that suggested he may have been involved in a scheme to defraud the_British government by illegally buying too many shares_in British Gas . After a dramatic November hearing in federal_court in New York , U.S. District Judge John Sprizzo found that Khan had probably masterminded the_British Gas share-buying scheme and lied_about it in court . He later persuaded the U.S. attorney ' s office in Manhattan to investigate Khan for perjury and other possible wrongdoing . Khan , who was once a staunch ally of ICN and Panic , is now accused of using insider_information in pursuing his proxy_fight . He denies those charges . Five brokerages involved in short-selling Future Communications shares accused Khan in lawsuits of engaging in market manipulation . Some of those firms either have settled or are negotiating deals , according to Khan ' s attorney . And federal authorities , working in seven cities , have subpoenaed records of Khan ' s trading activity at his former employer , Beverly Hills brokerage Reynolds Kendrick &amp; Stratton , and are looking_into his stock dealings at another local brokerage , H.J. Meyers &amp; Sons Inc. Three former Khan employees and associates -- Kristina Kraverica , Olivia Winsten and Shirley Kwok , all_of whom knew Khan at H.J. Meyers or Reynolds Kendrick -- were subpoenaed to appear before a New York grand_jury beginning Wednesday , sources said . No criminal charges have ever been filed against Khan . But clearly , the allegations have eroded Khan ' s support among fund managers -- even though many are dissatisfied with ICN . &quot; Rafi ( Khan ) is now a controversial figure , &quot; said one fund manager , who asked not to be identified . &quot; If a judge says that Rafi is a crook , then that is a pretty big hill to get over. &quot; Another manager noted that mutual_funds rely heavily on their reputations to attract customers . &quot; Funds are political creatures , very sensitive to their image , &quot; he said . &quot; That makes_it very hard for them to vote for &quot; Khan . Some fund managers cited other problems . Philip Dubuque , fund manager at Chestnut Hill , would not divulge how he would vote , but he questioned the experience of Khan ' s proposed directors . Dubuque said management has lately been &quot; listening to shareholders. &quot; Indeed , Khan ' s challenge has clearly forced ICN to promise to address a number of issues that had angered stockholders . Those include the dilution of shares through private placements in Europe , lucrative compensation packages for ICN executives and Panic ' s alleged neglect of the company during his ill-fated stint as prime_minister of Yugoslavia that ended abruptly last year . Putnam spokeswoman Nancy Fisher said her firm had decided to back current management after it &quot; carefully considered the arguments of both sides. &quot; &quot; We had face-to-face meetings with Mr. Khan and Mr. Panic , and while some concerns raised by Mr. Khan deserve serious attention , we are impressed by the willingness of ICN to address issues important to us , &quot; Fisher said . Still , not all_of Khan ' s erstwhile allies have abandoned him . Seth Glickenhaus said last week that he would probably vote his funds ' 575 # 000 ICN shares_in favor of Khan ' s slate . Khan maintains that he holds the advantage in the proxy_fight . But privately , he is livid that funds such_as Invesco -- for whom he claimed to have made $ 500 million with profitable stock recommendations -- are abandoning him now . Khan also believes that Invesco fired Kaweske because he would have pledged the fund ' s 1.6 million shares to him . Khan now says he is counting_on support from a number of smaller mutual_funds to land him a seat on ICN ' s board . ICN officials said they were heartened by what they feel will be an easy victory Tuesday after a long , tumultuous campaign . Spokesman David Calef said the votes will be counted during the annual meeting and the results announced immediately . &quot; We are very confident about the outcome , &quot; he said , noting that a New York judge has ordered Khan to vote 44 # 000 of_his_own 120 # 000 ICN shares to the company because it was determined that those shares were acquired as the result of trading on insider_information . &quot; Even Rafi is voting for us. &quot;</TEXT>
