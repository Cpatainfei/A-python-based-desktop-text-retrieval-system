   <HEADLINE> NEW U.S. POLICY ON TAIWAN PROMPTS CHINESE WARNING ; ASIA : BEIJING IMPLICITLY RENEWS THREAT OF MILITARY_ACTION AGAINST THE ISLAND IF IT DECLARES INDEPENDENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China issued a harshly worded protest Saturday against a recent upgrading of Washington ' s relations with Taiwan , warning of &quot; grave consequences &quot; from the new U.S. policy . Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu , in a statement reported by the official New China News_Agency , also implicitly renewed a longstanding Chinese threat to take military_action against Taiwan if it ever formally declares independence . Liu threatened that U.S.-China relations will face new &quot; difficulties and crises &quot; as a result of the U.S. policy , announced Wednesday , which provides_for slightly freer public contact between U.S. and Taiwanese officials and clearer identification of Taiwan ' s representative offices in the United States . In a &quot; strong protest &quot; delivered to U.S. Ambassador J . Stapleton Roy , Liu charged that the United States has adopted a policy of creating &quot; two Chinas &quot; or &quot; one China , one Taiwan. &quot; The question of Taiwan will become an &quot; explosive issue &quot; if not handled properly , Liu declared . The U.S. Embassy had no immediate comment on the Chinese protest . Taiwan , which officially calls itself the Republic_of_China , is governed by the Nationalist Party , which fled to the island after its 1949 defeat by the Communists in China ' s civil_war . Until a_few years ago , Taipei and Beijing agreed that Taiwan is part of China but argued over which government was the legitimate ruler of the entire nation . Now Taiwan is seeking greater international recognition as a separate political entity in which the Taipei government claims to govern only Taiwan . Taipei argues that China is a single nation with two governments , much like Germany before its unification , and it has expressed interest in joining the United Nations on that basis . The Clinton_Administration announced Wednesday that although it would not support the U.N. bid , it would allow a slight upgrading of its relationship with Taiwan . Taiwan ' s representative offices in the United States -- previously known as the Coordination Council for North_American Affairs , a name chosen to deliberately downplay its actual identity -- will be allowed to be renamed as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office . Taiwanese officials will be allowed to visit most U.S._government offices , and U.S. economic and technical officials will be authorized to visit Taiwan . On Thursday , Lynn Pascoe , head of the American Institute in Taiwan , visited President Lee Teng-hui . It was the first time since 1979 that a U.S. official has visited a Taiwanese president in his office . These changes , however slight , carry some diplomatic meaning . But the island ' s president , vice_president , premier and vice premier will still be barred from visiting the United States . In recent months the Clinton_Administration has taken far more dramatic measures to improve relations with Beijing . In May , President Clinton severed the link between human_rights and trade . And two weeks ago , Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown led a sales mission to China in which he avoided public criticism of Beijing ' s human_rights record . Liu specifically warned Saturday , however , that China will not show greater flexibility on the issue of Taiwan in response to these gestures . For Beijing , the issue of Taiwan is a &quot; question of principle which allows no room for maneuver , &quot; Liu said . &quot; We will never sit idle if the Taiwan authorities go_in for Taiwan independence with support from foreign forces and turbulence breaks_out in Taiwan as a result , &quot; he added . Statements of this nature , which Beijing has made before , are generally interpreted as threats to invade or otherwise take military_action . The most recent serious Beijing-Washington clash over Taiwan came_in 1992 , when then-President George_Bush authorized the sale to Taiwan of 150 F-16 jet fighters . Delivery of those planes is scheduled in the next few years . Liu reiterated Chinese criticism of the jets ' sale , warning that the issue is not yet closed .</TEXT>
