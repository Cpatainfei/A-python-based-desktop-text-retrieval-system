   <HEADLINE> TRADITIONAL FAMILY NEARLY THE EXCEPTION , CENSUS FINDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The conventional model of American family life -- a married_couple with kids and a stable home -- is_on the verge of becoming the exception rather than the rule , the U.S. Census_Bureau reported Monday . In a study certain to fuel the &quot; family values &quot; debate , Census_Bureau statisticians said that only 50.8 % of American children live_in a traditional &quot; nuclear &quot; family . They define a nuclear_family as one where both biological parents are present and all children were born after the marriage . It excludes households with single or divorced parents and other adults or children . The study is based on 1991 data and does not contain comparable figures for previous or more recent years . But it squares with other reports in recent years that show a decline in the number of traditional families . Census officials said that the decline reflects powerful societal trends that cannot be easily reversed : gradual migration from rural communities to cities and suburbs , growing ranks of working mothers , declining church and community influences , expanded assistance to poor households and greater tolerance of divorce and single parenting . &quot; With more and more women bearing children out of wedlock , along with high divorce rates , more children than ever are spending at least part of their childhoods in single-parent families or other alternative family situations , &quot; said Stacy Furukawa , author of the report . The findings are likely to provide ammunition for political candidates and social critics who argue that policies and practices that undermine &quot; family values &quot; contribute to many of society ' s ills , including crime and broken homes . &quot; It ' s the kind of thing that can have a substantial impact on the political situation , &quot; said Ross Baker , professor of political_science at Rutgers University . &quot; It tells us that the glass is half empty , confirming the popular suspicion that America is going_to hell in a handbasket. &quot; The new report did not cite corresponding data from earlier or later years . However , its findings are similar to an earlier , little-noticed analysis of census data that clearly showed a steep decline in the percentage of children living_in traditional nuclear_families over the last two decades . Donald Hernandez , the Census_Bureau official who published a book , &quot; America ' s Children , &quot; on the subject , found that the number of children who lived_in nuclear_families was 57 % in 1980 and 66 % in 1970 . But he reported that the number was 51 % in 1988 , virtually identical to the 1991 census figure , which could indicate a leveling of the decline . The decline in the staying power of the nuclear_family , he said , is the combined result of several different sweeping demographic changes_over the century . During the first_half of the century , many families migrated from family farms to urban_areas , where both parents and their offspring had worked together to keep the family afloat financially . There was also an exodus from close-knit communities and small_towns , where social pressure was a great deterrent to divorce or bearing children out of wedlock . Once in the city , people had greater anonymity and there was less societal pressure to remain married . Also , starting in the 1960s , more women were entering the labor_market , and leaving unwanted marriages became easier for them financially . &quot; There are very powerful and strong_forces leading to the increase of divorce and the change away from the traditional family , &quot; said Hernandez , who is the chief of the Census_Bureau ' s marriage and family statistics branch . &quot; That does not mean public policy cannot do something to turn_around that trend . But they would have to be very powerful policies to have any impact. &quot; The percentage of children living_in nuclear_families varies greatly by race and ethnic_group . Fifty-six percent of white children lived_in &quot; traditional nuclear_families , &quot; while 26 % of African American and 38 % of Latino children did . About 15 % of all children lived_in &quot; blended &quot; families , with a stepparent and / or stepchildren . Overall , 12.5 % of children lived_in extended family situations , where at least one additional adult -- a grandparent , other relative or a boarder -- lived_in the household . Children in one-parent families were four times more likely to live_in an extended_family than children living with two parents . Only 7 % of the children living with both parents had additional adults in their households while 30 % of children living with a single parent did . Latino children were most likely to live_in extended families . A quarter of all Latino children , 20 % of black children and 10 % of white children lived_in such households . Poverty , unemployment and the shortage of affordable housing , as well as cultural traditions , all played a role in influencing whether additional adults live_in one household with a nuclear_family , Furukawa said . Fully one in four children lives with a single parent , according to the report . One-half of all black children , nearly one third of Latino children and one-fifth of white children lived with a single parent , according to the report . One-fifth of the children living with a single mother had an adult_male , related or unrelated , living_in their household . About two-fifths of the children living with a single father had an adult_female , related or unrelated , living with them . Household Structure One out of two children lived_in a nuclear_family , which is defined in the study as composed solely of both biological parents and full brothers and sisters .
