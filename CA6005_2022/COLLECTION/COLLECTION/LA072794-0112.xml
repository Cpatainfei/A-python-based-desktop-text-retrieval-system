   <HEADLINE> JUDGE BLOCKS PROPOSAL FOR HUGE DUMP ; GARBAGE : RULING SAYS ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT FAILED TO CONSIDER IMPACT THE EAGLE MOUNTAIN LANDFILL WOULD HAVE ON DESERT AND GROUND_WATER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Plans to construct the world ' s largest garbage_dump -- known as Eagle Mountain , and big enough to handle Southern California ' s trash for 115 years -- were derailed Tuesday by a judge ' s ruling that the project ' s environmental impact review contains serious flaws . Among the inadequacies in the environmental review is the fact that the developer ignored how the landfill would affect the neighboring Joshua_Tree National_Monument , including the region ' s &quot; natural peace and solitude , the clean air , the pristine desert , &quot; said San Diego Superior_Court Judge Judith McConnell . In her 18-page ruling , she said the review also failed to adequately consider what effect the landfill would have_on the threatened desert_tortoise , on the region ' s ground_water in the event of a major earthquake , and on the expected growth of the small hamlet of Desert Center , including how that growth could affect the desert environment . Riverside County judges deferred the lawsuit to the San Diego jurist because Riverside County was a defendant in the contested environmental impact report . Eagle Mountain officials say they will correct the omissions and resubmit an impact report to the Riverside County Board of Supervisors . The board approved the controversial project in 1992 by a 3-2 vote , but a new board majority opposes it . The November election could cause board support of Eagle Mountain to go either way . &quot; This is a great day for the desert , &quot; said Donna Charpied , a jojoba farmer who lives two miles from the landfill site , 200 miles east of Los Angeles in central Riverside County . &quot; The issue here was water , water and water , and the EIR clearly did not show that our ground_water could be protected. &quot; Dan Roman , another lawsuit plaintiff , characterized McConnell ' s ruling as &quot; a major victory for the people who live_in the California desert . It ' s time for the people of Los Angeles County and other urban_areas to start addressing real alternatives to solid waste management . The desert is not an alternative and will not be California ' s toilet . We won ' t let it happen. &quot; The Eagle Mountain project had progressed the furthest among several proposals to deal with Southern California ' s garbage in a wholesale , long-term manner -- by transferring urban trash by rail to huge dumping grounds in relatively isolated areas . Similar projects are_on the drawing boards for Imperial and San Bernardino counties . Eagle Mountain is a onetime open pit iron_ore mine dug by Kaiser Steel Corp . from 1948 to 1983 ; its three pits , up_to two miles long , are large enough to accommodate 20 # 000 tons of garbage daily for at least 115 years . Until McConnell ' s ruling on Tuesday , the project faced only two more substantial hurdles : final approval by the California Integrated Waste Management Board in Sacramento , and a judge ' s pending decision on a controversial land swap between Eagle Mountain and the federal Bureau of Land Management so enough land could be packaged for the project . But with McConnell ' s decision , Eagle Mountain must again win permission from Riverside County . Richard A . Daniels , president of Mine Reclamation Corp. , which has shepherded the Eagle Mountain project since 1989 , said he was &quot; disappointed but not discouraged &quot; by McConnell ' s ruling . Daniels expressed confidence that Riverside supervisors will approve a redrawn impact report because of the need for a huge dump to serve not only Southern California but Riverside County itself . The company -- owned 60 % by Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. , the nation ' s second-largest solid waste disposal company -- has spent &quot; tens of millions of dollars &quot; on its investment so far , he said . But even as Houston-based BFI reconsiders its role in the project , the local firm has enough resources to pursue Eagle Mountain at least through the approval and development stages , Daniels said . BFI spokesman Peter Block in Houston said an announcement on the firm ' s involvement in Eagle Mountain will be made within weeks -- and that reconsideration of its role was under way even before Tuesday ' s ruling by McConnell . Joel Moskowitz , attorney for Eagle Mountain ' s opponents , said the judge ' s rejection of the impact report was not necessarily the project ' s death_knell . &quot; Clearly they can fix the EIR -- the environmental equivalent of truth in advertising -- by rewriting it to properly disclose the environmental effects of the project , &quot; he said . &quot; But having done so , they ' ve then got_to go_back to the decision-makers for judgment on whether the environmental consequences are too high to pay_for this facility. &quot; County Supervisor Bob Buster , who will continue on the board even after November ' s election , said he challenges the need for a dump as large as Eagle Mountain -- particularly since the county would be liable for any environmental disasters caused there .
