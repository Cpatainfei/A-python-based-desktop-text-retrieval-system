   <HEADLINE> RIGHTS WATCH ; PAYING FOR THE STORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Among many other things , state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown is obviously a highly intelligent and imaginative legislator . But his proposal to prohibit witnesses in criminal trials from selling their stories before or during a trial would push California onto very tricky ground . Brown -- like fellow legislator Sen . Quentin Kopp ( I-San Francisco ) , who favors a similar approach -- is utterly appalled by the practice of witnesses pedaling their testimony to the sort of &quot; news organizations &quot; that have no moral or ethical reservations at all about checkbook journalism . Many ordinary citizens were disgusted to hear that witnesses in the O . J . Simpson case were selling their stories to frenzied media outlets . The problem is not only that the practice is questionable , but that it may possibly complicate Simpson ' s criminal trial . &quot; A witness who tells the truth , but admits being paid_for the story , may lose credibility in the eyes of the jury , &quot; Brown argues . Alas , Brown ' s proposal lands right on the knife ' s edge of the perennial dilemma : rights in conflict . The American system requires a fair trial , but it also requires the greatest possible freedom_of_speech and the press . Prohibiting witnesses from taking money for their stories is not the same as banning them from talking to the press , as Brown is careful to point_out . But when all is said and done , his proposal could mean less freedom for both the individual and the press . In the final analysis , Brown ' s cure , which is constitutionally dubious anyway , could prove worse than the disease .</TEXT>
