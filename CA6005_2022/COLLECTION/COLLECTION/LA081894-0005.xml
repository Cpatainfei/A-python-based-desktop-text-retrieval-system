   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEWS ; CULTIVATING UNEXPECTED VISTAS OF ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nothing happens by accident in Lynn Geesaman ' s meticulously composed photographs of extravagantly manicured gardens and parks . Every tree , shrub , footpath and pond plays_at least two roles simultaneously , reminding viewers of the beauty of natural flora and demonstrating the gardeners ' power to compose plants in visually satisfying panoramas . At Stephen Cohen Gallery , Geesaman ' s 25 exquisite silver prints from the past six years begin where the gardeners leave_off , adding another level of artifice to nature ' s raw_materials . Her pretty , black-and-white images focus_on odd , off-center vistas . Geesaman tweaks the highly structured symmetry of the formal gardens she visits in Belgium , Holland , France , England and Italy to create her own idiosyncratic -- yet formally rigorous -- compositions . From across the gallery , the Minneapolis-based photographer ' s perfectly square pictures appear to be modest abstractions . Against bright , white skies that look_like pure vacuums , saturated black silhouettes of shrubbery and trees dramatically contrast . The absence of tonal modulation locks the pictorial elements into single planes . Branches , trunks and canals read as straight or curved lines . Sculpted topiaries have the presence of flat , geometric shapes . The restraint evident in Geesaman ' s well-mannered photographs enhances the visual tension between volumetric depth and graphic two-dimensionality . Moving_up close to her pictures complicates the formal drama , revealing previously invisible textures , details and subtleties . What had seemed to be monochromatic silhouettes slowly unfold to become rows of identically trimmed trees , tangles of limbs sprouting foliage from their ends or clusters of plump topiaries whose individual leaves are clearly articulated . Dark halos emanating from the trunks of many trees endow Geesaman ' s artificial landscapes with a soft , haunting afterglow that intensifies their mystery . Seemingly lit from behind , her photographs resemble empty stage_sets suspended in time and cut free from the pull of gravity . Fragmentary and partial , these entrancing images reject the idea of distant overviews or excessively planned surveys . Rather than privileging a fixed , central point-of-view , Geesaman ' s photographs describe unexpected perspectives . They combine a classically modernist sense of composition with a romantic desire to find vistas that stir deep sentiments , effectively demonstrating that when fresh views don ' t happen by accident , they can be carefully cultivated . * Stephen Cohen Gallery , 7466 Beverly Blvd. , ( 213 ) 937-5525 , through Sept . 3 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Fresh From the Past : &quot; In Retrospect : Paintings of the ' 80s &quot; is a slyly titled , six-artist exhibition at Rosamund Felsen Gallery . Its compact , far-from-complete survey of a vital strand of Los Angeles-based abstraction is more of a tease than a fully elaborated history_lesson . Like a movie preview , it leaves you wanting to see more of each artist ' s rich , painterly flourishes , bold , graphic patterns and quirky , cartoon Surrealism . The show is an effective antidote to the notion that painting , in the 1980s , wholly consisted_of the neo-expressionist return to figuration that swept Europe and New York . By baldly laying_claim to that decade , &quot; Paintings of the ' 80s &quot; pointedly suggests that art in Los Angeles has its own history , that it cannot be assessed in terms of Baselitz , Clemente or Schnabel , but must be accounted_for according to different criteria . Nearly all_of the exhibition ' s 14 images still look fresh . However , they are most engaging as points of comparison to each artist ' s current work . Lari Pittman ' s mural-scale &quot; Netherworld &quot; traces his manic , hyperactive graphics to an imaginary landscape overlaid with decorative motifs , dancing organic forms and a sailboat drifting on a golden lake . Likewise , Roy Dowell ' s current , cacophonous collages have their roots in five emblematic paintings , in which Cubism ' s fractured space is held_in check by an eccentric geometry . Marc Pally ' s recent , tattoo-like cartographies grow out of rougher , doodle-derived compositions that masterfully meld media . Three dreamy paintings by Jeff Gambill begin to chart the psychological territory out of which his moving , inarticulate symbols continue to spring . &quot; Broader Landscapes , &quot; by Renee Petropoulos , signals her emergent interest in pushing painting beyond its frame to actively engage architectural space . Unlike all_of these images , which track each artist ' s current work back to an earlier stage of development , Karen Carson ' s juicy oil-and-acrylic-on-canvas departs from her recent banners , globes and installations , revealing a sumptuous side that has not carried_over into her more message-oriented pieces . * Rosamund Felsen Gallery , 8525 Santa Monica Blvd. , ( 310 ) 652- 9172 , through Sept . 3 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . * Grand Delusions : &quot; Pistonine , &quot; Greg Solomon Falk ' s largest sculpture at William Turner Gallery , resembles a gigantic , dysfunctional balance that doubles as a gushing water_fountain , miniature reflecting pool and slow-burning oil_lamp . The ambitions behind this towering , multipurpose contraption , made of rusted metal , baked clay , hidden pumps and ample gaskets ( among other mechanical_devices ) , are concisely summarized by the materials listed under its title on the exhibition checklist : earth , fire , water and oil . The artist , it seems , wants viewers to believe that his piece consists_of four substances very similar to the four elements that were once believed to constitute all physical matter : earth , fire , water and air . In a preposterous game of one-upmanship , Falk proposes that , as an artist , he has outdone the creator of the universe himself . In substituting oil for air , the young sculptor pretends to have made an object more valuable and salable -- and poisonous -- than anything else that exists . The problem with Falk ' s fantasy of grandeur is that he asks viewers to share it . Although the idea that artists are endowed with godlike powers -- capable of miraculous creations and able to give form to inchoate matter -- might be attractive in the studio , it falls_flat in the gallery , especially when it ' s the art ' s main appeal . A series of six small sculptures confirm suspicions of Falk ' s pretensions . Individually titled &quot; Core Sample , &quot; followed by fictitious latitudinal and longitudinal readings , these watered-down , cleaned-up assemblages , placed under glass on expensive metal pedestals , look_like designer rehashes of the style that originated_in California more_than 30 years ago . The fourth piece in this series gives_away Falk ' s game . &quot; Core Sample -- Latitude 120 North , Longitude 43.1 West &quot; describes coordinates that do not exist . Its toothless Surrealism attempts to trick viewers into thinking that its gambit is authentic , and not just a self-conscious pose trying to pass stylized merchandise off as the real_thing . * William Turner Gallery , 69 Market St. , Venice , ( 310 ) 392-8399 , through Sept . 3 . Closed Sundays and Mondays .</TEXT>
