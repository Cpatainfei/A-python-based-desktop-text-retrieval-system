   <HEADLINE> CSUN FOOTBALL ' S CHANCES : 1 IN 4 ; REFERENDUM : THREE OF THE FOUR PROPOSALS WOULD ELIMINATE THE SCHOOL ' S BIGGEST PROGRAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As expected , the fate of four Cal State Northridge athletic programs will be left in the hands of the student body , the school announced Tuesday . After weeks of research , Northridge released four athletics funding scenarios , three of which would result in the elimination of football and include student fee hikes . As detailed Sunday by The Times , football , women ' s basketball , men ' s soccer and men ' s swimming will be cut if any of the referendum options are defeated . After soliciting feedback on the proposals , President Blenda J . Wilson is expected to announce in mid-January which option will be placed on the student ballot . The Associated Students election is set for March 8-9 . The school has failed in two previous attempts to pass referendums this year . &quot; I don ' t know if it ' s going_to work , &quot; Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said . &quot; I ' m hopeful , but we ' re still in the same climate when we asked them to support us last time. &quot; The scenarios , released by Wilson after lengthy analysis by a faculty committee , cover a broad spectrum . The athletic budget_for 1995-96 could range from $ 2.92 million to $ 4.38 million . Athletics , which faces a deficit of $ 700 # 000 next year , currently has a budget of $ 3.6 million . What the referendum options mean to students in terms of what they get for their money : * Under the best-case scenario for athletics , students each would be charged $ 27 each semester and all existing programs would be funded at a higher level . Women ' s soccer also would be added , perhaps for the 1995 fall season . This is the only proposal in which the school ' s NCAA Division I-AA football_team would be retained . Total annual budget : $ 4.38 million . * Under another option , students would pay $ 19 per semester . Football would be cut , but funding for the remaining programs would increase . Women ' s soccer would be added . Total budget : $ 3.84 million . * A third plan calls_for students to pay $ 15 per semester to maintain athletics on a cost-containment level . Football would be axed , but the plan would ensure that all remaining programs would be funded at current or slightly higher levels . Women ' s soccer would be added . Total budget : $ 3.67 million . * There is also a worst-case scenario . If any referendum scheme is shot down by student vote , Northridge would slash athletics to 14 teams , the bare minimum required for Division I membership . Football , women ' s basketball , men ' s soccer and men ' s swimming would be eliminated and women ' s soccer would not be added . Total budget : $ 2.92 million . Hiegert predicted that there is a remote possibility Wilson might choose the worst-case scenario as the best for Northridge -- eliminating the need for another election -- but believes she is committed to staging another referendum . Hiegert conceded that trimming women ' s basketball , a program that has struggled mightily over the past few seasons , would make joining a major conference difficult . Basketball carries the highest annual tab , $ 219 # 000 for 1994-95 , of any women ' s sport . In 1994-95 , the price_tag for men ' s soccer was $ 80 # 000 . Men ' s swimming cost $ 53 # 000 and football cost $ 530 # 000 . Football , which faces elimination under three scenarios , seems in particular jeopardy . &quot; I ' m glad there ' s one ( option ) that has football in it , &quot; Hiegert said . &quot; It ' s hard to keep football in the quotient when you ' re dealing with balancing budgets , gender equity and such. &quot;</TEXT>
