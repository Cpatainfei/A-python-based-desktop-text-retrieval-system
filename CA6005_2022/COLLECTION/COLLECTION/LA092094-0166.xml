   <HEADLINE> JUDGE REJECTS BID TO DISMISS SIMPSON CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito on Monday rejected an attempt to have the murder case against O.J. Simpson dismissed , ruling instead that enough evidence exists to force the football hero to stand trial in the slayings of his ex-wife and her friend . Ito also echoed a ruling by a Municipal Court judge who found that a warrantless search of Simpson ' s estate hours after the killings was legal because officers said they were concerned that other victims might be inside and need help . &quot; The detectives in this situation were confronted with a brutal and violent killing , multiple killings , &quot; Ito said , adding that the officers encountered a number of troubling signs when they arrived_at the house before dawn June 13 . &quot; Under those circumstances , I feel that the actions by the detectives were justified , &quot; Ito said . Motions to dismiss criminal cases at this stage rarely are granted , and defense_attorneys had not held_out much hope of succeeding in the Simpson case , so Ito ' s ruling Monday was widely predicted . The hearing did , however , include a detailed description of the prosecution ' s version of the killings as well as of the latest surprise development in the unfolding murder mystery : Prosecutors revealed that they want to put Simpson ' s longtime assistant , Cathy Randa , on the witness_stand to ask her when and why she shredded documents found during a search of Simpson ' s office . According to prosecutors , the documents discussed domestic abuse and were spotted by a Los Angeles police_detective executing a search_warrant in connection with the investigation of Simpson ' s friend Al Cowlings , who was arrested on suspicion of aiding the football legend when police believe he was trying to flee prosecution . Robert L . Shapiro , one of Simpson ' s lead attorneys , said later that the material consisted_of pamphlets and brochures about domestic violence that Simpson received years ago as part of his court-ordered therapy after a 1989 incident in which he pleaded no contest to spousal battery . The detective attempted to seize the documents Aug . 12 , according to Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark , but was prevented from taking them by one of Simpson ' s lawyers and by a special court-appointed master supervising the execution of the search_warrant . When the officer returned two weeks later with a warrant specifically authorizing him to seize the documents , Randa told him she had shredded them . Ito seemed taken_aback by the disclosure , exclaiming , &quot; Just when I think there are no more surprises ! &quot; But he agreed that Randa could be asked about the shredding and recommended that she have a lawyer with her when she appears . She could be asked to testify as soon as Wednesday , when lawyers will return to the courtroom to argue the defense ' s motion to suppress evidence seized in various searches of Simpson ' s home , cars and office . That issue also touches another volatile topic in the case , however . Defense_attorneys maintain that prosecutors are improperly using the grand_jury investigating Cowlings to conduct further investigation of Simpson , and they will argue later this week that any evidence gathered from Simpson ' s office should be excluded from his case . &quot; This could hurt both sides in different ways , &quot; said Peter Arenella , a UCLA law professor . &quot; It allows the defense to strengthen their case that the grand_jury investigating Al Cowlings is really being used to investigate O.J. Simpson . . . . At the same time , it raises the question of why this document was shredded . You don ' t normally end an argument about an issue like this by destroying evidence. &quot; Before ruling on the motion to dismiss the case , Ito heard more_than two hours of arguments from lawyers on both sides . Simpson , who was in court Monday and spent much of the hearing taking_notes or chatting with attorney Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , has pleaded not_guilty to the murders of Ronald Lyle Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson . If convicted , he could face life in prison without possibility of parole . Shapiro argued that the prosecution had failed to present a coherent theory of the murders during the preliminary hearing , that certain aspects of the prosecution case do not square with each other and that sloppy investigative work has made_it impossible for Simpson to defend himself . &quot; Because the Los Angeles Police_Department detectives on the scene did not follow departmental-approved policy and did not notify the coroner for 10 hours after the bodies had been seized . . . we are forever excluded from knowing what the time of death was , &quot; Shapiro said . &quot; We have been left in a position where the people have deprived us of the absolute right to put_on any real defense to this case. &quot; Elaborating on arguments first aired during the preliminary hearing , Shapiro and Simpson lawyer Gerald F . Uelmen hammered Monday on a number of instances in which they maintain that police and other investigators slipped_up . Uelmen , for instance , accused one of the LAPD detectives of lying five times in preparing an affidavit for a warrant to search Simpson ' s home . That affidavit , Uelmen said , shed_light_on the detectives ' motives during their initial search of Simpson ' s estate . Although detectives later said they had jumped the fence surrounding Simpson ' s property in part because they were concerned about other possible victims inside , the affidavit contains no reference_to entering the property without a warrant . Citing that and other statements in the affidavit , Uelmen said it &quot; gives a very different account than the account presented in the carefully orchestrated testimony that we heard at the preliminary hearing. &quot; Clark conceded that there were mistakes in the affidavit -- at several points , Detective Philip L . Vannatter refers to red spots as &quot; human blood &quot; when that determination was not made until after the warrant was obtained -- but she said the errors were harmless . Even if the errors were corrected , she said , it would not have affected a judge ' s willingness to issue the warrant . Clark also took_aim at the recurring defense contention that a single person could not have committed the killings . She said crime scene evidence in fact suggests that a single killer was responsible , and she maintained , as prosecutors have throughout , that the culprit was Simpson . &quot; You have blood drops accompanied by bloody shoe prints , &quot; she said . &quot; You see only one set of shoe prints leaving that crime scene , not two , leading us to understand that . . . there can only be one perpetrator. &quot; In their effort to persuade Ito to dismiss the case , Simpson ' s attorneys consistently have focused_on what they say are flaws in the case against their client -- a theme they reiterated during Monday ' s hearing . Among other things , they said that whoever committed the killings would almost certainly have been covered in blood , since both victims were repeatedly slashed and stabbed with a knife and their bodies found lying_in deep pools of_their_own blood . &quot; There is no evidence that Mr. Simpson had any blood on him , &quot; Shapiro said . &quot; There is no evidence of any bloody clothing being found. &quot; In addition , Shapiro maintained that it was absurd to believe that Simpson would have carefully discarded certain pieces of evidence , such_as bloody clothing and the murder weapon , and then stupidly brought a bloody glove back to his own home and left it there . &quot; One would have to believe that somebody who was careful enough to get_rid_of all those items of evidence in a very short period_of_time would nevertheless leave one glove at the murder scene and deliberately bring_home and leave on_his_own property a glove that could later be discovered in plain view by anyone who was walking on the property , &quot; Shapiro said . &quot; These are questions that the prosecution must answer , your honor. &quot; Those accusations prompted Clark to deliver a detailed description of the prosecution ' s version of the killings . Her account echoed the version told for months by sources close to the case , but it marked the first time that prosecutors have laid it out_in such detail , and it highlighted the prosecution ' s theory that Simpson meticulously plotted the murder of his ex-wife and only killed Goldman because the young_man came_upon the scene to return a pair of glasses to Nicole Simpson . &quot; Murder is a messy thing , your honor , &quot; Clark said . &quot; There was only one intended target , and that was Nicole Brown . When Ron Goldman showed_up , that was something the defendant didn ' t bargain for. &quot; According to Clark , Goldman and Simpson fought . It was in that struggle that Simpson lost one glove , was cut and had his cap pulled_off , she said . &quot; Evidence was . . . left at the scene because it could not be seen by the defendant in the heat of the moment , &quot; Clark argued . &quot; It was dark , and in point of fact , we see that the ski_cap and the glove are underneath a plant . Did he look_for them ? He probably did , but there was no time to root around that crime scene in_order to find evidence . He had to get_out and get_out fast. &quot; Those mistakes do not suggest that Simpson did not plan the crime or that he did not commit it , Clark added : &quot; The fact that a defendant makes mistakes , leaving evidence behind that allows the police to apprehend him is not the surprise , because if he didn ' t , he would never be caught . . . . If mistakes are not made , criminals are not apprehended. &quot; Simpson ' s lawyers also filed a motion Monday asking Ito to sanction prosecutors for failing to move more quickly on DNA tests that could prove crucial to the case . According to that motion , the Maryland lab running the bulk of the tests has completed its work_on at least five blood samples -- two taken from Simpson ' s home , two from the blood trail near the murder scene and one from Goldman ' s shoe . Sources have said results from the tests completed so far suggest a match between the blood drops at the scene and Simpson ' s blood , while the blood on Goldman ' s shoe was not from Simpson but rather from the victims . The two drops taken from Simpson ' s home also appear to match his blood , but those samples are considered less relevant to the charges against him . In addition , genetic fingerprint tests of two other drops found near the victims were inconclusive . Other DNA tests still may be performed on those items to determine whether those tests yield conclusive findings . With jury selection scheduled to begin Monday , Ito still has not decided whether panelists will be fully sequestered for the duration of the trial , which some have estimated could last six months . The process of contacting prospective jurors already is under way . About 500 have returned questionnaires that inquire about their ability to serve on the case until at least February . The one-page questionnaires ask the jurors if a hardship would be presented if they were partially sequestered -- kept_away from others during the day and allowed to go_home at night -- or fully sequestered -- put_up in a hotel for the duration of the trial . The prosecution has asked Ito to fully sequester the jury once it is picked to keep it away from what is expected to be unprecedented media coverage . The defense has opposed that proposal in a sealed motion . Experts have said that full sequestration might narrow the diversity of the jury , given that the only people who could serve would be those who could be away from their jobs and families for an extended period . In addition , according to experts , fully sequestered juries often lean toward the prosecution . In addition to the one-page hardship questionnaires , jurors will be asked to fill_out extensive questionnaires intended to give Ito and the lawyers some indication of prospective jurors ' suitability to be_on the panel . That process may begin as early as next week .</TEXT>
