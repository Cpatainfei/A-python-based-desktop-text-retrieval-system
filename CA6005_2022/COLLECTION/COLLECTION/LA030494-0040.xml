   <HEADLINE> A MAD RUSSIAN ' S SERIOUS PLAN FOR WAR ; ZHIRINOVSKY : IT ' S AN OPEN BOOK , HIS VISION OF CONQUERING THE MUSLIM WORLD . FOR THE WEST , IT ' S 1930 , WEIMAR TIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For anyone still in doubt that anti-democratic forces now dominate the Russian Parliament , the 253-67 vote granting amnesty to those who tried to overthrow Boris Yeltsin should be instructive . While U.S. pundits have been worrying about the future of market reform in Russia , the real issue facing Russians is who is most likely to inherit Yeltsin ' s mantle . The answer , provided by an authoritative survey conducted in December , is Vladimir Zhirinovsky . When respondents were asked_for whom they would vote if Yeltsin were not on the list of candidates , Zhirinovsky was an undisputed favorite , leaving far behind both the leading reformer , Yegor Gaidar , and the leading proponent of slow-paced reform , Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin . To date the American media have treated Zhirinovsky on the same anecdotal level as Hitler was viewed in the 1920s -- that is , as an enfant_terrible of politics , a quarrelsome clown and a brawler rather than as a man who has a pretty good shot at determining one day the geopolitical course of a nuclear superpower . Once again , as 70 years ago , we prefer to think that the current Russian government ' s financial mismanagement , as in Weimar Germany , can only give the respectable reformers a chance to return to the helm -- and then we will support them more effectively than we did before . But given the total collapse of Russia ' s industry , already equivalent_to the devastation of the Great Depression ( and which the reformers did not even start to address ) , it seems too late for such rosy scenarios . Instead , it is much more likely that any further mismanagement will only pave the way for Zhirinovsky . If Zhirinovsky becomes president of Russia , it would mean another world_war -- I personally do not doubt this . His Hitlerian geopolitical plan , worked_out by the strategists of Moscow ' s general_staff , is set_forth in his book , &quot; The Last March to the South. &quot; First of all , Zhirinovsky does not believe that the current Russian crisis can be resolved in the domestic arena . Like Hitler , he sees the &quot; salvation of the nation &quot; in war and conquest . But not in a nuclear war , and not in one with either the West or with China . His quarrel is with the Muslim world ( the only exception being his current friend , ally and financier , Saddam Hussein ) . Its riches , and especially its oil , he promises , would save Russia . He recognizes that &quot; some people &quot; in Tehran , Ankara or Riyadh may object to their countries becoming Russian provinces , &quot; but the whole world should think that if Russia needs it -- it is for the best. &quot; Besides , he notes , &quot; the majority of mankind is interested in dissecting the Muslim world . The Muslim peril has to be eliminated. &quot; This would supposedly be Russia ' s greatest service to modern civilization . Moreover , the Russian army ' s &quot; last march to the south would lead it to the shores of the Indian_Ocean and to the Mediterranean , and mean liberation for 20 million Kurds , hundreds of thousands of Baluchis ( and ) Pushtuns. &quot; To be sure , this would be &quot; the last redivision of the world and thus has to be done as a form of shock_therapy -- suddenly , swiftly , effectively. &quot; &quot; Our army , &quot; Zhirinovsky continues , &quot; is capable of this , all_the more so since this is the only way of survival for the nation . And it will be the basis for the rejuvenation of the Russian army . The new military can be reborn only in the course of a military operation . An army degenerates in the barracks . It needs a goal , a great task . It needs to exercise its muscle . This would be purification for all_of us . And the ringing of the Russian Orthodox bells on the shores of the Indian_Ocean and the Mediterranean would be the sound of peace for the people of the region. &quot; Such , in the briefest of outlines , is Zhirinovsky ' s &quot; Mein Kampf. &quot; The first impression is certainly the same that one gets from reading Hitler ' s opus : The man is certifiably insane . It is as easy to discard Zhirinovsky ' s book in the 1990s as it was to dismiss Hitler ' s in the 1920s . For one thing , what does he think the rest of the world would do while his armies marched to the oil fields of the Middle_East in_order to monopolize this vital strategic resource ? But wait . Zhirinovsky has a quite impressive answer to this . According to him , the rest of the world would do precisely what it did when Hitler ' s armies marched around Europe -- nothing . This is what Russia ' s &quot; nuclear shield &quot; is all about : to ensure a new Munich on the part of the West . And , indeed , would any Western government risk annihilation for the sake of Turkey , let alone Iran ? All other Russian leaders , beginning with Mikhail Gorbachev , have politely asked the world for aid . The results are evident : Russia is perishing . Zhirinovsky threatens to take what he needs by force . And if it means a world_war , so be it . Perhaps the only , possibly fateful , blunder he has made is to let the world know too early what he has in_store for it . &quot; I see Russian soldiers preparing_for their last march to the south . I see Russian commanders tracing on their maps the routes to the final destination . I see airborne planes in our southern regions . I see submarines coming_to the surface at the shores of the Indian_Ocean . I see our marines landing on these shores where the soldiers of the Russian army are already marching , and armored vehicles moving along with tremendous masses of tanks. &quot; Of course , in getting_to the oil-rich Middle_East , Russia ' s armies would have to march through the former Soviet_Union ' s southern , largely Muslim , territories , and this is also something Zhirinovsky has very much in mind -- their reconquest , accompanied , no doubt , by a little ethnic cleansing . But here , too , in light of Europe and the United States ' slow response to Bosnia , Zhirinovsky may be placing a shrewd bet . There are still months , perhaps years , before this nightmarish vision becomes reality . Russia is only at about 1930 on the Weimar scale . The suicidal plan can still be derailed . But will the world read Zhirinovsky ' s &quot; Mein Kampf &quot; any more attentively than it did Hitler ' s ? It may rather lull itself with a comfortable dream that reformers are somehow coming_back to the helm in Moscow , without doing anything to make that happen .</TEXT>
