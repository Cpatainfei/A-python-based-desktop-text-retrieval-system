   <HEADLINE> ' 90S FAMILY ; REAL_LIFE ; CAN DIVORCES BE CIVILIZED FOR THE SAKE OF THE KIDS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lately , more voices are being raised in favor of staying_together for the sake of the children . The notion of a &quot; good divorce &quot; when children are involved seems a selfish rationalization left over from the human potential movement of the ' 60s . Yet , as the average length of marriage has dropped to six years and serial monogamy becomes more popular , many individuals and some jurisdictions are pursuing a ' 90s definition of the good divorce -- also for the sake of the children . Like many divorced parents , Geoff , now 35 , and Barbara Lipscomb , 37 , couldn ' t see past their own emotions in the beginning . Married for five years , they separated three years ago . At the time , their son , Colin , was only 2 . &quot; It was bitter and angry in the beginning , &quot; recalled Barbara , who had planned a future for herself as a stay-at-home mom . &quot; I was angry he left and shocked , rejected and hurt. &quot; There were practical things to take_care of : lawyers , moving , a new preschool , a new job , new child-care arrangements . And there was Colin . &quot; I think it ' s heartbreaking for the child . The hardest part was to hear him say , ' I wish you and me and Daddy all lived together. ' &quot; It took nine months before she would even agree to talk with Geoff . With the help of a court-appointed mediator , they ironed_out custody and visitation disagreements and now talk_about their son ' s needs and development at least three times a week . They attend school events together . They say they never criticize each other in front of their child . They have even spent Christmas together . &quot; Most people , I think , are surprised , &quot; Geoff said . Contrary to popular belief , a number of parents have learned ways to continue to raising their children together effectively , said Constance Ahrons , associate director of the Marriage and Family Therapy Program at USC . &quot; The truth is , 50 % of divorces do not do long-term damage to children or adults , &quot; said Ahrons , whose book &quot; The Good Divorce &quot; ( HarperCollins ) is scheduled to be published in the fall . Ahrons said she studied 98 families in the Midwest that she found through court records . She interviewed them three times over five years , the last in 1985 . The children were not interviewed . &quot; About 50 % fell_into what is the negative stereotype , &quot; she said . &quot; They were still angry or litigating . But 50 % were not doing that . They got_on_with trying to resolve it , finding ways to effectively handle their parenting . &quot; The research clearly indicates the damage done to children is done_in bad marriages prior to divorce , not so_much the divorce itself , &quot; said Ahrons , who struggled to attain a civilized divorce herself . Although she and her ex-husband never became friendly after the divorce , they did manage a holiday dinner or two and when their daughter married , walked her down the aisle together . Lessening the impact of divorce is complicated . The overriding rule is that children should never become caught in the cross-fire between the parents . They need to be reassured that they are not the cause of the divorce and that while there will be changes , both parents will still love them and take_care of them . One of the more important tools in a good divorce , Ahrons said , is compromise . Colin sees his father every_other weekend plus Wednesday nights . Barbara learned to consult Geoff on arrangements she made , such_as changing preschools . Geoff sends the child_support check on_time . When Colin is_sick , sometimes he takes the day_off to stay with him . More parents can have civilized divorces if society expects them to , Ahrons believes . Several jurisdictions are experimenting with mandating &quot; parenting plans &quot; when couples with_children divorce . Under the state of Washington ' s 1987 Parenting Act , divorcing parents must file a parenting plan that delineates a dispute resolution process , allocation of decision-making authority and residential provisions for holidays , birthdays , vacations and other special events . Exceptions are allowed_in cases of abuse . While mandated parenting plans resemble the old joint custody and visitation arrangements , supporters believe that the new language will help parents see their roles in terms of responsibility rather than of control . Geoff said that in some ways , a good divorce is not that much different from a good marriage : &quot; It takes a lot of work. &quot; * Do you have a family issue , a problem or a solution , for exploration in this column ?
