   <HEADLINE> NEW RULES ENDORSED IN DOMESTIC ABUSE CASES ; CRIME : SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE . POLICE WILL PHOTOGRAPH AND TAPE VICTIMS IN CASE THEY LATER CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT PRESSING CHARGES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County police agencies have agreed on guidelines for investigating domestic violence cases -- a move that is expected to result in more successful prosecutions , officials say . Under the new countywide policy , officers answering domestic violence calls will tape victims ' statements so that prosecutions can continue even if the victims change their minds . All wounds and bruises will be photographed . And details of the crime scene , such_as torn clothing and overturned furniture , will be included in the officer ' s report . In a related move , the district_attorney ' s office has assigned an additional prosecutor and investigator to handle domestic violence cases , and Oxnard police have for the first time formed a two-person unit whose primary focus will be spousal abuse . &quot; We ' re just assigning a higher priority to these kinds of cases , &quot; said Oxnard Police Cmdr . Tom Cady , who led the effort to develop the policy . &quot; Research shows that batterers tend to come from families where they saw battering occur . If we can break that cycle of violence in the home , maybe we will also see a diminishing of the violence in the communities. &quot; The new guidelines , contained in a 25-page booklet , were developed by a committee of the Ventura County Domestic Violence Task_Force . Chief_Assistant Dist . Atty . Colleen Toy White said the task_force was assembled in 1991 to take a broad look_at ways to reduce domestic violence . Recently , the county has witnessed several high-profile spousal-abuse cases , most notably the January , 1993 , beating death of JoAnn Linkenauger . The Sheriff ' s Department came under_fire in that case for failing to take action on several earlier complaints of violence . Officials say the new policy and other changes were in the works when those incidents occurred . &quot; We just saw this as an area where we could do_better , &quot; White said . In addition to adding another attorney , the district_attorney ' s office has changed the way that it prosecutes domestic violence . A special unit now handles all those cases , rather than allowing them to be mixed among other misdemeanors and felonies assigned to different prosecutors . Jamie Leigh , executive_director of the Ventura County Coalition Against Household Violence , said she hopes that the new police policy will mean that all abuse victims in Ventura County are treated the same , regardless of where they live . &quot; It is really much more effective if you have a protocol countywide , so that everyone makes an effort to respond the same way , &quot; she said . * Leigh said she believes that there are small differences rather than &quot; major gaps &quot; in the way police_departments in Ventura County approach the problem . &quot; We really are , all things considered , fairly progressive , &quot; she said . &quot; All the entities tend to make an effort to support one another. &quot; Cady said the new policy , which went_into effect late last year , does not differ much from what is already taught in police_academies . But it does place greater responsibility on patrol officers to do investigative work that may prove crucial to a prosecution if a victim later refuses to cooperate , he said . The booklet gives detailed instructions on when a suspect should be arrested and advice for women seeking an emergency protective order . Officers are also prohibited from asking victims whether they want to press charges . To help collect evidence , all patrol officers in Oxnard now carry tape_recorders , and the department recently purchased additional 35-millimeter cameras for photographing evidence . &quot; We have a commitment by the district_attorney ' s office that if we gather information where they can move forward on a case , even if a victim changes her mind , they will go_ahead and prosecute , &quot; Cady said . * The number of felony spousal-abuse cases that have gone_to court has increased from 10 in 1989 to 41 in 1992 . Misdemeanor filings have risen from 54 in 1989 to 217 in 1992 . For each of the past five years , police_departments in Ventura County have received about 4 # 200 to 4 # 500 reports of domestic violence . Such calls are considered the most dangerous part of a patrol officer ' s duties and a high burnout area for prosecutors because of the number of victims who refuse to cooperate . Along with the police guidelines , the Ventura County Domestic Violence Task_Force has developed a pilot_program to assist emergency_room doctors and nurses with reporting suspected abuse . Experts say such an effort is important because domestic violence is the most common cause of women ' s injuries in emergency_rooms , placing hospital personnel in a unique position to report battering . &quot; Physicians oftentimes know ( that ) what the victim is saying is not consistent with what the injury is , &quot; Leigh said . The pilot_program uses a three-part form for reporting abuse . One copy is given to the victim , another goes_in a medical file and the third is given to the police agency where the victim lives . Officials hope to have the forms in all county hospitals later this year . Domestic violence diversion programs are also expected to see changes within the next few months . Under a state law that takes_effect July 1 , the number of required counseling sessions will be increased and the time_period for completing the sessions will be shortened .</TEXT>
