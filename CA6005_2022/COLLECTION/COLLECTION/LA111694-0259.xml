   <HEADLINE> DOLLAR-BASED TRADE SURPLUS IS AT A TURNING POINT , JAPAN OFFICIALS SAY ; COMMERCE : AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT MONTHS , THE NATION ' S SURPLUS WITH THE UNITED STATES FALLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan declared Tuesday that its dollar-based trade surplus is at a turning point and headed for a decrease after shrinking for the third month in a row in October . However , officials and economists said they do not expect future falls to be faster than in the August-October quarter because Japan ' s exports may grow steadily on strong overseas demand , outstripping the growth in imports . October also marked the first time in eight months that Japan ' s dollar trade surplus with the United States fell . The politically sensitive surplus with Washington fell 6.8 % to an unadjusted $ 4.79 billion from a year ago . The overall customs-cleared trade surplus fell to an unadjusted $ 9.28 billion in October from $ 10.93 billion a year earlier . That was within private economists ' forecasts , which had ranged from $ 9.2 billion to $ 10.9 billion . The trade surplus &quot; is at a turning point . It has fallen year-on-year for three straight months , or one quarter , &quot; a Ministry of Finance official said after the release of the October data . But the official added that it is not clear whether the surplus will fall without exception in future months , or whether its downward trend will be uneven . After adjusting for seasonal factors , the October surplus widened to $ 8.65 billion from $ 8.46 billion a month earlier , the ministry said . The official said the year-on-year decrease in October owed much to growing imports from the United States , the European Union and Asian_nations . The official said it was still unclear how much of a role currency fluctuations and oil prices played , but said imports were boosted mainly by purchases of automobiles , aircraft , clothing and semiconductors . In volume terms , automobile imports doubled from a year earlier in October while vehicle exports grew 3.1 % . Imports of semiconductors and related parts grew 44 % year-on-year in dollar terms . Imports of crude_oil grew 13.1 % year-on-year . The trend of replacing domestic products with imports is likely to continue , depending_on the pace of a recovery in the domestic economy , economists said . In October , exports totaled $ 34.62 billion ; imports were $ 25.34 billion .</TEXT>
