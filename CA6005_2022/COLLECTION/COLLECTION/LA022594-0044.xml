   <HEADLINE> TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART : CBS ' NUMBERS AS GOOD AS KERRIGAN ' S</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nancy Kerrigan got some impressive numbers Wednesday night , but the numbers CBS got are even more impressive . The first to come_out Thursday were a 49.7 overnight rating and a 64 share for the nation ' s 30 largest markets . Later came the national numbers -- a 48.5 rating and a 64 share . That means that Wednesday night ' s Winter_Olympics prime-time coverage on CBS was watched in 48.5 % of all television households in the country and in 64 % of the homes where televisions were_on . Each rating point represents 1 % of the nation ' s 94.2 million television households . If the 49.7 had held_up , that would have been a record for sports events . Super Bowl XVI , in which San Francisco beat Cincinnati on Jan . 24 , 1982 , got a 49.1. The 49.7 would also have been the fourth-highest rating of all time . As it is , the 48.5 ranks No . 6 , with two Super Bowls , including the one in 1983 , still ahead of Wednesday night ' s Games . CBS estimated that Wednesday night ' s Olympic program was watched by 110 # 530 , 000 , ranking it No . 8 in audience size . No . 1 was this year ' s Super Bowl , which drew an estimated 134 # 840 , 000 viewers . The rating was a 45.5. Super Bowl audiences correlate higher because of parties and gatherings in one household . Six Super Bowl audiences were larger than the one CBS drew Wednesday night , as was the the total of 121 # 624 , 000 for the last episode of &quot; MASH. &quot; Through 12 nights of the Olympics , CBS has averaged a 27.6 rating and a 41 share_in prime_time . At this juncture two years ago at Albertville , CBS was averaging a 19.2 and a 30 share . The record for a Winter_Olympics is a 23.9 rating and a 37 share_in 1980 . The record for any Olympics is a 24.4 rating and a 44 share for the Summer Games in 1972 . Kerrigan is going_for the gold tonight , but with Tonya Harding virtually out of the running for a medal it ' s doubtful that the rating will top 48.5. But you never know . Suddenly , figure_skating is big , very big . * Bargain price : CBS paid $ 295 million for the rights to the Lillehammer Games and last month agreed to pay $ 375 million for the 1998 Winter_Olympics at Nagano , Japan . Turns_out that is a bargain . The record ratings CBS is getting_at Lillehammer means it will be able to increase ad rates for Nagano . CBS charged $ 325 # 000 for 30-second spots before the Games . It is charging $ 430 # 000 for the few spots it held_back for &quot; make-goods &quot; in case of lower ratings than had been guaranteed . But sponsors for the ' 98 Games might not be willing to pay much more_than that -- unless there ' s another Harding-Kerrigan type of incident . And there may never again be anything like that , at least nothing that would get the same kind of media coverage . * Add ratings : Even though TNT didn ' t show Harding , Kerrigan or any of the other top competitors Wednesday on its daytime coverage , which also included the U.S.-Finland hockey_game , the cable network still got a 4.1 rating and drew 2.5 million viewers . that ' s TNT ' s highest Olympic rating , and four times higher than TNT ' s normal daytime rating . TNT also had weekday coverage from Albertville two years ago . Today , TNT will again offer figure_skating , minus the top names , plus the Canada-Finland hockey_game . A word of warning to viewers not wanting to know results before the prime-time show on CBS : TNT will air periodic updates throughout its coverage . * Radio coverage : KNX will again carry CBS Radio ' s live coverage of Harding and Kerrigan today . Harding will skate 14th at 11:55 a.m. , PST , and Kerrigan 20th at 12:35 p.m. The first broadcast will be 10 minutes , the second 55 minutes . Figure_skating on radio isn ' t too thrilling , but radio commentator Paul Wylie , working with Mark Champion , was quicker to point_out Harding ' s mistakes Wednesday than was television commentator Scott Hamilton that night . * Complaint Dept. : CBS may be drawing huge audiences , but the network is also drawing complaints in record numbers . The delayed , edited telecasts are a pet peeve . &quot; They come_across as phony , as more theater than sports , &quot; one reader complained . The constant teasing is another big complaint . &quot; Bonnie Blair ( or whoever ) coming_up &quot; usually means coming_up sometime in the next hour or two . More honesty and a better format are needed . Of course , people complain about all_the commercials . Blame the International Olympic Committee and the high rights fees for this one . A lot of people also believe there are an excessive number of features and off-beat reports . CBS seems determined to use all_of the 150 or so features it prepared_for the Games . Although some features should have been left on the shelf , others have been excellent . Two of the best were the one Wednesday night on figure skater Oksana Baiul of the Ukraine and the one Tuesday night with Charles Kuralt on the destruction of a Nazi heavy-water plant in occupied Norway 50 years ago . The plant was essential to Hitler ' s plans for an atomic_bomb . Speaking of Kuralt , CBS should be using him more . As for prime-time host Greg Gumbel , there have been few complaints , which indicates he is doing a good job . Overall , give CBS ' coverage a B-minus . Televising an Olympics and keeping everybody happy is difficult , if not impossible . TV-Radio Notes ESPN ' s second ESPY award ceremony will be televised Monday at 6 p.m. Dennis Miller is the host , and nominees include Mike Piazza , Wayne Gretzky , and Troy Aikman . This show will be hard-pressed to top last year ' s , when the late Jim Valvano , helped to the podium by Dick Vitale and Mike Krzyzewski , delivered an impassioned speech . Vitale , in Los Angeles this week for Thursday night ' s UCLA-California game , said the amazing thing was that Valvano could barely speak either the day before or the day after , and wasn ' t even planning to attend the ceremony . &quot; He got_up there and must have gotten a real adrenaline rush , &quot; Vitale said . &quot; We didn ' t think he could even get_to the podium . They were going_to mike him at his seat , but he asked Coach K and I to help him up there. &quot; Proceeds from the ESPYs go_to the V Foundation , established in the honor of Valvano to further cancer research . The winter Arbitron trends came_out this week , and the news was semi-good for KMPC . The station ' s overall share for all people 12 and over went from a 0.7 to a 0.8 , and all-day parts showed slight increases . But KMPC , still recovering from the days of a 0.1 share_in the morning , is getting beat across the board by XTRA in Los Angeles , 1.6-1.4 , with men 18-plus . In San Diego , XTRA got a 5.7 share with men 18-plus . . . . The proposed sale of KMPC to Cap Cities still hasn ' t been finalized , but when it is , the staff at KMPC will move to a building owned by Gene and Jackie Autry near Universal City until Cap Cities takes_control . The eventual plan is to base the new KMPC at the revamped KABC studios on La Cienega Boulevard . Cap Cities apparently will change the format from all-sports to &quot; smart talk , &quot; but officials will not confirm that until the sale goes_through . &quot; Rise and Walk : the Dennis Byrd Story &quot; will be televised by the Fox network Monday at 8 p.m. , and tonight Byrd will be the host of &quot; Fox Night at the Movies. &quot; The movie tonight is &quot; Hot Shots ! &quot; The host for Byrd ' s movie will be John Madden , making his Fox debut . . . . Plans for Magic Johnson ' s one-on-one interview show on Fox have been completed . The first show will be_on March 15 with guests Roseanne and Tom Arnold , Whoopi Goldberg , Garth Brooks and Shaquille O ' Neal . Arsenio Hall is executive producer of the show .
