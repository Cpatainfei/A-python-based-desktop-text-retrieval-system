   <HEADLINE> IS AMERICA READY FOR ' NATURAL BORN KILLAZ ' ? ; THE STORY LINE OF DR . DRE AND ICE_CUBE ' S MUSIC VIDEO IS CERTAIN TO ENRAGE MEDIA WATCHDOGS ON TWO LEVELS : THE GRAPHIC VIOLENCE DEPICTED IN THE DUO ' S MURDEROUS EXPLOITS , AND THE IDENTITIES OF THEIR VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s midnight on Terminal Island and rap stars Dr. Dre and Ice_Cube are dancing on a blood-drenched pile of bones and body_parts . Standing on dual electric_chairs surrounded by dangling corpses , the brawny rappers bob their shaved heads and boast about a brutal murder spree as the cameras begin rolling on what promises to be the most talked_about music video of the year : &quot; Natural Born Killaz. &quot; The story line -- in which the rappers portray ruthless serial_killers -- is certain to enrage media watchdogs on two levels : the graphic violence depicted in the duo ' s murderous exploits , and the identities of their victims . In the video , the rappers satirize the gruesome stabbings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman , as well as the shotgun ambush of Jose and Kitty Menendez -- all_of whom die in dramatic re-enactments at the hands of Dre and Cube . The song ' s lyrics also spoof the recent suicide of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain , the 1969 Manson family murders , and seem to make light of the vicious assault on trucker Reginald O . Denny during the 1992 Los Angeles riots . Sample lines : I ' m down with Dre like A.C. is for O.J. . . . so kill Charlie Manson I snatch him out his truck hit him with a brick and I ' m dancin ' . . . . . . I ' m gonna eat ' em up like Jeffrey Dahmer and now I ' m suicidal just like Nirvana . &quot; Natural Born Killaz &quot; is the first single from Dre and Cube ' s much anticipated reunion album , &quot; Helter Skelter , &quot; due out_in January on Death Row / Priority label . ( The song is currently available on the soundtrack to &quot; Murder Was the Case , &quot; a short film directed by Dre and starring his Long_Beach protege Snoop Doggy Dogg. ) In an interview during a break from filming at an abandoned factory on the San Pedro waterfront , Dre defended the parody as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the public ' s obsession with unsolved high-profile murders . &quot; Shock value -- that ' s what it ' s about , &quot; said the 28-year-old Grammy-winning recording artist , whose real name is Andre Young . &quot; Everybody knows that the most exciting thing going_down in the news right now is O.J. ' s case . So we decided to play_on that and the Menendez trial too -- and just have a little fun with it all . People can think whatever they want about me , but the fact is I ' m just an artist doing my best to entertain. &quot; Ice_Cube , an acclaimed rapper and actor who co-starred in &quot; Boyz N the Hood , &quot; also downplayed potential negative fallout from the song . &quot; It ' s true that it ' s a b-boy gangsta record on the macabre tip , &quot; said Cube , 25 , whose real name is O ' shea Jackson . &quot; But what would be the point of Ice_Cube and Dr. Dre doing a project like this if we didn ' t freak people out ? The point of the song is to poke_fun at serial_killers , like Oliver Stone ' s movie did . It ' s supposed to be humorous. &quot; While the video is not expected to be released until Halloween , the parody concept is already under_attack by the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau , a nonprofit group that has lobbied California lawmakers for pro-victims rights legislation . &quot; We live_in a sick society and it ' s horrendous for an artist as big as Dr. Dre to put_out something this irresponsible , &quot; said Kelly Rudiger , the Crime Victims Bureau executive_director . &quot; How would Dr. Dre like it if somebody made_fun of his relatives getting murdered ? &quot; Relatives of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman could not be reached for comment , but representatives for the families expressed outrage Wednesday about the video . &quot; Ridiculing the tragedy surrounding a murder victim is very hurtful to the families of anyone closely involved in such a case , &quot; said Terri Towery , a court-appointed attorney representing Lyle Menendez in his upcoming murder trial . &quot; Entertainers certainly have free speech rights , but sometimes it can cross the boundaries of good taste. &quot; This isn ' t the first time Dre and Cube have raised eyebrows in the music industry . Before embarking_on solo careers , the duo made a name for itself as the creative force behind NWA , the brash Compton rap quintet once accused by an FBI official of writing music that encouraged violence against law_enforcement officers . Previous hit albums by the two rappers were also attacked by feminists and ethnic_groups for promoting violence against women , Koreans and Jews . At the same time , however , Dre and Cube have been repeatedly singled_out by pop critics as , respectively , hip-hop music ' s most talented producer and lyricist . Dre , who has been charged with battery three times in as_many years and will soon begin serving a five-month jail sentence for drunk driving , shrugs_off criticism of his angry music . &quot; I could care less whether the pop people think my music is too crazy , &quot; said Dre , whose Death Row record label has sold more_than 10 million records in the past two years . ( Death Row is distributed by Time Warner-affiliated Interscope Records. ) &quot; I didn ' t get where I am by catering to mainstream tastes . I started_out by making my art for the underground and I still subscribe_to that theory today. &quot; Heading back for the set , Cube also defended the violence employed in their latest collaboration . &quot; Of course we ' re exploiting violence , but there ' s nothing unusual about that in America , &quot; Cube said . &quot; This country ' s national_anthem is_full of rockets ' red glare and bombs bursting in air . that ' s just the way America is , so why shouldn ' t Dre and Cube be able to exploit a little violence every now and then ? If people don ' t like it , let ' em ban it . Who cares ? &quot;</TEXT>
