Muhammad , 43 , had been suspended from his duties as senior aide to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan after a speech in November in which he called Jews &quot; the bloodsuckers of the black nation and the black community. &quot; That speech was denounced by President Clinton and other black and Jewish leaders , as well as by Farrakhan himself . On Sunday night , Muhammad had spoken_to a crowd of about 1 # 000 at the Vision Complex theater in Los Angeles . He offered no apology for his past remarks , warning the few whites in the audience that his speech would be &quot; a rough ride. &quot; Muhammad accused Jews of becoming involved in the civil_rights movement in an attempt to advance their own interests and said their involvement had actually hindered black progress .</TEXT>
