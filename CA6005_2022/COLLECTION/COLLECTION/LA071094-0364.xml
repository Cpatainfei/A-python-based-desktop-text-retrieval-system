   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; SIMPSON MURDER CASE ; EQUAL JUSTICE -- AND A DEFENDANT WITH THE MONEY TO EXERCISE EVERY RIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tens of millions of Americans watched at least part of the televised preliminary hearing in the O.J. Simpson case , making_it by far the largest program of mass education in courtroom procedures in the nation ' s history . But the version of criminal practice that viewers have seen resembles the real_thing only to the same extent that a pristine architect ' s model of a cityscape -- perfectly tidy , immaculately clean and expensively detailed -- resembles the messy squalor of an actual city street . The average preliminary hearing takes less than a day , often less than an hour , and the defense preparations are often similarly perfunctory . By contrast , from the debate over how many hairs could be plucked from Simpson ' s head -- a procedure that most defendants undergo summarily , and roughly , without benefit of judicial supervision -- to the detailed , although ultimately unsuccessful , presentation of a motion to suppress evidence , People vs . Simpson has shown the public a defendant with the money to fully exercise every right provided to him under the Constitution . Simpson is the most famous defendant ever arrested for murder in the United States , and for most middle-class Americans , his ordeal is as close as they ever will come_to having a loved one on_trial . For many Americans , the televised hearing may have served as a form of catharsis for the traumatic events surrounding the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman and the downfall of a man who was a hero to millions . That sort of catharsis -- along with a guarantee of fairness to the defendant -- are the traditional reasons why our system has always provided open , public trials . In this case , the cathartic function of the hearing has been enhanced by the unusual speed with which the case has come_to court . In most cases , months , sometimes years , elapse between the crime and the giving of public testimony . Most preliminary hearings consist_of little more_than a low-ranking police_officer reading someone else ' s report . And even that seldom begins , as this hearing did , barely three weeks after the criminal act . To the public , that delay often frustrates the desire for a trial to provide closure for an awful event . This time , however , the testimony took_place while the underlying events are still fresh , intensively so , in the public mind . The freshness of the testimony could be seen in the court proceedings , particularly the sometimes fumbling testimony of key witnesses . Prosecutors clearly did not have time to coach witnesses on how best to provide their recollections . The testimony , at times , had a note of spontaneity usually missing from trials . But those who sat glued to their television screens watching this hearing unfold should not mistake this case -- or other high-profile courtroom dramas such_as the recent Menendez brothers ' trial -- for what normally goes_on in the nation ' s courtrooms . Thirty-eight years ago , Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote that &quot; there can be no equal justice when the kind of trial a man gets depends_on the amount_of_money he has. &quot; But Black ' s admonition remains a hope , not a reality . Consider for a moment the case of People vs . Mayfield , tried a_few years ago in San Bernardino and recently upheld by the state ' s highest_court . Like Simpson , Demetrie L . Mayfield was a black defendant accused of killing a woman he knew well and a man who appears to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time . And like Simpson , he faced the possibility of the death_penalty . that ' s about where the similarity ends . Simpson ' s lead attorney , Robert L . Shapiro , has assembled a team of half_a_dozen lawyers plus forensic pathologists , criminal investigators , analysts and paralegals to defend his client . Already , the attorneys have spent hundreds of hours in preparing the case , and the bill is expected to run_into the millions of dollars . Mayfield ' s attorney , by contrast , practiced alone . According to court records , his entire preparation for the case encompassed 40 hours . The attorney conducted only one substantive interview with his client -- on the morning the trial began . Lawyers who appealed Mayfield ' s conviction argued , as is often done_in capital cases , that the low level of representation Mayfield got violated his right , under the Constitution ' s 6th Amendment , to have the &quot; effective assistance of counsel. &quot; Because of a series of Supreme Court decisions that have lowered the standard for what &quot; effective assistance &quot; means , those claims are increasingly difficult to make . In Mayfield ' s case , appellate judges conceded that the defense was less than zealous but concluded that no harm had been done . The evidence was so overwhelming that no defense would have helped much anyway , the courts ruled . Mayfield now sits on Death Row . Mayfield ' s case is hardly the worst . After all , his conviction has withstood attack . Despite the Supreme Court ' s lowered standards , the level of criminal defense remains so poor , particularly in Southern states , but at times in California as well , that appellate judges in some cases have no choice but to overturn convictions and death_penalties on grounds that the lawyers were simply incompetent . Indeed , our entire system , with its understaffed prosecutors ' offices , overcrowded court dockets and harried public_defenders , survives only because of a seldom-acknowledged bargain : We provide extensive rights to criminal defendants in theory , but do so in a system that usually allows only the affluent to employ those rights in practice . If every accused defended himself as Simpson has done , the criminal justice system would rapidly collapse under the strain . Although Simpson ' s case shows what money can get a defendant , it also has so far demonstrated the limits to what money can buy . Simpson sat , day after day , at the defense table with the dulled , vacant expression so common to men caught_up in the toils of the law . Television viewers could see an occasional tensing of his jaw muscles as the testimony rolled on , but as a defendant , he must remain passive in the face of the accusations against him . Defense_attorneys realize the danger -- that passivity begins to turn a defendant into an object . So Simpson ' s lawyers eventually provided him with paper and a pen to take_notes , giving him at least some activity to pursue . Although the defense_lawyers could do that , they were unable to do much else to slow the steady development of the state ' s case during the six-day preliminary hearing . The hearing shredded Simpson ' s alibi , provided damaging physical evidence linking him to the crime scene -- the bloodstained glove , for example -- and , most important , revealed blood_test results that strongly , although not conclusively , tie him to the murders . When Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell on Friday bound Simpson over for trial , she said there was &quot; ample evidence to establish the strong suspicion of the guilt of the accused. &quot; In effect , as we live with this case for months , we may well find that this hearing was the real trial on the issue of guilt and that the only questions left will concern Simpson ' s mental_state and whether with so famous and well-liked a defendant , a jury will be inclined to grant mercy .</TEXT>
