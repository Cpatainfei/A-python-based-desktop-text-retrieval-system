   <HEADLINE> MASSIVE ASBESTOS CLEANUP UNDERWAY AT MALL ; AFTERMATH : NORTHRIDGE FASHION CENTER WILL REMOVE EVERY FIBER OF CARCINOGEN . OWNER HOPES CLEAN IMAGE WILL BOOST BUSINESS UPON REOPENING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A few hours after the Jan . 17 earthquake , John Graham , vice_president of property management at MEPC American Properties Inc. , owner of the Northridge Fashion Center mall , made an urgent phone_call from his Dallas office . &quot; I ' m willing to bet there ' s asbestos in there , laying on the floors &quot; of the shopping_mall , Graham told Lou Magnifico , construction manager at Professional Service_Industries Inc. , an asbestos abatement firm in Walnut . Magnifico hurried that day to the mall and took pictures of the heaps of fallen ceiling tiles and drywall . When Graham saw the photos , he spotted the telltale gray , fluffy material amid the rubble and said , &quot; Uh-oh. &quot; And so began a massive , multimillion-dollar asbestos cleanup and abatement effort at the Northridge mall , located about a mile from the epicenter and by far the most badly quake-damaged shopping_center . Two other shopping_malls , Topanga Plaza in Woodland Hills and Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood , have also undergone asbestos cleanups in the wake of the temblor , although nothing rivaling the undertaking at the Northridge mall , where the plan is to remove every bit of the remaining cancer-causing substance -- even that which wasn ' t dislodged in the quake . &quot; Asbestos is an emotional subject , &quot; Graham acknowledged . Even though asbestos is considered safe if it is properly maintained , &quot; our corporate philosophy is just take it out. &quot; MEPC , a subsidiary of British real_estate concern MEPC PLC , purchased the Northridge Fashion Center in December as part of a $ 302-million acquisition of several American holdings . Now MEPC is hoping to turn its bad_luck into opportunity . When the mall reopens in July -- minus its six department_stores , which will take longer to rebuild -- MEPC hopes to publicize its squeaky-clean shopping_center . Asbestos is present in more_than half of all commercial and residential buildings 15 years or older , authorities say , and in some younger than that . Asbestos has several positive properties , including being resistant to heat and very durable . Unfortunately , in recent decades it has been discovered that when asbestos materials are moved or broken , they can release microscopic fibers into the air . If inhaled , these fibers can cause lung disease and other cancers . The substance is considered safe when left intact . In any building containing asbestos , experts say , it is necessary to test the air to see how many particles might have shaken free in the earthquake . Air_pumps with filtering devices are used in the testing . If high levels of airborne asbestos are found , a cleanup might include misting the air to weigh_down floating particles , wet wiping hard_surfaces and using big vacuums with special filters that catch the tiny fibers . And workers doing the cleanup must don special protective gear that look_like space suits , which are later disposed_of . Clothes and other porous items from stores that have asbestos will also be bagged and sent to asbestos-disposal sites . Things took an odd turn_on Thursday when police investigated a report that 20 members of an asbestos cleanup crew had walked_off with new , asbestos-contaminated clothing from a Sears store at the Northridge mall . No one was arrested . Apparently it isn ' t a crime to take clothes that were deemed rubbish and headed for a toxic-waste dump . Sears , which owns its store , was responsible_for the asbestos cleanup and had hired a crew from CST Environmental in Anaheim . Sage Khara , CST ' s president , said he was outraged by the &quot; theft &quot; and fired those workers the same night . &quot; It was a very devastating experience for us , &quot; he said . CST has also been doing emergency asbestos work for MEPC at most of the rest of the Northridge mall . Graham said that CMT has worked for his company for five years and they &quot; have been reliable. &quot; This week CST and other companies will bid for a new asbestos cleanup contract at the Northridge mall . Meanwhile , security_guards are patrolling to ensure nothing is stolen from stores during the cleanup . &quot; We made_it clear to CST that heads will roll if it happens with us , &quot; Graham said . Asbestos shaken loose in the quake has been a bigger problem at shopping_malls than in many other large commercial structures in the Valley . One reason is that office and industrial buildings that suffered the worst quake damage were generally newer buildings made from concrete slabs , and many of those buildings don ' t have asbestos . * Also , many office_buildings old enough to have had asbestos included in their original construction -- say , some of those along Ventura Boulevard that were built_in the 1960s and 1970s -- had already had asbestos removed . &quot; There is not nearly as much asbestos in the Valley as there was five years ago , &quot; said Seth Dudley , senior_vice_president at real_estate brokerage Julien J . Studley Inc. in Los Angeles . Nonetheless , asbestos abatement contractors have been busy since the quake . Asbestos cleanups have also been done at Cal State Northridge , a Kaiser Permanente medical_building in Granada Hills , and the Superior_Court in Van Nuys . The Northridge Fashion Center , Topanga Plaza and Laurel Plaza were built_in the ' 60s and early ' 70s , when asbestos was commonly used for fireproofing and insulation . Those malls have all done some asbestos abatement in the past , as tenants moved_out . But a comprehensive asbestos removal project would have meant closing the malls temporarily , resulting in lost business . And until the earthquake , there was no compelling reason to remove asbestos that was safely contained . Even now , Topanga Plaza and Laurel Plaza will have some asbestos remaining . David Reed , director of facilities services at CenterMark Properties , owner of Topanga Plaza , said that over the years , asbestos was removed from 75 % of the mall and all common areas . But after the quake , about 16 shops were contaminated when ceiling tiles were dislodged , exposing sprayed-on asbestos , he said . The total Topanga Plaza asbestos cleanup and abatement is estimated to have cost less than $ 250 # 000 . Some shops will still have asbestos , Reed said , but it will be properly maintained and the air will continually be monitored . At Laurel Plaza , some asbestos that had been sprayed in ceilings and walls was released in the quake and with subsequent building repairs . The asbestos cleanup will probably be completed this week , said General_Manager Brian Pearson . When the mall reopens April 15 , about some 80 % of the asbestos will have been removed . &quot; There is no reason for concern , &quot; Pearson said . &quot; We are following the laws. &quot; Scott Lange , hazardous materials coordinator at Los Angeles property management company Shuwa Management , said that leaving asbestos in place is &quot; absolutely safe as long as there ' s correct air monitoring. &quot; And Dudley believes the asbestos won ' t prove a long-term detriment to property values . &quot; Even in high rise office_buildings with asbestos , I haven ' t seen a significant affect on rental rates. &quot; But at the Northridge Fashion Center , owner MEPC is doing a full-blown abatement anyway , despite a cost that will run_into the &quot; seven figures , &quot; according to MEPC President David Gruber . MEPC is expecting part of the cost to be covered under its earthquake insurance , although it is still negotiating with its insurer . About 25 store sites and some common areas of the Northridge mall have asbestos that was sprayed on the structural_steel . The day after the earthquake , 100 workers began sweeping the corridors of the mall from one end to the other , bagging anything suspected of being hazardous . The crews immediately started monitoring the air , and sealed_off tenant spaces with plastic . On the thick plastic covering shops with asbestos , the word &quot; HOT &quot; was spray-painted in red . MEPC plans to clean 15 feet into stores that don ' t have asbestos in case fibers drifted in . Merchandise with hard_surfaces , like jewelry , are being cleaned . MEPC expects to complete the removal of all asbestos by May 1 . Until then , floors are vacuumed each morning . Asbestos workers in contaminated areas wear respirators and the protective suits . They pass_through mobile chambers where they remove the suits and bag them for disposal , then shower and change . In many areas it ' s already possible to look_up and see nothing but steel beams covered with asbestos . One column was so twisted in the quake that the concrete and drywall fell_off in sections , exposing asbestos . It could have been much worse . An asbestos crew was in the Northridge mall doing an abatement of any empty shop the morning of the quake . They quit early , and left through an exit near Sears . An hour later the temblor hit and the thick concrete ceiling above the walkway collapsed onto the floor .</TEXT>
