   <HEADLINE> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP ; EARNHARDT EASILY SCORES NINTH DARLINGTON VICTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dale Earnhardt , the six-time and defending NASCAR Winston Cup champion , overpowered the field Sunday while winning the TranSouth Financial 400 at Darlington ( S.C. ) Raceway . Earnhardt , who won this race a year ago when it was 500 miles , led 10 times for 166 of the 292 laps , including the final 33 in an event shortened by 100 miles in the interest of competition and fan comfort . The victory , Earnhardt ' s first in 17 races , moved him within one victory of David Pearson ' s record of 10 on the 1.366-mile Darlington oval and was the 60th victory of his career . Earnhardt ' s black No . 3 Chevrolet Lumina , fielded by Richard Childress Racing , came_across the finish_line 7.4 seconds -- nearly a straightaway -- ahead of Mark Martin ' s Ford Thunderbird . Bill Elliott was third , also in a Thunderbird . The 28 lead changes and 11 different leaders were records for a 400-mile event at Darlington , as were the seven drivers finishing on the lead lap . Earnhardt ' s winning speed of 132.432 m.p.h. was shy of Pearson ' s record 132.703 set_in May , 1968 . &quot; Victory lane hasn ' t changed a bit , &quot; said Earnhardt , who won $ 70 # 190 . &quot; This is where our run ( to the championship ) started last year . This racetrack is tough to beat. &quot; * Germany ' s Michael Schumacher took_advantage of superior work by his crew and a spin-out by favored Ayrton Senna to win the season-opening Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo . Schumacher took the lead after he and the Brazilian stopped on the 21st lap , then was virtually guaranteed victory when Senna -- in a desperate attempt to catch_up -- spun_out with 15 laps remaining . Schumacher , driving a Benetton-Ford , completed 71 laps around the 2.637-mile Interlagos circuit in 1 hour 35 minutes 38.759 seconds -- averaging 119.7 m.p.h. &quot; There ' s nothing better than winning not by luck , but by fighting , &quot; the 25-year-old German said . Senna , the pre-race favorite in his first ride for Williams-Renault , locked himself in the team ' s motor_home after the race . Britain ' s Damon Hill , Senna ' s teammate , was second . Jean Alesi of France was third in a Ferrari .</TEXT>
