   <HEADLINE> CONFLICT BETWEEN MEXICAN STATE , NATIONAL GOVERNMENT GROWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a politically charged clash over the arrest of Baja California ' s deputy attorney_general on drug corruption charges , the state ' s governor Wednesday criticized federal authorities for accosting the official at gunpoint and unfairly accusing him in the murder of the city ' s police_chief . Describing the accusations as a &quot; total political irresponsibility , &quot; Gov . Ernesto Ruffo Appel said : &quot; These are not simply speculations , they tend to cloud the vision of events and ( create ) a confusion that no one needs. &quot; Indeed , the case grew confused the day after federal_agents hustled Sergio Ortiz Lara from the state justice complex at gunpoint , igniting a brief confrontation between state police and dozens of heavily armed federal officers in downtown Tijuana . The conflict intertwines a probe of high-level corruption in Baja with election-year hostilities between Mexico ' s ruling party and an opposition-controlled state administration . It also has provoked accusations that authorities are trying to divert attention from the unsolved assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio . Ortiz was arraigned Wednesday on charges related to a March 3 shootout between federal_agents and state officers , who allegedly were escorting a drug lord of the Arellano cartel of Tijuana . But federal authorities said Ortiz also is suspected in the assassination last week of Federico Benitez Lopez , the municipal police_chief and a trusted confidante of the governor . Benitez had obtained evidence against Ortiz and others regarding the shootout and the cartel , whose leaders are fugitives in the slaying of the Roman_Catholic cardinal of Guadalajara last year , Atty . Gen . Diego Valades said at a news_conference . A source close to the investigation asserted that on the day before Benitez was slain in a highway ambush , he presented the governor with a report implicating the deputy attorney_general in corruption . &quot; We know that Benitez had been investigating Ortiz ' s ties to drug_traffickers and had presented a report to the governor the day before he was killed , &quot; the source said . &quot; We think that could have been why he was murdered. &quot; The accusation raises the possibility that state officers were involved in chief ' s murder . Ortiz heads a state task_force investigating the Benitez case . Gov . Ruffo , however , denied Wednesday that the chief gave him information on misconduct by Ortiz , a 43-year-old law professor and friend . &quot; This is one of the aspects that most disturbs me &quot; about the federal accusations , Ruffo said . The governor called_for cooperation and respect between the two governments and said he hopes to discuss the_matter with Mexico ' s president . Meanwhile , Ortiz defended himself in an interview in the La Mesa state_prison , where he is being held pending a judge ' s ruling . &quot; This is an abuse by the federal attorney_general ' s office , &quot; he said . When two plainclothes agents escorted him forcibly from his office to a waiting pickup_truck , Ortiz said , he thought he was being kidnaped . One agent told him , &quot; You ' re coming or we ' re going to kill each other , ' &quot; Ortiz said . &quot; I told him ' Don ' t take this attitude . The judges , employees , the public are watching . . . . I ' m not armed . I don ' t have a bodyguard . I ' m willing to go_with you. ' &quot; With the arrest , the federal_government ' s longtime investigation of high-ranking Baja California officials suspected of collusion with drug cartels is accelerating , said a federal_official , predicting more arrests . &quot; Things are heating_up , &quot; he said . &quot; They intend to get_to the bottom of this matter in Tijuana. &quot; The federal investigation led to the March 3 shootout that left five dead , including a state police_officer allegedly serving as a drug lord ' s bodyguard and the federal commander of a special anti-drug unit . The governor said he expects new arrests to include five state police commanders initially charged with abuse of authority along with Ortiz in the shootout , then cleared by a judge . An appellate_court has reversed the judge ' s ruling . Some Baja California residents , including state officials , said the dramatic arrest and show of force amount to a political attack by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI . The state is a stronghold of the National Action Party , one of two strong opposition challengers in August presidential elections , which could be the most competitive ever . Moreover , Ruffo was asked if he suspects the federal_government of trying to divert attention from the Colosio assassination , which has fomented charges of a high-level conspiracy . Baja California officials , including Ruffo and Benitez , the slain police_chief , were among the most outspoken voices in the Colosio investigation . Ruffo said he hopes that politics are not involved . Regarding the unsolved Colosio case , he said : &quot; As the days pass and we don ' t have information that describes what happened and leads us to the truth , we will be in confusion . And that confusion , in these times , will hurt us. &quot; Times staff writer Juanita Darling in Mexico_City contributed to this story .</TEXT>
