   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING : GETTING OFF TO A LIGHT START</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These days , people are satisfied cooking much more simply . They no longer feel they must try to re-create restaurant dishes for their guests . that ' s the good news . The bad news is we ' re still stuck_with making hors d ' oeuvres . You do need something light to nibble on with drinks before dinner . Something light -- heavy hors d ' oeuvres can throw a meal off kilter . Things like cured olives , raw_vegetables served with a full-flavored dip and fresh salted nuts are easy options . You might also consider the following suggestions , which are easily prepared and will tempt guests without interfering with their appetites -- all at under five grams of fat per serving . * You can reduce the fat content in these spiced nuts by combining a little oil with egg_whites , which also makes them very crisp . Be sure to taste a nut before making the recipe ; make_sure they are not rancid or stale-tasting . You can substitute an equal quantity of walnuts if you want . HERBED SPICED PECANS 2 egg_whites 2 tablespoons olive_oil 1 / 4 cup light corn_syrup 2 teaspoons dried rosemary 2 teaspoons chili_powder 2 teaspoons dried thyme 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon salt Dash cayenne_pepper 1 pound large pecan halves Whisk egg_whites and oil together in 1 1 / 2-quart bowl until frothy . Add corn_syrup , rosemary , chili_powder , thyme , cumin , salt and cayenne . Mix well . Add pecans . Toss until evenly coated . Spread pecans in single layer on foil-lined baking sheet . Bake on center oven rack at 325 degrees until deeply browned , 25 to 27 minutes , stirring midway during baking so nuts brown evenly . Watch carefully to prevent burning . Transfer hot nuts to piece of clean foil , separating any that stick_together . Allow to cool thoroughly . Nuts can be kept_in airtight container at room_temperature up_to 1 week or frozen as long as 2 months . If nuts lose crispness , spread single layer on baking sheet and bake at 300 degrees until heated through , about 8 to 10 minutes . Let cool completely before serving . Makes 1 quart . Each 1 / 4-cup serving contains about : 220 calories ; 160 mg sodium ; cholesterol ; 20 grams fat ; 12 grams carbohydrates ; 4 gram protein ; 0.64 gram fiber . * Delicious plain , these potato_skins are even better sprinkled with grated imported Parmesan cheese . I tested this recipe with baking potatoes and small red potatoes ; the latter have a more appealing texture . CRISP GARLIC POTATO_SKINS 6 medium red potatoes , scrubbed 1 egg_white 1 tablespoon olive_oil 1 1 / 2 tablespoons minced garlic 1 / 4 teaspoon salt Freshly ground pepper 2 tablespoons shredded imported Parmesan cheese Bake potatoes on baking sheet on center oven rack at 450 degrees until tender , about 40 minutes . Cool until easy to handle . Can be baked 1 day ahead and refrigerated after completely cooled . Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop_out center with small melon baller , leaving 1 / 8-inch thick shell . ( Use reserved scooped potato in soups or fried potatoes. ) Whisk together egg_white , olive_oil , garlic , salt and pepper in small bowl until very frothy . Brush inside of skins with mixture . Place in single layer on baking sheet . Bake at 450 degrees until crisp and only lightly browned , about 20 to 25 minutes . Lightly brush skins with mixture again . Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese , pressing lightly into place with back of spoon . Bake until cheese is melted and skins are deeply browned on edges . Serve hot . Makes about 4 servings . Each serving contains about : 72 calories ; 226 mg sodium ; 2 mg cholesterol ; 5 grams fat ; 6 grams carbohydrates ; 3 grams protein ; 0.66 gram fiber . * The mild flavor of the cabbage is perfectly complemented by a sauce that is traditionally served with egg_rolls .

Spread lightly dampened kitchen towel on work_surface . Place 1 filo sheet on towel with long edge facing you . Keep other filo sheets covered with separate damp towel so they don ' t dry_out and crack . Lightly brush filo with egg_white mixture . Cover with second filo sheet , brush with egg_white mixture and continue layering with remaining sheets and mixture until all 4 sheets are used . Arrange Cabbage Filling_in 2-inch-wide strip across length of filo , leaving 1-inch border at ends and edge nearest you . Lifting end of towel nearest you , start rolling strudel as for burrito . After 2 or 3 turns , tuck ends under , straighten roll and finish rolling strudel into compact cylinder . Cut_in half . Transfer to greased baking sheet , seam-side down .
