   <TEXT> Middle_East Israel and the Territories : The U.S. State_Department warned Americans traveling in Israel to stay out of East Jerusalem , the West_Bank and the Gaza Strip after the Feb . 25 massacre of more_than two_dozen Muslim worshipers at a mosque in the West_Bank city of Hebron . Within Israel itself , Americans were advised not to use public transportation and to avoid bus_stops , crowds and demonstrations . Israel stepped_up security , closing the plaza in front of the Western Wall_in Jerusalem ' s Old City and restricting access to the nearby Al Aqsa mosque . Americans traveling anywhere in the Middle_East or Europe should be &quot; particularly aware of their surroundings , avoiding all crowds and demonstrations and maintaining a low profile , &quot; the State_Department cautioned . Jordan and Egypt : The tremors from the Hebron killings were particularly felt in these two countries . In Jordan , the State_Department advised Americans to be careful and to avoid two parts of the capital -- east Amman and the downtown souk area -- plus any refugee camp . Although there apparently have been no specific threats against Americans in Jordan , the department noted two recent attacks on foreigners in Amman : A British citizen and a German citizen were stabbed in separate incidents , both left with superficial wounds . In Egypt , already troubled by terrorist attacks on tourism facilities , the government tightened security around the Israeli Embassy , synagogues and diplomats ' homes after the massacre . Israeli tourists were being discouraged from visiting Egypt , according to the Reuters news service . A previously unknown group threatened Americans and Israelis in Egypt to avenge the Hebron attack , Reuters said . Europe Great Britain : London air traffic was disrupted when Irish_Republican_Army terrorists , over a five-day period , lobbed three series of mortars into Heathrow Airport early this month . None of the dozen shells exploded , leading to speculation that they may have been dummy rounds intended simply to demonstrate the IRA ' s attack capabilities . Most shells landed on runways or in parking_lots ; one struck the roof of Terminal 4 , causing its evacuation . Airport security was intensified , with hundreds of officers patrolling Heathrow and its perimeter . Describing the attacks as evidence of a new &quot; IRA tactical audacity , &quot; one American analyst said they were intended &quot; to disrupt air traffic , attract publicity , embarrass the security_forces and pressure the government &quot; during negotiations over Northern_Ireland . Russia A London-based consulting firm says there were 7 # 000 reported crimes against foreigners , mostly extortion , in Russia during the first_half of 1993 . In a report quoted by Reuters , the Control Risks Group estimates that there are about 3 # 000 organized crime groups ( the Russian Interior Ministry estimates 5 # 700 ) engaged in racketeering , extortion and kidnaping in the former Soviet_Union . Briefly . . . Worldwide : The March 4 conviction of followers of Sheik Omar Abdurrahman in the World Trade Center bombing trial &quot; may precipitate strong reactions from Islamic extremists &quot; in Egypt and other countries , the State_Department warned . Americans overseas , especially in the Middle_East , South Asia or North Africa , should be alert to continuing developments , the department advised . Hot Spots : State_Department travel warnings are in_effect for Afghanistan , Algeria , Angola , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Colombia , Congo , Haiti , Iran , Iraq , Lebanon , Liberia , Libya , North_Korea , Peru , Rwanda , Serbia and Montenegro , Somalia , Sudan and Tajikistan , and also for East Jerusalem and the Israeli-occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip .
