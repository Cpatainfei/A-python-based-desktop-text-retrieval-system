   <HEADLINE> TENNIS ; UPSETS ELIMINATE TOP CHALLENGERS TO TOP-SEEDED GRAF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Upsets eliminated Steffi Graf ' s three foremost challengers Tuesday at the Lipton Championships . Two-time defending champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , Gabriela Sabatini and Jana Novotna -- seeded second , third and fourth -- all departed in the space of less than three hours . The quarterfinal results left only longshots to face Graf , a 6-1 , 6-1 winner over fifth-seeded Kimiko Date . Graf has won 30 consecutive matches and 53 sets_in a row . Her dominance underscores a predictability and lack of depth that have hampered women ' s tennis in the absence of Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati . &quot; I hope all_of women ' s tennis gets maybe a little bit more recognized , &quot; said Lindsay Davenport , a 17-year-old senior at Murrieta Valley High who defeated Sabatini , 6-1 , 6-2 . &quot; Maybe some more players will be pushed into the media and the public ' s knowledge. &quot; The biggest stunner claimed second-ranked Sanchez Vicario , who squandered five consecutive match_points and lost to Brenda Schultz , 1-6 , 7-6 ( 8-6 ) , 6-3 . &quot; I have the match in my hands , &quot; Sanchez Vicario said , &quot; but it went away. &quot; Novotna blew a 4-0 lead in the second set against Natalia Zvereva , who won , 7-6 ( 7-5 ) , 7-6 ( 7-4 ) . Zvereva will play Schultz in Thursday ' s semifinals . Davenport will face Graf . The top men weren ' t immune to upsets , either . Unseeded Australian Patrick Rafter defeated eighth-ranked Michael Chang , 6-2 , 6-7 ( 7-2 ) , 6-2 . Jim Grabb , ranked No . 185 , defeated Aaron Krickstein , 5-7 , 6-4 , 7-5 . Andre Agassi eliminated Cedric Pioline , 6-4 , 6-2 . No . 6 Goran Ivanisevic won in singles , then retired from his doubles match when he was hit in the side of the neck by a serve from partner Marc Rosset . Ivanisevic is expected to play singles tonight against Jim Courier , but will be re-evaluated beforehand . Courier , top-ranked Pete Sampras , Stefan Edberg and Petr Korda all advanced to the quarterfinals with straight-set victories . Sanchez Vicario nearly was a straight-set winner . She led Schultz , 6-1 , in their second-set tiebreaker , but the Dutchwoman took the next seven points to force a third set . Schultz , at 6 feet 2 , slammed 10 aces and won 38 points at the net to 10 for Sanchez Vicario . &quot; She hits the ball very hard , harder than maybe any woman , &quot; Sanchez Vicario said . &quot; When she puts_in her serve , she is really dangerous. &quot;</TEXT>
