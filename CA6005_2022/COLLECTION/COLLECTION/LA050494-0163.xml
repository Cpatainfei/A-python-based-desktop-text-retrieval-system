   <HEADLINE> MAY USE FORCE , CLINTON TELLS HAITI ; CARIBBEAN : THE PRESIDENT WILL CONSIDER MILITARY ACTION IF STEPPED-UP SANCTIONS FAIL TO TOPPLE THE JUNTA , OFFICIALS SAY . SEN . MITCHELL EXPRESSES DOUBTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton warned Haiti ' s military_leaders Tuesday that his patience &quot; has run_out &quot; and he no longer will rule_out the use of U.S. military_force to drive them from power . In a day of saber-rattling apparently intended to increase pressure on the Haitian regime , White_House officials told reporters that Clinton is willing to consider a U.S. attack to topple the junta if stepped-up economic sanctions fail to do the job . No military_action has been approved or planned , aides added . But even their guarded talk_of military_action as a possible option caused alarm among some in Congress and in the Pentagon . &quot; We are doing our best to avoid dealing with the military option , &quot; Clinton said in an appearance at a televised conference here sponsored by Cable News Network . &quot; We have not decided to use force -- all I am saying is , we cannot afford to rule it out any longer. &quot; Asked whether his patience with the stalemate in Haiti had run_out , the President replied , &quot; It has run_out -- and maybe we have let it run_on a little too long. &quot; Earlier , a White_House official underscored the shift in the U.S. posture , saying , &quot; What has changed is . . . our willingness to put it ( military_action ) in the option category where we weren ' t talking_about it before. &quot; The reaction in Congress and the Pentagon was sharp . Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) , usually a stalwart presidential ally , quickly said military_action in Haiti would be &quot; neither wise nor prudent. &quot; At the Pentagon , where Defense_Secretary William J . Perry publicly has dismissed the idea of military intervention in Haiti , a senior officer called it &quot; stupid. &quot; White_House officials spent much of the day scrambling to squelch reports that Clinton was planning an immediate military move -- while still seeking to convey the more subtle message that the President might consider such action later . &quot; The President hasn ' t made a decision . It doesn ' t mean planning has been stepped_up . He has not threatened military_action , &quot; one official said . At a closed briefing for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott and Deputy National Security Adviser Samuel R . Berger said the Administration hopes that new sanctions against Haiti will compel the military regime to give_up power . &quot; They outlined a series of options to us , &quot; said Sen . Claiborne Pell ( D-R.I. ) , the committee ' s chairman . &quot; Nothing has been ruled_out , but no plans have been made_for the use of force as of now. &quot; Haiti ' s military seized power in 1991 , overthrowing the island republic ' s first elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who now lives_in exile in Washington . After abortive attempts to negotiate a compromise between Aristide and the military , a wave of gruesome murders of Aristide supporters in Haiti and increasing complaints from liberal Democrats in Congress , Clinton has returned to a policy of increasing pressure on the regime in Port-au-Prince . In the short term , the policy focuses_on a proposal for a total trade_embargo presented to the U.N. Security_Council on Tuesday . &quot; The people now in_charge of Haiti have thwarted democracy , &quot; Clinton said in his appearance on CNN , &quot; and it is wrong and we ' ve go_to do something about it. &quot; But Administration aides acknowledged that the trade_embargo may_not force the military regime from power and that they are looking_for other means to increase the pressure . &quot; Diplomacy clearly is not working , &quot; one aide complained . Addressing the prospect of military_action in Haiti , Clinton said , &quot; We have intervened in the past ; it hasn ' t worked_out very well. &quot; He added , &quot; But this is an unusual and in some ways unprecedented circumstance. &quot; Pentagon officials said contingency plans have been prepared_for several possible military_actions in Haiti . But they described them as normal planning exercises . One plan envisions deploying a brigade of light infantry troops to Haiti to take_over the island , much as U.S. forces invaded Grenada and Panama in the 1980s . Such an operation could involve Army paratroopers and Marines -- either taking_off by helicopter from Navy aircraft_carriers or making an amphibious landing of_their_own -- backed by tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles . Military analysts said there is little doubt that even a modest-size U.S. force could easily defeat the tiny , poorly equipped Haitian army , which numbers about 7 # 000 troops , has no tanks and commands only a handful of Bradley fighting vehicles and guns . But they said the United States could risk serious casualties if a substantial part of Haiti ' s civilian population opposed U.S. troops by waging guerrilla warfare or house-to-house fighting . The Pentagon has long opposed any new military_action in Haiti . Perry told The Times earlier this week that he feared that U.S. military_action in Haiti could leave the United States embroiled there for months . &quot; After we ' ve done that , what is Act II ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Could we . . . stabilize the situation there and . . . reinstall democratic government ? &quot; Administration officials said Clinton and aides have considered reviving an earlier plan to send U.S. military trainers to Haiti . But they called that a separate issue from the military intervention option . The trainers would go_to Haiti only if the military regime quit or opted for a compromise that would invite Americans in peacefully , officials said . &quot; You would n ' t send them ( trainers ) to fight their way in , &quot; one official said . A Navy amphibious landing ship , the Harlan County , tried to land U.S. military_engineers in Haiti last year but turned_back after pro-regime thugs gathered on the dock and threatened to kill them . At the United Nations , Ambassador Madeleine Albright introduced a Security_Council resolution that she said would put &quot; a sanctions noose around the Haitian military. &quot; It would clamp a total trade_embargo on Haiti -- except for food and medicine -- and would authorize any U.N. member to set_up a naval_blockade to inspect ships coming into and out of Haiti . The resolution would ban all travel out of the country by Haitian military and police_officers and their families . Governments would be asked to freeze all international financial holdings of these Haitians . All planes would be prohibited from landing and taking_off from Haiti unless they were regularly scheduled commercial airliners . Richter reported from Atlanta and McManus from Washington . Times staff writers Michael Ross in Washington and Stanley Meisler at the United Nations contributed to this report .</TEXT>
