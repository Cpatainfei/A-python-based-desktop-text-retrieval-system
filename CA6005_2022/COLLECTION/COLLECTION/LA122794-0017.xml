   <HEADLINE> DEMOCRACY FIRST , ELECTIONS LATER ; PALESTINIANS : POLITICAL LEGITIMACY ISN ' T AS IMPORTANT AS BUILDING THE CIVILIAN FRAMEWORK FOR A DEMOCRATIC STATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Debate is escalating among Palestinians on the significance of holding elections for a governing body for the self-rule areas of the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . These elections are called_for in the secretly signed Oslo agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization , but not in the later , formal Cairo agreement . PLO officials consider such elections a vital lifeline for the Palestinian Authority led by Chairman Yasser Arafat and , thus , for the entire peace process with Israel . They specify two reasons for this view : Elections will expedite the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian-inhabited cities of the West_Bank and will give the PLO political legitimacy . But do the Palestinians really need elections at this historical and extremely sensitive juncture , when their survival as an independent political entity is at stake ? The answer is a definite no . The right_to_vote and hold free elections is indeed noble ; the right of citizens to choose their government is a tool for guaranteeing other rights in a democratic society . But elections per se are not an ultimate goal ; democracy is . Free elections bring tremendous responsibility that requires citizen awareness of the consequences of the choices made . If elections are to be truly free , then the electorate must also be free . The Palestinians are not yet a free_people , not only because of Israel ' s continuing occupation of territory that is home to more_than 1 million Palestinians in the West_Bank , but also because they lack a fundamental requirement for free elections : a choice of political_parties with media access to the electorate and clear agendas , platforms and vision that can evolve into legitimate civilian government . The current organizations lack concrete economic or social plans , and the interim Palestinian Authority is burdened by poorly delineated power-sharing between civilian political figures , most of them long affiliated with the PLO , and veterans of Arafat ' s military organization , Fatah . The Palestinian police_force in the self-rule areas , drawn largely from Fatah , is more like an armed militia than public_servant , and its clear political bias will create problems during elections . There are no Palestinian TV or radio_stations ; newspapers and magazines are the only media outlet for political campaigning and they are frequently confiscated by the police_force or prevented from circulating in the self-rule areas . Under such undemocratic practices , independent candidates would find it impossible to reach the people , thus circumventing democracy before its inception . The Palestinians have a long way to go_on the road to a democratic state , but they have started the journey in the right direction . They sincerely chose to enter into peace talks with Israel , agreeing on a limited self-rule formula for the West_Bank and Gaza . Their freedom is now conditioned on the provisions of the Oslo and Cairo accords . By virtue of political necessity , Israeli security requirements and Palestinian internal affairs , these provisions are extremely restrictive . Insisting on elections under these circumstances will only add a new layer of limitations to the Palestinian Authority ' s already circumscribed powers . The period of Palestinian self-rule ought to be utilized for the creation of a democratic Palestinian society , rather than for testing Palestinian political legitimacy . I am not suggesting that the Palestinians should submit to a dictatorship or ignore the political , financial and administrative corruption among the senior ranks of PLO officials . On the contrary , a careful and rigorous investigation of alleged mishandling of power must be undertaken by local and international human-rights groups . But elections in non-democratic societies can be , and have been , widely manipulated to serve the agenda and interests of those in power . The Palestinians should not focus foremost on their leaders ' need to establish political legitimacy . Rather , they should be concerned about their leaders ' abilities to transfer the Palestinian society from one that is based on nepotism and tribal relations_to one in which democratic behavior is the norm , not the exception . What is needed at present is the development of democratic Palestinian men and women through the establishment of democratic institutions based on limited -- but free -- elections . While such institutions currently exist -- municipalities , chambers_of_commerce , labor_unions , student councils , professional_associations and so on -- they are anything but democratic . These institutions , along with Palestinian universities and other national and international non-governmental organizations , must carry_on a massive campaign to educate the Palestinian public about democracy and all that it entails . Thus , the very concept of free elections will be incrementally introduced to the Palestinians by individuals and institutions that practice the democracy they preach . Rightly , the Palestinians are exceptionally sensitive to the &quot; policy of appointment , &quot; but they should distinguish between Palestinians who earned appointment and those who were appointed by Israeli authorities during the self-rule stage . Many Palestinians see Yasser Arafat as a classic dictator , but they do not see him as a traitor . Though he may_not be a canny philosopher , he is not a political blockhead , either . If the spread of Palestinian self-rule to the West_Bank is being hindered because of disagreements over elections , Palestinians should let Arafat enjoy his absolute authority in the self-rule period to ensure that they reach the next stage -- an independent democratic state .</TEXT>
