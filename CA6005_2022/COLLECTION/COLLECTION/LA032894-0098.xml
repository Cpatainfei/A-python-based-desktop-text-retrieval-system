   <HEADLINE> FROM RAW-GOODS SUPPLIER TO FINISHED EXPORTS ; MALAYSIA : LATEX PRODUCTS AUGMENT INCOME , BUT U.S. CONDOM TESTS SCREEN_OUT MANY IMPORTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seven years ago , Malaysia ' s rubber industry faced declining prices and increasing competition from other Southeast Asian_nations to be the world ' s leading supplier of raw latex . While Malaysia remains a major exporter of the commodity , it has in the intervening years developed a substantial manufacturing segment that has become a leading exporter of finished rubber products -- chiefly gloves and condoms -- and thus added value to a flagging natural-resource industry . Demand for latex gloves and condoms is booming because of worldwide concern about containing the spread of AIDS . One result : Malaysia has more_than doubled its condom exports since 1988 . The greater emphasis on producing manufactured goods &quot; is in_line with the structural change in the Malaysian economy , transforming from an agrarian to an industrial economy , &quot; said Ng Kok Tee , deputy chairman of the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board , the government_agency that oversees rubber exports . With subsidies and other incentives from the government , Malaysia ' s rubber producers are diversifying . Take Sime Darby , for example . The 83-year-old , Kuala Lumpur-based company -- known throughout Asia for its vast rubber plantations -- now makes latex gloves and condoms , tires and medical products and is a developer of residential and commercial properties . Diversifying into manufacturing was a natural move for Sime Darby because of its ready access to raw_materials . &quot; We own the land , we own the trees , so , it seems to be a logical thing to do , &quot; said Sunny Yap , marketing coordinator for Sime Darby ' s latex division , a maker of gloves and condoms . Sime Darby ' s Seattle-based subsidiary is currently awaiting regulatory approval to distribute condoms in the United States . The success of companies such_as Sime Darby in the exporting of condoms has not been matched by increases in domestic sales , however . Government policy , reflecting Malaysian traditions and moral attitudes associating the use of condoms with promiscuity , bans condom advertising and severely restricts sales . &quot; You can ' t advertise condom products through the mass media . that ' s the problem , &quot; said Kim Bum Ki , managing director of Hevealactics International , a South Korean-Malaysian venture that produces condoms . More_than half Malaysia ' s population is Muslim , a religion that forbids using condoms as contraceptives and holds that they should be used only within marriage to protect against the transmission of disease , said Dr. Maher Hathout , a spokesman for the Islamic Center of Southern California . Religion is not a factor_in condom manufacturing , however , Hathout noted . &quot; The commodity in itself cannot be good or bad ; the way it ' s used is the decisive_factor , &quot; he said . Malaysian manufacturers say they can live with the domestic restrictions because their home market is so small . By contrast , the much larger U.S. market is a source of concern . As worldwide condom exports have grown each year , Malaysian sales in the United States have remained slow . U.S. regulations play an important role in limiting the volume of Malaysian condom sales , manufacturers say . Some charge that the Food and Drug Administration , which must test and approve all condoms , has unfairly rejected Malaysian products to protect U.S. manufacturers . &quot; Manufacturers don ' t want to sell in the United States because ( the ) FDA is protecting local suppliers -- most of Malaysian exports face rejections from FDA , &quot; Kim said . The company has stopped trying to export to the United States , he said , and instead concentrates_on meeting increased demand from Asia and Africa . An FDA spokeswoman said the agency ' s policy is not motivated by protectionism . &quot; It doesn ' t matter who manufactures the condoms -- it ' s all held to the same standards , &quot; she said . Industry experts said the delays and other problems that Malaysian manufacturers encounter in seeking FDA approval are , in part , a result of the great distance between the two countries . For instance , FDA officials cannot easily inspect Malaysian manufacturing_plants , they say . U.S. manufacturers may encounter fewer problems winning FDA approvals , they say , because the FDA has likely been able to inspect domestic plants and has followed the process from inception . Their lack of familiarity with foreign manufacturing processes may lead inspectors to test imported condoms more stringently , the experts say . Still , industry experts said , a more significant factor limiting Malaysia ' s U.S. sales is the strength of companies that already dominate the market . The U.S. market is controlled by three condom manufacturers : Carter Wallace , which makes the Trojan brand ; Schmid Laboratories , which makes Sheik , and Ansell Inc. , which sells the Lifestyle brand . &quot; It ' s a very difficult market to break_into , &quot; said James S . Murphy , an industry expert who has worked for major American condom manufacturers . Even if Malaysian products were priced lower than brands already established in the market , brand switching is unlikely because of the nature of the product , Murphy said . &quot; Would you pay 50 cents for a product you can trust , or 25 cents for a product you haven ' t heard of ? Are you going_to worry about that quarter ? &quot; he asked . Malaysian manufacturers may have some success with joint_ventures in the United States , however . One such venture involves Line One , a Los Angeles-based trading company . Once merely a representative of a Malaysian manufacturer , Line One became an investor in the Malaysian plants . With some control of manufacturing , Line One has been able to help the Malaysians make products to meet FDA standards , said Robert Gruber , Line One ' s sales manager . &quot; We have better ties with factories overseas , so we can be updated with FDA regulations and keep ( factories ) updated , &quot; Gruber said . The venture now sells condoms , under the names Ria and Trustex , to government health agencies and novelty stores in the United States , such_as Condomania . Exporting Condoms Falling prices and a labor shortage have slowed Malaysia ' s production and export of rubber , but the nation has significantly increased production and exports of finished rubber products including condoms and gloves . * Natural Rubber Exports ( billions of dollars ) 1992 : $ 0.868 billion * Malaysian Condom Exports Worldwide ( millions of dollars ) 1992 : $ 7.8 million * Malaysian Condom Exports to the United States ( millions of dollars ) 1992 : $ 0.45 million Sources : Malaysian Rubber Research and Development Board ; Malaysian Resource Center , Ohio University</TEXT>
