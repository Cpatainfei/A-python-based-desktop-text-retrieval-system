   <HEADLINE> DIVERSITY , NOT QUOTAS , FOR COLLEGES ; SHARING OF INTELLECTUAL SPACE BOTH EDUCATES AND EMPOWERS STUDENTS . BUT CAMPUSES SHOULD BEWARE BUREAUCRATIC TOKENISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Campus diversity is now a measure of a university ' s success . But unlike affirmative-action programs that have polarized faculty both on the left and on the right by their narrow , bureaucratic intrusions on faculty selection , there has yet to be a standardized policy developed for achieving campus diversity . Campuses most engaged in the diversity debate are those that have seen the most change in their undergraduate student population in the last five years . Faculty discussions on diversity do not mirror the affirmative-action agenda because diversity is not defined solely by race , sex or ethnicity but includes sexual preference , age , income and educational background . For elite institutions such_as Harvard or Yale , discussions of diversity have little immediate relevance due_to selection processes that ensure a relatively homogeneous student population -- that is , Harvard may have a racial and ethnic mix , but from a relatively homogeneous class background . On the other hand , public institutions such_as the California State University system draw from public high_schools . Demographic shifts in enrollment and differences in income levels of students are forcing Cal State faculty to address the issue of diversity to increase their own teaching effectiveness . This is based on neither moral nor political grounds , but rather on pragmatism , to ensure that we teachers can meet our students ' needs . Diversity in higher education forces faculty and administrators to accept new power relationships . In the past , curricula were rigidly defined by faculty experts , but diversity requires breaking traditional disciplinary boundaries and acknowledging that curricula must be expanded to train our students in applied skills and critical thinking . Faculty must become more creative to retain undergraduate students and maintain their quality of instruction . The incentive to hire diverse faculty does not stem from government mandates and quotas , nor should advocates of diversity allow affirmative-action bureaucrats to reduce the debate to tokenism and color-coding applicants . Rather , the discussion should be rooted in the comparative advantage that departments will have in hiring educators who are_better equipped in the method as well as the content of teaching . We expand the base of knowledge that will prepare students to compete in the global market by including in their portfolio of knowledge an understanding of diverse cultures , history and languages . Those opposed to diversity in education fear the loss of quality and continued Balkanization of our student population , and that group rights will take precedence over individual rights . Yet a major goal of such curricula is to provide a platform for acknowledging individual differences , particularly those within groups . From this knowledge , students should begin to recognize a common_ground where alliances can form . As an economist who recently began teaching in ethnic studies , I value the opportunity of using contemporary Chicano scholarship to teach students who would normally view economics as irrelevant to their lives . Adam Smith ' s &quot; Wealth of Nations &quot; shares the bookshelf with Chicana scholars . By whetting students ' intellectual appetite with relevant literature , I open the path for acceptance of alternative views and disciplines . This sharing of intellectual space is not a pedagogy of entitlement ; rather , it is a pedagogy of empowerment . That few faculty on college campuses have opportunities for cross-disciplinary teaching is unfortunate . Yet we who are_on increasingly diverse campuses know that curriculum change is inevitable . Shifting power relationships within departments and colleges will result in acrimonious academic struggles not only in the Cal State system , but also at UC , where doctoral education will require greater public scrutiny to ensure that graduate-student training meets the hiring needs of state universities . Diversity in our student population has forced us to challenge ourselves and our disciplines to regain student trust and public confidence . Though no college has resolved the issue of diversity in the intellectual playing_field , we know that if it is to be effective , it must go beyond political correctness , tokenism and bureaucratic manipulation of faculty and curricula .</TEXT>
