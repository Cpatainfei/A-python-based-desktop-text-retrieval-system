   <HEADLINE> SHOP_TALK : CAN WORKER WHO QUITS QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation ? If so , please mail it to Shop_Talk , Los Angeles Times , P.O. Box 2008 , Costa Mesa , Calif . 92626 . Or call ( 714 ) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message with your name and where you live . Questions of general interest will be answered in this column on Mondays . Question : My employer is often late paying my salary and on occasion has bounced my payroll_check . If I quit , am I eligible for unemployment benefits until I secure a new job ? Answer : Generally , when an employee quits his or her employment , particularly without another job , that employee is unqualified for unemployment benefits . To quit for &quot; good cause &quot; -- a phrase used in the Unemployment Insurance statute -- means &quot; a cause &quot; that would reasonably motivate an average able-bodied and qualified worker in a similar situation to give_up employment with its wages in_order to enter the ranks of the compensated unemployed . It certainly appears that you have good cause to leave a job where the employer failed to pay your full salary on_time . Since the employer has a cash flow problem and your salary checks were not paid regularly or fully on a number of occasions , you should receive a favorable decision by Unemployment Insurance . Please remember that for your claim to be valid there are also specific earning requirements that must be satisfied ; also there is a limit to the maximum number of weeks you can receive unemployment_compensation . If your decision is to quit , you should file a claim with the unemployment office . -- Elizabeth Winfree-Lydon , senior staff consultant , The Employers Group Question : I was hired by a company in Buena Park as a communications technician after leaving prison and was living_in a halfway house . The company , which hired me to do field_work , knew I did not own a vehicle and said it was no problem -- that a co-worker could transport me . After a while , I was given a company car , but eventually the company said it needed it back and that I would have to get my own vehicle . This was at a time when we weren ' t working a full 40 hours ; I was averaging about three days a week . I need to know what my obligations are to an employer . -- D.B. , Yorba Linda Answer : There is no legal requirement that employers provide vehicles for their employees , even if a vehicle is necessary for the performance of the employee ' s duties . Therefore , your company can require you to obtain a vehicle as a condition of your continued employment , but they are required by California law to reimburse you for your work-related use of that vehicle . Usually , this is accomplished via a mileage reimbursement for all miles driven on business . -- James J . McDonald Jr. , attorney , Fisher &amp; Phillips , law instructor , UC Irvine Question : I work for a large Orange County employer that has a retirement policy where a person can retire at age 50 if they have 10 years of service . My job classification was abolished and I was laid_off at nine years and seven months . Is there any law that prohibits an employer from laying you off when you ' re so close to retirement ? -- M.H. , Santa Ana Answer : The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) prohibits an employer from discharging an employee for the purpose of preventing that employee from receiving retirement_benefits . Discharging an employee who is close to retirement may be evidence of such an improper purpose , but by itself would not necessarily be conclusive . To investigate further , you should probably consult with an attorney who specializes in this area . For assistance in finding one , call this Orange County Bar Assn. ' s Lawyer Referral Service at ( 714 ) 835-8811 . -- Calvin House , attorney , Fulbright &amp; Jaworski L.L.P. , adjunct professor , Western State University College of Law Question : My wife was in an accident . She was employed as a registered nurse in a surgical center . The accident occurred in February and she has been disabled since then , although she will be able to go_back to work this month . However , during the time she was off her job was terminated . Is that proper procedure ? -- T.W. Answer : An employer generally has no obligation to hold an employee ' s job during his or her disability . If the employer is an &quot; at will &quot; employee , i.e. can be terminated without cause , then the employer is free to terminate the position at any time . If , however , the employer-employee relationship is one where termination can only be for &quot; cause &quot; then it is necessary to inquire as_to the reasons for the job termination . Poor performance , misconduct , absenteeism , inability to perform the job , financial distress and other business reasons would constitute &quot; cause. &quot; In any case , termination because of discrimination based upon race , color , gender , religion , national origin , age and disability where the person otherwise would be able to perform the job with reasonable accommodation could be considered illegal . Whether or not her termination was proper requires asking the employer the reason for the termination . -- Thomas M . Apke , attorney , professor of business law , Cal State Fullerton Question : My husband works for a large company that makes its employees make_up the time they take_off for national_holidays . Workers don ' t get the choice of working the holiday either . How cheap can a company get ? Have you heard this before ? -- R.L. , Los Alamitos Answer : Companies are allowed to prohibit work_on a national_holiday , to pay compensation for the holiday and require employees to make_up the time later . They are restricted however , as_to how the work is to be made_up . The employer cannot require a non-exempt employee to work more_than eight hours in any day or more_than 40 hours in any week , along with other requirements , without paying appropriate overtime compensation . Exempt employees have flexibility in work schedule requirements to meet productivity requirements of the employer . To the extent that an employer requires an exempt employee to make_up time missed on one day on another or give credit on one day for excess time worked_on another , the exempt status may be destroyed . As a result , the employer may have to comply with all_of the rules for non-exempt status , including overtime . If an employee is not_able to make_up the time on a Saturday or a Sunday because of religious_beliefs , or family care commitments , the employer must reasonably accommodate such concerns to avoid legal liability . -- Don D . Sessions , employee rights attorney , Mission Viejo Question : I read a story that suggested that even if you feel secure in your job that you should take additional training ( college courses or vocational_programs ) to make yourself more marketable in the event of an unexpected layoff . How should you go_about deciding what to study ? And how can you afford it if your current employer doesn ' t have a tuition reimbursement program ? -- T.D. , Sunset Beach Answer : Continued self-improvement , whether it be personal improvement or job-skill development , is always a good idea . Increasing job-related skills or knowledge not only increases your marketability as a potential worker , but it can also enhance your value to your current employer ( perhaps even making_it less likely that you would be laid_off ) . In order to determine a course_of_study , do a personal &quot; skill assessment. &quot; Ask yourself : What skills do I lack , or which could use updating ? ( Computer skills are often a good area for training or retraining , given that technology and software evolves rapidly ) . What kinds of skills are critical for the performance of my job , and how can these be enhanced ? How can I broaden myself to increase my present marketability as an employee ? In addition to evaluating your training needs , look_into the types of training_programs available through public institutions of higher learning , federally subsidized training_programs and through professional and community groups . Although continuing education through the regular programs offered by community_colleges , the Cal State University and University of California systems costs money , higher education in California is still quite a bargain . Regular students in California state colleges and universities pay only a small portion of the cost of the education they receive . Extended education programs through the universities , although more costly , are still quite affordable , and if they enhance your work-related skills they are cost-effective in the long_run . -- Ron Riggio , professor of industrial_psychology , Cal State Fullerton Question : My previous employer , which was a private company , made yearly contributions to an Employee Stock Ownership Program . I left the company last year and asked_for a distribution to my new retirement_program , since my last ESOP statement received in 1991 showed a significant value . However , I was told that the company had incurred significant debt and therefore the company -- and my ESOP account -- had little or no worth . Consequently , the ESOP administrator said that no new financial_statements would be prepared . When I contacted the Department_of_Labor ' s pension benefits department , I was told that the government is unable to force distributions from such qualified retirement_programs . Can a qualified retirement_program like an ESOP really be manipulated by company owners ? -- K.B. , Irvine Answer : No . The persons who operate an Employee_Stock_Ownership_Plan are &quot; fiduciaries , &quot; which means that they must operate the plan solely for the benefit of plan participants . If fiduciaries manipulate or use an ESOP for any other purpose , or if they mismanage the ESOP , they can be held liable for any losses that results . On the other hand , the fiduciaries of an ESOP normally would not be responsible_for a loss that the plan incurs from mismanagement of the company itself that causes a loss in the value of the stock unless they imprudently failed to take steps that were within their power that would have minimized or prevented the loss . The Department_of_Labor , by the way , can bring lawsuits to recover ESOP benefits for participants . Because of limited resources , however , it rarely does . -- Michael A . Hood , attorney , Paul , Hastings , Janofsky &amp; Walker</TEXT>
