   <HEADLINE> IN DEVELOPMENT : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; ' VIRTUAL BILLBOARD ' IS SIGN OF THE TIMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Baseball_teams would love the revenue from behind-the-batter billboards , and advertisers like the idea of being_on screen without fear of remote-control zapping . But purists denounce the idea as antithetical to the tradition of the game , and some players say the signs make_it harder to see the ball . Now inventors have devised a system that will create electronic billboards visible only to people watching on TV . Princeton Electronic Billboards Inc. in Princeton , N.J. , has been testing &quot; virtual billboards &quot; with the Baltimore_Orioles and its telecasters . Working with the David Sarnoff Research_Center , the firm developed a computerized system that inserts images electronically into TV_shows . Before a game , the TV cameras scan the arena and &quot; memorize &quot; features of the park , such_as creases in the padded wall behind home_plate and other boundaries that define a virtual billboard . When the camera passes those features during the telecast , the system inserts the sign , or the part of it visible in the camera ' s frame_of_reference . Ballplayers on the field appear to walk in front of the sign . Ideally , the TV_audience will be unable to tell whether the billboard hangs_in the ballpark or only in cyberspace . Local sponsors could buy a billboard in a national telecast , and a national advertiser could deliver different messages in each market . Princeton Electronic hopes to make the system available commercially before the baseball_season ends this fall . Designed to Be Disassembled : If you think products aren ' t made the way they used to be , you could be right . Anticipating the day when an old automobile or washing machine finally hits the junkyard , Rajit Gadh , a University of Wisconsin professor of mechanical_engineering , is conducting research into &quot; design for disassembly. &quot; Gadh ' s goal is the creation of products that could eventually be taken_apart as efficiently as they were put_together . This would make parts easier to service and would increase the potential for the products ' recycling . To find the ideal design , Gadh creates computer-generated three-dimensional models of geometric shapes interconnected like a jigsaw_puzzle . From these thousands of models , he looks_for shapes that lend themselves to disassembly . Engineers in Germany are particularly interested in Gadh ' s research . that ' s because Germany recently passed a law requiring all German-built automobiles to be recycled by the manufacturer . Look , No Battery : Daimler-Benz , using experience gained in applying fuel_cells to space technology , has developed an electric vehicle powered by a fuel_cell , eliminating the need for heavy batteries . The test vehicle , a Mercedes-Benz van known as Necar ( for &quot; new electric_car &quot; ) , has an electric_motor powered by energy from the fuel_cell , where hydrogen and oxygen from air form a chemical_reaction that creates electricity . At a later stage , the hydrogen fuel will be replaced by methanol , making_it possible , Mercedes hopes , to match the power output of conventional engines . Necar has been_on the road in Germany since the end of 1993 and has covered thousands of miles without any breakdown , Daimler-Benz says . But the test vehicle is still in the experimental stage . It will take several years to drastically reduce the size of the fuel_cell to make_it suitable for commercial use . KATHLEEN WIEGNER</TEXT>
