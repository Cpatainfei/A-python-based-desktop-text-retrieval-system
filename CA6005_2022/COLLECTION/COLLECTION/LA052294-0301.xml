   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 : 26 DAYS AND COUNTING ; DUTCH_TREAT ; AFTER UP-AND-DOWN YEARS , RUUD GULLIT IS UP FOR THE CUP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sun-splashed and star-studded , the training center for the Sampdoria football club is nestled in the green hills high above Genoa and the blue , blue Ligurian Sea of the Italian Riviera . The dirt trail to the training center can be found by following the dust of cars driven by ardent fans who soon will be watching the team practice . This beautiful setting has , until recently , been the turf of one of soccer ' s most volatile and brilliant players , Ruud Gullit of the_Netherlands . In Genoa , Gullit began his third incarnation as a soccer player , having moved from superstar to has-been and back to superstar , all with a stubborn style and rigorous adherence to a personal code . Reviled by some coaches as headstrong but loved by fans for his tenacity , Gullit , 31 , is now , again , a player who can win games for teams . But the road back has been circuitous . A star in the Dutch league , Gullit was lured to the lucrative but tempestuous Italian league , where he spent six years on one of the most powerful soccer teams in the world , AC Milan . In his first season , the club won the Italian championship and Gullit was named the best player in Europe . That was his first life . The next year , 1988 , Gullit injured his right knee in preseason training and missed most of the season . Pushing his rehab to the limit , he returned to the lineup near the end of the season ' s European Cup semifinals . He scored two goals and Milan won , but he reinjured his knee and had to miss the next season . Despite the injuries -- it wasn ' t only the right knee ; he has had four operations on his left -- Gullit was one of the sport ' s superstars and a regular on the Dutch national team . Until last year , when he moved_on to his second life . Gullit ' s career is lined with difficult and unpopular decisions . In his time with Milan he changed from star to highly paid bench sitter , falling victim to Milan ' s policy of stockpiling talented foreigners -- the team had six in Gullit ' s last season -- even though only three could play . Gullit publicly asked to be transferred , and Milan ' s flamboyant owner , Silvio Berlusconi , obliged , sending Gullit from the caldron of soccer fanaticism to the relative calm of Sampdoria . Later , Berlusconi , now the Prime_Minister of Italy , acknowledged that selling Gullit was a mistake . &quot; For a man of his status to admit he made a mistake , that makes him , as a person , richer , &quot; Gullit said . And Berlusconi was willing to do more_than say he had made a mistake . He was willing to rectify it . Next season in the Italian league , Gullit will be back with AC Milan . Leaving Milan for Sampdoria was difficult , and Gullit ' s situation was closely monitored by the soccer-loving Italian public . And during that unsettled period , Gullit was also having a public battle with Dick Advocaat , the coach of the Dutch national team . For a long_time , until early this year , it appeared that Gullit would not be a part of the 1994 World Cup . &quot; I ' m proud_of what I ' ve achieved , &quot; he said recently . &quot; Last year ( at Milan ) my status as a football_player was not good . Everyone said , ' He has knees of glass . He has no career . He can ' t play two matches in one week . He can ' t do this , he can ' t do that . He ' s finished. ' &quot; I couldn ' t do anything -- they would n ' t let me play . That was the politics of Milan . I said , ' OK , now I take everything into my hands. ' I said , ' Thank_you very much , now I am going away. ' Same with the Dutch team. &quot; Gullit ' s problems with Advocaat can be traced to World Cup qualifying and a match against England . In that game at Wembley , Advocaat chose to play Gullit on the right side . Accustomed to operating from the middle of the field , Gullit kept drifting to his more natural position and the Dutch coach took him out of the game , which ended in a 2-2 tie . Gullit publicly questioned Advocaat ' s tactics and his overall philosophy for the team . That Advocaat would bench one of the world ' s best players was a surprise surpassed only by Gullit ' s subsequent announcement that he would not play for the Dutch team as long as Advocaat was the coach . It was a bold but , at the time , well-calculated promise . The terms of Advocaat ' s contract called_for him to coach the Dutch team only through qualifying . If the team qualified , player-favorite Johan Cruyff was to coach the team in the World Cup_finals . Gullit liked and respected Cruyff and planned to rejoin the team at the World Cup . Advocaat did his part , but Cruyff and the Dutch federation could not come_to terms on a contract . Soon , Advocaat was back as coach and Gullit was left to deal with the fallout of_his_own words . The soccer world watched and waited to see how or if the impasse would be broken . The matter became even more pressing when Gullit enjoyed a successful season at Sampdoria and Dutch fans clamored for his inclusion on the World Cup team . Both men were allowed to save face . Advocaat traveled_to Italy and met with Gullit . &quot; We weren ' t enemies because we could understand each other very well , &quot; Gullit said . &quot; We only had different opinions about things . ( Like ) my position . In my opinion , the Dutch team didn ' t play well because of tactical reasons . He understands why I was not happy. &quot; If that sounds like something short of full resolution , Gullit said only that he will rejoin the Dutch team when it assembles Monday . &quot; I will see what happens , &quot; he added . * In 1987 , when Gullit was European player of the year , he dedicated his award to new South_African President Nelson Mandela . He said he was moved that Mandela ' s fight for human_rights in South_Africa had brought him imprisonment that , at the time , matched Gullit ' s life span . &quot; I could not imagine how that must feel , &quot; he said . Word of Gullit ' s gesture reached Mandela in prison . After Mandela ' s release in 1990 , Gullit said : &quot; This is the happiest day of my life -- and I am not on the soccer field. &quot; Gullit ' s off-field passions have always been more intense than those of many of his contemporaries . He was raised in Amsterdam by a white mother and black father , whose strict lessons taught Gullit self-sufficiency . &quot; As a youngster , I was a black guy and I played with all_the white guys , &quot; Gullit said . &quot; I knew that people noticed me . It is the same as ( if ) the team of Nigeria had a white guy . I said to myself , ' I must do my best . I have to work harder because everyone will notice me. ' So , I worked harder . &quot; My father came from Suriname ( a former Dutch territory in South_America ) . During the day he worked to pay_for his studies -- he wanted to be a teacher . He became a teacher , but he said , ' I have to be better. ' So , he worked hard . It was an attitude for him to work harder . Later on , it becomes a habit . &quot; It becomes a habit and you are used to doing_it in everything you do . You work hard for it . Nothing comes_by itself . You don ' t win the lottery and win $ 2 million . No , you have to work hard for it . Of course , sometimes you have bad moments . But to admire and enjoy the good moments , you have to have the bad ones so that you can see the difference. &quot; Gullit ' s parents insisted that their son never resort_to self-pity . When young Ruud announced he wanted to join a soccer club in Haarlem , outside Amsterdam , George and Ria Gullit gave him enough money for bus_fare and a bicycle . While other children left practice in car pools , Gullit rode his bike home , often in the rain . Gullit ' s father , who had played_on the national team of Suriname , attended Ruud ' s games but always left early . At night , father and son would discuss Ruud ' s play , especially his work ethic and discipline . &quot; Both my parents worked , but the nice thing I now understand is that they gave me a lot of responsibility , &quot; Gullit said . &quot; Because they had to work every day , I went_to school by myself . Sometimes , when my father or mother came_home late , I had to cook for myself . If I wanted to go_out , I had to iron my own shirt . That gave me a lot of responsibility . I ' m very , very glad they gave me that responsibility. &quot; * Gullit walks the line between confidence and arrogance well . He is engaging and bright in conversation and would prefer to discuss music or politics to soccer . But he understands and accepts his responsibilities . He is not an adherent of the I ' m-not-a-role-model philosophy of some pro athletes . &quot; I hope in my life to give something to life , &quot; he said . &quot; People go_to a match and want for one moment to forget their misery , or during the week , their boss shouting . &quot; I also hope to reach a lot of young people . Maybe you can use your popularity to talk_about other things that aren ' t only about scoring goals , but just about life itself . It ' s very hard in the moment . There is a lot of intolerance . It ' s because of the economy . If the economy doesn ' t go well , people always point their fingers to those who are less fortunate. &quot; A father of four , Gullit has always spent time with causes that seek to improve the children ' s lives . He said he doesn ' t know if his efforts to reach children or speak out against racism have had impact , but that will not prevent him from continuing . As long as he has a voice , the message will be heard . &quot; You get a lot of letters , but you don ' t know ( about impact ) , &quot; he said . &quot; You can ' t measure it . I think that people who have a certain popularity can reach people with a certain statement . You are not obliged to do_it , but if you feel_like it , why not ? &quot; People always ( interpret ) everything like they want : ' He says it because he ' s black . He says it for his popularity. ' It ' s always something . But I , as a person , don ' t care what they say . If I say something , they already know that I have said something , and I have accomplished what I want . They know exactly what I said -- that ' s already important . Then they can ( take ) any meaning they want. &quot; Take him or leave him -- soccer has done both to Ruud Gullit -- but don ' t ignore him , don ' t patronize him and don ' t fail to treat him with the courtesy he extends_to you .
