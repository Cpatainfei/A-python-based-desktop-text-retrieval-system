   <TEXT> Dale Riffle is dedicated to the once-chic , but now homeless . His beneficiaries wallow in the dirt , grunt rudely , and always act piggish . Riffle has turned five acres of farmland into a sanctuary for Vietnamese potbellied pigs , the fad pets of the 1980s whose lives now often end at the dog_pound or slaughterhouse . &quot; The majority of the general public thinks these pigs are going_to weigh 30 to 40 pounds and can live_in the house just like a cat or a dog , &quot; Riffle said . &quot; They were lied to . The pig got bigger than what they were told it would get . The pig is much more work than they were told it would be . It ' s more_than they can handle. &quot; Since 1992 , Riffle , 32 , and partner Jim Brewer , 41 , have provided a nonprofit home to &quot; miniature &quot; porkers as they work to find them futures that don ' t include bacon . &quot; We found_out that people were dumping them alongside the road or wherever they could to get_rid_of them , &quot; Riffle said . &quot; We thought , ' Somebody ' s got_to do something . Why not us ? ' &quot; Riffle gave_up a home near Annapolis , Md. , and a career as head of a mail-order catalogue department for a Washington nonprofit agency . He runs the farm with the help of tax-free donations and some monthly stipends from former pig owners . The native Asian pigs , less than one-fifth the size of a domestic pig , first entered the United States in 1988 for zoos and quickly became a novelty pet for the wealthy , selling for as much as $ 25 # 000 . &quot; A litter of six could be worth $ 50 # 000 , &quot; said Susan Armstrong , president of the 250-member North_American Potbellied Pig Assn . &quot; It became a very lucrative business for a very short time. &quot; With excessive breeding , prices dropped to $ 400 by 1990 and pigs surfaced at flea_markets and auctions , and in newspaper_ads . Billed as the new house pet , the pigs were promoted as intelligent , friendly animals that could live_in apartments and condos with no fuss or , just as important , no muss . But Riffle says size was relative and many of those &quot; miniature &quot; pigs grew to more_than 200 pounds . Too many times , the pigs showed their nasty sides , turning_on spouses , visitors and children , he said . &quot; I swallowed the bait on my first pig , &quot; said Barbara Boughton , 39 , of Winchester , Va . &quot; He was supposed to be cute and weigh 40 pounds . Not true . This guy was somewhere near 300 pounds and mean as a snake . Anyone that came_to visit had to put their running_shoes on because he would go_after everyone. &quot; He said more_than half the 82 pigs at his sanctuary were left because they were what he calls &quot; attack pigs. &quot; Many involved owners who found their child ' s arm or leg in the pig ' s mouth . Potbellied pig breeder Gerald Brown Jr . of Honeybrook , Pa. , calls that kind of criticism hogwash . &quot; Eighty-five percent of the problem pigs this man is talking_about can be straightened_out , &quot; Brown said . &quot; that ' s poor training . that ' s letting that pig rule you . They ' ll outthink a human quicker than you would even know . &quot; There are some crazy pigs , but a majority of the pigs can be corrected by putting that pig in his place. &quot; Since the first 14 pigs were brought_to the country through Canada in the late 1980s , the nation ' s potbellied pig population now numbers more_than 200 # 000 , and an Indiana registry service , the largest of three , has papers on more_than 21 # 000 , Armstrong said . Brown said people also are drawn to potbellies because they don ' t bother allergy sufferers , have no odor-producing sweat_glands , don ' t get fleas and can be trained to use a litter box . They are normally between 18 and 24 inches tall and can be 4 feet long . The pigs also have a swayed back and a potbelly , while a domestic pig has an arched back . Unlike the curly tail of the domestic pig , potbellies have straight tails that , like dogs , wag when they are happy . &quot; You can teach a pig to do anything , &quot; Brown said . &quot; You can teach a dog something and a pig will do_it better. &quot; Armstrong , who sees the pigs ' popularity continuing to spiral upward , says Riffle merely sees the worst cases . Riffle argues that it was just unfair to bring them into the country . &quot; In the United States , 12 million dogs and cats are killed every year because they can ' t find homes for them , &quot; Riffle said . &quot; Why do we need another domestic pet ? We can ' t even take_care of what we ' ve got. &quot; Riffle ' s pigs are kept_in a dozen herds ranging_in size from two to 14 , living either in barns or sheds . Each area has a fenced run where the pigs can roam or take a dip in a plastic wading pool during warm weather . But finding new homes for the pigs is a problem . Just 10 left the sanctuary last year despite tours and advertisements . &quot; About half of the calls were people who wanted to eat them , &quot; Riffle said .</TEXT>
