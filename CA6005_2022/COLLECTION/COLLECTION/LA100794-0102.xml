   <HEADLINE> CULT LEADER SHOWS HISTORY OF ELUSIVENESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whether dead or in hiding , Luc Jouret , the 46-year-old Congo-born cult leader who founded the doomed Order of the Solar Temple , is proving as elusive as ever , confounding efforts to fathom the nature of his organization . Newspaper_headlines describe his temple as a doomsday cult , a charge seemingly borne_out by the death of more_than 50 members this week -- 48 in Switzerland and four in Quebec . Specialists say , however , that , while in Quebec , Jouret never preached death in apocalypse but instead focused_on survival of the elite after a cataclysmic crisis . Spurred by complaints from parents of child cult members and from disgruntled former members , Quebec officials suspected that Jouret was up_to something untoward but could never find evidence to prove it . Even a gun conviction against him proved so minor that the judge sentenced him only to donate $ 1 # 000 to the Canadian Red_Cross . Jouret , a homeopathic doctor who received his medical degree in Brussels , was so persuasive and personable that Hydro-Quebec , the government-owned power_company , paid him $ 4 # 394 in 1988 and 1989 to lecture employees on self-awareness and motivation -- and paid the employees $ 3 # 106 to listen . Later , when the cult fell_under suspicion , Hydro-Quebec investigated his link to its employees but uncovered nothing illegal . When transmission towers were sabotaged , suspicion fell on the cult again , but no evidence was found linking members to the damage . Bertrand Ouellet of the Center for Information on New Religions in Montreal told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp . that the deaths were puzzling because the Solar Temple did &quot; not fit the profile of a Bible-reading apocalyptic group. &quot; Instead , he said , Jouret and his followers , while they were sure a terrible crisis was impending , envisioned themselves as medieval Knights_Templar who would survive the crisis and lead new generations to a better world . Yves Casgain , a researcher for Info-Cult , a private Montreal organization that studies cults in Quebec , agreed with Ouellet that it is a mistake to believe all such cults must follow the Jonestown and Waco examples and end in suicide and murder . In Jonestown , Guyana , in 1978 , 913 cultists took their own lives . Last year in Waco , Tex. , about 80 members of the Branch Davidians died during a battle with federal_agents . But Casgain said in an interview that the Solar Temple group may have changed its view of the world after troubles in Quebec last year . He said this was implied in a letter and documents apparently mailed before the fires in Switzerland and received Thursday by cult researcher Jean-Francois Mayer in the_Swiss city of Lausanne . Mayer told the CBC that the documents show that the cult members believed there was &quot; a wide conspiracy against them. &quot; Casgain , who never met Jouret , studied the cult after various complaints were filed against it with the police . The accusers insisted that Jouret was forcing people to remain in the group against their will . &quot; I found that there was a certain amount of control of people , a certain amount of pressure , &quot; he said . &quot; But we could not find the evidence to support the accusations. &quot; Jouret was born in the old Belgian_Congo , now Zaire , and grew_up in Belgium , where he was educated , graduating in medicine from the Free University of Brussels in 1974 . He practiced in Europe , India , Africa , China , the Philippines and Peru but was not recognized by the Quebec Corp . of Physicians to practice in Canada . During this period , evidently after a spiritual awakening in the Philippines , Jouret founded the cult . Jouret and his followers , mainly Swiss and French , moved to Quebec sometime in the mid-1980s . Jouret reportedly believed that Quebec would be one of the parts of the globe least affected by the impending and forbidding crisis that awaited the world . The cult bought expensive properties north of Montreal , including an old monastery on 100 acres of land that it turned_into an organic farm . Jouret became a much sought-after speaker , especially by Montreal businesses that wanted him to motivate their workers . He published a book in 1992 titled &quot; Medicine and Conscience , &quot; in which he wrote that people are worn down by their own egocentric perception of life . &quot; Our bodies weaken under a constant stress , poisoned by fear of the future , &quot; he wrote . His problems developed in 1993 , when police began investigating the complaints . The most vocal complaint came from Rose-Marie Klaus , an ex-member who accused the cult of brainwashing people like herself and her Swiss husband into giving_up their savings . &quot; Jouret thinks he ' s Christ , &quot; she told reporters then . &quot; He told people that a great cataclysm is going_to take_place and that only the elected will survive . He persuaded several people to leave Europe , sell everything and invest in his project ( the organic farm ) . &quot; Police put Jouret and the cult under surveillance , wiretapped his phones and even staged a raid that netted a_few guns . The guns led to charges that prompted Jouret to flee Quebec . He returned a_few months later , however , and was found guilty with two others of illegal arms possession . Jouret insisted that the guns had been acquired only to protect members , and the judge accepted the explanation , meting out fines that were to be paid to the Red_Cross as contributions . Powered by the news of the bloody raids on the Waco sect , rumors and reports spread about the Order of the Solar Temple . The cult was suspected of being behind a shadowy group that had plotted the assassination of a Quebec minister and of destroying two Hydro-Quebec transmission towers . But no evidence was ever found . Police believe that there are perhaps 100 members of the cult still in Quebec . Fearing mass deaths like those in Switzerland , officers have been posted on their compounds . Most cult members refused to talk with reporters , but some , especially those on the organic farm , insisted that they had broken_with Jouret after he armed some members for protection . There was shock in Quebec over the deaths of friends in Switzerland . In Richelieu , where the town flag flew at half-staff Thursday , colleagues insisted that Mayor Robert Ostiguy and his wife , who were among several Quebeckers who died Wednesday , could not have killed themselves . &quot; It has to be murder , &quot; said town Councilman Michel Deroche . &quot; I knew them too well. &quot;</TEXT>
