   <TEXT> For the first time in its four-year history , this summer ' s &quot; Lollapalooza &quot; tour is saving its best for last . After seeing support bands overshadow the headliners in past extravaganzas , the top-billed Smashing Pumpkins defied the odds here Thursday with an assurance and drama that even Vegas casino high-rollers would admire . In the opening stop of a 31-city tour that reaches Southern California in September , the Pumpkins -- led by singer-guitarist Billy Corgan -- played with a spellbinding urgency that far surpassed everything else on the nine-hour bill . The Pumpkins ' accomplishment was all_the more compelling because the Chicago quartet -- whose expressions of youthful melancholia and desire combine beauty and force with a sometimes &quot; Layla &quot; -like grace and reach -- wasn ' t just competing against seven other acts at the Sam Boyd Silver Bowl stadium . It also competed against the ghost of Nirvana . The hardest challenge facing any concert tour is the idea of &quot; what might have been. &quot; And that challenge hovered over &quot; Lollapalooza ' 94 &quot; because Nirvana , the most-acclaimed rock_group of the ' 90s , had been scheduled to headline the annual summer showcase of alternative rock . Smashing Pumpkins , one of Nirvana ' s two or three chief rivals , was to have been the support band that preceded it on stage each night . But Cobain ' s suicide in April eliminated the chance to see how these two great young bands would respond to playing back-to-back -- whether the competition would push both to new heights . Without Nirvana , the prospects for &quot; Lollapalooza ' 94 &quot; went from a historic matchup to simply a solid lineup -- one that also ranged from rap ' n ' rollers the Beastie Boys to funk legend George Clinton . Cobain ' s loss was felt at the box_office and in the audience . Sales have been robust on most &quot; Lollapalooza ' 94 &quot; stops around the country , including Cal State Dominguez Hills ' Festival Field , where the tour comes Sept . 4 and 5 . But Thursday was &quot; Lollapalooza ' s &quot; first trip to this desert city and the package apparently needed a stronger name -- a Nirvana or Pearl Jam -- to lure fans to an outdoor show in the blistering heat . Fewer than half of the available 22 # 000 tickets were sold in_advance and the walk-up Thursday appeared slight . Nirvana would have meant an extra 6 # 000 sales , one insider speculated . Though none of the musicians mentioned Cobain on stage , it was_on the minds of some backstage and some members of the audience . Only 30 minutes after the stadium gates were opened at 11 a.m. , a song was dedicated to Cobain by a performer in the &quot; open mike &quot; tent set_aside for budding spoken-word artists and acoustic songwriters . &quot; I am a pied piper , &quot; Andy Hall , 21 , sang , delivering a cynical tale about pop stardom . Asked afterward if he thought Cobain ' s death took some of the wind out of the concert , he said , &quot; Sure , we still feel his loss . You don ' t get_over something like that quickly. &quot; Another fan in the tent agreed : &quot; He ' ll be remembered the same way Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin and Otis Redding are remembered. &quot; All this mourning for Cobain put added pressure Thursday on the Smashing Pumpkins , who moved_into the headline slot after Nirvana dropped_off . Would some underdog emerge from the pack to overshadow the Pumpkins -- the way Nine Inch Nails did_in 1991 ( upstaging Jane ' s Addiction ) , Ministry in 1992 ( over the Red Hot Chili_Peppers ) and Rage Against the Machine last year ( over Alice in Chains and Primus ) ? The music on the main stage began at 1 p.m. with the Boredoms , a band from Japan that uses aggressive vocal punctuation as a distinguishing element . That experimental edge asks a lot of an audience -- more_than the sun-drenched fans were willing to give on a day when the temperature on the artificial turf in front of the stage was estimated at 110 degrees . For much of the early hours of the festival , fans seemed more concerned with putting_on sunscreen and walking through the cooling Mist Tents than watching bands or exploring the dazzling array of high-tech , interactive devices on display near the parking_lot . L7 , the Los Angeles quartet , played its likable brand of straight-ahead rock , but was largely anonymous in the stadium setting . The Breeders , a more original and inviting foursome , also had trouble establishing a rapport . A Tribe Called Quest , pioneers of the growing jazz-rap fusion , delivered a respectable set , though it too was relatively faceless . No way to miss George Clinton and his crew , who gave a lively crash course in funk dynamics and costuming ( one male guitarist wore a wedding_dress , while a second wore only a large diaper ) . The Beastie Boys , who preceded the Pumpkins on stage , unleashed a glorious assault built around beats that hit fast and hard , backed by disarming street-wise raps that keep pace quite remarkably . Yet the three Beasties still haven ' t developed much of a stage presence , except for the bouncing-ball energy associated with rap since the early days of Run-DMC . Of all_the support acts , however , Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds emerged with the most riveting performance because Australian native Cave ' s Southern Gothic rock vision offered the day ' s most radical twist . Though Cave has been a critical favorite for years , he still seemed largely a stranger to most of the young audience . Fans gazed uncertainly at the fire_and_brimstone of his stark and flailing manner . There was no such uncertainty when the Pumpkins took_the_stage around 9 p.m. As the crowd on the field surged forward , Corgan stepped confidently to the microphone and played with the obsession and command of rock ' s most charismatic stars . Last year at the Palladium in Hollywood , Corgan was clearly a major talent , but there was a hesitancy in his manner -- as if he was either not secure about his own skills or uncertain about his emerging leadership role in rock . No such doubts now . For all_the talk_about the &quot; Lollapalooza &quot; concept being more important to rock audiences than the individual bands on the bill , it is the magic of a great presentation that you remember most each summer . This summer , the Pumpkins should fuel those memories .</TEXT>
