   <HEADLINE> U.S. TROOPS MOVE TO DISARM HAITI ' S MAIN MILITARY BASE ; OCCUPATION : AMERICAN OFFICIALS , PRO-DEMOCRACY LEADERS MEET IN BID TO SET_UP NEW GOVERNMENT . CLARIFIED RULES PERMIT FORCE TO HALT VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As U.S. Special Forces troops occupied Haiti ' s only major military complex Thursday with the cooperation of Haitian soldiers , American officials began meeting with local pro-democracy leaders in an effort to swiftly re-establish an alternative government to the dictatorship that the Americans came_to evict . And while U.S. soldiers expanded their contact with the Haitian people , American military_leaders sought to clarify the rules of engagement , stressing that U.S. troops will now be allowed to use force to stop attacks by the Haitian army and police against local civilians . U.S. officials said soldiers are being told to use their &quot; best judgment &quot; about when to use force , and stressed that the decision on whether to intervene is still up_to commanders on the scene . The rules of engagement became a source of controversy in the opening days of the Haiti operation after at least one Haitian was killed by local police near the port of the capital , Port-au-Prince , as U.S. troops guarding the installation looked_on . But Thursday , American soldiers received Haitian help as they began disarming Camp D ' Application , known as Heavy_Weapons Company . The site is Haiti ' s only major military complex , which includes its military_academy , just outside Port-au-Prince . Throughout the day , the troops confiscated machine_guns , mortars , small missiles and ammunition belts , while Bradley fighting vehicles were brought_in to tow away larger artillery , armored vehicles and gun systems . Haitian soldiers traveled side_by_side with Americans in trucks carrying_away the munitions . Gen . Richard Potter , commander of the special forces , said his troops had occupied the complex without incident Wednesday afternoon , after meetings between U.S. and Haitian military_leaders . Potter said the Haitian troops have been cooperative , adding : &quot; But they don ' t have any choice , do they ? &quot; Meanwhile , U.S. officials said that Gen . David Meade , commander of the Army forces in Haiti , and U.S. Ambassador William L . Swing met with Haitian labor , business and civic_leaders Thursday in an effort to explain the U.S. role here and speed the process of re-establishing democracy -- even though exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has not fully endorsed the agreement struck between the Clinton_Administration and the Haitian rulers to restore him to power . U.S. officials said they expect the democratically elected Aristide to return to Haiti by Oct . 15 , the deadline by which army commander Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras has agreed to give_up power . In the meantime , they said they hope to begin reinstalling democratically elected officials -- many of whom are in hiding or in exile -- before Aristide ' s return . For example , U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager said that the Americans hope to help Port-au-Prince ' s elected mayor , Evans Paul , return from hiding and resume his post as mayor of the city . Shrager added that as U.S. troops begin to move beyond Port-au-Prince into other towns and villages , pro-democracy leaders who have been in hiding will be reinstalled in those places as well . And officials said the United States is also working to reassemble Haiti ' s Parliament as quickly as possible so it can vote on an amnesty agreement -- part of the accord negotiated last weekend -- that members of the military regime demanded before they will leave power . The government of provisional President Emile Jonassaint said in a statement Thursday that it will formally ask Parliament to go_into special_session to pass the amnesty for crimes committed by the military and its supporters since the September , 1991 , coup that overthrew Aristide . The Jonassaint government also said it will soon announce a timetable for the election of more_than 2 # 000 new senators , deputies , mayors and other officials . Among other serious concerns of American officials here has been the political impact of the beating incidents earlier this week . In a press briefing Thursday afternoon , Col . John Altenburg , the U.S. Army ' s chief lawyer for the Haiti operation , said that the confusion over the issue of intervention came because of the last-minute change in the nature of the Haiti operation , from invasion to peaceful entry into the country . The Pentagon had prepared two sets of rules of engagement -- one for an invasion and a second in case the military dictatorship fled before a U.S. arrival . Altenburg said the Army had not really planned for a peaceful entry while the military dictators were still in place . At the same time , U.S. commanders wanted to get their forces organized and established before getting involved in local affairs . Additionally , U.S. commanders agreed after U.S. troops landed Monday to give Cedras time to curb his forces ' activities . Altenburg said Thursday that U.S. officers believed that they owed Cedras the chance to take_care of the situation himself . But by Thursday , it was clear that U.S. patience with Cedras and the Haitian military and police had run_out . Officials said that Col . Michael Sullivan , commander of the U.S. Army ' s 16th Military_Police Brigade , met with Michel-Joseph Francois , the Port-au-Prince police_chief and a key member of the military regime , to tell him that U.S. forces will now forcibly stop any attacks on the Haitian people by other Haitians . &quot; They now are able to use force against the Haitian police , &quot; Altenburg said . Still , many U.S. soldiers , including a 1 # 000-member unit of military_police newly arrived in Haiti , said Thursday that they had not yet been told of the new guidelines and were still under specific orders not to interfere . &quot; As it stands now , we ' re not supposed to intervene , &quot; said Sgt . Gorney Claywell of the 16th Military_Police Brigade . &quot; We haven ' t heard anything different , &quot; said Pvt . Shane Nye of the MP brigade . Despite the continued presence in the country of the military dictators , the reality of the overwhelming force that the United States has brought_in -- including more_than 9 # 000 soldiers -- has clearly begun to sink_in with the Haitian rulers . By Thursday , local armed personnel were no longer much in_evidence on the streets . The most striking example of the U.S. dominance was the scene at the Heavy_Weapons Company , where as Potter spoke , an AC-130 gunship circled overhead . Its task would have been to devastate Camp D ' Application with machine-gun and cannon_fire if the invasion had taken_place . Potter , a gruff , old-school Army_officer in the Gen . H . Norman Schwarzkopf mold , dismissed Haiti ' s military equipment as 15 to 20 years out of date and said that only half of it , at most , was operational . He added that he had been given a complete inventory of Haitian weaponry from U.S. intelligence sources , and that &quot; according to U.S. intelligence , I ' ve got_it all. &quot; The camp ' s soccer field , where the Americans gathered all_of the Haitian army ' s major weapons and vehicles , was to have been a landing site for soldiers flown in from the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba . The troops , many of whom were selected because they speak French or Creole , said they were rapidly building an easy rapport with the Haitian troops who were helping them confiscate their country ' s weapons . While Haitian officers watched silently , refusing to talk to reporters , Haitian enlisted men cooperated so_much that they even pointed_out weapons that U.S. troops had missed in their initial search . &quot; Last night , after we got here , we stayed_up talking to some of them until 2 in the morning , just getting_to know each other , &quot; said Sgt . Rhette Watts of the 3rd Special Forces_unit , as he watched Haitian soldiers load munitions into a truck for the American military . &quot; They are just as curious about us as we are about them. &quot;</TEXT>
