   <HEADLINE> SOME TV_STATIONS DROP ANTI-SMOKING AD ; HEALTH : STATE-FUNDED COMMERCIAL SHOWS TOBACCO EXECUTIVES TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESS . R.J. REYNOLDS CHAIRMAN HAS THREATENED LIBEL ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some California television_stations , including KABC in Los Angeles , have dropped a state-funded anti-smoking ad after being threatened with a libel action by the chairman of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . -- one of four top tobacco_industry executives shown testifying before Congress that nicotine is not addictive . In a letter to S . Kimberly Belshe , director of the state_Department of Health Services , which paid_for the commercial , lawyers for R.J. Reynolds Chairman James W . Johnston say that the ad falsely makes_it appear that Johnston was lying to Congress . Similar letters were sent to the 22 California television_stations carrying the ad -- one of a series in an anti-smoking education program paid_for by a special 25-cent-a-pack cigarette tax approved by the state ' s voters in 1988 . The ad begins with top tobacco company executives taking an oath to tell the truth in their testimony before Congress . In one brief sequence , Johnston is shown testifying : &quot; Cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definitions of addiction . There is no intoxication. &quot; Faintly in the background , the segment repeats the voice of the congressman who chaired the hearing saying the words &quot; under oath. &quot; After other executives also deny that nicotine is addictive , an announcer states : &quot; Now the tobacco_industry is trying to tell us that secondhand smoke isn ' t dangerous. &quot; Then appearing on the screen are the words : &quot; Do they think we ' re stupid ? &quot; In their letter to state health officials , Johnston ' s attorneys contend that the producers of the ad took &quot; electronic liberties &quot; in making the commercial . &quot; The effect intended , and accomplished , was to suggest to the viewers that the words ' under oath , under oath , ' were said at the hearing , &quot; they wrote . &quot; The addition of these words creates the perception that Mr. Johnston committed perjury. &quot; In a strongly worded response , Belshe denied that the ad defamed Johnston . She complained of heavy-handed tactics . &quot; It has come_to my attention that threats of legal_action have been used in an attempt to coerce individual stations to remove these commercials from the air . This strong-arm tactic to subvert the intent of the voter-approved Proposition 99 media campaign constitutes an objectionable act of desperation. &quot; In an interview Thursday , Belshe reiterated that the health department sticks_by its ad . &quot; We flatly deny allegations of defamation , &quot; she said . &quot; The issue of the ads is not the veracity of any individual . The issue of the ads is the credibility of the tobacco industry. &quot; She said the repetition of the words &quot; under oath &quot; was &quot; an artistic device &quot; not intended to be taken_for what was said during Johnston ' s testimony . KABC official Georgia Seid said her station ' s reasons for halting the commercial would have to come from Capital Cities-ABC in New York . But she confirmed that the station had asked the Department of Health Services to modify the commercial , which state officials refused to do . According to department spokesman Kenneth A . August , station KBHK in San Francisco also dropped the ad .</TEXT>
