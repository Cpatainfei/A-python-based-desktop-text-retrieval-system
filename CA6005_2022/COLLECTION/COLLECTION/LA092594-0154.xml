   <HEADLINE> FOR SENIORS ; WHEELCHAIR HOSTESS SAYS : ' LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL ! '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sue Gordon remembers all too clearly the day she was shopping at the market and someone asked her how she managed to get her wheelchair into bed at night . &quot; I was so taken_aback by that question that I just rolled away , &quot; she recalled . &quot; But later , after I told friends , I thought_of a_few answers I should have given like : ' I have this huge ramp in my bedroom and I just slide_down it into bed , ' or , ' A sky hook hangs from the ceiling and hoists me like a piece of lumber into bed. ' &quot; For 20 years Gordon , 50 , has had multiple_sclerosis , a chronic disease that attacks the central_nervous_system . She uses a wheelchair but is not &quot; confined or bound &quot; to it , she is quick to say . She ' s not house-bound either . &quot; Terms like these , &quot; she said , &quot; conjure_up images which are simply not true. &quot; What is true is that people who use wheelchairs don ' t get_to go_to many parties . So Gordon created a way to bring a_few laughs into the lives of other disabled people by organizing Sue ' s Socialites -- monthly parties for disabled people of all ages . She has been organizing them for 17 years with the help of her parents , Shirley and Chick Schneider . On a recent Saturday , they arrived_at Mother ' s Beach in Marina del Rey at 7 a.m. to secure a section of the picnic table area for Gordon ' s last summer beach party , to take_place at noon . &quot; She puts this together on_her_own . Her whole life is her telephone . We ' re here to do what we can do because it ' s very important to have the socializing -- it ' s the one thing that ' s missing when it comes_to services for the disabled , &quot; said Shirley Schneider , 76 . Chick Schneider , 80 , is not one for words . He acted_as a waiter to the more_than 40 guests and did other chores . He usually does the shopping . &quot; These are Sue ' s kids and we ' re the mama and papa , &quot; Chick Schneider said . What Gordon accomplishes from her wheelchair is micro-management at its best . Her first parties were organized with a list of people interested in attending provided by the Westside Center for Independent Living . Through word_of_mouth , the parties have grown . During the holiday season , about 90 people attend ; about 60 showed for a recent party . Joe Zenzola , a retired graphic_artist , helped Gordon when she first started the parties . They used to go shopping together . He has spina_bifida -- a congenital_disorder of the spine . &quot; It ' s very important for people in wheelchairs to get_away from their everyday environment as well as for the general public to see us as individuals having a good time , &quot; he said . Gordon is undaunted by the task of organizing the party , which includes ensuring that people have transportation . &quot; I ' m not the type to ask_for help , I only give it . It doesn ' t make ( sense ) to sit home and watch the grass grow , I had to do something , &quot; she said . Gordon persuaded Cantor ' s Deli to donate potato_salad and cookies for the recent party . Shirley Schneider and many others cook . Although Gordon charges a nominal fee of $ 5 per person , it doesn ' t come_close to the $ 350 monthly cost for the special transportation needed for people using wheelchairs . Money is always a problem . &quot; I don ' t have the funds , so I have to get donations and I ' m running_out , which means I ' ll have to do less parties , &quot; Gordon said . &quot; When I started it , I never thought it would grow , but the more the merrier . . . let ' s have lots and lots of people. &quot; Sue ' s Socialites : ( 310 ) 836-1400 .</TEXT>
