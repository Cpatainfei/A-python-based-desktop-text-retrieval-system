   <HEADLINE> DELTA CUTS CONTINUE WITH 4 # 500 CUSTOMER SERVICE JOBS ; AIRLINES : THE LATEST ROUND WILL BRING THE CARRIER ABOUT HALFWAY TO ITS RESTRUCTURING GOAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Delta Air Lines Inc. said Monday that it will eliminate 4 # 500 full-time jobs from its customer service division over the next 12 months , continuing a cost-cutting effort to become more competitive . The reductions are expected to contribute to the division ' s goal of achieving $ 175 million to $ 250 million in annual savings for the company , the nation ' s No . 3 airline . The latest round of job cuts represents about 20 % of the customer service unit , Delta spokesman Bill Berry said . The carrier also cut 2 # 500 jobs last month from its technical operations division -- about 20 % of that unit -- as part of the restructuring . With the latest cuts , Delta is about halfway to its goal of cutting as_many as 15 # 000 jobs in a bid to lower annual operating_costs by about $ 2 billion by June , 1997 . It has said it will save $ 100 million a year by removing 13 A-310 Airbuses from its fleet . It will also revamp its short-haul operations . Like other major airlines in the highly competitive U.S. market , Delta has been hit by massive losses in recent years . Its results improved in the most recent fiscal quarter ended April 29 , but it still reported a deficit of $ 77.9 million , about half the prior year ' s $ 152.3 million in red ink . Full-service airlines such_as Delta have been forced to cut expenses in_order to compete in the low-fare environment . The company has already said it will get_rid_of unprofitable routes . Cargo handling , ticket counter customer assistance and other airport operations will be reviewed for trimming . &quot; We ' re simply working_through the divisions , &quot; Berry said . &quot; No division is exempt. &quot; Delta said the job cuts will be made_possible by increasing the use of flexible work scheduling and part-time personnel , changing the way some jobs are performed , eliminating unnecessary processes and taking_advantage of more outsourcing opportunities . Delta declined to provide time frames for staff reductions in specific cities , but said that employees will be offered voluntary departure incentives before layoffs are made . W . Martin Braham , Delta ' s senior_vice_president responsible_for airport customer service , said reducing costs to make the airline competitive and ensure its survival requires difficult steps . Delta ' s stock closed_down 87.5 cents at $ 47.625 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING</TEXT>
