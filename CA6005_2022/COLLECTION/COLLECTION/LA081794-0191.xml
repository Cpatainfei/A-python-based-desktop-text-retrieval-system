   <HEADLINE> U.S. , JAPAN SIGN ACCORD ON PATENT LAW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Trade negotiators from the United States and Japan , struggling to keep rising trade tensions from escalating into economic warfare , signed an agreement Tuesday to bring their divergent patent laws for software and other intellectual property into line . Hammering out an agreement has been a top priority for U.S. software designers , who have complained for years about weak or nonexistent legal safeguards that have allowed overseas competitors to pirate their products . Provisions in the accord will take_effect by 1996 . Signed by Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown and Japanese Ambassador Takakazu Kuriyama , the settlement calls_for a major overhaul of the Japanese patent_system , which U.S. trade officials said has undercut American inventors ' efforts to enter the Asian marketplace . Changes in the U.S. system will be comparatively minor . To enact the changes in the U.S. and Japanese systems , Brown and Kuriyama will introduce bills to their nation ' s lawmakers next month after negotiators have closed the current round of trade talks . Reaching a consensus on the patent_system represents one of the few bright spots in the talks , which have been bogged down by disputes over an array of issues , including automobiles and pharmaceuticals . Announcement of the agreement may ease U.S.-Japanese friction over patents , which give inventors the exclusive_right to market their products . U.S. inventors have criticized the Japanese system for failing to protect information contained in patent filings from pirates . Japan has derided the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for being too secretive . With the settlement , U.S. inventors who have had an &quot; awfully tough &quot; time penetrating the Japanese market will have an easier time competing , said Bruce Lehman , commissioner of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , which issues about 100 # 000 patents annually . Patent violations in Asia cost U.S. innovators more_than $ 10 billion a year , Lehman said . The agreement will change longstanding rules_in both countries . In Japan , the accord will bar Japanese inventors from opposing patents sought by foreigners before they are granted . The agreement will also establish an accelerated application_program in Japan to enable inventors to obtain a yes-or-no response to their patent request within three years instead of the usual five . U.S. innovators will also be able to file patent_applications in English for the first time . The Japanese Patent_Office will stop awarding compulsory licenses , which force foreign inventors to give_up their exclusive_rights by licensing rivals to use their technology . In the United States , officials will start publishing pending patent_applications 18 months after they are filed -- a step Japanese inventors hope will eliminate &quot; submarine &quot; patents , so called because previously unknown inventors can suddenly surface and demand royalties on a product before anyone knew a patent had been granted . U.S. patents will also be valid for 20 years after the application is filed -- similar to patents issued in other countries -- instead of 17 years after the patent is issued . But the accord did not resolve Japanese complaints about the U.S. practice of granting patents only to the inventor of a product rather than to the first applicant . Most countries around the world employ a first-come , first-served system but U.S. patent officials have resisted pressure to change . Saying that the Clinton_Administration has made progress in &quot; resolving some longstanding difficulties , &quot; Brown promised that the agreement will help U.S. inventors win better access to Japanese markets .</TEXT>
