   <HEADLINE> BROADER NATO MAY BRING ' COLD PEACE , ' YELTSIN WARNS ; EUROPE : RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ACCUSES U.S. OF BEING POWER HUNGRY . SPEECH COMES AS NATIONS FINALIZE NUCLEAR TREATY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Caustically suggesting that Washington wants to run the world , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin told President Clinton on Monday that a U.S.-led plan to expand NATO threatens to plunge Europe &quot; into a cold peace. &quot; &quot; History demonstrates that it is a dangerous delusion to suppose that the destinies of continents and of the world community in_general can somehow be managed from one single capital , &quot; Yeltsin said in his speech to a summit of the 53-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe . Yeltsin ' s speech rekindled Cold_War tensions on a day in which the United States , Russia and three other former Soviet republics finally completed the complex ratification process for the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks treaty signed_in 1991 after a decade of U.S.-Soviet negotiations . The treaty requires destruction of almost half of the nuclear_weapons in the Washington and Moscow arsenals . Yeltsin ' s outburst -- combined with an anguished protest from Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic that the failure of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and the United Nations to prevent Serbian aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina has discredited the United Nations and ruined NATO -- struck a discordant note in what otherwise was a bland but optimistic assessment of the past successes and future prospects of the CSCE , an organization of European and North_American_countries created two decades ago as a Cold_War bridge between East and West . The Russian president spoke immediately after Clinton delivered an upbeat assessment of post-Cold War Europe , saying that the blood-soaked 20th Century can give_way to a new century of peace and prosperity . &quot; The end of the Cold_War presents us with the opportunity to fulfill the promise of democracy and freedom , &quot; Clinton said . But Washington ' s chosen instrument for ensuring European security in the 21st Century -- a gradual expansion to the East of the 16-nation NATO -- drew a blunt rebuke from Yeltsin . &quot; We hear explanations to the effect that this is allegedly the expansion of stability , just in case there are undesirable developments in Russia , &quot; Yeltsin said sarcastically . &quot; If the objective is to bring NATO up_to Russia ' s borders , let me say one thing : It is too early to bury a democratic Russia. &quot; U.S. officials generally offered a low-key response to Yeltsin ' s comments . One senior official suggested that the remarks were directed at Russian public_opinion , while other officials said that Yeltsin and other Russian leaders take a much more relaxed view of NATO expansion in private than Yeltsin ' s speech would imply . Western European officials also downplayed the harsh implications of Yeltsin ' s remarks . &quot; It was very moderate and almost philosophical ; it was the minimum that a Russian president would have to say in such a situation , &quot; one German diplomat said . But Central Europeans knocking eagerly at NATO ' s door said they fear that Yeltsin is bent_on slowing_down , if not stopping , the Atlantic Alliance ' s eastward expansion . Without mentioning Russia by name , Polish President Lech Walesa said no country should be given veto power over another country ' s application to NATO , sentiments echoed by Clinton in his remarks . One Central European diplomat said former Warsaw Pact members fear that Yeltsin ' s tough talk could introduce a new element of uncertainty into NATO ' s expansion plans at a time when the alliance can ill-afford more turmoil . &quot; He may just want to delay any new members from joining NATO , &quot; a Hungarian diplomat said . &quot; But in this world , when you delay something , who knows what could happen in the meantime ? &quot; Clinton and Yeltsin emphasized cooperation and camaraderie during the separate ceremony marking the final approval of the START I treaty . The pact was signed_in 1991 by former President George_Bush and former Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev just before the Soviet_Union disintegrated . The effective date of the treaty was held_up by the Ukrainian Parliament , which only last month agreed to renounce nuclear_weapons and join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . Under a plan worked_out in May , 1992 , Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus -- the three non-Russian republics that held Soviet nuclear weaponry -- agreed to go non-nuclear , leaving Russia with all_of the arms the treaty allowed the Soviet_Union to keep . Kazakhstan and Belarus had ratified the agreement earlier . The final approval of START I clears the way for ratification by the U.S. Senate and the Russian Parliament of START II , signed_in 1993 , which requires the United States and Russia to reduce total nuclear_warheads to no more_than 3 # 500 , less than one-third of the Cold_War level . Clinton and Yeltsin also agreed to begin negotiations for additional reductions once START II is ratified . &quot; Today we herald the arrival of a new and safer era , &quot; Clinton said . He said the steps &quot; amount to one great stride to reduce the nuclear threat to ourselves and to our children. &quot; But U.S. officials said the ceremony had &quot; hung_in the balance &quot; until the early hours of Monday morning , when Russia and Ukraine finally worked_out a dispute over a provision attached_to the treaty by the Ukrainian Parliament . Clinton spent only about six hours in Budapest before flying home to play host Monday night to a reception for members of the outgoing Democratic Congress . Before heading to the airport , the President met briefly with Bosnia ' s Izetbegovic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman . He also conferred_with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . But U.S. officials said he had no time for a separate meeting with Yeltsin , although the two men chatted during the nuclear arms signing ceremony . Bosnian officials said Clinton assured Izetbegovic that he would continue to apply pressure on the Bosnian Serbs through NATO . In his speech , Clinton urged the international community not to allow its &quot; frustration over that war to cause us to give_up our efforts to end it , &quot; and he again called_on the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace plan and agree to a cease-fire . &quot; Settle your differences at the negotiating table , not the battlefield , &quot; Clinton said . In his public remarks , Izetbegovic issued a stinging rebuke of international efforts to resolve the Bosnian war , saying the conflict is being prolonged because of the incapability , hesitation and ill_will of the West . The Bosnian president , who spoke while Clinton and Yeltsin were out of the room for the signing ceremony , said the war had &quot; discredited &quot; the United Nations , &quot; ruined &quot; NATO and &quot; demoralized &quot; Europeans trying to respond to the Continent ' s first post-Cold War crisis . &quot; There is more_than a touch of irony in the fact that in front of this high forum of an organization created 20 years ago , with the aim of security and cooperation , . . . I have to speak about something completely opposite : insecurity and non-cooperation , &quot; he said . In his speech to the CSCE session , Clinton called_for a greater role for the security organization but also described NATO as &quot; the bedrock of security in Europe. &quot; He said the alliance ' s decision to expand , perhaps as early as 1996 , will enhance security for all_of Europe , members and non-members alike . In an embarrassing slip_of_the_tongue , Clinton described NATO as &quot; an offensive organization. &quot; Officials later told reporters that he meant &quot; defensive. &quot; But Yeltsin was not convinced . &quot; Russia also expects its security to be taken_into_account , &quot; Yeltsin said . &quot; We are concerned about the changes that are taking_place in NATO . What is this going_to mean for Russia ? NATO was created during the Cold_War . Why sow the seeds of mistrust ? After all , we are no longer enemies ; we are all partners now. &quot; As he left the gathering , Yeltsin got a quick lesson in the changed world order . The Russian president , without an overcoat in the afternoon cold , paraded through a throng of reporters and cameramen toward a waiting caravan of official vehicles . Yeltsin moved deliberately toward a shiny new Mercedes , only to discover the car was in fact designated for the Ukrainian delegation . Yeltsin stepped back on the red_carpet and put_on his overcoat . Several vehicles picking_up the Albanian delegation also passed_by before Yeltsin ' s caravan arrived .</TEXT>
