   <HEADLINE> HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE CLEARS THE NAVY OF CLASSIFYING MURDERS AS SUICIDES ; MILITARY : BUT PANEL CRITICIZES NIS FOR FAILING TO FOLLOW STANDARD PROCEDURE AND FOR POOR RELATIONS WITH VICTIMS ' FAMILIES , WHO DISPUTE REPORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Navy sailor aboard the Virginia was found strangled at his post , a telephone_cord wrapped twice around his neck . His wallet and diary were missing . The Naval Investigative Service ruled the death of Machinist Mate Kenneth Louthain a suicide , citing testimony that he had exhibited &quot; self-destructive behavior. &quot; A House subcommittee , in a report released in mid-March , supported that conclusion , but said that in this and seven other military deaths , the Navy sometimes failed to follow standard law_enforcement procedure and withheld information from families . But the House Armed Services Oversight and Investigations subcommittee rejected a more damning charge : that the Navy prefers to avoid controversy by calling murders suicide . The subcommittee found &quot; errors &quot; and &quot; unprofessional actions in individual cases , &quot; but said the Navy &quot; does not have a policy , campaign , conspiracy or predisposition to present homicides as suicides. &quot; The probe stemmed from complaints by family members who refused to believe official reports that their loved ones committed suicide . The subcommittee focused_on eight cases handled by the Naval Investigative Service because most of the complaints concerned Navy or Marine Corps cases . The conclusion drew an immediate and angry reaction from the family group , &quot; Til We Have Answers , &quot; that formed around the disputed cases . &quot; This is lip_service . I read it twice and I just could not believe it , &quot; said Cathy Jakovic , co-founder of the group . Her son , Scott , was shot and killed in 1991 in what officials said was a game of Russian roulette at a Naval Weapons Station in Earle , N.J. Jakovic said a fellow Marine guard shot her son . &quot; It ' s a lot easier to deal with a suicide than a murder , &quot; Jakovic said . Although the families criticized the subcommittee report , the finding did confirm their allegations that the Navy sometimes gave conflicting or incomplete reports , failed to return some personal effects , did not follow standard law_enforcement procedures such_as dusting for fingerprints , and treated family members callously . In a joint statement , Reps . Norman Sisisky ( D-Va. ) , the subcommittee chairman , and James Hansen of Utah , its senior Republican member , said that although the investigations weren ' t bungled , the dealings with family members were . &quot; The families have emerged from these cases scarred . Many of them feel they were lied to , &quot; Sisisky and Hansen said . &quot; We find they were sometimes patronized and treated as if they were ignorant. &quot; In seven of the eight cases , the subcommittee found no reason to question the conclusions reached by NIS investigators . The panel said it was &quot; troubled &quot; by an investigation into the February , 1992 , death of Marine Lt . Kirk Vanderbur . Vanderbur was found at a rifle_range in Hubert , N.C. , near Camp Lejeune , dead of a gunshot wound to the head . He was found holding a rifle with his thumb but also had a shotgun wound in the chest . The shotgun was found eight to 10 feet away . Local police concluded that the death was a suicide . The NIS had a &quot; limited role &quot; in the probe , according to the subcommittee , and reached no conclusion . The subcommittee said the local police finding &quot; does not sit well. &quot; In other cases , the subcommittee criticized Norfolk base police for letting witnesses leave the scene of a shooting without getting their names and phone_numbers . In another case , NIS investigators failed to take fingerprints from a gun linked to what was later termed a suicide and never checked the hands of the victim for powder burns . And the subcommittee criticized the Marines in a third case for giving a family three different stories about how Lance Cpl . Cornelius Whittles had died in a 1989 shooting , also at the Earle , N.J. , naval station . In one version , Whittles was playing Russian roulette . In another , he was cleaning his gun . In a third version , he was playing with his gun . The NIS ruled the case an accidental suicide . The Navy Cases Summaries of eight cases investigated by the House Armed Services Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee : * 2nd Lt . Kirk Vanderbur , Feb . 17 , 1992 , Hubert , N.C. Vanderbur was shot once in the head and found holding a rifle . He also had a shotgun wound to the chest . The shotgun was found eight to 10 feet away . Local police said Vanderbur failed with the shotgun , possibly by accident , then crawled to the rifle and shot himself . The Naval Investigative Service reached no conclusion . The family disputes the suicide ruling . * Seaman Mark Dasalla , Dec . 11 , 1985 , Norfolk , Va. , Naval Station . Dasalla grabbed a Marine guard ' s pistol in a scuffle and turned_on a second guard . The Marine shot Dasalla when he refused to stop . Dasalla ' s father , Mark , accused the Navy of &quot; trying to paint my son in a bad light. &quot; The subcommittee said the investigation was sound but criticized base police for failing to get names of eyewitnesses . * Marine Pfc . James Gardner , Oct . 1 , 1991 , Naval Submarine Base , Bangor , Wash . Gardner was found dead on the floor of a locked bathroom , a gunshot wound to the head . The handgun was found with the safety in the &quot; on &quot; position . Gardner ' s mother , Arlene Ball , said she is willing to accept the suicide ruling but called NIS &quot; arrogant and stupid. &quot; The subcommittee faulted the NIS for failing to take fingerprints or check Gardner ' s hands for powder marks . * Machinist Mate Kenneth Louthain , Oct . 3 , 1992 , aboard the USS Virginia . Louthain was found dead at his duty station with a telephone_cord wrapped around his neck . The body showed no signs of trauma or struggle . NIS ruled the death a suicide , citing testimony that Louthain had exhibited &quot; self-destructive behavior. &quot; The family says Louthain was murdered and accuses the Navy of a coverup . The subcommittee supported the suicide conclusion but criticized the Navy for first telling the Louthains that Louthain was found in the water off Jamaica , later that he was found dead at his duty station , and finally that he was strangled . * Marine Lance Cpl . Scott Jakovic , Oct . 12 , 1991 , Naval Weapons Station , Earle , N.J. Jakovic apparently shot himself playing Russian roulette . A fellow Marine who , according to one account , encouraged Jakovic to &quot; do_it , &quot; was court-martialed for involuntary manslaughter . The Navy listed the death as an accident . The subcommittee found the investigation &quot; thorough and competent. &quot; * Marine Cpl . John MacCaskill , May 25 , 1988 , U.S. Embassy , El_Salvador . A State_Department investigation ruled that MacCaskill shot himself in the mouth at a San Salvador bar , noting that MacCaskill was drunk and that witnesses reported him despondent . The family wants to question three other Marines who were there . The subcommittee agreed with the suicide finding but criticized the State_Department for providing inaccurate information to the family about what happened . * Marine security officer Michael Leslie , Sept . 19 , 1991 , Naval Station , Guam . Two local officials heard a gunshot and found Leslie dead with his left wrist handcuffed to the steering_wheel and a gun in his right_hand . The family suspects murder and wants the case reopened . The subcommittee said the case was_well handled . * Marine Cpl . Cornelius Whittles , April 15 , 1989 , Naval Weapons Station , Earle , N.J. NIS found that Whittles had been playing with his handgun , including pointing it at his head , when the weapon fired . The subcommittee agreed with the finding but termed the case &quot; a classic example of how not to handle the casualty notification process. &quot; The family was given three different versions of the death : that Whittles was playing Russian roulette , cleaning his gun , or simply playing with the gun .
