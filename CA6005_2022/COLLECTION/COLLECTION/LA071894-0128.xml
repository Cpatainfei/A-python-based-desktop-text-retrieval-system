   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FINAL ; ANALYSIS ; UNFAIR RULE PUTS AN END TO FAIR FINAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now Brazil has the 1994 World Cup championship -- and on penalty kicks , 3-2 . You can make a plausible case that either team could have won . It was not the &quot; dream game &quot; some people had hoped for from these mighty soccer powers . Each team played the game it knows best . Italy played a brilliant defensive game . Its offense was obviously hampered by the hamstring injury of Roberto Baggio , who did not seem up_to par . Its goalkeeper , Gianluca Pagliuca , made some improbable saves and kept his team from defeat in regular time . Brazil played its visually strong attacking game . It had more chances to score . But it had trouble finishing its attacks , as it had trouble before . The patent unfairness of the penalty-kick resolution of the game after a scoreless tie_in regular time and overtime was there for all to see . It was heartbreaking to see the Italians sitting there , crushed , on the field . But then , it would have been heartbreaking to see the Brazilians in the same position . A European friend called the other day to say that July had been a great month for America . As it turned_out , he was not referring to the economy or to foreign_policy but to the World Cup . He loved the filled stadiums , he said , but above all , the enthusiasm , the good_nature and the joyfulness of it all . And he was right . The World Cup celebrated fierce , but non-confrontational , nationalism . The spectators , while passionate , were friendly . The teams , while physical , were fair . And the new FIFA rules discouraged violence . Though Kissinger had the title of honorary chairman , his duties essentially ended when the World Cup was awarded to America . He can , therefore , pay tribute to the American organizing committee , which found the stadiums , adapted them to soccer and arranged the hospitality -- all_of it in a country that has no local teams to provide the administrative support . The organization was thoroughly efficient . Kissinger attended five previous World Cups ; he has never seen the performance of this year ' s host country surpassed . Above all , the soccer was much better -- more offensive , livelier , more imaginative -- than that of World Cup ' 90 in Italy , where defensiveness and rough play smothered too many games . The two best teams got_to the final . The Netherlands team was about as good but , through the accident of the draw , had to face Brazil in the round of 16 . Argentina began the tournament playing a powerful combination of Latin_American flair and European decisiveness . But after the forced departure of Diego Maradona , it lost to Bulgaria in a game that did not matter , and in the round of 16 to Romania in a game that was one of the highlights of the World Cup . Had Argentina made that hurdle , it could have gone_to the final . Sweden ' s journey to the third-place game_showed the importance of grit but offered few new vistas . Bulgaria ' s challenge , like that of Romania , might foretell a stronger role by Eastern European_countries . The fall of the Iron_Curtain opened Western Europe to Eastern players and freed them from the stereotyped game of the centrally planned societies . You can expect to see more African and Asian soccer in the World Cup in France in ' 98 and beyond as the sport grows in popularity . Nigeria , with a little more experience and tactical skill , might have made the semifinals . Its players were among the most skilled of the tournament but lacked tactical experience and patience . The most ambiguous future is Germany ' s -- since 1974 a two-time champion and four-time finalist . The problem is not , as_many critics claim , that the team is too old but that no replacements seem available . The German coach , Berti Vogts , was right in saying that , though nine of his players had played_on the team that won the World Cup in 1990 , they happened to be the best players available . But this means that almost the entire team has to be rebuilt . What of the game itself ? Could more rules changes encourage more attacking soccer ? One suggestion has been to limit the number of defenders in the penalty area during corner_kicks . Corner_kicks figure also in suggestions for eliminating the use of penalty kicks as tiebreakers . Penalty-kick tiebreakers in the round of 16 and after can be heart-stopping , as Sweden ' s defeat of Romania demonstrated . But who can be left who thinks they are a measure of quality ? Because corner_kicks indicate the attacking team has been playing in the defenders ' area , you could break a tie by awarding it to the team with the most corner_kicks . Another suggestion has been to break a tie by alternating corner_kicks until a team scores . Since 1986 , FIFA rules prescribe penalty kicks as the tiebreaker for the final too . Until 1986 a tied final was always to be played again . ( It never had to be. ) Returning to the pre-1986 system would at least prevent the sport ' s most important game from being decided by accident . The third-place game , in which this year Sweden easily beat an exhausted Bulgaria , 4-0 , has no meaning and offers no particular incentive to those who play it . Four years from now there will be 32 instead of 24 teams in the first round . Currently , the previous champion and host gain automatic places in the round of 24 . Why not give automatic entry to the round of 32 to the top three winners of the previous tournament ? That would make the third-place game an important one . And what of America and soccer ? The stirring performance of the American team did much to popularize the game . But without a league playing regularly it will not prosper . The plan is for a league of 12 teams to get under way in April . The season would run_through July . The players probably would have to be a mix of Americans and foreigners . The soccer writer Paul Johnson recommends in his book &quot; The Simplest Game &quot; that the Americans look_for style and technique , not to Europe but to Brazil . The more exciting kind of Brazilian soccer , he says , would have a wider appeal , and a distinctive American style might eventually emerge . It might look something like Argentina ' s , he suggests -- a combination of fluidity and discipline . The main point , he argues , is to shift emphasis from speed and size to ball control and player initiative . He suggests that such a style would have a great appeal_to the rapidly growing number of fans who don ' t have to be taught to love the game .</TEXT>
