   <HEADLINE> NO DEADLINE SET ON DNA TEST RESULTS IN SIMPSON CASE ; COURTS : ITO FINDS NO EVIDENCE THAT DELAYS WERE INTENTIONAL . HE ALSO SUSPENDS JURY SELECTION TO ASSESS POTENTIAL IMPACT OF NEW BOOK ABOUT NICOLE SIMPSON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito stunned O.J. Simpson ' s defense_team Tuesday by declining to set a deadline for the completion of DNA tests , then temporarily halted jury selection because he is concerned about the impact a splashy new book could have_on the case . Although Ito has generally favored prosecutors in the face of repeated defense attempts to suppress evidence and invalidate searches , his ruling on the proposed deadline took many by surprise . In two separate court sessions last week , the judge had expressed his displeasure with the pace of prosecution testing and with its arguments justifying delays . He had strongly indicated that he would impose some sanction , raising defense hopes that he might rule_in that side ' s favor this time . Instead , he found that although there were delays , there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of prosecutors . That clears the way for DNA testing of almost two_dozen items -- including a bloody glove found outside Simpson ' s home -- to continue without the threat of a deadline from the judge . &quot; The defense is sort of stunned and disappointed by the ruling , &quot; Simpson attorney Johnnie L . Cochran Jr . said outside court . &quot; We expected , based upon the judge ' s statements last week , perhaps a far different ruling . . . . We can ' t explain the ruling. &quot; Ito had barely resolved that issue before he waded into another . Reacting to a newly released book purporting to detail the last months of Nicole Brown Simpson ' s life , the judge ordered a temporary halt to jury selection , sending members of the jury panel home until Thursday . O.J. Simpson has pleaded not_guilty to killing his ex-wife and Ronald Lyle Goldman , whose slashed and stabbed bodies were found June 13 . The book , co-authored by a friend of Nicole Simpson ' s and a National Enquirer columnist , was released this week . Ito received a copy Tuesday morning and said its publication has raised new concerns about Simpson ' s ability to get a fair trial . Exactly what Ito can do about the book is unclear . But when he spoke_to prospective jurors Tuesday afternoon , the judge used his strongest language yet to suggest that he might order the jury sequestered . &quot; Those of you who serve on the case may be de_facto incommunicado for a significant period_of_time , &quot; Ito told prospective jurors during a solemn session . In the meantime , Ito changed his admonition to the panel . Where previously he had asked the prospective jurors to avoid coverage of the case , he modified that order to insist that they avoid all television and radio_broadcasts as well as all newspapers and magazines . At that point , Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark requested a word with Ito . After a brief discussion with Clark and defense_lawyers , Ito turned again to the potential jurors and added : &quot; I neglected to tell you : You are to stay out of bookstores. &quot; The release of the book -- a salacious and in many ways unverifiable account titled &quot; Nicole Brown Simpson : The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted &quot; -- was the latest disruption in a jury selection process that has moved haltingly since questioning began last week . The questioning has moved far more slowly than Ito had anticipated and has been stopped twice , once because a prosecutor fell ill and again Tuesday because of Ito ' s concerns about the book . Although some analysts suggested that Ito had overreacted to the book , others said the judge had acted prudently in the face of a complicated problem . &quot; What he ' s saying is , ' Let ' s take the most protective measure we can without going_to sequestration yet , ' &quot; said Laurie Levenson , a Loyola law_school professor . &quot; I would say he has his hands full here. &quot; Even as jury selection has progressed , Ito and the attorneys for both sides have grappled with a host of other issues , the most significant of which was a potential deadline on the completion of DNA tests . Nearly two_dozen blood samples from Simpson ' s home and car were at risk after defense_attorneys charged that prosecutors had delayed tests to gain a tactical advantage . Despite Ito ' s efforts to elicit an explanation from prosecutors , Deputy Dist . Atty . Lisa Kahn struggled last week to offer a rationale for why certain tests were not begun until three months after blood samples were first recovered . During two hearings last week , Ito appeared displeased . At one point , he warned prosecutors that they were about to lose the argument . That heartened defense_attorneys , who believed the judge was about to rule_in their favor . In a three-page ruling , however , Ito reiterated his observation that there were delays in testing but said the defense had failed to produce evidence that the delays were intentional . That came as a great relief to prosecutors , who could have lost significant evidence if Ito had set an early deadline for test results . &quot; We ' re pleased that the judge understood that the people are proceeding in good_faith in an expeditious , ethical and scientifically prudent manner while responding to repeated defense motions regarding evidence , &quot; Suzanne Childs , a spokeswoman for the district_attorney ' s office , said Tuesday . Led by Barry C . Scheck , a Simpson lawyer who specializes in DNA issues , the defense had argued that Ito could infer bad faith from the delays . But the defense_team did not offer direct_evidence of misconduct -- letters or testimony , for instance , showing that prosecutors had deliberately stalled rather than pressing ahead with testing . &quot; The mere fact that the prosecution waited until the second week in September does not , standing alone , establish bad faith in the context of the unique facts and circumstances of this case , &quot; Ito ruled . &quot; Both sides are now hurtling towards the evidence presentation phase of this litigation without a clear and precise view_as to what the scientific testing of the physical evidence will reveal , and both sides are in this position as a matter of choice. &quot; Legal experts were generally unsurprised by Ito ' s decision , noting that the judge could not impose the sanctions sought by the defense unless he found specific bad faith on the part of prosecutors . &quot; Apparently he didn ' t find that , and as frustrated as he was about the delays , he could not impose a cutoff unless he found evidence of deliberate bad faith , &quot; said Gerald Chaleff , a prominent Los Angeles defense_attorney . &quot; Absent a showing of bad faith , there really is no sanction. &quot; UCLA law professor Peter Arenella agreed . Without direct_evidence of misconduct by prosecutors , the defense was left to argue that Ito should base his ruling simply on an inference , he said . And that fell_short , Arenella added , because the delays arguably were as inconvenient to prosecutors as they were to defense_attorneys because they mean that both sides are forced to prepare without a full set of scientific results . Although the ruling was the day ' s most important substantive development , the uproar surrounding the release of the book delayed the proceedings and caused Simpson ' s lawyers to publicly state that they believed their client ' s right to a fair trial was in jeopardy . &quot; The proceedings today have left a very dark cloud_over our system of justice , &quot; said Robert L . Shapiro , one of Simpson ' s lead attorneys . &quot; I have been concerned for a very long_time about whether O.J. Simpson would have a very difficult time getting a fair trial based on all_the media attention . Events of today have convinced me O.J. Simpson cannot get a fair trial , and it concerns us greatly because so_much effort has been put into this by both sides. &quot; The book -- co-written by National Enquirer columnist Mike Walker and Faye D . Resnick , a friend of Nicole Simpson ' s -- hit bookstores this week amid great fanfare . Ito directed his clerk to secure a copy so that he could review it and determine whether any adjustments needed to be made to jury selection as a result of its publication . After reviewing the book Tuesday morning , Ito addressed prospective jurors after the lunch break . Although he did not name the book , Ito told members of the panel that it &quot; has caused the court deep concern about Mr. Simpson ' s ability to get a fair trial. &quot; Resnick ' s book is replete with allegations against O.J. Simpson , many of them based on what she said were private conversations with his ex-wife . Resnick repeatedly states that she believes O.J. Simpson is responsible_for the June 12 murders . At one point , Resnick writes that Nicole Simpson told her , &quot; O.J. loves me so_much he ' s going_to kill me . . . and get_away with it. &quot; Resnick also said that the former football star told her in April , while Nicole Simpson was trying to distance herself from her ex-husband : &quot; If she ' s with another man , I ' ll kill her . You tell her she ' d better play her role and look_like my wife. &quot; Despite those and other inflammatory passages , Resnick ' s co-author , Walker , acknowledged at a news_conference hawking the book that it contains no &quot; smoking gun &quot; information about the murders . &quot; Does_it influence the trial ? &quot; Walker asked_in response to a question . &quot; I can ' t imagine with the billions of words that have been spoken about this case it can have an undue influence. &quot; The book contains a description of an alleged June 12 , 1994 , argument between O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife that , if true , would appear to contradict a statement he gave to police . In that statement , Simpson said he had not spoken with his ex-wife at their daughter ' s ballet recital , which took_place hours before the murders . Resnick , who acknowledges she was in drug rehabilitation at the time of the murders , writes that Nicole Simpson called her that evening and told her of an argument at the recital . That account , however , is contradicted by comments made by members of Nicole Simpson ' s family . They have said Simpson would not speak_to his ex-wife at the event . In the book , Resnick says she met with prosecutor Clark shortly after the killings and that Clark asked her to make a statement . Regarding the_matter , Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti said , &quot; I am confident that the defendant and the people can and will have a fair trial. &quot; At the news_conference Tuesday , Walker said his co-author has not been asked to testify but has been asked to sign a sworn statement , which she has not yet done . Resnick has been out of public view for months but plans to emerge with a flourish this week . She has scheduled several television appearances , and Geraldo Rivera read aloud from her book on his show Tuesday . According to a news release , the publishers already have contracts to sell 750 # 000 copies of the $ 14.95 book to bookstores . A local company has released a two-cassette abridged version of the book , read aloud by Resnick , which is selling for $ 16.95. The B . Dalton Bookseller store in Downtown Los Angeles reported brisk sales Tuesday , with more_than half its inventory being sold by early afternoon . One of the early copies went_to one of Ito ' s law clerks , and the scores of journalists covering the trial scooped_up more during the lunch hour . Walker said at the news_conference that part of the proceeds from the book would go_to a fund to finance the college educations of O.J. and Nicole Simpson ' s children , Sydney , who turned 9 Monday , and Justin , who is 6 . He declined to say what percentage of the proceeds it would be . But Denise Brown , Nicole Brown ' s older sister , said the book ' s publishers had not approached her or , to her knowledge , other members of her family about establishing a trust_fund for the children . &quot; That is a lie , &quot; she said , while declining to comment on the substance of the book . &quot; We don ' t know anything about that . I don ' t have a clue about that and don ' t know what the fund entails. &quot; Juditha Brown , Nicole ' s mother , said the family had purchased a copy of the book and was planning to look through it Tuesday night . Without having read it , she was reluctant to comment on the book ' s contents . She said she has been angered by some of the accounts she has heard but would not elaborate . She also said she does not know how close her daughter was to Resnick . &quot; I know they were friends at the end , but maybe only for a year or six months , &quot; she said .
