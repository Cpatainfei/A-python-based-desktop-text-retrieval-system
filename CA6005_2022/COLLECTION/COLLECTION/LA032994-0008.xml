   <HEADLINE> ALLY WATCH ; TURKEY ' S IRON LADY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Turkey has been an important -- and friendly -- ally of the West . During the Gulf War its NATO air_base proved to be an invaluable asset.Precisely because of Turkey ' s vital role in the region , its roiling internal politics are always watched closely . Thus did this weekend ' s local elections attract world attention . About a year ago Tansu Ciller , a scrappy politician who claims Margaret Thatcher as her role_model , became prime_minister in a series of events triggered by the death of President Turgut Ozal , an enormously popular politician who was held_in affectionate regard in many Western capitals . Since taking_over , the American-educated Ciller has not had an easy time . But on Sunday , to virtually everyone ' s surprise , Ciller ' s True Path Party did very well , providing a psychological boost for her government -- basically a parliamentary coalition with the Social Democratic People ' s Party . And that unexpectedly strong showing bodes well for the conservative leader ' s prospects in the 1996 parliamentary elections . Despite the weekend ' s success , Prime_Minister Ciller must_not only overcome serious economic and political corruption problems but also the challenge of dealing with the Kurds -- a stateless minority with large populations in Iraq and Iran as well as Turkey . Ciller favors a severe crackdown on terrorist Kurds . But she must avoid a wholesale , indiscriminate repression of the Kurdish people that is in itself destabilizing -- and creates serious problems for Turkey ' s allies . The path between now and 1996 may be true , but it is also tricky .</TEXT>
