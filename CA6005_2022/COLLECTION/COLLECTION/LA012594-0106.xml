   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; POLITICAL CONCERNS DRIVE TOKYO ' S MARKET DOWN 954 POINTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japanese stock prices , which on Monday took their biggest plunge in more_than two years , are expected to continue their volatility in the coming days as long as political turmoil threatens to delay economic stimulus . The Nikkei index fell 954 points , or 4.9 % , to close at 18 # 353 Monday . This was the steepest fall since Aug . 19 , 1991 , when a 1 # 358-point drop was touched_off by the attempted coup in Russia . In morning trading today , prices rebounded modestly on the strength of foreign investors ' and brokerage_account dealers ' purchases , and the index rose 99 points to 18 # 452 . Monday ' s selloff came_in reaction to the parliamentary defeat Friday of a political reform package that Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had made the centerpiece of his coalition government ' s legislative efforts . The setback not only guaranteed further delay of any economic stimulus program , it also threatened the unity of the seven-party ruling coalition . Investors betting_on imminent passage of the political reform program , which would have cleared the way for Hosokawa to concentrate_on the economy , bid up the market last week . Thus , to a large degree , Monday ' s plunge was a reaction to this disappointment , as investors liquidated those positions . &quot; We ' re seeing a natural rebound , since the fall yesterday was a little overdone , &quot; Daniel Marull , a trader at Bridge Trading Co. , said during morning trading today . &quot; But the political scene is still unclear and people are still worried. &quot; New political factors , rather than economic fundamentals , are likely to drive the market until the future of the Hosokawa Cabinet and its policy options become more clear . There is still a small possibility , for example , that Hosokawa might reach a compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to achieve passage of a revised political reform package later this week . Investors would almost surely treat that as good news . &quot; The volatility is going_to be extremely high , and the reason for that is the political situation is filled with opinions but is unpredictable , &quot; said Jesper Koll , an analyst with S.G. Warburg Securities . &quot; This week really could spike down to 17 # 500 ( on the Nikkei ) and could easily spike back_up to 19 # 500 , &quot; he said . &quot; If politicians find the magic_bullet . . . on political reform , that means a green_light for economic stimulus , and that means the market is going_to go_through the roof. &quot; Downward pressure on the market comes from fears that the political deadlock will become so severe that Hosokawa will call_for elections . That would not only bring uncertainties of an exceptionally fluid political situation , but could delay any serious economic program for months . Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Monday that the government will try to work simultaneously on political reform and economic stimulus , tax reform and the fiscal 1994 budget , which takes_effect April 1 . &quot; No firm schedule has been established , &quot; Takemura but the government still aims to reach decisions in all these areas before Hosokawa ' s Feb . 11 Washington summit with President Clinton , Takemura said . Bank_of_Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Monday that Japan ' s economic_conditions remain in the_doldrums and that recovery is likely to take more time . Analysts at Salomon Bros . Asia Ltd . predicted that the Bank_of_Japan may respond to the political disarray , and the resulting delay in implementation of an overall economic stimulus package , by cutting interest_rates more quickly and deeply than has been expected . The key question for the market now is whether the ruling coalition can muddle through , survive in office and enact a stimulus program , or whether Hosokawa will give_up on that approach and call elections . &quot; If there is no election . . . the market will be stabilized , and even from now I think there would be some recovery , &quot; said UBS Securities analyst Shigeru Akiba , &quot; but if there is an election in the next few weeks , the market will go_down more. &quot;</TEXT>
