   <HEADLINE> DEBATE INTENSE ON SIMPSON EVIDENCE ; CRUCIAL RULING DUE ; COURT : THE DEFENSE ARGUES THAT ENTRY ONTO THE ESTATE WAS ILLEGAL . PROSECUTOR SAYS THE POLICE WOULD HAVE BEEN PILLORIED IF THEY HAD FAILED TO ACT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prosecutors and lawyers for O.J. Simpson squared_off Wednesday in a dramatic , high-stakes legal battle over evidence seized from the celebrity ' s home , with one side defending the actions of the police and the other accusing them of illegally entering Simpson ' s estate . Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell said she would rule on the_matter this morning . Her ruling is likely to play a crucial role in how the case unfolds , as a number of important pieces of evidence hang_in the balance . Among the witnesses who testified Wednesday was Simpson ' s 25-year-old daughter , Arnelle Simpson , who smiled and winked_at her father after she left the stand and passed the table where he was sitting . In her testimony , she said she was sleeping at her father ' s estate in Brentwood when police jumped over a fence before dawn on June 13 -- providing the grist for the spirited constitutional debate on the legality of the officers ' subsequent search . Defense_attorney Gerald F . Uelmen argued that when police_officers jumped the fence , they violated Simpson ' s constitutional right to be secure in his home . Uelmen alleged that police then manufactured an excuse for that entry by pretending that they believed that more victims might be inside . Uelmen , a former law_school dean and ex-federal prosecutor , belittled the primary piece of evidence that officers cited to justify their decision to jump the wall and enter Simpson ' s estate -- a small bloodstain found on the door of a Ford Bronco parked on the street . That stain , which Uelmen called a &quot; speck , &quot; was &quot; just as consistent with a dripping taco or a driver with a hangnail as with any circumstances of murder , suicide or bleeding victims on the premises , &quot; he said . Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark countered by saying that the officers had just arrived from the scene where the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman had been discovered lying_in pools of_their_own blood . With that scene fresh in their minds , she argued , the officers would have been negligent had they not entered a home when they had reason to believe that there could be other victims either dead or injured -- a fear that they said they developed after seeing the blood on the car and several other suspicious signs outside the house . Had the officers failed to act , she said , they would have been rightly pilloried . &quot; We would have said they were derelict , &quot; said Clark , pacing in front of the lectern in a courtroom where the nation ' s attention has been focused for the past week . &quot; We would have said they were incompetent . . . . Instead , they did fulfill their duties. &quot; The intensity of Wednesday ' s arguments reflected the magnitude of the stakes in the debate over how police came_upon evidence at the Simpson estate , using it to help obtain a search_warrant a_few hours later . Among the disputed pieces of evidence are a bloodstained glove , bloodstains on Simpson ' s driveway and more bloodstains found on the athlete ' s Ford Bronco , parked outside . Prosecutors have indicated that they hope to introduce that evidence during the preliminary hearing . Other evidence seized at the home includes stains found in Simpson ' s upstairs bedroom and bathroom . Although those items were not debated Wednesday , they too could be lost to prosecutors if Judge Kennedy-Powell finds that the initial entry into Simpson ' s home violated the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , which protects the rights of all citizens to be safe and secure in their homes and prevents unlawful searches by police_officers . In his closing statement on the search issue , Uelmen stressed the importance of the 4th Amendment as a brake on police conduct , and , in an unusual acknowledgment of the intense public interest in the Simpson case , he urged the judge not to be swayed by people outside the courtroom . &quot; I know and Your Honor knows that the pundits and the cynics who are following this case suggest that this case is too high profile a case for a motion to suppress to be granted , &quot; Uelmen said . &quot; We do not share that cynicism . I think it ' s important for us to bear_in_mind that what is at_issue here is the application of an exclusionary_rule whose purpose is to teach . What better vehicle do we have to teach the lesson that the 4th Amendment is alive and well in Los Angeles. &quot; Where Uelmen ' s argument was rich_in history and in the vitality of the 4th Amendment , Clark ' s was deeply rooted in the practicalities of police work . Clark , who never refers in court to Simpson by name but only as &quot; the defendant , &quot; argued that detectives were faced with difficult choices and had to act quickly to preserve human life . Their primary motivation when they jumped the wall , she said , was not to gather evidence but to protect residents of Simpson ' s home from the grisly fate that had befallen Nicole Simpson and Goldman just two miles away . Although officers did spot evidence after entering the grounds , all that evidence was in_sight and thus legally admissible , she argued . Clark commended the eloquence and passion of Uelmen ' s presentation , but she accused him of overstating the officers ' actions when they entered Simpson ' s property . &quot; He attempts to depict in very graphic terms the search or the activities that were conducted at the location of 360 Rockingham as though a Sherman tank were being driven through the back yard and being plowed in through the doors , &quot; Clark said . &quot; In fact , nothing could be further from the truth. &quot; Legal experts watching the hearing praised the lawyers for both sides and agreed that the stakes are enormously high . Loyola Law_School professor and former federal prosecutor Samuel H . Pillsbury said he expects an appeal from whichever side loses . &quot; It ' s almost the kind of question you use for a law_school exam because there is a good_deal to argue on both sides , &quot; he said . Leo Terrell , a longtime civil_rights lawyer who often files suppression motions related to alleged police misconduct , described the two arguments as &quot; the professor versus the litigator. &quot; &quot; The professor cited constitutional case_law , &quot; Terrell said . &quot; I thought that Clark may have been the more aggressive in her presentation , but the substance of Uelmen ' s comments were more persuasive . A judge is not going_to be swayed by flair or dramatics. &quot; Nevertheless , Terrell believed that the prosecution would win the right to introduce the disputed evidence because of current legal trends . Attorney Harland W . Braun , who defended one of the officers accused of beating Rodney G . King , praised Uelmen ' s presentation but also predicted that prosecutors will prevail . &quot; The officers did basically what we would expect , &quot; he said . &quot; If they come_to my house and find blood on the door , I ' d want them to knock_down the door . . . . It ' s really stretching it to say these guys acted illegally. &quot; Although motions to suppress evidence are rarely granted , Simpson ' s lawyers have waged an intense effort , and the issue dominated court sessions Tuesday and Wednesday . Fighting back , prosecutors filed a 25-page document opposing the motion and called two police_officers to the stand to explain their actions on the morning of June 13 . It was about 5 a.m. that day when detectives said they arrived_at Simpson ' s house to tell him of the slayings and to have him take_care of his two children , who were left motherless when Nicole Simpson was killed outside her condominium as they slept inside . Detective Mark Fuhrman from the LAPD ' s West Los Angeles Division was the first to testify on the issue of the search , repeatedly stressing that the officers were genuinely concerned about the safety of the home ' s occupants and the possibility that the killer could be in the area . Fuhrman , who found the glove , said the four detectives who let themselves onto Simpson ' s estate after failing to raise anyone inside were confronted with frightening uncertainties . At one point , Fuhrman said , he was forced to explore a long , dark walkway with a small flashlight and no bulletproof_vest . When he came_upon the glove , he said , &quot; my heart started pounding . I realized what I had found . . . . I was kind of taken_aback by the whole event . We didn ' t go_up there for this. &quot; Fuhrman ' s testimony was echoed by that of Detective Philip L . Vannatter , one of two lead investigators in the case . Vannatter , a craggy-faced homicide detective with more_than 200 cases under his belt , spent much of his time on the stand_in a testy faceoff with Robert L . Shapiro , the well-known lawyer who has represented numerous celebrities and heads Simpson ' s high-profile team of attorneys . Shapiro wasted no time attacking the detective , opening his questioning of Vannatter by immediately challenging the way in which the LAPD has handled its investigation . &quot; We will show that improper procedures were followed from the very beginning of this investigation , &quot; Shapiro said , &quot; that times , dates and records of events that should be recorded are not recorded . . . . And quite frankly , Your Honor , this will go_to the credibility of Detective Vannatter. &quot; From that point on , Shapiro questioned nearly every detail of the detective ' s account , focusing_on his decision to send a colleague over a wall and onto Simpson ' s property without a search_warrant -- a decision that Vannatter said he made after discovering what appeared to be blood on a car belonging_to Simpson and fearing that more victims might be inside the athlete ' s mansion . Vannatter , who works as a homicide specialist in the department ' s robbery-homicide division , initially was questioned by Clark , and he calmly explained his actions . Under questioning from her , the detective stressed over and over that investigators did not go_to Simpson ' s house in search of a suspect but rather because they wanted to notify him of his ex-wife ' s death and advise him that his children were at the police_station . Only after getting no answer from a gate intercom and seeing such things as what they believed was blood on Simpson ' s Ford Bronco did Vannatter say that he made a decision to go onto Simpson ' s estate without a warrant . &quot; I was concerned that something had occurred there , whether I had a second murder scene , whether I had someone injured , whether I had someone that was stalking Mr. Simpson and his wife , &quot; Vannatter said . &quot; Whatever , I had become concerned that someone could be hurt or injured in that location. &quot; But Shapiro attacked Vannatter ' s account , suggesting that investigators actually went_to Simpson ' s home because they believed he had committed the murders and that they only now are claiming to have had other motives to justify their decision to enter the property . Shapiro also accused Vannatter of lying when he drafted a search_warrant later used to conduct a search of the house and grounds . At times , both the veteran detective and the high-profile lawyer grew short-tempered , resorting_to sarcasm and sniping . When Vannatter said detectives were concerned that no one was coming_to the door in part because they had been told that Simpson had a live-in maid , Shapiro asked : &quot; Does a full-time , live-in maid to you mean seven days a week , 24 hours a day ? &quot; &quot; I don ' t know , sir , &quot; Vannatter responded . &quot; I ' ve never had a maid. &quot; Later Wednesday , however , Simpson ' s daughter cast doubt on Vannatter ' s insistence that police were concerned with the maid ' s safety . Speaking softly and glancing occasionally at her father , Arnelle Simpson said police had awakened her about 5:30 a.m. and had solicited her help in locating her father . Although she testified that officers asked about the maid , she said they seemed more preoccupied with locating her father . Although Wednesday was devoted to the issue of the police search , prosecutors also revealed a_few new nuggets in their case that are sure to figure in the days ahead , as the closely watched preliminary hearing continues and the judge weighs whether there is enough evidence to order Simpson to stand trial . Early Wednesday , prosecutors announced that they will seek to introduce during the preliminary hearing blood droplets from Simpson ' s driveway , a pair of bloodstained gloves , bloodstains on his car , and blood recovered from the scene of the crime . Those pieces of physical evidence in many ways form the backbone of the prosecution case , meshing with witness accounts of Simpson ' s whereabouts in an effort to show that he was at the scene of the slayings , which occurred June 12 . Vannatter disclosed that a string of blood spots leading away from the murder scene ran_along the left side of bloody footprints . That last , seemingly small , detail could prove important because Simpson ' s lawyer has said the athlete has at least two cuts on his left_hand -- as well as a number of scratches that Shapiro described as &quot; paper cuts. &quot; Armed with coroner ' s findings that suggest a fierce struggle at the scene , investigators believe that Simpson suffered most of those injuries in a battle with Goldman . Simpson ' s attorneys contend that at least one of the cuts was suffered in Chicago , when they say Simpson smashed a glass into a counter upon learning that his ex-wife had been murdered . * RELATED STORIES : A4 , A5 The Evidence at Stake Defense_attorneys for O.J.
