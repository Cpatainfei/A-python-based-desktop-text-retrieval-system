   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; COMMENTARY ; STOITCHKOV HAS HIS ACT TOGETHER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Soccer hero Hristo Stoitchkov of Bulgaria was destined to come_to Hollywood . For a man whose first_name translates to &quot; Christ &quot; in Bulgarian , it will be a match made in heaven . Stoitchkov , you see , is not only a world-class player and a driving force behind his team ' s stunning march into the semifinals of the World Cup . He is also prime star material , with a face that could play nicely on the silver_screen and an act that could do the same on the cocktail_party circuit . Stoitchkov will be arriving on the West Coast this week , after he and his band of Bulgarians settle the issue against Italy here Wednesday of who plays in the final Sunday and who is in the third-place game Saturday at the Rose Bowl . Whatever the outcome , Stoitchkov will be coming , and it ' s conceivable that the greeting party at LAX will include somebody from the William Morris Agency . If Stoitchkov played tennis , he would be Andre Agassi . Right now , his image may_not be everything , but it is heading toward matinee_idol . He is 28 years old , one of two star scorers for FC Barcelona of the Spanish League -- the other is Brazil ' s Romario -- and was runner-up in 1992 for European player of the year . Barcelona bought him four years ago for $ 4 million , and the price to acquire him now would be perhaps triple that . Even with all that going_for him , his role in Bulgaria ' s shocking success in the World Cup has elevated him to international sports superstar status . The Bulgarians seemed to be headed for a tidy 1-0 defeat at the hands of the powerful defending champion Germans here Sunday . As always , Germany played efficiently , if unspectacularly , and Bulgaria ' s runs_up and down the field seemed to be merely the chase of an unrealistic dream . But then Stoitchkov , awarded a direct free_kick just outside the penalty area when Andreas Moeller fouled him , cranked a left-footed shot over Germany ' s wall and inside the near post in the 76th minute . Three minutes later , before the shocked Germans had recovered , Bulgaria ' s Yordan Letchkov took a perfect pass and headed in another goal . Suddenly , the biggest upset of the tournament , and one of the biggest ever , had been achieved . And who was front and center_on the stage afterward ? Stoitchkov , of course . He met the press in baseball_cap and smile , dark eyes darting about , rugged unshaved look intact . He kidded about his quote after the Mexico game in which he had said that God was a Bulgarian , and he said that , even though the Germans were a very good team , that God still was a Bulgarian . And he said , sincerity oozing , that when things were going badly in the first_half and the Germans were dominating , he thought_about his daughter Mijaela ' s sixth birthday Sunday and remembered the good times with her and his family in Barcelona . In victory , Stoitchkov was gracious . When asked about the yellow card he received over a foul , he said , &quot; The referee was right . I tried to argue , but I realized that he is the referee and he has the right to make that decision. &quot; When asked about the game-long marking efforts of Germany ' s Juergen Kohler , he replied , &quot; I think Kohler is one of the best defenders in all_of football , and I would like to congratulate him because , in 90 minutes , he only made one small foul on me. &quot; But with Stoitchkov , the image being presented and reality aren ' t always quite the same . Banned for life by the Bulgarians at age 19 for his part in a brawl during the Bulgarian Cup_final , Stoitchkov was paroled quickly and has had a long history of confrontations with referees ever since . Two years ago , he stomped so hard on a referee ' s foot that it brought_on a two-month ban from the Spanish League . In Sunday ' s game , Kohler actually did such a solid job of guarding Stoitchkov one-on-one that Stoitchkov ' s only three chances at the goal were_on free_kicks . The statistics sheet showed Stoitchkov with no other chances , inside or outside the penalty area . Kohler ' s defense was so effective that Stoitchkov jawed and yelled at him frequently and spent much of the game crabbing openly at his teammates for not getting him the ball more . But when it was over , Stoitchkov led the team in hugs . When they somehow gathered_up the delirious Bulgarians for an on-field group celebration shot , Stoitchkov was second-row center , arms raised in celebration . Finally , the Bulgarians marched off , and Stoitchkov led again , arm in arm with the same teammates he had spent three hours berating . Hollywood will love this guy .</TEXT>
