   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN ETHNIC ; SHEILA LUKINS : THE SINGLE PALATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s October and Sheila Lukins is feeling harassed . Her first solo book is supposed to be published in April , and the galley_proofs have just come_back from the copy_editors with a_thousand questions still to be answered . What size tomato ? What kind of apple ? How much does that fennel bulb weigh ? Now she has to go_to a market , buy a bulb of fennel and weigh it . Her physical_therapist is coming_by four times a week to work_on the muscles she screwed_up by not walking correctly after a stroke . And she still has to find the time to pack for a quick trip to Paris to visit her daughter . On top of that , she ' s worried about how the book will be received . Just last spring her one-time business partner and former co-author Julee Rosso put_out a solo book , &quot; Great Good Food , &quot; and got trashed in the press . The consensus on Rosso ' s book : Anything but great . Disappointing . Thumbs down . Cook ' s Illustrated called it &quot; a hodgepodge of somewhat contrived recipes. &quot; The New York Times said too many of her recipes were &quot; flawed by errors and lapses that could cause consternation in the kitchen and chagrin at the table. &quot; Newsweek said food prepared according to Rosso ' s recipes tasted &quot; lousy. &quot; Rosso , who pocketed an advance reported to be $ 625 # 000 , insisted that she and four assistants tested 1 # 500 recipes in 10 months to select the 800 used in the book . Her detractors said that was impossible . No matter , Crown Publishing won ' t talk specifics but reveals that the thick paperback of low-fat recipes has been a fast seller : Since last April the book has sold about 500 # 000 copies . So was the book really that bad , or was it a matter of the food establishment -- the &quot; Food Mafia , &quot; as_many call it -- taking sides in the professional divorce of a couple that helped change the way America eats ? In 1977 , the dynamic duo -- Lukins the caterer and Rosso the marketer -- co-founded the Silver Palate in Manhattan , one of the first gourmet take-out shops in the country . The highfalutin home cooking they pioneered contributed to a radical change in baby_boomer eating habits . Sauteed chicken_livers with blueberry vinegar , caviar eclairs , pizza pot pie and pesto by the quart were suddenly the rage from Boca Raton to Bellingham . To date , their three Silver Palate cookbooks have sold more_than 5 million copies . By the time the partnership ended , shortly after the sale of their shop in 1988 , the pair were barely speaking . &quot; We were great friends , &quot; says Lukins , &quot; It ' s over now. &quot; After the breakup , Rosso moved to Michigan and discovered yogurt cheese , while Lukins began traveling and researching her &quot; All Around the World Cookbook &quot; for Workman , the publishers of the original Silver Palate books . &quot; I wish with all my heart that Julee ' s book had been nicely received because everyone is going_to want to see how the other one did , &quot; Lukins says . &quot; I ' m sure I ' ll be scrutinized plenty . . . . And I did not get a huge advance ! &quot; But make a_few calls to key people in the food world and you ' ll find no one filing their nails in anticipation of the Lukins release , as they did with Rosso ' s book . Lukins , who is 51 , suffered a massive cerebral_hemorrhage in 1991 and , according to Pat Adrian , who buys books for the Book of the Month Club , the &quot; Food Mafia &quot; rushed to be loyal to her . &quot; A lot of people were jealous of both women for a long_time , &quot; says Adrian . &quot; ( Blasting Rosso ' s book ) should have been a great chatty lunch at La Cirque rather than ( the media event ) it ended_up being . After all , it ' s just a cookbook . It ' s not going_to change the world. &quot; The food world has changed dramatically , though , in the 30 years since Julia Child first showed a generation of cooks how to make coq_au_vin . Before the gastronomic revolution , Americans cared more about convenience than quality . Cookbooks were for newlyweds -- the red-and-white checkered &quot; Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook &quot; or , for those reaching for a higher shelf , &quot; The Joy of Cooking. &quot; Canned cream of mushroom soup was a staple and tuna casserole an achievement . In the late ' 60s and into the ' 70s and ' 80s , the newly affluent and globally mobile rediscovered the cuisines of Europe and the Far East . Sensitive palates rejected Tang , Velveeta and Baco-Bits . Suddenly , they wanted osso_buco , not beef_stew , and mee krob instead of macaroni . Egged_on by foreign chefs who opened restaurants and cooking schools in America , the baby_boomers tried such esoterica as foie gras- stuffed duck hearts and lamb fillet with kiwi sauce . The Silver Palate books made this aesthetic accessible to home cooks around the country by reinterpreting -- some say watering_down -- the revolution with friendly , easy-to-use recipes . Finally , as the ' 80s came_to an end , the pendulum swang away from haute cuisine toward simpler , less expensive regional and ethnic cooking . Now , Lukins is hoping mainstream America is ready for Peloponnesian lamb shanks and Moroccan marmalade , but she ' s not sure . Her publisher thinks so -- it has announced a first printing of 350 # 000 , believed to be a record for a cookbook . &quot; A huge amount of my pride is involved in this book , &quot; says Lukins . &quot; I just didn ' t want this book to be another clone ( of the others ) . Those books are great , fun , and fine but they are what they are . I wanted to do something different. &quot; Yet , the book is unmistakably in the Silver Palate format , down to the little drawings ( although Lukins wasn ' t the illustrator on this book , as she was_on the others ) and boxed sidebars . Even the ethnic-inspired recipes are reinterpreted for the American kitchen , in Silver Palate fashion . There are very few ingredients called_for in the book that aren ' t readily available in Omaha . But then Lukins did not intend to go_around the world and bring_back the strictly authentic recipes of each country . Instead , she took the best of what she found and created food . &quot; I don ' t know what it ' s called , &quot; she says , &quot; I guess it ' s Sheila ' s cooking . I didn ' t go looking_for chefs ' recipes or into people ' s homes to cook . Paula Wolfert does that and I would never try to rival her. &quot; One thing she is secure about : The recipes work . &quot; Every cookbook has a_couple_of mistakes , you just can ' t help it , &quot; she admits . &quot; But you can ' t forgive an entire book that doesn ' t work . What ' s the point of having cookbooks ? &quot; In other words , she ' s confident of her cooking ability . But she didn ' t start_out that way . Lukins was born in Philadelphia and grew_up in Connecticut . She attended high_school in Westport , a.k.a Martha Stewart-land . &quot; I was there before she was , &quot; says Lukins . By the time she was_well into her 20s , Lukins was married and had a degree in art education from New York University . Her first job out of college was inking patterns for McCalls . The only cooking she did was to throw something together at the end of a long , tedious day . That changed when her husband , Richard , who ran a security business , was transferred to England . A bored housewife , Lukins enrolled in cooking classes at Le Cordon_Bleu to occupy her time . The following year , Richard was transferred to Paris , and Lukins signed_up for more classes . &quot; that ' s the way to learn , &quot; she says . &quot; In Paris I took cooking lessons and French_lessons during the day and then cooked for my darling husband at night. &quot; Back in New York and raising two daughters in the Dakota Apartments ( John Lennon ' s last address ) , a bachelor in the building called one night in a panic . He had invited a group over for dinner and the superintendent ' s wife , who usually cooked for him when he had guests , was_on vacation . &quot; I said , ' Don ' t worry , I ' ll cook you dinner , ' &quot; Lukins remembers . &quot; So as was the fashion in the mid- ' 60s , I cooked moussaka , a Greek salad , some stuffed grape leaves and sent it over . I charged him $ 50 plus the cost of the food . He ended_up with a great dinner and I wound_up with $ 50. &quot; She also wound_up with a new career . One of the guests at the bachelor ' s dinner_party was Gael Greene , restaurant critic for New York magazine . Greene loved the party food and mentioned it to her friend , Joan Kron , who immediately called Ellen Stern , who at the time wrote the &quot; Best Bets &quot; column for the magazine . &quot; It was New York telephone at its best , &quot; says Lukins now . &quot; Ellen Stern ran a half-page picture of me and my kitchen with a headline : ' Eat , Drink and Be Murray. ' &quot; The article portrayed Lukins as a bachelor ' s best cook . &quot; I got 200 calls from single men , &quot; she says . Six months later , the Other Woman Catering Co . was born . A year later , Lukins teamed_up with Julee Rosso to open the Silver Palate . The two met when Rosso , an advertising executive for Burlington , hired Lukins to cater a press breakfast introducing Oleg Cassini sheets . * It ' s April , &quot; Sheila Lukins Around the World Cookbook &quot; is about to hit the stores and Lukins ' mood has lifted considerably . She ' s almost giddy . Vanity_Fair , a magazine known more for its profiles of Roseanne Arnold , Jack Nicholson and Demi Moore , has just printed a flattering article on her . She even cracks a_few jokes at her own expense . Doing research for the book , she persuaded the curator at the Carmen Miranda Museum in Rio de Janeiro to open one of the glass showcases so her husband could take a picture of her posing with a life-like mannequin of her longtime idol . She sent the snapshot , along with several other photos , to illustrate her book . But the publishers rejected it because Lukins had pulled_up her T-shirt and revealed her bellybutton . She ' s proud_of her figure , and why not ? She ' s taken_off almost 30 pounds ( going from a size 12 to a size 8 ) , partly from the stress of traveling_to 33 countries in two years . The water in Russia made her sick . Bad shrimp in Bangkok gave her food_poisoning . While she was in South_America , there was a cholera epidemic . Terrorists bombed Bombay during her visit there . To get_to Cuba , she had to fly in a pre-World War II prop plane via Jamaica . And she missed out on the best food in Russia when Gorbachev was ousted just as she was headed to Georgia . Actress-turned-infomercial host Victoria Principal is also partly responsible_for Lukins ' weight loss . &quot; I remember someone coming_into the Silver Palate kitchen one morning and telling us that Victoria Principal said she never , never , never ate cheese , &quot; says Lukins . &quot; We laughed , but since then I ' ve never , never , never eaten cheese &quot; ( though cheese does show_up in her cookbooks ) . She ' s cooking healthier too . She has practically eliminated red meat and dairy_products from her diet , eating mainly fresh fruits and vegetables , pastas and grains , fish and chicken . She keeps five bottles of olive_oil and three kinds of vinegar near her stove . &quot; What do I need butter for ? &quot; she says . Does this mean her next project might be a book on low-fat cooking ? Like the one her former partner did ? &quot; Oh please , &quot; she says . &quot; I don ' t know what ' s the big deal about low-fat books . They make me sick. &quot; Still , health is a big concern now for Lukins . Her life almost ended in 1991 when a blood_vessel in her brain burst without warning . It took two operations and weeks of therapy before she was able to leave a wheelchair . &quot; I ' m happy not to be dead , &quot; she says . She hasn ' t driven since the hemorrhage and takes anti-seizure medication to control tremors that occasionally occur in her left_hand . &quot; There was a time I was crying plenty , but I have had quadrillion hours of therapy , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' m OK now. &quot; * One week later Lukins ' book comes_out and it ' s already received its first review . Cook ' s Illustrated tested 30 recipes from the 450 in the book . Its verdict : &quot; We were underwhelmed. &quot; Plus , the reviewer brought_up the Rosso book in the first paragraph . Afterward Lukins is subdued and never mentions the story . But she wonders aloud if her name will be linked with Rosso ' s forever . &quot; Will anyone ever write a story about me without mentioning her ? &quot; she asks . &quot; I know everyone will compare the two books , &quot; says Nach Waxman , owner of Kitchen Arts and Letters bookstore , gossip central to the New York food world . &quot; The Julee business will do no good for Sheila ' s book . Well , Simon and Garfunkel made_it -- separately . Of course , all everyone has wanted to do since is put them back together again. &quot; Lukins has been around a long_time , though , and she ' s philosophical about the world of cookbook publishing . &quot; When you put yourself before the public and say , ' this is my work , here it is , ' &quot; she says , &quot; I think they look hard. &quot; With her book in the stores and more reviews to come , Lukins can only wait and see what the consensus on her solo project will be . And maybe , a_few books from now , her work will be reviewed without the mentions of her past life as half of a famous &quot; foodie couple. &quot; For now , she is content in the knowledge that she has done the best book she could . . . on_her_own . * When Lukins was asked to name her favorite recipe in the book , without hesitating she answered , &quot; Peloponnesian lamb shanks. &quot; She recommends serving them with orzo or a vegetable couscous . The fresh mint stirred in just before serving adds not only color but great flavor . SPICED PELOPONNESIAN LAMB SHANKS 4 ( 1-pound ) lamb shanks 1 teaspoon coarse salt 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black_pepper 3 tablespoons olive_oil 1 medium onion , cut_in half lengthwise and slivered 1 cup beef_broth 1 cup dry red_wine 2 tablespoons honey 4 large cloves garlic , lightly bruised 2 ( 3-inch-long ) cinnamon sticks 4 fresh sage leaves Dash ground cloves 1 cup seeded and coarsely chopped ripe plum tomatoes 1 1 / 2 cups pitted prunes 1 / 4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves Sprinkle lamb shanks with salt and pepper .
