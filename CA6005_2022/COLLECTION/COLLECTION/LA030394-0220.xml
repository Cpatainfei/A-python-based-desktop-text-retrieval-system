   <HEADLINE> SLIGHT JOB LOSS FROM QUAKE IS PREDICTED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A multibillion-dollar infusion of government earthquake relief and private insurance funds will fuel a temporary employment surge in the Los Angeles area , but the construction boomlet will soon wither , giving_way to a small long-term job loss , according to a report Wednesday to the state Seismic Safety Commission . In the most detailed analysis yet of the effects of the devastating Northridge earthquake on employment rates , researchers with UCLA ' s Business Forecasting Project estimated a loss of 29 # 300 jobs in Los Angeles County and 35 # 700 in the state during the first_quarter of this year as a result of the Jan . 17 disaster . By the third quarter , reconstruction financed by about $ 14.4 billion in federal and state assistance and insurance payments will reverse the employment losses , creating 36 # 000 more jobs in Los Angeles County and 45 # 500 more in the state than would exist had the 6.8-magnitude quake not occurred , according to the UCLA report . By the end of 1996 , however , &quot; the stimulative effects of the earthquake will disappear , &quot; and Los Angeles County will have 12 # 600 fewer jobs , and the state 18 # 500 fewer , than if there had been no quake , the forecast said . The report said the quake by itself will not prompt business owners to shun Southern California . But while the quake &quot; mainly reminds those making location decisions of seismic risks that were_well known before , it still reinforces negative images of other disasters , &quot; including wildfires , riots and floods , analysts told the seismic safety panel at its meeting in Burbank . Even so , the long-term job losses are small when measured against the state ' s roughly 12 million workers and the huge cutbacks already felt in defense and aerospace employment , said Larry J . Kimbell , director of the Business Forecasting Project . Kimbell noted that the state in recent years has lost about 150 # 000 defense jobs , and is expected to lose another 80 # 000 -- &quot; 10 times any permanent loss we would expect from the earthquake. &quot; Noting that Southern California is already in its worst recession since the Great Depression -- and that property values suffered their greatest decline since the 1920s even before the earthquake -- Kimbell described quake-related job losses as &quot; a small-scale event. &quot; Economically , &quot; we ' ve already had our 8.3 , &quot; remarked his colleague Nancy Bolton , a senior demographer with the Business Forecasting Project , referring to predictions of the Big One , a quake of that magnitude occurring some day on the San Andreas Fault . Under questioning from members of the seismic safety panel , Kimbell acknowledged that such a giant quake would have profound economic effects . Whereas the Northridge quake will absorb about $ 1.9 billion in state relief funds , cleanup from the Big One could consume &quot; half of the state budget -- $ 25 billion , &quot; Kimbell said .
