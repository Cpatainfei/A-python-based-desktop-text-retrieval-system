   <TEXT> Jenny Craig ' s dismal balance_sheet ( &quot; Jenny Craig Takes a Pounding , &quot; May 22 ) brings with it good news that more and more people are realizing that there are far better ways to slim_down . The Jenny Craig program and others like it fail because they focus_on the wrong thing.They restrict calories and quantities , leading to a sense of deprivation . The result is a powerful tendency to binge . To make matters worse , the resultant slowed metabolism sabotages future efforts to maintain or lose_weight . Ironically , these programs do not restrict fat intake nearly enough to guarantee health or weight loss . A much better way to lose_weight and to keep it off is to forget about how much you eat and focus instead on what you eat . Complex carbohydrates from pasta , rice , beans and vegetables speed metabolism . The enemy is the fat in meats , dairy_products and fried foods , which goes straight to the thighs and hips . Around 20 % of the calories on the Jenny Craig program come from fat . A diet based on beans , grains , fruits and vegetables , on the other hand , contributes only 10 % of its calories in the form of fat , representing a far more sensible approach to weight loss , and one that can be sustained over the longer term . The best approach is a low-fat vegetarian diet . It gives people the power to tackle weight problems on_their_own , enabling them to get_on_with life as they lose_weight , rather than just lose money and hope .
