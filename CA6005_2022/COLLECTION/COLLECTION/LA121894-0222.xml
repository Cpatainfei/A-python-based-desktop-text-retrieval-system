   <HEADLINE> HUB-AND-SPOKE ROUTING WON ' T HELP BUS SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is to voice my strong disagreement with your Dec . 4 editorial that supported the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ' s efforts to redesign the San Fernando Valley bus_line routing to fit a hub-and-spoke motif . To begin with , the Valley is laid_out in an almost-perfect grid.Were the bus_lines routed correctly and the scheduling done properly , none of the problems you noted would exist . Hub-and-spoke would not be an improvement over the present system . A number of lines will be taken_out of service , displacing many riders and causing them to leave earlier for work and arrive home much later . Riders will be forced to use transit centers -- usually at dismal and desolate places without stores , restrooms or other urban amenities . Several lines will run even less frequently , so that , except in rush_hours , people will still have to wait long whiles for buses . All or parts of some major streets will lose bus_services altogether -- this will be particularly true in low-income and minority areas , which have the bulk of the bus-riding public . The significance of Warner Center is appreciated , but will it generate the amount of bus riders to justify the hub-and-spoke plans for it ? How many bus_lines will feed into the center and at the expense of how many other lines ? If one is a bus rider , it would be very difficult to support the hub-and-spoke concept for the Valley . I see the Valley for what it is and what it needs in the way of public transportation for I am an all-purpose user of the system . I see the schools , the industrial areas , the parks , the shopping_centers that are underserved -- or not served at all , such_as the equestrian center . CHARLES J . THOMAS North Hollywood</TEXT>
