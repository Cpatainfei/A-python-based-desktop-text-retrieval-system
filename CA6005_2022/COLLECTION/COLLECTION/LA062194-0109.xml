   <TEXT> Linda Schaffer ' s &quot; Homeward Bound , &quot; another absorbing one-hour American Movie Classics documentary on the movies , uses home_movies , newsreels and archival footage as well as Hollywood films to reveal how American family life has changed since the advent of sound . It doesn ' t tell us much that we don ' t already know but it has the virtue of calling attention to filmmakers who have tried to reflect real_life and deal with human values . Norman Lear , Paul Mazursky and Robert Benton , all_of whom have dealt with family life -- Lear on TV -- are all old enough to have experienced the Great Depression as children , and they all attest to family solidarity in the face of substantial financial adversity , as exemplified on the screen in &quot; The Grapes of Wrath. &quot; While TV in the ' 50s was idealizing the family , much in the manner of the earlier Andy Hardy pictures , the big screen was commencing to depict the disintegration of the family , most notably in the James Dean films &quot; Rebel Without a Cause &quot; and &quot; East of Eden. &quot; More recent decades have been marked by films dealing with divorce and single parenting ; even so , this pleasant special ends on an optimistic note , reaffirming the revival of the family -- but in new configurations . * &quot; Homeward Bound &quot; airs at 6 and 9 tonight on cable ' s AMC channel .
