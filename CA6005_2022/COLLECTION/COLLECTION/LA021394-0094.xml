   <HEADLINE> SYRIA ; WARM WELCOMES , DAMASCUS TO ALEPPO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The blue light of dusk had already begun to settle over this ancient city when we spotted the sign . We sprinted across the rush_hour traffic , ignoring the honking taxis . &quot; Look ! &quot; we shouted to each other as we pointed at the words overhead : &quot; Saad Kayal , M.D. &quot; The family_name in lights . And a doctor , too ! My roots brought me to Syria , but I had as little idea what to expect as any other American . I grew_up a mall-going , Long_Island girl and have none of the dark , sultry features that I associated with Syrians ( wrongly , as I soon found_out ) . And I always cringed slightly when someone linked me to that troublesome dictatorship bordering Iraq . I speak no Arabic , and my father and my uncle have forgotten most of theirs . Being a Syrian American meant only that I knew how to concoct a number of wonderful dishes , and that I had a box full of gold bangles and a jangly pair of filigree earrings from Aleppo , the city of my paternal grandparents . But when my sittau -- my grandmother -- died two years ago , severing our last link to Arab culture , my uncle decided that he and I should go scratch around the family ' s ancestral stamping_grounds . Our journey began last October , just days after the world cheered a historic and unexpected peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( an agreement that Syria did not back then , and silently threatened to scuttle ) . Two Americans going_to the demon Middle_East ? Were we crazy ? Our friends thought so , and their most frequent parting remark -- &quot; Be careful &quot; -- only unsettled us more . Our misgivings melted as soon as we touched_down in Damascus . The crimeless streets ( one of the benefits of a dictatorship ) were_full of European tourists -- Germans , French and British who apparently hadn ' t heard that this was a dangerous vacation_spot . Most of the Syrians were eager to greet us and practice their English , the second language that appeared on many of the signs throughout the country . On our first day , an attendant at the dusty , artifact-filled National Museum was so happy to meet some Americans firsthand that he gave us eight postcards &quot; for friendship. &quot; A boy of about 11 ran_up to us in the street to ask where we were from . &quot; Welcome to our country , &quot; he said . Those were the words we would hear most often during our two-week stay . In addition to a warm welcome , Syria offers cities with cosmopolitan bustle and a 1930s charm , spectacular desert landscapes and ancient ruins straight out of an archeologist ' s dream . The travel is rugged and the word &quot; luxury &quot; has a slightly different meaning , but for adventurers who don ' t mind earthiness , the payoffs are_well worth it . In Damascus , which claims to be the oldest inhabited city on earth ( some say 9 # 000 years old ) , the air swells with music and perfume . Four times a day , and once more at sunset , the hypnotic call to prayer , &quot; Allah akbar &quot; ( &quot; God is Great &quot; ) floats up from the city ' s 250 mosques and beats softly against the sawdust-brown hills that border the city . Fragrances that I had known only in my sittau ' s home -- grilled lamb , mint , sweet , thick cardamom-scented coffee -- unfurl through the streets and mingle with the sweet jasmine that grows everywhere . To see the rest of the country and find our way 200 miles north to Aleppo , we hired a taxi , as we ' d been told was the custom even for long distances . Our 72-year-old driver , Essmayel , who spoke English well and had two gold incisors , took his duty seriously . &quot; You have come_to see your country , &quot; he said . &quot; You shall see everything you want ! &quot; He ' d told us that in Syria &quot; there is a ruin every 25 centimeters. &quot; He seemed determined that we should see them all . * After two days of climbing around ruins in southern Syria , we piled into Essmayel ' s 1983 yellow Nissan at 6 a.m. We would head east across the desert about 150 miles to Palmyra , where Queen Zenobia -- Syria ' s answer to Cleopatra -- had dared to challenge Rome . We were the only ones on_the_road , save an occasional truck filled with red_peppers or pomegranates usually coming_down the middle lane in the opposite direction . Essmayel ' s wife had come_along and , like every good sittau , she kept us well-supplied with apples , almond bars , sweet pistachio cakes and cardamom-flavored bubble_gum . She also brought a Coleman vacuum_bottle full of ice_water that we cracked open just before the desert began . Syria ' s tarred strip of highway cuts the wide plain like a river . Mud-packed mountains with jagged rock atop swell in the distance like giant ant hills . They made us feel_like a board-game-sized car driving through a diorama . Dust and road grit covered our windshield , our sunglasses , our teeth . But somewhere around mile 100 of the Cham Desert , the hard-packed earth gives_way to lush olive groves , grape vines and fields of wheat and cotton . Essmayel poked me in the ribs and yelled , &quot; This is Syria ! &quot; He waved his hand_out the window and swept it across the plain where irrigation pumps and pipeline-sized concrete troughs carry precious water all_the way to the horizon . &quot; Big tractors , &quot; Essmayel said , &quot; make_it like California ! &quot; The desert is_full of such surprises . Contradictions cluster so close_together they become difficult to comprehend : Cave dwellings lay 100 yards from condos ; robed Bedouins ride tractors . A few miles further , a woman in a chador , the traditional Muslim dress , stood hitchhiking . We passed the only herd of camels we would see as we drew_near Palmyra . The 1960s version of the American song &quot; The Name Game &quot; came_on the radio mixed with the smell of a cucumber being peeled in the back seat . Palmyra appears through the dust like a handful of pink amethyst strewn across the sand . The rosy skeleton of the city is so well-preserved that you can easily visualize the bustle of the 80 # 000 merchants and businessmen who made_it the capital of the spice and silk trade nearly 2 # 000 years ago . * The mile-long main avenue lies like a parade route toward the hilltop citadel that cracks the sapphire sky . It seems as if it has all_of its original 300 columns ( though less than half remain ) , and pieces of the limestone roadway still bear the grooves of wagon_wheels . Intact facades of long-gone shops lie just outside the columns . The trail of history at Palmyra , though , is most visible at the Temple of Bel , whose monstrous pillars and sacrificial table stand side_by_side with remnants of a mosque , built_on a church , built_on a pagan temple . Palmyra had its greatest day in the 3rd Century , when Queen Zenobia proclaimed the kingdom ' s independence from Rome ( after helping to assassinate her husband , some believe ) . She conquered all_of Syria and lower Egypt and was preparing to go_further when the Romans arrived and carted her off -- in gold chains , no less . With her departure , Palmyra soon became nothing more_than a faded frontier town . Near sunset , we climbed to the citadel , accompanied part of the way by a Bedouin boy who played his reed for us . Standing_in the cusp of the_hill , something Essmayel had said suddenly made_sense to me . When I had asked him how the pain and hatred between Israel and the Arabs could be overcome to bring the new peace -- which everyone we spoke_to said they wanted -- he responded : &quot; We have a great history . We understand such things. &quot; I had stewed over those words for days . But it was only as I watched the remains of almyra below us begin to glow red that I understood what Essmayel had meant . In this part of the world , even the most pitched_battles merge in the swirl of history , where they mellow and eventually become part of the landscape . A few days before Israel released 700 Palestinians as a concession to peace , we set_out for the final leg of our journey to Aleppo . * Two hours west of Palmyra , we stopped at the Krak des Chevaliers , an imposing Crusaders castle standing hawklike on its perch above the landscape . It was overcome by 13th-Century Muslim forces who were smart enough to employ that old Trojan_Horse trick : They sent a forged letter in the name of the defenders ' commander advising them to surrender . Then we turned north and stopped at Hamath , a ruin that ' s only 12 years old . Hamath is famous for its giant wooden waterwheels built_in the Middle_Ages to irrigate the city ' s gardens and orchards . In 1982 , it was all but destroyed by the tanks of Syrian President Hafez Assad , who bombarded the town to suppress a Muslim fundamentalist uprising . Of the city ' s more_than 30 waterwheels , only 10 remain . Their tattered planks rise along the shores of the Orontes River , but serve as little other_than diving platforms for local teen-agers . A colossal statue of Assad marks the entrance to the city . Assad , in fact , makes_sure everyone remembers who ' s boss by plastering his image all_over the country . We caught three different profiles of him even before we got_through customs . Assad sports a number of different looks : there ' s the debonair &quot; Belmondo &quot; Assad , with half-cocked head and eyes squinting with laughter ; the serious General Assad ; angelic Assad with a gold corona , to name but a_few . Some of these are enormous , backlit portraits with lights strung around them . * As the road continues north , the soil turns from dusty brown to rich red ochre . We passed pomegranate_trees bending under their ruby weight as my uncle and Essmayel drilled me on my newly learned Arabic . We started with personal_pronouns . &quot; Ana , Inta , he ' a , who ' a &quot; ( &quot; I , &quot; &quot; you , &quot; &quot; she , &quot; &quot; he &quot; ) . I practiced over and over . I had already begun to understand simple sentences without realizing it , as a part of my brain closed since childhood had suddenly opened . I hadn ' t realized that I knew any Arabic at all , except for certain food words and the phrase &quot; Ateeni bosi &quot; -- &quot; Give me a kiss &quot; -- a standard part of any grandchild ' s lexicon . My uncle , who like my father had grown_up speaking Arabic but now remembered only basic phrases , stared at me in amazement as I repeated to him in English bits of his rudimentary conversations with people . The lessons ended around dusk on our approach to Aleppo . I reached back and squeezed my uncle ' s hand in excitement . We stared out the window silently with butterflies in our stomachs as we noticed something we hadn ' t seen in Damascus : white-painted metal terraces -- filigreed , just like my earrings . After checking_into our hotel , we hurried down the tree-lined avenues toward the center of town . A right turn , a left turn , a right turn and suddenly the street opened onto a blue-lit boulevard , wide with fountains and sidewalk cafes . My family early had weaned me from romantic visions of my grandfather ' s pre-American life . When I was small , I thought that my giddau had ridden a camel , but I was informed that Giddau was from a city , and therefore most likely had never even seen a camel . Sittau ' s parents had come from Aleppo even before Giddau , so no one had any information about their lives . That left me with no images to conjure . But the jumble of Aleppo ' s ancient history and cosmopolitan flair gave me some answers . Smartly dressed families pack the city ' s restaurants and men fill the coffee houses , smoking four-foot-high water_pipes as they play cards . The white-tiled pastry shops look_like pizza joints , with customers yelling out orders and teen-age waiters hurrying to deliver stacks of rosewater sweets . Shops proffer shoes from Paris and finely made clothing . The tawdry bustle of Baron Street contrasts with the faded elegance of the 84-year-old Baron Hotel , where Lawrence of Arabia stayed and where , some say , 30 years ago guests could shoot ducks off the balcony . And although there had been 80 years between Giddau ' s departure and my arrival , the 1957 Chevy taxi cabs let me know that things probably hadn ' t changed all that much . Dinner was another revelation . In southern Syria , we had begun to think that our relatives were the only Syrians who ate stuffed grape leaves hot and in tomato_sauce . In Damascus , they serve the leaves cold , with olive_oil ( in the Greek fashion that most Americans know ) . But here in Halab , the Arabic name for Aleppo , they arrived steaming , just like Sittau ' s . The other delights of Syrian cuisine -- babaghannouj ( an eggplant dip ) , hummus ( made from chick peas and garlic ) , tabbouleh ( a parsley salad ) , kibbeh ( fried lamb with wheat ) -- were the same as in Damascus , but with the addition of something special : mamuniyya . Mamuniyya is a childhood breakfast treat made from farina and sugar that Damascenes had curled their lips at when telling me they didn ' t have it . And then there was the medieval covered bazaar , the souk , a living contradiction to the sophistication of the cafe district . Imagine the frenzy of a street where a fire or earthquake is under way ; that is what the souk is like . Rampaging donkeys and boys on bikes careen through the covered alleyways saddled with sacks of allspice and coffee . We wandered past stall after stall of red_peppers , green_beans , whole lambs , halves of lambs , eyes of lamb , every conceivable part of lamb and stopping to have coffee with a trader , who told us he had cousins in New Jersey . Our new friend led us to the gold souk ( the shopping areas are divided according to life ' s basic needs : food , clothing and gold ) , where we bought a bangle by haggling the merchant to submission ( &quot; Sittau used to do this in Macy ' s , &quot; my uncle said to me , closing his eyes with remembered mortification ) . We stumbled out of the souk giggling like drunks and covered with a fine soot of cardamom , coffee and donkey dust . We squinted like moles in the sunlight as we made our way to the nearby citadel , which stands at the market ' s end . The next day , we decided to try to locate some family , although , after eight decades we knew the odds were slim . There were plenty of our namesakes about , however -- one was the chief of police , we found_out , and the others were apparently very wealthy . What we found was a gravel-voiced former journalist , Giddau ' s first_cousin , who had the same distinctive jowls that I remember on my grandfather . We found him by asking after any Kayals at the Byzantine_church where we figured my grandfather had been a member . One of the laymen led us through the winding alleyways of the Christian quarter , knocking_on doors until we found the right family . Joseph Kayal greeted us with surprise and fondly referred to my grandfather , Mitchell , as &quot; Mike. &quot; We stayed for tea , took a photo of all_of us together , then went_back out into the city . We left Aleppo two days later . We were eager to show my parents the photos of Giddau ' s cousin , and yet , tracking our relatives had somehow seemed anti-climactic . We were far more excited about our photos of Palmyra and the Syrian children . As we drove_back down the highway we ' d come_in on , we realized that we were only one small punctuation_mark in the history of the land that claims to be the cradle of civilization , the beginning of everybody ' s roots -- even of our skeptical friends back home .
