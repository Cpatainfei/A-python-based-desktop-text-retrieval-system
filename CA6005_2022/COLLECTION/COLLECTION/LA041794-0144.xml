   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / JOHN TIRMAN : ' FRIENDLY FIRE ' ACCUSATIONS MISS THE MARK ; WE SHOULD BE DEBATING HOW TO USE U.S. FORCES AND WHETHER THEY ARE PROPERLY TRAINED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the two U.S. Blackhawk helicopters were shot down by U.S. warplanes Thursday over Iraq , killing 26 people , it provided some insights into the emerging debate over America ' s military role in the post-Cold War era . Within hours , Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) , the next House minority_leader , blamed President Clinton for cutting defense too deeply while spreading U.S. forces too broadly &quot; across the planet. &quot; Gingrich ' s comments echo the Republicans ' oft-repeated complaint that Clinton is creating a &quot; hollow army &quot; with too few resources to keep forces prepared to do battle . Two days earlier , two GOP House members , Steven Buyer of Indiana and Henry Bonilla of Texas , appeared on the &quot; MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour &quot; to assess Clinton ' s policy in Bosnia , where U.S. warplanes under NATO command had just bombed Serbian artillery positions near Gorazde . Buyer and Bonilla both chimed the same tune : Multilateral peacekeeping is a loser because American forces should not be under foreign commanders . The forces are &quot; less efficient , &quot; Bonilla said . Here , then , are two legs of the Republican triad of American power : We should , they say , maintain an exceptionally well-heeled military , and we should eschew multilateralism in all its forms . The third leg , which underlies the &quot; see no evil &quot; approach to outrages like the dictatorship in Haiti , is that the United States should act militarily only to protect our &quot; vital national interests. &quot; Those vital interests , however , are rarely if ever articulated . The sad incident over Iraq is revealing because it demonstrates how empty and partisan this Republican triad is . Operation Provide Comfort was begun three years ago , following the Gulf War , because Republican President George_Bush had encouraged Iraqi Kurds to rebel and then abandoned them to the bloody whims of Saddam Hussein . It was only after widespread humanitarian protests embarrassed Bush that relief efforts and a safe haven for Kurds were enabled by U.S. and allied forces . If there was overreach -- forces spread_out too thinly across the planet -- it was done_well before Clinton was inaugurated and with Republican support . Thursday ' s &quot; friendly fire &quot; incident , far from exposing a &quot; hollow &quot; military , involved the most sophisticated equipment money can buy . And the aircraft were under U.S. command , transporting British , French and Turkish as well as American officers . The death toll was higher than the infamous firefight in Somalia last autumn that Republicans hold_up as evidence for avoiding peacekeeping roles . There , too , U.S. forces were under U.S. command . The vacuous critique by the Republicans , however , should not deter serious questions about U.S. military operations overseas . Indeed , there is a legitimate doubt about the advisability of Operation Provide Comfort . Is the United States , for example , to be the guarantor of Kurdish rights in northern Iraq indefinitely ? Puzzling , too , is our lack of attention to the mistreatment of Turkish Kurds just across the border . Turkey is being ripped apart by a civil_war in which 10 # 000 have died since 1984 . Kurdish rights , so important in the Iraqi context , are ignored by the State_Department just a_few miles away . Washington ' s approach to the Turkish-Kurdish conflict is , almost exclusively , to supply weapons to the Turkish security_forces ; Turkey is now the third largest recipient of U.S. arms exports . To be sure , the questions in Turkey and Iraq are complex . But it is increasingly clear that the United States cannot solve these complexities with military_force . Like Bosnia , the Iraqi situation may be beyond satisfying solutions , with or without applications of armed might . That conclusion , like it or not , may apply to many conflicts around the world . So the Republican critique misses the mark on at least two counts . The size and ability of U.S. armed forces are not in doubt ; the question is how and when to use them , and whether they are trained properly for peacekeeping -- in contrast to Cold_War -- missions . The matter of U.S. troops under foreign commanders is a red_herring , thrown into the debate to stir_up chauvinistic passions . We should debate what our vital national interests are , however , and military intervention must always be based on clear and compelling purposes . In Iraq , it is that part of the Republican triad that should give us pause .</TEXT>
