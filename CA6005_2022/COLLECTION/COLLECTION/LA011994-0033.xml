   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; CREWS WORK TO CONTAIN CRUDE-OIL SPILL IN RIVER ; ECOLOGY : A 15-MILE SLICK SPREADS TO PIRU AFTER PIPELINE BREAKS DURING JOLT . AREA IS HOME TO TWO ENDANGERED SPECIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cleanup crews scrambled Tuesday to contain a 15-mile-long slick of crude_oil that spilled into the Santa Clara River , spreading from Santa Clarita to Piru , after a nearby pipeline ruptured during Monday ' s earthquake . Officials estimate 147 # 000 gallons leaked_out of the 10-inch-wide pipeline before the spill was discovered at 8:30 a.m. Monday . By late Tuesday , state officials at the spill site had not found any injured fish or birds , said Mary Gale , a spokeswoman for the state_Department of Fish and Game ' s Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response . However , she said it was too early to determine the spill ' s full effect on the river and its wildlife . &quot; Generally , you don ' t see ( injuries to birds ) in the first 24 hours , &quot; Gale said . The segment of the river stained by the spill is home to two federally endangered species -- the three-spined unarmored stickleback fish , and the least Bell ' s vireo , a bird . Also threatened are several species of birds and fish that state officials consider vulnerable . The pipeline is owned by Long Beach-based Four Corners Pipe Line Co. , a subsidiary of Arco . The line , used to transport oil from Kern County to several Los Angeles refineries , broke_in nine places during the quake , an Arco official said . Two breaks_in a 100-yard area in Santa Clarita , one in the pipe and another in the pipe ' s pumping station , contributed to the river spill . The pipeline , which is more_than 50 years old , was not pumping oil at the time of the quake but held a residue of heavy crude , said Albert Greenstein , an Arco spokesman . More_than 200 workers hired by Arco used booms and constructed earthen dams to contain the spill downriver just south of the town of Piru . * Officials at the spill site said less than a quarter of the oil had been collected late Tuesday , and they predicted the spill could take months to clean_up completely . &quot; This is a very large oil spill , &quot; said Reed Smith , a Fish and Game official . &quot; It ' s a mess. &quot; Monday ' s spill was the second in the same environmentally fragile stretch of the Santa Clara River in recent years . In January , 1991 , nearly 75 # 000 gallons of crude gushed from a ruptured Mobil Oil_pipeline , polluting a 15-mile stretch of the river and killing at least 186 birds , wildlife authorities said . &quot; It ' s heartbreaking that the river is taking another blow , &quot; said Cat Brown , a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service . &quot; The short-term and long-term effects of a spill this size could spell disaster for that area. &quot; After the 1991 spill , Mobil contributed $ 200 # 000 to environmental projects to settle a criminal complaint arising from the spill . Gale said she did not know if Arco might be liable for damages from the spill . &quot; We ' re only a day and a half into it , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t feel comfortable making a statement about the possible prosecution. &quot; The spill is also the second in less than a month involving a pipeline in an environmentally sensitive area . On Christmas_Day , more_than 2 # 000 barrels of oil spilled from a ruptured pipeline in McGrath Lake near the mouth of the Santa Clara River . &quot; They say pipelines are supposed to be safer than other means of moving oil , but I guess it ' s all relative , &quot; Brown said . &quot; I think these spills argue for stronger standards in terms of construction and maintenance of these pipelines. &quot; Greenstein said pipelines tend to move with the ground during an earthquake , but that in this instance the quake was centered too close to the pipe to avoid damage . &quot; When it ' s that strong and that close , there isn ' t much you can do , &quot; he said . Of the nine breaks along the line , the two in Santa Clarita were the only ones to spill oil into a body_of_water . Another break_in the same pipeline spilled into a San Fernando street Monday and ignited , destroying 17 vehicles , damaging four homes and severely burning a man passing the fire on his motorcycle , Greenstein said . &quot; All of these problems have been highly unusual for a pipeline , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s very unfortunate that any of this had to happen. &quot; Times staff writer Myron Levin and correspondent Thom Mrozek contributed to this story .</TEXT>
