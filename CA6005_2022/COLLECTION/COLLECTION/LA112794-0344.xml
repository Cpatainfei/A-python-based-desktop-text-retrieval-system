   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN VOWS TO TAKE OFFENSIVE ON SLUMPING ECONOMY ; RUSSIA : PRESIDENT SEEKS SUPPORT OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT FOR HIS 1995 BUDGET , WHICH MANY LAWMAKERS OPPOSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly three years after launching free-market reforms , President Boris N . Yeltsin admitted Saturday that Russia ' s economy is still in decline , but he vowed a bolder attack on inflation with or without Parliament ' s support . &quot; We are close to overcoming the crisis , &quot; Yeltsin told more_than 600 political and business_leaders summoned to the Kremlin . &quot; In 1995 , we will take the offensive . We will achieve financial stabilization and move_on to creating conditions for economic revival. &quot; Yeltsin ' s address and the one-day assembly itself , which he orchestrated , meant more as a challenge to the conservative-led Parliament than as a clear blueprint of how to achieve his aims . He indicated that he would ignore lawmakers if they continued to oppose a tight 1995 budget like the one his government has submitted . The event was one of the president ' s increasingly rare initiatives in support of Western-style economic reform , and it came_after his commitment to that ideal had been thrown into question by a messy , monthlong turnover of his entire economic team . Since his historic decision in January , 1992 , to free most prices , Yeltsin has had five finance_ministers , three central_bank presidents , six Cabinet shake-ups and ongoing internal struggles over the reform policies pursued in his name . The latest personnel changes , which again left the Cabinet split between reformers and reform resisters , were prompted by a one-day drop of 25 % in the ruble ' s value Oct . 11 and the government ' s narrow defeat of a parliamentary vote of no confidence two weeks later . The current Parliament , elected last December after Yeltsin shut_down the old one in a bloody showdown over reforms , went_along passively with the government ' s 1994 budget early this year . But its lower house , the Duma , voted 227-57 on Friday to reject the proposed 1995 budget as unrealistic , challenging the government on its top economic priority . Yeltsin said Saturday that he is ready for &quot; reasonable compromise &quot; with the Duma but warned against &quot; irresponsible populist solutions &quot; that would revive inflation . Duma Chairman Ivan B . Rybkin , speaking at the Kremlin gathering , outlined the battle ahead . He said the government proposes too big a tax burden on individuals and not enough subsidies for Russian producers and exporters . &quot; We cannot backtrack on_the_road to reform , &quot; he said . &quot; But this does not mean there are no alternative ways to get there . . . or that the social costs of large-scale transformations should not be discussed. &quot; The government , which collected just half its expected tax_revenue this year and had to slash spending , now proposes to cover a projected $ 22-billion gap between 1995 income and revenue by borrowing abroad and selling Russian bonds . For the first time , the central_bank would be barred from printing rubles to cover any shortfall . This , according to government calculations , would bring inflation down to 2 % or less per month by mid-1995 . Prices in Russia are expected to triple this year , an improvement over last year ' s ninefold increase , but production is shrinking with no forecast of growth before 1996 . Short of credit and indebted to each other , thousands of enterprises are paralyzed . And the government appears divided over how to shape the free market . Anatoly B . Chubais , the former privatization chief now in_charge of the overall economy , is the only surviving young radical from the reform team of 1992 . Yevgeny Yasin , the new economy minister , is 60 years old and somewhat more moderate . Finance_Minister Vladimir Panskov , who spent time in jail last year on unproven charges of bribe-taking , is a Soviet-era technocrat . All are personally loyal to Yeltsin . The government is under criticism from conservative lawmakers for pushing a tight-money strategy and from liberal ones for failing to undertake planned reforms of the armed forces and the state collective_farms -- bureaucratic monsters that eat_up much of the budget . &quot; We ' ve been taking this medicine for three years . Now they are suggesting that we continue taking it for a fourth year and some deity will throw a switch that will suddenly boost our production , &quot; Mikhail Zadornov , chairman of the Duma budget committee , said before Friday ' s vote . Seeking to sidestep Parliament , Yeltsin invited industrialists and bankers -- &quot; the people organizing our new economic life , &quot; he called them -- to join regional governors and moderate lawmakers at Saturday ' s assembly . He also handpicked the 14 speakers , who generally endorsed his austerity message . The four-hour session reminded some participants of the Communist_Party Central Committee_meetings held_in the same Marbled Hall of the Kremlin before the Soviet_Union collapsed . Sergei Y . Glazyev , a leading opposition economist with a comprehensive reform plan of_his_own , was denied permission to speak . &quot; It is clear that Parliament will never approve the 1995 budget , so the president is enlisting support in other circles , &quot; said Nikolai I . Travkin , a member of the Cabinet and the Duma . &quot; I am sure he will put this support to good use , to give legitimacy to some actions that the Duma won ' t go_along with. &quot;</TEXT>
