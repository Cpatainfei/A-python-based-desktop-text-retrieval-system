   <HEADLINE> ENRON MAKES ELECTRIFYING PROPOSAL ; ENERGY : THE RESPECTED DEVELOPER ANNOUNCES A HUGE SOLAR PLANT AND A BREAKTHROUGH PRICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a move that took experts by surprise , Houston-based Enron Corp. , a giant energy developer , has proposed building the world ' s largest photovoltaic power_plant at the Energy_Department ' s Nevada Test Site , near Las Vegas . Equally unexpected , in an industry now producing electricity at a pricey 25 cents a kilowatt-hour , Enron says it will make power at 5.5 cents -- which would make power converted directly from sunlight competitive with fossil_fuel plants . &quot; If they are successful , they will have defined the photovoltaic market overnight , &quot; said Tony Catalano , director of photovoltaics at the Energy_Department ' s National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden , Colo. , the principal federal research_center for such solar technology . Photovoltaic cells , mostly formed from purified silicon sand , are one of two forms of solar-generated electricity . Such solar_cells have become commonplace above highway call_boxes , on hand-held calculators and in larger installations in remote locations . Solar thermal power , by contrast , is the technology that uses the sun to heat water , oil or liquid salt , which is then used in water_heaters or to run electricity-generating turbines . Photovoltaic cells have become steadily more efficient and cost-effective in recent years . But the price has remained well above the cost of electricity generated by conventional fuels or most other renewable sources of energy . So far , only about 400 megawatts of photovoltaic power-generating panels have been built at various sites around the world . Enron proposes building a 100-megawatt , $ 150-million plant at a single site on the former nuclear testing grounds , which the Energy_Department would like to turn_into a solar_power enterprise_zone . The firm wants the department to contract to buy the power at the 5.5-cent price , with a standard 3 % price escalator clause to include inflation , but with no federal subsidies . Analysts say there would be wide skepticism toward such a low-cost proposal if it came from a small start-up firm . But Enron is a highly experienced power_plant builder -- as well as the nation ' s biggest natural_gas provider -- and it has been studying the photovoltaic industry for the past year . &quot; We ' re not going_to lay the gauntlet down unless we can do_it , &quot; Robert Kelly , Enron executive_vice_president , told the Houston Business Journal , which broke the story last week . An Enron spokeswoman confirmed the plan Friday but declined to describe the company ' s technology in detail . &quot; There really hasn ' t been too_much officially announced about it , &quot; agreed Jim Birk , manager of renewables and hydro at the Palo Alto-based Electric_Power Research Institute , which oversees research and development for U.S. electric utilities . &quot; But the bottom_line is that you have a very credible organization with a strong history in the energy business putting forth this proposal. &quot;</TEXT>
