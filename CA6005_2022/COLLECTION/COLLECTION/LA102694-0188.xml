   <HEADLINE> LEAK IN SIBERIAN OIL FIELD TURNS INTO MASSIVE SPILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian officials confirmed Tuesday that a massive oil leak , possibly outstripping the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska , spread recently across northern Siberian bog land after aging pipelines ruptured and dikes holding_back the escaped oil gave_way under torrents of rain . Fuel and Energy Ministry spokesmen claimed that the 24-square-mile spill in the Komi region was_well under_control and largely cleaned_up , but top ecology officials flew off from Moscow to inspect the remote tundra , and Russian media accused the oil_company involved , Komineft , of a giant cover-up . &quot; Somewhere between 14 # 000 and 60 # 000 tons of oil were spilled , &quot; Ecology Ministry spokesman Alexander Shuvalov estimated . &quot; While I would n ' t term the accident a disaster at this point , I would certainly call this extraordinary and an emergency situation. &quot; The maximum Russian estimate of 60 # 000 tons would mean that about 18 million gallons of oil -- far more_than the 11 million released in the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 -- leaked into a similarly fragile environment . Villagers are reporting films of oil coating parts of nearby swamps and rivers , but the region is so remote and the difficulty of measuring the leaked oil so great that no exact figure on its volume has yet been set . Komineft claimed the total spill was less than 15 # 000 tons . In Washington , Energy_Department officials said they were formally notified by Russian leaders Tuesday afternoon that the spill amounted to about 13 # 700 tons of crude_oil -- about 40 % of the Exxon Valdez spill -- and would probably require U.S. emergency assistance . Deputy Energy_Secretary Bill White told reporters that an unnamed U.S. company working in the area had estimated the spill at 20 times that size , or about 274 # 000 tons . &quot; It is a significant spill . . . , whether it ' s 100 # 000 barrels or 2 million , &quot; said White , who characterized the result as a &quot; disaster &quot; for an environmentally fragile region and for a Russian industry increasingly plagued by shoddy standards and unmet needs . The U.S. firm working in the region told U.S. officials that the spill appeared to be six to seven miles long , about 13 yards wide and a yard deep . A film provided to the U.S. Energy_Department by Russian sources indicates that at some point earlier this year , someone on the scene set fire to the spill . In the film , thick black clouds of smoke can be seen billowing from a solid lake of crude_oil . According to the Moscow newspaper Izvestia , the U.S. oil_company Conoco , which works in an area nearby , sounded the alarm and Vice_President Al Gore offered emergency ecological aid for the region . &quot; You get the impression that Russian agencies responsible_for protecting the environment care more about their reputation in the eyes of the civilized world than the ecological safety of our territory , &quot; Izvestia complained . In fact , Russians may have been slow to react because such spills are extremely common in oil-rich regions of Siberia . Russian officials have estimated that 10 % of Siberia ' s oil_production may be lost to spills and leaks , amounting to millions of tons a year of Russia ' s best export . White said that Washington on Tuesday offered to dispatch a U.S. team to Russia , including experts from the Environmental Protection Agency , Coast Guard , Interior_Department and private firms specializing in the cleanup of oil spills . He said that Moscow had not yet responded to the offer . Basically a giant swamp the size of Western Europe , the Siberian oil region is as crucial to Earth ' s ecology as the rain_forests of the Amazon , ecologists say . Russian oil extraction remains environmentally shoddy , from the rusting pipelines that carry the oil to the careless workers who often overfill pools of waste near oil_wells . Environmentalists contended that the Siberian spill could have been as great as 200 # 000 tons ; Greenpeace activist Ivan Blokov said that the leak near the Komi town of Usinsk &quot; is unique because it is the first of such scale. &quot; Blokov said that oil had been leaking through 23 holes in a 30-mile stretch of old pipeline from late August until early September . Other reports said serious leaks began as far back as February . Workers built tall dikes to contain the escaped oil , Russian officials said , but the dikes were swept_away by torrential rains Oct . 1 . Millions of gallons of oil were released into two rivers that flow north into the Pechora River , which runs_into the Barents Sea . The Emergency Ministry claimed that a major containment and cleanup operation kept the Pechora from being badly affected by the spill , although spokeswoman Marina Ryklina said it did carry scattered spots of oil a yard or less in diameter . But the two Pechora tributaries most damaged , the Kolva and Usa , carried a three-inch-thick film of oil on their surfaces , the Itar-Tass news_agency said . White emphasized that a cleanup operation in Arctic conditions would probably be extremely difficult and virtually without precedent . The Pechora is expected to freeze solid within two weeks , at which point the oil could migrate slowly beneath the ice and into the Barents Sea . Temperatures fall below 50 degrees below zero , halting outdoor work . And the kinds of equipment needed for the task do not exist in the remote Arctic region . Officials said the polluted rivers have no villages on their banks , but Greenpeace reported that an oil_slick between one and five yards wide runs near the village of Ust-Usa . Siberia ' s oil-rich regions are home to many native peoples who survive by hunting and fishing . When a river dies , they must move_on . The salmon and shorebirds that use the Arctic_Ocean ' s sprawling network of wetlands , however , will have more difficulty moving_out of the spill ' s way . Those form the base of the food_chain for the larger beasts that inhabit and migrate through the Arctic and its waters , according to the Washington-based Center for Marine Conservation , an environmental watchdog group . In the Exxon Valdez disaster , the worst oil spill in U.S. history , the tanker ran_aground and spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound . Russian officials estimated the damage of the Usinsk spill at about $ 100 million . Times staff writer Melissa Healy in Washington and Sergei L . Loiko of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
