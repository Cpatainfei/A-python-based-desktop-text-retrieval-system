   <HEADLINE> BATTLE LOOMS ON CHEMICALS THAT DISRUPT HORMONES ; SCIENCE : RESEARCH FINDS THREATS AT LEVELS ONCE THOUGHT SAFE . CLEANUP OF DDT OFF PALOS VERDES IS PART OF DEBATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After waiting nearly two decades to cleanse their lake-shore harbor of a_million pounds of toxic_waste , the people of this working-class suburb of Chicago were ready to party . Setting sail on Lake_Michigan aboard a cruise_ship aptly named Celebration , local , state and federal dignitaries proclaimed the elaborate $ 21-million cleanup of Waukegan Harbor officially complete this summer . The marina -- for years stigmatized as the PCB contamination capital of the world -- was declared safe for everyone who works and plays there . But the celebration may have come too soon . Compelling new scientific evidence has emerged indicating that low concentrations of pesticides and industrial chemicals once thought to be harmless can alter the hormones of wild animals , confusing their sexual identities and rendering them infertile . The threat from these decades-old chemicals -- most notably massive amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) in the Great Lakes and DDT off the shore of Los Angeles -- has stoked a long-smoldering environmental debate : How clean is clean ? For years , how much pollution to remove from severely contaminated spots has been based largely on a single target -- reducing the cancer risk to humans . But that may_not be enough to defend bald_eagles , trout , alligators and other animals from chemicals that imitate estrogen or block testosterone in the womb . Humans who eat contaminated fish and other food harvested from these areas also could be passing subtle reproductive problems such_as low sperm_counts to their children . &quot; In spite of government regulations and testing -- which we all thought was adequate in all honesty -- we are now finding effects that are much more subtle and much more intergenerational than we thought , &quot; said Tim Gross , a University of Florida endocrinologist who discovered part-male , part-female alligators and turtles in a Florida lake contaminated with DDT from a 1980 spill . The concern over environmental hormones comes at a crucial time . In Southern California , federal_officials are grappling with how to eliminate -- or more likely contain -- 4 million pounds of the pesticide DDT dumped several decades ago in ocean waters off the Palos Verdes Peninsula . Nationally , dozens of waterways from Washington ' s Puget Sound to South Florida ' s canals remain polluted with PCBs , compounds used as industrial insulators and lubricators , or DDT , even though they were banned in the United States in the 1970s . &quot; We have to address this enormous legacy , &quot; said Michael Gilbertson , a biologist with the International Joint Commission , a U.S.-Canadian government panel helping guide cleanup of the Great Lakes . &quot; How are we going_to come_to terms with all these dump sites ? What this work_on estrogens shows us is we have a very long way to go. &quot; Eliminating the potential for hormone-like effects is shaping_up to be a political struggle . The cost of even a basic cleanup job runs in the tens of millions of dollars and the projects take years . Expanding the scope to tackle lower concentrations of chemicals would push the price up and take even more time . Beyond that , raising new health and ecological concerns could cast a pall on a community ' s businesses and recreation , especially sport fishing . &quot; It ' s a legitimate question to ask how much it is going_to cost and what are the benefits , &quot; said John McCarthy , vice_president for science and regulatory affairs at the American Crop Protection Assn. , which represents Dow , Monsanto and other major pesticide producers . &quot; I know it ' s not popular to talk_about economics when you ' re talking_about health risks , but you ' ve got_to get real too. &quot; Dealing with the legacies of the past , however , is only one contentious aspect of the battle emerging over environmental hormones . To avoid saddling future generations with new problems , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the chemical_industry are wrestling with whether to restrict some of today ' s chemicals . About 25 popular insecticides , herbicides and fungicides -- applied on millions of acres every year in the United States -- have been shown in laboratory tests to imitate estrogen or inhibit testosterone . Included are many pesticides , such_as atrazine , endosulfan , EBDCs , parathion and dicofol , that help farmers protect and grow bountiful harvests of fruits , vegetables , grains and other crops worth billions of dollars annually . Some also are widely used for eliminating garden pests and weeds . Seven industrial compounds -- such_as nonylphenol , used in plastics and detergents ; styrene , an ingredient of rubber ; and dioxins , a widely dispersed pollutant from paper_mills and other manufacturing_plants -- are suspected of causing problems as well . &quot; One of the lessons we learned from DDT is that it is very hard to correct an error once you make_it , &quot; said Dr. Lynn Goldman , assistant EPA administrator , who heads the Office of Prevention , Pesticides and Toxic Substances . &quot; If you allow the use of a harmful compound . . . even after you take corrective action , you can see harmful effects for many years. &quot; Several environmental groups already are demanding a phaseout of chlorinated pesticides and other compounds , many of which are identified as man-made hormones . But manufacturers are urging the government to await clear scientific findings , which could take the National Academy of Sciences several years . &quot; There is a fair amount of advocacy science going_on out there on this subject , and a lot of dueling Ph.Ds. Let ' s take_a_look at the science and do this right , &quot; said McCarthy of the crop association . This fall , the EPA plans to propose new rules requiring manufacturers to test pesticides to determine their potential for disrupting the endocrine_system that controls hormones , Goldman said . For example , manufacturers may have to check the testosterone of exposed rodents , or use a newly developed method of checking whether breast_cancer cells , which are sensitive to estrogen , grow in test_tubes when exposed to a pesticide . But when it comes_to non-pesticide chemicals -- including some used in plastics -- the government has much less authority , Goldman said . Under federal law , the EPA must first prove a chemical poses a likely public health risk before companies can be ordered to enhance testing . That , Goldman said , is a Catch-22 that could allow most industrial chemicals that alter hormones to escape tougher restrictions . &quot; We don ' t have a very good ability to predict which chemicals are likely to be endocrine disrupters , &quot; said Goldman , a former California epidemiologist and pediatrician . &quot; That puts us at a great disadvantage . There are 70 # 000 chemicals on the inventory and of those , about 18 # 000 are of potential concern because they are in commerce to a significant extent. &quot; Today ' s pesticides must be screened by their manufacturers on laboratory mice to gauge their risk of cancer , birth_defects and reproductive effects . But they are not subjected_to specific tests detecting hormonal changes . &quot; Things can slip through the net , &quot; Goldman said , &quot; and one of those things that can easily slip through are endocrine disrupters. &quot; Each pesticide undergoes a &quot; two-generation reproduction study , &quot; which exposes rats to various doses of chemicals in their food and then examines the offspring , and their offspring . But chemical_industry officials acknowledge that the test is not sensitive enough to detect all troubling side_effects . For instance , in the case of a fungicide named vinclozolin , tests by the manufacturers , BASF Corp . and Grace-Sierra Crop Protection , did not discern reproductive defects in rats . But when the EPA performed more thorough tests , it found that the fungicide blocks the formation of testosterone in rodents and that offspring were born with half-male , half-female sex_organs . Toxicologist Chris Chaisson of TAS Inc. , which designs tests for chemical manufacturers , said traditional two-generation studies often cannot detect malformed genitalia because the rats are exposed to fairly low doses of chemicals . She said the search for more reliable methods &quot; is a huge issue internationally. &quot; After testing pesticides , the EPA decides on a case-by-case basis whether the risk is great enough to impose new restrictions -- &quot; from changing instructions about how they are used all_the way to suspension and cancellation , &quot; Goldman said . Manufacturers say they will not oppose new testing requirements . But they are bracing for battle if such tests lead to new bans or severe restrictions on chemicals that they say are necessary to protect the nation ' s food supply from pests and weeds . &quot; This is not like a situation where we have to shut whole industries down because something terrible is happening to the environment , &quot; McCarthy said . &quot; It doesn ' t mean that we should be insensitive , and it doesn ' t mean we shouldn ' t be vigilant . But I don ' t think the environment is unraveling. &quot; Some pesticides have been indicted as hormone disrupters on the basis of results in test_tubes or , as in the case of vinclozolin , fairly large doses fed to mice . But the true test , said pesticide industry consultant James Lamb , is to learn if the chemicals harm people or animals in amounts now in the environment , and if the risk is great enough to outweigh the benefits . &quot; Just because something causes a problem in a test_tube doesn ' t mean it poses a significant risk , &quot; said Lamb , a reproductive toxicologist formerly with the EPA . &quot; That kind of test is very limited. &quot; While a ban on all hormone disrupters is highly unlikely , some could face new restrictions or reformulation . &quot; We ' re not going_to get_rid_of pesticides or plastics in our society , &quot; said David Crews , a zoologist at the University of Texas , Austin . &quot; We will not allow loss of our quality_of_life . So we need to find_out how to deactivate them or contain them so they don ' t have these impacts. &quot; Generally , wildlife experts and industry agree on one point : No chemicals used today are as dangerous as DDT and PCBs , which accumulate in the environment and in body tissues and can reach poisonous levels . &quot; The new chemicals are entirely different , &quot; said McCarthy of the pesticide industry group . &quot; Most are biodegradable . that ' s going_to be a key difference in this whole debate. &quot; Although many of the nation ' s waterways have improved since the banning of DDT and PCBs , wildlife officials say buildup in many harbors , rivers and other hot spots remains severe enough to maim , kill or sterilize wild animals , especially fish-eating birds . Along many Great Lakes ' shorelines , bald_eagles -- a threatened species -- still fail to reproduce and some cormorants are born with malformed , twisted beaks . Beyond the political and financial ramifications , performing adequate cleanup has proved to be technically difficult . In the case of Waukegan Harbor -- on the nation ' s Superfund list of toxic sites named priorities for cleanup -- the EPA took 12 years to reach agreement with Outboard Marine Corp . to pay_for removing 1 million pounds of PCBs the boat manufacturer had dumped into the lake in the 1960s . It took_five more years for the agency to design a strategy , remove and treat some waste , and bury the rest in a boat slip walled off from the rest of Lake_Michigan . Despite the $ 21-million effort -- which the EPA says removed 96 % of the PCBs -- a sister federal agency , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , maintains that the water is at least 100 times too contaminated to safeguard fish and birds , including some endangered and threatened species . &quot; A safe level of contamination ? We ' re light-years away from that in any of the Great Lakes , &quot; said David Best , a biologist for the wildlife agency ' s Midwestern region who is exploring the impact of Great Lakes contamination on bald_eagles . &quot; There is no biologist that would say ( Waukegan ) harbor is clean enough to ensure the health of fish and wildlife. &quot; The EPA allowed PCBs to remain in the harbor ' s sediments in concentrations as high as 50 parts per million , far greater than the 4 p.p.m. that kills a bald_eagle ' s eggs . The Fish and Wildlife Service recommended cleaning the harbor to a_level of 0.05 p.p.m. , but the EPA rejected that option as impractical . &quot; A lot of times EPA and state regulatory_agencies feel if they get_it up_to human health standards , that ' s enough for wildlife , &quot; said Donald Steffeck , chief of contaminants for the wildlife service ' s western region . &quot; But those cormorants or ospreys or eagles are out there 100 % of the time eating those fish. &quot; Returning to Waukegan Harbor to dredge more waste is considered unlikely , given the realities of money , politics and public sentiments . Local residents generally are pleased and their harbor is more popular than ever because the water looks dramatically cleaner after the dredging and PCB concentrations have dropped . &quot; Nobody worries about PCBs anymore , &quot; said one local Coast Guard auxiliary officer . &quot; People just don ' t want to know the truth , &quot; said Charles Facemire , an environmental toxicologist with the wildlife agency . &quot; It scares the pants off them , especially this issue of endocrine disruption and how your children could be born with reproductive problems. &quot; Gilbertson of the International Joint Commission said the EPA and state regulators overseeing cleanups have been &quot; terribly slow &quot; in realizing that potential reproductive damage to wildlife and people is important when setting cleanup goals . The EPA is much more focused on reducing human cancer risk from eating fish and on the outright mortality of animals . &quot; If the only consideration was to protect wildlife , that ( harbor cleanup ) would not be enough , &quot; said John Giesy , a Michigan State University fisheries and wildlife professor . &quot; But that was purely a societal decision , a risk management decision . EPA felt it was a decision they could live with. &quot; Goldman , one of the highest-ranking officials at the EPA , acknowledges that her agency should focus more on protecting the health of natural_resources when regulating chemicals and cleaning_up toxic_waste . But she blames the failing on a need for better science to predict ecological impacts . &quot; The criticism is well-taken , &quot; she said . &quot; In the absence of better tools , we go_with the things we do know , like cancer . What is new is this general recognition of the connection between risks to wildlife and the risk to human health. &quot; Goldman warned , however , that excavating old pollutants such_as DDT and PCBs from the bottom of waterways sometimes can lead to more contamination of the fish . &quot; It may be that the best possible thing is to leave them buried , &quot; she said . When it comes_to tackling these hormone-disrupting pollutants , the nation ' s most massive problem lies_in Los Angeles ' own back yard . From 1950 to 1970 , DDT manufacturer Montrose Chemical Corp . of Torrance dumped several million pounds of the pesticide into county sewers that flow into the ocean off the Palos Verdes Peninsula . Due_to a human cancer threat , warnings already have been posted on the peninsula and at Los Angeles Harbor advising against eating croaker and other fish caught close to shore . Their eggs poisoned by DDT , populations of brown pelicans , eagles and other birds plunged in the 1970s . Although most now appear to be recovering , scientists say fish and wildlife still are suffering some lingering reproductive effects . Specific scientific evidence of the damage , however , has been kept confidential by U.S. Justice_Department attorneys , who are suing Montrose and other industries to seek compensation for wildlife and habitat losses . The federal_government is soon expected to announce a proposal for restoring the coastal resources that is bound to be costly . Today , no one wants to repeat the mistakes that left such enduring environmental dilemmas . &quot; Industry has suffered greatly from DDT and other things that have come_back to haunt them , &quot; said Glen Fox , a Canadian government biologist who has studied the impacts of Great Lakes pollution for two decades . &quot; They cannot afford to ignore a problem with a chemical that could affect your reproduction or your children ' s reproduction . They are so scared spitless of that sort of thing . If there was ever an issue industry would probably act_on , it ' s this one. &quot; Anatomy of a Cleanup Cleaning_up Waukegan Harbor , on Lake_Michigan 35 miles north of Chicago , illustrates the difficulty of handling sites contaminated with toxic chemicals . After years of dumping by Outboard Marine Corp. , the harbor had the worst contamination from polychlorinated biphenyls , or PCBs , in the United States . The $ 21-million cleanup , a high priority in the Superfund program , began in 1988 and was completed in 1993 . Here is a look_at how the process was accomplished . 1 . One million pounds of PCB-laced sediment and soil were dredged from Slip 3 -- the main source of PCBs in the harbor -- as well as Crescent Ditch and North Ditch . 2 . The materials were pumped into a holding pond and dried in West Containment Cell . 3 . Almost 13 # 000 tons were cooked at high_temperatures in a mobile processor at the West Containment Cell that separated the PCBs from the sediment and concentrated them the PCBs in an oil-based liquid . The liquid was hauled to an incinerator in Texas . 4 . Slip 3 was turned_into a huge containment cell to permanently hold untreated soils and sediments dredged from the harbor . The idea is to prevent lake water from flowing in . SLIP 3 CONTAINMENT CELL * A 290-foot cutoff wall was built at the mouth of the slip to cut it off from the rest of the harbor . The wall consists_of two steel sheets 20 feet apart and anchored 7 feet deep into the clay layer . * A large slurry wall , 3 feet thick , was connected to the cutoff wall to enclose the remainder of Slip 3 . * An underwater layer of hard , silty clay was added between the steel sheets . * Steel braces were placed every 30 feet along the wall . * A rock berm was constructed diagonally to the cutoff wall , extending 40 feet along the floor of the harbor . 5 . Hydraulic dredging removed 32 # 000 cubic_yards of contaminated sediments from the upper harbor floor . The material was pumped into an intake pipe and discharged into the containment cell at Slip 3 . 6 . Two smaller containment cells were built to permanently hold wastes from the North Ditch and the treated sediment from the mobile cooking process . 7 . Water in the cells was continuously monitored by wells . A water-treatment plant was built to clean any polluted water extracted from the cells . 8 . A new boat slip was constructed in the harbor to replace the old one . 9 . Once the sediments settle , Slip 3 will be sealed . Disruptive Potential About 45 pesticides and industrial chemicals disrupt hormones in laboratory tests , which means they have the potential to cause reproductive disorders in wildlife or people .
