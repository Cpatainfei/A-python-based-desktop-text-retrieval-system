   <HEADLINE> PARENTS PUSH FOR IMPROVED SCHOOL SAFETY ; VIOLENCE : THE SLAYING OF ONE STUDENT IN SIMI VALLEY AND WOUNDING OF THREE IN THOUSAND OAKS PROMPT DEMANDS FOR ADDED SECURITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wake of two incidents of after-school violence that left one student dead in Simi Valley and three wounded in Thousand Oaks this past week , alarmed parents and students are crying_out_for new measures to boost school safety . Simi Valley officials are rushing to form a task_force that will suggest new safety measures for the district and particularly Valley View Junior_High , where police said 14-year-old Chad Hubbard was stabbed to death Tuesday by 13-year-old Phillip Hernandez . And Thousand Oaks officials are responding to the shooting of three Westlake High students in a melee Thursday by pushing ahead with the recommendations of recently formed school safety committees . Stricter discipline , additional security cameras , an increased parent presence at the schools , and even tougher dress codes are among the new approaches being considered in the two cities . As Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks school officials grapple with possible solutions to school violence , they are tracing steps covered by officials at western Ventura County schools , which have a longer history of schoolyard shootings and stabbings . Campus violence prompted Oxnard last year to use hand-held metal detectors for random searches of high_school students , and Ventura educators set_up a telephone hot_line for students to anonymously report on classmates carrying weapons . By expelling dozens of students caught with knives and guns over the past two years , school administrators in Ventura and Oxnard have put pupils on notice about the consequences of carrying weapons . Experts on school safety say Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks have lagged behind the west county in aggressively working to avert school violence . &quot; We have the perception that we don ' t have the problem here , &quot; said Ronald Stephens , executive_director of the National School Safety Center , a federally funded agency based in Westlake . &quot; It ' s a denial-type mode. &quot; The denial was fed , Stephens said , by Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks being named in recent years as two of the safest U . S . cities with populations of more_than 100 # 000 . But the stunning news of the stabbing death at a Simi Valley junior_high sobered many parents , who turned hostile when school officials sought to defuse concern by repeatedly referring to the slaying as &quot; an isolated incident. &quot; At a public forum Thursday night crammed with hundreds of agitated parents , Simi Valley Supt . Mary Beth Wolford and other school officials were shouted_down by residents demanding action from the district . And parent Glenn Woodbury announced Friday that he and other residents are forming a group called Safety for Our Students that will work separately from the district ' s task_force . &quot; We want something that parents can have control over , &quot; Woodbury said . Simi Valley school officials acknowledged last week that educators and parents shared a complacency about the threat of big-city violence reaching their school grounds . Last year , after a student at Reseda High_School in the San Fernando Valley was killed on campus , some parents in eastern Simi Valley briefly became anxious that the violence would spill into their city , Parks said . But when Simi Valley High_School responded to the concerns by holding a meeting on school safety , only about five people showed_up , Parks said . &quot; that ' s a good_example of denial. &quot; In Thousand Oaks , school officials disagreed_with Stephens ' contention that the community has ignored the threat of campus violence . &quot; The district is_well aware of violence within our community , &quot; said Richard Simpson , assistant superintendent of the Conejo Valley Unified School District . &quot; We ' ve seen increasing violence in our community coming for some time. &quot; Simpson noted the shooting of the Westlake High students occurred off campus and after school . Students David Behling , Scott Smith and Jarad Kline were shot at noon Thursday just outside Thousand Oaks ' North Ranch Park , where the three youths and about a dozen friends had gathered to watch a planned fistfight between a junior football_player and a sophomore at the school . Police said the violence occurred after the sophomore arrived with several carloads of older youths , one of whom then opened_fire on friends of the football_player . Police said Friday that many of the youths in the cars were not Westlake High students . Before the shooting , the Conejo Valley school district had formed school safety committees at each of the district ' s 26 schools , Simpson said . Some of the committees have already made recommendations for improving security on school grounds , including purchasing new camcorders and portable telephones for use by school officials . But Simpson said he does not see that school officials could have done anything differently to avert Thursday ' s violence . School officials had already tried to end the long-running feud between the sophomore and junior Curtis Simmons , whose planned fistfight led to the bloodshed . Both boys were suspended after a fistfight last year . When rumors circulated recently that the two were planning to face_off again , officials called the students into the school office and warned them against violence . School administrators also searched both boys ' lockers when they heard rumors that one had obtained a gun . But the searches turned_up nothing . Simpson said parents can help educators curb violence on campus by taking a more active role in their children ' s activities . &quot; What we need is a much more aggressive response from our community and from parents , &quot; he said . Parents and community members also were called_upon to get more involved in Ventura schools last year after Ventura High_School football_player Jesse Strobel was knifed to death in downtown Ventura on a Friday evening . Like the shooting of the Westlake High_School students , Strobel ' s slaying occurred off campus and after school hours . But Ventura school officials , nevertheless , treated the incident as a school issue . Ventura educators cracked_down on students carrying weapons , expelling 13 students in the first five months of the program . In January , a new state law began requiring schools to expel students caught with weapons . Ventura has pursued the policy aggressively , setting_up a telephone hot_line for anonymous tips and encouraging students to help look_out for campus safety . Ventura officials said they believe their strict approach has caught the attention of students . So far this school_year , the district has expelled three students for possessing weapons and four other cases are pending . Ventura school officials also added new security_guards to each of the high_school campuses . And this year , Ventura school Supt . Joseph Spirito has launched a sweeping character-development program to teach moral values such_as tolerance and patience . Despite these measures , an 18-year-old Buena High_School student was stabbed by a 17-year-old classmate in a scuffle in the school parking_lot a_few months after Strobel ' s death . Buena High_School Principal Jaime Castellanos said when he heard about the Westlake High_School shooting he was reminded of past violence at his school . &quot; I got_to thinking again , ' My God . that ' s the kind of thing that can happen anytime , anywhere , anyplace , ' &quot; he said . The Oxnard Union High_School District has come_down even harder than Ventura on students who carry weapons to campus . In addition to expelling students caught with knives or guns , the district ' s five high_schools in Oxnard and Camarillo use metal detectors to conduct random weapons searches in two classes per school each day . Oxnard High_School Principal Rick Rezinas credited the weapons searches with helping to reduce violence among students and creating a more secure atmosphere on campus . &quot; The key difference is that we ' re trying to solve problems before they happen , &quot; he said . &quot; The metal detectors are part of that . The kids feel that someone cares about their safety. &quot; Oxnard High_School has not always been peaceful . In 1991 , the school was rocked by a riot when dozens of black and Latino students at the school , some wielding chains and pipes , came_to blows . And another Oxnard district school -- Channel Islands High -- was the last site of a schoolyard slaying before the stabbing in Simi Valley last week . In November , 1989 , Manuel ( Deadeye ) Rodriguez shouted gang slogans outside the high_school and was shot to death by Arnel Salagubang , a member of a rival gang . Despite the success of weapons searches at Oxnard schools , most other county school districts are reluctant to go_to that length to combat violence . Thousand Oaks officials said they already have metal detectors on high_school campuses but use them only when they have reason to believe a student is carrying a knife or gun . And Simi Valley officials did not include the use of metal detectors among the list of safety measures they are considering for their schools .</TEXT>
