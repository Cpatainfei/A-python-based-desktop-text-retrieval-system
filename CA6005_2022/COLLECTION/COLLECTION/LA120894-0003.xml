   <TEXT> Why give a boring old sweater when the stores are_full of delicious things to sate the appetite of even the finickiest person on your shopping list ? A few of our favorite ideas follow . The numbered items are pictured on the cover . 1 ) BOTTLED PLEASURES Francesco Ferretti ' s family was pressing olives long before he was born . Now Ferretti is following in the family tradition , harvesting the mature olives grown on his family ' s 500-acre farm in Cori , Italy , then cold-pressing the crop within five to six hours . Previously , the imported Pietra Pinta olive_oil was only sold wholesale to top Italian restaurants ( Valentino and Rex among them ) , but now you can pick_up a three-quarter-liter bottle for less than $ 15 at Bristol Farms in South Pasadena , Rolling Hills Estates or Manhattan Beach , and at Broadway Deli in Santa Monica . It ' s a pretty impressive present . 2 ) GO_FISH Tired of forking out big bucks for so-so smoked salmon ? At American Fish &amp; Seafood ( 550 Ceres Ave. , Los Angeles , ( 213 ) 612-0350 ) , a wholesaler , processor and distributor of fish from all_over the world , you get smoked farm-raised Norwegian salmon -- the kind that top restaurants use -- for $ 11.95 a pound . At most other places , this salmon , hot-smoked in the traditional European manner , sells for more_than twice that . 3 ) YULE_LOG In France , it isn ' t Christmas without buche de Noe l , a rich concoction of sponge_cake rolled into the shape of a log , frosted with chocolate butter cream and decorated with meringue mushrooms and marzipan elves . At Xiomara ( 69 N . Raymond , Pasadena , ( 818 ) 796-2520 ) , chef Patrick Healy is baking the festive cakes for the holidays . Order Healy ' s chocolate-hazelnut creation with vanilla custard sauce in small ( $ 24 , serves 6 ) or large ( $ 35 , serves 10 ) . 4 ) SWEETENED GREETINGS Three cousins from Louisiana -- Norwood Clark , Ronald Washington and Darryl Banks -- run Uncle Darrow ' s Eatery ( 5301 Venice Blvd. , Los Angeles , ( 213 ) 938-4293 ) where they ' ve been dishing_up jambalaya , catfish and file gumbo for the past six years . Their real specialty , however , is Cajun &quot; pa-cawn &quot; candy made from an old family recipe ; it tastes like a cross between fudge and a praline . The candy comes_in three sizes ; a large packet of the candy costs $ 10 and can be mail-ordered . The cousins also make excellent , buttery &quot; karamel &quot; popcorn ( $ 1.50 ) and individual sweet &quot; tater &quot; pies ( $ 1.50 ) . 5 ) JAMMIN ' Marmalade lovers have three terrific reasons to celebrate this holiday season : lemon , orange and grapefruit . At Sunny Springs Ranch in Fontana , Phil and April Valvo and daughter Shannon make low-sugar marmalades and jams using natural pectin and the organic fruit grown on their five-acre ranch . The whole property is fed by two natural_springs . &quot; The more fruit I can put_in , &quot; says April , &quot; the better. &quot; The marmalades and jams are available in three sizes ( four ounces , $ 3 ; eight ounces , $ 5 ; 16 ounces , $ 8 ) and are sold at local farmers markets ( Torrance , Hollywood , Calabasas , Encino , Westchester ) or by mail . For information , call ( 909 ) 822-5417 . 6 ) SMALL PACKAGES Christmas without tamales ? Not in Mexico . And not in Culver City , either . that ' s where Belgian-trained Pascal Dropsy ( by night the chef at St . Mark ' s in Venice ) makes tamales with his wife , Shirley Coriz , an American_Indian who has been making traditional tamales since she was a little_girl growing_up on the Santo Domingo Pueblo in New Mexico . Of course , these aren ' t ordinary tamales . With his chef ' s training and her family expertise , they ' ve come_up with some unique combinations -- and they ' ve managed it without using lard . Green chile and smoked Gouda ; chicken and mango-habanero ; black tiger shrimp with pineapple and chipotle sauce ; beef carnitas ; and Belgian chocolate with raspberries and pecans are a_few of the 16 choices . &quot; I came_up with the different fillings , &quot; says Dropsy , &quot; but Shirley taught me the traditional method and how to tie them. &quot; Their Corn Maiden Co . tamales ( 12102 Summertime Lane , Culver City , ( 310 ) 202-6180 ) run between $ 22 and $ 33 a dozen . They are available for take-out or by mail_order . And with two days ' notice , the tamales will be delivered to your door with steaming and microwave instructions . 7 ) BETTER THAN MISTLETOE A wreath to whet the appetite . And it only takes a_few minutes to whip_up . Braids of locally grown garlic ( $ 14 and $ 20 ) are available from Lori ' s Herbs at local farmers markets ( Thousand Oaks , Santa Monica , Encino ) ; the chiles and rosemary can be bought_at any farmers market or nursery . Tie on a red bow and hang it in your kitchen for Christmas . When the holidays are over , use the rosemary branches to flavor your favorite dishes : Dried chiles arbol make great salsa ; the garlic is a year ' s supply of goodness . 8 ) THE GIFT OF GAB Cucina magazine was intended for the restaurant trade to promote Italian food and wine culture in America . But the glossy bimonthly color magazine has become so newsy and gossipy that it ' s worth subscribing to if you love Italian food . Try_out chefs ' recipes , listen to them gripe , and be up_on their events . A one-year subscription is $ 18 . Write Datatex Corp. , 120 E . 41st St. , New York , N.Y. 10164-2263 . Or call ( 212 ) 338-0362 . SAY GORGONZOLA What could be more versatile than a hunk of creamy , blue-veined Gorgonzola ? It makes a good sauce on pasta , works well in salad_dressings , melts nicely in hot_potato skins and is a fine topping for grilled steak . Best of all , it makes a lovely end to a meal , served with pears and walnuts . Some of the best ( $ 6.25 for a half pound ) can be found at Say Cheese ( 2800 Hyperion Ave. , Los Angeles , ( 213 ) 665-0545 ) , an upscale food boutique crammed with imported cheeses , La Brea Bakery breads , coffee_beans , flavored oils and vinegars , crackers and imported chocolates . MERRY MEAT After Christmas_Eve services in Germany , families often return home and drink tall flutes of Weissbier and feast on soft_pretzels and Munchener Weisswurst -- fat , fluffy sausages that are simmered and then slathered with sweet whole-grain mustard . At Atlas Sausage Kitchen ( 10626 Burbank Blvd. , North Hollywood , ( 818 ) 763-2692 ) , sausage maker Michael Obermayer makes Munchener Weisswurst ( $ 4.69 per pound ) the old-fashioned way , using carefully hand-trimmed veal flavored with cream , parsley , mace and other spices . You ' ll also find other delicious hand-crafted sausages , cold cuts and smoked meat at this 50-year-old shop . Just don ' t ask the Santa look-alike wurst maker for apple sausage or other gourmet-types . &quot; I ' m in the meat business , &quot; huffs Obermayer , &quot; not the produce business. &quot; GARDEN GROOMING It was the contents of the walk-in refrigerator at Abiquiu , chef John Sedlar ' s Santa Monica restaurant , that inspired Sedlar and former hairdresser Philip Berkovitz to create the Philip B . line of hair and skin-care products available exclusively at Neiman Marcus nationwide . All the products contain high concentrations of food and plant extracts . The white truffle shampoo ( $ 42.50 for eight ounces ) was developed in Sedlar ' s kitchen using an infusion of Italian white truffle oil , fresh lemon_rind and fresh thyme . The carrot conditioning creme ( $ 44.50 for eight ounces ) , which contains 25 % carrot extract ( most plant-based hair products contain up_to 4 % ) , really does make the hair smell like fresh-picked carrots . Carrots never cost so_much , but hair may never have smelled so good . COOKIE CRUNCH From the man who does great things with the lowly potato , now comes biscotti . You can pick_up a small sack of these twice-baked cookies at Patinette ( 250 S . Grand Ave. , Los Angeles , ( 213 ) 626-1178 ) , Joachim Splichal ' s upscale snack_bar at the Museum of Contemporary Art . Choose from chocolate , cinnamon and pistachio , and baklava . Six of the crunchy cookies are packed in a cellophane bag tied with a sprig of pine and a holiday ribbon . They ' re buttery , rich -- and only $ 3 . STOCKING STUFFER Garlic tastes great and is good_for_you too . On the other hand , peeling cloves by hand can be monotonous if you ' re cooking for a crowd . Now there is a tool to do the yucky part of the job : the E-Z-Rol garlic peeler , a simple , flexible tube , originally designed to aid the handicapped and made from an FDA-approved material that looks and feels_like something between neoprene and a vintage rubber girdle . Insert a clove or two in the tube , press_down firmly and roll it back and forth with the palm of your hand until you hear a crinkly sound . Best of all , the tool also peels roasted chestnuts , easing what may be among the most painful kitchen jobs during the holidays . The peeler costs about $ 6.25 and is available at Christopher Ranch ( 2208 Glendale Galleria , Glendale , ( 818 ) 637-2813 ) . MORNING JOLTS See Dick roast coffee . See Jane blend tea . Dick and Jane Healy own the Coffee Roaster ( 13567 Ventura Blvd. , Sherman Oaks , ( 818 ) 905-9719 ) , a mecca for coffee and tea fanatics . For the beverage connoisseurs on your gift list , try a pound or two of espresso blend ( half Sumatra Mandheling and half Ethiopian Harrar ) , or some of Jane ' s Welsh breakfast blend of smoky Keemun with long-leaf Assam . Espresso roast is $ 9 a pound ; the Welsh breakfast blend , $ 14 a pound .</TEXT>
