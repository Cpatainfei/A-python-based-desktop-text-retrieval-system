   <HEADLINE> MICROSOFT ' S GATES REVEALED AS LEONARDO ' S MYSTERY BUYER ; AUCTION : PURCHASE OF CODEX HAMMER CREATES A NEW ROLE FOR COMPUTER_INDUSTRY GIANT . THE MANUSCRIPT WILL BE DISPLAYED IN ITALY PRIOR TO A WORLD TOUR , AN AIDE SAID .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Microsoft Corp . Chairman Bill Gates was identified Saturday as the anonymous buyer of an illustrated manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci that sold at auction for a record $ 30.8 million . Gates ' purchase on Friday of the scientific manuscript by the Italian Renaissance master has created a new role for the computer_industry giant , several art experts said . Formerly known to the museum world as a champion of digitized images -- and something of a threat to the integrity of original artworks -- he is now cast as the American savior of a rare , 72-page document , laboriously written and illustrated by an artist ' s hand . Gates , 39 , who was listed this year by Forbes magazine as the nation ' s richest_man , with assets of $ 9.2 billion , could not be reached for comment , but Microsoft spokeswoman Mich Matthews said Saturday that Gates plans to display the manuscript in Italy for one year and then send it on a worldwide tour of museums . If those plans develop , Gates also will likely emerge as a public-spirited supporter of a unique , hand-made treasure that predates computer_technology by four centuries . Leonardo ' s vast scientific treatise , known as the Codex Hammer , was sold at Christie ' s New York auction_house on behalf of the UCLA / Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center . The museum was founded in 1990 by Hammer , the late chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp. , and the university took_over its management in April . Museum officials consigned the valuable document to auction to establish a reserve_fund as a hedge against potential legal expenses incurred by Hammer ' s estate . Christie ' s had estimated the value of the Leonardo at over $ 10 million . Hammer purchased it in 1980 at a London auction for the then-record price of $ 5.62 million . Immediately following the Friday morning sale , Christie ' s identified the buyer only as an anonymous private collector . The Seattle Post-Intelligencer later disclosed that the new owner is Gates , whose computer software empire is based in the Seattle suburb of Redmond . Representatives of the UCLA / Hammer Museum greeted Gates ' purchase as an auspicious development . &quot; that ' s good news , &quot; museum director Henry T . Hopkins said . &quot; And it makes perfect sense . There ' s a certain logic to a scientific whiz being interested in a scientific manuscript. &quot; Hopkins also praised Gates ' reported plans to make the document available to the public . &quot; He may find pleasure in having it out and about . I would hope so , &quot; Hopkins said . Museum trustee Eli Broad also welcomed the news . &quot; It ' s a good thing , &quot; Broad said . &quot; I ' m delighted that the manuscript will stay in the United States , and that it will not go_to Seoul or even to Italy , or get hidden away in a vault in Switzerland. &quot; Prior to the sale , Christie ' s had taken the manuscript on_tour to Milan , Zurich , Seoul and Tokyo , leading to speculation that the buyer would be from a foreign country . The under-bidder at the auction was Milan ' s Cariplo Foundation , which is backed by one of Italy ' s largest banks . The news created something of a sensation in Gates ' hometown . &quot; This bodes well for Seattle , &quot; Mary Gardner Neill , director of the Seattle Art Museum said in a telephone_interview . &quot; I haven ' t talked to Bill Gates , but we hope that the manuscript will go_on public view . I will do everything I can to see that it is displayed at our museum at the earliest possible date. &quot; Gates became known in the art world as an adversarial figure in the mid-1980s when his representatives began to approach museums in an effort to buy reproduction rights to artworks for an immense digital image bank . The use of the images had not been determined , leading museum professionals to worry that selling reproduction rights to Gates would lead to a plethora of undignified art images on coffee_mugs , T-shirts and shower_curtains . Although Gates only sought to buy non-exclusive reproduction rights , museum officials also feared that his enterprise would diminish the income that art museums receive from selling one-time reproduction rights to works in their collections . The issue became such a hot topic of discussion that the Assn . of Art Museum Directors staged its annual meeting in Seattle last June and featured Gates as keynote speaker . In his speech , Gates told the directors that technology is a fact of life with which they would have to deal . But he also attempted to allay fears that digital reproductions will replace museum audiences with mouse potatoes who only look_at art on computer_screens . Some of these concerns dissipated as museums have entered the computer age by developing interactive programs for education and outreach . In the meantime , Microsoft has published &quot; Art_Gallery , &quot; a CD-ROM featuring more_than 2 # 000 images from the collection of London ' s National Gallery . Another Gates ' company , Continuum Productions Corp . in Bellevue , Wash. , has purchased non-exclusive reproduction rights to artworks in the collections of the Seattle Art Museum , the Russian Art Museum in St . Petersburg and the Barnes Foundation in Merion Station , Pa . Gates also has become an art world player by developing an interactive computer_program for the Seattle Art Museum . According to Neill , the museum is partly responsible_for his purchase of the Leonardo manuscript . Chiyo Ishikawa , the museum ' s associate curator of European painting , notified Gates about the auction of the Hammer Codex and suggested that he buy_it , Gardner said . Not previously known as a champion of original artworks , Gates has designed a system for projecting large digitalized images of paintings on high-definition TV screens built into the walls of his new home , creating a changing array of masterpieces . Although art experts generally consider the Leonardo to be more significant as a scientific document than an artwork , the manuscript is the first important piece by a major artist that Gates is known to have purchased .</TEXT>
