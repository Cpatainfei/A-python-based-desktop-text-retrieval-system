   <TEXT> Mohamed Ahmad Hairsh and 21 other families in the Jahaleen Bedouin tribe rejoiced on the day that Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed their historic peace declaration last September . Their tin shanties weren ' t much -- a barrio of scrap metal built into mud and rock in the shadow of the largest Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West_Bank . But the huts are the only home these members of the nomadic Arab tribe have known since settling there , members claim , decades ago . At the very least , they figured , peace meant land -- and their right to remain on it despite the sprawl of the Jewish settlement a_few dozen yards above them . Then the bulldozers came . Then the eviction order . The reason : To make_way for 500 new Jewish homes_in a $ 50-million expansion of the Ma ' ale Adumim settlement that is as controversial as it is ambitious . The plan that has turned Hairsh ' s campsite into a construction site will increase the Jewish presence on strategic Israeli-occupied land at a time when Israel ' s leadership is negotiating the return of Arab land for peace . &quot; What kind of peace is it that takes_away the place where I live ? &quot; Hairsh asked as the bulldozers churned around him this week . &quot; This is not peace . We see quite the opposite. &quot; The plight of the Jahaleen is hardly as clear-cut as it appeared this week , when Palestinian human_rights groups in Jerusalem used it to illustrate allegations that Israel has accelerated confiscation of Arab lands in and around Jerusalem in the months since it signed the land-for-peace agreement with the PLO -- a charge that Israeli authorities promptly and flatly denied . But the threatened eviction of the Jahaleen is , in fact , symbolic of a deeper debate that resurfaced this week over the future of the strategic Jewish settlements surrounding Jerusalem -- indeed , the future of the city . And the Bedouins ' dilemma is emblematic of how , in the months since the historic Middle_East peace ceremony on the White_House lawn , Jews and Arabs alike have sought to change what both sides call &quot; the facts on the ground &quot; -- the use of the land in_question -- in_advance of negotiations on the land ' s future . As settlements such_as Ma ' ale Adumim have quietly continued to expand , carving new roads , walls and foundations for villas on Israeli-occupied land a_few miles outside Jerusalem ' s city_limits , Israeli legislators have in turn warned of Arab expansionism inside the city . Embarking_on new , large-scale building programs of_their_own , Palestinians have been erecting hundreds of illegal structures in recent months , inflating Jerusalem ' s Arab population and threatening the delicate demographics of a disputed city that the PLO leadership has vowed to make the capital of a new Palestinian state . Until this week , the land scramble went largely unnoticed , a sideshow to the Israeli-PLO deadlock over implementation of the September agreement for Israeli withdrawal and limited Palestinian autonomy in the occupied West_Bank town of Jericho and in the Gaza Strip . Under that agreement , the land where the expansion is taking_place will not come_up for formal debate for several years , at least . At the heart of the land controversy is what Palestinian negotiator Faisal Husseini this week called &quot; the spirit of the agreement , &quot; and fears of emerging policies he said would amount to &quot; tactical breaches &quot; that could &quot; stand_in the way of real peace. &quot; Husseini ' s comments came_on Monday , after four Palestinian human_rights groups released maps , documents and a formal statement charging that the government of Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin has embarked_on a policy of &quot; land confiscation &quot; and &quot; settlement expansion &quot; on occupied land in and around Jerusalem . The groups alleged that , in the months since the Israeli-PLO agreement was signed , Israeli authorities confiscated 11 # 500 acres of Arab land for military use , settlement expansion or nature reserves aimed at blocking Palestinian expansion , mostly in the strategic belt surrounding Jerusalem . The Israeli civil administration in_charge of the territories later denied , and presented evidence disputing , the allegation , explaining that the actions taken were merely &quot; implementations &quot; of land decisions made long before the agreement was signed . The actions , a spokeswoman said , will not affect the future use of most of the land . But the Palestinian groups ' statement contained another , more general allegation that reports in the Israeli press this week appeared to confirm , at least in part . Referring specifically to Israel ' s policy to continue implementing land decisions in the occupied territories , the Palestinian groups concluded : &quot; These practices are based on unpublished plans which aim at entrenching Israeli presence in the West_Bank and containing Palestinian presence . &quot; Since the signing of the Declaration of Principles ( Sept . 13 ) , extensive plans have been geared towards realizing an Israeli ' Greater Jerusalem. ' &quot; The following day , the highly regarded Israeli newspaper Haaretz published what appeared to be an outline for such a plan . The newspaper report stated that Jerusalem ' s conservative , newly elected Mayor Ehud Olmert was &quot; leaning toward accepting recommendations from a committee of experts to ' thicken ' ( Jewish ) construction in Greater Jerusalem. &quot; With the report was a map showing the boundaries of that &quot; Greater Jerusalem , &quot; its lines extended so far beyond current city_limits that they include the key West_Bank towns of Bethlehem and Ramallah , plus the entire Ma ' ale Adumim settlement . Haaretz reported that the committee ' s recommendation was based on a belief that only through such settlement and construction could the government counter Palestinian expansion and ensure a Jewish majority in the area in the future . And it added : &quot; One of the professionals involved in the planning of greater metropolitan Jerusalem said what is being spoken about here is , in one disguise or another , an effort of de_facto annexation of the expanse surrounding the city. &quot; It remained unclear , however , whether such plans have the sanction of Rabin and his Labor_Party government , which announced plans to freeze most settlement activity when it took_office in 1992 , but deliberately exempted several settlements closest to Jerusalem -- settlements such_as Ma ' ale Adumim . They are exceptions that continue to be official government policy , despite formal protests from both the Bush and the Clinton_Administrations and despite the prime_minister ' s vow last September to negotiate the future of those lands with the Palestinians at a later date . Ofrah Preuss , spokeswoman for Israel ' s housing ministry , said there is no official plan to expand the settlements around Jerusalem , and she denied assertions that the concept of a Greater Jerusalem reflects official policy . &quot; It is one of 100 ideas until my minister , the prime_minister and the Cabinet approve it , &quot; she said . But Preuss confirmed that the government did approve the 500-unit construction project now under way on the land that Mohamed Ahmad Hairsh and the 22 Jahaleen families refuse to leave . In keeping with the government ' s stated policy , all funds for the project are from private , non-government sources . The spokeswoman also confirmed that Minister for Construction and Housing Binyamin Ben-Eliezer , a close aide to Rabin , formally transferred to Ma ' ale Adumim what the government years earlier had declared &quot; state land &quot; to facilitate the expansion project . A spokeswoman for the Israeli Civil Administration , which runs the occupied territories , similarly confirmed that it is the government ' s responsibility to remove all obstacles to that expansion -- a role it has played both in court and on the rocky hillside the Bedouins refuse to leave . For Israeli Army Maj . Elise Shazar , the Civil Administration ' s official spokeswoman , the controversy over the Bedouins is , like the other cases the Palestinian human_rights groups brought_up this week , &quot; nothing new. &quot; The case dates_back at least two years , she said . At that time , authorities approached the Jahaleen tribe and offered them an alternate campsite a mile or so away . Most of the Jahaleen , who depend_upon jobs at the settlement for their livelihood , accepted the offer and moved . But Hairsh and the 21 other families refused , insisting through a series of lawyers and court actions that the alternate site is uninhabitable . It is covered with boulders , they insisted , and adjacent to Jerusalem ' s main garbage_dump . &quot; The government told them , ' Take the rocks. ' that ' s what they ' re being offered , &quot; said Israeli lawyer Lynda Brayer , whose Society of St . Yves , a Roman_Catholic human_rights group affiliated with the Vatican , has taken_on the Bedouins ' case for free . &quot; From a health point_of_view , it ' s ridiculous . You don ' t put people on a garbage dump. &quot; Brayer asserted that most of her clients have lived_in the camp since the early 1960s , since the Israeli Army declared their traditional grazing_lands in the northern Negev region a military zone and evicted several Bedouin tribes from the region . Maj . Shazar insisted , however , that authorities have aerial photographs indicating that the Jahaleen have been there only years -- &quot; not decades. &quot; No one , not even Hairsh , claims that his tribe has a legal_right to be there . Their rights , Hairsh said , are traditional ones that predate by centuries the 1967 Arab-Israeli War , in which Israel defeated Jordan and occupied the West_Bank . But with Israeli law against the tribe , Brayer said she recently dropped a petition she filed with the high_court seeking to block the families ' eviction rather than wait for a judgment that would force them to move . &quot; There is no way they can stay there , &quot; Shazar said . &quot; It is not their land . The alternative site is not their land , either. &quot; The spokeswoman said she doubts that the army will forcibly evict the remaining tribe members , although she stressed that the families are living_in the midst of an active construction site from which the government has the legal_right to expel them . Hairsh remains both defiant and realistic . &quot; What do you want us to do ? &quot; asked the 39-year-old father of eight , who worked as a tractor driver for the settlement ' s expansion project before his court case cost him his job . &quot; We don ' t have a state . We don ' t have guns . &quot; When you look_at us , you think we are living at the bottom of the_pit of human society . Still , we are proud_of our huts . We are proud_of this fight to keep them here . But if they come_with military power , what can we do ? &quot; We move. &quot;</TEXT>
