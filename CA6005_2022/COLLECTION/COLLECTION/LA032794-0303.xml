   <HEADLINE> LIVING WITH LEAD ' S RISK ; FOR HOMEOWNERS WITH LEAD HAZARDS , FINDING A QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR IS NOT EASY . CONVENTIONAL PAINT-REMOVAL METHODS , SUCH AS SANDING AND SCRAPING , SPREAD TOXIC DUST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ordeal of childhood lead_poisoning began for Christa Hathaway and her husband , Joe Gonzales , when a routine blood_test showed that their infant son had nearly enough of the metal in him to make him sick . Frantic with concern for their baby and toddler daughter , the Santa Barbara couple tested their home for lead hazards . The results showed that dust from deteriorating paint inside the 1920s-era house contained high levels of lead . &quot; We began calling a bunch of people to try to figure_out how to get the lead paint out , &quot; Hathaway said . Unfortunately , there was no easy fix . Conventional paint-removal methods , such_as sanding and scraping , create more toxic dust . The family then started a search for an expert in lead-hazard removal . But as a growing number of property_owners with similar lead hazards are becoming well aware , finding a qualified abatement contractor is nearly impossible in California . There are no state-approved certification or licensing programs for such workers and only a_few programs that teach a curriculum approved by the federal Environmental Protection Agency . Hathaway hired a man who seemed to understand lead-abatement work . His charge for the job : $ 10 # 000 . &quot; I thought , ' Oh my God ! ' &quot; she said of the cost . &quot; But it ' s got_to be done for the safety of my children. &quot; However , it all backfired badly . The man she hired wasn ' t a contractor , as she had believed . And the people he hired as subcontractors weren ' t qualified . In the end , the workers spread so_much toxic lead dust in her home and yard that the property became uninhabitable . Tests run after the workers left found highly toxic levels of lead dust everywhere . Her son ' s new crib showed dust carrying more_than 1 # 100 parts per million of lead . Any level above 200 ppm on the floor and 800 ppm in window wells is considered dangerous . The soil in her yard_measured 15 # 000 ppm -- soil with more_than 1 # 000 ppm is classified as hazardous waste . Finally , family members who own the house shelled_out another $ 15 # 000 just to clean_up the workers ' mess and make the home and property livable . Hathaway ' s story is a common one that illustrates just one problem with lead-hazard abatement today -- while there are a growing number of policies governing the removal or mitigation of lead hazards , there is as of yet no uniform training or standards for California workers and no way to prohibit dangerous lead-abatement practices . &quot; There are many questions about lead-hazard reduction techniques , &quot; said Ellen Widess , executive_director of Lead Safe California , a nonprofit organization that ' s helping shape lead-hazard policies statewide . &quot; What ' s effective ? How often should it be done ? Who does them ? That still needs to be resolved. &quot; In this respect , lead paint hazards are often compared to asbestos . &quot; Those who dealt with the asbestos problem early probably spent two to three times what they would have spent if they could ' ve waited three to four years for the market place to catch_up and regulatory_agencies to catch_up , &quot; said Rick Warren , a San Francisco commercial property attorney also working to develop statewide policies . Nationwide , it ' s estimated up_to 3 million children now have elevated blood lead levels . Lead paint is considered the main source of contamination . The condition , which shows no obvious symptoms except in the most extreme cases , can permanently damage the development of the brain and nervous_systems of children . At it ' s worst , it can cause coma and even death . Right now in California and nationwide , policies regarding lead-hazard abatement vary widely , from nothing at all_in some communities to strict , full-abatement requirements , such_as is the case in Los Angeles County . Total abatement can be quite difficult for a homeowner to achieve . &quot; The cost is so high it ' s scary , &quot; Janet Comey , chief of the Lead Poisoning Abatement Program for the County of Los Angeles Department of Health Services , said of full abatement procedures . &quot; I don ' t know what people are going_to do , especially the small property_owners . . . who basically are just making their monthly mortgage. &quot; Private_property owners faced with lead-abatement orders must make their own financial arrangements for the often costly work . The only safe way to remove the paint is through sophisticated and expensive abatement methods that few contractors are familiar_with . And the dearth of qualified workers means continued high prices for the specialized work . In many instances , however , covering the paint under sheet-rock , paneling and floor tiles , or completely removing and then replacing lead-tainted objects , such_as doors and window fixtures , is the most sensible and cost-efficient remedy . &quot; We realize that people cannot , at the drop of a hat , spend $ 10 # 000 on abatement , &quot; said Bob Schlag , head of the Lead Hazard Reduction Department of the California Department of Health Services . &quot; There are a lot of things you can do to reduce exposure that doesn ' t involve removing the paint . Sometimes removing it can be more damaging than controlling it. &quot; Schlag said routine damp mopping of hardwood floors keeps lead-dust levels down . Lead-tainted soil around the outside of the home should be covered with grass or another ground covering . Removing shoes before entering the house , routinely washing hands , which is especially important for children , and just being aware of potential sources of lead contamination also help . &quot; Woodwork tends to be high in lead concentration and tends to chip_off , &quot; he said . &quot; If you see any chips , pick them up immediately. &quot; But in many other cases , a more aggressive approach is necessary but , depending_upon the areas contaminated in a particular house or apartment , even encapsulation can prove costly . Robert Jung , an engineer and a Los Angeles landlord , is doing battle with Los Angeles County officials over the costly abatement orders they ' ve put_on a rental house he owns in a downtown-adjacent , working-class neighborhood . His house is worth only $ 39 # 000 , according to Jung , but the lead-hazard work ordered by the county -- which involves encapsulating all_the inside and outside walls of his house and removing or replacing all_the painted doors , door frames and door jambs in the four-bedroom , two-bath home -- will cost $ 50 # 000 . &quot; Let ' s say I had the money to fix it up , that I hit the Lotto jackpot and fix it , &quot; Jung said . &quot; Does_it guarantee that the child will be lead free ? No . The answer is , there is no guarantee . Whatever you do , there is no guarantee. &quot; And this recent lead-cleanup order is the second one he ' s received . A year earlier , the county , which now has about 400 such orders active throughout Los Angeles , told him to cover the lead-contaminated soil in his back yard . That cost him about $ 4 # 000 . &quot; I ' ve been a good citizen , &quot; he said &quot; The first time around I complied . I ' m not a big-time landowner . I ' m just a guy working and trying to invest something and it ' s going_down the drain. &quot; Jung considers the L.A. County policy &quot; well-intended &quot; but says its enforcement could in the end hurt families , like those living_in his house . Jung said it will end_up being more cost-effective for him to evict his tenants so he can raze the house and build a new one . &quot; If I evict them , what are they going_to do ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Each family is going_to pay $ 500 or $ 600 for a one-bedroom tenement_house . So it ' s not just me who ' s going_to suffer. &quot; Right now , he said , several families split the $ 1 # 050 monthly rent for his 2 # 500-square-foot house . Jung believes county efforts would be_better spent educating parents on the dangers of lead and how they can minimize their children ' s exposure to it . Pomona resident Elizabeth Jimenez is still reeling from the financial_losses she suffered in getting her house lead safe . The $ 25 # 000 abatement bill ate her entire retirement account and the college money she ' d saved for her five children . And Jimenez -- who was at_the_same_time administering care to one of her lead-poisoned twin daughters -- spent days just trying to find someone she thought could do the job safely . Like other property_owners with lead-contaminated property , the only assistance Jimenez found in getting the job done was a long list of HUD guidelines detailing the do ' s and don ' ts of lead-paint abatement . Eventually , however , there will be more support for property_owners faced with lead hazards . Title X of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 requires each state to develop a program to create a trained and qualified work_force . California officials hope the state ' s program will be ready by July . And a new state law that took_effect in January requires California to comply with federal law mandating uniform training , certification and standards for lead-abatement work . Title X also refocuses national lead efforts on short-term , interim efforts , since most strict abatement policies have proved too overwhelming for many property_owners . Gary Rochlin , owner of Venice-based Lead Tech , a lead-paint inspection and abatement firm , said interim plans can work . Rochlin , who got his lead-paint abatement training and certification in Massachusetts , does everything from full abatement jobs to designing plans that enable clients , like Christa Hathaway , to live safely with lead paint in their homes . After cleaning_up the toxic mess in Hathaway ' s home , Rochlin developed a daily plan requiring that she clean areas of her house with a special vacuum designed to pick_up the tiny lead-dust particles and that she wash walls and other potentially contaminated surfaces with special cleansing products . &quot; There ' s no substitute for 100 % abatement , but I think in-house management is what ' s going_to be happening , &quot; Rochlin said . &quot; If you have a wall intact and lead paint on it , you just have to be careful . Lead paint intact is not a gremlin . It ' s not going_to come_out and grab you . It ' s a problem when it ' s disturbed , but it ' s also something you can live with. &quot; But the contamination in Jimenez ' s home was so widespread that she had to take major steps . Her search for a contractor led her to an Oakland company that charged her $ 600 to test her house and provide her with a breakdown of abatement steps for every contaminated wall and window in her house . &quot; Then I called different contractors and showed them the guidelines , &quot; she said . &quot; They ' d tell me , ' Don ' t worry , we ' ll knock the wall out. ' And I ' d tell them no and explain to them that the dust created would be worse than the paint on the walls. &quot; Finally , Jimenez happened_upon a person she considered qualified to do the work , which included covering the walls and ceiling with drywall , removing all_the dust-laden carpeting ( shampooing doesn ' t remove the dust and vacuuming with a conventional vacuum only spreads it around ) , laying new tiles in the kitchen and removing and replacing all_the wood cabinets . &quot; The kitchen basically had to be redone , &quot; she said . During the two-month job she and her large family set_up camp in her master_bedroom . &quot; It caused tremendous mental stress , &quot; Jimenez said . &quot; Five kids and a baby-sitter . We had our microwave and refrigerator in there and that ' s how we lived. &quot; Meanwhile , as Jimenez followed the exacting HUD guidelines , the next-door neighbor ' s home was getting a face-lift by a painter who sanded the entire outside of the house . &quot; I asked him if he knew if it was lead paint because the dust he was creating was coming_into my daughter ' s bedroom window , &quot; Jimenez recalled . &quot; I called the city and found Pomona had no ordinance , that there was nothing I could do. &quot; For now , Widess of Lead Safe California says given the practical limits of technology and the financial limits of most property_owners , the top priority should be minimizing the most hazardous sources of exposure . &quot; Anybody concerned with this problem realizes there is not enough money in this country to remove all_the lead everywhere , &quot; she said . WHAT YOU CAN DO &quot; There are a lot of things you can do to reduce exposure that don ' t involve removing the paint . Sometimes removing it can be more damaging than controlling it. &quot; -- Bob Schlag , head of the Lead Hazard Reduction Dept . of the California Dept . of Health Services .
