   <HEADLINE> BLUE FLORIDA KEYS REFLECT NEW HEW : DIRTY BLACK ; POLLUTION : THEIR SWEET TROPICAL AROMA IS A BARNYARD STINK . THEIR CORAL_REEFS HAVE CANCER . UNLESS AN ECOSYSTEM IS SAVED SOON , AN ECONOMY WILL DIE AS WELL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amy Knowles steers her skiff near an area of dead mangroves in Florida Bay , searching in vain for clear water . Butterflies , white specks of life , flutter in ironic beauty among the dead and dying trees , but the bay itself , once clear as tap_water , is lifeless . Once near Islamorada in the Keys the water was aqua , then it turned green , now it is black as coffee . The tide is out . Clumps of dead turtle grass lie on the surface . A barnyard smell permeates the fetid air , normal ammonia discharge gone haywire in what is essentially a compost stew . It is the stench of a dying ecosystem . More_than 100 # 000 acres of sea grass and sponges are dead in the bay . This has created a mushy under-layer that feeds algae blooms . The slime smothers life that used to nurture lobsters , pink shrimp , a host of fin fish and all types of birds . &quot; Nobody paid any attention until last year when the blooms started to affect the coral_reef track , &quot; Knowles said . &quot; Then it was something you couldn ' t close your eyes to. &quot; The blooms eat_up the 1 # 000-square-mile fish nursery off the edge of the Florida peninsula like a cancer . Even worse , researchers believe the bay ' s altered water is spreading under channels beyond the Keys into the Atlantic_Ocean . On North_America ' s only coral barrier_reef , coral is dying at an alarming rate . Many blame much of the bay ' s problem on the diversion of fresh_water from the Everglades , which is also having devastating consequences on the mainland . While environmentalists , regulators and farmers argued in court over who should pay to clean_up and restore the Everglades , the rest of the watershed ecosystem -- Florida Bay and the colorful coral_reefs -- were ignored until just recently . Now they are_on the verge of collapse . Gov . Lawton Chiles angered environmentalists by pushing legislation that they believe will delay cleaning_up pollution in the Everglades by a decade . Under the $ 685-million restoration plan , a system of giant marshes will be created to filter_out pollution from sugar growers and vegetable farmers in South Florida . The legislation includes a plan to put more fresh_water into Florida Bay by flooding some farmland south of Miami -- a plan already facing fierce opposition from farmers . Knowles , in her skiff , is determined to find some clear water on this four-hour trip around Florida Bay . She finds some around Rabbit Key Basin , but says it &quot; really wasn ' t that clear. &quot; She should know . She has fished in these parts for more_than a decade and teaches people how to fly-fish . She scans the water searching for tarpon . &quot; It ' s the most exciting thing I can think_of , &quot; she says when she spots a school of the shimmering , big-eyed fish -- some 5 feet long -- hanging_out near a dock . The water at Rabbit Key Basin may_not be up_to the Knowles standard , but it is at least a glimpse of what Florida Bay looked_like just a_few years ago : miles of water tinged tawny by the mangroves on mud islands , but always clear enough to see the sea grass sway beneath . &quot; It was so wonderful to go exploring back here , &quot; Knowles says as she navigates her skiff over the flats . &quot; Now I get very depressed. &quot; Residents of the Florida Keys make their money from the water . The bay produces $ 420 million a year in commercial fish and shrimp catches , about one-fifth of Florida ' s total harvest . If the ecosystem fails , it will take an entire economy with it . Karl Lessard , a fisherman , has trolled the waters for 24 years , searching mainly for lobsters and stone_crabs . &quot; Out of Marathon in the early 1970s , there were 25 shrimp boats , &quot; he said . &quot; We no longer have a single shrimp boat. &quot; Lessard estimates that 20 % to 35 % of commercial fishermen have left the Keys in the last decade in search of better waters or a new profession . Fishermen say their catch has declined as much as 80 % since 1981 on species such_as pink shrimp . Ironically , pink shrimp catches increased 64 % last year for the first time since the algae blooms appeared in 1987 . The shrimp , however , were scrawny , and some believe the catch increased because fish no longer could see the shrimp in the murky blooms . Lessard first noticed the greening of the bay in the 1970s in an area he used to fish that ' s now known as the Dead Zone . These days , he said , he must wake at 3 a.m. and take his boat 30 to 50 miles out_to catch enough fish to make a living . And the problem is spreading . Lessard now sees the algae blooms hurting recreational fishing and other industries vital to the Keys ' economy . This spring , scuba-diving trips to the reef were canceled when visibility dropped to 5 feet , he said . Rep . Peter Deutsch ( D-Fla. ) said a study by his office found 5 # 000 jobs could be lost if the environment in the Keys collapses . &quot; People like fishermen are saying , ' I ' m not making as much money. ' Divers say , ' The water is dirty. ' Guides say , ' I ' m losing 10 % of my business , ' &quot; Deutsch said . As fresh_water flowing to the Everglades is diverted to farmland and to the burgeoning cities of southeast Florida , the effects trickle to the bay . Researchers have linked the sea grass die-offs and algae blooms to pollution and man-made changes that have reduced the flow of fresh_water to about one-fifth of what nature intended . To rescue the bay , environmentalists are lobbying the government to buy_up farmland south of Miami and flood it in hopes of returning some type of freshwater flow . Keith Rampley and Michelle Harrison of England had just finished canoeing among the mangroves at John Pennekamp State Park , Florida ' s 178-square-mile nautical preserve on Key Largo . They had been to Florida before and came_back for one reason . &quot; We came here particularly to see the reef , &quot; Rampley said . &quot; But if we had heard there wasn ' t that much to see , if the fish weren ' t coming and coral was dying , what ' s the point of coming ? &quot; Sentiments like that are the Keys ' worst nightmare . The reef and the marine life it supports are a major tourist lure . &quot; The reef is an international resource , &quot; said DeeVon Quirolo of Reef Relief in Key West , &quot; and it ' s dying before our eyes. &quot; He blames farm runoff and sewage from the Keys for killing the coral . The barrier_reef stretches for 128 miles , from near Miami to the end of the Keys . About 1 million divers visit the reef annually for a firsthand look_at the bounty of colorful fish and the coral varieties that range from purple fans to stolid brain-like caps . Scott Marr , owner of Del Mar Resort in Key Largo , said the people who either fish Florida Bay or dive the barrier_reef generate $ 2 billion a year for the Keys and provide about 75 % of Monroe County ' s jobs . &quot; The first thing that happens is Florida Bay goes , then coral_reefs die , then it ' s going_to impact Miami and all_of South Florida , &quot; Marr said . &quot; I can ' t believe it won ' t impact the entire state because people come here to see more_than Mickey_Mouse and Donald Duck. &quot; Just so . Next to the Orlando area ' s Walt Disney World , the Keys are the most-visited spot in Florida . There ' s a rub . While tourism drives the Keys ' economy , tourists are part of the problem . &quot; As the dive industry has grown , there are bigger boats with more people , and they are using more and more of the reef system , &quot; said Walter Jaap , who works for the Florida Marine Research Institute .</TEXT>
