   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH : STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS ; SAVING YOUR SKIN ; HAS YOUR SKIN REBELLED ? ACNE ATTACKS VIRTUALLY EVERYONE . BUT THERE ARE SOME WAYS TO BATTLE BLEMISHES AND MAKE IT A FAIR FIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Being a teen-ager is filled with new experiences : You can get your driver ' s license and your first car , attend high_school and the prom and battle acne . Back_up a minute , you might say ; can ' t we just skip that last part ? While acne is a part of young adulthood that we ' d all like to skip , few are able to escape it entirely . Ninety percent of teen-agers will experience some form of this pesky problem on the face , neck , chest , back or arms . To the other 10 % -- the rest of us envy your luck . For many years it was thought that acne was the result of improper hygiene , what you ate or even a person ' s degree of sexual_activity . Those beliefs are misconceptions , and you are not at_fault for your acne , according to &quot; Overcoming Acne : The How and Why of Healthy Skin_Care , &quot; a book by Alvin , Virginia and Robert Silverstein . Instead , point a finger at your body chemistry . Between the ages of 12 and 17 , your body undergoes many changes , and sex_hormones begin to surge . These hormones are responsible_for increasing the amount of oil in your skin . Your skin is constantly shedding dead cells and replenishing them with new ones . Sometimes the dead skin_cells and oil clump together , along with bacteria . This mixture lodges itself in the tiny holes in your skin , called pores . This is where the problems begin . Oil continues to flow in your pores despite the backup . This causes pressure . There are two options for the trapped mass . It will either remain in the pore , adopt a dark color and create a blackhead or push_through the pore and form a pimple . Neither option is good for your complexion . If the mass decides to push_through the pore , your body will launch a war on the escaped contents . Blood will surge to the injured site , and your white_blood_cells will attack and destroy the bacteria , dead skin_cells and oil . The white_blood_cells , having completed their job , die and form pus . The end result is a pimple . Believe it or not , that pimple is a victory sign for your body . What can be done about acne ? Unfortunately , there is no miracle cure . However , you need not weather the problem alone . Drugstore shelves are loaded with products -- Clearasil , Oxy and Stridex to name a_few -- that are waiting to help clear_up your complexion . The brands have something in common -- benzoyl_peroxide . Benzoyl peroxide helps fight acne because it delivers extra oxygen to your skin . The bacteria that causes acne hates oxygen . When benzoyl_peroxide is applied , it releases the excess oxygen . The oxygen kills the bacteria and , therefore , reduces formation of pimples . Benzoyl peroxide does have side_effects for some people , though , including causing peeling skin and leaving a stinging sensation . A former benzoyl_peroxide user among acne sufferers interviewed for this article recalled an uncomfortable experience : &quot; I was walking into school one morning , and my face was burning so bad that it felt_like I was_on fire . My face was red and splotchy . When my friend saw me , she laughed and called me a fire engine. &quot; To avoid this discomfort , it ' s recommended that a person starting treatment use the weakest concentration . Wash your skin before your application , but allow plenty of time for drying . Rub the medicine over the entire affected area , not just on one blemish . Keep the benzoyl_peroxide away from eyes , nose and mouth . If your skin stings , leave the medicine on for a short time -- say an hour -- and then wash it off . As your skin becomes less sensitive , gradually increase the time you keep the medication on until you can endure a full night or day . You should be aware of another side_effect : Benzoyl peroxide can create dark spots on some skin types . Asian and African American skin types are most vulnerable to this side_effect . This medicine also causes sun sensitivity in all races , so don ' t forget your sunscreen for excursions to the beach . The sun isn ' t the only thing you will be sensitive to . &quot; I have learned to stay_away_from soaps and lotions with heavy fragrances and dyes . They irritate my skin and cause more stinging , &quot; says one acne sufferer . This medication can even take a toll on your wardrobe . &quot; It ruins your clothes . It takes the color out , &quot; says another victim of acne . To prevent bleaching of clothes , thoroughly wash your skin before dressing . If you apply medicine to your back , consider wearing a T-shirt under your clothes . If over-the-counter medications just don ' t seem to cooperate , don ' t despair . Visit a dermatologist . She will personalize your treatment with prescriptions for stronger benzoyl_peroxide , Retin-A , tetracycline or other topical and oral medications . Be sure to ask about side_effects . A dermatologist can also perform chemical peels and help with acne scars . As a last_resort for extreme acne , Accutane can be prescribed . This oral drug , which remains in your system for two months , cures nearly all patients , according to &quot; Overcoming Acne. &quot; There are significant potential side_effects to Accutane , including blurred vision , liver problems and heart_disease . Blood_tests are routinely taken during treatment to monitor the patient . A pregnancy test is also performed before treatment begins , due_to Accutane ' s history of causing birth_defects and miscarriages . * There are some simple things you can do to keep_from aggravating your skin whether you have an active case of acne . Don ' t do things that prevent oil from escaping_from pores , like resting your chin on your hand during boring lectures or wearing a football_helmet with a chin_strap for prolonged periods . Also , be wary of cosmetics and foundations . The products you use to improve your looks could be clogging pores and exacerbating acne . Reduce stress in your life . Stress stimulates the release of oil and can make you susceptible to a variety of bacteria and viruses . The good news is last : Eating a candy_bar does not cause acne . Although what you eat will affect your overall health and therefore your skin , studies are finding that the food you eat is not what triggers acne . So , if you dare , enjoy your favorite chocolate_bar , soda and potato_chips ! The thing most likely to be affected is your waistline . Take_heart in knowing that you may be stuck_with acne for now , but eventually it will disappear . Look_around . You are not alone . Nearly every teen can relate . They are all waiting for the same day -- the day that acne isn ' t a daily battle .</TEXT>
