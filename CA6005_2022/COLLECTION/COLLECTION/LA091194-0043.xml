   <TEXT> There ' s nothing like starting the month with the discovery of a fine new voice . It belongs_to April Smith , whose North of Montana ( Knopf : $ 23 , 293 pp. ) introduces not only a new author but also a likable new heroine , an unhackneyed view of Los Angeles ( the Montana is Montana Avenue in Santa Monica ) and a story that majors in the not-quite-predictable . Smith , a Los Angeles writer-producer from television ( &quot; Cagney and Lacey &quot; and four TV movies ) knows just about all there is to know about pace , the detailing that generates atmosphere , and the sensitive observation ( or imagination ) that creates character . Ana Grey is a part-Latino , almost-30 FBI_agent , tough and plain-spoken , very nearly but not wholly monastic in her fierce ambition to get_ahead , far ahead , in the local bureau . She nabs a bank robber single-handedly early on and is carpeted by her sexist boss for not calling_for help . Nice guy . She ' s assigned to a case involving an aging sex star ( a Liz Taylor clone ) who is accusing a doctor of turning her on to drugs . The case has curious links to the drive-by killing of a Salvadoran woman who may be a cousin Grey didn ' t know she had and whose surviving small children become her responsibility . The dead woman was a maid fired by the doctor ' s wife . The author ' s voice is her own , but she recalls Raymond Chandler ( and more recent chroniclers ) in her ability to evoke the city , from the decadent splendors of Malibu to the despairs of MacArthur Park in the hours before dawn . It is clear she has rubbed egos with temperamental and unlovable stars , but then again all her characters , large and small , spring to life . The plot , while intricate , has a sad and logical inevitability . The emotionally complicated Ana , burdened by a tragic past , will be fascinating to meet again . Donald E . Westlake ' s Baby , Would I Lie ? ( Mysterious Press : $ 19.95 , 304 pp. ) is a deliciously nutty sequel to his exploration of a Florida-based supermarket tabloid , &quot; Trust Me on This. &quot; ( Westlake was once assigned to write a documentary about the best-known of the scandal sheets ; the documentary was in the end not filmed , but the research has been a treasure-trove for him. ) The setting is that unlikely rural show-biz capital , Branson , Mo . ( the book ' s subtitle is &quot; A Romance of the Ozarks &quot; ) , where a country star is going_on trial for murder . Sara Joslyn , who fled the Weekly Galaxy for Trend , a thoughtful and up-market New York magazine , is_on hand to give the event the Dominick Dunne treatment . A seamy crowd from her alma_mater , the Galaxy , is_on hand as well , buying witnesses and planting bugs right and left , wooing a prosecuting attorney by pretending to represent the Economist , leaving no dirty trick untried . The present journalistic feeding frenzy surrounding the Simpson case is a novelist ' s dream of perfect timing . The singer ' s big hit ( Westlake supplies several brilliant lyrics ) is &quot; If It Ain ' t Fried , It Ain ' t Food &quot; and I can ' t imagine why nobody else got there first . Another of his hits is &quot; Baby , Would I Lie ? &quot; The book of the same name is the funniest mystery of the year . In The Body Farm ( Scribners : $ 23 ; 387 pp. ) , Patricia Cornwell extends the adventures of Dr. Kay Scarpetta , Richmond ' s medical_examiner , currently on detached service to lend the FBI some forensic know-how . A child in a remote North Carolina hill town has been brutally murdered , possibly by a serial_killer named Gault , who narrowly eluded Scarpetta once before . No one can accuse Cornwell of skimping on illustrative detail . This is probably the grisliest of the five Scarpetta novels , including an exhumation . The farm of the title is the University of Tennessee ' s Decay Research Facility , which works_on cadavers to yield ways of determining times of death with ever-greater accuracy -- an important crime-solving tool . More_than putrefaction is afoot , however . The murder is not quite as it seems ; Scarpetta ' s old cop pal Marino is an emotional mess , and Scarpetta ' s difficult niece Lucy is working computers at the FBI ' s Quantico center , where Scarpetta , like Cornwell , spends a lot of time . Lucy , seduced and betrayed by another woman , provides a peculiarly affecting subplot to the search for the child-killer . Lucy ' s woes suggest that Cornwell is airing some of_her_own feelings about the difficulties of being a strong woman in a man ' s world . Her few lovers , Scarpetta muses , had been formidable but sensitive men , who could accept that &quot; I was the body and sensibilities of a woman with the power and drive of a man. &quot; None of the new breed of women sleuths have said it more succinctly . The new book is not least an anthem to the FBI , which Cornwell indicates has come a far piece from J . Edgar Hoover . For all its gamy images , Cornwell again makes forensics engrossing if occasionally bewildering . &quot; If she drowned , &quot; Scarpetta says crisply , &quot; there should be edema fluid in the alveolar spaces with disproportionate autolytic change of the respiratory epithelium. &quot; The same thought occurred to me . But at last the piling_up of microscopic facts , and the Holmesian deductions they trigger , help build uncommon suspense and tension . Cornwell knows her stuff , alveolar spaces but the soul as well , and how to make a story . The ending leaves a mystery solved , but threads remain that will lead to another novel , I ' m sure . Wild_Horses ( Putnam : $ 22.95 ; 319 pp. ) is by my count the 33rd Dick Francis novel . Amazingly , after so_long a run , Francis has produced one of his best in recent years . His protagonist this time is a filmmaker , and Francis captures his milieu with the assurance of a man who has spent a lot of time on the set . The cast rings true , from the wizard cinematographer to the writer whining that his script has been eviscerated and the producer trying to placate the writer , the locals and the brass back in Hollywood . Inevitably , since we are in Francis country , the_English director used to be a jockey until he grew too_large even for steeplechasing , and got_into film as a wrangler on an American location . Now he ' s back in Newmarket , filming a drama based on a best-selling novel , which was a thinly disguised retelling of a famous unsolved death , the suspicious suicide of a prominent trainer ' s wife a_few years earlier . Past and present collide during the filming , of course , and the director gets_to jump a_few fences ( exciting as always ) , to escape attempts on his life and generally uphold the Francis tradition of high action in credible settings . I called Rebecca Rothenberg ' s debut novel &quot; The Bulrush Murders &quot; one of the 10 best novels of 1992 . Her heroine , Claire Sharples , a government botanist working among the agribusinesses in the San Joaquin Valley , is back in The Dandelion Murders ( Mysterious Press : $ 18.95 ; 304 pp. ) . Once again , the unusual nature of the work and the evocation of the valley and its people are the strengths of an offbeat novel . The mystery this time centers_on the unexplainable drownings , in irrigation_ditches , of two ( possibly more ) farm_workers and a free-lance journalist . Pesticide poisonings ? Could be , but there ' s more , and Claire is quickly into it and into danger . She ' s also hung_up in a love_affair with a co-worker who can ' t quite get_over his ex-wife and children and is whipsawed between the women . The pesticides are more interesting , which is to say a good_book works away from its own virtues . Dianne G . Pugh ' s &quot; Cold Call &quot; was also an exemplary debut novel a_couple_of years ago . It introduced Iris Thorne , a Los Angeles investment counselor ( as the author is ) . Thorne is back again in Slow Squeeze ( Pocket Books : $ 20 ; 312 pp. ) , confronting a hyper-zaftig and florid Southern lady with oodles of money to invest . The unveiling of Barbie Stringfellow is a superior piece of storytelling . Paralleling it is a portrait of a young Chicano in the office who is certain his heritage is against him but who is determined to make_it anyway . Thorne is the target this time , possibly because of the half-million she has in a safe-deposit_box , left over from &quot; Cold Call. &quot; Pugh has a raucous sense_of_humor , a satiric eye and an assured way with construction . H.R.F. ( Harry ) Keating wrote the first several of his mysteries starring Inspector Ghote of the Bombay police before he ' d actually ever been to Bombay , relying heavily on information from the India Tourist Office ( and getting caught_out only once , on a minor matter of a train schedule ) . Ghote makes his 20th appearance in Cheating Death ( Mysterious Press : $ 18.95 ; 176 pp. ) . A student appears to have attempted suicide after stealing an exam paper and selling it to those due_to take the exam . But appearances are deceiving ( else the whole mystery field would turn_to dust overnight ) , and attempted murder is more like it . Ghote adrift amid the posturings and pretensions and sly ambitions of academe lets himself appear even more foolish than usual . But he deals shrewdly with rebellious students who imagine they can outwit him , and ( not quite as quickly as the reader ) untangles the mystery .</TEXT>
