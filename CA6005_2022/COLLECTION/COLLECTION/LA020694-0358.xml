   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IS A TOUCH AWAY ; TECHNOLOGY : FEMA IS USING NEW HAND-HELD_COMPUTERS IN RECORDING CLAIMS FOR QUAKE VICTIMS . OFFICIALS SAY THE SYSTEM WILL SAVE TIME AND MONEY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After trials by fire , flood and temblor , the Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided its Northridge earthquake inspectors with a new , portable_computer system to help repair the shattered lives of disaster victims . &quot; This is the first very large-scale use of the Automated Construction Estimate system , &quot; said Scott Martin , chief of the FEMA Housing Disaster Branch . &quot; My guess is it ' s going_to shave at least five days to a week in the time the people get their checks and between $ 10 million and $ 20 million in administration costs. &quot; The ACE system developed for the agency by UCS Inc. of Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , consists_of hand-held_computer terminals on which inspectors can enter damage information while touring disaster sites . The information is then fed into a central computer bank in Redwood City , saving paper and man-hours . The computers are manufactured by two companies , AST Research Inc. of Irvine , and Dauphin Technology Inc. of Lombard , Ill . In some field tests , the ACE system slashed the time to process victims ' applications for disaster aid in half . The ACE system was tested in the Eureka earthquake and Phoenix floods , both in 1992 , and during last year ' s Southland firestorms . The results were positive enough that the computers were given to all 800 inspectors working_on the Northridge quake . At first glance , the 2.5-pound computer looks_like a portable video_game or an &quot; Etch-a-Sketch &quot; toy . But inspectors say it is all business , with software that contains inspection forms for FEMA aid applicants . &quot; The computers have cut_down on a lot of garbage , &quot; said FEMA inspector Andres Villalon , 56 , of Key Biscayne , Fla. , who filled_out paper forms during last year ' s Midwest floods . &quot; The difference between working the Missouri floods and the Northridge quake is like night and day. &quot; By touching a pen to a screen to fill_out the inspection survey , inspectors say they are able to work faster and more accurately than they were with the old system of writing by hand on forms as they walked through damaged buildings . Unlike the paper forms , which provided_for only 99-line items of damage , the software for the pen computers_stores a list of more_than 250-line items of loss resulting from tornado , hurricane , earthquake , fire and flood , Martin said . The inspector simply touches the pen to one of the 11 damage categories on the screen ( including electrical , floor and ceiling ) , then , the location of the damage ( kitchen , bathroom , etc. ) and finally the damaged item , which can range from common dishware to mobile_home foundations . The software calculates how much damage is done and the replacement_costs in the area of the country the inspectors are working . And since a small keyboard types up reports , there is no confusion or delays resulting from poor handwriting . &quot; There seems to be something in the human gene pool that if you know how to repair a house , you can ' t spell , &quot; Martin said of his inspectors . FEMA ' s cost for each unit and its software is about $ 5 # 000 . But Martin said the price will be worth it . &quot; The paper system shortchanged victims , &quot; Martin said . &quot; During the field test in the Eureka , Calif. , earthquake , inspectors ' reports were 30 % more accurate than with the paper system. &quot; The new system will also benefit taxpayers , Martin said . At the end of each day , the ACE system allows inspectors to hook_up a modem and send all their inspection data into a central processing facility in Redwood City . In prior disasters , they had to drive to a processing station to drop them off . In an average disaster year with about 75 # 000 FEMA applicants , Martin estimates that the ACE system will save about $ 5.4 million in administrative costs . The Northridge earthquake , by comparison , could result in four times as_many applicants and four times the savings . &quot; Typically , an inspector will lose a_couple_of days of work just driving_back and forth , &quot; Martin said . &quot; What we ' ve done is turn inspectors into data-entry people. &quot; This is a welcome relief for FEMA inspector Don Walters of Eureka , Mo. , who drove daily from the flood-ravaged areas of Missouri to the central processing headquarters in St . Louis . &quot; I would drive seven hours , do between eight and 11 appointments , and drive_back , &quot; he said . &quot; Here , I can go from Northridge to Sylmar to Lake View Terrace and send everything in at night. &quot;</TEXT>
