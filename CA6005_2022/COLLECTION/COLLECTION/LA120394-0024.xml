   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DISPUTE OVER EXPANSION LAYS BARE CORE DIFFERENCES WITHIN NATO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a perfect diplomatic ambush . Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev had said his country was ready to agree to a long-awaited working arrangement with NATO , and he wanted a high-profile ceremony -- a brief formal exchange of documents in front of the cameras , lots of cameras . And so Thursday evening , with NATO ' s smiling , unsuspecting leadership right where he wanted it in front of the cameras , Kozyrev unleashed his trap : Instead of handshakes and backslaps , he declared that he could not agree to the working plan . NATO ' s decision to begin immediate preparations for eastward expansion , he said , had raised new problems . While the blindside attack won Kozyrev points among hard-line conservatives in Moscow wary of alliance intentions , it was also an effective Russian strike at an alliance weak_point -- deep divisions over the wisdom of rapid expansion . What Kozyrev saw and zeroed_in on was just one of a growing number of internal differences that have begun to strike at the heart of the 44-year-old North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , which remains the key institution linking the United States and Europe . A two-day meeting of NATO foreign_ministers that ended here late Friday may have managed a facade of unity , but it did little to resolve differences on fundamental issues , some of which could haunt the alliance for years to come . Certainly , dispute is no stranger to NATO , an alliance of 16 free-thinking democracies . The Jimmy_Carter Administration ' s proposal of the late 1970s to develop a neutron_bomb that would destroy life but not property briefly drove a wedge through the alliance , while German resistance in the late 1980s to American pressure to develop a new short-range nuclear missile also cooled transatlantic ties briefly . But today NATO is especially vulnerable to internal tension . For the first time , the alliance has no visible external threat to keep it together . For the first time , it is unsure of its own role . The crucial job of secretary_general , whose role is to find and build consensus among the 16 , is held by a capable diplomat , but one inexperienced in military affairs . On Bosnia , alliance harmony got a hefty assist from a last-minute shift in Washington that brought the Clinton_Administration into line with the Europeans ' plan to offer Bosnian Serbs important concessions in return for agreeing to a preliminary peace formula . &quot; The crisis in Bosnia is about Bosnia , not about NATO , &quot; was a refrain recited on cue by alliance Secretary_General Willy Claes and members of nearly every delegation present . However , the underlying divisions on how to deal with the conflict itself still remain . Comments earlier this week by Sen . Bob Dole ( R.-Kan. ) denigrating the_French and British for faintheartedness in Bosnia , and his pledge to push the new Congress for greater use of NATO air_power and a lifting of the internationally imposed arms embargo against the Bosnian government , have also not been forgotten . &quot; If British and French forces die in the next couple of weeks , there will be a tendency in Britain and France to blame the United States for this , &quot; said Patrick Glynn , an expert on the Balkans at the American Enterprise Institute , a Washington think_tank . Other analysts believe that NATO ' s decision on eastward expansion carries more serious long-term implications for alliance unity . While all 16 members officially welcomed the first concrete step toward enlargement , doubts pervade Western Europe . &quot; The alliance is overextending itself &quot; with expansion , warned Heinrich Vogel , director of the Institute of International and East European Studies in Cologne , Germany . &quot; It ' s nice wording on expansion , but there ' s little thought given to it . They are releasing an additional Pandora ' s box. &quot; Some Europeans worry that the Clinton_Administration , thinking that it may be a one-term phenomenon , has set a target of completing the initial expansion by 1996 , a pace the Europeans see as dangerously fast . They want to delay any NATO expansion beyond late 1996 , when a review of the European Union ' s treaty on political and economic union is scheduled . &quot; It takes more time to think through the implications , the assumptions for this kind of a step , &quot; Vogel added . &quot; The assumptions on NATO expansion depend_on the potential development of Russia , and there ' s no agreement on that . Some see it as a basket case , others as a neo-imperialist power. &quot; There is also concern in Europe that rapid NATO expansion could provoke Russia , which , as Kozyrev ' s performance underscored , remains deeply suspicious of its old enemy . Kozyrev ' s hard-line stance in Brussels met with approval in Moscow , where lawmakers and opinion leaders have warned that expanding NATO membership to the former Warsaw Pact nations would have disastrous consequences for Russia ' s relations with the West . NATO in the last year has embraced 23 nations , mostly former Soviet-bloc countries , in an adjunct organization called the Partnership for Peace . &quot; The train of European history has started off in the wrong direction , and a crash is unavoidable , &quot; said defense analyst Alexander A . Konovalov of Moscow ' s U.S.A. and Canada Institute . Despite NATO efforts to reassure Russia that any expansion of the alliance east poses no threat , Moscow will view any enlargement of NATO as an unfriendly act that would polarize Europe and isolate Russia behind &quot; a new Berlin Wall , &quot; Konovalov said . Moreover , Konovalov said , &quot; nobody can explain seriously why NATO should enlarge if Russia is not the enemy. &quot; As the alliance begins its preliminary work_on expansion , some Western experts are asking the same question .</TEXT>
