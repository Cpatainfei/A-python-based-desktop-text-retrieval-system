   <HEADLINE> OLYMPIC COVER-UP ALLEGED ; DRUG TESTING : NINE POSITIVE RESULTS AT 1984 LOS ANGELES GAMES WERE KEPT SECRET , OFFICIAL SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nine positive drug tests at the 1984 Summer Olympics were allegedly covered_up and documentation subsequently destroyed , it was revealed Monday . Don Catlin , director of the UCLA facility that handled the Olympic drug testing , told The Times that a number of positive results were never reported and that he never knew why . Catlin ' s comments come_on the heels of reports on BBC television and in the Times of London that questioned the handling of drug testing during the L.A. Games . A BBC report talked_of a break-in and shredded documents , as if the latest Olympic drug scandal had borrowed pages from the Watergate and Iran-Contra affairs . One of the report ' s main sources was Craig Krammerer , Catlin ' s associate in 1984 , who said that five of the nine tests showed the presence of anabolic_steroids . The others had traces of testosterone , the male sex_hormone , and ephedrine , the substance for which soccer star Diego Maradona was kicked_out of the World Cup . All the substances are banned by the International Olympic Committee . Krammerer , now a drug researcher in New Jersey , said the laboratory sent its findings to IOC officials and waited for a reply to test the second samples . Technicians split urine specimens into &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; samples for separate verification , which is a standard procedure . During 15 days of operation , the UCLA laboratory tested 1 # 502 athletes . Twelve positives were reported , including two medal_winners -- a Swedish weightlifter and Finnish distance runner . The greatest number -- 157 -- were tested the day before the Olympics ended . The nine positives allegedly ignored came during the competition ' s last two days . Among the marquee events held_in the final two days were the men ' s shotput , women ' s discus , men ' s 1 # 500 , women ' s 100 hurdles , men ' s marathon and boxing finals . &quot; We couldn ' t keep track of each case , &quot; Catlin told The Times . &quot; We were so busy . These other things going_on didn ' t sink_in until sometime afterward. &quot; Harry Usher , who was vice_president of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee , dismissed the allegations . &quot; I don ' t know where ( a cover-up ) would come from but not from the LAOOC , &quot; he said . Tony Daly , the LAOOC ' s chief medical_officer , said he hears drug rumors after every Olympics . &quot; Even from ( South ) Korea ( in 1988 ) and Russia ( in 1980 ) , &quot; he said . &quot; I always discount it. &quot; According to the BBC report , Juan Antonio Samaranch , president of the IOC , Peter Uebberoth , president of the LAOOC , and Prince Alexandre DeMerode , president of the IOC medical commission , discussed the drug positives in a meeting . A fourth person present at the meeting told the BBC that DeMerode refused to go_along with any attempt to cover_up the results . Arnold Beckett , a former member of the IOC medical commission , said the plan was carried_out anyway . Without DeMerode ' s cooperation , it was more difficult because the Belgian prince was one of the few officials who had access to the athletes ' names and corresponding code of their urinalysis . The UCLA laboratory sent its coded results to DeMerode , who connected the names and informed the athletes and their coaches of the positives . In the case of the nine positives , DeMerode never got the chance . Beckett said someone broke_into his hotel_room , stole the data and shredded it . &quot; ( DeMerode ) told us they had taken them and shredded it , &quot; said Beckett , who was removed from the commission because of a disagreement during the Barcelona Games . &quot; There was no way to connect the documents with the person. &quot; IOC officials refused to comment on the specific allegations , but pointed to the organization ' s long standing against performance-enhancing drugs . &quot; There has been tremendous progress in the last 10 years of the management and control of doping , &quot; UCLA ' s Catlin said . &quot; I can ' t work with people fooling_around . These people run very credible programs. &quot; One explanation given for the missing positives was that the IOC sent control tests to check the laboratory ' s reliability . But Krammerer said IOC officials informed the laboratory after they caught each control . &quot; There were two , &quot; he said Monday . &quot; We caught both of them. &quot; Contacted in Toronto , Beckett , 74 , said he did not speak out earlier because he thought it was best for the Olympic movement . &quot; In retrospect , it was a wrong decision , &quot; he said . Beckett , who retired from Kings College of London nine years ago , also implicated Primo Nebiolo , president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation , as helping devise a plan to cover_up the tests . Beckett alleged Nebiolo tried to change a positive of a distance runner in 1984 , but other IAAF officials refused to do_it . Nebiolo could not be reached . &quot; I broke rank with good intent , &quot; Beckett said . &quot; Somebody has got_to stop this madness. &quot; Times staff writer Julie Cart contributed to this story .</TEXT>
