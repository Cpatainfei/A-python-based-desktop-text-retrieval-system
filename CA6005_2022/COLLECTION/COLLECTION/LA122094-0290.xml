   <HEADLINE> VENTURA COUNTY ROUNDUP : SIEMENS SOLAR PANELS POWER NATIONAL TREE LIGHTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Solar panels produced by Oxnard-based Siemens Solar Industries are helping power the lights on the National Christmas_Tree in Washington that President Clinton and his family recently lit . As part of a solar demonstration coordinated by the Department_of_Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , Siemens and two other manufacturers are providing arrays to generate about 15 % of the tree ' s energy needs . The companies are also helping supply solar_power for the Pageant of Peace festival on the Washington Mall . The National_Park_Service , which coordinates the festival , required that solar modules manufactured in the United States be used and that the arrays be 100 % reliable . Siemens donated 28 of its M55 photovoltaic modules for the event . The other firms , Solarex Inc. and ASE America , donated some solar-powered units as well . According to the Energy_Department , the cost of photovoltaic systems has declined more_than 300 % since 1982 , while the world market for the systems is growing at a rate of 20 % annually . Siemens , part of the German multinational Siemens Solar Group , says it is the world ' s largest supplier of solar_cells and modules .</TEXT>
