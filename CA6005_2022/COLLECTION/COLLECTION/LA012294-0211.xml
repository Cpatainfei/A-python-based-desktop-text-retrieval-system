   <HEADLINE> MIDEAST PEACE NEGOTIATIONS TO RESUME IN U.S. ; MEDIATION : FOCUS WILL BE_ON RELATIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL , SYRIA . OFFICIALS HOPE TO CAPITALIZE ON CLINTON ' S TALKS WITH ASSAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American mediators , hoping to capitalize on President Clinton ' s summit with Syrian President Hafez Assad , have summoned Middle_East peace negotiators to resume talks Monday focusing_on the frosty relationship between Israel and Syria . The meetings , to be held at the State_Department , mark the resumption of the formal peace process that has been in limbo since September , when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a skeleton plan for Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho . Israel and the PLO are engaged in intensive negotiations away from Washington to settle the troublesome details required to accomplish objectives outlined in their agreement , signed with much fanfare more_than four months ago . While those discussions continue , attention here will focus_on the separate talks between Israel and Syria , the region ' s most bitter adversaries . In his Geneva meeting last week with Clinton , Assad offered new assurances that Syria is serious about peace . He described it as a &quot; strategic option &quot; for Damascus , meaning Syria considers peace an end in itself , not just a tactical means toward some_other objective . But the wily Assad refused to be pinned_down on exactly what he means by peace . Syria has long said it is willing to exchange &quot; full peace &quot; for a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights , a strategic plateau that Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle_East War . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in a speech Wednesday in Tel Aviv that he doubts if Syria is willing to accept Israel ' s definition of peace -- exchange of ambassadors , open borders and free_trade . U.S. officials expressed optimism that the Clinton-Assad talks will break the deadlock between Israel and Syria . Non-government experts on the Middle_East are far more skeptical . &quot; It can ' t hurt , &quot; Goeffrey Kemp , a former National Security_Council regional specialist , said of the Clinton-Assad talks . At the same time , he said if the Clinton-Assad meeting has really produced a subtle change in Syrian attitudes , the opening can be explored only in secret meetings between Israel and Syria -- away from the Washington negotiations . &quot; The only thing I ' m convinced of is that if something did happen , if there is a chink in the door , the meeting will have to be a lot more private , &quot; said Kemp , now a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . Unlike earlier rounds , Monday ' s talks will be conducted by heads of the Israeli , Syrian , Lebanese , Jordanian and Palestinian delegations , instead of by the full bargaining teams . The American sponsors believe that the less-formal setting will permit the give-and-take bargaining that was rare in earlier sessions of the peace process . &quot; We ' re trying to keep the stakes down so the parties don ' t have to make statements whenever they go_in or out of the door , &quot; a State_Department official said . &quot; We ' re trying to make_it a little easier for them , a little lower profile. &quot; Still , Middle_East experts consider the Washington talks little more_than a holding action to keep the process going until Assad and Rabin are ready to take decisive action . As such , the negotiations are a demonstration of the willingness of the adversaries to keep talking to each other , but there is little likelihood of a breakthrough . &quot; The question is whether the Washington negotiations have much to do with anything , &quot; said William B . Quandt , a former National Security_Council Middle_East specialist . &quot; Assad is so central to the process that it is hard to believe he will delegate much authority to the negotiators . Similarly , Rabin is unlikely to delegate much authority . &quot; The next determination that the Americans must make is when to try to increase the tempo of the negotiations , not through the formal process in Washington but perhaps through another shuttle by ( Secretary_of_State Warren ) Christopher , &quot; said Quandt , now a scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington . American officials said Christopher has &quot; penciled in &quot; a Middle_East trip in February or March , but no decision has been made on whether he will go_through with it . Notwithstanding any change in atmosphere resulting from Assad ' s meeting with Clinton , the Israel-Syria dispute is by far the most troublesome in the region . So far , both Assad and Rabin are insisting that they want peace but only on_their_own terms . The deadlock may be easing , but , if so , the process is a very slow one . Rabin conceded recently that Syria is unlikely to relax its demand for total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights . He said Assad is unlikely to put aside the &quot; Egypt precedent , &quot; in which Israel agreed to a complete return of the Sinai_Peninsula as part of its peace_treaty with Egypt . But if Rabin agrees to return the Golan , the pact would surely touch_off a major political crisis in Israel . Rabin has said he would submit such an agreement to a referendum and would go_through with it only if he wins the support of a majority of the Israeli public . Underscoring the constraints under which Rabin must operate , Benjamin Netanyahu , head of the opposition Likud Party , flew to Washington on Wednesday to deliver a message that Rabin has no mandate to even talk_about surrendering any part of the Golan . Netanyahu , Israel ' s top negotiator in the Likud-led government of former Prime_Minister Yitzhak Shamir , said Rabin ' s offer of a plebiscite on a peace agreement is not enough . He demanded that Rabin call new elections , in which Likud would campaign on a platform of refusing to give_up the Golan . He predicted that Syria eventually will agree to make_peace without getting_back the plateau -- a view clearly not shared by Rabin or the Clinton_Administration .</TEXT>
