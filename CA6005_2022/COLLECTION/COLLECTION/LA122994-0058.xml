   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO ; MIRACLE_WORKERS ' COMEUPPANCE ; THE PESO WAS OVERDUE FOR ADJUSTMENT , BUT THE ZEDILLO TECHNOCRATS ' OVERCONFIDENCE TURNED A NUDGE INTO A FREE FALL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the Mexican_peso plummeted over the past week , U.S. activists who had opposed the North_American Free_Trade Agreement alternated between crying &quot; foul &quot; and boasting &quot; I told you so. &quot; Congress , after all , had been sold NAFTA based on the allure of rising exports to our southern neighbor ; a cheapened peso now threatens to slow the U.S. export boom , make Mexican workers even more competitive and further threaten American wages and jobs . But it is not just the United States suffering from peso shock . A key element in maintaining support for NAFTA in Mexico was the connection of trade liberalization to the peso ' s stability . The reason was straightforward : The Mexican inflation-fighting &quot; miracle &quot; of the past six years was based on the coupling of unilateral reductions in trade_barriers with a relatively fixed currency , which insured that imports could act_as a sort of ceiling on domestic price hikes . The results were nothing short of spectacular : a decline in inflation from nearly 160 % in 1987 to less than 10 % this year . Many small and medium-size Mexican industrialists who felt battered by the increased international competition nonetheless welcomed the return to macroeconomic stability . Devaluation , however , was always a real possibility . Between 1987 and 1993 , exports grew by around 50 % while imports quadrupled . Trade and current_account deficits skyrocketed to levels not seen since before the 1982 debt crisis , and the peso was more overvalued than it had been in 1981 . The government ' s technocrats dismissed worries about the peso ' s sustainability , arguing that the demand for Mexican currency was driven by investors eager to crowd into the newly stable economy . But the vast bulk of &quot; investment &quot; involved the return of flight capital and purchases in the Mexican stock_market , and the sudden collapse in the dollar value of these assets is likely to chase many skittish investors right back_out . This complicates a Mexican political scene already staggered by the effects of the renewed fighting in Chiapas . The almost 40 % decline in the peso will soon translate into higher prices , and the clamor for compensating wages will feed the inflationary_spiral . Exorbitant interest_rates , jacked upward to reflect the new currency risk , will stifle domestic investors ' plans . As the economy slows and the government is forced to tighten its purse-strings , the promises of the last electoral season -- that in 1995 , economic prosperity would finally trickle down to the poor -- are likely to be broken . Why did newly inaugurated President Ernesto Zedillo chose a course seemingly designed to alienate the wealthy , frustrate the poor and reduce the purchasing power of Mexico ' s growing middle_class ? He decided to loosen the government ' s reins on the sorely overvalued peso , hoping for a soft landing , a nudge downward that could be blamed squarely on the Zapatista rebellion . But when the peso went_into a free fall , investors felt betrayed by the government , not Subcomandante Marcos , and their run toward the dollar pushed the peso to unexpected lows . Zedillo ' s miscalculation was partly rooted in the excessive confidence of the technocrats : Having managed both an end to inflation and a history-defying free-trade pact with the United States , they valued textbook economic_theory over political wisdom . The miscalculation also reflects the new president ' s attempt to both embrace and break free_of the legacy of his mentor , former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari : Zedillo wanted to begin his administration with a bold charge in a new direction , just as Salinas did_in 1988 ; unlike Salinas , Zedillo chose a policy destined to weaken his hand . The political fallout is just beginning . One poll last week reported that 89 % of the public sees little or no hope of economic improvement in the coming year . The head of Mexico ' s major business federation has called_on Zedillo to develop a new economic plan , signaling the erosion of support for a government that Salinas taught business to love . What should the United States do ? The Clinton_Administration has reactivated a $ 6-billion credit_line , which gives the Mexican government additional monies to support the peso . There is little else to do now but wait -- and begin to worry about other Latin_American reformers , such_as Argentina and Peru , that have taken a similar policy tack with_regard_to unilateral trade liberalization , overvalued currency and the pursuit of free-trade pacts with the United States . As the second act of the Mexican &quot; miracle &quot; unfolds , its missteps of recent weeks are warnings for Latin_America ' s future .</TEXT>
