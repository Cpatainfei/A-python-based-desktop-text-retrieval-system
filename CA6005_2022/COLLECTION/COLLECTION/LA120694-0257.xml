   <HEADLINE> SCIENCE ; FATE OF INDIAN BURIAL RESEARCH HANGS BY A HAIR ; DNA TESTING OF A SINGLE STRAND IS HALTED AFTER NATIVE_AMERICANS CLAIM IT FALLS UNDER ACT THAT PROTECTS HUMAN REMAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An archeological breakthrough that could help answer some of the oldest and most perplexing questions about human history has been stopped_dead in its tracks by a strict interpretation of recent legislation designed to protect the sanctity of ancient burial_grounds . And archeologist Robson Bonnichsen of Oregon State University believes the issue could eventually shut_down many excavation sites in North_America and threaten scores of other federally funded projects . Bonnichsen is_on the cutting edge of a technology that could answer such basic questions as where the first inhabitants of North_America came from and how they migrated across this continent and into South_America . The key to solving this mystery , which has bedeviled scientists , has been around for thousands of years and was literally right under the feet of archeologists . It is human hair , preserved in the mud and clay into which it was shed . And until Bonnichsen recently began subjecting ancient hair samples to DNA analysis , no one realized its importance . DNA , which carries the genetic blueprint for every living organism , could offer scientists the best opportunity they have ever had to trace human history back through time . A single hair could contain enough DNA to reveal the ethnic origin -- and thus the cultural history -- of someone who crossed the Bering land bridge from Siberia to North_America more_than 12 # 000 years ago as part of the first settling of the Americas , Bonnichsen said . That is why archeologists around the world were electrified earlier this year by Bonnichsen ' s announcement that he and his colleagues had managed to extract DNA from an ancient human hair found in a site in southwestern Montana . Although his work is in its embryonic stage , the announcement was heralded as a breakthrough . However , as he cradled a single strand of human hair in surgically gloved hands at his laboratory here recently , he told of a chain of events that has -- at least for now -- curtailed his research . The federal Bureau of Land Management , which controls the desolate region near Dillon , Mont. , where Bonnichsen has been excavating , has rescinded his permit to work_at the site and ordered him to return the human hair for burial by Native_Americans who inhabit the area . At issue is the Native_American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 , a federal law designed to protect the privacy and sanctity of burial_grounds . Two Montana tribes , the Kootenai-Salish and the Shoshone-Bannock , appealed_to the bureau on the grounds that human hair is covered by the act , and thus subject_to protection and repatriation . Bonnichsen , who is director of the university ' s Center for Study of the First Americans , scoffs at that contention -- claiming that human hair is shed naturally throughout a person ' s lifetime and that the law was not intended to include naturally shed human products . &quot; We don ' t think that human hair that was naturally shed in life has anything to do with this act , &quot; he said . He and attorney Alan L . Schneider of Eugene , Ore. , have petitioned the federal_government to make_sure that regulations now being developed reflect that . Top federal_officials seem to agree with that position , including Francis P . McManamon , chief archeologist for the National_Park_Service who is directing the formulation of the new regulations . McManamon said hair that is not found in association with human remains and was apparently shed during life should not be included under the act . Montana ' s Native_Americans strongly disagree . &quot; Under the law , if it ( hair ) is found in an archeological complex , it is a human remain , &quot; said Karen Atkinson , attorney for the Kootenai-Salish tribe . Atkinson said her people asked the BLM to rescind Bonnichsen ' s permit earlier this year after they discovered that he had been excavating the area for nine years . Under federal law , she said , the bureau is required to consult with Native_Americans in the area before granting a permit , and that had not been done . The presence of human hair in the site , she added , further strengthens the tribes ' position . In the meantime , Gary Smith , the Bureau of Land Management ' s archeologist in Montana , is left in the hot_seat , trying to mediate . Smith is the man who shut_down Bonnichsen ' s site , although he says the archeologist ' s failure to complete some required reports and the tribes ' overall objections to the excavation also figured into that decision . Armed only with proposed regulations published in the Federal Register on May 28 , 1993 , Smith said he had no choice but to agree with the Native_Americans . Those regulations define human remains as &quot; including but not limited to bones , teeth , hair , ashes or mummified or otherwise preserved soft tissues of a person of Native_American ancestry. &quot; Bonnichsen and his center have asked that final regulations exclude &quot; naturally shed &quot; human hair , but Atkinson said that would not resolve the conflict . The law specifies that human remains are protected , and she maintains that human hair is clearly a human remain . Any attempt to change that in the regulations could lead to a legal challenge . For Bonnichsen , the quandary goes_far beyond the importance of his single site . &quot; Hair is the artifact that human_beings produce the most of , &quot; he said . It apparently is easily preserved by nature , so it is probably present in many if not most archeological sites . If it is classified as a human remain , all sites with hair in them , in_effect , would be considered burial_sites , curtailing archeological research , Bonnichsen said . The impact could also extend_to other projects , he added . If a soil engineer finds a hair in his sample , &quot; he ' s got a problem. &quot; Bonnichsen said he was just starting to make_headway when his project was halted . Much remains to be understood about how much the presence of human hair can tell us , but he is convinced his work will enrich the understanding of human history . It came_about almost by accident . Bonnichsen was working_at his Montana site in 1986 when one of his colleagues picked_up a rock and noticed what appeared to be a hair on it . The short strand appeared ancient , Bonnichsen said . It was sent_off to Pennsylvania State University , where molecular biologists subjected it to DNA analysis . It was , in fact , a human hair . Although that particular sample had been contaminated by the man who picked it up , the results convinced Bonnichsen that he had come_across a valuable tool . He teamed_up with Marvin Beatty , dean of the college of agriculture at the University of Wisconsin , to take the project a step further . Beatty developed a technique for separating hair from soil by immersing the soil in water and floating the hair to the surface . The solution is passed_through a fine screen that traps the hair . &quot; So we started a major flotation operation , &quot; Bonnichsen said . The results were startling . Almost every bucket of soil produced at least one hair . It may tell a great story , he said , by allowing scientists to trace the genetic history of a single group of early Americans , or even answer health and nutrition questions about those who passed_by so_long ago . It also holds the promise of enhancing the reliability of dates for archeological sites . The age of hair can be determined relatively precisely by examining it in a particle_accelerator , which determines the ratio of carbon isotopes that decay at known rates . Erwin Taylor , chairman of the department_of_anthropology at UC Riverside , used his university ' s accelerator to date hair from a New Mexico site at 12 # 000 years old . It requires several hairs to make a sample large enough to carry_out the dating , thus increasing the chances of error , but Taylor said he and his colleagues have made so_much progress in recent weeks that that could soon change . Dating of &quot; a single strand of hair is not too far off , &quot; he added . Bonnichsen believes the new technique will be particularly helpful in determining which early Americans inhabited which sites , where they came from and how they migrated across the continent . But now he fears he may never get the chance . &quot; This thing could kill it , &quot; he said . &quot; The whole effort could be snuffed out. &quot; Excavation Site DNA taken from a human hair excavated at a site near Dillon , in desolate southwestern Montana , could provide a genetic history_lesson on the region . But federal authorities revoked the permit allowing work_on the site , based on laws protecting Native_American burial_grounds .</TEXT>
