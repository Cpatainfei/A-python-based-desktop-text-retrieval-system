   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; MAKING IT LEGAL ; DRIVE-THROUGH NEWLYWEDS GET COURT OK TO FORGET PAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Frustrated trying to end her last marriage , a Santa Clarita woman went_ahead and married her boyfriend late Friday at a Las Vegas drive-in wedding chapel before her divorce was final . Instead of honeymoon bliss , the couple spent the weekend worrying whether they were bigamists . Not to worry , a judge said Monday . &quot; we ' ll take_care of it , &quot; Supervising Judge Judith Ashmann of the North Valley District of Superior_Court said during a call to The Times . Ashmann signed papers Monday that dated the woman ' s legal divorce as of last Friday . &quot; I wish I had realized this before we went_to Las Vegas , &quot; said the bride , Laura Molidor , 30 . Her new husband , James Linder , 34 , agreed , saying there had been &quot; a cloud hanging over us &quot; until they learned of the judge ' s action Monday . Now , the couple said , they can enjoy their long-scheduled reception for 75 friends and family this weekend , before moving to their new home_in Utah . Molidor said that she was assured by her attorney in early September that her uncontested divorce would become final in four to six weeks . But last week , as her husband-to-be moved from Texas to join her here , her attorney ' s office told her the courts were slow in processing the papers . However , her divorce papers filed on Sept . 26 were rejected because they were completed incorrectly , according to John O ' Brien , court clerk . The papers were resubmitted Oct . 19 by the office of her attorney , James Reape of Santa Clarita . Molidor , who separated from her first husband four years ago , said her attorney did not tell her that the papers had to be resubmitted . A spokeswoman for the attorney said that Reape declined to comment unless he had permission from his client , who was in transit in the late afternoon . Molidor said earlier that she and her new husband were going_to her old husband ' s house in Palmdale on Monday so she could accompany their two children trick-or-treating on Halloween night . Linder planned to watch football on television with Molidor ' s first husband . And about that drive-in wedding chapel : They exchanged vows while sitting in their car for the 10-minute ceremony Friday night as the minister leaned out the window . &quot; I was sure they were going_to hand_out French fries and a Coke along with the marriage_license , &quot; said Molidor .</TEXT>
