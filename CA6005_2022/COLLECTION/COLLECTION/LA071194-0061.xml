   <HEADLINE> NEPAL ' S LEADER RESIGNS AFTER POLITICAL DEFEAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Girija Prasad Koirala , Nepal ' s first democratically elected leader in three decades , resigned Sunday after losing a vote_in Parliament . His resignation set the stage for new parliamentary elections that will test the 3-year-old democracy . The political crisis was rooted in factional fighting within the governing Nepali Congress Party , but it also reflected frustration with Koirala ' s failure to make_headway against Nepal ' s poverty , illiteracy and underdevelopment . Koirala , 70 , submitted his resignation to King Birendra after members of his party helped vote_down the government ' s annual policy statement . The prime_minister recommended that Parliament be dissolved and elections held Nov . 13 . A general_election had not been_due until 1996 . There was no immediate statement from the palace . Koirala came_to power in 1991 in this Himalayan kingdom ' s first multi-party elections in 30 years after street demonstrations forced Birendra to become a constitutional monarch . Though he took some measures to modernize and liberalize the economy , Nepal remains one of the world ' s poorest countries , with a per capita income of $ 180 and an infant_mortality_rate of nearly one in 10 . Nearly three people in four cannot read or write . The opposition Communists accuse Koirala ' s government of complicity in the deaths of two of its most charismatic leaders in a car accident in May , 1993 . The motion Sunday lost 86 to 74 in the 205-seat lower house when 36 Nepali Congress Party members abstained .</TEXT>
