   <HEADLINE> UP AGAINST THE WALL ; FOR THE ARTISTS OF BERLIN , THE WALL NEVER REALLY FELL . AND AS THE ART SCENE MOVES EAST , ENVY AND CONTEMPT HEAT UP A STRANGE COLD_WAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Back when life had a taste and texture , back when it had a spirit and a rhythm of its own , then Rainer Tschernay could create . Back when he didn ' t have to sell his paintings , back before money , money , money became the point to everything , then he could work_on his crude sculptures in his East Berlin studio . He could draw and paint landscapes . Then he could see clearly . Back before the Wall came_down . Before the Wall came_down , &quot; Raw &quot; Warzecha had found his niche . Back when West_Berlin ' s Kreuzberg was an island of Turkish immigrants and punk artists near the Wall and nobody cared if you owned a building or just lived_in it ; back before the Frankfurt suits came_with their bulging wallets and the Wall was an immutable fact of life , then he could paint . Now , it ' s not so easy . Now the abandoned buildings , the squats , are disappearing ; rents have gone_through the roof , everybody ' s fighting eviction and the art scene has moved to East Berlin . Who has the head , really , for art ? Yes , it was certainly better before the Wall came_down . &quot; When the Wall fell , I had the feeling that they just opened the zoo . That there were all these wild animals on the street , &quot; says Christopher , a 33-year-old west_Berliner who hangs_out with the Dead Chickens , a &quot; Wessie &quot; cyberpunk performance art group . He recalls how the &quot; Ossies &quot; jammed the center of west_Berlin , gaping at the wealth of a consumer society . Christopher , who makes crude handcrafted jewelry and will not give his last_name because he hates his father , has met his cousins in east Berlin only once since 1989 . He can ' t relate . Neither can his friends , the Dead Chickens . They are a hot young group on the West_Berlin scene , exhibiting their monster-sculptures in the prestigious Raab Gallery and performing in art festivals around Europe . They make wild , horrifying costumes that move mechanically and explode on computer-controlled cue and ooze blood , brains and green liquid while they play ear-splitting noise . Very underground . Very subculture . You know : nukes and punks and heavy black make-up . Very , very Berlin . Like many artists from West_Berlin , including Warzecha , the Dead Chickens were evicted from their squat in Kreuzberg , which is now an area of prime real_estate . As Kreuzberg becomes yuppified , artists have increasingly moved down-market , to the east . You might think that the Dead Chickens would have found kindred spirits among the young , anti-art artists of the East , particularly since the Dead Chickens now work in a huge basement in East Berlin . But the Dead Chickens find East Berlin ' s subculture . . . boring . Dated . &quot; Pathetic , &quot; says Breeda C.C. ( her only name ) , an artist who creates many of the Dead Chickens ' costumes . &quot; Some of the artists I find very slow , I must say . Their films are slow , very -- poetic , very heavy . Full of senses , slow , gray . I can ' t explain it . Too heavy , &quot; she says . &quot; Hyper-political , &quot; says Nils Peters , 26 , another Dead Chicken . &quot; What we do , it ' s more sarcastic , &quot; Breeda insists . &quot; What they do is very serious . I saw this performance art in Dresden -- you know , people sitting around a fire wearing bandages , eating mushrooms. &quot; She rolls her eyes . &quot; It was so . . . &quot; pause . . . &quot; depressing. &quot; LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS CONFUSED , CHAOTIC , work-in-progress of a city , the artists in east and west_Berlin do not get_along . The don ' t mingle with their formerly inaccessible peers , they don ' t share or hang_out or communicate . There ' s no connection . Four years after reunification , Germany finds itself plunged deep in economic recession , battling record postwar unemployment -- 16 % in the east -- and struggling to comprehend a frightening resurgence of violent fascism among its restive youth . It is perhaps no surprise , then , that the chasm between east and west Germans is as wide as it was before the heady , history days of November , 1989 , when they were no longer divided by cement and electrified wire . But here in Berlin -- with its centuries of collected artistic wealth , with its historic role as a haven for painters , musicians , actors and the avant_garde and its ever-vibrant cultural scene ( no less than two orchestras , three operas and about 50 cabarets ) -- the division seems odd . Artists , a group you might suppose to be curious or at least non-judgmental , grumble and snipe and criticize each other . Instead of exploring what_for so_long was just out_of_reach , they have turned_in on themselves , living -- as much as possible -- as they did before the Wall came_down , in enclaves , in cocoons of friends , contacts and odd exhibition spaces . Like other Germans confronting the sudden end of decades of division , the artists of east and west_Berlin regard one another -- for the most part -- with mistrust and distaste and contempt . &quot; It ' s two extremes meeting , &quot; says Pontus Carle , a Swedish painter who frequently exhibits and sells his work in both east and west Germany . In the east , he says , the artists work more intuitively -- a function , perhaps , of having lived under a state that judged art for its political correctness rather than its quality , while in the west a more rational , capitalistic mind-set prevailed . &quot; In the east , the problem was freedom , not competition , &quot; he says . &quot; In the west , you would never want to introduce a fellow artist to a collector -- there ' s always competition. &quot; For many westerners , it is a question of experience . Sure , they were interested in East Berliners at first , but then they found that beyond a superficial common_ground -- language , nationality , age -- what did they share , really ? What could they learn from those who were so isolated so_long from Western culture ? Many say that they find their eastern artistic peers to be dated , provincial , extremely defensive and unjustifiably lofty . For many easterners , it is a question of money . Money that no longer comes so easily . Money that westerners flaunt with such arrogance . Money they are embarrassed and resentful that they need , now that state-guaranteed employment is a thing of the past . But there is more . Oh , say the east Berliners , those smug , superior Wessies . Oh , their commercial disposable , superficial art . The art that easterners created during their isolation was , they feel , purer somehow . Undiluted . Conversations with dozens of east Berlin artists share this common undertone : Whatever they gained in freedom of movement and conscience with the fall of the Wall , they say , they lost in freedom from worry over income , competition and output . &quot; When the Wall was up , this was a creative island . I had nothing to do with the Stalinists and one could concentrate_on art and poetry , &quot; says Maximilian Barck , an intense 31-year-old east Berliner who publishes art books and heads an artists ' group called Herzattacke ( Heart_Attack ) . &quot; In the last 10 years of the GDR ( German Democratic Republic ) there was a vacuum ; there wasn ' t much pressure from the state . West_Berlin artists had to pay rent for an apartment , studio , sell paintings . We didn ' t have that fear . We had free_time ; we were autonomous. &quot; Barck is the epitome of the east_German intellectual , spewing references_to French philosopher Michel Foucault , Canadian writer Marshal McLuhan and Austrian painter Edward Munch in a single phrase , raging something about &quot; mystical post-structural thinkers &quot; and categorically condemning the ethic of profit and consumption that dominates the art world he discovered in 1989 . In a torrential discourse , he makes distinction between real artists -- like himself and a_few , rare others that he has met from the West -- and the mass of Western artists who , in his view , rack empty brains and emptier souls for salable ideas . To him , their work isn ' t art at all , it ' s a corrupt product of market capitalism . &quot; We have gone from the dictatorship of Stalinism to the dictatorship of money , &quot; he says , chain-smoking in a book-lined study of his sunny apartment . &quot; It ' s a question of which one you can get_away from more easily. &quot; Before 1989 , Barck was officially a philosophy student , and worked a_few hours a week at a pet store . Otherwise he consecrated himself to art . Then he paid 100 ostmarks ( about $ 25 ) for the spacious apartment that housed his family . Now , Barck spends much of his creative time hustling his work , and he can barely afford the rent -- 650 deutsche_marks , about $ 360 -- for the same apartment but has at least found a benefactor -- from West_Berlin -- for Herzattacke . Rainer Tschernay is one of those artists . He wanders in , mid-conversation , barefoot , his face barely visible beneath a halo of shoulder-length frizz , glasses and a beard , sits_down and helps himself to a cigarette . He is right at_home . that ' s one thing about the art community in East Berlin : It is a community . There is an easy generosity and a camaraderie that seems to have long disappeared from society in the West . &quot; In West Germany art has a different concept ; the attitude is one of producing art for money . They produce art to be sold , &quot; says Tschernay , who used to teach art in his spare_time , back when he had spare_time . &quot; Whereas in the east , by concentrating_on art , by remaining true_to our work , groups like Herzattacke have brought new ideas to the market. &quot; He says categorically : &quot; Eastern art has more integrity than Western art. &quot; BUT IS IT ANY GOOD ? Well , that depends_on whom you ask . If they often paint in the dark palette and aggressive brush strokes of German expressionism , east Berlin artists tend to follow two stylistic schools , abstract_expressionism and expressive-style figurative painting . There are few other genres . A glance at catalogues and art_galleries around the eastern part of the city shows that conceptual art -- art as an idea or a point_of_view rather than a creation -- never penetrated the Berlin Wall , and that the media and technology revolution that informed so_much of contemporary art in Western Europe and America over the past 20 years never came_to the east . More important , perhaps , east_Germany ' s generous social conditions -- despite the repressive political situation -- allowed many mediocre artists to pursue their work in blithe ignorance of their talent , or lack thereof . Tschernay , who is now painting rainbow-colored abstract canvases and making sculptures out of objects like GDR matchboxes , would n ' t last long in a truly competitive artistic environment . And indeed , he may_not . That may explain -- but perhaps doesn ' t excuse -- the attitude of some west_Berliners . &quot; When I go_to the underground ( east Berlin ) galleries , 95 % of the stuff is just shit , 5 % is OK and even then I don ' t know if ( the artists ) have a chance , &quot; says Volcker Diehl , the owner of an exclusive gallery just off West_Berlin ' s Kufurstendamm , the fashionable shopping district . Diehl shows top-rated international artists such_as Markus Lupertz , Helmut Middendorf and John Noel Smith . He still visits galleries in east Berlin , though not as often as he did just after the fall of the Wall . &quot; Some of it is just badly made ; there is no idea of form , color and composition . They have no idea of a line in_relation_to two points , up or down , &quot; he says . &quot; Or else it ' s just a copy . Sometimes I ' ll see something fresh , original -- it won ' t change the world , I don ' t expect an artists to change the world tomorrow -- but I expect something authentic and personal . Then I can respect it. &quot; Diehl picks_up a recent catalogue of work by Herzattacke artists . &quot; For instance , &quot; he says , pointing to a geometric design , &quot; this looks_like Vasarely. &quot; He flips to a page of brown-and-black abstract images . &quot; This looks_like Kandinsky . It ' s pretty horrible , &quot; He turns the page to an unsigned drawing of a crucifix , and eye , a moon . &quot; This is really bad , &quot; he groans . &quot; This composition is really horrible . It ' s so obvious -- a moon , death , with an eye on top . It ' s like -- oh God -- this is for someone who ' s 15. &quot; Artists who long ago defected to the West from the former East_Germany tend to be even harsher in their judgments . The most successful among them -- Anselm Kiefer , Georg Baselitz or R.L. Penck -- have become giants in the contemporary art world . Baselitz , whose exhibit at New York ' s Museum of Modern Art opened in December and who recently had a show at the Pompidou Center in Paris , left East Berlin in 1956 when he was in his 20s and the Communist regime was at its most doctrinaire . The Wall was not erected until 1961 , but Berlin was divided by armed guards and barbed wire . In his youth , Baselitz says , he could paint only what the state ordered , could exhibit and sell only through official , state-run organizations . So he left . &quot; Artistically , it was a completely unreal situation , &quot; Baselitz says in a phone interview from his studio in Holle , near Hanover in western Germany . &quot; Everyone lived_off subsidies ; for an artist it is not good , this getting money without making an effort . Everything you earn should come from your work , &quot; he says . Baselitz is equally condemning of the young generation ' s work . &quot; It is impossible to compare them with what happened in France , the rest of Germany , or in America . They had nothing . No information , no material . How do you expect a young artist to create without having an idea of what is happening elsewhere ? &quot; Not everyone is so critical . Indeed , many artists , gallery owners and collectors in Germany say they expect the most interesting art in the coming years to come from places like east Berlin . The turmoil -- the shock of suddenly confronting everything in the Western world -- will certainly produce something exciting , particularly at a time when western cynicism over art seemingly reached its height . Like painter Klaus Killice , a 34-year-old east Berliner who since 1989 has devoured everything he can about the world he missed ; his work has evolved dramatically , and Germany ' s prestigious &quot; Art &quot; magazine recently named him among a handful of the country ' s most promising artists . But even among lesser east Berlin talents there is something of this new energy -- like there is in east Berlin society -- something that hints at raw emotion and internal chaos . Something immediate and personal and . . . wild . AN ENORMOUS , BLACKENED BUILDING with the odd sculptures on top dominates the skyline of Mitte -- literally &quot; middle &quot; -- a neighborhood of east Berlin that was once and soon will be again its business and commercial center . This hulking edifice -- Tacheles -- pulsates with sound from the street-level Keller Bar , where heavy metal music and heavier metal sculptures dominate the space . The sensations intensify as you walk up its four stories . Nearly every square_inch is covered in graffiti and sound emanates from everywhere and nowhere . The second floor has a large performance area , with bleacher-like seating and two-story walls covered , on this day , with blue , geometrical paintings ; someone is doing sound checks . On the third floor there are artists ' studios -- cubicles divided by crude wooden planks -- and their equally-spare apartments ; metallic dust and the sick whirring of an electric saw issues from one area , while the smell of spaghetti_sauce wafts , a_few feet away , from another . Next floor up is a loft-like exhibition space , on this day featuring the work of a Chilean artist , Juan Enrique Gabler : textured canvases in earth tones and collage-like works combining photos and debris . Tacheles is random and crude ; it embodies the chaos and the creativity of post-Wall east Berlin . Like everything else here , this building has a history . A luxury department_store in the 1920s , Tacheles was bombed during World_War_II and , like many buildings in east Berlin , never repaired . After 1989 , a_few artists came_to squat : painters , along with Berlin ' s classic assortment of musicians , punks and anarchists and who have similarly commandeered dozens of run-down buildings and apartments in the east . But Tacheles quickly became a real cultural center . It now gets city , state and European Union funding , though its future is far from guaranteed : The building occupies prime real_estate in east Berlin ' s burgeoning commercial center . An even more certain destruction awaits the area ' s other squats , city officials say , as Berlin prepares_for its new role as Germany ' s seat of government by the year 2000 . But for the moment , here is where it is happening , in Mitte , with its galleries and avant_garde restaurants , and farther_east in Prenzlauerberg , with its lofts , squats and neighborhood cafes . But isn ' t it odd ? These new east Berlin neighborhoods , pulsating the rhythm of change , have imposed their own kind of apartheid . Eigen und Art , a gallery owned by east_Germans on the trendy Auguststrasse , exhibits exclusively east_German artists . Kunstwerke , a west-owned gallery practically next door , exhibits and donates space exclusively to westerners , showcasing conceptual art . A few door down , Wohnmaschine exhibits Ossies ; across the street Kunstwerke ' s second building give space to Wessies . There are those who try to breach the persistent divide . Like Romen Banerjee , a talented , energetic young painter from west_Berlin who organizes group shows and tries to include eastern artists . He says : &quot; There is a west lobby and an east lobby and they don ' t trust each other . There are circles of people who help each other and they don ' t want to let others in , in east and west both. &quot; There ' s Laura Bruce , an American painter who was welcomed into an artist ' s compound in eastern Prenzlauerberg ; all her friends are east Berliners though her husband Edmond , an easy-going mathematician , is west German . &quot; I think that right now the interesting stuff is going_on in east Berlin . There is this incredible change , this incredible opening_up . But this transition period is really tough , &quot; she says , admitting that her neighbors are often circumspect around her husband . &quot; West and east -- they were taught they were each other ' s worst enemy for 40 years. &quot; So . It turns_out that 40 years does make a difference . It turns_out that decades of socialist and capitalist acculturation does establish different values , different expectations , different ways of thinking . It ' s not a question of habit and familiarity . Though it ' s that too . The fact is , they grew apart . Children were born and raised and knew_nothing but the Wall ; people died and were buried with their memories of another Berlin , Germany became two countries . Berlin became two cities ; West_Berlin , of despair and fear of nuclear holocaust . Punk , black city of cabaret and heavy metal . Graffiti , Pershings and John F . Kennedy . Art and avant_garde and anarchy . And then east Berlin , of neat streets , empty plazas , cool restraint and communism . Child_care and free abortion . Spies and swaps informers and defectors and Checkpoint Charlie . After 1989 , everyone was curious . Westerners ventured east , easterners explored the west , and all rejoiced at what they had in common . For a while . But slowly they also saw that their lives would have to change . Berlin would become a capital , and there would not be room for the draft-dodger or the jewelry-maker ; there would be bills -- big bills -- to pay and no more easy_money for the pet store poet . IT ' S ONLY 8:00 AND HALF OF THE ARTISTS FROM HERZATTACKE ARE already swaying unsteadily amid clouds of blue-gray smoke . This isn ' t that unusual -- they drink often and smoke always -- but in fact tonight is a special occasion , the first exhibit of the group ' s work in a brand new space donated by their west German benefactor , Peter Jander . A builder still in his 30s , Jander has made a fortune since 1989 redoing the ruined facades of east Berlin buildings , enough to take_over a block-long office and donate the first_floor to Barck and his buddies . Barck is ebullient , slapping backs and spouting verse ; Tschernay has donned shoes for the occasion . The show varies widely , both in_style and quality ; two rooms are devoted to Pontus Carle , the successful Swedish abstract expressionist , who befriended Barck , and another room to the promising work of an east Berlin abstract painter , Mikos Meininger . But another section displays surrealist paintings of birds and brain_stems by the easterner Thomas Weber that are technically solid , but unoriginal . They are surviving , the artists of Herzattacke , though not all have come_through this period unscathed . Klaus Bendler , a painter / photographer wrapped in an overcoat and an alcoholic fog , has twice attempted suicide since 1989 , the Barcks say . Once he tried to hang himself and Barck rushed to his apartment and cut him down . Everyone in east Berlin has heard of other successful suicides of artists and of others who -- in fearful panic -- destroyed all_of their work when the Wall came_down . Since the night of this opening , Bendler has checked_into the psychiatric wing of east Berlin ' s Charity Hospital . It has not been easy . &quot; Easterners have an inferiority_complex , &quot; says Swedish painter Carle . &quot; They have had a very hard_time dealing with the new situation : All the criteria , the frame_of_reference they had before has changed . They don ' t want to open_up to the west . On the other hand , it strikes me that in east Berlin there is a kind of closeness between artists that you don ' t see anymore in the west , &quot; he says . &quot; This western style of living -- we ' re not used to it , &quot; says Sybilla Barck , Maximilian ' s wife . &quot; We really think that in east Berlin there is more real art , with a base of expression . In the west , a painting may technically be very good , very chic , very modern . But it has no spirit. &quot; Western gallery owner Diehl scoffs at this attitude , but he doesn ' t write_off eastern artists indefinitely . &quot; It ' s difficult . I ' d say the chance that interesting , young , new art will start over there is much better than anywhere else in Germany . But if it will happen , we ' ll have to wait of a_couple_of years , &quot; Diehl says . It will take time , this reunificiation business . It will come_in increments ; it is already beginning . One of the Dead Chickens , Henryk Weiffenbach , has a girlfriend from east Berlin . A step . West_Berlin ' s Peter Jander has committed himself to investing in the artistic future of Herzattacke , whatever it may be . Another step . Andreas Rost , a sincere 27-year-old with some photos at the Herzattacke show , wants to study from photography experts in New York . It will take time . &quot; Everyone is afraid , in a certain sense . But we have to go_through it , we have to be stronger , I accept that , &quot; says Rost . &quot; I ' m living that right now . We always had a roof over our heads , something to eat . But we were in an ideological straitjacket . Our writers , our painters -- where are they ? &quot; he asks . &quot; Now we will see who is strong enough to make it. &quot;</TEXT>
