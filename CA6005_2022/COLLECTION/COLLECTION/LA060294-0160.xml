   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COVER STORY ; HOW TO START A NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So you hardly know your neighbors and you want to change all that , build a sense of community and camaraderie ? You ' re not alone.Neighborhoods USA is a national nonprofit organization formed in 1975 to build and strengthen neighborhood groups . Clifford Benedict , a member of the board of directors for the association , offers the following tips for starting your own neighborhood group . 1 . Identify why you want to start a neighborhood group . Crime prevention , beautification of the community and a need to unite and empower residents are three common reasons for starting an association . 2 . Start canvassing the neighborhood for members to join the association and to find_out what issues are important in the community . A priority should be working to build lasting friendships in the community and organizing the neighborhood into almost a family_unit . 3 . Hold a big meeting . Policy should be established at this first get-together : Will the association have officers -- a president , vice_president and treasurer ? How will the association raise funds ? How and where will meetings be conducted ? Will someone volunteer to mail_out agendas ? 4 . Once the association has been formed , find_out if your city has a neighborhood association outreach office . This office usually acts_as a liaison between city government and the associations and can provide helpful hints on a variety of topics , including the best way to approach the city_council . 5 . Once the association is_on its feet and growing , go national . Contact groups such_as Neighborhoods USA and begin attending conferences and meetings to discover new ways of solving community problems . For more information , call Benedict at ( 818 ) 351-1203 or write : Neighborhoods USA , Mid City Station , Box 307 , Dayton , Ohio 45402 .</TEXT>
