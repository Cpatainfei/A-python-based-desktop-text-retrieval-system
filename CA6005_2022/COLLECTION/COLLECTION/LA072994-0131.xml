   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS : DOLLAR RALLIES AGAINST YEN ; STOCKS RISE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar soared above the psychologically important 100 level against the Japanese yen for the first time in a month on growing expectations of a breakthrough in trade negotiations between the United States and Japan . Stocks , meanwhile , got a boost from falling bond yields , which benefited from the dollar ' s rally . U.S. and Japanese negotiators were scheduled to meet today for talks , ahead of the July 31 deadline Washington set for deciding whether to take steps toward trade sanctions . &quot; There is a suspicion in the market that there will potentially be an agreement before the deadline , &quot; said Peter Gloyne , vice_president and manager of institutional trading at First National_Bank of Chicago . A trade accord would help the dollar , which has suffered because of widespread belief that a cheaper U.S. currency would be the sole means of reducing the huge U.S.-Japan trade_gap should other methods fail . Currency dealers also attributed the dollar ' s new strength to technical factors_in an otherwise thin market . In New York , the dollar rose to 100.10 yen , up from 98.55 yen on Wednesday . It was the dollar ' s first close above the 100-yen mark since June 27 . The dollar also finished stronger against the German mark than it did Wednesday , closing at 1.591 marks , up from 1.574. On Wall_Street , the Dow Jones industrial average finished higher , although a strong rally faded near the end of the session as investors became nervous about today ' s release of gross_domestic_product data . The Dow closed_up 10.36 points at 3 # 730.83 , having pared a 21-point gain posted earlier in the session . In the broader market , advancing issues edged out decliners by 1 # 073 to 1 # 003 on the New York Stock_Exchange , with 246.56 million shares changing hands , down from 251.76 million on Wednesday . &quot; People are pretty much sitting on their hands waiting to see if the GDP number is at the blowout end of the range , &quot; said James Volk , head of equity trading at Jensen Securities . Economists had been predicting a 3.8 % increase in the nation ' s second-quarter GDP , but Bob Walberg , a stock analyst at MMS International in Chicago , said some now fear it could be more_than 6 % . &quot; People are afraid that if the numbers exceed expectations , that will lead Federal_Reserve to tighten &quot; interest_rates , Walberg said . Investors fear higher rates could choke_off the economic recovery and jeopardize corporate earnings for the third and fourth quarters . Stocks dipped at the open after the Labor_Department said new unemployment claims for last week fell 59 # 000 . Most economists had expected a more modest decline of 7 # 000 . But that data , which showed that the economy is unexpectedly robust , did not faze the bond market , where the rallying greenback helped Treasurys recover after a weak start . The 30-year bond yield finished the day at 7.55 % , down from the previous session ' s 7.61 % . Its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , rose 9 / 16 point , or $ 5.63 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . The dollar ' s strength was seen as positive for bonds because a stronger U.S. currency tends to help keep inflation pressures in check . In addition , foreign investors are more likely to buy dollar-denominated investments such_as Treasury_bonds in a rising-dollar environment . Also lending a degree of support to the fixed-income market was a report by the Conference Board that help-wanted advertising fell_in June , apparently an indication that employment was not as strong as indicated by the Labor_Department report . The advance in Treasury prices , in turn , set_off a rush to buy bonds from speculators who had placed_bets on a further decline in bond prices . These traders , called short sellers , had borrowed bonds early Thursday and then sold them immediately , hoping their value would decline . Among the market highlights : * Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing was up 1 1 / 8 at 52 1 / 2 . The company had reported record second-quarter profits on Wednesday . * General Motors record $ 1.9 billion second-quarter profits beat analysts ' forecasts . Its shares rose 3 / 8 to 50 1 / 4 . Ford Motor Co. , which reported solid earnings Wednesday , gained 5 / 8 to 31 . Chrysler edged_up 1 / 4 to 47 3 / 8 . * Wm . Wrigley Jr . Co. , which posted disappointing second quarter profits Wednesday , dropped 3 to 41 . * LDDS Communications gained 1 / 4 to 19 on a report that it was close to acquiring the Williams Cos . WilTel long-distance telephone business for $ 2.5 billion . Williams Cos. , whose stock was up 1 5 / 8 to 32 7 / 8 , declined comment on the report . * Wellpoint Health Networks tumbled 5 1 / 4 to 25 1 / 4 after its second quarter results fell below analysts ' forecasts . * Biogen Inc. was off 1 1 / 8 to 43 5 / 8 after it surged 15 1 / 4 Wednesday on news of promising results in a trial of its drug for treating multiple_sclerosis . Overseas markets were mixed . Tokyo ' s 225-share Nikkei average closed_up 110.62 points at 20 # 247.85 , and London ' s Financial Times 100-share average gained 13.6 points to finish 3 # 095.9. In Frankfurt , the DAX average ended down 17.63 points at 2 # 122.81. Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index closed_down 4.07 points at 2 # 429.15 , pressured by a drop_in Telefonos de Mexico .</TEXT>
