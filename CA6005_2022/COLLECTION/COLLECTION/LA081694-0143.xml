   <TEXT> Carlos the Jackal , one of the world ' s most notorious and elusive terrorists , was arrested in Sudan and extradited on Monday to France , where he faces two murder_convictions and more_than a dozen other charges stemming from a 20-year spree . &quot; Carlos is in the hands of French justice , to be tried_for his crimes , &quot; French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua declared Monday , hours after the 44-year-old prisoner arrived_at a military airport near Paris . Pasqua said Carlos is responsible_for 83 deaths worldwide , including at least 15 in France . The capture of Carlos , a Venezuelan whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez , raised fears of terrorist reprisals in France . Intelligence_agents blame him for some of the most audacious terrorist acts of the 1970s , including the 1972 massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics , the 1975 kidnaping of 11 ministers attending an OPEC meeting in Vienna and the 1976 hijacking of an Air France jet to Uganda . While there was skepticism Monday about Carlos and the significance of his arrest , some analysts saw the decision by Sudan to give him up as a positive sign , reflecting the new peace process in the Middle_East , and , perhaps more important , a desire by the Sudanese to end their economic isolation and prove to potential aid donors that they no longer harbor terrorists . &quot; This is a very important moment , &quot; Pasqua told a news_conference . &quot; It is not in the tradition of Islamic believers to give_up one of their members , even if he is a terrorist . But here is a pure Islamic country that , in striking fashion , is breaking_off with terrorism. &quot; Sudan said its agents seized Carlos in a rented house Sunday and handed him to Interpol , the international police agency , for extradition . He was taken into custody by French agents upon arrival near Paris . French intelligence officials learned at the beginning of the year that Carlos might be in Sudan , traveling on a fake diplomatic passport . But it wasn ' t until Sunday that Sudan arrested him for &quot; suspicious activities &quot; and planning attacks against &quot; foreign installations &quot; in the country . Sudan did not specify those targets . &quot; Several times we got our hopes up that he was going_to be extradited , but several times we were disappointed , &quot; Pasqua said . &quot; ( Sunday ) morning , though , Sudan informed us that they had evidence this person was Carlos and that they were ready to extradite him. &quot; Pasqua said Carlos was questioned by Jean-Claude Bruyere , the_French prosecutor specializing in terrorist crimes , and a French radio_station said he was later taken_to a prison in eastern Paris . Legal experts in France said that even though Carlos was convicted in 1992 of killing two French counterintelligence agents , he would probably have to be retried in that case . There was little doubt , though , that France will attempt to put Carlos on_trial . &quot; Up until now , France has given the impression that we have no memory , &quot; Pasqua said Monday . &quot; But we have shown today that one cannot kill a Frenchman with impunity. &quot; The arrest ended a long hunt for Carlos that had turned him into an almost mythical figure -- reportedly a cunning master of disguise who committed daring and bloody acts of terrorism while always eluding capture . Some of that notoriety stemmed from Carlos ' image as a flamboyant gunman with a taste for the good life and his catchy nickname , which he earned from British tabloids after the novel , &quot; Day of the Jackal , &quot; reportedly was found in one of his hide-outs . The Frederick Forsyth book is about an assassin , &quot; the Jackal , &quot; sent to kill French President Charles de Gaulle . Carlos had not been heard from in several years , and some intelligence_agents thought he might be dead . Still , his name continued to surface whenever terrorist attacks were investigated . And , in the 1990s , he was reported to be living_in Damascus as a guest of the Syrian government . David Yallop , author of a 1993 book on Carlos called &quot; To the Ends of the Earth , &quot; said he interviewed Carlos in Syria , where he was posing as a Mexican businessman and living with his wife , German extremist Magdalena Kopp , and their two children . Yallop is among those who have questioned the Carlos myth , suggesting that , in reality , the terrorist was &quot; a would-be revolutionary of gross incompetence &quot; who often killed in panic . The author said the myth of Carlos was created by American , French and British intelligence_agents who wrongly identified him as a KGB agent . Alain Maraud , a former head of the_French intelligence service , said the arrest &quot; is either going_to show that Carlos was a myth or a criminal . We never really knew the answer . But now this is a new page in the fight against terrorism. &quot; Alexandre de Marenches , another former French secret_service chief who led an unsuccessful mission to find Carlos in 1986 , told French television : &quot; It was a long chase and it ' s very good news. &quot; The son of a wealthy Communist lawyer in Venezuela , Carlos joined the Communist students ' movement in the streets of Caracas and later received guerrilla training in Cuba . The Venezuelan Communist_Party sponsored him at Lumumba University in Moscow , where many Third_World nationals were selected by the KGB for training as Soviet agents . While there , Carlos came_in contact with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , which he joined in 1970 . Since then , he has been linked with various terrorist groups , including Germany ' s Baader-Meinhof gang , the Turkish Popular Liberation Front , the Japanese Red Army , the Basque separatist movement in Spain and various other Palestinian organizations . Accusations against Carlos range from organizing the Japanese Red Army occupation of the_French Embassy in The Hague in December , 1974 , a rocket attack on an Israeli plane at Paris ' Orly airport and plots to assassinate business and political_leaders . Israeli officials have said they do not believe he had a role in the 1972 Munich Olympics hostage drama , though other intelligence officials still consider Carlos a suspect in that case . But there ' s no question that , on Dec . 21 , 1975 , Carlos and his squad of Palestinian and West German extremists shot their way into the offices of the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries in the Austrian_capital during a ministerial meeting . Three people , including an Austrian police_officer , were killed and , after a fierce gun battle , the terrorists secured control of the office , kidnaped the ministers and demanded a $ 1-billion ransom . Calling themselves &quot; The Arm of the Arab Revolution , &quot; they demanded a bus to take them with their hostages to a plane at the airport , a demand the Austrians agreed to . They flew first to Algiers where most of the hostages were released , then to the Libyan capital , Tripoli , and eventually to Algiers , where they gave themselves up . They were allowed to go free within a_few days . The hostage drama ended a six-month saga that had begun in Paris , where Carlos killed two French counterintelligence agents and an accomplice who had turned informer . The agents had been investigating attacks on the Israeli planes in Paris . ( Carlos was sentenced in absentia in 1992 to life in prison for killing the_French agents. ) In March , 1982 , Carlos threatened to strike against the_French government unless it freed two of his agents , Bruno Breguet , a Swiss , and Kopp , the German who later became Carlos ' wife . The threat was contained in a letter bearing his fingerprints , verified by French police . Later that month , a bomb exploded aboard the Paris-Toulouse express , killing six people and wounding 15 . The French blamed Carlos . A month later , a bomb exploded in a rush-hour crowd just off the Champs Elysees , killing a pregnant woman and wounding 63 other people . And , on New Year ' s Eve , 1983 , bombs exploded in Marseilles ' main railroad_terminal and on the Paris-Marseilles express , killing five people and wounding 50 . Kopp and Breguet were released in May , 1985 . U.S. officials say Carlos was in Sudan with a woman using a Jordanian passport whom he said was his wife . But she appeared not to be Kopp . The woman ' s identity was unclear . Times staff writer Kim Murphy in Cairo contributed to this report . Trail of the Jackal Some of the major terrorist attacks of 1970s and 1980s have been attributed to Carlos , known as &quot; The Jackal &quot; : 1972 Intelligence reports link him to the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Summer Olympics in Munich . 1973 Wounding of British millionaire Edward Sieff , a Jew whose family owns Marks &amp; Spencers stores in London . 1974 Takeover of the_French Embassy in The Hague . 1975 Killing of two French intelligence_agents who were investigating attacks on planes of Israel ' s El Al airlines at Paris ' Orly Airport .
