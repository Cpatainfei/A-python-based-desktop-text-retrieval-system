   <TEXT> The Security_Council welcomed the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to Haiti on Saturday by lifting its crippling sanctions against the Caribbean nation . The vote was 14 in favor with one abstention , Brazil . &quot; Our hopes and our prayers are with the people of Haiti as they begin to rebuild their country , &quot; U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright told the council . &quot; To the people of Haiti we say : We are with you and we will help you. &quot; Security_Council President David Hannay of Britain said sanctions would be lifted at 12:01 a.m. today . &quot; Now that President Aristide has returned to Haiti , sanctions will be lifted , &quot; the resolution said . The council &quot; expresses its confidence that the people of Haiti can now rebuild their country with dignity and consolidate democracy , &quot; the resolution said . It also reaffirmed &quot; the willingness of the international community to provide assistance to the people of Haiti. &quot; Aristide returned to Haiti on Saturday after three years and 15 days in exile . The council said Sept . 29 that the sanctions would be lifted as soon as Aristide returned to power . The United Nations imposed sanctions against Haiti in June , 1993 , and tightened them four months later , measures aimed at forcing military rulers from power . The sanctions barred all oil shipments and trade with Haiti except food , medicine and humanitarian supplies . The sanctions also limited travel_to and from Haiti and froze overseas assets of Haiti ' s military_leaders and their families . Haiti ' s army rulers resigned last week under a Sept . 18 agreement negotiated by a mission led by former President Jimmy_Carter . The accord helped forestall an imminent U.S. invasion and led to the peaceful deployment of U.S. troops in Haiti on Sept . 19 . The council had voted July 31 to authorize the use of force to oust the Haitian military and restore Aristide to power . Brazil abstained on that vote , saying it could not agree to the use of force . It abstained again on Saturday ' s vote saying that approving the resolution would give tacit endorsement to the U.S. intervention in Haiti . A 6 # 000-member U.N. peacekeeping force is expected to replace U.S. soldiers in Haiti in the coming months .</TEXT>
