   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA ' S NEW PARLIAMENT OFF TO A WILD START</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The wild scrum around ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky trashed the cloakroom . An accused coup plotter was proposed as Speaker . And goggle-eyed deputies , appalled at the new levels of legal chaos , compared their new forum to a psychiatric ward . But all_in all , Russia ' s second attempt in recent history to launch a parliamentary_democracy got_off to a tolerable start Tuesday as its new lawmakers , elected last month in the country ' s first true multi-party balloting , opened their first session . &quot; For the first time ever , Russia has achieved accord on the rules and norms that are a must for all political forces , &quot; President Boris N . Yeltsin told deputies . &quot; We must preserve this for the sake of national peace and to make_sure dictatorship never returns to Russia. &quot; In the Duma -- the lower , 450-seat chamber expected to be the feistier -- the first key vote brought good news for Yeltsin , indicating that although his opponents appear to hold a majority , they may_not be able to make_it work . Nationalist and Communist groups failed to ram through a procedural move_on the minimal size of factions and were forced to compromise with Yeltsin backers . Deputies have a strong incentive to accommodate Yeltsin . The building where the Duma met is still missing windows , blown_out in the battle over the Russian White_House that raged last fall . Yeltsin dissolved Parliament in September and routed his armed opposition in early October with troops and tanks . Mikhail Poltaranin , a close Yeltsin adviser , half-joked that at one point in the Duma session , he wanted to warn deputies that if they didn ' t shape_up , the division that backed Yeltsin still had plenty of tanks and shells left . But overall , Poltaranin was cheered by signs that the new opposition will be weaker than it had appeared : &quot; We didn ' t lose and we didn ' t win so the day is ours , &quot; he said . Lawmakers faced another specter designed to keep them in shape . Dapper in a dark , German-made suit and alligator belt , Zhirinovsky threatened to dominate the session , even going so far as_to make hand signals to the acting Speaker on how to put questions to the vote . Flanked by bodyguards , he created a rash of his now-familiar loudmouth scandals , beginning with the chaotic rush of cameramen that greeted his entrance , knocking_over tables and coatracks in the cloakroom . A neo-fascist who advocates Russian military expansion southward and a one-party dictatorship , Zhirinovsky shocked the world by winning nearly a quarter of the Russian vote among party lists in Dec . 12 elections . During the lunch break , he took swipes at Western leaders who have refused to meet him . He said it was &quot; very strange &quot; of President Clinton , who plans to snub him during this week ' s Moscow summit , to refuse to see a leading Russian opposition figure such_as himself . Commenting on French President Francois Mitterrand ' s proposals for intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina , Zhirinovsky said that &quot; in his dotage , he has gone crazy. &quot; More worrisome , however , were Zhirinovsky ' s open attempts to control the Duma through its chairman , Georgy Lukava , a civil aviation official and member of Zhirinovsky ' s misleadingly named Liberal Democratic Party . As the oldest member of the Duma , Lukava , 69 , was given the privilege of opening the session . But then , instead of passing his chairmanship on to an elected Speaker , he turned the discussion in other directions . Lukava -- who wore a pilot ' s uniform adorned with medals and who displayed a Soviet-era habit of calling deputies &quot; comrades &quot; -- kept his head cocked toward Zhirinovsky , who sent Lukava signals like a third-base coach on when to cut_off a discussion and when to continue it . When calls mounted for a new Speaker , Zhirinovsky snarled that Lukava would remain until a permanent Speaker was elected and ordered him to shut_off the hall ' s microphones . Deputies finally grew so incensed that they boycotted all voting -- thus paralyzing the Duma -- to demand Lukava be replaced . The boycott succeeded -- another victory for pro-Yeltsin deputies and a sign that they will not be as outnumbered as they had feared , and might even seek to control about half of the Duma . When Dec . 12 voting results first came_in , it had appeared that reformists could only count_on a quarter to a third of lawmakers . But many independents apparently voted with them Tuesday . But Yeltsin allies hoping to push ahead with reforms also must cope_with a Parliament thrown_back to square one on rules of order . Yeltsin scrapped parliamentary guidelines developed over recent years , leaving deputies with little more_than the new constitution and guesswork on how to run sessions . &quot; There are no documents but the constitution , that ' s why it ' s all I carry around with me , &quot; said Andrei Goltsblatt , a legal staffer at the Duma . &quot; There are no written rules , no procedures . All you can do is try to interpret the constitution . &quot; With the lack of rules , the Parliament can be turned_into Zhirinovsky ' s zombie , &quot; he said . &quot; He tells them how to vote and they do it. &quot; Zhirinovsky lost in his attempt to keep Lukava as Speaker , but the chaos did seem to be reaching alarming levels , with prolonged disputes over everything from the majority needed for a vote to pass to when to take a break . Andrei Makarov , of the pro-Yeltsin Russia ' s Choice bloc , walked_out at the day ' s end with a tortured look in his eyes and would say only , &quot; Psychiatric clinics have visiting days too. &quot; He added that a fellow Russia ' s Choice member who is a psychiatrist was_best suited for the deputy ' s job . Several of his colleagues also compared the Duma to a mental_hospital . The circus atmosphere reached a climax in the late afternoon when Lukava proposed that he give_up the chairmanship to Anatoly I . Lukyanov , the former chairman of the Soviet Parliament who is now on_trial for his alleged role in the August , 1991 , coup attempt against Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev . Lukyanov is a Duma deputy , as are such colorful figures as reactionary TV journalist Alexander Nevzorov , psychic healer Anatoly Kashpirovsky and weightlifting champion Yuri Vlasov . The upper chamber , the 178-seat Federation Council , roughly equivalent_to the U.S. Senate , lived_up_to expectations that it would be more staid -- and more efficient -- than the Duma . The council , meeting in quarters about a mile from the Duma ' s , whipped_through technical questions and had begun voting on its new Speaker by Tuesday evening , with one of Yeltsin ' s allies , First Deputy Prime_Minister Vladimir F . Shumeiko , the front-runner . The new Parliament met under a new state symbol -- the two-headed eagle -- and with a new name , the Federal Assembly . It has far fewer powers than its predecessor , which could change the constitution easily and ended_up blocking many of Yeltsin ' s attempts to move away from communism and toward private_property and a market-driven economy . Under the new constitution , Yeltsin has the right to dissolve the Duma under certain circumstances and work only with the Federation Council .</TEXT>
