   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN CHEF ; CUISINE AND MOI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The sun rises over Marseille . I am terrified . At 8:30 a.m. , I am to be in the kitchen of Le Petit Nice , where I , a young American cook with spotty French , am about to begin work . Or , to be exact , I am about to begin the_French rite of passage for cooks , the stage . All I know about my new life as a stagier , or apprentice , is that the hours will be long and the pay , well , zero . It ' s possible that I could spend most of my two-month stay in the basement peeling potatoes before I ' m allowed_in the kitchen , where the chef might very well crack me across the head for any culinary violation . Why put myself through such an ordeal ? At 15 I entered the restaurant business and realized right away that to excel I ' d have to follow the path of cuisine : work my way up from the bottom , all_the while gathering knowledge , honing skills , kissing a bit of proverbial butt and , ultimately , studying with the masters when -- and if -- the time should ripen . Eleven years later , with a smattering of French in my repertoire , I ' m as ready as I ' ll ever be . Oddly , the terror abates as the hour approaches . Practicing my opening_lines in French , I thread my way through the labyrinth of cobblestone and pastel back_streets that are Marseille . In due time I reach Le Petit Nice , the city ' s only two-star restaurant . Its white stucco balconies float over the royal_blue Mediterranean . Through large windows , the stainless-steel and the white tiles of the kitchen are visible , creating a fishbowl effect . I enter . The room is empty and silent save for the low hum of the ice box . A man dashes by , but before I can speak my opening_lines , he disappears . After 15 anxiety-ridden minutes , I spot a tall cook wearing whites and sporting a waxed handlebar mustache . I take_a_breath and recite my lines : &quot; Je m ' appelle Gavril Lourie . Je suis arrive pour fair un stage . &quot; He barely stops what he ' s doing , glances up at me , and says , &quot; How ' s your English ? &quot; Caught off_guard , I reply , &quot; Pretty good , I guess. &quot; &quot; Oh , you ' re American ! &quot; he says , introducing himself as Uwe , a German employed at the restaurant as a poissonnier , or fish chef . Great . I had come_to France to work and speak with French chefs , and first thing I know , I ' m speaking English with a German . This must be Europe . Down in the changing room Uwe informs me that , contrary to the usual practice in most American restaurants , in France all cooks are responsible_for buying and cleaning their own whites . In other words , it ' s going_to cost me an additional $ 100 to work for nothing . The coat , Uwe says , loaning me one of his , has to be buttoned_up on the right and all_the way to the top , no American informality allowed . OK . After a quick tour of the kitchen , he puts me to work for a_few hours julienning cucumbers and zucchini . Although I have brought my own knives , Uwe makes me use a giant German knife . Uptight about making mistakes , I do the job , it seems , too well . &quot; Relax , kid , &quot; says Uwe , &quot; they don ' t have to be so perfect ! &quot; Out of the corner of my eye , I start to notice the other cooks going_about their duties and am surprised by the international makeup of the kitchen -- Japanese , English , German , Italian . The staff lunch is eaten_in silence . And it ' s godawful . Cold mixed vegetables from a can . Cheap , fatty salami . A salad of unwashed , undressed chicory . Craziest of all , coffee and soda are forbidden to the cooks . Some restaurants , I ' ve heard , pay their stagiers , and some , it is rumored , are even fed well . Not so here . Perhaps this is the famous French stinginess ? At 3 o ' clock , after the counters are scrubbed , the stoves cleaned and the floors mopped , we all go downstairs to change . In my naivete I ask , &quot; Are we done for the day ? &quot; &quot; Ha ! &quot; they all laugh . &quot; Be back at 6. &quot; Thus I learn that my workday begins at 8:30 a.m. and ends at 11:30 p.m. , six days a week , Sundays off . By having everyone work six days a week , the owners avoid the expense of a second shift . At 6 on the dot , I meet Pascal , the strapping young Provencal who , as sous-chef , runs the kitchen in the absence of the chef . He shakes my hand with a fleeting glance of acknowledgment and then nods back to the chopping block , where I concentrate_on not seeming overzealous -- I don ' t slice the vegetables too perfectly . I survive Day One . Famous for elevating the seafood of Marseille to the level of haute cuisine , Le Petit Nice attracts an eclectic mix of international elite , from Neil Armstrong to Catherine Deneuve . American executives descend from helicopters to consume lavish meals , only to vanish four courses later in a whir of rotors . All of the tall glass windows in the dining_room are filled with the sight of the Mediterranean , the notable exception being the one on the far right that looks_out onto the island prison of the Count of Monte Christo , the Chateau d ' If . The service is so swift and unobtrusive that the customer almost feels as if the sea is magically offering its bounty directly . On the other side of the dining_room doors , however , I am up_to my elbows in fish blood . Scales fly into my hair . The low-tide stench of fish guts adheres to my hands and nostrils . For the sake of speed , fingers are the tools recommended for the removal of the unforgiving gills , which can do nasty things to your hands . Next , with a pair of needle-nosed pliers , I must remove , one by one , the copious , tiny bones from a mountain of rouget fillets . Despite everything I had envisioned , on Day Two I am put_in sole charge of cooking the fish that will actually be served to paying customers . Pascal , the sous-chef , barks out orders . My brain swims with foreign fish names -- loup de mer , rascasse , morue . . . . I make as_many mistakes as there are varieties . I am scolded . It seems I am having trouble getting_the_hang of the proper French way to prepare fish . They like their fish rare and their vegetables well done , just the opposite of most Americans . With every fish I cook , Pascal bangs his fist on the table and mutters , &quot; Too cook , too cook ! &quot; Of all_the pieces of equipment in the kitchen , the sous-vide , or vacuum sealer , is one of the most unexpected -- and attractive . It is a suitcase-sized box with a windowed lid and a_few controls on the outside . After a morning of fish cleaning , the fillets are wrapped in butcher ' s paper and placed in a special plastic bag . One end of the so-called cryovac bag is connected to a hot sealing rod , while the other is fitted around a tube . With a great whoosh the air is sucked out of the bag , which is sealed at_the_same_time . The bags of fish are iced down until served . As the order is called by the chef , I pull_out a bag of fish from the ice , cut_out a portion and voila ! The fish is as fresh as the moment it was cut -- technology to accommodate a most earthly delight . On my third day , the chef de cuisine , Gerald Passedat , returns from a trip to Italy . It was his grandfather who founded Le Petit Nice in 1917 . Lean , 30 years old , described in the_French guidebook Gault-Millaut as a playboy , Passedat has a classic Gallic nose and an aloof air about him . His lordly manner makes the atmosphere in the kitchen even more tense , if that ' s possible . The stagiers nobly break that tension by cracking jokes and knocking_off each other ' s toques by hurling pieces of wet bread . After our usual dismal lunch , the chef asks_for a small plate of diced raw sea_bass for his chat . &quot; Chat -shimi , &quot; I pun to Akiheko , one of the Japanese stagiers . Out front , a customer orders lobster . The maitre d ' takes the order sheet and presents the dupe to the chef , who calls_out &quot; Homard ! &quot; that ' s my signal . I grab the keys and a pan , race out back , down the alley , through the restaurant garden , and into the garage where I fumble for the lights ( the_French have a very different sense of where such fixtures should be placed ) . In the room that houses a tankful of lobsters from Brittany , I try to fish out a nice one . But the lobsters aren ' t cooperating . They keep jumping_out of the long-poled net back into the tank . Meanwhile , back in the kitchen , I know the orders are pouring in . Finally , I am able to snare one of the crafty crustacea , and I zip back through the garden and into the kitchen . I throw the thing alive and kicking onto its back , hack it in half , pluck out its heart and douse its flesh with olive_oil , Provencal garlic and thyme . Its muscles twitch as they are sprinkled with salt and pepper . At a nod from Passedat , into the oven it goes . Once-cooked , twice-dressed , ready to be served . A punch_in the shoulder and a wink tells me that at last Pascal is pleased . Dejeuner is supposedly French for lunch . But the American experience of a diet Coke and a frozen_yogurt does not even remotely resemble the daily occasion that takes_place on the Continent . In France , commerce and trade politely but definitely are brought_to a halt so that the_French citizenry might indulge in its inalienable right to an unencumbered , uninterrupted mid-day repast . Chef Passedat ' s jowly basset_hound meanders through the kitchen and flops himself down in the most inconvenient of places . Passedat yells and kicks him freely , but when meal time comes_around , it is the dog who is served steak , while we get cheval , horse meat . The French adore their pooches , and this accounts_for the omnipresence of chefs ' best friends in the kitchens and dining_rooms of the country ' s great restaurants . While this may seem unhygienic to an American , the_French stove is a shining monument to cleanliness . Made of the highest-quality steel -- usually reserved for F-16s and Trident subs in this country -- it is polished and buffed twice a day with special sandpaper from Paris . While American cooks eat standing_up at their cutting_boards , a knife in one hand , lunch in the other , here we retire outside for nearly an hour of la digestion -- bad as it is -- on the rocks by the sea . There ' s a sign_in the kitchen that reads Vous avez choisi un metier noble -- &quot; You have chosen a noble profession. &quot; In France there is an unmistakable pride in being a cook . Food does not simply serve to fulfill a bodily need ; it was here that it was raised to the level of art , with all_the endless pursuit of perfection that implies . But that &quot; nobility &quot; also entails personal sacrifice , as when the chef decides to smoke some sea_bass and orders all_the windows shut . One of the stagiers , David , has been feeling queasy all day . He now turns blue and has to run downstairs . &quot; Where ' s David ? &quot; asks the chef a_few minutes later . &quot; Downstairs . He ' s very sick. &quot; replies a stagier . &quot; Is he dead ? &quot; the chef queries sarcastically . &quot; No. &quot; &quot; Then tell him to get_up here and plate the lamb. &quot; The chef ' s tyranny is full-on . David plates the lamb . There are breaks_in the tension and routine . One day I get_to go_to the market with the chef ' s father , Jean-Paul , a thick-set man with graying hair who used to run the kitchen but now spends most of his time_out front with the customers . Run exclusively for restaurants , the market is in a desolate industrial zone surrounded by Arab tenements . Some of the vendors are grilling sausages and drinking red_wine . I load our order -- fennel , eggplant and thyme -- into our van according to Jean-Paul ' s exacting instructions for safeguarding the produce . The aroma of Provencal tomatoes is intoxicating . In America , au contraire , tomatoes are seen and not smelled . It occurs to me that the produce is the true star of Provencal cooking . I am the only American in the kitchen , and I take more_than my share of heat when my fellow Americans out_in the dining_room are gauche enough to order &quot; just a salad &quot; or ham and eggs when they come all_the way to this two-star French restaurant . &quot; Americans have no appetite , they don ' t know how to eat ! &quot; says the chef with his fist in the air , glaring at me . I have no reply . But I try to think_of one while preparing frogs ' legs , which come_to the kitchen neatly plaited by the dozen on thin sticks of wood . They are delivered on ice , but at room_temperature they smell like the reptile section of a pet store . Detaching the feet and hips is done with a paring knife ; the work is delicate , time-consuming , tedious . I am at a low point , feeling unappreciated and , worse , unaccepted . I grumble insults at the frogs ' legs , which I then flour lightly and saute in goose fat and oil . After a long day , Akiheko and I retire to a local bar for a bottle of the eternal Japanese elixir , Coca Cola . Pascal , the sous-chef , dispels the gloom by announcing that he is taking a leave_of_absence to help with the harvest on his family ' s farm near Avignon . He invites the entire kitchen there for a grand Provencal feast . The following Sunday morning our caravan -- a Citroen , a VW bug , a Yamaha motorcycle -- streaks down the autoroute at 200 km ( 120 miles ) per hour . At the farm , Pascal ' s parents greet us warmly , three kisses instead of the usual two . While Pascal cooks , we sip pastis and eat potato_chips . Then the 25 of us go outside and sit_down at a long table under the trees . There are dogs , chickens , piglets , goats and children running everywhere . I slip_away from the conversation and find Pascal cooking his version of paella on a camping stove . He shows me some tricks and lets me in on a_few secrets . Then he moves about the table ladling out steaming saffron-flavored rice heaped with rabbit , squid , shellfish and peas . We drink the family ' s homemade wine out of plastic Vittel bottles . A tarte aux pommes follows the cheese . Native produce may be the star of Provencal cuisine , but the home kitchen is its brilliant agent . Not all my lessons are so easy . Back in the kitchen a_few days later , Uwe offers me a slice of sauteed lamb ' s testicle . &quot; Thanks , but no thanks , &quot; I say politely . &quot; You ' re a cook , you taste it , you eat it. &quot; He ' s right . I ' m a cook . I taste it . Not_bad . And if I had any last doubts about being accepted as a cook in that kitchen , they are washed_away on my last_day , when I hear Uwe say , &quot; Excuse me , Mr. Lourie. &quot; I look_up as a bucket of water is poured over my head . It is a French custom to soak anyone who is leaving the kitchen . I decide to give the tradition an American update and a_few minutes later catch Uwe off_guard with a bucketful in return . All cooking comes_to a stop and the whole kitchen goes berserk as a full-fledged water fight ensues . Finally , Uwe and most of the staff drag me kicking and screaming to the dish sink , where I am dunked into the filthy water and a torrent of tomato_sauce is poured over my head . Then everybody laughs and cheers at the spectacle of my baptism . I smile too , licking the tomato_sauce from the corners of my mouth . It could use a little salt . * Bouillabaisse is known throughout the world as a grand classic of French cuisine . The mere mention of the word conjures images of quaint old sea towns and the salty old_men who work there , steaming sterling platters of the sea ' s bounty brought_to the table in elegant French bistros brimming with gleaming brass and pressed white linen . But I found that closer to the truth was a dish of boiled fish and somewhat glamorized leftovers . In this version , the fish and shellfish are served with just a little of the broth in which they cooked . Also , the potatoes are cooked separately . You can , however , cook the potatoes with the fish and shellfish and serve the dish as a soup . I actually like it a little better this way ( you can take the Yankee out of the States . . . ) , though that cooking and serving method is very much taboo in the city of Marseille . Note : In France , the fish for bouillabaisse would be slightly different . Rascasse , or scorpion_fish , for instance , would be considered essential in Marseille . But since it isn ' t available here , try Pacific red_snapper .

Be careful not to overcook these delicate appendages . Their flavor is a cross between chicken and fish -- very appropriate considering they are amphibians . The two very different sauce recipes represent the classic and the more modern Provencal approaches . FROGS ' LEGS WITH TWO SAUCES 2 dozen frogs ' legs Salt , pepper 1 1 / 2 cups all-purpose flour Olive_oil Unsalted butter Classical Sauce Provencal Sauce Cut_off feet and pelvis from frog legs .

To bone this fish the way I did is quite difficult , requiring cutting along both sides of the spine all_the way down to -- but not through -- the belly , snipping out the backbone , then carefully removing the pin_bones . Foil supports keep the fish upright during cooking . Then the fish is served with its back open and filled with a bounty of Provencal vegetables , topped with glimmering oily black truffles . Spoon the sauce on the platter surrounding the fish . A simpler approach would be to saute two pounds of lightly floured sea_bass fillets in butter and serve with the vegetables arranged on top .
