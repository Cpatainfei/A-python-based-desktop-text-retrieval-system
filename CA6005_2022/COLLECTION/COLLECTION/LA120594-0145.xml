   <HEADLINE> THE PACIFIC ; JAPAN LOOKING TO GATT TO EASE TENSIONS ; TRADE : BUT THE NEW ACCORD IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE ANY IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON TOKYO ' S DISPUTES WITH U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan , which made some key concessions to be included in the new_world trade accord approved by its lower house of Parliament on Friday , believes the agreement will eventually make_it easier to resolve international trade frictions . But the expanded General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , which passed the U.S. Congress last Thursday , will have little immediate effect on U.S.-Japan disputes , particularly tensions over the huge U.S. trade_deficit with Japan in automobiles and auto parts . Such trade accounts_for about two-thirds of the overall $ 60-billion U.S. deficit with Japan . For one , Tokyo and Washington disagree on whether the dispute-settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization , established under the expanded GATT , is appropriate for the dispute . Washington has threatened sanctions against Japan under Section 301 of U.S. trade law if Japan refuses to take measures to increase purchases of replacement auto parts . Tokyo has said that it would probably appeal any U.S. actions under Section 301 to the WTO . But Washington has insisted that nothing in the agreements setting_up the WTO would block use of such retaliatory trade measures . Additionally , the new accord does not address specific points of the dispute over automobiles . Washington has pressed especially hard for Tokyo to agree to &quot; results-oriented &quot; measures to boost exports of American automobiles and auto parts to Japan . The United States has suggested that the Japanese government relax various regulations that discourage the import of foreign auto parts . Washington also wants Tokyo to help boost the number of dealerships in Japan that carry foreign automobiles , and to encourage Japanese auto_makers to increase their purchases of foreign parts . But Tokyo insists that it cannot yield to many of the key U.S. demands . Japanese officials have described regulations in the replacement auto parts market as necessary for safety , and have said some_other key U.S. requests would require improper interference by the government in the affairs of private_corporations . The United States and Japan have not set a date to resume talks on automobiles and auto parts . Negotiations are moving forward , however , in some_other areas . The two sides are_due to meet this week in Washington to try to hammer_out a final agreement on market-opening measures for Japan ' s $ 4.5-billion flat-glass market . The atmosphere for the bilateral talks may be helped by renewed enthusiasm in Japan for the new_world trade agreement . Japan ' s upper house of Parliament is expected to approve the GATT agreement this week , having largely defused domestic opposition . As a key part of last year ' s global agreement to expand GATT , Japan promised to gradually open its rice market to foreign imports , promising to allow_in rice supplies equal_to 4 % of domestic consumption in 1995 , with that figure rising to 8 % by 2000 . Japanese farmers bitterly opposed the concession when it was first made . Now , however , as part of a package of legislation to approve the agreement , Tokyo is enacting a six-year plan to spend about $ 60 billion in rural_areas to help farmers cope_with the impact of liberalized agricultural trade . This plan , which includes direct subsidies to farmers and funding for rural infrastructure projects , helped to ensure easy passage by Japan ' s parliament of the legislation to approve the trade accord . Japanese government officials and business_leaders place high hopes in the idea that multilateral rules set_up and enforced by the WTO will make_it easier to avoid bilateral disputes . &quot; I think all Japanese businessmen care very much about what happens in the future with WTO , &quot; said Masaru Yamano , vice_chairman of Sanyo Electric Co . Ltd . &quot; For world peace management , it ' s the United Nations , but as for economic matters , the WTO should play the same role as the ( United Nations ) . The settlement of international disputes should be done through the WTO. &quot;</TEXT>
