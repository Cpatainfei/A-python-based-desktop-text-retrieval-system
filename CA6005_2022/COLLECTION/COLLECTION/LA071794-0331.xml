   <HEADLINE> THE SUNDAY PROFILE ; AT THE FORE ONCE AGAIN ; ELY CALLAWAY HIT IT BIG WITH TEXTILES AND WINE . NOW IT ' S GOLF . BUT THE MAKER OF THE WORLD ' S BEST-SELLING CLUB SAYS IT ' S TIME TO RETIRE AND WRITE HIS LIFE_STORY . HOW CAN HE POSSIBLY SLOW DOWN ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jack Nicholson isn ' t talking . So the rumor lingers that he used a Callaway 3-iron to pound his point and the windshield of a motorist ' s Mercedes during a recent traffic hassle . &quot; The club is probably still intact , &quot; says a laughing Jack Lemmon , who also swings Callaway clubs -- but in more conventional fashion . &quot; God help the car. &quot; President Clinton doesn ' t mind talking . He loves his Callaways . He even videotaped a 75th-birthday message for their creator , Ely Callaway , an unerring thinker with a lifelong gift for dreaming the unconceived -- and seeing his brainchildren uproot stuffy and disparate industries . First textiles . Then wine . Now golf . In the ' 60s , while in his 40s and ascending at Burlington Industries , Callaway broke the worsted barrier . He helped introduce quality clothiers to blended fabrics that looked good , cost less and lasted longer . And he added personality and names . Like Viracle . In a much more daring move for the times , Callaway hired a woman for an executive position . Letitia Baldrige , etiquette author , columnist , and former social_secretary and chief_of_staff for Jacqueline Kennedy , was that woman -- the company ' s first director of consumer affairs . &quot; Ely charmed the socks off the grande_dames of American society who were_on the board of the Burlington House Interior_Design Awards , &quot; she recalls . &quot; When you consider the ladies included Nancy Reagan , Mary Lasker , Lady Bird Johnson and Dina Merrill , that was some group to impress. &quot; In 1973 , after being passed_over for chief_executive , Callaway quit the prestigious presidency of Burlington . He moved from South Carolina to California and for a time looked_like a member of the white-collar exodus from aerospace and computer_industries headed for the supposed idyll of making wine . Or growing avocados . This whispering Georgian , however , set his 150-acre vineyard facing a coastal saddle at Temecula in Southern California . Experts said fine grapes would never flourish there . that ' s the point , replied Callaway the contrarian . So when they do grow , the wine will be different and a guaranteed attention-getter . Within four years , Callaway wines -- marketed by another radical means , an all-woman sales force -- were receiving favorable reviews . They were sipped at the Four Seasons and Ma Maison and in 1976 were chosen for Queen Elizabeth ' s bicentennial luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria . Point proved and a large profit beckoning , Callaway sold his little vineyard in 1981 to Hiram Walker &amp; Sons . For $ 14 million . Callaway -- a club championship golfer in earlier years and a distant nephew of legend Bobby Jones -- retired to country_clubs and weekend tournaments around the region . The slow times didn ' t last . He stumbled upon a four-man company fumbling to stay alive making steel-core , hickory-shaft clubs . &quot; Frankly , it was one of the loveliest clubs I ' d ever seen , &quot; he recalls . &quot; Meant to look old , but performed like the best of modern clubs. &quot; Callaway was fascinated . So he bought the company . Hence Ely Reeves Callaway Jr. ' s third and latest disruption of the way things used to be . &quot; I wish , &quot; begged Clinton on the birthday tape , &quot; that you ' d find a way to make my golf_game as_good_as my golf clubs. &quot; Truth is , Callaway already has . It ' s in the bulbous , fat-faced Big Bertha metal woods this courtly , hard of hearing , Southern-canny CEO crafts at Callaway Golf in Carlsbad . Lemmon , a 15-handicap hacker , says Big Bertha adds 20 yards to his tee shots and permits par fours that he failed in the past . When flagging tour veteran Johnny Miller won the AT &amp; T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in January , he kissed his Callaways , then the check . &quot; Now , these clubs don ' t make the game of golf one bit easier , &quot; Callaway says . As always , he is dressed in an alpaca pullover and cotton turtleneck . Almost as always , he is at_work . &quot; But these clubs are easier to play with , make the game more fun , and I call them the friendliest clubs on Earth . &quot; Now , take_a_look at this. &quot; He lifts a letter from the mid-morning mail . It carries a silver crest . It praises Callaway ' s clubs , expresses regret over a military schedule that interrupts golf , but also happily reports that &quot; my handicap is now dropping to single figures. &quot; The letter is signed &quot; Andrew. &quot; As in Andrew , Duke of York . Even Callaway -- a wry rogue who travels_by Concorde and Bentley Continental , an epicurean who prefers to rest wherever there is a Ritz , a friend of Bill ' s who attended the white-tie state banquet for Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko -- is impressed . Prince Andrew , of course , didn ' t send a manservant to Harrod ' s to purchase clubs . Clinton didn ' t buy his latest set . Nor did Sean Connery . All were freebies from Callaway , part of his endless pursuit for promotion through celebrity usage . And for the record , the golf_bag that went_to Chicago before being impounded as potential evidence in the O.J. Simpson case was stuffed with Callaways . &quot; But it said Hertz on the bag , &quot; Callaway says . &quot; That was part of the deal. &quot; For some industry watchers , the intoxicating triumph of Callaway Golf belongs_to a superb huckster whose marketing shtick may be more effective than his sticks . &quot; I ' m not in_love with the guy , &quot; says Robert Sauerhaft , equipment editor of Golf magazine . &quot; Because Callaway ' s whole marketing and promotion . . . does get a little tiresome. &quot; But Sauerhaft is among a majority of players , golf writers and equipment retailers who recognize Callaway clubs as the game ' s greatest innovation since balls stopped being stuffed with feathers . To Callaway , there ' s nothing really amazing about his concept . &quot; I ' m a merchant , someone who recognizes a need for an improved product , then creates it , &quot; he explains . &quot; But it must be a consumer product that is demonstrably superior to the competition and pleasingly different . &quot; Then you market the hell out of it. &quot; He drummed textiles . He pitched his own wines . At 75 , still showing a perfect corporate swing , the wry , much-married , sometimes impatient Callaway is now marketing the hell out of his original and expensive Big Bertha golf_clubs , the second-generation War Birds and the newly released Big Bertha irons . Big Bertha -- named after a World_War I German cannon that tossed a shell 76 miles -- is to golf what the oversize racquets of Head and Prince were to tennis . Yonex , a Japanese manufacturer , was first with the idea of the jumbo driver . But Callaway found it mushy , with room for development . He replaced its graphite with stainless_steel , specially forged to permit a hollow , stronger head with greater perimeter weighting . The result : Big Bertha with a head 25 % larger than a conventional driver , and with a sweet spot the size of Pebble Beach . A ball gets airborne quicker . Any duffer can become a Long John Daly . Off-center smacks usually are forgiven . In the three years since its birth , Bertha has become the world ' s best-selling club , with more_than 3 million shipped . On the pro tours , 40 % of the drivers are by Callaway . Since tee-off in 1983 , Callaway Golf sales have gone from $ 364 # 000 to $ 255 million last year . And the operation has grown from five guys behind in the rent of one small plant to a 350 # 000-square-foot complex in a pristine industrial_park -- with 1 # 600 employees and hiring . Among all these corporate holes in one , says Callaway , the most exhilarating occurred Feb . 27 , 1992 . On that day Callaway Golf first traded as ELY -- at $ 20 a share -- on the New York Stock_Exchange . Callaway sweated the opening minutes . No changes were posted . &quot; But 27 minutes after the market opened , the stock went_up to $ 37 , &quot; he says . &quot; That thrill has been pretty damned hard to match. &quot; Since its opening drive , Callaway stock has split once and hovers around $ 39 . The company ' s market evaluation is $ 1.4 billion . And Ely Callaway is again a multimillionaire . &quot; The funny thing is . . . there was no grand vision of three careers and big fortunes . I just started_out one little step at a time and hoped it worked . Luck has a big piece of it . Not so_much good_luck , but the absence of bad luck. &quot; Or the massaged luck that has brought Callaway the profit of personal celebrity . At a Pediatric AIDS Foundation picnic last month -- Callaway is a new but major donor to the charity -- Goldie Hawn and Jimmy Connors sought_out the clubmeister . Jay Leno stopped by . So did O.J. Simpson . It became clear why Callaway eschews publicists . &quot; Hi , I ' m Ely Callaway , &quot; says the man . &quot; Do you play golf ? &quot; Hawn plays ; Connors says he is a beginner . Leno reports that he has yet to graduate from miniature_golf . The actress and the tennis_player should receive their clubs any day . * Ely Callaway ' s office , all floor-to-ceiling windows and the right dabs of chrome and executive paneling , is still pretty much a family_room . The desk is an oaken business relic from the ' 50s . The captain ' s chair is from Emory University , where Callaway majored in American history because , he says , it was the easiest study . Wherever there is a corner , there are golf_clubs leaning into it . Wherever there is a wall , there are framed covers and spreads from Forbes and Advertising Age . Wherever there is a shelf , there are color photos of Cindy , Callaway ' s fourth wife , and sepia prints of the clan Callaway of LaGrange , Ga. , a two-hour drive southwest from Atlanta . Callaway ' s favorite relative is Uncle Fuller Earle Callaway . The 14th child of a twice-married , slave-owning Baptist minister , Fuller Callaway tasted business at age 10 . He walked barefoot to town and bought six spools of thread for a nickel . He traipsed back into the country and resold the thread to farmers ' wives . For a nickel a spool . At 13 , he was farming and selling cotton . At 18 , he opened Callaway ' s Mammoth Five and Ten Cent Store . He died in 1928 after founding 23 cotton_mills , banks , insurance agencies , department_stores and development companies . From such a gene pool came Ely Callaway . &quot; What Fuller did was great . . . and he did_it in spades because in 1890 trade was not easy , &quot; Callaway says . &quot; He also came from nowhere , so his is a typical , great , Horatio Alger story. &quot; Fuller was a man of homely wisdoms . &quot; The man who succeeds almost always spends less than he makes . . . . &quot; You ' ve got_to love your work better than anything else in the world , if you want to make a big success. &quot; Ely lives by similar one-liners . &quot; Good ethics is good business , &quot; he repeats . &quot; Don ' t look_back because you can ' t do a thing about the past , &quot; is another favorite . And : &quot; Nepotism is a lousy way to run a business. &quot; Callaway , however , knows precisely where he and Uncle Fuller differ . &quot; He built his business on principles the opposite of mine , &quot; he explains . &quot; He bought as a retailer mass consumer items he knew somebody was going_to buy . &quot; Then he sold them as cheaply as he could . . . so the attraction to come buy was price , as low as possible . And super good service. &quot; Ely Callaway ' s paradigm was &quot; a super , high-priced product . . . with special merit to offer the buyer. &quot; &quot; We sell mass-produced products to the masses in massive numbers at high price , &quot; he continues . Such_as graphite-shafted Big Bertha clubs by the millions at $ 240 apiece . &quot; that ' s the unique part. &quot; It also helps to be shrewd , he believes , a risk-taker unafraid of losing and intolerant_of excuses for not trying at business : &quot; Costs too_much . . . too risky . . . can ' t do_it . . . don ' t know how. &quot; In many ways , Callaway is no different than the next chief_executive . He is impatient with contemporaries who cannot match his mental pace , and he admits an excess of self-satisfaction . He has always been married to work , which explains the many wives . He drives himself from 8:30 a.m. , through a chicken noodle soup , frozen_yogurt and V-8 juice lunch at his desk , to whenever he decides the day is done . &quot; I think Ely , better than most , has been able to assemble , at everything he has done , extremely good people , &quot; says John Marin , a founder of Sports Illustrated and senior adviser to Time Inc. &quot; Then satisfy them , keep them , encourage them and financially reward them. &quot; Flaws ? &quot; He uses too_much salt on things. &quot; Psychiatrist Roy Menninger , head of the Menninger Clinic in Topeka , Kan. , knows Callaway as a major donor to the Menninger Foundation and as &quot; a rough-hewn man whose plain-spoken bluntness has always been appealing . . . . There ' s little ceremony to him and very little pretension and pomp. &quot; Flaws ? &quot; I think Ely would probably be every difficult to live with , &quot; Menninger continues . &quot; He is . . . very much dismissive of other people or other attitudes . But it isn ' t contemptuous or disabling or negative . It ' s just a matter of : ' It ' s not for me and that ' s the end of it. ' &quot; To friends , colleagues , even competitors , Callaway and honesty are synonymous . This year , he declined to speak_to UCLA ' s graduate_school of business after swindler Michael Milken began lecturing there . And the university blinked . &quot; There is a general feeling today that if it has to do with business , you don ' t have to apply normal standards of doing_it honestly , &quot; he complains . &quot; I say you don ' t go_out and run a bunch of ads saying yours is the best product if it isn ' t . It is inexcusable to cut corners . . . and good ethics is good business. &quot; Walking his plant , greeting long-termers by first_names , asking a manager how much the company is spending on office supplies ( &quot; A half-million dollars on pencils and pens ? I ' m sorry I asked &quot; ) , Callaway clearly is Boss Callaway . that ' s the way Fuller Callaway did_it in the Old_South . &quot; He was one of the first industrialists to be concerned with the social_welfare of his workers , hence the Callaway Foundation , right there with the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations , &quot; he says . &quot; It probably has given something like $ 100 million to higher education in the state of Georgia. &quot; Ely Callaway has given_away about $ 15 million in his careers . His $ 250 # 000 program to aid the development of golf in inner_cities , his 40-year support of the United Negro College Fund , and a lump of Callaway stock now worth $ 8 million donated to Emory University . But the generosity is not limitless . Callaway denies , without exception , requests for free golf_clubs for silent auctions , raffles or club prizes . &quot; Every single village , hamlet and town in America has charities , 80 % use golf tournaments to raise funds , which means thousands do_it and Callaway is the target of all_of ' em , &quot; he explains . &quot; The moment we start donating to them , we ' d literally have to give_away everything we make . &quot; And we ' d go broke. &quot; * It was a splendid , six-figure , surprise 75th-birthday party . Among those invited to the dinner at Rancho Valencia resort , near Rancho Santa Fe , were Cabinet members and actors , a former wife and professional_golfers , some of America ' s richest businessmen -- and Woodson Houze , 76 , a classmate from LaGrange High_School who knew Callaway as &quot; head of everything . . . the school paper , the class , the debating society , all_the activities. &quot; And the clan Callaway , including two sons , a daughter and three grandchildren gathered from both coasts and several states . A hardcover book -- the First Book of Ely , joked a family member -- contained tributes from Vernon Jordan Jr. , former president of the National Urban League , and portrait photographer Yousuf Karsh , whom Callaway once photographed . And Madonna penned an aria : &quot; Dump that Bertha , she is merely . . . a slut , a tart , an arriviste . . . give me an appellation and keep it classy . . . To wit : how ' bout ' Madonna ' s Mashie. ' &quot; It was a night of warm memories . Of a 25-year-old officer who in World_War_II became the youngest major in the history of Army procurement . Of a golf swing so perfect Callaway didn ' t need to wear spikes . Painful thoughts were spoken . Of a first wife who attempted suicide , of a first daughter who lived only a_few hours . Of Callaway ' s marriages and his sweet-talking mastery of the three-week romance . Callaway met it all with humor and rough dignity . &quot; With the exception of three people , I love everyone here , &quot; Callaway told his guests . &quot; When I ' m gone , I ' ll leave you with a memo of the three names. &quot; Then he asked the Ovation Orchestra to strike_up &quot; If Ever I Should Leave You &quot; and made an announcement : &quot; The B.S. may_not be over , but the romancing is . Because I ' ve found her. &quot; He opened his arms to dance with Cindy Callaway , 45 , his wife of 11 years . Later , he frankly discussed the past . Sometimes , he simply chose the wrong woman , he says . Mostly he would do_it all_over again . Always he blames himself because &quot; I was married to my job and that was unfair. &quot; In addition , he says , he was blessed -- or maybe cursed -- with a talent for leaving unhappy relationships before they became unhealthy . And never looking_back . And how feel the former Mrs . Callaways ? Says one relative : &quot; The trail of ex-wives , to a woman , is a satisfied path. &quot; Confirms second wife Jane Callaway of Darrien , Conn : &quot; The only bad thing . . . he was so attractive to others . I have a tremendous affection for a very dear person who will always be a treasured memory. &quot; Nothing in the party talk surprised or disturbed Cindy Callaway . She knows her love for him , his for her , and that their only source of hostility is each other ' s driving . &quot; It ' s just a great match . . . . We got lucky , &quot; she says . Twelve years ago , easy-mannered Cindy was a waitress at Reuben ' s in Orange . Because the restaurant sold Callaway wines , the employees were invited to a tour and a tasting at Temecula . Callaway -- then separated -- addressed the group . Cindy -- never married -- heard nothing but the humor , grace and knowledge of a very efficient mind . &quot; He was staring at me , and I said to myself : ' If he asks me out , no question I will go , ' &quot; she recalls . &quot; The age difference didn ' t hit me at all . . . . He was just so_much fun , so interesting. &quot; Later , Callaway walked over and presented two business_cards . One , he said , was for her to keep . The other was for her to return with her name and telephone_number . &quot; I knew he was going_to call me , &quot; she says . &quot; But I was home a good hour before he did. &quot; They are a tight couple , she believes , because neither crowds the other . Callaway remains married to work . But she is a golfer married to a nine handicap and new interests in fly-fishing and skeet_shooting . &quot; He stands_back while I do those things , &quot; she says . &quot; I think we ' re close because we let each other go . . . and grow because of that. &quot; * Sometimes the Callaway name seems ubiquitous . On wine , of course , and golf_clubs . Soon , it will be the label on sporting apparel sold through Nordstrom . There is Callaway Editions Inc. of New York . that ' s second son Nicholas Callaway , 41 , founder and head of an upscale company whose publications cover fine_arts , photography , travel and Madonna ' s foil-wrapped &quot; Sex. &quot; Like father , like son , Callaway Editions specializes in the improved and unusual . Despite periodic visitation after divorce ended a 17-year marriage , Nicholas Callaway has only &quot; fond memories &quot; of a childhood and adolescence with father . &quot; Spiritually , emotionally , financially . . . Father was supportive in all those ways without being coddling , &quot; he continues . &quot; He was always there to help if you needed it , but would gladly refuse something if he felt it was not right. &quot; Father paid_for Harvard . But not for postgraduate studies at Yale Arts . Nor the cost of forming a business . &quot; In the Callaway family , &quot; Nicholas adds , &quot; you are expected to find your own path in life and pursue it on your own. &quot; There is Callaway Cars of Old Lyme , Conn . that ' s first son Reeves Callaway , 47 , founder and head of a specialized engineering firm that modifies Chevrolet Corvettes into collectibles worth $ 45 # 000 to $ 175 # 000 . There , again , the Callaway theme : Burnish and elevate a standard product into something exclusive and desirable . Says this son of his father : &quot; I learned from him the ability to look_at the heart of a situation and say : ' Here is the essence , here is the kernel of what needs to be done . Concentrate_on this . Be simple about it . And don ' t get bogged down in enormous complexities. ' &quot; And one day , there may be fine writings carrying the name Lisa Callaway , 43 , of Watertown , Mass . Lisa is an only daughter . She is challenged by multiple_sclerosis . Despite her father ' s financial_support , life among the male and high-achieving Callaways has always been a task . She praises her father for his success , his focus and determination . Yet she remains wanting for some warmer communication with a parent she believes too often placed business before family . &quot; He always made the effort to be sensitive and affectionate . . . but the degree of success at that isn ' t always within our control , &quot; she says . She understands but opposes the male privilege and patriarchal mentality inherent to Southern families . &quot; Growing_up as a woman in the Callaway family is not easy , &quot; she says . Last month , the Callaway men took France . Their name was_on a transporter , above a garage , on hats , jackets , polo_shirts -- and on a Callaway Corvette entered in the famed 24 Hours of Le Mans , the world ' s longest endurance auto race . The name was also all_over European television and French newspapers eager to see what this rookie American team -- Reeves Callaway , three drivers and their silver , blue-striped 450-horsepower race_car -- could do as the first Corvette entry in 16 years . Ely Callaway , taking a rare break from his own business , was there to share his son ' s noisy , deadly business . &quot; I ' m really impressed about his being here , &quot; Reeves says . &quot; Just the fact he said ' I ' m coming ' is important . He doesn ' t need to see us win . He doesn ' t need to see us lose . He does need to see us. &quot; What Ely Callaway saw was a small automotive miracle . His son ' s car -- built_in 12 weeks and on a shoestring , given less odds than the San Diego Padres of reaching the World_Series , certain to be overshadowed by Ferrari and Porsche -- won the pole in its Grand Tourisme class . Sometime between final practice and the start of the race , Ely Callaway began to understand the mystique of auto racing and its importance in elevating the prestige of a specialty-car builder . With Reeves as his guide -- and in an arena where the son , not the father has eminence -- Ely met recent winners and old champions of Le Mans . He learned of $ 5-million budgets to field a factory team , of $ 20 # 000 to rent a box for the race , of French drivers , who believe it is bad_luck to wish each other good_luck . When the race erupted , Ely Callaway toured the course by van to see cars become hot banshees through corners and thrash down the Mulsanne straight at 220 m.p.h. It hurt his ears . It stirred the blood of this old risk-taker . &quot; The amazing thing is that there is only a hairline between victory and your total destruction , &quot; he says . A Porsche hit oil in Indianapolis corner , spun , rammed dirt and its race was over . &quot; You can be dead in a second . This is as exciting as hell. &quot; The Callaway Corvette did not win . But it led its class for almost 12 hours and there was jubilation among the team . Then , a single miscalculation -- and the car ran_out of fuel on a dark course . Those 12 hours , however , were victory enough for a father . &quot; I knew the excellence Reeves creates in his cars , and the fame he has in this category , &quot; Ely Callaway says . &quot; But it ' s nice to see it firsthand. &quot; He also knew he encouraged his son to this . He knew he hammered home tenets of perseverance , honesty and self-focus . But he takes no credit for Le Mans . &quot; It ' s great to see Reeves has affection for his team , and earn some rewards for playing everything straight , &quot; Callaway says . &quot; He ' s worked hard and was willing to take the risk . But , God , what a risk . Much more risk than I ' ve ever taken . &quot; And I ' m damned proud that he ' s my son. &quot; * Now , believes Ely Callaway , is the time to wind down . After Le Mans , he and Cindy flew to the_French Riveria hideaway of Beaulieu-sur-Mer for their first vacation since their honeymoon . Callaway wants to write his autobiography while health and faculties are_full . A Rancho Valencia home , a 7 # 000-square-foot Italian-Mediterranean villa by Thomas Jakway , is almost finished : all fireplaces and marble and with a practice green for her , a vegetable_garden and orchid house for him . Callaway is resuming photography -- a passionate hobby that many years ago placed Karsh and John F . Kennedy in front of his Hasselblad . He says he has built an &quot; able , resourceful , intelligent &quot; executive team that will continue , even better his work_at Callaway Golf . In retirement , in retrospect , has his contribution been demonstrably superior and pleasingly different ? &quot; Well , I can demonstrate it to me , &quot; he says with a grin . &quot; Although I may_not have been pleasingly different , I guarantee you I ' ve been different. &quot; Ely Callaway Age : 75 Native : No . Born in LaGrange , Ga . Lived_in New York before moving to Temecula , Rancho Santa Fe and Palm Springs . Building homes at Vail and Rancho Valencia . Family : Married his fourth wife , Cindy Villa , in 1983 . Two sons and one daughter from his first marriage . Three grandchildren . Politics : Votes for the candidate , not the party . Supports legal abortion , equal-opportunity employment and physician-assisted suicide . Has been labeled a protectionist , but he prefers to call it &quot; economic nationalism. &quot; How he tells friends from acquaintances : Friends call him &quot; Eee-lee &quot; ; acquaintances say &quot; Ee-lie. &quot; People admired : Winston Churchill for his wit , Sam Walton for rising from nothing , Bobby Jones for his Grand_Slam golf swing and President Clinton for being in favor of &quot; freedom instead of slavery , prosperity instead of poverty , peace instead of war . . . and his personal transgressions are in the past. &quot; People disliked : Richard Nixon ( &quot; fundamentally a bad man . . . mean , petty &quot; ) , Lee Iacocca ( &quot; vulgar and crude &quot; ) and Ross Perot ( &quot; a fake , but sharp &quot; ) . On putting personal names on products : &quot; It makes you try hard because you ' ve got more at stake . In the case of Callaway wines , it was a plus because most names on wine were French or Italian. &quot; On corporate public relations : &quot; I don ' t need anybody . If you take the time and effort to make the product better than the competition , it ' s a publicity factory. &quot; On learning at his father ' s knee : &quot; What is good in life is good in business : Treat everybody right and tell the truth . No matter what you do , do your best and don ' t give_up . Just try , try , try . Then try again. &quot;</TEXT>
