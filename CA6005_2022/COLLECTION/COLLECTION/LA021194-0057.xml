   <HEADLINE> U.S. MEDDLING IN RUSSIAN POLITICS MUST END ; FOREIGN_POLICY : REFORMS MUST BE GRADUAL AND DIRECTED FROM MOSCOW , NOT WASHINGTON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The worst and most predictable American foreign-policy failure of the late 20th Century has been unfolding in post-communist Russia ever since the Soviet breakup in 1991 . All the outcomes we want in a country that remains so essential to our security -- democracy , a prospering economy , a political Establishment friendly to the West , major reductions and safeguarding of nuclear_weapons and other devices of mass destruction -- have been undermined by U.S._government policy . At fault is the basic premise that has guided American policy since 1991 : that the United States can and should intervene deeply in Russia ' s internal affairs in_order to transform that nation into an American-style system at_home and a compliant junior partner abroad . A preposterously missionary idea , it is in almost total conflict with Russia ' s historical traditions , present-day realities and actual possibilities , and thus dangerously counterproductive . Essentially , the United States said to the new Russian leadership : If you follow our &quot; free market &quot; prescriptions for economic reform , a leap-to-capitalism &quot; shock_therapy &quot; and our lead_on international issues , we will give you ample financial_aid , on-site adviser-therapists and a place by our side ( or in our shadow ) in world affairs . For his own complex reasons , Russian President Boris Yeltsin accepted -- or pretended to accept -- the offer , immediately anointed as a &quot; strategic partnership and friendship. &quot; And on that romantic assumption , the Clinton_Administration , with even more ideological gusto and less restraint than its predecessor , has stuck_to Yeltsin like Krazy Glue , at least until very recently . Consider how badly this missionary American policy has failed : Prospects for peaceful development toward stable markets and democracy in Russia are worse today than they were two years ago and much worse than they were when President Clinton took_office . The economy is in free fall , ravaged by a multiple collapse of production , capital investment , consumption , legal transaction and the ruble . Moreover , Russia has had no real political_system at all since Yeltsin destroyed the constitutional order by force last fall , only his current efforts to create a personal regime of power . As a result , anti-democratic , military and other security_forces now play a much larger role in domestic and foreign politics than they did a year ago . Nor has Russia ' s foreign_policy conformed_to U.S. prescriptions , as evidenced most recently by its opposition to moving NATO eastward and to Western action against Serbia . Still worse , nothing much has been done to reduce the various nuclear threats on former Soviet territory , which are greater today than they were under the Soviet regime . As for the U.S. wager on Boris Yeltsin as the popular instrument of the American crusade , 85 % of voters in December voted against his policies and party . A significant part of that anti-Yeltsin vote was an anti-American backlash . It is said that the United States must support Yeltsin because he is Russia ' s elected president . But Clinton and his aides have gone_far beyond that norm of international relations , becoming Yeltsin ' s cheerleader , accomplice and spin_doctor , thus implicating America in some of his most ill-advised and wicked deeds . To understand our complicity , look_at Yeltsin ' s leadership through the eyes of a great many Russian citizens . For them , he has been an extremist leader imposing from above exceedingly radical policies for which they never voted . Yeltsin ' s most extreme measures came as three still-traumatic shocks to society . In 1991 , he suddenly abolished the Soviet_Union , the only country most Russians had ever known . In 1992 , his economic &quot; shock_therapy &quot; took_away the life savings and living standards of most Russian families . And in 1993 , his tanks overthrew the elected Parliament and constitutional system that had been presented to citizens as the legitimate post-communist order . Not surprisingly , Yeltsin ' s shock leadership utterly polarized Russian society , devastating all varieties of moderation and centrism in political life . Extremism always begets extremism . Yeltsin ' s extremist policies led to the victory of the extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky in the December elections and to the sea changes under way in Russian politics today . Recall now the American role in those events , even leaving aside any covert involvement . The U.S._government applauded Yeltsin ' s precipitous abolition of the Soviet_Union without real concern for its impact on ordinary citizens . When his &quot; shock_therapy &quot; then impoverished tens of millions of Russians ( including prospective middle-class investors in economic privatization ) , our government urged him to do more of the same , scorning other pro-market but anti-Yeltsin economists for not being &quot; real &quot; reformers . When parliamentary opposition to Yeltsin grew in 1992 and ' 93 , the U.S._government echoed his charge that it was a &quot; citadel of Red-Brown reaction , &quot; helping to undermine what Russian democratization needs most -- an established parliament and accepted opposition . The Clinton_Administration supported Yeltsin ' s first attempt to shut_down the elected Parliament last March , shunned Russian moderates who tried to prevent a more fateful confrontation and cheered even more loudly when Yeltsin finally resorted_to a tank-backed coup , thereby endorsing Russia ' s long anti-democratic tradition of unfettered executive power . And now that Yeltsin has contrived a new &quot; constitution &quot; without an authentic separation of powers , the Administration heralds it as a &quot; democratic breakthrough , &quot; evidently unaware that Russia has had many constitutions but never any sustained constitutionalism . Clearly , the United States ' crusade to macromanage Russia ' s present and future must end , but what kind of policy should be adopted ? The answer must be found this time in Russia , not in Washington , world_banks or American universities . Deeply wounded , polarized and angry , Russia desperately needs moderate , consensual , gradual reforms . More shocks will almost certainly send some rough beast slouching toward the Kremlin . A coalition of Russian moderates -- &quot; centrists &quot; who see themselves trapped between Yeltsin and Zhirinovsky -- is struggling to emerge as a political force capable of reshaping the reform process , with or without Yeltsin . Some such moderate bloc is Russia ' s best hope , and possibly last chance , for democratic and market reform . If so , it is also our only hope for a Russia engaged in progressive change at_home rather than a pursuit of lost power abroad . The Clinton_Administration , until now an opponent of moderation in Russian politics , must adopt a new and moderate principle of its own : that the United States does not have the wisdom , right or power to intervene so deeply in Russia ' s internal affairs ; all attempts to do so will backfire perilously . On that principle , the United States will withdraw its excessive presence in Russia , cease its dogmatic sermons and dollar-laden ultimatums and encourage Russia to find its destiny , as it must , within its own circumstances and possibilities . And when -- or for pessimists , if -- Russia finds its own way toward political and economic reform , even if it is not ours , the Clinton_Administration will be able to give generous financial assistance , as it must , that is both productive and honorable .</TEXT>
