   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : NEWPORT BEACH ; CITY JOINS ALTERNATIVE EL TORO REUSE PANEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The City_Council has voted 6-0 to join the Orange County Regional Airport Authority . The organization is made_up of several North County cities trying to influence the future of El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station , scheduled to close by 1999 . The group was organized by Garden Grove , Los Alamitos and Stanton last summer to monitor the base conversion planning and support development of a commercial airport on the 4 # 700-acre base . Newport Beach is the first city to join the group since its inception . The airport authority &quot; will be an advocate of conversion ( of El Toro Marine Base ) to a commercial airport , &quot; Newport Beach City_Manager Kevin Murphy said at a council meeting . The council chose Mayor Clarence J . Turner as representative to the organization and Councilman John Hedges , an airline pilot , as alternate . The regional airport authority is trying to decide whether it will just monitor the work of the county ' s El Toro agency or submit a rival redevelopment plan to the Defense_Department , which will make the final_decision on civilian use of the base . Anaheim is also considering joining the regional airport authority . The county ' s nine-member El Toro Reuse Planning Authority consists_of the five county supervisors , three Irvine City_Council members and one from Lake Forest . Although Newport Beach and Anaheim had once been proposed for membership on the planning_board , they were left_off under the plan finally approved by the Board of Supervisors . North County cities and others not part of the top board of directors have been invited to join a 50-member executive_council of the reuse planning authority . That panel will also draw members from the county , representatives from seven unincorporated areas of the South County , seven business groups and four universities . BOB ELSTON</TEXT>
