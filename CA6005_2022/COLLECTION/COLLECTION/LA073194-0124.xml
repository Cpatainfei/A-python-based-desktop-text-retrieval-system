   <HEADLINE> BREATHING ; MARK O ' BRIEN ' S EXISTENCE IS CIRCUMSCRIBED BY THE 650-POUND IRON_LUNG THAT ENCASES HIS BODY AND FILLS HIS CHEST WITH AIR . BUT THE LIFE HE SHAPES INSIDE IS AS VITAL , AND AS URGENT , AS BREATH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the morning ' s mail there is a manila envelope with Mark ' s return_address in Berkeley . I heft the parcel : just a_few pages . As usual I go_through all_the other things first -- the bills , a weekly solicitation for an environmental cause , a magazine from the college sorority of which I was briefly a member . Skimming this silly publication , habitually tossed_in the trash immediately upon receipt , briefly delays the moment I will finally pick_up the envelope and open it . Inside there is a Xeroxed_copy of an article and a brief note from Mark in handwriting that is not his since he has none ; he has been unable to hold a writing instrument in his hand since he was paralyzed with polio at the age of 6 . Now 45 , he seldom leaves the massive iron_lung that fills his chest with air 18 times a minute , its sibilant gasp measuring the rhythm of his days and nights . Different attendants handle his personal correspondence , and the handwriting varies accordingly . I let_out a little sigh . The reminders of Mark ' s gargantuan physical incapacity drift over everything , like a sandstorm that seeps not only through the closed doors and windows but beneath the rolled-up towels pressed against them . Even this simple note dusts my fingers with the powdery residue of fear and discomfort that taints so many encounters between the crippled and the able-bodied . &quot; I ' m the skull on the desk , &quot; Mark said once , matter-of-factly . The what ? &quot; You know , the skull , the death ' s head , the reminder of death. &quot; Mark O ' Brien , memento_mori , the ultimate party_pooper . This was his explanation for the disquietude I ' d encountered when I told people about him . I myself believed it wasn ' t the fear of death that O ' Brien evoked but the specter of a life so circumscribed that most people assume it is not worth living , and therefore not worth considering : condemned to eat , drink , laugh , cry , urinate , sleep , awaken and someday sicken and die while encased from the neck down in a 6-foot-long , 650-pound steel cylinder . His head is permanently turned_to the right and his view of the world is from a prone position ; his scoliosis , or curvature of the spine , is so severe that if strapped upright in a wheelchair , his lungs and diaphragm would crumple and he could not breathe . Most of the time , O ' Brien is alone in his apartment ; almost all_the time he is without the touch of another human_being -- except the people he pays to come three times a day to feed , wash and dress him . If he has an itch , he cannot scratch it ; if a roach crawls across his face , he cannot bat it away . A published poet and journalist , he connects to the world outside his shabby apartment off Telegraph Avenue by means of a single crude instrument : a 12-inch stick_with a plastic bulb on one end that he seizes between his teeth . With this mouthstick , he can rotate a small , revolving table next to his head that holds his radio , tape_recorder and phone switch , and operate each in turn with a series of firm taps . He types on an old computer with the stick , and he uses it to turn the pages of books and magazines propped on the table . Once when the stick broke , O ' Brien was helpless , unable to even call 911 , until his roommate came_home seven hours later . What does_it gain us to consider such an existence ? Our first reaction is to turn_away , an act that further diminishes those whose bodies have failed them . &quot; When polio first appeared as an epidemic malady at the end of the 19th Century , people who were paralyzed were treated like the victims of a wasting_disease , suddenly lifted_out of the mainstream of life and transported to a special alternate universe reserved for those who are waiting to die , &quot; wrote Jane S . Smith in &quot; Patenting the Sun , &quot; the history of the Salk vaccine . &quot; The only problem was , they weren ' t dying . . . . They were simply crippled. &quot; Like the machine that enables his child-sized recumbent body to breathe , O ' Brien is a forgotten relic of a disease that has faded from the public consciousness . Polio was once more virulent than AIDS in this country : 333 # 000 cases were reported in the decade between 1946 and 1956 -- more_than the total number diagnosed with AIDS between 1982 and 1992 . Even the March of Dimes has distanced itself from polio , no longer raising funds in its victims ' behalf and focusing instead on birth_defects . For Americans under 35 , most of whom were vaccinated in early_childhood , polio arouses no more dread than smallpox , which is now extinct . Today only 120 iron_lungs are still in_use by aging polio victims , according to Lifecare International , the Colorado firm that maintains the old machines with March of Dimes funds . The iron_lung was invented to assist people whose breathing muscles or respiratory nerve_centers were paralyzed , until they recovered sufficiently to breathe on_their_own . Unlike modern positive-pressure ventilators , which push air into the trachea , the iron_lung forms an airtight chamber around the body and momentarily creates a vacuum inside the chest . This mimics the natural_action of the diaphragm , causing air to rush into the lungs . Because of its bulk , immobility and generally horrific aspect , the iron_lung wasn ' t intended to be a permanent way_of_life . This was the worst fear of the doctors who tested the first primitive devices 60 years ago -- that they would enable the sickest &quot; polios , &quot; those with the poorest prognosis , to linger on and on . &quot; Many of the patients were so severely handicapped that often we felt guilty at saving their lives , &quot; recalled Dr. James L . Wilson in his book , &quot; Memoirs of the Respirator. &quot; O ' Brien was that kind of patient , and he has had his fill of this sort of talk , the way guilt slides so easily into regret , a smooth segue from &quot; You poor sonofabitch , how can you live this way ? &quot; to &quot; You shouldn ' t have to live this way , &quot; and , finally : &quot; You shouldn ' t have to live. &quot; It ' s a slippery slope to negotiate as the national health_care debate raises questions about whose life we can afford to prolong , and whose we can ' t . In an essay for Pacific News Service a decade ago , O ' Brien deplored the publicity given Elizabeth Bouvia , a disabled woman who at that time was seeking a court_order allowing her to starve herself to death in a California nursing_home . A former social_worker with a college degree , she told reporters she was tired_of living with cerebral_palsy , which had paralyzed her since birth . ( Bouvia lost her lawsuit and now lives_in a Los Angeles hospital. ) O ' Brien saw Bouvia as a whiner , and a dangerous one at that , for spreading the notion that death is preferable to disability . &quot; Along with other disabled people , I resent her saying this , &quot; wrote O ' Brien , who was far more handicapped than Bouvia . His own Irish Catholic upbringing in blue-collar South Boston instilled a stoicism perfectly fitted to what some clinicians term the classic &quot; polio personality &quot; -- determined to achieve , loath to complain . &quot; We fear able-bodied people will think her longing for death and pity is typical of all_of us . It isn ' t . We want to live . We don ' t want pity. &quot; Yet long after meeting O ' Brien , I still did not know how to write_about him without succumbing to pity and worn cliches . &quot; I think the fact of Mark ' s existence can defeat writing , defeat interpretation , without bathos or some vice creeping into it , &quot; says John Carnahan , O ' Brien ' s longtime attendant . &quot; It always struck me as a very difficult thing . Even in the writings of disabled people themselves , disability is something they don ' t get around. &quot; Then the mail arrived containing the note from O ' Brien and a short_story from The Sun , a literary magazine out of North Carolina in which his work has occasionally appeared . This story , however , was written by Gillian Kendall , the roommate of one of O ' Brien ' s former attendants . Its narrator is a young_woman who takes_care of a paralyzed man four days a week , and as her emotional attachment to &quot; Joe &quot; grows , so does her disconsolate guilt over her pleasantly aimless postgraduate life , complete with lover , while Joe suffers alone . The story is dedicated to Mark O ' Brien : &quot; At the time I thought_about Joe ' s disability this way : I regretted it had happened to such a nice guy -- as if polio would ' ve been OK for , say , Phyllis Schlafly or Al Haig -- but I wondered if he was so nice partly because of what he ' d been through . Was he made patient by hospitals or humbled by pain ? No , I thought , no one else ' s character improved under stress : Susan ' s eating disorder didn ' t mellow her snobbery , Tim ' s awkwardness didn ' t make him more eager to please , my own vague loneliness didn ' t lessen my critical nature . If Joe were de-paralyzed , I thought , he ' d still speak quietly , sit straight but relaxed , remember birthdays , laugh_at all jokes , return phone_calls promptly and visit the sick . He would remain reliable and sweet , better than my friends and I. &quot; I , too , had pondered the genesis of O ' Brien ' s character and his remarkable ability to endure . Polio had altered his experience of life so profoundly it was impossible to extricate the de-paralyzed O ' Brien from the real one . You hear of people &quot; struck_down &quot; in their prime ; Mark never had a prime . Most of his childhood , and all_of his adolescence and adulthood has been constricted , to an extent barely imaginable , not only by his paralysis but also by the tank that cradles him in its permanent grasp . He never rode a bike , never drove a car , never had a girlfriend , never slept_over at a friend ' s house , never played baseball . A list of all his nevers would fill a book . And yet . Meeting O ' Brien , being with him , one gets no sense of this at all . Observant , funny , seemingly without self-pity , O ' Brien doesn ' t talk like a man sequestered from the world , but who seeks engagement at every turn . Stripped of the physical realm of ordinary existence , he reveals the human spirit laid bare to the bone , its ravenous hunger for life -- for one more day , one more hour , another breath , a tick of the pulse . In Mark ' s oddly youthful face , soft and still unlined in his mid-40s , you can almost see a naked beating heart , vital and frighteningly vulnerable . Like Joe ' s caretaker , I wished I could right the wrong of his misfortune . But I could not reconfigure the universe . All I could do was brush away the dust of fear and guilt , and get_on_with the job of telling Mark ' s story . IT WAS SEPTEMBER , RIGHT BEFORE HE WAS TO START FIRST_GRADE IN Dorchester -- the natives pronounce it DAH-chestah -- in South Boston . It would be more_than 20 years before he entered a classroom again . Helen O ' Brien : &quot; He was complaining about pains in his stomach and we sent him to the hospital right away . Remember ? It was evening time after supper . I put the kids to bed and he was complaining . He wasn ' t the sort of kid to complain unless something was bothering him anyhow . So we took him right to the hospital . He was able to walk in . They did a spinal_tap and that was it. &quot; Walter O ' Brien : &quot; Most of the kids around him died there. &quot; Helen O ' Brien : &quot; The ones that were real bad did , yeah. &quot; Walter O ' Brien : &quot; No worse than Mark. &quot; There is a haunting sameness to the stories of polio children during the epidemic years of the 1940s and ' 50s . From the precipice of robust , youthful health , they fall suddenly ill . Their families suspect the worst . There is the doctor ' s hurried visit , for those were the days when doctors still made house calls ; the rush to the hospital ; the spinal_tap , the dreaded diagnosis , the polio ward . From this point on , their stories rupture : Most got better , miraculously better . Some did not , a failure deemed faintly shameful . The American myth held that one did not succumb to polio , but fought , overcame , surmounted it by strength of will -- like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who locked his limp legs in braces to appear to be standing on_his_own . Walter O ' Brien : &quot; Even in the March of Dimes , they always showed those little kids walking with sticks , you know : This ain ' t too_bad . A cute kid . Send money . They always showed the very least disabled . They never did show the iron_lung concept , they tried to keep that quiet . that ' s my opinion. &quot; Helen O ' Brien : &quot; People said , oh well , my kid -- he fought , he came_back . Well , maybe he fought , but they don ' t all come back. &quot; Mark got polio in 1955 , along with 28 # 984 other people in the United States . Only a_few months earlier , Dr. Jonas Salk had gained worldwide celebrity for developing the first poliomyelitis vaccine . But after children in California and Idaho contracted polio from a batch of hastily formulated vaccine , the Massachusetts medical society halted inoculations . While doctors argued over the safety of the vaccine , a polio epidemic hit the Boston area that summer . Mark was among the last stricken . Within hours of his arrival at Children ' s Hospital in Boston , he was put_in an iron_lung . There were 1 # 043 deaths from polio that year , but children of the ' 50s knew that the truly unlucky victims were those in the iron_lungs . Their bodies were swallowed_up by machines that would forever define the concept -- as any child could plainly see -- of a fate worse than death . Poliomyelitis is a notoriously capricious virus , usually no more disabling than the flu , which its early symptoms resemble . For centuries , human_beings have fallen ill with polio and recovered with no ill effects . Mark was part of the small minority -- less than 4 % -- in whom the virus penetrates the inner core of the spinal_cord and brain_stem , where motor impulses arise and are transmitted to the muscles . Inside this slender channel -- the switching station , so to speak , for voluntary movement -- the disease causes lesions that rapidly kill_off large motor_nerve cells . Once destroyed , they cannot regenerate themselves as do cells in other large organs . Paralysis results , sometimes within hours of the first symptoms . Though statistically infrequent , cases of paralysis mount_up alarmingly during a polio epidemic such_as the one in 1952 , which infected nearly 58 # 000 people in the United States . Thus polio became famous not for its normal mild manifestation , but its worst-case scenario . Where the paralysis strikes depends_on what microscopic portions of the spinal_cord are affected , and how many motor_neurons ultimately survive . A patient might walk , but be unable to chew or swallow ; use one arm and leg , but not the others . Limbs that are paralyzed at first may later regain movement . This happens when motor_neurons are merely shocked by the swelling caused when adjacent nerve_cells are destroyed ; after the swelling subsides , those living cells begin to work again . They may overcompensate , sprouting new connections to muscle_fibers that had been inactivated by dead neurons . The sprouting phenomenon , as much as strength of will , is responsible_for the satisfying sagas of polio victims who managed to cast_off their leather braces and wheelchairs , and walk . But over the years , the multibranched neurons tend to burn_out , something like an electric_outlet burdened with too many extension_cords . This is one of the leading explanations for post-polio syndrome , which paradoxically afflicts many of those who were most successful in &quot; overcoming &quot; polio . Their number includes Roosevelt , whose weakened condition prior to his death in 1945 was caused , some polio experts say , by post-polio syndrome . At Children ' s Hospital in Boston , where pivotal research in the battle against polio had been carried_out , Mark refused to die . And his limbs and trunk refused to move , despite the hospital ' s arsenal of rehabilitative weapons : rocking beds ( which used gravity to aid breathing ) , hot baths , physical_therapy . &quot; The dominant theory was stretch it till it hurts , then stretch it a little more , &quot; he says , a painful and outdated regimen that led to a lifelong fear of being lifted , moved or immersed in water . When there was nothing more to be done , the doctors sent him home , where he lived_in an iron_lung . Outside it , he could breathe for only a_few hours before the effort exhausted him . Helen O ' Brien : &quot; Actually we fought to get him home because we didn ' t like the situation there . We felt as though he wasn ' t getting the attention he needed . We felt as though we could do_it . And we did. &quot; Walter O ' Brien : &quot; Which was a big mistake . The doctor told me at the time , you don ' t realize what you ' re getting_in for . And we both were righteously indignant . . . ( but ) he was correct . From the first_grade on through high_school , Helen had to take_care of him day and night , feed him three times a day , bathe him , bowel_movements . Twelve years of school she handled . She had to do all_the work . Helen kept the therapy up for a long , long_time with no result. &quot; Helen O ' Brien : &quot; The limbs , the arms , the legs , lifting the torso . You could only push him so far , because the joints were terribly stiff and , of course , I didn ' t want to hurt him. &quot; Walter O ' Brien : &quot; And for all those years . . . we just kept going . All those years we were never able to go anyplace together -- one of us always had to be home . That was every day_of_the_week . I think Helen deserves tremendous credit . I think a lot of women would have walked away , years ago. &quot; Helen O ' Brien ' s large blue eyes , Mark ' s eyes , blink as if she ' s fighting_back tears . &quot; Another thing that made_it easier , &quot; she adds , &quot; was he was a very intelligent person , an easy person to live with . He didn ' t complain . Never. &quot; THEIR OLDEST CHILD ' S POLIO WAS THE FIRST IN a series of tribulations for the O ' Briens . Mark ' s sister Karen , three years younger , died_suddenly of pneumonia when she was 7 . His other sister , Rachel , born after Karen ' s death , is diabetic and already a widow ; her young husband died of kidney_failure . ( Only Mark ' s 43-year-old brother , Ken , a trial_lawyer in Sacramento , has escaped serious illness . Mark ' s siblings played alongside him at_home , and sometimes his mother wheeled him outside on his hospital cot to watch the games of neighborhood children . But for the most part he lived_on the periphery of activity , the iron_lung relegated to converted garages and back bedrooms of the family ' s various homes -- first in Boston and later in Sacramento , where his father was chief counsel of the Sacramento Army Depot . Aside from his mother ' s stretching exercises , he received no rehabilitative physical_therapy . He never returned to school ; visiting teachers supervised the course work for his high_school equivalency degree . There was no such thing as &quot; mainstreaming. &quot; His Catholic confirmation took_place not with the usual ritual in the church sanctuary , but in the sacristy , out_of_sight of parishioners . &quot; The priest said he didn ' t want Mark to be embarrassed , &quot; says Walter O ' Brien , the memory still rankling him . &quot; It wasn ' t Mark he was thinking about. &quot; Because of the logistics involved , there were few family vacations . Once the O ' Briens traveled_to Quebec , an excursion that started_out pleasantly enough until they got_to the Cathedral of Ste . Anne-de-Beaupre , where a hidden agenda was revealed . As Mark described in his 1982 article , &quot; How I Became a Human Being &quot; : &quot; The thing I recall most vividly is the enormous stone_wall covered with casts , crutches and various devices associated with illness . All of these things , we were told , had been discarded by people who had made the pilgrimage to the shrine of Ste . Anne , had prayed with devotion to the saint and had sprinkled themselves with the holy_water which was available there . I realized that the purpose of the trip was not to see the red-jacketed Canadian soldiers in the Citadel or the Canada Dry bottling plant in downtown Quebec . The purpose of the trip was to find some means whereby I could get_out of the terrible bind which polio had put me in . . . . To think that all_of these strangers should be praying for me , that my parents should have gone_to the trouble and expense of bringing us all up here and that thisentire religious enterprise was directed towards people like me was more_than I could bear. &quot; After his brother started college , Mark ' s isolation increased . He weighed only 65 pounds but was getting harder for his mother to lift and care_for . &quot; To keep_from hurting her , I began to spend more and more of my time in my room reading , watching television and listening to the radio . Except for medical appointments , I never left , &quot; he wrote . &quot; I could see . . . that life was passing me by. &quot; The depth of his loneliness is seen in a passage from his unfinished autobiographical novel , in which a social_worker probes the paralyzed &quot; Paul &quot; for details about his personal life . Paul answers warily : &quot; I ' m not sure what you want to know . My life ' s been pretty much boring since I got polio. &quot; &quot; I ' ll let you in on a secret , Paul , &quot; she said , smiling again . &quot; My life ' s pretty much boring , too . Filling_out reports , sitting on staff committees , drinking stale coffee because the vending machine ' s broken . But everybody ' s bored in a different way . So tell me how it ' s been boring for you . Do you get_out often , have any friends , know any women ? &quot; &quot; No . Not really . I mean . . . none of those things . I just stay in my room , watch TV . I have subscriptions to Newsweek and Esquire , so I read a little. &quot; Jesus_Christ ! How could she ask such stupid questions ? Of course , I don ' t know any women ! I never leave the goddamned house . And she can see how ugly and deformed I am . Women don ' t unbutton their blouses for bony monsters like me . . . His right eye began to tear , although he did not know why . It was blunt-spoken Walter O ' Brien who pushed his son out of the nest after reading about the Physically Disabled Students Residential Program at UC Berkeley . The state_Department of Rehabilitation paid tuition and expenses for qualified students , who lived_in a dorm on campus with a 24-hour attendant and learned the skills they needed to live_on their own . The elder O ' Brien contacted the agency , but was told by the staff that Mark &quot; couldn ' t physically do_it , couldn ' t go_through college with his disability. &quot; O ' Brien , a former worker at the Boston Navy_Yard who had gone_to school on the GI Bill , bulldozed his way to Ed Roberts , the agency director . ( He now heads the World Institute on Disability in Oakland. ) Roberts was a Berkeley graduate who also slept_in an iron_lung . &quot; I made_it very clear that I wanted Mark to have the same opportunity he had , &quot; recalls Walter O ' Brien . &quot; So he said sit_down , we ' ll talk . I talked_about Mark ' s condition . I said it was very bad , but if anyone can do this , he can . Shortly after that , we got him into the program. &quot; But it would be another two years before he could actually begin classes at Berkeley . In 1976 , at the age of 27 , Mark and his iron_lung were loaded into a van and he left home for good . He entered the Kaiser Foundation Rehabilitation Center in Vallejo for evaluation -- supposedly a first_step on the route to Berkeley . He had mixed feelings about going . &quot; I knew I had to get_out . It was something I wanted to do but either I was too afraid or too passive to do_it . I could see my parents getting older , too old to take_care of me . I had them scared shitless . I was just like them -- I didn ' t know what else to do. &quot; After he left home , his parents got their chance to travel -- to Europe , Hawaii , the Caribbean , Hong Kong . Mark has never been back to their comfortable ranch-style home outside Sacramento . Compared to the 20 years of unnatural intimacy forced by his paralysis , his relationship with his parents seems distant now , suffused with sadness . &quot; They ' ve had a terrible life , just dealing with their children -- all this disease and disability , &quot; Mark says . He believes they never recovered from the loss of his younger sister -- the healthy child , not the sick one -- whom he recalls in a poem from &quot; Breathing , &quot; a collection of his poetry published in 1990 . * Your only playful sibling was your father , Our father , who ' s not in Heaven , Who howled like a wolf when he learned of your death , The most frightening sound I ever heard . Death was waiting for me , I thought ; Imagine my surprise when death took you , You , instead of me . * At Kaiser Hospital , O ' Brien underwent a new kind of physical_therapy , reviving his childhood hopes that his paralysis would miraculously improve . Though every day he felt stronger , Kaiser soon rendered the same bleak prognosis O ' Brien had gotten_at Children ' s Hospital in Boston : His motor_neurons were beyond salvage . Medi-Cal would not pay O ' Brien ' s bill at Kaiser if there was no possibility of rehabilitation , so within a month he was shipped off again -- to Fairmont Hospital in San Leandro , a large county-owned hospital that provided nursing_care for quadriplegics . &quot; They had a polio ward and people just got warehoused there , &quot; recalls Karen Topp Goodwyn , a former Department of Rehabilitation counselor . From the moment he moved_into the room he shared with a comatose patient , O ' Brien hated Fairmont , but the doctors refused his pleas to return to Kaiser . He applied to Berkeley but was rejected . He was trapped . Two things gave him hope : enrolling in classes at Cal State Hayward ( the college sent a van to the hospital to pick him up ) and learning how to operate a British-made typing device called a Possum . Each character on the keyboard responded to a pattern of beeps activated by microswitches that O ' Brien bumped with his chin . The Possum was clunky and slow , but it gave O ' Brien a way to put_on paper the words that were piling_up in his brain . * I swear Garcia was a crazy bitch A nurse who ' d swing me about in the Hoyer lift With enough abandon to scare me , but careful , so she could say : &quot; Now what was all_the yelling about ? Yo u polios are screamers . Always were. &quot; Exhausted by the turnings and the dips , I didn ' t say a word . She ' d push me to Occupational Therapy , Where I ' d type my skinny novel , think_about revenge . -- &quot; Mrs . Garcia , &quot; from &quot; Breathing &quot; * IT TOOK TWO MORE YEARS AND A RELENTLESS LOBBYING EFFORT BY Walter O ' Brien before his son was finally admitted to Berkeley in June , 1978 . Mark was almost 30 years old , full of yearning and without a clue as_to how to manage his own life . He soon found_out . At Berkeley , a bold effort was under way to give severely disabled young people an education at one of the finest public universities in the country . At Goodwyn ' s behest , the Department of Rehabilitation funneled dozens of quadriplegics into Berkeley ' s residential program for disabled students , which set them up in a dorm with a full-time attendant during their first year . ( After that they were usually expected to make their own living arrangements. ) Critics carped at the cost -- about $ 12 # 000 per student , paid by the state -- but it was cheap compared to a room in a nursing_home . And it offered a crucial dividend : a chance for an independent life . &quot; We were really trying to get people into a university setting because that opened so many doors , &quot; Goodwyn says now . &quot; Some of these people truly did not have the academic prowess to succeed at Berkeley , but I still wanted to give them the opportunity to develop independent living skills and get_out . So we took a lot of risks . There were no other options for a lot of people at that time. &quot; During the heyday of the program in the ' 70s and ' 80s , about 250 severely disabled young people entered Berkeley through the residential program . O ' Brien was ecstatic to be one of them . Television_news cameras filmed his yellow iron_lung as it swung by a crane through a dormitory window . Attendants pushed him to class in a reclining wheelchair and treated him as he had never been treated before -- as an adult . &quot; Society didn ' t expect much of them and we expected a lot , &quot; says former director Susan O ' Hara , a polio survivor herself . &quot; We expected that everybody would be able to function on_their_own . There was rarely a person who didn ' t make it. &quot; Recalls O ' Brien : &quot; They helped me with practical things like dealing with the bank . Also they insisted on making me pretend I was living_by myself so I would have to deal directly with the attendants I hired . I couldn ' t expect some daddy figure to deal with them . I had to accept the idea I was in_charge , which was very difficult for me in the beginning . I had to be my own social_worker , dealing with four or five different agencies . I had to learn not to be intimidated by the bureaucracies and to insist , insist , insist and make myself a real pain in the ass. &quot; AFTER MUCH TRIAL AND ERROR , rehabilitation engineers at Stanford_University built a customized electric gurney , which he could operate with pressure from his left foot and knee -- the only parts of his body below the neck he can move . It was another milestone , giving O ' Brien the means to go where he wanted , when he wanted , by himself . Flat on his back , he used mirrors to negotiate bumpy sidewalks , through crowds of people ; startled students wondered if he was being guided by remote_control . Steering the gurney was exhausting and dangerous ; he once careened over a curb and dumped himself into busy Telegraph Avenue . It took him an hour and 15 minutes to go from one side of campus to the other . But he would n ' t give_up . &quot; I wanted to show I could be like all_the other cripples in Berkeley . It ' s some big manhood ritual to be independent and control your own wheelchair , &quot; O ' Brien says . Quadriplegics commonly take six or seven years to graduate from college , but O ' Brien made_it in five , earning a BA in English and a 3.4 grade-point average . Then came another reversal of fortune . Shortly after entering graduate_school in journalism , his health collapsed . To his surprise , post-polio syndrome had caught_up_with him . &quot; I didn ' t think my physical condition could get any worse , &quot; he said . He was wrong . His capacity to stay outside the iron_lung diminished dramatically , and he dropped_out of school . He could no longer go_on outings alone or without a portable respirator . The electric gurney , symbol of his struggle to become independent , sat unused in his apartment . Eventually he gave it to a medical mission in Nicaragua . Post-polio syndrome spun O ' Brien to the outer margin of the statistical backwash from the polio epidemic of the ' 50s . Of the estimated 600 # 000 or so survivors of paralytic polio who live_in the United States , a tiny minority are -- like O ' Brien and Ed Roberts , who now uses a ventilator full time during his waking hours -- wholly dependent_on mechanical ventilation . However , their number is growing as thousands of polio survivors are newly weakened by the syndrome . For the past 15 years , O ' Brien ' s home has been the living room of his small apartment near the Berkeley campus . ( His roommate and emergency attendant , Bruce Ward , has the single bedroom. ) Living independently &quot; is not a matter of individual heroism , as a lot of people would like to think , &quot; he cautions . &quot; I need money from the government. &quot; In addition to Medi-Cal services , he receives about $ 18 # 000 a year from a variety of sources : Social_Security , county welfare and a federal rent subsidy program . It would cost taxpayers two times as much to support him in a nursing_home , according to figures provided by the World Institute on Disability . The same bureaucracy that gives also takes_away . Whenever O ' Brien earns more_than $ 85 a month , the Social_Security_Administration requires him to turn_over roughly 50 cents of every dollar he makes as a free-lance writer . After a nonprofit literary foundation awarded O ' Brien a $ 17 # 000 grant , the government docked his monthly disability_checks . Not until his father appealed did the agency stop ; most of the $ 4 # 000 it withheld was never refunded . Things that would make O ' Brien ' s life easier -- a better computer , for instance -- aren ' t easily acquired , even as gifts , because there are severe limits on the value of personal_property disability recipients may own . The old Toshiba on which O ' Brien now writes is_on loan from a friend . The linchpin of independent life for the disabled in California is the In Home Support Services_program , which enables O ' Brien to pay the half-dozen attendants who each work for him four to 10 hours a week . They make about $ 8 an hour -- the going rate in Berkeley . Part secretary , part practical_nurse , part companion , they do everything from shopping and cooking to emptying his bedpan and changing his urine bag . Many days , his attendants are the only people O ' Brien sees . He interviews and hires them and , when necessary , fires them . &quot; that ' s something people have to learn , to fire people who aren ' t doing the job or who are abusing them in some way , &quot; says O ' Brien . &quot; Sometimes it ' s very rough emotionally. &quot; When one of his favorite attendants refused to take orders one day , O ' Brien felt forced to let him go . &quot; It was awful . I kept thinking_about what a shit he was and how much I hated him , and I cried because I missed him , and I hated it that things were this way. &quot; Mark continues to write book_reviews , essays , poems and occasional journalism pieces , tapping the words one letter at a time with his mouthstick . His articles for Pacific News Service have appeared in the San Francisco Bay Guardian and the Oakland Tribune , and recently he edited the disability section of the upcoming Millennium Whole Earth Catalog . Several of his poems are about baseball , his lifelong passion , and in the author ' s description for one of his poetry articles , he wrote : &quot; In baseball_season he roots for the San Francisco Giants ; in winter he gets depressed. &quot; Though most of his work deals with disability , he resists being a standard-bearer for the cause . Hence his dismay when he attended a news_conference hosted by the noted physicist Stephen Hawking , who is paralyzed and speechless as a result of amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis , and found a radio reporter ' s microphone thrust in his own face : * &quot; She asked me whether seeing Dr. Hawking gave me hope . This struck me as an awfully stupid question . Hope for what ? Could Dr. Hawking change my life , make me walk , get me a lover ? I tried to think_of a polite way to answer her . ' It ' s not that , so_much , as uh . . . He gives me a sense of ' hurray for our side. ' &quot; &quot; What was I saying ? God knows . I just didn ' t want to get sucked into being cast as a Spokesperson for the Disabled in a dreary story headlined &quot; Disabled Inspired by Dr. Hawking. &quot; -- From &quot; The Unification of Steven Hawking &quot; in The Fessenden Review . * Hawking , who married , fathered children , separated and now has a girlfriend , did not became disabled until early adulthood , which O ' Brien believes is an advantage . &quot; You see that with disabled veterans , with people who were disabled when they were teen-agers or in their 20s . They have more confidence , more self-esteem . The experience of going_through puberty makes a person more independent . I envy that . It ' s something I missed. &quot; But is it possible that the sense of loss is more heightened in those people , that they are angrier with their fate ? O ' Brien ' s answer makes_it clear only an able-bodied person would ask such a dumb question . &quot; We ' re all angry , &quot; he says . JOHN CARNAHAN KNOWS Mark O ' Brien in ways that a lover might , or a mother . Before he came_to work for O ' Brien five years ago , his girlfriend Chandra had shared O ' Brien ' s apartment and worked as his attendant for eight years . &quot; My best_friend , &quot; O ' Brien calls her . It is an axiom of disabled life that one ' s closest relationships are often formed with one ' s employees . &quot; Mark has had to spend a long_time learning how to interact with people -- Chandra helped him a lot with that , &quot; says Carnahan . O ' Brien was characteristically persistent in achieving sociability . &quot; He ' s a very stubborn person , an indomitable person , very relentless. &quot; A graduate_student at Cal State Hayward , Carnahan says he became an attendant because &quot; it was the only job I could get . I ' m not qualified to work_at Jack in the Box . In addition to that , I ' m doing something personal and useful . I don ' t have the contempt for this job I might have for others. &quot; Carnahan speaks_to O ' Brien in such a low , gentle voice that I cannot make_out what he ' s saying , though I ' m sitting only six feet away . He makes a sandwich for O ' Brien ' s lunch , tears_off pieces and feeds them to him with bites of a pickle and sips from a bottled drink . He cleans O ' Brien ' s glasses and settles them on his face . He opens the iron_lung to take_off the clothes the morning attendant had put_on O ' Brien a_few hours earlier , clothes he no longer needs to wear because he doesn ' t feel strong enough for an outing today , has not felt strong enough for weeks now . ( Carnahan quit in March , married Chandra and is now concentrating_on his graduate work . O ' Brien has since hired a new attendant. ) Before leaving the room , I notice O ' Brien is wearing a handsome multicolored shirt of a vaguely ethnic weave , and that his small body is lost inside his clothing . Only his hands are revealed , slender and seemingly boneless , like empty white gloves , with an invalid ' s long fingernails . There is a small teddy_bear beside him on the narrow mattress that slides into the iron_lung . Its name , O ' Brien informs me later , is Maurice . Standing_in O ' Brien ' s kitchen , I get_a_whiff of the smell of a urine bag being changed . ( O ' Brien ' s paralysis does not affect bladder and bowel control , sexual potency or ability to feel ; the external catheter he wears is for convenience , not necessity . &quot; Except for my lungs , &quot; he has noted ironically , &quot; all_of my internal_organs work well. &quot; In fact , he seldom sees a doctor. ) Time passes with exaggerated slowness , not only because I am lingering awkwardly in the kitchen , but because O ' Brien ' s voice is getting weaker as the oxygen leaks_out of him . I can hardly wait for the iron_lung to start_up again , and it occurs to me that O ' Brien must feel that way , too . Bristling with metal gauges and locking levers and screwed-down portholes , the massive yellow tank aroused such a strong sense of dread during our first interview that I could scarcely think_of anything else . It overwhelmed the cramped living_room and swallowed O ' Brien up , its huge padded collar clamped so tightly under his chin that he appeared to have no neck , not to mention a body . His Boston-accented speech was breathy and flat and the words ran together in bursts , on the exhale , punctuated by the rhythmic wheezing sound of the leather bellows on the iron_lung . Though it was sunny out , the room was dark ; it hasn ' t been painted since 1979 and faces a bleak alley . Little roaches occasionally darted across the table next to O ' Brien ' s head . When it was time to go , I almost bolted for the street . I walked for a long_time in the late spring afternoon , gulping air and taking long strides . My arms and legs -- how strong they felt , how perfectly coordinated . Everyone , everything in Berkeley seemed full_of_life . The students were young and beautiful . Even the old hippies looked healthy , vigorous . The town gardens were bursting with new roses and tangled vines of jasmine , seasonal glories that seemed a world away from O ' Brien ' s depressing quarters . &quot; Sometimes I have dreams where I figure_out how to walk , &quot; he says . &quot; In the dream I think , oh , all I have to do is that ! It ' s something I go round and round in my head about . Like why can ' t I walk ? Is it me that can ' t walk or is it my body that can ' t walk ? Is it my mind , my brain or my body ? If it ' s me that can ' t walk , then it ' s my responsibility I got polio . Why would I get polio ? It just goes_on and on and on . . . . Part of the problem with getting a virus is not only is a virus invisible , it ' s very abstract . It ' d be easy if I ' d been hit by a truck because I could see the truck. &quot; The iron_lung is an umbilical_cord that keeps growing shorter . &quot; We used to be able to go_to a restaurant and he could stay out for an hour and a half without his ventilator , &quot; says his father . &quot; His lungs are very weak now. &quot; He has been to only two movies in the past year -- &quot; Much Ado About Nothing &quot; and &quot; The Crying Game &quot; -- and hasn ' t been to Candlestick Park to see his beloved Giants play since 1990 . Perhaps because polio warped the skeletal_structure of his breathing cage so young , he doesn ' t tolerate ventilators well ; after only three or four hours he needs the tank again . &quot; He ' s more likely to push his limits than not . He ' s the kind of person who will go_out and ride around until he becomes very sick , &quot; says Carnahan , who was with O ' Brien in 1991 when he became ill at the California Shakespeare Festival at Orinda . They couldn ' t get the Berkeley &quot; crip van &quot; to pick them up early , and O ' Brien had to be hospitalized for dehydration . He quickly developed pneumonia , and there was talk_about putting him back in a nursing_home . &quot; I decided I ' d rather be dead than in an institution . There ' s a doctors ' myth that disabled people need 24-hour care . If you never ever want anything to go_wrong , I guess you could say that , but I ' d rather take my chances , &quot; says O ' Brien , whose memories of hospitals and the nursing_home include being left for long periods_of_time with his naked bottom in a bedpan when he failed to defecate upon command . &quot; Here I have control over my body , what I eat , what I do . I ' d like to be able to write and listen to baseball_games . I figure if I ' m in a hospital , someone would steal my computer and there ' d be so_much noise I would n ' t be able to listen to a radio . Anything valuable in a hospital gets stolen. &quot; One of the grave risks O ' Brien faces is that the machinery that keeps him alive will fail . Years ago he heard about a patient who had lived_on his own in Berkeley and suffocated when the fan_belt on his iron_lung broke . If the power to his iron_lung goes_out , O ' Brien can switch to the portable ventilator -- but only if someone is there to turn it on for him . Without a key to his apartment , no one can enter to help him because the electronic switch that he taps to open the door doesn ' t work . So far he ' s been lucky ; none of the blackouts have lasted more_than 45 minutes . During a recent outage , his screams attracted the attention of a neighbor , who called 911 . Firefighters carrying a portable generator were ready to force their way in when the power came_back on . Death is one of the subjects his parents don ' t bring_up . &quot; We never discussed it , &quot; says his mother . &quot; We ' ve always tried to act_as if nothing was wrong. &quot; Says his father : &quot; He ' s always accepted it could be any day . He don ' t get depressed about it . We talk sports a lot . We talk_about writing . It ' ll take more_than this to lick him . The doctors said he ' s not gonna last , and he did . He ' s got a great will to live. &quot; Another verboten subject is sex . Nine years ago , at the age of 36 , he happily lost his virginity with a professional surrogate , a woman who is paid to help men work_out their sexual difficulties . In a moving article he wrote for The Sun , O ' Brien described seeing his naked body in a mirror that the surrogate brought_to one of their assignations . He had not seen his genitals since he was 6 years old , before polio had twisted his body out_of_sight below his chest . &quot; No one in my family had ever discussed sex around me . The attitude I absorbed was not so_much that polite people never thought_about sex , but that no one did . . . . I wanted to be loved . I wanted to be held , caressed , and valued . But my self-hatred and fear were too intense . I doubted I deserved to be loved . My frustrated sexual feelings seemed to be just another curse inflicted upon me by a cruel God. &quot; After his experience with the surrogate , O ' Brien bought a futon for his apartment in case other sexual opportunities presented themselves . So far none has . When asked why he doesn ' t hire a prostitute -- there are prostitutes in Berkeley who specialize in disabled men -- he replied that he wasn ' t interested in sex for the sake of sex . The next day , he wanted to clarify his answer . &quot; I talked_about wanting a relationship more_than sex , which I guess is true , but it ' s only part of the truth . I think I sounded too noble . Part of it is I ' m just too scared , too shy , too cheap . The thing that gets me is if she still has to be compensated monetarily , that means she must think it ' s really icky and horrible to be with me in a sexual way. &quot; Thirty-nine years of quadriplegia afford ample time to contemplate what the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins called the mountains of the mind -- &quot; . . . cliffs of fall / Frightful , sheer , no-man-fathomed. &quot; Though O ' Brien casts himself as a timid man , beset by many fears , it is impossible to know him without being struck by his courage . I searched for another word to describe it , but there it was , courage , rooted so deep I could not fathom the source . Faith is probably part of it ; O ' Brien keeps the Bible on his reading table and used to go_to Mass regularly . He is an admirer of Matthew Fox , the self-described &quot; post-denominational &quot; Oakland priest who was silenced by the Vatican for outspoken teachings that challenge traditional church_doctrine . O ' Brien has also been in counseling since 1982 . His therapist works primarily with disabled and chronically ill people , including those who are HIV-positive . She thinks polio survivors tend to have a &quot; different mentality &quot; from many other disabled people , one that fits the polio stereotype of being fighters -- &quot; they push and push. &quot; O ' Brien no longer has hopes of becoming de-paralyzed . Instead he imagines a wheelchair that he can control with his thoughts . Turn left here . Go this way . Faster . When asked what would make his life better now , his wish list is practical , restrained : &quot; I guess I ' d want a bigger apartment . There ' s barely enough room for me to get_in the wheelchair . I ' d like to be able to pay my attendants better . I ' ve been told that my pay scale is about average -- I ' d like to get_in the upper reaches . I ' d get a big four-door filing_cabinet . I ' ve been wanting one for years . I think I ' d like a better computer so I could store everything in memory , and so I could play games. &quot; Like all quadriplegics , he is vulnerable to pneumonia , urinary_tract_infections and other disorders that , in his weakened state , could kill him . But the most dangerous ailment that threatens O ' Brien and other severely disabled people is depression . He is hoping his doctor will prescribe medication to lift the cloud of despair that darkens the days when O ' Brien is too tired to write , to get dressed , to go_out . On other days , it takes surprisingly little to cheer him up . &quot; When I was seeing the surrogate , I was the opposite of depressed . I ' m happy when I ' m writing something that ' s hard but good . And when I get a new toy -- a tape_recorder or computer . When I ' m talking with people . When I ' m caught_up in a baseball_game . Baseball is the only thing that makes me yell and cheer . It ' s astonishing . Boom -- there ' s a field , it ' s huge and it ' s green and I just want to stay there forever . My fantasy is getting my iron_lung there behind home plate. &quot; During the ' 80s , O ' Brien went_to games at Candlestick with a friend , Lance Howland , an editor and former Berkeley resident . &quot; He ' s a little more of a fanatic than I am , &quot; says Howland . &quot; When the Giants blew a 10-game lead to lose the pennant ( in 1993 ) it was like driving a stake through his heart. &quot; He has known O ' Brien for 16 years , ever since he interviewed him for a story and &quot; sensed he was kind of alone -- he needed a friend. &quot; Over time , he has watched O ' Brien decline physically but grow in other ways . &quot; He ' s much more sure of himself as a writer and as a person now. &quot; Last year , O ' Brien ' s ambition was to go_to Candlestick Park just once before the season ended . He didn ' t make_it . Now he ' s hopeful again . He ' d even settle for a game at the Oakland Coliseum , &quot; if I can just overcome my pathological hatred of the A ' s. &quot; He makes_it sound carefree -- a day at the ballpark ! -- though this single excursion will take more stamina than he ' s mustered for many months . that ' s the beauty of baseball , as O ' Brien would be the first to tell you , and its indisputable advantage over our ordinary lives : There ' s always another season . The hopes of the baseball fan are reborn perennially , endlessly , a cycle of renewal as old as the game , as easy and natural as breathing itself.O '</TEXT>
