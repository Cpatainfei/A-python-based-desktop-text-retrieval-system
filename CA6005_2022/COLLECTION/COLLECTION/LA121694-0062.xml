   <HEADLINE> SPREADING THE WORD ON PROP . 187 ; IMMIGRATION : ACTIVISTS PLAN CAMPAIGN TO DISPEL UNCERTAINTY OVER MEASURE ' S STATUS IN WAKE OF FEDERAL RULING THAT PUT IT ON HOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One day after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of key portions of Proposition 187 , activists statewide were mobilizing to get the word out that the hotly debated ballot measure on immigration is_on hold indefinitely . They plan public_service announcements , neighborhood forums , distribution of pamphlets and notices in the Spanish-language media and other ethnic publications and broadcast programs . &quot; This gives us a chance to get_into the parishes , the barrios , the trade_unions , and let people know that there ' s no reason to be afraid , &quot; said Bert Corona , national director of Hermandad Mexicana , a Los Angeles-based Mexican American rights group . Widespread uncertainty about the measure ' s status has generated great anxiety in California ' s immigrant community , activists say , prompting some people to forgo medical treatment and even take their children out of school . One Eastside clinic that saw a sharp decline in the number of clients after Election_Day plans to send 200 volunteers door to door to reassure residents who are afraid that they or relatives will be turned_in to immigration officials if they seek care . Proposition 187 , approved overwhelmingly by California voters Nov . 8 , would bar illegal immigrants from receiving public education and most taxpayer-financed non-emergency health_care and social_services . Educators , social_workers , health_professionals and law_enforcement authorities would be required to report suspected illegal immigrants . Acting on a series of lawsuits challenging Proposition 187 ' s constitutionality , U.S. District Judge Mariana R . Pfaelzer in Los Angeles enjoined most of its provisions from becoming effective until a trial determines their legality . Much of the initiative will now probably be bottled_up in court for months or years -- if it ever takes_effect . On Thursday , Gov . Pete Wilson -- who made passage of Proposition 187 a cornerstone of his successful reelection campaign -- blasted the judge ' s ruling , declaring : &quot; I will not tolerate this . The voters of California will not tolerate this. &quot; But beyond continuing the court battle , it is unclear what the governor can do . State regulators continue to draft guidelines governing prospective implementation of Proposition 187 , but such directives cannot be disseminated or put into effect without court sanction . California authorities have argued that the regulations , once issued , would resolve questions about Proposition 187 ' s constitutionality . But attorneys challenging the measure disagree , and Pfaelzer , in issuing her preliminary injunction , also expressed doubts that regulatory moves alone could allay constitutional concerns . A state appeal of the judge ' s ruling is possible . An appeal , though , is far from a guaranteed success and may further delay the proposition ' s implementation . Buoyed by their success in court , Proposition 187 opponents may request that Pfaelzer also enjoin a provision that bars illegal immigrants from state-funded colleges and universities . The judge excluded that section from her injunction , although she ruled that undocumented youngsters may continue attending public elementary and secondary_schools . ( Implementation of the post-secondary educational provisions remains on hold pending resolution of a separate lawsuit filed_in state court in San Francisco. ) Pfaelzer also let stand two sections of Proposition 187 that increase penalties for the manufacture , sale and use of false documents to conceal citizenship or immigration status -- the sole provisions of the ballot measure now in_effect . In the months leading_up to trial on Proposition 187 ' s fate , lawyers plan to take depositions from state and federal_officials about the measure ' s potential effects on California ' s health , educational and law_enforcement infrastructure , said Peter A . Schey , one of the lead attorneys in the federal_court challenge . Lawyers challenging the proposition predict adverse consequences if it is implemented , including a rise in contagious_diseases and crime -- scenarios dismissed by proposition advocates as alarmist . Meantime , proposition advocates -- outraged about their rebuff in federal_court -- said Thursday that they are considering whether to step_up efforts to intervene in the case . The main purpose would be to clarify the intent of the 10-member committee that drafted the measure , said Ron Prince , who chaired the Proposition 187 campaign . &quot; We want to be sure this initiative is adequately defended , &quot; Prince said . Lawyers challenging Proposition 187 contend that its sponsors illegally stitched together a state scheme to regulate immigration -- a task reserved for the federal_government . Proposition framers deny such intentions . More on Immigration * Reprints of The Times ' &quot; Immigration &quot; series are available by mail from Times on Demand . $ 5 . Order No . 8504 .
