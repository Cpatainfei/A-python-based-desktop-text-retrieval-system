   <HEADLINE> THE NAPLES SUMMIT ; REPORTER ' S NOTEBOOK ; BORIS AND BILL , DOG SLEDDERS IN IDITAROD ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When they weren ' t scripting the fate of the Earth on Sunday , the world ' s top leaders had a freewheeling discussion of the Louisiana Purchase and proposed that the World Cup winner fork over an extra billion dollars in international aid . President Clinton reminded French President Francois Mitterrand that it was Napoleon who sold Louisiana to America -- and that Thomas_Jefferson was criticized for spending twice the U.S. annual budget to buy_it . German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned Clinton that soon Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin would start demanding more money for czarist Russia ' s sale of Alaska to America . And Clinton confessed a secret ambition to race across Alaska in the Iditarod dog-sledding endurance test . &quot; See , Boris and I , we have enough body fat , we can survive even if we can ' t quite make_it , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; I ' ve always wanted to do that. &quot; &quot; I ' m happy to watch other people do that , &quot; British Prime_Minister John Major replied . * While the leaders were holed_up in the magnificent 17th-Century Palazzo Reale , munching on veal with beef_tenderloin , sipping champagne along with strawberry_ice_cream and deciding how to manage the planet ' s trouble spots , an anti-summit was taking_place just a_few blocks away . The Other Economic Summit -- better known as TOES -- aims to put the environment and the fate of the Earth ' s 1 billion poor on the agenda of the leaders of the Group of Seven richest industrial nations . &quot; The Naples summit has been an insult to the majority of the world ' s people , &quot; TOES said in a communique from its dusty storefront a_few blocks from the official G-7 press center . Instead , TOES brought_to Naples leaders from seven of the poorest and most disenfranchised groups in the world , including peasants from Mexico ' s Chiapas state , Colombia and Brazil , victims of the chemical disaster in Bhopal , India , and Native_American Apaches . &quot; Keep your wealth . Enjoy your consumer civilization , &quot; they wrote in a letter that Naples Mayor Antonio Bassolino promised to hand_over to the summit participants . &quot; Withdraw completely your interests , companies , investments , tourist resorts and good humanitarian intentions from our countries . &quot; Leave us to confront ourselves and live according to our own cultural values. &quot; The seven elite nations have improved their rhetoric since TOES began conducting parallel international summits alongside the G-7 in 1984 , TOES said , but they have not made_good on the Earth-friendly , anti-poverty promises included in their long and platitudinous communiques . &quot; The longer they get , the emptier they are , &quot; TOES activist Jakob von Uexkull said with a sigh . &quot; There are alternatives to increasing unemployment in the north , ' shock_therapy ' in Eastern Europe and poverty in the south , &quot; TOES holds . &quot; Fiscal reform and investment in renewable energies , energy conservation , recycling , waste reduction and public_transport . . . will create many_more jobs than ineffectual G-7 recipes. &quot; The G-7 is a closed elite whose past decisions have failed to improve the world ' s situation , Uexkull said , because its members are slaves to a &quot; market fundamentalism , &quot; the ideology that free markets and more growth will solve all_the Earth ' s problems . This absolute faith is &quot; as fundamentalist in its way as communist ideology , &quot; he said . &quot; Before , we had governments who were afraid of the trade_unions -- who , after all , represented millions of workers , &quot; Uexkull said . &quot; Now we have governments which are afraid of the bond traders and ( currency ) speculators. &quot; TOES also has a radical idea for solving the debt crisis of developing nations : Forgive all debts to nations whose loans were taken_out by dictators . And lift worldwide bank secrecy laws so creditors can go_after corrupt despots ' Swiss bank_accounts . * Predictably , the star attraction in Naples was not the G-7 but soccer ' s World Cup . The Italy-Spain quarterfinal match all but shut_down the summit Saturday afternoon , with Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi rushing_out of_his_own news_conference to watch the game . In a European press center , a pack of journalists sat glued to the World Cup game . On a TV monitor behind them , U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher spoke into empty air . Il Mattino newspaper gave Italy ' s victory better display than the summit in Sunday ' s editions . * With the business part of_his_own visit to Italy concluded , U.S. Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sent his staff home late Sunday night and took his wife , Beryl Ann , on a nostalgic visit to the town of Taranto in Italy ' s heel . It was from Taranto that Bentsen flew B-24 bombers on World_War_II raids over Romania and Yugoslavia , and he had not been back in half a century . Memories brought_back by the D-Day 50th anniversary ceremonies a month ago prompted the Treasury_secretary to arrange the trip to Taranto , three hours from Naples by car . Bentsen told the Italians he wanted to keep the visit low-key and nixed suggestions that he fly over the now-Italian air_base in a fighter jet -- for old times ' sake .</TEXT>
