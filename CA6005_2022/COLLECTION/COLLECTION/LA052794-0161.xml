   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CLINTON CAVES IN ON TRADE VS . HUMAN_RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s abandonment of the idea of linking trade with China to human_rights improvements represents a stunning reversal of the policies he espoused during both his 1992 presidential campaign and his first year in office . As recently as the last few weeks , in fact , Clinton_Administration officials were insisting that , without some further and meaningful steps_in human_rights by the Beijing regime , there was no way the President could renew China ' s most-favored-nation trade privileges . In the end , Clinton simply caved_in . And , in the process , the debacle gave China a chance to demonstrate the limits of U.S. power and the hollowness of U.S. fantasies of omnipotence . The United States found that it could not force China to change its human_rights policies , at least not without imposing costs that U.S. businesses were unwilling to bear . &quot; A great society , so large and with such built-in habits , does not change overnight , &quot; Clinton acknowledged Thursday , using words very similar to those used over the last year by the many critics of his policy . In the view of some China scholars and experts , Clinton ' s blending of threat and retreat left the United States in a worse position than if he had never threatened at all . For the message to the world , to China ' s Asian neighbors and to the Chinese people themselves , is that Beijing can defy the United States virtually at will . &quot; This is being handled in a way that is eroding our credibility with the Chinese , &quot; Kenneth Lieberthal , a University of Michigan China specialist , observed recently . &quot; The Chinese can see that , with this Administration , when it ' s time to decide whether to hold ' em or fold ' em , it will fold . This Administration will take a fig_leaf and give_away the store. &quot; The Administration is left hoping now that what it calls &quot; a new policy &quot; toward China will produce more results than the old one . That new policy is based on what Administration officials Thursday vaguely called a &quot; strategic relationship &quot; with China -- a phrase that sounds somewhat like the words former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger once employed . Over the last year , the Administration has made a series of concessions to China in hopes of winning its cooperation for some changes in its human_rights policies . Clinton met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Seattle . On the eve of that meeting , the Administration cleared the way for the sale of a Cray supercomputer to China . The Administration approved the sale of several U.S.-made satellites to China . And it ended a ban on high-level military contacts that had been imposed by the George_Bush Administration . &quot; They decided to give everything away , &quot; one U.S. official observed . &quot; Somehow , there is still this view that if we just give them enough , they will do what we want . It just doesn ' t work. &quot; Throughout the last year , while making these concessions , the Administration held_up on the one thing it believed , rightly , was the thing China wanted and needed most : most-favored-nation trade status , which allows tens of billions of dollars in Chinese exports to be sold in this country with low duties . But in the end , China called Clinton ' s bluff . It turned_out that Sen . Max Baucus ( D-Mont. ) was right when he called the threat to withdraw trade benefits &quot; the economic equivalent of a nuclear bomb &quot; -- that is , a weapon too powerful to use . What did the United States get_in exchange for its threat to withdraw most-favored-nation status ? What human_rights progress has there been ? Remarkably little . Over the last year , there have been no new Tian An Men Squares . China did not open_fire on civilians on the streets of Beijing . Chinese authorities have also taken the first_steps toward allowing the International Committee of the Red_Cross into China ' s prisons . And they released three prominent dissidents from prison . Yet no one could have envisioned a year ago just how many steps China would take_to show its disregard for the Clinton_Administration and its policies . In March , Chinese security officials rounded_up a series of prominent dissidents while Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher was in Beijing . In April , they locked_up Wei Jingsheng , China ' s most prominent advocate of democracy , who had been freed last September after more_than 14 years in jail . Wei is still in detention . China has refused to make even some of those human_rights concessions that the Clinton_Administration considered relatively easy to achieve . Early this year , U.S. officials believed that China was ready to stop its jamming of the Voice of America and other foreign broadcasts . That action might come at the time of Christopher ' s mission in March , they believed . But China has not even done that yet . What went_wrong ? Some officials , including veterans of the Bush_Administration , question the entire style and underpinnings of Clinton ' s approach . They argue that it was counterproductive to confront China head-on . &quot; Once you put your fist in the face of the Chinese and tell them they have to do something , they tend to go rigid , &quot; said Douglas Paal , who served as director of Asian affairs for the Bush_Administration . The Clinton_Administration misjudged a year ago how far China would be willing to go . Administration officials sincerely believed that the conditions they were imposing on China would be relatively easy to meet . But the Chinese regime -- facing both the threat of new social unrest inside China and a looming struggle to see who will succeed the ailing Deng Xiaoping as China ' s paramount leader -- was unwilling to do even the things the Administration considered modest . The Administration misread the strength of sentiment in the U.S. business_community , which did not like the idea of tying renewal of the trade benefits to human_rights in the first place and which grew increasingly threatened and nervous at the prospect of a cutoff in trade . Clinton himself bears the ultimate responsibility for being either unwilling or unable to impose discipline on top Administration officials . A year ago , at the time Clinton first announced his executive order on China ' s trade benefits , he told the nation : &quot; Starting today , the United States will speak with one voice on China policy. &quot; But the behavior of his Administration over the last year has made that claim seem ironic and empty . As Christopher was in Beijing pushing Chinese leaders for human_rights concessions , top policy-makers in economic agencies such_as the Commerce_Department were undercutting the State_Department by calling_for an extension of China ' s most-favored-nation status and a break_in the linkage between trade and human_rights . When Christopher returned from the trip , Clinton remained largely silent . He made no statement supporting Christopher ' s effort to enforce the policy of pressing hard for human_rights improvements -- the policy the President himself had adopted a year ago . But Clinton did not disavow the Christopher approach and support the economic team , either . &quot; How can you have constructive engagement and be giving everything away and also be threatening to take_away China ' s MFN benefits ? &quot; one U.S. official asked . &quot; Talk_about mixed signals. &quot; But not all_of the blame for the U.S. retreat should be placed on Clinton . It must also be shared with Congress , an institution that Clinton_Administration officials also misjudged . Over a period of three years , from 1990 to 1992 , Congress repeatedly passed laws tying renewal of China ' s trade benefits to improvements in human_rights . It was what is known as a &quot; free vote. &quot; Each time , President Bush vetoed the legislation , just as Congress knew he would . This year , for the first time , Congress has been forced to deal with the real-life consequences of its legislation . China failed to make significant human_rights improvements , and that meant that the cutoff in trade benefits that Congress originally threatened might actually be imposed . In droves , Congress members retreated . It turned_out that members of Congress were willing to vote for a linkage between human_rights and trade with China only at a time when they knew their legislation would be vetoed . Under the circumstances , it seems fair to conclude that many congressional Democrats were not serious about linking trade and human_rights but rather were using China as a partisan issue against Bush .</TEXT>
