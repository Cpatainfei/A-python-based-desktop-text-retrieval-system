   <HEADLINE> STOCKS MIXED AS LONG-TERM YIELD CLIMBS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Market Overview * Stocks ended mixed in quiet trading Tuesday as investors worried about rising interest_rates and tried to find their footing following last week ' s sharp drop_in share prices . * Long-term bond yields rose sharply , pushing prices lower as traders expressed anxiety about the outcome of several major auctions and the trend for inflation . * Gold staged a partial recovery . Stocks Stocks traded_in a narrow range , moving between positive and negative territories with little firm direction . However , smaller capitalization stocks moved sharply higher , led by technology issues . The Dow Jones average fell 0.29 to 3 # 906.03. But in the broader market , rising issues outnumbered declines by about 11 to 9 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Big Board volume totaled 318.18 million shares , down from Monday ' s 348.27 million . The winter storm in the Northeast slowed volume in the afternoon as some traders left early to escape the snow , said Eugene Peroni , director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott . Investors were still uncertain after Friday ' s 96-point drop_in blue_chip stocks followed by Monday ' s almost 35-point jump in the Dow average , said David Holt , director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan Securities . &quot; It ' s a day of gentle sparring between buyers and sellers , &quot; one analyst said . &quot; A lot of people are still trying to make_up their minds what to do. &quot; The rising bond rates were were seen as a negative for stocks because it raises the cost of borrowing for companies and makes share prices less attractive . Some of the stocks most sensitive to the economic cycles were again among the winners , with autos , papers , chemical and heavy machinery issues performing well . As the economy has shown signs of improving , those stocks have won favor . But technology shares stole the show . Most are traded on the Nasdaq index , which didn ' t recover from last week ' s drop as much as blue_chips on Monday . The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.50 to 782.70 , moving steadily higher all day . Among the market highlights : * Intel helped buoy the index , rising 1 1 / 2 to 63 1 / 2 . Semiconductor stocks generally were higher ahead of the industry ' s January so-called book-to-bill report . * Microsoft , however , didn ' t fare so well , falling 2 to 78 3 / 4 . A Soundview Financial Group analyst lowered his rating on the stock Monday . * Among cyclicals , GM rose 1 3 / 4 to 64 3 / 4 , and Alcoa advanced 1 1 / 4 to 79 3 / 8 . * But the gains in economically sensitive stocks were offset by losses in Sears , which was off 3 1 / 4 to 47 3 / 4 on disappointing fourth-quarter earnings . * Tobacco shares fell after the Canadian government hiked corporate taxes for tobacco manufacturers . Philip Morris dropped 1 1 / 8 to 58 3 / 4 , and RJR Nabisco ended off 1 / 8 to 7 1 / 4 although analysts said the tax change would have little impact on U.S.-based multinationals . AlliedSignal jumped 1 1 / 2 to 77 3 / 8 after reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings , declaring a two-for-one stock_split and raising its quarterly dividend . * Pfizer fell 2 1 / 4 to 59 3 / 8 after the company told analysts it was comfortable with the low side of their 1994 earnings forecasts but that sales growth in the first_quarter would not match full-year growth . Stocks abroad recovered from the previous day ' s sharp losses . Tokyo ' s Nikkei average ended 236.83 points higher at 20 # 251.23 , and Frankfurt ' s 30-share DAX average closed 27.81 points_up at 2 # 107.21. In London , the Financial Times 100-share average closed_up at 3 # 467.5 , up 48.4 point . Credit Treasury yields were higher most of the session , but surged late in the session . Analysts didn ' t cite any specific factors . The key 30-year bond yield soared to 6.45 % from 6.39 % the day before , pushing prices down 25 / 32 point , or $ 7.81 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value , at closing . Prices and yields move_in opposite directions . The Treasury ' s auction of $ 17.11 billion of three-year notes , the first batch of $ 40 billion in new securities this week that make_up the quarterly refunding of government debt , met analysts ' expectations . In addition to the three-year auction , the Treasury scheduled auctions of $ 12 billion in 10-year notes Wednesday and $ 11 billion in 30-year bonds Thursday . &quot; The market is still trying to price itself at a comfortable level ahead of the 10- and 30-year &quot; auctions , said Kathleen Stephansen , senior economist at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities Corp . A closely watched retail sales report , the Johnson-Redbook Service survey of early February sales , showed a 0.5 % gain from levels in January . But Samuel Kahan , economist at Fuji Securities Inc. , said that the figures were sluggish compared to last year ' s level and may have helped support bond prices . Analysts detected lingering uncertainty after the Federal_Reserve boosted the federal funds rate last week by 0.25 percentage_point to 3.25 % . The federal funds rate , the interest on overnight loans between banks , was 3.125 % , down from 3.313 % late Monday . Other Markets Gold prices rose as some investors shook_off fears that higher interest_rates would hurt demand . Gold prices rose in New York after dropping_in Europe . On the New York Comex , gold for current delivery closed at $ 382.30 an ounce , up $ 3.40 from Monday . Silver for current delivery closed at $ 5.261 , up 3.1 cents from Monday . On Monday , gold dropped $ 7.70 and silver plunged 18.7 cents in a delayed reaction to the Federal_Reserve ' s decision Friday to raise short-term interest_rates .

March crude_oil deliveries ended 4 cents lower at $ 15.21 a barrel on the New York Merc after erasing strong gains posted early in the session on talk_of cuts_in OPEC and Russian production .
