   <HEADLINE> CHIAPAS NEGOTIATIONS MIRED IN PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS ; MEXICO : THE TWO LEADING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE TAKEN A HARD LINE TOWARD THE ZAPATISTA REBELS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The resignation of Chiapas peace envoy Manuel Camacho Solis is a troubling sign that , in this presidential election year , politicking has taken precedence over finding a solution to the conflict in southern Mexico , analysts said Friday . Further , they expressed concern that the risk of a return to armed confrontation may have increased because of the hard line the two leading presidential candidates have taken toward the rebels , who rejected a government peace proposal last week . To minimize that risk , President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced that the federal_government will fulfill the social and economic commitments in the 32-point proposal and named a former Camacho Solis aide as liaison to coordinate that effort . &quot; The idea is to keep_up the political and social offensive in_order to make any return to fighting politically costly for them , &quot; a senior government official said . The move was meant to help calm fears that the cease-fire in_effect since mid-January might not withstand the political fireworks created by Camacho Solis ' resignation . Camacho Solis said late Thursday that he felt forced to quit as peace commissioner because of harsh criticism from ruling party presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo . That criticism did not end with Camacho Solis ' resignation : In an early morning radio interview Friday , Zedillo blasted him for having created false expectations of a peace settlement with the Zapatista National Liberation Army . &quot; I find it quite worrisome that the ex-commissioner would link his resignation to my statements , &quot; Zedillo said . &quot; I frankly have no idea what is his political motive for doing so. &quot; What many political analysts find especially worrisome is that the uprising , which began Jan . 1 and appeared to be headed toward a peaceful resolution , has become part of the election campaign and , more specifically , subject_to what increasingly looks_like a personal rivalry between Zedillo and Camacho Solis . &quot; This is extremely dangerous , &quot; said Carlos Ramirez , political columnist for the business newspaper El Financiero . &quot; This is a fragile peace. &quot; Camacho Solis ' resignation , combined with the withdrawal of mediator Bishop Samuel Ruiz , leaves a vacuum that concerns many Mexicans . &quot; We have lost the mediators who the Zapatistas trust , &quot; political analyst Denise Dresser said . &quot; This is really bad for everybody. &quot; The rebels have asked_for a new round of talks that would include members of national civic organizations with an agenda of national issues . They rejected the government peace proposal as too narrow because it promised mainly local solutions to economic , social and political problems that they said are present across the country . In his resignation speech Thursday , Camacho Solis appeared to assign his tasks to others who will continue the work of finding peaceful solutions to the problems that led to the uprising . But many of those responsible_for solving the conflicts are members of the same Chiapas state power_structure that has been unable to resolve the conflicts for generations . &quot; Camacho had to give the impression that he was leaving everything in_order , &quot; Ramirez said . &quot; But a state governor does not have the influence in the federal_government needed to respond to the Zapatista demands. &quot; Salinas named Hector Hernandez Llamas , a statistician who worked with Camacho Solis when he was mayor of Mexico_City , as liaison with the Chiapas government . Ramirez holds little hope that any agreement can be reached before the federal elections Aug . 21 . The rebels have indicated they will only believe their government , which has a long history of voter fraud , is committed to democratic change if those elections are clean . &quot; The Zapatistas are holding the elections hostage , &quot; Ramirez said . That almost assures that Chiapas will become more of a campaign issue as the election approaches . One leading candidate , Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party , spoke out strongly against negotiating with &quot; people in masks , &quot; as he called the ski-masked Zapatistas . Zedillo ' s feud with Camacho Solis has also pushed him toward the faction in his Institutional Revolutionary Party that favored a military solution to the uprising . &quot; He is acting like an autocrat , and he hasn ' t even been elected yet , &quot; analyst Dresser said .</TEXT>
