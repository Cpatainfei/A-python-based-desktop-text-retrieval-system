   <HEADLINE> ANTI-SMOKING GROUPS FIRED UP OVER CAMEL ADS ; TOBACCO : CAMPAIGN FEATURING FEMALE CHARACTERS CALLED RECKLESS FOR TARGETING WOMEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joe Camel , the dashing dromedary under_fire from anti-smoking groups for appealing_to youths , has some new lady_friends . And his critics aren ' t pleased . Ads featuring the cartoon camels began running this week in magazines including Redbook , Glamour , People , Us and Sports Illustrated . The full-color spreads show female camels holding lit Camels around the bar , pool_table and dance_floor at Joe ' s Place , a watering_hole for the fictional R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . character . Critics charge that the sole purpose of the new ad_campaign is to attract women smokers to Camel , a brand normally associated with male smokers . &quot; It ' s a reckless and dangerous campaign to lure more young female smokers into the fatal confines of Joe ' s Place , &quot; said Sidney Wolfe , director of health research for the advocacy group Public Citizen in Washington , D.C. &quot; We ' re very concerned that by making a female Joe Camel , it ' s going_to have an effect on girls smoking , &quot; said Michael Eriksen , director of the office on smoking and health at the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention in Atlanta . RJR spokeswoman Maura Ellis seemed surprised by the attention the new ads are getting . &quot; The ad was not targeted to female smokers ; it was intended for all smokers of competitive brands , &quot; she said from RJR ' s headquarters in Winston-Salem , N.C. &quot; It seems illogical to use a nightclub and not have a mix of male and female camels. &quot; Eriksen said he was intrigued by the timing of the new ad_campaign . &quot; It ' s surprising that they ' ve done this because the Federal Trade Commission is looking_at the Joe Camel advertisements now to see whether they should be regulated , &quot; he said . Studies have shown boys are about 50 % more likely than girls to smoke Camels . Before Joe Camel , in the mid-1970s and late 1980s , girls were smoking more_than boys , Eriksen said . Now its reversed , he said , because of Joe . Wolfe said the ads are an affront to efforts by anti-smoking groups to persuade the FTC to ban the Joe Camel character . The FTC staff recommended a ban last summer , but the commissioners have not yet issued a ruling . &quot; The sooner the camels are put to rest , the sooner more Americans , especially young_men and women , will live instead of die , &quot; Wolfe said . * Ellis said female camels have been featured at least once before with Joe Camel , who has been in_trouble with anti-smoking advocates almost since he was introduced as the &quot; smooth character &quot; in ads for Camel cigarettes in the late 1980s . Studies published by the Journal of the American Medical Assn . have found the camel ' s image was as familiar to 6-year-olds as Mickey_Mouse . Meanwhile , Joe Camel has become the brand of choice for about one-third of smokers under age 18 , the journal said . The tobacco_industry continues to insist that there is no proof the ads influence young people to smoke Camels . &quot; Every study will show the overwhelming influence on kids who start smoking is peer pressure and family influences , &quot; Ellis said . &quot; Children from homes where their parents are smokers tend to have a higher ( smoking ) rate . And since these ads have been in place , the number of kids who smoke has continued to decline. &quot; Ellis said the real intent of the ads was to lure Marlboro smokers over to Camel . Marlboro , made by RJR rival Philip Morris , owns a dominant 26.6 % share of the U.S. cigarette market . Meanwhile , Camels are the choice of about 4 % of the nation ' s smokers . &quot; We believe Joe Camel has been a disproportionate lightning_rod , &quot; Ellis said . &quot; After all , we ' re talking_about a brand with 4 % of the market . That means 96 % of smokers in the country smoke other brands . We think Camel has been unfairly singled out. &quot;</TEXT>
