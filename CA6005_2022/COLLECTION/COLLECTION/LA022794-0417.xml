   <TEXT> For less than $ 50 , travelers based in Dublin can have round-trip rail transportation to Killarney , two nights ' accommodations at the international youth_hostel , advice on what to see and where to eat with a budget in mind , and information on the local pubs that offer both traditional and contemporary music . This is just one of a number of economical , do-it-yourself packages being offered this year to visitors to Ireland by An Oige ( the_Irish Youth_Hostel Assn. ) . There are 50 An Oige hostels in the Republic_of_Ireland . The Youth_Hostel Assn . of Northern_Ireland ( YHANI ) has six facilities . Hostels range from primitive farmhouses to castles . Rates for 1994 range from about $ 3.50 to $ 8.50 per night for a bed in a dormitory_room . The exception is the Dublin International Youth_Hostel , where rates run $ 10- $ 13 for members of Hostelling International , slightly more for non-members . An advantage for independent travelers who buy the do-it-yourself packages is that lodging , transportation and ancillary costs are usually known in_advance , and yet travelers retain a lot of freedom . The disadvantage is that you commit yourself to using certain services before you know whether other facilities might better suit your tastes . Thus it makes_sense to research the areas you intend to visit before making decisions . A good source for budget travelers to Ireland would be the new 382-page &quot; Let ' s Go : Ireland &quot; ( Harvard Student Agencies ; $ 15.99 ) . The An Oige budget weekend to Killarney is priced at $ 42 . Similar weekends , which also include two nights ' accommodations and return rail from Dublin , are available for Limerick ( $ 42 ) , Cork ( $ 42 ) and Galway ( $ 48 ) , or from anywhere in Ireland to Dublin ( $ 49 ) . The hostels are open_to travelers of all ages . You can get more information or book these packages by contacting the An Oige Head Office , which is within the Dublin International Youth_Hostel at 61 Mountjoy St. , Dublin 7 , telephone from the U.S. 011-353-1-304555 or fax 011-353- 1-305808 .</TEXT>
