   <HEADLINE> ARK ENERGY GIVES INITIAL APPROVAL TO BUYOUT BY TENNECO SUBSIDIARY ; DEAL : HOUSTON-BASED FIRM PLANS TO KEEP THE LAGUNA HILLS COMPANY ' S 35 EMPLOYEES AND EXPAND ITS OPERATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ark Energy Inc. , a 5-year-old developer of cogeneration plants , said Thursday that it has tentatively agreed to be acquired by a subsidiary of giant Tenneco Inc. for stock worth $ 60 million . The Houston company ' s Tenneco Gas unit plans to keep Ark ' s 35 employees and expand Ark ' s operations . Cogeneration plants create both steam and electrical_energy . Plants use natural_gas to make steam that runs generators , which in turn create electricity . Ark sells the electricity to public_utilities and the excess steam to industrial companies . The acquisition will give Tenneco Gas , which transports and sells natural_gas , a 50 % interest in two Florida cogeneration projects with a total of 224 megawatts of generating capacity and an interest in eight other projects in various stages of development with a total of more_than 950 megawatts of capacity . Ark , named for Noah ' s Ark , is co-owned by Arnold R . Klann , its president , and Leslie C . Confair , its chief operating officer . Each holds the positions of co-chairman and co-chief executive . Tenneco also will form a joint_venture with an Ark affiliate , Arkenol Inc. , to develop environmentally safe methods for disposing_of organic waste . Arkenol , for instance , is processing the straw from rice harvests in the Sacramento area into ethanol for fuel and into sodium_silicate for use in a variety of products from rubber to soap . At other locations , Arkenol combines the steam byproduct of cogeneration with its proprietary technology to convert other cellulose refuse , such_as paper and grass clippings , into ethanol and other specialty chemicals . &quot; Arkenol is a green company that develops what I like to call biorefineries , &quot; said Klann , the affiliate ' s sole owner . &quot; We produce mainly ethanol. &quot; He said Confair will join the staff of 15 at Arkenol once the sale of Ark Energy is completed in about 45 days .</TEXT>
