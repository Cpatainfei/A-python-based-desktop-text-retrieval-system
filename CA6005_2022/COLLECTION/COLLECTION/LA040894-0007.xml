   <HEADLINE> HOME TECH / VIDEO : WILL ' MRS . DOUBTFIRE ' CASSETTES CLEAN UP ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Home video is stepping_on the toes of the theatrical market these days . The trend seems to be to bring hit movies to video while they ' re still playing in theaters . * It started with &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; whose theatrical life was revived by Oscar nominations . The action drama could have stayed longer in theaters but instead was whisked to video three weeks ago . Now FoxVideo ' s &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire , &quot; which is still playing in theaters around the country , is_due April 26 , at $ 20 . And the sleeper hit of the year , Warner ' s &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective , &quot; is coming_to video on June 14 , at $ 25 . With the kind of business it ' s doing , this movie , which has grossed $ 64 million so far , could still be attracting moviegoers this summer . What ' s happening is that studios are weighing the revenues of the last stages of a theatrical run against the profit windfall of a home-video release -- and home-video is winning . Bruce Pfander , FoxVideo ' s senior_vice_president of marketing , said the company will ship about 8 million copies of &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire , &quot; a gross of about $ 100-million . &quot; that ' s better than it would do_in theaters , &quot; he said . Part of planning a video release is finding a time when the competition isn ' t fierce . &quot; ' Mrs . Doubtfire ' will own the market in May , &quot; Pfander added . &quot; There are no other major sell-through ( sales-oriented ) releases in May . It should also do_well in the Mother ' s Day gift market . &quot; Also , we ' ll get the retail floor space we need to market this properly and we won ' t have to fight for that space , which is very important . If we wait until fall , we have ' Jurassic Park ' and ' Snow White ' to worry about. &quot; ' Ben-Hur ' Easter is over but that doesn ' t mean you can ' t enjoy &quot; Ben-Hur , &quot; the granddaddy of biblical epics and winner of a record 11 Oscars , including best picture and best actor ( Charlton Heston in the title_role ) . Though dated , it ' s still entertaining , and the famed chariot_race remains one of the most thrilling sequences in film history . MGM / UA recently released a fancy 35th anniversary package , at $ 40 , featuring a &quot; Making of &quot; documentary . But unless you have at least at 27-inch screen , don ' t bother with the letterboxed version of this super wide-screen movie . On a small TV , you ' ll have to squint to see the picture . The edges of the picture are chopped_off on the regular , cropped version , but it ' s the best bet for those with small screens . Special_Interest Videos : The buzz among fitness-video buffs ( there are fanatics who buy every new one that comes_out ) is that Jackie Joyner Kersee ' s &quot; Beyond the Bounds &quot; is one of the best . Her 50-minute aerobic workout tape , priced at $ 20 , is_due April 26 . . . . Want to teach your child how to swim ? You might try Jim Booth ' s &quot; Bubbly Baby Swim Video &quot; ( New Market Sales , $ 15 ) , due Wednesday . . . . Fans of NBA ' s outspoken star Charles Barkley will like &quot; Sir Charles &quot; ( CBS-Fox , $ 20 ) , an informative , 50-minute documentary that ' s part biography and includes some interesting footage and interviews . What ' s New on Video : &quot; The Age of Innocence &quot; ( Columbia TriStar ) . Director Martin Scorsese ' s adaptation of Edith Wharton ' s novel about passions steaming under the prim exterior of upper-class New York in the 1870s . A lawyer ( Daniel Day-Lewis ) is hopelessly smitten by the cousin ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) of his fiancee ( Winona Rider ) . Marvelously subtle and elegantly understated , for those who like slow-moving dramas . &quot; A Bronx Tale &quot; ( HBO ) . Robert De Niro , who also has a supporting role , is impressive in his directorial debut . Set_in the 1960s , it ' s about a New York youngster , portrayed at ages 9 and 17 , who is torn between his law-abiding father ( De Niro ) and a charming gangster ( Chazz Palminteri ) -- a tug-of-war that grows more intense as he gets older . An absorbing drama with an intriguing subplot about the tensions between blacks and Italians in New York . Lillo Brancato is excellent as the hero in his teens . &quot; Fearless &quot; ( Warner ) . Surviving a plane crash lifts an architect ( Jeff Bridges ) into a strange psychological zone . He drifts away from his wife ( Isabella Rossellini ) and forms a strong tie with a fellow survivor ( Rosie Perez ) . Directed by Peter Weir , it ' s a fascinating , eerie downer of a movie that grapples with cerebral issues , boasting exceptional performances by Bridges and Perez , who got an Academy Award nomination for her work . &quot; The Beverly Hillbillies &quot; ( FoxVideo ) . Director Penelope Spheeris ' lame film version of the old TV series , about the backwoods Clampett family striking it rich and moving to Beverly Hills . The bland , lowbrow remake doesn ' t recapture the high-spirited fun of the original . If you like the old series , you ' ll gag at Jim Varney as Jed -- the role Buddy Ebsen made famous . Lily Tomlin and Cloris Leachman costar . &quot; A Home of Their Own &quot; ( PolyGram ) . Kathy Bates stars as a gutsy , jobless single mother of six who leaves Los Angeles with her family and settles in Idaho . For those with a taste for sentimental , somewhat corny , inspirational movies , this is quite good , featuring exemplary work by Bates and Edward Furlong as her eldest son . Upcoming : &quot; Malice , &quot; &quot; Carlito ' s Way &quot; and &quot; Cool Runnings &quot; ( Wednesday ) ; &quot; Mr. Jones , &quot; &quot; Flesh and Bone , &quot; &quot; Ruby in Paradise , &quot; &quot; The Saint of Fort Washington &quot; and &quot; Another Stakeout &quot; ( April 20 ) ; &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; and &quot; Batman : Mask of the Phantasm &quot; ( April 26 ) ; &quot; Ernest Rides Again &quot; ( April 27 ) ; &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; and &quot; A Perfect World &quot; ( May 4 ) ; &quot; Addams Family Values , &quot; &quot; The Three Musketeers , &quot; &quot; Orlando &quot; and &quot; Into the West &quot; ( May 11 ) ; &quot; The Piano &quot; and &quot; Rudy &quot; ( May 25 ) ; &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 &quot; ( June 8 ) .</TEXT>
