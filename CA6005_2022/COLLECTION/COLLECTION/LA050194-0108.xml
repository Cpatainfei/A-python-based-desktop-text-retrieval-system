   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; CREATING A NEW ARCHITECTURAL VOCABULARY FOR A DEMOCRATIC BERLIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Modern German cities , lamented the author of &quot; Mein Kampf , &quot; lack monumental architecture and potent symbols of national identity . Adolf Hitler sought to remedy this by transforming Berlin into &quot; Ger mania , &quot; a capital worthy of his Thousand Year Reich . Ever since he embraced Albert Speer ' s overblown classicism , massive Doric columns have evoked fears of blood-spattered tyrants . As a result , both Germanies spent four decades studiously downplaying architectural grandeur . In Bonn , Chancellor Helmut Kohl occupies squat offices humbly dubbed the Chancellor ' s Bungalow . The Parliament building in the provisional Rhineland capital was designed with equal restraint . The work of German architect Guenter Behnisch , this low-rise modernist pavilion contains much transparent glass to express government openness and accessibility . A circular plenary chamber was devised to avoid any trace of hierarchy . But the vote to move the Bundestag and 10 of the Federal Republic ' s 18 ministries to Berlin by the year 2000 has rendered the building obsolete . The decision also sent Germans back to the drawing board in a public_debate about &quot; democratic architecture &quot; and what is appropriate for a unified country of 80 million still hesitant about displaying its might on the world stage . Redesign of Germany ' s once-and-future capital is an undertaking on the order of Pierre-Charles L ' Enfant ' s conception for Washington , or Baron Georges-Eugene Haussmann ' s transformation of Paris . Other new capitals have been erected in this century -- Brasilia , New Delhi , Ankara and Canberra are some examples -- but never has an endeavor of this kind been carried_out with such anxiety about architectural symbolism . Because the official architecture of unified Berlin will represent the German state , authorities are grappling to find a design vocabulary that turns its back on the monumentality typical of their country ' s most worrisome periods . The perversion of the classical ideal by both Hitler and Josef Stalin calls into question facile connections between architectural_style and political beliefs . Still , architecture offers important clues about how state power is exercised . Government buildings amount to billboard images of national self-understanding . Since before the Acropolis in Athens , architecture has given voice to a society ' s deepest values , methods of governance and the manner in which its members relate to one another . Berlin will not be rebuilt from scratch but gaps in its war-torn terrain contain plenty of minefields for a country acutely aware of the ideological implications of architecture and urban_planning . The triumph of capitalism will take_form when the no-man ' s land formerly occupied by the Berlin Wall is replaced by a vast Potsdamer Platz -- with office towers for Daimler-Benz and Sony . Along Unter den Linden Boulevard in the city_center , there have been serious calls -- and strong objections -- to resurrect the palace of the Hohenzollern emperors , which was razed by the communists . A plan to demolish the defunct German Democratic Republic ' s ugly glass-box Parliament has outraged many East_Germans -- some nostalgic for old times and others concerned that , once again , the past is being erased . Politicians vow there will be no revival of the grandiose spirit of old_Prussian ministries , Bismarckian pomposity or Speer ' s megalomania . But at_the_same_time , there is a desire for structures deemed worthy of a cosmopolitan capital . While the splendid centers of most European capitals were ordered up by powerful leaders , Germany today is reinventing Berlin by holding scores of architectural competitions , open_to architects from around the world . Practically every architect of international stature has vied for the bonanza of public and private projects -- including Renzo Piano , Peter Eisenman , Philip Johnson , Rafael Moneo , Helmut Jahn and Richard Rogers . German architects are also playing a role , but enlisting stars from abroad is one way of demonstrating openness to outside ideas . In the architectural equivalent of a G-7 summit , the government invited proposals from the United States , Europe and Japan to turn Germany ' s most famous building , the century-old Reichstag -- torched in a 1933 fire that Hitler used as a pretext to impose emergency rule -- into the new seat of the Bundestag . Sir Norman Foster of Britain won with a plan to retrofit the scarred hulk with a forward-looking legislative chamber in his high-tech machine aesthetic . &quot; There is all_the inherent symbolism of what that building stands_for and the need to make manifest from the outside that something new and different has happened inside , &quot; Foster says of the neo-Renaissance building . Glass elevators , glass roofing and translucent floors will flood the setting of Germany ' s darkest hours with light . Construction is to begin next year -- after the artist Christo wraps the Reichstag in 1 million square_feet of silver fabric to herald the capital ' s epochal transformation . Shunted off to the side of the capital under both kaiser and Fuehrer , the Reichstag has been accorded pride of place in the master_plan for the future nexus of German power -- a 150-acre site known as the Spreebogen . In addition to Foster ' s refurbished Parliament and nearby offices for the 650 deputies , this area will house the new headquarters of the first chancellor since Hitler to govern from Berlin . More_than 830 entries from 48 countries were submitted in the Spreebogen competition , judged by German politicians and foreign architects including Richard Meier and Karen Van Lengen -- both responsible_for major construction projects in Germany . The past weighed heavily on the selection process , particularly since the Spreebogen was where Speer envisioned a vast north-south axis with a soaring Volkshalle to accommodate 180 # 000 people . In another effort to banish the past , only schemes with an east-west axis were seriously considered . Most politicians gravitated toward a low-key , decentralized design recalling Bonn ' s muted arrangement because they were &quot; nervous about taking a stand &quot; on a clear embodiment of state power , lest the wrong signals be sent , according to Van Lengen . &quot; They wanted to say , ' We ' re just this little country in Europe , ' &quot; she says . &quot; They ' re very sensitive about it because they know the world is watching them. &quot; The foreign architects preferred a more cohesive solution and swayed deliberations by the jury , whose official members included Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth , Kohl ' s chief_of_staff Friedrich Bohl and Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen . After two weeks of intense debate , the jury settled_on a design by Berliner Axel Schultes , pronouncing it &quot; a bold representation of the democratic state. &quot; Schultes knits together the long-divided city with a mall-like scheme , punctuated by open courts and gardens . His master_plan involves no designs of individual buildings , leaving these to be determined by subsequent competitions . Berlin will not be rebuilt in a day . With the transfer from Bonn estimated to cost $ 11 billion , construction of the new government seat could drag_on for decades . Official German architecture will surely mutate in that time , to reflect fluctuations in the national self-image . The history of modernism -- Berlin was one of its flash_points before the Nazis sent the Bauhaus design school into exile -- has shown the delusion of putting too_much stock in design as an influence of political behavior . Nonetheless , state buildings are key symbols of the national consciousness . How Germany meets the challenge of architectural representation merits attention from all democratic societies that aspire to give concrete form to their highest ideals. *</TEXT>
