   <HEADLINE> CLOSED-DOOR POLICY FAILS TO STEM TIDE OF CUBANS ; IMMIGRATION : COAST GUARD IS STILL PICKING_UP RAFTS IN FLORIDA STRAITS . CASH REMITTANCES TO HAVANA ARE BANNED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A day after a stunning change in U.S. immigration policy intended to shut_down the mounting exodus of Cubans heading for Florida on homemade boats , the flood of refugees continued unabated Saturday . Even as President Clinton was announcing a package of measures aimed at ratcheting up the pressure on Cuban President Fidel Castro -- including banning all cash remittances to Cuba and placing new restrictions on flights -- the U.S. Coast Guard was rescuing more_than 860 Cubans in the Florida Straits . The refugees were being ferried to a tent city detention camp at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo , Cuba , already home to more_than 14 # 000 Haitian refugees . The new arrivals , along with 365 other Cubans being held at a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center west of Miami , are the first to be affected by the policy reversal that has left Cubans subject_to the same immigration rules that Haitians and other asylum-seekers face . Outside the Krome Detention Center_on the edge of the Everglades , about 300 anxious Cuban Americans from South Florida gathered_in the blazing sun , hoping to find the names of family members on a list of those being held inside . &quot; My 17-year-old brother left on a raft Wednesday with a cousin , his wife and two babies , &quot; said Julio Canto , 23 , who himself rafted to South Florida three years ago . &quot; We have no idea where he is now. &quot; Although those on the list face detention rather than the immediate prospect of a new life in the United States , they did succeed in escaping death on the high_seas . Some fleeing refugees in recent days did not . Atty . Gen . Janet Reno announced Thursday that Cuban migrants no longer would be welcomed routinely to the United States but would have to apply for asylum like other would-be immigrants . The move was the Clinton_Administration ' s response to a steadily growing crisis in which more_than 8 # 700 Cubans have fled to Florida this year . That represents the largest_number of Cuban refugees to attempt to sail here since the Mariel boat lift of 1980 , when more_than 125 # 000 Cubans arrived in South Florida . Reports from inside Cuba suggest that even those who may have heard of the U.S. detention policy -- and the news has been broadcast to Cuba by U.S. government-run Radio Marti and commercial Miami stations -- many on the economically strapped island prefer to take their chances at_sea . Some apparently would even prefer detention at the Spartan Guantanamo encampment to staying in their homeland . Rafters , unimpeded by Cuban guards , reportedly were leaving beaches near Cojimar early Saturday . &quot; I don ' t know if the word ' s reached them or not , but the boats are still coming , &quot; said Coast Guard Petty_Officer Amy Gaskill in Miami . &quot; We ' re still picking_up rafts. &quot; At the White_House , Clinton formally ordered a ban on cash remittances to Cuba , effectively prohibiting Cuban Americans from sending money to relatives and friends on the island . U.S. officials estimated that these remittances -- which were permitted in amounts up_to $ 300 every three months -- have totaled $ 500 million a year and have been an important source of hard currency for the Communist nation . The White_House also imposed new restrictions on charter flights to Cuba , effectively banning those that are expressly for family visits or tourism . Only humanitarian flights will be allowed . In addition , the United States will try to &quot; increase and amplify &quot; its broadcasts to Cuba over Radio Marti and will take_to the United Nations what U.S. officials claim is evidence of new human_rights abuses by the Cuban government . Clinton ' s announcement of tighter sanctions against Cuba , which already faces a U.S.-led economic blockade , follows meetings Saturday with Florida Gov . Lawton Chiles and a group of Cuban American leaders . All had urged the President to balance his immigration order with tougher measures against Castro . &quot; We are extremely satisfied , &quot; said Jorge Mas Canosa , chairman of the Cuban American National Foundation . &quot; I think the President has done the right thing. &quot; Clinton ' s new series of measures adds_up to a careful balancing act in his handling of Cuban American groups . The curbs on refugees announced by the White_House on Friday ran counter to the longstanding efforts of Cuban exile organizations , which have encouraged the broadest possible immigration from Cuba into the United States . But the package of other measures adopted Saturday is in_line with other efforts by Cuban American groups , which have sought to tighten the trade_embargo against Castro . In an interview on Cable News Network , the Cuban Foreign Ministry denounced the Administration ' s actions . &quot; The U.S._government in no way tackles the essence of the problem , which is the fact that there is a policy ( the U.S. embargo of Cuba ) deliberately aimed at making life unbearable in Cuba , &quot; said Carlos Fernandez , director of the ministry ' s North_American section . &quot; The natural and logical outcome is to have people wanting to leave the country. &quot; Polls conducted by Miami television_stations hours after details of the policy_change were spelled_out by Clinton indicate that a majority of South Floridians , including Cuban Americans , support the decision to detain Cuban refugees rather than allow them free entry . Many here believe that Castro was using the flotilla to relieve internal pressures caused by severe economic privation and growing social unrest that led to an Aug . 5 riot on the Havana waterfront . But there were signs of disaffection too . In heavily Cuban Hialeah and in Key West , Cuban Americans took_to the streets to protest the policy_change . &quot; Miami Si , Guantanamo No &quot; read some signs . For those left waiting in Miami for missing relatives to show_up , both anger and anguish were close to the surface . &quot; It ' s easy to say , ' I agree with the policy ' when you don ' t have loved ones risking their lives for freedom , &quot; said Julio Canto ' s wife , Aida , near tears as she waited to see the list of those held at Krome . Those who did not find their relatives at Krome could only hope that they would show_up at Guantanamo . But there was no word Saturday on the identity of the 499 Cubans en route to the camp on Cuba ' s southeastern coast , and that too provoked frustration among those who waited . &quot; We need to know if our family members are dead or alive , &quot; said Marlene Rodriguez , 28 , a Miami schoolteacher who waited outside the Krome gate with her husband , Javier , for word of two cousins who left Mariel on Thursday . &quot; My aunt in Artemisa ( Cuba ) is having a nervous_breakdown . These are her two children out there. &quot; Inside the Krome Detention Center , emptied_of 172 illegal immigrants of other nationalities to make room for as_many as 1 # 000 Cubans , the 223 men among the first 336 to arrive were segregated from the 76 women and 37 children . Men were housed in a large circus-type tent , while the women and children slept indoors . All wore bright orange camp uniforms . INS spokesman Lamar Wooley said the Cubans were being screened for health_problems . He had no comment on what would happen to any refugee found ineligible to stay in the United States . &quot; That is something to be settled at a higher level. &quot;</TEXT>
