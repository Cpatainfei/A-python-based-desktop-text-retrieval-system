   <TEXT> Mrs . Rose Del Signore comes_to stay during the last few weeks of her daughter ' s pregnancy . Anxious to have everything ready before the child arrives , they go_to a local baby furniture store for a crib and chest of drawers.After Del Signore pays_for the merchandise , she tries to arrange for immediate delivery . But the store owners refuse to deliver it until after the child is born . What went_wrong ? The owners are Orthodox Jews who believe that the birth of a child can be fraught with problems and danger . Since they believe that one should not tempt fate , they wait until after a child is born before bringing any baby supplies into the home . This also explains why Orthodox Jews do not give baby showers before a birth . From the store owners ' point_of_view , they were performing an act of kindness by refusing to deliver the furniture before the child was born . They were trying to prevent anything negative from happening to Del Signore ' s grandchild . Del Signore accepted their custom , and notified the store as soon as the baby was born . As promised , they delivered the furniture before the new mother returned from the hospital with her healthy daughter . Rule : Some peoples believe that pregnancy is a time of potential peril for the unborn . Consequently , this rite of passage is surrounded by many beliefs and customs designed to protect the baby . Norine Dresser is a folklorist and author of &quot; I Felt Like I Was From Another Planet , &quot; ( Addison Wesley ) . Tell her your experiences c / o Voices .</TEXT>
