   <HEADLINE> U.S. REIMPOSES LAW TO ALLOW TRADE SANCTIONS ON JAPAN ; MARKETS : SUPER 301 MEASURE PERMITS PUNITIVE TARIFFS AGAINST NATIONS FOUND TO DEAL UNFAIRLY . SUCH ACTION COULD DEVASTATE O.C. , WITH JAPAN ITS BIGGEST TRADE PARTNER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Triggering a storm of protests from Japanese leaders , President Clinton on Thursday reinstituted a provision of U.S. trade law that will allow the United States to retaliate against Japanese imports if Japan fails to open its markets to American goods . The measure will allow the Administration to impose trade sanctions , such_as punitive tariffs , against any country found to engage in unfair trade practices that keep U.S. products out of its markets . Delays built into the process , as well as the Administration ' s plan to gradually turn_up the pressure on Japan , make_it unlikely that the measure , known as Super 301 , would have a tangible impact on the cost of Japanese products in this country unless the trade dispute continues to fester until the end of the year . That is good news in Orange County , where business_leaders stress that Japan is the county ' s single largest trade partner and warn that a wide-scale trade war could be devastating to the fragile local economy , which is only just beginning to recover . &quot; I am not sure this will go that far , &quot; said Donald Miller , president of the World Trade Center Assn . of Orange County . &quot; Anything ( Administration officials ) do , I hope , will be minor. &quot; Like other business_leaders monitoring the growing trade dispute , Miller said Clinton was right to point_out disparities in trade with Japan and to try to work toward solving longstanding issues . &quot; I would agree they need to open_up their market to certain products to create a more level playing_field , &quot; Miller said . He quickly added , however , &quot; I don ' t think this is the best way to do it. &quot; Tom Wilck , past president of the Orange County Chamber_of_Commerce , agreed that Clinton inevitably had to &quot; raise the ante &quot; by reinstituting Super 301 . &quot; The chamber is certainly in favor of supporting free_trade , &quot; Wilck said . But he echoed Miller in saying he hopes that , for the sake of Orange County ' s economic future , Super 301 is never used . Nevertheless , there is significant symbolic impact in the decision , which U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced after Clinton spoke earlier in the day by telephone with Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa . The Administration ' s action followed the breakdown of trade talks between President Clinton and Hosokawa last month . It brought a warning of trouble to come from Tokyo . Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura , the top government spokesman , said today that this kind of &quot; unilateral &quot; measure is &quot; explicitly prohibited &quot; by the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Japan , he said , &quot; strongly hopes that the government of the United States will act in a sensible manner , &quot; but also &quot; recognizes the need for a restrained response. &quot; Takemura noted that the government has recently &quot; reaffirmed its intention to advance voluntary measures toward further market opening. &quot; Super 301 expired in 1990 , two years after Congress enacted it as part of comprehensive trade legislation . But the Administration has said that it has the authority to reinstate it by presidential order . During its earlier use , it provoked deep opposition among the Japanese . Although sanctions were never applied , U.S. officials said that , with varying degrees of success , it pushed Japan into increasing purchases of U.S. satellites , some wood products and supercomputers . The toughened trade regulation , which is to remain in_effect through 1995 , is one in a series of steps contemplated by the White_House to pressure the government in Tokyo to open its markets to U.S. products . In 1993 , Japan ran_up a $ 59.3-billion trade surplus with the United States , and a $ 131-billion global trade surplus . Simultaneously with the new trade action , the Clinton_Administration moved to use antitrust measures to combat Japanese practices judged to inhibit sales of American goods in Japan . In a speech to the Japan Society in New York , Anne Bingaman , assistant attorney_general for antitrust , said the Administration would take legal_action against monopolistic practices in Japan and by Japanese companies operating in the United States . Bingaman noted that Japan has promised for years to stop organizing industry cartels that exclude foreign competitors . &quot; But , after all is said and done , &quot; she said , &quot; the question still remains whether there has really been any meaningful change in Japan. &quot; As for the decision to reinstate Super 301 , it represented a clear signal to Japan , in the wake of the breakdown in trade talks , that the Administration will make_it more and more costly for the Hosokawa government to back_away from an agreement its predecessor made with Clinton last summer . At the time , Japan agreed to negotiate a system by which progress could be measured in opening the Japanese market to the United States in four areas : automobiles and auto parts , telecommunications , medical equipment and insurance . The negotiations fell_apart Feb . 11 , hours before Clinton and Hosokawa met at the White_House , and the prime_minister is said by aides to be preparing an import-promoting trade proposal to be announced at the end of March . The Clinton_Administration ' s procedure , spelled_out in an executive order that the President signed Thursday , would work this way : * Each year the trade representative would send to Congress a National Trade Estimate Report , which would list trade_barriers -- quotas , tariffs and other procedures that countries follow to keep_out foreign products . * By Sept . 30 , the Administration would identify the nations on the list with the most egregious barriers , setting_in_motion a short investigation after which tariffs , or taxes on imports , could be levied . The tariffs could be as high as 100 % of the value of a specific import . Without a list of specific countries or industries , it is impossible to determine where the tariffs would be applied . But a senior Administration official pointed_out that &quot; autos and auto parts are front and center &quot; in the agreement that brought_about the disrupted negotiations . Apart from that statement , Administration officials have yet to single_out specific industries , prompting executives at several Japanese-owned companies with U.S. headquarters in Orange County to say they are uncertain what effect Thursday ' s decision will have_on their operations . Under Super 301 terms , U.S. trade negotiators could pick and choose which Japanese products would face steep tariffs or be banned from entering the United States . If , for instance , the Clinton_Administration decides not to focus_on electronics parts , companies such_as Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc. , based in Cypress , and Toshiba America Inc. , in Irvine , would not be affected . &quot; It ' s hard to say how the Administration will use the powers , &quot; said Tom Chapman , a Mitsubishi spokesman . &quot; Hopefully , they won ' t have to use it at all. &quot; But Kantor explained that the procedure &quot; is a flexible instrument &quot; that permits him &quot; to send our trading partners an early warning that certain of their practices may be identified in the future if they are not eliminated. &quot; In a written statement , Clinton said his order will help to &quot; open markets that will create better jobs and increase wages at_home and abroad. &quot; That goal in mind , some Japanese companies with production facilities in Southern California have been hedging their bets . At Toshiba America , for instance , the company is moving closer to complete independence from the parent firm in Japan , said Toshiba spokesman Bob Wittenberg . Toshiba makes its computerized notebooks in Irvine using many locally produced parts , and manufactures television_sets in Tennessee using picture_tubes made in New York . Such practices protect multinational companies in the event of a trade war , he said . &quot; It ' s important for us to have a high level of local procurement , &quot; Wittenberg said . Meanwhile , in Japan , emotions were high . Hosokawa told Parliament that he hopes the United States will &quot; take sensible action based on a sensible judgment. &quot; Bringing Out the Big Stick The Administration , frustrated by Japan ' s failure to buy U.S. goods , wants to force Japan to open its markets by reinstating a provision of trade law known as Super 301 . What Is Super 301 ? Under the provision , the U.S. trade representative prepares a list of countries that have erected the most egregious trade_barriers against American products . After further investigations , the Administration has the power to impose retaliatory tariffs of up_to 100 % . Consumer Impact It is unlikely the measure would have a tangible impact on the cost of Japanese products in this country unless the dispute festers until the end of the year . But U.S. companies , primarily autos and auto parts , stand to achieve major gains if markets open .
