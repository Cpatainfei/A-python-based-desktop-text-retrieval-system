   <HEADLINE> LAW_ENFORCEMENT ; LATEST ANTI-CRIME GADGETS NOW GO TO LOCAL OFFICERS ; PENTAGON , FBI AND OTHER AGENCIES SHARE TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY . RISK OF INJURY IS REDUCED TOO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A suspect breaks_into a run , hoping to escape and avoid a hail of police bullets . But an officer armed with a flame-thrower-like gun squirts him with a thick stream of sticky foam . The goo expands and clings_to the man like tar , entangling his legs and arms . Running becomes difficult , then impossible . Unable to flee or fight , he can only await his capture -- and the baby_oil needed to remove the foam . The latest in cyberfiction ? Not at all . The weapon , secretly developed for the Defense_Department , is among a host of technological advances that the Pentagon has agreed to share with law_enforcement agencies across the country now that the Cold_War is over . It ' s all part of the federal_government ' s new push to fight crime , and it involves the Treasury and Justice_departments as well -- with such agencies as the FBI , the Drug Enforcement Administration , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms and the Secret_Service agreeing to share access to breakthroughs that can save police_departments time and money -- and reduce the risk of injury to officers , bystanders and suspects . Top officials from Justice , Defense and Treasury joined Vice_President Al Gore recently to announce the cooperative effort , which stems in part from Gore ' s &quot; reinventing government &quot; program . &quot; Together these agreements will help make the advanced technologies of the future available on the streets of America for the law_enforcement officers and the police_officers throughout this country who are in the front_line in the fight against crime , &quot; Atty . Gen . Janet Reno said . As an example of how the equipment can help law_enforcement , Gore was given a firsthand demonstration of a gadget used in many police_departments . The vice_president briefly placed his hand on a pane_of_glass , leaving his fingerprints behind . Then a small device known as a &quot; Magic Wand &quot; was passed_over the prints , dying them and binding them with super glue . It provided a more accurate image than traditional dusting , and in a fraction of the time . Gore also hopped into the driver ' s side of a &quot; smart police_car &quot; on a test run with a Maryland police_department . A mobile data system in the car electronically links officers to their stations through a small terminal . Officers can file reports , look through files and call_up maps without having to return to the station . Other advances displayed included an automated booking system , used exclusively by the DEA since 1990 , that records fingerprints , mug_shots and evidentiary photos by computer in one-sixth the usual time . The ATF demonstrated a system operating in the Washington metropolitan police_department called Operation Cease-Fire , which uses lasers and computers to &quot; read &quot; bullets recovered from crime scenes by recording the markings guns leave on every bullet they fire . By comparing the readings from various crime scenes , a process that takes four seconds , police can determine if the same gun was used . Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the system , in place since last year , has already connected 10 shootings in the D.C. area and led to three arrests . Another device is a miniature shoulder-mounted video camera that transmits images back to headquarters instantly . With the camera , police_officers in the field could send pictures of suspects back to the station , where computers could determine quickly if the person is_on file or sought by authorities . Military medical teams also can use the cameras to get advice from doctors about how to treat victims . Other technology that will be shared includes : * Body_armor that is lighter and more effective against bullets and knives . * Night-vision devices that would help law_enforcement authorities capture suspects in the dark . * Substances placed in gasoline or oil to destroy their ability to power or lubricate vehicles , and viruses that can cripple computer_systems . * Devices that temporarily stun suspects , such_as the noise simulators that aided in the U.S. military ' s capture of former Panamanian strongman Manuel A . Noriega in January , 1990 . Technologies federal agencies are trying to develop , or increase the use of , include : * Virtual reality simulators that can create a fictional hostile environment to aid in training officers . * Drugs that inhibit or calm the nervous_system to more easily control dangerous or suicidal people . * Electronic monitoring devices that can be inserted in fleeing cars so police can track them without chases .</TEXT>
