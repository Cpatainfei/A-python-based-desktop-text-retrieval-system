   <HEADLINE> THE ENDLESS SUMMER ENDS ; LONGTIME SURFERS FIND THERE ' S A MEDICAL PRICE TO PAY FOR THE SPORT ' S LIFESTYLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Johnny Fain was Malibu ' s golden_boy of surfing in the late 1960s . Known for an aggressive surfing style of quick , slashing turns and &quot; hang-ten &quot; riding ( 10 toes over the nose of the board ) , Fain became one of the world ' s top surfers , and was rewarded with endorsements and years of travel on the pro-surf tour . The only child of &quot; Lassie &quot; screenwriter Jeanne Bartlett , Fain grew_up in Malibu Colony and parlayed his blond good looks and surfing prowess into small movie and stunt parts in such surf cult classics as &quot; Muscle Beach Party , &quot; &quot; How to Stuff a Wild Bikini &quot; and &quot; Beach Blanket Bingo. &quot; But during years of a rough-and-tumble surfer lifestyle and prolonged exposure to the natural elements , Fain also racked_up a litany of surfing-related ailments . More_than a dozen cancerous and precancerous skin lesions and moles have been removed from his face and body . He has endured three ear operations and four surgeries to remove growths from his eyes , and hundreds of stitches from surfboard collisions . And now a recent operation to repair a hip eroded from years of battering has left Fain on crutches . The great surfer reluctantly admits he has been temporarily beached . &quot; You have to believe you ' re invincible to reach a high level of surf expertise , &quot; said Fain , 50 . &quot; You have to go beyond what a normal person thinks_of as a human limit . I am paying a price for that attitude. &quot; So , too , are many other surfers , enthusiasts and their doctors say . The sport of surfing , with an estimated half-million Southern California devotees , has always radiated images of fun and good_health , of bronzed bodies , youthful good looks and pristine beaches . But as the baby-boomer innovators of the sport grow older , some of them say a troublesome array of maladies has emerged . &quot; As opposed to the blunt trauma of a football injury , many surfers suffer from a series of cumulative ailments , &quot; said Steve Hoch , editor of Surfer magazine , one of the sport ' s leading journals . Hoch , 38 , who has been surfing for more_than 20 years , has suffered from chronic back , ear and nasal problems . &quot; It ' s almost death from a_thousand cuts . Though our engines are still humming , our shells are a little nicked. &quot; County officials say it is difficult to determine the extent of surfer illnesses and ailments , which enthusiasts attribute to both man-made and natural elements . &quot; We don ' t have such a file , &quot; said Dr. Laurene Mascola , chief of the acute communicable_disease control unit of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services . &quot; Some surfers don ' t go_to a doctor , and if they did , doctors have an abysmal rate of reporting routine diseases and illnesses . We would really need a special study and we don ' t have the money. &quot; In general , surfers tend to be a fit bunch with strong muscles and lungs derived from hours of grueling paddling against the tides . Still , many surfers and the doctors who treat them say plenty of anecdotal evidence attests to the sport ' s health consequences . Middle-aged surfers in particular say they must cope_with a growing history of skin ulcers , reef cuts , lacerations from surfboard fins and surfer knots and craters -- bumps and cuts slow to heal from constant paddling and water exposure . In December , San Francisco physician Mark Renneker co-authored a book , entitled &quot; Sick Surfers , &quot; that outlines a comprehensive list of surfer maladies . Renneker founded the Surfer ' s Medical Assn . in 1986 , a Northern California-based international_organization of roughly 700 members , including 400 medical professionals , who are dedicated to improving the health of surfers . Renneker has chronicled such surfer ailments as chronic neck and back problems , fungal_infections from wet suits , fatty growths on the rib_cage from paddling and so-called &quot; ice-cream headaches &quot; -- migraines brought_on by dunking under huge waves in frigid water . The book also attempts to answer surfer queries about angioedema -- the swelling of the extremities in cold water -- and even addresses the consequences of ingesting surf wax , which is used to improve the grip on the boards . One of the most common maladies , however , is &quot; surfers ' ear , &quot; or exostosis . Mostly afflicting cold-water surfers , it is caused when excess water in the ear_canal evaporates in windy conditions and chills the ear . The body responds by growing extra bone in the ear_canal , obstructing hearing . Ear_specialists in seaside communities are_well aware of the affliction , which is treated by drilling away the excess bone . &quot; I must get two to three surfers a month who have to have their ears drilled out with a high-speed diamond burr -- it ' s very painful , &quot; said Dr. Justin MacCarthy , a partner in a Pacific Palisades practice . &quot; I try to tell them to wear ear plugs , but they won ' t do_it . They say it affects their sense of balance. &quot; Surfers have their own descriptions of the pain of the operation and its aftermath . &quot; It ' s like a cherry_bomb going_off inside your head , but you ' re still living , &quot; Fain said . Exposure to the sun has also taken a toll . * Many dermatologists are reporting increased cases of basal cell and squamous_cell_carcinoma , as well as malignant_melanoma . They warn that prolonged exposure to the sun can be dangerous as surfers age . &quot; Each decade of a life in the sun increases the incidents of skin_cancer , &quot; said Dr. Billie Phelps , a Westside dermatologist who has treated many lifeguards and surfers . Veteran surfers also suffer from pterygiums , a tissue growth over the cornea of the eye caused by excessive exposure to wind and ultraviolet_light . &quot; Sunlight bouncing off the water makes people such_as surfers and sailors more susceptible , &quot; said Dr. Troy Elander , a West Los Angeles ophthalmologist . &quot; I ' ve seen dozens of surfers over the years with the problem . Without wearing sunglasses you ' re at an increased risk. &quot; John Hearne , 45-year-old regional director of the Surfer Foundation , a nonprofit environmental organization , now has cataracts on both eyes from sun exposure . The longtime surfer says the vision in his right eye is about 70 % , and declining fast . ( His other eye is fine ) . &quot; I ' ve tried to wear ski-glasses with a leash , but its a hassle in big surf when you ' re duck-diving under waves , &quot; he said . &quot; I tell my kids to always wear their sunglasses as much as possible and to stay out of the midday sun. &quot; * Aside from infirmities caused by the natural elements , many veteran Los Angeles-area surfers believe that water_pollution is eclipsing the sunny elements of the sport . Amid the uncertainty in the scientific world over whether toxins in Santa Monica Bay are making people sick , surfers believe they are unwittingly helping to establish a link between the water and certain illnesses . &quot; I feel_like we ' re the canaries in the coal mine -- we ' ve got this young , healthy group of people that keeps getting sick , &quot; said David Saltman , former executive_director of the Surfrider Foundation . &quot; It ' s a shame we ' re using our youth as front-line guinea_pigs , in some sort of bizarre test to measure a deteriorating environment. &quot; * Rainwater washes large amounts of untreated sewage , trash , debris , animal waste , pesticides , motor_oil and other substances along a web of concrete rivers and storm drains that empty into Santa Monica Bay . In August , 1993 , the American Oceans Campaign , a nonprofit environmental group , completed a two-year study that identified 160 toxic chemicals flowing into the bay from Los Angeles streets . Mark Gold , a staff scientist at the environmental group Heal the Bay , says his organization has received extensive anecdotal evidence from Santa Monica Bay surfers suffering from a wide range of illnesses that could be related to the pollution , such_as stomach_flu , skin_rashes ( surfer ' s itch ) , sinus and ear infections . The level of pollution increases dramatically after storms -- bad news for surfers since that is when the waves are_best . And the prime surfing spots are near storm drains , which dump sediment onto a series of points , reefs , and beach breaks . Better shaped waves are produced as swells peel over the buildup . &quot; You ' re basically out there surfing these big beautiful waves that look_like chocolate_milk , &quot; Hearne said . To many medical experts , storm surfing is a horrific combination . &quot; When diving under a big wave you ' re getting worked over pretty good , &quot; said Dr. Gordon LaBedz , a member of the Surfer ' s Medical Assn . and a Seal Beach resident . &quot; Bacteria-laden water is being forced into your sinuses . ( It ) sits in little hollow areas of your skull , which if it runs_down , can cause an upper respiratory infection. &quot; Their heads , many veteran surfers say , act like remarkable sponges . &quot; I remember working in the afternoon as a busboy , hours after I ' d gotten_out of the water , &quot; Hoch said . &quot; It was a formal affair and as I bent over to serve someone , out of my nose rushed all this water . There ' s nothing you can do . You know it ' s coming and there it is. &quot; * Many veteran surfers agree one of the most unhealthy places to surf has been Malibu ' s Surfrider Beach , considered among the best surfing spots in the world . Excellent waves are produced when the swells hit a curving line of large cobblestones hugging the contour of the beach . But the beach ' s geology may be its undoing . The cobblestones come from nearby bacteria-laden Malibu Creek , which flushes out through the Malibu Lagoon . Upstream is the Tapia Water Reclamation Center , which dumps almost 2 million gallons a day of treated effluent into the creek and up_to 7 million gallons on rainy_days . The creek also picks_up bacteria from septic_tank runoff , animal waste and refuse from picnickers . Veteran surfers say that after years of riding the waves there , many have come_down with a range of ailments they blame on the water_pollution , although doctors cannot say for_sure . &quot; Since surfing there in the early ' 80s , I ' ve experienced a lot of respiratory problems , sinus problems , and I keep cycling in and out of diarrhea , &quot; said 44 year-old Joe Sanders , a member of the Malibu Surfing Assn. , a recreational and environmental club . &quot; I ' ve heard a lot from other people that parallels my experience. &quot; * In 1989 , one of Sanders ' surfing pals , Jeff Estep , said he came_down with hepatitis_A , shortly after surfing at Malibu . He said his physician told him &quot; it was quite possible &quot; he contracted the illness from the ocean water . &quot; I remember the bad smell and taste of the water that day , &quot; Estep said . &quot; I was bedridden for nearly two months . My urine was like Coca-Cola , my stool was like white glue and my eyes were yellow . Every surfer should get a gamma_globulin shot before going_out there. &quot; The shot boosts the immune_system . A more extreme and controversial case involves surfer Eric Villanueva , 22 . In May , 1992 , Villanueva came_down with flu-like symptoms after surfing near Malibu Lagoon in the wake of a storm . Within a month he had congestive_heart_failure , and two months later he received a heart transplant . Doctors found high levels of antibodies in Villanueva ' s blood caused by the coxsackie B virus , a strain found in human feces that can attack and weaken the heart . Public studies have located coxsackie B in the Malibu Lagoon . &quot; If you go_out there after the rains , or after the berm is breached , you ' re gambling with your life , &quot; said Villanueva , who had to have a second transplant 11 months after the first one due_to complications . &quot; I am 99 % sure I caught the virus ( near the Malibu Lagoon ) , &quot; Villanueva said . &quot; I can ' t think where else I got_it -- I ' m not in the habit of licking toilet bowls. &quot; But experts cannot say for_sure where he contracted the illness . &quot; It ' s possible that someone could get the virus while surfing in the bay , &quot; said Dr. Michele Hamilton , co-director of the UCLA cardiomyopathy program , which is treating Villanueva . &quot; However , this is a common virus , with many avenues . It could have been poor hygiene , family contact or a restaurant. &quot; * Many surfers are aware of the problems associated with the sport , but addiction to the waves overrides their concerns . &quot; I remember the 1990 Huntington Beach oil spill , &quot; Gold said . &quot; The waves were a perfect two to four feet , and guys were out there surfing the slick . Surfers will do anything to catch a good wave. &quot; Even after Estep got sick with hepatitis , he remembers going surfing with his sons and walking past a sign warning of possible unsafe water posted on a Malibu beach . &quot; I told my boys to check for any open wounds , and to just spit a lot , keep spitting . Then out we went. &quot; County officials recommend staying out of the water when such signs are displayed . Hoch uses cosmic terms to theorize why surfers will travel_to distant islands , miles from medical_care , risking life and limb to ride the perfect wave . &quot; Waves are the unifying constants of the universe , they ' re everywhere -- sound_waves , light waves moving across many mediums , &quot; Hoch said . &quot; Most waves are going at least 700 m.p.h. , but only ocean waves are moving at a speed humans can ride , really tap into . The waves also travel through a beautiful medium -- the ocean . There ' s something about all that that brings people back over and over. &quot; Johnny Fain regularly and painfully swims a mile in the Pepperdine University swimming_pool to rehabilitate his hip -- and get ready for his inevitable return to the surf . &quot; I ' m a gladiator , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ll be back_out there within eight months. &quot;</TEXT>
