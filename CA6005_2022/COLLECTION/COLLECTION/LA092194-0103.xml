   <HEADLINE> FUNDING MEASURE ON BALLOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Cal State Northridge athletic department on Tuesday succeeded in placing on next month ' s student election ballot a measure that could mean the difference between financial feast or famine . On Oct . 18-19 , Northridge students will vote on a referendum in which registration fees would be hiked $ 49 each semester . The funds would underwrite the majority of the athletic department ' s budget . The Associated Students Senate on Tuesday voted to place the referendum on the fall ballot by a 15-4 margin . The Senate also authorized a plan in which voting will take_place by touch-tone telephone . &quot; We have a lot of work ahead of us , &quot; Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said . &quot; It is primarily going_to be educating the students as far as the consequences if it doesn ' t pass. &quot; Passage of the referendum is critical to maintaining the school ' s NCAA Division I status , department officials claim . The Northridge athletics program stands to lose as much as $ 700 # 000 in 1995-96 because of budget_cuts and earthquake-related expenses on campus , officials said . The referendum would generate approximately $ 2.25 million if the current enrollment of 24 # 000 remains steady . The school ' s current athletics budget is $ 3.6 million . The department , which had a similar fee proposal shot down in the spring , doesn ' t plan a reprise . A publicity blitz is planned leading_up to the election and Hiegert already has met with Matador athletes to outline the positives associated with the referendum ' s passage . Hiegert said a meeting to plan campaign strategies has been planned for today . A rally has been planned for the eve of the election . If the proposal is defeated , Northridge might be forced to make drastic cuts , which could result in the elimination of football and other programs . Northridge could revert to Division II unless 14 teams can be fielded , the requisite number for membership in Division I , Hiegert said . The school has played in Division I since 1990 .</TEXT>
