   <HEADLINE> U.S. PROSECUTOR GETS REPRIMAND IN PAYOLA CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Justice_Department has formally reprimanded a veteran prosecutor for failing to disclose critical information in a high-profile Los Angeles payola case , according to court documents obtained by The Times . Assistant Atty . Gen . Jo Ann Harris , in_charge of the criminal division , criticized the actions of William S . Lynch , the lead prosecutor in the government ' s case against Joseph Isgro of Glendale , who was the nation ' s largest independent record promoter in the 1980s . Isgro ' s defense_lawyer said the Justice_Department ' s action was inadequate and &quot; a whitewash. &quot; U.S. District Judge James M . Ideman , who first dismissed charges against Isgro in 1990 , has said : &quot; This is a case where the government ' s misconduct was as outrageous and egregious as anything that I have seen. &quot; Ideman dismissed the payola case against Isgro and two other men after learning that Lynch , who had been sent from Washington to head the prosecution , concealed information that cast serious doubts on the merits of the case . Prosecutors are required by law to turn_over any material that might exonerate a defendant . On Wednesday , Justice_Department officials formally notified Judge Ideman that they had reprimanded Lynch . &quot; As a result of my review , I found that Mr. Lynch had failed to produce a document that he should have produced to the defense , &quot; Harris said in a letter to the judge . Harris , however , emphasized that Lynch did not intentionally violate his obligation to disclose the information and said the prosecutor had not realized the significance of the document to the defense . Lynch declined comment , as did Ideman , through his secretary . In her letter to the judge , Harris said that Atty . Gen . Janet Reno &quot; has directed me to give the highest priority to developing uniformly high standards relating &quot; to the government ' s duty to disclose exculpatory information . The Isgro case is one of several recent instances in which the actions of government attorneys have been harshly criticized by federal judges . The document Lynch failed to disclose was a transcript of testimony given by Isgro ' s former tax lawyer , Dennis DiRicco , in an earlier San Francisco case . Ideman characterized the testimony as &quot; a complete and detailed denial of any wrongdoing . . . by any of the defendants in this case. &quot; The judge noted that at a later Los Angeles grand_jury session , Lynch &quot; extracted . . . diametrically opposed testimony &quot; from DiRicco that played a key role in obtaining an indictment against Isgro . The earlier testimony cast doubts upon DiRicco ' s credibility , and thus could have helped Isgro . But Ideman said the government had attempted to lull the defense with &quot; false assurances &quot; that there was no exculpatory material and that Lynch &quot; engaged in active misrepresentation to the court regarding the existence of such material. &quot; Nearly three years later , the Justice_Department ' s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted an internal investigation and concluded that Lynch &quot; did not intentionally violate &quot; his disclosure requirements . Officials concluded that Lynch did not intentionally lie to Ideman concerning the transcript of DiRicco ' s prior testimony . Instead , they found that Lynch was &quot; unfamiliar_with the substance of the 800-page transcript &quot; and because of this did not recognize that it contained material helpful to the defense . When Assistant Atty . Gen . Harris reviewed the case , she agreed with the findings . Nonetheless , she concluded that Lynch should be reprimanded because he failed to produce exculpatory evidence &quot; and exposed the United States_Department of Justice to damaging allegations of professional misconduct. &quot; A March 24 letter from Harris to Lynch , who has been with the Justice_Department since 1961 , states : &quot; In view of your imminent retirement , outstanding career , clear acceptance of responsibility and genuine remorse for the mistake you made here , I do not believe further discipline is required. &quot; Isgro ' s defense_lawyer , Donald M . Re of Los Angeles , criticized the Justice_Department ' s action as &quot; a whitewash. &quot; &quot; They completely ignore specific factual findings made by Judge Ideman regarding Lynch ' s conduct . It is that specific conduct of lying to the judge that led to the dismissal of this case , &quot; Re said . At a court hearing last December , Ideman said Lynch ' s &quot; misconduct was extremely premeditated ; it was repeated over and over again over a period of weeks and even months. &quot; The reprimand could be significant because Isgro still faces charges including racketeering , mail_fraud and undisclosed payola payments to radio_stations . In September , 1992 , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Ideman ' s dismissal of the charges against Isgro , saying recent Supreme Court decisions restricted the ability of federal judges to dismiss cases because of prosecutorial misconduct . The appeals court suggested that Ideman consider sanctioning in lieu of dismissing the case . Ideman said at a subsequent hearing that he disagreed_with the 9th Circuit but was bound to reinstate the charges against Isgro . However , in December , Ideman took other action that was almost as severe as dismissing the case . He ruled that in a new trial scheduled for later this year the government could not present any testimony from DiRicco . Moreover , Ideman told prosecutors they could not call any new witnesses , who might fill_in critical holes created by DiRicco ' s absence . The government has appealed that decision . In a brief filed last week , the government refers to the reprimand of Lynch in a footnote . The Times was unable to reach the current lead prosecutor in the case , Assistant U.S. Atty . Drew Pitt . Neither his conduct nor that of anyone else in the Los Angeles U.S. attorney ' s office has been called into question . Weinstein reported in Los Angeles , Ostrow in Washington .</TEXT>
