   <HEADLINE> THE STUDIO SHUFFLE ; FRANK PRICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Then : Chairman of motion_picture division , Columbia Pictures , 1979-1984 ; chairman of MCA Motion_Picture group , 1984-1987 ; chairman of Columbia Pictures , 1990-1991 . Now : Chairman of Price Entertainment . * Becoming a studio chief was the realization of a dream for Frank Price , whose boyhood was spent on the Warner Bros . lot where his mother worked in the commissary . Photographs of Errol Flynn , Humphrey Bogart , Olivia de Havilland and James Cagney -- inscribed &quot; To Frankie &quot; -- still decorate his walls . &quot; The idea that I had Harry Cohn ' s job was a real kick , &quot; says Price , 64 , of the legendary Columbia Pictures mogul . &quot; Though there was certainly some ego-stroking , the best part of the job was the ability to buy the best -- directors , scripts , talent . The worst was spending your day saying ' no ' -- telling people you don ' t share their dreams . You ' re making subjective decisions in a very amorphous realm . . . and have to wait 18 to 24 months before you know if you guessed right. &quot; After presiding over Universal ' s TV division , which turned_out 15 movies of the week plus 15 to 19 hours of programming each year , Price found the feature_film world relatively manageable . &quot; It ' s like playing poker , &quot; he says . &quot; When you like a job , they have to pry you away from the table -- even if you don ' t win every hand , &quot; he says . &quot; Whenever I felt overly stressed , I reminded myself that it ' s easier than writing . It ' s ' let ' s put_on a show ' . . . and getting paid to do_it . Unwilling to base my decisions on other people ' s perceptions , I spent a lot of my time reading . From what I understand , however , that ' s the exception rather than the rule. &quot; Price calls studio chief one of the world ' s great jobs . &quot; I ' d like to know what the drawbacks are , &quot; he says . &quot; Anyone who complains about the stresses is a fool . The pay and the perks are good . You have fun lunches with Streisand and Redford . And it ' s sort of like being head of a small country . Though I rarely used the plane , I was met at the airport and commanded a certain amount of deference . Things go your way -- period. &quot; Price had 14 months of relative leisure between his 1987 departure from Universal and his production deal with Columbia / TriStar . During that time , he listened to Mozart and devoured books ranging from &quot; Das Kapital &quot; to Adam Smith ' s &quot; The Wealth of Nations. &quot; That was a luxury , he realized then . But his heart was with the action . &quot; It ' s always better to have power than not , &quot; Price says . &quot; Still , once you occupy that office , you take some of that leverage and credibility with you . You can ' t say ' yes ' to $ 25-million pictures but , in some way , you ' re still ' Mr. President. ' Being a studio chief is a calling card and we all work with labels . &quot; I look_upon that experience as gathering research for my novel -- my version of ' The Last Tycoon. ' &quot; Price concludes . &quot; I know that world better than F . Scott Fitzgerald . This is a business like no other . Though there may_not be any more politics and infighting in Hollywood than elsewhere , the stakes are so_much higher . One bad casting decision can ruin a picture. &quot; ELAINE DUTKA</TEXT>
