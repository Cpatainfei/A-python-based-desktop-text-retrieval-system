   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH : STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS ; EXCHANGES ; AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCE IS A REFRESHING CHANGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Camrin Christensen , a junior from Laguna Hills High_School , is spending the school_year as an American Field Service student in the Czech Republic , where she is living with a family of five . She attends Secondary_School of Nursing in Kolin , about 45 miles from Prague . * When I first learned that I would be going_to the Czech Republic as an exchange student , I was warned about the lack of fruits and vegetables in the everyday diet . I was told to expect meat , sausages , dumplings and potatoes . It seems the Czechs are_well known for their lack of concern about a balanced_diet . What I have encountered , however , is a different situation . Although I have had my fair share of meat and potatoes , I also have plenty of fruits and vegetables . In fact , many families here own land in the countryside , where they grow their own fruits and vegetables . Also , most families do their own canning and preserving for the cold winter . Fruits and vegetables have not always been easily available , though . My host mother , Frantiska , told me that just seven years ago people had to wait in_line to purchase fruit , which was both expensive and difficult to find . Now , the government has started to import greater amounts of fruits and vegetables , making them more abundant and less expensive . CAMRIN CHRISTENSEN</TEXT>
