   <HEADLINE> PLAGUE FEARS AGAIN CLOSE CAMPGROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Lockwood Valley campground has been closed for the second year in a row after biologists found rodents infected with the plague . The Chuchupate Campground in Los Padres National Forest was also closed by health officials in 1993 after wild animals there were found to be carrying plague bacteria . Now officials have renewed the ban after finding plague bacteria in blood samples taken from rodents that were trapped as part of an ongoing disease-monitoring program , said Randall Smith of the county Environmental Health Division . &quot; Ventura County is known as an endemic county for plague in wild rodents , &quot; said Smith , an environmental health specialist . &quot; We know it ' s here and we just try and monitor it in the areas where people can come_in contact with wild rodents , such_as campgrounds. &quot; The plague bacteria found at Chuchupate in Lockwood Valley are the same type that killed millions of Europeans in the Middle_Ages , Smith said . But nowadays , he said , plague-infected people can be cured easily with antibiotics -- if the symptoms are recognized and treated in time . The most common form , called bubonic_plague , is spread by the bites of animals or the fleas that infest them . The name comes from the word buboes , for the large balls that form on the lymph_nodes as the organs try to fight the infection . * A rarer form known as pneumonic_plague , spread by particles in the air such_as those emitted by a sneeze or cough of an infected animal , kills its victims much more rapidly . Only two people are known to have ever survived pneumonic_plague , said Charles Myers , supervising biologist of a California Department of Health Services lab that studies animal- and insect-borne diseases . &quot; It ' s not easy to get , but you still don ' t want to get_it , &quot; Myers said of all forms of plague . &quot; As one of the survivors of pneumonic_plague told us , ' I ' d never want to do that again. ' &quot; Plague victims suffer symptoms such_as those of a harsh flu -- high fever , severe muscle aches , nausea and painful or swollen lymph_nodes . Common_sense is the best defense , officials say . &quot; When you ' re camping , avoid areas where you see squirrel burrows -- putting your sleeping_bag out on the ground where you see squirrel burrows is asking_for a fleabite , &quot; Myers said . &quot; And taking your pets camping with you is asking_for a fleabite . Your dog sticks his nose in a squirrel burrow and the fleas are all waiting there , and they ' ll jump_on him. &quot; It is not unusual for biologists to find plague bacteria in about 20 counties across California each year , he said . The state health department screens for plague bacteria in thousands of blood and tissue samples taken every year in the parks , forests and farms of California , said department spokesman Ken Townzen . Lab technicians have found about 100 samples that tested positive for plague so far this year -- a rate that could surpass 1993 ' s total of about 150 positive tests , he said . &quot; We find it as far north as Alpine and Eldorado County , all_the way down to San Bernardino County in the south , &quot; Townzen said . In Ventura County , biologists have focused much of their trapping and testing this year on Lockwood Valley . They trapped 56 animals there in June , of which two -- a wood_rat and a ground_squirrel -- were found to be carrying plague bacteria , Smith said . They also trapped and tested animals in the Pine Mountain area , where plague-bearing animals were found three years ago . But this year no trace of plague was found there , he said . * Budget_cuts and busy state labs restrict county biologists to only 100 plague sample tests each year , he said . &quot; We try and pick areas that the public will possibly come_in contact with the wild rodent population , &quot; he said , such_as campgrounds and ranches . Smith said biologists also have been testing trapped mice for evidence of hantavirus , a disease carried in the animals ' dried feces and urine that can kill its victims in a matter of days . They are still awaiting results from those tests , he said . As for the plague , Smith said , &quot; It ' s curable if diagnosed early , but if you don ' t get_to the doctor on_time or it ' s not caught in time , it can be a life-threatening disease. &quot; Avoiding the Plague Plague bacteria carried by rats and fleas killed millions of Europeans in the Middle_Ages . Plague is curable today with antibiotics , but it can be fatal if its flu-like symptoms are misdiagnosed . Rural residents and nature lovers should follow these rules : * STAY AWAY from chipmunks , squirrels and other wild animals . Do not feed them . * DO NOT camp , rest or sleep near animal burrows , and avoid fleas . * PROTECT PETS with flea powder or collars . * DO NOT touch sick or dead_animals . Report them to park , campground or local health authorities . * SEE A DOCTOR if you get sick within one week of visiting rural Ventura County . The symptoms of plague are high fever , severe muscle aches , nausea and painful or swollen lymph_nodes . Source : Ventura County Environmental Health Division</TEXT>
