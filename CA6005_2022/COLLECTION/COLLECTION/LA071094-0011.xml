   <TEXT> TRACKING THE VANISHING TREE_FROGS : An Ecological Mystery by Kathryn Phillips ( St . Martin ' s Press : $ 22.95 ; 244 pp. ) They ' re disappearing , the foothill yellow-legged frogs , the common bullfrogs , the Yosemite_toads , Cascade frogs , leopard_frogs , and western_toads . One half of the 21 species native to California are in decline . Herpetologists from all_over , perplexed at the continued disappearance of species that had been_on the planet for between 150 and 200 million years , met in February 1990 in Irvine , California and exchanged anecdotes . From there , several , including the two scientists that Phillips travels with , Mark Jennings and Marc Hayes , went_on to document the probable_causes for the disappearance of several species . Development , acid_rain , deforestation and pesticide poisoning are probable_causes . But the most likely cause emerging from available data is ozone depletion and climate change . Scientists measuring stress caused by increased exposure to UV-B radiation found that frogs could respond to and avoid it in the lab but not in the wild . Their body_temperature is regulated by their environment , and unfortunately , they like to sunbathe ! Still other experiments showed the immediate effects of increased radiation on eggs and tadpoles . While many claim that there is insufficient evidence that frogs can serve as &quot; bioindicators &quot; -- canaries in the rapidly warming coal mine we all live_in -- that speculation is not entirely unfounded . Like Douglas Hand in &quot; Gone Whaling &quot; ( above ) , Phillips shows , along the way , the difference between the leaders or pioneers in a field ( often scientists not attached_to institutions ) , and the followers.Jennings and Hayes were successful in their efforts ( against a recalcitrant U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ) to get_at least one species , the California red-legged frog , listed as threatened , but &quot; a 1990 audit by the U.S. Department_of_the_Interior ' s Inspector_General found six hundred candidates that the Fish and Wildlife Service deemed eligible for listing had not been listed . ' During the last ten years , ' the audit said , ' at least thirty-four animal and plant species have been determined to be extinct without ever having received full benefit of the ( Endangered Species ) act ' s protection. &quot; Canary in the coal mine or not , they aren ' t the only species that likes to sunbathe .</TEXT>
