   <HEADLINE> NEW IDEAS ABOUT ' PEOPLE WITH NO NAME ' ; ENVIRONMENT : MYSTERY CLAN OF FARMERS AND ARTISANS THRIVED FOR A TIME , THEN VANISHED AFTER LAYING WASTE TO THEIR RESOURCES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Among the most recently recognized examples of the environmental destruction caused by primitive civilizations involves a mysterious group that lived along the south coast of Guatemala dating_back about 1 # 800 years . Contemporaries of the Maya and the Teotihuacan of Mexico , these farmers and artisans , as yet unnamed by researchers , seemingly came_out of nowhere and established a regional civilization that thrived for 600 years . Then , having overused their local resources and otherwise fouled their nest , the &quot; People With No Name &quot; fragmented , fell_into warfare and disappeared as mysteriously as they arrived . As recently as 10 years ago , archeologists thought that this was a relatively insignificant group , a handful of villages that represented perhaps a colony of Teotihuacan or conquered vassals . But major new discoveries by UC Santa Barbara archeologist Fred Bove -- particularly the extended urban_area around the recently found city of Los Chatos -- are rapidly changing that assessment . Far from being a small , subjugated community , Bove has found , the &quot; People With No Name &quot; were a sophisticated civilization with their own styles of written language , art and architecture . They lived between the Maya and the Teotihuacan , trading with both and adopting the best features of their cultures . Their history , as Bove has pieced it together , is the tale of Central_America in microcosm . Bove has been working_on the South Coast since the late 1970s . His first discovery was the city called Balberta . Occupied by the &quot; People With No Name &quot; before AD 200 , it flourished briefly until it was abandoned around AD 350 . No signs of warfare or natural disaster remain to explain its collapse , Bove said . The group simply moved as mysteriously as it had appeared -- perhaps to nearby Los Chatos , which eventually fell_into environmental ruin . The Los Chatos region , explored by Bove for the first time in the late 1980s , is an extraordinarily large site , extending as much as five miles along the river . It has two highly unusual characteristics for Central_American sites : It was not built over by subsequent civilizations , and it has apparently been largely untouched by looters . Bove ' s team , which is based at the University of San Carlos , has only barely begun to examine the site , but already they have found many unique treasures that provide insight to the lives of the &quot; People With No Name. &quot; Perhaps the first sign of impending environmental disaster occurred around AD 700 when Los Chatos ' central authority fragmented and small communities began to exert their own authority . One indicator is the widespread appearance of ceremonial handball_courts -- which previously have been found only at government centers . That decentralization , according to archeologist Charles L . Redman of Arizona State University , may have resulted from people in outlying areas needing to conserve their resources and food , which had shrunk because of over-harvesting of trees and poor farming practices . The inevitable collapse soon followed , Bove said . The ruling elite consumed too many resources and could no longer be supported by the underclass . &quot; They polluted water reservoirs with their own refuse , &quot; Bove said . &quot; They deforested large areas for their construction . The elite population . . . lost the balance that the elites need with the common_people that support them &quot; and the society collapsed in chaos . &quot; Without waxing poetic about it , there is a lesson here for all_of us. &quot;</TEXT>
