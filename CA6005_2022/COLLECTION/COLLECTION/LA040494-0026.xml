   <TEXT> News_stories published in the past several days have given women worried about breast_cancer three new reasons to feel nervous . Revelations of research fraud , &quot; discrepancies &quot; and an ensuing cover-up have cast doubts on a study concluding that lumpectomy is as effective as radical_mastectomy in the treatment of early-stage breast tumors . Another report revealed that the breast_cancer treatment drug tamoxifen causes three times as_many uterine cancers as researchers had previously suspected . Finally , five female U.S. senators blasted the National Cancer Institute ' s decision to stop recommending screening mammograms to women under age 50 . These three developments have left millions of women thoroughly confused about what ' s best for their health . The lumpectomy research question seems to be the one most easily resolved . Any researcher who falsified data should be punished . The administrator of the international breast_cancer study has already been removed . But the bottom_line is that the relatively small amount of discovered fraud shouldn ' t affect the study ' s conclusion , that lumpectomy with radiation has a survival rate as_good_as mastectomy . The other stories , though they got less news coverage , raise warning flags about the cancer Establishment ' s willingness to endanger women . First , mammography : It ' s one thing to irradiate cancerous breast tissue to treat the disease , but quite another to do so in the name of early detection . Health physicists generally agree that there is no safe level of radiation , and that even today ' s low-dose screening mammograms pose some cancer risk . In women over 50 , available studies show that the benefit clearly outweighs the hazard , but in younger_women the situation is less clear . While the five senators who urged the National Cancer Institute to reconsider its change of policy clearly want women to have_the_best health_care available , their anger may be misdirected . If the institute is correct , then screening mammograms for asymptomatic women under 50 should go the way of the periodic chest X-ray , once touted for early detection of lung_cancer . The tamoxifen revelation raises equally disturbing questions . Researchers know that the drug helps prevent the recurrence of breast_cancer in women who have been treated for the disease . But they are now testing the drug on women who have never had breast_cancer but are considered &quot; at high risk &quot; for the disease , to determine whether it works for prevention . Researchers have stopped enrolling new participants . But they continue to give a potentially hazardous drug to about 10 # 000 women already in the study . Both tamoxifen and mammography spring from a research mind-set that favors high-tech treatment . Both were developed by wealthy industries that have close ties to the major cancer organizations and help finance most public awareness campaigns . In fact , the cancer institute ' s initial support of screening mammography for premenopausal women may fundamentally have been driven by an oversupply of mammography machines . The processes that drive medical research toward expensive treatments also turn it away from preventive measures that do not hold the promise of corporate profit . For example , several recent studies suggest that the organochlorine family of chemicals ( among them the pesticide DDT and the industrial pollutants dioxin and the PCBs ) may contribute to breast_cancer . Yet the relationship between these environmental toxins and breast_cancer continues to receive scant attention from the research community . Where they tend toward unquestioning belief when it comes_to the efficacy of high-tech cancer treatment , many industry and government researchers suddenly turn skeptical when presented with evidence of the environmental causes of cancer . This is why $ 68 million of public money is being spent to determine whether tamoxifen may prevent breast_cancer , while only a small fraction of that amount is directed to research analyzing environmental clues . Industry is leading us down a self-serving road in environmental and medical research . More public money needs to go instead to research on the underlying causes of increasing rates of breast and other cancers . What factors_in our air , water and food turn_on our bodies ' cancer-causing genes ? What steps can we take_to avoid becoming cancer patients in need of high-tech treatment ? To answer these questions , the research community will have to gain some distance from both corporations that profit from the cancer business and those that produce environmental toxins . Often they are the very same corporations .</TEXT>
