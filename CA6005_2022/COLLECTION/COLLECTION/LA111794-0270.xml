   <HEADLINE> CLINTON URGES INDONESIA TO IMPROVE RIGHTS ; ASIA : BUT PRESIDENT , IN MEETING WITH SUHARTO , SETS NO CONDITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT TIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton on Wednesday pressed Indonesia to clean_up its human_rights record , but without setting deadlines or demanding remedies that could disrupt ties with the world ' s fourth-largest country . Fresh from a summit with leaders of 17 Pacific Rim nations , Clinton said that his Administration will pursue improved human_rights &quot; with conviction and without apology. &quot; But while Clinton and his lieutenants urged better treatment of ethnic minorities , journalists and labor activists , they largely left it to the Indonesians to find their way to such a goal . The softer approach appeared to reflect the Administration ' s determination to assign a high priority to trade deals while avoiding costly confrontations over human_rights . Last May , the Administration decided to drop linkage between trade benefits and human_rights in its relations with China . Under renewed pressure from advocacy groups and Congress , Clinton laid_out his human_rights goals in a meeting with Indonesian President Suharto at his Merdeka Palace , then talked to a group of U.S. and Asian business people . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , meanwhile , met with a human_rights commission appointed by the Indonesian government , while other U.S. officials held a partly boycotted meeting with local human_rights groups . Human_rights have cast a shadow over the summit because of violent demonstrations in the disputed territory of East Timor and a five-day sit-in by Timorese students at the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta . Clinton raised the Timor issue with his Indonesian hosts but failed to win any agreements to end the embassy protest . A former Portuguese colony 1 # 200 miles east of Jakarta , East Timor was annexed by Indonesia in the 1970s and has been the site of frequent clashes between the predominantly Catholic population and Indonesian troops , who are mainly Muslim . Clinton ' s state visit with Suharto included a &quot; rather lengthy &quot; discussion of human_rights and the East Timor conflict , aides said . But rather than prod the Indonesian leader , Clinton simply told him that he welcomed the recent talks between the Indonesians and Timorese separatists in New York . Clinton also raised the issue of labor rights with Suharto , but aides said he did not specifically mention last week ' s jailing of Muchtar Pakpahan , the leader of Indonesia ' s largest independent trade_union , for three years on charges of inciting unrest . The Clinton_Administration has suspended an investigation into Indonesia ' s labor practices that will determine whether the country can continue to receive trade benefits known as the General System of Preferences . Human_rights groups had pressed Clinton to resume the investigation , but he took no action . But Clinton also praised the Indonesian leader for his efforts on behalf of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum . On Tuesday , the group pledged to remove all trade_barriers among APEC countries by the year 2020 . Clinton maintained that his human_rights concerns need not interfere with U.S. efforts to strengthen economic ties to the region . &quot; Even though we will continue to promote human_rights with conviction and without apology , we reject the notion that increasing economic ties_in trade and partnerships undermine our human_rights agenda , &quot; Clinton told a group of high-ranking U.S. and Asian business people . Christopher , describing Clinton ' s views to reporters , said that &quot; the relationship between the United States and Indonesia can never reach its highest levels if the people of the United States don ' t have confidence that there is an effort here to respect the rights of all_the citizens. &quot; Christopher ' s deputy , Winston Lord , held an informal meeting with a group of local human_rights activists , but the Indonesian Legal Aid Society and a number of other rights groups boycotted the meeting because they said it did not appear to be a serious effort . &quot; Everyone was in a hurry , and there did not seem to be any point , &quot; said Goenawan Muhammad , the former editor of the best-selling Tempo magazine , which was ordered closed by the government for printing articles critical of the Suharto government . Meanwhile , the Administration ' s foremost interest in the trip -- trade -- was also in_evidence , as Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown witnessed the signing of a series of contracts , worth about $ 40 billion , between U.S. and Asian firms . Among them was a $ 35-billion deal between an Exxon Corp . affiliate and Indonesia ' s national oil_company to extract liquid natural_gas from the South_China_Sea . Brown helped put the deal together . Clinton was to arrive in Hawaii today for three days of relaxation before returning to Washington on Sunday .</TEXT>
