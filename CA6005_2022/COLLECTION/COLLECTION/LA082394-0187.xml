During the festival , Prince Charles will visit Los Angeles to attend UK / LA and other events related to fund-raising for Los Angeles inner-city charities , according to the consul general . The opening UK / LA 1994 event , Sept . 7 at the Hollywood Bowl , is a performance by Manchester ' s Halle Orchestra , conducted by its music_director , California native Kent Nagano . Following a Sept . 6 preview concert , on Sept . 7 the orchestra will perform a salute to British film music featuring William Walton ' s score for Laurence Olivier ' s &quot; Henry_V , &quot; with a guest narrator to be named later . First announced in April , the festival will include more_than 40 Los Angeles cultural organizations , involving 370 artists in a half-dozen artistic disciplines presented in 46 venues from Santa Monica to Pomona , festival officials said . The 75-event festival also includes : the first Prince ' s Trust Concert in the United States , with pop stars to be announced and proceeds to benefit youth charities here and in Britain ; performances by both the Royal National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company ; the West Coast debut of Stomp , a &quot; theater of sound &quot; ; &quot; 3x3 : Great Solo Performances , &quot; featuring Lynn Redgrave , British character actress Miriam Margolyes and Steven Berkoff , perhaps best known in Los Angeles for his long-running play , &quot; Kvetch &quot; ; the Academy of St .

The festival officially ends Nov . 14 , although some art_exhibitions presented under the festival umbrella will continue into 1995 . The 1988 UK / LA festival primarily featured mainstream arts and performers . This time , Bruce Joseph , UK / LA ' s executive_director , stressed that the programs reflect the variety of cultures in the_British Isles . &quot; We want to dispel the preconceived notions so many Americans have of the United Kingdom -- that it ' s bobbies , beefeaters , double-deck buses and Shakespeare . . . . It ' s very much a multiracial , multicultural society , &quot; Joseph said . Performances include the a cappella women ' s group Black Voices ; a seminar on black British cinema ; performances by Leeds ' Phoenix Dance Company , which features British artists of Afro-Caribbean descent ; Spanish and English performances of &quot; The Merchant of Venice &quot; by Will &amp; Company , and a collaboration between the Glasgow Print Studio and Self-Help Graphics of East Los Angeles .
