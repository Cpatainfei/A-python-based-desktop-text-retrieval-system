   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; JOHN GREGORY DUNNE ; DOMINICK DUNNE ; EXPERIENCING L.A. THROUGH THE EYES OF THE WRITER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the 1960s and ' 70s , Dominick Dunne and his younger brother , John Gregory , pretty much owned this town . Sons of a well-to-do Connecticut family -- &quot; We were like minor-league Kennedys , &quot; Dominick once wrote -- they came_to Los Angeles and prospered . Dominick became a movie producer . John , with his wife , writer Joan Didion , crafted novels and screenplays , earning literary kudos and lots of Hollywood lucre . Dominick produced Joan ' s &quot; Play It as It Lays , &quot; as well as &quot; Panic in Needle Park , &quot; written by Didion and her husband , who also wrote the remake of &quot; A Star Is Born. &quot; Both brothers eventually left Los Angeles , but each remains wedded to it . By the end of the ' 70s , Dominick Dunne ' s drinking had gotten_out of control . He abandoned the city and his career as a producer . &quot; I sold everything , &quot; he remembers , &quot; even my shirts. &quot; He emerged , sober , after six months of isolation in Oregon , and recast himself as a writer . His first book , &quot; The Winners , &quot; was a sequel to Joyce Haber ' s Hollywood potboiler , &quot; The Users. &quot; Critics abhorred it , but it sold well enough to earn him a sizable advance for his next effort , &quot; The Two Mrs . Grenvilles. &quot; Then , in short order , his youngest brother , Stephen , committed suicide , and his daughter , Dominique , was murdered by her boyfriend . Dominick took_notes throughout the trial , which became the basis for a Vanity_Fair article , &quot; Justice. &quot; He has since written dozens of pieces for the magazine -- his latest is about the trial of Erik and Lyle Menendez . Meanwhile , John Gregory Dunne and his wife had become among the highest-paid screenwriters in Hollywood . They also created powerful essays and fiction ; Joan wrote &quot; Salvador &quot; and &quot; A Book_of_Common_Prayer , &quot; while John skewered Hollywood mores in &quot; The Studio &quot; and spent four years writing the novel &quot; The Red , White and Blue. &quot; Then , in 1988 , after 24 years in Los Angeles , they shocked their friends , and themselves , by picking_up and moving to New York . John says , &quot; I ' d written nine books , each of which touched_on Los Angeles , and I felt tapped_out . We weren ' t working and needed a goose. &quot; Today is John Gregory Dunne ' s 30th wedding_anniversary . He ' s 61 , the proud father of a photographer daughter who works for Travel and Leisure . His latest novel , &quot; Playland , &quot; will be published this summer . Dominick , 65 , has been in Los Angeles for six months , covering the Menendez trial -- he experienced the fires last fall and rode_out the Northridge earthquake in his room at the Chateau Marmont . Each man speaks about the city as one might of a longtime lover , with the kind of longing one has for someone cherished and too casually spurned . Question : You ' ve both experienced many of the modern calamities we ' ve been through in Los Angeles . What stands_out in your memory ? John Gregory Dunne : Joan and I went_into South-Central during the Watts riots of 1965 -- we wrote_about that . In 1971 , we were thrown_out of bed by the Sylmar quake . We were living_in Malibu at the time , and got a really good shake . We went_through three major fires while living_in Malibu . So we were aware of nature and its discontent . I have one strong memory from the Watts riots . We went_down to South-Central and we wrote_about what we saw there . But my memory goes_back to something far away from the scene of the action . We lived , at the time , in Portuguese Bend , at the very tip of Palos Verdes . And I remember our landlord showing me a shotgun he had just bought . He said , &quot; I ' m going_to be ready in case people come_out here. &quot; The idea of buying a shotgun in Palos Verdes to stop the hordes seemed most bizarre -- and these were days when people were not so likely to buy guns as they are now . This was a shotgun that could have brought_down a goddamned elephant . That is my most striking memory of the Watts riots . Q : Dominick , how does the Northridge earthquake rate in your pantheon of Los Angeles disasters ? Dominick Dunne : I have been through others , of course , but this was the worst . I did not do that smart thing that you are supposed to do -- hop_up and get under a table . I just lay there and thought , &quot; Well , this is the end of the line. &quot; I collected myself , said my little prayer and watched my television_set fly out onto the floor . I was extremely calm . When it stopped , I began to think_of what I wanted to have with me , and I began to collect my things -- my glasses , my wallet , my watch . It was pitch dark . And I took the latest draft of my article and stuck it in my back pocket , and made my way down the stairwells . All the guests gathered out on the lawn in front of the hotel , and then we realized there was a surreal light above us . It was coming from the huge Marlboro sign_in front of the hotel , there on Sunset Boulevard . Somehow , the Marlboro man was the only thing left shining in the whole city . That was truly strange -- something I will never forget . Finally , the sun came_up , I returned to my room , and I started working . I wrote all day , and the next day as well . I think I was like many people -- I just wanted to get things back to normal , and I threw myself into my work . So I didn ' t have time to have a reaction for several days . But I ' m almost embarrassed to talk_about my own experience , when so many others experienced things so_much worse . J.G. Dunne : People talk_about how this wasn ' t The Big One . But I think it would have been plenty goddamned big if it had happened during rush_hour . Q : Some people have remarked that Angelenos face these disasters -- fires , mud slides , earthquakes -- with a great_deal of equanimity . Is there something in our nature that prepares us for disaster , or do we simply learn to deal with it ? J.G. Dunne : We learn . When Joan and I lived_in Malibu , we began to know exactly what we would take with us . Once we heard about a fire , we would place our car so it was facing out the driveway . We would bring_out what we were working_on , we would bring photographs , and we would bring Joan ' s old family silver , and cram it all_in the car . We were ready . But I would n ' t say we were particularly calm . We were spooked by fires . D . Dunne : I was always baffled how , after terrible fires , people would rebuild on the same site . that ' s something I could never do . Then , while covering the Menendez trial , I met a man -- he was a witness -- whose house had burned to the ground in the Malibu fire . He explained to me that the only way he could collect on his insurance was to build_on the same site . So it turns_out all this rebuilding may be more about finances , and less about resilience and tenacity . J.G. Dunne : There ' s a curious thing about these quakes and fires . We tend to want to place blame on someone , rather than believing that nature is acting naturally . I ' m often skeptical about claims that these fires are the work of arsonists . But then , in some ways , even the arsonist who sets a fire may be part of that natural cycle . Q : The question of the moment -- the one we get_in phone_calls from back East -- is , why do we live here ? Why do we live_in this desert that shakes and burns and slides ? J.G. Dunne : Most anyplace one lives is essentially dangerous . There are floods_in the Midwest , and tornadoes . There are hurricanes along the Gulf . In New York , you get mugged . All life is inherently dangerous . But beyond that , Los Angeles is just a wonderful place to be . Q : So you think the storied hordes who are making their exodus from the state are making a big mistake ? J.G. Dunne : Well , I remember a story Joan wrote_about a fundamentalist minister who moved himself and his entire congregation to Tennessee because he was terrified of earthquakes . They moved lock , stock and barrel -- and one month later , they had a terrific earthquake in Tennessee . D . Dunne : I left Los Angeles in 1979 , in what were less than favorable circumstances . I had pretty much single-handedly wrecked my career because of a problem with drinking . A few years later , I had a terrible tragedy in my family . And I developed a feeling about Los Angeles , something more_than a strong dislike . I simply never wanted to come here again . Over the years , I came_back to write_about various things , but I did my work , and left as quickly as possible . This time , I came here to cover the Menendez trial , and expected to stay about eight or 10 weeks . It ' s been over six months now , and I have once again fallen_in_love with Los Angeles . I realize there are so many people here who I love . And then this earthquake happens . It has not in any way shaken my faith , or disturbed my new love for this city . I truly feel_like I ' m part of Los Angeles again , and I love that feeling . J.G. Dunne : I liked Los Angeles for odd reasons . For one , there was no sense of community . You were really left to your own resources , spending this inordinate amount_of_time alone in a balloon of an automobile . I liked that a lot . Q : When coupled with the state ' s economic malaise , has this extraordinary series of natural and social disasters meant that the California dream is over ? Does California no longer represent that place where anything is possible ? J.G. Dunne : I resist and resent the idea of California as a metaphor . It ' s something thrust upon us , usually by people in the East . Even though I left it , I suppose I loved Los Angeles more_than any place I ' ve ever been . I loved the idea of being alone . People say the city has no street life , but I think that street life is highly overrated . What sort of street life did William Faulkner have in Oxford , Miss. ? And my wife , Joan , said she never realized how much she loved Los Angeles until she left , and returned to do some reporting . When we lived here , I always did the driving . It wasn ' t until she came_back , and drove herself around , that she realized how much she loved the place . So being behind the wheel is very much part of the experience . D . Dunne : I went_to a party the other night , and people were so desperate to be there , just to talk with other people and tell their own experiences with the quake . This was a real Beverly Hills group of people -- and even these people were devastated by all_of this . I didn ' t hear anyone saying they wanted to leave the city . But I did hear people questioning the way they ' ve gone_about their lives acquiring wealth and possessions . An earthquake can be very humbling in that sense . But it is virtually the only topic of conversation . I was at the Golden Globe awards last week , and I heard the word &quot; God , &quot; more_than I ' ve heard it in a long_time . &quot; Thank God we ' re here , &quot; &quot; thank God we all survived. &quot; I was impressed with that , from that sort of jaded group . Then , I was in a restaurant , in Beverly Hills , having lunch , when we had a strong aftershock . Everyone stopped and became silent . But no one headed for the exits . We all looked_up at this great , huge chandelier and watched it stop shaking . In 30 seconds , everybody went right back to making their deals . It made me love the spirit of this town , the lack of hysteria . J.G. Dunne : You know we have no real memory of pain . If you slam your thumb with a hammer , you have terrible pain . But once it goes , you have memory of the event , but the pain doesn ' t reoccur . So you go_on , and try and get your life back on track as quickly as you can . Still , the experience of these kinds of catastrophes can be very invigorating in a way . After we heard about the quake , Joan said she sort of wished we had been there for it . And I said , &quot; Babe , we ' ve been there . We lived through the Sylmar quake . We ' ve had that experience. &quot; But in my heart of hearts , I wish I had been there , too . When you do what we do , when you are always looking_for a powerful experience , it ' s always nice to be there . There is a sense which is almost like jealousy when people like us miss an event like an earthquake .</TEXT>
