   <HEADLINE> A BIOGRAPHER ' S BIOGRAPHY ; DR . JOHNSON AND MR . SAVAGE , BY RICHARD HOLMES ( PANTHEON : $ 23 ; 272 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We can see them walking together around St . James ' s Square in London , exalted by their shared tastes in literature , high-spirited , exchanging anecdotes and allusions with all_the brio of those learned in the world as well as books . And yet the friendship between Samuel Johnson and Richard Savage has seemed , to the doctor ' s more learned biographers , to be a rare moment of weakness when he left Parnassus in_order to lie_in the gutter . Boswell described Savage ' s character as one marked by &quot; profligacy , insolence , and ingratitude , &quot; although he himself should have recalled that such people are often the best company in the world . The facts would seem to be_on his side , of course ; Savage was about to be hanged for murder when he was granted a royal pardon , and he ended his life in a debtor ' s prison . What could he possibly have to do with the Great Cham , the compiler of the Dictionary , the editor of the Rambler and author of &quot; The Vanity of Human Wishes &quot; ? This is the conundrum that Richard Holmes attempts to solve in &quot; Dr. Johnson and Mr. Savage ; &quot; he describes it as &quot; the biography of a biography , &quot; since he is concerned with removing the accretions of literary mythology and pious memorializing that are supposed to have covered these two early 18th Century writers . So let us go_back to the nights in St . James ' s Square , where Johnson and Savage patrolled the streets together among what Holmes depicts as &quot; the tavern signs , the shuttered house-fronts ; the moonlight and the dark alleys ; the slumbering beggars , the footpads and the Night Watch. &quot; Johnson is in his late 20s ( Savage is approximately 10 years older ) , a strange , large , shambling man , prone to nervous spasms , ugly , half-blind , marked by scrofula . He is also subject_to moods of melancholy , depression and despair . He had achieved very little as a failed schoolmaster in his native Lichfield ; he was the unhappy husband of a woman 20 years his senior , and he could see very little ahead of him except the monotonous grind of hack work for London publishers . Holmes describes the relationship between Johnson and Savage as one resembling pupil and teacher , but it is likely that Savage could educate Johnson in nothing but the darker secrets of the London world . Another explanation for their strange friendship might be found in the mere fact of companionship -- Savage had found a lonely provincial literator who would listen to his stories without feeling the need to correct them , while Johnson had found a high-spirited and exciting friend who could literally , to use an anachronistic phrase , &quot; take him out of himself. &quot; Savage had confronted , and mocked , the world -- just as Johnson , with all his physical and nervous disabilities , longed to do . The two men found an ideal relationship , providing comfort and inspiration in equal measure . It is Holmes ' contention , then , that Johnson was hardly &quot; a sage from boyhood &quot; but an awkward and impressionable young_man . That in itself is hardly surprising , but the strength of Holmes ' book resides in his determined efforts to recapture the living figures who tend to prove so elusive in literary biography . He is very good , in particular , with Johnson ' s thwarted sexuality ; it seems likely that the younger_man was deeply affected by Savage ' s own ready and open acceptance of sexual experience and , although he does not go so far as_to state emphatically that they visited brothels together , the implication is clear enough . But there was more to their relationship than the pursuit of erotic adventure . Holmes has a marvelous chapter entitled &quot; Night , &quot; for example , in which he suggests that the two men were twin subversives , political radicals who despised the claims of wealth and the prerogatives of power . Here we must concentrate upon the career of Savage himself , at least as it appears in Johnson ' s own &quot; Life of Mr. Richard Savage &quot; : &quot; He lodged as much by Accident as he dined and passed the Night , sometimes in mean Houses . . . sometimes in Cellars among the Riot and Filth of the meanest and most profligate of the Rabble. &quot; His story , according to Johnson , is as wretched as any in the history of English literature -- Savage was the abandoned child of Lady Macclesfield , who disowned him at birth , tried to have him shipped off to the American plantations , but then consigned him to a London cobbler where he might live &quot; in Poverty and Obscurity. &quot; But this was only the beginning of Savage ' s misfortunes ; when he was condemned to death for committing a murder in a brothel , his mother urged the Queen to carry_out the sentence without thought of pardon . It is no wonder that Richard Savage , the poet and playwright , should spend much of his literary skill in railing against wealth and privilege . That , at least , is what Holmes describes as &quot; the romantic drama &quot; that Johnson helped both to maintain and to popularize . It is not necessarily accurate , however , and &quot; Dr. Johnson and Mr. Savage &quot; is_on one level an instructive corrective to the prevalence of literary legends . It seems probable that Lady Macclesfield was in fact a loving and attentive mother to her acknowledged children , who was herself victimized by Richard Savage in a campaign of &quot; terrorizing and persecution ; &quot; Savage himself may have in fact only suffered delusions that he was an abandoned child , and his real character was &quot; dangerous , unstable , ambitious , irascible. &quot; It then becomes one of Holmes ' contentions that Johnson ' s insecurity and thwarted ambition led him to identify with Savage , and thus collude in the romantic fictionalization of his plight . In fact , Holmes throws a quite different light_upon the neglect and poverty with which he is associated in Johnson ' s plangent biography . Savage was not obscure at all ; he was the object of general London attention and was often the recipient of gifts from various patrons . Certainly he had enough money to keep rooms at Westminster while simultaneously renting what Holmes calls &quot; spacious lodgings &quot; in Richmond , outside London , so that he might be close to Alexander Pope as well as_to a rising generation of nature poets , of whom James Thomson was the most illustrious member . What was the source of these funds ? The truth seems to be that , through intermediaries , Savage had managed to extract blackmail money from Lady Macclesfield by promising to suppress a malicious and scandalous preface on her conduct . This is the man of whom Johnson wrote , &quot; For his Life , or for his Writings , none who could candidly consider his Fortune , will think an Apology either necessary or difficult. &quot; Then of course there is the little matter of the murder of which he was found guilty and for which he only narrowly escaped hanging ; it was the result of an affray in a whorehouse , according to Holmes rather than Johnson , where Savage behaved in a threatening and ultimately violent manner . After his pardon by the Queen , he found yet more of the notoriety for which he always sought , and in the process he managed to extort even more blackmail money from Lady Macclesfield ' s relatives . Nothing could save him from himself , however , and he died within the walls of a debtor ' s prison in Bristol . So what has happened to this dissipated and disreputable blackmailer ? He has vanished into the mists of time , to be replaced by the memorable and almost mythical figure who is at the center of one of the greatest literary biographies ever written in English . Yet Samuel Johnson ' s &quot; Life of Mr. Richard Savage , &quot; imaginative memorial as it is , is now perfectly complemented by Holme ' s own volume , which acts_as a Baedeker through the reeking purlieus of 18th Century Grub_Street , while at_the_same_time bringing fully to life two of the most complex and fascinating characters of English letters .</TEXT>
