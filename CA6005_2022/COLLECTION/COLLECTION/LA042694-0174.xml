   <HEADLINE> MARKET SCENE ; AT THE SOLE OF A FOOT-FASHION FAD ; THE UBIQUITOUS BOOTS OF DR . MARTENS HAVE SHOD EVERYONE FROM SKINHEADS TO THE DALAI LAMA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s an unlikely success story : a working man ' s boot turned_into an object of high_fashion . But that ' s the accomplishment of Dr. Martens shoes -- otherwise known by aficionados as &quot; DMs &quot; or &quot; Docs. &quot; Doc Martens first appeared on the international scene in the early 1960s , a high-topped jet-black or cherry-red pair of boots -- favored by bovver boys and skinheads in London ' s rough-hewn East End . Gradually , word of DMs spread , and the shoes moved_up the social scale . Bankers and policemen wore them , and so did Pope John Paul II , the Duke of Kent and the Dalai Lama . In the process , DMs have become a fashion icon , now sported by the_likes_of supermodel Naomi Campbell and pop stars Elton John , Pete Townshend and Madonna . Today , the original DM black boot has been joined by a cornucopia of 150 styles ranging from low-cut streetwear to steel-toed shoes to hiking boots , with 2 # 000 permutations of color and trim . But all DM ' s maintain the company ' s trademark , the carefully crafted sole affixed to the uppers by a special sealing process . Such has been the popularity of the shoe that about 225 # 000 pairs of DMs are produced weekly by the manufacturer , R . Griggs &amp; Co. , a family-owned firm in Northamptonshire , England . Published figures say the privately held company produces an estimated $ 30-million annual profit on $ 195 million in sales . And the low-profile father-and-son team behind the success , Max and Stephen Griggs , was recently listed in 80th place in the London Sunday Times compilation of Britain ' s richest 500 people . &quot; Dr. Martens shoes have become a standard , &quot; boasts Stephen , the managing director , calling his product &quot; the Volkswagen Beetle of the shoe world. &quot; &quot; I think our success nowadays is as much as anything the fact that it is so deeply ingrained in Britain ' s subconscious , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s a part of the fabric of the country almost. &quot; The company acquired Dr. Martens in 1959 . The original shoe was devised by a German doctor named Klaus Maertens who , while convalescing from a skiing accident in the Bavarian town of Seeshaupt , decided to make a comfortable shoe to relieve the pain of walking . Together with Herbert Funck , an engineer , Maertens designed a shoe with an air-cushioned sole , using old tires -- a revolutionary concept at the time . The sole was the special feature of the shoe . Where soles of most traditional men ' s footwear were stitched to the leather of the upper shoe , Maertens and Funck devised a method of heat-sealing the sole to the upper , creating a cavity , or air_cushion . The result was so effective that within two years Maertens and Funck had patented and developed the design commercially , and the air-cushioned shoes were sold throughout Germany -- chiefly as a &quot; comfort &quot; shoe for elderly women with foot trouble . By 1959 , the new shoes -- which had become know as &quot; Dr. Maertens &quot; -- were selling across Europe , and the owners were interested in finding a company to produce them in Britain . Hence an ad in the trade press that the Griggses spotted . The Griggs family had been involved in shoemaking since 1901 in the Northhamptonshire village of Wollaston , where shoes have been produced since the 17th Century . After World_War_II , the Griggs brothers in_charge at the time -- Bill , Ray and Colin -- found they faced tough competition from a dozen other shoe manufacturers in the Wollaston area -- as well as from new techniques developing elsewhere . The brothers persuaded the local companies to form a co-operative , the Wollaston Vulcanizing Co. , which was equipped with new molding machinery to make vulcanized soles for all_the cooperative ' s members . But the Griggs revolution really began in 1959 when Bill Griggs learned of Dr. Maertens ' desire to license production of his &quot; comfort &quot; shoe in the United Kingdom . Impressed by the strategy behind Wollaston Vulcanizing , the Germans offered the Griggses the rights . The Britons anglicized the name to Dr. Martens and called their own line &quot; AirWair. &quot; On April 1 , 1960 , the first pair of British Dr. Martens was produced in England . By the mid-1960s , Docs became an essential part of Britain ' s youth culture , and no respecting bovver or skinhead was properly dressed without a pair of eight-eyelet Doc Martens &quot; cherry-reds. &quot; However , the famous &quot; bovver boots &quot; -- the nickname came from their appeal_to East End toughs -- were also bought_in the thousands by workmen and women , sold , the Griggses say , on their sheer practicality . The company realized the popularity of its industrial footwear when managers detected a sudden surge in sales of boys ' shoes . The company discovered that women were buying boys ' sizes -- and quickly introduced Dr. Martens for women . DMs remained at the cusp of every trend from the punk look of the 1970s to the designer footwear of the 1980s and 1990s . Docs are featured in London ' s Victoria &amp; Albert Museum ' s permanent exhibition on 20th-Century style and culture . &quot; Dr. Marten shoes have been at the center of British youth culture for 30 years , &quot; says Max Griggs , the chairman . &quot; Now the rest of the world is catching_on , particularly in the past 10 years. &quot; Back in the 1960s , a fourth generation of Griggses , including Max , who is Bill ' s son , joined the company . Max , 55 , and Managing Director Stephen , 32 , represent the fourth and fifth generations of the Griggs family . The Griggs Group makes_up 23 subsidiary_companies that produce the 225 # 000 pairs of shoes a week . Wollaston Vulcanizing continues to make every Dr. Martens sole produced in the world . And quality_control necessitates five separate inspections . Is there a secret to DMs ? On a technical level , an official says : &quot; The unique Dr. Martens air-conditioned sole is a combination of honeycombed air compartments and soft cushion at the ball of the foot . It absorbs the shocks on rough or uneven surfaces , insulates the foot from the cold , and gently supports the foot -- making walking seem more like floating on air. &quot; But DM ' s have something else . &quot; Many people no longer see Dr. Martens as fashion , &quot; Stephen Griggs says . &quot; They are no longer the extreme thing to wear , but are becoming the standard by which other shoes are judged . They ' re good value for money , last well and look good . What ' s more they ' re quirky and sexy . I ' m sure Grandad would be amazed to know what he started. &quot;</TEXT>
