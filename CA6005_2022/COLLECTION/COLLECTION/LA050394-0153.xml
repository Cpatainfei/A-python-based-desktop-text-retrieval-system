   <HEADLINE> BRIEFCASE : AUTOMOBILES ; MAZDA , MITSUBISHI MODELS WIN COVETED APPROVAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two of Orange County ' s foreign-based auto_companies won coveted Consumer Reports recommendations for nine of their models in the magazine ' s annual April auto issue . The companies are Mazda , whose Mazda Motor of America Inc. unit is headquartered in Irvine , and Mitsubishi , whose Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America import and distribution arm is located in Cypress . The cars , by size and price range , are : Compacts under $ 20 # 000 : Mazda 626 and Mitsubishi Galant . Mid-sized over $ 25 # 000 : Mitsubishi Diamante and Mazda 929 . Wagons , all sizes : Mitsubishi Expo LRV ( also sold as the Eagle Summit ) and Mitsubishi Diamante . Sporty cars under $ 25 # 000 : Mazda Miata and Mazda MX-6 . Sporty cars over $ 25 # 000 : Mazda RX-7 . Another Mazda-badged vehicle , the Navajo , received a Consumer Reports recommendation in the sports utility class , but it isn ' t made by Mazda -- it ' s a two-door Ford Explorer with Mazda trim . In all , the magazine reviewed 194 cars , wagons , minivans and sports utility vehicles from 32 manufacturers in its April issue , and 44 of them won recommendations . Neither Suzuki , whose American Suzuki Motors Corp . is located in Brea , nor Hyundai , with U.S. headquarters in Fountain Valley , placed any of their cars on the Consumer Reports recommended list for 1994 . Kia Motors Corp . the newest foreign car_maker to launch sales under its own name in the United States , has set_up national headquarters in Irvine , but the Kia Sephia sedan was introduced too late to be included in the Consumer Reports review .</TEXT>
