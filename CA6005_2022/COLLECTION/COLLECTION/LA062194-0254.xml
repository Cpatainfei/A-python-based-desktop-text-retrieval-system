   <HEADLINE> U.N. CHIEF URGES OK FOR FRENCH FORCE IN RWANDA ; AFRICA : THE 2 # 000 TROOPS WOULD PROTECT CIVILIANS FROM BEING MASSACRED . THE SECURITY_COUNCIL IS EXPECTED TO GIVE AUTHORIZATION TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged the Security_Council on Monday to accept a French offer to send 2 # 000 troops into Rwanda in a dramatic attempt to halt the massacres of civilians that have sickened the world . Diplomatic sources said they expect the council to pass a resolution perhaps by the end of today authorizing the intervention . Although swift French action might embarrass U.S. officials , whose lack of enthusiasm has hampered the organization of a U.N. peacekeeping force in the last few weeks , U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright endorsed the_French proposal when it was presented to her by French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee . &quot; We are generally supportive of this humanitarian effort as a bridging operation ( until U.N. troops arrive ) because we are concerned about the killings , &quot; Albright told reporters . A U.S. official added that &quot; the_French ought to be congratulated , not questioned. &quot; Support from the secretary_general was not a surprise . He has condemned as a scandal the world community ' s seeming impotence to do anything about the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Rwandans in a civil_war . The slaughter began when the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi , both members of the Hutu tribe , died in a mysterious plane crash April 6 at Kigali ' s airport . The Hutu-controlled army and marauding , young Hutu extremists then began to slaughter members of the minority Tutsi tribe and moderate Hutus who wanted to share power with the Tutsis . In turn , the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front , dominated by Tutsis , has been accused of committing atrocities against Hutus as the Hutu army retreated into southern Rwanda . Much like the U.S.-led troops in the Persian_Gulf_War , the French-led force , while it would have the Security_Council ' s blessing , would not be a U.N. peacekeeping operation . Under the_French resolution , this special intervention force -- which would try to protect civilians and prevent massacres -- would operate only until the United Nations was ready to take_over the job . So far , only the Senegalese have offered to augment the_French force with an unannounced number of troops . News_reports from Paris said the_French probably would deploy 1 # 000 troops now stationed in Africa first , then would set_up a 1 # 000-troop unit on standby , ready to move_into Rwanda within 24 hours . In his letter , Boutros-Ghali said he probably would not have a 5 # 500-troop peacekeeping force -- as authorized by the Security_Council -- on the ground in Rwanda in less than three months . &quot; Meanwhile , &quot; he said , &quot; the situation in Rwanda has continued to deteriorate and the killings of innocent civilians has not been stopped . . . . &quot; In these circumstances , &quot; he went_on , &quot; the Security_Council may wish to consider the offer of the government of France to undertake , subject_to Security_Council authorization , a French-commanded multinational operation . . . to assure the security and protection of displaced persons and civilians at risk in Rwanda. &quot; But the Rwandan Patriotic Front has objected to any French intervention because of fears the troops would do little more_than defend the retreating Rwandan army . In the past , France was looked_on as a staunch supporter of the Rwandan government . Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni , who has close ties to the Patriotic Front , said the_French must convince the rebels that they are coming_to Rwanda only to protect civilians . &quot; If they come_in with soldiers to save the army from defeat , &quot; he told a lunch_meeting of the Corporate Council on Africa in Washington , &quot; this will be a big problem for the French. &quot; U.N. diplomats believe , however , that if the French-led intervention receives the approval of the Security_Council under a resolution pledging that the troops will halt the slaughter of civilians , the rebels will withdraw objections and decide not to harass the_French and Senegalese troops . Boutros-Ghali outlined the status of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in his letter to the Security_Council . Reporting that the United Nations has only 503 peacekeepers in Rwanda trying to cope_with the rescue of countless victims , Boutros-Ghali said he had received offers of infantry battalions from Ethiopia , Ghana , Senegal , Zambia and Zimbabwe and infantry companies from the Congo , Malawi , Mali and Nigeria . But all_the offers , save that of Ethiopia , were conditional -- the troops would not go_to Rwanda unless the United Nations could obtain equipment for them . Under the_French resolution , the French-led troops , unlike U.N. peacekeepers , would have the authority to use &quot; all necessary means &quot; to protect civilians and end massacres .</TEXT>
