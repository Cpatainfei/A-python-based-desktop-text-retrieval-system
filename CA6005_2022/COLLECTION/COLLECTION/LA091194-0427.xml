   <HEADLINE> THE CLUB GETS BIGGER ; ESCONDIDO ' S ARTS CENTER JOINS A NUMBER OF NEW SUBURBAN PERFORMANCE VENUES . IS IT A CULTURAL VISION OR JUST A GOOD INTENTION ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here the new buildings have that certain comforting California feel to them with their signature curls and curves , great sweeps and serene surfaces , one rising to a landmark 100 feet . Here is the latest of the brave , new cultural centers that , like weeds and wildflowers , pop_up in the most unexpected of places . Here is the California Center for the Arts , Escondido , designed by late architect Charles Moore of Santa Monica ' s Moore Ruble Yudell . The center has been 10 years in the planning and building and , when it opens Oct . 1 , there will be $ 74-million worth of buildings and programs , 12 gardens and an ambitious side-by-side enterprise involving performing and visual arts . New arts centers are opening this year in Escondido and Thousand Oaks . Last year Cerritos opened its $ 60-million Cerritos Center for the Arts . Two years ago , an 815-seat Performing Arts facility opened in Poway . Cal State Long_Beach has two new performing arts theaters . Something clearly is stirring in the &quot; hidden &quot; towns and valleys of America . What Escondido ( Hidden in Spanish ) is doing , miles from anybody ' s downtown except its own , may prove to be a cultural vision for the future or just another good intention turned fiscal folly . A 12-acre site in mid-town , a four-minute drive from where the I-5 and Interstate 78 intersect , will house a stately 1 # 532-seat concert_hall with no seat farther than 100 feet from the stage ; a 400-seat theater ; three art_galleries with 9 # 000 square_feet of exhibition space and another 8 # 000 square_feet of studios for visiting artists and students , plus a 9 # 000-square-foot conference_center . The center will have a $ 3-million first-year performance budget and $ 1-million visual arts budget , part of a $ 6-million annual operating_budget , at a time when many arts centers have turned_to renting their halls rather than booking whole seasons for them as Escondido is doing . In its ambitious inaugural eight-month season , the California Center has scheduled star names ranging from Cecilia Bartoli ( Oct . 2 ) to Itzhak Perlman ( March 5 ) , from Anna Deavere Smith ( Jan . 28 ) to the Kirov Orchestra ( Oct . 8 ) , Mel Torme ( March 22 ) and touring musical companies , a total of 73 performers or groups . The California Center for the Arts had its origins in the early ' 80s , when Escondido officials decided they needed to bring life into the downtown center . First they built a city_hall , completed in 1988 , next came the arts center . Surveys of the million-plus people in north San Diego county found a strong interest in arts and entertainment , especially for events closer than the 30-minute drive to San Diego , the hour drive to Costa Mesa or the two-hour ride to Los Angeles . * &quot; What we had to do was ' un-hide ' Escondido by building an arts center , &quot; says Steve Wolff , president of A.M.S. Planning and Research , a national arts management consulting_firm , called to Escondido over the past 10 years to advise on the city ' s downtown redevelopment . Oleg Lobanov , an arts administrator for 35 years , has spent the last three years in Escondido as president of the California Center . &quot; It ( the center ) will enhance the quality_of_life in this region . Overnight we will change the options of what 1 # 200 , 000 people can do culturally , &quot; he claims . &quot; While we will have thousands of square_feet devoted to what our business is , we have to start with quality_of_life because quality_of_life is directly linked to the arts . Besides offering performing arts events , the Center also plans to be a full-service , multipurpose campus . &quot; There is no place in this country where four buildings will come_on line at_the_same_time for the performing arts and the visual arts , and be philosophically tied to a community the way we will be , &quot; Lobanov says , pointing to partnership programs being developed with nearby colleges ( Cal State San Marcos , Palomar College ) along with public and private_schools in the region , master classes and artist-in-residence programs . Center people also envision &quot; curatorial programming , &quot; hoping to offer cross-disciplinary programs -- a series , for example , on Mexico , with Mexican sculpture and paintings in the galleries , a folklorica group in the concert_hall , a Latino drama company in the theater , a &quot; fiesta &quot; in the conference hall . From its start in the mid- ' 80s , the center has been planned as a public-private partnership . The city provided the land and helped finance the buildings through bond issues and development fees , saving the center from having to go_through the traditional wooing of patrons for its construction and start-up costs . A nonprofit private_corporation operates the complex with a $ 6-million annual budget , backed by a $ 500 # 000 interest-bearing fund from the city . Income from box_office and rentals is optimistically hoped to be about $ 4 million -- any deficit would have to be offset through interest on the reserve_fund and through private donations and fund-raising_efforts . Two years ago the center ' s development officials and volunteers raised $ 360 # 000 , last year $ 600 # 000 and this year the goal is $ 800 # 000 . Equally important , the center has what no other similar facility has , an attached conference_center where $ 900 # 000 in bookings -- 50 % of its first-year goal -- have already been made , Center officials say . T he art museum began as Feli cita Foundation , a group of Escondido residents who put_on community art exhibits in a 2 # 000-square-foot former city library . Now the California Center for the Arts Museum will occupy 9 # 000 square_feet of galleries linked to the performing arts halls along with an additional four artist studios , photography lab and video facility . Exhibitions are scheduled into 1996 , says Director Reesey Shaw , with &quot; Wildlife &quot; the inaugural exhibition , a show emphasizing the image of animals . Included are William Wegman ' s Polaroids and paintings by Donald Roller Wilson . The museum buildings open_to a sculpture court for temporary exhibits . A permanent on-site sculpture will be an installation by San Diego artist Mathieu Gregiore , a series of blue granite boulders , starting with rough textured rock near the adjacent parking facility and moving toward smoother , almost-finished boulders near the performing halls . Some doubters have scoffed at the center ' s demographic studies , questioning if there really is much citizen interest and support in the project . The use of tax moneys for art projects came under debate at several Council meetings . And one local resident claimed the city was losing its identity with the name change to the California , not Escondido , center for the arts . Construction snags caused opening dates to be moved several times from late 1993 to early 1994 and finally October of this year . Putting a spin on the delays , one center officer said it was better to delay until October since most performance seasons open in the fall . Last month center officials asked_for and got a 10-year , $ 1.5-million loan from the City_Council when its budget came_up short in buying such items as time_clocks and kitchen equipment . Just as the inaugural season was to be announced last spring , the center ' s first executive_vice_president , Neil Archer Roan , left -- causing a scramble to find a new &quot; artistic director. &quot; Before leaving for a post with the Oregon Bach Festival , Roan said he had carved out a &quot; killer season &quot; -- but one with almost no theater offerings . &quot; There ' s so_much competition in San Diego with the Old Globe , the San Diego Repertory and the La Jolla Playhouse , &quot; Roan had reasoned . &quot; We should explore , try to complement what they do , maybe bring_in some children ' s theater. &quot; But his replacement , Robert A . Freedman , who had been director of Portland ' s Center for the Performing Arts , has a different slant . &quot; I ' m leaning to use it ( the 400-seat theater ) more as a theatrical space , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s the right size for a smaller regional theater_company or a linkup by us with the La Jolla Playhouse for a second season or with other theatrical companies . The San Diego Symphony committed itself to traveling north for four concerts in the new hall and Freedman hopes others will do the same . &quot; It ' s all like a ' field of dreams , ' &quot; says Sarah Davies , West Coast booking_agent for ICM Artists , Ltd. , of the growth of new performing arts centers . Davies says that in many communities , &quot; local business people feel they have to congratulate themselves by having culture in their towns . So they build buildings with the belief that they ( audiences , businesses , investors ) will come. &quot; More_than buildings are needed , she says . A truer gauge of a community ' s commitment would be how much money is budgeted_for programming -- from its first year on , whether the facility will make its own programming commitments or just rent out space . &quot; There are halls all_over the West without buyers ( resident programmers ) any more or without any money to bring acts in . Independent promoters have to be found to do the booking , &quot; Davies says . With all_of its planning and building , its committees and support , could this new California Center for the Arts , Escondido , disappoint ? &quot; If we offered unimaginative programming we might be driven into the red , &quot; answers Center President Lobanov , &quot; or if we didn ' t think_of our linkage with the community , or of the quality of what we present , or if we try to do too many things too soon . Then we might fall and hurt ourselves financially . Now is the time to move slowly , especially because of the size of this place . We ' ve set our philosophy , our main diet . &quot; Now we must ask ourselves what will be here one year or two years and more from now. &quot; *</TEXT>
