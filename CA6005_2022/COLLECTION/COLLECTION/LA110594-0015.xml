   <HEADLINE> THE ANTI-SCIENCE MESSAGE IN THE MEDIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; has hit the video stores and , as a university research scientist and teacher , I feel it is appropriate to take a moment to point_out the violently anti-science and anti-scientist message of this ongoing mega-media event . Here we have a group of scientists who have learned to regenerate organisms from fragments of their chromosomes -- not even intact cells are required . What do these people choose to do with this amazing technology ? Do they want to cure cancer ? No . Do they want to grow organs or limbs to help victims of illness or war ? No . Do they want to develop disease-resistant wheat or corn that can be irrigated with seawater ? No . These people want to grow dinosaurs for a gigantic theme park . Am I the only person who thinks this is_sick ? But what we really have here is the same old anti-science anti-technology Hollywood theme . These are nothing more_than the old-time , classic &quot; mad scientists. &quot; Dr. Frankenstein would have been proud . I would like to ask Steven Spielberg and his colleagues to give us a break . Scientists develop the technology , but it is society that ultimately controls the applications . With the notable exception of the late Gene Roddenberry , Hollywood continues to treat scientists with fear and loathing while exploiting the wonders of technology for a cheap thrill . ALAN H .
