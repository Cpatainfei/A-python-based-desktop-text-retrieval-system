   <HEADLINE> AMID CONTROVERSY , ABC DISTRICT SHINES IN STATE TEST RESULTS ; EDUCATION : DESPITE WRANGLING AMONG TEACHERS , BOARD AND ADMINISTRATION , STUDENTS PLACED HIGHEST OVERALL IN SOUTHEAST AREA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The school_board feuds , the teachers and administration fuss , and the superintendent is_on the outs , but something has gone right in ABC Unified : The school district earned high marks on the state ' s new student achievement tests . Among the 18 Southeast-area school_systems , ABC Unified had_the_best or near-best scores in every category and at every grade level tested by the exam . The district also did better , on average , when compared with similar school_systems across the state . The test was given last spring for the first time , and the state released the results Wednesday . The California Learning Assessment System , CLAS for short , is California ' s latest attempt to measure how well students know what they really need to know . In part , the results reinforced what previous tests had concluded . ABC Unified and the tiny Lowell Joint School District , a Whittier-area elementary_school system , did_well , as they have_on more traditional standardized tests . The scores in Lynwood Unified and Compton Unified remained low . * Long_Beach Unified landed in the middle of the pack , a showing that Long_Beach school officials called respectable . Downey officials were puzzled_over results that were_better than expected in some areas and worse than anticipated in others . Students in the Whittier Union High_School District earned mid-range scores , and Paramount Unified had low scores , but students in both school_systems performed on a par with similar students elsewhere . For ABC Unified , the test scores offered a respite from headlines about district squabbling and labor strife . For two years , the administration and the teachers union have battled over salaries , class sizes and other issues . The district of 21 # 000 students serves Cerritos , Artesia , Hawaiian Gardens and parts of Lakewood and Norwalk . Employees called Supt . Larry L . Lucas autocratic and said morale was at an all-time low . District administrators accused teachers of making unreasonable demands , politicizing their classrooms and involving students in_labor disputes . Meanwhile , the divided school_board would bicker publicly for hours over issues large and small . And in the midst of it all , students took the new state test and did themselves proud . The results were particularly strong on the eighth-grade writing test , where 66 % of ABC Unified students scored 4 or better on the 6-point grading scale ; 5 % of the students earned a 6 , the top score . In Los Angeles County , only Beverly Hills Unified had a higher percentage of students with the top score . &quot; I ' m not surprised we did_well , &quot; said Deputy Supt . Ira Toibin . &quot; We had been working_on modifying our system in anticipation of the change . We began to work hard to change our curriculum. &quot; The new test &quot; requires a whole different approach in terms of writing and math. &quot; Traditional standardized tests had relied_on banks of multiple-choice questions . The new test used more open-ended questions , some of which required essay responses . Students had to write essay answers even to math questions . Unlike in past tests , students were allowed to use calculators . And some tasks required students to work together . Students in grades four , eight and 10 took tests in reading , writing and mathematics . The test measured students against rigorous statewide performance standards set by educators , school_board members , business_leaders and parents . * Virtually all Southeast school_systems had considerable room for improvement , particularly in mathematics , where scores were the worst . The 10th-grade math scores in ABC , for example , were among the best in the county , but only 19 % of ABC students demonstrated higher-level math skills by scoring a 4 or better . In Long_Beach Unified , only 7 % of 10th-graders scored a 4 or better in math , yet that was better than eight of the Southeast area ' s 12 high_school districts . &quot; We have learned that our emphasis needs to change to include more writing in mathematics , &quot; said Long_Beach Assistant Supt . Lew Prilliman . &quot; I am sure that ' s what pulled our scores down. &quot; Overall , Prilliman said , he was pleased by the scores in Long_Beach Unified , a district of 77 # 000 students . The scores were as good or slightly better than scores of similar students elsewhere in all but a_few categories . ABC Unified prepared_for the test by taking some teachers out of the classroom and assigning them to revise what would be taught in the classroom , officials said . &quot; The key now is not to tell students so_much up front , but to cause them , through exploration , to come_to a fuller understanding of what math is , &quot; Toibin said . In one second-grade class , for example , a group of students received a long sheet of cardboard . The teacher told students to stand the cardboard on its end and to cut three small circles . The holes had to be just large enough for a student to put his or her head through . And the circles had to be positioned so that each student could do this without stooping or stretching . To accomplish this task , the students had to hypothesize , measure , calculate , average and estimate . And they had to work together . &quot; They were doing very sophisticated kinds of math in that particular activity , &quot; Toibin said . Toibin credited Supt . Lucas with pushing this reform project forward . The school_board also deserved praise , he said , for approving funds for the effort during hard economic times that resulted in widespread budget_cuts . The school_board majority , which had been critical of Lucas , recently placed him on_leave for unspecified reasons . The superintendent ' s departure won ' t affect scores because the credit for the students ' performance belongs elsewhere , said Laura Rico , co-president of the teachers union . &quot; We have good teachers and good students , which is a wonderful combination , &quot; Rico said . The new tests reward good writing skills , and that ' s what put the Lowell Joint School District in the upper echelon , said Supt . Ronald T . Randolph . On the writing test , 72 % of the fourth-graders scored a 4 or better on the 6-point scale . For several years , teachers and administrators in the Whittier-area school_system of 2 # 839 students have concentrated_on improving student writing , Randolph said . Lowell Joint and ABC Unified serve student populations with many well-educated or affluent parents . As always , such districts scored higher than other school_systems . For that reason , school officials pay close attention to the scores of school districts considered similar to their own . The scores in Downey Unified , for example , were respectable , but somewhat worse than those in similar districts statewide . &quot; We did fine overall , &quot; said Downey Supt . Edward A . Sussman . &quot; Our math scores were low , and our writing scores were unusually high . The results are confusing for us because our math scores have always been above the national norm . And normally our writing scores are kind of average . I don ' t know what to make of it. &quot; Paramount Unified , on the other hand , came_in with scores among the lowest in the county , but results that compared favorably in several categories to similar school_systems . The Whittier Union High_School District , which received mid-range scores , can take solace in performing slightly better than comparable school districts in reading and writing . Officials credit the district ' s participation in the pilot-testing program that helped create the new tests . District administrators and teachers got a good_sense of what the test would be like and were able to prepare students , said Assistant Supt . Marina Anaya . The scores were discouraging just about any way you slice them in Compton Unified , a district of 27 # 300 students . The district ' s scores were at or near the bottom for Los Angeles County at every grade level and in every category . Some Compton schools held their own when compared with similar schools elsewhere , but the district overall fared poorly on average compared to other school_systems with a similar student population . &quot; You can ' t say the school district alone has let the kids down , &quot; said school_board member Amen Rahh . &quot; It ' s the whole atmosphere , the business people , the community members . It ' s that parent who doesn ' t even ask the kid : ' Do you have homework ? ' And the student who will listen to ( rap artist ) Snoop Doggy Dog rather than the teacher . &quot; But as an educator , if I know that students aren ' t getting help at_home , I have to compensate and find another way to get help to them . that ' s what the school district has to do. &quot; The district ' s new state-appointed administrator , J . Jerome Harris , vowed to improve the students ' scores by improving the performance of school district employees . On Tuesday , he and 17 staffers swooped down on Whaley Middle_School to analyze what the school was doing right and wrong . The other schools will get similar visits . &quot; I guarantee you this time next year we won ' t be_on the bottom , &quot; Harris said .
