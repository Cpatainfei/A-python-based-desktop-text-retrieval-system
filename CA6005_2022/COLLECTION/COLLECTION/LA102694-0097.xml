   <HEADLINE> PRO SOCCER LEAGUE ON HOLD ? ; FIFA MEETINGS : PLAY MIGHT BE DELAYED UNTIL 1996 , WHEN OLYMPIC TEAMS WILL BE IN THE NEWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Major_League Soccer , Alan Rothenberg ' s proposed first-division league that was supposed to begin operations in April , probably will be put_on hold for a year . The possibility that the league ' s debut might be postponed had been voiced in the past , but took_on added significance Tuesday when Rothenberg admitted a delay is being considered . That the U.S. Soccer Federation ' s president , who earned $ 7 million as chairman and chief_executive_officer of World Cup ' 94 , would make such a statement at a time when FIFA leaders are in town , suggests MLS will not get_off_the_ground April 15 as promised . &quot; Obviously , the later in the game it gets , the more you have to analyze whether to start in 1995 or 1996 , &quot; Rothenberg said , adding that there is a possibility the league kickoff will be delayed . &quot; I hope to be able to make an announcement within the next 10 days or two weeks , &quot; he said . According to the MLS business plan provided to prospective investors , the anticipated 12 teams already should have been announced , should have signed stadium contracts and should have been actively seeking coaches , players and fans . Instead , no official announcement has been made since June 15 , when charter franchises were awarded to Los Angeles , Boston , New York , New Jersey , San Jose , Washington , D.C. , and Columbus , Ohio . At the time , Rothenberg said five more would be awarded by September or thereabouts . But although it has several large investors and a television contract , the proposed league has not been able to generate enough financial investment to allow it to name any more franchises . It is believed to have scaled back from 12 teams to 10 and to be working to complete stadium contracts_in those 10 cities . Rothenberg would not discuss MLS financial affairs , saying only that legal_documents were being circulated for signature and that an announcement would be forthcoming . If MLS does delay until 1996 , it would mean trying to generate interest in a new venture during an Olympic year , when the public ' s sporting attention will be firmly focused_on the Atlanta Games . That could be either a hindrance or a help . Both men ' s and women ' s soccer will be a medal sport in 1996 and the U.S. teams will be receiving more attention than usual , so that could help MLS . But it is just as likely the league would have to go_into hiatus during the Games or risk vanishing from sight altogether . Olympic soccer was the main item of business for FIFA leaders on the first day of their scheduled three days of meetings in New York . The Olympic Committee of world soccer ' s governing body met for two hours in the afternoon to hear what amounted to a progress_report on plans for the men ' s and women ' s tournaments at the Atlanta Games . Earlier , key committee_members had spent six days touring Atlanta and each of the outlying sites where soccer will be played -- the Orange Bowl in Miami ; RFK Stadium in Washington , D.C. ; the Citrus Bowl in Orlando , Fla. ; Legion Field in Birmingham , Ala. , and Sanford Stadium in Athens , Ga . They came_away satisfied that soccer in 1996 will be as powerful a draw as it was in the 1984 Games , when attendance surpassed 1.4 million , the best of any Olympic sport . The only recommendations by FIFA were that Birmingham would have to replace its artificial surface with grass and that the hedges would have to be trimmed in Athens . Other_than those gardening notes , all seemed well . &quot; We ' re very far along in comparison to World Cup ' 94 , &quot; said Sandra Cress , Olympic competition director for soccer . &quot; It didn ' t even have its sites picked_at this point_in_time , so ( FIFA members ) were very impressed with the local preparation that ' s already under way. &quot; The men ' s and women ' s tournaments will be played as parallel competitions , featuring double-headers in many cases . Women ' s soccer , an Olympic sport for the first time , will be an eight-nation event . The United States , as the host , qualifies automatically . The seven other participants will be the top seven finishers in the second FIFA Women ' s World Championship in Sweden next June . The men ' s tournament will feature 16 countries -- five from Europe , three from Africa , three from North and Central_America and the Caribbean ( CONCACAF ) , including the United States ; two from South_America , two from Asia , and one to emerge from a playoff between Asia and Oceania . The European under-21 championship tournament , now in_progress and involving 43 nations , will provide the five teams from that continent . In other regions , qualifying play has yet to begin , although early favorite Brazil already has put_together its team and defeated Chile last week in Concepcion , Chile , 5-0 . If approved by FIFA ' s Executive Committee on Thursday , the Atlanta Games will be the first in which sudden_death will be used to settle tied games after the first round . There will be no fixed overtime_period and no use of penalty kicks as tiebreakers . Instead , the first goal scored in overtime will end the game . The so-called &quot; golden goal &quot; had been proposed by FIFA General Secretary Joseph ( Sepp ) Blatter after the Brazil-Italy World Cup_final at the Rose Bowl in July had to be decided by penalty kicks . As for television coverage , the fact that NBC does not have a cable affiliate such_as ABC ' s link with ESPN , means that soccer could suffer from little or no exposure , as was the case in 1984 when ABC ignored the sport . But Cress said organizers are working to make NBC programming executives more aware of soccer . &quot; Nationally , NBC already has got an extensive idea of what they plan to broadcast , &quot; she said . &quot; They go_with the big eight ( sports ) , it ' s pretty formulaic , but we ' re working very hard to try to get soccer on the program and in their minds . Certainly , ABC ' s ( rating ) numbers from the World Cup are a big help. &quot; Between now and 1996 , Cress said , work will continue to build interest in soccer in the five venues , especially the smaller cities . &quot; We have cities like Birmingham and Athens that have never hosted an international soccer match , &quot; she said . &quot; So we have to work with U.S. Soccer to sow some seeds and get ( the cities ) a little more educated in the sport and get their level of interest up. &quot; One way will be to have the U.S. national and / or Olympic teams play games in the Olympic cities , Cress said .</TEXT>
