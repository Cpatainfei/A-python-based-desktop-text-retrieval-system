   <HEADLINE> MANY FANS DON ' T THINK KERRIGAN ' S PERFORMANCE WAS MMM , MMM GOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mike Downey , Got some news for you , buddy . Nancy wasn ' t the best , didn ' t deserve the gold , and she sure as shooting ain ' t a good sport . Her program , though technically quite proficient , was bland , lacked depth , and , as the referee said later , didn ' t come from the heart like that of Oksana Baiul . It was about as exciting as one of her soup commercials . RICHARD SWAIN Los Angeles * Nancy Kerrigan should get_back on ice : She ' s beginning to spoil . BILL STEIN Cambria * I , for one , am glad Baiul kicked our Big Mac-eating , 90210-watching , cotton Docker-wearing , complacent , creatively bereft , poor loser butts . SCOTT LENZ Los Angeles * Nancy Kerrigan skated in the ice_rink called the American_Dream , Oksana Baiul skated in the ice_rink called the Olympic Ideal . Sorry , Mike Downey , but Nancy can ' t hold a blade to Oksana . So take_off your patriotic-colored glasses and just enjoy Oksana ' s skating . She ' s once in a lifetime . STEVE BROTEN Los Angeles * Once again , Americans like Mike Downey have proved what poor sports they are and , in the process , have belittled the brilliant performance of a 16-year-old . Nancy Kerrigan skated about as well as she could but lost by the slimmest of margins . Let ' s hope at the next Olympics that Michelle Kwan , who will be 17 , won ' t be treated by the foreign press in the same manner if she happens to win the gold . PETER F . JUNKER Los Angeles * If Nancy Kerrigan is second-rate , I wonder where those five judges put the rest of us . HUGH GLASGOW Cerritos * Nancy Kerrigan , America ' s golden girl revealed : Shannon Doherty with ice_skates . JAIME PAGLIA Sherman Oaks * Fortunately for Nancy , she is at least guaranteed millionaire status on her endorsements . Is this a great country or what ? WILLIAM BRADSHAW San Diego * It is a sad day when a newspaper has , as the big story of the day , two women who skated well , and a small story about the first American woman in history to win five gold medals . Am I reading a gossip tabloid or a quality newspaper ? ABSALAM VILLESCAS JR . Alhambra * America should be featuring winners , but Campbell ' s soup , Reebok and Disney play_up a loser . Bonnie Blair should be going_to Disneyland and be featured as a winner by American corporations . This country needs winners and losers as role_models for our youth . Bonnie Blair has worked to reach the top , and our corporations need to show our winners . CALVIN TAJIMA Altadena * How many Oregonians does_it take_to tie a shoelace ? RICHARD W . TOLBERT Anaheim * Let ' s all raise a glass to Tonya Harding for her super achievements both on and off the ice . She has truly achieved the triple klutz . JOHN D . ANDREWS * How come Tonya Harding got a second chance to skate because her shoelace broke ? The downhill skier did not get a second chance when his ski came_off at the start . Quincy Watts did not get a second chance when his shoe split in the middle of the 400 meters . Equipment problems are part of sport . I have had enough of Tonya ' s bully tactics . She might have been able to scare the USOC or the Olympic judges , but do you think she will be able to intimidate the guards at the Oregon State_Prison ? BRAD ELKINS Encino * Tonya Harding should forget about the gold medal . She should go_after an Oscar for best actress . She ' d win it , hands_down . LINDA MANNION West Covina * Between the USOC and the figure_skating judges , I am glad the O-Wimp-ics are over . DWIGHT CATES Ventura * Listen up , kids . Want to be in the 1998 Winter_Olympics ? Then follow these rules or conditions : 1 . You must come from a dysfunctional family . 2 . Your mother must have been divorced three or four times . 3 . You tried pot . 4 . Your sister or brother just died , providing you with new motivation . 5 . You are named Hideandseek or Kickthecan ( Picabo is taken ) . 6 . Your knee was recently torn to shreds , but through 18-hour days of rehabilitation , you make_it back to the slopes . 7 . Your parents must drive you 2 1 / 2 hours each way to the nearest ice_rink . Good_luck and see you in Nagano . RONALD COOPER La Crescenta * After seeing two weeks of Olympic previews , reviews and profiles , I ' m left wondering when CBS plans on televising the events .
