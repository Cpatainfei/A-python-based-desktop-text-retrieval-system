   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CLINTON DOGGED BY ISSUE HE INVOKED : CHARACTER ; PRESIDENCY : UNDERLYING WHITEWATER IS THE QUESTION OF VALUES THAT HE RAISED HIMSELF AS A CAMPAIGN SLOGAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Underlying the controversy over the legal_rights and wrongs of the Whitewater controversy that is swirling around the Clinton presidency is a more fundamental political struggle over character , values and the allegiance of the middle_class . President Clinton ' s supporters blame reckless journalists and sore-loser Republicans for much of the Whitewater furor . &quot; Republicans have lost some of their old reliable issues , &quot; such_as welfare and crime , says Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm . &quot; So in_order to slow the President down and stop the progress , they ' ve latched_on to Whitewater. &quot; But some analysts contend that Clinton brought the problem on himself by stressing traditional middle-class values during his campaign and his presidency even though the evidence suggests that he and First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have not always conformed_to those standards . The First_Lady recently felt compelled to address criticism of_her_own conduct in an unprecedented televised press_conference that lasted more_than an hour but nevertheless , critics maintain , left some questions unanswered . The Whitewater allegations -- that the Clintons enjoyed improper financial benefits from their investment in an Arkansas resort because of Clinton ' s position as governor -- are only part of the equation . Whitewater aside , last month brought a White_House admission that the Clintons had failed to report taxable profit on a commodities market deal . And the President continues to be dogged by reports that Arkansas state_troopers ferried him to assignations with women while he was governor . As a result , Clinton ' s presidency now presents an ironic and , some believe , ominous contrast . &quot; Clinton has probably suffered more from character issues than any modern President , &quot; says Everett Carll Ladd , director of the Roper Center for Public_Opinion Research . &quot; Yet it ' s hard to find a President who in his public utterances has pushed more of the buttons on character and values than he has. &quot; At nearly every opportunity , Clinton presents himself as the champion of middle-class people &quot; who play by the rules , &quot; a phrase right out of his pollster ' s lexicon . As a self-proclaimed &quot; different kind of Democrat , &quot; he frequently uses religious assemblages as forums , stresses religious themes and deplores how far national life has strayed from the influence of the Almighty . &quot; I think God wants us to sit_down and talk to one another and see what values we share and see how we can put them inside the millions and millions of Americans who are living_in chaos , &quot; Clinton told fellow Yale Law_School alumni last fall . Clemson University political_scientist Charles Dunn , editor of the anthology &quot; American Political Theology , &quot; says of Clinton : &quot; He may well be the greatest practitioner of civil religion and of public theology of any President we ' ve ever had. &quot; William J . Bennett , author of the best-selling &quot; The Book of Virtues &quot; and a potential Republican rival of Clinton ' s for the presidency in 1996 , says : &quot; He very much wants to be a leader in moral terms . He thinks_of the pantheon of great American presidents and wants to be in their company and knows that moral leadership is part of that . &quot; As he is drawn to it , he speaks_of it , &quot; Bennett says . And he warns : &quot; As he speaks_of it , he will be judged. &quot; On occasion Clinton seems to contradict himself with his own words . Feb . 3 , addressing inner-city junior_high_school students here , the President made a moving plea for sexual restraint and family values , stressing that sex is not &quot; sport &quot; but a &quot; solemn responsibility. &quot; But five days later , addressing auto workers in Shreveport , La. , Clinton recalled owning a pickup_truck that he carpeted with Astroturf in the bed . Amid laughter from the audience , Clinton added : &quot; You don ' t want to know why , but I did. &quot; Ten days after that he tried to explain away the prurient implication of that remark . &quot; I carried my luggage back there . It wasn ' t for what everybody thought it was for when I made the comment , I can tell you that. &quot; Clinton ' s supporters say that his frequently stated concern for values , far from being a cynical attempt to manipulate the electorate , reflects deeply held beliefs dating to his Southern Baptist childhood . Besides , they argue , nearly all_the complaints about Clinton ' s behavior stem from his years in Arkansas and are not relevant to his presidency . &quot; What we tried to do and what Clinton tried to do with us was articulate values which were the underpinning of a public agenda , &quot; says Al From , head of the Democratic Leadership Council , the centrist group that Clinton used as a springboard for his presidential candidacy . &quot; I think he ' s changed the agenda dramatically in the way he ' s conducted his office . I ' m not going_to talk_about his personal conduct. &quot; Clinton ' s critics contend that whether or not his professions about values are sincere , his failure to practice what he preaches undercuts his moral authority as chief_executive . And they contend that since he became President he has been notably evasive and lacking in candor in responses to allegations about his past behavior . &quot; In the long_run , this country is going_to find that it ' s in a lot of trouble because there are people in the White_House who are untrustworthy and unreliable , &quot; says Thomas Reeves , a historian at the University of Wisconsin at Parkside and a biographer of President John F . Kennedy . The controversy over character and values has taken_on significance that extends beyond its political effect on the Clinton presidency because Americans now seem more_than usually cynical about politics and anxious about the state of morality . &quot; Are you concerned about basic values -- what they are and whether we heed them ? &quot; retiring Supreme Court Justice Harry A . Blackmun recently asked a friend in a note published in the Washington Post . &quot; Are you concerned about your country . . . ? Are you concerned that many of those to whom we ought to be able to look_up appear now to have feet of clay ? &quot; Character , a measure of personal behavior and visceral inclinations , and values , the emotion-laden signposts of bedrock beliefs , had been steadily growing in importance in presidential politics well before Clinton . The expansion of presidential power , the intrusive reach of the mass media and the widespread belief that Watergate and Vietnam were rooted in defects in presidential mores have all contributed to this effect . Presidents and would-be presidents have benefited and suffered . Among the Democrats , Jimmy_Carter ' s &quot; born-again &quot; Christian values helped vault him from obscurity to the White_House . On the other hand , the presidential ambitions of Sens . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) , Joseph R . Biden Jr . ( D-Del. ) and former Sen . Gary Hart ( D-Colo. ) collapsed because of presumed flaws in their character and values . From Republican ranks , Ronald Reagan emerged as something of a values icon . The power of Reagan ' s appeal was recorded in 1985 by Democratic pollster Stanley B . Greenberg , now an influential Clinton adviser , in a landmark study of Michigan blue-collar workers who had switched to Reagan from the Democratic Party . Though they disagreed_with some of Reagan ' s policies , his new disciples admired the President as &quot; a John Wayne straight shooter &quot; who had &quot; the guts to stick_to his guns. &quot; George_Bush , although he lacked Reagan ' s personal_magnetism and strong convictions , was also able to score well in 1988 against Democratic nominee Michael S . Dukakis , then governor of Massachusetts , by taking_advantage of Dukakis ' dweebishness and the Democratic Party ' s reputation for permissiveness and protest . As Democrats took_stock of their party in the wake of their third successive presidential defeat , pollster Greenberg noted a significant contradiction . Though Americans had voted for the more conservative candidate , polling data showed strong voter sentiment for an activist government that would try to tackle the nation ' s intractable social problems . To tap into these liberal impulses , Greenberg argued in an article in American Prospect magazine , Democrats needed to win_back the middle-class voters who had defected to the GOP at the beginning of the Reagan era . &quot; The middle_class today perceives itself as ' squeezed ' between the rich and the poor , neither of whom play by the rules but seek their rewards through shortcuts and special claims -- tax_breaks , windfalls and welfare , &quot; Greenberg wrote . &quot; Middle-class consciousness deplores the lack of ' values ' today . . . , the failure to honor work and recognize limits. &quot; The Democratic Leadership Council , under Clinton and From , was thinking along the same lines . It designed its agenda , proclaimed in 1990 , to affirm support for &quot; the moral and cultural values that most Americans share. &quot; &quot; We wanted to make_it clear that Democrats believed_in those values , &quot; From explains . With this commitment as the foundation of his promises to revive the sagging economy , Clinton ' s presidential candidacy swiftly picked_up middle-class support . &quot; He found one line of argument which allowed him to both attack the Republicans as the party of greed and privilege and protect himself from claims that Democrats just give_away money to welfare cheats , &quot; says Johns Hopkins political_scientist Ben Ginsberg . When his candidacy was threatened early in the campaign by allegations of marital infidelity and draft avoidance , Clinton dismissed the charges as irrelevant to the substantive concerns of the country . &quot; The people whose character and patriotism is really an issue in this election are those who would divert the attention of the people , who destroy the reputations of their opponents and divide the country we love , &quot; he asserted . Once he appeared to have overcome these problems about his past behavior , he returned to his themes of character and values in highly personal terms . &quot; My life is a testament to the fact that the American_dream works . . . , &quot; he declared in one campaign speech . &quot; I got_to live_by the rules that work in America , and I wound_up here today running_for President of the United States of America. &quot; At the Democratic National Convention he accepted the nomination &quot; in the name of all those who do the work , pay the taxes , raise the kids and play by the rules , &quot; a phrase he used no fewer than 70 times in his first year as President . Now critics say that Clinton ' s rhetorical allegiance to values and character has been buried under the allegations of improper financial_gains from the Whitewater real_estate investment . Equally troublesome to the Clintons ' image , critics argue , is Hillary Clinton ' s $ 99 # 000 profit on her $ 1 # 000 investment in the commodities markets . Ginsberg of Johns Hopkins contends that her profit does not square with the President ' s regular denunciation during the campaign of &quot; cheating and cutting corners the way Republicans and their friends do. &quot; Democratic Chairman Wilhelm says that the full facts have yet to be divulged . When all is known , he says , &quot; I think people will balance whatever judgment they make against a career which she has spent fighting for the interests of children , reforming the education system of Arkansas and reforming the health_care system of this country. &quot; Looking ahead to 1996 , Republican strategist William Kristol says : &quot; If Clinton can convince people he is doing the right thing in health_care and other areas , I think that would outweigh a fair amount of character flaws . But to do that a President needs trust , because you can never prove your programs will work right away , and Clinton does not have anything like that trust. &quot; Whatever happens , his supporters see no end in_sight for this scrutiny . Predicts campaign strategist James Carville : &quot; If he is reelected , this will continue until Jan . 19 of the year 2001. &quot;</TEXT>
