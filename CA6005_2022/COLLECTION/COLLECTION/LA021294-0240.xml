   <HEADLINE> WOODLAND HILLS MAN INDICTED IN GIRL ' S KILLING ; CRIME : HOOMAN ASHKAN PANAH , 22 , COULD FACE DEATH_PENALTY IN THE ASSAULT AND SLAYING OF NICOLE PARKER , 8 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A grand_jury indicted a Woodland Hills man Thursday in the abduction , sexual_assault and slaying of 8-year-old Nicole Parker , whose body was discovered in the defendant ' s bedroom closet , sources close to the case said Friday . Hooman Ashkan Panah , 22 , who faces the death_penalty , will appear in Los Angeles Superior_Court for an arraignment Tuesday morning , when the indictment is scheduled to be unsealed , the sources said . The sources said Panah faces charges of murder during a kidnaping , murder during child molestation and murder during sodomy . If Panah is convicted on any of the three charges , punishment would be either life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death_penalty . Prosecutors presented evidence to the grand_jury for two days this week before the indictment was issued , according to the sources . Los Angeles Police Detective Joel Price , who headed the investigation , confirmed that he appeared before the panel , but he refused other comment . Nicole ' s nude body was found Nov . 21 stuffed in a suitcase that was hidden in Panah ' s bedroom closet . The body was found the day after she disappeared from the courtyard of the Ventura Boulevard apartment complex where both her father and Panah lived . Nicole had been choked , but a coroner ' s autopsy determined the child died from &quot; traumatic injuries. &quot; Until he is arraigned on the indictment , Panah remains accused in a criminal complaint of kidnaping , forced oral copulation , sodomy and murder . Panah was arrested Nov . 21 on those charges and entered not_guilty pleas . Panah recently hired a new attorney -- Robert Michael Sheahen of Century City , who is the third lawyer to work_on Panah ' s defense . Sheahen was not available for comment Friday . Panah made incriminating statements to police , court documents show . Furthermore , a female friend reported that Panah said he &quot; was involved in something real bad &quot; in_relation_to the missing girl and that there was a videotape that &quot; made him look real bad. &quot; In Panah ' s bedroom , investigators found camera equipment and tapes showing Panah having_sex with adult women . However , a tape showing Nicole -- if such a video does exist -- has never been found . As they were searching Panah ' s residence in the hopes of finding that videotape , police found Nicole ' s body about 36 hours after she disappeared . A judge previously ordered Panah to produce a saliva sample , suggesting that authorities hope to use DNA evidence to further link him to the killing .</TEXT>
