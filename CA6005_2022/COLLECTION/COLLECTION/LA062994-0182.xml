   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : WESTLAKE VILLAGE ; SENTENCING SET IN TAX_EVASION SCHEME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 33-year-old Westlake Village inventor who pleaded guilty in Ventura County Municipal Court to charges of state income_tax evasion is scheduled to be sentenced Aug . 5 . Blake R . Schwartzman , the co-inventor of the raised plastic ring that protects Swatch watches from scratching , failed to file state tax_returns on more_than $ 1 million from 1987 to 1989.He now faces back taxes , penalties and interest of more_than $ 200 # 000 and could be sentenced to up_to three years in prison , Jim Reber of the California Franchise_Tax Board said . In 1987 , Schwartzman created a company in Williamson County , Tex. , called Best Timing . He also registered to vote , opened several bank_accounts and obtained a driver ' s license in Texas , which has no state income_tax , Reber said . &quot; I can only suspect that he wanted to save $ 200 # 000 in taxes , &quot; Reber said . California authorities learned from a confidential informant earlier this year that Schwartzman never actually moved to Texas and had been living_in California all along . After checking Schwartzman ' s financial and utility records and other documents , authorities charged him with tax_evasion in March . &quot; This is an unusual case because of the lengths he went_through to deceive us , &quot; Reber said . &quot; We believed there was criminal intent. &quot; MIGUEL BUSTILLO</TEXT>
