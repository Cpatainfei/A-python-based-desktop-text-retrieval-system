   <HEADLINE> THE HEALTHY TRAVELER : ADVICE FOR BREATHING EASY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Before his patients with asthma embark_on any long-distance travel , Dr. Michael Kaplan has a suggestion : Check_in with him about their itinerary . Based on the patient ' s travel_plans , their health status and factors such_as the climate and the season at the destination , Kaplan gives them a game_plan . Sending_off patients with written instructions is now commonly done_by asthma specialists , says Kaplan , chief of allergy at Kaiser Permanente , Los Angeles . The game_plans are very specific , tailored to each patient . &quot; If patients have had severe asthma that requires corticosteroid medications , we provide them with emergency medicine with specific instructions on when and how to take it , &quot; says Kaplan , who is also a UCLA associate clinical professor of pediatrics . Patients who use a peak flow meter , an instrument to measure lung function , are advised to take it along on trips and , if the numbers fall below a certain point , to take specific medicines . An estimated 9 million to 12 million Americans have asthma , according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America , including at least 2.7 million children under age 18 . It is the most common chronic childhood disease , according to the foundation . A lung disease , asthma is marked by shortness of breath , coughing , wheezing and tightness in the chest , reversible by medications . During an acute attack , the muscles around the bronchial_tubes tighten . There is mucus production and swelling . But for both children and adults with asthma , traveling has become somewhat easier in recent years due_to a number of factors , Kaplan says . Newer medicines , including cromolyn sodium ( Intal , Tilade ) and corticosteroids such_as beclomethasone ( Vanceril , Beclovent ) work to stabilize the asthma , decreasing the number of acute attacks . There has been increased patient education and physician education about the condition and the need to treat symptoms promptly . The use of a nebulizer , a medicine delivery system , can help stabilize asthma in young children and can be very helpful in managing acute attacks , Kaplan says . Whether powered by electricity or battery , the system works like a kind of electronic air_compressor , making a mist out of liquid medicine . While nebulizers have been widely available for the past 10 years , their use has become more widespread in the past five , Kaplan finds . ( If taking a nebulizer overseas , Kaplan warns patients , be sure it will work_on European current. ) Even with these advances , however , certain patients are not candidates for long-distance travel . Patients whose asthma is interfering with normal daily activities should postpone travel , he says . Those with significant asthma , even if it is under_control , should not travel_to remote areas , where medical_care is not readily accessible , Kaplan added . Those who are cleared for travel should educate themselves before departure . &quot; Airplane travel is the hardest , &quot; Kaplan cautions his patients . &quot; It ' s not so_much the altitude as being in an enclosed space for a long period_of_time . It ' s often not well ventilated and the air is dry , which is not good for asthmatics. &quot; Asthmatics who also have problems with allergies ( about 50 % -75 % of children , fewer adults ) should take_into_account allergens prevalent at the destination , says Sarah Kaluzny-Petroff , a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Allergy &amp; Immunology . To find_out which allergens are_active at specific locations , call the academy to order its pollen calendar ( 800-822-2762 ) . Among other ways that those with asthma can ensure a more healthful trip , suggested by Kaplan , the American Academy of Allergy &amp; Immunology and the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America : * Get a nonsmoking hotel_room . * Bring your own pillow if possible . Or bring a dustproof cover . * Pack extra medicines and inhalers . * Get a list of the names ( generic and brand ) and doses of medicines taken . * Pack a portable air cleaner for smoky hotel_rooms if no-smoking rooms aren ' t available . * If traveling_by auto , try to eliminate mold and mildew from the car ' s ventilating and air conditioning system before departure . Travelers with other questions can call several toll-free telephone_lines for information and referrals : the American Academy of Allergy &amp; Immunology , ( 800 ) 822-2762 ; the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America , ( 800 ) 7-ASTHMA , and the Asthma &amp; Allergy Foundation of America Los Angeles chapter , ( 800 ) 624-0044 , 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays . The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month .</TEXT>
