   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE HEBRON MASSACRE ; DISARM THE SETTLERS ' GUN SQUADS ; THE PARAMILITARY GROUPS ARE ARMED TO THE TEETH AND FREELY TAKE THE LAW INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AGAINST PALESTINIANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The massacre on Friday of dozens of Palestinian worshipers by a Jewish settler urgently requires a strong and dramatic reaction . Condolences , apology and condemnation as expressed by Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin are not sufficient , nor are investigations . The Israeli government , which under international_law is responsible_for the safety of the 2 million Palestinians in the occupied territories , has no choice but to disarm the paramilitary units of Jewish settlers in the area . The slaughter at the Ibrahim Mosque in the West_Bank town of Hebron , a site holy to both Jews and Muslims as the Tomb of the Patriarchs , was an act of a religiously fanatical gunman . Baruch Goldstein was an American Jew who emigrated to Israel 11 years ago to follow Rabbi Meir Kahane , founder of the Jewish Defense League in New York and the radical Kach party in Israel . Before being murdered in 1990 by Muslim fundamentalists , Kahane had developed a small following that advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israel . The massacre perpetrated by Goldstein on Friday , however , is rooted in a larger psychological environment , created by the hatred , physical harassment and low regard shown by leaders of the settler movement to their Palestinian neighbors . The majority of the 130 # 000 Jews who live_in more_than 100 rural and urban communities in the West_Bank are peace-seeking and law-abiding citizens . Most of them are secular families who settled in the West_Bank for economic and social reasons . They were attracted by the cheap subsidized housing offered by right-wing Likud governments and by the desire for &quot; life quality. &quot; It is even assumed that most of the settlers are receptive to the peace talks between Israel and the PLO and ready to leave their homes if they are properly compensated . Nevertheless , they have been a silent majority , allowing themselves to be represented by leaders vociferously opposed to the peace negotiation . These leaders -- political organizers and their spiritual rabbis -- are mainly motivated by Jewish religious zealotry that very much resembles Iranian-based Muslim fundamentalism . A decade ago , these leaders inspired and encouraged the organization of secret cells . These cells , known as the &quot; Jewish underground , &quot; were involved in assassination attempts against Palestinian mayors , terrorist attacks on Muslim college_students and a conspiracy to blow_up mosques in Jerusalem . Eventually , even the Likud government could no longer turn_a_blind_eye on their deeds and plots , and in May , 1984 , ordered Israel ' s security services to crack_down on the Jewish underground . Members were arrested , charged and sentenced to jail by Israeli courts . But their leaders , the inciters , were untouched and remained free to continue with their agenda against the Palestinians . Instead of re-creating the underground , the settler leaders now concentrate_on organizing their supporters in paramilitary groups . The organization that Baruch Goldstein belonged_to is considered too extreme even in the eyes of most right-wing settlers . The real problem , however , is with the so-called mainstream settlers ' movement , which encourages the formation of these citizen armies . Their members serve in the Israeli defense forces as reservists and are armed to the teeth . Their weapons come from army stores and are to be used only for self-defense . They are also highly disciplined and ready to sacrifice their lives on the altar of the cause . Although they have no official warrant , they &quot; patrol &quot; the streets of Palestinian communities and the roads that connect them . And they do not hesitate to take the law into their hands , avenging the murders of Jewish settlers by storming houses in the middle of the night and killing Palestinians . Israel ' s security services , which have been so successful in tracking Palestinian terrorists , have done nothing to stop the Jewish paramilitary . Cabinet_ministers and military commanders believed that they could control and tame the settlers . Friday ' s tragedy demonstrates that pacifying terrorists is counterproductive and costly . The Israeli government has to dismantle the settlers ' paramilitary squads . Such a step will be supported by the majority of Israelis who wish to see the peace negotiation brought_to fruition . It may even be accepted by most settlers as politically inevitable . Providing security to all people , regardless their race or religion , is solely the responsibility of the government . It should not be in the hands of vigilantes who , because of the authorities ' past inaction , have come_to see themselves as being above the law . If the Israeli government does not act now and quickly the consequences will be dire . Not only the already delayed implementation of the Israeli-PLO peace accord will be jeopardized . The very nature of Israel as a free , lawful and democratic society will be threatened .</TEXT>
