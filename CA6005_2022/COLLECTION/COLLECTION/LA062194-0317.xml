   <HEADLINE> ETHNIC DISCORD ; SIKHS RESTORE SHRINE , MILITANCY ; RITUAL DAGGERS ARE TRADED FOR FINE-TIPPED PAINTBRUSHES AS ARTISANS PERCH ON RICKETY SCAFFOLDS WORKING_ON THE THRONE OF THE ALMIGHTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the dimly lit interior of a shrine sacred to the world ' s 18 million Sikhs , a trio of men wearing tightly bound turbans sit on a rickety wooden scaffold , their faces grazing the ornately sculpted ceiling . The rites of the faith require every Sikh male , all_of whom ritually take the name &quot; Singh , &quot; or lion , to carry a dagger . But these men helping restore the building called the Akal Takht , or Throne of the Almighty , wield only fine-tipped paintbrushes . With gentle delicacy and a precision worthy of an illustrated text on botany , they are turning the chamber ' s ceiling into a richly hued garden of flowers . It will take no less than year to finish the job in the room that measures only 10 feet by 10 feet . A decade ago , on June 5-6 , 1984 , the place where these artisans are now quietly at_work was a furious battleground as Indian army commandos and tanks assaulted the holiest shrine in Sikhdom , the Golden Temple , in this city 15 miles from the Pakistani border . At least 500 Sikhs and 83 Indian soldiers were killed as the army pounded and overran the fortified complex defended by fundamentalist leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his heavily armed followers . Their headquarters was the golden-domed Akal Takht , symbol and seat of Sikhism ' s temporal power and home to swords and other relics that belonged_to its gurus . From the building ' s basement , when his followers were slain or subdued , Indian soldiers carried_out the dead Bhindranwale ' s body . * For believers of what is often called the youngest of the world ' s great religions , the Indian army ' s assault , code-named &quot; Operation Blue_Star , &quot; was a heinous example of defilement . A decade has now gone_by , and most of the shell holes , bullet marks , broken marble and other wreckage left by the firefight have been repaired . Today , the Golden Temple complex , which its leaders claim suffered more_than $ 300 million in damage , is 90 % restored , said Gurbachan Singh , the assistant information officer at the site . In the rebuilding of the religious center at Amritsar , whose gleaming shrine stands_in a pool of greenish-brown water ( called amrit , or nectar , and believed to have healing properties ) , it is tempting to see an analogy in marble and gold_leaf for the reconciliation of Sikhs with India ' s authorities . Reality , though , is more complex . Removing his shoes to enter the Golden Temple , the barefoot visitor may ascend to the Central Sikh Museum , on the second floor by the northern gate . There , a visual cram course awaits in the events that form the Sikh consciousness . Room after room of oil_paintings graphically show how , over the centuries , those who followed the preachings of the 10 Sikh gurus , or teachers , were broken on the wheel , scalped , beheaded , burned with kerosene or on a griddle , boiled , crushed by trains and hanged or shot by the_British army and Indian police . For the typical Indian , Blue_Star remains an operation in which armed force was used to suppress a small band of Sikhs using the Golden Temple as a base from which to commit murder , torture and extortion and defy the government . In the eyes of many Sikhs , however , it was an outrage and modern update of a time-worn , tragic theme : the victimization of Sikhs by the majority . &quot; Under the calculated move of Prime_Minister of India Indira Gandhi , military troops stormed the Golden Temple with tanks , &quot; reads a notice under the Central Sikh Museum ' s lurid picture of the gutted , shell-pitted Akal Takht . &quot; The Sikhs , however , soon had their vengeance. &quot; Beant Singh and Satwant Singh , the assassins of Mrs . Gandhi , still have places of honor in the museum ' s portrait gallery . The Sikh bodyguards who , on Oct . 31 , 1984 , gunned_down the woman they were supposed to protect are remembered not as murderers , but avengers . A ruthless government campaign against militant Sikh separatism , which appears to be all but eradicated , has also kept suspicions and rancor smoldering . &quot; The Sikhs have started to feel that their traditions , the Sikh culture and way_of_life are in danger , &quot; asserted Manjit Singh , 42 , a thin , bespectacled professor who , since February , 1993 , has served as acting jathedar of the Akal Takht , or head of Sikhism . &quot; To suppress the active resistance and democratic political struggle of the Sikhs , the Delhi rulers have themselves become the oppressors and the terrorists. &quot; Though their faith glorifies the panth , or entire community of believers , Sikhs are much more divided than the acting jathedar ' s categorical statements imply . The finance_minister of the &quot; Delhi rulers &quot; is a Sikh , Manmohan Singh . The heads of Punjab ' s government and police are Sikhs , and the former belongs_to the same Congress-I Party that Indira Gandhi headed until her death . About two-thirds of the police and paramilitary officers in Punjab , the only state in India where Sikhs are in the majority , are Sikhs . Even the most ardent firebrand does not claim that Sikhs are inevitable victims . For though this group , whose name is derived from the Sanskrit word for disciples , constitutes less than 2 % of the Indian population , it is the country ' s most successful large minority . Sikhs drive taxis in New Delhi , hold commands in the Indian armed forces , till farms in Rajasthan and are engaged successfully in myriad trades and professions . If there is one characteristic they collectively possess , it is stubborn , even defiant , resilience . Their faith sprang_up five centuries ago under Nanak ( 1469-1539 ) , the first guru , and since then , they have been a minority in almost every regime they have lived under . Like the Jews , they have frequently been persecuted . But the restoration work now going_on at the Akal Takht is yet another emblem of their determination . Before Indian authorities handed the Golden Temple complex back to Sikh religious officials in 1986 , they carried_out extensive repairs_to the building . But that flew in the face of the Sikhs ' traditions of voluntary community service . So they demolished the Akal Takht again , leaving only a 10-foot-high base . Now , barefoot workers reconstructing the facade scamper over scaffolding made of saplings stripped of bark and lashed_together . Three-quarters of the work has been completed at an estimated cost of $ 7.7 million . About 165 pounds of gold have been used , as well as pearly white marble worth almost $ 3 million . The work_at the Akal Takht , whose foundation_stone was laid by another guru , Hargobind , in 1606 , will be finished in about 18 months . The central doctrine of Sikhism is that &quot; God is one , &quot; so it is fitting that it emerged as a synthesis of two faiths that antedated it on Indian soil . From Hinduism , Nanak took the doctrines of reincarnation and karma , or the idea that one ' s actions determine one ' s fate . From Islam came monotheism , as well as the abiding accent on brotherhood that rejected the Hindu caste_system . In its quintessence , Sikhism was summed_up by Nanak as working hard , remembering God and sharing with others . It was the 10th and last guru , Gobind Singh , who gave the Sikhs many of their distinctive characteristics . Before his assassination in 1708 , he announced the formation of a new martial order called the &quot; Khalsa , &quot; or &quot; pure ones. &quot; To distinguish members of the Khalsa , the guru ordered them not to cut their hair ( kes ) or their beards , to carry a comb ( kangha ) , to wear a steel bracelet ( kara ) and breeches ( kach ) and to carry a dagger ( kirpan ) . By these five &quot; k ' s , &quot; one can still identify an orthodox Sikh . The beards and colorful turbans the men wear to conceal hair they are supposed leave unshorn make the Sikhs one of the most visible of India ' s ethnic_groups . * During Partition in 1947 , which created India and Pakistan from British India and was preceded by savage Sikh-Muslim riots , the Sikhs opted overwhelmingly to become part of India . Many prominent Sikhs , such_as New Delhi author Khushwant Singh , believe that the choice made almost five decades ago has brought the Sikhs unparalleled prosperity and possibilities . &quot; It should be clear as daylight to every thinking Sikh that whatever his grievances against the Center -- and there are many which are legitimate -- their interests will be_best preserved as citizens of a secular India , &quot; Singh wrote last month . &quot; A separate state will spell disaster for the Sikhs. &quot; But given their turbulent history and vivid collective memories of martyrdom , it is not surprising that all Sikhs do not agree . In April , a half-dozen factions from the splintered Akali Dal party joined forces after caucusing at the Golden Temple and demanded that the Sikhs be granted a separate area in a new Indian &quot; confederation where they could &quot; enjoy the glow of freedom. &quot; Failing that , the coalition from the party that has long posed the most potent challenge to the Congress Party in Punjab said it reserved the right to struggle &quot; democratically &quot; for a Sikh state . The Amritsar Declaration was engineered and blessed by the acting jathedar and by the powerbroker who got him appointed , Gurcharan Singh Tohra , Bhindranwale ' s former mentor and head of an important committee that manages Sikh temples , or gurdwaras . But they and the motley collection of rival leaders from the Akali Dal could not persuade the influential head of another faction , former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal , who may today be Punjab ' s most popular politician , into joining them . Badal ' s more moderate agenda springs from longstanding Sikh grievances . For instance , he wants Punjab to exercise more control over its canals and irrigation waterways , the lifeblood of its agriculture . For the Badal camp , the pronouncements of the Jathedar are an ecclesiastical smoke_screen to veil the political ambitions of Tohra and the reunited Akali Dal leaders . &quot; A team of mad people &quot; was what Punjab ' s chief minister , Beant Singh , who coincidentally bears the same name as one of Indira Gandhi ' s killers , called the authors of the Amritsar Declaration . But he has political problems too . He came_to power as a result of heavily boycotted elections in February , 1992 , in which his Congress Party got virtually no votes from Punjab ' s 62 % Sikh majority . For many Sikhs , he is indissolubly linked with the brutal campaign waged by New Delhi against armed Sikh militants , in which many civilians have also died . Amarjit Singh , information officer at the Golden Temple , gives voice as well as anyone to the aspirations and dreams of his people these days . The witty man with the beard of an Old_Testament patriarch is worried about safeguarding his religion . India ' s Sikhs , he pointed_out , constitute a small , and perhaps vulnerable , island in a sea of far bigger faiths . &quot; After all , &quot; he says , &quot; India used to be a Buddhist country at one time long ago , and Buddhism also disappeared. &quot; He doesn ' t demand a separate land for the Sikhs but wants India ' s leaders to pay more attention to the wishes of a unique religious and ethnic minority . &quot; In a democracy , &quot; he asked , &quot; don ' t you think the elder brother should grant the wishes of a younger brother ? &quot;</TEXT>
