   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; CENTRAL ASIA ' S ' TEST-TUBE BABY ' ; THE WESTERN WORLD HAS SPENT $ 160 MILLION TO WEAN KYRGYZSTAN AWAY FROM ITS COMMUNIST-ERA ECONOMY . RESULTS ARE MIXED , AT BEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bleak and grandiose Soviet-era government buildings still dominate the icy center of this capital city , a mute , powerful warning to all who would try to break the grip of these temples of bureaucracy on the small Central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan . But it is precisely here that the International Monetary Fund , with the blessing of the United States , has tried to set_up a free-market showcase for the 50 million people in the five newly independent states that once constituted Soviet Central Asia . &quot; Kyrgyzstan is a test-tube_baby , but it had better be healthy . If hope of economic prosperity dies , war starts , &quot; said Metin Goker , the Turkish ambassador , a rare foreign envoy to what even in Soviet times was a small , remote republic of 5 million . So far , the Kyrgyz seem to have an abundance of hope . In a referendum Sunday , more_than 96 % of its citizens voted_in support of their president , 49-year-old Askar Akayev . The president ' s spokesman said Monday that voters had demanded &quot; a sharp radicalization of reforms , and they will follow. &quot; Though Kyrgyzstan is certifiably reform-minded , if its performance is the best that Central Asia can do_in practice , the mostly Muslim , mostly Turkic-speaking peoples of the wide steppes and high mountains between Russia and China had better tighten their belts for a long , hard haul to free-market prosperity . All five republics have used their own methods to keep new ideas at_bay as Moscow has cut subsidies and transfers , culminating in the collapse of the so-called &quot; ruble zone &quot; three months ago . Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have kept the lid on with repressive , unreformed governments . Turkmenistan has used natural_gas revenues to buy_off its population with free water , electricity and soon bread . Relatively liberal Kazakhstan has also benefited from huge oil and mineral wealth . But even the two regional giants , Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan , were forced to announce the progressive merging of their economies this month in an attempt to survive . Small Kyrgyzstan has said it will join them , and its experience may be a salutary lesson in the obstacles that lie_in Central Asia ' s path . Superficially , the Kyrgyz seemed to have a lot going_for them : a genial and progressive president , Akayev ; a smiling and open people ; and one of the better human_rights records in the former Soviet_Union . But past habits have proved hard to break , and the country has become something of a test of Western moral and financial fiber . &quot; Every quarter the IMF comes . Unfortunately , we are not good pupils , &quot; said Kyrgyz National_Bank Director Kemalbek Nanayev , speaking with the disarming frankness of his people . &quot; Privatization is slow . We have to support ineffective sectors . . . . We try to adopt IMF suggestions , but not all. &quot; Akayev , a convinced reformer , has no regrets about following IMF advice to launch the first currency in the region , the som . &quot; Time showed we were right . . . . We prevented an economic disaster . We are just a small country and we could have been carried_away in the storm of ruble inflation. &quot; But once Russia cut_off aid , the IMF had to step into the breach . So far , it has spent more_than $ 60 million supporting the Kyrgyz currency , and the United States added a grant of more_than $ 100 million . The bill is likely to go_on mounting . Landlocked Kyrgyzstan was almost completely dependent_on the Soviet system : 10 % of its gross_domestic_product was transferred as straight gifts from Moscow , and much of its industry collapsed along with the Soviet_Union . One day , Kyrgyzstan may produce 20 tons a year of gold , export farm products and perhaps hydroelectricity . But the country is so hard-pressed that a local prospectus currently lists such odd-sounding exports as frozen pancreases , nomad felt tents , antimony waste , hens ' dung and the droppings of silver mice . Some Kyrgyz have started to cross the bridge to a free-market system , as elsewhere in Central Asia . They trade from kiosks on street_corners or from blankets on the icy pavement , the economic cocoons from which free-market butterflies may one day emerge . But everywhere , the old Soviet-era bureaucrats have proved as unwilling as elsewhere in Central Asia to stand aside and abandon the practices of a lifetime . Many officials hold that the common_people are childlike and need to be guided . For instance , there is still no law allowing a firm to go bankrupt , however much money it loses . Kyrgyz collective_farms had a surplus of wool and tobacco last year . But it still languishes in warehouses because the bureaucracy has not given export licenses . Would-be private restaurants have been closed_down . As elsewhere in the former Soviet_Union , anything private is automatically perceived by many as &quot; the mafia. &quot; &quot; It ' s the old Soviet mentality that cannot see that private good can lead to public good , &quot; one Western diplomat said . Kyrgyz Deputy Foreign Minister Askar Aitmatov put it another way , saying the government &quot; would not permit the country to be ransacked. &quot; The question is , who is doing the ransacking ? The Kyrgyz National_Bank has auctioned_off more_than $ 50 million of its IMF dollars , but few of them have been easily available to private enterprises . On the streets , few doubt that those close to the bureaucrats have benefited . Monetary controls vital to maintaining the value of the new Kyrgyz som are under constant attack . Ministers and top bureaucrats believe that by providing long lines_of_credit to otherwise useless state factories they can avoid social unrest and jump-start the economy . The state enterprises ' budget is ballooning with soft credit . As a result , inflation is ticking back_up toward 40 % a month . The Kyrgyz som has halved in value against the dollar since May and a further steep fall seems inevitable . With the economy going_back to basics , farms will be vital . Peasants are getting relatively rich on earnings from private plots , including the increasing cultivation of cannabis and poppies . But the moment anybody tried to sell to all comers , officials slapped_on export tariffs . The &quot; state orders &quot; that defined centralized Soviet economic activity may have changed their name , but a plan to cut such compulsory production and purchases by 50 % on Kyrgyz state and collective_farms failed , said the acting minister of agriculture , Boris Talgarbekov . &quot; Under the guise of the national interest , the majority of administrators are going_to pursue the old , dead-end agricultural policy , which will bury the rural reforms , &quot; he wrote in a local newspaper . Managers were therefore unwilling to take free-market steps like investigating which crops are in_demand . Worst of all is the paradox that the public blames the collapse in its standard_of_living not on the bureaucrats but on the reforms . As Talgarbekov warned : &quot; People are coming_to hate the nonexistent market . . . a nostalgia for the command economy and the Communist regime has appeared. &quot;</TEXT>
