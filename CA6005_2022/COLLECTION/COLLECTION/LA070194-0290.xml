   <TEXT> Forget the Peter_Pan ride and the photo op with Snoopy . It ' s thrill time at many amusement_parks . Roller_coasters are back and the battle ' s on &quot; for the fastest highest scariest ride , &quot; says Susan Mosedale , spokeswoman for the International Assn . of Amusement_Parks and Attractions in Alexandria , Va . The thrills are also safe , or they would n ' t be amusement . &quot; It is scary , &quot; says UCLA student Andrea White , 23 , fresh from riding Six Flags Magic Mountain ' s Viper , which &quot; plastered &quot; her face to her head . &quot; But that ' s what makes you laugh -- because you know_nothing ' s going_to happen. &quot; Of course not . But when amusements have such names as Raptor , Vortex and Shock_Wave , and toss people upside-down at 60 m.p.h. , you might well ask if the fright isn ' t justified . The new rides mark the return of roller_coasters in a new high-tech incarnation . &quot; The golden_age of amusement_parks was in the ' 20s and ' 30s , &quot; says Ron Toomer , president of Arrow Dynamics in Clearfield , Utah , the country ' s leading ride manufacturer . There were 1 # 500 wood roller_coasters then , compared to 200 or 300 coasters of all kinds now in the United States , he says . The Depression took its toll , and postwar development took a lot of prime park land . In the ' 50s , Disney resuscitated the park concept with the theme park , which is not heavy on thrills . &quot; We were all going for clean , safe family entertainment , modeling ourselves after Disneyland , &quot; says Robin Innes , spokesman for Cedar Point amusement_park in Sandusky , Ohio . &quot; That meant a decline of interest in roller coasters. &quot; Not everyone prospered . Magic Mountain almost went_under trying to compete as a park themed with unattractive trolls . Thrill rides came_back with a roar and some new twists in the mid ' 70s . Magic Mountain has revived as Southern California ' s only thrill-ride park with nine roller_coasters and half_a_dozen water plunges . Cedar Point , almost razed in the ' 50s , built the largest ride park in the world -- 56 rides , 11 of them coasters . All coasters , new or old , follow the same principle : You take something up a hill and let gravity take it down . The pattern of descent today , however , given the flexibility of new tubular steel tracks gripped by multiple nylon wheels , provides twists and loops only dreamed of in the days of the Coney_Island woodie , which plunged down a series of smaller and smaller hills , interspersed with long curves and slow climbs . The new generation of design was born with Arrow Dynamics ' Corkscrew rides for Knott ' s and Cedar Point in 1975 and 1976 . Toomer describes these as &quot; a pulled-out spiral laying on its side , with two upside-down elements. &quot; Next came vertical loops with the track running inside , then suspended coasters with the seats hanging down below the track , then cobra rolls ( a loop with twists ) and boomerangs , then &quot; inverted &quot; loops with tracks running_around the outside . Magic Mountain ' s Viper has three vertical loops , a corkscrew and a double-barrel boomerang , turning riders upside-down seven times . They ' re fast -- up_to 70 m.p.h. They ' re also the shortest coaster rides ever , about two minutes , sometimes less . They have to rake_in the customers -- as_many as 2 # 000 riders an hour . After all , Toomer says , &quot; they cost a lot of money. &quot; And two minutes , he adds , is &quot; about all you can take. &quot; Actually , few people get sick on these thrillers , partly because &quot; it ' s over so quickly , &quot; says Jim Seay , Magic Mountain ' s engineering manager . The ride is smooth , given the bendable steel , the speed , the dynamics and the bucket_seats and over-the-shoulder restraints holding the body in place . Some riders find the new coasters less scary than the old . &quot; You ' re going forward so fast , you don ' t feel_like you ' re falling , &quot; says Lionel Johnson , 13 , of Los Angeles , on a visit to Magic Mountain . &quot; It ' s totally controlled , while the wood ones give you a sense of going_down a long drop , like you ' re on_your_own , &quot; says his friend , Nicholas Trikonis , 12 . Today ' s coaster aficionados -- and there are several national clubs of fans -- can describe the &quot; maximum Gs &quot; or gravity forces of a ride ( the pressure that pushes riders into their seats , usually while coming_out of a trough ) , or the &quot; zero Gs &quot; or weightlessness of another ( usually coming_off an apex ) . They have fine perceptions . They claim coasters run faster on hot days because their lubricants thin_out . &quot; You ' re talking_about small amounts_of_time , &quot; Seay says , &quot; but the transitions , as you go_into a curve , do feel different. &quot; What you needn ' t feel is unsafe . Over the two decades from 1973 through 1992 , 94 deaths on all rides , not just coasters , were reported to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , an average of fewer than five a year . Some accidents were problems of maintenance or operation -- poorly secured restraints , colliding cars , inattentive attendants . But others involved what CPSC project officer James DeMarco calls &quot; patron error , &quot; the unanticipated dangerous behavior of riders who were foolish or drunk . Consumers get some official protection . The CPSC has jurisdiction over mobile carnivals , its activity being more oversight than regular inspections , particularly in states that regulate carnivals . Fixed-site parks are under state jurisdiction , and only some states conduct inspections . The state of California does not inspect parks , but some local authorities do . Los Angeles County ' s Department of Public Works , Building and Safety division regularly inspects park rides and maintenance . Orange County , site of two major parks , Disneyland and Knott ' s , does not , leaving the industry to self-regulate . The big fixed-site parks do self-regulate , whether or not they have thrill rides , following , at a minimum , standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials and endorsed by their trade group , the International Assn . of Amusement_Parks and Attractions . They tend to do a lot more_than the minimum , not wanting any incidents to mar their records : &quot; The consequence of such negative publicity is the biggest insurance of all , &quot; says Knott ' s spokesman Bob Ochsner. &quot; Moreover , fixed-site coasters are increasingly high-tech installations , engineered like high-performance aircraft and operated by computers -- not just one , but often two that operate independently , Seay says -- &quot; but both run the ride , recognizing where the trains are at any given time , and what they ' re doing . If at any point they disagree , the ride goes_into shutdown , although the trains continue to a safe stopping point. &quot; * At Magic Mountain , Seay says , there ' s extensive self-inspection in addition to the county ' s inspection . Magic Mountain maintenance crews walk tracks before the park opens . If the track ' s unwalkable , they climb the structure at various points . Operations people take the first rides . Seat restraints are crucial , &quot; ensuring that the rider stays in the right position , &quot; Seay says . Padded steel tubing comes_down over the shoulders ; bars or belts cross the lap ; there are headrests and handholds . Who can ride is dictated by height , not age -- commonly a 48-inch minimum ( age 6 or 7 ) , 54 inches for more turbulent rides . Parks warn off pregnant women and people with back or heart problems . Smaller children are prohibited , Toomer says , not because they ' d fall_out , but &quot; because the orthopedic guys tell us they don ' t have the proper neck muscles to control their heads. &quot; There ' s also a size maximum on a per-case basis ; Earvin ( Magic ) Johnson was taken_off Cedar Point ' s Mine Ride because the lap bar couldn ' t close on him . A restraint has to be locked to work ; a latch must be secured . And trained personnel should be checking that they are before the ride starts . Accident reports show children have slipped out of restraints and jumped_off various rides , including roller_coasters . Parents should judge whether their children are mature enough to ride and be sure they understand the rules . Today ' s restraints may rein_in much rider misbehavior , but the fact is , &quot; if you tried hard enough , you could get_out , &quot; Innes says .</TEXT>
