   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; RAIN PUTS TRAFFIC ON THE SKIDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A sudden , brief downpour in South County early Thursday triggered several accidents and signaled the first showers of autumn , with temperatures remaining cool and crisp . The weekend forecast , however , calls_for warmer temperatures , with just a slight chance of rain Sunday night . &quot; This weekend there will be a little bit of a warm-up in most areas , from the mid-60s to the lower 70s . It will be mostly sunny , maybe a little breezy , with patchy fog near the coast , &quot; said Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. , which provides forecasts for The Times . Thursday ' s rain-related accidents occurred in San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente between 6 and 7:45 a.m. , according to the California Highway Patrol . Only one minor injury was reported . &quot; There was a flurry of rain and that usually stimulates people to crash because they don ' t slow_down , &quot; said CHP Officer Gary Alfonzo . &quot; They are usually driving too fast and they hydroplane and lose_control of the car. &quot; In Lake Forest , drizzle was reported at 1 a.m. and light rain_showers at about 3 a.m. , according to the El Toro Weather Center . Rain there tied_up commuter_traffic at the El Toro Y later in the morning . &quot; The showers were mainly due_to a cold_front passing rapidly through Southern California , &quot; Brack said . &quot; It was igniting isolated showers along and just behind it as it moved southward . It moved along pretty fast , in less than six hours. &quot; The cold_front brought colder-than-average temperatures . For instance , the temperatures for Santa Ana on Nov . 3 , 1993 , were 77 during the day and 53 at night . Thursday ' s high was only 67 and the low was also 53 . Winds were measured at about 15 to 25 m.p.h. , according to the National Weather Service . But by next week , forecasters expect another cold_front , which will cool temperatures . &quot; This was our first decent autumn storm brushing through the Southland . There is another one that may be coming_through late Sunday or Monday , &quot; said James Murakami , a staff_member in the UCLA department of atmospheric sciences . San Clemente lifeguard Richard Chew said Thursday ' s beach weather was windy , with the water temperature about 61 degrees , a drop from the summer ' s peak temperature of 81 degrees .
