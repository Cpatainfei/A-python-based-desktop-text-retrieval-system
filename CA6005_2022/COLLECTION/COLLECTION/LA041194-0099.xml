   <HEADLINE> 10 # 000 DIE IN RWANDA ; MANY FOREIGNERS ESCAPE ; AFRICA : BODIES ARE STREWN ALONG CAPITAL ' S STREETS IN THREE DAYS OF CARNAGE . BELGIANS APPEAR TRAPPED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With as_many as 10 # 000 dead in their blood-soaked capital , warring ethnic_groups in the Central African_nation of Rwanda resumed fighting following a brief cease-fire Sunday , as Americans and other foreigners arrived in the relative safety of neighboring Burundi after harrowing overland journeys and air evacuations . Three days of unabated violence took their toll on the Rwandan capital of Kigali , with fires burning on the outskirts , aid warehouses looted , doctors accusing soldiers of slaughtering patients in hospital_beds and sketchy reports of a massacre at a Roman_Catholic Franciscan mission . The commander of 400 Belgian troops assigned to a 2 # 500-member U.N. peacekeeping force said Sunday morning that the Rwandan Patriotic Front , dominated by members of the minority Tutsi , and the Rwandan army , dominated by the Hutus , had stopped shooting . &quot; At 10 o ' clock this morning there was a cease-fire , and it seems to be holding , &quot; said Col . Luc Marchal in an interview with Belgian television . &quot; The two sides agreed to a cease-fire . . . . There is a certain stabilization. &quot; Interviewed at 7:30 p.m. , however , he said the fighting had flared again . &quot; Expatriate ( Belgians ) are remaining in their homes , &quot; he said . &quot; Belgians are among the casualties , but ( in Kigali ) this seems to be more because they have been trapped in cross-fires by warring groups and not because they have been specifically attacked. &quot; The 1 # 500 Belgians in Rwanda are considered in the greatest danger among the foreign residents because Belgium was the nation ' s colonial power until 1962 . Philipp Boisserie , reporting for French television from Kigali , said fighting was continuing Sunday evening . &quot; They are still shooting , &quot; he said . &quot; We don ' t know where the shooting is coming from or whom they are shooting at. &quot; Rebel leader Theogene Rudasingwa said in remarks broadcast by a French television network that &quot; we have little option &quot; but to press southward toward Kigali from positions in the north . In addition , reports broadcast by Tanzanian radio and monitored by the_British Broadcasting Corp . said ethnic violence was erupting in Burundi . According to the radio report , Hutu residential_areas of Bujumbura , the capital , were attacked , prompting about 500 Burundians to flee the tense capital . The violence has flared in the wake of an airplane crash Wednesday that killed President Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and President Cyprian Ntayamira of Burundi , who were returning from a regional conference in Tanzania intended to halt the years of violence that have racked the rival Hutus and Tutsi . Both leaders were members of the Hutu tribe . Rwandan government officials said rocket fire brought_down the airplane as it approached the Kigali airport . While about 300 U.S. Marines , deployed from the amphibious_assault ship Peleliu in the Indian_Ocean near Somalia , stood_by in Bujumbura , troops from NATO allies in Western Europe took_up positions in Kigali to oversee the departure of the European and U.S. citizens . Belgium dispatched 600 paratroopers aboard a U.S. Air_Force C-5 Galaxy to reinforce the 400 Belgian troops who departed Saturday to evacuate their compatriots from Rwanda . The first of seven Belgian C-130 aircraft landed late Sunday afternoon in Kigali after having been prevented from landing Saturday by obstacles placed on the runways , apparently by Rwandan army_units . &quot; The atmosphere in Kigali has been completely anti-Belgian , &quot; Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said in Brussels . &quot; We recommended Belgians not try to leave by road , but to wait for aircraft. &quot; Many of Rwanda ' s majority Hutus believe that Belgian diplomatic efforts have favored their enemies , the Tutsi , since a peace agreement last August stopped fighting between the two ethnic_groups . Ten Belgian soldiers serving as U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda were killed Thursday , apparently by extremist Hutu members of the elite Presidential Guards . They had been attempting to protect the acting prime_minister , Agathe Uwilingiyimana , a Tutsi . Most other Westerners trapped in the initial fighting appeared to be safe by late Sunday evening . The French government reported Sunday evening that the majority of its 600 nationals had been evacuated , either to Bujumbura or to Bangui , in the Central_African_Republic . Among those arriving in the Burundian capital was the Mueller family of Kalamazoo , Mich . Scott Mueller , a Baptist missionary , said he , his wife and two children dashed three miles by car to the Kigali airport Sunday morning during a brief lull in the shooting . &quot; We passed about 20 bodies , &quot; he said . Cindy Mueller , his wife , said they huddled in fear in their house for three days . While they hid on the roof , she said , a mortar round landed in the back yard , killing the family dog . Before mustering the courage to flee , Julio Gamba , the World_Bank representative in Rwanda , and his wife , Amelia , said they spent four days under mattresses in their hallway . Bullets riddled their home , pieces of the ceiling had fallen , and windows were shattered . The Argentine couple arrived in Kenya after sundown . &quot; If there is such a thing as luck in this world , we ' ve got_it , &quot; Amelia Gamba said . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said Sunday morning that the 258 Americans in Rwanda -- about half of them diplomats and dependents , and the rest missionaries -- had been contacted by the U.S. Embassy and that &quot; all_of the Americans who wanted to leave Kigali have just now finally left. &quot; He said that some of the Americans were being flown from Burundi to Nairobi , the capital_of_Kenya , and that others had crossed overland into Zaire or Tanzania . &quot; It ' s an evacuation that ' s gone very well , &quot; he said , and only &quot; one or two &quot; had chosen to remain in Rwanda . Signs of the carnage and chaos of the previous three days were everywhere in Kigali . According to one report , drunken men with machetes , knives and grenades built roadblocks , and the Red_Cross was asking people to dig mass graves because more_than 1 # 000 bodies had piled_up at the central morgue . &quot; I don ' t find words -- the weather is nice , it ' s green , the lovely scenery , but you have all this violence in front of your eyes , &quot; Patrick Gasser , deputy head of the International Committee of the Red_Cross , told the Associated Press . &quot; And there is a smell to it . It ' s strong , penetrating. &quot; Eric Bertin , a coordinator for the medical charity Doctors Without Borders , was quoted by the Associated Press in Kigali as having said he and his colleagues arrived_at a hospital to find that patients they had treated had been killed by soldiers overnight . Some were in beds in tents set_up on hospital grounds . &quot; We have decided it is no use to work here anymore , &quot; he said . &quot; It is useless to cure someone who is going_to be killed anyway . They were just lying_in their tents dead. &quot; Elsewhere in the city , bodies were strewn about the streets -- the remnants of a horrific rampage in which citizens were shot or hacked to death . After escaping to Bujumbura , Canadian missionary Vernon Demille told Canadian Broadcasting Corp . that &quot; people were being pulled_out of our church and slaughtered out_in front of the church . We ' re seeing people running_for their lives , houses being grenaded , people being shot . Some of them are being butchered by machetes. &quot; The report of the massacre at the Franciscan order came from a spokesman for the Oxfam humanitarian group in Oxford , England . The spokesman , John Magrath , said three Oxfam workers -- from the United States , Britain and the_Netherlands -- saw Hutu forces enter the mission in Kigufi . &quot; They looted it , they flushed out all_the Tutsis who were there and killed them all , &quot; Magrath said . He said the three aid workers escaped across the border to Zaire . Gerstenzang reported in Washington and Marshall in Brussels . Researcher Isabelle Maelcamp also contributed to this story from Brussels .</TEXT>
