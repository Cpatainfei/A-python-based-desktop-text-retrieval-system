   <TEXT> A man involved in a lawsuit opened_fire in a court reporter ' s office Friday , killing a pregnant lawyer and a man giving a deposition before the 15-shot pistol jammed , police said . The shooting suspect was identified as Julio Mora . He was chased down and held for authorities by the owner of the court-reporting firm where the shooting occurred . Mora , whose 68th birthday was Friday , was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder for wounding a third_person . State law also allows murder_charges to be filed_in the death of a fetus , but prosecutors had not decided whether to do that , a police spokeswoman said . Police identified the victims as lawyer Karen Marx , 30 , of West Palm Beach , who was four months pregnant , and Clarence Rudolph , 56 . Maurice Hall , 44 , a lawyer and retired judge from West Palm Beach , was wounded in the abdomen . He was listed in critical condition after surgery at Broward General Hospital . The shooting occurred in a sixth-floor office where Rudolph was giving a deposition in a civil case that involved Mora , authorities said . Also in the office were the two lawyers -- Marx and Hall -- and a court reporter . &quot; Fifteen minutes into the deposition the gentleman pulled_out a gun , &quot; said Bret Tannenbaum , owner of Coastal Reporting Services . &quot; He fired six shots , two into each person . The gentleman ' s gun jammed . He ran_out . &quot; This was a pre-planned thing , &quot; Tannenbaum said . &quot; ( Mora ) said some pretty weird things yesterday. &quot; He refused to elaborate . Mora had filed a lawsuit against the American Assn . of Retired Persons over a senior job placement program . He was acting_as his own lawyer and had scheduled the deposition , police spokeswoman Sonya Friedman said . She said Mora had been laid_off from the association about a year ago . Rudolph ran the program at the time of Mora ' s employment . Tannenbaum said he heard six shots and went_after the gunman , thinking the gun was empty . &quot; The police told me later that the seventh shot had jammed and it was a 15-round automatic , &quot; he said . Tannenbaum said that Mora , who limps and uses a cane , tried to make_it to an elevator . But he said he chased Mora , knocked him down and held him . In the same building , divorce_lawyer Eric Golden was shot to death on Feb . 19 , 1987 , as he stepped off an elevator outside his sixth-floor office . A retiree was charged with killing Golden , who represented the man ' s ex-wife .</TEXT>
