   <HEADLINE> LAUGH_LINES : ASK NO MORE FOR WHOM THE QUARK QUACKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Today , the scientific community leaps for joy , dislodging thousands of pens and pencils from its collective vinyl pocket protector , sending countless pairs of black-framed glasses ( held together with duct tape ) skidding across laboratories around the world and then landing heavily on its Hush_Puppies and mismatched socks . Why the uncontrolled glee ? Quarks , of course . And not just any quark , mind you . We ' re talking Top_Quark here . The Big Enchilada . The Main Man . Scientists believe that they have discovered the missing piece of the puzzle -- that being the Top_Quark -- of how matter is formed . And I don ' t know about you , but I haven ' t slept a wink since the announcement . ( It ' s possible the neighbor ' s insane wolf-dog , which has been barking nonstop since mid-April , is a factor . But I don ' t think so . I think it ' s Top Quark. ) They found Top_Quark near Chicago . I ' m not sure if Michael Jordan had it or not , but he probably did . He has everything else . Except , as we ' ve all found_out recently , any real talent for baseball . But let us digress a moment . There are perhaps a_few nincompoops out there who don ' t know what a quark is . I hate to take time away from the rest of the class , but those of you who don ' t know -- and you know who you are ! -- pay_attention . A quark is a particle in the 12-piece chain that makes_up everything in nature . Trees , for example . And dirt . Even Al Gore is made_up of these particles , or quarks , although researchers believe he is composed mostly of DIQs ( Dead or Inactive Quarks ) . Until now , however , they couldn ' t find the 12th particle , the Top_Quark . But all that changed last week when it was found by hundreds of top physicists -- you know , the guys you made_fun of during gym class at your high_school , but who later extracted their revenge by getting secure , respectable , well-paying jobs and gorgeous second wives . Anyway , as one physicist explained , this is what they did : They discovered , through use of a particle_accelerator , a_few dozen lines , each a fraction of a millimeter long , which appeared scattered among trillions of records of atom disintegrations . Top_Quarks . For those of you who ponder somewhat less profound , although no less puzzling , questions ( such_as : Why the hell did kamikaze pilots wear helmets ? ) , this might get a bit complicated . This quark business involves explanations of the creation of life itself . Its complexity , indeed its very definition and identification , defies logical explanation . Unless , of course , we let University of Toronto physicist Pekka Sinervo take a whack at it : &quot; It looks_like a duck and quacks like a duck , so it probably is a duck. &quot; And , as physicists are so fond of saying , that is that . The discovery , however , is not without its doubters . Can any of us forget , for example , the great quark snafu of 1984 , in which Carlo Rubbia of Geneva nabbed the Nobel Prize for allegedly finding this same Top_Quark ? Three years later he was forced to withdraw the claim . Turns_out he didn ' t find the Top_Quark at all , but rather a sesame_seed from a McDonald ' s Happy Meal discarded carelessly -- and foolishly , I might add -- in the laboratory . And so , nonbelievers abound_in this latest Top_Quark thing . &quot; There are counter-indications to give one pause , &quot; said none other_than Pekka &quot; Duckman &quot; Sinervo . &quot; The working title is ' Evidence for a Top Quark. ' &quot; Wimps . I believe -- and I imagine I speak_for all_of us here -- that either it ' s the darn Top Quark or it isn ' t . No room for middle ground in something this big . Or , as my father has so often said , quark or get_off the pot .</TEXT>
