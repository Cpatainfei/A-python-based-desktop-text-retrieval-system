   <HEADLINE> DEBATE OVER RESURRECTION SURFACES IN A NEW BOOK ; EASTER : BIBLICAL SCHOLAR ' S NOVEL IS ONE OF SEVERAL RECENT WORKS THAT ATTEMPT TO TEST THE FAITH OF CHRISTIANS . MANY CLERGY WELCOME THE CONTROVERSY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Paul L . Maier , author and biblical scholar , recalls that as a boy he always wanted to know more_than the Sunday_school teacher was able to tell him . &quot; I remember years ago asking her what Pontius Pilate was doing on the Monday after Easter , &quot; he said . &quot; I recall her throwing_up her arms in dismay. &quot; Judging from a growing number of books like Maier ' s new novel , &quot; A Skeleton in God ' s Closet , &quot; more and more people are wondering about Jesus following that fateful Good_Friday crucifixion . The questions seem especially urgent as Christians the world over approach the commemoration of the central defining belief of their faith -- the Resurrection of Jesus_Christ three days after he was crucified on orders from the Roman governor Pilate . In Maier ' s fictional account , a team of archeologists working in the Holy_Land uncover what seems to be the bones of Jesus . The discovery not only shakes the Christian world to its foundation but has far-reaching political repercussions . &quot; Take_away Easter and the bodily Resurrection , and Christianity ' s doomed , &quot; a brilliant but devious archeologist , Shannon Jennings , declares in Maier ' s novel , which has become a bestseller in religious bookstores . Maier ' s work , of course , is not the first book -- fiction or otherwise -- to test the faith of believers . In 1966 , the &quot; Passover Plot &quot; by Hugh Schonfield argued that Jesus ' death and Resurrection were a fraud and clever conspiracy by zealous followers . Indeed , the Resurrection has been hotly disputed from Day One ( or Day Three ) . Even according to Biblical accounts ( John 20:25 ) , one of Jesus ' own disciples , Thomas , doubted the first reports of his master ' s Resurrection . But the debate , with notable exceptions , has more or less been out of earshot of rank-and-file churchgoers . No longer . The debates are coming_out of the closet and off the book presses as never before -- and many Christians for the first time are being confronted with potentially disturbing , perhaps even faith-shattering , scholarship and conjecture . Maier ' s novel fictionalized a crisis of faith when the world was told that Jesus ' bones had been found . &quot; It is a theological thriller to re-examine what you believe about the Easter event and re-evaluate the foundations of your faith , &quot; said Maier , a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo and a member of the conservative Lutheran_Church , Missouri Synod . * The book ' s plot , he said , was intended to be constructive -- to point_out that despite many new archeological findings Christianity ' s basic foundation remains sound . Increasingly , however , Christian doctrines have been called into question by scholarship that has drawn_on cultural_anthropology , non-canonical sources and an understanding of how early Christianity was torn from its Jewish roots and reinterpreted -- some say incorrectly -- by Greco-Roman culture . Much of this misunderstanding , it is argued by some , inevitably led to Christian dogmas that would have shocked Jesus -- the literal physical Resurrection of Jesus , the Holy_Trinity and the incarnation -- the idea that Jesus as God incarnate was both fully God and fully human . As these and other challenges become more widely known , will the Christian faith be hobbled as Maier ' s novel portends ? Thoughtful Christians on each end of the spectrum , from a biblical literalist to another who thinks the Christian Scriptures are_best viewed metaphorically , don ' t think so . The Rev . Jack Hayford , pastor of the Church on the Way in Van Nuys and a nationally recognized Pentecostal leader , dismisses non-orthodox findings as the work of a &quot; revisionistic mind-set. &quot; But suppose , Hayford said , that the long-lost &quot; Q &quot; document -- which New Testament scholars believe was a common source for the Gospels of Matthew and Luke -- was found . Suppose it reported that Jesus really didn ' t rise from the dead and the story of his miraculous Resurrection was fabricated by his followers . &quot; I think it probably would n ' t change anything even if they found that , &quot; Hayford said . &quot; But they ' re not going_to find that. &quot; Hayford said he doesn ' t bother himself , or his congregation , with such speculation . &quot; It ' s really not worth the time to deal with so transient an effort at undermining people ' s faith , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just not going_to succeed . All those battles have been fought already and won by Christian apologetics . . . . &quot; On the other end of the spectrum is John Hick , a professor of the philosophy of religion at the University of Birmingham in England whose latest book argues for interpreting the Christian Scriptures metaphorically instead of literally . In a telephone_interview , Hick said many believers have already reached an accommodation . &quot; I really think there ' s a lot of people in the pews that are much more intelligent and much more thoughtful than a lot of pastors give them credit for , &quot; Hick said . &quot; And although they will sing all_the traditional hymns and say all_the traditional things in the liturgy , a great many of them are conscious that this is not to be taken literally. &quot; * Still , he said , a fundamentalist reaction to non-traditional views may be expected . &quot; There will always be that . It ' s a question of how large a proportion of the Christian movement it is . It ' s always a minority , but in the ( U.S. ) in particular , it ' s a very powerful minority. &quot; When faith confronts speculation there can be convulsive reactions , as was the case in 1988 when many Christians , not all_of them fundamentalists , were offended by Martin Scorsese ' s &quot; The Last Temptation of Christ , &quot; an apocryphal motion_picture about Jesus , complete with_children , two successive wives , adultery and old_age . In the end , some pastors believe the controversy can strengthen rather than weaken one ' s faith , among them the Rev . Canon Lewis P . Bohler Jr. , for 32 years rector of Advent Episcopal Parish in Los Angeles . &quot; I myself would ask my people to go_through these things very well , and then I would give them an expansion . I would say , ' that ' s a point_of_view ' and say , ' Here is mine. ' I feel that ultimately this ( process ) will make a better something -- a better non-Christian or a better Christian , a better non-Jew or a better Jew , &quot; he said . The worst thing would be to dismiss the claims of scholarship as irrelevant or lacking credibility , as he suggested some fundamentalists might try to do . &quot; For the fundamentalists this denial will be just what they need for their members . . . . But I ' m sure late at night their members must ponder , ' Is it as cut and dry as my leaders said ? ' &quot; Since his novel was published , Maier said he has fielded a number of calls asking whether he had become an apostate or lost his faith . He hasn ' t . But he added , &quot; I cannot praise the sheltered or untried virtue . I think it ' s important that people see the counter-arguments to Christianity. &quot;</TEXT>
