   <HEADLINE> CIA OVERLOOKED RED FLAG FROM AMESES ' BANK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A suburban Virginia bank in which accused CIA spy Aldrich H . Ames allegedly stashed payments from the Russians notified the government of suspicious deposits in his account but federal_officials never acted_on the warnings , government sources said Friday . The notifications were_on file at the Internal Revenue Service after CIA security officials began having qualms about Ames ' wealth , but the CIA did not ask the IRS whether excessive deposits by Ames might have been reported , the sources said . The crucial information might have led to an earlier investigation of the Ameses . However , it failed to reach the CIA or the FBI , which conducts counterintelligence investigations -- and both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are trying to learn why . At least two currency reports on Ames and his wife , Rosario , were filed with the IRS by Dominion Bank of Virginia . The reports were made after the couple deposited cash sums_totaling tens of thousands of dollars in individual amounts below $ 10 # 000 -- the normal threshold for triggering such reports , the sources said . The bank reports are the latest warning to be made public that law_enforcement agencies apparently missed in their investigation of Ames , who is accused of spying for the Soviets and Russians for nine years . The reports are also perhaps the most clear-cut signal of suspicious behavior . Ames ' CIA superiors became suspicious after he paid $ 540 # 000 in cash for a house in 1989 . They also questioned him , using a polygraph machine , about his finances , but they reportedly never asked the IRS for bank reports . Ames said that he purchased the house with money he inherited from his father-in-law , which prosecutors said they have determined to be false . Other warning signs , previously reported , were the executions or disappearance of at least 10 foreign_agents cooperating with the CIA at a time when Ames held a high post in the CIA ' s Soviet-East European division . Although FBI and CIA officials refused to comment , other sources said that Virginia bank executives filed reports with the IRS in the late 1980s or early 1990s out of concern that Ames was &quot; structuring &quot; cash deposits to keep them under $ 10 # 000 apiece . One report , according to the sources , said that Ames had made deposits totaling $ 20 # 000 that included some Italian currency . Ames served in Rome from 1986 to 1989 . The CIA now believes he received large payments there from the Russians before returning to the Washington area . The federal law requiring currency reports , dating_back to 1970 , asks banks to report &quot; structuring &quot; as well as cash deposits of $ 10 # 000 or more . But congressional critics long have claimed that the process should be improved to increase the ability of law_enforcement agencies to make better use of them in criminal investigations . Although the law was designed in part as an early warning_signal of narcotics trafficking and money_laundering , critics said that the volume of reports is so great and the information so tightly held that its usefulness is reduced for agencies other_than the IRS . More_than 10 million currency reports are filed annually by banks , of which 75 # 000 are sorted_out as suspicious . &quot; Generally , after receiving a report of a suspicious transaction , the IRS distributes the data to its own criminal investigators but usually not to the FBI or the CIA , &quot; said Patrick Heck , a currency expert on the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee . &quot; However , it ' s all computerized , so if those agencies asked_for information by a person ' s name , they probably could get it. &quot; Heck added that &quot; most of the time this data is used to validate an agency ' s suspicion about a drug dealer or a money launderer but not to trigger an investigation , especially outside the IRS. &quot; Rep . J.J. Pickle ( D-Tex. ) , chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on oversight , said that he has asked IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson for a report on what actions , if any , the agency has taken_in response to the Ameses ' spending habits and their deposits of large sums of cash . In a letter to Richardson , Pickle listed a number of activities and said : &quot; Which of these transactions were reportable ? &quot; Prosecutors said in court papers that by the late 1980s , the couple had paid_cash for their house in Northern Virginia and made $ 99 # 000 in home improvements . They later purchased a 1992 Jaguar , although their reported family income was only Ames ' $ 69 # 000 annual salary from the CIA . The FBI did not begin investigating Ames until May 12 , 1993 . After the couple ' s arrest last month on charges of conspiring to commit espionage , FBI Supervising Agent Leslie G . Wiser Jr . filed an affidavit detailing dozens of their cash deposits . In a five-week period in 1992 , for example , the couple deposited $ 58 # 500 in eight transactions , ranging from $ 1 # 700 to $ 8 # 500 , he said . Prosecutors claim that the deposits followed Ames ' return from a secret meeting with Russian handlers in Caracas , Venezuela , in October , 1992 . In all , the Ameses are accused of receiving $ 2.5 million in espionage payments from 1985 to 1994 . An official of First Union Bank of Virginia , which acquired Dominion Bank a year ago , said he could not comment on whether Dominion filed currency reports on the Ameses . &quot; I have no information about activities of the prior management , &quot; said the official , Dave Scanzoni . &quot; And even if I did , I could not reveal them as part of an ongoing federal investigation. &quot; Scanzoni said it is not uncommon , however , for banks to alert the IRS to suspicious cash deposits totaling tens of thousands of dollars , even when individual deposits are less than $ 10 # 000 .
