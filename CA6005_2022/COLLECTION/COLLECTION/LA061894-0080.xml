   <HEADLINE> IN MAJOR SHIFT , BAPTIST GROUP BACKS DIALOGUE WITH CATHOLICS ; ECUMENISM : THE CONVENTION DECLARATION ACKNOWLEDGES SERIOUS THEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BUT AFFIRMS SHARED BELIEF IN MAJOR TENETS OF FAITH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern Baptists and Roman_Catholics can be more_than political soul_mates , the nation ' s largest Protestant_denomination has declared . In a major step toward ecumenism , the Southern Baptist Convention said Thursday that &quot; born-again &quot; believers may be found in all Christian denominations , and endorsed Baptist-Catholic dialogue . &quot; We live_in a land where there is a demonic onslaught against the forces of decency and righteousness , and we need to stand with good people together , &quot; Timothy George , dean of Beesom Divinity School in Montgomery , Ala. , told the convention on the final day of its 137th annual meeting . The declaration overwhelmingly approved by about 7 # 500 convention delegates places no limits on the freedom of Baptists to persuade other Christians to switch churches . It also acknowledges serious theological differences with Catholics on such issues as papal infallibility and the relation between the Bible and church tradition . Set against the historical enmity between the nation ' s two largest religious groups , the formal declaration of the desire for dialogue was seen as historically significant . &quot; It certainly is a major step to consider whether members of other churches really are part of the Body of Christ , &quot; said Father Frank Ruff of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops . Baptists and Catholics have had informal discussions since 1971 , beginning with informal regional dialogues and progressing_to national conversations between Catholic and Baptist scholars . This year , participants in a Catholic-Baptist dialogue jointly sponsored by the Baptist Home Mission Board and the bishops conference published pamphlets offering biblical reflections on social issues , including the environment and racism . What brought the discussion into the forefront this year was a widely publicized appeal for closer relations signed by conservative Catholic leaders and prominent evangelicals , including Pat Robertson , Charles Colson and the heads of both the Home Mission Board and the Christian Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention . &quot; As evangelicals and Catholics , we dare not by needless and loveless conflict between ourselves give aid and comfort to the enemies of Christ , &quot; said the declaration .</TEXT>
