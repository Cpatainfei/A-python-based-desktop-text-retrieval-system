   <HEADLINE> VENTURA MOTHER PLEADS GUILTY TO CHILD STEALING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Ventura mother of two who fled to Sri Lanka rather than give_up her children pleaded guilty to four felonies on Thursday , but will likely avoid prison . Niki Lynn Ruberoe , 33 , on Thursday admitted to charges of child stealing , violating a custody agreement , conspiracy and aiding and abetting failure to appear in court . She could have received eight years in state_prison for her crimes but agreed to the plea on the condition she receive probation . Sentencing is scheduled for Feb . 18 . Ruberoe was granted temporary custody of her two children last summer . But when her husband , the children ' s stepfather , was convicted of multiple counts of child molestation , she chose to take the children out of the country rather than return them to their biological father , Ruberoe ' s ex-husband . Ruberoe admitted taking the children , ages 10 and 13 , to France and then arranging for them to meet her husband , Channa Ruberoe , in Sri Lanka , where he is a citizen . Niki Ruberoe was returned to Ventura County last month , but authorities are still attempting to bring_back her husband , who is fighting extradition because he still faces sentencing on the molestation charges and would probably face additional penalties for failing to appear in court . Defense_attorney Steve P . Pell on Thursday called the plea bargain reasonable . &quot; She doesn ' t belong in prison , &quot; said Pell , who added that his client would be filing for divorce from her husband soon .</TEXT>
