   <HEADLINE> SOME CANOLA GROWERS FLOUT EPA PESTICIDE RULE ; AGRICULTURE : AN INSECT THAT PLAGUES THE LUCRATIVE CROP IS EATING INTO PROFITS . A CHEMICAL THAT KILLS THE PEST IS BANNED , BUT NOT FOR CROPS THAT WILL BE EXPORTED . THAT LOOPHOLE GETS STRETCHED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Canola , farmers say , is a Cinderella crop -- the sudden demand is so high that they can sell as much of it as they can grow . Cinderella crops come_along as often as lovelorn princes . And in their scramble to fit the glass slipper , some in the U.S. canola industry -- farmers , buyers and processors -- are defying federal laws . The Environmental Protection Agency has yet to approve pesticides to fight an insect that plagues canola . When U.S. producers are allowed to use unregistered pesticides , the law requires that their crops be exported . So some farmers truck their canola across the Canadian border and then back to U.S. processing plants . In other cases , buyers have created documents to show canola is exported when , in fact , it never leaves the country . The reason is simple : Canola , an oil made by crushing the seeds of a variety of rapeseed , is a hot commodity . Canola oil is lower in saturated fat than all other vegetable_oils , roughly 6 % compared to 13 % for corn_oil . It also is high in mono-unsaturated fat , which helps the body eliminate fatty deposits , and recently was touted as a healthy way to reduce cholesterol in movie popcorn . In addition , leftover canola meal is used for livestock rations . Its roots improve the quality of the soil , and wheat farmers can diversify by adding canola to their crop rotation without investing in costly equipment . The bottom_line : In Canada , which dominates canola production worldwide , prices have increased by 40 % since last fall . For U.S. growers , the fly_in_the_ointment is the flea_beetle , a voracious pest that flourishes under the same cool , moist conditions favored by canola . &quot; These insects feed so rapidly that , in the course of several hours , a crop can be completely eaten down , &quot; said Jim Gray , crop protection manager for Intermountain Canola Co . of Idaho Falls , Ida . The solution is a pesticide known as carbofuran , which is planted in granular form along with the seed . The problem with the solution is that although the EPA allows farmers to use liquid carbofuran on crops ranging from alfalfa to grapes , it prohibits use of the granular version for most crops . When planting equipment is raised at the end of a row , a_few particles of seed and pesticide dribble out on the surface of the soil , Gray said . Carbofuran-coated granules attract birds , who need sand or grit to digest their food . The chemical kills birds , though there is no evidence that it harms humans . Linda Lyon , a researcher for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , says carbofuran is one of the most toxic agricultural pesticides in_use , and one of the most studied . &quot; What we ' ve found is that even when it ' s applied in-furrow , at a low application rate with state-of-the-art equipment , we ' ve had bird kills. &quot; Some researchers disagree , and Gray is among the canola growers and processors lobbying the EPA to approve the carbofuran for use on canola . Without it , he contends , the crop cannot survive . In Canada , carbofuran granules have been used for years , though the Canadian Wildlife Service is considering restrictions . It is illegal to import canola that has been grown with carbofuran into the United States , but the federal Food and Drug Administration monitors just 1 % of all imported commodities . John Jones of the agency ' s Center for Food Safety said there are no plans to expand those inspections . &quot; Canadian canola , treated with the same pesticides , is coming_down here anyway , &quot; said Cavalier County , N.D. , extension_agent Ron Beneda . &quot; It ' s the law . But it doesn ' t make any common sense. &quot; North_Dakota , Minnesota and Montana growers have EPA approval to use carbofuran on the canola they produce for export -- and they do . But Bill Mickelson , who farms near the border at Rolla , N.D. , said , &quot; The canola we raised last year never went_to Canada. &quot; Mickelson had a contract for his crop with Northern Sales of Winnipeg , Manitoba , which arranged for him to deliver it to a local elevator . &quot; When they trucked it out , I knew it was going_to Fargo , &quot; Mickelson said . Glenn Malkoske , a canola contractor for Northern Sales , denies that happened . But Gray said it happens all_the time . Buyers &quot; create a paper trail that says the crop is exported , not wanting to go_to the expense of shipping it to Canada and turning_around and delivering it to a U.S. crusher , &quot; he said . That makes the crushers uncomfortable , he said , because they don ' t know if a shipment is legal or not , &quot; and it ' s real uncomfortable for the growers. &quot; What really upsets farmers , though , is that canola could be an enormous crop in the United States -- if carbofuran were allowed . Mike Weiss , a researcher at North_Dakota State University , said domestic consumption of canola is 1 billion pounds annually . He estimates it would take 2.5 million acres to meet that need , roughly 13 times last year ' s production . North_Dakota led U.S. production with 47 # 000 acres of canola in 1993 . &quot; Procter &amp; Gamble would buy that much in one month , &quot; Weiss said .</TEXT>
