   <TEXT> If they had built CityWalk to look_like Rome , or a corny version of the Champs Elysees , it might never have caused such a fuss . * But this elaborate strip of shops and restaurants atop Universal City evokes a locale much closer to home . With its jumbled neon and audacious storefronts , with a giant video screen looming over an artificial beach , CityWalk offers a version of the very city in which it resides . And that is what started the fire , all_the hype and criticism . A few enthusiastic comments from within the MCA Development Co . -- colored by the city ' s growing concerns over crime and decay -- gave_birth to an image of CityWalk as an abracadabra solution to Los Angeles ' woes . &quot; Idealized reality , &quot; MCA President Lawrence Spungin called his tightly planned and controlled complex that sought to act like a new brand of town square . Hollywood Boulevard with a child-proof cap . A sanitized Venice Beach for a populace grown weary of looking over its shoulder . The critics howled . Never mind that a thoroughly contrived &quot; boulevard &quot; seemed Orwellian . CityWalk faced graver charges . It smacked of an elitist enclave , with its private guards shuttling panhandlers and suspected gang members off the premises , the critics said . It offered a tempting placebo at a time when people should be working to revive the real city . These perceptions ignited such ire that Kevin Starr , a USC professor and local historian , was moved to announce : &quot; This sounds like the end of L.A. history. &quot; A year has passed since CityWalk ' s cacophonous debut , and still the debate smolders , if less publicly . So excuse the complex ' s chief project designer , Richard Orne , if he sounds a touch wary when recalling the past 12 months . &quot; The notion of CityWalk being a new Los Angeles was an unfortunate bent , &quot; said Orne , an associate at the Jerde Partnership , the private firm that served as principal architect . &quot; But there has also been a fearful overreaction -- ' Oh my God , this is &quot; 1984 , &quot; and private_corporations are going_to build fantasy versions of cities and manipulate the population. ' &quot; CityWalk has become , &quot; he says , &quot; a lightning_rod for a lot of emotional reaction. &quot; &quot; Perhaps there are no longer real occasions for social congregation in the square . The larger transactions of business occur at a distance by ' communication , ' not face to face . Politics is by press , radio , and ballot . Social pleasure is housed in theaters and dance_halls . If this is so , it is a grievous and irreparable loss . There is no substitute for the spontaneous social conflux whose atoms unite , precisely , as citizens of the city. &quot; -- from Communitas , by Percival and Paul Goodman . If nothing else , CityWalk has proved successful . Millions of people have come here after taking the Universal Studios Tour or seeing a film at the adjacent multiscreen cinema . An estimated 2 million more , many of them Los Angeles residents , have come specifically to see the complex . That is twice the number that MCA had hoped for . Executives announce this as if reducing all_the criticism to so_much theoretical hand-wringing . On weekend nights , their promenade boasts a carnival atmosphere , bristling with couples and clusters of teen-agers who hurry to dinner or merely stroll from shop to shop . The ethnically and geographically diverse crowd has dispelled predictions that CityWalk would attract only tourists and white suburbanites . &quot; It ' s a good place to hang_out and not spend too_much money , &quot; said Jansen Granflor , an 18-year-old from Riverside who brought a date on a Saturday night . &quot; There ' s a lot to look at. &quot; An immense , midnight-blue King Kong dangles over the entry . Rows of neon signs , placed there by the Museum of Neon Art , dance above the throng . Street musicians provide a soundtrack . This sensory texture represents the most obvious distinction between CityWalk and other commercial plazas such_as Old Town in Pasadena and downtown ' s Olvera Street . The Jerde Partnership sought to distill Los Angeles and its architectural array , from California Mission to ZigZag Moderne , in a way that would seem instantly familiar if not specifically recognizable . Doug Suisman , an architect whose firm , Public Works Design , is consulting on the RTD ' s proposed Electric Trolley Bus Project , said , &quot; When you see people walking_around , there is not that look of the dazed , manipulated consumer. &quot; An early critic of the project , he has been partially swayed by recent visits . &quot; People seem to be relaxed and enjoying the place for what it is. &quot; The central courtyard serves as an unexpected example . MCA initially fretted over a fountain in that courtyard . Because it was designed like the fountain outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , with ground-level jets that spurt water at irregular intervals , the management worried that visitors might wander through and get soaked . Instead , crowds now gather around , cheering as more adventurous souls take turns sprinting across , dodging the jets . Such unintended use is a hallmark of successful public spaces , designers say . James Nelson grins widely . As MCA ' s planning director , he is nothing if not exuberant about CityWalk and the ways -- both planned and unplanned -- in which it has developed . &quot; that ' s what happens in real life. &quot; * But something seems odd on a blustery Wednesday afternoon as visitors skitter under dark clouds . It takes a moment to realize what is amiss . It is music . Stereo speakers , mounted above the normal line_of_sight , broadcast at a volume that creeps gently into the awareness . They are broadcasting television theme_songs , which is not the sort of thing you would hear strolling through Westwood . So it becomes apparent that MCA has gone_to exhaustive lengths to create its vision . The street musicians who will arrive later are being paid a per diem . Many of the stores were brought_in not for their merchandise but for their entertainment value . Store windows pop and jitter with colorful gadgets . &quot; We want people to be able to go_in and grab things and see things and watch things move , &quot; said Tom Gilmore , the general_manager at CityWalk . In the process , urban designers say substance has been sacrificed . The bookstore is not as encompassing as those on the Third Street Promenade . The boutiques aren ' t as funky as those that line Melrose Avenue . There ' s not Hollywood Boulevard ' s array of immigrant businesses . CityWalk offers restaurants and toy stores , a sports memorabilia shop and numerous merchants who peddle various forms of trinkets . There is , perhaps , less to this place than meets the eye . &quot; If you look_at the great public spaces around the world , there is a range of activity , &quot; Suisman said . &quot; People doing_work , people running_into friends , people reading or sleeping . Private spaces can be experientially impoverished. &quot; This criticism , however , is purely aesthetic . What truly concerns designers is that CityWalk could alter public perception of our common areas . Again , it is a matter of the unique design . CityWalk is crafted to look_like a Los Angeles street , but that is not how it operates . Though the visitors are ethnically diverse , they tend to be clean and well-dressed . This place displays a predominantly middle-class image . &quot; They wanted to censor out the bad realities of our city , &quot; said Mike Davis , an urban theorist who has written extensively about class separation in Los Angeles . &quot; They have censored out people , the rank-and-file and the homeless , by giving subtle signals that they aren ' t wanted. &quot; The signals begin with a $ 6 parking fee , Davis said . And the giant King Kong that visitors pass under communicates expected behavior . &quot; Everyone has to pass_through a gate , &quot; Suisman explained , offering an analysis that Orne himself supports . &quot; At a very subtle level , that puts you in a more passive role. &quot; Not so subtle is a Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department substation located beside the courtyard . By including this facility in its design , MCA ensured a police presence . Last fall , the corporation feared that gang members had begun to congregate along the promenade at night . A strict code_of_conduct was enforced . Visitors were forbidden to assemble in large groups . Abusive language and &quot; unnecessary staring &quot; were outlawed . Anyone wearing a baseball_cap backward was told to turn it around or leave . The perceived gang problem quickly dissipated . Panhandlers have been similarly warded_off . &quot; We are not making a demographic selection , &quot; Spungin , MCA ' s president , said . &quot; We are making_sure that people who come here behave in a certain way. &quot; These are fighting words for a man like Davis , a radical populist who became a Marxist in the 1960s . &quot; There is a fundamental confusion between safety and people who simply make us uncomfortable because they are poor or they are young minorities , &quot; Davis argued . &quot; Old-fashioned American ideals of democracy are being sacrificed. &quot; Yet , as the city grows ever more fearful , MCA has gambled that people will sacrifice a little personal freedom for the opportunity to feel safe . So far , it seems , MCA has guessed right . &quot; It ' s a place where you can be comfortable without having to look over your back , &quot; said D ' Marc Lee , 23 , who visits regularly from downtown . &quot; You know there isn ' t going_to be any trouble. &quot; And at a seafood restaurant on the promenade , longtime restaurateur Bob Morris comments that he has never needed so many highchairs . &quot; Families feel comfortable coming here , &quot; Morris said . &quot; I don ' t mean to sound elitist , but I was raised in Los Angeles when it was nice , and we had places that were like CityWalk is now. &quot; Suisman finds nothing wrong with people wanting to feel safe or with CityWalk providing such security . The problem arises if , bewitched by this experience , the public begins seeking extensive controls on truly public spaces . &quot; that ' s scary when it becomes the daily norm , &quot; the architect said . * Even if mass perceptions never shift , Davis sees a more immediate threat to the public_domain . &quot; These unreal simulations have become fashionable , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a radical abandonment of the city. &quot; His argument goes like this : Tourists often seek_out public spaces as a way of sampling the local culture . The same can be said for residents wanting to participate in the life of their city . By providing a safe and fanciful version of Los Angeles , CityWalk may be drawing people away from places like Hollywood Boulevard and Olvera Street , which desperately need the attention and the consumer dollars . &quot; In that sense , &quot; Davis said , &quot; CityWalk is probably the most insidious kind of theme park. &quot; This view emanated from all points last summer . But time has swayed some critics , including Starr , the USC professor who uttered particularly dire words . &quot; I was concerned that the imagined L.A. could be taken as the real_thing , &quot; he said . &quot; The fact is , Venice boardwalk still gets crowded . The real L.A. is such a compelling presence that it won ' t be swamped. &quot; And the professor admits to liking CityWalk . &quot; As an urban resort , &quot; he said , &quot; it ' s very successful. &quot; &quot; For the crowds who ' ve flocked to CityWalk since its opening ( last ) May the answer is clear : They love it . And the reasons why they love it reveal some crucial truths about the nature of urban life in the late 20th Century . These truths will confound the idealists who cry_out_for less-contrived urban gathering_places . They will , however , confirm the instincts of those who believe that people will take_to a new kind of city place that entertains them and respects their need to feel safe . CityWalk succeeds brilliantly as a public place that most Angelenos will enjoy. &quot; -- from Leon Whiteson ' s October , 1993 , critique in The Times . CityWalk arrived amid floods and riots , fires and earthquakes , events of nearly biblical proportion . It was inevitable that some would hail this complex as visionary while others would reject it as a sign that the apocalypse was upon us . After wrestling with his own conflicting opinions , John Kaliski , a former principal architect for the city ' s Community Redevelopment Agency , finds himself leaning toward a less ponderous view . Most of the hype and criticism fall by the wayside , Kaliski said , if you reduce CityWalk to its most basic form . &quot; It ' s not the_devil that some people claim it to be , &quot; he said . &quot; And I don ' t care what Jim Nelson says , as long as he admits it isn ' t a solution or a substitute . It ' s a sophisticated marketing formula. &quot; In other words , CityWalk is a shopping_mall . &quot; And for a shopping_mall , &quot; Kaliski said , &quot; it ' s pretty good. &quot; Good_enough , at the very least , to join such venerable attractions as the Watts Towers and the Griffith Park Observatory on Los Angeles magazine ' s recent list of &quot; 300 Reasons Not to Pack Up and Leave L.A. &quot; And good_enough to get some urban designers wondering if the rest of the city might learn a thing or two from the complex . In his critique , Whiteson points_out that CityWalk can trace its lineage to Paris ' Palais Royal and London ' s Burlington Arcade , both of which were privately owned public spaces . He suggests that modern suburban malls might rip_off their roofs and transform their &quot; desolate central circulation spine &quot; into livelier , urbanized scenes . Suisman concurred : &quot; The retailers at CityWalk have been really inventive with their storefronts and signage . Imagine bringing that to Wilshire or Hollywood boulevards. &quot; Designers also wonder if the dividing line between public and private spaces may continue to blur . If so , and if CityWalk provides any sort of indicator , the merger will not come easily . Just ask the people who live_down the_hill in Studio City . While MCA talks excitedly about expansion -- they ' ll add country-music and blues clubs to the promenade this summer and a Hard Rock Cafe as part of a larger , future addition -- these residents find themselves watching closely . They are tempted to mimic some aspects of CityWalk along their own stretch of Ventura Boulevard but , at_the_same_time , they worry about being too manipulative . &quot; We ' re just sad people can ' t find that kind of experience on the outside , &quot; mused Tony Lucente , president of the Studio City Residents Assn . &quot; Is that what Los Angeles is going_to become ? &quot; WHERE AND WHEN Location : Universal CityWalk , Universal City . Hours : 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Restaurants stay open later . Price : Parking , $ 6 . Call : ( 818 ) 622-4455 .</TEXT>
