   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE MIDEAST ; THE ROAD TO PEACE WIDENS ; WITH JORDAN COMING_ON BOARD , ONLY SYRIA IS LEFT TO BE PERSUADED . ISRAEL HAS NEVER BEEN IN A BETTER POSITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On July 26 , the success of the Mideast peace process ceased to be a doubtful prospect and became a near certainty . With the Egyptian treaty firmly established , the Palestinian self-governing authority slowly overcoming its initial disorder and the state_of_war with Jordan canceled by King Hussein ' s regal proclamation , Israel is living_in a brighter glow than it has ever known before . Syria is more likely to be drawn into the emerging regional order than to remain outside its magnetic_field . Precedent and tradition encourage this hope . Syria has usually joined an Arab initiative at the latest feasible stage . In the early months of 1949 , three countries , Egypt , Jordan and Lebanon , signed armistice agreements with Israel , which defined the regional and territorial structure for some decades . Syria adhered six months later . Henry Kissinger mediated a disengagement agreement with Egypt and Israel in January , 1974 . Syria signed a similar agreement later , on May 31 of that year . The lateness was calculated : Syria has to have its demonstration of reluctance ; it is a part of its national temperament . Damascus now has nowhere else to look if it wishes to avoid isolation . President Boris Yeltsin ' s congratulatory message to President Bill_Clinton after the joint U.S. congressional session should remind President Hafez Assad that he no longer has an assured arms supply or the protection of a Russian safety net in the unlikely event of an assault on Israel . There are some indications that he is not far from following the politics of reconciliation practiced by Egypt , Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization . His frank condemnation of the terrorist assaults in Buenos Aires and London sound like routine gestures , but they are unique in the Syrian practice . The next phases of the peace process will recall the intrinsic difficulties of negotiating in a multilateral context . All Arab states are faced with an identity problem . Are they sovereign states reaching their decisions in terms of their separate geographies , social orientations and diverse power_structures ? Or are they a family bound to habits of solidarity and harmonious movement ? The truth is that they are both of these things at different times . In general , the federal tendencies in Arab nationalism are weakening and individual decision-making is_on the rise . Anwar Sadat ' s plunge into peace with Israel , Saddam Hussein ' s revolt against the West , Moammar Kadafi ' s anarchic behavior and Jordan ' s defiant defense of Jordanian interests all give a picture of &quot; each one for itself. &quot; Yet there is a strong preference in the Arab world for common action if this does not interfere with national interest . Jordan will probably give time for Syria to join the peace momentum , but not so_much time as_to miss the opportunities offered by last week ' s Washington declaration . Syria has missed too many opportunities in the past and it has gained nothing by yielding to intimidation by more radical Arab states . Another incentive for Syria to join the peace process is that the PLO cannot convincingly inhibit Damascus from negotiating with Israel , as in the past . What is respectable in Arab terms is still defined by the Palestine issue . King Hussein could not have moved to his present attitude toward Israel before the Oslo agreement and the establishment of the Palestinian self-governing authority . Syria could not now accept criticism from Yasser Arafat , who has himself signed commitments well ahead of Damascus . Hussein ' s example is also helpful . It would have been grotesque for him to seek more contacts with the previous Israeli government which insisted on keeping all_the residents of the West_Bank and Gaza under permanent Israeli subjection . Hussein may_not be Arafat ' s greatest admirer , but he is the last ruler who could afford to appear as a betrayer of the Palestine people . Nor is this his ideology . It is the readiness of the current Israeli government for innovation and compromise that has done more_than anything else to make a peace process possible . The Israeli leaders , Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , have awarded Hussein a preferential position regarding the Muslim holy_places . This is sustained by traditional rights , but the king will need a Muslim as well as an Israeli mandate for the exercise of that right . In July , 1967 , the government of Israel , in a communication to the United Nations , declared that &quot; Israel does not claim exclusive_rights or unilateral responsibility in the Holy_Places of Islam. &quot; This was drafted by Ministers Menachem Begin , Zerach Warhaftig and me . Our unanimous Israeli refusal to envisage a secular division of our capital is reinforced , not weakened , by our readiness to accept the management of the holy_places by those who hold them sacred . In the next few formative years , Israel will have to give more weight to diplomacy as one of the ultimate guarantors of its peace . One day , a national entity may exist , sufficiently powerful , wealthy and secure to live without any reliance on external forces . It will then be able to dispense_with diplomacy . As yet , no such community has existed on earth , though some have aspired to that condition and others have been deluded into thinking that they have achieved it . With all_the lachrymose talk_about Israel as the victim of world history , the truth is that no small state has ever been more in need of outside support -- or more successful in obtaining it . Anyone who doubted this would have a hard_time to name another state that could ever hope to celebrate a day like that which Israel and Jordan lived together in the House of Congress in Washington on July 26 , 1994 .</TEXT>
