   <HEADLINE> SUPERVISORS TO ASK NAVY FOR EL TORO LAND FOR AIRPORT ; BASE CONVERSION : LETTER WILL OFFICIALLY REQUEST 2 # 000 ACRES . MEANWHILE , THE FAA HAS AGREED TO ACT_ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY IN FEDERAL TALKS ON THE MARINE FACILITY ' S FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Taking another step toward converting El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station to a commercial airport , the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to officially ask the Navy_Department to set_aside the 2 # 000 acres it will take_to build the facility . Meanwhile , the Federal Aviation Administration , which certifies major airports in the United States , has agreed to act_on behalf of Orange County ' s interests when other federal agencies meet to discuss the future use of the 4 # 700-acre Marine base , said Jan Mittermeier , manager of John Wayne Airport . Other federal agencies interested in acquiring property and developing the Marine base include the Bureau of Prisons , Department_of_the_Interior and the Air_Force , which wants to relocate a California Air National_Guard facility there from its Costa Mesa site . Supervisors authorized Mittermeier to send a letter to the Navy_Department to alert military officials that the county wants 2 # 000 acres at the base to build a civilian airport when the Marines leave by 1999 , as mandated by Measure A . The letter will be sent today to meet a Dec . 1 federal deadline . John Wayne Airport officials said the FAA has agreed to send a separate letter to the Navy endorsing the county ' s intent to study the El Toro airport plan . Airport proponents called the FAA ' s role a key development in their plans to build an airport , but Mittermeier described the federal agency ' s move as &quot; a routine process. &quot; FAA spokesman Fred O ' Donnell was unable to confirm that the agency was going_to send a letter in support of Orange County ' s plan for an airport . But Mittermeier said the FAA agreed to write a letter of support because the agency wants to make_sure it has a role in discussions by federal agencies about the base ' s future as long as an airport is included in the county ' s development plans . &quot; The only thing that the FAA has done is tell the Navy that if the ( local planning authority ) is interested in pursuing ( a commercial airport ) , we are interested in helping to sponsor the effort , &quot; Mittermeier said . &quot; That does not mean than an airport will be there . A feasibility study still needs to be done. &quot; David Ellis , a spokesman for a group of airport proponents , put a different spin on the FAA ' s involvement . &quot; The mere fact that the FAA is willing to consider El Toro as an airport is an important development , &quot; Ellis said . &quot; In this giant bureaucratic process called base closure , to have a federal agency willing to sit at the table and review data for an airport is an important development. &quot; Measure A , which was approved by voters earlier this month , obligates the county to build an airport at El Toro , provided that it passes federal scrutiny . Although supervisors authorized Mittermeier to send the letter to the Navy to meet a Dec . 1 deadline , Dan Miller , executive_director of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , said the Navy has agreed to extend that deadline for all agencies interested in acquiring property at the base to April 1 . The planning authority , which was formed to plan the development of the base , will formally request the extension at the group ' s meeting today , Miller said . &quot; The Navy has already given us an indication that getting the extension will be no problem , &quot; he said . &quot; However , the Board of Supervisors wasn ' t taking any chances . Everyone wanted the letter sent_out to make_sure we ' re covered , and let the Navy know the county is interested in the 2 # 000 acres needed for the base. &quot;</TEXT>
