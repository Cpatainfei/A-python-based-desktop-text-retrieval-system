   <TEXT> The Israeli soldier whose kidnaping by Islamic militants threatened to derail the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was killed Friday night in a firefight when Israeli soldiers stormed the West_Bank house where he was held . The disastrous climax to a hostage drama that has absorbed Israelis since Tuesday night overshadowed the nation ' s joy at the announcement Friday morning in Norway that Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres received this year ' s Nobel Peace Prize , along with Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat . In a hastily called late-night news_conference Friday , a grim-faced Rabin told the nation that the soldier , 19-year-old Nachshon Waxman , was killed &quot; in cold blood &quot; by his captors during the operation . &quot; I , as minister of defense and prime_minister , take full responsibility , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; It is our obligation not to surrender to terrorism but to act against it. &quot; Arafat aide Marwan Kanafani said the PLO chairman was saddened by the loss of life . Kanafani said the PLO had been vindicated in its assertion that Waxman was not being held_in Gaza . Another Israeli , an officer identified at the scene as Capt . Nir Poraz , was killed during the attack . Nine other Israelis were wounded and three Palestinians were killed , Chief_of_Staff Lt . Gen . Ehud Barak said . Two Palestinians were arrested . Barak said that Waxman , whose hands and feet were tied , was shot in the neck and chest by his captors shortly after the assault on the house in the village of Bir Nabala began . Bir Nabala lies just outside Jerusalem ' s northern municipal boundary , only two miles from the home of Waxman ' s parents . The elite unit mounted the attack only 90 minutes before the 9 p.m. ( 11 a.m. PDT ) deadline set by the militant group Hamas for killing Waxman if Israel refused to release Palestinian prisoners in its custody . The commandos were slowed by having to use explosives to force their way into the house , Barak said . Once inside , they had to use explosives again to destroy the door to the room where Waxman was held , Barak said . &quot; They could hear the terrorists in the room with Waxman shouting , ' The soldier is already dead , ' &quot; Barak said . &quot; They shouted at the terrorists to surrender , but they said they preferred to die. &quot; It was a stunning turn of events at the end of a day during which most Israelis anxiously awaited the Hamas deadline . Throughout the week , Israelis have listened to the tearful pleas of Waxman ' s mother , Esther , broadcast on Israel Army Radio and Israel Television , for the release of her son , who holds dual American-Israeli citizenship . The soldier ' s plight triggered a massive outpouring of support for the family . Tens of thousands of Israelis responded to a request from the family Thursday night and flocked to the Western Wall_in Jerusalem ' s Old City -- a site holy to Jews as the only remnant of the Temple of Solomon , the destruction of which marked the start of the Diaspora -- to pray for Waxman ' s safe return . Hundreds gathered outside the family home_in a northern Jerusalem suburb Friday night as the deadline approached and then passed . So caught_up in the drama was most of the nation that Rabin violated religious prohibitions against working_on the Sabbath in_order to hold the press_conference , broadcast live_on Israel Television , and explain how Waxman died . The somber turn of events was particularly confusing , because just three hours before the army acknowledged that Waxman died in the failed rescue attempt , a Hamas leader announced that the organization had negotiated with Israel a 24-hour extension of its deadline for killing Waxman . Mahmoud Zahar told Israel Television at 8 p.m. that &quot; the deadline has been extended. &quot; Zahar said that the militants holding Waxman , for whom he said he was acting_as a mediator , had agreed to extend their deadline after Israel agreed to free Sheik Ahmed Yassin , Hamas ' founder and spiritual_leader , and 32 Palestinian women it is holding among about 4 # 000 Palestinian prisoners . Rabin confirmed that he had received the support of both his Cabinet and opposition parties for negotiating with Hamas . He used an Israeli Arab member of the Knesset , Israel ' s Parliament , as a go-between . &quot; There was hope , but Rabin killed the hope and the soldier , &quot; said the go-between , Talab Sanaa , after Waxman ' s death was announced . &quot; There were chances to bring_out the soldier alive. &quot; The Izzidin al-Qassam military_unit of Hamas , which claimed responsibility for abducting Waxman on Sunday , had said on Tuesday night that it would kill him Friday night unless Israel released Yassin and 200 other prisoners . Zahar said an appeal broadcast by Israel Television on Thursday night from the jailed Yassin -- the second he had made -- to Waxman ' s captors , asking that they not harm the soldier , persuaded the kidnapers to modify their demands and extend the deadline . But Rabin said Friday night that Hamas waited too long to make_it clear to him that it was willing to extend the deadline . &quot; The policy of this government is conducted along two lines , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; One is the efforts to achieve peace , and the other is an unrelenting war against terrorism. &quot; Rabin said that Israeli security_forces learned only Friday morning that Waxman was being held_in Bir Nabala , a village of about 7 # 000 people . Until Friday , Israel had insisted that he was being held_in the Gaza Strip , in territory controlled by the PLO . After the Izzidin al-Qassam unit first issued its demands in a videotape aired on Israel Television on Tuesday night , a furious Rabin on Wednesday ordered Gaza closed , banning about 30 # 000 workers from their daily commute into Israel . He also suspended peace negotiations with the Palestinians that were under way in Cairo , and he told Arafat that Israel ' s future relations with the Palestinian Authority were at stake . In response , Arafat ordered the biggest roundup of suspects since Israel handed him control over the daily lives of Palestinians in Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho last May . Hamas activists warned that Arafat was risking civil_war by arresting as_many as 200 supporters of the movement , which was founded in Gaza and enjoys widespread support there . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher backed Rabin ' s tough stance with the Palestinian Authority , lecturing Arafat in Alexandria , Egypt , on Friday morning that he must &quot; do everything conceivable &quot; to find Waxman . Palestinian officials kept saying they had no proof Waxman was in Gaza , but Barak and other Israeli officials scornfully dismissed such demurrals throughout the week . Rabin offered no apologies to Arafat on Friday night , nor did he say when talks with the Palestinians will resume or when Gaza will be reopened . Israel is the primary source of employment for residents of Gaza , an impoverished and overcrowded strip of coastal land with little industry of its own . &quot; The people who carried_out the kidnaping were given orders from Gaza , &quot; Rabin said at the press_conference . &quot; Their commander and the person giving them orders is in Gaza . Therefore I say : Recognizing the fact that it is true that Waxman was not held_in Gaza , still these actions are being planned and directed from Gaza. &quot; It is up_to the Palestinian Authority , Rabin said , to &quot; prevent turning the Gaza Strip into a base from which terrorist attacks are planned and initiated. &quot; In Washington , President Clinton issued a statement calling Friday ' s events a &quot; dark moment. &quot; &quot; In the face of such cowardly and evil action , I know that it is hard to go_forward , &quot; the President said . &quot; But we owe it to all those who have paid such a heavy price to persist and finally prevail in our pursuit of peace. &quot; Peace Deferred In a news_conference after the raid , Israeli Prime Minster Yitzhak Rabin said , &quot; I wish I could give_up the Nobel Prize to get the two soldiers back. &quot; West_Bank Raid Cpl . Nachshon Waxman was killed in the village of Bir Nabala in the West_Bank . The kidnaping has threatened to wreck the fragile Israel-PLO peace accord and trigger new violence in the region .</TEXT>
