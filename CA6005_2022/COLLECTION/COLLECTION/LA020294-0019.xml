   <TEXT> Only 57 dead , a_few thousand injured , hundreds of them seriously enough to be hospitalized . Just four hospitals evacuated because of earthquake damage . In the aftermath of one of the most destructive natural_events to strike California in the 20th Century , it appears that once again we escaped catastrophe in the delivery of medical_care . Proving the adage that &quot; it ' s more important to be lucky than good , &quot; sufficient emergency medical_care was provided despite the lack of a comprehensive medical disaster response plan . This does not imply that those in the emergency medical services system are not doing their job . Quite the contrary , Los Angeles is blessed with an abundance of dedicated and skilled personnel . Rather , it is the assumption that hospitals should be the sole provider of &quot; disaster medical_care &quot; that is flawed . Currently , there is only one medical disaster response plan : Take the injured to the hospital . But we know that there may be no hospital , or no way to get_to it . Many people won ' t survive the 72-hour wait until sufficient help arrives from outside the area . We know that within six hours following an earthquake , people with serious but treatable medical problems will begin dying if they do not receive advanced care . If untreated , in 24 to 48 hours these potential survivors will perish . This is exactly what will happen unless alternatives to traditional centralized care facilities are developed . As can be seen in the Northridge quake , hospitals are vulnerable . A closer look_at what happened illustrates how fortunate we were . On first inspection , the delivery of medical_care seemed adequate . No one died waiting in_line at emergency_rooms . Patients with serious problems got prompt care . Damaged hospitals transferred their patients without serious incident . So why the concern ? If the upheaval had occurred instead at 4:30 p.m. , the sheer volume of injured victims would have drastically increased . The freeways , parking structures , shopping_centers and office_buildings that collapsed would have been swarming with people . Many thousands would have been trapped and critically injured . Hundreds more would have less significant injuries requiring immediate care . There would n ' t be nearly enough resources to handle patients already hospitalized -- who would have to be evacuated -- and the new quake victims . Delays would kill people . This wasn ' t the &quot; Big One , &quot; but had it struck 12 hours later , it would have been big enough . A practical solution is possible . Clearly , hospitals are crucial , but they must be supported by an additional form of medical response that can be activated within the first hour and function even if the hospitals are destroyed . Concerned emergency physicians have devised such a plan , relying_on the pre-positioning of advanced medical equipment in community disaster medical-aid centers staffed by doctors and nurses trained in the &quot; out-of-hospital &quot; management of disaster victims . The money to implement the plan hasn ' t been found . The plan calls_for putting stores of medical supplies in facilities most likely to survive earthquakes , such_as fire_stations and schools . Most of these structures are within an hour ' s walk of everyone , so they are accessible even if the transportation_system fails . The supplies would be periodically exchanged with hospitals to prevent spoilage . Training for health-care providers is already available through a nonprofit corporation called Medical Disaster Response . A disaster declaration would direct medical personnel not required at hospitals to the disaster centers . Patients with mild to moderate injuries and illnesses would be treated on location . Those seriously ill would be stabilized and , if hospitals are still functional , transferred there . If no hospital_care is available , patients would be moved to predetermined &quot; casualty collection points , &quot; and from there to facilities outside the disaster_area . If the local hospital is intact , only the seriously injured are sent there . If it is not , valuable time is not wasted . One city in the Los Angeles area , Santa Fe Springs , has already begun this strategy . It is divided into four areas , each having its own cache of equipment , to which citizens and trained personnel will report when disaster strikes . Our memory of this frightening event will begin to fade as the aftershocks diminish , but the threat remains . The state_Department of Conservation predicts a magnitude 7.5 quake producing an estimated 100 # 000 casualties within our lifetimes . This time around , we dodged the bullet , but next time our luck may run_out . Until a realistic disaster medical plan is in place , we remain at risk . One need not look too closely to see the emperor still has no clothes .</TEXT>
