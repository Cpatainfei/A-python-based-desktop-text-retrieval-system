   <HEADLINE> JACKSON CALLS TV RACIST , URGES ACTION ; MEDIA : THE ACTIVIST SAYS THE NETWORKS NEED TO HIRE MORE MINORITIES AND RETOOL PROGRAMMING . HE THREATENS A BOYCOTT IF CHANGES ARE NOT MADE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Rev . Jesse Jackson on Monday accused television networks of &quot; institutional racism , &quot; and vowed to encourage viewers to boycott networks that refuse to schedule programs with positive ethnic images or do not place minorities in key decision-making positions . At a news_conference in South-Central Los Angeles , Jackson said the newly formed Rainbow Coalition Commission on Fairness in the Media has become increasingly concerned over what he called the significant lack of representation of African Americans , Latinos , Asian Americans , Native_Americans and women among network news anchors , prime-time entertainment writing staffs and in prominent roles that do not involve criminal activity . &quot; We have written the networks letters , and the response , by and large , has been defensive as they attempt to justify what is unjustifiable , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; While we ' re willing to talk , we ' re also willing to walk . It ' s now time for aggressive direct action. &quot; Jackson said he was particularly disturbed by the cancellation of several black-oriented shows on Fox , including &quot; South Central , &quot; &quot; Roc , &quot; &quot; In Living Color &quot; and &quot; The Sinbad Show , &quot; adding that there did not seem to be much change in the upcoming fall season . * &quot; We know that significant shows were cut_off from Fox this season , and that is of great concern to us , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; We look_at the data we have_on NBC . It is substantial . It is ugly . We look_at the projected format for CBS this fall . In the real sense , all_of them are recycling racist practices . It is called institutional racism . It is manifest not only in their hiring , but in their priorities. &quot; Officials for Fox , NBC , CBS and ABC could not be reached for comment . During the news_conference and in a separate interview with The Times , Jackson compared his campaign to the historic march in Selma , Ala. , and other civil_rights demonstrations . He decried the lack of coverage of minorities during the recent D-day celebrations . Blacks are woefully absent during Sunday public affairs shows , he added . &quot; Those all-white hosts determine their guests and set the political agenda for public policy for Monday morning . that ' s not America. &quot; Jackson said the commission is researching network hiring practices and the portrayal of minorities , and would present those findings during a workshop in September . At that time , offending networks will be targeted for action , he said . &quot; They think they have the right to not include us in recruitment , hiring , promotion , projection , decision making , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; But we have consumer power , we have viewer power , we have the power to change dials . We will do just that until there is a change . &quot; The boycotts would start in September , &quot; he said . &quot; The networks have time now to get their house in_order . They can begin to change now. &quot; Also at the news_conference at the African American Community Unity Center were Brotherhood Crusade founder Danny Bakewell and comedian Sinbad . Bakewell said he has also given a mandate to local TV_stations to hire more minorities . He complained that there was not one black anchor of a local weeknight newscast . &quot; These things must change , and we are going_to bring that about , and we are serious that we will see that action as we progress this fall , &quot; Bakewell said .</TEXT>
