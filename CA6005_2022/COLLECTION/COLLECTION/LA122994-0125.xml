   <TEXT> Chaplain John Greenlee stood_back from the trauma room at the Thousand Oaks hospital as memories of the deaths he had witnessed suddenly began to file by . Men of 80 years , children of just a_few -- all had taken their final breath under the harsh surgical light just paces away . &quot; I can see them , &quot; the chaplain at Los Robles Regional Medical_Center said as if addressing himself , his voice thickening with emotion . &quot; A 17-year-old girl . A woman on her knees praying beside her husband , saying , ' It can ' t be . It can ' t be. ' &quot; Just as quickly , the ghosts vanished and Greenlee , a tall and cheery spirit , rejoined the living . &quot; Boy , we ' re nearly a full_house today , aren ' t we ? &quot; he said to a crowded waiting_room . Eleven people from two families had gathered while loved ones struggled for their lives in the intensive-care unit nearby . Someone asked Greenlee what exactly it is he does as chaplain . &quot; I ' ve never really known exactly how to explain it , &quot; he quipped . &quot; They say , ' Pray a lot. ' &quot; A ripple of laughter rolled across the room , relieving the ache and the tension . &quot; This place needs smiles , &quot; Greenlee said in the hallway . While physicians attend_to frailties of the body , Greenlee and a_couple_of dozen chaplains -- salaried and volunteer -- attend_to injuries of the soul at hospitals throughout Ventura County . In wide hallways and small waiting_rooms , behind emergency curtains and under hanging televisions , they work . They can use a humorous turn of phrase to brighten a fading life , a knack for small_talk to quicken the drag of time , a good ear to defuse anger or anguish . They seek not to win converts , but to ease passage -- either back into life or on to death , said Chaplain David Knapp of St . John ' s Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo . The heroism , humanity and pain chaplains witness are typically far removed from the public_eye . &quot; The way that people let you into their lives , I feel_like I ' m walking on sacred ground , &quot; said Chaplain Christine Picchi , director of chaplains at St . John ' s Regional Medical_Center in Oxnard . &quot; We receive as much as we give. &quot; Greenlee , 65 , who also serves as a minister at Westlake Community Christian_Church , said , &quot; You ' ve got_to love people or you can ' t do this thing . . . . Some ( patients ) won ' t let_go_of your hand. &quot; Nurses and doctors , the dying , the living , the disbelieving have all sought chaplains ' comfort . Sometimes they even help save lives . Sunny Kraye , 53 , on her third day in the intensive-care waiting_room at St . John ' s in Camarillo , credited Knapp with helping her 78-year-old mother battle back from a heart_attack . &quot; She told me , she told the nurse , she told David she wanted to die , &quot; the Valencia resident said . &quot; But with David ' s help , she was encouraged to fight it . She said , ' Lying here , I realize how much more I have to live for. ' She ' s dramatically improved. &quot; Traumatized by their injury or illness , some patients , particularly those in their closing years , can make ill-informed decisions about whether to prolong their lives . &quot; Hopefully , the role I play is to clarify the patient ' s wishes , &quot; Knapp said . &quot; And sometimes that means helping , along with the physicians and the nurses , to see if the wishes of the patient are clouded by depression , or by pain. &quot; He cited the case of another ailing woman who forbade hospital personnel to put her on a ventilator , saying she preferred to die instead . Knapp helped dissuade her . &quot; She ' s very happy to be alive now , &quot; he said . &quot; We want to move very carefully and cautiously , &quot; he added . &quot; You don ' t want to violate the sacredness of a patient ' s wish , but you want to make_sure those wishes aren ' t clouded by the patient ' s temporary mental state. &quot; Although they are members of health-care teams bent upon the preservation of life , chaplains also must be prepared to allay the guilt of fatally ill patients who are so miserable that they elect to die , Knapp said . &quot; The job , then , is to let them know when it ' s OK , &quot; he said . Death , paradoxically , is another part of the life process , said Chaplain Donald Ham of Simi Valley Hospital . After all , Knapp said , &quot; the body is not what is sacred . It ' s the sense of beingness , the sense of personhood . . . . Jesus didn ' t put all_of his focus_on his fleshly existence . If that was the most important thing to him , he would have never been able to go_to the cross. &quot; Knapp , 43 , a former minor-league baseball_player who is an ordained United Methodist minister , darkened when he recalled an incident about two years ago . Bothered by a pain in his leg , a 6-year-old boy was brought by his mother to the hospital for tests . He had leukemia . &quot; It was ever so difficult , ever so sad , &quot; said Knapp , who sat with the mother and child while the doctor delivered his diagnosis . &quot; I had nightmares with that child . I had very restless , sleepless nights for a while. &quot; Faced with such meaningless suffering , chaplains can become victims , too , Greenlee said , their faith sometimes tested . Ham remembered a trying day in which three lives passed before his eyes . In the first case , the family of 14-year-old stabbing victim Chad Hubbard agonized in the waiting room at Simi Valley Hospital while Ham served as a liaison between them and the surgical team battling to save the boy ' s life . Periodically , Ham would duck into the swirl of bodies in the emergency_room to collect scraps of news -- little of it good -- that he could deliver to the anxious parents and their pastor . By the time Chad died , his family had been somewhat prepared , Ham said . A short time later , a 45-year-old man who suffered a heart_attack while exercising died in the same emergency_room , his wife nearby . Then a woman injured in a car accident was wheeled into the same room , where physicians vainly fought to revive her while her husband watched . &quot; What I try to do as soon as possible is take a break and take a good walk , &quot; said the 62-year-old Ham , soon to be an associate pastor at the Glendale Seventh-day Adventist Church . But all he could do after this eight-hour odyssey through pain and loss was collapse in bed , drained both emotionally and spiritually . &quot; In this profession , you must distance yourself appropriately enough from the tragic situations for self-protection of_your_own psyche and your own well-being , &quot; said Knapp , who uses humor to help insulate himself . &quot; If I ( didn ' t ) , then I would be an absolute basket case . Anyone would , whether you were a nurse or a doctor or a radiology technician. &quot; Picchi , 42 , who directs Ventura County ' s only chaplain-education program , said : &quot; Hospitals are stressful places for people to work in , because daily they ' re being exposed to people who are suffering or have sustained tragedy and loss . And so I think people who work in health_care are vulnerable , too . And one of our goals as chaplains is to care_for our staff. &quot; Now in her 10th year as a supervisor at St . John ' s , Picchi oversees a staff of seven chaplains at the Oxnard hospital , four of them full-time and all but two of them women . The facility has a hospital chapel , as do the Camarillo , Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley hospitals , with daily services that can be broadcast to patients ' rooms . Picchi ' s mother died when Picchi was a 15-year-old student in Burlingame , south of San Francisco . The event was pivotal in her decision to become a chaplain , she said . So overwhelming was the support she received from the Sisters of Mercy -- who ran her Catholic high_school -- &quot; that I was very attracted to people who work in the health-care profession and who help others through difficult times of grief and loss , &quot; Picchi said . In addition to giving sacrament to the dying and funeral assistance to the living , chaplains can float the options of donating organs or tissue , Picchi said . Consider the case of Michelle Glassman , a Moorpark College_student killed in an accident on Sept . 22 , 1990 . As_many as 65 people across the country gained from her death by receiving transplants of her tissues , bones and organs , said Paul Mathis , who at the time was a chaplain at Simi Valley Hospital . &quot; Dealing with the family is always the hardest part . But it needs to be done , &quot; said Brenda Perry , a registered nurse at Los Robles who sometimes assists Greenlee and others in inquiring about the harvesting of organs . Concerned as much with the living as with the dying , Greenlee said he and others never coerce such decisions out of grieving survivors . &quot; If they say no , you say , ' that ' s fine . We understand , ' &quot; Perry said in_agreement . Eleanor Roche , director of volunteer services at Los Robles , said Greenlee is particularly experienced with &quot; catastrophic things &quot; -- such_as the horrors in the emergency_room -- because he has been a volunteer chaplain with the Ventura County Fire_Department for 18 years . At the yawning door of the trauma room , Greenlee said , &quot; When a patient dies , I encourage people to see their loved ones . There ' s a closure then. &quot; Literally , he added , he sometimes holds the survivors up , to &quot; let them have their last look . Then when it ' s time , you tell them . You say , ' It ' s time now. ' &quot; Like coroner ' s examiners on doorsteps at midnight , chaplains are not always welcome . One elderly patient , seeing Greenlee appear in the doorway of his hospital_room , brusquely challenged him : &quot; Is it that bad ? &quot; Greenlee said no . &quot; I never did care much for preachers , &quot; Greenlee recalled another man saying . The chaplain shot back in jest : &quot; You know , I never did like them that much , either . They ' re usually so stuffy. &quot; The gruff man appreciated that , so Greenlee asked if he wanted to pray . &quot; Yes , &quot; the patient grumbled , &quot; but not now. &quot; While some dispirited patients might lash_out at their god or even at the chaplain , Knapp does not take it personally . &quot; I ' m a representative of faith , but I ' m not the faith , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve found that one of the poorest things I can do is tell a patient , ' There , there now . You ' re not supposed to say that. ' That negates their feelings . It negates their process . It ' s better to go_with their process and allow it to run its course . &quot; It ' s a lot healthier , faith-wise and recovery-wise , to let the patient get_it out. &quot;</TEXT>
