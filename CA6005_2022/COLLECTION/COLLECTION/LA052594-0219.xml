   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA TO JOIN NATO PARTNERSHIP ; MILITARY : AFTER A SERIES OF FLIP-FLOPS , MOSCOW SAYS IT WILL ACCEPT AUXILIARY STATUS IN WESTERN ALLIANCE . BUT IT HINTS AT NEW DEMANDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia said Tuesday that it will join NATO ' s new Partnership for Peace program for former East Bloc countries despite its earlier reservations , but it hinted that it still may seek some political concessions in return . At a meeting of North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization defense ministers , Russian defense chief Pavel S . Grachev told reporters that President Boris N . Yeltsin &quot; instructed me that I should make_it clear that Russia will join the . . . program. &quot; He also denied that Russia will demand a formal side agreement providing it with more status than other countries in the program , as Moscow had suggested earlier . &quot; We are not going_to set_forth any conditions , &quot; he said . But Western officials continued to be wary , mindful of earlier indications that Moscow would demand that NATO agree to some sort of new protocol that would give Moscow more authority beyond the Partnership for Peace program . U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry told reporters after Grachev ' s news_conference that he still does not know precisely what demands Moscow will make . &quot; I don ' t know anything more_than you heard , &quot; he said . Grachev ' s appearance followed a series of Russian flip-flops over the issue of whether to join the program . Moscow had been expected to apply for membership last month but balked in protest over NATO air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina . The Russian defense minister is scheduled to provide details today about what demands , if any , Moscow will make . The issue of Russia ' s membership is important because its establishment of a formal relationship with NATO is viewed by the West as an important step_in strengthening ties between the two former foes . Some Western officials fear that if Moscow chooses not to join the program , it could bolster the influence of hard-liners in Russia who want the government to keep the West at arm ' s length . But some analysts believe the issue of special status is mainly symbolic and that Moscow is looking primarily for a political gesture that will help counter complaints by nationalists that post-Cold War Russia is not getting due respect . Grachev appeared to be working to that end Tuesday when he made_a_point of declaring that the NATO ministers had been &quot; listening to me carefully &quot; and were &quot; sympathetic &quot; to Russia ' s plans . The Partnership for Peace program was adopted at a NATO summit in January as a way to strengthen ties with former East Bloc countries by giving them a sort of auxiliary status involving consultations and some joint exercises . As of Tuesday , 18 former Soviet satellites and republics , from Poland to Kazakhstan , had formally joined the program , and the_Netherlands has announced that it will hold military exercises with the Poles this fall . The West ' s major objection to providing any special status for the Russians is a fear by some_other former East Bloc countries that Moscow will dominate the new program -- eventually regaining control over their affairs . Both Western and former East Bloc countries also are fearful of Moscow ' s recent assertions that Russia should have the right to send troops to former Soviet republics , such_as Georgia , in which large_numbers of Russians live . Perry and other key NATO ministers made_it clear Tuesday that they recognize that Russia ' s relationship with NATO is likely to be broader than that of other countries because of its size and the fact that it is a nuclear_power . &quot; Russia and NATO need a solid partnership , &quot; German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said . &quot; Russia must be treated and perceived to be treated as a great power. &quot; But Sergio Balanzino , NATO ' s deputy secretary_general , told reporters that the Western ministers had already decided that Moscow ' s membership in the program must adhere to the same rules as do other countries . Even if Grachev and the ministers reach agreement in principle today , officials say it is unlikely that NATO will act_on the application before early June , when NATO ' s foreign_ministers are scheduled to meet in Istanbul , Turkey .</TEXT>
