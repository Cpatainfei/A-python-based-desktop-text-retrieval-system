   <HEADLINE> ' MORAL COURAGE ' TO END VIOLENCE URGED_ON IRA ; ULSTER : TOP CATHOLIC POLITICIAN SAYS HE REALIZES OUTLAWED GROUP WOULD FACE ENORMOUS CHALLENGE ACCEPTING BRITISH-IRISH PEACE DECLARATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The senior Roman_Catholic political_leader in Ulster told the_Irish Republican Army on Tuesday that ending the campaign of violence for a united Ireland would be one of the century ' s &quot; greatest acts of moral courage. &quot; John Hume , leader of the Social Democratic and Labor_Party , said he realized that Sinn Fein , the legal political arm of the outlawed IRA , would face an enormous challenge in accepting the terms of last month ' s British-Irish peace declaration . The pact offered Sinn Fein a place in peace negotiations if the IRA would lay_down its arms . Hume , the leading Catholic moderate in Northern_Ireland and a member of the_British House of Commons , in a statement to the IRA declared of possible peace talks : &quot; It will require from the republican movement , given the experience that its members have been through , one of the greatest acts of moral courage of this century. &quot; &quot; But at the end of the day , &quot; Hume added , &quot; it is moral courage that gives real leadership and that creates truly historic opportunity. &quot; Hume said that it was time to leave the past behind so that the Ireland of the next century would not be scarred by the gun and bomb , but instead would develop as part of a new Europe . &quot; Let us commit ourselves to spilling our sweat and not our blood , &quot; he declared . Hume ' s stance as a moderate has won him wide support among middle-roaders in Ulster ( as Northern_Ireland is also known ) , Ireland and Britain . His secret talks with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams laid the groundwork for the Downing Street Declaration signed_in London on Dec . 15 by British Prime_Minister John Major and Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds . Hume said that both the_British and Irish governments should be prepared to use methods of communication open_to them to give Sinn Fein whatever clarification the organization needs on the wording of the peace declaration . The Downing Street document specified that talks involving all factions in Northern_Ireland and the_Irish Republic -- including Sinn Fein -- could begin three months after terrorist activities cease . Sinn Fein and the IRA are not expected to respond officially to the call_for talks until later this month . Their representatives have insisted on the right of all people in Ireland to decide the island ' s political future . Major has supported Northern_Ireland ' s Unionists , who want continued British rule_in the province , by stating that no islandwide agreement could be reached without the consent of Ulster ' s million-strong Protestant community . Meanwhile , in Dublin on Tuesday , a letter bomb exploded in offices used by Sinn Fein , injuring two Irish army_officers trying to disarm it , police and army sources said .</TEXT>
