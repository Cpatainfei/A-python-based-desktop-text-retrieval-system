   <HEADLINE> BURL ' S ; NEGOTIATING THE HAZY BORDER BETWEEN THE SEXES , AN 8-YEAR-OLD BOY UNPUZZLES THE SHIFTING LINES OF GENDER AND IDENTITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I loved the restaurant ' s name , a compact curve of a word . Its sign , five big letters rimmed in neon , hovered above the roof . I almost never saw the sign with its neon lit ; my parents took me there for early summer dinners , and even by the time we left -- father cleaning his teeth with a toothpick , mother carrying steak bones in a doggie-bag -- the sky was still bright . Heat rippled off the cars_parked along Hollywood Boulevard , the asphalt gummy from hours of sun . With its sleek architecture , chrome appliances , and arctic temperature , Burl ' s offered a refuge from the street . We usually sat at one of the booths in front of the plate-glass windows . During our dinner , people came_to a halt before the news-vending machine on the corner and burrowed in their pockets and purses for change . The waitresses at Burl ' s wore brown uniforms edged_in checked gingham . From their breast_pockets frothed white lace handkerchiefs . In between reconnaissance missions to the table , they busied themselves behind the counter and shouted &quot; Tuna to travel &quot; or &quot; Scorch that patty &quot; to a harried short-order cook who manned the grill . Miniature pitchers of cream and individual pats of butter were extracted from an industrial refrigerator . Coca-Cola shot from a glinting spigot . Waitresses dodged and bumped one another , frantic as atoms . My parents usually lingered after the meal , nursing cups of coffee while I played with the beads of condensation on my glass of ice_water , tasted Tabasco_sauce , or twisted pieces of my paper napkin into mangled animals . One evening , annoyed with my restlessness , my father gave me a dime and asked me to buy him a Herald Examiner from the vending machine in front of the restaurant . Shouldering open the heavy glass door , I was seared by a sudden gust of heat . Traffic roared past me and stirred the air . Walking toward the newspaper machine , I held the dime so tightly it seemed to melt in my palm . Duty made me feel large and important . I inserted the dime and opened the box , yanking a Herald from the spring contraption that held it as tight as a mousetrap . When I turned_around , paper in_hand , I saw two women walking toward me . Their high heels clicked on the sun-baked pavement . They were tall , broad-shouldered women who moved with a mixture of haste and defiance . They ' d teased their hair into nearly identical black beehives . Dangling earrings flashed in the sun , brilliant as prisms . Each of them wore the kind of clinging , strapless outfit my mother referred to as a cocktail_dress . The silky fabric -- one dress was purple , the other pink -- accentuated their breasts and hips and rippled with insolent highlights . The dresses exposed their bare arms , the slope of their shoulders and the smooth , powdered plane of flesh where their cleavage began . I owned at the time a book called &quot; Things for Boys and Girls to Do. &quot; There were pages to color , intricate mazes and connect-the-dots . But another type of puzzle came_to_mind as I watched those women walking toward me : What ' s Wrong With This Picture ? Say the drawing of a dining_room looked normal at first glance ; , on closer inspection , a chair was missing its leg and the man who sat atop it wore half a pair of glasses . The women had Adam ' s apples . The closer they came , the shallower my breathing . I blocked the sidewalk , an incredulous child stalled in their path . When they saw me staring , they shifted their purses and linked their arms . There was something sisterly and conspiratorial about their sudden closeness . Though their mouths didn ' t move , I thought they might have been communicating without moving their lips , so telepathic did they seem as they joined arms and pressed together , synchronizing their heavy steps . The pages of the Herald fluttered in the wind . I felt them against my arm , light as batted lashes . The woman in pink shot me a haughty glance and yet she seemed pleased that I ' d taken_notice , hungry to be admired by a man , or even an awestruck 8-year-old boy . She tried to stifle a grin , her red lipstick more voluptuous than the lips it painted . Rouge deepened her cheekbones . Eye shadow dusted her lids , a clumsy abundance of blue . Her face was like a page in &quot; Things for Boys and Girls to Do , &quot; colored by a kid who went outside the lines . At close range , I saw that her wig was slightly askew . I was certain it was a wig because my mother owned several ; three Styrofoam heads lined a shelf in my mother ' s closet ; upon them were perched a Page-Boy , an Empress and a Baby-Doll , all_in shades of auburn . The woman in the pink dress wore her wig like a crown of glory . But it was the woman in the purple dress who passed nearest me , and I saw that her jaw was heavily powdered , a half-successful attempt to disguise the telltale shadow of a beard . Just as I noticed this , her heel caught_on a crack in the pavement and she reeled on her stilettos . It was then that I witnessed a rift in her composure , a window through which I could glimpse the shades of maleness that her dress and wig and makeup obscured . She shifted her shoulders and threw_out her hands like a surfer riding a curl . The instant she regained her balance , she smoothed her dress , patted her hair and sauntered onward . Any woman might be a man . The fact of it clanged through the chambers of my brain . In broad day , in the midst of traffic , with my parents drinking coffee a_few feet away , I felt as if everything I understood , everything I had taken_for granted up_to that moment -- the curve of the earth , the heat of the sun , the reliability of my own eyes -- had been squeezed_out of me . Who were those men ? Did they help each other get inside those dresses ? How many other people and things were not what they seemed ? From the back , the impostors looked_like women once again , slinky and curvaceous , purple and pink . I watched them disappear into the distance , their disguises so convincing that other people on the street seemed to take no notice , and for a moment wondered if I had imagined the whole encounter , a visitation by two unlikely muses . Frozen in the middle of the sidewalk , I caught my reflection in the window of Burl ' s , a silhouette floating between his parents . They faced one another across a table . Once the solid embodiments of woman and man , pedestrians and traffic appeared to pass_through them . * There were some mornings , seconds before my eyes opened and my senses gathered into consciousness , that the child I was seemed to hover above the bed , and I couldn ' t tell what form my waking would take -- the body of a boy or the body of a girl . Finally stirring , I ' d blink against the early light and greet each incarnation as a male with mild surprise . My sex , in other words , didn ' t seem to be an absolute fact so_much as a pleasant , recurring accident . By the age of 8 , I ' d experienced this groggy phenomenon several times . Those ethereal moments above my bed made waking_up in the tangled blankets , a boy steeped in body heat , all_the more astonishing . That this might be an unusual experience never occurred to me ; it was one among a flood of sensations I could neither name nor ignore . And so , shocked as I was when those transvestites passed me in front of Burl ' s , they confirmed something about which I already had an inkling : the hazy border between the sexes . My father , after all , raised his pinky when he drank from a teacup , and my mother looked as faded and plain as my father until she fixed her hair and painted her face . Like most children , I once thought it possible to divide the world into male and female columns . Blue / Pink . Rooster / Hens . Trousers / Skirts . Such divisions were easy , not to mention comforting , for they simplified matter into compatible pairs . But there also existed a vast range of things that didn ' t fit neatly into either camp : clocks , milk , telephones , grass . There were nights I fell_into a fitful sleep while trying to sex the world correctly . Nothing typified the realms of male and female as clearly as my parents ' walk-in closets . Home alone for any length of time , I always found my way inside them . I could stare at my parents ' clothes for hours , grateful for the stillness and silence , haunting the very heart of their privacy . The overhead light in my father ' s closet was a bare bulb . Whenever I groped_for the chain in the dark , it wagged back and forth and resisted my grasp . Once the light clicked on , I saw dozens of ties hanging like stalactites . A monogrammed silk bathrobe sagged from a hook , a gift my father had received on a long-ago birthday and , thinking it fussy , rarely wore . Shirts were cramped together along the length of an aluminum pole , their starched sleeves sticking_out as if in a half-hearted gesture of greeting . The medicinal odor of mothballs permeated the boxer shorts that were folded and stacked in a built-in drawer . Immaculate underwear was proof of a tenderness my mother couldn ' t otherwise express ; she may_not have touched my father often , but she laundered his boxers with infinite care . Even back then , I suspected that a sense_of_duty was the final erotic link between them . Sitting in a neat row on the closet floor were my father ' s boots and slippers and dress shoes . I ' d try_on his wingtips and clomp around , slipping out of them with every step . My wary , unnatural stride made me all_the more desperate to effect some authority . I ' d whisper orders to imagined lackeys and take my invisible wife in my arms . But no matter how much I wanted them to fit , those shoes were as cold and hard as marble . My mother ' s shoes were just as uncomfortable , but a lot more fun . From a brightly colored array of pumps and sling-backs , I ' d pick a pair with the glee and deliberation of someone choosing a chocolate . Whatever embarrassment I felt was overwhelmed by the exhilaration of being taller in a pair of high heels . Things will look_like this someday , I said to myself , gazing out from my new and improved vantage_point as if from a crow ' s nest . Calves elongated , arms akimbo , I gauged each step so that I didn ' t fall_over and moved with what might have passed for grace had someone seen me , a possibility I scrupulously avoided by locking the door . Back and forth I went . The longer I wore a pair of heels , the better my balance . In the periphery of my vision , the shelf of wigs looked_like a throng of kindly bystanders . Light streamed down from a high window , causing crystal bottles to glitter , the air ripe with perfume . A makeup mirror above the dressing table invited my self-absorption . Sound was muffled . Time slowed . It seemed as if nothing bad could happen as long as I stayed within those walls . Though I ' d never been discovered in my mother ' s closet , my parents knew that I was drawn toward girlish things -- dolls and jump-rope and jewelry -- as well as_to the games and preoccupations that were expected of a boy . I ' m not sure now if it was my effeminacy itself that bothered them as much as my ability to slide back and forth , without the slightest warning , between male and female mannerisms . After I ' d finished building the model of an F-17 bomber say , I ' d sit_back to examine my handiwork , pursing my lips in concentration and crossing my legs at the knee . One day my mother caught me standing_in the middle of my bedroom doing an imitation of Mary Injijikian , a dark , overeager Armenian girl with whom I believed myself to be in_love , not only because she was pretty , but because I wanted to be like her . Collector of effortless A ' s , Mary seemed to know all_the answers in class . Before the teacher had even finished asking a question , Mary would let_out a little grunt and practically levitate out of her seat , as if her hand were filled with helium . &quot; Could we please hear from someone else today besides Miss Injijikian , &quot; the teacher would say . Miss Injijikian . Those were the words I was repeating over and over to myself when my mother caught me . To utter them was rhythmic , delicious , and under their spell I raised my hand and wiggled like Mary . I heard a cough and spun_around . My mother froze in the doorway . She clutched the folded sheets to her stomach and turned without saying a word . My sudden flush of shame confused me . Weren ' t boys supposed to swoon over girls ? Hadn ' t I seen babbling , heartsick men in a dozen movies ? Shortly after the Injijikian incident , my parents decided to send me to gymnastics class at the Los Angeles Athletic Club , a brick relic of a building on Olive Street . One of the oldest establishments of its kind in Los Angeles , the club prohibited women from the premises . My parents didn ' t have to say it aloud : they hoped a fraternal atmosphere would toughen me up and tilt me toward the male side of my nature . My father drove me Downtown so I could sign_up for the class , meet the instructor and get a tour of the place . On the way there , he reminisced about sports . Since he ' d grown_up in a rough Philadelphia neighborhood , sports consisted_of kick-the-can or rolling a hoop down the street with a stick . The more he talked_about his physical prowess , the more convinced I became that my daydreams and shyness were a disappointment to him . The hushed lobby of the athletic club was paneled in dark wood . A few solitary figures were hidden in wing-chairs . My father and I introduced ourselves to a man at the front desk who seemed unimpressed by our presence . His aloofness unnerved me , which wasn ' t hard considering that , no matter how my parents put it , I knew their sending me here was a form of disapproval , a way of banishing the part of me they didn ' t care to know . A call went_out over the intercom for someone to show us around . While we waited , I noticed that the sand in the standing ashtrays had been raked into perfect furrows . The glossy leaves of the potted plants looked as if they ' d been polished by hand . The place seemed more like a well-tended hotel than an athletic club . Finally , a stoop-shouldered old_man hobbled toward us , his head shrouded in a cloud of white hair . He wore a T-shirt that said &quot; Instructor &quot; ; his arms were so wrinkled and anemic , I thought I might have misread it . While we followed him to the elevator -- it would be easier , he said , than taking the stairs -- I readjusted my expectations , which had involved fantasies of a hulking drill-sergeant barking orders at a flock of scrawny boys . We got_off the elevator on the second floor . The instructor , mumbling to himself and never turning_around to see if we were behind him , showed us where the gymnastics class took_place . I ' m certain the building was big , but the size of the room must be exaggerated by a trick of memory , because when I envision it , I picture a vast and windowless warehouse . Mats covered the wooden floor . Here and there , in remote and lonely pools of light , stood a pommel_horse , a balance_beam and parallel bars . Tiers of bleachers rose into darkness . Unlike the cloistered air of a closet , the room seemed incomplete without a crowd . Next we visited the dressing room , empty except for a naked middle-aged man . He sat on a narrow bench and clipped his formidable toenails . Moles dotted his back . He glistened like a fish . We continued to follow the instructor down an aisle lined with numbered lockers . At the far end , steam billowed from the doorway that led to the showers . Fresh towels stacked on a nearby table made me think_of my mother ; I knew she liked to have me at_home with her -- I was often her only companion -- and I resented her complicity in the plan to send me here . The tour ended when the instructor gave me a sign-up sheet . Only a_few names preceded mine . They were signatures , or so I imagined , of other soft and wayward sons . When the day of the first gymnastics class arrived , my mother gave me money and a gym bag ( along with a clean towel , she ' d packed a banana and a napkin ) and sent me to the corner of Hollywood and Western to wait for a bus . The sun was bright , the traffic heavy . While I sat there , an argument raged inside my head , the familiar , battering debate between the wish to be like other boys and the wish to be like myself . Why shouldn ' t I simply get_up and go_back home , where I ' d be left alone to read and think ? On the other hand , would n ' t life be easier if I liked athletics , or learned to like them ? No sooner did I steel my resolve to get_on the bus than I thought_of something better : I could spend the morning wandering through Woolworth ' s , then tell my parents I ' d gone_to the class . But would my lie stand_up to scrutiny ? As I practiced describing phantom gymnastics -- And then we did cartwheels and boy was I dizzy -- I became aware of a car circling the block . It was a large car in whose shaded interior I could barely make_out the driver , but I thought it might be the man who owned the local pet store . I ' d often gone there on the pretext of looking_at the cocker_spaniel puppies huddled_together in their pen , but I really went_to gawk at the owner , whose tan chest , in the V of his shirt , was the place I most wanted to rest my head . Every time the man moved , counting stock or writing a receipt , his shirt parted , my mouth went dry , and I smelled the musk of sawdust and dogs . I found myself hoping that the driver was the man who ran the pet store . I was thrilled by the unlikely possibility that the sight of me , slumped on a bus bench in my T-shirt and shorts , had caused such a man to circle the block . Up to that point in my life , lovemaking hovered somewhere in the future , an impulse a boy might aspire to but didn ' t indulge . And there I was , sitting on a bus bench in the middle of the city , dreaming I could seduce an adult . I showered the owner of the pet store with kisses and , as aquariums bubbled , birds sang , and mice raced in a wire wheel , slipped my hand beneath his shirt . The roar of traffic brought me to my senses . I breathed deeply and blinked against the sun . I crossed my legs at the knee in_order to hide an erection . My fantasy left me both drained and changed . The continent of sex had drifted closer . The car made another round . This time the driver leaned across the passenger seat and peered at me through the window . He was a complete stranger whose gaze filled me with fear . It wasn ' t the surprise of not recognizing him that frightened me , it was what I did recognize -- the unmistakable shame in his expression , and the weary temptation that drove him in circles . Before the car behind him honked , he mouthed &quot; hello &quot; and cocked his head . What now , he seemed to be asking . A bold , unbearable question . I bolted to my feet , slung the gym bag over my shoulder and hurried toward home . Now and then I turned_around to make_sure he wasn ' t trailing me , both relieved and disappointed when I didn ' t see his car . Even after I became convinced that he wasn ' t at my back -- my sudden flight had scared him off -- I kept turning_around to see what was making me so nervous , as if I might spot the source of my discomfort somewhere on the street . I walked faster and faster , trying to outrace myself . Eventually , the bus I was supposed to have taken roared past . Turning the corner , I watched it bob eastward . Closing the kitchen door behind , me , I vowed never to leave home again . I was resolute in this decision without fully understanding why , or what it was I hoped to avoid ; I was only aware of the need to hide and a vague notion , fading fast , the my trouble had something to do with sex . Already the mechanism of self-deception was at_work . By the time my mother rushed into the kitchen to see why I ' d returned so early , the thrill I ' d felt while waiting for the bus had given_way to indignation . I poured_out the story of the man circling the block and protested , with perhaps too great a passion , my own innocence . &quot; I was just sitting there , &quot; I said again and again . I was so determined to deflect suspicion away from myself , and to justify my missing the class , that I portrayed the man as a grizzled pervert who drunkenly veered from lane to lane as he followed me halfway home . My mother cinched her housecoat . She seemed moved and shocked by what I told her , if a bit incredulous , which prompted me to be more dramatic . &quot; It would n ' t be safe , &quot; I insisted , &quot; for me to wait at the bus_stop again. &quot; No matter how overwrought my story , I knew my mother would n ' t question it , would n ' t bring the subject up again ; sex of any kind , especially sex between a man and a boy , was simply not discussed in our house . The gymnastics class , my parents agreed , was something I could do another time . And so I spent the remainder of that summer at_home with my mother , stirring cake batter , holding the dust pan , helping her fold the sheets . For a while I was proud_of myself for engineering a reprieve from the athletic club . But as the days wore_on , I began to see that my mother had wanted me with her all along , and forcing that to happen wasn ' t such a feat . Soon a sense of compromise set_in ; by expressing disgust for the man in the car , I ' d expressed disgust for an aspect of myself . Now I had all_the time in the world to sit around and contemplate my desire for men . The days grew long and stifling and hot , an endless sentence of self-examination . Only trips to the pet store offered any respite . Every time I went there , I was too electrified with longing to think_about longing in the abstract . The bell tinkled above the door , animals stirred within their cages , and the handsome owner glanced up from his work . * I handed my father the Herald . He opened the paper and disappeared behind it . My mother stirred her coffee and sighed . She gazed at the sweltering passers-by and probably thought herself lucky . I slid into the vinyl booth and took my place beside my parents . For a moment , I considered asking them about what had happened on the street , but they would have reacted with censure and alarm , and I sensed there was more to the story than they ' d ever be willing to tell me . Men in dresses were only the tip of the iceberg . Who knew what other wonders existed -- a boy , for example , who wanted to kiss a man -- exceptions the world did its best to keep hidden . It would be years before I heard the word transvestite , so I struggled to find a word for what I ' d seen . He-she came_to_mind , as lilting as Injijikian . Burl ' s would have been perfect , like boys and girls spliced together , but I can ' t claim to have thought of this back then . I must have looked stricken as I tried to figure it all out , because my mother put_down her coffee_cup and asked if I was OK . She stopped just short of feeling my forehead . I assured her I was fine , but something within me had shifted , had given_way to a heady doubt . When the waitress came and slapped down our check -- &quot; Thank You , &quot; it read , &quot; Dine out more often &quot; -- I wondered if her lofty hairdo or the breasts on which her name_tag quaked were real . Wax carnations bloomed at every table . Phony wood paneled the walls . Plastic food sat in a display_case : fried_eggs , a hamburger sandwich , a sundae topped with a garish cherry .</TEXT>
