   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OJAI ; COUNTY BACKS SUIT AGAINST RADAR TOWER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County will express support in federal_court for a lawsuit aimed at shutting_down a radiation-emitting weather tower in Ojai , officials said Tuesday . The Board of Supervisors authorized attorneys to file an amicus curiae brief with the U . S . 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after discussing the issue in closed_session Tuesday , said County Counsel James L . McBride . The board will argue in the brief that the federal_government should have followed regular planning procedures and conducted public hearings before installing the 98-foot-tall radar tower atop Sulphur Mountain , McBride said . &quot; Had the government gone_through the regular process of acquiring a conditional use permit , there would have been an opportunity for the public to have some input , &quot; McBride said . &quot; But that didn ' t happen. &quot; In April , U . S . District Judge Terry J . Hatter Jr . threw_out a lawsuit filed by Ojai residents seeking to shut_down the National Weather Service tower until more health studies are completed . Hatter said there was no evidence to support residents ' claims that the government intentionally misled local officials about the weather-tracking radar . But members of the Environmental Coalition of Ojai contend in their lawsuit against the government that the tower poses a health risk because it emits harmful levels of radiation . Federal_officials say this is not the case . Following Hatter ' s decision , the coalition decided to take its case to the U . S . 9th Circuit Court of Appeals . CARLOS V . LOZANO</TEXT>
