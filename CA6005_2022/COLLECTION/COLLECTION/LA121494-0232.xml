   <HEADLINE> BIGOTS ' GROWING USE OF COMPUTER_NETWORKS ASSAILED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alarmed by the growing presence of hate groups in cyberspace , the Simon Wiesenthal Center Tuesday sent a letter to the Prodigy on-line computer service protesting the &quot; continued use of Prodigy by bigots to promote their agendas of hate. &quot; The Los Angeles-based center said it has tracked increasing activity over the last few months by more_than 50 hate groups using on-line services and the popular Internet global computer_network . &quot; More and more of these groups are embracing and utilizing the information superhighway , &quot; said Rabbi Abraham Cooper , associate dean of the center . &quot; The slurs are the same but the venue is different. &quot; The center called_on commercial on-line services to keep hate groups out and proposed that the government play a similar policing role on the amorphous Internet . Of particular concern , Cooper said , is that young people could be exposed to white_supremacy in an environment unmediated by teachers , parents or librarians . Much of the activity takes_place on open electronic forums accessible to anyone with an Internet account or a subscription to a commercial service . About 20 million computer users are connected to the Internet , and another 5 million use commercial on-line services , including more_than 2 million on Prodigy . But civil libertarians -- and white_supremacists themselves -- say that cyberspace , like any other medium of expression , must remain open_to free speech . And in an uncharted territory where the rules of engagement are still unformed , the center ' s offensive is sure to sharpen the ongoing debate over electronic censorship . &quot; It ' s a genuinely difficult problem , &quot; says Marc Rotenberg , director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center , an on-line civil_liberties organization . &quot; And there are no paradigms to turn to. &quot; It ' s a problem that is quickly becoming relevant to a lot more people . All sorts of enterprises , from businesses to charity organizations , have been rushing to get hooked_up to computer_networks , which offer fast , convenient communication at increasingly lower prices . But for white_supremacist groups like the National Alliance and the American Renaissance , cyberspace offers benefits that are proportionately far greater . Marginalized by traditional media and short on funds , hate groups have been learning to use low-cost on-line communications to gain recruits and spread propaganda across state and even national boundaries , giving them access to a far wider audience than they have historically been able to reach . Valerie Fields , for example , a West Los Angeles resident and political junkie , signs_on to her Prodigy account a_few times a week to read the discussion of local politics . Last month , she clicked her way into the &quot; News &quot; forum to find an anti-Latino diatribe that closed with a plug for a $ 20 subscription to the newsletter of Louisville , Ky.-based American Renaissance . &quot; Around the election the messages about ( Prop. ) 187 got pretty nasty , &quot; Fields said . &quot; But then I saw this one that seemed to be from an organized white_supremacist group , and that really freaked me out. &quot; The message Fields saw , and several others , including one that referred to &quot; The Diary of Anne Frank &quot; as a &quot; Jewish hoax &quot; prompted the Wiesenthal Center to ask Prodigy to strengthen its guidelines to delete such messages from its boards . &quot; We ' re having a discussion with them , &quot; Prodigy spokesman Brian Ek said Tuesday afternoon . &quot; Our feeling is we already have a good system in place . But we have more_than 1.7 million notes on the board at any given time , and we can ' t read them all. &quot; Prodigy was the focus of controversy involving anti-Semitic comments in 1991 , and worked with the Anti-Defamation League at the time to craft a policy that forbids &quot; blatant expressions of hatred &quot; on its boards . All messages are also run_through a computer that scans for obscenities before they are posted . But Cooper says the service should look more carefully at messages that target groups rather than individuals . Prodigy is not the only on-line service to be utilized by hate groups . Kevin Strom , who produces a weekly radio show for the National Alliance , and has been_active on-line , said he was recently blocked from the &quot; Political &quot; and &quot; Issues &quot; forums on Compuserve . &quot; Apparently somebody complained that our articles were bashing ethnic minorities , &quot; Strom says . &quot; So the system operator decided we didn ' t deserve freedom of speech. &quot; Strom says the articles he posted on the forums were among those which users transferred most frequently to their home computers . One titled &quot; The Wisdom of Henry_Ford , &quot; which reviewed the book &quot; The International Jew , &quot; was downloaded 120 times one week , he said . Compuserve leaves the decision of what to screen_out to the individual &quot; sysops &quot; who are hired to moderate the service ' s discussion forums . Says Georgia Griffith , the Politics sysop : &quot; We don ' t block users for what they believe or say , but how they say it . The First_Amendment allows people to publish what they choose , but we are not obliged to publish it for them. &quot; The legal issue of who is ultimately responsible_for what does get &quot; published &quot; on-line is a thorny one that has yet to be entirely resolved . A federal judge ruled_in 1991 that Compuserve was like a bookstore owner who could not be held accountable for the contents of books on his shelves -- a precedent the on-line services support . But activists say there are ethical issues at stake , which public_opinion can help to enforce -- at least in the private sector . The Internet , a web of several hundred computer_networks not owned by any one enterprise , is a more difficult proposition . Cooper wrote a letter to Federal Communications Chairman Reed E . Hundt last summer suggesting that it &quot; may be time for the FCC to place a cop on the Superhighway of Information. &quot; But such an effort would involve significant technical difficulties , and would also likely encounter vehement opposition from civil_liberties groups who want to preserve the Internet as a democratic forum that provides open . Because of its anarchic structure , the Internet has generally been viewed_as a &quot; common_carrier &quot; much like the telephone_company , which cannot be held liable for what passes_over its lines . &quot; That would be a very dangerous path to go_down , &quot; says EPIC ' s Rotenberg . It would lead to an extraordinary amount of censorship and control that would be very inappropriate. &quot; Discussion groups geared toward white_supremacist propaganda on the Internet have labels such_as &quot; skinheads , &quot; &quot; revisionism &quot; and &quot; vigilantes. &quot; The Institute for Historical Review recently set_up a site on the World Wide Web portion of the Internet , where some of its literature can be obtained for free . A document called &quot; Frequently Asked Questions about National_Socialism &quot; is available at several sites . The computer commands used on the Internet also allow users to access information anonymously , which far-right activists say helps many to overcome the inhibitions they might have about signing_up . The National Alliance rents space on a computer at Netcom On-line Communication Services , one of the largest Internet access providers in California , where texts of its radio programs are available . It has also posted flyers on the Internet promoting its radio show , urging readers to send &quot; minority parasites packing to fend_for themselves &quot; and condemning community development funding as support for black &quot; breeding colonies. &quot; &quot; We ' ve seen a huge growth in_use of the Internet by our people , &quot; says Alliance Chairman William Pierce . &quot; The major media in this country are very biased against our political point_of_view . They present us with ridicule or in a very distorted way . The information superhighway is much more free_of censorship . It ' s possible for a dedicated individual to get his message out_to thousands and thousands of people. &quot;</TEXT>
