   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW / NONFICTION ; A CLOSE-UP VIEW OF ANOTHER KIND OF NATURAL DESTRUCTION ; THE SCARIEST PLACE ON EARTH : EYE TO EYE WITH HURRICANES BY DAVID E . FISHER ; RANDOM HOUSE $ 23 , 250 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here in California , we worry about earthquakes , brush_fires and floods , but David E . Fisher ' s &quot; The Scariest Place on Earth &quot; is about a natural disaster of an entirely different magnitude . &quot; Let me tell you , &quot; he writes , &quot; about hurricanes. &quot; A hurricane killed more_than half a_million people in the Bay_of_Bengal in 1970 -- &quot; more_than were killed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Dresden and London combined , &quot; Fisher points_out . And a hurricane is a perfectly routine meteorological phenomenon that beggars the destructive power of human technology : &quot; The energy released in just one decent-sized hurricane is as much as that in 500 # 000 atom bombs. &quot; Lest we take ourselves and our natural perils too seriously , Fisher invites us to spend a_few days of terror in South Florida : &quot; The scariest place on earth , &quot; he insists , &quot; is directly in the path of an onrushing category 5 hurricane. &quot; that ' s where Fisher and millions of other Floridians found themselves in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew roared through Miami and then headed toward Louisiana , leaving a path of devastation that has been characterized as twice as destructive as the 1994 Northridge earthquake . Fisher ' s book is a dramatic , day-by-day account of Hurricane Andrew , but it ' s also an opportunity for the author to explore the natural_history of hurricanes in rich and fascinating detail . Fisher explains how and why hurricanes happen , how they are tracked and measured , and , intriguingly , what we may be able to do to control or eliminate them -- someday . &quot; The Scariest Place on Earth &quot; harks all_the way back to Genghis Khan , whose invasion of Japan in 1274 was foiled by a typhoon -- and Fisher pauses to explain that a typhoon is what hurricanes are called when they occur in the Pacific_Ocean rather than in the Atlantic_Ocean . Then Fisher zips forward to World_War_II , when Adm . &quot; Bull &quot; Halsey relied_on some misinterpreted weather data in_ordering a task_force to sail directly into a monster typhoon -- an error in judgment that resulted in the loss of three warships and nearly 800 sailors . Fortuitously , the early efforts to predict weather at_sea in World_War_II -- and the availability of war-surplus ships and planes after the war -- led to rapid progress in the study of hurricanes , and so did the intelligence-gathering in the upper atmosphere during the era of nuclear testing . Still , as recently as 1956 , hurricanes were still described by one scientist as &quot; one of the great mysteries of the sea. &quot; &quot; Today , we know pretty well how a hurricane works , &quot; Fisher deadpans . &quot; How to stop it is another matter. &quot; With the assistance of a collection of drawings that may remind you of a high_school science textbook , Fisher explains how the Earth ' s climate is governed by the temperature and movement of both air and water . Some terms that we may know only from literature and poetry -- the trade_winds , the_doldrums , the horse_latitudes -- are given new meaning in the context of meteorology , and we learn that &quot; between the_doldrums and the horse_latitudes is where hurricanes form. &quot; Fisher is described by his publisher as a novelist , a playwright , an actor and a scientist who specializes in marine geology , environmental_science and something called &quot; cosmochemistry. &quot; His background may help to explain his engaging prose style ; he is one science writer who invokes the poetry of William Butler Yeats and the Second Law of Thermodynamics with the same ease and grace . The account of Hurricane Andrew is peppered with bursts of outrage about the terrible but unnecessary destruction that resulted from lack of preparedness . According to Fisher , the strict building_codes in South Florida were &quot; practically guaranteed to make buildings hurricane-proof , &quot; but the fact that no hurricanes had hit Florida since 1966 resulted in a dangerous complacency . &quot; I hate to be cynical or mean-spirited , &quot; writes the otherwise easygoing Fisher , &quot; but I just could not see all those Florida building contractors obeying the construction code every year and spending_money to make buildings safe against a hurricane that hadn ' t come since God-knew-when. &quot; &quot; The Scariest Place on Earth &quot; will be reassuring to some readers in Southern California -- hurricanes , after all , are one natural disaster we don ' t have to worry about . But Fisher ' s fulminations about preparedness in_general , and disaster-proof building construction in particular , hold a special resonance in a place where apartment_buildings and parking structures and freeway overpasses shouldn ' t have fallen_down in an earthquake -- but did .</TEXT>
