   <TEXT> WHAT ABOUT ' BOBS ' ? Anyone familiar_with the German obsession for politics would think there is nothing that could have more news value in 1994 than the 19 national and regional elections planned for the Fatherland . Nothing except &quot; Bobs , &quot; that is . &quot; Bobs &quot; is the name this nation ' s boulevard press has already given to the eagerly awaited first child of recently married tennis star Boris Becker and his German-American bride , Barbara Feltus . In fact , the expectant parents have yet to choose a name for their baby -- scheduled to arrive in mid-January . But that didn ' t stop some clever headline writer who combined parts of the parents ' first_names to come_up with &quot; Bobs. &quot; When Barbara recently let slip she was expecting a girl , the German media simply added an &quot; i &quot; and continued gushing about &quot; Bobsi &quot; . For the 26-year-old former Wimbledon champion , the birth will be a pleasant diversion from his tennis game , which has been in the_doldrums for months . &quot; I ' m only thinking baby , baby , baby , &quot; admitted Becker recently after crashing out of the Grand_Slam Cup in Munich in the first round . &quot; He ' s playing as if he ' s the one who ' s pregnant , &quot; quipped German Olympic swimmer Franziska van Almsick .
