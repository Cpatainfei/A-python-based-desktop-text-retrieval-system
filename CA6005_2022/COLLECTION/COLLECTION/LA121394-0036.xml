   <HEADLINE> THE ENVIRONMENT ; COST CONCERNS GET RUSSIA RECYCLING ; THOUGH THE MOTIVE IS MORE FINANCIAL THAN ECOLOGICAL , MUSCOVITES ARE REUSING DISCARDS SUCH AS PAPER , SCRAP METAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eco-marketing means little to Mikhail Ostreyov . A veteran Soviet papermaker , Ostreyov suspects that pushing a product as &quot; environmentally friendly &quot; isn ' t the way to make money in the Russian market , where price is everything and ecological correctness counts for little . But he does believe that recycled paper may be profitable in Russia simply because it is cheaper to produce . Old paper , he says , sells for half the price of raw papermaking materials . His new papermaking company , Khimlesprom , recently began experimenting with Russia ' s first office paper recycling project . The idea came from Ecologia , an East European-American nonprofit group . Ecologia sponsored a study showing that such a project could make money in Moscow . When Oleg Cherp , Ecologia ' s program director in the former Soviet_Union , approached Ostreyov with the idea , the papermaker wasn ' t convinced . But now he is willing to give_it_a_try . &quot; If you look_at the money we earn from different types of work we do , then currently recycling brings_in very little , &quot; Ostreyov said . &quot; But I feel that in the near future it will make economic sense. &quot; Ostreyov ' s rule_of_thumb is a reliable guide for the small but growing number of environmental groups trying to promote recycling in Russia ' s emerging market_economy : If it won ' t turn a profit or at least pay_for itself , don ' t even think_about it . Although the Soviet_Union was one of the world ' s worst eco-offenders , it had a system for recycling and reusing the few consumer goods it produced . In some years , one could not get a full vodka bottle without turning_in an empty one . Beverage bottles were washed and reused , comrades exchanged used paper for coupons with which they could get hard-to-find books . Communist Young Pioneers collected scrap metal to make train cars . With the market_economy came an onslaught of_imported goods packaged in plastics , laminated paper , aluminum cans and glass bottles in Western shapes and sizes that cannot be reprocessed here . Meanwhile , environmentalists say , the old collection system broke_down , and the old rewards don ' t interest people anymore . There is no shortage of books now , and the Young Pioneers have disbanded . As a result , Russia today is awash in garbage . Moscow alone will produce about 18 million tons of domestic waste this year , according to the capital ' s regional waste management department . Almost all_of that garbage just gets dumped -- along streets and in empty lots as well as in municipal dumps outside the city . If office paper recycling proves profitable , at least some of the new garbage will not wind_up in the dumps . Cherp sees the venture as a way to close the recycling loop -- a challenge met neither by the Soviets nor by many Westerners . &quot; An environmentalist probably would n ' t call ( the Soviet system ) recycling , because they didn ' t produce paper from paper . They produced cardboard and some building_materials and very low-quality wrapping_paper , &quot; he said . &quot; They didn ' t have the facilities to do good-quality paper from recycled paper. &quot; Khimlesprom is one of the few companies in the former Soviet_Union that can produce high-quality paper from post-consumer scrap . Ostreyov says he can recycle office paper up_to seven times , and oversaw a test run_for Ecologia at a factory north of Moscow . But the project is still in the experimental stage . Cherp found a commercial hauler to collect and store scrap paper , contract_out the recycling into office paper and sell it back to organizations recruited by Ecologia . So far , more_than 1 1 / 2 tons of waste have been collected . If enough offices buy the recycled paper in bulk , the project will become commercially viable and Ecologia will pull_out , leaving_office paper recycling to expand or contract with the market.. The paper donors so far are Russian environmental organizations and Western offices , including the U.S. Embassy . Ecologia started with organizations already in the habit of sorting and whose employees may welcome environmentally friendly products . &quot; Fortunately or unfortunately , Russian businessmen copy a lot of things from the West , and they try to have a very good image among Western partners , &quot; Cherp says . &quot; So I think they would copy this attitude to recycled products. &quot; But the whims of the market often interfere . This fall , for example , Khimlesprom interrupted the recycling project for a more profitable one -- producing paper for textbooks for the new school_year . Other new , small-scale recycling projects in Russia are finding that the economics of recycling are as important as the ecology . Students in a village in Bashkortostan , in the Urals , wanted to collect glass and paper to keep them from ending_up in dumps in their streets and a nearby swamp . But local authorities couldn ' t help pay to haul the stuff to a processing plant a_few hours ' drive_away . &quot; They say they have too many other things to do , &quot; said Marina Laskina , a former teacher there . Laskina got a start-up grant from the Institute of Soviet-American Relations , a U.S. nonprofit organization , and many of the village families agreed to pay 3 # 000 rubles ( just under a dollar ) per person per year for pickups that started in late November . But that money in addition to what the plant pays_for the glass and paper is not enough to cover the students ' transport costs , and Laskina acknowledges that the project may be in_trouble when the grant money runs_out . In Kazan , an industrial city on the upper Volga , a recycling club of youths known as &quot; Ants &quot; has solved the economic question by picking_up scrap metal , which is valuable and plentiful in Russia . The club can easily make $ 1 # 000 per week selling it to factories . &quot; People are throwing money on the street , &quot; said club leader Alexander Dorofeyev . &quot; It used to be all communal property . But now they ' re beginning to realize they can ' t just toss it out. &quot; Dorofeyev has secured contracts with two large factories that want all_the metal the Ants can collect . He doesn ' t reap the profits . They are used to maintain the club ' s truck , finance environmental expeditions and pay the kids who gather the scrap . About half_a_dozen adolescents collect scrap each day in the winter , quadruple that number in the summer , says Dorofeyev , who organized the club to keep the streets clean not only of trash but of idle kids . &quot; We have a strong mafia in Kazan , &quot; he said . &quot; This gives structure to 12- or 14-year-old kids with alcoholic fathers , or no fathers. &quot; Recycling projects that do not break_even won ' t fly in Russia -- including some that might be workable in a less confusing economy . When environmentalists with Earth Day Russia learned that the country had no technology to recycle aluminum cans , they tried to send them back to Western Europe where they came from . But export tariffs on metals made_it too expensive . Aluminum cans are one of the most abundant pieces of trash in the new Russia . Once so unusual that they were displayed in Russian living_rooms as decoration , beer and pop cans now litter city streets . While few local or regional governments in Russia have any money to start recycling projects , some remain from the Soviet system . The Experimental Factory of Mechanized Household Waste in St . Petersburg , which turns about 900 # 000 cubic_meters of garbage per year into compost , is the only state-sponsored facility of its kind in the country . The compost is sold to farms , but sales don ' t nearly cover costs . Some environmentally sound habits survive from the Soviet era too . One is the tradition of bringing your own bag to the market . Sturdy plastic bags cost 10 to 15 cents in most shops , although they are free at a_few Western-style supermarkets . Most Russians wash and reuse their plastic bags until they are_full of holes . Although Soviet-built bottle-washing sites cannot handle imports , people can still get a_few rubles for turning_in Russian-made beer , vodka or wine_bottles . Many of Russia ' s new poor spend their days at garbage_dumps , scavenging for these treasures . More on Ecology While Moscow battles economic chaos , environmental woes ravage the provinces . Public health is in jeopardy , and children pay a grim price . Reprints of &quot; Ecological Russian Roulette &quot; are available from Times on Demand .
