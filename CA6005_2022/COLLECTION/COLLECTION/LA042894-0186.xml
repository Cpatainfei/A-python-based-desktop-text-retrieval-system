   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : KITTEN SEASON ; IT ' S THE TIME OF YEAR FEMALES ARE IN HEAT , WITH MALES ON THE PROWL . GETTING YOUR CAT FIXED MAY BE THE HUMANE THING TO DO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It begins with Lulu . A scrawny homeless cat who appeared at our back_door about a year ago , her sad-sack face pressed against the glass_in an overwrought but convincing plea for food . My wife , a hopeless sucker for cats , immediately grabs a can of tuna . I urge her to reconsider . One whiff will be enough to persuade Lulu to become a permanent fixture at the back_door , I argue , and we already have a cat , an obstinate 16-year-old female named Amanda who has one eye and an incurable habit of picking_at the carpet for attention . I like cats and appreciate their independence and cleanliness , but I don ' t need another one . My wife , however , can ' t resist those mopey saucer eyes . The young tabby gets her tuna and , of course , makes herself a regular dinner guest . Becoming our de_facto outdoor cat , she hangs_out in the back yard for part of the day , then dines al fresco before fading into the night . Then Lulu brings Peewee . An undernourished runt , Peewee is probably 6 months old , with short legs and an expression even more pathetic than Lulu ' s . Is she Lulu ' s daughter ? A pal from the wrong side of the tracks ? When my wife begins using words like adorable , cute and cuddly to describe the feral kitten , I try getting used to the idea of three cats . But not for long . Peewee is so tiny . . . so fragile . . . so pregnant . No wonder Peewee rides so low to the ground and acts shell-shocked most of the time . She was only 4 or 5 months old , a kitten going_into heat for the first time , when a brutish male chased her down and sent her on_the_road to motherhood . One day she ' s slinking down my driveway , the next she ' s prancing toward our house , leading four gerbil-size fur balls . Overnight , the roll_call at dinner changes drastically : Amanda , an only cat all her life , learns to share , but not very graciously , with Lulu , Peewee and the fearful foursome of G . I . Joe , Teddy , Chili and Wussy . Every time we forget to close the back_door , terror ensues . Cats pop_out of closets without warning . Cats mistake the bathtub for the litter box . Cats get trapped under the dishwasher . Cats chase cats in a feline version of demolition derby . Catastrophe . Cats reach critical mass in our lives . As the kittens progress through various stages of cuteness , my wife and I take turns assigning blame for our predicament . Had she let me shoo Lulu the first time the animal appeared , the wolf_pack would be someone else ' s problem by now . Had I booted the little beggar , I would have been a Neanderthal . However , had some fool thought to fix his tomcat a_few years ago , none of this would have happened in the first place . The cats purr sweetly and work their charm on us . Growing increasingly attached_to them , we keep postponing the trip to the pound or the hard-sell , basket-o ' -kittens approach at Vons . We spend a_few hundred dollars getting three of them fixed , along with Peewee and Lulu ( Wussy is too spooked to catch ) . Finally , when their obnoxious antics -- such_as foraging in neighbors ' kitchens -- begin drawing complaints , we can ' t wait any longer . Some of the seven will have to go , but which ones ? Do we make lists ? Draw names from a hat ? Lulu and Peewee make_it easy by accepting offers from empathetic neighbors ; we manage to place G . I . Joe with an adoring young family in another county ; Teddy displaces Amanda on our couch , and Amanda goes_to live_in a carton behind the garage ( I ' m not making this up ) . This cautionary tale , however , doesn ' t have an entirely happy ending . Chili and Wussy are missing . Chili bolted and hasn ' t been seen since ; Wussy is gone , rumored to have been remanded to an orchard by the anti-cat squad across the street . I can ' t say I really miss Chili and Wussy , but every day about dinner time , I glance out the back_door expecting to see those wayward scamps with their pink noses pressed against the glass , begging for a handout . Population Explosion It happens every spring . Female cats go_into heat and males go_on the prowl , the ensuing courtship sparking a feline population explosion 63 days later . Lulu is no doubt a survivor of the class of ' 91 . Peewee is a ' 92 graduate . But most strays don ' t find happy homes ; usually , they die a cruel and premature death as road kill or coyote lunch . Or they just starve to death . The best these unwanted cats can usually hope for -- outside of a miraculous adoption -- is a merciful one-way trip on sodium pentobarbital . Every year in Ventura County , a_few thousand cats are humanely destroyed by lethal injection ; last year , a total of 4 # 629 were euthanized by county Animal Regulation in Camarillo and the Humane Society in Ojai . The mass destruction of these beautiful animals is agonizing to cat lovers and animal activists , but it also angers them because the slaughter could be drastically reduced if owners simply spayed or neutered their pets . that ' s a message the Humane Society and Animal Regulation have been trying to get_out for years -- the Humane Society made 545 presentations at schools last year . But the public apparently hasn ' t been listening : The annual number of euthanized cats remains about the same . &quot; People just don ' t get_it , &quot; fumes Kathy Jenks , Animal Regulation director . &quot; Every year , we get these people who let their cats get pregnant so their kids can experience birth , then they come_in here with a box of kittens , grinning like they ' re doing us a favor . Talk_about morons ! &quot; Did we mention that cat people are angry ? &quot; It ' s hard not to be angry , &quot; says Jolene Hoffman , shelter director of the Humane Society . &quot; Especially when we ' ve got low-cost clinics making_it so inexpensive to get the animals fixed. &quot; For every cat euthanized at the pound , countless abandoned cats try to survive on_their_own , most living short lives under homes and in river areas , orchards , dumps and alleys . Although a healthy female can have three litters a year , strays have enough trouble keeping themselves , let alone a family , alive . If predators and starvation don ' t kill these unwanted animals , cars and abscesses -- from internecine warfare -- usually do . And &quot; kittens born in the wild don ' t stand a chance , &quot; says Joyce George , president of the Humane Society . Cat lovers break_into a cold_sweat thinking_of all_the terrible fates befalling felines who don ' t find loving homes . It ' s a jungle out there . &quot; There are a lot of low-life , dirt-bag people who want to hurt cats , &quot; says Simon Oswitch , founder of Ventura-based Animal Emancipation , a small nonprofit organization dedicated to saving doomed cats and dogs . During the height of kitten season in mid-summer , newspaper classified sections contain columns of ads offering &quot; free cats to a good home. &quot; But according to experts , these kittens can wind_up in the hands of dealers who sell them for medical experimentation , or weirdos who use them for satanic rituals , or sadists who torture and kill them . &quot; I heard of a guy ( in the county ) who used 14 kittens a day to teach his pit bull how to fight , &quot; Hoffman says . &quot; I know of people feeding kittens to snakes . You should beware before you give your kittens away . If you were irresponsible to let your cat have kittens , then at least be responsible and check_out the people you ' re giving them to. &quot; House_cats are as vulnerable as strays if allowed outside . &quot; Indoor cats live longer , but try telling that to people , &quot; Jenks says . Kitten season has just begun . How can you tell ? Those yowls outside your bedroom window at 4 a.m. should be the first clue . You ' ve also probably noticed your normally aloof house_cat acting affectionately , purring uncontrollably and vibrating her tail . She ' s in heat , and you should get her fixed before letting her out or you will surely become a godfather . Cats in heat almost always get pregnant , sometimes by more_than one male . Females release a chemical when in heat , attracting every eligible male on the block , and can be in heat for months , or until they get pregnant . Tomcats fight to see which one mates with a female . At the peak of kitten season , the Humane Society receives several litters a week . The arrival of kittens at the shelter makes the older cats undesirable for adoption , sealing their fate . &quot; This not a good time for the staff , &quot; Hoffman says . &quot; You feed these cats , you pet them and then you have to put them down . The staff has the hardest_time . You see signs of depression and extra stress . If anybody has vacation , now is the time to take it. &quot; Animal activists are also busy during kitten season . Animal Emancipation is one of several organizations in the county ( see sidebar ) that places unwanted pets . Last year , it found homes for about 30 cats . New owners must sign contracts promising to take_care of their new pet &quot; and , if they balk , no animal , &quot; Oswitch says . Oswitch ' s group also supports several cat colonies in secret locations in the county , including three in the city of Ventura . Each colony is made_up of 10 to 12 wild cats , all neutered or spayed . The cats are fed regularly , but otherwise fend_for themselves . It ' s not an easy life , but it beats the alternative . Oswitch says : &quot; A cat can have a bit of a quality_of_life instead of euthanasia. &quot; For cat overpopulation to be solved , some experts say , government will have to get involved . A 1992 ordinance requiring all outdoor cats over 6 months to be spayed or neutered has been successful in San Mateo County , which destroyed 1 # 200 fewer cats the year the law took_effect . &quot; It ' s been a struggle in ( Ventura ) county to get people to fix their animals , &quot; Oswitch says . &quot; We need an ordinance with criminal penalties to wake people up. &quot; But Ventura County has never considered an ordinance like San Mateo ' s . &quot; It would be absolutely unenforceable , &quot; Jenks says . &quot; There are no officers enforcing ( existing ) animal ordinances , so why add another one ? &quot; Jenks believes that public awareness is the key . &quot; People seem to think having a pet is an inalienable right , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s not . It ' s a privilege. &quot; A Low-Cost Way to Stop Overpopulation The numbers are mind-boggling : According to the Humane Society , one female cat and her offspring can produce 420 # 000 cats in only seven years . Spaying and neutering will end cat overpopulation . To encourage cat owners , Ventura County Animal Regulation in Camarillo offers $ 20 vouchers , good at any veterinary hospital ; the Humane Society in Ojai provides low-cost clinics Mondays through Thursdays , charging $ 20 for males and $ 25 for females . Most vets charge about $ 50 to spay a female and $ 35 to neuter a male . Organizations in the county that can help you adopt or place a cat : SPAN ( 646-1919 ) , Animal Emancipation ( 652-1910 ) , Adopt A Pet ( 527-8238 ) , the Humane Society ( 646-6505 ) , Ventura County Animal Regulation ( 388-4341 ) , Humane Animal Rescue Team ( 524-4542 ) , Pet Assistance Foundation ( 583-6143 ) .</TEXT>
