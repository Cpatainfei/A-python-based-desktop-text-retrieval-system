   <HEADLINE> DAM-BUILDING FERVOR WANES IN U.S. BUT PICKS_UP STEAM IN THIRD_WORLD ; ENVIRONMENT : EVEN THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION IS GETTING OUT OF THE BUSINESS . MASSIVE PROJECTS ARE CONSIDERED TOO HARD ON PEOPLE , ECOSYSTEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dam it . Dirty words today -- they have become so sensitive that some of the biggest dam builders in the nation and the world don ' t even want to whisper them . Not only is the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation , once one of the premier dam builders in the American West , out of the dam-building business ; its spokesmen say it no longer acts_as technical consultant for such colossal foreign projects as China ' s Three Gorges Dam . The world ' s largest hydroelectric project , the dam is expected to cost at least $ 10 billion , displace a_million people , destroy a natural wonder on the Yangtze_River and take 15 years to complete . The World_Bank , the single largest international source of money for water_projects , is financing fewer and fewer dams , because they have become so controversial , sources say . The bank recently canceled the final portion of its loan for India ' s Sardar Sarovar Dam , which rivals the Three Gorges in scale and impact . Giant dam projects have proliferated in the last 50 years as the primary means of supplying water and generating hydropower -- often without regard_to social and ecological consequences . Environmentalists contend that U.S. experts shouldn ' t compound past ecological catastrophes by continuing to provide engineering models to the rest of the dam-building world . Worldwide , more_than 35 # 000 large dams rise above 50 feet in_height , and more_than 110 giants , classified as &quot; megadams , &quot; tower higher than 450 feet . Two-thirds of the megadams built_in the 1980s are in developing countries . Soaring nearly 1 # 000 feet , the Nurek Dam in former Soviet Tajikistan is the highest anywhere . What U.S. dam builders accomplished in less than half a century is considered so extraordinary that it can be compared to a geological force -- except that it happened almost overnight . &quot; The mightiest thing ever built by a man , &quot; Woody Guthrie sang in 1941 of Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state , which has the greatest megawatt output in the United States and the third-largest in the world . The Tennessee Valley Authority , created in 1933 , controls 47 dams that generate power for a once underdeveloped region , helps control flooding , fills reservoirs for water_sports and eases river navigation . About 75 # 000 dams of all sizes operate in the United States . But the glow has gone_off water_development . Many of the best sites have been used_up . Only 9 % of river miles in the lower 48 states remain undeveloped , said Kevin J . Coyle , president of American Rivers , a conservation organization . The belief that big projects serve everyone has been tarnished by the image of rampant congressional pork_barrel . Power dams in particular upset ecosystems . And many people regret the dam-caused loss of scenic wonders such_as Glen Canyon on the Colorado_River in Arizona . &quot; The big trend now is dam removal . We are moving beyond the view that dams , once built , are a permanent feature of the landscape , &quot; said Matthew Huntington of American Rivers . Although the &quot; age of dams &quot; has ended in the United States , massive dam-building continues virtually unabated in developing countries . With an international- community-be-damned posture , some national governments such_as Malaysia ' s are bypassing the World_Bank and financing multibillion-dollar dams on_their_own . The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation ' s research laboratory in Denver has produced models and blueprints for water_projects all around the world . With its new mandate to engage in water-resource management and environmental restoration , the bureau is winding down its technical-support effort overseas , said Lisa Guide , a bureau spokeswoman in Washington . &quot; Large-scale water-retention basins ( dams ) are no longer economically and environmentally feasible , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s ironic that as the United States downsizes its dam-building , the developing countries are building dams using our approach and models , &quot; said Deborah Moore , a staff scientist for the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund . &quot; We are now seeing the long-term effects , and others are not learning from these lessons . If we had it to do over , we ' d probably do_it differently. &quot; The World_Bank ' s new international water resources management policy , announced in mid-September , states that the bank will take &quot; a comprehensive approach &quot; to solving water scarcity , pollution and environmental problems . Such an approach would consider the ecological impact on entire watersheds . But Moore said that the new policy &quot; begs the question about whether it will avoid creating more Sardar Sarovar disasters &quot; in the future . &quot; The proof will be in the bank ' s lending pipeline , which still contains the large-scale-dam approach , &quot; she said . &quot; Will we see a dramatic decline in investments for such costly projects ? &quot; The bank said it supports fewer than 8 % of the dams under construction . Sardar Sarovar , on the Narmada River , is under review by the Indian government , said Lori Udall , an attorney in Washington for the EDF , which has worked with grass-roots environmental groups in India for seven years to stop construction . &quot; The dam wall ( now 230 feet high ) may be completed , but the project will never be finished without international financing , &quot; she predicted . Most of the 13 # 000 people who have been resettled so far are still living_in windowless tin sheds . Although the U.S._government is not involved in India ' s dam , it is modeled after those in the American West . One of the most enormous water_projects ever designed on the North_American continent , the James_River hydroelectric project in Canada ' s Quebec Province now attracts more international engineering attention than the pioneering U.S. dams . If completed , the Hydro-Quebec undertaking would include at least 30 major dams . &quot; Most of the real dam-building is going_on in countries like China . They have about 250 under construction , &quot; said Larry D . Stephens , executive_director of the Denver-based U.S. Committee on Large Dams , an association of engineers and scientists . When completed , China ' s Three Gorges will produce as much hydroelectric power as the world ' s two largest dams combined , the Guri ( Raul Leon ) in Venezuela and the Itaipu on the Brazil-Paraguay border .</TEXT>
