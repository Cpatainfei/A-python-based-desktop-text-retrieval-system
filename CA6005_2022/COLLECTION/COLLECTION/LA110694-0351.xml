   <HEADLINE> STATE HUMANE GROUP SEEKS TO TIGHTEN REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFICERS ; LEGISLATION : A NEW REGULATION THAT GOES INTO EFFECT JAN . 1 WILL REQUIRE MORE TRAINING , BUT SOME REMAIN CONCERNED THAT IT DOES NOT GO_FAR ENOUGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As crisply dressed officers bustle in and out of the sprawling Marin Humane Society headquarters , Rick Johnson makes his way through kennels filled with yapping dogs and into the main auditorium where the lectures are given . It is here , in this cavernous room , where California ' s humane officers can choose to go_for advanced training in such subjects as peace_officer ethics , evidence collection and preservation , crime scene photography and the preparation and execution of search_warrants . It is a place , in_effect , where humane officers charged with protecting animals from abuse and neglect learn how to be the sworn peace_officers they already are . There is a spacious library , exhibits depicting the history of humane officers and the animals they safeguard and a visitors center so the public can learn about these little-known agents of the law . &quot; We want people to know what we are out there doing : trying to make_it a better world for animals , &quot; said Johnson , who is president of the State Humane Assn . of California as well as a top official in the Marin Humane Society . &quot; That ethic underlies everything we do. &quot; Problem is , attendance at the modern center is not mandatory under the state laws that give humane officers their broad range of powers . Many officers , Johnson complained , never come here or to a similar site in San Diego . Although humane officers can conduct criminal investigations and make arrests where animals are concerned , many do not have the most rudimentary training in law and police procedures . To be a humane officer is a complicated task ; humane laws cross a huge spectrum of criminal and civil codes , and it takes a 343-page book to explain all_the applicable state statutes , not to mention all_the laws of each county . As of Jan . 1 , California ' s humane officers will be required to take 20 hours of training in animal care and at least 40 hours of training in state laws at accredited post-secondary institutions . But Johnson wishes more could be done to regulate humane officers . &quot; Training is imperative if you are to use weapons , &quot; he said . He said the state association , a private organization that led the effort last year to move the Legislature to strengthen the requirements , is considering proposing a measure to require monitoring boards in each county . Now , the presiding judge of the Superior_Court in each county is charged with reviewing all applicants for humane officers within their jurisdiction before approving them . That system is outdated , said Johnson , contending that the judges usually rubber-stamp the applications . Such is the case in Los Angeles County , where officials say they simply send the forms to the state_Department of Justice in Sacramento so fingerprints can be checked to see if the applicant has a criminal_record . There is no indication that judges conduct any investigation beyond the fingerprint check , nothing to equal the exhaustive background and psychological examinations to which applicants for most police and sheriff ' s departments are subjected . &quot; Their calendars are jampacked , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; Their priorities are elsewhere. &quot; Eric Sakach , a Sacramento-based investigator with the Humane Society of the United States , also said improvements are needed . But like Johnson , he said most humane officers are well-trained and well-behaved in upholding the laws , and that many other states are also upgrading their requirements . Although no one keeps statistics on the number of humane officers in the state , Sakach estimated that half of those in California carry firearms . A slender man with the calm demeanor of a country_doctor , Johnson , 46 , grimaces when he hears tales of wayward humane officers overstepping the bounds of their authority . Although his group has no control over the officers , it spends a good portion of its budget trying to provide better training . Most problems , Johnson said , occur in large urban_areas where police_departments are too_large to notice a_few renegade humane officers running_around in their uniforms . Most places , he said , &quot; really don ' t have a problem with these Scud missiles like L.A. does. &quot; And most humane officers , he said , not only do their job well and diligently , but serve an invaluable function at a time when their counterparts in state and local police_departments are too busy with murders and rapes to keep a watchful eye on animals . Most humane officers , according to Johnson and others , work closely with police rather than on_their_own , and present evidence of criminal conduct to local prosecutors . Marin Humane Society officers work for many small localities on a contract basis . They have a state-of-the-art darkroom to print the photographs they use as evidence , and they usually bring a video camera when on calls . Despite the fact that humane officers are not required to go there for training , the Marin County site bustles with activity . Humane officers from around the state come and go , and many return every few years to brush_up their skills , Johnson said .</TEXT>
