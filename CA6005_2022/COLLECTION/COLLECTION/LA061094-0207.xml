   <HEADLINE> SUPPORT SOUGHT FOR ' 3 STRIKES ' ALTERNATIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti and the father of murder victim Polly Klaas called_on Gov . Pete Wilson and the Legislature on Thursday to put an alternative &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; proposal on the Nov . 2 ballot . But Wilson , who in March signed legislation identical to the &quot; three strikes &quot; ballot initiative that has already qualified , promptly announced that he would veto any such bill . &quot; I think it is wrong to weaken the ' three strikes ' measure , &quot; Wilson told reporters at a Republican_Party gathering . &quot; that ' s exactly what those folks are aiming to do , that ' s the whole purpose of ( the second ballot measure ) effort . I will not participate in the weakening of the ' three strikes ' law. &quot; Wilson ' s warning of a veto dimmed hopes for what supporters contend would be a more effective but less costly alternative to the first &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative , sponsored by Fresno photographer Mike Reynolds , whose daughter was slain by a repeat felon . The chief element of the alternative , which has not been written into bill form , would send criminals to prison for 25 years to life if their third felony was a violent act . The &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative that already qualified for the ballot requires that the third offense be a serious felony but not necessarily a violent one . Under either measure , the first two strikes can be serious or violent . However , given the Legislature ' s tough-on-crime mood in this election year , it seems unlikely that an incumbent in a contested race would run the risk of being perceived as soft_on crime by supporting an option to the &quot; three strikes &quot; law and ballot initiative . In the Senate , President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) conceded that Senate Democrats were split over whether to try to draft a modification of the original law . GOP leader Ken Maddy of Fresno said most Republicans oppose putting a second &quot; three strikes &quot; plan on the ballot because it would confuse voters . Lockyer , who has been sampling opinion for the last two months on enacting some form of alternative and testing law_enforcement support , told reporters that no consensus had developed . Garcetti and Marc Klaas , the father of Polly , whose abduction from her home and slaying last year propelled the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative to qualify for the ballot , contended that the proposed option would be less costly and would target violent felons instead of bad_check writers , home burglars and other nonviolent criminals . At a news_conference called to muster support for an alternative , Klaas noted that he originally backed the &quot; three strikes &quot; ballot initiative . &quot; In the depth of despair which all Californians shared with my family immediately following Polly ' s murder , we blindly supported the . . . initiative in the mistaken belief that it dealt only with violent crimes , &quot; Klaas said . &quot; Instead , three out of the four crimes it addresses are not violent. &quot; Garcetti , who reported his office has filed more_than 400 &quot; three strikes &quot; cases since Wilson signed the bill that mirrors the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative , warned that there may_not be sufficient funds to bring all_of them to trial . &quot; Let the taxpayers of California decide how their tax dollars are spent in prosecuting violent criminals , &quot; Garcetti said . But Wilson said prosecutors are given discretion under the current &quot; three strikes &quot; law to waive a &quot; third strike &quot; felony when appropriate . The state_Department of Corrections estimates that the &quot; three strikes &quot; law signed by Wilson would lead to a boom in construction of 20 prisons in the next few years and add $ 2 billion annually in operating_costs . Garcetti and other supporters of the alternative asserted that restricting the third strike to violent felons by exempting burglars and other nonviolent offenders would dramatically reduce costs . To counter criticism that the alternative would weaken the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , sponsors wrote into it toughened provisions for dealing with sex crimes , including 15 years to life for a first conviction of forcible child molestation . Current law provides a term of three to eight years . Reynolds and legislative sponsors of the &quot; three strikes &quot; law that Wilson signed held a news_conference to denounce the alternative plan . &quot; Voters have a choice in November . They can vote for ( ' three strikes ' ) or they can vote against it , &quot; said Assemblyman Jim Costa ( D-Fresno ) .</TEXT>
