   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : COMPANY TOWN ; SINATRA DUETS : CAPITOL RECORDS ' LOVE OF THEM IS LOVELIER THE 2ND TIME AROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a year when Capitol Records scored with Blind Melon and the comeback album by Duran Duran , its biggest success still belonged_to a 78-year-old crooner . &quot; Frank Sinatra Duets , &quot; which had &quot; The Chairman &quot; trading lyrics with vocalists as far afield as Barbra Streisand and Bono , shipped 5 million copies worldwide and revived Sinatra ' s dormant recording career . It also helped launch the tribute genre as an industry unto itself . Now Capitol hopes to hit pay_dirt again with &quot; Frank Sinatra Duets II , &quot; which comes_out next week and pairs Sinatra with such diverse performers as Chrissie Hynde , Stevie Wonder , Gladys Knight , Jimmy Buffet , Neil Diamond and even Frank Sinatra Jr. , who joins his father on &quot; My Kind of Town. &quot; Charles Koppelman , chairman of EMI Records Group North_America , Capitol ' s parent , says the Sinatra duets have become a franchise . The original &quot; Duets &quot; sold heavily to people 25 and older , who are not usually big album buyers . The follow-up is being launched with a CBS Thanksgiving special featuring old and new footage of Sinatra singing with others . And Capitol has already recorded at least one song that could show_up on a &quot; Duets III. &quot; &quot; What ' s clear to us is that people in_general , meaning everyone that likes music , really enjoys hearing great singers sing with Frank Sinatra , who is certainly the best of the best , &quot; Koppelman said . &quot; Plus it clearly has a built-in audience. &quot; Sinatra ' s success aside , some industry executives still view tribute albums as novelties just one step removed from true oddities like the famous kazoo version of &quot; Louie , Louie. &quot; Overall , tribute releases have met with more failure than success . And some critics contend that Capitol over-shipped the first &quot; Frank Sinatra Duets &quot; to create the appearance of bigger sales . But many record companies remain enamored of the genre , in which major stars often salute their influences . The most successful recent compilation is Giant Records ' &quot; Common Thread : Songs of the Eagles , &quot; featuring country stars singing Eagles classics . The record sold more_than 2.4 million copies domestically and helped encourage the group ' s reunion . The outpouring also includes tributes to the Carpenters , Black Sabbath and Kiss , as well as &quot; Sweet Relief , &quot; a fund-raising album for singer Victoria Williams ; &quot; You Got Lucky , &quot; which salutes Tom Petty ; &quot; No Prima_Donna : The Songs of Van Morrison &quot; ; &quot; All Men Are Brothers -- A Tribute to Curtis Mayfield , &quot; and &quot; Beat the Retreat -- Songs by Richard Thompson. &quot; MCA may be the tribute champ when it comes_to volume . It released &quot; Elton John Duets &quot; and &quot; Rhythm Country &amp; Blues , &quot; which paired major country stars with their rhythm-and-blues counterparts . Its latest efforts are &quot; George Jones : The Bradley Barn Sessions &quot; and &quot; Skynyrd Frynds. &quot; MCA Music Entertainment Group Chairman Al Teller says tribute albums have always been around but have recently gotten a boost from CD technology , which has led record companies to repackage and salute the works of established performers . Teller calls the genre &quot; event records. &quot; He says they generally succeed if they ' re conceived and executed properly . &quot; Like anything in our business , you have to pick your spot very carefully , &quot; he said . &quot; The concept has to make_sense and the execution has to be of the top magnitude . You can ' t fake one of these . You also count_on a lot of good press and word of mouth. &quot; MCA is looking_at other possible salutes , but Teller says there are no firm plans as of now . Meanwhile , Capitol / EMI has high expectations for its Sinatra sequel . The singing legend recorded his vocals in one session at Capitol ' s Hollywood studio about nine months ago . Like the time before , his duet partners added their vocals to the existing tracks . Koppelman says &quot; Duets II &quot; could outperform the first , due_to the high recognition factor . The smorgasbord of singers joining him also includes Linda Ronstadt , Lena Horne , Patti LaBelle , Lorrie Morgan , Willie Nelson , John Secada and international stars Luis Miguel and Antonio Carlos Jobim . Koppelman says he got most of the people on his wish list . Two holdouts were Madonna , who was busy recording her own album , and Luciano Pavarotti , who recorded &quot; My Way &quot; too late to make the &quot; Duets II &quot; deadline . Koppelman says it will show_up on a later album . Like MCA , Capitol has no other major duet projects planned . But Koppelman says it ' s easy to explain their appeal . &quot; People love duets , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s easier for people to listen to two singers for 3 1 / 2 minutes than one. &quot; * Blues children : The House of Blues has made_good on its promise to educate school-age children on the history and evolution of American roots music . Its three-day-a-week program kicked_off last week at the West Hollywood club with a musical_performance by Black Coffee and Jam , an art tour and a history_lesson presented by actors for children from the Marvin Avenue School in Los Angeles . The series , sponsored by the International House of Blues Foundation Program , is designed to promote racial harmony and encourage more music appreciation programs in schools .
