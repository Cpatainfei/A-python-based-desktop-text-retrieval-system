   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; SUPERVISORS SAY IT ' S TIME FOR RAABE TO GO ; TREASURER : CREDIBILITY NEEDS TO BE RESTORED TO OFFICE , THEY SAY . CITRON ' S HEIR REPORTEDLY REASSURED GOVERNMENTAL INVESTORS IN OCTOBER THAT THE INVESTMENT POOL COULD COVER ANY POTENTIAL LOSSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than three weeks after he assumed control of the embattled treasurer ' s office , a majority of the Orange County Board of Supervisors -- which pressured Treasurer Robert L . Citron to resign -- said Wednesday that it is time for acting Treasurer Matthew Raabe to go too . Raabe , Citron ' s chosen heir_apparent , was initially hailed for alerting the county to problems with the fund in early November . But supervisors said Wednesday they could not ignore reports that Raabe continued to aggressively reassure other governmental investors -- as the fund lurched toward collapse in October -- of the investment pool ' s ability to cover any potential losses . &quot; We need to restore credibility to the office , &quot; said Supervisor Roger Stanton . Supervisors Stanton and William G . Steiner said they favor installing as interim treasurer Thomas E . Daxon , the former Oklahoma auditor who was brought_in Dec . 12 as a special consultant to the treasurer ' s office . &quot; There is such a cloud_over the treasurer ' s office , &quot; Steiner said . &quot; It ' s time to appoint Daxon. &quot; Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez , who becomes chairman_of_the_Board of Supervisors in January , said that although Raabe now serves as an important &quot; link &quot; in unraveling Citron ' s investments , he most likely will not be part of a post-bankruptcy treasurer ' s office . &quot; A change will occur , &quot; said Vasquez , who declined to elaborate . Depending_upon the outcome of investigations of Raabe and Citron by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Orange County district_attorney ' s office , supervisors are considering everything from Raabe ' s reassignment to complete removal . Vasquez said a decision about a leadership transition in the office will occur &quot; in a matter of days. &quot; Although it remains unclear whether Raabe had a hand in devising the risky investment strategies that torpedoed the multibillion-dollar fund , interviews and documents indicate that Raabe was a devoted disciple of Citron , fervently preaching the reclusive treasurer ' s investment gospel to the fund ' s inglorious end . For 10 months this year , while interest_rates rose five times and the treasurer ' s office relied_on a stepped-up series of borrowings for cash , Raabe , 38 , crisscrossed the state , reassuring gatherings of city treasurers and other participants in the investment pool that the fund was sound . In April , after the Federal_Reserve_Board had increased interest_rates three times for a total of three-quarters of a percent , Raabe sold skittish Newport-Mesa School District officials on the idea of rolling_over a $ 47-million loan they had taken_out to invest more heavily in the fund . And at several meetings of public finance officers and treasurers -- including one in mid-October -- Raabe dismissed questions about the fund ' s risks , saying the county had $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion in &quot; overnight money &quot; to be used in case an interest-sensitive investment went awry , or investors in short-term county bonds or notes demanded their money back . &quot; You never , ever got a sense that they weren ' t confident , &quot; said Howard Longballa , Placentia finance director . &quot; ( Raabe ) said , ' Yes , the pool has exposure if interest_rates rise , ' but that ( the county ) always kept liquid just for that reason . He said they had a_billion set aside. &quot; Raabe , under scrutiny for possibly misrepresenting the fund ' s solvency to investors , would not comment Wednesday on a possible shake-up in his office . But in his first public comments about his involvement in formulating and carrying_out the county ' s failed investment strategy , he said Citron made all such decisions alone , and that he had virtually no input into the process . &quot; It would be fair to say that anywhere I went I was explaining what Mr. Citron ' s investment strategy was , &quot; Raabe said . &quot; I never had anything to do with devising investment strategy. &quot; But investors say that if Raabe was not designing the car , he was selling it -- and neglecting to tell them that this year ' s version could turn_out to be a lemon . &quot; I do not believe he was just a lieutenant responding on the directions of the captain , &quot; said Edward Decker , a Newport-Mesa school_board member who met with Raabe in April . &quot; I came_away with the feeling that he was as much a part of the scheme or proposal as his boss was. &quot; Raabe was certainly Citron ' s chosen successor in the eyes of many county officials . He first joined the auditor-controller ' s office 10 years ago , but switched to the treasurer ' s office in 1987 because there was a greater opportunity for advancement , his friends said . When Citron ' s longtime deputy Ray Wells retired , Raabe , who had earned his certified_public_accountant certificate , became the assistant treasurer in 1993 . Steiner said he remembered asking county administrative officer Ernie Schneider in spring if there were plans for succession in Citron ' s office , which he considered &quot; a one-man show. &quot; Steiner said he was led to believe Raabe was being groomed for the job . &quot; He was the heir apparent. &quot; In a Sept . 14 , 1993 , memo to the supervisors accompanying his financial report , Citron devoted half a page to praise of Raabe , who he said was &quot; directly involved in the day-to-day operation of the treasury. &quot; Citron wrote that Raabe &quot; is involved or aware of the daily decisions being made . He is responsible_for implementing investment decisions . . . . I thought you would be interested in knowing that there is in the county treasury a person such_as Mr. Raabe who can actively manage and operate the county treasury. &quot; Raabe also served as Citron ' s front_man . Calls to Citron were invariably answered by Raabe . Citron signed most requests to county supervisors to issue notes , but Raabe was the person the supervisors were asked to contact if they had any questions . &quot; You didn ' t get_to talk to Citron . Citron is the mountain , &quot; said one investment_banker , who asked that his name not be used . &quot; The oracle is Matt Raabe. &quot; City and county treasurers and finance directors say Raabe ' s attitude about the fund strategies was : &quot; Don ' t try this at_home , kids . Leave it to the professionals. &quot;</TEXT>
