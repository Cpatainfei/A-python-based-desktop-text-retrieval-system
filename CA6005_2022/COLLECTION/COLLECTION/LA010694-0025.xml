   <HEADLINE> OLIVE : THE DUKE OF OILS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In June of 1993 , representatives of the major oil-producing nations convened at the Grand Hotel Quisiano on the island of Capri for a summit of industry titans . But their talk focused not on barrels and crude , but on HDLs and cold-pressing . These particular oil producers belonged not to OPEC , but to IOOC -- the International Olive_Oil Council . The product that brought them here has become a primary fuel of the nutritional and culinary revolution of the 1990s : &quot; green_gold , &quot; better known as olive_oil . When I was growing_up , olive_oil was difficult to come_by , and the choice was limited to one or two producers . Today ' s consumer is confronted with a staggering selection of olive_oils : extra-virgin or virgin , Italian or Greek , cold-pressed or stone-ground , even oils with vintages , like wines . According to industry consultant Hank Orsi , olive_oil imports have soared 3 # 000 % in the last 10 years to their current annual level of 100 # 000 tons . In an age of general lackluster economic performance , olive_oil sales were up a hefty 11.5 % in the last 12 months . So what accounts_for olive_oil ' s astonishing success today ? Three factors have conspired to turn olive_oil into a cook ' s indispensable companion : lifestyle , health and taste . * First , lifestyle . In the 1980s , American food-lovers began turning from the elaborate sauces and cooking methods of French cuisine to a simpler style based on grilling . Olive_oil , with its rich fruity flavor , proved to be perfect for marinating and basting . It required little more_than opening a bottle and pouring . At the same time , medical researchers turned their attention to the diet of the Mediterranean , a region with a surprisingly low rate of heart_disease and a high consumption of olive_oil . Not as rich_in monounsaturated fats as canola oil , but very rich nonetheless , olive_oil contains little saturated fat , an item that health_professionals tell us to eat less of . Because it is a useful source of Vitamin_E , researchers have studied olive_oil for a host of health benefits -- from lowering blood_pressure to reducing the risk of arterial thrombosis . But equally important is olive_oil ' s pungent and distinctive flavor . Only a_few food oils are used as a flavoring , among them olive_oil , nut oils and sesame_oil . Olive_oil possesses an almost limitless range of flavors : It can be fruity or earthy ; intense or mild ; grassy , herbaceous , or even peppery . Many factors determine the taste of a particular oil : the type of olive ( more_than 60 varieties are used for oil making ) , the ripeness of the fruit at harvest_time , the harvesting method ( the best oils are made with hand-picked olives ) , and the methods of pressing , blending , aging and bottling . Like wine , olive_oil reflects the soil , slope and microclimate where the trees are grown . There ' s no such thing as a &quot; best &quot; oil -- no more so than there ' s a &quot; best &quot; wine . Nonetheless , there are some technical details you should know before plunking_down as much as $ 30 for a quart of olive_oil . First are the three basic grades of olive_oil : &quot; Extra-Virgin , &quot; &quot; Virgin &quot; and &quot; Olive Oil. &quot; * Extra-Virgin , the highest grade , contains 1 % or less acidity . Virgin oil ( seldom seen in this country ) contains between 1 % and 3 % acidity and is chiefly used for blending . Plain &quot; olive_oil &quot; ( once called &quot; pure &quot; oil ) starts as inferior oil that , because it ' s too acidic or poorly flavored , can ' t be sold in its natural_state . The oil is industrially refined to reduce its acidity to 1.5 % or less , then flavored with a little extra-virgin or virgin oil . Other terms to consider when buying olive_oil include &quot; stone-ground &quot; or &quot; cold-pressed &quot; -- an indication that the olives have been crushed with a traditional millstone , not in a machine . ( Mechanical presses heat the oil , which alters the flavor. ) &quot; First press &quot; refers to oil from the first oil extraction . ( The crushed pulp can be pressed a second time to make an inferior grade of oil. ) &quot; Unfiltered &quot; oil contains fine particles of olive solids , which gather at the bottom of the bottle , like sediment in fine old wine . To enjoy olive_oil at its best , you should buy extra-virgin . It won ' t be cheap ( plan on spending at least $ 8 to $ 15 a quart ) , but thanks to its intense flavor , a little goes_a_long_way . What you ' ll get is a quality oil made from first-choice olives , pressed immediately after harvest in a press that keeps heat to a minimum . Extra-virgin olive_oil is distinguished by a bright ( often greenish ) color , fragrant aroma and deep , rich , fruity flavor . The flavor varies dramatically from oil to oil , from producer to producer and from country to country , but it will always be intense . Some of my favorites include Frescobaldi &quot; Laudemio &quot; and Badia a Coltibuono from Italy , James Plagniol and Old Monk from France , L ' Estornell Certified Organic from Spain , and Olio Santo from the Napa Valley . Colavita makes a good , affordable , all-purpose extra-virgin oil for everyday use . Some of the best values are the strong , fragrant oils from Portugal and Greece . Available at ethnic markets , they cost a fraction of what Italian oils do and often have more flavor . * One final note : Unlike wine , olive_oil does not improve with age . Store it away from heat and light in an airtight container and use it as soon as you can . * Bagna cauda , literally &quot; hot bath , &quot; is an ancient , olive - oil-based dip from northern Italy . The following recipe has been adapted from Lotte Mendelsohn ' s book , &quot; Italian Regional Cookery &quot; ( Font &amp; Center ) . BAGNA CAUDA 1 cup extra-virgin olive_oil 6 to 8 cloves garlic , thinly sliced 1 ounce flat anchovies , drained , rinsed and chopped Freshly ground pepper Dash red_pepper flakes 2 carrots 2 zucchini 2 stalks celery 1 sweet red_pepper 4 green_onions 8 grissini ( slender Italian_bread sticks ) Gently heat olive_oil in heavy saucepan . Add garlic and cook over medium-low heat until garlic is light-golden brown , about 5 minutes . Stir in anchovies and cook 1 minute . Let mixture cool slightly , then puree in blender . Season to taste with black_pepper and red_pepper flakes . Place oil mixture in small chafing_dish or fondue pot and keep warm over low heat . Or mixture can be reheated and placed in 4 individual ramekins . Cut carrots , zucchini , celery and sweet red_pepper into strips 1 / 2x3 inches . Cut green_onions into 3-inch lengths . Arrange vegetables and grissini on platter or stand upright in glasses or cups . Let each diner dip vegetable strips and bread sticks_in oil mixture . Makes 4 servings .</TEXT>
