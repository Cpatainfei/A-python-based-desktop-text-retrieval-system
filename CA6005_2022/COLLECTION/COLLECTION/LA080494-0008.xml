   <HEADLINE> COOKBOOK TROUBLE ; A SOUP IS BORN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How do you create a recipe from the first spark of an idea ? It ' s a combination of the mystical and the downright practical . Recipes should not exist in a vacuum . Yes , it ' s exciting to taste new combinations of flavors and master techniques . But for me , the deeper goal is in making some kind of contribution beyond these momentary sensations . Though flavor brings joy to eating , there must be meaning beyond that . Does the recipe just involve measurements and flavors or does_it speak_to larger issues ? To begin writing , you must understand the mechanics of a recipe . When I was about to start work_on my first book , I met with a cookbook editor . During my college years , I had cooked my way through all_the cookbooks in the Berkeley Public_Library and had a budding cookbook collection of my own , but I didn ' t know some of the most obvious things about how to write a recipe . She explained , for example , that you must list the ingredients in the order in which they appear in the method , the step-by-step part of the recipe . I remember thinking that couldn ' t possibly be the way they ' re listed . It must be in_order of importance or quantity . At home , I looked in a cookbook and sure enough , she was right . The writing that appears before the list of ingredients and method is called a headnote . But what goes_into a headnote ? Should it simply describe the dish ? The headnote is a very important part of the whole . It lures you into the recipe . You can explain why you find the idea so intriguing , point_out an unusual technique , point_out a slightly tricky part , make menu suggestions , or write_about a specific ingredient , such_as what to look_for when buying Swiss_chard , or the importance of buying organic lemons when using the rind . A headnote can also evoke a time and place or a mood . To illustrate what goes_into selecting an idea and writing a recipe , here is a look_at the steps I took_in writing a recipe for my upcoming book . Because my family is from Sicily , where wild fennel grows abundantly , fennel holds a special place in my heart . When I was growing_up in a Southern California suburb , my grandmother grew wild fennel in the back yard , probably purely for sentimental and ornamental reasons , since I can ' t remember tasting it as a child . Now , Florentine fennel , the fresh fennel variety sold in markets , has a tasty bulb , but its feathery tops do not possess much flavor . Wild fennel does grow along the California coast , but its availability is pretty restricted , meaning it would be unrealistic to call_for it in a recipe . I ' d been intrigued for some time by a rustic bread soup from the Italian island of Sardinia that features wild fennel and sun-dried tomato . I thought that using the bulb of Florentine fennel and a sprinkling of fennel_seeds might impart a flavor similar to the taste of wild fennel . Further , I thought I would finely chop the fennel tops of the Florentine fennel and add them to the soup for color . I would add the fibrous stalks to the broth for flavor , but remove them after the initial cooking of the soup . The use of sun-dried tomatoes in this dish could be instructive , illustrating their traditional use as a cold-weather substitute for fresh tomatoes , as opposed to their more arbitrary -- and often inappropriate -- use as just another trendy ingredient . I ' m interested in simple vegetable broths , and I thought the combination of fennel and sun-dried tomato would create a wonderfully full-flavored and richly colored broth . Also interesting is the second cooking of the soup , where it is layered with country bread and fresh cheeses and baked in the oven , creating a satisfying one-dish meal . The recipe also illustrates the importance of the quality of bread needed for a soup such_as this one . And I could point_out how this sort of soup was a way of extending the life of stale bread and increasing the nutritional value of a dish . Dried bread could be used , since the broth would soften its texture . I began testing the recipe by gathering the ingredients . I first checked to make_sure the fennel_seeds I had were fresh and strongly perfumed . I bought two fragrant , pearly white fennel bulbs with fresh feathery tops . I bought a high-quality brand of sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive_oil ( any other oil would spoil the taste of the soup ) . I bought a crusty loaf_of_bread from one of the many bread bakeries in my area . I wanted the soup to have some of its original green color , so I bought bunches of Italian_parsley and basil . Since the original dish has parsley and basil as part of the aromi -- or background flavors -- increasing their amounts keeps the spirit of the dish still intact , as long as the fennel flavor dominates . I purchased a dripping fresh mozzarella cheese . The original zuppa uses a combination of cheeses , some mild , some strong . I decided to start with a mild cheese so the flavor would not compete with the fennel . I was pleased with the ingredients ; they formed a beautiful still_life . As I began the cooking process I had to make a_hundred little decisions and faithfully record every measurement and every step . When I removed the steaming , aromatic soup from the oven and saw the beautiful broth , deeply colored and flavored , I was pleased , but not entirely satisfied with the results . A zuppa traditionally is a soup that features bread ; it is thick , and not too brothy . The soup fit the description -- the bread had absorbed the juices and softened , but enough broth remained to keep the soup moist . There was a nice , light licorice flavor . The cheese was melted and , although the mozzarella clumped up a little , it enriched the soup . Still , I ' m not sure this is the finished version . The next time I make this soup I ' ll drive along the coast to collect wild fennel . I will experiment with different cheeses that might provide more flavor and melt more effectively . Pecorino Sardo , a grating cheese , is becoming more available here and would provide more of the tangy flavor of the original cheeses . Also , I might shred the mozzarella instead of slicing it thinly to make_it melt better . Another time I might try slicing rather than dicing the Florentine fennel for a different texture and to see if it brings_out more fennel flavor . I might soak the bread in a little milk to moisten it and to enrich the soup . Next time I ' ll let the bread dry naturally , instead of toasting it , and use it in its more authentic form . As you can see , all kinds of subtle changes can make a difference . The final step is to write it all down . At my word_processor , as soon as possible after actually testing the recipe , I write , revise and refine the recipe . How will I describe the size of the chopped fennel pieces -- small chunks or medium dice ? How much sun-dried tomatoes ? Are they best measured by the piece or by the cup ? Should I give the exact size of the cooking vessel or just an approximation ? For certain recipes , most notably in baking , exactitude is everything and no leaps of faith are admissible . But I know that with my style of cooking , a little leeway is desirable . I try to give as much information as needed while allowing the reader to make some personal choices . I think this helps promote real learning , since my goal is to teach someone how to cook , not just how to follow recipes . Some cookbook authors follow a paint-by-numbers method , detailing everything . I prefer a connect-the-dots approach where a_few little leaps are allowed , and there is some room to breath . The balancing act is to supply all_the crucial information and measurements necessary , yet give the recipe a living , breathing quality . As the project takes_shape , I might decide this recipe doesn ' t fit , or that it conflicts with the overall feeling . But the process of experimenting with this idea was a learning experience and the finished book will be better for it , whether the recipe is actually included or not . * The size of the baking dish is important , since it controls the degree of evaporation of the stock . In the method I also wanted to make_sure the steps were efficient . For example , while the onion sautes , the fennel is trimmed , and while the soup simmers , the cheese is sliced and the bread toasted . FENNEL AND SUN-DRIED TOMATO SOUP 1 onion , cut_into small dice 1 / 4 cup chopped Italian_parsley 8 basil leaves , chopped 1 / 2 teaspoon fennel_seeds 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive_oil , plus extra for garnish 1 1 / 2 pounds fennel , about 2 medium bulbs 1 / 4 cup drained chopped sun-dried tomatoes in olive_oil Finely ground sea salt and coarsely ground black_pepper 5 cups water 1 / 2 pound drained mozzarella in water 15 ( 1 / 2-inch thick ) slices sturdy Italian_bread , or enough bread to make ( 3 1 / 2-inch thick ) layers that fit baking dish In medium soup pot , saute onion , parsley , basil and fennel_seeds in olive_oil over low heat for about 12 minutes , or until onion is tender and lightly golden . Meanwhile , trim fennel , reserving feathery tops and stalks . Remove tough strings and bruised areas on surface of fennel bulbs . Chop fennel bulbs into small chunks . Finely chop feathery tops . Add chopped fennel bulb and tops , and sun-dried tomatoes to pot . Saute over medium heat for 5 minutes , adding salt and pepper to taste . Add 5 cups water and fennel stalks and bring_to boil . Simmer for 20 minutes . Thinly slice mozzarella . Arrange bread slices on cookie sheet and toast at 400 degrees until bread is crisp and light gold . about 5 minutes on each side . Remove fennel stalks from soup . Ladle 1 / 4 of soup into oven-proof pot or baking dish about 8 inches in diameter and 5 1 / 2 inches deep . Arrange 5 slices of bread in 1 layer over top , and 1 / 3 of cheese slices . Season with salt and pepper . Continue layering , ending with soup . Bake soup uncovered for 20 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees . Only small amount of broth will remain since bread will absorb most of it . Ladle soup into individual soup_bowls , distributing broth evenly . Pour thin thread of olive_oil over each . Makes 4 servings .
