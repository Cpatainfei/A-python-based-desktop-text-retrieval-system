   <HEADLINE> BRITAIN DENIES ASSURING LEADER ABOUT IRISH UNITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Irish nationalist leader Martin McGuinness claimed here Sunday that he had received private assurances from the_British government last year that it was working toward a united Ireland . McGuinness ' explosive statement came_in a BBC television interview during his first visit to Britain since Prime_Minister John Major lifted an exclusion order on him Friday . The vice_president of Sinn Fein , the political arm of the_Irish Republican Army , declared Sunday that early last year he had met with a government official who spoke with &quot; the full authority of the_British prime_minister and the secretary_of_state for Northern_Ireland , Patrick Mayhew . There is no doubt about that. &quot; McGuinness refused to identify the official or indicate whether he was a politician or civil_servant , but he added , &quot; I think the_British government is slowly disengaging from Ireland. &quot; Mayhew immediately denied McGuinness ' claims , declaring , &quot; This is patent nonsense . &quot; No British government representative , &quot; he said , &quot; has ever been or will ever be authorized to say that we support a united Ireland unless it is by the consent of the people of Northern_Ireland . &quot; We believe it is for the people of Northern_Ireland to decide the future of Northern_Ireland . So_long as it is their wish to remain in the United Kingdom , the_British government will uphold that wish . This has always been our position , and it will never change. &quot; Ever since December ' s Downing Street Declaration by Major and Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds , Northern_Ireland unionists have worried that some secret deal may have been made to encourage the current IRA cease-fire . Major has repeatedly insisted that no secret agreements have been reached . The British view Sunday night appeared to be that McGuinness was engaged in &quot; mischief-making , &quot; as one official put it , aimed at reassuring IRA hard-liners who are still not convinced that they should participate in the peace process . Major and Reynolds will meet in Britain today to discuss the next step_in the complex process of setting_up all-party talks and an agenda on the future of Northern_Ireland .</TEXT>
