   <HEADLINE> EXPATRIATE GAMES ; FED UP WITH HOLLYWOOD , OSCAR-WINNING SCREENWRITER STIRLING SILLIPHANT MOVED TO THAILAND TO ESCAPE THE POSTURING AND POWER_PLAYS . BUT THE VERY THINGS HE FLED FOLLOWED HIM THERE WHEN HE WROTE A MOVIE FOR TV</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stirling Silliphant , a fixture in the entertainment_industry for three decades , disappeared from Hollywood six years ago . He was one of the industry ' s most prolific screenwriters , winning an Academy Award for 1967 ' s &quot; In the Heat of the Night , &quot; the racial thriller starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger . But in the service of profit-hungry studio executives , he also churned_out lots of commercial action films -- from the so-called blaxploitation movie &quot; Shaft in Africa &quot; to director Sam Peckinpah ' s violent &quot; The Killer Elite &quot; -- and campy Irwin Allen disaster epics such_as &quot; The Poseidon Adventure &quot; and &quot; The Towering Inferno. &quot; Through it all , Silliphant grew tired_of the power_plays , the egos , the hypocrisy and the dictum that homage must be paid to the box_office . In 1987 , a dispute with Sylvester Stallone over screen credit for the championship arm-wrestling saga &quot; Over the Top &quot; finally pushed Silliphant himself over the top . He sold two houses , six cars and a yacht and moved to his favorite vacation_spot , Thailand , where the culture and Buddhism held a fascination for him . &quot; I didn ' t come here on a fling but to change my whole existence , my personality , my understanding of life , and to leave what I call the eel pit of Hollywood behind , &quot; the graying expatriate said last spring , sitting in a Trader Vic ' s here on the bank of the massive Chao Phraya River and gazing outward at the low-slung boats and barges passing_by . &quot; And it feels so good to be part of the human stream , and not some Hollywood big_shot who worries about what table he gets_at Jimmy ' s and won ' t let the parking attendant touch his $ 80 # 000 Mercedes . That seems so far away now . that ' s not the way we ' re supposed to live. &quot; In Thailand , where the American dollar is strong , the people are gracious and the land is largely unspoiled , Silliphant had a vision . Using local crew and talent , he wanted to turn Bangkok , along with the rest of Southeast_Asia , into a burgeoning production center for English-language TV projects and feature_films that would be distributed internationally . Little did he suspect that with his first effort , the problems he associated with working in Hollywood would track him down , 8 # 271 miles away : A star , Fred Dryer , got involved , rewrote the script and , in Silliphant ' s view , ruined his vision . The resulting TV movie , &quot; Day_of_Reckoning , &quot; airs Monday at 9 p.m. on NBC . * &quot; I have seen a video of the final version , &quot; Silliphant , 76 , said in another interview last week . &quot; I do not like it . My distaste stems not from whether the work is good , bad or indifferent . The critics and viewers will soon enough make their own decisions . &quot; It is simply that it is not the film I envisioned , the film about which I felt a driving passion and a long-held visionary hope -- finally to capture something , even a hint , of what it is like to be an American expatriate living_in Thailand . The final result , to me , is a film assembled by committee , a script hammered flat by executive fiat. &quot; Dryer disagrees . The action-filled NBC series &quot; Hunter &quot; turned the onetime Los Angeles Ram into a star with worldwide clout after it was syndicated in 90 or so countries , becoming the most-watched TV_program in China at one point . The changes Dryer made in &quot; Day_of_Reckoning &quot; were to give his fans what he believes they expect in his first acting assignment since &quot; Hunter &quot; ended production three years ago . &quot; The project couldn ' t have turned_out better , &quot; he said of &quot; Day_of_Reckoning , &quot; in a recent telephone_interview from Colorado while on vacation with his daughter . &quot; We think we have a real good piece. &quot; &quot; Day_of_Reckoning , &quot; produced as a potential TV-movie franchise for NBC , tells the tale of an American Special Forces captain who moves to Bangkok after the Vietnam_War . He becomes a Buddhist and a rogue travel guide , specializing in expeditions to remote and dangerous locations in Southeast_Asia . Silliphant and his Los Angeles partner , actor Robert Ginty , spent a year trying to raise $ 1.5 million to produce &quot; Day_of_Reckoning &quot; themselves . But the two farongs , or foreigners , couldn ' t entice Thai investors . Ginty was going_to star as Jack O ' Brien , the lead character , but wasn ' t a big enough name . Perhaps more significant , the once-buzzing film_industry has grown anemic in Thailand , where a big-budget movie might cost $ 400 # 000 , compared to $ 25 million or more for an American film . Flashy products from Hollywood and nearby Hong Kong have almost killed the industry , keeping smaller , local Thai productions out of the few theater chains . &quot; Most Thai investors would still rather fill a swamp and put_up buildings than back a film , &quot; said Silliphant , who began writing in the late 1950s on such acclaimed TV series as the police drama &quot; Naked City &quot; and the road_show &quot; Route 66. &quot; So Ginty took the project to Paramount in Hollywood . As Silliphant tells it , Ginty signed the rights away before Silliphant could object . * &quot; The next thing I knew , it had gone from Paramount to Fred Dryer to NBC , and suddenly we had a deal , &quot; Silliphant said last spring when &quot; Day_of_Reckoning &quot; was still in production . As Silliphant sat sipping his tropical drink_in Trader Vic ' s , filming was taking_place several hundred yards away in the luxurious lobby of the Royal Garden Riverside hotel . He was available for consultation , but he was so disheartened that he would n ' t appear on the set . &quot; When I heard this , I was not only unhappy , I was very upset , &quot; Silliphant continued . &quot; And what I knew would happen has happened . Number_one , the budget went from $ 1.5 to $ 4 million . And number two , we totally lost_control of the project . We sold the house . And then it went_into the Hollywood system . What is the Hollywood system ? The Hollywood system is to come_to a place like this and just use it as a background. &quot; He gestured out the hotel window to the Chao Phraya -- a busy waterway of commerce and trade_in Bangkok and the best way to avoid the snarling traffic_jams that transform stifling city streets into a virtual parking_lot during the day . Along the exotic green shores , beautiful resort_hotels stand between rotting , wooden dwellings where naked children play in dirty water . &quot; And that ' s not what I intended , &quot; Silliphant said . &quot; What we ' re getting is money . Period . We ' re not getting what we set_out to do -- which is to control the film , to invest it with the culture and the attitudes of Thailand , to make an essentially Thai-produced film . I felt a sense of great personal failure , having said ' Screw off ' five years ago , ' I don ' t need you bastards. ' Here I was back selling them something , and it was a total denial of everything I wanted to do. &quot; Silliphant said he bears no resentment toward Ginty , who ended_up with a supporting role in &quot; Day_of_Reckoning &quot; as Dryer ' s partner in his travel business , Eco Tours . Ginty said he was simply fed up with shopping the movie around when he made the deal with Paramount . &quot; I ' ve seen this development process go_on for years , having worked in independent films , &quot; Ginty said . &quot; But you ' ve got_to get_it made . You can talk_about it forever . There are guys out there in Morton ' s who are constantly talking_about it , and guys in Spago constantly talking_about it . I got impatient . I wasn ' t going_to wait any longer , because I knew it would sell . Between Stirling ' s name and this location , I knew the story would sell. &quot; * Early last year , the plans Dryer carefully devised for his career were collapsing like a house of cards . When &quot; Hunter &quot; was nearing the end of its seven-year run_on NBC , Dryer signed a three-year contract at Paramount with Brandon Tartikoff , who had recently resigned as chairman of NBC Entertainment to run the studio . One brainchild of Tartikoff ' s was to put popular TV_stars , who are seen in living rooms across America in tens of millions of households , into moderately budgeted movies and watch the cash roll in . Dryer was poised to launch his feature-film career in a movie called &quot; And Justice for One. &quot; But before the cameras were ready to roll , Tartikoff abruptly left Paramount , Sherry Lansing replaced him , and she put Dryer ' s film into turnaround . &quot; Brandon loved the movie , and he wanted to do_it , &quot; said Dryer , 48 . &quot; We had it all ready to go and then he left . When he did , the impending storm hit us : the new regime . And they said , ' We ' re not interested . We ' re not interested in you , and we ' re not interested in the project. ' I was pretty much dead in the water theatrically. &quot; Paramount ' s television division tried desperately to get Dryer to do a TV series , either a half-hour comedy or an hour drama . But he refused , choosing instead to focus his energy on developing his own production company . If he was going_to star in television , he wanted to produce and own the programming , making_sure it could play in foreign markets to address his huge overseas following . &quot; I do know that television drives the world , &quot; Dryer said . &quot; It ' s a software business , and those who have a library to supply that need in the coming years will be the ones in good_shape . I want to be a part of that future. &quot; that ' s when &quot; Day_of_Reckoning &quot; was presented to him . Although Paramount would own &quot; Day_of_Reckoning , &quot; the internationally flavored production offered Dryer a solid first project for his new company to produce and supply to NBC , where he has a three-movie deal . Dryer became executive producer , along with his partner , Victor Schiro . The pairing of Silliphant and Dryer seemed a natural . In &quot; Hunter , &quot; Dryer played a maverick cop with a female partner , incompetent superiors and a massive Magnum revolver . &quot; Hunter &quot; was crafted after Clint Eastwood ' s successful &quot; Dirty Harry &quot; movies , specifically &quot; The Enforcer , &quot; the only one to pair Eastwood with a female partner . Silliphant wrote &quot; The Enforcer. &quot; But Dryer didn ' t share Silliphant ' s vision of &quot; Day of Reckoning. &quot; Dryer changed much of Silliphant ' s script before he arrived in Asia , collaborating uneasily with Silliphant by fax to avoid costly phone_bills . * &quot; There really was no story there before , &quot; Dryer said . &quot; It was about a guy who lived_out on a rice barge_in front of the hotel . He had a travel_agency , with these slow-turning fans , and a lot of women taking_care of him . He was a typical American expatriate who lives_in Asia for specific womanizing reasons , and he was very sexist . It was very deprecating to the Thais . I brought_in a guy who ' s there because he has found a place in the world that fits him. &quot; Silliphant denies there were any sexist aspects to his original story . From his viewpoint , Dryer &quot; slashed and burned &quot; all_of the subtleties in his script , all_of the dialogue that wasn ' t of the &quot; let ' s go &quot; variety . &quot; I saw all_the grace_notes and textures of the writing and characterizations vanish one by one -- the dialogue reduced to easy banality or to strong , silent looks ; the story line pounded into an A-B-C linear form , &quot; Silliphant said . &quot; There may still be two scenes left in the entire two-hour movie in which some hint , some faint luster of the original writing , may be sensed. &quot; Dryer explained his approach : &quot; I have a pretty good_sense of who I am and what I want to do . I know my limitations . I know what I ' m capable of doing . And I know what people want to see . So I took the germ of the idea and just started restructuring it . It ' s no longer a closed mystery ; it was before . Everything was very veiled . It was tough to follow . Now it ' s just straight on . Everything is out_in the open . You get_to see the bad_guys and you can follow it easily. &quot; Nor did Dryer feel comfortable relying heavily on the Thai film_industry ' s infrastructure for technical support , as Silliphant had_in_mind . A multinational crew came_in from London , Hong Kong and the United States for filming last spring in Bangkok and the jungle mountains of Krabi to the south . The entire project was overseen by a contingent of Hollywood &quot; suits &quot; -- studio executives at Paramount and network executives at NBC . &quot; In my opinion , this oil-and-water mix cost us at least $ 1 million more_than it should have had we been able to shoot with a 95 % Thai crew and not whip into the mix Brits , Yanks and Hong Kong Chinese , &quot; Silliphant said . Filming wrapped in June . After an inordinately long post-production period , NBC announced an air date last month . Even the title of the movie was changed at the last minute because the original title , &quot; The Wisdom Keeper , &quot; tested poorly with audiences and didn ' t have &quot; enough punch , &quot; as Dryer put it . Dryer blamed part of the post-production delays on a Thai script supervisor who did not properly catalogue the thousands of feet of film that were shot . Silliphant blamed it on the continuing divisiveness of the separate cliques pulling_at the final production like taffy : Paramount , NBC , Dryer ' s production company and British director Brian Grant . Neither NBC nor Paramount would make anyone available to comment on the final version that airs Monday . In the end , Silliphant found the entire experience to be &quot; depressing , dispiriting , debilitating , &quot; calling &quot; Day_of_Reckoning &quot; the &quot; most degrading period of my career. &quot; The expatriate character of Jack O ' Brien still holds untapped potential for Silliphant . He would consider getting involved if NBC wants to turn the movie into a regular franchise , but he doesn ' t believe that ' s likely to happen after all_the hassles . Silliphant still maintains his dream of establishing a production mecca in Southeast_Asia . He ' s currently networking wealthy Thais for investors , and he ' s writing a screenplay called &quot; Forever , &quot; to be directed in Thailand by one of the country ' s leading directors , Prince Chatrichalerm Yugala . This time Silliphant will work without help from Hollywood . &quot; The thing that bothers me about America is the American insular point_of_view , &quot; he said . &quot; Our refusal to learn languages . Our refusal to really look_around and see this is one big world . . . . We are so absolutely insulated -- and Hollywood , in particular . We ' re like in a shell . We ' re like the crab . We scuttle around on the rocks but we can ' t break_out of the shell to realize this is a huge world . And there are wonderful films to be made. &quot; * Despite their differences , Dryer sounds like Silliphant in some ways : &quot; I left the studio system , and I ' m on my own . I have autonomy now , and I have an opportunity to enter into television and all_the projects I do as a free agent. &quot; Dryer won ' t rule_out working as an actor for hire -- apparently plans are under way with NBC and producer Stephen J . Cannell to do a &quot; Hunter &quot; TV movie . And Dryer would play O ' Brien again , if called_upon . But Dryer said he will make his priority Fred Dryer Productions , where he has a motion_picture and several TV projects in development . &quot; I ' m trying to address a world market , &quot; he said . &quot; People here know who I am because of television , and people around the world in 94 countries know who I am because of it . I want to attack the world theatrical market with smaller-budget features , and then come_back in a television project on a world level that is right for me . When I do , I will own that . I ' m looking_for ownership , not fees . I want to establish a company that ' s in it for the long haul. &quot;</TEXT>
