   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FINALS ; WHITHER A CUP FOR WOMEN ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Where are the women ? This is what I wonder most . As I watch ( and watch and watch ) these patriot games , these World Cup shoot- ' em-ups , I am aware of their many similarities to the Olympics , the same rich pageantry , the same painted faces , the same love for fatherland or motherland . There is only one thing missing . Well , a whole_lot of one thing , actually . The women . Next summer in Sweden , the second world championships of women ' s soccer will be contested . Quick quiz : Anybody know who won the first ? Hurry , now . Clock ' s ticking . Brazil ? Bzzzzz . Wrong . &quot; Brazil was weak , &quot; remembers Karen Stanley , women ' s soccer coach for USC who was there . &quot; A good college team could have beaten Brazil. &quot; The United States ? Uh , as a matter_of_fact , yes . &quot; I remember Alan Rothenberg ( U.S. soccer federation president ) standing_up before some big World Cup thing and addressing the issue : ' When are we ever going_to win a world championship ? ' &quot; Stanley was saying Thursday , after attending the previous day ' s game between Brazil and Sweden . ( At that men ' s tournament. ) &quot; I got kind of hot . I wanted to shout : ' Wait a minute . We did win a world championship. ' &quot; Stanley traveled_to China for those 12-team finals in 1991 . They were the first actual world championships for women , fully backed by FIFA . Oh , except , once again , there was one thing missing . It wasn ' t called World Cup . As Stanley recalls , &quot; They said there ' s only one World Cup , and that ' s the men ' s World Cup. &quot; Funny , I thought there was only one Olympics , for men and women . Are American women any good at soccer ? Here ' s how good . In qualifying rounds for the ' 91 finals , they outscored their opposition , 49-0 . Then they wiped_out their first-round group , Sweden , Brazil and Japan . Then they played Chinese Taipei and squeaked_by . . . 7-0 . Then they took_care of Germany in the semifinal , 5-2 , with Carin Gabarra scoring three times in the opening 32 minutes . And then they won the final over Norway , 2-1 , after which Seattle native Michelle Akers-Stahl was awarded the &quot; golden boot &quot; for most goals . And then they came_home . The champions were met at the airport in New York by exactly one man , carrying flowers . Stanley says , &quot; Not only did our women win the championship of the world without anybody knowing we did_it , nobody seemed to even know that such a thing even existed. &quot; The official U.S. soccer guide has 160 pages . The women get three . And yet , as goalkeeper Amy Allman later said , &quot; It ' s better than one page. &quot; Some of the women from the U.S. team are hardly school kids . Allman , for example , coaches at the University of New Mexico . And one of the top players is Joy Fawcett , who broke scoring records at the University of California and now coaches UCLA . Even though she just had a baby a_few weeks ago , Fawcett played soccer at last week ' s U.S. Olympic Festival in St . Louis . Women can make a good living playing soccer . Akers-Stahl is quite successful in a pro league in Sweden . Mary Harvey , a 5-foot-4 goalkeeper from Cal , plays in the same league . Competition is prospering in other parts of the world as well . &quot; It ' s a long , slow haul , &quot; says Stanley , who is working for SoccerFest during World Cup ' 94 and laboring with a women ' s soccer foundation to educate more of the world that men aren ' t the only ones who know how to kick a ball . &quot; Some of the top teams I ' ve seen so far , Norway , Sweden , our own , come from countries with a slightly more liberated attitude toward women . But things seem to be improving everywhere . &quot; Still , I ' ll have to ask some of these Brazil people this weekend , do they even know that Brazil has a women ' s team ? &quot; I ' ll ask too . After all , women ' s soccer will be a medal sport at the Summer Olympics in 1996 for the first time . How about a women ' s World Cup in 1998 , same as the men ' s ? American women . Bulgarian women . Nigerian women . Norwegian women . Korean women . Saudi_Arabian women . Well , Saudi men might have something to say about that . Otherwise , though , this has real possibilities .</TEXT>
