   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; CITY LAUDS COWBOY POETRY FEST ' S BOTTOM_LINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> City officials are heralding the three-day Cowboy Poetry , Music and Film Festival as a &quot; huge success &quot; because it cost the city under $ 2 # 700 to sponsor , tens of thousands of dollars less than originally anticipated . &quot; We think that if the earthquake hadn ' t happened , we would have made money on this , &quot; said spokeswoman Gail Foy . City staff originally estimated that the event , held the weekend of March 25 , could cost the city as much as $ 43 # 000 to sponsor . Following the Northridge earthquake , expenses were expected to rise when the location had to be switched from the quake-damaged Hart High_School auditorium to Melody Ranch , which cost $ 15 # 000 to rent . City officials are expecting to receive $ 22 # 500 in FEMA funds to help offset the additional costs incurred due_to the quake , which will leave with a $ 2 # 697 bill for the event , Foy said . Foy also said that 3 # 255 festival tickets were sold_out of a possible 3 # 625 . City officials estimate that the event pumped $ 244 # 000 into the local economy , with the average festival-goer spending more_than $ 81 in the Santa Clarita Valley . Festival organizers had wanted to create a large-scale tourist event that would bring visitors to Santa Clarita to strengthen the 6-year-old city ' s economy .</TEXT>
