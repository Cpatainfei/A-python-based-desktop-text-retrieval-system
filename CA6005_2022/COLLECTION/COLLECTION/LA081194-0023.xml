   <HEADLINE> POP_MUSIC REVIEW ; THEE HYPNOTICS PROVIDE A STONE-COLD TROUBADOUR SHOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Between record company chief Rick Rubin ' s weakness for classic-cum-retro acts ( e.g. , the Cult , Black Crowes ) and the clone mentality of their record producer ( Black Crowe Chris Robinson ) , it wasn ' t exactly a surprise that Thee Hypnotics would come_across like a Rolling Stones homage in their show at the Troubadour on Tuesday . The English band wore the scruffy , surly look of the brat-era Stones like a costume , but didn ' t have the charisma to bring it to life.The group ' s variations on the Stones ' bedrock style lacked an individual stamp , and singer Jim Jones gave no sense of commenting on the poses he and the players were adopting -- as if they were meant to be taken seriously at face_value . Even in this deeply indebted state , the band has come_up with some flavorful moments on its last two albums , but at the Troubadour it bypassed its murky trance grooves and haunted lounge music and went straight to its more straightforward , harder-edged material , finding its best moment in the oozing country lament &quot; Goodbye. &quot; * Thee Hypnotics play tonight at the Foothill , 1922 Cherry Ave. , Long_Beach , 9 p.m. $ 7 . ( 310 ) 984-8349 . RICHARD CROMELIN</TEXT>
