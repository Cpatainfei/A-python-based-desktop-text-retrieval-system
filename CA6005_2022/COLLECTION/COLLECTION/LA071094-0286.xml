   <HEADLINE> GOSSIP_COLUMNIST TO THE NERDS ; DIGGING_UP THE DIGITAL DIRT IN SILICON_VALLEY WITH ROBERT X . CRINGELY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The cursor on the computer_screen pulsates like a racing heartbeat as Robert X . Cringely , gossip_columnist to Silicon_Valley , searches expectantly for a hot tip . Cringely ' s office at InfoWorld , the PC trade publication where his weekly &quot; Notes From the Field &quot; column appears , is really a giant nerve_center . Most days , he receives about 30 e-mail messages , a dozen faxes and letters and two_dozen voice-mail messages from assorted techno-weenies imparting confidential details about a product , embarrassing behavior by management or a juicy tidbit about a competitor . Today , it ' s inside_information about Microsoft ' s upcoming version of Windows , code-named &quot; Chicago &quot; ; tomorrow it will be word that a poorly designed piece of Apple software can send your fax to the wrong person . Cringely is Silicon_Valley ' s Father Confessor , but he definitely hasn ' t taken a vow of confidentiality . Every week , he pans through the slurry of information that flows his way and prints the best nuggets . Cringely ' s work is widely praised ( mostly by computer grunts ) , almost as widely vilified ( mostly by executives ) , but it is seldom ignored by those in the industry . &quot; His stuff is wonderfully cranky and irreverent , which I think Silicon_Valley deserves , &quot; says management guru Tom Peters . The notion that this industry could spawn a gossip_columnist may seem strange at first . But inside_information is the grease that lubricates the entire computer_business . Like politics and the entertainment_industry , high-tech companies are in the business of selling what is essentially vapor . In all three industries , big promises are made ( &quot; No new taxes ! &quot; &quot; ' Last Action Hero ' is Schwarzenegger ' s best ! &quot; &quot; This is the last software upgrade you ' ll ever need ! &quot; ) that often don ' t live_up_to their advance billing . that ' s where Robert X . Cringely , the digital Liz Smith , comes_in . Cringely isn ' t his real name , but it might as well be . During the seven years he ' s written the column , the 41-year old former foreign correspondent and Stanford professor , who came_to work_at InfoWorld because he needed the cash , has become Bob Cringely . Many times , even he can ' t tell the difference . &quot; I ' m a method journalist , &quot; Cringely says . &quot; I sit_down at my desk and I become Bob . My life is like the movie ' Groundhog Day. ' I go_to_sleep and wake_up and I ' m Bob again . Bob has his own phone_line and whenever I answer it , I ' m Bob . I have people I ' ve talked to every day for seven years as Bob. &quot; Cringely is more_than merely a cyber-gossip , a repeater of tales told out of school . He ' s a keen observer of the computer world , bringing a sense_of_humor and perspective to an industry that ' s sorely lacking in both . By being technically savvy enough to understand the world of computer nerds while not quite being clever enough to threaten them , he has managed to access the inner workings of the industry . With computer magazines now one of the hottest fields in publishing , Cringely is not without competition : John C . Dvorak writes for several magazines and a pseudonymous Spencer F . Katt pens a &quot; Rumor Central &quot; column for PC Week . But Cringely ' s incisiveness and subversive humor have made him the columnist computer people turn_to first . Cringely portrays himself as a kind of Information Age Philip Marlowe , rooting_out the shadowy mysteries of Silicon_Valley . Every column contains two or three exclusive news_items about a product not living_up_to its billing , surrounded by a running serial of his life , loves and battles with the barons of the computer world . His lack of reverence for the industry ' s giants is neatly summarized by the title of his 1992 book , &quot; Accidental Empires -- How the Boys of Silicon_Valley Make their Millions , Battle Foreign Competition , and Still can ' t Get a Date. &quot; To Cringely ' s heretical way of thinking , the computer_industry happened more or less by accident , the people who made_it happen were amateurs and , for the most part , still are . Cringely has his pudgy finger on the throbbing pulse of Silicon_Valley , where the winners download giga-bucks and the losers stare at a taunting message that forever flashes across their computer_screens : Abort ? Retry ? Ignore ? WE ' RE WITH BOB IN A GARAGE IN PALO ALTO NOW , ON ONE OF HIS many field trips to the future of Silicon_Valley . There aren ' t any cars in the garage , just five computers sitting on an L-shaped table . Bob ' s here to take a test_drive of a new software program developed by six Stanford_University graduates , three of whom live_in the adjoining house . To picture the space , think_back to the group house you shared with your friends after high_school -- the vacant refrigerator , the tumbleweed-sized dust balls , the cloth sofa that gave_off a cloud of dust every time someone sat on it . But instead of using this space to throw keg parties , the six Stanford grads pooled $ 15 # 000 of_their_own venture_capital and went_into the garage to develop a new piece of software that searches databases more efficiently than anything now on the market . Joe Kraus and Graham Spencer , two of the young Stanford whizzes , sit Cringely down in front of a computer and begin to demonstrate the new software designed by their firm , Architext . Kraus is president of the fledgling operation , which is why he ' s the only one wearing a tie . Spencer is the main software designer , which is why he ' s wearing a scratchy wool shirt with a white undershirt peeking underneath . The program they ' ve come_up with basically allows users to navigate very efficiently through large databases . Imagine you ' ve been assigned by your company to find_out about trade_policy in Singapore . In a conventional database search , this can be a very time-consuming chore . If you type in the word &quot; Singapore &quot; in a database containing recent newspapers , magazines and trade journals , you ' re likely to get_back a mammoth list of stories about Michael Fay being caned -- interesting , but unlikely to please your boss . You could narrow your search by typing in &quot; Singapore / trade_policy / United States , &quot; but you ' d still get_back too many stories and only those that contained those specific words . The Architext program allows you to simply type in &quot; trade_policy in Singapore &quot; and get_back a compact list of citations , even those that don ' t contain the same words as your query . Among human endeavors , this may_not rank with the development of the polio vaccine , but thousands of companies are desperate for tools to make_sense of the wealth of information they can get electronically . &quot; Right now , we have information overload , &quot; says Cringely . &quot; We have instant access to everything , which means we have insight into nothing . The trick is , how do you extract knowledge from all that information ? Those are the tools we need to take the next step_in computing. &quot; Cringely is impressed with Architext , and even more so with the practicality of the Stanford whizzes . He hears from garage entrepreneurs all_the time , many of whom don ' t have a very strong real-world orientation . Cringely knows one tinkerer who claims to have developed a superior computer_architecture that unfortunately involves throwing_out everything that ' s been invented up until now . But the six Stanford grads , running_on rice , beans and moxie , have come_up with a practical product that ' s already attracted the interest of several companies . They are now trying to persuade four large firms to invest in their software , It ' s this adolescent enthusiasm that Cringely believes is America ' s secret weapon in world trade , particularly against the Japanese . The first generation of computer hackers , of which Bill Gates and Apple ' s Steve Wozniak are the most famous examples , were socially inept nerds who didn ' t conform_to the usual teen-age standards of masculinity and coolness . Their solution was to create a new_world in which they set the standards . The 1990s version of the young computer wizard is somewhat more interested in making money than impressing his peers , but shares much of the same &quot; I ' ll show them &quot; adolescent defiance . This , Cringely says , puts the Japanese , who place a premium on conformity and teamwork , at a considerable disadvantage . The Japanese may have more efficient workers , but we ' ve got better geeks . When the Architext demonstration is over , we depart through the kitchen , passing a 50-pound bag of California white_rice . &quot; It ' s almost empty , &quot; one of the wizards says ruefully . Cringely gets_in his car and heads north on 101 , back to his office in San Mateo . As we pass_through bedroom communities that owe their existence to tiny wafers of silicon , he reflects on prospects facing the valley ' s newest players . &quot; The move_out of the garage will be more wrenching than they expect , &quot; says Cringely . &quot; And there will come a day when Joe , the guy with the tie , finds_out he ' s not the head business guy any more . But that ' s two years down the line . These guys are going_to do just fine. &quot; WHEN CRINGELY RETURNS TO HIS OFFICE , AN EAGER INFORMANT is cooling his heels at reception . The publisher of a national telephone_directory on CD-ROM has shown_up with news about one of his competitors . Needless to say , the news is not good . According to the tipster , his competitor ' s product has been dropped_by several software distributors because of faulty data . And not only that , the product claims to have 80 million phone listings when it really only has 69 million . Cringely jots_down the information without committing himself to anything . &quot; Well , there ' s nothing earth-shattering there , &quot; he says after the tipster leaves . &quot; False advertising is the norm in the computer_business . You always see features advertised on the box that aren ' t in the product . They used to put black tape over the features they took_out , but they don ' t do that anymore because they think it looks tacky . Honesty is tacky . I like that. &quot; Cringely assiduously cultivates his sources , which sometimes involves laying_down a fine layer of manure . By feigning interest in even the most inconsequential tip , he lays the groundwork for the source to bear fruit later . Someone in the product support division of a large computer company recently e-mailed Cringely with news that former California Gov . Jerry Brown was using an NCR Safari notebook , and not only that -- he had just ordered new batteries ! Cringely messaged back and said , uh , thanks , keep me in mind if you come_across anything else interesting . &quot; So the guy comes_back a_few days later with this e-mail message , &quot; smiles Cringely , calling_up a large document on his computer . &quot; It ' s a history of all_of the products his company produces , what works and what doesn ' t . And it ' s signed &quot; Deep Throat. ' &quot; They always sign it Deep Throat . He says his informants generally fall_into three categories . Some are proud_of their product but are afraid that it won ' t be marketed correctly , or at all . Another group is genuinely ashamed of a shoddy product they ' ve worked_on and want to warn customers away from it . And a third spills the beans out of sheer defiance of authority . Cringely twice received a file containing all_of Apple ' s products for the next two years from an employee who was peeved at senior management . He and other InfoWorld staffers used the information in a series of stories about the new_line . Cringely takes pains to keep his true identity a secret , but it ' s more to build_up the character ' s mystique than to protect his flow of information . The man behind the Cringely mask looks a little like Clark Kent , a self-described &quot; pasty white boy &quot; with thick glasses and gray-flecked hair . He attended the College of Wooster in Ohio , worked for the town newspaper and , for lack of a better idea after graduation , became a free-lance foreign correspondent for more_than a dozen daily papers , reporting from trouble spots in Northern_Ireland , Lebanon , Beirut and Africa . He interviewed Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi and noticed the slavish cult_of_personality that surrounded him , which Cringely says helped him understand Bill Gates and his operation at Microsoft . He moved to Northern California in 1977 to attend Stanford , where he received a Ph.D in public affairs communication . He remained at Stanford until 1983 as an assistant_professor of journalism and immersed himself in Silicon_Valley ' s emerging computer culture . He went_to meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club , an organization of techno-geeks , where Steve Wozniak unveiled what would become the first Apple computer . Cringely joined InfoWorld as a reporter / editor , but it wasn ' t until the gossip_columnist position opened_up in 1987 that his cyber-destiny was fulfilled . Two other InfoWorld journalists had written briefly under the Cringely name , but didn ' t exploit the character ' s potential the way the third Cringely would . Seven years into the enterprise , Cringely Version 3.0 has built an Accidental Empire of_his_own . His book about Silicon_Valley has been published in England and Japan and made_it into a paperback edition in America . Cringely makes periodic speaking engagements , recently addressing a roomful of appreciative engineers at NASA ' s Goddard Space Flight Center near Washington , D.C. In addition to his weekly InfoWorld column , Cringely ' s musings appear on eWorld , Apple Computer ' s new on-line service and he will host a handful of shows next year on PBS . Slipping_in and out of the Cringely persona has its advantages . &quot; When something goes_wrong , Bob Cringely takes the blame , &quot; says &quot; Cringely , &quot; momentarily stepping_out of character . &quot; I just let it roll_off . I ' m actually kind of a sensitive guy . When I make mistakes -- and I sometimes do -- I feel horrible. &quot; Cringely says he ' s a softy at heart , and besides , all_the mean things he says about the computer_industry are true . But there are those who believe Cringely himself could stand a lesson in the truth . Some in the Silicon_Valley are convinced that Cringely ' s liveliest anecdotes are distortions , if not downright fabrications . One such story that appeared in Cringely ' s book involves Bill Gates , presented to underscore the Microsoft founder ' s arrogance . Gates had just demonstrated a new Microsoft product in Ann Arbor when , according to Cringely and his sources , he decided he still had a_few things left to prove . Gates , a little drunk at the time , Cringely says , sat in the passenger seat while a companion drove him around the town . Suddenly , Gates commanded the car to stop alongside a group of young blacks standing at a corner . Cringely picks_up the story in his book : &quot; What ' s happening ! &quot; the pencil-necked billionaire cheerfully greeted the assembled boom boxers , who had clearly no idea who or what he was -- this bespectacled white boy with greasy blond hair and bratwurst skin , wearing a blue and white plaid polyester shirt and green pullover sweater . &quot; Bill , let ' s go someplace else , &quot; called Gates ' companion from the driver ' s seat . &quot; Yeah , Bill , go someplace else , &quot; said one of the young blacks . &quot; Nah , I want to rap . I can talk to these guys , you ' ll see ! &quot; Gates has said he has no memory of the incident , and his companion in the car , Laurie Flynn , a free-lance computer columnist for the New York Times , says Cringely ' s account is greatly exaggerated . Gates may have exchanged a_few words with someone as he got_into the car , Flynn says , but there wasn ' t any prolonged confrontation or insistence on wanting &quot; to rap. &quot; &quot; I thought ( Cringely ' s ) book was brilliant , but I don ' t think he ' s afraid to twist anecdotes to make_a_point , &quot; Flynn says . ( Flynn , incidentally , was the second of three journalists to have written InfoWorld ' s gossip column under the Cringely pseudonym. ) Cringely stands behind the story as well as his other caustic characterizations -- that Lotus founder Mitch Kapor is guilt-ridden because of his success , that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs is an insecure , narcissistic totalitarian and that Microsoft is a frat_house that feeds_on its young . &quot; Most of the people who are angry are unhappy about being characterized , &quot; says Cringely . &quot; They can ' t stand the fact that I try to explain the motivation behind their actions. &quot; Perhaps it ' s fair to say that Cringely sometimes sacrifices accuracy in pursuit of larger truths . He ' s not the computer_industry ' s Boswell -- he ' s more its Aesop , spinning tales with a moral . &quot; His isn ' t the official picture of the valley , &quot; offers Tom Peters . &quot; But people there tend to take themselves a little too seriously. &quot; CRINGELY ' S SKIN STARTS TO take_on an iridescent glow after a day in front of a computer , so he welcomes an opportunity to get_out of the office . We hop in the Cringemobile and head for Sunnyvale , the unofficial capital of Silicon_Valley , on another field trip . We stop at Pacific Data Images , a leading computer_graphics company . PDI is responsible_for many computer-generated special_effects seen in movies and on television -- the animated &quot; scrubbing bubbles &quot; that whisk your bathtub clean , the &quot; Monday Night Football &quot; opening in which two helmets crash together and explode and the 1993 Bud Bowl . Who says America has lost its competitive edge ? PDI ' s facility consists_of a large , softly lit room divided into dozens of computer work stations . Enthusiasm pervades the building , as it does at companies all_over the Silicon_Valley . Cringely peers over the shoulder of an animator who ' s working_on a commercial that will feature cats talking_about the smell of their litter box . Using sophisticated computer software for a cat litter commercial may seem like a frivolous application of the technology and -- let ' s face it -- it is . It might be nice to think that the information superhighway may one day allow teams of doctors in different cities to confer about a medical crisis , but don ' t be surprised if its primary use is delivering &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; on demand to millions of customers . &quot; It takes about 20 years for an information technology to go from being an idea in the lab to product used by millions of people , &quot; says Cringely . &quot; So , in a sense , everything we ' re going to use in 10 years already exists . It ' s just not clear how it ' s going_to be used. &quot; The next stop is Woodside , where Cringely checks_up_on the progress of his friend , software entrepreneur Joe Adler . Adler , a short , puckish Englishman , has been hard at_work launching start-up companies in the Silicon_Valley . He ' s on the verge of launching his third business , which will offer a software_package called Magic Theatre . It lets children make their own movies with music , sound_effects and narration by clicking a mouse , speaking into a microphone and choosing illustrations -- no keyboard is necessary . Adler refined Magic Theatre by testing it on his preschool daughter for about a year . &quot; Most software for children is based on the theory that there ' s knowledge out there that you capture on a CD-ROM and then children come_along and unlock it , &quot; Adler tells Cringely . &quot; I don ' t believe that at all . Knowledge is what happens in a child ' s mind. &quot; Cringely ' s last stop is to a computer surplus store in Sunnyvale called the Weird Stuff Warehouse . Weird Stuff is where computer_technology goes_to die . Its musty shelves are cluttered with old computers , printers , monitors and peripherals sold to hobbyists at a fraction of their original cost . This is the computer world ' s graveyard , and the names on the tombstones are some of the biggest in the business -- IBM , Digital , Atari , Hewlett-Packard . Bob loves this place ; he ' s like a kid in a candy_store . &quot; Look ! &quot; he exclaims , holding a huge piece of plastic the size of an Amazon breast plate against his chest . &quot; It ' s a 13 1 / 2-inch floppy_disk ! Can you believe how big this is ? And it doesn ' t hold as much data as floppies do now that are a quarter of its size. &quot; The computer_industry ' s growth so far has depended_on built-in obsolescence , where today ' s breakthrough is tomorrow ' s scrap . The turnover of both products and people is accelerating , but no one here seems to be looking_back . No wonder Silicon_Valley is so giddy about the future -- it ' s becoming a land without a past . &quot; The same things happen over and over again in the computer_business , &quot; says Cringely . &quot; People in this industry have a very short institutional memory. &quot; that ' s where Robert X . Cringely comes_in , Silicon_Valley ' s own memory expansion kit .</TEXT>
