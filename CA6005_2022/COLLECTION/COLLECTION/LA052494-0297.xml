   <HEADLINE> OVERSEAS BUSINESS A BOON FOR LOCKHEED AIR_TERMINAL INC. ; TRANSPORTATION : GROWTH IN THE AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS WILL COME FROM SOUTH_AMERICA , ASIA AND EASTERN EUROPE , AS GOVERNMENTS PUSH FOR MODERN , WESTERN-STYLE AIRFIELDS TO SPUR THEIR ECONOMIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lockheed Air_Terminal Inc. , one of Lockheed Corp. ' s smaller businesses , has been quietly and profitably running Burbank Airport since the 1920s . But for Lockheed , the future growth in the airport business is overseas . Although the company has slowly expanded to provide services to 20 other U.S. airports in recent years , Lockheed expects business in South_America , Asia and eastern Europe to overtake its domestic airport business by the end of the decade , thanks to a burgeoning foreign market for private airport management and development services . Developing nations are now clamoring for state-of-the-art , Western-style airports , considered a key to economic development . Many countries are considering privatization plans , including Australia , Argentina and Khanty-Mansiysk , a remote outpost of Siberia -- all markets where Lockheed Air_Terminal has been studying possible airport projects . &quot; A significant number of international airports will be privately operated and we expect to have our fair share , &quot; said Lockheed Air_Terminal President Viggo Butler . Granted , Lockheed Air_Terminal is still a small piece within aerospace giant Lockheed Corp. , which is headquartered in Calabasas . Analysts estimate Lockheed Air_Terminal ' s annual revenues at under $ 100 million per year , compared to $ 13 billion for Lockheed Corp . At the moment , the only foreign airport Lockheed manages is the Lester B . Pearson International Airport in Toronto , Ontario . The company was a partner in a group that built the $ 480-million terminal , which opened in 1991 and includes a shopping_center . Lockheed is now a minority owner and still manages that terminal , which has been a money maker from the start , the company said . But the next stage of growth in the airport market worldwide seems to be from developing nations that want to develop modernized airports . Lockheed is already involved in some airport projects in the former Soviet_Union . In Khanty-Mansiysk , an autonomous oil-producing region of Siberia , the government hired Lockheed to draft a development scheme for a new terminal . Currently , Khanty-Mansiysk depends_on barges to transport cargo , but its waterways are frozen all but four months a year , so the region needs an airport ready to handle cargo year-round . In Turkmenistan , in the former Soviet_Union , Lockheed led a consortium that is now finishing a $ 150-million runway and airport terminal , installing everything from conveyor_belts to handle baggage , to air conditioning in the sweltering airport . Regions once geared only for travel behind the iron_curtain must now update their airports to accommodate Western air traffic , said Robert Aaronson , executive_vice_president of Lockheed Air_Terminal . &quot; Airports , unlike most other infrastructure , generate most their revenues in hard currency -- hard , foreign currency , &quot; which is why developing nations are interested in privatizing airports , said Robert Poole , president of the Reason Foundation , a Los Angeles-based , economic think_tank which specializes in privatization issues . Meanwhile , more developed countries are privatizing their airports in search of cheaper ways to run or expand airports . The Australian government may sell some of its 23 airports to the private sector . Lockheed Air_Terminal would like to bid on the Australian airports if they are put_up for_sale , and the company is looking_into similar projects in Eastern Europe , South_America and Asia . In the airport development and management business , Lockheed Air_Terminal &quot; is really the only real U.S. player on a world scale now , &quot; according to Poole . But others are hastening to get_in on the boom . A unit of Hughes Aircraft Co . is completing negotiations with the airport authority of Trinidad_and_Tobago . Hughes will lead an international team that will build a new $ 80-million terminal in that sunny , oil-producing , former outpost of the_British empire . And Hughes said it has completed studies for the Ukraine on ways to upgrade that country ' s airports . One reason is that the Ukraine wants to transform the Crimea , site of successive military invasions , into a tourist hot spot , said Dan Reeder , spokesman for Hughes Aircraft Co . Analysts say the airport market overseas should be plenty to keep Lockheed Air_Terminal busy . The company is girding itself for further expansion . Since last fall , four new executives , including Aaronson , have been brought_in to help steer the company into international markets . Aaronson is the former president and executive_officer of the Air Transport Assn . of America , and was also director of aviation at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , where he was responsible_for management of Kennedy International and La Guardia airports . Lockheed Air_Terminal is also awaiting word on its bid for a contract to supervise construction of a new airport terminal in Istanbul , Turkey . Lockheed has been asked by governments in Hungary , Argentina and Venezuela to make suggestions for possible airport improvement projects . And the company has completed a study on a possible new airport terminal in Beijing , China , again at the government ' s request . Driving the market for private airport projects abroad are governments that aspire for economic_growth , but don ' t have the means to provide the infrastructure . Poorer nations are under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to avoid debt , and many see privatization as an alternative . &quot; Developing nations are recognizing that airports are a part of economic development and they see airport expansion as a key , &quot; said Hensley Evans , manager of the international privatization group of Price Waterhouse in Washington , D.C. But the emerging airport market overseas , though promising , is marred by political uncertainties , warned Wolfgang Demisch , analyst for BT Securities Corp . In Canada , after last year ' s parliamentary elections , the new government withdrew from an agreement to hire private companies , including Lockheed , to revamp two more terminals at the Toronto airport . But Lockheed Air_Terminal ' s Butler said that the risks of airport development and management are not as great as in other enterprises . After all , an airport amounts to a public_utility , and so &quot; You have a certain measurable traffic that goes_through these cities and you can predict over time what that traffic will be , &quot; he said . The company ' s roots in the airport business date_back to 1929 when it was called United Airport Co. , then a part of United Airlines . The company was sold to the Lockheed Corp . in 1940 , said Butler , and it once owned and operated Burbank Airport . In 1978 , it sold the airport to the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority , but Lockheed stayed_on as airport manager and now manages the complex there , overseeing aviation safety , maintenance , construction and a host of other operations . Although Lockheed Air_Terminal ' s attention is mostly focused overseas , the company still hopes to line_up more domestic contracts . When Richard Riordan ran_for mayor , he talked_of leasing all or part of Los Angeles International Airport to the private sector to raise additional money for the city . The suggestion has since been shelved , but not for lack of effort by Lockheed Air_Terminal . The company poured $ 158 # 000 into lobbying city officials for privatization in 1993 -- the second largest corporate lobby to the Los Angeles city government that year . And if Mayor Riordan ever revives his plans to privatize LAX , Lockheed officials promise they ' ll be first in_line to bid on that project too .</TEXT>
