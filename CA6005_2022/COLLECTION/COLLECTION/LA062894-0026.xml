   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; MEXICAN POLITICS ' ENDANGERED SPECIES ; CARLOS HANK GONZALEZ REPRESENTS THE LAST OF A GRAND LINE OF TECHNOCRATS . HIS IMPENDING RETIREMENT HAS SPARKED SPECULATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carlos Hank Gonzalez , friends and foes agree , is a rare and endangered species in Mexican politics . What they disagree on is exactly which species he is . Critics call the 66-year-old agriculture minister a dinosaur , a remnant of an age when labor bosses and party hacks ruled the country , throwing bones to the faithful and punishing the disloyal . Admirers say that in an administration of technocrats , Hank stands_out as a real politician with an easy smile , ready handshake and compelling baritone . Hank ' s announcement last month -- following a skirmish with the new electoral law -- that he will retire from politics in December , at the end of this administration , has set_off a flurry of speculation . For decades , Hank has headed one of the country ' s most cohesive and powerful political_movements , the Atlacomulco Group , based in the industrial state of Mexico just outside the capital . His disciples run the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and the attorney_general ' s office , which is prosecuting the alleged assassin of Luis Donaldo Colosio -- the ruling party ' s presidential candidate until he was shot dead in Tijuana on March 23 . Hank is one of the few Mexican politicians who is also a successful businessman . Grupo Hermes , which Hank founded and which is now run_by his son , Carlos , is one of the largest family_businesses in Mexico , with interests in transport , manufacturing and telecommunications . His other son , Jorge , runs the family ' s racetrack and off-track gambling business in Tijuana . &quot; Hank is one of the richest_men in the country , with huge political and economic power -- which is something that none of the richest businessmen have and something that none of the most powerful politicians have , &quot; said a politician from his home state . The man insisted that his name not be used &quot; because I don ' t want to spend the next administration in exile. &quot; Hank inspires the same fear-tinged respect in Mexico today that the late President Lyndon B . Johnson enjoyed in Washington . Comparisons between the two arise inevitably in conversations about Hank : the same lanky frames , beginnings as country schoolteachers , famous ranches and a penchant for wheeling and dealing that turned them into wealthy and influential men . But unlike LBJ , Hank dropped the country-boy manner in favor of cashmere suits , elegant wit and a kitchen that rivals that of the presidential residence . Another difference is that Hank will almost surely never be president : A Mexican law , effective until 2000 , when he will be 72 , bars children of immigrants such_as him from the Mexican presidency . Still , many Mexicans believe that the assassination of Colosio could bring Hank almost as much power as the assassination of President John F . Kennedy brought Johnson . If Colosio ' s replacement , Ernesto Zedillo , is elected Aug . 21 , Hank is widely expected to become the power behind the throne . &quot; If Zedillo were to win , he would need the connections Hank has to elements in the party that otherwise would not be enthusiastic about a Zedillo presidency , &quot; said Roderic Camp , a political_scientist at Tulane University who has studied the relationships within the Mexican elite . Hank showed that influence a_few days after Zedillo , an economist , was named to replace the slain Colosio . In full-page ads in national newspapers and magazines , Cabinet_ministers from the last four administrations pledged their support to the new PRI candidate . Hank organized the ads , in a move that caused a political scandal . The opposition National Action Party filed a complaint accusing him of violating the new federal election laws by using federal employees ' time and government property to coordinate the signatures . The attorney_general decided that there was not enough evidence to prosecute Hank , who said that he and six others had paid nearly $ 70 # 000 for the ads and that employees had volunteered their own time to help_out . A few days later , Hank announced that he would retire from politics at the end of this administration . However , it soon became clear that the retirement was hardly_a defeat . Ignacio Pichardo , a longtime Hank confidant , became chairman of the PRI a_few days later . Hank ' s right-hand_man at the Agriculture Ministry became Zedillo ' s chief_of_staff . When a new attorney_general was chosen , another Hank aide , Humberto Benitez , filled the slot . &quot; He is really in a strong position now , &quot; said Raul Monje , a reporter at the independent political magazine Proceso , who covered Hank when he was the appointed mayor of Mexico_City a decade ago . Hank has a reputation for fighting his way back from political defeats that rivals that of the late President Richard Nixon . By all accounts , he learned at an early age . He was born in 1927 in the village of Tianguistenco near the capital . Growing_up as the son of a German immigrant in highly nationalistic Mexico was not easy . The stigma followed him even though his father , Jorge Hank , a teacher at the military college , died in a motorcycle accident when Hank was 3 . Hank was a PRI loyalist before he could vote , becoming secretary_general of his state ' s Youth Federation when he was 17 . His political career really started a_few years later when he was a teacher in Atlacomulco , cradle of Mexico state politicians . There he caught the eye of Isidro Fabela , former governor and founder of the Atlacomulco Group . The group was most notable for its drive to transform the rural state into an industrial force and for its virtual stranglehold on the governor ' s mansion . From there , Hank moved_up through the ranks of the state education bureaucracy . He was elected mayor of the state_capital , Toluca , in 1955 and then served a term in the state legislature . He showed his acumen for combining politics and business in the 1960s when he held positions of increasing responsibility in the government basic commodities company , known as CONASUPO . CONASUPO had problems moving grain . Hank founded what by all accounts was a highly efficient trucking_company and won CONASUPO as a customer . &quot; It ' s difficult to say that under the legal framework he has done something wrong , &quot; a home-state politician said of Hank ' s business dealings . &quot; But it is always on the line. &quot; With a more secure personal economic base , in 1969 Hank became governor of Mexico state . Without forgetting his old friends from Atlacomulco , he also included members of a rival state political group in his government . &quot; Professor Hank succeeded in unifying the two most important political groups in local politics , &quot; said Miguel Basanez , who coordinated a monograph on the political power_structure in Mexico state . Just as remarkable , during an era of conflict between business and government on a national level , Hank maintained excellent relations with industrialists in his state . He created industrial_parks and encouraged manufacturers to locate there . During his term , manufacturing ' s share of state employment rose from 35 % to 40 % . His own businesses prospered also . He recruited bright , young administrators , such_as Ignacio Pichardo , who had just finished a postgraduate degree at the London School of Economics when Hank was elected governor . Unsure of himself , he often tried to seek the governor ' s advice before making a decision , Pichardo recalled . The governor was never available . &quot; He did that on purpose , to force me to make a decision and take responsibility for it , &quot; Pichardo said . &quot; He always said , ' If you are going_to make a mistake , do_it quickly , so that we can fix it quickly. ' &quot; Hank is known as an excellent administrator , who knows how to delegate and how to spend money -- lots of money . And that reputation followed him to Mexico_City when he became mayor in 1976 . &quot; He was a real spendthrift , &quot; said journalist Monje . &quot; The beat reporters loved him when he was mayor . He once took the whole city_hall press corps to Europe. &quot; In his six years as mayor of Mexico_City , he got the nickname Genghis Hank as he ripped_up neighborhood parks , destroyed fountains and moved colonial statues to create a system of fast-moving boulevards . Hank also handed_out building_permits at a breakneck pace -- without sufficient planning , some critics say . Hank ' s policies , along with the oil boom , created a spurt of growth for the city . But the mayor ' s prodigal ways got him into constant trouble with Miguel de la Madrid , the planning and budget minister , who was charged with keeping spending under_control . Unfortunately for Hank , De la Madrid became the next president . The free-spending former mayor was thrown into political purgatory for six years . President Carlos Salinas de Gortari revived Hank ' s career , naming him tourism minister in 1989 . &quot; One thing that helps to sustain Hank is his extensive network of contacts , &quot; said Camp . &quot; He is attractive as an ally when you yourself don ' t have extensive networks. &quot; Camp estimates that Hank had five to 10 times as_many supporters as Salinas did when he took_office . Hank still works hard to keep building that support . He knows how to work a room , greeting everyone individually with his famous smile . But he has a reputation for being just as tough as he is gracious . &quot; When you start to accumulate that much power you can ' t be soft , &quot; said the home-state politician . &quot; There is so_much involved. &quot; Union leaders at the Agriculture Ministry last year accused him of kidnaping and torturing union_member Eduardo Hernandez to halt his hunger_strike over a labor dispute . The accusations were never proven . Hank ' s influence in a possible Zedillo presidential administration is expected to be pragmatic . He is most likely to advocate policies that will increase his power without much emphasis on ideological concerns , say some observers . &quot; Through his position , he will be able to affect the careers of the people in his political group , &quot; Camp said . Zedillo could be expected to choose a good portion of his aides from among Hank loyalists . Hank ' s pledge to retire met with skepticism . &quot; He may_not hold any Cabinet post or public office , &quot; said the politician , &quot; but the only way he will retire is if they lose the election. &quot; Biography Name : Carlos Hank Gonzalez Title : Mexico ' s agriculture minister .
