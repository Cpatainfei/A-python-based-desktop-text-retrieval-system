   <TEXT> Life in the waters off this icy continent is anything but a dream . The only way some animals stay alive , in fact , is through bizarre manipulation of chemicals . Some species of fish produce antifreeze 200 times more effective than what ' s in a car radiator . A small , shrimp-like animal called an amphipod carries an even smaller pteropod , a sea butterfly , clamped on its back to keep_from being devoured . The kidnaped pteropod harbors chemicals unpalatable to fish . Brightly colored sponges_on the bottom of McMurdo Sound contain chemicals that make them , unlike some of their drab relatives , distasteful to sponge-eating starfish . Otherwise defenseless nudibranchs -- &quot; naked snails &quot; -- have unique bioactive compounds in their bodies that prevent Antarctic fish and starfish from taking bites . A yard-long Antarctic sea worm covers itself with slimy , toxic mucus that turns predators away . The substance is so acidic that it leaves marks on divers ' gloves . Unable to flee , gaudy orange corals fill the water surrounding them with a chemical halo that scientists think broadcasts a clear message to predators : &quot; Don ' t even think_about tasting me. &quot; Why these things happen are mysteries being explored by several teams of scientists , supported by the National Science Foundation . &quot; It ' s an interesting detective game , &quot; said Mark H . Slattery , a graduate_student in marine ecology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham . The underwater sleuths have plenty to challenge them in the frigid , little-explored seas surrounding Antarctica . &quot; How can any organism stand water so cold ? &quot; asked William J . Baker of the Florida Institute of Technology . Some of the most interesting and least publicized research is being done on creatures of the benthos , the plants and animals that live_on the ocean_bottom . The research holds hope for new medicines and other practical_applications . &quot; It ' s a very different habitat than anything else in the world , &quot; said Paul K . Dayton , a marine ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Calif. , who began poking around in the Antarctic ooze more_than 20 years ago . In contrast to the younger , still-developing Arctic seas , Antarctica is ancient . It broke_away from the prehistoric southern megacontinent of Gondwana 40 million years ago and turned cold about 20 million years later . &quot; What you have is a very interesting relict population &quot; of plants and animals that became isolated 20 million years ago , &quot; Dayton said . In a marriage of scientific_disciplines , the co-leaders of Slattery ' s research team are chemist Baker and a marine ecologist , James B . McClintock of the University of Alabama at Birmingham . Wearing rubber &quot; dry suits &quot; over layers of long_underwear , the scientists dive for their specimens , disappearing beneath 6-foot-thick ice for 30 minutes or less at a time . For those rugged enough to dive in McMurdo Sound ' s crystalline waters , visibility is &quot; another order_of_magnitude &quot; better than in the Bahamas , McClintock said . With the exception of a_few weeks during the austral summer , a diver can see 1 # 000 feet in Antarctica , he said , whereas on a good_day in the Bahamas visibility is about 100 feet . The brief summer science season ended at McMurdo Station , the largest U.S. scientific and logistical base on the southernmost continent , in late February . Research continues in stateside laboratories . McClintock and his team have known since 1989 about the sea butterfly , which flutters in abundance through the Antarctic water without so_much as a nibble from hungry fish . &quot; Clearly it ' s chemically defended , &quot; McClintock said , while its amphipod captor , if unprotected by the toxicity of the abducted mollusk , is an easy meal . These amphipods may be Earth ' s only creatures to capitalize on another species ' chemistry in this way . This year Patrick Bryan , one of McClintock ' s students , identified the substance that makes the sea butterfly repugnant to fish . Chemical_defenses , often broadcast to predators by garish colors , are common in the world ' s oceans . But the bright red and green Antarctic sponges are a strange study in evolutionary development . Most waters teem with fish that see the colors and read their warning , much as birds stay_away_from Monarch_butterflies . But Antarctica has no visually oriented predators . What keeps starfish at arms ' length from the colored sponges is chemicals . Because the pigments themselves are bioactive , there ' s no evolutionary incentive for the sponges to lose their color . The first_step in solving such chemical puzzles is to grind up organisms in an electric blender in a McMurdo laboratory , separating their components . The components are tested further in the United States . Baker and other chemists collaborate with pharmacological and agrochemical companies in the search for practical_applications of marine chemicals . One substance from a bryozoan -- a moss_animal -- is being tested clinically as a potential anti-cancer agent . &quot; Organisms don ' t make chemicals for no reason , &quot; Baker said . &quot; The bottom_line is that there ' s a lot of inherent bioactivity in each of the molecules that these organisms make . While the organism may have made_it for the specific purpose of keeping a sea_star from eating it , there may be other roles the substance can play. &quot; The same might be said of the natural antifreeze compounds that protect certain Antarctic fish . The peculiar proteins were discovered by Arthur L . DeVries of the University of Illinois , who has been trying to unlock their secrets for more_than 30 years . He and his wife , fellow biologist Chris Cheng , are still hard at it . Their aquarium tanks at McMurdo are filled with large Antarctic &quot; cod &quot; -- not cod , actually , but Antarctic toothfish -- and small Antarctic eelpouts . Different types of proteins keep the fish from freezing . Commercial interests are seeking ways to use natural antifreeze in such diverse places as salmon hatcheries , operating_rooms , fruit orchards and vegetable fields . &quot; There hasn ' t yet been any proven widespread application or usefulness of the antifreeze compounds , &quot; Cheng said . &quot; There are many questions that haven ' t been solved , and in the process of solving them you have new questions to ask , &quot; she said . &quot; It will be a continuing process. &quot;</TEXT>
