   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : VAN NUYS ; ACTIVIST KEEPS ON FUMING ABOUT SMOKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Call him Mr. No Secondhand Smoke if you will . Back in the 1970s when Herm Perlmutter was a college_student , he asked a young_woman to dinner in a fancy restaurant . &quot; I didn ' t want to be inundated with cigarette smoke , &quot; Perlmutter said . So he called ahead to the upscale Van Nuys eatery to find a time when he and the woman he had met at Cal State Northridge could enjoy a smoke-free , romantic meal . &quot; They told me Monday , at 3 p.m. , &quot; he recalled , and when the couple arrived , they were seated in the middle of the main room of the restaurant . The host then proceeded to seat smokers in a circle_around Perlmutter and his date . That was the beginning of the war for him . &quot; Something snapped , &quot; he said , recalling how it was the fury he felt from this incident that spurred him to become a nonsmokers ' rights activist . Today , Perlmutter is the associate executive_director of the American Cancer Society San Fernando Valley Unit in Van Nuys , and can look_back over almost 20 years of a war fought against secondhand smoke . His early efforts met with limited success . Right after graduating from college , he wrote and coordinated the first nonsmokers ' rights initiative -- which would have required separate nonsmoking sections in restaurants , supermarkets and health_care facilities . It went nowhere . But although the measure never made_it to the ballot , Perlmutter savored the victory of getting 250 # 000 signatures with a meager budget of $ 2 # 500 . After he realized that he became ill when he was around cigarette smoke , Perlmutter in 1975 joined GASP ( Group Against Smoking Pollution ) , a San Fernando Valley activist organization . As he continued his activism through the American Lung Assn . and later the American Cancer Society , Perlmutter authored and lobbied for a number of anti-secondhand-smoke policies , watching as_many of them were defeated through what he sees as underhanded tactics used by the tobacco_industry . During the final week of the 1980 campaign for Proposition 10 -- which would have required separate non-smoking sections in public places -- Perlmutter watched an anti-Proposition 10 television ad in which a police_officer slapped handcuffs on a smoker at a sports event . Before the ads were aired , the polls showed that the public was in favor of the proposition by 53 % , but ultimately voted against it . &quot; I still feel sickened , &quot; Perlmutter said . &quot; They won by lying to the public. &quot; Perlmutter ' s current battle is focused_on Proposition 188 , which is sponsored by Philip Morris and would overturn the statewide law recently signed by Gov . Pete Wilson banning smoking in most public places . MAKI BECKER</TEXT>
