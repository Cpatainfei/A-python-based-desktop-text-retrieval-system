   <TEXT> Nursing Rats Are a Study in Sensitivity And now , from the &quot; So What Else Is New ? &quot; files of medical research comes a report that nursing mothers have increased sensitivity in the area where their babies suck . The Journal of Neuroscience has announced that mother rats experience heightened sensation on their nipple-studded underbellies . Human mothers who have felt the sometimes excruciating suction of hungry little mouths may_not be surprised . But what may startle even the most sleep-deprived mom is that such stimulation appears to double the size of the area registering touch , pain and temperature . Experts told Science News magazine that the study implies maternal behavior is more complicated than once thought . &quot; A wonderful piece_of_work , &quot; said Thomas R . Insel of the National Institute of Mental Health . &quot; It only underscores the importance of sensory stimulation. &quot; ( And of mothers , we might add. ) Clearing Up Confusion About Donating Organs Millions of Americans specify their wishes to become organ_donors when they register for their driver ' s licenses . Health experts say this well-meaning gesture has not been as successful as it could be because prospective donors don ' t specify their wishes verbally to family members . Although the donor card consent is legally binding , &quot; no organ procurement agency will take organs without the family ' s permission , &quot; said Barbara Meltzer of the Regional Organ Procurement Agency of Southern California . It is not uncommon for family members to deny the donation request if the individual did not expressly stated his or her wishes . Health officials are asking everyone who carries a donor card to also tell someone about their wishes . For information or to receive an organ_donor card , call ROPA of Southern California at ( 800 ) 933-0440 . Preparation May Help Cut Summer-Camp Injuries A little planning and an early medical check-up may prevent a child ' s injury at summer_camp . You should : * Visit the pediatrician a_couple_of months before camp begins . * Inquire about camp activities . The American Academy of Pediatrics says injuries on trampolines can be catastrophic . Diving is also a potentially dangerous sport requiring correct facilities , careful instruction and constant supervision . * Ask the camp director about the availability of medical personnel , location of the nearest hospital , and emergency_procedures and policies . * If a child is going_to camp for a specific sport , obtain information on the instructors and consider a conditioning program for these activities . Of course , all these preparatory motions won ' t preclude a good case of poison_ivy . When Babies Swallow Things They Shouldn ' t Wonder why the piggy_bank is never full ? Babies and preschoolers favor pennies when it comes_to swallowing foreign objects , but a new device enables doctors to retrieve such objects that lodge_in the esophagus . At the University of Pittsburgh , researchers have developed a technique that threads a balloon-tipped catheter through the nose or throat to the object blocking the esophagus . Once the tip is past the blockage , the balloon is inflated and the catheter withdrawn , bringing the object into the mouth where it can be retrieved . The doctors switch to a catheter with a magnet tip to capture other commonly swallowed objects , such_as small disk batteries and ball_bearings . The catheter can ' t be used for sharp objects , such_as pins , which could be pushed into the wall of the esophagus . * This health roundup , compiled by C.A. Wedlan from wire_service reports , appears in Life &amp; Style on Tuesdays .</TEXT>
