   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES : TERM LIMITS FOR THOSE OTHER POLITICIANS ; GOVERNMENT : ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE CIRCUMVENTING PROPS . 140 AND 164 BY RUNNING FOR OTHER OFFICES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rhetoric surrounding Proposition 140 , and later Proposition 164 , presented the measures as simple but drastic solutions to a serious problem . Incumbents had too_much power and were simply being reelected year after year , thus ensuring a continuation of all that was wrong in Sacramento and Washington . Term limits were thought to be the only way to curb the runaway arrogance of career politicians and to make government work again . However , the increasingly apparent hypocrisy of both politicians and voters who support term limits should be disturbing to all . Proposition 140 allows_for no more_than three terms in the state Assembly ( six years ) , and two terms in the state Senate ( eight years ) . Proposition 164 limits congressional terms to four ( eight years ) . At a time when the reelection rate hovers around 98 % , mandated turnover seemed like a good idea to the voters of California . And in Orange County , both measures passed_by a strong majority . Surprisingly enough , many politicians favored the idea . Even politicians who had served many_more years than would be allowed under either proposition . Even those such_as President Bush , Vice_President Dan Quayle and Gov . Pete Wilson , who really have had no other careers outside of politics , endorsed the idea of term limits . Politicians around the state and throughout the country endorsed the idea of term limits . And here in Orange County , virtually all_of the elected officials at the time endorsed Proposition 140 . Fast forward a_few years . State Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) , a public officeholder since 1978 , has announced that she will run_for county supervisor , a seat not subject_to term limits . And Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) , a member of the Assembly since 1984 , has indicated that he , in turn , is interested in running_for Bergeson ' s Senate seat . Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) , a career politician since 1976 and a firm supporter of term limits , is considering a run_for the presidency . If they really do support term limits , if they really don ' t think government is best run_by career politicians , why do they continue to seek public office ? Apparently , what they meant was that career politicians were OK , they just had to keep moving from office to office . Or perhaps what they meant by term limits is to limit someone else ' s term , not their own . The support for term limits comes almost exclusively from Republicans , who just happen to be the legislative minority both in California and in Congress , and who seem to think that term limits are the only way to unseat gainfully elected Democrats . Maybe that ' s what they meant , but that ' s not exactly what they said at the time . But is that what the voters meant ? Must be , because the same voters who voted for Propositions 140 and 164 returned almost every incumbent back to office . And now , there has been a strange silence from those same voters as they watch the career politicians scurry to save their jobs . What did the voters want ? Obviously , here in Orange County they didn ' t really want to reform government and make_it work , since they seem content to keep recycling the same old faces . They , too , must simply have wanted to limit other voter ' s choices , not their own . that ' s the real problem with term limits : They work best only when applied to the other guys , those elected in other districts who do things &quot; we &quot; don ' t like . What seems to have been forgotten in all_the rhetoric is the simple fact that the potential for term limits exists at every election : All the voters need do is vote for someone else . But that means two things . First , they have to vote . Term limits takes_away even the &quot; throw the bums out &quot; incentive to vote . Just wait a_few years and the bums are automatically thrown_out . And second , it means that in highly partisan areas , like Orange County , it would mean voting against the entrenched majority . Apparently for many Republicans , that just isn ' t an option . So term limits for them simply means keeping the same old career politicians around , just in different offices . If voters really want term limits , then they should vote against politicians who have been around too long . If politicians really want term limits , they shouldn ' t keep running_for office . It ' s that simple .</TEXT>
