   <HEADLINE> FOR AMES , A WIFE AND A CROSSROADS IN MEXICO_CITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To a man of broad intellect who is also the son of an intelligence_officer , the world of espionage offered a home that was at once familiar and challenging . But after two decades in increasingly sensitive posts , Aldrich H . Ames faced a personal and professional crisis in the early 1980s as a CIA operative in Mexico_City , where his career seemed to stall and his marriage collapsed . A man both witty and meek , sometimes sociable and at other times withdrawn , Ames began to realize that he was not destined for a senior management job or substantial salary increases . He then met and married Maria del Rosario Casas Ames , a low-level Colombian diplomat recruited to be a paid agent for the CIA -- and also , according to some who knew the couple , a strong-minded woman of expensive tastes . After a tour in Rome , where Ames ' job involved trying to bribe Soviet diplomats into spying for the United States , the Ameses returned to Washington in 1989 and embarked_on a new life -- with a spending spree that was remarkable not only for its size but for the fact that no one at the CIA appeared to notice it . The couple paid $ 540 # 000 cash for a home_in Arlington , Va. , poured $ 99 # 000 into home improvements , bought two condominiums and a farm in Colombia , put $ 25 # 000 cash down on a new Jaguar Sovereign sedan , ran_up nearly $ 5 # 000 a month in credit_card bills and purchased more_than $ 165 # 000 in_stock and securities . The FBI says all this money came from Moscow in return for some of the most sensitive U.S. intelligence secrets , including the names of American agents working in the Soviet_Union . Law_enforcement authorities say Ames turned against his country in 1985 and took more_than $ 1.5 million from the Soviets and , later , the Russians . Through their attorneys , the Ameses steadfastly deny these accusations , and they may be resolved only through a court case . But the detailed presentation of them in court papers by investigators who eavesdropped on the couple and tailed them for more_than a year has stirred urgent questions throughout the intelligence community and official Washington . Why would a lifelong CIA official sell_out his country for what former agency Director William E . Colby called &quot; a_few shekels of silver ? &quot; How could such a person on the front_lines of the Cold_War rationalize treason ? Those who know Ames and those who have studied such cases cite a combination of possible factors : greed and a shattered ego . CIA associates describe Ames as extremely bright and capable , despite apparent blunders that led to his arrest . Yet in Mexico_City , his career was not advancing while those who were his junior were moving_up to bigger titles and larger salaries . Those who knew him then speculate that he could have felt stymied in his career by lesser minds who were better bureaucratic game-players . &quot; Rick was in crisis , and everybody seemed to know it , &quot; said one American who worked with him in Mexico_City . &quot; He felt pushed from one side and pulled from another. &quot; A CIA psychologist said that Ames could have turned against his agency , and his country , out of the frustrated ambition that has driven many others to treason . &quot; In looking_at a number of major traitors in history , it was frequently a case that there had been a major career setback , a sense of having been betrayed by their own government , which did not recognize their own ability , &quot; he said . &quot; The person then went_on to rationalize the act quite consciously as vengeance or revenge. &quot; The psychologist , who has profiled many of the prominent spies of recent decades , said that they commonly suffered professional and personal crises simultaneously and decided to take action to regain a sense of self-worth . He cited the Walkers , an American family that sold top-secret U.S. military codes to the Soviets in the 1980s , and the Soviet turncoat Oleg Penkovsky , who spied for the United States after having been denied a promotion in the Soviet intelligence service . &quot; On the surface , these cases look_like simple venality , &quot; the psychologist said . &quot; But in the heads of these individuals is the satisfaction of being a little man putting something over on the system . These are people with dreams of glory trying to restore a sense of efficacy and personal importance. &quot; Those who know him describe Ames as a man with an unexpected mix of qualities . His neighbors knew him as someone who was always able to fill_in the answer to the crossword_puzzle that stumped them . One of his Arlington neighbors , William Rhoads , a retired foreign service officer , suspected that Ames might work for a spy agency because his manner seemed too humble for a foreign service officer . &quot; He just didn ' t have the pomposity you see so often. &quot; A doting father , Ames would brave an ice_storm to buy a toy for his 5-year-old son , Paul . Although his friends in Arlington knew him only casually , he also had a convivial side : Friends from government service said that he could party for many hours and liked to have a_few drinks . If Ames had strong political views , he didn ' t share them widely . Although he contributed $ 5 # 000 to the Democratic National Committee in 1991 and 1992 , his Arlington neighbors and some Americans who knew him here and abroad said that they knew_nothing about his politics . If he harbored any resentments toward the U.S._government , he never voiced them . &quot; He wasn ' t like some unhappy postal employee , ready to blow_up , &quot; said an American who knew him in Mexico . &quot; He didn ' t whine , he didn ' t complain , he didn ' t cry about how they were treating him. &quot; But for all his broad knowledge , his superiors seemed to find something lacking in his job performance . After 32 years in the CIA , Ames at the time of his arrest was earning about $ 70 # 000 a year and had a service grade so low that it surprised some former colleagues when they learned of it in news accounts this week . The portrait of Ames in the FBI ' s accusatory affidavit also indicated a feckless side , surprising in a man who held the pivotal job of head of Soviet counterintelligence in the mid-1980s . The FBI papers suggest that Ames risked capture by leaving incriminating documents at his CIA office and his home , showed_off his wealth in a way that was likely to attract attention and couldn ' t even message his Russian contacts without numerous misspellings . Even his purported allies in Russia were scornful of his allegedly reckless and free-spending ways . &quot; Of course , we should not recruit such idiots who do not know how to live , &quot; Mikhail N . Portoranin , an adviser to Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , said scornfully this week . Relatively little is known of Ames ' earliest years except that he and his two sisters lived the life of CIA &quot; brats &quot; -- trailing their father , Carleton , to several agency postings overseas before settling in the Virginia suburbs of Washington in 1951 , when the younger Ames was 10 . Ames ' mother , Rachel Aldrich Ames , taught in the Fairfax County public_schools until retiring in 1969 and moving to North Carolina . Ames ' father died in retirement in 1972 . His mother collapsed and died at Ames ' house in Falls Church , Va. , in 1986 while visiting her son . The 1959 McLean High_School yearbook pictures a nerdy , bespectacled &quot; Ricky &quot; Ames hamming it up with Polly Morris as the senior_class ' s &quot; wittiest &quot; students . He was_active in the thespian society , served on the yearbook staff , sang in the a cappella choir and sat on the student council cabinet . He was a National Merit Scholarship semi-finalist . Senior_class president Corbin Thompson , now a pipe_fitter in semi-rural Nokesville , Va. , said that he remembers Ames as an exceptional student and &quot; fun to be around. &quot; He said he had no idea that Ames had chosen intelligence as a career . &quot; I thought he ' d go_into theatrics or be an English_teacher or something. &quot; Thompson said he wasn ' t aware until a reporter called him Friday that the Aldrich H . Ames arrested this week as a suspected spy was the Ricky Ames he ' d watched in school plays . &quot; You mean that ' s the same guy ? I had no idea. &quot; Although the yearbook indicates that Ames intended to attend Dartmouth College in the fall of 1959 , the school has no record of his enrolling there . The next three years are unaccounted for in official accounts , perhaps reflecting Ames ' military_service or initial CIA training . He joined the agency on June 17 , 1962 , then spent tours in Washington , Turkey and New York before landing in Mexico_City between 1981 and 1983 . That tour was a prestigious location for someone in his work , because big Russian and Cuban embassies had long made the city a seat of espionage activity in Latin_America . He developed a close-knit group of friends among the 500 or so Americans who worked_at the embassy , and his friends knew him to be in pain . His peers in the service were moving ahead , but Ames was struggling to win similar respect from his bosses . &quot; If you don ' t move ahead , you ' d be ' selected out , ' as they put it , &quot; one friend said . &quot; that ' s what everybody worried about. &quot; And his first marriage was coming unraveled , leaving Ames deeply troubled behind a usually cheerful demeanor , friends said . The divorce in August , 1985 , gave Ames ' first wife the couple ' s home and alimony , according to one former CIA official . It was at one of the embassy ' s many diplomatic cocktail soirees in the Mexican_capital that Ames met the young , raven-haired Maria del Rosario Casas Dupuy , a cultural_attache in the Colombian Embassy and the daughter of a prominent Colombian politician and businessman . She was born_on Dec . 19 , 1952 , in Bogota and entered the humanities college of the prestigious University of the Andes in 1969 . She studied philosophy and arts , concentrating_on ancient Greece , and rubbed elbows with people who became Colombia ' s political and social elite , including Ana Milena Munoz , now the wife of President Cesar Gaviria . Despite his struggles with his career , Ames returned to Washington and was inexplicably promoted to the prestigious post of head of Soviet counterintelligence . He and his wife then spent three years in Rome , where he was charged with &quot; turning &quot; Soviet Embassy personnel , before returning to Washington in the late summer of 1989 . In January , 1991 , Ames and his wife began depositing large amounts of cash_in checking , savings and brokerage_accounts in the Washington area , according to the FBI affidavit . The affidavit also says the couple began a pattern of unauthorized contacts with Russian officials in which they used a northwest Washington mailbox to signal his Russian handlers , and a site he called &quot; the pipe &quot; for receiving bundles of cash . The Ames ' nanny told reporters this week of the furtive life she had witnessed at the Ames ' three-story house . She told of how she was barred from entering certain parts of the house and ordered to take the couple ' s son away from the house for periods of many hours . By early 1993 , the couple was under constant surveillance from TV cameras , FBI tails and even electronic monitors on their home telephone and computer , where FBI documents say they kept detailed records of their espionage business . As the months wore_on , according to the FBI documents , the couple ' s anxiety level apparently rose . FBI_agents say they listened_in on a call last October in which a panicked Rosario Ames grilled her husband about a signal he was supposed to leave on a mailbox to indicate to his Russian masters that he was prepared to meet a Russian agent in Bogota to exchange information . According to a transcript of the intercepted conversation , Mrs . Ames asked , &quot; Why didn ' t you do_it today , for God ' s sakes ? &quot; Her husband replied , &quot; I should have , except it was raining like crazy. &quot; Then they reportedly bickered about when he was supposed to lay_down the signal to the Russians , with Ames reassuring her that he still had time to pass the message . &quot; Well , honey , &quot; Mrs . Ames said , &quot; I hope you didn ' t screw up. &quot; Times staff writers Elizabeth Shogren , Ray Delgado , Robin Wright , Doyle McManus and Ronald J . Ostrow in Washington , special correspondent Steven Ambrus in Bogota and researcher Audrey Britton in New York contributed to this story .</TEXT>
