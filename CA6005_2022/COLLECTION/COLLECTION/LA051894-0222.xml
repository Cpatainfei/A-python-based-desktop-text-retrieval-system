   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; WHICH DISK WILL SLIP ? ; FIRMS FACE OFF OVER COMPUTER DATA STORAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the Irvine Spectrum Business Park , Pinnacle Micro Inc. ' s two-story building looks_up_to Western Digital Corp. ' s 14-story headquarters much the way David must have looked_up at mighty Goliath . Barely a stone ' s throw apart in Irvine , these computer data storage companies have lived_in peaceful coexistence for years , because a technological wall separated their industries . But with the advent of multimedia technology -- enabling computers to combine sound , text , graphics and video -- the neighbors may soon become adversaries . Pinnacle , a maker of optical storage_devices , senses an opportunity and is readying its slingshot . Western Digital , a leading maker of magnetic_disk drives with $ 1.2 billion in annual sales , insists it isn ' t worried it will suffer Goliath ' s fate . Each company ' s products perform the same basic function : storing computer data . Whichever can do that better at the best price will have a future ; the other may be left spinning in the dustbin of history . &quot; Our belief is that optical disks will be around 30 years from now and magnetic won ' t exist , &quot; said Scott Blum , who co-founded Pinnacle Micro Inc. with his father , Bill , in 1987 and now serves as executive_vice_president . &quot; This is what we ' ve worked_on for seven years. &quot; Companies such_as Western Digital beg to differ . At stake is a share of the multibillion-dollar personal_computer data storage industry , where demand is expected to explode in the future as companies vie to electronically supply entertainment and information to businesses and homes . Not every computer user cares who survives this battle , but it matters_to tens of thousands of workers -- from engineers to assemblers -- who make their living in the PC storage industry , which so far has remained largely American-owned despite efforts by foreigners to grab a foothold . Until now , magnetic has been king . The $ 700-million optical disk_drive industry is puny next to the $ 8.3 billion spent on magnetic hard_drives each year , based on estimates by market researchers Disk / Trend Inc. in Mountain View , Calif. , and Freeman Associates Inc. in Santa Barbara . The magnetic_disk drive industry mushrooms to $ 23.6 billion when sales of stand-alone drives are included . It will be difficult to mount a serious challenge to the magnetic_disk drive manufacturers , which grew on the enormous success of the personal_computer . The disk_drive serves as the permanent memory system for the PC . But Pinnacle ' s executives believe business and home users will eventually favor their type of storage system , which is expected to undergo a major enhancement next year . Pinnacle is set to release its enhancement project , code-named Diablo , next spring . For the first time , he said , an optical disk_drive will cost less than similar high-capacity magnetic_disk drives . The magnetic hard_drive makers scoff . &quot; The epitaph of the disk_drive industry was written in the mid-1980s when optical first appeared , &quot; said Peter Knight , vice_president of business development at Conner Peripherals Inc. in San Jose , a top disk_drive maker . &quot; Many theorists stood_up and talked_about how the fundamental limit of the disk_drive was coming . I thought optical would be a serious challenger . As time goes_on , it ' s clear that isn ' t the case. &quot; &quot; We don ' t have tunnel vision , &quot; said Gary Marks , vice_president of marketing at Western Digital . &quot; There will be peaceful coexistence between hard_disks and optical for a long time. &quot; * Marks ' view is shared by industry experts such_as Bob Katzive , a vice_president at Disk / Trend , and Phil Devin , storage analyst for Dataquest Inc. , a market researcher in San Jose . &quot; We don ' t see optical drives as a replacement for the magnetic hard_disk , &quot; Katzive said . &quot; They ' re good for storing things as archives . But if you need to ( change ) it fast , the hard_disk drive is better. &quot; Optical drives use a laser to read bumps and grooves on a metal platter , much like a compact_disc player . In magnetic_disks , a mechanical head reads the magnetic pattern on the metal disk . In both , the disks spin past a head , which reads the data or changes it based on commands from the computer ' s main processor . This ability to alter , or &quot; write &quot; on , the disk quickly is key to a disk_drive system , but for optical drives , it is still too slow and expensive -- which puts their manufacturers at a disadvantage . But Bill Blum , 59 , stresses that &quot; rewriteable &quot; optical technology -- which allows data to be repeatedly recorded and erased -- has been_on the market for only four years , compared to more_than a decade for magnetic . &quot; We can put more information per square_inch than them , and we just started , &quot; Scott Blum said . &quot; They ' re pushing the limits . We ' re just beginning to make advances. &quot; It is next to impossible to forecast the best technology for the future based on those that prevail today , said Bob Abraham , vice_president of Freeman Associates . &quot; No one really knows where the physical limits are , &quot; Abraham said . Technological advance is a game of numbers . If Pinnacle improves its optical technology faster than competing magnetic_disk drive companies , it will gain_ground in sales . Speed , capacity and price matter most . Analysts , however , say that optical technology is behind on every front . Pinnacle had about $ 39 million in sales last year . With barely 100 employees , it competes against Japanese rivals such_as Sony , Panasonic and Olympus . Its principal customers are businesses that have huge archives , especially defense companies . The next step for Pinnacle is to overcome the challenges optical drive makers face , which include developing better lasers that can read data squeezed into ever tighter spaces on a disk . It must build its drives_in smaller packages to match the size standard of magnetic_disk drives . It must also improve its write speeds , or the time it takes_to record data , several times over to catch_up_with magnetic drives . Much of this advancement depends_on how quickly new laser heads are developed , and Pinnacle is dependent_on the Japanese companies that manufacture them . Considering the obstacles , some optical players have simply decided not to directly challenge their magnetic hard_disk rivals . * Western Digital , for instance , has doubled the capacity of its hard_disk drives every 16 months . Marc Nussbaum , vice_president of engineering for Western Digital , says there is no foreseeable &quot; brick wall &quot; to such advances . In fact , a new technology expected to be_on the market in 1995 -- magnetic resistive heads -- will virtually quadruple capacity on magnetic_disk drives . And last year Western Digital established a new standard for magnetic hard_disk drives -- dubbed the enhanced intelligent drive interface -- to accommodate ever higher storage levels . While typical drives today store a maximum of 528 megabytes -- about 264 # 000 typewritten pages -- future drives could hold 10 times as much , thanks in part to the new technology standard , Nussbaum said . The unanswered question is when will magnetic drive makers max out their ability to stretch capacity . &quot; Sooner or later there will be a limit for magnetic , &quot; said Peter Rentzepis , a chemistry professor at UC Irvine who is working_on an $ 18-million project to develop an optical drive of the future . &quot; The only way to overcome it is with optical . How soon ? I cannot say. &quot; HOW OPTICAL DRIVE WORKS These drives incorporate a laser and are used for storing large volumes of data . The laser ' s narrow beam can write more data in less space than the magnetic drive . Writing data 1 . Laser heats a spot ; alloy layer crystallizes into loose particles . 2 . Write head passes_over the revolving disk , creating a magnetic_field that aligns the crystal particles according to positive or negative polarities , representing the binary language of computers , which is based on a system of zeros and ones . Reading data 1 . A second , weaker laser reflects off of aluminum surface . As beam passes_through alloy , crystallized particles polarize the light . 2 . Sensor receives polarized light and reads its binary_code . HOW MAGNETIC DRIVE WORKS Magnetic drives are standard in desktops , but are also used in supercomputers . Writing data 1 . Read / write head passes_over revolving disk . 2 . While passing under read / write head , particles are organized into magnetic bands according to their positive and negative polarities . Reading data 1 . Iron particles create a magnetic_field , generating a current through the coil . 2 . Computer &quot; reads &quot; direction of current and interprets its binary_code .
