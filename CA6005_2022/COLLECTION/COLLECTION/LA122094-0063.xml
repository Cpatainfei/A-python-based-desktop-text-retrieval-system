   <TEXT> A month ago , a bloody showdown between Palestinian police and Islamic militants threatened to plunge the Gaza Strip into civil_war . Now the soothing slap of brushes painting over factional graffiti has replaced the crack of gunfire in the streets . The whitewashed slogans are the first tangible results of an intense , ongoing mediation effort launched by Israeli Arabs just hours after the Nov . 18 clash erupted outside a Gaza mosque . Led by an unlikely pair -- a secular gynecologist from Jerusalem and a leader of the Islamic movement inside Israel -- Israeli Arabs stepped_to_the_fore as mediators between Yasser Arafat ' s Palestinian Authority and his most powerful opposition , the militant Islamic movement Hamas . Initially , each side welcomed their intervention , Israeli Arabs claimed , because they were not members of any faction represented in the West_Bank and Gaza but had familial and political ties there that only Palestinians could have . &quot; It was only natural , &quot; said Dr. Ahmed Tibi , the Jerusalem gynecologist who serves as spokesman for the mediation efforts . Tibi and other mediators say their efforts helped defuse an explosive situation in Gaza -- at least 14 people were killed and 129 injured during the Nov . 18 confrontation -- and laid the groundwork for reconciliation between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas . But now they find that both Palestinians and Israelis view their efforts with suspicion . Israeli officials have publicly questioned the loyalties of Israeli Arabs . Palestinians in the territories are accusing them of taking sides in the political tug-of-war between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority , the nascent government established to administer the Jericho and Gaza areas after Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed their historic peace accord in September , 1993 . &quot; In general , the connection between Arab citizens of Israel should be welcomed , when it is in_relation_to economic development of the territories and of Israel , &quot; said Shimon Shetreet , Israel ' s minister of economics and planning . &quot; But when it is in the political area , when Israeli Arabs get involved in the conflicts between the Palestinian groups , it is not welcomed by the Israeli government. &quot; There are 900 # 000 Israeli Arabs , many of whom prefer to call themselves Palestinians who hold Israeli citizenship . They live inside Israel ' s pre-1967 borders , and vote_in its elections . But their status has always been ambiguous . They are exempted from the mandatory army duty required of all other Israelis . Their connections with other Palestinians have been regarded_as a potential security risk by successive Israeli governments . Now Israeli Arabs say they are finding that the Palestinian factions they are dealing with in Gaza are uneasy with the mediators ' Israeli citizenship and skeptical of their neutrality in intra-Palestinian conflicts . &quot; It is difficult because , even if one side presents a solution that you feel is logical , the other side will point a finger and accuse you of being partial , &quot; said Taleb a-Sanaa , an Israeli Arab who is a member of the Knesset , Israel ' s Parliament . &quot; It is very easy to be dragged into factional politics. &quot; Successful mediation efforts in Gaza may pay_off for Israeli Arab leaders with their constituents in the next elections , but the intervention is exacting an immediate price . &quot; Israel always wanted us to be a bridge for peace , a bridge to the other Palestinians and the other Arabs , &quot; said Hashem Mahmeed , a Knesset member with the pro-Communist Democratic Front for Peace and Equality . &quot; Now that we are trying to be that bridge , they say that we shouldn ' t . Well , we are not asking_for anyone ' s permission. &quot; At a recent Israeli Cabinet meeting , security officials warned that the mediation efforts by Israeli Arabs in Gaza could pose a security risk for Israel . Leaks of the warning infuriated Israeli Arabs . &quot; It was an irresponsible and shallow thing to say , &quot; Mahmeed said . &quot; It is not so_much the mediation effort per se that worries people , &quot; explained a senior Israeli security official , speaking on condition of anonymity . &quot; It is the much , much larger picture of what is happening to Israeli Arabs , now that the sulta ( Palestinian Authority ) is operating. &quot; If their mediating efforts manage to serve as a unifying force among the always-fractious Israeli Arab politicians , the security official said , they could decide to form a single party and run_on one ticket for the next parliamentary elections . If all_of Israel ' s Arabs voted for one Arab party , it could capture as_many as 14 seats in the 120-seat Knesset . That would be a big enough bloc to affect coalition building and decide crucial votes . Currently , there are only seven Israeli Arab Knesset members . Two ran_on Jewish Zionist party lists . No Israeli prime_minister has ever included an Arab party in his or her governing coalition . But some Israeli Arabs say openly that they believe a larger Arab presence in the Knesset will help the Palestinian entity now being born in Gaza and the West_Bank . &quot; Arafat is interested in having a large Arab representation in the Knesset that would have an effect in the Palestinian arena as well , &quot; said Ibrahim Sarsour , a member of the local council in Kfar Kassem , an Israeli Arab village . Sarsour is a member of the Islamic movement inside Israel . &quot; Just as the Jews are interested in having as large a number of Jews as possible in both houses of ( the U.S. ) Congress , we are interested in having a large_number of Arabs in the Knesset , &quot; Sarsour said . The Islamic movement is a growing force within the Israeli Arab political_arena . Islamists decided to run_for municipal councils and are now influential in several key Arab cities . But the movement has yet to sanction the participation of Islamic candidates in national elections . Tibi , the physician-mediator , is openly toying_with the notion of joining forces with Sheik Abdallah Nimr Darwish , a cleric with contacts to Hamas leaders , and running in the next parliamentary elections . He seems to enjoy the controversy stirred inside Israel by both his mediating efforts and his potential candidacy . &quot; We are not the usual Israeli citizens , &quot; said Tibi , brushing_off criticism from those Israelis who say he and the other mediators too closely identify with the Palestinians of the West_Bank and Gaza . &quot; We are different . I do not use the term ' Israeli Arab. ' I am a Palestinian who holds Israeli citizenship . Before any other label , I am a Palestinian. &quot; Fluent in Hebrew as well as Arabic and English , he served as a go-between for Arafat with Israeli officials and as a public spokesman for Arafat inside Israel years before Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin ' s government decided to recognize the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people . On Nov . 18 , the day of the Gaza shootings , Arafat called_on Tibi to act_as a mediator shortly after rioting erupted outside Gaza ' s main mosque . There were running gun battles between Arafat ' s police and Islamic militants in the streets of Gaza . Casualties were mounting , and Hamas leaders were warning that the Palestinian Authority was flirting_with civil_war . &quot; Everything could have blown_up in our faces , &quot; Tibi recalled . &quot; The tension was increasing , and it was a very dangerous situation. &quot; Tibi asked Darwish to come_with him to Gaza and negotiate an immediate cease-fire . Darwish agreed . &quot; We called_for an emergency meeting in President Arafat ' s office , &quot; Darwish recalled in a telephone_interview . &quot; We sat until 3:30 a.m. &quot; The meeting produced a temporary cease-fire and an agreement that funerals would proceed peacefully on Saturday , the day after the clash . It became known as the Darwish-Tibi agreement and served as the basis for ongoing negotiations between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority . Their joint intervention earned Tibi and Darwish the mocking title of &quot; the yuppie and the priest &quot; from Israeli Arab politicians alarmed by the clout a potential political partnership between the two could have with Israeli Arab voters in the next elections . A recent survey by an Israeli polling organization said , if the two were to form a political_party , it could garner as_many as four Knesset seats in the next election . The only current all-Arab party , the Arab Democracy Party , now holds two seats . The next big test for Tibi and Darwish will be whether they can expand the temporary cease-fire between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority into a broader political agreement . Hamas leader Mahmoud Zahhar recently complained that the mediation efforts have flagged and that little of substance has been achieved . Their continuation appeared shaky . The fundamental differences between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas remain , and it is hard to see how Tibi and Darwish will bridge them . Hamas remains violently opposed to the accords that led to the peace agreement and established the Palestinian self-governing authority . The militants are committed to torpedoing the agreement by whatever means are necessary . But Tibi said he is still optimistic about the negotiations . Talks will resume before the end of the month , he said . &quot; We will organize an agenda to discuss all_the disagreements , to discuss how to run this entity , even when there are disagreements , &quot; Tibi said . &quot; Ultimately , Hamas can participate in the system functionally . It is only natural. &quot;</TEXT>
