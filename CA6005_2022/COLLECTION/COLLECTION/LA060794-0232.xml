   <HEADLINE> FOR WORLD CUP ENTREPRENEUR , A BANNER YEAR ; ADVERTISING : SIGN MAKER GOLD GRAPHICS REBUILDS ITS QUAKE-JOLTED BUSINESS IN TIME TO PUBLICIZE THE INTERNATIONAL SOCCER EXTRAVAGANZA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Al Gold ' s sign business is getting only a small piece of the economic bounty that Southern California is expected to collect from the World Cup . But that piece may have kept his business alive . Gold Graphics Manufacturing Co . in Pacoima produces &quot; point-of-purchase &quot; advertising for everything from gas_stations to banks . Late last year , his firm won a contract to supply promotional banners for the soccer extravaganza . By the time the first game kicks_off June 17 , about 50 # 000 will festoon light poles in the nine host cities , including Los Angeles . Gold ' s revenue from the World Cup deal could pass $ 2 million . Gold had hardly started work_on the project when the Northridge earthquake decimated his leased factory , and his equipment damage was not covered by insurance . The future of the company he founded in 1951 was at stake . Should he wait for federal emergency funds , and risk losing customers in the meantime , or do whatever it took_to keep the assembly_line going ? He took the second step and leased new quarters a block away -- and financed the move_out of cash flow_from the World Cup banners . Gold ' s potential $ 2-million project is only a fraction of the estimated $ 310 million that the World Cup is expected to generate for the greater Los Angeles economy . But , Gold said , &quot; it was a lifeline for us. &quot; Not only was the company able to recover from the quake , but Gold ' s regular business kept growing , and with the World Cup project he now expects record sales this year . And Gold , 66 , is also hoping that the World Cup connection will go_on to raise the profile of his family_business , which employs two nephews , a son-in-law and a stepson . Consumers tend to notice the message of a point-of-purchase display in their local store , but not the display itself . At a supermarket there might be a big cardboard advertisement standing next to a stack of Coke cans . &quot; Nobody notices the display , but they do notice the 99 Coca-Cola six-pack , &quot; Gold said . The World Cup project is a lot easier for Gold to explain to outsiders . &quot; Nobody really knew what I did for a living , &quot; Gold said . &quot; They thought I was a flag manufacturer for car lots . It ' s a subliminal company. &quot; The industry itself is somewhat subliminal -- indeed , point-of-purchase is sometimes referred to as &quot; below-the-line &quot; advertising . Some call it the last three feet of the sale , a reference_to the distance from the display shelf to the customer ' s hand . Despite its low profile , point-of-purchase is big business in the United States -- worth $ 15.7 billion in 1992 , according to the Point-of-Purchase Advertising Institute in Englewood , N.J. Some firms offer specific services , such_as design or printing , while others , like Gold Graphics , offer full service from planning to installation . Gold , an avuncular New York native whose office is decorated with his collection of antique cameras , made his first signs at_home and sold them out of his car . His first customer , an auto-polish firm , bought $ 800 worth . &quot; That put me in the black , and I ' ve been there ever since , &quot; he said . * After renting a $ 90-a-month store on Venice Boulevard , he persuaded his identical_twin brother , Don , then a lingerie salesman , to join the business . They still share ownership of the company , and Don serves as president . Their business grew thanks to the big oil_companies , including Chevron and Unocal , that used Gold Graphics to promote their products at gas_stations . At one time , the company , which moved to the San Fernando Valley in 1961 , had branch offices in New York and Houston . Then came the energy crisis of the early 1970s , which prompted diversification . &quot; I realized we were vulnerable by being so heavily concentrated in one industry , &quot; Gold said . The firm found new customers in automobiles , supermarkets , retail , electronics and financial services . Sports events weren ' t part of the plan . But when the Olympics came_to Los Angeles in 1984 , the designers of the Games ' visual packaging -- many of whom had worked with Gold Graphics on corporate promotions -- called_on Gold ' s expertise . The firm eventually got half the contracts for banners and signs at Olympic venues . &quot; I was kind of burned out &quot; from the sign business , Gold said . &quot; But the ' 84 Olympics rejuvenated me. &quot; Gold followed_up_on the Games ' success , for example installing banners on city light poles for the last two Super Bowls , in Pasadena and Atlanta , and for cultural events at the Music Center and Hollywood Bowl . And rather than rely_on cities to foot the bill , he persuaded corporations to pay from $ 150 to $ 250 a pole to sponsor banners celebrating the event . Customers attribute much of Gold ' s success to customer service . &quot; He has a saying , ' The urgent , you do today , the impossible , you did yesterday , ' &quot; said Cindy Hearn , Unocal ' s advertising manager in Brea . &quot; We can always depend_on him. &quot; In 1993 , Gold , who employs 135 people ranging from computer_graphics designers to screen printers , had record sales . To cap the year , he got the World Cup contract . Gold approached World Cup USA 1994 Chairman Alan Rothenberg with the concept of having sponsors for light pole banners . &quot; He thought it was a great idea. &quot; It was the company ' s largest project to date . Gold put his nephew Andy , 29 , in_charge of coordinating the project . And it couldn ' t have come at a better time . that ' s because the Northridge quake left Gold ' s 50 # 000-square-foot factory a shambles , the ceiling caved_in , banners strewn over the floor and machinery broken . He estimates the damage at $ 1.5 million , including lost equipment and inventory . The federal Small Business Administration agreed to provide an emergency loan of $ 1.3 million , but Gold could not wait around for the money to come_in . Within days , he moved operations to a building that the Adray ' s discount electronics chain had recently used as a warehouse . &quot; We didn ' t have anywhere else to go. &quot; The building needed extensive refurbishing , $ 300 # 000 alone for a new electrical_system . But Gold ' s staff filled orders , improvising when necessary -- they used electric_fans to dry banners when there was no gas to fuel drying ovens -- and the World Cup cash started rolling in . Each city light pole for the World Cup can carry four three-by-eight-foot reinforced plastic banners , featuring the sponsor ' s name below a soccer player graphic . Gold would not disclose the exact value of the Cup deal , but sponsors , including such companies as Coca-Cola Co. , M &amp; M-Mars Inc. and MasterCard , are paying around $ 200 a pole . If , as he expects , banners for 12 # 500 poles are sold , that would yield_up to $ 2.5 million in revenues for Gold Graphics . Both World Cup organizers and sponsors said the earthquake hardly appeared to affect Gold ' s production . &quot; We were very impressed with the speed with which they were able to get_back up and running , &quot; said Frank Cardenas , director of governmental affairs for World Cup USA 1994 . &quot; They were very quick to assure us that from their end of the operation , it would be seamless , &quot; said David Casey , events marketing manager for Coca-Cola in Los Angeles . &quot; That was very comforting for us. &quot; As Gold prepared to install the World Cup banners , he faced another hurdle : Would the city of Los Angeles charge its standard permit fee of $ 46 a pole ? For Los Angeles , the fees could have raised_up to $ 184 # 000 . But for Gold , they raised the prospect of sponsors cutting_back on the banner program to save money . None of the other host cities are charging permit fees . After intensive lobbying , the City_Council voted May 18 to waive the fees . Once the World Cup is over , he will be at_work producing banners for other sporting events , including the 1995 Super Bowl in Miami and the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta . And while he ultimately plans to hand_over the company to the younger family members , he has no plans to retire soon . Added his nephew Andy : &quot; All the activity that ' s been going_on lately has kind of juiced him up. &quot;</TEXT>
