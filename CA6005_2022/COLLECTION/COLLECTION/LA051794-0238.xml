   <HEADLINE> GETTING MULTIMEDIA UP AND RUNNING ; TECHNOLOGY : A SMALL HUNTINGTON BEACH FIRM HAS LAUNCHED A SOFTWARE PROGRAM THAT ANALYZES WHAT ' S WRONG WITH A SYSTEM AND OFFERS REMEDIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Norm Jacobson has met the dark side of multimedia , the gear that allows personal_computers to play movie-like videos , animation and compact-disk quality sound . It took him three hours to install a component to make his PC do those whiz-bang things . And Jacobson is a pro . He teaches computer classes at UC Irvine and has more_than 10 years of experience getting the various parts of computers to work together . Jacobson is one of many frustrated consumers drawn to multimedia by slick advertising only to encounter misery when things don ' t work right . &quot; Everybody is touting how great multimedia is , &quot; Jacobson said . &quot; But getting_it to work can be a real problem . The average person out there needs some help. &quot; He hopes that a new product from TouchStone Software Corp . will help . Last month , the small Huntington Beach company started selling Setup Advisor , a computer_program that analyzes what ' s wrong with a multimedia_system , as well as other computer woes , and gives advice on how to fix it . Setup Advisor , for instance , shows whether a particular PC is compatible with certain multimedia accessories . TouchStone figures its new product will help thousands of everyday computer users who try to save money by following highly touted &quot; easy to install &quot; instructions and wind_up instead with multimedia_systems that don ' t work properly . Consumers are buying the $ 29.95 program , and TouchStone hopes to sell_up to 20 # 000 copies a month . But the program isn ' t so popular_with multimedia kit manufacturers , who say their sets of hardware and software aren ' t hard to install . Therein lies TouchStone ' s struggle . The feisty 30-employee firm finds its markets in the educational gaps that big companies leave between themselves and their hapless customers . &quot; I don ' t want to create trouble for the manufacturers , but when you create diagnostic software , you ' re looking_to find problems in products and to solve them , &quot; said C . Shannon Jenkins , TouchStone ' s chief_executive . &quot; We ' re helping the people on the front_lines -- the customers and the stores. &quot; * Ayear ago , tiny TouchStone found itself in a similar battle . It launched a program to help befuddled consumers , but it caught flak from officials at software giant Microsoft Corp. , maker of MS-DOS 6.0 , the basic operating software that makes PCs run . Jenkins , along with other software industry followers , said Microsoft ' s product was seriously flawed . Microsoft officials said that TouchStone ' s criticism amounted to a ploy to market TouchStone ' s utility software . But the software giant subsequently revised the program to address user complaints . Tapping into new frustration , TouchStone says it expects robust sales of Setup Advisor . The Fry ' s Electronics store in Fountain Valley sold 45 copies of Setup Advisor in its first weekend on the shelves . Jenkins believes the market for TouchStone ' s software could be big because of the twin tides of frustration and fascination with multimedia . Last year , worldwide sales of CD-ROM_drives -- an essential component in multimedia -- soared 155 % over the previous year as millions of consumers bought the devices to play the video and sound stored on computer compact_disks , according to InfoTech , a market research firm in Woodstock , Vt . Multimedia kits typically include the CD-ROM_drives , sound cards and speakers . But as sales of multimedia kits grow , consumers are discovering that it ' s hard to take_apart a computer with a screwdriver , install the equipment , and then load the software that makes_it work . Installation gets more difficult as more components are added , said John Hulina , a multimedia product buyer for computer distributor Ingram Micro Inc. in Santa Ana . Setup Advisor is aimed at_easing the frustration and giving the consumer more time to enjoy the fascination . The program also should help boost the company ' s earnings . TouchStone said Monday that it earned $ 74 # 500 , or 1 cent a share , for the first_quarter , slightly below the $ 75 # 000 earned in last year ' s first_quarter . Quarterly revenue grew 8 % to $ 1.3 million from $ 1.2 million last year . Despite Setup Advisor ' s selling points , TouchStone ' s first_step in marketing the program has been to draw attention to the volume of returned multimedia merchandise as evidence that people are abandoning multimedia in frustration . The tactic has sparked criticism from multimedia manufacturers . &quot; To the degree that TouchStone doesn ' t distinguish between good multimedia kits and bad ones and lumps us all together , I ' m not thrilled about that , &quot; said Greg Reznick , vice_president of marketing at MediaVision Technology Inc. in Fremont , one of the largest makers of multimedia kits . &quot; PCs are complicated . But there are companies that do a good job of explaining how to use them or expand them , &quot; he said . &quot; We think we do. &quot; * Reznick said his company ' s kits come_with programs that can detect and solve problems as well as TouchStone ' s program can . But Jenkins points_out that consumers must buy the $ 300 to $ 400 kit from MediaVision to use the software that detects potential problems . The industry ' s other multimedia powerhouse , Creative Labs Inc. in Milpitas , also bristles_at the notion that multimedia kits are so difficult to install that they ' re being returned in droves . &quot; There is a common misconception in the industry about the rate of return of our products , &quot; said Richard Buchanan , a product marketing director for Creative Labs . Buchanan said Creative Labs welcomes any programs such_as TouchStone ' s that can help simplify the complicated installation process . But he disagreed that return rates are skyrocketing . Buchanan said that of the 60 # 000 sound cards that Creative Labs ships every month , less than 1 % are returned . &quot; Just opening the computer is intimidating , sort of like changing the oil in your car , &quot; Buchanan said . &quot; It ' s not easy to install things . But from our perspective , the difficulty is dramatically overblown. &quot; But Norm Jacobson , the UCI computer teacher who spent three hours installing his multimedia kit , thinks TouchStone ' s new software is useful for heading_off problems . &quot; If the vendors say there is no problem , that ' s a bunch of hooey , &quot; he said . &quot; Third-party dealers who sell the computers don ' t do installations well . If you call the manufacturer to get help , you have a hard_time getting_through or you hear some jargon you don ' t understand. &quot; Ed Bradford , an Anaheim retiree , said he spent several days over the course of a month trying to install his $ 200 CD-ROM_drive . Whatever he tried , including calls to the manufacturer , didn ' t work . Finally , he got help from friends at the North Orange County Computer Club . Now Bradford gets a big kick_out of a music composition CD-ROM program in which he enters musical_notes and his computer plays them back as if it were a piano . &quot; I find that the majority of people just want to find some computer-literate person and have them install their equipment for them , &quot; said Dain Leese , a Costa Mesa software consultant who volunteers for the North Orange County Computer Club . Such complaints may be why consumers are buying utility software . Without much competition from other software companies for Setup Advisor , TouchStone is plowing forward . Setup Advisor is a mini-program that was included last year in its $ 60 full-scale utility_program , CheckIt PRO Analyst . The company will market similar mini-programs , such_as one to help so-called road warriors who use portable_computers . But some say that TouchStone ' s opportunity won ' t last long since more and more people are just buying computers with pre-installed multimedia components . Manufacturers also are revising their kit installation software so it is easier to use . &quot; I ' d rather spend my time playing with interactive software than a screwdriver , &quot; said David Bunnell , editor in chief of New Media magazine , a multimedia industry journal in San Mateo . &quot; Installing a kit is a universal problem , but a short-term one &quot; because technology will eventually make the problem disappear . By 1995 , the majority of CD-ROM sales will be through purchases of new computers that come_with multimedia gear pre-installed on the machine , not from upgrade kits , Buchanan said . In addition , Microsoft and other industry leaders are trying to adopt equipment standards , dubbed Plug and Play , that would allow consumers to install any add-on device on any PC , regardless of the manufacturer of the PC or maker of the device . The standard technology will be built into Microsoft ' s upcoming Windows 4.0 software , due out at the end of this year . But for now , Jenkins said , computer users will have to get help from something like Setup Advisor or a friendly neighborhood computer whiz . &quot; In the meantime , we can do a lot of useful work , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
