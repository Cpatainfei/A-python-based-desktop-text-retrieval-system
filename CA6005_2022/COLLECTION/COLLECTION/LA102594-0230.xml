   <HEADLINE> PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT ; AROUND THE NFL ; COWBOY LINEMAN HURT IN CAR ACCIDENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dallas Cowboy Pro Bowl offensive lineman Erik Williams was injured in a car accident and probably will be sidelined until next year . &quot; He ' ll have the opportunity to play again but I doubt it ' ll be this year , &quot; Dallas Coach Barry Switzer said after visiting Williams in the hospital on Monday . &quot; In my opinion he ' s going_to need reconstruction of the right knee . Thank God he ' s alive. &quot; Williams suffered a sprained right knee in the early morning accident , as well as a broken rib , torn ligaments in his left thumb and facial cuts that required plastic_surgery . The Department of Public Safety said alcohol wasn ' t a factor_in the crash , but speed and fatigue were . The department said Williams was driving more_than 75 m.p.h. in a 35 m.p.h. zone , and he might be cited for speeding . Rookie Larry Allen will replace Williams at right tackle . Williams , 6 foot 6 and 325 pounds , was spared further injury because of the air_bag in his Mercedes . Williams ' car hit a guardrail as he was heading onto the tollway from Interstate 635 , officials said . He was heading_home from a dance club , where several players had gone_after returning to Dallas . In a separate incident , first-round draft pick Shante Carver ' s truck was found overturned on northbound Central Expressway at the exit ramp for westbound I-635 . Police said the truck hit a guardrail and flipped onto its hood , but the driver fled . Authorities don ' t know whether the defensive end was involved in the wreck . Someone identifying himself as Carver called police from a bar at 4 a.m. reporting his automobile had been stolen , police said . In other developments , Troy Aikman , who suffered a concussion in the first_quarter of a 28-21 victory over the Arizona Cardinals , said he will play_on Sunday against Cincinnati . Aikman underwent an MRI that was negative . . . . Tight end Jay Novacek probably will sit_out the Bengal game because of a possibly torn abdominal muscle . . . . Cowboy owner Jerry Jones is pushing a plan to expand Texas Stadium to 104 # 000 seats by 1999 , adding a retractable roof and replacing the artificial turf with grass . The project would cost $ 130 million to $ 140 million , Jones said . Officials said Jones also wants to build an NFL theme park . * Bengal Coach Dave Shula said third-stringer Jeff Blake probably will start at quarterback against the Cowboys . Starter David Klingler has a sprained ligament in his right knee and his status was listed as doubtful . Backup Don Hollas has a separated shoulder and will be sidelined at least two weeks . Four free_agent quarterbacks , including former Bengals Todd Philcox and Erik Wilhelm , will have tryouts today . Blake , a third-year player out of East Carolina , has never started an NFL game . * Washington Coach Norv Turner said rookie Gus Frerotte will start at quarterback for the second week in a row Sunday against the Eagles , instead of rookie Heath Shuler . . . . Dave Brown will keep his job as the Giant starting quarterback because his play isn ' t the only reason the team is riding a four-game losing_streak , Coach Dan Reeves said . . . . Brown quarterback Vinny Testaverde , a day after a concussion forced him to sit_out most of the second_half of a 37-13 victory over Cincinnati , said he will play Sunday at Denver . . . . Craig Erickson will start at quarterback for the Buccaneers Sunday against the Vikings , Coach Sam Wyche said . Erickson started the first six games of the season for the 2-5 Buccaneers , but Wyche started rookie Trent Dilfer in a 41-16 loss at San Francisco on Sunday . . . . 49er wide receiver John Taylor is scheduled to have exploratory arthroscopic surgery today on his right knee . Coach George Seifert said the soreness might be related to arthritis , and that Taylor could be back within 10 days . With the 49ers on a bye week , that means Taylor could play in the team ' s next game Nov . 6 at Washington or , more probably , Nov . 13 against Dallas . . . . Falcon wide receiver Andre Rison told The Atlanta Constitution he missed the team bus to the Raider game Sunday because Coach June Jones changed its departure_time . Jones made him sit_out the first_quarter and said Rison would be fined . . . . Bear running back Tim Worley , who missed Saturday ' s team flight and didn ' t play in Sunday ' s 21-16 loss to the Lions , met with Bear Coach Dave Wannstedt . Worley is a two-time offender of the NFL ' s substance-abuse policy . &quot; This is a little bit more_than just missing an airplane . ( When ) it gets resolved , hopefully in the next day or two , then I ' ll comment further. &quot; Wannstedt said . The Bears said a broken leg will sideline tight_end Chris Gedney for the season and that Erik Kramer will start next Monday night ' s game against Green_Bay at quarterback if his sprained ankle heals . If he isn ' t 100 % , Wannstedt said , Steve Walsh will start .</TEXT>
