   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS CREDITOR SEEKS PAYMENT ; FINANCE : UNPRECEDENTED MOVE FOLLOWS SEIZURE OF $ 2 BILLION IN COLLATERAL , STUNNING FINANCIAL MARKETS . POLICE PROTECTION , OTHER BASIC SERVICES WILL NOT BE DISRUPTED , OFFICIALS SAY , BUT MAJOR PROJECTS COULD BE JEOPARDIZED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County on Tuesday became the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for federal bankruptcy protection , after an all-day standoff with Wall_Street bankers who insisted that the county repay $ 1.2 billion in loans to its troubled investment pool . The stunning news that one of the nation ' s largest , wealthiest and most politically conservative counties was seeking protection from its creditors capped a day of turmoil that shook not just Orange County but the country ' s financial markets . Somber county officials insisted that the filing -- made at 5:01 p.m. Tuesday , an hour after the Santa Ana federal bankruptcy court ' s normal closing time -- would have no effect on the county ' s ability to maintain police protection and other basic services . But the move raised questions about the funding of dozens of major projects in the county , from toll roads to a Disneyland expansion to a possible new stadium for the Los Angeles Rams and California Angels sports teams . And it could cost the county its stellar bond_rating , meaning that it could become more expensive to borrow for public needs -- if the county and other local_government agencies are allowed to issue debt at all . One rating agency said it would drop Orange County ' s rating today from double-A to triple-C -- meaning they are viewed_as in danger of default . &quot; This certainly is a difficult pill to swallow right now , &quot; said state Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) , who will assume a seat on the County Board of Supervisors in January . &quot; It ' s a shocking occurrence . We ' re going to have to look_to Sacramento , to Washington and obviously we ' re going to have to look_to ourselves. &quot; Members of the Board of Supervisors , roused from their beds at 3 a.m. with news of an impending financial catastrophe , spent virtually all day behind closed doors . They met for hours with their advisers and attorneys to sort through the dilemma , made more drastic by one investment bank ' s demand that the county come_up with $ 1.2 billion in cash or securities that had come due Tuesday . The bankruptcy filing became inevitable after Orange County , through a private firm it had hired , approached leading Wall_Street firms Monday and began to try to liquidate its huge holdings of derivatives , according to a senior executive at one of the four biggest Wall_Street firms , who declined to be identified . Derivatives are the complex financial instruments that magnified the fund ' s exposure to rising interest_rates . The source said all_of the firms turned the county down -- partly because they found that the county fund ' s losses on the derivatives were much larger than the $ 1.5 billion that has been publicly reported . His firm , he said , concluded that the lost value is &quot; hundreds of millions &quot; more_than that , although not double the amount . &quot; They approached a number of people on the street , including us , to liquidate the portfolio for them , &quot; the executive said . &quot; But no one wanted to trade with them . The people who looked_at it ( the portfolio ) were frightened by it. &quot; By Tuesday , county supervisors and administrators were more nervous , placing calls to myriad state and federal_officials in search of financial help , such_as low-interest loans to help resolve the cash crisis . Instead , CS First Boston Corp . -- one of several large brokerages that has loaned the county money to purchase securities -- demanded additional collateral for $ 1.2 billion in loans it had made , which permitted the county to enlarge its fund with additional purchases of securities . When the county was unable to put_up the cash demanded , CS First Boston seized $ 2 billion in securities that had been held as collateral for the loans , according to Wall_Street traders familiar_with the situation . The brokerage_firm then placed those securities , mostly U.S._government agency bonds , on the bond market near the close of trading Tuesday , a move that stunned traders , dealers said . The county presumably lost money on the sale , but the extent of the loss could not be determined Tuesday . CS First Boston officials would not comment on their relationship with the county or on any actions the brokerage might have taken_on Tuesday . County officials said they saw no alternative by late in the day but to file for bankruptcy protection , despite the embarrassment and financial stigma it would bring . &quot; There was no alternative given to us , &quot; said Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder . &quot; We were concerned with the fact that we are here to protect the public and to protect the investors. &quot; Supervisor William G . Steiner expressed bitterness over the conduct of both Wall_Street and former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron , who resigned Sunday after 24 years in office . &quot; We ' ve had a steady parade of hotshots in blue shirts representing the investment_bankers pitching these sophisticated investment strategies , &quot; he said , &quot; and the treasurer obviously went_down that path. &quot; Steiner said he had two conversations with Gov . Pete Wilson to discuss the &quot; magnitude &quot; of the county ' s financial crisis and to ask_for help -- including a request that the state make an advance on funds due the county to help provide liquidity to the county fund . &quot; I ' m used to dealing with dysfunction , &quot; said Steiner , former director of the county ' s Orangewood Home for abused and neglected children in Orange . &quot; But never anything of this magnitude. &quot; Filing under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code is a desperate last step for any public entity , experts said . &quot; It ' s rare , it ' s quite rare . . . for any government to take that step -- and unprecedented for a county of that size , &quot; said Bennett Murphy , a bankruptcy expert and partner in the law_firm of Latham &amp; Watkins . &quot; It ' s seldom used , and I ' d say that it ' s quite unusual. &quot; Murphy said Chapter 9 functions much like Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code does for businesses : It provides a government with protection from its creditors while it attempts to work_out a plan for rehabilitating its finances . &quot; Drastic financial distress -- it ' s there for that purpose , &quot; Murphy said . Faced with criticism from federal regulators that state officials have failed to step_in swiftly to help , Wilson issued a terse , one-sentence statement through his press office . &quot; We will assist Orange County in analyzing the situation to identify the alternatives necessary so that Orange County can bring its finances back into solvency , &quot; Wilson said . The state_attorney general ' s office had lawyers &quot; looking all day at the situation , &quot; a spokesman said . Spokesman Dave Puglia said the federal Securities and Exchange Commission , which is investigating the Orange County financial crisis , &quot; has made contact with us , &quot; adding , &quot; we ' re working with them in any way that can be helpful. &quot; But Puglia also said the office was rebuffed by the SEC earlier Tuesday after state_attorneys requested access to all information on the ongoing financial crisis . The two sides agreed to discuss the dispute further on Wednesday . Federal_officials , meanwhile , said the debacle was the state ' s responsibility to resolve . &quot; We are watching the situation carefully but don ' t see the likelihood of a ripple impact in financial markets , &quot; a Clinton_Administration official said . The rumors of a bankruptcy filing -- an almost unthinkable turn of events for the affluent , conservative county -- spread from Wall_Street to Washington , D.C. , to California throughout the day . Rep . Christopher Cox ( R-Newport Beach ) had been the first to appear on television hinting at a bankruptcy filing . Cox , a former securities lawyer , said he had been in contact with county officials as the financial crisis exploded and will hold hearings to sort_out what happened and find ways to prevent such catastrophes in the future . Tuesday , county supervisors were roused from bed and called to the Hall of Administration in Santa Ana for a 4 a.m. briefing . But because of potential violations of the state ' s open meeting laws , the supervisors had to be sequestered in different parts of the building , with information shuttled among them from the county ' s financial advisers . Peer Swan , chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District -- which had threatened to pull its remaining $ 300 million investment out of the pool -- learned of the county ' s worsening troubles early Tuesday . &quot; This is high-stakes poker , &quot; Swan said . &quot; I can understand from an investment_firm ' s perspective that this is a bad situation and they have shareholders who are very concerned . However , investment_firms also have to realize that if they pull the plug , that ' s it . And that ' s a hard pill to swallow. &quot; Sources said that neither the SEC nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission_plans to take any major action in the near future concerning the Orange County situation , except to continue their very active investigations . The SEC had considered the possibility of going_into court to seek an injunction that would have placed the fund into receivership . But federal regulators ruled that out , concluding such a step might cause more , rather than less , disruption to the securities markets , sources said . One worry was that a receiver might forbid securities firms from selling any of the collateral they hold , which could cause serious disruption in the market . Some of the same ill effects , however , might happen amid bankruptcy proceedings , in which a bankruptcy judge could issue orders about the handling of securities and collateral . In addition , federal regulators were said to be concerned that there might be a political backlash if Washington stepped_in to seize control of the Orange County fund . Major investors in the fund said the bankruptcy filing could have a serious effect on their operations . Stan Oftelie , chief_executive of the Orange County Transportation Authority , said his agency would be stuck financially if its $ 1 billion in the county ' s fund was frozen for a long period_of_time . &quot; We ' ve taken steps today to make_sure we ' re OK until the end of the year , &quot; Oftelie said . &quot; But after that , I don ' t know how long we could last. &quot; Times staff writers Lee Romney , David Haldane , Len Hall , Susan Marquez Owen , Jodi Wilgoren and Rebecca Trounson in Orange County , Robert A . Rosenblatt in Washington , D.C. and Shawn Hubler and Tom Petruno in Los Angeles contributed to this story . Looking_for Protection WHAT IS CHAPTER 9 ? Only a municipality , such_as Orange County , may file for this type of bankruptcy . Chapter 9 buys_time for cities , school districts or other governmental agencies to work_out ways to pay their debts . WHY ORANGE COUNTY FILED &quot; There was no alternative given to us . We were concerned with the fact that we are here to protect the public and to protect the investors . And , of course , the county itself is 37 % of this fund . Then , everybody walked . The bond dealers -- they walked. &quot; -- Harriett M . Wieder , county supervisor WHAT IT MEANS The filing could affect about 180 cities , school districts and other governmental entities that have invested billions of dollars in the county portfolio . All of them use their investments to raise money to meet their obligations , such_as new construction , day-to-day services or loan payments . They also might not be able to borrow more money . County Fund Investors About 180 government agencies--schools , cities and special districts--have money in the county investment fund . Money designated as being in the &quot; bond pool &quot; is kept separate because it is governed by specific rules regarding a trading practice known as arbitrage , an effort to profit by borrowing at one interest_rate and investing at a higher one . Here is a partial list of investments as of Nov . 30 . It does not include about $ 550 million that was borrowed by school districts and individual investors : 03 # 36 , 19 # 19 AGENCY COMINGLED POOL BOND POOL County of Orange $ 2 # 555 , 620 # 144.87 $ 204 # 859 , 991.48 Transportation Corridor Agencies 45 # 469 , 591.93 296 # 294 , 198.03 OC Employee Retirement System 133 # 368 , 133.21 OC Transportation Authority 533 # 214 , 927.34 559 # 733 , 372.30 SCHOOL DISTRICTS Anaheim Elementary 8 # 195 , 095.54 Buena Park Elementary 4 # 372 , 602.99 Centralia Elementary 8 # 761 , 430.85 Cypress Elementary 6 # 781 , 785.21 Fountain Valley Elementary 5 # 652 , 274.37 Fullerton Elementary 5 # 135 , 978.87 Huntington Beach Elementary 6 # 964 , 640.68 La Habra Elementary 13 # 198 , 570.42 Lowell Joint Elementary 224 # 115.13 Magnolia 5 # 709 , 823.30 Ocean View Elementary 9 # 026 , 919.38 Savanna 3 # 502 , 369.38 Westminster 13 # 545 , 625.38 Anaheim Union High 19 # 393 , 555.70 Fullerton High 26 # 080 , 903.91 Huntington Beach High 22 # 576 , 957.13 Brea-Olinda 7 # 490 , 680.57 Capistrano Unified 74 # 977 , 478.92 Garden Grove Unified 55 # 533 , 788.92 Irvine Unified 105 # 816 , 239.05 1 # 961 , 245.96 Laguna Beach Unified 7 # 186 , 107.00 Los Alamitos Unified 12 # 526 , 409.33 Newport-Mesa Unified 82 # 402 , 832.16 Orange Unified 18 # 067 , 197.12 Placentia Unified 32 # 404 , 654.52 Saddleback Valley Unified 62 # 626 , 980.07 Santa Ana Unified 47 # 507 , 181.16 Tustin Unified 12 # 804 , 265.51 Coast Community_College 21 # 706 , 393.84 2 # 555 , 730.02 North OC Community_College 98 # 940 , 262.45 Rancho Santiago 16 # 762 , 391.36 Saddleback Community_College 23 # 532 , 257.26 OC Department_of_Education 47 # 725 , 879.97 San Joaquin Elementary 1 # 548.82 Yorba Linda Elementary 47 # 480.34 Shandon Unified 178 # 411.17 Foundation Trust_Fund 1 # 321 , 071.41 Community Facilities District 8 7 # 112 , 407.27 County School Service 21 # 461 , 375.56 Codesp Joint Powers Authority 262 # 157.50 Property and liability 196 # 395.81 Debt service 2 # 040 , 681.16 Special reserve 3 # 929 , 450.34 Public employees retirement 3 # 189.06 OC workers ' compensation insurance 6 # 900 , 645.06 Greater Anaheim Sp Ed GE 1 # 734 , 873.35 Schools Community Revolve 1 # 911 , 586.09 Teacher ' s retirement annuity 7 # 722 , 207.34 Unapportioned school monies 1 # 366 , 588.68 S.A.
