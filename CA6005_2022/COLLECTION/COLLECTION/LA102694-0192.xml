   <HEADLINE> HEMET SCHOOLS SUED OVER SEX CURRICULUM ; EDUCATION : PROGRAMS URGE PREMARITAL ABSTINENCE . CRITICS SAY THEY IGNORE CONTRACEPTION AND PROMOTE A SKEWED CONSERVATIVE AGENDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Hemet Unified School District was sued Tuesday for using three sex education programs that promote premarital abstinence . Critics say they violate state curriculum guidelines and are inaccurate , biased and distorted . The lawsuit on behalf of a group of Hemet parents is believed to be the first in California targeting the use of the controversial sex education programs known as Sex Respect , Teen-Aid and Choosing the Best . The three programs are growing in popularity among conservative school_boards nationwide because they preach that abstinence from premarital sex is the best way to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases . The lawsuit charges that the texts harm students because they do not include a discussion of contraception , are gender-biased and promote a skewed , conservative moral agenda . For example , one text preaches that &quot; premarital sex , especially with more_than one person , has been linked to the development of emotional illness. &quot; Another handbook concludes that &quot; one of the saddest things about today is so many men don ' t want to be real fathers. &quot; The lawsuit was filed by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the civil_liberties advocacy organization People for the American Way . An attorney for the plaintiffs said she did not expect the suit to go_to trial for at least a year . &quot; Hemet students are the latest pawns in a battle being fought nationwide to replace real sexuality education with pre-censored educational materials that rely_on fear , shame , religious indoctrination and blatant misinformation , &quot; said Jean M . Hessburg , director of People for the American Way . Mark Salo , executive_director of Planned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside Counties , charged the Hemet school_board with using the district &quot; as a playground to perpetuate its own selfish , rigid and narrow doctrine. &quot; While acknowledging the value of teaching that abstinence is a completely effective means of preventing pregnancy , he said that &quot; vows of abstinence break more often than condoms do. &quot; &quot; These curricula withhold information that can save lives and is vital in the preparation of adulthood , &quot; he said . In 1990 , the Hemet school district adopted Sex Respect for use in seventh-grade classes . Last month , the board_of_education , over the objections of a curriculum advisory committee of teachers and parents , the district ' s attorney and the superintendent , voted 5 to 2 to use the three programs this year in grades six , seven and nine . The state sets guidelines for sex education as a component of health classes but does not approve specific texts or endorse particular curricula . Hemet Associate Supt . William Wong said the district would not comment on the lawsuit . But board_of_education member and seventh-grade teacher Bonnie Parks , who uses Sex Respect in her classroom , said the district will address the state-mandated subjects of contraception , HIV and AIDS with supplemental materials . &quot; We ' re accused of not teaching kids about contraceptives , and that ' s a lie , &quot; she said . &quot; We use Sex Respect and Teen-Aid to emphasize abstinence , but we use statistics from the Centers_for_Disease_Control and other recognized authorities , as the law requires , to talk_about the success and failure rates of contraceptives , including condoms . &quot; In my classroom , we hear about condoms on almost a daily basis . We say that condoms are not 100 % effective but if someone chooses to disregard responsible sex in the only true safe way -- abstinence -- then condoms do reduce the risk and you ' d be foolish not to use them , &quot; she said . The lawsuit ' s plaintiffs said Tuesday that they were unaware that Hemet teachers planned to supplement the three abstinence-based programs with other materials . Even so , the critics said , just presenting the contents of the three programs to students does them a disservice . Other school districts that have adopted Sex Respect and similar programs have been threatened with lawsuits , but this is the first such suit filed_in California , the program ' s publisher and attorneys familiar_with the programs said . The ACLU threatened to file such a lawsuit against the Vista Unified School District in San Diego County but backed_off after the district rewrote some controversial statements in the curriculum . Parks said she questioned the motives of Planned Parenthood in filing the lawsuit . &quot; I think they ' re in it for their own profit and benefit because their big push is for contraceptives and abortions , &quot; she said . Parks said that 250 California school districts use Sex Respect but that fear of legal_action keeps others from doing so . &quot; We have to stand_up for what we think is right and best for the kids , &quot; Parks said . &quot; I think these programs are even more in keeping with California law than other comprehensive curricula , because the law says abstinence should be emphasized and the other programs lay it out like it ' s just one choice on the smorgasbord. &quot;</TEXT>
