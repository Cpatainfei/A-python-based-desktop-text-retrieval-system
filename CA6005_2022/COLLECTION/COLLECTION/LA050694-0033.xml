   <HEADLINE> SUBSIDIES FOR ELECTRIC_CARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Re &quot; The Electric_Car : Its Time Is Here -- and So Is Its Opposition , &quot; editorial , April 24 : Your editorial implies that anyone who speaks out against utilities receiving subsidies to develop electric vehicles is simply an instrument of the petroleum industry . In fact , we support the development of electric vehicles for all_the same reasons you do . What we oppose is utilities getting_into the car business at ratepayers ' expense . The electric and gas_companies that want a handout from the PUC in the form of rate increases to fund electric_car development are investor-owned companies , not public agencies . In every_other industry , it is investors who are expected to fund R &amp; D programs . That should be the case here , as well . If the utilities and their investors are so confident that electric_cars are the wave of the future , then let them put their own money on the line . The small businesses represented by our organization already have enough expenses . They don ' t need to be the funders of multimillion-dollar experiments that stand to benefit only those who can afford to buy blue-chip utility stocks . RAY DURAZO , Co-Chair Government Relations Committee Latin Business Assn. , Los Angeles * Kudos to The Times for pointing_out that the time is here for electric_cars and that many of the arguments against these zero-emission vehicles -- which can dramatically help improve air quality and California ' s economic competitiveness -- are not valid . Consumers also should be aware that mass penetration of electric vehicles into the Southern California market offers the potential to stabilize their electric rates . With charging of hundreds of thousands of vehicles overnight ( off-peak ) , when energy use is lowest , utilities such_as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ( DWP ) can operate more efficiently . The DWP already offers a discount demonstration nighttime charging rate to eligible electric vehicle owners ( a long-term discount_rate is under development ) , and thus electric vehicles make_sense not only environmentally but also from many economic perspectives . With the support of the state ' s utilities , and other private agencies , California will be ready for the introduction of electric vehicles . If the public interest is there , the infrastructure will be there -- now all we need are the commercially produced vehicles . KENNETH S . MIYOSHI General_Manager and Chief Engineer L.A. Department of Water and Power * I never thought that I would be considered &quot; opposition &quot; to either progress or an environmental cause , but your editorial supporting the electric_car on the basis of being &quot; 97 % cleaner than today ' s autos &quot; gives me no alternative . Your calculation includes atomic fission power_plants as a contributing source of electricity for electric_cars . It is certainly true that they do not pollute the air with nitrous_oxide , carbon_monoxide , or unburned hydrocarbons . But they do pollute with radiation , and with toxic_waste . And their potential for detrimentally affecting the environment is enormous . So if you want to be intellectually honest , remove them from your list , and redo your calculations . Better yet , support a law that says that for every electric_car produced , a truly clean power source must be built and a polluting one must be discontinued . Nobody could argue with that .
