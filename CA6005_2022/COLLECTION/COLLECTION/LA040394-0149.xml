   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; WE ' RE LISTENING , TED ; TED TURNER RECENTLY BOUGHT TWO MOVIE COMPANIES -- IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE ' S NOT JUST INTERESTED IN OLD MOVIES . BUT WHAT ARE HIS PLANS FOR NEW MOVIES ? A Q &amp; A WITH TURNER AS HE MOVES FULL SPEED INTO MOGULDOM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Being ushered_in to see Ted Turner in his basketball-court-sized office is like being ushered_in to see the Wizard of Oz . Past a boardroom corridor lined with movie stills , Oscar statuettes ( acquired from MGM ) and an oil_painting of Rhett Butler ( an early hero of Turner ' s , even before he acquired rights to &quot; Gone With the Wind &quot; ) , Turner opens the door to an office that has a wall of gleaming silver yachting trophies , a bank of TV screens and a small sign with his trademark slogan : &quot; Lead , follow or get_out of the way. &quot; Turner , 55 , is one of the great success stories in American business , and many competitors have lost money underestimating the driven , brash , impulsive Southerner who crashed the network television business in 1976 the way he crashed the genteel America ' s Cup yachting world . Now , after amassing a fortune of more_than $ 2 billion in the advertising , cable-TV ( his company operates five cable networks -- CNN , TBS , TNT , Headline News and the Cartoon Network -- and later this month will launch a sixth , Turner Classic Movies ) and sports businesses ( he owns baseball ' s Atlanta Braves and basketball ' s Atlanta Hawks ) , he has become a Hollywood mogul -- albeit long distance , from his headquarters here . His Turner Broadcasting System purchased the MGM library in 1986 , acquired the Hanna-Barbera animation studio in 1992 and last year bought two movie companies , New Line Cinema ( &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street , &quot; &quot; The Player &quot; ) and Castle Rock Entertainment ( &quot; City_Slickers , &quot; &quot; A Few Good Men , &quot; &quot; In the Line_of_Fire , &quot; TV ' s &quot; Seinfeld &quot; ) . They join the in-house production unit he already had , Turner Pictures , which had concentrated_on TV movies but now is stepping_up theatrical_production after its first venture into that area last year with &quot; Gettysburg. &quot; &quot; Turner has really created a de_facto mini-major studio at a significantly lower price than anyone else has been able to do , &quot; said Allan Kazzan , entertainment analyst for the Morgan Stanley investment_firm in New York . &quot; Castle Rock has great creative talent , and New Line has had the highest market share for any of the independents . If they can put it all together creatively . . . I think Turner may have pulled_off the deal of the century. &quot; Turner has grown more serious over the years , and his $ 1.2-billion purchase of the MGM library forced him to take_on partners ( Time Warner and Tele-Communications Inc. ) that have prevented him from acting unilaterally . Nevertheless , he remains passionate in his opinions , funny and disarmingly candid , both about his competitors and his own plans . In an interview , Turner discussed movies , his desire to own one of the Big Three broadcast networks and his marriage to Jane Fonda . * Question : Why did you want to buy Castle Rock and New Line ? Answer : The main programming element of our entertainment networks ( TNT and TBS ) is movies . We are starting a third network , Turner Classic Movies , that will show classic movies . We are expanding abroad , and we need to keep our film library fresh and alive to program our networks . We were producing a_couple_of theatrical films already , and we want to be in the movie business as well as the TV business because theatrical films get so_much more attention and promotion than TV films . Plus , with interactivity ( coming_to television ) , we need to be involved in home video as well as theatrical films and pay-per-view . * Q : Do you envision Castle Rock , New Line and Turner Pictures operating separately ? A : Absolutely . They ' re certainly going_to operate separately from a creative and marketing standpoint . They ' ve been operating successfully that way . * Q : So the executives who run Castle Rock , for example , will continue to do so from a creative standpoint ? A : Absolutely . * Q : Do you see yourself getting involved in the kinds of movies that New Line might make ? A : Not really . I ' m excited about what they ' re doing . Whenever you do as_many as 20 movies a year , as they are doing , you ' re going to personally like some and not like others . * Q : What kind of movies do you personally like ? A : I like a wide variety of films , but I guess I prefer historical dramas -- &quot; Gone With the Wind , &quot; &quot; Dr. Zhivago , &quot; &quot; Lawrence of Arabia. &quot; I would drift more to those than even the best of the comedies , like &quot; 9 to 5 &quot; and &quot; Airplane. &quot; I paid_cash money to see &quot; Aladdin , &quot; &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; and &quot; The Little Mermaid. &quot; I ' m in the cartoon business , but I probably would have gone_to see them anyway . These are supposed to be kids ' movies , but I ' m 55 and I went_to see them . * Q : You ' ve been outspoken on the subject of violence . . . . A : that ' s right : gratuitous violence . There was a lot of violence in &quot; Gettysburg , &quot; but I consider it anti-violence and anti-war . The type of violence in &quot; Single White Female &quot; -- I get some of this from Jane -- where sex and violence and attacks on women are mixed together , I think it ' s tragic that movies are made that titillate about violence in that way . There are so many people going_in and out of jail for violent crimes against women , for rape , for child molestation . You know that everything we ' re exposed to influences us -- our teachers , our parents . Those films influence us and the TV_programs we see influence us . The weaker your family is , the more they influence you . . . . The problems with families in our cities are catastrophic -- but when you put violent programs ( before ) people who haven ' t had a lot of love in their lives , who are angry anyway , it ' s like pouring gasoline on the fire . I went_for four or five years where I refused to air movie trailers for R-rated movies ( on TBS ) . Every one of the movie studios told us , &quot; If you don ' t take the R-rated movies , you ' re not going_to get the Gs and PGs. &quot; For five years , we had a virtual total boycott . And it was a time when we really needed the revenue . Today , we carry trailers for R-rated movies , but we review them and we don ' t carry anything with gratuitous violence in it . I was offered the Carolco library several years ago , with one of the worst movies , the &quot; Rambo &quot; series , and I would n ' t buy_it . I saw the first &quot; Rambo. &quot; Here we are trying to heal the country and what that movie did was to make people hate the Vietnamese . The Vietnamese were innocent . We ' re the ones that started that war ; they never attacked the United States ! We ' ve run some of Chuck Norris ' films on our networks . &quot; Rambo &quot; to me is a pro-war film -- making_it look_like fun , blowing people away . * Q : New Line Cinema has made a lot of money producing some violent movies , including the &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street &quot; series . Are you going_to say to them , &quot; Don ' t do ' Freddy Krueger 12 ' &quot; ? A : No , I ' m not . I ' ve basically given them creative control . I ' ve seen the Freddy Krueger movies . Horror , to me , when it ' s obviously tongue-in-cheek , is not as bad as the mixing of sex and gratuitous violence . With a horror movie , a genre that goes_back to Bela Lugosi , you know it ' s a scary movie . Nobody is going_to put knives on their fingers like Freddy Krueger . ( &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street &quot; ) is not the thing I ' m proudest about from ( New Line ) . I ' m prouder of &quot; Menace II Society. &quot; That had violence in it , but it wasn ' t pushing violence . To me , it was a movie that abhorred violence . New Line has made some movies with violence in them , and I guess they will continue to do so . Will it give me some trouble ? Yes . Does_it give them some trouble ? I ' m sure it does . * Q : I ' ve heard that there was one script that New Line wanted to buy , and you said it had too_much violence in it . Is that true ? A : No . A long_time back , before we made the deal , they may have asked me about a particular project that they turned_down on_their_own . * Q : On your own networks you ' ve done a series of movies about Native_Americans , an upcoming project on women ' s history and the &quot; Captain Planet &quot; cartoon series for children about the environment . These all reflect your personal interests . Are you going_to say to your movie studios , &quot; I want you to do a movie about the environment &quot; ? A : I ' ve got Turner Pictures for that . If I ' ve got a movie like &quot; Gettysburg &quot; that I just want to do , I can make_it through Turner Pictures . New Line and Castle Rock have their own bonus plans and their own goals . I ' m not going_to force them to take projects that they don ' t believe_in . Bob Shaye has been running New Line for 25 years , starting from nothing , and he ' s one of the few successful independents left ; all_the rest are gone . I ' ve known Alan Horn ( chairman of Castle Rock ) for 20 years , since he was with Norman Lear and I bought &quot; All in the Family &quot; and &quot; Sanford and Son &quot; from them . I know what they stand_for . * Q : Are you going_to look_at scripts from your movie companies ? A : No . Well , I may occasionally . I didn ' t even read the script for &quot; Gettysburg. &quot; I read the book and Jane read the script . But , I mean , I don ' t know a good script from a bad script -- I really don ' t . I can say what I like and what I don ' t like . I haven ' t had enough time in the movie business to really feel confident that I know what people are going_to come see . * Q : Is Jane Fonda going_to play a role in your movie studios ? A : Her company is producing a film for TNT , called &quot; Lakota Woman. &quot; She has bought the book &quot; Pigs in Heaven &quot; ( by Barbara Kingsolver ) , which her company is going_to do for Turner Pictures . * Q : Do you think she wants to come_back and star in movies ? A : She says no . * Q : How do you think you ' re regarded in Hollywood -- as an outsider or an insider ? A : It all depends_on the person ; I know some people better than others . I don ' t feel_like an outsider . We ' ve been a major customer of all_the studios -- licensing television and movies -- for years . * Q : I ' ve been told that you would like to buy ABC or NBC . Is this true ? A : Buy , merge , acquire -- whatever . I ' ve said for years that I would like to buy a network . I made that clear when I made the unfriendly offer for CBS ( in 1985 ) . . . . I ' d like to buy a network . I would like to have a studio -- in fact , I ' d like to have three or four studios and all four TV networks . And I ' d like to have all_the newspapers and magazines . I ' d like to own the BBC , too -- it ' s not for_sale ; it belongs_to the_British people . I ' d like to own General Motors and General Foods , while we ' re talking_about it . And let ' s not forget Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines -- two companies that I can see out the window ! * Q : Have you been talking to NBC and ABC recently ? A : There ' s a lot of talk that goes_on from time to time . But under our ownership with Time Warner and TCI , as long as there are FCC regulations regarding cross-ownership , you can ' t own ( broadcast-network ) owned-and-operated TV_stations in the same market with cable . So the rules won ' t allow us to do_it . We ' ve been partners with Time Warner and the other cable operators since 1986 , when they helped us after MGM . That partnership has worked very well . If the rules change , certainly I would like to own a network . The networks are coming_back , and I believe they ' ve proven they ' re going to be around for a long_time . * Q : Are you willing to surrender your 52 % voting control of your company to buy a network or make some new alliance ? A : I haven ' t really had control for a long_time . When you have two different owners of this company besides me that can veto any expenditure over $ 2 million , what kind of control is that , over a company that ' s doing close to $ 3 billion ( in revenue ) ? I have day-to-day operating control , but really only so_long , I think , as I ' m doing a good job . * Q : Do you feel hamstrung by these arrangements ? A : Sometimes I feel hamstrung -- restrained would be a better word . Yes , there are times when this relationship is restraining , but there are lots of other times when it ' s highly beneficial . Hopefully , the benefits will outweigh the restraints . There ' s no way you can have partners without being restrained in some way . I think my net worth has increased 10 to 20 times in the last seven years , and so has their investment . So from a financial standpoint , it ' s been a very , very good relationship . And it ' s been a lot of fun . I never regretted taking the partners I did . . . . I just don ' t have enough money to own the company myself any more . You just can ' t accumulate the billions of dollars in capital that are necessary -- not in my lifetime , not today . * Q : Are you and Time Warner going_to separate at some point ? A : I don ' t know . I doubt it . We ' re getting_along fine . We do compete in some areas , and we cooperate in some areas . In this industry , you do business with your competitors because there are only so many companies , and it makes_sense to go_through one or the other for various things . Here we are releasing a movie with Fox ( &quot; Pagemaster &quot; ) , who ' s a competitor . Rupert Murdoch is one of the largest customers for &quot; CNN News Source &quot; for his television_stations , and we also buy programs from Columbia , another competitor , and they ' re going to be distributing the Castle Rock movies for the next 3 1 / 2 years . Everybody needs everybody else in this business . * Q : Would you ever sell CNN ? A : I have considered it a_couple_of times and come_up with a big no . * Q : From your heart ? A : Yes . I don ' t want to sell it . I don ' t want to sell anything . I want to buy . ( In fact , since the interview , Turner has been exploring the purchase of the Home Shopping Network. ) There are no assets here that aren ' t pretty integral to the company . We ' ve stayed in the programming and television business . CNN is an extension of that . Getting_into the movie business is an extension of that . * Q : You were interested in making a bid for Paramount recently , then dropped_out . A lot of people in the entertainment_industry are saying the deal cost Viacom too_much ( $ 10 billion ) . What do you think_of the deal ? A : There ' s no question it ' s a lot of money to pay . It all depends_on how successful they are with the assets they have . I think it ' s important that the Blockbuster deal go_through to give Sumner Redstone enough capital to spread that debt over and enough cash flow to help him retire the debt . Wayne Huizenga ( Blockbuster chairman ) is one of the smartest guys around -- he ' s proved that in two fields ( waste management and home video ) -- and ( Viacom Chief_Executive ) Frank Biondi ' s smart , so it ' s up_to them . . . . It ' s like asking who ' s going_to be the winner in the television of the future . It depends_on who makes the right moves between now and then . Who ' s going_to win the World_Series the year after next ? Who knows ? The team that makes the best moves . You can ' t predict things statically . * Q : The Paramount merger is happening , but the TCI-Bell Atlantic merger fell_through . When you look down the road , do you see mega-mergers as the way the business is going ? A : It depends completely on your circumstances and what end of the business you ' re in . I think a cable operator is very different from a motion-picture studio . If you ' re going to be in the motion-picture business , you have to be big enough to compete in a major way . I think time has shown that the little independents just making a_few pictures and depending_on somebody else to distribute them without the income of a library -- that ' s not a viable operation . . . . The whole business is like there ' s a medium-sized fish , and there ' s a big fish coming behind you , and a little fish in front of you , and you ' re trying to eat the smaller fish before the bigger fish gets you . * Q : Which one are you ? A : I think basically you have to look ahead and you have to look over your shoulder , too . We ' re competing with the four broadcast networks . We ' re competing with Viacom . ABC owns ESPN , and ( Rupert ) Murdoch has a studio and a TV network ( Fox ) . NBC has a cable network , CNBC , and another one starting -- and they ' ve got General Electric behind them . Everyone has their problems and their opportunities . * Q : Rupert Murdoch recently bought Star TV , the company that owns the huge communications satellite over Asia , carrying MTV and the BBC ' s TV news channel . Murdoch has said that he wants to take CNN on internationally . Do you think you ' re vulnerable there ? A : Virtually everyone in the TV-news business would like to go head-to-head with us and are trying . NBC has a Spanish network in South_America . They recently bought ( European superstation ) SuperChannel , but they ' re running &quot; The Tonight Show &quot; and the &quot; Today &quot; show on it . I don ' t see how telling people the weather in Iowa plays in Europe . Rupert said he was going_to do an international news network , but they keep delaying it , don ' t they ? The BBC is trying to compete with CNN International . It takes a lot of money and commitment to do a 24-hour news service . CNN has been available around the world for the past five years and we were the first to connect the whole world . We ' ve got a big head_start , and nobody has mounted a credible challenge yet . * Q : Years ago you used to delight in trashing the networks , saying you wanted to lower their share of the audience . . . . A : We did . Their share of audience has gone from 90 % to 60 % in prime_time . * Q : When you started_out with your superstation TBS ( in 1976 ) , did people take you seriously ? A : When I was first getting going , people fell_out of their chairs laughing . The TV_station I bought was going bankrupt ; I couldn ' t afford to buy a network affiliate . The smaller you are and the bigger you aim , the more hooting and hollering you ' re going to get . that ' s not just true of me . If you ' re at McDonald ' s making $ 1 an hour and you say , &quot; I ' m going_for $ 1.10 , &quot; nobody ' s going_to doubt you . If you ' ve got a dollar and you say , &quot; I ' m going_to build a multibillion-dollar corporation that is going_to rival the networks , &quot; then they ' re going to hoot at you . . . . When I first got going ( with TBS ) , I went_to New York and said to one of the media buyers there , &quot; We ' re in 2 % of households and we ' re going to build a network. &quot; He was in a swivel_chair ; he literally laughed so hard he fell_back and nearly hit his head on the radiator . He said , &quot; With that broken-down station in Atlanta ? You ' ve got_to be kidding ! &quot; And I had to laugh with him . * Q : Where is he now ? A : Actually , he ' s still there -- and one of our biggest customers . . . . I haven ' t burned a lot of bridges . * Q : ( TCI president ) John Malone , a friend of yours , recently was quoted saying that you ' re a sound businessman , but you get emotional . Is that true ? A : Sure , I get emotional -- doesn ' t everybody ? I get emotional when I see my kids . I get emotional when I see my wife . I cry at sad movies . I cried like a baby when I saw &quot; 8 Seconds. &quot; * Q : Really ? Why ? A : It reminded me -- the kid was having trouble ; his father was pushing him all_the time . And my father kind of pushed me . After the rodeo_rider became world champion , he was getting_married and thinking_about quitting . . . . that ' s how he got killed , getting gored by a Brahma bull . that ' s the last thing I ' d want to do -- that bull wants to kill you . * Q : Do you see the communications business as having only a_few global companies in the future , or will there always be room for entrepreneurs ? A : Sure . There also will be big global companies -- and we ' re one of them , although we ' re not as big as some of the others . * Q : What other mountains do you want to climb ? A : From now on , what I ' d like to do is quality . I ' d like to make the best movies and TV_programs that we can . Castle Rock does &quot; Seinfeld , &quot; one of the best sitcoms on TV . It ' s intelligent and doesn ' t dump on anyone . In our movies for TNT , we ' ve done David Mamet ' s &quot; Life in the Theater , &quot; Arthur Miller ' s &quot; The American Clock &quot; and a lot of other good projects . We just had a three-hour documentary on Antarctica that got great reviews . We did &quot; Captain Planet , &quot; not &quot; The X-Men &quot; or Amy Fisher . I think we ' ve got more serious , credible news than the other guys . we ' ll continue to do those kinds of programs , with quality and relevance and benefit . * Q : Is that more important to you today ? A : Well , what am I going_to do with more money ? I ' m planning right now to give half of what I have away . Last year , I gave 10 % of what I have away . I gave_away $ 200 million of my $ 2 billion . I ' m looking_to getting my foundation up_to $ 1 billion . The foundation works primarily in environment and population . There are so many problems in the world that need addressing . * Q : What has been the biggest change in your life since your marriage to Jane Fonda ? A : It ' s hard to say . I ' m sure I ' ve changed in a lot of subtle ways . When you make such a big change in your life , it ' s bound to change you . You have to blend your lives together . * Q : Has she made you more of a feminist ? A : Yes , probably , although I believed_in women ' s rights before . In many places in this world , they still practice female infanticide . In more_than half the world , women don ' t have equal rights with men . * Q : Are you able to relax on your ranch in Montana ? A : I try to relax . But I end_up doing a lot of work wherever I am , out_in Montana or wherever I am . I get a big Fed Ex box of stuff every day , wherever I am . * Q : Are you ever going_to retire ? A : I don ' t plan to .</TEXT>
