   <HEADLINE> FOREIGN_POLICY THAT WEARS ITS HEART ON THE SLEEVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once again , the prospect of U.S. intervention in foreign lands , the source of often bitter debate since the Vietnam_War , is center stage . Even as U.S. troops help Rwandan refugees and a confrontation with Fidel Castro looms , attention is shifting back to Haiti . Armed with a U.N Security_Council endorsement and an &quot; international &quot; presence of 266 Caribbean troops , the Clinton_Administration is edging toward an invasion of Haiti that will be the ' 90s version of gunboat_diplomacy . Although U.S. intervention in Cuba may seem far-fetched by comparison , the logic of Administration policy toward Cuba is virtually identical to that of its policy toward Haiti . Both are largely driven by narrow domestic politics -- the Congressional Black Caucus ( Haiti ) and Cuban Americans ( Cuba ) . In both , tightening U.S. trade_embargoes adds misery to the lives of ordinary citizens , which makes the temptation to flee their country all_the more compelling . And in both cases , regimes lacking democratic legitimacy are somehow seen as threats to the United States . During the Cold_War , national interest or a perceived security threat was the prime_mover behind U.S. interventions . Today , a moral imperative -- feeding the hungry , imposing democracy , for example -- appears to be the rationale . But will spending U.S. resources for such noble goals win_over the American public , or will it generate an isolationist backlash ? The issue of intervention goes_to the heart of the debate over what the post-Cold War order will be . It is an untidy , two-tier world : One , encompassing North_America , Western Europe , Japan and parts of East Asia , is a relatively stable , democratic zone of peace . The other , including a large swathe of Southwest Asia and Africa , is a conflict zone of ethnic and religious hatreds , crushing poverty and failed nation-states . The gap between these two worlds is growing even as the will or ability of the international community to close it lessens . However belatedly , the United States filled the humanitarian vacuum in Rwanda . But which country will step_in when neighboring Zaire , 10 times the size of Rwanda , falls_apart ? Moreover , at a time when the United Nations lacks the resources to feed the world ' s starving , let alone stop such internal horrors as the genocide in Rwanda , the big powers are eroding its legitimacy by blessing what U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright euphemistically calls &quot; sphere-of-influence &quot; peacekeeping . In the name of multilateralism and international_law , they are discrediting perhaps the most important instrument of multilateralism -- the U.N. Security_Council . Whatever else Haiti may be , it is not enough of a threat to international security and peace to warrant invoking the U.N. Charter . Putting a U.N. stamp of political correctness on the Administration ' s desire to oust the thugs in Port-au-Prince does not make what is , in reality , the exercise of power_politics any less so . To be sure , each case of regional instability is different and must be assessed in its particulars . The problem , as the President pointed_out in a recent speech , is that &quot; unless human tragedy is caused by natural disaster , there is no such thing as a purely humanitarian enterprise. &quot; Thus , regardless of the motive for intervention , it almost inevitably puts you on one side or the other in an internal conflict . Furthermore , in a world of sovereign nations , few governments will sacrifice its citizens where no vital interest is at risk . Witness the lack of response to the U.N. call_for help in Rwanda when genocide raged . Building an international_system reflective of big-power realities and responsive to the burgeoning challenges flowing_from failed states will take time . Progress will be incremental , at best . Consider the U.N. success story of Cambodia . In effect , the 1991 Paris peace accord placed the country into receivership for two years , during which U.N. civil_servants oversaw government until last year ' s democratic elections . But to many , the idea of trusteeship smacks of a politically incorrect neo-colonialism . And even if this were a preferred course of action , who would foot the bill ? Cambodia cost the international community some $ 1 billion and its turmoil is still not over . Unlike those &quot; present at the creation &quot; of the post-World War II order , the Administration lacks the Soviet threat , which animated U.S. efforts to rebuild Europe and Japan . It is far more difficult to generate -- and sustain -- support for the hard slogging of forging a new_world system without a direct threat . But it is wrong to accuse the Administration of failing to replace the policy of containment with new universal principles . In the complex and murky global environment we live_in , there is no real replacement for the Soviet threat . The challenge is to define U.S. national interests and priorities , balance means and ends , resources and commitments , and exercise steady leadership as a first among equals . It is_on these issues that the Clinton_Administration can be fairly criticized for leaving much to be desired . The use of force where no vital interest is at stake , however well-intentioned , may only fuel isolationism and skepticism of the need for a strong defense . In the case of Cuba , pursuing a policy designed to ease its transition from post-Cold War orphan to mainstream member requires not acts of war , but enlightened engagement aimed at building a private sector and civic society -- the basis of a transition to democracy . Clearly , starving refugees should be fed , genocide stopped , peace kept and democracy encouraged . But the hard reality is that not all problems have readily available solutions . That doesn ' t mean the international community should not do the best it can . The danger is that by raising expectations -- of &quot; enlarging democracy , &quot; preventing crises where conflict grows not from misunderstanding but long-simmering hatred or &quot; nation-building &quot; of failed states -- a lack of realism will foster the isolationism the Administration quite rightly opposes . Balancing a clear-eyed pursuit of national interest with the strain of idealism that is the hallmark of the American character in a world lacking an all-encompassing threat is the key to successful U.S. engagement in the new era .</TEXT>
