   <TEXT> The defending world champion U.S. women ' s national soccer team Sunday gave Coach Anson Dorrance the going-away present he wanted . By defeating Canada , 6-0 , in Montreal , the U.S. team clinched first place in the CONCACAF regional qualifying tournament for next summer ' s FIFA Women ' s World Championship in Sweden and earned the right to be one of the top seeds . Sunday ' s game was the last for Dorrance after nine years in_charge of the American team . His record of 65-22-5 includes a world championship in China in 1991 and three CONCACAF championships . &quot; It has been a wonderful ride , &quot; Dorrance said . &quot; Coaching my final match was not as emotional as the night I announced to the team I was leaving . I really appreciate everything this team has done for me over the years. &quot; Assistant coach Tony DiCicco will take_over today from Dorrance , who will continue to coach the perennial NCAA champion North Carolina women ' s team .
