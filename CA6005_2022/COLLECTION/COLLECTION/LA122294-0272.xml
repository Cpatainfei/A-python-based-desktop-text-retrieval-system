   <HEADLINE> MORE RUSSIAN TROOPS TO ARRIVE IN CHECHNYA ; CAUCASUS : YELTSIN APPEALS TO CHECHENS TO END RESISTANCE . CAMPAIGN AIMED AT QUASHING INDEPENDENCE BID APPEARS BOGGED DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia ordered fresh troops to the tiny republic of Chechnya on Wednesday after 11 days of a sluggish , inconclusive military_campaign aimed at crushing its bid for independence . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin appealed_to the Chechen people to stop their armed resistance , and he promised they will never again be deported from their homeland , as they were 50 years ago . Yeltsin also instructed military commanders to &quot; spare no effort in restoring the rule of the Russian constitution &quot; in the Muslim republic . Two battalions of Russian marines were to arrive in Chechnya today to reinforce forward units near Grozny , the rebel capital , Russia ' s Interfax news_agency reported . A motorized infantry regiment was also en route . Thousands of Russian troops have been bogged down in heavy skirmishing on Grozny ' s outskirts since they rolled into the republic in tanks . Amid rising casualties on both sides , Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev admitted Wednesday that the offensive , Moscow ' s biggest since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 , was going much slower than planned . A Russian lawmaker on the scene said 11 Russian soldiers were killed Tuesday night in heavy fighting north of Grozny . Villagers on an unarmed collective near the city told foreign reporters that tank shelling killed five children from a single family that night . Chechnya ' s irregular army appeared to be suffering ammunition shortages that kept its antiaircraft_guns silent for the first time in four straight nights of Russian bombing and missile assaults on Grozny . As the siege wore_on with no clear outcome in_sight , Yeltsin issued his first communique of the offensive , seeking to overcome the Chechens ' worst fear of Russian domination . That fear is rooted in the deportation of 800 # 000 Chechens by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin , who suspected them of wartime sympathies with the Nazis . Historians say at least 200 # 000 Chechens died in rail cars en route to Siberia . In a statement read for him on television , Yeltsin accused Chechnya ' s separatist leaders of spreading &quot; malicious rumors &quot; that another such ordeal was in_store for the Chechens , &quot; in_order to arouse their fears and hatreds and to induce them to resist the legitimate authorities. &quot; &quot; Deportation of the Chechen people will never occur under any circumstances , &quot; he declared . &quot; Those who were forced ( by the fighting ) to leave their homes will be able to return unobstructed. &quot; The appeal came a day after Gen . Dzhokar M . Dudayev , the Chechen leader who declared independence from Russia three years ago , abandoned his nine-story presidential palace in Grozny and dropped from public view . Yeltsin said Russian troops aimed to &quot; restore legality , law and order &quot; in the southern republic of 1.2 million people . He promised generous help to restore its moribund oil-based economy if the resistance stops . Chechens listen to official Russian statements , but the brute force of the military_campaign may have negated any positive impact of Yeltsin ' s belated promises . Yeltsin prepared the statement after his human_rights commissioner visited Chechnya , reported counting 42 dead civilians and declared the offensive itself to be a violation of human_rights . Russian officials said as_many as 100 # 000 Chechens have fled their mountainous homeland in the last 11 days , but foreign reporters in Grozny said the will to resist the Russians is high among those who remain . &quot; Our ancestors were fighting the Russians for 300 years , and we can do the same , &quot; an elderly man standing beside a bunker 20 miles outside Grozny told Reuters news_agency . &quot; Chechnya is a subject only to Allah , &quot; read a banner over Grozny , mocking Yeltsin ' s insistence that Chechnya is a &quot; subject &quot; of the multiethnic Russian Federation . How long the ragtag Chechen army of a_few thousand men can defend Grozny is unclear . Russia sealed_off its borders with Georgia and Azerbaijan , to the south of Chechnya , in a bid to cut_off war materiel to the rebels from elsewhere in the Caucasus Mountains and the Middle_East . The blockade may be effective on the main_roads but not necessarily on mountain_trails . As of Wednesday , the Russian army had still not managed , and perhaps not even attempted , to encircle Grozny from the south and east . Kozyrev told reporters that the offensive was moving slowly to minimize civilian casualties . He admitted that Russian commanders had not even contemplated in_advance &quot; the option of protracted combat operations &quot; but said the operation would go_on &quot; as long as necessary. &quot; In fact , many Russian commanders and troops expressed reluctance to advance any farther toward Grozny regardless of their orders . The offensive has claimed the lives of at least 34 Russian soldiers and uncounted Chechens and has cost the beleaguered Russian treasury more_than $ 100 million .</TEXT>
