Her brain was only partly developed , she had spina_bifida and partial paralysis , her limbs were malformed , and she faced a life of pain . Justice Minister Winnie Sorgdrager ordered the prosecutions to determine how the law applies to cases when a doctor ends the life of a person who is unable to ask_for death . The law requires doctors to show that a patient was terminally ill , in unbearable suffering and had repeatedly asked to die .</TEXT>
