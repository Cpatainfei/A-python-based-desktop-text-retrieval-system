   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT : WHAT BILL SHOULD SAY TO BORIS ; A BAND OF ECONOMISTS WANT TO HEAD OFF THE RECOVERY BEFORE IT HITS ITS STRIDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The pain that Russia ' s economic reform inflicts on its average citizen was clearly reflected in the recent election in which right-wing and anti-reform parties gained at the expense of President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s followers and of economic reformers in_general . Not surprisingly , Yeltsin has responded by saying that he will slow the pace of reform and do more to raise the Russian standard_of_living . While saying that may be good politics for Yeltsin , actually slowing the pace of reform would be bad economics . Russia was_on the right track before the election and should not abandon its progress in developing a market_economy . That is the message that President Clinton should bring_to Moscow . Unfortunately , that is not the message that senior U.S. officials have been sending_in recent weeks . When Vice_President Gore was in Moscow , he criticized the International Monetary Fund ' s support of rapid privatization and tough anti-inflationary policy . And Strobe Talbott , now the second in command in the State_Department , recently quipped that the Russians need a policy with less shock and more therapy . Because the dissatisfaction of the Russian people and the inequities that have developed in their private sector have been_well publicized , it is easy to overlook the real progress toward a market_economy over the past year . In fact , two key reforms have been introduced . First , there has been significant progress in privatizing existing enterprises and in allowing new private enterprises . More_than a third of all Russian employees now work for firms that have in some sense been privatized . Second , most prices have been decontrolled , allowing supply and demand to determine them . This has eliminated artificial scarcity , bringing consumer goods back to store shelves . Only such fundamental economic reform can raise the Russian standard_of_living to that of the major Western countries . Now , Russia ' s per-capita income is less than half that in the countries of Western Europe . Seventy-five years of communism have left a mis-structured economy that resists change . Under the communist system , economic decisions were based on the wrong prices and incentives . Managers and workers now continue to work with antiquated plants and equipment . Many find it difficult to give_up old habits best summed up by a worker ' s comment that under communism , &quot; They pretended to pay us and we pretended to work. &quot; Even in eastern Germany , the most efficient of the communist_economies , moving to a market_economy has meant firing two out of three workers in newly privatized industrial companies . It is inevitable that there will be further job losses and income reductions in Russia until resources have been redeployed more productively in response to market_prices . Further pain will also be necessary to bring_down the high rate_of_inflation . Until now , Yeltsin has been unable to force the Russian Central_Bank to stop its inflationary policies . Instead of limiting credit , it has continued to lend to bankrupt corporations to bail_out managements . The slower pace of reform that Yeltsin has spoken_of would not make_it any easier or less painful to achieve a market_economy . Experience in other former communist countries shows the benefit of not delaying reform . Although Poland and the Baltic countries suffered substantially during the first years of reform , they are now enjoying a general recovery with increasing prosperity . In contrast , Ukraine and Romania , where reform has been delayed , are experiencing painfully chaotic conditions . The political costs of a prolonged restructuring could well prove to be higher than the costs of a quick though severe one . Extending the timetable might only increase the political opposition to reform . Economics and politics both conclude that the sooner and quicker , the better . Unfortunately , the pain of correcting the errors of 75 years cannot be significantly reduced by foreign_aid , even if the United States and other Western governments made very generous gifts . Since Russia has a population of more_than 250 million people , each $ 1 billion of aid adds less than $ 4 to per-capita income in a country where average income is now about $ 7 # 000 . Even the very implausible $ 25 billion of aid that some have advocated would raise Russian incomes by less than 2 % . In the end , there is little the West can or should do to affect Russian economic reform . The decision of what to do and how fast to move must be left to the Russian government . But Clinton should be clear that there is no viable alternative to a market_economy and that rapid reform is more likely to succeed .</TEXT>
