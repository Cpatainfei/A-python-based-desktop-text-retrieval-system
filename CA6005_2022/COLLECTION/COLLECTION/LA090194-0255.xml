   <HEADLINE> IRA CALLS TRUCE IN FIGHT TO END BRITISH RULE IN N . IRELAND ; EUROPE : MOVE COULD LEAD TO SETTLEMENT OF 25-YEAR CONFLICT , BUT GUERRILLAS ' STATEMENT DOES NOT SPECIFY IF HALT TO VIOLENCE IS PERMANENT . LONDON OFFICIALS ARE CAUTIOUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a major development that could signal an end to one of the world ' s oldest conflicts , the_Irish Republican Army announced Wednesday a &quot; complete cessation &quot; of violence in its struggle to end British control over Northern_Ireland . &quot; In order to enhance the democratic peace process and underline our definitive commitment to its success , the leadership of ( the IRA has ) decided that as of midnight Wednesday , Aug . 31 , there will be a complete cessation of military operations , &quot; declared a statement issued by the IRA in Dublin , the_Irish capital . &quot; All our units have been instructed accordingly. &quot; The brief statement , issued just before lunchtime here , ended days of mounting speculation that a major breakthrough in the conflict was imminent . It was immediately hailed by the_Irish government and leaders of the Roman_Catholic community in Northern_Ireland as the end of the 25-year-long guerrilla campaign . &quot; There ' s a deep sense of history in this house today and , indeed , throughout the country , &quot; Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds told a special_session of the_Irish Parliament after the statement was issued . &quot; It is a day that many had begun to fear they might never see. &quot; President Clinton , who has quietly nudged the warring parties toward a peace formula since February , also hailed Wednesday ' s developments as &quot; a watershed announcement &quot; and said the cease-fire could &quot; mark the beginning of a new era that holds the promise of peace for all_the people of Northern Ireland. &quot; But the omission of specific wording in the IRA statement that the cease-fire would be permanent triggered immediate concern among senior British government officials here , who said more was needed before the peace process could move forward as planned . Under an accord worked_out in December , if the IRA agreed first to give_up violence , the_British and Irish governments agreed to give Sinn Fein , the IRA political wing , a voice in round-table negotiations that would search for a lasting settlement to the Northern_Ireland conflict . In virtually all their references_to the agreement , British officials have stressed the need for an IRA pledge for a permanent end to the violence . It was also unclear if militant Protestants would carry_out their threats to step_up their own campaign of violence in the wake of the IRA announcement . Despite this concern and the_British reservations , the IRA announcement is the single biggest step so far toward ending a conflict that has claimed more_than 3 # 000 lives and left another 30 # 000 wounded in a quarter-century of violence . Indeed , just hours before the IRA declaration , the dispute claimed its most recent victim , as the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force kidnaped a 37-year-old Catholic , shot him in the head and dumped his body on a roadside . The current clashes are merely the latest chapter in a centuries-old saga of violence that has pitted the Roman_Catholic Irish nationalist minority against a mainly Protestant majority who see British rule as the lone guarantor of their identity . While the hostility dates to the early 17th Century , when the first Protestant settlers arrived in Ulster from Scotland , the current struggle has its roots in the IRA ' s rejection of the 1920s agreement that gave Ireland independence but left the six northern counties , collectively the province of Ulster , in British hands . The present chapter of violence began in Londonderry in August , 1969 , when Catholics and Protestants rioted . The killing that has ensued is only the visible aspect of a pervasive fear and misery in which an entire generation has matured : After hearing of Wednesday ' s cease-fire announcement , one Belfast resident said she dreamed of being able to leave her front_door open again in the summer as she did_in the years before 1969 . While there were isolated celebrations in Northern_Ireland , the prevailing mood among its 1.5 million residents was one of nervous optimism . &quot; There ' s a lot of suspicion , &quot; said John Derby , a political_scientist at the University of Colraine , in a mainly Protestant town . &quot; I think it will be hard for the Unionists ( Protestants ) to sit_down with people who ' ve been killing them for the last 25 years. &quot; Wednesday night , British Prime_Minister John Major was seeking assurances about the IRA statement from Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams that could lead to just such a meeting at the peace table . &quot; If he were to say tonight , ' This statement is unambiguous , ' that the violence has ended for good , then within three months we could start talking with Sinn Fein on how to go_forward with the peace process , &quot; Major told the_British Broadcasting Corp . Northern_Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew , when asked if the IRA statement met British demands , answered , &quot; No , I don ' t think it ' s clear. &quot; But he added that &quot; a very few informal words &quot; of assurances would be enough to start the process . In a television interview late Wednesday , Adams said he would attempt to get the clarifications . In return for the cease-fire , Adams also called_for a demilitarization of Northern_Ireland -- a withdrawal of the 18 # 000 British soldiers stationed there -- and a return of the IRA prisoners to Northern_Ireland from jails in Britain . But the absence of any reference_to a permanent cease-fire in Wednesday ' s announcement fueled existing anger and suspicion among hard-line Protestants in Northern_Ireland . With the kind of hate-fueled logic that has so often prevented progress toward peace among the warring factions in the past , Protestant militants are convinced that anything suggested or offered by the IRA , must , almost by definition , be bad for them . They believe the_British and Irish governments must have made secret concessions to get the IRA to agree to a cease-fire . And celebrations Wednesday by Roman_Catholic residents in the Ulster capital of Belfast , who drove through their neighborhoods cheering and waving the_Irish flag , only reinforced Protestant convictions that the IRA cease-fire is part of a deal against their interests . Ian Paisley -- the leader of the smaller , more radical of the two Protestant-based political_parties in Northern_Ireland and a member of the_British Parliament -- denounced the wording of the IRA statement as &quot; a clever Jesuit expression. &quot; &quot; The only way for the IRA to prove this cease-fire is permanent is by giving_up their killing machine and turning_in their Semtex ( explosives ) stores , their guns , their mortars and their equipment , &quot; he thundered . James Molyneaux , head of the more moderate of the Ulster Protestant-based parties , was less emotional , but stated : &quot; It ' s a cessation of hostilities , that ' s all it is . It ' s not convincing. &quot; Wednesday ' s cease-fire announcement follows a series of low-profile meetings between Anthony Lake , President Clinton ' s national security adviser , and leaders of all potential participants in a negotiated settlement . Clinton also reportedly personally approved limited visas for Joseph Cahill of the IRA and Patrick Treanor of Sinn Fein , who traveled_to the United States on Tuesday to explain the cease-fire arrangement to American groups active in backing the guerrillas financially . On the question of possible U.S. economic aid to Northern_Ireland , a senior White_House official said Wednesday , &quot; We ' re open-minded but we haven ' t committed anything on that. &quot; Administration officials also said they believe that their behind-the-scenes meetings and letters helped push the IRA toward peace . A senior official noted that Clinton talked to Major 15 times on the subject in August alone . He said there have been meetings and telephone_conversations since Feb . 2 . Times staff writer Norman Kempster in Washington contributed to this report . * REACTION GUARDED : Local Irish Americans welcome the truce -- but warily .
