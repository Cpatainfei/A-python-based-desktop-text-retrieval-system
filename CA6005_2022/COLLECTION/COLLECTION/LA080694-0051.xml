   <TEXT> * Re your editorial , six months after the Northridge earthquake , &quot; The Numbers Tell a Story , &quot; July 19 : The Clinton_Administration and the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) will not be satisfied that enough has been done for Northridge earthquake victims until we are satisfied that we have taken all reasonable steps to provide all_the assistance we can under the laws that govern our program . Statistics reflect the sheer magnitude of the Northridge earthquake damage , which we know was the most destructive disaster in American history . The SBA has already issued 501 # 997 disaster loan_applications , compared with a combined total of 435 # 354 for all_the major disasters in recent years : Hurricane Hugo ( 1989 ) , the Loma Prieta earthquake ( 1989 ) , the Los Angeles civil disorders ( 1992 ) , Hurricane Andrew ( 1992 ) , Hurricane Iniki ( 1992 ) , Typhoon Omar ( 1992 ) and the great Midwest floods ( 1993 ) . Similarly , the SBA has already received 211 # 598 disaster loan_applications from Northridge victims , compared with a combined total of 173 # 296 of the seven mega-disasters . I have made Northridge quake disaster assistance a priority and we have committed major resources , including more_than 3 # 200 employees , to the effort . The amount of SBA disaster loan_approvals for Northridge ( about $ 3 billion ) has surpassed the combined totals for the seven mega-disasters . With the application filing period for federal assistance still open , the Northridge response is still under way . Currently , the SBA receives more_than 1 # 000 loan requests each week and approves nearly 2 # 500 loans for more_than $ 110 million weekly . Although the editorial states that the gap between the number of applications distributed and the number completed and filed with SBA is too_large , the percent of applications filed ( the return rate ) is larger than our experience with previous disasters since we began to work with teleregistration . In Northridge , 211 # 598 , or 42.2 % , of the applications distributed have been completed and returned to SBA thus far . The average return rates for the seven major disasters cited above was 40 % . We have made considerable effort to lessen our paperwork burden for a disaster loan . We have simplified both our home and business loan_applications , and are continuing the process of trying to simplify further . We do agree that the process is discouraging because it has not always been properly explained and because of the long_time factor . We are currently addressing both of these problem . We are present in 10 emergency service centers maintained by FEMA and have 15 loan-closing centers in the area . These addresses can be received by calling our toll-free number , 1 ( 800 ) 488-5323 . This number has sufficient operators and technical personnel on call to provide answers to applicant ' s questions and status reports . We do not believe that language_barriers have been a significant factor_in disaster victims not applying for loans or completing their loan_applications . We have multilingual employees in both Los Angles and Sacramento and have made considerable use of the AT &amp; T language line service . The downturn in the economy is certainly a major factor_in disqualifying applicants who otherwise might have qualified for aid . However , we do not feel that we would be good stewards of our taxpayer dollars if we were to significantly relax our loan standards . Our loss rate since the beginning of the program now stands at 10 % and this may increase when the loans made in the past four high-volume years start to mature . Before a loan can be approved , we must determine that there is repayment ability . Our standards are considerably more liberal than those of Fannie Mae for home loans and any commercial lender for business loans . ERSKINE B . BOWLES Administrator , SBA , Washington</TEXT>
