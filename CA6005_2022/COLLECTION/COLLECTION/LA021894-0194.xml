   <HEADLINE> FIRST_LADY PROMISES MORE HELP FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday pledged increased White_House support for basic biomedical research , saying that the work of medical_scientists goes hand-in-hand with health_care reform . The benefits of medical research could be spread to a greater number of Americans through reforms in the health_care system , the First_Lady said in a speech to researchers at the National Institutes of Health . &quot; Health security not only means guaranteeing comprehensive benefits throughout a person ' s life , it also means emphasizing early diagnosis and prevention of diseases , &quot; she said . In a slap at the past two Republican administrations , she complained that biomedical research has been &quot; neglected and underfunded and even unappreciated &quot; for much of the past decade . Those conditions will be rectified by passage of President Clinton ' s 1995 budget and the Administration ' s health_care reform plan , she predicted . &quot; The work of scientists is more important than ever , &quot; she said . &quot; Without basic biomedical research , we never would have achieved the quality of health_care that most Americans enjoy. &quot; Despite an overall freeze on most domestic spending , the President ' s 1995 budget has proposed a 4.7 % funding increase for the NIH , or $ 517 million , &quot; most of it for basic research , &quot; the First_Lady said . She listed several promising areas of biomedical research that could benefit from the added funds , including AIDS , breast_cancer and the Human Genome Project , an ambitious NIH program that is attempting to map all_the genes in the body . Before her speech , Clinton met with the NIH ' s leading scientists -- who briefed her on their various programs . She also met with several AIDS patients , including three children . She also met with Ashanti DeSilva , a 7-year-old Ohio girl , who three years ago was one of the first patients in the world to receive pioneering gene therapy -- a treatment that essentially repairs or replaces a defective gene -- to cure a rare immune disorder called inherited severe immune deficiency_disease . &quot; Before her treatment , her life was one of confinement and fear , &quot; the First_Lady said in her speech . &quot; Today she is living a full life. &quot; At the White_House on Thursday , the President continued his efforts to build support among the elderly for his health_care reform proposals by meeting with leaders of senior_citizens organizations . The brunch session , following his speech Wednesday to 2 # 000 elderly citizens in New Jersey , was part of a White_House strategy to gain the backing of the nation ' s influential senior_citizens lobby . Officials from a dozen groups left the meeting promising to work_on behalf of the Clinton reform plan , although the White_House failed to get the endorsement of the powerful American Assn . of Retired People . Horace Deets , AARP ' s executive_director , said that among competing health_care proposals , Clinton ' s has the greatest chance of passage and addresses two of his group ' s minimum demands : prescription-drug coverage and expanded long-term care . But Deets said the AARP membership needs more education about the Clinton proposal before the group could make any recommendation .</TEXT>
