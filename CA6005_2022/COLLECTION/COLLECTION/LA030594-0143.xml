   <HEADLINE> CABLE TRAILERS ON BIG SCREEN DRAWING FIRE ; MOVIES : PRODUCT ADVERTISING IN THEATERS HAS BEEN AROUND FOR SOME TIME BUT , AS ONE STUDIO EXECUTIVE SAYS , ' THIS IS DIFFERENT . . . THIS IS COMPETITION. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than just &quot; The Birds &quot; has landed at Cineplex Odeon ' s theaters , which are currently playing a trailer for Showtime ' s upcoming sequel to Hitchcock ' s 1963 classic . Angry distributors are miffed about having to share screen space with competing cable movies that are being promoted along with their theatrical trailers . The major studios , which produce and distribute the movies that keep theaters operating , say they don ' t need the extra competition from TV in what they consider to be their prime advertising venue . &quot; Screen advertising has been around for a while and none of the studios really like it . But this is different . This is not some neutral product like Reebok . This is competition , &quot; says Jeff Blake , president of distribution for Columbia Pictures . An angry Barry Reardon , president of distribution at Warner Bros. , threatens that if the Showtime spot or any cable movie promo &quot; appears ( on a trailer ) on one of our pictures , we will pull the picture . And I guarantee after this article runs , Cineplex and all_the rest ( of the exhibitors ) will get the message. &quot; Reardon added that he wasn ' t the least bit surprised to learn that it was Cineplex airing Showtime ' s spots . &quot; You have to ask yourself , why would an exhibitor , a movie-related company , promote something that ' s going_to be shown on TV and not sell tickets ? Cineplex will do anything for money. &quot; That then would apply to movie trailers played by Home Box_Office , which is owned by Warners . HBO , in fact , did run a theatrical trailer for its cable movie about AIDS , &quot; And the Band Played On &quot; last August . * Reardon ' s studio competitors echoed his sentiments , including executives at Universal , which owns a 42 % interest in Cineplex ( and produced the original Hitchcock film &quot; The Birds &quot; ) . They were particularly concerned that Cineplex had not advised them that the trailer was played with &quot; The Getaway , &quot; one of Universal ' s films currently in release . Sources say movie distributors are worried that cable companies paying_for trailer time could set a precedent for studios also having to fork out money to preview their future movies . A Cineplex Odeon official says the &quot; The Birds II : Land ' s End &quot; Showtime trailer , which has been running four weeks in its 1 # 060 U.S. theaters , cost Showtime $ 140 # 000 . Howard Lichtman , Cineplex ' executive_vice_president of marketing , says : &quot; TV movies are no different to us than AT &amp; T or Frito-Lay . TV is a totally different medium and we don ' t consider it competition for theatrical features . &quot; Our main business is movies and we would n ' t do anything to hinder that , &quot; Lichtman adds . &quot; As for competition for space , we try to maximize the number of trailers we show on any film and we would never &quot; bump a feature trailer for a TV movie promo or product commercial . * Cineplex is one of the few chains to show ads in its theaters . But Showtime ' s sister company National Amusements , both of which are owned by Paramount Pictures ' new parent , Viacom Inc. , is also airing promos for the cable movie . Combined , the trailer has been running_on 2 # 100 Cineplex and National Amusement screens . &quot; The Birds II &quot; sequel begins airing on Showtime March 19 , timed to coincide with the 30th Anniversary of Hitchcock ' s original thriller . The cast includes Tippi Hedren , who appeared in the 1963 film . It centers_on a family who lost a son and decides to move their shattered lives to an East Coast island , where the oil-slick waters become the target of -- what else ? -- bird attacks . In the original , the birds attacked Bodega Bay , Calif . Showtime has also run trailers in theaters for two previous Showtime movies : John Carpenter ' s &quot; Body_Bags &quot; in August 1993 , and another Hitchcock sequel , &quot; Psycho 4 , &quot; in November 1992 . &quot; We ' ve had very positive_feedback by doing this in the past , &quot; says Mark Greenburg , Showtime ' s senior_vice_president of marketing . &quot; Having a trailer in a theater creates some excitement. &quot; Would HBO consider a theatrical trailer again for one of its cable movies ? &quot; I would n ' t rule it out , &quot; says Jim Noonan , vice_president of corporate affairs . &quot; But we would probably use it selectively , on a film that had an important message like ' And the Band Played On. ' &quot; But Turner Pictures is not on the bandwagon . While Turner seems like a natural theater fit with its newly acquired film companies Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema , &quot; the key thing holding us back is the cost , &quot; says Scot Safon , vice_president of marketing for TNT . &quot; In evaluating a smart media buy , theaters do not cover the market as well as other alternatives. &quot; &quot; For us , ' The Birds ' is a pre-sold concept , &quot; adds Showtime ' s Greenburg . &quot; What better way for us to communicate than go_to the people who made the original a success in the first place , the moviegoing audience. &quot;</TEXT>
