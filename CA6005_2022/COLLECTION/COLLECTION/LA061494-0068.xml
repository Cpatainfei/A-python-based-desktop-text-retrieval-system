   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; LEFTISTS DEEPLY SPLIT IN SALVADOR AND NICARAGUA ; AFTER YEARS OF WAR , IT ' S PEACE THAT THREATENS THE MOVEMENTS ' SURVIVAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the marathon hours of last month ' s Sandinista party convention , Daniel Ortega and Sergio Ramirez sat in the seats of honor that their long tenure as president and vice_president of Nicaragua had earned them . But the two veteran Sandinistas barely spoke_to each other . By the time the convention ended , Ortega loyalists had unceremoniously dumped Ramirez , who heads a faction of moderates , from the party leadership . An angry Ramirez stormed out of the convention hall , and his followers are considering leaving the party altogether . In El_Salvador , where 12 years of civil_war finally came_to an end and the leftist guerrillas formed a political_party , the disintegration came even more swiftly . On their first day in office last month , a group of rebels-turned-lawmakers broke_with their leaders and sided with the ruling right-wing bloc in a vote on National Assembly officers . The disobedient legislators have been suspended from their party posts , and they may eventually be expelled . Throughout the 1980s , the U.S._government spent billions of dollars through proxy armies to try to destroy the two largest leftist movements in Central_America : the Soviet-armed Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua , and El_Salvador ' s Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front , or FMLN . What the Americans failed to accomplish in war , however , now seems to be occurring in peace . The unity forged fighting a common enemy has dissolved , and the left in Central_America has entered a profound crisis , one that threatens its survival . &quot; All political forces in the region are in crisis , especially those that defined themselves in the Cold_War , &quot; said Hector Dada , a political analyst who heads a liberal think_tank in San Salvador . &quot; ( The left ) has the huge problem of having to pass from the use of weapons to conquer total power , to the use of elections , which does not give total power . How does the left define itself now ? What does_it mean to be a leftist ? These are the difficulties that are being expressed. &quot; In interviews in Managua and San Salvador , several leftist leaders argued that the internal frictions are part of a natural evolution as the parties find their way in the new_world order . Still , the often bitter and unusually public disputes have crippled the FMLN and the Sandinista Front as effective opposition forces and sowed doubts about their political futures . Both the fronts disagree on what their post-Cold War role should be . Factions within each favor moving more quickly toward the political center to modernize their organizations into forces that can win elections and run governments . Larger , opposing factions want to fight free-market economics and retain close ties to the traditional rank-and-file . The more centrist factions accuse their opponents of remaining mired in their authoritarian past , and the opponents in turn accuse the centrists of betraying their parties ' revolutionary ideals . &quot; Today , in the ( Sandinista Front ) as well as in the FMLN , we are living a new period of ideological and political struggle , caused by our setbacks , failings and errors , and also by the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet_Union , &quot; Schafik Handal , secretary_general of the FMLN and head of the Salvadoran Communist_Party , told the Sandinista convention delegates in a keynote_address . &quot; We are all_in the same crisis of searching and debate. &quot; Both the Sandinista Front and the FMLN formed in the 1970s as a union of a variety of forces . The Sandinista Front combined three basic tendencies , each with a different view on how to conduct revolution , but they eventually achieved a seemingly monolithic unity after ousting the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979 . The Sandinistas ruled Nicaragua , while fighting U.S.-backed Contra rebels , throughout the 1980s , until finally losing elections in 1990 to conservatives led by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro . At the behest of Cuban leader Fidel Castro , meanwhile , five leftist military-political organizations in El_Salvador joined forces to become the FMLN and wage war on a series of U.S.-backed governments . Unlike the Sandinista Front , the five factions of the FMLN maintained their distinct identities during the war . They ran separate clandestine radio_stations and controlled separate pieces of territory . As a result , many observers now see a split within the FMLN as inevitable , though few of them are ready to predict an immediate , formal division . The fall of communism and the Soviet Empire -- traditional backers of the FMLN and Sandinista Front -- suddenly forced both groups to re-examine the backbone of their movements . The disarray of the left has different consequences in each country . In Nicaragua , a divided Sandinista Front could clear the way for a far-right candidate to win presidential elections in 1996 . A fragmented FMLN means that there will be few checks and balances in El_Salvador on right-wing President Armando Calderon Sol . The simmering discord within the Sandinista Front , which first became obvious after the Sandinistas ' 1990 electoral loss , bubbled_over in the weeks leading_up to the party ' s second-ever convention last month . Former Vice_President Ramirez and his supporters held press_conferences that the radio_stations -- controlled by ex-President Ortega and his supporters -- refused to cover . The two factions traded insults : Ramirez and the moderates were accused of being pro-Yankee sellouts ; Ortega and the hard-liners were labeled intransigent Stalinists . Ultimately , Ortega ' s faction won out -- and won big . He was reelected as secretary_general of the party , a post he has held for 15 years , and his allies received enough votes to dominate the 15-member National Directorate , or executive_council . With his victory , Ortega is a likely candidate for president in 1996 , even though opinion polls have shown Ramirez to be the Sandinista who most appeals_to the general public . If the party splits , however , the chance for victory in the elections seems even more remote . Critics saw the results of the convention as a step to the hard left that allows little space for reformers . The convention delegates , for example , voted to stick_with the party anthem , which refers to Americans -- el yanqui -- as the &quot; enemies of humanity. &quot; &quot; There are ( members of the party ) who still think it ' s July 19 , 1979 , &quot; Ramirez said , referring to the date Sandinistas marched triumphantly into Managua after the insurrection . Ortega insisted that he is open_to new ideas but pointed_out that his election was the product of a &quot; democratic process &quot; that should be respected . The dissident Sandinistas say they want to create a form of Sandinismo that is more democratic and flexible and that can attract the thousands of supporters who have abandoned the party out of disgust with corruption . Many Sandinista militants became disenchanted in 1990 after the party and Ortega lost the election and their leaders proceeded to make off with businesses , homes and properties that had been confiscated by the Sandinista government . The episode became known as La Pinata . ) &quot; We have to show the dissatisfied that there is another Sandinismo , &quot; longtime party activist and political_scientist Silvio Prado said . &quot; We have to have a new relationship within the Front that is not submission and direction but cooperation . . . . If not , the party will get weaker and weaker by the day , until it disappears. &quot; In El_Salvador , conflicts among the FMLN leaders were legendary , and they have become increasingly public since the U.N.-brokered peace accords . Joaquin Villalobos , the guerrillas ' most successful military strategist , leads one faction , while Handal and the largest group within the FMLN , the Popular Liberation Forces , generally fall on the other side . Participating in democratic elections for the first time last March , the FMLN won a handful of municipal posts and 21 seats in the legislative National Assembly . It was_on May 1 , the day that the new legislators were sworn_in , that the most recent conflict exploded . The right-wing politicians who dominate the National Assembly had made changes in rules governing the officers of the assembly , enhancing the right ' s power . Handal said the FMLN agreed to protest by refusing to vote for National Assembly officers during inauguration of the congress . But , to the surprise of many , seven FMLN legislators broke ranks and voted for the new officers , including several from the right . FMLN legislators Ana Guadalupe Martinez and Eduardo Sancho , who were among those who chose to vote , were also voted_in as officers . A furious Handal immediately announced that the seven dissident legislators , plus accused ringleader Villalobos , no longer represented the FMLN and had been suspended from their party leadership positions . They could face expulsion later this month . &quot; Let it be clear , &quot; the bearded Handal intoned , &quot; they do not represent us. &quot; In a flurry of television appearances , the chastised legislators responded that they were voting their convictions , and in a pluralistic political organization they should be allowed to do so . &quot; You have to ask the question , which is more important : mechanical unity , or a new identity that makes you electable ? &quot; Villalobos said . &quot; In El_Salvador , all_the powers are transforming . The right is changing , the army is changing , relations with the United States are changing . . . . If the left does not change , all_of the other powers will consolidate , and the left will be left_out of the picture. &quot;</TEXT>
