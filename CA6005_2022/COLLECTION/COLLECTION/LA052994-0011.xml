   <HEADLINE> THEATER ; ON THE WINGS OF ' ANGELS ' ; STEPHEN SPINELLA HAS VAULTED FROM OBSCURITY TO WIDESPREAD ACCLAIM , ONE TONY AND NOW ANOTHER NOMINATION FOR HIS FRIGHTENINGLY REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF AIDS-RAVAGED PRIOR WALTER IN THE TWO-PART EPIC ' ANGELS IN AMERICA '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most actors , it ' s the sound of applause and laughter rippling through the audience that is the most gratifying . But for Stephen Spinella , it ' s the sound of gasps . The 37-year-old actor certainly incites his share of them as Prior Walter , the addled and flamboyant scion and reluctant prophet who is at the heart of &quot; Angels in America , &quot; Tony Kushner ' s two-part epic about gays , AIDS and Reaganism . The first murmurs of astonishment usually come from the Broadway audiences near the beginning of Part 1 , &quot; Millennium Approaches , &quot; when a naked Spinella , his skinny body covered with lesions , cowers and screams in terror . Another shock_wave hits the audience early in Part 2 , &quot; Perestroika , &quot; when after tearing around the stage at full tilt , the ailing Prior falls backward in a dead faint . &quot; I can hear the gasps and then they ' re completely quiet , &quot; Spinella says . &quot; They think it ' s some horrible mistake . Or that something truly horrible has happened . Which is where you want them. &quot; Horrible things , of course , do happen in &quot; Angels in America. &quot; But that horror is as often as not followed by something funny , provocative , malevolent or surreal . Prior is the lodestar for the play ' s amazing emotional journey , and the shy Spinella has emerged from relative obscurity to share_in the honors that have been heaped on the hit drama . &quot; Angels in America &quot; is divided into two 3 1 / 2-hour plays -- Part 1 , &quot; Millennium Approaches , &quot; opened on Broadway in May , 1993 ; &quot; Perestroika &quot; followed in November and has been playing in repertory with &quot; Millennium &quot; at the Walter Kerr Theatre . The Broadway shows followed productions of both parts in Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum in late 1992 , and &quot; Millennium Approaches &quot; was also seen in London earlier that year . A year ago , when &quot; Millennium &quot; swept the Tonys -- taking , among its four awards , one for best play -- Spinella took_home the trophy for best featured actor in a drama . Now , with &quot; Perestroika &quot; again leading the Tony nominees for drama with six nominations , Spinella is up for best performance by a leading actor in a play . The change in category recognizes his role in Part 2 as more pivotal to the story line . Whether he will prevail again when the awards are announced June 12 remains to be seen . He ' s got stiff competition : Sam Waterston ( &quot; Abe Lincoln in Illinois &quot; ) , Christopher Plummer ( &quot; No Man ' s Land &quot; ) and Brian Bedford ( &quot; Timon of Athens &quot; ) . But whatever the outcome , Spinella says that he ' s bound to enjoy this year ' s competition a lot more_than last year . &quot; I was a wreck last year , &quot; he says of the sudden onslaught of fame that greeted him as part of the eight-member cast of &quot; Angels. &quot; &quot; Everything happened so fast . This time , whether I win or not , I ' m just much more confident about my situation . I ' m going_to savor every_last minute of it. &quot; If Spinella was not exactly comfortable with Broadway then , the New York audiences nonetheless cottoned to him in a big way . Few characters in recent theater history have generated as much empathy and affection as Prior , a waiter and former drag queen . Abandoned by his lover , he spends much of &quot; Millennium Approaches &quot; coping_with the debilitating effects of AIDS while warding_off the persistent visitations of a pushy angel . &quot; Perestroika &quot; sees him going sparring with the heavenly principalities and raging around the stage looking_like , as one character notes , Morticia Addams . * Spinella is a close friend of playwright Kushner , who wrote the role with the actor in mind . He began playing Prior in 1989 in readings at San Francisco ' s Eureka Theatre , which commissioned the piece , and he was in the first workshop production of &quot; Millennium &quot; at the Taper in May , 1990 . Spinella also played Prior in the seven-hour marathon of &quot; Angels &quot; there in 1992 . &quot; There ' s something kind of frail about him , &quot; he says of the character ' s appeal . &quot; You think he ' s going_to crumble . And he does . But then he puts himself back together as a much stronger person . There ' s something exhilarating about somebody who ' s at the bottom and fights_back -- through humor as much as rage. &quot; Indeed , Spinella has been so successful in communicating the mesmerizing and horrific world of AIDS to audiences that he has become a poster child of sorts -- an image reinforced by a cameo as a dying man with AIDS in the HBO television movie &quot; And the Band Played On. &quot; Offstage , he is often besieged by people inquiring after his health or sending heartfelt notes such_as one scrawled on the back of a ticket_stub that he keeps taped to his dressing room mirror : &quot; Doug very much wanted to be here . He died of AIDS on Jan . 19 , 1993 . Thank you. &quot; Part of the audience ' s proprietary attitude toward Spinella stems from the fact that he has a very slender build , which onstage makes him appear emaciated . Audiences have often speculated as_to the real state of his health . Nothing to be alarmed about . Much of the frailty is makeup . * Sitting in his dressing room , having just returned from a vacation in Florida , Spinella exudes health and well-being . As part of a campaign to put pounds on his bony frame , he ' s hired a personal trainer . A large bunch of bananas sits amid dried flowers , family photos , pictures of angels and other memorabilia cluttering his dressing_room . The room has been painted a color he calls &quot; dusty rose , &quot; and the fluty-voiced reference_to his interior-decorating skills is a rare flash of Prior flamboyance . For the most part , his demeanor is serious , almost somber . Dressed conservatively in khakis and a striped shirt , he chooses his words carefully , punctuating them with long pauses . The actor , a onetime gay activist , reluctantly reveals that he is HIV- negative -- ( &quot; I don ' t believe the community should be divided by those who are positive and those who are negative , &quot; he says ) -- but he adds that audiences continue to confuse him with the character . &quot; I don ' t really care , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' d play another PWA ( person with AIDS ) in a second if the role was a good one . I really don ' t have a problem leaving the role after I leave the theater . It doesn ' t persist . But some people can be extremely rude . They come_up_to me and think they can say stuff like ' You ' re so skinny , ' ' You should eat more ! ' It ' s just unbelievably rude. &quot; After more_than 400 Broadway performances , Spinella concedes that summoning up Prior ' s febrile exchanges with freshness and spontaneity has been a real challenge of late . The demands , particularly in &quot; Perestroika , &quot; are so physically and emotionally exhausting that Spinella says he had no intention of renewing his contract when it expired in January . Yet the producers prevailed on him to stay_on through September . Persuading him wasn ' t that hard , actually . Despite the acclaim for his performance in &quot; Angels , &quot; other offers haven ' t exactly poured in . Aside from the role of a gay parent in Michael Tolkin ' s forthcoming movie , &quot; The New Age , &quot; which he had to turn_down because of scheduling , Spinella says he had no other offers . He auditioned for the role of a drag queen in the road movie &quot; To Wong Foo , Thanks for Everything , Julie Newmar &quot; -- a part that eventually went_to Patrick Swayze . Even so , Spinella says , he was eager to explore the possibilities of doing film and more TV at the time his contract came_up for renewal . &quot; But then I realized I really wanted to understand the part better , especially in ' Perestroika , ' which I hadn ' t had the chance to play that long , &quot; he says . &quot; When you have a role as well written as this one , you constantly discover new wells of inspiration . It can even get_to be a pretty desperate search after a while . You think , ' Ohmygod , I ' m not deep enough , not honest enough , not funny enough. ' It can be a humbling experience. &quot; * Spinella says that he has had to plumb his own background and personal life for the compass_points that intersect with Prior ' s . Unlike the well-born character he plays , Spinella forged his own survival skills in Arizona . His father , a Navy mechanic , moved the large brood after the end of a tour_of_duty in Italy , where Stephen , the middle son , was born . The close-knit family endured a shock when Stephen ' s father died_unexpectedly of a heart_attack . Though he was only 13 at the time , Spinella soon found himself the head of the household when his older brother and sister moved away to college . Meanwhile , he was coming_to grips with his own sexuality . &quot; I can ' t really differentiate between what were the traumas of the situation of my family and the traumas about being terrified of my sexuality , &quot; he says . &quot; They all get mixed_up together. &quot; Spinella found a refuge from both in the high_school drama club . Alan D . Perry , who heads one of the many producing entities of &quot; Angels in America , &quot; knew the aspiring actor at Glendale High_School near Phoenix and remembered him as someone who was clearly going places , even then . &quot; My memory of him was as always being incredibly inventive and always the most interesting person to watch , &quot; Perry says . &quot; We lived_in a desert community and had that artistic insecurity that comes from living_in a place where the seasons don ' t change . I remember once at a friend ' s house , where we all gathered on Friday evenings to watch ' Mary Hartman , ' we announced to the group that we were no longer going_to meet any more boring people . Only writers , artists and dancers . They looked_at us like we were insane. &quot; Despite Spinella ' s many years working in fringe theater before &quot; Angels , &quot; Broadway had long been a goal . The actor says that he even moved from Arizona to New York in 1978 to attend the graduate acting program at New York University , because , as he put it , &quot; I ' d be one step closer to actually being_on Broadway. &quot; It worked . He met Kushner . After seeing Spinella in a university production , Kushner , then a first-year directing student , invited him to be in his play &quot; The Age of Assassins , &quot; a four-hour political saga about American anarchists at the turn_of_the_century . &quot; I started writing roles for Stephen because the first time I saw him I knew he was a truly great actor , &quot; Kushner says . &quot; He has immense emotional depth , great range and an extraordinarily facility for stylized language . He really knows how to do my stuff. &quot; Spinella characterizes many of the roles Kushner has written for him as &quot; fierce and angry men. &quot; Those have included a curmudgeonly amateur scientist and archeologist in &quot; Hydriotaphia , &quot; an irascible early capitalist in &quot; Heavenly Theatre , &quot; a leering cleric in &quot; La Fin de la Baleine &quot; and the gay intellectual in an early production of Kushner ' s previously best-known work , &quot; A Bright Room Called Day. &quot; * In fact , the nadir of Spinella ' s career was when Kushner received his first major New York production with &quot; A Bright Room Called Day &quot; at the Public Theatre in 1990 , and Spinella wasn ' t invited to come_along . The director , Michael Greif ( who has since become artistic director at the La Jolla Playhouse ) , refused to cast him . &quot; I was completely devastated . I was really very , very upset , &quot; Spinella recalls . &quot; I had contributed a lot to that part , and Tony worked very hard to get me into that production . Michael simply thought another actor would be better. &quot; Spinella ' s crisis of confidence almost led him to pull_out of the inaugural workshop production of &quot; Angels in America. &quot; &quot; I just thought this is the way it ' s going_to be for the rest of my life , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m going_to be doing the plays in the small theaters for not much money , and when it comes_to New York , it ' s going_to go_to somebody else. &quot; But Spinella persevered , buoyed by Kushner ' s guarantee that he would be a part of &quot; Angels &quot; no matter where it was produced . Through the various readings and workshops , the actor put his personal stamp on Prior -- so_much so that now it ' s hard to imagine anyone else in the role , either on Broadway or in Robert Altman ' s upcoming films of &quot; Angels in America. &quot; There will be a movie for each part , produced by Fine Line Features , with production now scheduled for next spring . Anxious not to jinx his chances to land the film role , Spinella declines to comment on the Altman production except to say , nervously , that his fingers are crossed . Meanwhile , the actor continues to live_in the modest East Village apartment he ' s had for 15 years . He recently separated from his lover of the past four years , a result , he says , of &quot; two strong-headed people who have different ideas of where they want to live their lives. &quot; These days , Spinella ' s life appears to be equal parts monasticism and glamour : the monkish existence of playing eight performances at such a high_pitch that long telephone_conversations are out_of_the_question , next to the experience of meeting such idols as Diana Ross , whom he told : &quot; I ' ve got a recording of every sound you ' ve ever made. &quot; As for the life and career he envisions for himself after &quot; Angels , &quot; Spinella will only say : &quot; The next play I want to do is one that lasts 90 minutes , is all jokes , one costume , one set and very , very easy . No gasps , no groans , just lots of laughter -- Please ! &quot; *</TEXT>
