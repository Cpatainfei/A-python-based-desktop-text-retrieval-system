   <HEADLINE> POP_MUSIC REVIEW ; FOGERTY SHOWS HIS CREEDENCE CREDENTIALS ; A 90-MINUTE BENEFIT PERFORMANCE AT THE HOUSE OF BLUES INCLUDES MANY OF THE OLD SONGS , VITALLY RENDERED BY A TRUE ROCKER IN HIS FIRST FORMAL CONCERT IN EIGHT YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Organizers of the &quot; Emergency Blues &quot; benefit_concert on Tuesday at the House of Blues had fun placing estimated values on some of the items at their silent auction . Hey , the money ' s for charity , so why not declare as &quot; priceless &quot; an autographed Mickey Mantle baseball_cap or signed Ringo Starr drum skins ? Even if we ' re just talking three- or four-figure bids here . But even Sting would have to chuckle if he saw his Tiffany key chain listed as priceless -- and a concert-goer did laugh out loud when he saw an autographed T-shirt from Traffic , the tour bomb of the year , in that category . There was no denying , however , that the evening ' s music had a priceless quality : the first formal concert performance in eight years by John Fogerty , the former leader of Creedence Clearwater Revival and one of the greats of American rock . Fogerty , who ' ll be 50 next year , has only made about half_a_dozen stage appearances since his 1986 solo tour , but they were short sets , no more_than three or four songs -- as at the 1993 ceremony in which Creedence was inducted into the Rock_and_Roll Hall_of_Fame . By contrast , Fogerty and a three-piece band spent almost 90 minutes on stage Tuesday . Most of the time was devoted to Creedence-era songs , many of which he hadn ' t played since the group broke_up in 1972 . Looking eager and trim in black shirt and jeans , Fogerty opened with a tip of the hat to Creedence ' s early days and roots by playing &quot; Suzie Q &quot; and &quot; I Put a Spell on You &quot; -- ' 50s rock hits that Creedence reprised on its 1968 debut album . But it was Fogerty ' s songs that established Creedence as one of the premier groups in rock history -- songs , from &quot; Bad Moon Rising &quot; and &quot; Fortunate Son &quot; to &quot; Green_River &quot; and &quot; Who ' ll Stop the Rain , &quot; that combined sometimes biting social observation with the energy and economy of ' 50s rock . Watching Fogerty play guitar and sing with such authority Tuesday , it was hard to believe that he has been away from the rock arena for even a_few weeks . Rock ' n ' roll seems to run_through the man ' s veins -- 100 % . And the vitality of the music was mirrored in the celebration of the evening itself . In the spirit of that great American philosopher of the moment James Carville , it ' s the music , stupid . True enough : It ' s the quality of the songs , fundamentally , that stands as the measure of most artists . Our appreciation of those songs , however , can be enhanced or lessened by the actions of the performer or the setting in which we hear them . Nothing sounds more hollow than social protest by someone whose own behavior suggests compromise or corruption . At the same time , few factors highlight the liberating qualities of rock ' n ' roll music as much as benefits . That was evident at the Greek Theatre on Monday when Elton John began a four-night engagement that will raise an estimated $ 750 # 000 for the Elton John AIDS Foundation . Although many of the songs John sang during the evening have been bigger hits for him , the most moving moment was John ' s version of &quot; The Last Song , &quot; a tune he wrote in 1992 with lyricist Bernie Taupin about a father ' s coming_to terms with a son who is dying of AIDS . At the end of the number , John bowed his head softly , as if in silent prayer -- a gentle punctuation_mark that summarized the often lonely and heroic struggles surrounding AIDS . Similarly , Fogerty ' s spirited performance at the House of Blues mirrored the optimism and determination of the half-dozen women who organized the event . The show and auction raised more_than $ 200 # 000 for Jamie Belmont , a Toluca Lake woman who underwent a recent bone_marrow transplant , and Stop Cancer , a Los Angeles organization that awards research grants . Although Bruce Springsteen and Paul Rodgers came_out to join Fogerty on the night ' s closing number , the emotional peak came earlier with a blistering version of &quot; Fortunate Son. &quot; Fogerty wrote it during the Vietnam_War as a working-class attack on the way politicians and the wealthy were often able to wave the flag while getting their own children excused from battle . Today , it stands equally as a testimony to the power of the individual to get things done , including , on this night , the kind of grass roots benefit efforts reflected in &quot; Emergency Blues. &quot; In this humanitarian setting , the pricelessness of Fogerty ' s art was underscored all_the more dramatically .</TEXT>
