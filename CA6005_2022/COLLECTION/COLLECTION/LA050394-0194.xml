   <HEADLINE> KEVORKIAN IS ACQUITTED FOR ROLE IN SUICIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jack Kevorkian was acquitted Monday in the first jury test of Michigan ' s assisted-suicide ban by a panel that decided the law allows attempts to relieve pain and suffering . In the wake of the verdict , Wayne County Prosecuting Atty . John D . O ' Hair said he does not intend to prosecute any more alleged violations of the law , at least until the state Court of Appeals or the Legislature provide further guidance . The appeals court is reviewing the ban , which expires in November . The Legislature is supposed to consider how to address the assisted-suicide issue by then . The jury started its deliberations Thursday by holding hands and standing to pray , members said Monday . Then the nine women and three men cried , argued bitterly and traded stories about their own experiences with the terminally ill . After 9 1 / 2 hours over three days they finally agreed that Kevorkian ' s only motive in helping 30-year-old Thomas Hyde kill himself last August was to ease the young_man ' s battle with amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis , a degenerative nerve disorder , which is also known as Lou Gehrig ' s disease . &quot; The decision in the Hyde case is a decision that the Legislature cannot ignore , &quot; said O ' Hair . The prosecutor has been a vocal member of a citizens commission advising the Legislature . He has proposed allowing physician-assisted suicide under strict conditions . O ' Hair said he brought charges against Kevorkian , 65 , &quot; because I do believe that the law should be respected and honored. &quot; He added : &quot; It ' s going_to be difficult to obtain convictions in these extreme cases . Those who feel strongly opposed to decriminalization should really take_note that you ' re still going_to have an assisted suicide that is condoned. &quot; With the current confusion , he said , he would only bring a case involving &quot; patent abuse. &quot; Kevorkian , who has attended 20 suicides since 1990 -- five since the ban took_effect last year -- said he expects physicians now to step_forward and publicly support assisted suicide and help him set guidelines for the practice . He would not rule_out helping to end another life in the meantime . Kevorkian ' s attorney , Geoffrey N . Fieger , said the verdict &quot; drives a stake through ( the ban ' s ) heart. &quot; Three other trial_judges have dismissed similar charges against Kevorkian , holding the ban unconstitutional . Kevorkian is collecting signatures for a statewide ballot measure to guarantee constitutionally the right to assist the ending of intolerable pain by ending life . Nevertheless , prosecutors and jurors alike pleaded for a clear policy from the state ' s judicial and political_leaders . &quot; You ' ve got a Court of Appeals that ' s been sitting on this case for four months , &quot; said Timothy Kenny , who prosecuted the case . &quot; Let somebody else decide . It ' s not for me , &quot; said juror Gail Donaldson , a 42-year-old visiting nurse who said she believes suicide is wrong but that a loophole in the law as written permitted Kevorkian to act . She and the others accepted Fieger ' s interpretation of a subsection in the statute that the ban does not apply when medication or procedures are administered &quot; to relieve pain and suffering and not to cause death &quot; -- even if the death may be hastened . Kenny argued that the wording was intended to protect doctors prescribing experimental drugs or methods . In a statement from Washington , the National Right_to_Life Committee condemned the verdict . &quot; There are many disabled and terminally ill people who may now be coerced into using assisted suicide , &quot; said Rhonda Franz , committee president . &quot; Instead , society should offer them alternatives to suicide to show them we value their lives. &quot; During five days of testimony , Hyde ' s brother and fiancee described the toll that the disease had taken_on the former landscaper and construction worker . Emotions peaked when Hyde appeared on videotape , recorded during his first counseling session with Kevorkian 34 days before his death . Hyde could barely swallow . His left arm hung useless and he struggled to move his right . He smiled and grimaced involuntarily . He spent minutes choking out a phrase . &quot; I want to end it , &quot; he finally was able to explain . &quot; I want to die. &quot; At least three jurors wept openly . The electrician who would be elected jury foreman shielded his face with his hands . &quot; It brought_back memories , &quot; said Donaldson , who cared_for a dying sister and father . In closing arguments , Fieger asked the jury : &quot; What kind of people are we that we would treat Thomas Hyde worse than a pet . . . that we would say to Thomas Hyde : ' You must choke to death on_your_own spit ? ' &quot; In the beginning , however , he also tried a surprise gambit , announcing that Hyde did not die on the island park in Detroit , where Kevorkian surrendered to police , but in a parking_lot behind Kevorkian ' s apartment in neighboring Oakland County . Hyde had inhaled carbon_monoxide from a canister while lying on a mattress in the back of a van . Detroit Recorder ' s Court Judge Thomas E . Jackson instructed jurors to acquit Kevorkian if the prosecutor had not proved Hyde had died in Wayne County . If geography had been the pivotal reason for the acquittal , O ' Hair said , &quot; this decision would have been meaningless. &quot; Kevorkian himself was unhappy with the tactic . &quot; Do you think I didn ' t want to confront this travesty of a law ? &quot; he snapped during a break_in the trial . Location was much discussed but not a serious factor_in the decision , three jurors said in courtroom interviews after the verdict . &quot; It came_down to the way the law was worded , &quot; Gwen Bryson , 51 , said . One holdout wanted to convict Kevorkian until the jury asked_for a copy of the law and went_over its language , Donaldson said . Bryson said she thought the jury ' s makeup -- five were employed in nursing-related occupations -- helped determine the outcome . She is a certified nursing assistant and often works with elderly patients . &quot; You see a lot of suffering , &quot; she said . Times staff writer Stephen Braun contributed to this story from Chicago .</TEXT>
