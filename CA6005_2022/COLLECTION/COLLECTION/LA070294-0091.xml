   <HEADLINE> WOMAN IS CONVICTED OF PLOTTING 2 MURDERS ; CRIME : MARY ELLEN SAMUELS , DUBBED ' GREEN WIDOW ' FOR HER LAVISH SPENDING HABITS , COULD RECEIVE DEATH_PENALTY FOR ARRANGING SLAYINGS OF HER HUSBAND AND HIS KILLER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mary Ellen Samuels , dubbed the &quot; green widow &quot; because she spent the $ 500 # 000 she inherited from her slain husband at a dizzying pace , was convicted Friday of two counts of first-degree murder for arranging his death and that of his executioner seven months later . Samuels , who had denied from the witness_stand that she was involved in either killing , leaned heavily against defense_attorney Phil Nameth but showed no other visible reaction as the jury returned the verdicts , reached after 18 days of deliberations . But the investigating officer , who spent the final years of his career building the case against Samuels , broke_down and cried . Sitting just a_few feet away from the defendant , her former sister-in-law Susan Conroy also wept . &quot; You know what people say about black_widows ? Well , she ' s a green widow . It ' s the same thing as a black_widow , which eats its mate when he ' s no longer useful to her , &quot; retired Los Angeles Police Detective George Daley said . &quot; She was a very cunning predator , &quot; he added . The jury is to return to court July 11 to determine whether Samuels , 45 , should receive the death_penalty or receive a sentence of life in prison for the murders of Robert Samuels , 45 , a Hollywood camera operator ' s assistant , and James R . Bernstein , 27 , a reputed drug dealer . Besides the murder_convictions -- which included the special circumstances of multiple killings and murder for financial_gain -- the jury convicted Samuels of two counts of conspiracy and two counts of solicitation of murder . During the lengthy trial , which unfolded like a pulp novel , Deputy Dist . Atty . Jan Maurizi alleged that Samuels plotted to have her estranged husband killed when she realized &quot; he was worth more to her dead than alive. &quot; As a divorcee , Samuels would have received a settlement of about $ 30 # 000 . But as a widow , she inherited $ 500 # 000 . She spent nearly all_the money during the 13 months she was under investigation -- on a Porsche , a Cancun condo , a country_club birthday bash , rented limousines , fake fur_coats , trips to Las Vegas , and custom-made outfits from a store called Trashy Lingerie . Yet she did not pay_for her husband ' s headstone , defaulted_on her mortgage , and failed to pay debts rung_up by the family ' s Sherman Oaks sandwich shop , according to testimony . Many of the prosecution witnesses once were among Samuels ' closest confidantes . They described Samuels ' search for a hit_man and several botched attempts on her husband ' s life . Some of the former friends testified under grants of immunity from prosecution for their roles in the murder schemes . Her attorney suggested that Samuels was framed by an overzealous police_detective and &quot; fair-weather friends &quot; who accused her to spare themselves from prosecution for their roles in the murders . Robert Samuels , who worked_on the films &quot; Lethal Weapon &quot; and &quot; Heaven Can Wait , &quot; was ambushed in his Northridge home on Dec . 8 , 1988 , by an intruder who hit him over the head , then shot him with a 16-gauge shotgun , firing through a pillow . Samuels and her daughter , Nicole , then 18 , who were living_in Reseda at the time , told police they discovered the body when they dropped_off a pet schnauzer for the weekend . Bernstein , who carried a business_card identifying himself as a &quot; specialist , &quot; was strangled on June 27 , 1989 , and his body was dumped in Lockwood Canyon in Ventura County . According to testimony , the killers drove Samuels ' black Toyota Celica convertible . The letters on the car ' s vanity tags were NAST VXN for &quot; nasty vixen , &quot; authorities said . The confessed killers , Paul Edwin Gaul and Darrell Ray Edwards , testified for the prosecution under plea bargains . Both pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and received sentences of 15 years to life in prison . Gaul testified that he drank 30 to 40 beers the day they killed Bernstein . The witnesses painted an unflattering portrait of Samuels , describing her as a crass woman who hired male strippers for her daughter ' s 18th birthday and flirted_with police the night she discovered her husband ' s body . &quot; I like bald guys , &quot; she told one detective , rubbing his hairless head , according to testimony . Later , she was not so friendly toward police . Several witnesses testified that she taught a pet parrot to say profane things about the now retired detective , Daley .</TEXT>
