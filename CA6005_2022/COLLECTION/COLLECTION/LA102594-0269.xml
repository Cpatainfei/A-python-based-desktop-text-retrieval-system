   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY LEGENDS FROM ... A TO Z ; LETTER BY LETTER , A LIST OF AREA MOVERS , SHAKERS AND GAME BREAKERS WHO HAVE LEFT MORE THAN THEIR MARKS OF DISTINCTION ON HIGH_SCHOOL SPORTS IN O.C. -- AND BEYOND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Get ready to argue . You can call it entertainment , you can call it enlightenment , or you can call us idiots for trying to put something like this together , but we ' re feeling like Tarzan and want to climb out on a limb . We just had to put it together : Orange County ' s prep legends from A to Z . Not an easy task , but our staff is a talented group -- or at least an aged one -- with more_than 200 years of collective experience . We put our heads together and came_up with a list that was as comprehensive as we could make_it . How comprehensive was it ? There were more_than 150 wrestlers . No one can accuse us of not considering all_the options . Then we whittled it down , one legendary graduate for each letter_of_the_alphabet . Still , we couldn ' t find a true X . But that was the least of our problems . Our criteria ? We were looking_for the intangible stuff of legend : those high_school athletes who will be remembered years from now for their role in the evolution of sports in Orange County . We looked_at what they did_in high_school and beyond , and the legacy they left . Sometimes it was easy , and sometimes it created heated discussion in the newsroom . The names that don ' t make the list are sure to cause a stir , maybe even a nasty letter or two . But we don ' t mind . Rob Johnson , the starting quarterback at USC , isn ' t on the list . Well , because the Js are heavy and Rob joins that impressive J list that includes his brother Bret , Alison Johnsen , Randy Jones , Dan Jorgensen and Amy Jalewalia . Playmaker Nicole Erickson ' s legend is_well known , having led Brea-Olinda to four consecutive State girls ' basketball titles and a 130-5 record , but she ' s not on the list , either . If only her last_name was Smith or Thompson . OK , Mark Wulfemeyer set an Orange County career scoring record in basketball at Troy . Tim Wallach was an all-star third_baseman . Tes Whitlock scored 68 points in a basketball_game . Myron White is one of the greatest rushers in county history . Mike Witt went_on to pitch a perfect_game for the Angels . Santa Ana diver Bob Webster won Olympic platform gold medals in 1960 and ' 64 . Todd White held the national high_school mile record ( 4:20.0 ) for one week in 1955 . But they didn ' t make the list . Sure , there will be some discontent here . Tony Gonzalez isn ' t the best G-man you ' ve ever seen on a football_field and basketball_court ? Of course he is . And what about Brian Goodell , the Mission Viejo senior named world swimmer of the year in 1977 ? Well , Goodell also is a no-show . They were aced out by one of the best softball pitchers in the world . It ' s a comparison of apples and oranges . We aren ' t saying this is the definitive list . But it ' s our list . And if you can do_better , well , bring it on . * A . Rick Aberegg was a 5-foot-10 point guard at Katella who averaged 27.5 points his senior season in 1970 . A year earlier , concentrating_on assists rather than scoring , Aberegg helped the Knights reach the Southern Section 2-A title game ; Katella lost , 90-87 , to Los Angeles Verbum Dei as the two teams set a record for most points in a championship game that stood until 1992 . * B . Shirley Babashoff first won Southern Section championships for Fountain Valley in 1972 and ' 73 when Title IX created athletic opportunities for high_school girls . Babashoff anchored gold medal-winning 400-meter freestyle relay teams in the 1972 and ' 76 Olympics and finished with six silver medals culled from the 100 , 200 , 400 and 800 freestyle events . At a time when the sport was dominated by East_Germans , Babashoff was the best female swimmer in the world not on steroids . * C . Gary Carter didn ' t specialize in any sport at Sunny Hills , but excelled in three -- and received college scholarship offers for football , in which he was a high_school All-American , basketball and baseball . He was going_to play quarterback and catcher at UCLA , but decided to pursue professional_baseball because of an earlier knee injury . He signed with Montreal after his 1972 graduation ; three years later , he was an Expo starter . He played 19 years , was an all-star 11 times and won three Gold Gloves . * D . When the subject is female distance runners , 1976 Orange High graduate Mary Decker immediately comes_to_mind . She was competing at the international level while in high_school and eventually set the U.S. record in the mile . But her legacy is one of Olympic disappointment and controversy . * E . It must have been some piece_of_work , the Janet Evans essay , &quot; What I did over my summer vacation. &quot; She already had won consecutive 200-yard individual medley and three consecutive 500 freestyle Southern Section swimming titles for El Dorado , but those were strictly small potatoes on her grand scale . The summer before her senior year , she went_to Seoul and won three Olympic gold medals in 1988 . East_German competitor Heike Friedrich said , &quot; Janet Evans is a different dimension. &quot; At one point , Evans held three world_records . She returned to school and competed her senior season , setting national high_school records in the 200 IM ( 1:59.96 ) and 500 free ( 4:37.30 ) . Millions of dollars in endorsement offers came her way . She turned them all down so she could maintain her NCAA eligibility and swim at Stanford . &quot; I ' m 17 , &quot; she said . &quot; I want to be a kid awhile longer. &quot; * F . Mickey Flynn ' s life was a Hollywood B movie , the one that takes_place in the 1950s and everyone in town knows the local football hero . Flynn , who scored 55 touchdowns for Anaheim from 1954 to ' 56 , could enter any restaurant and his meal would be taken_care of . The first big prep star in Orange County history , he was called &quot; The Ghost of La Palma Park &quot; because the lights were so bad at Glover Stadium , Flynn would disappear into the night on his long_runs , such_as the 95-yarder the first time he carried a football . He averaged 13.8 yards per carry in a three-year career that reached its zenith in front of 41 # 383 in a 13-13 championship game against Downey and Flynn ' s so-called &quot; Touchdown Twin , &quot; Randy Meadows ; Flynn rushed 17 times for 134 yards and two touchdowns . The two rivals were in the same backfield a_few months later at the Shrine All-Star game -- and 85 # 931 came_out to watch it . * G . Michele Granger ' s 75 m.p.h. fastball helped make her the world ' s best pitcher while still in high_school ; because of her dominance , coaches changed the way they taught hitting and the slap bunt became an everyday weapon . The left-hander was the U.S. Olympic Committee ' s softball player of the year in 1986 and ' 87 while still at Valencia ; she graduated in 1988 with national prep records for strikeouts in a career ( 1 # 687 ) and season ( 509 ) , consecutive strikeouts ( 21 ) , career no-hitters ( 37 ) , perfect_games ( 11 ) and victories ( 71 ) . Her year-round pitching in high_school , age-group , women ' s open and international competition led to a wrist injury from overuse her freshman year at California ; although she was never the same after the injury , she set NCAA records for strikeouts ( 1 # 640 ) , shutouts ( 94 ) and victories ( 94 ) , among others . * H . John Huarte ' s legend grew first as a Mater Dei quarterback who led the Monarchs to the 1960 Southern Section championship -- as expected . At Notre Dame , he led the_Irish to a 9-1 season after the team had been 2-7 the year before -- and won the 1964 Heisman Trophy . * I . Keith Iwanaga often took_on bigger opponents who were cutting weight , but Iwanaga was a natural 123-pounder who won 1976 and ' 77 Southern Section titles for El Dorado ' s wrestling powerhouse . Iwanaga won with finesse , quickness and strength , and was the first of five wrestling brothers who followed him : Kevin , Kerry , Kent and Kyle . * J . This letter is loaded with outstanding candidates , but Walter Johnson ' s fastball was loaded with high octane . The &quot; Big Train &quot; pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907 to 1927 , set the standard for strikeout pitchers for the next 60 years , won 419 games and was an inaugural inductee into the Baseball Hall_of_Fame . But long before he stood beside Ty Cobb , Babe_Ruth and Honus Wagner at the induction ceremonies , Johnson was playing hardball for Fullerton High . Even after he became a professional , Johnson called a 15-inning , 0-0 tie_in which he struck_out 27 against Santa Ana his greatest game . Dr. Garland C . Ross played for Santa Ana that day in 1905 and recalled Johnson ' s fastball : &quot; It came_up_to the plate like a pea shot out of a cannon . For the most part , we just went_up to the plate , took three swings and walked back to the bench. &quot; Five years later , Johnson was baseball ' s dominant pitcher , winning 264 games over the next 10 years . * K . Few dominated an event the way Fullerton ' s Natalie Kaaiawahia dominated the shotput . She is the only athlete , male or female , to win four State titles in the same event . Kaaiawahia , over the course of 1980-83 at Fullerton , put the top 10 girls ' marks of all time , including a national prep record 53 feet 7 3 / 4 inches in 1983 that still stands . She also won two State titles in the discus , including a county-record throw of 174-9 . * L . Rick Leach led Laguna Beach to two Southern Section titles , was a Southern Section singles finalist in 1981 and the champion in 1983 . He went_on to win NCAA individual doubles titles at USC and nearly $ 2 million in prize_money and 27 doubles titles as a professional , including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open . He also played_on the U.S. Davis Cup team . * M . Ann Meyers brought national attention to women ' s basketball . After receiving varsity_letters in seven sports ( field_hockey , badminton , tennis , softball , volleyball , track , basketball ) and graduating from Sonora in 1974 , she became the first high_school player to make the U.S. national team , became a four-time All-American at UCLA , led the U.S. team to a silver medal in the 1976 Olympics and became the first woman to sign an NBA contract when she went_to training camp with the Indiana Pacers . Meyers , the MVP her only year in the defunct Women ' s Basketball_League , landed in the Basketball Hall_of_Fame ; with her husband , the late Don Drysdale , they are the only husband-wife team in halls_of_fame . * N . Phil Nevin , Baseball America ' s collegiate player of the year in 1992 , was the first player selected , by the Houston Astros , in the June 1992 amateur baseball draft . But Nevin , who first excelled_at El Dorado and Cal State Fullerton , also left his mark in the Orange County football record book . He holds the county record for longest field_goal , making one from 57 yards in a game against Esperanza his senior season in 1988 . He was the kicker for the Titan football_team from 1989-91 and also led Fullerton to the 1992 College World_Series . * O . The Oden Sisters dominated girls ' volleyball in the 1980s while at Irvine . Kim was the 1981 Southern Section player of the year and three-time NCAA All-American at Stanford ; Elaina won the honor in 1984 and was a two-time All-American at Pacific ; Beverly was so honored in 1987 and ' 88 and was a four-time All-American at Stanford . Beverly is the only sister who hasn ' t played in the Olympics , but she ' s currently starting on the U.S. national team . * P . Nicknamed &quot; The Chief , &quot; Cherokee Parks was one of the county ' s most highly touted high_school basketball_players . He accepted a scholarship offer to Duke , where he has helped the Blue_Devils reach the national championship game twice and win it once . In his senior year at Marina in 1991 , the 6-11 center scored 30 points -- 16 of them on dunks -- and blocked five shots to help the Vikings defeat top-ranked Mater Dei in the semifinals of the Division I-A playoffs , 64-55 , in front of a sold-out crowd of more_than 5 # 000 in the Bren Events Center . Said Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight : &quot; It was like me playing Nerf with my kids against the door . Cherokee was a man. &quot; * Q . The most amazing thing about Dan Quisenberry is that he was so average at Costa Mesa , from where he graduated in 1971 . Long before he became one of the best relief_pitchers in baseball history as a submariner , Quisenberry went_over the top with three-quarter tendencies , and met marginal success ; he was a . 500 pitcher at Costa Mesa . &quot; I was just a skinny kid that threw a lot of strikes , &quot; he said . &quot; The only reason I was a prep legend is because I became good in the big leagues. &quot; Very good ; his 277 saves , including 238 with the Kansas City Royals , put him in the top 10 . * R . Cathy Rigby launched women ' s gymnastics into the American consciousness at the 1968 Olympic Games as a pigtailed ninth-grader from Oak Junior_High , and appeared on the cover of Life , Look and Redbook magazines . By the time she graduated from Los Alamitos in 1971 , she had become the first American woman to win a medal in world competition . She retired at 19 after the 1972 Olympics having won 12 medals in international competition , including eight gold , and embarked_on a successful theatrical career . * S . El Toro produced two of the county ' s greatest quarterbacks in brothers Rob and Bret Johnson , but it was Steve Stenstrom who threw for more yardage than either in a single season , completing 65.4 % of his passes for 2 # 175 yards and 25 touchdowns , and leading the 1989 Chargers to a 12-2 record during his senior year . Now a senior at Stanford , he has broken John Elway ' s Pacific 10 records for all-time total offense ( 9 # 606 ) and yards passing ( 10 # 314 ) . * T . Garry Templeton was a standout baseball and football star for Santa Ana Valley . He had already signed to play football at Arizona State when he became the 13th baseball_player drafted in 1974 . Claude Gilbert , the San Diego State coach when Templeton was a senior in high_school , said : &quot; He was a great cornerback talent ; he could have been one hell of a football_player , but the baseball draft settled his career. &quot; That career as a major_league shortstop covered more_than 15 years ; he had a . 271 career batting_average and in 1979 , he became the first of only two switch-hitters to get 100 hits from each side of the plate . * U . When Jim Usevitch arrived_at Ocean View , he was slow moving , slow talking and slow thinking , but four years later he had become one of the greatest overachievers in Orange County basketball history . Standing 6-9 , height was his only natural gift . He was a high_school All-American in 1982 , his senior season , when he averaged 22 points and 14 rebounds . Though he had a fourth-grade reading level when he arrived , by his senior year , Usevitch was taking college prep courses . He averaged 15 points and seven rebounds at BYU , became a Continental Basketball Assn . all-star and is playing his sixth season in Europe . * V . Two years removed from Fullerton High , Arky Vaughan was playing shortstop and batting third for the 1932 Pittsburgh Pirates ; he would hit . 318 his rookie season , which would also be his average in a 14-year career . He missed three years because of World_War_II , but didn ' t miss the Hall_of_Fame -- he was elected in 1985 . * W . By the time Tiger Woods graduated from Western in 1994 , he had established himself as the best junior golfer of all time . He had the greatest comeback in the history of the U.S. Amateur , from six down with 23 to play , to surpass Jack Nicklaus as its youngest winner , and win a record-tying fourth consecutive USGA title . Only 16 , he became one of the youngest to play in a PGA Tour event when he competed in the 1992 L.A. Open . And he continued to play for his high_school , finishing with three Southern Section titles and four consecutive league titles , even though he was used to attracting hundreds in his gallery elsewhere . * X . What , are you kidding ? We exhausted our resources and exhumed the old record books . We looked everywhere . We toyed_with Blaise Bryant , whose middle name is Xavier . And we toyed_with Xuan Nguyen , a Garden Grove badminton player . Finally , we decided it wasn ' t worth toiling over . * Y . George Yardley , a 1946 graduate of Newport Harbor , was a scoring sensation who helped popularize the jump_shot and set collegiate and NBA scoring records along the way -- he was the first pro player to score 2 # 000 points in a season ( 2 # 001 in 1957-58 ) while playing for the Detroit Pistons . Yardley averaged 19.2 points per game and was a six-time NBA all-star . He also was an All-American AAU volleyball_player in the open division while attending Stanford and won six United States Tennis Assn . age-group doubles titles beginning in the mid-1970s . * Z . Lori Zeno was the most physically strong volleyball_player in county history , the first O.C. female to religiously lift weights with a purpose to complement her sport . She tried to win through intimidation and any other means and became a two-time co-player of the year in the Southern Section . She was so competitive , torn ligaments in her ankle couldn ' t stop her ; she played in a full cast up_to her knee in 1982 , her senior year at La Quinta -- and a no-cast rule soon followed . By her own admission , Zeno was a mean player . It just added_to her legend .
