   <TEXT> Garth Snow will make his Olympic hockey debut tonight , one game earlier than expected . Snow will replace Game 1 starter Mike Dunham when the United States faces 12th-seeded Slovakia at Gjovik Cavern Hall.Coach Tim Taylor ' s tentative plan was for Dunham to start the first two games and switch to Snow for the third game against Canada because of the latter ' s strong record against Canada , but the plan was changed after Monday ' s practice . Dunham , who alternated in goal with Snow at the University of Maine , played capably in Sunday ' s 4-4 tie against France . Although rarely tested severely , he made several crucial saves during a French power_play in the waning minutes . Dunham has faced Slovakia once , in a 5-5 tie on Nov . 21 during the Telehockey Cup tournament at Lillehammer last November . Snow has never faced Slovakia . Snow is 4-1-0 against Canada with a 3.01 goals-against average and . 903 save percentage . &quot; We ' ve said all along that we have a strong goaltending tandem in Mike Dunham and Garth Snow , and we ' ve said all along that both players would contribute , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; We saw how well Mike is capable of playing for us in the final minutes of our game against France . It ' s now Garth ' s turn. &quot; Snow , 24 , has already made his NHL debut . He was 3-2 during a brief stint with the Quebec Nordiques . &quot; Slovakia is a really solid team , &quot; Snow said . &quot; Offensively , they ' re probably up there with us . Maybe they don ' t have quite the speed we possess but they ' re good , especially Peter Stastny . He ' s really smart with the puck. &quot; HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
