   <HEADLINE> DUCKS TAKE SHOTS AT VACCINE OPENER ; HEALTH : 15 HOCKEY_PLAYERS BRAVE IMMUNIZATIONS AFTER PRACTICE DURING THE START OF THE VISITING_NURSE ASSN. ' S DRIVE TO PREPARE RESIDENTS FOR FLU SEASON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With three strains of influenza virus expected this winter , health officials Tuesday issued the season ' s first reminder that the elderly and people with chronic diseases should get flu vaccinations . Helping the Visiting Nurse Assn . of Orange County begin its vaccination program -- one of two available to county residents this fall -- were 15 barefoot and sweaty members of the Mighty Ducks hockey_team , who rolled_up their sleeves and submitted to vaccinations after a practice at The Pond in Anaheim . &quot; Aw , it was painless , &quot; defenseman Don McSween said after receiving his shot . McSween said he decided to get vaccinated because he feared frequent travel between hot and cold climates would increase his risk of catching the virus . The nonprofit public nurses association will charge $ 10 per vaccination ; county health officials also expect to administer free vaccinations to about 82 # 000 residents this year . The free shots are reserved for those who could face serious , if not fatal , illnesses if they come_down with the flu . This includes people older than 60 , anyone with chronic diseases such_as diabetes and emphysema , or those with long-term heart and lung problems . For most people though , the flu merely causes several days of discomfort that include aches , pains , fever , chills , weakness , coughing , a runny nose and a sore_throat . Some people remain under the weather for as little as 24 hours , while others are affected for as long as a week . California ' s flu season typically begins in mid-December and peaks in January and February , said Dr. Loring Dales , chief of the immunization branch of the state_Department of Health Services . Health officials said they have no way of predicting what this year ' s flu season will be like , but early indications are encouraging . &quot; Last year we had reports of the flu very early in the season , in August and September , &quot; said Dr. Gerald Wagner , medical director of the Orange County immunization project . But so far this year , there have been no reports of flu . Health officials have identified three strains of influenza , each named after the place where they were discovered , that they believe will affect Americans this year : Texas , Shandong ( China ) and Panama . According to officials at the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Shandong is a new manifestation of the virus . While some people face more risk from the flu than others , many health officials recommend that everyone get a shot . &quot; All of us can be affected and we could all come_down with the flu and miss work , &quot; said Joan Q . Randall , executive_vice_president of the Visiting Nurse Assn . She said American businesses lose an estimated $ 4 billion annually because of employees calling_in sick with flu-related illnesses . At least 80 % of those who receive vaccinations will never develop the flu or suffer only reduced effects , state health officials said . The only reported side_effect of the vaccination is a slight soreness in the arm that lasts a day or two . The nurses ' association has begun providing immunization shots at area Long ' s Drugs , Sav-On Drug Stores and Albertson ' s supermarkets for anyone age 13 or older each weekend through Dec . 11 . The county also provides free vaccinations to people 60 years or older and those with chronic diseases . This year , the Orange County Health_Care Agency has received enough vaccine from the state to administer 82 # 340 shots . Public clinics will begin offering the vaccinations Nov . 1 . About 75 % of the doses are administered in the first month , Wagner said . The vaccine helps recipients build immunity to the virus beginning about two weeks after the shot and protects them for several months . One shot each season is enough for those 9 years and older , but children 8 years or younger may require shots more frequently , health officials said . Besides getting a shot , health officials say the best way to avoid getting the flu is to wash hands often , get lots of sleep and avoid sick people . For those who get the flu , health officials offer the following tips : Stay home and rest for the first three to five days , eat lightly and drink lots of fluids . Those who experience severe symptoms should see a doctor . Antiviral drugs such_as amantadine or rimantadine may shorten the duration of the flu in adults if prescribed early . Parents should give young children and infants acetaminophen medication , such_as Tylenol , instead of aspirin to control fever . Help for Flu Season Free flu shots will be provided_for county residents who meet eligibility requirements . The immunizations will be given to : * Anyone 60 and older . * Nursing_home and chronic-care facility residents , any age , with chronic medical conditions . * People with chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular disorders , including asthma . * Anyone requiring regular medical follow-up because of chronic metabolic diseases . * Children and teen-agers , age 6 months to 18 years , receiving long-term aspirin therapy . * Those with compromised immune_systems , including anyone with HIV or AIDS . * Physicians , nurses and other hospital staff who have contact with those at risk for flu-related complications . * Household members of those at risk of flu-related complications .
