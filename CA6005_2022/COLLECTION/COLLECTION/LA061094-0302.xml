   <HEADLINE> STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF ABSTINENCE ; HEALTH : PLACENTIA EDUCATORS USE PROGRAM TO TEACH TEENS TO TAKE_CONTROL OF THEIR LIVES AND RESIST PEER PRESSURE TO ENGAGE IN SEX .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Andrienne Ervin and Cyndi Watson have long worked with youngsters , helping them navigate the rocky terrain of adolescence . They ' ve witnessed the highs and lows , the successes and the failures . Throughout their careers they have strived to turn those often turbulent teen-age years into safe and productive times for their students . Now , Ervin , an El Dorado High_School assistant principal , and Watson , a teacher at Tuffre Junior_High_School , have found themselves on the front_lines in a battle over adolescent sex in the 1990s . They are among a growing number of educators , school counselors and health_professionals across the country who are seeing teen-agers -- even children in middle_school -- having_sex at increasingly younger ages , sometimes with multiple partners and often showing scant concern for their safety . Concerned about the threat of AIDS , other sexually transmitted diseases and the increase in teen pregnancies , Ervin , Watson and others are fighting to turn_back the tide of early sexual behavior and convince young people that it can be harmful to their physical as well as emotional health . In a program called &quot; Education Now , Babies Later &quot; ( ENBL ) , Watson teaches seventh-grade girls and boys at Tuffre that it is important for youngsters to postpone having_sex . The program , one of many being used nationally by schools , churches and communities to promote teen abstinence , teaches young people refusal skills that will help them resist peer pressure to engage in sex at an early age . &quot; My concern is for their lives , &quot; said Ervin , who has been an educator for 26 years and a strong supporter of ENBL at her school . &quot; We want to show them that they have a choice whether to have_sex or to wait . We are saying you are in control of your destiny. &quot; * Doctors at the national Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention in Atlanta view early teen sex as such a health risk for adolescents that they have cited reduction of teen sexual_activity as a national health objective . Educators like Ervin and Watson see firsthand why teen sex has become a critical issue . Adolescents &quot; seem to be under tremendous pressure to go_through the rites of passage , &quot; Ervin said . They want to grow_up so fast . They see movies , television and advertisements that are &quot; oozing with sex . So , they think everyone is doing_it . . . . They believe ' if I don ' t do_it , my friends will think I ' m a geek. ' &quot; &quot; We have to do more_than just provide birth_control information for kids , &quot; she said . When you just &quot; tell kids to use condoms , it ' s like giving_up , and saying , ' You are going_to do_it anyway , ' &quot; Ervin said . &quot; It ' s scary , &quot; said Watson , who has taught youngsters for 18 years . &quot; I am seeing a lot of girls as young as 12 and 13 having_sex . . . and bragging about it . They think they are invincible to pregnancy or ( sexually transmitted ) diseases. &quot; * In California alone , a statewide study in 1992 found that 17 % of girls between the ages of 12 and 14 were sexually active , according to Cynthia Scheinberg , executive_director of the Coalition for Children , Adolescents and Parents in Orange County . The state-funded ENBL program is being used in schools throughout the state , including 65 in Orange County , Scheinberg said . The coalition has the state contract to set_up the program in Orange County schools . The program is not without its critics . Those opposed to abstinence-based programs complain that it is unrealistic to believe that kids are going_to stop having_sex . By teaching abstinence only , they say , the programs fail to provide important information about health and anatomy . Critics also believe that such a curriculum makes kids who have had_sex feel guilty and feel_like failures . This fall , the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention will release results of its latest survey on teen sexual behavior in the United States . In its first national survey on risky behavior among young people in 1990-91 , the study found that 40 % of teen-agers polled said they had sexual_intercourse by the ninth grade . Seventy-two percent of those polled said they had_intercourse by their senior year in high_school . Twenty percent of the students surveyed said they had had_sex with four or more partners in their lifetime . &quot; The results were concerning , &quot; said Dr. Laura Kann , who helped conduct the CDC study . &quot; The results showed there are a lot of kids who are at risk for ( sexually transmitted diseases ) . . . AIDS , and pregnancies. &quot; * Today , doctors at the Atlanta center estimate that 3 million teen-agers suffer from a sexually transmitted disease , including syphilis , gonorrhea and chlamydia . Watson and other educators and psychologists who work with adolescents are particularly troubled by the cavalier attitude toward sex they see displayed by boys and girls . For some of these youngsters , sex has become a game . Despite the threat of pregnancy , AIDS and other diseases , some of these kids are throwing caution to the wind , said psychologist Lois Raffel , who counsels students in the Placentia Yorba-Linda Unified District schools . The reasons for early sexual_activity among teens may be varied , according to experts on adolescent behavior . Peer pressure , changing attitudes toward sex , lack of adult supervision , influences by the media , a breakdown of family and community , and lack of health and sex education , are some of the explanations offered . Experimentation with drugs and alcohol also lead to early sexual_activity , counselors say . * Priscilla Hurley , executive_director of Choices / Teen Awareness Inc. , another educational_program in Orange County that stresses abstinence to students , argues that many youngsters are hearing no guidelines about sex from society . &quot; Culturally , there are no boundaries in terms of sexual behavior today , &quot; she said . &quot; Teens are_on a wide-open playing_field . They are confused , &quot; said Hurley , whose program is used at various Orange County schools , including El Dorado High . &quot; I was part of the ' 60s . We believed if it feels good do_it , &quot; Hurley said . But the free sex philosophy of the ' 60s does not work today and kids have to get that message , she said . They have to be taught that &quot; if you pursue that kind of behavior , we will lose you. &quot; The number of babies born to young teen-agers in this country has continued to rise since the mid- to late 1980s . In 1991 , 531 # 591 babies were born to girls under the age of 20 , an increase of more_than 50 # 000 from 1985 , according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . In Orange County alone , 1 # 657 babies were born in 1992 to girls between the ages of 15 and 17 . Seventy-nine babies were born to girls between the ages of 10 and 14 , a 38 % increase during a five-year period , according to data provided by the Coalition for Children , Adolescents and Parents . * As some young_girls have become more independent and assertive , they have become more aggressive in their pursuit of boys , notes Los Angeles psychologist Marcia Lasswell . They feel free to call boys first , ask them out on dates , initiate sex and then boast about it to their friends . &quot; They go_after what they want . They are more overt ( sexually ) and sometimes it gets_out of hand , &quot; said Lasswell , president of the American Assn . for Marriage and Family Therapy . Lasswell said she and some of her colleagues even hear of girls &quot; pressuring the boys to have_sex and making references_to their manhood &quot; if they decline . For some young_girls , sex satisfies a desperate yearning for the love and affection that may be missing in their lives , Raffel said . For them , it is not a game , she said . They want to &quot; be loved , touched and cared_for . We all need that as human_beings . But in today ' s rushed and hurried world we aren ' t doing that as often as we should. &quot; For some boys , early sex is viewed_as expected behavior and a status symbol among some kids , counselors say . * Rachel Brady , a senior at Dana Hills High_School , said , &quot; I know there are girls who are having_sex starting at ages 13 and 14 . It blows my mind . &quot; They ' re having_sex that early because they need to look and feel older . . . and peer pressure . When girls are younger , it ' s cool to be with older guys and maybe have_sex with them , &quot; said Brady , 18 , a cheerleader . Others do_it to rebel against their parents . Brady said she knew of one girl at her school who wanted to get pregnant and did for that very reason . She also did_it because she thought she would have more independence from her parents if she got pregnant and had a baby . Brenda , a 14-year-old freshman at Los Alamitos High_School , said she is disturbed by how sexually active some of her classmates are . &quot; Some kids treat sex as if it means nothing . They don ' t realize the problems it could create . They think sex is expected of them . In fact , a lot of boys won ' t go_out with a girl unless they will have_sex , &quot; said Brenda , who is not using her real name . &quot; One friend started having_sex in sixth grade . It was really sad . It was obvious the boy was using her . &quot; In grade_school , we all thought having_sex was stupid . But now some of them are doing_it . They think I ' m really uptight . But I can ' t even picture myself having_sex now . Getting pregnant at 14 would be the worst. &quot; &quot; I had one little_girl in my class who I was 99 % sure was sexually active , &quot; Watson said . &quot; She was 12 years old and she wrote_on one of her papers , ' Sex is great. ' &quot; Watson recalled a 15-year-old girl at school who had_sex with one boy to get_back at another boyfriend . She got pregnant and had an abortion . She also sees how crushed some of these girls are when their sexual_relationship ends in rejection or pregnancy . &quot; For 12- and 14-year-olds , it can be devastating . These kids just don ' t understand . They cry and cry . Some of them have been suicidal. &quot; * Parents can play an important role in helping to turn the tide in teen-age sex , Watson and others say . The ENBL program also educates parents on helping their teens to delay sex . But counselors complain that some parents either give their children the wrong message about sex or no message at all . &quot; I think a lot of parents don ' t really know how prevalent sexual_activity is . I think they are afraid to talk to their kids , &quot; Watson said . Some parents are too permissive , allowing their high-school-age children to serve alcohol at parties or failing to monitor behavior , Watson said . Teacher Robbie Brady , who counsels students at Dana Hills High_School , said she has seen 14-year-olds being left alone for a weekend , youngsters being allowed out late at night or spending long periods_of_time with members of the opposite sex without adult supervision . It becomes an invitation for trouble , the experts say . &quot; Some parents who don ' t set guidelines for their children argue that they don ' t want to interfere , &quot; psychologist Lasswell said . &quot; Of course parents should interfere . that ' s what they are there for . Parents need to keep a close eye on their children . Otherwise , they will begin trying things they shouldn ' t. &quot; Watson , Ervin and the others hope they can give these youngsters the skills to combat peer pressure and take_control of their lives . But it may be an uphill battle . &quot; They are given information about pregnancy , AIDS &quot; and sexually transmitted diseases , Raffel said . &quot; But that doesn ' t matter in the heat of passion . If somebody says , ' I love you , ' and you don ' t hear that very often , passion takes_over and you don ' t think_about the health book lesson at school. &quot;</TEXT>
