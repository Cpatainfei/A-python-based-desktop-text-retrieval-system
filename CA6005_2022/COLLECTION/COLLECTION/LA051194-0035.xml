   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : WHEN THINGS GET HOT , A KISS COOLS MOOD IN HEAT OF PASSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russell Prowse , an Australian Rules football_player who plays for Cardross in the Millawa League , thought a fight was developing during last week ' s game in Melbourne against Bambill . Instead of trading blows , though , Prowse grabbed Scott Cameron of Bambill by the cheeks and kissed him on the lips . Cameron staggered back in amazement and the potential fight evaporated , but umpire Tony Cox banished Prowse from the field for misconduct . &quot; We felt sorry_for Cameron , as Prowse is not an attractive man , &quot; Cardross President Keith Leach said . * Trivia time : What was UCLA ' s Pacific Coast Conference basketball record when Denny Crum played for John Wooden in 1957-58 and 1958-59 ? * Unsolicited advice : Former Dallas Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson says his replacement , Barry Switzer , can do fine . &quot; He ' ll be all_right as long as he doesn ' t make any suggestions , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; This is a pretty good football machine here and if he just lets the machine run he ' ll be all_right . This team is still very capable of winning big football games. &quot; In other words , Barry , just shut_up and smile . * To be , or not to be : Brentson Buckner , a 300-pound defensive tackle and the Pittsburgh Steelers ' second-round draft choice from Clemson , is an avid reader of Shakespeare . &quot; The thing I like about Shakespeare is that what you see at first glance is not always the true meaning , &quot; Buckner said . * Looking_back : On this day in 1963 , Sandy Koufax pitched the second of his four no-hit_games as the Dodgers beat the Giants , 8-0 . * Not his Buddy : Norman Braman , the former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles , said he has no regrets about firing Buddy Ryan as coach after the 1990 season . &quot; Normally , I hate to fire people , but in that case , I enjoyed it , &quot; Braman told Will McDonough of the Boston Globe . &quot; I wanted to do_it myself . &quot; To me and my wife , Buddy was always courteous . But he treated other people in the organization -- and great people they are -- very poorly . He created conflict. &quot; * Sounds familiar : One of the nicknames suggested for Toronto ' s new NBA team : the Mighty Dunks. &quot; * Tough standards : In his new book , John Kruk of the Philadelphia Phillies writes_of pitcher Curt Schilling : &quot; He wants to be one of us , but we won ' t let him in . Every once in a while we let him sit in on our little debates , but our pitching has been so bad that most of the time we ' re guarded now . . . . &quot; &quot; If we played for 20 years with a guy and he put_up numbers like Steve Carlton , then maybe in his 18th or 19th year we might decide he was all right. &quot; * The Yogi Berra file : &quot; I get_up at 6 a.m. , no matter what time it is. &quot; * Trivia answer : The Bruins finished third each year , with a 10-6 record . * Quotebook : Hal McRae , manager of the Kansas City Royals , on the errors his team is making : &quot; We ' re giving_away things like we were Democrats. &quot; MAL FLORENCE</TEXT>
