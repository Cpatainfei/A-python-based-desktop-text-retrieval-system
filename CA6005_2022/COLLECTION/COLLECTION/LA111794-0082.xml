   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; BOND YIELDS SURGE ; BLUE_CHIPS UP SOLIDLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Long-term bond yields surged Wednesday as investors found little reassurance in the news of unexpectedly tame inflation last month . Blue-chip stocks racked_up solid gains . The yield on the Treasury ' s key 30-year bond rose to 8.09 % from Tuesday ' s 8.03 % . Its price , which falls when yields rise , dropped 22 / 32 point , or $ 6.88 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Prices of shorter-term maturities posted smaller losses . Blue-chip stocks posted moderate gains for most of the session until a late burst of trading propelled it decisively higher . The Dow Jones industrial average gained 18.84 points to close at 3 # 845.20. The Labor_Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.1 % in October , the best inflation performance in six months . Many analysts had expected an increase matching the 0.2 % rise in September . The so-called core rate , which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors , was also tame in October , rising just 0.2 % for the second month in a row . Bond prices initially shot higher after Wednesday ' s good news on inflation , which over a bond ' s life can eat_away at the value of the preset interest payments . But as the day wore_on , investors apparently decided that October inflation was old news . Unlike bond traders , stock investors were buoyed partly by the consumer_price_index report . Analysts said investors were also shopping for a_few select stocks among blue_chips . But as investors picked_at stocks , analysts said the market as_a_whole was unsettled by bonds ' inability to add_to Tuesday ' s rally , which was sparked by the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s interest_rate hike .

At the American_Stock_Exchange , the market_value index fell 0.22 point to 448.39. Meanwhile , the dollar weakened as foreign-exchange traders took profits from a surge the previous day , when the currency derived strength from the Fed ' s sharper-than-expected rate increase . In New York , the dollar closed at 1.551 German marks and 98.35 Japanese yen , down from 1.556 and 98.76 , respectively , on Tuesday .
