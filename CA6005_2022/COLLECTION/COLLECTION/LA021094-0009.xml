   <TEXT> On a recent winter morning , when the temperature is double_digits below zero and the streets are waist-high in shimmery , silver snow , Bergliot Norvoll ' s south Minneapolis kitchen is warm and fragrant from bread baking . She takes a quick peek at the loaves in the oven and talks_about life , lefse and lutefisk . Norvoll , who is nicknamed Bitten ( &quot; They think Bergliot is a man , you know &quot; ) was raised in Narvik , a Norwegian seaport about 150 miles north of the Arctic_Circle , where women once spent days traveling from home to home making rounds of lefse -- a flatbread that resembles a flour tortilla -- for the fishermen of the house . Each man provided his own food on the boat , and the lefse was stacked in steamer trunks along with other provisions and lugged on board to be rationed while at_sea . The fishing was good back when Norvoll was a girl , and the men always arrived home with plenty of catch left over to feed their families . It wasn ' t until she married Torbjorn Norvoll in 1950 that she seriously considered moving to America . By then the couple was living_in Oslo and things had not yet gotten_back to normal after wartime occupation by the Nazis . Food was still scarce and there was a tremendous housing shortage . &quot; We had just married and would have had to wait for at least two years to get an apartment , &quot; says Norvoll , &quot; so we figured we ' d come_to America for a short time , make a pile of money and then come_back home. &quot; The couple first settled in the small_town of Fosston , Minn. , where it was even colder than Norway and where Torbjorn had an uncle who owned a bakery . The Norvolls weren ' t alone . So many Norwegians have migrated to Minnesota that the state now has a staffed Norwegian consulate . ( A Canadian consulate is the only other one in Minnesota. ) Norvoll , who had spent a year at hotel school and then another year at husmor ( housewife ' s ) school in Norway , helped with the baking . It wasn ' t long before they realized they were never going_to get rich . About the same time , it dawned on them that they wanted to stay here . * that ' s when they moved to Minneapolis , where Norvoll got a job cooking at Northwest Airlines . &quot; Airline food was much better then , &quot; she says . &quot; We made everything from scratch in Northwest ' s kitchens . I remember one day we roasted 15 turkeys. &quot; To supplement her income , Norvoll also catered on weekends and taught Norwegian cooking classes at the Minneapolis Technical Institute . &quot; I ' m just kind of an ambitious person , &quot; she says , &quot; and working keeps you healthy. &quot; And what exactly is Norwegian food ? Even those with Scandinavian roots have trouble differentiating between Swedish and Norwegian cuisines . Because of their close proximity , the growing_seasons and climates are much the same . It ' s all white food , right ? &quot; The crops are pretty much the same , &quot; says Norvoll , &quot; but each country has its own tradition . For instance , though many pastry shapes and tools are the same , and most Scandinavians use a lot of cardamom , Norvoll says that Norwegians tend to use a lot more almond flavoring . And while Swedes and Norwegians share a love for lutefisk ( lewd-uh-fisk ) -- the translucent rubbery dish created by soaking cod in salt and then in a solution of lye -- only in Norway is it typically steamed and then slathered in butter . In Sweden , the fish is served in a cream_sauce . * &quot; I love it , &quot; says Norvoll . &quot; My grandfather used to make_it all_the time , and so do I. &quot; Her husband , however , was not a fan of the fish . &quot; He had never eaten lutefisk before he came ( to the U . S. ) , &quot; says Norvoll . &quot; Whenever I would make_it , he would wrinkle his nose and say , ' In Norway we had good fish. ' &quot; Norvoll is retired now , and her husband has passed_away . Yet she is busier than ever . &quot; Sometimes it ' s a bit too_much , &quot; she says , shaking her head as she is reminded of her hectic social life , most of which seems to center around activities with Norwegian groups . On sub-zero winter mornings , when it ' s too cold to be outdoors for more_than a_few minutes , you ' ll find Norvoll walking the corridors of Mall of America with other members of a Norwegian hiking club . She also belongs_to several other Norwegian clubs , including Sons of Norway . Lefse and seafood still play a part in her life . She regularly turns_out at least three kinds of lefse and prepares fish several times a week . &quot; Whenever anyone comes_to my house to eat , they expect seafood , &quot; she says . &quot; Only nowadays fish tastes merely OK. &quot; It ' s just not as tasty as what she used to eat when growing_up in Norway . Norvoll also loves to bake . &quot; Decorating is my cup_of_tea , &quot; she says . &quot; My grandchildren don ' t think it ' s their birthday unless I make them blotkake ( Norwegian birthday_cake ) . &quot; She makes all her own bread and thinks nothing of getting_out her krumkake iron to make the fancy , thin roll-up cookies , or maybe whip_up a batch of hjortebakkels ( Norwegian doughnuts ) . &quot; When you make fresh doughnuts , &quot; she says , &quot; there really isn ' t anything better. &quot; Maybe that ' s why there ' s always someone dropping_by for a chat , endless cups of coffee and a little lunch . ( In Minnesota , lunch is eaten_at least three times a day : before dinner ( what most Southern Californians consider lunch ) , after dinner and after the evening supper. ) * &quot; In Norway we went_to each other ' s houses all_the time for coffee or whatever , just to get_together , &quot; Norvoll says . &quot; Then we came here and found other Norwegians and just kind of grouped together. &quot; * Hjortebakkels are smaller and richer than American cake doughnuts . &quot; Your doughnuts have too_much sugar , too_much vanilla , &quot; moans Norvoll . &quot; Oh , vanilla , you don ' t find a cookie here unless it has vanilla in it. &quot; NORWEGIAN CAKE DOUGHNUTS ( Hjortebakkels ) 8 eggs 2 cups sugar 8 cups flour 1 / 2 cup butter , melted 1 / 2 cup whipping cream 1 / 8 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda Juice and zest 1 lemon 2 tablespoons Cognac Sugar and cardamom , mixed Beat eggs until lemon-colored .

Each doughnut contains about : 229 calories ; 52 mg sodium ; 70 mg cholesterol ; 6 grams fat ; 38 grams carbohydrates ; 5 grams protein ; 0.11 gram fiber . * Norvoll , who watches her diet , swears by this high-fiber bread . She often brings a loaf with her to Sons of Norway get-togethers . &quot; I think it ' s important to cook healthy , &quot; she says . &quot; People here don ' t diet , they just talk_about it. &quot; NORWEGIAN HEALTH BREAD ( Helsebrod ) 3 tablespoons yeast Raw sugar_Water 1 / 4 cup dark corn_syrup 1 / 4 cup molasses 1 teaspoon salt 1 / 2 cup corn_oil 2 1 / 2 cups whole-wheat or graham_flour 1 1 / 4 cups oatmeal ( not instant ) 1 1 / 4 cups wheat_germ 5 cups all-purpose flour In bowl dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in 1 / 2 cup of warm water .
