   <HEADLINE> WHOLESALE PRICES RISE MODESTLY IN NOVEMBER AS RETAIL SALES SURGE ; ECONOMY : IN LIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT FIGURES , ANALYSTS SAY THE FED STILL COULD RAISE INTEREST_RATES AGAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wholesale prices rose moderately and retail sales surged in November , the government reported Tuesday , indicating that the economy is still expanding but without a bout of worrisome inflation . The Labor_Department said its producer_price_index rose 0.5 % , in_line with expectations . Such a big increase in the index would normally stir inflation concerns , but analysts dismissed the rise as a bouncing_back after two big consecutive monthly declines . They noted that a measurement of so-called core inflation , which excludes the often-volatile food and energy sectors and which economists believe more closely reflects underlying price pressures , edged_up a barely perceptible 0.1 % . Nonetheless , analysts suggested that another rate hike by the Federal_Reserve_Board is possible . &quot; The Fed ' s inclination to tighten or not to tighten at the Dec . 20 ( policy-making session ) is probably not altered by these data , &quot; said Ray Stone of Stone &amp; McCarthy , a financial markets research firm in Princeton , N.J. &quot; The Fed is looking_into 1995. &quot; &quot; On balance , inflation still appears slight at the finished-goods level , but the economy is clearly growing fast enough to lead to further Fed tightening , &quot; said Bruce Steinberg , macroeconomics manager for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . in New York . Many analysts said they expect Fed policy-makers to leave interest_rates unchanged when they meet Dec . 20 , but said that another increase would be more likely at the next meeting , on Jan . 31 and Feb . 1 . However , some_other analysts said the strong tone of virtually all recent economic statistics could persuade the Fed to move this month . The Commerce_Department reported that retail sales surged by 1.2 % in November after making a gain of 1.3 % in October , suggesting that the holiday shopping season got_off to a solid start . The bond market responded in a mixed way to the reports , with the yield on the 30-year Treasury_bond easing to 7.85 % from 7.92 % on Monday . But short-term interest_rates rose -- sharply narrowing the gap between short- and long-term rates -- indicating investor beliefs that the Fed will raise short-term rates further . The mild gain in the wholesale inflation figure was propelled by a 4.5 % rise in gasoline prices . The jump was caused in part by a requirement for cleaner-burning fuels in metropolitan areas . The wholesale price rise followed a 0.5 % decline both in September and October as the industry continued to digest higher production and commodity price increases . Stephen Roach , senior economist at Morgan Stanley , said the moderate increase &quot; continues to indicate that despite the pressures at the upstream stages of production , there is an inability to pass ( price increases ) through at the finished-goods level. &quot; Prices for goods at the intermediate level of production rose 1.1 % , whereas so-called crude goods at the commodity level were up 1 % . So far this year , inflation at the wholesale level has been rising at a moderate annual rate of 1.6 % . Food prices rose a moderate 0.2 % in November , after having declined 0.2 % in October . Overall energy prices were up 2.1 % , primarily because of the increase in gasoline prices . It was the largest jump since February , when the figure was 2.8 % . The Commerce_Department said passenger_car prices rose 1.0 % and tobacco prices fell 0.4 % . Beef prices rose , but vegetable prices declined substantially . The retail sales picture gives ammunition to those who argue that the U.S. economy is growing quickly . The Commerce_Department report showing a stronger-than-expected gain , to a seasonally adjusted $ 194.2 billion , follows a revised 1.3 % gain in October . November was the sixth straight month for rising retail sales figures , and the 1.2 % increase was more_than twice the 0.5 % that Wall_Street economists had forecast . Warm weather for much of the month had been expected to curb demand for many items , particularly clothing . However , apparel sales increased last month by 0.6 % , following a big 2.2 % jump in October . General-merchandise stores , where sales fell 0.1 % after a 0.3 % rise in October , was the only category in which sales declined from October . Sales of new cars rose 14.6 % in November . New cars account_for about a fifth of total retail sales , so swings in_demand strongly influence the overall monthly figure . Retail sales excluding cars increased 0.9 % last month after rising 0.5 % in October . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Retail Sales Seasonally adjusted , in billions of dollars , Nov .
