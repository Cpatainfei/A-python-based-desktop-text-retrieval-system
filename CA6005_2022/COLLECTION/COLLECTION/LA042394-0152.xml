   <HEADLINE> HATA : JAPAN ' S HOPE TO END PARALYSIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tsutomu Hata began using wooden business_cards when he was promoting Japanese wood products two decades ago , and he still carries them . When he was pitching silk as one of the Parliament ' s agricultural experts , he switched to silk underwear . He continues to wear silk . Hata still dutifully dons short-sleeved summer suits to promote energy conservation , cheerfully oblivious to the outdated look . And the man who will become Japan ' s next prime_minister still insists that Japanese intestines are longer than Western guts , an infamous comment he made in 1987 when he was agricultural minister arguing that foreign beef imports should be banned because the meat would be indigestible here . Hata , 58 , who is expected to win election as Japan ' s prime_minister on Monday , is one of the nation ' s consummate political pitchmen . Sell him on an idea , say those close to him , and he ' ll bite into it like a bulldog . Then he will spend hours trying to win converts , using his famous gift of gab , likable manner and tenacity . He may lack the intellectual intensity and strategic vision of his chief political ally , Ichiro Ozawa of the Japan Renewal Party , who is regarded_as Hata ' s brain . But at a time of deep political turmoil and policy paralysis , of sharp disputes within the fragile eight-party governing coalition , Hata ' s nice-guy approach , his ability to bring people together and coax them into consensus may be what the nation needs most now , analysts say . &quot; He ' s basically a man of moderation and harmony and might be appropriate at this time of political fluidity and the need to form a majority coalition , &quot; said Takashi Inoguchi , a Tokyo University political_science professor . &quot; A more spearheading kind of leader would create too many enemies . &quot; But the flip side of the coin is that his political content is so . . . shallow that some people find him a little boring. &quot; As a soon-to-be prime_minister , Hata ' s single greatest defining factor is his symbiotic relationship with Ozawa , analysts say . Hata provides the sales pitch for Ozawa ' s policy , they say , seducing the public through persuasion . His way contrasts with Ozawa ' s heavy-handedness , and his boyish charm serves as &quot; the mask to cover the dirty face of Ozawa , &quot; one analyst said . Hata brings few of the public expectations that surrounded the man he will succeed , Morihiro Hosokawa . Hosokawa , who announced his intent to resign two weeks ago under a cloud of questionable financial transactions , was a fresh and relatively unknown political aristocrat . He symbolized the public ' s desire for change from the system of back-room deals and corrupt money politics honed under the Liberal Democratic Party ' s 38-year reign . Hata , however , is very much an Establishment politician , a protege of the master of money politics , former Prime_Minister Kakuei Tanaka . Still , he is relatively free_of the taint of scandal -- he has a poor reputation as a fund-raiser and has few ties to the powerful construction_industry -- which has long fueled Japanese politics . He says it was precisely his exposure to the dark side of Japanese politics as chief of the LDP ' s Election Bureau in 1984 that persuaded him to try to reduce the need for money in elections . &quot; If there is anyone who has seen both the good and bad side of Japanese politics , it is me , &quot; he told a Japanese magazine last year . &quot; Japan is now too important to have its political reputation defined by scandal and indecision. &quot; Few , however , expect Hata to blaze new trails . He has held the critical posts of ministers_of_finance , foreign affairs and agriculture during his 24-year political career , making him one of the most experienced leaders in the coalition . But no one can recall any distinctive &quot; Hata color &quot; he gave to his jobs . Describing his reputation among Japanese politicians , the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said : &quot; His enemies are few , but he is an eight-sided beauty with no core beliefs &quot; -- an expression for a person who tries to please everyone . His chief role may be to hold the shaky coalition together until its competing factions begin to sort themselves out after the next general_election . Despite his social charms , however , some analysts predict that the coalition won ' t last even that long and may yet fall_apart within weeks , dooming a Hata Administration to one of the shortest in history . Analysts say Hata has two formidable factors_in his favor : the backing of the nation ' s powerful bureaucrats and the mass media . Although many of the mandarins became openly derisive of Hosokawa ' s inexperience as time went_on , a growing number are persuaded that they need to help the Hata Cabinet succeed , political commentator Minoru Morita said . &quot; Increasingly , many_more officials of the central government believe that in_order to stop Japan ' s credibility from falling further , we should avoid at all costs another change of government , &quot; Morita said . Hata enjoys good press mainly because he takes the time to talk to reporters in clear language . At an appearance before foreign correspondents in August , he made headlines by saying Japan owed Asia an apology for World_War_II rather than the usual diplomatic equivocation of expressions of &quot; regret. &quot; He also said the government should apologize to victims of the atomic_bomb and other war victims . His comments preceded Hosokawa ' s widely reported apology for Japan ' s waging of a &quot; war of aggression. &quot; Propped_up on policy by Ozawa and the bureaucrats , analysts say , Hata is likely to aim his public_speaking skills at forming a national consensus on two of Japan ' s hottest_issues : North_Korea ' s nuclear threat , and tax_policy , including a consumption tax_hike to finance an income_tax cut . He also wants to correct the image of Japan as a &quot; nation with no face , &quot; by saying yes and no clearly and conveying a sense of Japan ' s direction to the world , said his wife , Yasuko , in an interview . Unlike recent prime_ministers -- the scholarly Kiichi Miyazawa , the aristocratic Hosokawa -- Hata is known for using the plain language of the people . One of his mottoes , hanging_in his office , is that &quot; Politics is connected to plain language. &quot; Hata was born Aug . 24 , 1935 , the oldest of four sons in a family of politicians in Nagano prefecture , a region of breathtaking natural beauty , high educational achievement and new social trends two hours by train from Tokyo . But his grass-roots bona fides were established during a decade as a grunt for the Odakyu Bus Co . in Tokyo , where he started_out as a ticket puncher and ended_up as a tour planner . No whiz kid , he had gotten the job through his father ' s connections after being first rejected by the Asahi and Nihon Keizai newspapers . He moved to tour planning from accounting partly because , despite earning a degree in economics , he was weak at calculations . But he was always popular . He was a ringleader of groups ranging from noodle-eating clubs to a student bank . Friends called him a &quot; carrier_pigeon &quot; because he constantly shuttled around visiting friends . He was drafted into politics reluctantly when his father died , and he won his first lower house election in 1969 . After a long political career allied_with Tanaka and former Prime_Minister Noboru Takeshita , he broke_away from the LDP last year with Ozawa and 42 other members to form the Japan Renewal Party . Their defection led to the end of the LDP ' s 38-year iron-clad rule . Hata , however , never forgot his roots . Unlike the Armani ties and custom-made suits sported by Hosokawa , his clothes are no-name , off-the-rack . His wife says he socializes little with other politicians , preferring instead a night of sake and noodles at inexpensive joints with good friends from his bus_company days . Or he attends concerts with such pals as conductor Seiji Ozawa , a fellow graduate of Seijo University in Tokyo . Unusual for a Japanese politician , Hata and his wife , whom he met in college , frequently socialize as a couple . After graduation , he insisted that she and their children live with him in Tokyo rather than stay in the local district , as is the common practice , because he saw how his father ' s political career had disrupted his own family life . Yasaku Hata says he discusses virtually all political issues with her , soliciting her opinion . He has maintained such a normal life that &quot; there really hasn ' t been any difference &quot; in shifting from a bus_company wife to a political one , she said . That normality and reliance on persuasion &quot; would give him the qualities needed to be a leader at a time of peace , &quot; the analyst Morita said . &quot; But I harbor certain doubts about whether or not he can lead in times of confusion. &quot; Chiaki Kitada of The Times ' Tokyo Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
