   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; HE SAYS ITALIA , SHE SAYS BRASIL ; IN THEIR MARRIAGE , SOCCER RIVALRY RAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He ' s Italian , she ' s Brazilian , and they are both rabidly patriotic soccerfans . If that ' s not enough to drive a marriage counselor to tears -- what with those two countries facing each other in the emotional World Cup_final Sunday -- there ' s more . Ronaldo and Mercedes Pellegrini married in 1970 , a_few months before their beloved teams last met for the most coveted sports trophy on Earth . Brazil delivered an ugly 4-1 beating to Italy , and for the next 12 years , Mercedes had bragging rights . Then in 1982 , Brazil was eliminated in early rounds and Italy went_on to take the Cup . Ronaldo uncorked some Mediterranean-sized gloating . Now , Mercedes figures it ' s almost her turn again . &quot; Revenge , &quot; she said Friday , rolling the word out with a Portuguese accent , savoring its sound . The man of the house is a bit nervous . &quot; I ' m afraid I ' m going_to have to eat humble pie , &quot; Ronaldo admitted . &quot; I don ' t think the ( Italian ) coach brought_up enough forwards. &quot; In their house on a hill in Calabasas , the Pellegrinis ' international love_match plays itself out with a passion that only a true soccer fan could appreciate . The colors of Italy and the colors of Brazil hang from the mantle , held_in place by a host of soccer trophies won by two of the three Pellegrini girls . The children ' s television has also been put to use , installed at the family ' s Italian restaurant , Vittorio in Pacific Palisades , so they can follow the games -- and insult each other ' s teams -- while they work . And in the interest of familial harmony , the menu for Sunday ' s game-time shindig at_home has been planned with delicate diplomacy : Italian sausage and pizza for dinner , Brazilian briggadero and beijinho for dessert . * For both parties in the Pellegrini soccer feud , love of the game goes_back decades , and team loyalties preceded marital vows . Ronaldo , born in Chicago to Italian immigrants , acquired his voracious appetite for soccer during travels for the import-export business he still runs . Mercedes is a native of Sao Paulo , and although girls in Brazil seldom play the game , she said , she followed the local team as closely as any boy . &quot; In Brazil you ' re born with soccer . Every empty field , it ' s a soccer field , &quot; she said . The two have followed the World Cup since they were married , but with full television coverage available for the first time here this year , dozens of friends -- Brazilian and Italian -- have occupied the house for nearly a month , and the rooting has been especially heated . &quot; My wife is Brazilian through and through -- the hugging , the screaming , &quot; Ronaldo said , evidently under the impression that Italian soccer fans are known for their emotional restraint and cool detachment . Ronaldo has been forced on the defensive this year . Not only are the Brazilians playing better soccer than the Italians , he said mournfully , but he is outnumbered by Brazilian fans , 6 to 1 , in his own home . In addition to his wife , their three daughters ( even Sabrina , 15 , who was wearing an &quot; Italia &quot; shirt Friday ) , one granddaughter and the housekeeper are all rooting for the green and yellow . Said 17-year-old daughter Vanessa : &quot; I mean , Dad , I love you and everything , but it ' s Brazil. &quot; But he isn ' t surrendering early . &quot; Italians are lucky , &quot; he said , and could still pull_off a win come Sunday . Mercedes agreed that Italians are lucky , just not lucky enough in her opinion to beat her Brazilians . Although bets as high as $ 100 have changed hands from one Pellegrini to another on previous games , nothing is wagered on the Sunday finale -- nothing except bragging rights at least until the next World Cup , in their 28th year of marriage . &quot; We have so little in common , &quot; Mercedes said . &quot; Opposites attract , &quot; Ronaldo replied .</TEXT>
