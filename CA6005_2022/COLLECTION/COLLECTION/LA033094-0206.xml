   <HEADLINE> BRITAIN ENDS RESISTANCE ; EU OKS EXPANSION COMPROMISE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ending weeks of bitter wrangling , the 12 European Union countries forged a compromise Tuesday to end a dispute that has blocked plans for the group to expand to 16 nations . The breakthrough came not in Brussels but on the floor of the House of Commons in London , where British Prime_Minister John Major announced that Britain will end its refusal to accept changes in voting procedures considered an essential part of the enlargement . The European Parliament , which must ratify the terms of enlargement , had already made_it clear that it will not give its approval unless the procedures are altered . The planned changes , which would take_effect once the four new members joined , would make_it more difficult for a_few nations to block the will of the majority within the EU . While Major ' s comments were hardly enthusiastic , his shift of position removes a major obstacle to the planned Jan . 1 , 1995 , accession of Sweden , Finland , Norway and Austria . The compromise proposals &quot; meet many , though not all , of the government ' s concerns , &quot; Major told Parliament in a statement explaining his decision . Spain , which had also opposed the changes , agreed last weekend to go_along with them , leaving Britain isolated from the other 11 . Under the EU ' s vote distribution system , the 12 countries have a total of 76 votes , with large nations such_as Germany and Britain wielding 10 each , smaller nations having fewer and the smallest , Luxembourg , only two . Ambassadors from the EU ' s 12 members are scheduled to meet here today to formally endorse the changes , which will raise the minimum number of votes needed to block new legislation to 27 from the present 23 . Under terms of the compromise , the countries agreed to seek common_ground prior to a final vote , once a minority of 23 votes is reached , and to review the entire voting procedures again in 1996 . Britain also won written assurances that it would not be isolated under the new rules on any law related to social issues -- matters generally dealing with the EU ' s mandatory employee fringe_benefits , with which Britain has consistently refused to go_along . Despite Tuesday ' s breakthrough , the proposed enlargement still faces hurdles , including parliamentary votes and referendums in all four candidate countries on terms of entry into the Union . The addition of Austria and the three Scandinavian_countries would give an important push to the drive for greater European integration . It has been slowed by a series of factors , including the huge shifts that have swept the Continent since the Iron_Curtain fell more_than four years ago ; Europe ' s worst economic recession since the 1930s , and the rise of nationalistic sentiments in several countries . The presence of four rich new members would also put the EU in a far stronger position to reach_out -- later in the decade -- to struggling democracies in the formerly Communist east . That is a step many see as crucial for the Continent ' s long-term stability .</TEXT>
