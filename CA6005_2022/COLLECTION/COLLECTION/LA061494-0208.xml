   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; MYTH BUSTERS ; DON ' T BE BUGGED BY DRAFTS -- VIRUSES CAUSE COLDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was the kind of health information you never questioned . After all , it came from an authority -- not your doctor , but from your mom , your grandpa or maybe even your pal who once dated a med student . From time to time , we ' ll look_at these long-held health &quot; facts &quot; and answer the question -- sorry , Mom -- true or false . * &quot; Sitting in a drafty room increases your chance of catching cold. &quot; &quot; False , &quot; says Elliot Dick , professor of preventive_medicine at the University of Wisconsin Medical_School , Madison , and a longtime researcher of the cold virus . &quot; The draft would have to contain a virus that went_up your nose and attached_to a mucosal cell , &quot; he says . In other words , a draft doesn ' t give you a cold , a virus does . Once you have a cold , drafts don ' t make them worse , he adds , citing research by colleagues . * &quot; Get_out of those wet clothes before you catch your death. &quot; Forget it , Dick says . &quot; Wet clothes don ' t increase the risk of a cold , either. &quot; * &quot; Cranberry_juice will cure a urinary_tract infection. &quot; A recent study , published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn . and funded by Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. , suggests cranberry_juice can reduce bacteria in the urine . The Harvard researchers , who led the study , aren ' t certain how the juice might work , but speculate a chemical in it might deserve the credit . The researchers suggest more research . Until more data is in , cranberry_juice probably can ' t hurt , says Dr. Eila Skinner , USC assistant_professor of urology . But it won ' t necessarily rule_out the need to see a doctor , she adds : &quot; In adult women with symptoms of urinary_tract_infection , 50 % will clear without treatment , usually by drinking lots of fluid -- and if it happens to be cranberry_juice , great . Any liquid helps get_out the bacteria . If symptoms don ' t clear in two or three days , though , see a doctor. &quot; Antibiotics might be necessary . Infections in men and children can be associated with potentially serious disorders , so they should always see a doctor . * &quot; If a man isn ' t bald by age 30 , he probably never will be. &quot; Not true . &quot; Some people start balding later , &quot; says Dr. Bernard Raskin , a Valencia dermatologist and UCLA assistant clinical professor of medicine / dermatology . &quot; People who start balding earlier tend to lose more hair and become bald earlier , &quot; he says . &quot; People who lose hair later tend to lose_it more slowly . If they do become bald , it occurs at a later age. &quot; Raskin is often asked if baldness passed_through the mother ' s side of the family . His answer ? No . Laying_to_rest another misconception , he adds : &quot; There is no relationship between baldness and sexual potency , sterility or fertility. &quot;</TEXT>
