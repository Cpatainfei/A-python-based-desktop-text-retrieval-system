Dana was arrested June 14 at his home by sheriff ' s deputies who received a tip that the location was being used to store cloned cellular_telephones , which had been illegally altered so that calls made on them were charged to the numbers of legitimate telephone users . Deputies found four cloned cellular_telephones at Dana ' s residence , including one that had been reported stolen in Ventura County in February . Ellis ordered that the telephones seized at Dana ' s house be donated to the Sheriff ' s Department . JEFF SCHNAUFER</TEXT>
