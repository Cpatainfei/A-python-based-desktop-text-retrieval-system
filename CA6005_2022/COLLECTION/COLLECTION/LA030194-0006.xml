   <HEADLINE> THE APPEAL OF THE ZAPATISTAS ; REBELS STRIKE_HOME WITH CALL FOR POLITICAL REFORM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Mexican government may be close to a peace agreement with rebels in Chiapas that could have positive ramifications not just for that impoverished southern state but for all_of Mexico . For the last week negotiators representing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the Zapatista National Liberation Front have been meeting in Chiapas , trying to reach an accord to end the armed rebellion , which has claimed more_than 100 lives since it began Jan . 1 . Many of the issues under discussion are unique to Chiapas , where a rural , heavily Indian population is locked_in poverty stemming mainly from a near-feudal land ownership system . However , one of the rebel demands has resonated even with urban Mexicans : The Zapatistas want a more responsive , truly democratic political_system in Mexico . That has won them the support of intellectuals in Mexico_City , business people in Monterrey and ranchers in northern Mexico . Just as important , it has won the Zapatistas support from political_parties on both the left and right that have been frustrated for years over the stifling dominance of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI . The PRI has never lost a presidential election , and only rarely has it conceded defeat on the state or municipal level . That has led most Mexicans to cynically conclude that when the PRI can ' t win honestly , it simply steals elections . And even if that is not always true , the effect is to undermine faith in the political_system . In an effort to clean_up the PRI ' s image at_home and abroad , Salinas promised electoral reform before the presidential election next August . Although a_few reforms were made , critics say they did not go_far enough . Now Salinas reportedly has decided to call a special legislative session , as early as this week , to present a new reform initiative . The package will include placing international election observers at polling_stations , equal media access_time for all political_parties and putting the Federal Electoral Institute , which sets election rules and verifies all voting results , under nonpartisan control . Until now the institute has been controlled by the PRI . Any one of these steps would be a noteworthy break_with the past ; for example , accepting international election observers would mean swallowing national pride . As a package , they are unprecedented and impressive . Government sources deny that Salinas ' reform proposals have suddenly been revived because of the Chiapas rebellion , but the timing cannot be a coincidence . It is most unfortunate that it took bloodshed to get political reform in Mexico moving again . But what ' s important is that the process has begun anew . This time it must_not be stopped .</TEXT>
