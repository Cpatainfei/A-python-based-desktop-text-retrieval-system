   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; MEXICO HAS NO CAPITAL_OFFENSE ; GROUP E : NORWAY WINS , 1-0 , ON REKDAL ' S GOAL IN 85TH MINUTE . ALVES ' LATE HEADER HITS POST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A carnival of humanity with soccer as catalyst swept joyfully through the nation ' s capital Sunday . But Norway short-circuited the fiesta with a late goal that spoiled Mexico ' s first World Cup game since 1986 . The 1-0 final under brutal playing conditions at RFK Stadium -- 96 degrees at the start of the game -- established the credentials of both sides in Group E , the Cup ' s toughest division . But the outcome before a near-sellout crowd of 52 # 395 casts a shadow over Mexico ' s hopes of advancing beyond the first round . After the first Group E games , Norway and Ireland each have three points and Italy and Mexico have none . Italy will play Norway on Thursday at East Rutherford , N.J. , and Ireland and Mexico will play_at Orlando , Fla. , on Friday . In a stadium primped in red , white and green and throbbing for Mexico , the game , as advertised , pitted Latin finesse against Nordic strength . In the end , the big guys beat the little guys -- by the skin of their teeth . Playing a British-style zone defense and an offense based on long-pass counterattack , the Norwegians , one of the biggest teams in the tournament , were physically commanding , particularly in the air . Twice in the first_half , the ball went_in after scrums in front of the Mexican net . Both times , Hungarian referee Sandor Puhl disallowed the apparent Norwegian goals because of fouls . And twice he issued yellow cards to Norway for rough play . It was in the 85th minute that the Mexican defense finally yielded when midfielder Kjetil Rekdal deftly fielded a pass from Jan Age Fjortoft to climax a brisk Norwegian attack . Rekdal , who plays professional soccer in Belgium , cleanly beat Claudio Suarez and Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos with a right-footer to the left side of the net . &quot; We were lucky to get the goal , &quot; Norwegian Coach Egil Olsen said . &quot; They were tougher than we thought. &quot; Again and again , Mexican short-pass attacks down the middle were stopped by the Norwegian zone defense . Quick defenders and total control of the air spelled the difference for Norway . &quot; I ' ve come_to confirm what we already know . The Norwegians can be very obstructive , &quot; said Ireland Coach Jack Charlton , an interested spectator . After the Norwegian goal , the Mexicans , who outshot Norway , 14-10 , battled desperately for a tie . Led by strikers Luis Roberto Alves , Hugo Sanchez and Luis Garcia , they repeatedly pounded the flagging Norwegian defense . A header by Alves hit the right post in the closing moments and the rebound was cleared by the defense . &quot; It was a tough , hard-played game , &quot; Mexican Coach Miguel Mejia Baron said . &quot; I ' m proud_of how the Mexican players behaved on the field . We went_for three points and didn ' t get them . Now we know what we have to do_in the two remaining games. &quot; What Mexico lost on the field , it won in Washington . William Montana , selling oversized Mexico T-shirts outside the stadium , said Mexico was a euphemism Sunday . &quot; Anybody from south of the border is Mexican today , &quot; Montana said . &quot; None of us Latinos have ever had a chance to see our game played_at this level in the United States. &quot; When Antonio Chavez led a complex Mexican cheer on a Metro train at Washington ' s Foggy Bottom station , Peruvian Marco Chung smiled with delight at the American passengers watching nonplussed . &quot; Americans simply don ' t know what it ' s like to get_up for a big soccer game , &quot; Chung said . &quot; Chitiboom , chitiboom . . . . &quot; the Chavez chant began , &quot; . . . Mexico , Mexico , Rah , Rah , Rah ! &quot; &quot; Not a lot of atmosphere in the United States for soccer games , so we ' ll make our own atmosphere , &quot; said Chavez , who came from Mexico_City with six relatives and friends . Soccer player Frederick Roed , in from Oslo with friends , wore his team shirt in Norwegian national colors of red , blue and white , and watched with amusement as the Mexican legions paraded past him , jeering good-naturedly . &quot; We are fewer , but on the field we speak louder , &quot; Roed said . &quot; In fact , though , the atmosphere is very friendly , everywhere we have gone . We ' ve been playing soccer at Georgetown University every afternoon -- and we ' ve even found Americans to play with , &quot; Roed said .</TEXT>
