   <HEADLINE> YOUNG_WOMEN WITH BREAST_CANCER GRAPPLE WITH EXTRA DOSE OF DENIAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For five years , the pair had been inseparable , a dazzling combination of contrasting good looks : Gina Shafonsky , the sporty blond ; Lynne Stan , an elegant , leggy brunette . Called the &quot; Salt and Pepper Package &quot; by other models , they booked jobs in Hawaii , San Francisco and Las Vegas , and , in the process , became fast friends . &quot; It felt_like we were sisters , &quot; remembers Shafonsky of Newport Beach . &quot; We tried to sell ourselves together as a package , rather than individually . It was a great friendship. &quot; When Stan was diagnosed with breast_cancer at age 28 , Shafonsky was heartbroken . As Stan withered from the effects of the disease , Shafonsky stayed close . Stan died Nov . 14 , 1992 , just one month past her 30th birthday . She was survived by her mother and father , two brothers and a sister . And a dear friend . Shafonsky , now a volunteer for the American Cancer Society in Orange County , golfed Monday in Stan ' s memory at a breast_cancer benefit in Huntington Beach . &quot; I thought breast_cancer was for older_women , &quot; she says . &quot; I never knew it could touch someone so young. &quot; Breast_cancer , traumatic for women of any age , can be devastating for women in their 20s who may lack the life experiences and sturdy support_systems to help them cope_with the disease , experts say . Some young_women are learning of the dangers of breast_cancer and the importance of self-examination , regular doctor visits and -- for those with a family history of the disease -- early mammography . Experts in Orange County are trying to help by offering awareness programs and a new support group targeting young_women . &quot; Even though they are very small in number , ( young_women with breast_cancer ) are very important , &quot; says Hoda Anton-Culver , director of cancer surveillance at UC Irvine . &quot; . . . The number of years lost , the severity of the disease , the fact that it ' s . . . more ( often ) hereditary , make them more important to be looked_at for prevention and control. &quot; The American Cancer Society says one in nine women will develop breast_cancer in their lifetime and 46 # 000 women will die of the disease this year . The chances of contracting it depend_on a variety of factors , including age and family history . One percent of all breast_cancer victims are men . The risk of breast_cancer increases with age . Young_women , feeling less threatened by the disease , may slough off regular self-examinations and recommended checkups by their doctors , experts say . In addition , mammography -- the most powerful tool for early detection of breast_cancer -- is less effective in spotting potential cancers in young_women , because their breast tissue is so dense . Experts disagree about what risk factors should prompt young_women to have early mammographies . Dava F . Gerard , medical director of the Breast Health Center in Santa Ana , says young_women should consider themselves in a higher risk category if they have a sister or mother with the disease . Young African American women also have a higher incidence of breast_cancer , she says . Anton-Culver , who is also chief of epidemiology at UC Irvine ' s Department of Medicine , says women should also take into consideration an incidence of breast_cancer in aunts and grandmothers , on either side of the family . These young_women , she says , should pinpoint the age that their relative was diagnosed and schedule their first mammography 10 years before that age . Although it is an imperfect tool for cancer detection in young_women , that X-ray technique , combined with a careful breast examination , offers the best chance at early detection , she says , adding : &quot; If a young_woman has a positive familial history of breast_cancer , she should not dismiss that fact . She cannot say , ' I ' m too young for breast_cancer , ' because that is not true. &quot; American Cancer Society statistics say one woman in 2 # 426 will develop breast_cancer by age 30 ; by age 50 , that risk rises to one in 52 . Although the incidence of breast_cancer is lower for young_women , the stakes may in some ways be higher . Since young_women often do not consider themselves breast_cancer candidates , they may be diagnosed at a later stage when the disease is more aggressive and the mortality_rate is higher , Anton-Culver says . &quot; It ' s so shocking when it happens in women that young , &quot; says oncology nurse Nancy Raymon . &quot; It doesn ' t fit the norm. &quot; Raymon launched a breast_cancer support group at Western Medical_Center in Santa Ana this month . Although the group includes women in their early 40s , it will focus particularly on issues affecting women in their 20s and 30s , she says . Experts say the disease poses keen emotional trials for young_women , who are just beginning to establish their families , careers and romantic relationships . And although husbands are likely to stick_with their mates , young boyfriends very often do not . &quot; It ' s very difficult on a relationship to go_through aggressive treatment for cancer , &quot; says Donna Farris , who with Raymon is planning a breast_cancer survivor retreat called Healing Odyssey in Santa Barbara next month . &quot; that ' s kind of a repeated theme we ' ve heard among the younger women. &quot; Those who have not married yet may be especially horrified at the prospect of losing a breast . &quot; Lynne ( Stan ) couldn ' t even comprehend that , &quot; says her friend Shafonsky . &quot; In your 20s , you ' re still young and dating and your appearance is a little more important -- or you think it is -- than when you ' re in your 30s and you start to realize the physical appearance is not everything. &quot; Young mothers have the added burden of juggling children and chemotherapy treatments -- and with wondering what will become of their offspring if they die . Denial is not uncommon . La Trice Mack , then 27 , learned she had cancer in the milk ducts of her breasts on March 25 , 1993 . She had been bleeding from her right nipple for about three weeks but could not see it as something serious . &quot; I thought it was nothing , there was no lump , &quot; she says . Then , &quot; one day , it bled through my shirt at_work and the ladies I work with demanded I call my doctor. &quot; Even then , cancer did not occur to her . &quot; Cancer , right , yeah , &quot; she now says , in a tone sarcastic and disbelieving . &quot; That was the last thing on my mind. &quot; Mack ' s mastectomy and breast reconstruction was scheduled for May 10 , two days before her 28th birthday . Next , she underwent seven months of aggressive chemotherapy . &quot; I got really sick , &quot; she says . She spent a long_time in the hospital . &quot; I ' m a single parent . I was really having a hard time. &quot; Friends who &quot; just couldn ' t handle it &quot; began staying away , she says . Mack ' s young daughter moved_in with her parents . Because she has been taking tamoxifen -- a hormone blocker commonly given to women with breast_cancer -- the Van Nuys resident now experiences hot_flashes , night sweats and other symptoms of menopause . Being fast-forwarded into midlife is a jagged experience for one not yet through her 20s . And Mack , whose father had four sisters with breast_cancer , admits she has not made_peace with this new reality . &quot; It ' s like someone ' s pushing the remote_control , and it ' s not me , &quot; she says . &quot; Women our age are supposed to be so together in these times . We ' re supposed to be in control and very independent. &quot; Mack , who once bowled and taught aerobics , works as a hospital clerk and has enrolled in college and is hurriedly reading the classics , currently , John Steinbeck ' s &quot; Of Mice and Men. &quot; &quot; These are things I didn ' t do and I want to do_it , &quot; she says . &quot; I might not live to see 30 . I want to sky dive and bungee jump . I want to go_to Paris. &quot; In what could be another turn of bad news , Mack says recent tests indicate the cancer may have resurfaced in her body . On Friday , she plans to consult with a new doctor . &quot; There are other options , &quot; she says . &quot; I know there have to be other options. &quot; The American Cancer Society says that women 20 and older should do monthly breast self-examinations and that women 20 to 40 should be examined by their physicians every three years . Mammographies are recommended every one or two years for women from 40 through 49 and annually for women 50 and over . A base-line mammography should be done_by age 40 . Bruce Vancil , director of cancer control for the American Cancer Society in Orange County , says these guidelines are intended for women who have no symptoms and no known risk of breast_cancer . All other women should consult with their doctors to determine the appropriate screening schedule . Experts say that caught early , breast_cancer is more_than 95 % curable , using techniques such_as lumpectomy , radiation , mastectomy and chemotherapy . Stan , whose maternal aunt is a breast_cancer survivor , had fought the disease with chemotherapy , but it was a battle that did not begin until the disease had already progressed , her father , Lou Stan , says . &quot; The thought was there that we were going_to lose her , but we didn ' t want to face the reality it could happen , &quot; he says , squinting in the bright sunshine at the breast_cancer benefit Monday . &quot; She kept telling me she was going_to pull_out of it : ' Don ' t worry Dad. ' She was so strong , I couldn ' t believe it. &quot; Shortly before she died , Shafonsky and another friend took Stan to a waterfront restaurant for her 30th birthday dinner . She ordered prime rib , her favorite . She was thin and weak but ate most of her meal . &quot; We had a great day on the water , the sun was out , she was able to walk to and from the car , &quot; says Shafonsky . &quot; The will to live was amazing. &quot; Losing Stan has made Shafonsky -- and Stan ' s other young friends -- both sadder and wiser . They no longer feel immune to breast_cancer , a disease that had once seemed remote . &quot; I ' ve told all my girlfriends , &quot; says Shafonsky . &quot; We ' ve taught each other and told each other how to do the self-examination . It ' s unfortunate we lost Lynn , but we ' ve all learned a great_deal about breast cancer. &quot;</TEXT>
