   <HEADLINE> AS NATO BOMBS FALL , WESTERN DISARRAY WORSENS ; A FEW AIR STRIKES ARE NO SOLUTION TO THE BALKANS WAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nato warplanes on Wednesday bombed Serb missile sites in northwest Herzegovina and neighboring Croatia . The NATO action , the third air_raid in three days , came as a coordinated assault by Bosnian and Croatian Serbs threatened the destruction of Bihac , a Muslim town in a U.N.-declared &quot; safe area &quot; in northwest Bosnia . The attack was not described as a measure taken_in defense of Bihac , however , only as a retaliation for Serb missile attacks on British reconnaissance planes . This was for a clear if regrettable political reason : NATO does not attack except by request of the United Nations , and the world body fears that taking sides would provoke Serb attacks on UNPROFOR , the U.N. peacekeeping force . The British and French , having contributed the largest troop contingents to UNPROFOR ( the United States has contributed no troops ) , counsel restraint both in U.N. and NATO deliberations . The effect of the restraint , unfortunately , has been neither to rescue Bihac nor to moderate the aggression of the Bosnian Serbs . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has announced that his response to the NATO raids will be &quot; all-out war &quot; and revenge against UNPROFOR . On Wednesday , the Bosnian Serbs ordered U.N. officers at nine weapons-collection sites in Bosnia confined to quarters , presumably to permit the Serbs to reclaim the heavy_weapons previously surrendered under threat of NATO air_attack . The U.N. Bosnian mission chief , Yasushi Akashi , claimed Wednesday to have the support of Croatian Serb leader Milan Martic and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for a peace agreement of undisclosed terms , but Milosevic ' s armed forces are not participating in the assault , and Martic ' s forces could easily withdraw across the Croatian border and allow Karadzic ' s Bosnian Serbs to finish the assault . In short , NATO has managed only to make a bad situation worse and seems , dismayingly , to have demonstrated once again its virtual irrelevance in the Balkans war . Unlike the United Nations , NATO clearly does have the wherewithal to intervene decisively , but the political will to take military_action is lacking . No less important , however , than the impending slaughter in Bihac is the far less noticed horror being perpetrated in parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina where no shooting war is under way . Speaking_to the House of Commons , British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd , clearly referring to the outbreak of fighting around Bihac , said last week , &quot; This setback followed a period during which some signs of normal life returned to Bosnia. &quot; But just a week earlier Human_Rights Watch had published a well-documented study charging that &quot; the most savage and institutionalized ' ethnic cleansing ' today in northern Bosnia is taking_place in areas where there is no fighting. &quot; The report detailed frequent murders and beatings of non-Serbs . &quot; Ethnic cleansing &quot; means that women are terror-raped , men ( sometimes women too ) are enslaved , Serb soldiers and police are subject_to no civilian restraint and even the Serb Red_Cross engages in extortion . It is because this is the effective meaning of what Hurd referred to as &quot; a lull in the fighting &quot; that the fighting will inevitably recur . For the Bosnian Muslims , death is the consequence of peace no less than of war . The only question is whether the European powers will continue to ensure that the balance_of_power remains tipped toward the Serb side even as , in a strange charade , they engage in symbolic air strikes against the side they favor . U.S. proposals for military escalation now being made to the United Nations by U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright and to NATO by other U.S. officials are likely to be rejected , even as Republicans in Congress call_for unilateral U.S. action without facing the practical impossibility of U.S. action in Europe without European support . The disarray worsens daily , and , tragically , what is at stake is the survival not just of Bosnia but of NATO itself .</TEXT>
