   <HEADLINE> STABILIZING THE PESO -- AND SALINAS ' MEXICO ; COLOSIO ASSASSINATION ROCKS AMERICA ' S SOUTHERN NAFTA PARTNER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even before Wednesday ' s assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio in Tijuana , the 1994 Mexican presidential race was shaping_up as the most important vote_in that country since 1910 , when a disputed election set_off the bloody Mexican_Revolution . Now that a terrible act of violence has thrown Mexican politics into greater uncertainty and turmoil , Mexico ' s friends in the United States and elsewhere must stand_firm in support of outgoing President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the extraordinary progress he has come_to personify . Colosio , 44 , was Salinas ' handpicked choice to be the candidate of the powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which has won -- though not without allegations of fraud -- every Mexican presidential election since it was founded in 1929 . Salinas was counting_on Colosio , an economist who studied at the University of Pennsylvania , to carry_on his economic_policies , especially implementation of the historic North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Despite the controversy sur- rounding his selection , Colosio was acknowledged widely to be a capable and decent man ; his death is a loss to Mexico . The motive of Colosio ' s assassin is still uncertain , but the effects of the bloody deed are all too apparent . Although the Mexican stock_exchange and other financial_institutions were closed Thursday , a national day of mourning in Mexico , many financial analysts fear the assassination will set_back , at least in the short term , Mexico ' s economy , which slowly and painfully has been recovering from recession and runaway inflation . Coming_on the heels of a brief but bloody peasant rebellion in Chiapas and the recent kidnaping of a prominent Mexican banker , the murder of a leading presidential candidate can mean only added pressure on Mexico ' s still shaky finances . That is why the initial U.S._government reaction was reassuring . In addition to appropriate expressions of outrage and sympathy by President Clinton and the State_Department , Clinton met with Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to discuss details of a $ 6-billion line_of_credit to help stabilize the Mexican_peso . Also extremely helpful was Clinton ' s statement that the U.S._government believes Mexican institutions are &quot; fundamentally strong &quot; and will ride_out that nation ' s current political turmoil . Such expressions of confidence are vitally important now , not just statements from Washington but demonstrations of confidence from Los Angeles , New York and the many other financial_centers where investors eagerly have pursued business opportunities in Mexico these last few years . Investors have needed a safe , stable environment in Mexico for their investments , and Salinas largely delivered . The recent troubles in the southern state of Chiapas are less an indication that his free-market policies failed than a reminder of just how much still needs to be done to bring Mexico from the Third_World to the First -- politically as well as economically . Salinas and the new generation of young political_leaders he brought into the Mexican government -- a generation in which Salinas and Colosio were seen as bright lights -- have earned the world ' s confidence . They have had the intelligence and foresight to begin to reform a moribund , state-dominated economy . They have had the political courage to do_it with speed and scope that were unprecedented -- and sometimes breathtaking . Mexico ' s foreign friends now must show similar farsightedness and courage as Salinas and his colleagues try to contain a political crisis that is unique in the nation ' s history . If Salinas ' record is any indication , he will move decisively to resolve the turmoil . He will need time , but he and his generation have come too far , and taken Mexico too far , to turn_back now . The United States must stand shoulder to shoulder with its good neighbor , helping Mexico through a very difficult passage .</TEXT>
