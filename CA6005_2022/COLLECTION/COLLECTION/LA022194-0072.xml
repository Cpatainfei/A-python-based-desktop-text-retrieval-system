   <TEXT> An intense winter downpour , the third major storm to hit the region in two weeks , on Sunday triggered a traffic accident in Anaheim that killed a San Luis Obispo County couple and critically injured three others -- including the couple ' s two teen-age children . The rain also caused minor flooding in some areas of Dana Point , forced the brief closure of a section of Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach and , to the north , left Malibu residents once again digging_out of mud and debris that surged down rain-soaked hillsides . In Orange County , the storm ' s wrath turned deadly about 7:10 a.m. as Joseph Franklin Reagan , 50 , and his wife , Linda Lee , 42 , of Los Osos traveled east in their van near Gypsum Canyon Road on the Riverside Freeway in Anaheim . A California Highway Patrol spokeswoman said the van was traveling about 65 m.p.h. in heavy rain when Joseph Reagan lost_control of the vehicle , which slid across three lanes before broadsiding a semitrailer truck . The couple , who were wearing seat_belts , were pronounced dead at the scene . Their son , Joseph Charles , 18 , and daughter , Wendi Lee , 15 , suffered multiple injuries and were rushed to UCI Medical_Center in Orange . A third passenger in the Reagan van , identified as Sarah Burns , 15 , was taken_to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana . All three were listed in critical condition . The CHP spokeswoman said the truck ' s driver , Richard August Thayer , 34 , was not injured . Thayer had just delivered a load of milk in Santa Ana and was heading back to his home_in Ontario when the collision occurred , according to the CHP . Apart from the tragedy in Anaheim , Sunday ' s heavy rains prompted renewed fears of mudslides in Laguna Beach after mud cascaded over the hillsides onto Laguna Canyon Road . Officials were forced to close_off the roadway for about an hour from the San Diego Freeway to Coast Highway . &quot; We had mud and water coming_across the road to such a degree that it was making_it unsafe for vehicles to pass , &quot; said Officer Joh Fehlman . Police said no homes_in the area were in danger , but as a precaution , Red_Cross officials opened a temporary evacuation center at Laguna Beach High_School , which remained virtually empty throughout the day . Accustomed to mudslide scares , most Laguna Beach residents chose to remain in their homes . The minor flooding in Dana Point consisted_of overflowing of some flood_control channels , officials said . The heavy rains kept police and fire officials busy with minor traffic accidents and calls_for service throughout the day . In Fullerton , firefighters were called_out to rescue a German_shepherd_dog that was swept down a flood_control channel by angry floodwaters . With the help of fire and police units , an animal control officer managed to snare the frightened dog near Dale Street . The dog ' s &quot; nails were all bleeding because she was dragged along the cement walls &quot; by the rushing water , said Ray Easley , a Fullerton Fire_Department battalion chief . &quot; She was so glad to be out of there. &quot; Bruce Thoren , a meteorologist with WeatherData , said Santa Ana received the most rainfall in Orange County , 1.53 inches . Newport Beach received . 86 of an inch , Anaheim recorded . 84 and . 7 fell_in El Toro . Figures for South County weren ' t available . Thoren said there was a 30 % chance of isolated showers this morning , but no other rainfall is predicted for the first_half of the week . Elsewhere , the powerful cloudbursts Sunday forced a brief closing of Interstate 5 at the Grapevine . The showers dropped up_to three inches of rain along some parts of the coast and up_to a foot of snow in the mountains . The two deaths in Orange County weren ' t the only traffic fatalities : An unidentified man was killed Sunday morning when his car skidded out of control on the westbound Artesia Freeway near the Lakewood Boulevard intersection in Bellflower . The man , who was not wearing a seat_belt , died when he was thrown from his car . The rain was also blamed for two power outages Sunday that left more_than 1 # 600 Southern California Edison customers in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica without electricity for two hours , an Edison spokesman said . In Malibu , rescue workers raced Sunday to evacuate residents whose homes were threatened by the movement of water , mud and rocks toward the sea . Garages and front_doors of more_than 50 homes along Pacific Coast Highway were inundated . Los Angeles County lifeguards and sheriff ' s deputies used ropes to rescue Christa Roberts and her two sons , ages 9 and 10 , from their home on Carbon Canyon Road , where a river of water about 4 feet deep and 15 feet wide swept down the canyon , blocking their escape . Nasier Filippin , a Big Rock resident who was_on his way to the ski slopes , refused to leave his Mercedes-Benz when it became mired in the mud near the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Big Rock Drive . Filippin sat in the vehicle for nearly an hour and a half as the fast-moving water crept halfway up the silver car . Filippin was finally plucked to safety by a lifeguard who was lowered to the vehicle by the scoop of a CalTrans caterpillar . Standing under an umbrella on a stack of sandbags across from his car , Filippin said : &quot; I ' m very upset . Honest to God , I don ' t want to talk_about it. &quot; On Sunday , Caltrans skip loaders worked_at scooping_up the muck , filling dump_trucks that unloaded the ooze over the side of the highway and down to the ocean at Las Flores Canyon Road and Big Rock Drive . Officials closed the highway between Topanga Canyon Road and Cross Creek Road . At Las Flores Canyon Road and Pacific Coast Highway , an enormous mudflow filled the parking_lot and part of the interior of the Charley Brown ' s Sea_Lion Restaurant , and flowed into the ground_floor of a nearby five-unit , two-story apartment complex . &quot; We thought we had it made because we didn ' t get_it in the other disasters , but it just came_through our bedroom , broke the wall open , &quot; said a woman who lived_in a ground-floor apartment with her husband and asked not to be named . &quot; We couldn ' t get the door open , but we finally got_out . Everything is gone. &quot; A number of residents whose homes were hit in the Feb . 7 storm , which damaged at least 25 homes , found their homes inundated again by Sunday ' s rain . Times staff writers John L . Mitchell and Tammerlin Drummond contributed to this story .</TEXT>
