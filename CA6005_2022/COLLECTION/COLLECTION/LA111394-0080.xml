   <TEXT> There will be no last-minute reprieve for smallpox , no candlelight protest of supporters outside its guarded prison . A scourge of humanity for more_than 3 # 500 years , smallpox has just eight months to live before it is burned like a medieval witch . Death will come early on June 30 as scientists , dignitaries and public health officials in Atlanta and Russia oversee the first deliberate destruction of a species so vile it has been called &quot; Spotted Death &quot; and &quot; The Great Fire. &quot; The execution date was set_in September by a panel of scientists with the World_Health_Organization who believe that , if the smallpox_virus somehow escaped , it could wreak havoc on an unvaccinated world . Some researchers object to deliberately destroying an entire species of virus , particularly one that might teach them how to fight other diseases . But scientists have produced harmless clones of DNA fragments of the smallpox_virus and are satisfied they have the full genetic blueprint . Few , other_than researchers interested in smallpox , will mourn the loss of the virus . &quot; The only reason one might be concerned would be losing a biological species from the Earth deliberately , &quot; said Dr. Brian Mahy of the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . &quot; I can see the argument whether man has the right to protect his species from another . To wipe_out a species is always a concern. &quot; The death sentence affects all_of the known remaining stocks of smallpox , about 400 samples locked_in special freezers at the CDC in Atlanta and another 200 or so at Russia ' s State Research_Center of Virology and Biotechnology . Smallpox killed up_to 600 # 000 people a year in Europe from the 16th Century through the 18th Century . A vaccine was discovered in the 1790s , but it took nearly 200 years of immunizations to wipe smallpox out . The virus ' s own lifestyle played a large role in the success of a worldwide effort to eradicate it within three decades . &quot; The virus has a remarkable propensity to spread from human to human , &quot; Mahy said . &quot; It ' s a virus that can be spread by . . . a blanket from a person with lesions to another person . &quot; The problem the virus had was that it had only one host -- which was a human . Viruses which have only a single host . . . in theory are eradicable , because it ' s possible to eradicate all_of the virus from humans and then the virus gets lost from the world. &quot; All it takes is a government-issued autoclave to kill smallpox forever , a process that will take two hours , according to guidelines developed by WHO . New equipment will not be purchased , Mahy said . &quot; We autoclave masses of glassware , tubes of various types , in_order to sterilize it , &quot; said Mahy , who will help oversee smallpox ' s destruction . Smallpox will spend its last minutes alongside plates of sturdy bacteria , whose death will confirm that smallpox is no more . The execution will be watched by officials at both labs via satellite , and it probably will be videotaped . Those present will be vaccinated against the dreaded illness . The CDC ' s stock is kept_in a liquid_nitrogen freezer in Room 318B in a maximum-security laboratory building near the Emory University campus . The last civilian to see the room , a reporter for the London Times , said in 1991 that the samples were kept_in a silvery blue freezer that is chained , padlocked and wrapped with yards of duct tape . Under elaborate security measures -- the CDC won ' t give exact details -- the virus will be taken from the freezer to the autoclave . The researchers will wear pressurized spacesuits as they pass the test_tubes into a large autoclave built into the wall . The autoclave will automatically heat_up to 266 degrees Fahrenheit for 40 minutes and then repeat the process . Its cycle cannot be stopped . When the cycle is complete , scientists will remove the incinerated smallpox samples and bacteria from the back of the machine , and their deaths will be confirmed . &quot; It ' s extremely encouraging from a public health point_of_view that it ' s so simple to kill smallpox , &quot; Mahy said . The last case of naturally occurring smallpox was in Somalia in 1977 . Experts have recommended since 1986 that the virus be eliminated to prevent its accidental release or its use as a biological weapon . Recent advances in gene sequencing bolstered that argument . CDC researchers have now mapped three strains of the smallpox_virus , creating a library of information that once would have been available only from the virus itself . The decision to rid the world of smallpox has not received final approval , but it is mostly just a formality . The final sentence will come_in May at a meeting of WHO ' s full assembly of 180 countries . The WHO panel that recommended smallpox ' s destruction has also suggested that 500 # 000 doses of smallpox vaccine be kept_on hand for emergencies , should the virus crop_up from an unknown source .</TEXT>
