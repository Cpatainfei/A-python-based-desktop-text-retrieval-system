   <HEADLINE> TOP PRIORITIES : PREVENTION , EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dr. David Satcher , new director for the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention , has four priorities : * First , he wants to strengthen the agency ' s core public health functions -- the kinds of activities that are largely invisible until they fail -- that is , when there is an outbreak of food_poisoning , or contaminated water makes people sick or some new mysterious illness gets a grip on the population . &quot; I don ' t think the nation has really supported these functions because nobody gets excited about the fact that you prevented somebody from dying , &quot; he says . * He wants to increase the focus_on urgent threats to health , including emerging or re-emerging infections such_as tuberculosis , by beefing_up global surveillance and tracking . &quot; We are a global agency , &quot; he says . &quot; Viruses and bacteria don ' t respect borders . They don ' t need passports or visas. &quot; * He seeks more attention on prevention -- in programs to prevent the spread of AIDS , for example , and in widespread immunization programs to protect children from preventable diseases , and in programs to encourage Americans to exercise more . He expects the agency to work closely with states , local_governments and the private sector to establish prevention programs and incentives to practice preventive measures . &quot; One-half to two-thirds of deaths in this country every year are preventable , &quot; he says . * He hopes to steer the agency to a new emphasis on women ' s health , which he describes as &quot; an area of neglect , &quot; through prevention and education . He includes workplace and domestic violence against women as part of this package , as well as more education and prevention programs for sexually transmitted diseases , and breast and cervical cancers . Although much of this agenda comes as a result of his personal and professional experiences , there is more . &quot; I ' ve called these evolving priorities , &quot; he says . &quot; They come from a combination of my personal background and CDC ' s background , coming_to understand CDC ' s history and its strengths and weaknesses . &quot; I ' ve done a lot of listening since I ' ve been at CDC . I ' ve had a lot of briefings . And I ' ve read the history of CDC more_than once . These priorities are not just what I am , but what CDC is. &quot;</TEXT>
