   <HEADLINE> BEWARE THOSE CONS IN CHARITY ' S CLOTHING ; INVESTIGATE TO MAKE SURE YOUR HOLIDAY GOODWILL REACHES ITS INTENDED DESTINATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the better aspects of the holiday season is the impulse to give , not necessarily another tie for a father or a toy for a child but money in the Salvation_Army bell_ringer ' s bucket and a_few cans of food in the collection barrel at_work . Unfortunately , the charitable feelings out there during the season are no secret to the con_artists either . Warnings to be sure money given by people in Orange County goes as intended have been appropriate . Karen McGlinn , director of the Costa Mesa-based charity Share Our Selves , said one man recently set_up shop in front of a grocery_store and solicited contributions he said would go_to SOS . As McGlinn correctly noted , agencies like hers cannot know who may be out there using their names . But there are precautions that should be taken . Charitable organizations recommend not giving money to door-to-door solicitors . Ask_for an envelope and an address so the donation can be mailed . Telephone the organization and see if the solicitor really represented it . If you haven ' t heard of the group , check with the county Better Business Bureau or the National Charities Information Bureau in New York . In addition , the state_attorney general ' s office maintains a list of charities that have registered in California . Orange County long has had the unfortunate title of telephone fraud capital of the nation . The scam artists know many residents are wealthy , and the warm weather and amenities are as attractive to criminals as_to the law-abiding . The Orange County district_attorney ' s office said most complaints it received about consumer fraud stem from telephone solicitors fraudulently claiming to represent legitimate groups . Sometimes hustlers dial for dollars from the unwary by using names similar to those of reputable organizations . The more brazen ask that gifts be made in cash , and offer to send someone over to pick it up . Ask_for information in_writing , and when it arrives , check for a listing of what percentage of the funds are used for programs and services , and what percentage for fund-raising and administrative costs . Orange County has had a good record of helping charities , though in recent years it has been more difficult because of the recession and job losses , including some at corporations that were major benefactors of groups helping the needy . The desire to help_out is noble at any time_of_year , but it unfortunately requires caution to make_sure that dollars reach their intended destination .</TEXT>
