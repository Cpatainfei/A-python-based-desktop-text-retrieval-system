   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; PAMELA HARRIMAN ; ON HAVING AN AFFINITY FOR POWER ; ON BEING THE IDEAL U.S. AMBASSADOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When President Bill_Clinton gave a political fund raiser and Washington hostess the plum job of ambassador to France , few doubted Pamela Harriman deserved the reward . The surprise is that she has turned_out to be uniquely qualified for the job . Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman , a force in the Democratic Party and early supporter of Clinton , has been the U.S._government ' s envoy in Paris for 18 months , presiding over the large embassy staff and handling weighty economic and military matters . But perhaps more important , her skills as a political insider , her close links to Clinton , her fluency in French , her sense of style and her ease in international drawing_rooms have made this British-born aristocrat a favorite of French business and political_leaders . Indeed , at age 74 , Harriman ' s extraordinary life , which has intersected with many of the world ' s most famous and powerful men , seems to have been one long preparatory_school for this job . Married to Winston Churchill ' s son , Randolph , she lived at No . 10 Downing Street during World_War_II , often serving as the prime_minister ' s hostess . ( Her stories of Gen . Charles de Gaulle ' s visits to the Churchill home never fail to impress her French hosts. ) She was later married to Broadway producer Leland Hayward and , after his death , to W . Averell Harriman , presidential adviser and Democratic political heavyweight who died in 1986 . She was also romantically linked over the years with other important men , including CBS newsman Edward R . Murrow , Italian car magnate Gianni Agnelli and French aristocrat , Baron Elie de Rothschild . From the early 1980s until Clinton ' s election , she was an important figure in the Democratic Party , founding a political-action committee and hosting regular &quot; issues evenings &quot; that helped shape party strategy and policy . An unauthorized biography of Harriman , &quot; The Life of the Party , &quot; published earlier this year , portrays her as a calculating courtesan who targeted rich and powerful men , &quot; parlaying her ambition and talents into a vast fortune and major political clout. &quot; The ambassador refuses to talk_about the book . And , through her attorney , she denies claims made in a recent lawsuit filed by 19 Harriman heirs , who accuse the ambassador and other trustees of Averell Harriman ' s estate of mismanaging $ 25 million in trust_funds . Neither the lawsuit nor her past romances bother the_French , though . In fact , her life_story only seems to gild her reputation as a political insider . An invitation to lunch is coveted by the high and mighty in French politics and culture . Visitors to the ambassador ' s residence are treated to orchid-filled rooms and part of her impressive personal art_collection , which includes works by Picasso , Matisse and Cezanne , as well as the formidable &quot; White Roses , &quot; by Van Gogh . Talking in her large office on a recent rainy Paris afternoon , she discussed everything from French-U.S. relations_to the attributes of powerful men in a strong voice , lightly accented by her British heritage . * Question : What is it the_French have trouble understanding about America ? Answer : One of my principal efforts ever since I got here has been to make them understand the power of our Congress , because under their system , there is no such power . It does not exist . . . . When French ministers visit Washington , I ' ve tried to convince them to meet with people on the_Hill . . . . But it has been interesting how difficult it is to make others understand the political division between the Administration and Congress . Q : Are there any other areas ? A : Of non-understanding ? Yes , especially in the cultural area . Films for us are commercial and for them , they ' re culture . And there is a disagreement and a misunderstanding , quite understandably , about that . Of course , our films are so enormously popular in France . . . . But our film magnates are really trying to do more to involve French producers , directors and actors . The world today is global and we ' ve got_to start looking_at it through that vision . There is a problem , but this can be addressed , and I think we are probably taking the lead in doing that . Q : On the other side of the coin , do you find yourself having to clear_up misunderstandings in Washington about French politics ? A : that ' s why embassies exist , to report back to Washington what we see as the feeling that is prevailing in our respective countries . We must realize where they ( the_French ) are coming from ; it ' s often not evil intentions but natural traditions . The Atlantic is a very large space of water . One of the things about France today is that it ' s really emerging as a high-tech country . It is no longer the country of wine and perfume . It ' s the country of Airbus , satellites , the TGV ( high-speed trains ) . And I think that is putting France in kind of a different category in the global thick of things . Q : Are the_French beginning to take Clinton more seriously ? A : At first , they didn ' t know him , and they may have been apprehensive that they had read that he was a domestic President . But everyone here was really extraordinarily impressed with him the first time he came_to Europe . And when he came_to Paris in June , they were absolutely bowled_over . Some of the_French have said to me , &quot; You know , this is the first time we ' ve seen an American President who really could discuss Europe and had a vision for Europe. &quot; They found it exciting . People at_home forget that this is the first President who has had a European education . He was at Oxford ; he did travel as a student over here . So he ' s had an appreciation . And I must tell you that the first time that my late husband , Averell Harriman , and I got_to know the young governor from Arkansas , which was , I guess , ' 79 or ' 80 , he impressed us because he was so very interested in European history , talking with Averell about World_War_II , and ( Josef ) Stalin and ( Winston ) Churchill and ( Charles ) de Gaulle . So I ' ve always known that he had an interest and understanding of global affairs . Q : Is it possible , in these times , for a President to maintain a high approval rating over a long period_of_time ? A : that ' s what history is going_to tell us . But I suspect that this is a particularly difficult moment in history . He has , I believe , a very good vision of the problems . But there are volcanoes going_off all_over the world . Anybody can pick a quarrel with any agreement , you and I know that . But the thing is to get things moving , to get them on track , to get them going the way we want them to go and I think we have a President who is committed to that . It ' s showing , and the world is beginning to see . You know , it ' s awesome to be the one superpower in the world . ( But ) I really think the President is showing his good , true colors . Q : You have known some of the most important world leaders of this century . Is there some common_denominator ? A : It basically comes_down to very simple components . There are many , many clever and brilliant people . But to be a public figure , a leader on the world stage , you have to first of all have an extraordinary health and physical strength . I ' ve known many leaders , and all_of the greats have had an outstanding physical capacity -- a capacity to endure . And it sounds silly , but I think that is a very , very important component , and we see that in the President today . However brilliant you are , unless you are blessed with a health that gives you that extra endurance , that extra energy . . . . and Churchill had it -- even FDR ( Franklin D . Roosevelt ) had it , with all his physical problems . That goes all through . They all had it . Q : Are there other qualities ? A : Great men have to know how to delegate . I remember Churchill saying once , when talking_about his own Cabinet , that unless people know how to delegate , they can ' t administer . I suspect there ' s a great_deal of truth in that . Q : Is it important , too , to be able to listen ? A : Yes , that was one of the great strengths of Jack_Kennedy , that he would get his wise_men in around him , and would listen to all_of their points_of_view , then he would make_up his own mind . But he would listen to all_of them first . And that ' s a trick of a leader , isn ' t it ? Q : Who have been your teachers in the art of diplomacy ? A : When you get_to my age , you ' ve known a lot of people , you ' ve seen a lot of things , and I ' m privileged . One of the fascinating things for me about this 50th anniversary year of the D-day landings was , in a sense , that I was there 50 years ago . To be in this position 50 years later is kind of wonderful . I remember that long wait we had for the invasion . And that ' s when I understood the leadership of ( Gen . Dwight D. ) Eisenhower , because , whatever history writes or does , we knew that Ike made that decision alone . Of course , it turned_out to be absolutely the right decision . Q : But on the question of your teachers ? A : There are always little things that happen , and I suddenly remember what so-and-so said , or what Churchill might have said or what Averell had told me about Stalin . . . . You can ' t sort of pinpoint it really , but there have been many years of having been privileged to listen to great men in many situations . I think it also gives one balance . Q : What do you mean by that ? A : People always say , &quot; It ' s the worst of times , &quot; and we think we have so many problems , but , you know , there have always been deep problems . And the nearer you are to the center , the more those problems are obvious . Politically , one of the lessons to me -- which is something which history really doesn ' t record -- is that when Churchill became prime_minister in May , 1940 , and moved_into Downing Street , there were many , many times in the next five years when he went_down to the House of Commons and didn ' t know whether they would throw him out . You read history and everybody says , &quot; Well , Churchill was all-powerful and he was a great leader of the war. &quot; But when you knew the inside story , there were bad moments in the war . The Conservative_Party wasn ' t always on his side , and there were certain elements that would have been perfectly happy to see him removed during the war . And all these things are very interesting when you put them in a modern context . Q : Congress is_due to take_up GATT in the coming weeks . How crucial is its passage ? A : It is very , very important that it pass -- for America and for our economy . It will bring us a strong , reliable trading system , worldwide income and job-generating opportunities . It would really be a disaster if , after seven years of hard work , this was not ratified . The rest of Europe is waiting for us . Q : What is your assessment of the_French leaders of today ? A : They ' re very different from the_French politicians I knew in the ' 50s . Q : In what way ? A : Well , they ' re much more outgoing , they ' re much more individualist . I guess , you know , modern technology brings them more into the public arena , television and all_of that . Q : Does anything in Europe surprise you today ? A : What is surprising to me is how little it has changed and yet how well it has modernized itself . If you take this city , which is perhaps one of the most beautiful cities in the world , it is better than it was 30 years ago when I lived here . The buildings have been cleaned , the lighting at night is extraordinary . What is fascinating to me is the fact that a president here can spend a lot of money doing over the Louvre , which all comes_out of the taxpayers ' pockets , and everybody is happy about it , proud_of it and applauds it . This is kind of comforting that , in the difficult world we live_in , people are still prepared to let their governments do these things . It isn ' t building extravagance ; it ' s really keeping the culture and heritage . You know the_French traditions ; we can get sometimes very annoyed by &quot; les traditions , &quot; but it is a big force in this country . Q : What ' s been your biggest challenge here ? A : I think really the challenge has been to find_out how I can best interpret the_French to us in America , to us in Washington . And that ' s where perhaps I have an advantage , being European-born . Q : Do you find the demands of the job particularly taxing ? A : Listen , if a job is dull , it ' s long and grueling . If it ' s exciting , it ' s really a pleasure . Every day is different , you ' re dealing with a lot of different things and it is just very fascinating . I ' m privileged to be here . Q : Has the publication of the unauthorized biography of you , &quot; Life of the Party , &quot; affected the way you function here ? A : No , absolutely not . Why should it ? We ' re far removed from any of that kind of nonsense .</TEXT>
