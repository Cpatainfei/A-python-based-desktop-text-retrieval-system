   <TEXT> The UC Santa Barbara Arts and Lectures series begins a distinguished selection of fall films this week . OK , maybe the blockbuster film &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; is more commercial than it is distinguished . But there ' s a plus . Academy Award-winning animator Phil Tiptett will present a video on how the special_effects were created . The video will be shown after the main feature . Tiptett will also answer questions . The rest of the films in the series you ' ve probably seen before , but like &quot; Belle Epoque , &quot; &quot; Red Rock West &quot; and &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; they ' re good_enough to see again . All films start at 7 p.m. Tickets are $ 5 and available at the door . For more information call 893-3535 . * Feeling_like your circadian_rhythms are upside down ? Maybe you want to watch a really weird film , the kind usually screened as the midnight feature . But you can ' t stay awake after 10 p.m. , you say ? Well the Riviera Theatre has the answer_for the diurnal lover of cult films . The theater last week launched its &quot; Cult Classics &quot; festival , all_of them screening at the unlikely hour of 11 a.m. on Saturday . Imagine watching &quot; Pink Flamingos &quot; and exiting the theater into the cheery sunlight of a Santa Barbara afternoon . This week ' s feature is &quot; The Loved One , &quot; starring Jonathan Winters and Rod Steiger . Riviera manager Terry Boyle calls it a movie with something to offend everyone . Boyle said there are eight movies in the lineup . Still to come are &quot; Deliverance &quot; ; &quot; Repulsion , &quot; starring Catherine Deneuve in a Roman Polanski film ; &quot; The Producers , &quot; featuring the hit single &quot; Springtime for Hitler &quot; and , of course , the cult film of all cult films , David Lynch ' s &quot; Eraserhead. &quot; &quot; We ' re trying to have more theme nights , &quot; Boyle said . &quot; Whether it ' s cult classics , films by the same director or films with the same star. &quot; * On the topic of films with the same actor , here ' s an item for lovers of esoteric character_actors . The Ojai Film Society is showing movies featuring Jim Broadbent over the next two Sundays . Who ' s Jim Broadbent ? He played the sympathetic bartender in the &quot; Crying Game. &quot; Check him out_in &quot; Widow ' s Peak &quot; on Sunday and in &quot; The Wedding_Gift &quot; on Oct . 16 . Shows are 4:30 at the Ojai Playhouse .</TEXT>
