   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : SOME CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS JUST PLAIN FALSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One challenging aspect to investing is that the ground_rules seem to change soon after you master them . Just when you think you have the principles and theories figured_out , somebody comes_along and upsets the conventional-wisdom apple cart . It seems as if studies , surveys and statistics are always coming_out to question the consensus view on this or that aspect of mutual_fund investing . Presented below are four conventional-wisdom tidbits that have come under recent scrutiny . * Avoid high-turnover funds . Turnover is the rate at which fund managers buy and sell stocks or bonds for their portfolios . A rate of 100 % would imply that each security is replaced once a year on average , while 200 % would indicate the entire portfolio gets revamped every six months or so . Many financial advisers recommend that investors steer clear of funds with turnover_rates of 150 % to 200 % or higher , because such heavy trading activity would tend to drive_up costs to shareholders . Yet the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey came_to a somewhat different conclusion after studying the performance of more_than 500 domestic stock portfolios during the last five years , with emphasis given to the 1990 bear_market . &quot; Contrary to popular belief , high turnover can be a positive trait in an aggressive equity fund , &quot; argues the New York publication . One explanation suggested by Value Line is that high turnover managers are able to react more quickly to changing investment climates . But Value Line also found that low turnover managers enjoyed the edge when it came_to more conservative types of stock funds . ( Bond portfolios were not studied. ) In support of the conventional wisdom , the publication cautioned investors to view turnover as a secondary rather than primary consideration when choosing among mutual_funds . * The rush of bank customers and other novice investors into mutual_funds will destabilize the financial markets . This notion has become widespread recently in the wake of the fund industry ' s rapid_growth . Particularly worrisome was a January report from the North_American Securities Administrators Assn . and the American Assn . of Retired Persons that found that the &quot; vast majority &quot; of bank customers fail to realize that mutual_funds sold at banks do not carry federal insurance . But Donald P . Morgan , senior economist at the Federal_Reserve_Bank of Kansas City , has found little evidence to suggest that the markets have become more volatile , even with a larger mutual_fund presence . Nor should Americans be considered such investment novices , he maintains . While the ownership of stock and bond mutual_funds has surged , direct ownership of securities has declined . The net result : Households now hold about the same share of their financial assets in_stock and bond investments as in the 1950s and ' 60s , Morgan wrote in a recent report . He dismisses the idea that investors are fickle and will flee the markets during a downturn . Instead , the recent shift into stock and bond funds is primarily explained by demographic trends . &quot; The share of household assets in_stocks and bonds follows very closely the share of workers aged 35 or older , &quot; Morgan argues . &quot; As workers age and begin to contemplate retiring , they save more and their investment horizon stretches. &quot; Pressed by the need to build_up a retirement nest_egg , investors are willing to accept greater short-term risks in exchange for superior long-term returns , which explains the shift toward stock and bond funds and away from traditional bank products . * No-load investors are less likely to hang tough in rough markets than people working with a broker or financial planner . Because do-it-yourself investors don ' t receive hand-holding from a financial professional , they ' re less inclined to ride_out storms , the theory goes . A correlating and more cynical argument is that investors in load funds stay_put because they recently paid a commission or would face one to redeem shares . There is truth to these notions , yet no-load investors hardly abandoned ship during the rough first_half of 1994 , when domestic stock funds tumbled 5.8 % and bond funds fell 3.5 % on average . In fact , &quot; direct-marketed &quot; funds , which are primarily commission-free products , have gained about one percentage_point in market share at the expense of their load rivals over the past year , according to data compiled by the Investment_Company Institute in Washington . They ' ve gained four points of market share over the last four years . More telling from a tough-times standpoint , direct-marketed funds accounted_for 44.6 % of total sales ( excluding reinvested dividends ) during the first_half of 1994 but only 41.5 % of redemptions . By contrast , funds marketed by commissioned salespeople accounted_for 55.4 % of first-half sales but 58.5 % of redemptions . Six months of poor results might not be a sufficiently long period to scare investors into the arms of brokers . Yet these numbers also suggest that the commission-free share of the business is growing -- and that do-it-yourself investors are more resilient than skeptics think . * Avoid new mutual_funds . One compelling reason to shun upstarts is that there are plenty of proven portfolios out there , so why take chances ? A second rationale involves cost : If a new fund is unable to attract many investors , its pro rata expenses will stay fairly high , eating_into shareholder returns . But a separate Value Line study found some evidence to suggest that avoiding new funds might not always be a wise policy . The publication determined that new stock portfolios have a &quot; strong tendency &quot; to outperform their more-established peers during the first full calendar_year of a fund ' s existence . The explanation is that new and thus smaller funds might be_better able to take_advantage of attractive initial stock offerings . In support of this view , Value Line discovered that the first-year edge is most pronounced among mutual_funds that invest in small companies . The upshot of this study is that investors should keep an open mind toward new stock funds , especially those run_by established portfolio managers , according to Value Line . But the publication found little evidence to suggest that new bond funds were bargains . * It might be a case of putting the cart before the horse , but the Templeton Vietnam Opportunities Fund is scheduled to open for business this week . The fund , a closed-end portfolio , has been in the process of raising_up to $ 120 million in a stock offering . Its shares will start trading on the New York Stock_Exchange on Tuesday . However , investors may have to wait a while to benefit from any increase in trade or production in the Southeast Asian_country , one of the world ' s poorest . &quot; There exist only a limited number of Vietnam companies available to the fund for investment , &quot; says its prospectus . &quot; Securities markets are in the process of being established. &quot; In the meantime , lead manager J . Mark Mobius has leeway to invest in non-Vietnamese companies likely to benefit from their participation in the development of the country ' s economy . Eventually , the fund will have at least 65 % of its assets in local stocks and bonds . * T . Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore ( ( 800 ) 638-5660 ) has unveiled a series of asset-allocation funds . Most aggressive is the Personal Strategy Growth Fund , which will normally maintain an 80 % weighting in_stocks , with the rest in bonds and cash . Most conservative is Personal Strategy Income , with 40 % stocks , 40 % bonds and 20 % cash . Straddling the middle ground is Personal Strategy Balanced , with 60 % stocks , 30 % bonds and the rest in cash . There are no sales charges on the funds .</TEXT>
