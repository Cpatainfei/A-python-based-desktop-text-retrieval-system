   <HEADLINE> BALLOTING TO START FOR STRENGTHENED EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ; ELECTIONS : VOTERS IN FOUR EU NATIONS GO TO THE POLLS FRIDAY , THE REST_ON SUNDAY . THE LAWMAKERS WILL HAVE A ROLE REVIEWING THE MAASTRICHT TREATY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Citizens of the 12-nation European Union begin voting Friday to elect members to their international Parliament , a body that has recently gained important new powers but remains remote and mysterious to most of its constituents . Elections to the 567-seat European Parliament will start with voting in Britain , Ireland , Denmark and the_Netherlands . They finish Sunday in the EU ' s eight other member states . Preliminary results in what are the world ' s only multinational elections are expected late Sunday night . The elections are considered the most important since the assembly was created more_than 40 years ago for one simple reason -- as Western Europe moves toward deeper economic and political integration , the European Parliament has gained more strength . To be sure , it still is overshadowed by traditional power bases in national legislative_assemblies . Even within the EU , it is the member states , sitting collectively as the Council of Ministers , that hold real sway . The Parliament also suffers key shortcomings , including an inability to introduce its own bills or to deal with foreign_policy matters . But the European Parliament today is a far_cry from its modest origins as a toothless , consultative arm of the European Coal and Steel Community in the early 1950s . It presides over the EU ' s $ 80-billion annual budget , and since the Maastricht Treaty took_effect in November , it has gained &quot; co-decision &quot; authority with the council in several areas , including education , the environment and consumer affairs . It has also won the right to review and veto key appointments to the Union ' s Executive Commission and reject new prospective member states -- an especially important power as the new , post-Communist democracies in Central and Eastern Europe begin to line_up for membership . Of far greater potential significance , however , is the promised role for the new Parliament in the 1996 intergovernmental conference that will review the Maastricht Treaty -- a de_facto constitutional convention on the future of Europe . &quot; The elections of 1994 offer voters a greater chance than ever before to influence decision-making in Western Europe , &quot; concluded a study released recently by the London-based Royal Institute of International Affairs . &quot; For the first time , they will be electing ( members ) who have the potential to exert a real impact on legislation. &quot; The Parliament is expected to grow more in stature and importance as measures mount to build a greater degree of direct democracy into the process of European unification . It is already one of the world ' s more unusual elected assemblies . Its elections are conducted under 12 sets of ground_rules . Voters will choose a Parliament that debates in nine languages , whose home is considered to be Strasbourg , France , but whose 19 committees reside in Brussels and whose records are kept_in Luxembourg . Public interest in the elections has been low , debates on crucial European issues are infrequent and knowledge about the candidates is virtually nonexistent . &quot; I work in the European policy field , and I don ' t even know the candidates running in my constituency , &quot; admitted Franz-Josef Meiers , a researcher at the German Foreign Policy Assn . in Bonn . &quot; These people are invisible. &quot; There are exceptions , of course . Singer Nana Mouskouri is running in Greece . Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi heads the Forza Italia ( Go Italy ) candidate list in Italy . Two former prime_ministers are among the Christian Democratic hopefuls in Belgium , while former Prime_Minister Poul Schlueter is campaigning for one of Denmark ' s 16 seats . In France , Michel Rocard , leader of the opposition Socialists , and Jean-Marie Le Pen , of the ultra-rightist National Front , are candidates . Among the hopefuls , a handful of fiery , colorful individuals have even forced real European issues into the campaign on occasion . In Germany , a disgruntled former Brussels bureaucrat named Manfred Brunner , who heads a group called the Free Citizens ' League , has railed against corruption in the EU bureaucracy and the Union ' s liberal subsidies to poor regions . In France , a slate running under the name The Other Europe advocates European political integration , new tariffs to protect internal markets and renegotiation of recently completed world trade talks . But for the most part , the campaign has been dominated by big parties and national political figures , who have co-opted the election , making_it more a series of domestic referendums than a vote on the future shape of a united Europe . In Italy , the election is seen mainly as an initial test for Berlusconi ' s new government in Rome ; in Spain , it will be judged as a barometer of Prime_Minister Felipe Gonzalez ' s attempts to stay in power . In Germany , this contest is considered only one of several preliminary rounds ahead of next October ' s main event -- the Bundestag elections . In Britain , the only real issue is the future of John Major ' s beleaguered government , which does not seem bright .</TEXT>
