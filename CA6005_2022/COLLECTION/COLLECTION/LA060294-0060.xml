   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON SKID_ROW ; MAKE ' CUSTOMERS ' OF CHARITY_CASES ; TURN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS INTO RESEARCH LABORATORIES THAT INCLUDE THE HOMELESS IN DEVELOPING REMEDIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Physical scientists are a powerful special-interest group in our society . Through the National Science Foundation and a host of other institutions , the nation deliberately promotes science and technology . There ' s an infrastructure to support their activities -- technology parks and industrial consortia to team_up , pool resources and share results so that &quot; breakthroughs &quot; and &quot; synergies &quot; can result . Scientists who decry the use of vague language because it is &quot; unscientific &quot; are more_than willing to use it when it serves their purposes . Even more , they have to use it because no one can &quot; prove &quot; that most technological innovations will pay_off handsomely in the future . This does not mean that science and technology have a blank_check any longer -- the cancellation of the Supercollider is a case_in_point . But there ' s no doubt that the United States has science and technology policies . We in the human services sphere might then ask how we fare when it comes_to social innovations . To our knowledge , there are no &quot; social innovation parks &quot; -- no zones of major cities deliberately set_aside for the purpose of experimenting with social ideas on a systemic and systematic basis . We have industrial_enterprise zones but no social innovation zones . We have learned that change and innovation are tantamount_to survival for industrial corporations such_as General Motors and IBM . Why is the same not true of social institutions ? Many months ago , several members of organizations in Los Angeles that serve the homeless began coming_together to pioneer new approaches . Participants try to abide_by the rule that there is no one best way to serve the poor . This by itself helps to remove the senseless bickering that in the past has divided institutions . For instance , it is not important whether an organization adopts a secular or a religious philosophy in serving the poor and the homeless . What counts is the joint recognition that both approaches are needed and that they need to work together . However , merely bringing diverse organizations together is not enough . We believe that a major portion of what is known as Skid_Row ought to be remade as a &quot; social enterprise zone. &quot; Even more , it ought to be seen as a &quot; recovery center &quot; for the entire city of Los Angeles . Such a social enterprise_zone would focus creative talents and energies on the possibility of recovery . There can be no healthy parts of Los Angeles unless every part is healthy and we cannot continue to hide or perpetu-ate the kinds of antisocial behaviors that are prominent in Skid_Row . ( As the riots demonstrated , no part of L.A. is safe if the whole is not. ) We are not saying that every resident of Skid_Row can become a productive , wage-earning citizen ; in fact , realism about the wide range of homeless people is necessary for the changes we seek . If the events of the past few years in Los Angeles have demonstrated anything , it is that new approaches to social innovation are needed desperately . Organizations serving the poor will not only have to reorganize and restructure themselves , but foundations supporting these efforts will also have to change . We need to start thinking_of the poor as consumers of our services , or even as customers . Even more , the customers need to be co-designers of the zones we are proposing and testers of any ensuing proposals . This is merely the social equivalent of test-marketing . As consumers in all industries are driving the design of services , so too should the consumer be involved in shaping human social_services . If a consumer feels unconsidered , he or she will likely reject a product as irrelevant . We also have to do something deeper : We have to recognize that many programs that are intended to serve the poor and the homeless actually reinforce the problem . In the language of dysfunctional families , many of our approaches must be viewed_as co-dependent forces in maintaining poverty and homelessness . Our goal as producers , unlike that of widget makers , should be to reduce , not encourage , repeat business and increase our customers ' self-sufficiency . A recovering city needs to have , for instance , an Institute of Addictionology to study addiction in all its forms , chemical and non-chemical , not merely the obvious ones . Such research might serve our customers by getting them hooked on beneficial rather than destructive behaviors -- computers , perhaps , instead of drugs . The goal would be to establish an atmosphere of discovery and creative collaboration -- a university of urban health . The old institutions have got us to this point in social progress but are stalled . There has to be a place to ask the &quot; what if ? &quot; questions and carry_out the &quot; why not ? &quot; experiments .</TEXT>
