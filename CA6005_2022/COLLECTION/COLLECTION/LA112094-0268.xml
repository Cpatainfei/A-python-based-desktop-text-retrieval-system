   <TEXT> Mona Coates stands_in a lecture hall filled with college_students and makes a_few quick points about compulsions , pornography and &quot; ejaculatory inevitability &quot; before introducing three transvestites who are her guest speakers . At the break , Coates props a mirror on her handbag and tries_out a new mascara , on loan from one of the guests . &quot; I love transvestites , &quot; she says , blinking at her reflection . &quot; They always know the best makeup. &quot; Coates has taught human sexuality at Orange Coast College since 1975 , and she has emerged from the sexually tumultuous decades with her colleagues ' respect , students ' affection and one of the most popular classes on campus . Her blunt , unembarrassed responses have caused some students to dub her the &quot; younger , West Coast version &quot; of Dr. Ruth Westheimer , after the media personality famous for her frank discussions about sex . Coates ' all-embracing teaching style contrasts sharply with her personal life , which is rooted in durable relationships , including her marriage five years ago to her fourth-grade sweetheart . &quot; It just happens that my preferences and lifestyle represent mainline , middle-class WASP America , &quot; she says . &quot; My life has always been rather conservative ; sexual choices , sexual orientation . . . . I ' m about as vanilla as you come. &quot; But there is nothing bland on the menu in her human sexuality class , a three-unit extravaganza of sexual potpourri that attracts almost 1 # 200 hormone-charged students every year . &quot; Her class is always full to capacity , &quot; says Chris O ' Hearn , vice_president of instruction . &quot; And there is always a waiting list. &quot; David Grant , president of the college since 1962 , describes Coates as &quot; a consummate professional &quot; who plays best to a full_house . &quot; She is an extraordinarily non-judgmental person in terms of her presentation , and ( she ' s ) very , very popular_with students because of that , &quot; he says . A fixture in her class is the Question Box , which is passed_through the aisles at the beginning of each class and into which students drop anonymous -- and sometimes searingly intimate -- queries for Coates to answer . She says the questions have changed markedly over the past two decades . The shift has been from a sexually experimental ' 70s , to the more cautious ' 80s to the worried and health-conscious ' 90s . Some questions are timeless . Males fret perpetually : &quot; Is my penis too small ? &quot; Females wonder incessantly : &quot; Am I sexy enough ? &quot; Some queries are wary ( &quot; Can men tell if females fake orgasm ? &quot; ) , worrisome ( &quot; Why do I feel_like vomiting every time I have_sex ? &quot; ) , playful ( &quot; Is there a lab for this class ? &quot; ) and plaintive ( &quot; How do you feel about loveless sex ? &quot; ) . &quot; I never get embarrassed answering the questions , &quot; she says . &quot; I realize all our body_parts are normal . I don ' t think it ' s so terrible to separate the knees and the elbows from the vaginas and the penises. &quot; Coates , 50 , who is a psychotherapist , licensed marriage and family counselor , certified hypnotherapist and certified sex therapist , began teaching sociology at the Costa Mesa college Sept . 5 , 1967 , when she was just 22 . She launched her human sexuality class about eight years later at the urging of her students . To prepare , she spent a year attending training workshops throughout the state , including Masters and Johnson seminars and the National Sex Forum in San Francisco . It was an era of &quot; sensual razzmatazz , &quot; she remembers , the &quot; if it feels good , do_it &quot; decade . &quot; In the ' 70s , it was , ' What all can we think_of to do ? What can we think_of to experiment ( with ) sexually ? ' &quot; she says . &quot; In the ' 80s , it was , ' Should we be experimenting with our sexuality ? ' In the ' 90s , the attitude is , ' We ' d better not experiment sexually unless we know it ' s absolutely safe. ' You see the increasing conservatism. &quot; In two decades , student inquiries about health have doubled , Coates says . In the past six years , questions about AIDS alone have tripled . &quot; The concerns around the consequences of sex are far more serious , &quot; she says . Sex education is serious stuff . It ' s also great theater under Coates ' sure direction . &quot; I think Mona is -- I don ' t want to cheapen it -- ( but ) more of an entertainer , &quot; Grant says . &quot; She has more of a flare for the way the material is presented . She has an excellent ( way of ) inspiring large audiences. &quot; On a recent afternoon , Coates took center stage . Like a practiced talk_show host , she dragged her microphone cord behind her , occasionally chopping the air with her hand to make her point . The question in her hand from the Question Box was from a male , 19 , who felt turned_on by pornography but guilt-ridden because it demeans women . She applauded his sensitivity and warned him of developing a dependency on such films . &quot; If you feel any compulsive need to use pornography , back_off , &quot; she says . &quot; Don ' t let anything run you . . . just wean yourself away from it. &quot; Next , Coates readies the class for her guest speakers . Transvestites , she says , are &quot; just normal people &quot; with a &quot; deep and profound need &quot; to wear clothing of the opposite sex . &quot; When women dress like men , nobody blinks an eye . The problem always exists when the men get_out of line . &quot; Men get this much space , &quot; she adds , pinching the air between her thumb and forefinger , &quot; to express themselves. &quot; &quot; Cyndi , &quot; &quot; Jennifer &quot; and &quot; Beverly &quot; enter stage_right . Following a cool initial response , the students begin to warm_to the smartly dressed and carefully coiffed trio as they take turns telling their life_stories . Female students , in particular , quickly begin relating to the most feminine of the three men . At the break , Coates approvingly notes the shift in the students ' attitude . &quot; What I really see the class ( having ) is a compassion for people , &quot; she says . * Mona Alberta Gordon was born June 5 , 1944 , in Johnstown , Pa. , into a family she describes as &quot; functional and genuinely happy. &quot; Her only sibling , Barbara , arrived four years later . Their father was a master electrician , hard-working and kind ; their mother , a skilled seamstress of abundant good_humor , Coates says . The couple had fallen_in_love during the Depression but waited until 1942 to marry because money was so scarce . Coates ' early_childhood was snug and nurturing , she says . If the day held family conflicts , her parents sat late at the kitchen_table , talking until they reached a resolution . Life turned even rosier for the vivacious girl with the curly blond hair , when , at 9 , she spied Eddie Jacobs in Miss Kramer ' s fourth-grade class and fell irretrievably in_love . By sixth grade , they were set to marry but , like Coates ' parents , couldn ' t scare up the cash . &quot; We only had 50 cents a week allowance , &quot; she remembers , &quot; so we had to wait. &quot; Then , her life caved_in . Her father died_suddenly of a massive heart_attack , and her mother slid into a deep depression that lingered for years . &quot; Those were the dark years , &quot; she recalls , her green eyes turning serious . &quot; I literally grew_up at age 11. &quot; Young Mona kept house , mowed the grass and cared_for her mother and sister . &quot; I feel so grateful for the beginning , &quot; she says , brushing over the rough spots , &quot; the first 12 years. &quot; During the next few years , Eddie was her bright spot . They hiked , rode bicycles and attended Friday night sock hops . After school each day , they stopped at the corner drugstore and sipped cherry Cokes . They met regularly at the YMCA where , Coates says , they would &quot; sit in the bleachers and make out. &quot; But they only went so far , she adds . She believed her virginity should be preserved for marriage . In the summer of 1959 , as she prepared_for junior_high_school , she suffered another life-altering blow when her family moved to California , and she had to leave Eddie behind . &quot; We stayed_together as a real couple , very seriously , until we were 15 , &quot; she says . After that , they lost contact . Then , at 19 , Coates heard that Eddie , her &quot; true soul_mate , &quot; was dead . Killed in Vietnam . She was devastated . &quot; I cried , &quot; she says , &quot; for about two years. &quot; Still carrying Eddie ' s sixth- and seventh-grade pictures in her wallet , Coates hurried through college , cleaning her professors ' houses to get spending_money and earning her master ' s degree from Cal State Fullerton in 1967 ( she received a doctorate from UC Irvine in 1980 ) . At 22 , she claimed the job at Orange Coast College and began gathering outstanding teacher awards . In 1972 , she married John Coates , another Orange Coast College professor , and became step-mother to his 8- and 12-year-old sons . The couple were divorced in 1976 . Then , shortly after Coates ' mother died five years ago , she received some startling news . The schoolmate who had died in Vietnam was not Eddie Jacobs after all . Jacobs , as it turned_out , was twice divorced and living_in Philadelphia . A stunned Coates &quot; wore_out about three Philadelphia information operators &quot; trying to find his telephone_number . Finally , she says , as if she still can ' t believe it , &quot; Eddie himself -- the real Eddie -- picked_up the phone. &quot; They married seven weeks later . Stanlee Phelps , one of Coates ' best_friends , was with the couple the night they were reunited . They ate_at a seaside restaurant in Laguna Beach and then strolled through an oceanfront park at sunset . The mood was tender and edgy . &quot; Mona , when she ' s nervous , talks a lot , and Eddie , when he ' s nervous , can ' t say anything , &quot; Phelps says . &quot; They were both nervous . . . . It was so_much fun to see how star-struck they both were and how grateful they were to find one another . &quot; I really felt funny being there , but I think both of them needed someone to really keep their feet on the ground . It was really a very precious evening , &quot; Phelps says . Eddie and Mona continued to float for the next couple years , so overwhelmed at their good_fortune that they got_married five times . Their first wedding was June 15 , 1989 , in Ocean City , Md. , at a ceremony attended by Jacobs ' parents . When it was over , the groom couldn ' t resist asking his bride , &quot; Would you marry me again ? &quot; &quot; She said , ' Sure , I would marry you five times , ' &quot; he recalls . &quot; So we did. &quot; In July , returning to California , they stopped in Las Vegas and repeated their vows in a small chapel on the strip . In August , they rented a hall in Westminster , invited about 100 friends and replayed the blissful event . The fourth ceremony was the next month , beneath the Golden Gate Bridge . And , finally , Jan . 5 , 1991 -- surrounded by palm_trees and a Polynesian setting -- a minister wearing a colorful shirt pronounced them husband and wife on the Big Island of Hawaii . That will probably be the last of it , Jacobs says , since five is Coates ' lucky number . But , he adds quickly , &quot; you never know. &quot; Today , Jacobs , a computer_programmer , and Coates live_on a quiet Huntington Beach street . Inside , the walls are blanketed with pictures of the beaming couple and their extended families . Resting_on the mantle in a heart-shaped frame are Mona and Eddie at 9 years old . Their married life , Coates says , is very traditional . &quot; I ' m not only very ( sexually ) discriminating , I ' m very monogamous , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' m not attracted to any kind of fetish . I ' m simply not attracted to any of the different sexual practices that I feel very tolerant of in others. &quot; She is shy about only one thing -- her sex life with Jacobs . &quot; Speaking about my sexual experiences with my own husband , they seem so private and sacred , &quot; she says . Since Coates has tenure at the college and a busy counseling practice , Jacobs agreed to relocate . He has since learned plenty from sitting in on his wife ' s classes and joining her when she treats her guest speakers to meals . &quot; I find myself sitting there with transvestites , hermaphrodites or gay people , &quot; Jacobs says . In fact , he now takes them to dinner if Coates is busy . Some days , Coates seems to have blown way past busy and entered a state of perpetual motion . In addition to her work_at the college , Coates counsels at least a dozen clients four days a week in her private practice . She also attends seminars where she is sometimes a guest speaker . &quot; She is probably one of the most active faculty_members in staying abreast_of the subject_matter in her discipline , &quot; says Dick Marsh , dean of social and behavioral sciences . &quot; She ' s constantly going_to conferences all_over the United States , and she usually pays_for it out of_her_own pocket. &quot; Despite the controversial subject_matter , Marsh said he ' s had no complaints about Coates , unless he counts the one student who was booted from a lecture for talking and wanted back in . Recommended readings in Coates ' class include &quot; The New Joy of Sex , &quot; &quot; The Ultimate Sex Book , &quot; &quot; Hot Monogamy &quot; and &quot; How to Make_Love All the Time. &quot; Though it is not required for any major , this class is one of the most hotly pursued on campus . ( Coates also teaches advanced human sexuality , a more in-depth look_at many of the same issues. ) James Kowalski , one of six teachers who now teach human sexuality at the college , says an instructor ' s personality and priorities determine how the subject will be tackled . He , for example , emphasizes relationships , sexually transmitted diseases , child-rearing and other issues that &quot; affect the mainstream. &quot; &quot; I rarely talk_about sex as a positive thing independent of the relationship , &quot; he says . Kowalski admits some students might find his class boring compared to Coates ' . On the other hand , he says , some might find Coates ' topics more superficial than his . &quot; Consistently , what I ' ve heard from students about Mona ' s class is really quite positive , &quot; he adds . &quot; They find her class enjoyable and extremely informative. &quot; Coates ' views her classroom discussions as anything but superficial . &quot; My big job is to create and teach only love , &quot; she says , and that &quot; every person , regardless of sexual orientation or dysfunction , is a precious human treasure. &quot; Coates says she tries by example and attitude to teach students how to talk , listen and &quot; show_up emotionally &quot; so strong relationships can be forged . &quot; It ' s not just ( giving ) information , it ' s teaching attitudes and values that enhance human life and human development , &quot; she says . But all that is just the wrapping ; many students want simply to rip into the gift -- the basics about sex . Coates does not disappoint them , even showing videos and using transparencies to describe sexual techniques . Generally , the first 20 minutes of each class are set_aside for Coates to address queries from the Question Box . She may then proceed with a lecture based on a previous assignment . On guest speaker days , a panel of attorneys may discuss sex and the law , members of the clergy may tackle sex and religion , or a medical doctor may describe venereal_disease , contraception , pregnancy or childbirth . And , of course , there are speakers from &quot; sexual minority groups &quot; -- including gays , transsexuals and the sexually disabled . Despite the broadly accepting attitude she displays with her students , Coates believes promiscuity &quot; tears_down the fabric of commitment &quot; and makes_it harder for &quot; human_beings to really grow. &quot; Sex before marriage ? Well , that depends_on the relationship . And she doesn ' t hesitate to tell a student he ' s doing wrong . For example , a 20-year-old man claimed he was being seduced by a 15-year-old girl . &quot; No matter what the 15-year-old girl does -- if she throws her clothes off and jumps_on him -- it is statutory_rape in the eyes of the law . Period , &quot; Coates says . When her personal beliefs contrast with her mission as a sex educator , Coates says she &quot; centers herself &quot; with a brief prayer or meditative technique . &quot; It ' s not about meeting my needs , it ' s about meeting their needs , whether it ' s a client or a student or a class as a whole. &quot; Coates says she has continued teaching human sexuality in part because it allows her to take swipes at the myths , fears , guilt and ignorance that make people miserable . &quot; It ' s not necessary for people to suffer the way they do , &quot; she says . Her students seem to appreciate the effort . At the close of each semester , most leave_behind glowing class evaluation forms . Jacobs says his wife has taught so many students that , at times , it seems they can ' t escape them . When they were returning from Paris two years ago , a flight_attendant stopped suddenly at their aisle and said , &quot; Mona Coates ! &quot; The attendant told Coates that one of the pilots was a transvestite . &quot; I know all about it because I studied that in your class , &quot; the attendant said . &quot; She ' s very bright and she could have done many things , &quot; Jacobs says of his wife . &quot; But I personally believe she couldn ' t have found a better vocation , both for her and for all_the people she ' s touched. &quot;</TEXT>
