   <TEXT> When Prime Ticket ' s Don Meek first began pitching potential sponsors to help underwrite a big Southern California surf contest at Huntington Beach , the reaction was as cold as one of last winter ' s storms . &quot; I went_to New York last February for three days , &quot; recalled Meek , vicepresident for event properties for the L.A.-based cable network . &quot; And it turned_into seven days because we got snowed in . You really have to believe you ' re on a mission while slogging through snow selling sponsorships to a surfing event to major corporations like 1-800-COLLECT and Coca-Cola in New York City . &quot; I would walk into their offices and they would ask , ' What are you here to see us about ? ' Well , I would say , ' The U.S. Open of Surfing. ' And , they would say , ' Well , it ' s 10 degrees outside. ' &quot; Meek didn ' t exactly inherit the Earth on this trip , but neither did he let that midwinter disinterest stop him from creating a contest . Five months later , with those two sponsors and others in tow , Prime Ticket and Huntington Beach are putting_on a two-week surfing bonanza . Today through Sunday , the 13th Annual Op Pro Surfing Championship will draw top surfers to the southern side of Huntington Beach Pier . With more_than 400 competitors vying on almost everything that floats , organizers are calling it the biggest competitive field ever assembled . It is a $ 70 # 000 World Qualifying Series event . Next week ( Aug . 2-7 ) , it ' s the $ 140 # 000 U.S. Open of Surfing , the first time in two years that a world-tour event has been held_in the continental United States . All this surf news , said Rockin ' Fig , could mean a major revival for surfing . How so , Figgy ? Well , there are a lot of things affecting surfing this year . The new movie &quot; The Endless Summer II &quot; is now out , and it ' s gonna motivate a lot more people to visit the beach . I ' m not just talkin ' about our inland population in Southern California . I ' m talking_about people in the Midwest and elsewhere . They ' ll be checking_out surfing and seeing how much fun it is . With the Op Pro and the U.S. Open of Surfing , people are going_to focus_on Southern California , looking_to see what happens at both contests because the big names of surfing are going_to be here . Coming_to town for the Open are such stalwarts as Australia ' s Barton Lynch and Damien Hardman , world champ Derek Ho of Hawaii , Great Britain ' s Martin Potter and , from the other side of the globe , Brazil ' s Flavio Padaratz and Fabio Gouveia . Southland contenders include Cardiff ' s Rob Machado and San Clemente ' s Shane Beschen . With such talent eyeing the Open , John Warner , Ocean Pacific Surfing Apparel Corp. ' s chief_executive_officer , said Op was concerned that its contest might take a back seat to the Open . But Op has gotten_word that 41 of the world ' s Top 44 surfers will also compete at the Op Pro . &quot; And , we ' ve also added a tandem event , &quot; Warner said . &quot; Kind of like the ol ' Gidget years , which should be a lot of fun . With both contests , it should be an incredible 10 days of surfing. &quot; Fig added : Don ' t forget the best longboarders in the world will be here , with guys like world champion Rusty Kealana , former champ Joey Hawkins and others . And we have all_the best women in the world , including Florida ' s Lisa Andersen and Australia ' s Pauline Menczer . And they ' re gonna be having the Op Juniors contest , so they ' re gonna be showcasing the best up and coming grommets . So we also have an amateur contest mixed in with the pros , eh ? Yup , that ' s it . It ' s gonna be big in all divisions . It has even gotten the normally surfing-shy media ' s attention . Last week , for instance , Sports Illustrated was looking_for Hawaii ' s Sunny Garcia for a possible profile . Television ' s &quot; Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous &quot; -- yep , Robin Leach -- will highlight former world champion and teen-age heartthrob Kelly Slater . Sports Illustrated for Kids will be at the U.S. Open , as will TV Guide , MTV Sports , the &quot; Today &quot; show and possibly CNN . Already , 175 journalists and representatives from 70 media outlets have asked_for passes and camera space , organizers said . Figgy , what ' s so big about having a world tour event like the U.S. Open ? We haven ' t had one in two years . You only get 10 or 11 world tour events a year , and this is the first time in two years that we ' ve been able to sponsor one in the continental United States . It takes big bucks to put_on a world-tour contest . Fig , I asked Ian Cairns , the Op Pro ' s contest director , what kind of maneuvers these top pros will be doing . &quot; In the past , &quot; Cairns said , &quot; surfers like Tom Curren would pull_off , say , an off-the-lip turn , a maneuver that ' s really hot . But you would see one such maneuver on a single wave . The key now is to link them up , ride a tube and then pull a really radical roundhouse turn_into another and then another , linking up two or three super moves_on a single wave. &quot; &quot; Southside Huntington , &quot; said Nick Carroll , Surfing Magazine ' s editor-in-chief , &quot; is an almost uniquely Californian phenomenon , including a pier-formed sandbar . No other wave on the world professional tour even remotely resembles it . The result ? A wave that simultaneously rewards patience and risk. &quot; Carroll said several people come_to_mind to win the Open : Dave Macaulay from West Australia is &quot; Mr. Patient &quot; personified ; countryman Lynch , who won the 1991 Op , and half_a_dozen others also are likely . But Garcia and Slater stick_out . &quot; If Kelly and Sunny make the final , and Kelly doesn ' t score four perfect , flawless , impossible waves , Sunny will eat him for breakfast , lunch and dinner , &quot; Carroll said . Even longboarders will dazzle the crowds with hot new moves , said Hawkins , a Huntington Beach pro longboarder . Hawkins , 24 , the former world champion , said today ' s longboarders have learned radical moves by adapting skateboarding maneuvers to the water . &quot; Today ' s pros are looking_for a series of radical moves rather than just one mega maneuver , &quot; Hawkins explained . &quot; If you pull_off only one big trick , like a big ( aerial ) , you won ' t get as_many points ( as ) if you do a number of easier maneuvers that can win you a consistent score . Unfortunately , contests do not let you pull_off real radical moves because you won ' t score as high . &quot; But for me , &quot; Hawkins continued , &quot; you ' re going to see a lot of nose rides and 360s , dropped-knee cutbacks and floaters plus a lot of crazy stuff like from-the-tail 360s and from-the-nose 360s , when you throw the front of the board_up into the wave and slide it back_down . Also some ' shove it ' 360s. &quot; A &quot; shove it &quot; 360 ? &quot; Yeah , &quot; Hawkins said . &quot; I sometimes take_off , fin first , and shove the surfboard into a 360-degree turn and land with a switched stance. &quot; All of which will be caught_on film . Fig , I asked Meek how an L.A. network that normally just televises events got_into the business of producing the U.S. Open of Surfing . &quot; We ' re the event management company , &quot; said Meek , a youthful 36-year-old surfer from Pacific Palisades and former Newport Beach lifeguard . &quot; Originally , Prime Ticket as the sole sponsor put_up $ 250 # 000 . But we ' ve spent far beyond that in television inventory . I would estimate that a non-television company would have to spend about $ 1 million to put this on. &quot; Essentially , Prime Ticket put_up guarantee money and then sold sponsorships , right ? &quot; Right , &quot; Meek said . &quot; We have 1-800-COLLECT and Sebastian Hair_Care products as premier sponsors. &quot; Was there a surfing connection among Prime Ticket execs ? &quot; Yes ! &quot; Meek said . &quot; Roger L . Werner , the president and CEO of Prime Ticket , surfs . Also , we never would have gotten_into this if not for Don Corsini , executive_vice_president of programming and production . He ' s also a hard-core surf guy . In fact , we all surf together at Malibu. &quot; Cool . The Fig was happy about that . It ' s kinda neat for Don Meek to be fortunate to have two bosses who are bigwigs in the industry , and those same guys surf ! It ' s a stoker . These guys are into it , and that gives really everybody else out there in the surfing world a little bit of a chance , because Meek managed to persuade them on this contest . You gotta give a special thanks to those guys . Fig , you ' re making me feel warm and fuzzy all_over . Hey , maybe they ' ll give me 20 free passes ? How will Prime Ticket make money here ? &quot; We have the rights to domestic TV , merchandising , the live gate , concessions and sponsorships , &quot; Meek said . Fig , I guess the boys from Prime Ticket are hoping for sunny skies and nice waves , huh ? Riiiiight . Lucky for them , Huntington Beach is_well known for its consistency . It may_not have the biggest waves , but if you ' re going to hold a contest , Huntington is a good choice . As part of the festivities , Prime Ticket will co-host a dinner and concert Aug . 4 to raise money for Surfrider Foundation ' s environmental projects . The fund-raiser , featuring Chris Isaak , is scheduled for the Hard Rock Cafe in Newport Beach . Cost is $ 100 per person . For information , call ( 714 ) 361-2612 . Also , 25 cents from every print program goes_to Surfrider , which will also hold a raffle for a chance to win a pro ' s surfboard at the U.S. Open of Surfing . Raffle tickets are $ 1 . Bleachers at the Open will hold 7 # 000 people . It ' s paid admission . VIP sky boxes for companies and reserve seating will also be available . Also , Prime Ticket has added a beach expo during the Open , featuring booths from ocean organizations and companies interested in the beach lifestyle . Rockin ' Fig and Dave ' s Surfin ' Glossary Bottom Turn -- The surfer lays_into a turn at the bottom of the wave , drives_off the bottom really hard , and that sets_up the next move . Says Fig : It ' s the biggest move you ' re gonna see at any contest . Lip -- The top section of a wave that topples over when the wave begins to break . Lip Slash -- No , not a lipstick accident . A big power turn_off the top . Fig : You wanna be throwin ' a lot of water . Basically a whip turn_off the face of the breaking wave . Huntington Hop -- Something you ' re going to be seeing a lot of during the next two weeks . It happens when surfers catch an outside wave , then bounce on their boards attempting to catch the reform wave or inside shorebreak . It ' s probably not what the judges wanna see . They wanna see guys S-turn their way over flat spots trying to look fluid and not lose any speed as they connect to the inside section . Shred -- When the rider rips a wave going from maneuver to maneuver and just shreds it . Cannot use to describe big Hawiian power surfers such_as Johnny Boy Gomes . Johnny Boy not only shreds , he gouges waves . Suicidal -- Figgy says it best describes his buddy , John Parmenter , 1986 U.S. Bud Pro Tour champion . Parmenter was surfing close to the pier recently on a big , eight-foot day . They were just throwing big and super hollow right next to the pier . You would take_off and BOOM ! You ' re right inside the barrel going as fast as a freight_train toward the pier . He was riding my board . Real suicidal . He didn ' t care about the pier . He was getting some mean barrels . Big frothy green things . And , he ' s wearing this Day-Glo wet suit , and I could see him right through the lip as it broke over . He was , like , five feet behind the breaking lip , just tucked inside this thing . He made_it . Tailslide -- Usually performed after a cutback where the rider shifts weight on his trail foot , pushes_down and slides the tail of the board . You ' ll be turning the board around , changing directions and definitely drifting that tail , doin ' a big ' ol tailslide while you ' re moving into the next section . Wipeouts -- As easy as putting_on your shoes . You too can become a member of The Fall Off Club . Odds are that you will have fallen_off dozens of times before you can ride a curl in to shore . Can include a simple dive off the surfboard to something more radical . An easy full soul arch can immediately turn_into mayhem if your fins snag on something . A G-force bottom turn -- full tilt with heavy body lean , hand cupped as it slips across the water -- can wind_up with the tail slipping right outta the water . Result : You slipping into traction .

Researched by APRIL JACKSON / Los Angeles Times Water Warriors Wave-slapping maneuvers at Op Pro Surfing Championships and U.S. Open of Surfing will show_off skills of the sport ' s international professional contingent . A guide to watching and understanding totally stoked surf competition : * Making Points Contestants are judged on execution of radical moves at fast speeds on any size wave that can be surfed . Judges score top four rides from maximum of 10 to determine finalists . In final heat , best five of 15 are scored . * Priority Buoy First surfer to paddle around priority buoy gets prime choice on wave selection for heat . Toward end of heat , leader may use priority buoy to bump other competitors off waves , preventing them from scoring . * Wave selection Choice of waves dictates surfer ' s ability to fulfill other judging criteria . Surfers will opt_for outside set of waves for their size , shape and potential riding distance . * Personal style Judges examine how surfer works selected waves and strings together maneuvers for fluid ride . * Maneuvers Emphasis on big , explosive moves showcasing surfer ' s talents and harnessing wave ' s power . ( More detailed maneuvers illustrated below. ) * Ride length Carving inside section of waves is crucial . Longer rides mean more opportunities to perform scoring maneuvers . Working a Wave Pros make surfing look easy . But maneuvers take strength , balance , grace and endurance . Surfers also assess conditions and decide which waves best showcase their skills . Close-up of four moves and their scores : * Cutbacks Several turns_in one . Surfer sets board on edge and slices back against wave break . Goal is to slam into foam , setting_up a new series of maneuvers across wave face . High points awarded for solid cutbacks . * Floaters Surfer climbs to top of wave , then shoots across breaking section . Difficulty comes when surfer drops_off top and turns_back into wave face . Medium to high points . * Tube Rides Good wave selection and timing set surfer inside hollow portion of breaking wave . Ability to adjust speed to let tube catch_up , then finesse staying inside as long as possible always garners high points . * Aerials Think saltwater skateboarding . Surfer turns hard off wave bottom , gaining speed_up wave face , and blasts into air . While airborne , surfer flips board in opposite direction and prepares_for splashdown . High points for those who stay on-board . Sources : ASP Media Guide , Ocean Pacific , U.S. Open of Surfing , Los Angeles Times reports Researched by APRIL JACKSON / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
