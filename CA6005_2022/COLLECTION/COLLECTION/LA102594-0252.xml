   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_NETWORKING ALTERS COLLEGE LIFE ; TECHNOLOGY : THE INSTITUTIONS ARE THE FIRST TO EXPERIENCE THE PROMISE OF THE DIGITAL AGE IN SOCIAL AS WELL AS PRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR AND FIRST TO TACKLE ITS PROBLEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ryan LaSalle learned how to use electronic_mail on his first day at Princeton_University . Caryn Siegel waited until her second year after realizing it let her easily communicate with a friend at another college . The PC in LaSalle ' s dorm_room checks with Princeton ' s main computer every five minutes for new messages . Siegel logs_in once or twice a day on public machines in academic buildings or one at the Student Volunteer Center . &quot; All over the campus , no matter where you go , you can always get E-mail , &quot; she said . Like Princeton , most colleges have become wired societies , already transformed by computer-assisted communication in ways that will take the nation as_a_whole years to achieve . They are the first to experience the promise of the digital age in social as well as productive behavior and the first to tackle its problems . &quot; We are ahead of the curve , &quot; said William Graves , associate provost for information technology at the University of North Carolina . &quot; We have a lot of experience with this . It would certainly be a shame if the nation didn ' t take_advantage of it. &quot; More_than 80 % of the nation ' s colleges , universities and junior_colleges are linked to the Internet , the network of computer_networks formed in the late 1960s to join collegiate researchers with the government and military contractors . Most of those schools provide every student with a computer account that is an address on the Internet , a practice that became common about five years ago as more students brought PCs to campus . Many have also linked their residence_halls and academic buildings with high-capacity fiber optic lines . The Wired Life As a result , students in most colleges think nothing of accessing the school library ' s index or one at another college from their own dorm . Many schools foster a sense of community by creating topical discussion areas on the campus network similar to those on the Internet or commercial on-line systems like CompuServe . Many also use computers to distribute campuswide notices . Princeton , for instance , sends its newsletter on outdoor activities and trips via E-mail , saving more_than $ 5 # 000 in printing . And a small but growing number of professors require students to download assignments or turn_in homework through the campus computer . Laura Skandera-Trombley , a professor of English at the State University of New York-Potsdam , has her composition students submit their &quot; papers &quot; via E-mail . Her software automatically duplicates the work so she can change one copy while the original remains for comparison . &quot; In the beginning , students want to print off things because they are used to the hard_copy , &quot; she said . &quot; They do that less and less as the semester goes on. &quot; Professors have become more accessible to students , without having to be in the office more , because of E-mail . that ' s especially helpful to part-time students and those who don ' t live_on campus . &quot; The feeling among the faculty is we have a little less face-to-face contact with our students , &quot; said Wes Baker , a communications professor at Cedarville College in Ohio . &quot; However , the perception among students is that contact with teachers has risen because they can zip off a question. &quot; Students of economics at the University of Missouri-Rolla , seeing how much free information is available on the Internet , have started to create databases to share with others , said Professor Linda Manning . &quot; It puts students in a completely different role , to be information providers , &quot; she said . And , of course , personal communication is more efficient . The editors of the school newspaper at North Carolina State University stay in touch with E-mail and also with voice messaging and pagers . LaSalle at Princeton said he gets friends together for basketball_games with E-mail . &quot; Several people I know have used it to keep long-distance relationships going , &quot; said Scott Fritchie , a computer_systems administrator at St . Olaf College in Minnesota . &quot; They ' re still dating their high_school sweetheart electronically. &quot; Bruce Hickey , a Princeton student who arrived on campus early this fall , said he was disappointed when his account wasn ' t activated for two weeks . &quot; I ' m used to just getting comfy and sending E-mail to my friends , &quot; said Hickey , who is in touch with more_than a dozen friends around the country . &quot; I can ' t imagine any instance where I would need to write a letter to any of my friends. &quot; One measure of a college ' s progress in the digital world is whether mail in the campus post_office has been reduced . Grinnell College in Iowa has seen a reduction , but chiefly in all-school notices or advertisements . Other schools say the paper glut continues . &quot; Habits are hard to break_in that regard , &quot; Jeff Hanna , spokesman for the College of Wooster in Ohio , said via E-mail . &quot; And the habit is to tell students as_many times as possible in as_many different ways as possible to make certain they get the message. &quot; Indeed , like many companies , colleges are learning the ease of computer messages sometimes yields greater volume but reduced effectiveness . Spotting Problems &quot; I think people are now confusing transmitting data with communicating , &quot; said David Davenport , president of Pepperdine University in Malibu . &quot; I think you can really communicate via E-mail . But I think a lot of people are not communicating. &quot; He said his computer is routinely filled with messages for which he is not the primary recipient , but one of many . Other digital-age problems colleges are facing include how to provide copyrights and appropriate credit for electronic information , prevent harassment on computer_networks and provide everyone with access to up-to-date technology . Several large groups of colleges are working_on statements of electronic rights . A model has emerged from American University , and the American Assn . for Higher Education that says a person has a right to free speech in the electronic world but also a responsibility to behave ethically . In a recent example of where the two clashed , Santa Rosa Junior_College in California last month agreed to pay two female students $ 15 # 000 because of derogatory remarks made about them on a men-only discussion group on the campus computer . &quot; These are old issues . The technology has opened_up new windows on them , &quot; said Graves , the North Carolina administrator and director of the Institute for Academic Technology , a resource group partly funded by IBM . Among the most thorny is making_sure students can get the right computers and software . Dartmouth College requires students to own a PC . Princeton rejected that idea several years ago , although more_than two-thirds of its students own one . Public_schools have more trouble with such a requirement since they are generally larger , serve a more diverse economic base of students and have government bureaucracies to answer . The branch of the University of Minnesota in Crookston , in the state ' s far northwest corner , incorporates $ 750 into its fees to provide every student with a laptop_computer . But three branches of California State University ran_into criticism last month when they declared an intent to require students own PCs . Just Another Tool For all_the hype given to video-on-demand and home shopping , the experience on college campuses makes_it clear that better communication is the end most people seek in the digital future . Even then , Princeton students said , technology won ' t run a person ' s life . &quot; It ' s an information tool , &quot; Ryan LaSalle said . &quot; It ' s not the information tool. &quot; Caryn Siegel said she continues to write letters , make phone_calls and trudge through resources at the library . Comparing computers and E-mail to the automated teller machine , she said , &quot; You need to still go_into the bank once in awhile. &quot;</TEXT>
