   <HEADLINE> THANKSGIVING COMES ON-LINE ; CYBERSPACE ABUZZ WITH TURKEY RECIPES , SUPERMARKET TIPS , EVEN SUGGESTED PRAYERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They swapped recipes for &quot; turkey mystery loaf &quot; and turkey tortillas , and gave tips on which supermarkets have special deals on frozen fowl and cases of Pepsi . They discussed the virtues of instant versus real mashed potatoes . People even logged_on to home computers to compare notes on what to say for grace over their holiday meal tonight . Preparing_for Thanksgiving in cyberspace may_not quite be what the pilgrims had_in_mind , but people plugged into the Internet and other computer_networks , such_as America Online and CompuServe , to give_thanks and chat across Orange County and the nation . America Online ' s &quot; Attitude of Gratitude &quot; bulletin_board , for example , had more_than 100 postings by late Wednesday , offering practical tips and philosophical wanderings from computer users across the country . The Internet , a public network accessible by almost anyone with a connection , computer and modem , also turned_into a forum for goodwill . Computer users who had &quot; flamed &quot; each other -- or exchanged electronic insults -- in the past used their computer connections to apologize or give_thanks for friendships developed on-line . Some signed_on to complain about how their holiday plans to anyone who would listen -- or rather , read . &quot; How many out there still have to sit at the ' kids ' table ' ? &quot; asked one America Online user . &quot; Me and my cousins are 20 years old and don ' t think we ' ll ever graduate to the big table. &quot; And another : &quot; This is the second Thanksgiving I have been_sick in bed with mono. &quot; Vegetarians use such services to give their thoughts on the holiday ' s distinctly carnivorous slant . &quot; I find it upsetting that so_much is made_out of eating turkey rather than offering thanks , &quot; wrote one America Online vegetarian . The holiday &quot; means more to me just eating the harvest that grows from the earth , and not from the factory farms where suffering is commonplace. &quot; From Southern California to the Old_South , kitchen-dwellers discussed the local turkey bargains . Vons , Ralphs or Lucky ? Winn Dixie or Safeway ? Everybody touted hometown bargains , from 27-cents-a-pound turkeys to offers of a free fowl with a $ 25 purchase . Dozens of suggested prayers of Thanksgiving were transmitted along computer lines , with brevity a notable feature of many , such_as &quot; Good food , good meat , good God , let ' s eat ! &quot; and &quot; Rub a dub dub , thanks for the grub. &quot; Many computer users flung messages into cyberspace , hoping they would make_it to their loved ones . &quot; We in the Los Angeles County area have a great_deal to be thankful for after experiencing the Northridge earthquake , &quot; wrote an America Online user . Another said her house caught_on fire during the Malibu blazes , and then was damaged in the Northridge earthquake . She still gives_thanks , though , for the simplest reason : Family members are healthy and spending Thanksgiving together .</TEXT>
