   <HEADLINE> UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER ; BACH ' S HEART IS IN NORWAY , BUT LOVE FOR TENNIS KEEPS HIM HERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Watching TV seldom makes Fredrik Bach homesick , but for the last 10 days , he has been sitting on the couch and taking trips down nostalgia lane . Bach , a junior tennis_player at UC Irvine , lives a_couple_of hours from the sites where Dan Jansen , Tommy Moe and Picabo Street won Olympic medals . All of those freeze-frame-go-to-commercial shots from Norway are so many postcards from home . &quot; I still spend every summer home_in Norway , &quot; said Bach , who lives_in Porsgrunn , a small_town south of Oslo , &quot; and I talk to my friends there a lot . &quot; At first , a lot of people weren ' t sure they wanted the Olympics because of the financial aspect . It still might be a big bust moneywise , but everyone is really excited . A lot of the events were sold_out three or four months ago and we ' ve had the most snow this winter since 1964. &quot; His parents now live_in Tampa , but Bach misses his friends and countrymen , and says he plans on returning to live full-time in Norway . &quot; I see myself moving_back , &quot; he said . &quot; I really like it there . It ' s more quiet , more relaxed . It ' s funny because people here seem more friendly . You walk down the street and everyone says , ' Hi. ' There , they walk right by and never make eye_contact . &quot; But I think the friendships you make there are maybe more genuine . In a tiny country up by the north_pole , with only 10 # 000 people in your town and one house every 300 meters , you can do your own thing . You ' re not forced to interact with people as much as you do here . But when you get_to know people , it ' s a sincere friendship. &quot; Bach misses the snow and the winter sports , but he knows his tennis career has a better chance of blossoming under the California sun . He was the top-ranked 12-year-old in Norway before his father , an executive with a Norwegian fertilizer company , was transferred to Hong Kong . &quot; There was a big sports center near where we lived and some of the best players practiced there , so it was OK , &quot; Bach said . &quot; I graduated their version of high_school when I was 15 . I felt I was too young to go_to college , so I just played tennis in Norway for a year . I played a lot of international junior tennis and was ranked as high as 37th in the world , but the days were long and I was lonely. &quot; So Bach went_to a tennis academy in Florida for a year and devoted himself to studying English and backhands . It was there he decided to go_to college in the United States . He hadn ' t been a student for two years but soon found himself at_home in Irvine ' s classrooms and on the courts . He is a two-time Big West Scholar Athlete and compiled a 35-24 singles record in his first two seasons with Irvine , competing mostly at No . 3 . He won 11 of his last 12 matches last year and his second consecutive flight three Big West singles title . This season , Bach is 2-4 in singles , but that includes an 0-3 mark at the No . 2 position and losses to USC ' s Jon Leach , ranked 43rd in the nation , and Stanford All-American Vimal Patel . Bach is working hard to overcome his slow-court background and develop a more aggressive style of play . &quot; Fredrik ' s on his way to developing an all-court game , &quot; Coach Steve Clark said . &quot; He had a great summer , was a finalist at the Norwegian championships , so his baseline game is obviously established . What he ' s striving for now is developing an attack game. &quot; Bach says it ' s more a matter of mind-set than anything else . &quot; I can do_it and I do_it in practice , but when you ' re playing a match and a little bit nervous , you tend to fall_back to what ' s most comfortable , &quot; he said . &quot; But I ' ve worked a lot on it in practice and hopefully , without thinking_about it , it will start to seep into my matches. &quot; * Porous perimeter : Early in the season , you could pass it off as misfortune . Maybe opponents ' three-point shooters were just hot against the Anteaters . But it has become a trend as clear as an opposing jump-shooter ' s view of the basket -- the Anteaters aren ' t doing much of a job when it comes_to defending the perimeter . Irvine ' s conference opponents are shooting 46 % from three-point range , by far the highest percentage allowed_in the Big West . More important , when the Anteaters do a decent job of defending outside shots , they often win . In Irvine ' s three conference victories , Cal State Fullerton , Utah State and Nevada made 13 of 43 three-pointers . ( 30 % ) . Coach Rod Baker thinks his team is doing a better job of getting_out and harassing outside shooters , but recent results aren ' t encouraging . Las Vegas and New Mexico State combined to hit 15 of 27 three-point shots -- a whopping 56 % -- last week . that ' s 45 points in 27 possessions and better than shooting 80 % from two-point range . Anteater Notes Irvine will be host for the Big West swimming and diving championships this weekend at Belmont Plaza in Long_Beach . UC Santa Barbara ' s men ' s and women ' s teams are the defending champions . The event is Sunday through Tuesday with preliminaries at 10:30 a.m. each day and the finals at 6 p.m. . . . The women ' s basketball_team had a rare chance to celebrate in a snowstorm Saturday night in Reno after its last-second , 64-63 , victory . The Anteaters ( 3-19 and 2-12 in the Big West ) won for the first time on_the_road in 17 games . The victory completed a sweep of the Wolf_Pack , Irvine ' s first since the 1990-91 season .</TEXT>
