   <HEADLINE> ROBIN ABCARIAN : SHE ' LL PASS ON BEING A BRIDESMAID , THANK YOU</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This spring and summer , we have witnessed another trickle of our friends plunge into the great , roiling sea of matrimony . I love weddings . Almost as much as I dread them . Or more precisely : I love attending weddings almost as much as I dread being in them . I love the way we check our cynicism at the door , the way we believe the marriage_license is signed_in indelible_ink , the way that hope and promise -- such vaporous concepts -- are distilled into potent , intoxicating kisses at ceremony ' s end . But stick me in a wedding as a bridesmaid and I wilt faster than a cut tulip in a dry vase under heat lights . I can ' t take it . I cannot say why ; I can only say when . In 1982 , my friend Susan married a tall , handsome and , as it would turn_out , hugely incompatible guy . As maid of honor , I wore a pale coral dress of silk crepe that Susan had found in an antique store and mailed to me balled_up in a ripped manila envelope . Ah , to be young and carefree . And have a waistline . Boy , does that dress look tiny today . Susan ' s parents had offered her an option -- a down_payment on a house or a wedding fit for a princess . Well , who can begrudge the high cost of plighting an especially fervent troth ? Naturally , they took the wedding and spoke their vows in a fancy ceremony at the Claremont Hotel in the Berkeley hills . Halfway through , the groom looked_at me and widened his eyes . &quot; Nervous ? &quot; he seemed to be saying . &quot; You ' d better believe it , sister. &quot; Suddenly , I began to channel his anxiety . My peripheral vision went hazy . Thinking fast -- or what passes for fast when you ' re dizzy -- I delicately sat_down on the edge of the riser . Guests looked_on , some horrified , some curious , some believing they were witnessing a sudden religious conversion . It was just me , trying valiantly not to pass_out . The reception_line was a nightmare . People filed past murmuring : &quot; Congratulations. &quot; &quot; Congratulations. &quot; &quot; Are you OK ? &quot; Or : &quot; Congratulations. &quot; &quot; Congratulations. &quot; &quot; You find Jesus up there or something ? &quot; Susan was inhumanly gracious . &quot; Thank you , &quot; she said . &quot; You made my wedding memorable. &quot; Years later , I was able to provide my brother the same exact memory at his wedding . * A few years ago , my husband and I returned to the site of our wedding . We had taken our vows in the yard of a historic Ventura County adobe , under the gaze of an owl sitting in a bountiful eucalyptus_tree . I was moved to tears wandering the premises , recalling the sunny , breezy day in which we promised to . . . well , I am not exactly sure what we promised to do since we seem to have misplaced our copy of the wedding vows . My husband looked rather emotional , too , and I remember thinking how lovely it was that he was so touched to be there . &quot; Isn ' t it amazing , &quot; I started to say , before he looked_at me with an almost pained expression . &quot; Wow , &quot; I thought , &quot; this guy is a sentimental fool. &quot; &quot; Man ! &quot; he said . &quot; I gotta take_a_leak ! &quot; You talk_about your great roiling sea of matrimony . * In a season stained by stories about the horrible ways in which spouses inflict pain upon each other , it ' s tempting to see marriage as a new car , a thing that starts_out shiny and perfect and inevitably rusts right through ( although the decay often hides under a well-polished exterior ) . My husband and I , soldered together for nearly a dozen years now , always get squishy at weddings . Often , we ice our good vibes with a big fight on the way home . The cake of love , my friends , is a many-layered thing . One of the benefits of being married for a while is the ever-expanding view you get of the emotional landscape . Maybe the passion cools a bit ( or maybe it doesn ' t ) and maybe after a while the fights are less cataclysmic too . But what you learn with the passing of every still-married year is that each peak is followed by a valley , and every valley gives_way to a higher place . Watching a couple marry can do wonders to counteract the prevailing ill winds . Weddings can renew your faith , and remind you -- as you sit with your own spouse , if you have one -- that marriage is not a shiny car waiting to be assaulted by the elements . It is a fine and demanding instrument that needs constant burnishing and tuning , and which -- the occasional broken string notwithstanding -- rewards with incomparable music . My friend Susan married again this spring , living proof you can learn from your mistakes . To this union , she brought a certain maturity , a certain understanding of the complexities of marriage and -- need I spell it out ? -- a new maid of honor .</TEXT>
