   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEWS ; BRAVURA HIGHLIGHTS ' LAX / 94 ' AT LACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Full of energy , if disjointed , the &quot; LAX / 94 &quot; exhibition at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions features sculptures , photographs and drawings by Annie Appel , Charles Dickson , Kayren E . Lyle and Mary Cecile Gee ; a video projection by Jennifer Steinkamp ; and a series of performances by the Antenna Repairmen , a musical_group who &quot; play &quot; ceramic vessels made by sculptor Stephen Freedman . The visual arts component of the show adheres to the organization ' s longtime commitment to identity politics . Too often in LACE ' s history , this commitment has come at the expense of aesthetic sophistication . Aesthetic criteria , however , seem somewhat irrelevant given the sheer bravura of the work of Dickson and Lyle , in particular . Lyle ' s emotionally impassioned and visually spectacular &quot; Stand_by Your Man &quot; is a frenzied , red-lit altar to the African American male . Festooned with candles , beads , cloth dolls and photographs of everyone from unnamed family members to Malcolm X and Nat Turner , the piece marries spiritually coded forms to an explicitly didactic message : African American men have been demonized by the media . If the marriage is not completely satisfying , neither is it gratuitous . The same can be said for Dickson ' s work , especially the massive installation that dominates LACE ' s main room . A series of door frames surrounded by African fetish-figures , cast body_parts crucified with golden spikes and a chariot-style vehicle laden with chains , barbed wire and shells , the piece is a narrative -- a morality tale about unvanquished hopes . The scale complements the importance of its theme . Appel ' s photographs of flames and Gee ' s drawings of cruciform shapes cannot possibly compete , although their interest is admittedly slight . All but lost in this over-heated context , they belong in another show entirely . Steinkamp , given the luxury of_her_own room , fares much better with an elegant installation that confirms her position as the most interesting artist in Los Angeles working in digital media . &quot; Elbowroom &quot; is one of Steinkamp ' s signature projection environments , constructed from a computer animation . She plays with the terms of modernist abstraction -- color and form , figure and ground -- while wickedly mocking its academicized sterility . Covered with an oscillating pattern of blue and pink light , the walls seem to be breathing . Steinkamp reminds us that painting isn ' t dead : It just takes a while to recognize . * Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions , 6522 Hollywood Blvd. , Hollywood , ( 213 ) 957-1777 , through Jan . 8 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . Homoerotic Utopia : Tom Bianchi ' s new photographs at Couturier Gallery describe a homoerotic utopia where men with massive pecs , delts and lats embrace one another in the surf , dart in and out of shady coves and collapse , exhausted , in their well-appointed beach home -- without generating so_much as a raised eyebrow . Bianchi ' s celebration of homosexual love is matter-of-fact , but not unflinching . It has decidedly political overtones , yet it is only incidentally confrontational . Though he credits Robert Mapplethorpe as an important influence , Bianchi ' s soft-core images are far closer to Herb Ritts ' photographs of a nude Cindy Crawford : sexy , commercial and rather silly for any pretensions otherwise . Like Ritts ( and most fashion photographers ) , Bianchi is a myth-maker . It ' s somewhat irrelevant that his subjects here are two &quot; real &quot; people , the &quot; best-known gay couple in America &quot; according to the flyleaf of Bianchi ' s new book , &quot; Bob and Rod , &quot; from which these images are taken . Bob and Rod are indeed men in_love , but they are also good-natured , well-muscled props , deployed to advertise a total lifestyle : specific workout regimes , spending habits , leisure activities , aesthetic choices and , of course , sexual orientations . If Tom of Finland ' s cartoons codified a certain vision of macho homosexuality , Bianchi ' s images interpellate the gay male as consumer . Most interesting are those photographs that acknowledge the gay male predilection for high camp . In one , a grinning Bob and Rod pose at the edge of a glitzy swimming_pool , each holding a colossal leaf over the other ' s presumably colossal genitals . In what is certainly the most amusing image in the show , Bob and Rod pose inside an abandoned , mock-classical structure . Standing atop a broken column , their arms raised flamboyantly in the air , the naked lovers incarnate undying phallic rectitude . Consumers of this particular myth , straight or gay , are likely to be legion . * Couturier Gallery , 166 N . La Brea Ave. , ( 213 ) 933-5557 , through Dec . 31 . Closed Sundays and Mondays . Ordinary People : Stern J . Bramson was a commercial photographer from Louisville , Ky. , who spent his life documenting rather ordinary things : a party for employees and their families at the National Cash_Register Corp. ; a re-enactment of an car accident ; four generations of a single family , from a wizened great-grandfather to his acorn-faced great-grandson . On view at Paul Kopeikin Gallery is a charming group of Bramson ' s photographs . Culled from the files of the Royal Photography Co. , the family_business in which Bramson worked from 1946 until it was sold ( negatives and all ) in 1973 , these images have been discovered by the art world , and accordingly celebrated . It ' s easy to see why . Normality doesn ' t often appear this peculiar -- at least , not without bearing traces of an artist who is trying too hard . This isn ' t to say that Bramson ' s photographs lack self-consciousness ; rather , they lack guile . Surreal juxtapositions and pictorial puns abound , but they are a perfunctory effect . A 1946 picture of a group of models staring up , enraptured , at a blank projector screen seems like something out of Allen Ruppersberg or John Baldessari . Yet , given the fact that the image certainly documented something ( a newfangled technology ? the models ' cardigans ? their matching hairdos ? ) , it is no conceptual fillip ; it ' s truly bizarre . Equally strange is a contemporaneous photograph taken inside a factory . Bramson observes the photographer on call getting ready to shoot . The foreman points down toward the floor , yet there is nothing for the photographer to see there . This image would be a fine example of the notion that a photograph automatically renders that which it captures extraordinary , even when what it captures is thin air . Yet Bramson is no critical theorist , and his innocence makes the work that much more appealing . Without a doubt , however , the best of the lot is a 1962 photograph of magician Baron Lavelle at_home with his wife and children . Docile creatures they are , helping Dad with his work . While Mom floats through the air with her eyes shut tightly , the Baron ' s daughter allows herself to be sawed in two , her shoes abandoned on the floor next to her disembodied feet . The Baron ' s heir_apparent , sliced in two at the waist , rests_on the coffee_table like an anthropomorphic cookie_jar . Who ' s the real magician here ? This is as close as Bramson gets_to winking . * Paul Kopeikin Gallery , 170 S . La Brea Ave. , ( 213 ) 937-0765 , through Saturday . Out of Site : In theory , a site-specific work_of_art doesn ' t just sit there , self-contained and circumspect ; it engages with its site . Though this sounds woefully obvious , experience shows it isn ' t . Marcos Luytens ' site-specific project in the La Brea Tar_Pits indeed engages with its locale , one of the juiciest in Los Angeles . But it does the bare minimum , sinking a great opportunity in a platitudinous quagmire . Pit No . 4 , the site of Luytens ' intervention , was excavated in 1913 . A fenced-off soup of plundered tar does remain -- not as dramatic as the big pit along Wilshire Boulevard , with its make-believe dinosaurs , but pretty evocative , nonetheless . No fewer than 360 skulls were collected there , including those of the saber-toothed cat , the dire wolf and the grand sloth . What Luytens chose to do here was collect modern-day cast-offs ( old tires , shopping_carts and broken TV_sets ) ; enrobe them in shrink-wrap , his signature material ; and place them in the tar_pit . These are meant to be future ruins of the industrial age , stuck_in the primeval bitumen . Luytens wants to tell a cautionary tale about our propensity for waste and our casual abuse of the environment . The tale has been told countless times . Luytens squanders his chance to lend it new urgency by doing something so predictable . He might have exploited the connotations of shrink-wrapped fossils -- packaged for easy consumption by scientists ( or artists ) seeking after immortality . But he doesn ' t do anything vaguely intriguing . Instead , he entombs site-specific cliches . * George C . Page Museum , ( Outside in the Tar_Pits ) , 5801 Wilshire Blvd. , ( 213 ) 857-6311 , through Dec . 29 .</TEXT>
