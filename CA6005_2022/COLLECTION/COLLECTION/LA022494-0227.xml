   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : DEFINING THE FUTURE OF TV ; HOW THE U.S. WON ROUND ONE IN THE BATTLE OVER STANDARDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After spending billions trying to bully America into doubling the video resolution of its analog television_sets , Japan finally conceded that the D in HDTV will have to stand_for digital . The very next day , the Japanese commenced a furious backpedal -- right off a cliff . But all this sound and fury signifies nothing . Even Japan Inc. can ' t impose an outdated technology by group incantation . America ' s model of manipulable multimedia will thus succeed Japan ' s vision of high-definition video . The Federal Communications Commission and U.S. companies , not Japan ' s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications or Sony or Sega , will set the world ' s technical standards for tomorrow ' s generation of living_room media . In short , we won ! At least for the moment . Of course , there ' s nothing inherent in the new FCC-Zenith standard that would deny a Sony , Matsushita or Samsung the opportunity to dominate digital TV_sets the way they ' ve ruled the manufacture of today ' s televisions . Creating a standard does not guarantee any market share ; just ask RCA . Yet American media companies have become far more sophisticated than their global counterparts about the role of standards in defining competitiveness . Today , innovative standards -- not merely innovative technologies -- have become the true battlefield for global multimedia . A standard has to be more_than a product , a service or a technical format . It must be a framework for innovation . Creating new standards is not like developing new products : Your competitive edge comes not from what you keep secret and proprietary , but from what you make open and accessible . Successful American companies understand this . Most Japanese companies still do not . For example , Sony ' s Betamax VCR failed not because it was an inferior technical offering but because the company managed it as a product rather than a platform for design . ( JVC and Matsushita managed VHS less as a global standard than as a set of technical specifications to gang_up on Sony. ) More_than a decade ago , the launch of the audio_compact_disc standard by Sony and Philips was brilliantly managed , but the Dutch electronics giant ' s recent efforts to establish CD-interactive as a multimedia standard have been a failure . Similarly , 3DO ' s new multimedia player -- though technically intriguing and sponsored by the_likes_of Matsushita and AT &amp; T -- has been a disappointment , not merely because the software isn ' t there to support it , but because hardware firms insist that the business incentives to make_it a standard just aren ' t there . The collapse of Japan ' s HDTV initiative didn ' t just reflect the technical triumph of American digital over Japanese analog . It also reflects a sober business assessment that it would be very hard for anyone but the Japanese to make real money supporting this standard . As a global business proposition , HDTV ' s standards infrastructure was poorly designed and poorly defined . Who understands the business of standards better than anyone ? Probably Bill Gates and Microsoft . Microsoft really isn ' t in the software business ; it ' s in the standards business . Microsoft succeeds not because it writes the best code but because it sets the best standards . Microsoft Windows -- the personal_computer software that made Gates a multibillionaire -- was nurtured and developed to be a standard , not just another operating system . Prices are kept low , third-party suppliers can easily make lots of money and the system is constantly and collaboratively upgraded to keep it supple . Microsoft ' s goal was emphatically not the maximization of revenue or even market share ; it was creating relationships with customers , software developers and microprocessor firms such_as Intel to give as_many good reasons as possible to support -- strategically , financially and technically -- Microsoft ' s operating systems . These networks of relationships -- not superior technology or marketing savvy -- are what make a standard something more_than a product . The standard is not the product of a company , it ' s the byproduct of these networks . Managing the standard means managing these networks . IBM understood this too late . Apple understood but failed to act . Nintendo understood but didn ' t care . The FCC understood , and that ' s why its digital HDTV standard has just conquered Japan . Of course , Microsoft is chatting with John Malone ' s TCI and the cable TV industry about how to bring Windows to the set-top box , and the company recently announced it would collaborate with Sega to create a new standard for video_game technology . * Unlike Nintendo , which parlayed a proprietary standard to riches but is now suffering as a result , Microsoft seems likely to bring its brand of standards to home entertainment . It will be interesting to watch how standards intersect when Windows comes_to digital TV . Don ' t touch that mouse ! Or remote_control . . . or joystick . . . Paradoxically , standards have become so important in media technology that there is now a strong market incentive to make them unimportant . Why not design a new generation of technologies that , rather than rendering existing standards obsolete , merely makes them irrelevant ? How do you do that ? Microprocessors and memories are getting ever faster , ever cheaper . Use the technology to supersede the standards . Why not a television_set or a cable box or a &quot; media converter &quot; that ' s smart enough to play whatever media standard is plugged_in ? Load the operating system right along with the program . For example , your CD-ROM can be in Windows or Macintosh or Unix or HDTV -- it doesn ' t matter . Your player would simply load_up the appropriate standard on its chips and the program you wanted to play -- then off you go . Or your set-top box could configure your digital TV to play NTSC , PAL , SECAM , Nintendo , Windows or whatever format your fiber-optic line piped_down into your cable TV . In other words , tomorrow ' s technologies could make all_the effort being invested in today ' s media standards irrelevant . Are the Japanese working on this new generation of silicon ? What do you think ?</TEXT>
