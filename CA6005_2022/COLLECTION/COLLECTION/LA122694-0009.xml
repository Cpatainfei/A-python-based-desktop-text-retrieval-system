   <HEADLINE> CHINA ROUGHS UP HONG KONG ; BEIJING VENTS ITS ANGER OVER REFORMS AS THE BRITISH COLONY NEARS ITS HISTORIC CHANGE IN 1997</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Uncertainty clouds the future in Hong Kong as Beijing flexes its muscle on a number of issues affecting the_British colony after its scheduled return to China in 1997 . Still bristling_at the electoral reforms introduced by Hong Kong ' s last British governor , Chris Patten , China is making some worrisome changes that undermine the 1984 Sino-British agreement to allow Hong Kong to preserve its economic and social way_of_life for 50 years under a Chinese policy of &quot; one country , two systems. &quot; First , Beijing has vowed to replace the Hong Kong Legislature , which will be elected next year under new British reforms , with lawmakers of its own choosing . The appointed legislature would serve for an interim period . Beijing has also indicated that it will reject any substantial changes in laws passed_by the legitimately elected Hong Kong Legislature between now and 1997 . New questions about what legal_system might or might not be in place in Hong Kong under the Chinese are unsettling . The Sino-British agreement provides_for the creation of a Court of Final Appeal as the territory ' s supreme legal authority after 1997 . At issue now are the representation and composition of that court . Controversy over that does not inspire confidence . There are concerns about existing Draconian laws that restrict press freedom , especially in light of Beijing ' s recent imprisonment of two journalists . In a speech to the National Press Club in Washington last month , Daisy Li Yuet-wah , vice_chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Assn. , described press freedom as an &quot; endangered species. &quot; She cited increasing pressures for journalists to change to fit into a Chinese system . Also troubling are recent incidents of self-censorship in publishing and broadcasting . TVB , a leading station in Hong Kong , had the broadcasting rights but refused to air two BBC documentaries , one on Mao Tse-tung and another on Chinese labor camps , to avoid embarrassing China . Some Hong Kong publishers are refusing to print schoolbooks that would be used after 1997 without assurances that the books , designed to accompany a new 1996 curriculum , will not be rejected by the Chinese government . The publishers believe chances are slim that the Chinese will accept any textbook written under the_British administration . Such developments do not portend a smooth transition from British rule to Chinese sovereignty . They send all_the wrong signals to those within and outside Hong Kong . But Beijing still has the opportunity to restore faith in its &quot; one country , two systems &quot; policy . It needs to work with and for the people of Hong Kong rather than venting its anger at Gov . Patten and his reforms .</TEXT>
