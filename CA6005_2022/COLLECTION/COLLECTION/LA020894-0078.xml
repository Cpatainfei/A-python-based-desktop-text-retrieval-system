   <HEADLINE> CALL HIM VIKING VOYAGER ; OLYMPICS : FOR VEGARD ULVANG , WINNING SKIING MEDALS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE ADVENTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> And for his next trick , Vegard the Viking will sky-dive from a biplane onto the back of a dog sled , which he will mush to a triumphant victory in Alaska ' s Iditarod . Then he will swim the Bering Strait , ski across Siberia to his home_in Kirkenes in the far north of Norway , where he will go bear hunting with a switch . And in the afternoon . . . . These days , when the talk gets_around_to adventuring , Vegard the Viking ' s is one of the first_names that pops_up . In his professional_life , he is Vegard Ulvang -- that ' s WAY-guard OOL-wahng , which doesn ' t have quite the ring of Vegard the Viking -- one of the stars of the star-studded Norwegian cross-country ski_racing team , winner of four medals two years ago in the Albertville Games , three golds and a silver , and former winner of the World Cup title . In his spare_time , the world is his playground . He climbs mountains . He treks across forbidding terrain in areas best known to the nomads who live there . He skis where only other adventurers -- or perhaps none -- have skied before . He has tried sky-diving . And if he said he was going_to run with the bulls at Pamplona , no one would be surprised . He probably would wind_up chasing them . So what ' s with this guy ? Isn ' t it enough , at 30 , to be one of the world ' s great athletes , a national hero in a ski-crazy country who earns nearly $ 1 million annually on his skinny slats ? can ' t he simply bask in the adulation and spend his time_off playing_at Monte Carlo ? Must he attempt these offbeat ventures ? This skiing across Greenland ? This climbing of four mountains on four continents in a five-week period ? This trekking across Mongolia ? This canoeing in the wilds of Siberia ? He must . &quot; I like challenges , &quot; Ulvang said the other day from Davos , Switzerland , where he and his Norwegian teammates were concluding high-altitude training for the Lillehammer Winter_Olympics , in which he hopes to win more gold . &quot; I do ( adventuring ) because I like it . It ' s not so dangerous . People only think it is dangerous because the media says so . But these things , many I have been doing all my life . I was born with a close contact with nature , so it is not unusual for me . &quot; Besides , it is good always to have a goal . And it is all good preparation for life as a skier . It is a way to stay in training without training. &quot; Not dangerous , he says : -- In the summer of 1990 , on the way down from Denali , the former Mt . McKinley in Alaska , Ulvang ' s brother and adventuring companion , Ketil , went_through the ice of Wonder Lake , and eventually , in trying to pull him out , so did Ulvang and Frenchman Pierre Gay-Perret , their mountain-climbing mentor . Ulvang got_out , pulled the others out , then stayed with the nearly unconscious Ketil while Gay-Perret ran_for help . Park rangers later lifted Ketil out by helicopter . -- In the summer of 1991 , Ulvang and Gay-Perret decided to ski across Greenland , following the 350-mile route used by Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen on a six-week journey in 1888 . With their modern equipment , they figured , it would take 20 days , and they packed 20 days ' worth of food . Storms early in the trip left them far behind schedule , however , and short of supplies , if they were to stick_to their schedule . Instead , they went_on short rations and picked_up the pace , finishing the trip in 14 days and , in Ulvang ' s case , 25 pounds lighter . -- The summer after his Albertville triumph , he and a group of other Norwegians went_on their climbing spree . He conquered Mt . Elbrus on the Russian-Georgian border , Mt . Kilimanjaro in Tanzania , Mt . Puncak Jaya in New Guinea , and nearly conquered Mt . Aconcagua in Argentina before being turned_back by bad_weather . When the group reached 16 # 600 feet , Ulvang and another climber were chosen for the assault on the the 22 # 834-foot summit . The other climber turned_back at 19 # 000 feet , fearing he had frozen his toes , and Ulvang continued alone . He reached 22 # 000 feet , then a storm hit and the wind threatened to blow him off the mountain . Fearing an avalanche , he too turned_back . -- Last summer , Ulvang , Gay-Perret and Vladimir Smirnov , a former Soviet cross-country_skiing star who now represents his native Kazakhstan , trekked across Mongolia . Along the way , their Mongolian guide disappeared . Suspecting foul_play , Mongolian authorities told the adventurers nobody could leave until it was learned what had become of the guide . He turned_up four days later , trying to cross the border into Russia . And those are only the narrow_escapes Ulvang has told us about . Even when he isn ' t particularly looking_for trouble , Ulvang sometimes finds it . He spent two days last fall_in Sarajevo , the 1984 Winter Olympic city turned battleground , representing an Olympic relief organization . Driving through town , he and his group came under sniper fire . Mt . Everest was to have been this summer ' s adventure , and it still may be . First , though , Ulvang has a grim bit of family_business to attend_to . Ketil , a physical_therapist , dropped_out of sight last October not far from Kirkenes , about 250 miles north of the Arctic_Circle , and hasn ' t been seen since . Returning home one evening with a group of other physical_therapists from a professional engagement , Ketil , 32 , got_out of the car , saying he would run the rest of the way through the woods . He had run in those woods all his life , and the 17-mile distance figured to be about a two-hour workout for him . He never arrived home . Vegard , training in the Italian Alps , quickly flew home to help in the subsequent search , said to be one of the most intensive in Norwegian history . Mounting snow , however , thwarted searchers , dogs and high-tech tracing devices . Tracks that might not even have been Ketil ' s were inconclusive and quickly disappeared . So Ulvang ' s first order_of_business , he said , when spring comes_to Kirkenes and the snow has melted , will be to find his brother ' s body . &quot; I will look_for him until I find him , &quot; he said . Until then , there is nothing he can do , so he does what he always does_in the winter . He trains for skiing and he skis . &quot; It was a tragedy for me and my family , but I try to think_of him in a positive way , as an inspiration for the Olympics , &quot; Ulvang said . &quot; I think that would have been his wish. &quot; In the two years since Albertville , Ulvang ' s star has dimmed a bit , and Bjorn Daehli , who also won three golds and a silver in the ' 92 Games , has become the dominant Norwegian . Still , Ulvang figures he is as ready as he can be , that gold is not out_of_the_question for him . &quot; I still love skiing , &quot; he said . &quot; The most interesting challenge still is pushing my body . The last week has been a little bit boring because we ' ve been winding down our hard training , skiing hard in the morning , then relaxing . I love to go skiing -- I ' ve skied all my life -- and if I ski well , I still can win. &quot; There figure to be as_many as 100 # 000 home-grown fans for any given cross-country event -- Norwegian fans overwhelmed Albertville -- and they will surely celebrate if Daehlie wins some races , as anticipated . And if Vegard the Viking turns_in a surprise , the din will be heard from here to Kirkenes .</TEXT>
