   <TEXT> My friend Cindy died five months ago of metastatic breast_cancer . There is a new drug that provides hope for a lasting remission for the 1.6 million women in this country who , like Cindy , suffer from breast_cancer that has not responded to other medical treatments.But these women cannot receive the drug in the United States . Why ? Because the drug is RU-486 , the so-called abortion_pill , and the pro-life movement opposes it . A modified version of RU-486 shows promise for women resistant to tamoxifen , widely used for treating advanced breast_cancer . But even if the FDA approves RU-486 for this use , the manufacturer is unwilling to distribute it here because of promises of boycotts and harassment . One evening , when Cindy could no longer walk and would cry from uncontrollable pain , she said to me , &quot; I ' m sorry . This is the best I can do. &quot; I hope many_more women do not have to die before our policymakers find the courage to say , &quot; This is not the best we can do ; we can do much more. &quot;</TEXT>
