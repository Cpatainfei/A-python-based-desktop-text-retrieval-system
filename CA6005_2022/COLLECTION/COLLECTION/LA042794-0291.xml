   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; ORANGE COUNTY REMEMBERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; In 1972 , when I was barely 7 years old , I shook Richard Nixon ' s hand after he exited his helicopter and was being taken by a golf_cart to his residence at Casa Pacifica . I will never forget the energized crowd chanting ' Four More Years , ' the signs , pomp and pageantry . . . . When they tore_down the building that housed Nixon ' s first law office in La Habra ( my hometown ) I stopped and took one of the bricks that was part of the building . I keep it knowing it will bring inspiration to be , as enlightened a thinker as was Richard M . Nixon. &quot; -- Peter J . Sterling , Costa Mesa &quot; I was 5 years old , and Nixon and daddy would get_together in the living room . We had this big green stuffed rocking chair and as a little_girl I ' d sit in his lap and hear his deep voice and I just idolized him . . . . You know how it is when somebody walks into a room and you feel their power ? Well , you knew when he was in a room. &quot; -- Linda Day Baker , Newport Beach , daughter of Nixon ' s first campaign manager &quot; My fondest memory of Richard Nixon is the $ 50 bet I collected from former Rep . James B . Utt in 1962 . Utt disputed my prediction that Pat Brown would easily defeat Nixon and asked me o put my money where my mouth was . Watergate and Nixon ' s criminal role in it came as no surprise to me , because of his history of viciously smearing political opponents , starting with Jerry Voorhis and Helen Gahagan Douglas . In addition , dirty tricks were a hallmark of every campaign he ran. &quot; -- Carroll C . Gewin , Fullerton &quot; In 1960 , immediately following the convention , he returned to Whittier to begin a long summer and fall campaign . I was 13 years old , and we were recruited to help clean_up the Whittier College football_stadium where he was to deliver a speech following a downtown parade . As our reward for helping clean the stadium and help construct the podium area . . . the Secret_Service gave us a ride around the stadium track aboard the Secret_Service car . At 13 years old , we were delighted and thrilled. &quot; -- Todd Nicholson , Tustin &quot; The Watergate fiasco and its consequent damage to the presidency overshadow any of Richard Nixon ' s accomplishments , not because the debacle occurred under his watch , but because he lied to the American people. &quot; -- Michael C . Westlund , Garden Grove &quot; Nixon was a great President , the best and greatest statesman in the century . He was a wonderful man. &quot; -- Michael J . Chu , Irvine &quot; One of my earliest_childhood memories goes_back to 1962 when Richard Nixon ran_for governor of California . We lived a_few blocks from one of his campaign stops , Stonewood Mall in Downey , and my parents took us kids to see the spectacle . That day I became a Nixon supporter at the age of 5 , much to my father ' s consternation . I would have joined the campaign , but I wasn ' t allowed to cross the street. &quot; -- Thomas D . Smith , Downey &quot; I worked for him in the ' 72 campaign , got_to shake his hand for the first time at Casa Pacifica , met many celebrities and actually had a good time working for him . . . . I was one of his chief campus apologists at Fullerton High_School , his alma_mater , back in the 1970s . We were six-year residents of Yorba Linda and finally got a chance to meet him and have my picture taken with him in 1992 at the Nixon Library . My most vivid memory is a sign_in the window of a bus carrying U.S. POWs to the airport to take them back to the United States at the end of the Vietnam_War , which simply read , &quot; God Bless Nixon. &quot; I ' ll never forget that image and hopefully nobody else will either. &quot; -- Jeff Weber , Irvine &quot; Before we eulogize Nixon , let ' s not forget his vice_president and all his lieutenants had to resign in disgrace . In fact , Spiro Agnew should have done jail time for bribery while in high office . Nixon ' s accomplishments should be tempered with that fact . Corruption was the rule of the day. &quot; -- William M . Wilson , Westminster &quot; Although he was a political and economic conservative , he never tried to court the religious right and activate their agenda as the law_of_the_land . . . . In a way , that ' s as good a memory of Nixon as the foreign accomplishments he achieved. &quot; -- Alan Rosenstein , Laguna Beach &quot; I was about 10 years old ( and living ) in Beijing , China , when I first saw President Nixon on television . I had no idea then that this man would change my life . Because he normalized U.S.-China relations during that trip , my family and I were able to come_to the United States in 1975 . Today I have a wonderful and happy family . I feel very grateful to him.... I will miss him very much. &quot; -- Lydia Yu , Irvine &quot; I felt misled by Richard Nixon and tried_for years to understand his reasons . I never did . But I tried to focus_on the good he accomplished . . . . Only a fool would say Nixon ' s many successes were not diminished by Watergate . I will remember the Nixon who was admired by his classmates in college , who served his country with honor in World_War_II , and especially for his love and devotion to family . I hope Richard Nixon the man will be remembered by history , and not Nixon the politician -- but for some this may be very difficult. &quot; -- George Grupe , Newport Beach &quot; I met him at his niece Maureen ' s wedding in the late 1960s . I was struck by his willingness to visit the wedding guests in the receiving line , and then allow the wedding to take_place without any grandstanding or politicking . . . . To see him marching down the aisle before the wedding_party , hearing the song Hail to the Chief , will always be in my memory and his graciousness at the party always will too. &quot; -- Carolyn Williams , Yorba Linda &quot; July 7 , 1969 , I received a call from a staff_member at the White_House saying , ' President Nixon would like to have you preach at the White_House next Sunday. ' I went_to Washington on the Saturday before the 13th day of July . . . and visited with the family . But before being escorted to the East Room , ( which was ) filled with invitees from Supreme Court justices to senators and representatives , I had the privilege of a private conversation with the President for about a half-hour . It was a very great experience in my life , one which I will never forget , and I am forever thankful for the opportunity that I had. &quot; -- Paul Noren , Fullerton &quot; In 1969 , as editor of the Anti-Defamation League ' s national publication , I reported on President Nixon ' s warm reception of then-Prime Minister Golda Meir on the White_House lawn before some 300 guests , including American Jewish leaders . . . . In an exchange of toasts at dinner , President Nixon said : ' The people of Israel deserve peace -- not the fragile peace that comes_with the kinds of documents that neither party has an interest in keeping -- but the kind of peace that will last. ' In her concluding remarks , Golda Meir thanked Nixon for ' enabling me to go_home and tell my people that we have a great and dear friend. &quot; ' -- Lynne Ianniello , Laguna Hills &quot; My memory is from September of 1979 , when my family was vacationing in the Fiji Islands . We were dying to know how the Angels were doing_in the playoffs . One morning , the local Fiji newspaper had a front page photograph of Bobby Grich pouring Champagne over Nixon ' s head . The Angels had won the division , and Nixon was in the clubhouse celebrating with the players . It was a terrific thing to see. &quot; -- Betty Betts , Anaheim &quot; I was the naval aide present at a small reception in the White_House in January , 1969 , between the Inaugural Parade and the Inaugural Ball when we installed President Nixon . I met his family , and a_few select friends such_as Sen . Everett Dirksen , who played a duet on the piano with his boyhood piano_teacher . It was quite a time. &quot; -- Charles McKenna , Irvine &quot; I ' ll remember Richard Nixon as being our greatest modern President in the arena of international relations -- his recognition of China , and also detente with the Soviet_Union . The thing I ' ll remember in particular is the story of him . . . in the White_House , early in the morning , shaving his face in the bathroom and thinking_about superpower relations while doing so . I don ' t think we ' ve had a President since then that has those capabilities. &quot; -- Ken March , Orange &quot; Growing_up in Modesto , Calif. , my father was a teacher . He took me as a 16-year-old high schooler to hear Nixon campaign for President . We went_to the Modesto courthouse . My father was a Democrat , but he wanted me to be aware politically of what was going_on . Years later , I was lucky enough to attend the dedication of the Nixon Library in 1990. &quot; -- Judith Davis , Fullerton &quot; I think he lifted conservative intellectuals , then and now , out of the morass of isolationism in a most visionary manner . His successors , Democrat and Republican , sought him out regularly for his insightful analyses , especially relating to the international arena . As a human_being , he was one of those rare people who developed a symbiotic relationship with his lifelong spouse . When she passed_away , it was only a matter of time before he would join her.... I think the country and the world have lost someone very special. &quot; -- Victor Poltrock , La Habra &quot; I was in my 20s when I remember seeing the President on TV , dodging , sneaking and disgracing the greatest office in our land . . . . It broke my faith in politicians , and I think a lot of Americans lost faith in the greatness of our leaders. &quot; -- Emma Emerson , Silverado Canyon &quot; Nixon came_to my high_school when I was 14 years old . It was San Marino High , a very Republican town . He sat with us to have lunch , he and his wife , and he impressed me so_much . I felt very close to him . After that , I wrote him a personal_letter and he wrote me a letter back . I still have it and cherish it . I was there when he came_back ( to California ) , the day he resigned . I took my children to see him because I felt he was a phenomenal President. &quot; -- Peggie McDonald , Dana Point &quot; In 1972 , I was a sophomore at Georgetown University . I was_active in the Young Democrats ; opposites attract , however , and I was dating a young Republican . He took me to the Inaugural Ball . We were standing near where Nixon entered and he came_over . And of all_the people there , he chose to dance with me . He was very pleasant , very polite , and even complimented me on my dress , which happened to be a bridesmaid ' s gown which I had made_over for the occasion . He signed my Inaugural Ball program and was soon off . I felt_like Cinderella , and I guess it did have some impact . I married a Republican , though not the one that took me to the ball ! &quot; -- Jane DellaGrotta , Newport Beach &quot; My father was in Vietnam when President Eisenhower died , and we were living_in Salina , Kan. , when President Nixon landed in Salina en route to Abilene for the funeral . Then I went_to Vietnam -- and my citation was signed under his direction. &quot; -- Bob Baker , Anaheim &quot; I ' ll never forget that final wave and salute as he left_office that August day -- walking away from something he had worked for all_of his life.... I never fully agreed with a lot of his political ideologies . But he certainly stood_by them , and anyone who has that sort of belief in his own convictions is a man who merits respect. &quot; -- Carol Neal , Orange ' We raised our family in Yorba Linda and lived there 28 years . In 1968 , when I had two small children , Richard Nixon was campaigning for the presidency and he came_to what was then an elementary_school on the site of his birthplace and talked to the crowd . I had my two children with me in a stroller and it was mostly women and children because it was during the workday . He got_out of his limo ( there were no Secret_Service I could see ) , climbed_up on the car and spoke_to the crowd . One of the things I remember him saying was that his father had raised lemons on that property , and it looked_like people today raised children. &quot; -- Mary Pat Anderson , Tustin &quot; President Richard M . Nixon ' s 1969 Inaugural Ball was to me indeed an affair to remember.... Although the delay in appearance of the official party was anticipated , the stuffiness of the crowd , together with repeated waltz renditions by Meyer Davis ' Society Orchestra , little by little permitted boredom to cause growing restlessness.... I requested the ' 12th Street Rag ' in_order to dance to a more suitable tempo , and I was doing a solo buck and wing , cane and all , across the uncrowded floor , when suddenly ' Hail to the Chief ' supplanted the ' 12th Street Rag ' and the Nixon and Eisenhower families made their grand entrance.... Much chagrined , I continued to the far end of the ballroom where a wall became my saving grace . Years later , I had occasion to discuss this with Nixon . His comment : ' So you ' re the SOB who screwed_up my entrance ! ' I found he was comfortable , considerate ... with a finely tuned sense of humor. &quot; -- Robert A . Foster , Balboa &quot; I grew_up in Whittier . Richard Nixon was a constant symbolic backdrop that I simply accepted as part of the package , with little thought about the man or his work . As I grew_up in the ' 60s , his symbolism changed , and I began resisting the war , politicians and all_the endless rhetoric that went_with it . Nixon represented a kind of passion about government and my peers dying that thankfully I have not felt since.... It wasn ' t until the years after Watergate that I began to admire Nixon as a person who not only could go_on , but go_on with dignity and determination. &quot; -- Mary Singleton , Orange &quot; My dad was the election commissioner at our neighborhood polling_place in Beverly Hills , and that is where Mr. Nixon voted . Mr. Nixon was running_for governor at the time , and my dad was a strong supporter of his.... Nixon came_to the polling_place to cast his ballot , and he came without fanfare and at a very quiet time . There were no other people casting their ballots . He walked in and shook all_of the workers ' hands , and as he started to leave , my dad started to talk to him . He spent some time playing the piano for the workers at the poll.... I was fortunate later to be able to vote for him. &quot; -- J . Michael Lanni , Newport Beach &quot; It was 1977 , the last_day of taping of the Nixon-Frost interviews . Our 19-year-old son had a snow-skiing accident a year before , leaving him a paraplegic . He had a friend who lived across the street from where they were doing the interviewing . We decided to go there to try to catch_a_glimpse of President Nixon after the taping session.... As he exited the house and was standing in the doorway speaking_to someone , he spotted our son in his wheelchair . He immediately came_out to the street to shake hands with him and gave him a five-minute pep talk . ' What happened ? Football accident ? Remember FDR ? You know he was in a wheelchair. ' He then called David Frost_over -- ' Listen to this young_man -- he has a great voice -- you should get him on television. ' And he left shaking his finger at him , encouraging him to keep_up his spirits.... What we didn ' t know , until we watched the series on television , was that was the day David Frost had come_down so very hard on Nixon . Just another example of President Nixon ' s courage and resiliency . He will be greatly missed. &quot; -- Bill and Larrie Parks , Dana Point &quot; As I followed his 1960 campaign , I began to feel as if I personally knew him and his family . The feeling has stayed with me throughout my career as a teacher.... It is our response to failure that matters , not the failure.... We can teach our children that you can ' t experience true success until you have faced great obstacles and challenges , often the greatest obstacle being ourselves . You made a great difference in my life , Richard , and I , in turn , have made a difference in the lives of others as I followed your journey and applied it to my life. &quot; -- Gloria Alkire , Newport Beach &quot; It was 1966 or 1967 when I took my young daughters , Pamela and Leslie , to see Mr. Nixon when he made an appearance at his birthplace in Yorba Linda . We arrived early and stood just behind the red velvet rope that was stretched across the grounds.... As he stepped from his car and walked toward us , the excitement mounted and the crowd surged forward . Leslie , who was 2 or 3 at the time , was pushed ahead of me and knocked_down , her glasses fell_off and I was pushed backward -- unable to get ahold of her . Mr. Nixon reached her first and scooped her up , saving her from being stepped on.... Mr. Nixon tried to hand me Leslie as the crowd tried to keep us apart . I will never forget the look_on his face , no words were necessary. &quot; -- Shirley L . Hurt , Anaheim Hills</TEXT>
