   <HEADLINE> RESOLVE THE KOREAN CRISIS ON OUR TERMS ; NUCLEAR WEAPONS : U.S. MUST USE A STICK AS WELL AS A CARROT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If history teaches us anything about influencing dictators , it is that the efficacy of incentives depends_on the simultaneous employment of disincentives . To get a mule to move , you must show it the carrot and hit it with a stick at_the_same_time . In its opposition to North_Korea ' s nuclear ambitions , the Clinton_Administration ' s approach has been the mirror opposite of North_Korea ' s . Our diplomacy employs only carrots ; theirs , only sticks . Whenever the Clinton_Administration ' s carrots have failed to prevent North_Korea ' s violations of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , it has limited its choice of sticks_to the withdrawal of the carrot . For instance , the Administration responded to North_Korea ' s defueling of its nuclear_reactor by canceling the offer of a third round of high-level talks . ( The call_for sanctions was limited to symbolic ones and dropped once Jimmy_Carter succumbed to the charms of Kim Il Sung. ) Using sticks such_as their threatened expulsion of IAEA inspectors , North_Korea has consistently intimidated Administration diplomacy . To divert the United States from punishing his violations of the NPT , Kim Il Sung has raised , then withdrawn his stick , masking his forbearance in the disguise of a carrot . Thanks to Carter ' s performance as an innocent abroad in North_Korea , the Administration is obliged to examine Kim ' s latest offer . The practical effect of the former President ' s public embrace of the &quot; Great Leader &quot; is that Administration efforts to secure even symbolic sanctions would fail at the present_time . I understand why President Clinton might have made a virtue of necessity by announcing that North_Korea ' s offer was tempting enough to explore in a third round of talks . But I had hoped that North_Korea ' s long record of broken promises would have restrained Administration exuberance in making the announcement . Forgotten was the reason we canceled our initial offer for talks and sought U.N. sanctions : North_Korea ' s past diversion and reprocessing of nuclear fuel into enough weapons-grade plutonium for two nuclear bombs . The President greeted North_Korea ' s promise to freeze its nuclear_weapons program and refrain_from expelling IAEA inspectors as if Pyongyang had offered a concession worth celebrating . In fact , North_Korea has offered no real concession . The fuel rods that it would use to make weapons-grade plutonium cannot be used until they are less radioactive . The reactor cannot be refueled until the rods have cooled . North_Korea ' s nuclear program is , of physical necessity , frozen . As the talks proceed , force enhancements in South_Korea that are necessary to diminish North_Korea ' s ability to destroy Seoul with artillery_fire will be held_in abeyance , leaving Seoul a hostage to Pyongyang ' s future belligerence . President Clinton now has a significant personal political stake in preventing the perception that the talks have failed . The Carter initiative is now the Clinton initiative . This political reality may cause him to suffer North_Korean dilatory negotiating tactics even after it is apparent that Pyongyang is only stalling until it can develop four to six more nuclear_weapons . Although the Administration may attempt to obscure a failure , we will reach a moment when it is apparent to all . That will be when North_Korea begins reprocessing the fuel now in cooling ponds into weapons-grade plutonium . Then our only means to deprive North_Korea of additional nuclear_weapons would be to destroy the reprocessing plant with air strikes . But the President will not order the strikes because he has neglected to reinforce our defenses sufficiently to spare Seoul from destruction by North_Korean artillery . We will have to learn to live with North_Korea ' s possession of as_many as eight nuclear_weapons . There may yet be a way to prevent this nightmare scenario from becoming reality . It would require the President to employ simultaneously the carrot and the stick . We should open the Geneva discussions by informing the North_Koreans that while we welcome their latest offer , we are not relying_on just their good_faith . Accordingly , we will take the precaution of deploying additional counterbattery artillery to our defenses north of Seoul . Should the North_Koreans then suddenly commence the reprocessing of the fuel now in cooling ponds , the President ' s decision to exercise a military option will not be hindered by his concern over their current artillery advantage . If we reject such an approach , the North_Koreans may delay a resolution of this crisis until it is too late . North_Korea will then have the means to achieve the only strategic objective we have ever been certain it wants : the reunification of Korea under Kim Il Sung . To those who dismiss this grim prediction , I offer one historical anecdote . In the spring of 1950 , Kim Il Sung proposed that he and the South_Korean president hold summit talks that August , just as he has proposed to meet with the South_Korean president later this month . In June , 1950 , the North invaded South_Korea , and the United States was dragged into a bloody war for which we were not prepared . If the President wants to avoid a recurrence of the tragedy , he must show much more resolve in his dealings with Kim Il Sung .</TEXT>
