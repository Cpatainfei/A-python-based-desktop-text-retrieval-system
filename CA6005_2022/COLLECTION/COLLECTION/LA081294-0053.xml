   <HEADLINE> SAFETY TOOLS IGNORED AT FATAL GAS LEAK SITE ; ACCIDENT : WORKERS SAW NO THREAT OF DEADLY FUMES , OFFICIALS SAY . THREE DIED AND FOUR WERE INJURED AT WELL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Workers for Vintage Petroleum ignored nearby safety equipment that could have saved their lives , because they saw no threat of deadly fumes in the long-dormant well they were reactivating , company officials said Thursday . Previous checks of the well showed no traces of hydrogen_sulfide , the colorless toxic gas that killed three workers and injured four others in an industrial accident at a Rincon oil lease 10 miles north of Ventura two days ago . &quot; No one involved in this operation thought it necessary , &quot; said Robert W . Cox , vice_president of Vintage Petroleum . &quot; No ( hydrogen_sulfide ) gas was expected to be encountered. &quot; All seven dead and injured oil field workers were exposed to a small concentration of hydrogen_sulfide , a common toxic gas that exists in pockets of underground crude_oil , rescue officials said . The crew_members failed to use three common safety tools that could have limited the disaster , oil_company officials said . The workers were not using breathing devices , continuous monitors to alert them to the gas or harnesses that would have allowed a quicker escape_from the cellar in which they were overcome . &quot; If these employees had been wearing breathing apparatuses , it is possible they would not have been killed , &quot; Cox said . &quot; But you can ' t take that conclusion and work back and say there were obvious mistakes made. &quot; Some of the workers also apparently violated company safety rules by attempting to rescue their colleagues , Cox said . Guidelines call_for employees to retreat immediately from poisonous gas and summon help . &quot; It ' s human nature to want to go_to the aid of a co-worker , &quot; Cox said . Killed Wednesday were three young oil field workers -- Ronald Johnson and Jason Hoskins of Ventura and Sean David Harris of Oxnard . The condition of the four injured workers improved Thursday , with Jeff Sandoval and Toby Thrower being released from the hospital . Derek Abbott and Jerry Walker remained in Los Robles Hospital in fair condition . Operations have been suspended at the oil_well where the workers died . But Cox said business is going_on around the clock at the firm ' s other sites nearby . No additional safety measures have been implemented since Wednesday ' s tragedy , he said . A regional manager of Pride Petroleum , which had contracted with Vintage to help convert the oil_well to a water-injection line , said his workers used a hand-held detector to check for hydrogen_sulfide hours before the accident . But manager Michael Furrow said it was not turned_on when the gas leaked . Furrow , who said he spent most of Thursday with family members of those who died , said the gases came without warning despite the crew ' s safety efforts . &quot; At the time they were sniffing , there was not anything flowing into the cellar , &quot; Furrow said . &quot; Whatever the gas was that killed our employees was not present when the monitor was on. &quot; Executives at both Vintage and Pride Petroleum said Thursday that it would be premature to conclude that it was hydrogen_sulfide that killed the men . But they offered no other explanation . Furrow said he could not explain why his workers failed to hook themselves into full-body harnesses that colleagues can use to pull them to safety in emergencies . &quot; It ' s standard Pride policy and it ' s Cal-OSHA policy , &quot; Furrow said . &quot; Before the first man went_in , he should have had a full-body harness on , and there should have been someone there at_the_ready to pull him out. &quot; Investigators with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health Administration , or Cal-OSHA , declined to discuss any findings of their investigation . Specifically , inspectors would not comment on the workers ' failure to use respirators , monitors or harnesses . But one official said Thursday that safety laws are subject_to varied interpretation . &quot; There ' s no requirement that every employee always wear a respirator , &quot; said Gene Glendenning , a Cal-OSHA safety expert based in Fresno . &quot; You ' re only required to wear a respirator when there ' s an exposure or potential exposure , &quot; he said . &quot; What we require is appropriate monitoring for the hazardous material involved. &quot; John Duncan , another Cal-OSHA regulator , said the oil_company seemed to be taking a strong defensive stand_in declaring that no toxic gas detectors or respirators were needed . &quot; It ' s too early to make such a definitive judgment as_to whether the proper safety procedures were followed , &quot; Duncan said . &quot; This is one of the main issues we will be investigating. &quot; Duncan chastised Cox for continuing to pump oil at other sites without instituting extra safety precautions , such_as more use of respirators and monitoring sensors , even if they are not required by law . State inspectors have descended upon Vintage ' s Rincon field to review the company ' s safety record and find_out if it adequately protected workers from toxic fumes as a matter of routine . Pride Petroleum is also being investigated for potential violations of state safety laws . The contracting firm already had a questionable safety record , suffering two fatal_accidents and at least 10 other work-related injuries that resulted in hospital stays since 1990 , Cal-OSHA records show . The company also has several citations and fines totaling more_than $ 10 # 000 over the last four years . &quot; It ' s clearly not a good record , &quot; Duncan said . &quot; They ' ve had a history of some problems and it should be a source of concern . They clearly should do better. &quot; But Furrow defended his Texas-based firm ' s safety record , saying it spends about $ 4 million a year on training . The Pride Petroleum incident rate is just under seven per 200 # 000 man-hours of work in the last 12 months , a rate Furrow said was_well within industry standards . There is some record of hydrogen_sulfide in the vicinity of the Rincon well , according to maps kept by the State Division of Oil and Gas . But the most recent public map is 18 years old and compiled strictly from information provided by oil_industry sources themselves , said Pamela Morris of the Division of Oil and Gas , which regulates lease operations in California . According to the 1976 map , the concentration of hydrogen_sulfide is about 100 parts per million in the areas around the Rincon lease . By comparison , known hydrogen_sulfide deposits in some oil fields in Santa Barbara County top 270 # 000 parts per million , a ratio that makes drilling in that area far more dangerous , Morris said . Experts say the concentration of hydrogen_sulfide must reach 700 or more parts per million to be fatal . State investigators said Vintage Petroleum executives could be found liable for civil and criminal violations of health and safety codes designed to protect oil workers from hydrogen_sulfide and other industry hazards . &quot; Cal-OSHA requires emergency action plans and the use of appropriate equipment and proper training before an accident , so workers are not jeopardized , &quot; said Glendenning , the Fresno-based Cal-OSHA safety expert . Oil_companies &quot; are required to test when they ' re in an area that has the potential for hydrogen_sulfide , &quot; he said . But Glendenning and officials at the accident scene Thursday were not ready to discuss their preliminary findings . On Thursday morning , survivors hung a white wooden cross to the front gate of the Vintage facility at Rincon for one of the victims . &quot; For our dear friend Randy Johnson , &quot; it read , in black handwritten letters . &quot; Your family and friends will truly miss you forever . Love from us all. &quot; RELATED STORY : B1</TEXT>
