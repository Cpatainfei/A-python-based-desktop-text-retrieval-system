   <TEXT> Before he quits international hockey , Sweden ' s Mats Naslund has one goal left : winning an Olympic gold medal and becoming one of the few players ever to play_on Stanley Cup and Olympic championship teams . Naslund , 34 , played eight seasons with the Montreal Canadiens , then returned to Sweden after the 1989-90 season.These Games are his third . He played_on Sweden ' s bronze-medal team at Lake Placid in 1980 and on the one that finished fifth at Albertville two years ago . &quot; It would be important to be one of the few guys in the world to do that , but the main thing is to be here and just play in another Olympics , &quot; Naslund said . &quot; It ' s a great experience and you get a nice atmosphere . ( Sweden ) won a gold today from ( skier ) Pernilla Wiberg , and that was nice . But I ' m too old to play_on this level anymore . It takes too much. &quot; Over the years , Naslund has seen international hockey influenced by the NHL , and vice versa . Given the choice , he ' d watch an NHL game . &quot; It ' s faster in the NHL , but with my age , it ' s easier to play here because there ' s less hitting , &quot; he said . &quot; The NHL is probably more European than it was 10 years ago and over here , guys are hitting more , so it ' s a little bit tougher. &quot; * Canadian goalie Corey Hirsch has been surprised by the U.S. team ' s struggles here . &quot; I think they ' re feeling the heat , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s a lot of pressure put_on them to be the 1980 miracle team . that ' s the thing about our team -- nobody expected anything from us and didn ' t respect us , and now they have to respect us for what we ' ve done. &quot; HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
