   <HEADLINE> TAKING THE KIDS : UNFAMILIAR FOOD FOR THOUGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forget peanut_butter . There wasn ' t even any pizza . For a week in China , seventh-grader Michael Sandner filled_up on sauteed sea_slugs , pig snout , jellyfish , chicken feet and web of Peking Duck . &quot; Chinese food wasn ' t anything like at_home , &quot; reported the 14-year-old , who was greatly relieved to see plenty of rice on every menu . &quot; Sea_slugs are kind of slimy , like cranberry_sauce , &quot; he explained . The chicken foot &quot; looked kind of gross . You could really tell it was a chicken foot . But it didn ' t really have any taste. &quot; Not_bad for a kid who lives_on bean burritos and oatmeal at_home in suburban Chicago . &quot; Of our seven kids , he ' s the pickiest eater , &quot; said his mother , Carole , who said she was astonished by her son ' s eating habits on a trip through Hong Kong , Beijing , Shanghai and other parts of China . &quot; I was pretty amazed myself , &quot; said Michael , who accompanied his father Jack , chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , on a business trip to Asia last fall . &quot; But I got interested . The Chinese eat those things all_of the time and I wanted to try them. &quot; * that ' s the idea , of course . Food is a natural way to help kids bridge the cultural gap wherever they ' re traveling . The dinner_table can spark a child ' s interest in a new place and the people who live there with more immediacy than many dusty historical sites . So instead of always sticking_to the familiar , head for a barbecue pit in Texas , a lobster shack in Maine , a Mexican cantina in Albuquerque or a tea house serving dim sum dumplings in San Francisco ' s Chinatown . Often such places are cheaper than fast food . They ' re also a lot more fun -- especially for parents . In a foreign country , let the kids shop in local markets for picnic fixings . &quot; They ' d pick things that looked interesting , &quot; said Susan Weintraub , a school librarian from Maryland who has spent time in England and France with her husband and three children . As much as the food , the Weintraub kids were intrigued by the way things were packaged and displayed . &quot; Food is really symbolic of how you encourage kids to take life in and open yourself to new experiences , &quot; said educator Lucinda Lee Katz , director of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools , who has traveled widely with her two teen-agers . &quot; It gives them the message that taking a risk isn ' t a bad thing. &quot; This is not to say you can force kids to eat a particular dish , or should . &quot; Just ask them to try it , &quot; said Katz , who has eaten plenty of meals with her teen-age son in which he filled_up on rice . ' You ' ll stress yourself out if you ' re constantly trying to get them to eat new things , &quot; Weintraub said . &quot; Everything is so different when you ' re traveling ; the kids want familiar things to eat , too. &quot; * Laura Sutherland , co-author or &quot; Innocents Abroad : Traveling With Kids in Europe &quot; ( Penguin , $ 15.95 ) suggests ordering familiar fare that the kids are certain to eat , in addition to unusual dishes for everyone to try : french fries or an omelet in France , pasta in Italy , plain tortillas with cheese in a Mexican restaurant or fried_rice in a Chinese meal . Of utmost importance , never turn food into a battleground . &quot; Remember that kids don ' t think_of food the same way adults do , &quot; said Chicago child psychologist Sharon Berry , who practices at Northwestern University-affiliated Children ' s Memorial Hospital . &quot; Food isn ' t a focus_on vacation the way it might be for parents . They ' re only interested when they ' re hungry. &quot; &quot; You might think a big plate of weird food is exciting but it might scare little kids , &quot; agreed Altadena mom Sally Geisse , who travels_to Barcelona with her children every year to visit her husband ' s family . She recommends looking_for foods that are similar to at-home favorites . Especially if a preschooler or picky eater is along , Berry advises making_sure there ' s access to some &quot; regular &quot; food the child likes , even if it ' s necessary to bring it along from home . Then put forth the idea of trying some new dishes as an adventure . &quot; The idea is that this is fun , &quot; said Berry . &quot; Make_it a game . Give points for whomever tries the most new foods. &quot; Talking_about the &quot; food adventure &quot; ahead of time helps , too . Get some books from the library about the places you ' ll be visiting . Try some of the dishes at_home , if possible . Laura Sutherland said she knows families who stage special theme dinners at_home as a way of introducing the kids to a new place . A little preparation clearly pays_off . San Francisco Chinatown guide Shirley Fong-Torres has shepherded many school groups and visiting families on her Wok Wiz tours , which end with a dim sum lunch . The kids who have_the_best time , she ' s convinced , are those who have been prepped for the new experience by their teachers or parents . &quot; Make_sure they ' re comfortable with what they ' re eating , &quot; Fong-Torres advised . &quot; And make_it exciting. &quot; But even the best efforts don ' t always work . There we were , seated around a big circular table in a bustling San Francisco Chinese restaurant . My children Matt and Reggie love Chinese food and couldn ' t wait for lunch to be served . Neither could the other two kids at the table . But when the odd-shaped dim sum dumplings arrived , the four kids barely picked_at them . They simply didn ' t like them -- the taste , the consistency or even the shape . &quot; Next time we come_to Chinatown for lunch , bring some peanut_butter sandwiches , &quot; 8-year-old Reggie suggested . Taking the Kids appears weekly .</TEXT>
