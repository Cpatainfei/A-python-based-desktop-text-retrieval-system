   <HEADLINE> HOMICIDES IN THE COUNTY DROP SHARPLY IN ' 94 ; CRIME : TWENTY-EIGHT RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN SLAIN THIS YEAR , DOWN FROM 47 IN 1993 . BUT POLICE REPORT MORE ' STRANGER ' SLAYINGS , REFLECTING A NATIONWIDE RISE IN GANG ACTIVITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As usual , neighbor killed neighbor , rival shot rival and man murdered wife in Ventura County in 1994 . But far more victims are dying at the hands of strangers , law_enforcement officials said . A total of 28 county residents have been slain so far this year , a dramatic drop from the 47 homicides in 1993 , which authorities said was an unusually violent year . But it was not far from 1992 ' s total of 32 homicides , and officials called the drop-off just part of the roller-coaster pattern that homicide statistics tend to follow . &quot; People just didn ' t go_out and kill as_many people . It goes like that , &quot; said Coroner ' s Investigator Mitch Breese . &quot; There ' s no set anything for homicides . They can be up for a while , they can be down for a while . . . . There ' s no rhyme or reason for it. &quot; Over the years , the reasons for killing have become more haphazard , said Senior Deputy Dist . Atty . Richard E . Holmes . &quot; The motives often seem to be more trivial , &quot; said Holmes , a veteran prosecutor who oversees the district_attorney ' s major crimes unit . &quot; There are more ' stranger homicides ' than in the past , where the victim and the defendant are unknown to each other , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s random violence , as opposed to , ' This had been building_up and I couldn ' t stand it any more. ' &quot; The FBI report on 1993 crimes noted a sharp increase in random killings by strangers nationwide , partly due_to an increase in gang crime . &quot; Every American now has a realistic chance of murder victimization in_view of the random nature the crime has assumed , &quot; the report said . A respected Oxnard soccer coach died in just such a &quot; stranger &quot; shooting last summer , and police are still searching for the gang member who they suspect killed him . Armando Balderama , 20 , apparently grew upset that Roberto Leyva was looking_at his sister while they dined at Topper ' s Pizza Place in south Oxnard on July 10 , police said . The two exchanged words inside the restaurant , and police say Balderama shot Leyva moments later in the parking_lot . A bullet pierced a major artery in Leyva ' s stomach , and Leyva , a father of two , died 10 hours later . Leyva ' s death fits another pattern : Ventura County killers are using handguns more often than they used to , reflecting the rise in handgun ownership in the United States , Holmes said . * Of the 28 homicides in 1994 , 19 of the victims died in gunfire . That 70 % proportion of the death toll tops the nationwide tally of 60 % of homicide victims who are killed with bullets nationwide , according to a 1988 U.S. Department_of_Justice study . Nearly all_of the Ventura County gun deaths involved handguns . One of the year ' s most tragic slayings occurred in Thousand Oaks on July 13 , when a 17-year-old boy playing with his father ' s 9-millimeter , semiautomatic_pistol shot his 16-year-old girlfriend in the eye . Jacqueline Reay died in the incident . The boy , convicted as a juvenile , was sentenced to 10 1 / 2 years incarceration with the California Youth Authority . Authorities say he probably will serve time only until age 21 . In a case that diverges from the trend , another young victim died after being stabbed with a classmate ' s knife at a Simi Valley junior_high_school . Valley View Junior_High students Phillip Hernandez and Chad Hubbard had quarreled in the past , but the rivalry went_over the edge Feb . 1 , when Phillip stabbed Chad to death in front of dozens of classmates as school let_out . Phillip , convicted of involuntary manslaughter , was sentenced to four years in the California Youth Authority . Not all_the killings of 1994 were so clear-cut . Some cases were closed within minutes by reliable eyewitnesses who helped police and prosecutors win swift convictions . Some killers went_to prison , some got_away , and some are still awaiting their day in court . * Other slayings remain mysteries . And while one was a police shooting , most were crimes of anger , drunkenness , or as one veteran investigator put it , &quot; irrational acts of stupidity. &quot; Here are the other Ventura County homicides of 1994 : * Roberto Ponce , 29 , had beaten his girlfriend one too many times , Oxnard police said . When her 15-year-old son caught him lying on top of her Jan . 8 and preparing to strike her again , the youth picked_up an ax handle and bludgeoned Ponce to death , police said . The district_attorney decided not to file charges , ruling that the killing was justified . * Thomas Shoop , 36 , of Ventura died at_home Feb . 20 after being violently kicked_in the abdomen during a street robbery by Everado Mondragon , 35 , and Jose Sanchez , 24 . A judge ruled there was insufficient evidence to charge the two with homicide , but police and prosecutors say they believe the beating ruptured Shoop ' s spleen and killed him . * On March 5 , the day after his truck was found abandoned in West Hollywood , Andy Lee Anderson , 24 , and his dog were found shot to death at a remote Rose Valley campground . Timothy Chrestman , 19 , of Port Hueneme faces a Jan . 3 trial for murder , robbery and auto theft charges that could put him in prison for life , prosecutors said . * Police are still trying to learn who shot 21-year-old Eric Velasquez in the torso . He was killed March 7 in the parking_lot of a Santa Paula apartment_building after smashing some car_windows . But there is no evidence tying the car to any suspects , police said . * On March 26 , members of Oxnard ' s Surtown and Loma Flats gangs squared_off in a Port Hueneme park , aimed handguns at each other and fired . Cesar Mata , 16 , died , shot once in the chest . Prosecutors said they have declined to file charges because witnesses ' conflicting stories left them without enough evidence to prove the case . * A short , unhappy marriage left Mina and Jose Castaneda of Santa Paula on the edge of divorce , but they reconciled the day before she was to file the papers . Two days later , on April 2 , Jose Castaneda , 26 , left a birthday_party and robbed a motel with a friend , prosecutors said . When he returned , he found his 25-year-old wife holding a baseball_bat , angry because he had left the party . He shot her in the head during the ensuing argument , prosecutors said . Castaneda was sentenced to 45 years to life in prison for murder under the state ' s &quot; three-strikes &quot; law , invoked because he had two prior robbery_convictions . He also received another 30 years for firearm-related charges . * David Rubio , 19 , borrowed a car from Donald Culbertson ' s sister in Oxnard on April 10 , but returned it late . That led to an argument , and Culbertson , 24 , stabbed Rubio to death in an alley . Culbertson pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 19 years in prison for that and two assaults , a prosecutor said . * Chased by police cruisers on April 25 , Alfonso Bravo , 20 , ditched the stolen Mustang he was driving and ran . Oxnard Police_Officer Patrick Dolan , 29 , chased Bravo over several fences . When he topped one wooden fence to find Bravo pointing a loaded 9-millimeter gun at him , Dolan dropped_behind the fence and fired four shots through it , killing Bravo . The district_attorney ' s office ruled the shooting was justified . * Ventura janitor John Edward Rios Jr . braked his family company ' s van to a stop at a Ventura intersection April 26 . A co-worker riding with him said that a dark-clad man in a ski_mask walked in front of the van , drew_close to the driver ' s side , pulled_out a handgun and shot Rios through the window . Rios died three days later , and police are still frustrated by the lack of solid leads , Ventura Police Lt . Brad Talbot said . * After refusing to turn_down the volume of music at his house May 8 , Ventura landscaper Juan Vargas , 31 , was shot to death by a drunk , angry neighbor at the Victorian Trailer_Park , police said . The suspect , Raul Cervantes Viveros , 46 , is at_large , and police say they have been talking with the Mexican consulate in case he left this country . * May 8 , several weeks after Gary Michael Rose , 24 , moved_into the Oxnard home of his former fiancee , Victoria Ramey , 31 , he shot her to death . Rose surrendered to police and pleaded not_guilty by reason of insanity , but he was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison . * On May 12 , Braulio Bojorquez , 25 , a small-time El Rio dope dealer , was found trussed up with electrical cord and stabbed repeatedly in the head and back , authorities said . Ventura County sheriff ' s detectives said they suspect he crossed someone in the violent , statewide Sinaloa Cowboys gang , but they have found no suspects . * Navy plumber Thomas Shipley , 43 , shot his wife , Linda , 40 , in the chest May 13 at their Oxnard home , then shot himself . A relative said the two &quot; looked so_much in_love , &quot; but others told of Shipley ' s bad_temper and his habit of yelling at neighbors . * Moises Galaviz , 41 , stalked away from a drunken family argument near Santa Paula on May 30 , returned with a gun and opened_fire on his two brothers . Aurelio Galaviz was wounded , and Jose Galaviz , 35 , died of a gunshot wound to his upper back . Judged mentally incompetent to stand trial , Moises Galaviz was sent to Patton State Psychiatric Hospital until he is able to face charges of murder and attempted murder , a prosecutor said . * Standing_in a friend ' s kitchen in south Oxnard , someone fired through the window , shooting Ricardo Gonzales in the heart June 10 . &quot; There were absolutely no witnesses , nothing , &quot; says Oxnard Police Detective Mike Palmieri . * Rodney McClain was found slumped in an alley June 25 , a single gunshot wound in his side . The Oxnard postal worker , 40 , died en route to the hospital . Police say they have witnesses and are still working to find a suspect . * Thomas Corral stormed into his ex-girlfriend ' s Ventura apartment on July 21 and shot drifter Roger Rowland , 23 , in the stomach once because he believed the two were dating , prosecutors have said . Corral faces a trial on murder_charges Jan . 9 while a friend who accompanied him there , Ruben Viveros , 19 , is serving prison time after pleading guilty to being an accessory to the killing . * When Jesus Arredondo , 32 , sent his friend out for beer Aug . 5 , he asked_for Budweiser .

Larry Robertson , head of the sheriff ' s Major Crimes Unit . * Zolly Terry , 21 , of Oxnard , faces a murder trial on Feb . 6 .
