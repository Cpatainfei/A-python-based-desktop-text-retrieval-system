   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / JERRY CROWE ; SHE ' S CONSIDERING COURTS AGAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On her 18th birthday recently , Jennifer Capriati accepted an invitation to be an alternate on the U.S. team that will play in the Federation Cup on July 18-24 at Frankfurt , Germany . &quot; She indicated that , after high_school , she ' s really going_to start thinking_about tennis again , &quot; U.S. Captain Marty Riessen said . Capriati , who hasn ' t played since August , said in January that she was taking a break while rekindling an interest in the sport . She indicated , however , that she probably would return after graduating from Pascual County High in Saddlebrook , Fla. , on June 9 . Wimbledon starts 11 days later . Capriati , who has earned almost $ 1.5 million on the WTA Tour and won a gold medal in the 1992 Olympic Games , has moved_back with her family after living_on her own in a nearby apartment for several months . &quot; I know she ' s been out hitting the ball and working_out a little bit , getting_back slowly , at her own pace , &quot; her mother , Denise , said from Wesley Chapel , Fla . &quot; Obviously , she wants to play again . It ' s just a matter of getting school over and done with , then totally focusing_on whatever she wants to do . &quot; She ' s doing_it the smart way , just kind of enjoying the rest of her senior year and hanging out. &quot; Riessen said Capriati was receptive to the idea of being an alternate on a team that will include Mary Joe Fernandez , Zina Garrison Jackson , Gigi Fernandez and another high_school senior , Lindsay Davenport , 17 , of Murrieta Valley . Capriati , who helped the U.S. team win the Federation Cup in 1990 , will be called_upon only if one of the others is injured . &quot; Right now , we couldn ' t pick Jennifer for the team because she ' s not playing , &quot; Riessen said . * Mixed reviews : Riessen welcomes the transformation of the Federation Cup , which next year will drop its one-week , one-site-a-year format to adopt a schedule similar to the Davis Cup ' s . This year ' s eight quarterfinalists will make_up next year ' s World Group , with the non-qualifiers relegated to zonal competition . Ties consisting_of four singles matches , followed by a doubles match , will be played over two days at sites chosen by the host nations . The quarterfinals will be played in April , semifinals in July and the finalin November . &quot; I think it ' s the one chance for the event to grow_into being a serious event , &quot; Riessen said . &quot; Right now , it ' s a nice event , but it doesn ' t get that much coverage and notice in the total calendar . I think it needs a jump-start. &quot; Gigi Fernandez , the world ' s No . 1 doubles player , wasn ' t happy about the placement of the doubles match , believing that it should be played before the last two singles matches . Most matches , she said , will be decided before the doubles match is played . &quot; I ' m really upset about it , &quot; she said . &quot; If doubles is going_to be dead , why do I want to schlep all around the world to cheer ? &quot; * Passage from India : Tom Gullickson , in his first year as captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team , was prepared_for the worst before he made his debut against India last month at New Delhi . Despite his fears , the U.S. team of Jim Courier , Todd Martin , Patrick McEnroe and Richey Reneberg was a 5-0 winner . And nobody got sick . &quot; We took our own chef and we took a lot of_our_own food and all_of our own water , &quot; Gullickson said . &quot; And we even had the guys brush their teeth with Evian water , so they didn ' t use any water from the hotel tap system . &quot; Actually , I thought everything went quite well . Everybody stayed healthy , and when we got_down there , all_the boys worked pretty hard . There was a real good team_spirit and a real camaraderie between the players. &quot; Gullickson said Courier and Pete Sampras have expressed interest in_playing against the_Netherlands in a quarterfinal match July 15-17 at Rotterdam , &quot; but I haven ' t talked to anybody specifically about playing. &quot; * Let ' s play five : The WTA Tour is not expected to oppose the decision by the Australian Open_to change the format of its women ' s final from a best-of-three to a best-of-five-sets event . &quot; I think it will help showcase women ' s tennis a bit , &quot; said Gerard Smith , the tour ' s executive_director . &quot; I ' ve spoken_to several of the top players and there doesn ' t seem to be any objection to it . I think the players are capable of staging a very exciting five-set final. &quot; The season-ending Virginia Slims Championships has been the only event with a best-of-five women ' s final . It has gone_to five sets once , Monica Seles overcoming a 2-1 deficit to defeat Gabriela Sabatini in 1990 . Tennis Notes The Dutch are expected to announce Monday that they will build a temporary 12 # 500-capacity outdoor stadium on the waterfront in Rotterdam for their quarterfinal Davis Cup match against the United States . The Dutch team on the hard court is expected to include Richard Krajicek , who returned to the ATP Tour last week after being sidelined four months because of a knee injury , and the world ' s No . 1-ranked doubles team , Paul Haarhuis and Jacco Eltingh . Haarhuis , ranked 22nd , is also expected to play singles . . . . Krajicek , ranked 24th , said of his time away from the tour : &quot; The first week , it was a holiday . Then I got bored. &quot; Zina Garrison Jackson , a late addition last season , will again play for the Newport Beach Dukes during the World TeamTennis season , which runs July 6-Aug . 7 . Also playing for Coach Angel Lopez : Kelly Jones , Trevor Kronemann and Larisa Neiland . . . . Hana Mandlikova , winner of four Grand_Slam singles titles , and Bud Collins , a Boston Globe columnist and NBC broadcaster , were selected as inductees into the International Tennis Hall_of_Fame at Newport , R.I. . . . Until last month , when she was upset by Bettina Fulco-Villella at Houston and Ines Gorrochategui at Hilton Head Island , S.C. , Martina Navratilova hadn ' t lost in the first round of consecutive tournaments since 1974 .</TEXT>
