   <HEADLINE> ' 3 STRIKES ' LAW GOES INTO EFFECT ; CRIME : GOVERNOR SIGNS LEGISLATION THAT AIMS TO PUT HABITUAL FELONS BEHIND BARS FOR LIFE . HE CALLS IT ONLY A FIRST_STEP TOWARD TOUGHER MEASURES AGAINST VIOLENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Brushing aside criticisms of its cost and potential flaws , Gov . Pete Wilson on Monday signed what he called the toughest and most sweeping criminal sentencing law in the state ' s history , the &quot; three strikes &quot; bill that is aimed at putting habitual felons behind bars for life . Wilson , in a ceremony outside the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s Hollywood Division , said the bill should send a message to the worst of California ' s criminals : &quot; You ' d better start finding a new_line of work because we ' re going to start turning career criminals into career inmates. &quot; But the Republican governor , seeking to build_upon the momentum created by public outrage over crime , said the &quot; three strikes &quot; measure is only the first_step in what could be a comprehensive program to toughen the state ' s crime laws . He urged lawmakers to do more . Moments after Wilson signed the bill , the man credited with spearheading its passage began submitting the last of an estimated 800 # 000 signatures that are expected to place a nearly identical proposal on the state ballot in November . Mike Reynolds , a Fresno photographer whose daughter was killed by a repeat felon in 1992 , said he is following_through with his &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; initiative because he does not want the Legislature to tamper with the law Wilson signed . &quot; They are in a position to unravel everything that ' s been done here , &quot; Reynolds said . But the law was greeted warmly by Orange County lawmakers , who supported the measure during its circuitous trek through the Legislature . &quot; It represents a major improvement of existing law , &quot; said Assemblyman Ross Johnson ( R-Fullerton ) , who carried a bill similar to the &quot; three strikes &quot; measure signed by Wilson . &quot; We can do more , and we ought to do more. &quot; The new law requires a sentence of 25 years to life for any felon who has committed two prior violent or serious felonies -- crimes that range from burglary and arson to rape and murder . Those convicted of a second violent or serious felony would receive a sentence twice as long as what is now on the books . The law also limits plea_bargaining and requires that convicts be permitted to reduce their sentences by no more_than 20 % with credits for working or attending school while in prison . Until now , inmates could cut their sentences in half with such credits . The bill ' s sponsors say it gives California the toughest sentencing law in the nation . The emergency measure took_effect at 2:45 p.m. Monday when it was received and recorded by the secretary_of_state ' s office after the bill was shuttled from Los Angeles to Sacramento by a top Wilson aide . By day ' s end , it was all but certain that the first of the repeat felons who will be sentenced under the law already was in custody . The Corrections Department reports that the new law will lead to a massive prison building boom -- 20 more penitentiaries by the end of the decade -- and eventually increase operating_costs by more_than $ 2 billion a year . The state spends about $ 3 billion annually to run 28 prisons that house about 120 # 000 inmates . Although the measure attracted anticipated criticism from criminal defense_lawyers and civil libertarians , it also was opposed by some prosecutors , including Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti . Speaking_for Garcetti , Assistant Dist . Atty . R . Dan Murphy said his office had reservations about the bill and would have preferred another , narrower measure proposed in the Legislature . &quot; It is now the law , &quot; he said . &quot; We fully intend to enforce it. &quot; Murphy said the major concern of the district_attorney ' s office is that the law would further clog an overcrowded court system . With passage of the law , Murphy said those charged with serious crimes will be far less likely to plead guilty because it would mean being that much closer to a life sentence . &quot; The consequences of pleading guilty are much greater , &quot; Murphy said . Wilson said similar fears have been voiced before the passage of other major crackdowns on crime , including the &quot; victims bill of rights &quot; in 1982 and the &quot; speedy trial &quot; initiative in 1990 , and have been unfounded . Wilson also said the measure ' s potential costs have been exaggerated because the estimates do not consider savings from a reduction in crime brought_about by locking_up repeat felons for longer terms . Those behind bars cannot commit more crimes , Wilson said , and others on the streets might be deterred by fear of the longer sentences . &quot; I ' m convinced that if we are sending clear messages to career criminals , we will begin to see them reform their conduct , &quot; Wilson said . Even if the costs are huge , Wilson said , he believes the price will be worth it . He compared the construction of new prisons to the building of the University of California and the State Water_Project , two endeavors from an earlier era that often are cited as examples of the vision of Wilson ' s predecessors . Like those projects , the new prisons will be financed with bonds , similar to a mortgage paid_off over 20 years . &quot; We ' re producing . . . capital improvements for future generations , and they rightly can be called_upon to help pay_for it , &quot; Wilson said . Orange County lawmakers echoed the governor , suggesting that the measure may prove far less costly than critics have predicted . &quot; I don ' t agree with all_the doom- and gloom-sayers about what this will cost this state , &quot; said Assemblyman Curt Pringle ( R-Garden Grove ) . &quot; It ' s proven that repeat offenders cost society much more_than it costs to incarcerate them . We will not have repeat trials ; we will not have to re-convict people who will be in prison all_the longer. &quot; Even if the law does prove costly , &quot; that is our obligation as lawmakers -- to protect the people , &quot; Pringle said , adding that he and other conservatives remain &quot; very eager to cut_down our bloated bureaucracy to pay_for this and other programs that are necessary. &quot; Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) voiced similar sentiments : &quot; We have plenty of money for the real purposes of government . It ' s a matter of prioritizing where that money goes. &quot; Meanwhile , Assemblywoman Doris Allen ( R-Cypress ) suggested that the true costs of the measure will only come_with time . &quot; We ' re not going_to be able to know until we actually have a little experience with it , &quot; Allen said . &quot; I ' m happy from the standpoint that it ' s a beginning . It begins discussion ; it begins thought . It ' s a recognition of a very serious problem. &quot; Assemblyman Tom Umberg ( D-Garden Grove ) , who pushed a similar &quot; three-strikes &quot; bill , said it is now contingent_on the Democrat-dominated Legislature and the Republican governor to work together to craft other laws to keep first-time offenders from becoming career criminals . &quot; I think this changes the face of criminal justice here in California , &quot; Umberg said . &quot; I don ' t think people will look_back and rue the day this was signed unless we completely neglect dealing with the overall problem of crime from a comprehensive view. &quot; Umberg said lawmakers have to consider options such_as boot camps , stricter probation programs , electronic_surveillance and halfway houses for nonviolent offenders . Without such measures , he said , &quot; the costs are going_to be quite , quite high. &quot; For Wilson , Monday was the climax of years spent advocating tougher criminal justice laws , which he championed as mayor of San Diego , as a U.S. senator and as a candidate for governor . Although his reelection campaign officially opens today , the bill signing ceremony had all_the trappings of a political event . Wilson signed the measure on a small table in the parking_lot at the Police_Department ' s Hollywood division , which he said was chosen because it had the city ' s highest rate of violent crime last year . He sat in front of a police_wagon , flanked by black-and-white squad_cars and ringed by uniformed officers . With Wilson were Reynolds and the bill ' s two legislative sponsors , Assemblymen Bill Jones , a Republican , and Jim Costa , a Democrat , both from Fresno . Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren also attended , with representatives from several crime victims groups and Rep . Michael Huffington , a Santa Barbara Republican who has helped pay_for the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative campaign and is a candidate for the U.S. Senate . Standing behind Wilson , and watching from a distance , was Don Novey , president of the state ' s prison_guards union , which will grow along with any increase in the inmate population . Wilson strategists have said the governor ' s campaign will focus_on crime as one of three main issues . The public in recent polls has placed the_matter at or near the top of the political agenda . The governor said he has no intention of letting_up on the Legislature simply because the &quot; three strikes &quot; bill is now law . Until the threat of Reynolds ' initiative became real after 12-year-old Polly Klaas was slain last year in Northern California , the &quot; three strikes &quot; bill was languishing in the Legislature , unable to move past its first committee . Reynolds , Wilson said , helped lawmakers see the light , &quot; or at least feel the heat. &quot; Now the governor is calling_for the passage of other bills that would put first-time rapists and child_molesters in prison for life without the possibility of parole , expand the death_penalty , make_it easier to try juveniles as adults , and further limit the use of credits to reduce sentences . &quot; This is the beginning , not the end , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; The Legislature must finish the job. &quot; Times staff writers Eric Bailey and J .
