   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; HARIS PASOVIC ; ENSURING CULTURE SURVIVES AMID THE HORRORS OF SARAJEVO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sarajevo ' s siege failed to strangle the resolve of producer and theatrical director Haris Pasovic . Like other Sarajevans who have refused to surrender to the pressure of daily mortar bombardments , Pasovic has doggedly insisted on using his work to express what many of his fellow countrymen feel . Pasovic capitalized on the siege to expand his horizons . In a nondescript office_building in the once cosmopolitan city ' s capital , the prematurely graying 32-year-old plots the outlines of his next production . Sitting in a chilly room decorated with film-festival posters , Pasovic describes his excitement in presenting theater to people starving for expression of their views and for the simple drama of live performance . He has taken productions to hospitals , refugee camps and other areas besieged by shelling , creating vibrancy in a city filled with destruction . Producing &quot; Waiting for Godot , &quot; under the direction of American author Susan Sontag , may be among his most noted credits , but Pasovic seems equally proud_of his work organizing a film festival last year . Defiant citizens appeared for the screenings of &quot; Dracula &quot; and other popular films in their best clothes , jewelry and makeup -- though the 20 # 000 people who attended the 10-day festival had to dodge bullets on one of Sarajevo ' s more notorious sniper-infested streets to make_it to the front_door . What puzzled Pasovic was not the audience ' s willingness to risk their lives to come . &quot; Many people , many journalists asked , ' Why the film festival during the war ? , ' &quot; he said . &quot; I asked , ' Why the war during the film festival ? ' &quot; * Question : Do you think the rest of the world has trouble understanding what you in Sarajevo are going_through ? Answer : Sure . Sure . Now I ' ve started to understand why it is so . Simply because this kind of experience goes beyond everything known . And it cannot be rationalized at the moment . Many people who have experienced Auschwitz or some very harsh wrong or the ( marketplace ) massacre , of course -- they can feel it . They can understand . When I read something about World_War_II right now , I read it completely differently than before the war . Before the war , it was a strange account , the facts , a generality . Now it ' s very specific . . . . We are angry when we say the world doesn ' t care about this place and so on . But we shouldn ' t be angry so_much , simply because there are things that are not understandable at all . When there was the earthquake -- the last one in California -- when I saw people lining_up for the water , with the containers , they were like my brothers . I understood what they felt at the time . . . . It was like a report from Sarajevo . Q : What does art mean in a time of great suffering ? Does_it have greater meaning than it would in a time of peace ? A : It ' s as if you asked me what food means in a time of suffering , or ( anything ) which is normal , human and life-producing . . . . The meaning of art in a time of suffering , a time of war , is much more intense . People are more focused . . . . You have to imagine that for more_than two years there was no electricity in town , so most people haven ' t watched TV , they didn ' t listen to the radio , they didn ' t listen to music . We were completely cut_off . . . . You find yourself in your apartment , waiting to be killed , because your neighbor has been killed . And , of course , for one week , for two weeks , it ' s a kind of temporary crisis , and you can bear it somehow . . . . But after one month , two months , it ' s completely insulating . I think it ' s even worse than a jail . . . . I ' ve never been in jail , but as far as I know , you are cut_off from the world . But most prisoners know they did something which was wrong and for that reason they are suffering the punishment . This time , first of all , you weren ' t in a prison . You were in your own apartment . Plus , you didn ' t do anything wrong . . . . What to do ? . . . . You find some kind of courage , and new pride . And then you see what is given to you -- excluding the war . And what was given to people was , in our case , theater , film , music , literature , architecture and visual arts . . . . For yourself , it was , maybe , your last exhibition , your last concert . And that gave a specific intensity . You played productions , performances , knowing that maybe it was going_to be the last production , the last performance . And the audience knew the same . And that basic feeling returned us to the basic simplicity of life . We lost our egomania . We lost our self-importance . And we ' ve ( become ) simply normal people , endangered , but still free in our hearts and in our minds . . . . Q : Is it ironic that art flourished here in a time of such stress ? A : It was a very strong and active presence . . . . ( But ) you need normal life for the flourishing of art . I don ' t want to mystify the situation . I don ' t want people to have a hidden desire to be in a war in_order to be creative in their arts . It ' s better to walk on the beach on the Pacific , ( watch ) a sunset and make poetry . It ' s a better inspiration than listening to grenades and being afraid to be killed or injured . But the point is , that even in such an extreme situation , the artist remains the artist ; and for me , the major feature which defines the artist is his or her vision for freedom . Q : Do you think , then , that people are seizing upon culture to remind them of what their lives were once like ? A : Culture is a part of basic human nature , of deep humanity . It is normal that people are responding , in a cultural way , to crisis . Life is not just food , it ' s something spiritual . People live also with feelings , not just with their stomachs . People have to have food for their souls . It ' s hard to generalize . It ' s something to do with the rhythm of life . ( Without art ) , it just makes us forget something that is more subtle , and more needed for our dreams . Q : How do people respond to art in_troubled times ? A : I think the response is great . It ' s proved by 20 # 000 people who line_up in Sarajevo for a film festival . We had packed houses for every production . People responded to the very fact we were working under those circumstances . . . . Q : But are you able to function under these circumstances ? A : These circumstances are wonderful , compared with the circumstances before the ultimatum . . . . For example , today , when we talk , there ' s not such a chance to die on the spot . In all other days before this ultimatum , it was . It wasn ' t a fictional point . It was a real chance to die at any place , at any time in the city . And it created a special kind of behavior , a special way of moving through the city . I remember the days when we prepared our latest productions . It was in December of last year , and it was one of the most difficult periods in the war . They was shelling every single day . Every single day , five or six people were massacred in the center of the city . And dozens were injured . But nobody was late for rehearsal . It was very exciting for me to work with people who decided to live , and to work . And from that feeling came a special strength which overcame the situation . But honestly speaking , everything is pure luck . To survive in this city means before all , that you are the lucky one . So far . Q : Tell me about your last production , &quot; Silk Drums. &quot; A : The latest one was based on Japanese classical theater . . . . We ' ve already played 18 productions in different places in the city , mostly in hospitals , refugee centers . Because this time we wanted to approach people who are not_able to come_to the theater -- the theater building . It was a very exciting , very special experience for all_of us . Q : What was the audience reaction ? A : It was incredible , because the first part , &quot; Birdcatcher in Hell &quot; is comic , so it ' s expected to be well-received . But the second part is a very sophisticated and a very difficult play of &quot; Agoron. &quot; It ' s about the angel who fell from Earth , it ' s a kind of fairy tale , but in a Japanese Buddhist way , with a lot of dance . Almost every time , the entire audience was completely silent during the second part . We went_to some places like the refugee centers where there were people . . . whom I ' m not sure had ever seen the theater before . . . . ( At Kosevo hospital ) , most of ( the audience ) were without legs , without arms and ( the lead actor ) was dancing all_the time . And they were shelling at_the_same_time . So , it ' s impossible to transfer an experience like this one . Q : To what do you attribute your reception ? Was it the message of the play ? A : We are not talking_about war , death and love in the production . We are talking_about life , and dreams and freedom . Surely , it is the most difficult audience you can imagine . Because the audience has such experience , life experience . You hardly can match that experience . You have to do something at least at the same level of their experience . And we have the same experience as them . So , before we go before them , we try to translate our experience . During the film festival , we had more_than 20 # 000 people in 10 days . It was a major film festival . We had three theaters , 10 screenings per day . And the main hall was at the corner of . . . &quot; Sniper Alley. &quot; They were shooting all_the time . And people were coming_to the screening with good perfumes -- the clothes were just wonderful . They would run_across the street to avoid the snipers . Then , they would come_to the theater . . . . Q : What do you think that says about cinema , about theater ? A : In my mind , it is a basic need for spiritual improvement , for spiritual development . This war defines many things , including the journalism and the culture . The journalism appeared to be less powerful than we thought before the war . Culture appeared to be more powerful than we thought before the war . It proves that culture does not only belong_to the bourgeois class . It belongs_to everybody . People were eager to participate in these cultural activities , professional theater , film , exhibitions and so on . . . . This situation moved the basic social instinct to survive . I always believed that art is the basic creative force in human nature . This situation proved it for all_the people , not just for the artists . It is a life force . And everything that is a life force is welcomed . . . . Many people , many journalists , asked me during the film festival , &quot; Why the film festival during the war ? &quot; But I say , &quot; Why the war during the film festival ? &quot; -- that is the question . It ' s normal to have a film festival in a big European city . . . . ( But ) this is a completely different reality . So , my theater experience helped me a lot to keep going . I treat my former life as something which happened , which is over , like a theater performance . . . . It was a big , and for me , a very happy production . And now , it ' s over . And it cannot be again anymore . This is another reality , a second life . Q : After the war , will you return to the previous performance ? A : No . It ' s impossible . It doesn ' t look_like the original . Never . Q : What will you do ? A : We must find something else . Something new . And when I say we , I don ' t just mean us in Sarajevo , in Bosnia . . . . We must find a new vision of the world. * I don ' t want people to desire to be in a war to be creative . It ' s better to walk on the beach , ( watch ) a sunset . It ' s a better inspiration than listening to grenades . Life is not just food , it ' s something spiritual . People live also with feelings , not just with their stomachs . People have to have food for their souls . Preparing our latest productions , it was one of the most difficult periods in the war . They were shelling every day . But nobody was late for rehearsal .</TEXT>
