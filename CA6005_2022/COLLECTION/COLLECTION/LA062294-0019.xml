   <HEADLINE> RELATIONSHIPS : MANY SEE INFIDELITY AS ULTIMATE BETRAYAL OF TRUST , BUT SOME OVERCOME IT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Fiona had an affair after 10 years of marriage , she never imagined the ramifications of her actions . &quot; It all seemed harmless at first , &quot; says the 40-year-old Corona del Mar writer , who asked that her name be changed , as did others in the story . &quot; My husband and I had been arguing a lot and weren ' t as intimate as I wanted to be . The new person was really interested in me and didn ' t hassle me like my husband. &quot; When Fiona ' s husband confronted her one night , she told him the truth . The couple agreed to work_out their problems , but he couldn ' t contain his anger . &quot; Even though we needed to go our separate ways , what I regret most is my betrayal of his trust . I had been so angry at him for not being what I wanted him to be that I didn ' t even consider what he would go_through . He didn ' t deserve to be treated that way , &quot; she says . Many married people and singles in committed relationships see infidelity as the ultimate betrayal , says marriage , family , child counselor Janet Whitney , who is with Coastline Counseling in Newport Beach . She has seen the aftershocks of a partner having_sex outside of marriage . &quot; When someone has an affair , it takes the specialness away from the marriage relationship and cheapens everything , &quot; she says . &quot; For people who desire an honest relationship , it is difficult for them to get_over the betrayal , and the relationship eventually fails . &quot; Others stay_together , but the betrayed person will close_off part of himself or herself and continue to function in the relationship on a more limited basis . Only those individuals who acknowledge they have a problem and get help can overcome what happened , yet a scar always remains , &quot; Whitney says . Many feel the biggest casualty of infidelity is trust . &quot; The person who was cheated_on constantly questions the other person ' s honesty . Questions such_as ' Did she ever love me ? ' and ' Is he really going where he says he ' s going ? ' are very common , natural reactions , &quot; Whitney says . &quot; Individuals who had the affairs also start not trusting themselves . Many people will wonder how they could have hurt someone they loved. &quot; National surveys indicate that between 30 % and 60 % of married_men and women have had an affair . &quot; Infidelity has balanced out between men and women , &quot; Whitney says . While it is common for anyone in a marriage or committed relationship to have fleeting thoughts about committing adultery , many people don ' t act_on their fantasies , she says . Individuals who start affairs do so for a number of reasons : * They come from a family where infidelity is common and accepted . * They suffer from a lack of chemistry or compatibility with their partners . * They have trouble with commitment . Whatever the reason , the upheaval a discovered affair causes often leads to the demise of the marriage . Just ask Estella . When the 40-year-old graphic designer , who lives_in Tustin , met her husband-to-be , he seemed like a warm father and potentially loving husband . After three months together , Estella was madly in_love and quickly agreed to marriage . One month into the marriage , though , she began finding notes on top of his dresser about meeting women for drinks . &quot; When I found the notes , I confronted him , and he admitted to cheating on me , saying that he was bored and didn ' t feel_like we were getting_along , &quot; she says . &quot; I had thought of him like Humphrey Bogart . He had some rough edges , but there was a lot of attraction there , so we tried to work things out . But after eight months we separated because he continued to cheat_on me. &quot; For Estella the experience took time to get_over . &quot; The first thing I did was ask myself what I ' d done wrong , &quot; she says . &quot; Then after awhile , I realized he was a jerk . But then I began to ask myself why I picked someone like that . I ended_up going_through therapy over the fact that I couldn ' t trust my instincts. &quot; Although it happened 11 years ago , Estella feels she is still affected . &quot; I think I ' ll always be more cautious and less trusting , &quot; she says . With infidelity , women tend to blame themselves more often than men , says Whitney . When Raymond ' s live-in girlfriend and mother of his young son announced it was over because she was having an affair with his best_friend , the 34-year-old Santa Ana teacher never considered it could be his fault . &quot; Things weren ' t running completely smoothly , but nothing I ' d done warranted that kind of drastic action , &quot; he says . Not only did Raymond ' s girlfriend have an affair , but she thought he would stay home and watch their son while she went_out . &quot; I have no idea why she thought I would stay there while she cheated_on me , but after she left , I packed up our stuff and left with my son. &quot; When his girlfriend returned , she called the police and Raymond returned with their son . They made arrangements for joint custody . When her new relationship didn ' t work_out , she asked Raymond to come_back . &quot; I had no intentions of working things out , &quot; he says . &quot; As far as I was concerned , she ended it when she starting sleeping_with my friend . I could never trust her again . Infidelity is completely unacceptable. &quot; Whitney says , &quot; It used to be 20 years ago that men played_around and women didn ' t say that much , but people aren ' t ignoring it anymore . There has been a shift in attitudes toward a focus_on home and honesty in relationships , and less people are tolerant of adultery nowadays. &quot; For some , however , affairs don ' t carry much significance . Fred , a 45-year-old Costa Mesa graphic designer , has been married twice and had affairs during both marriages . He says he feels no guilt . His first affair occurred when he was 20 . He had been married for a year and wasn ' t spending much time with his wife because they were both busy developing their careers . His wife eventually found_out about his affair , but Fred says she didn ' t seem to care because , he thinks , she was having one of_her_own . After three years , the marriage ended when she moved_out of state . According to Fred , they are still friends . Fred married a second time , at 27 . They were married 10 years , and he says that he cheated_on her many times because she had less of a sex_drive than he did . He says he doesn ' t think she cared about his flings . &quot; Sometimes the women I was sleeping_with would visit my wife and tell her I was going_to leave her , but that was a lie , because I loved my wife , &quot; he says . &quot; When I got home later , all she ' d say was that someone had visited . I don ' t think she condoned my affairs , but they didn ' t really bother her because she ' d been raised with a father who did similar things to her mother and she grew_up to accept it. &quot; The marriage ended when Fred began commuting from Huntington Beach to San Jose and his ex-wife met someone else and asked_for a divorce . Afterward , Fred lived with another woman whom he also worked with and says he never found it necessary to cheat_on her . &quot; We were very compatible . She also had a 12-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son at the time , whom I became very close to . The family atmosphere really influenced me. &quot; Fred is now living with a woman and having an affair with someone else , whom he considers his soul_mate . &quot; I feel_like I ' ve finally found the right person , &quot; he says . &quot; When we ' re both able to get_out of our present relationships and get_together , I don ' t think I ' ll find it necessary to have affairs. &quot; * Experts say that when infidelity occurs , partners sense something on some level and often choose to ignore the signals . Sometimes , however , there are no signs . Laura ' s story reads like a psychological thriller . The 37-year-old Fullerton woman who works in the retail industry was working in the restaurant industry when she met a handsome , charming man who seemed like perfect husband material . &quot; At work he was really popular and a hard_worker , &quot; she says . &quot; He was also Jewish , like me , which was even more special , since my previous boyfriend wasn ' t. &quot; Her new boyfriend met her family and immediately got_along well with her parents and brother . After six months of dating , they were engaged and were married six months later . &quot; He seemed to love my family ; we never fought , and my co-workers were all jealous . He ' d do things like come_to pick_up my car during the day and get_it washed , &quot; she says . About two years after the wedding , Laura ' s husband told her he couldn ' t be married anymore and left . Laura was devastated by his departure , but this feeling was soon replaced with shock as she made calls to his co-workers and found that he ' d been having an affair with a waitress with whom he shared a cocaine habit . He ' d also been stealing money from work to buy drugs . &quot; If I had known how many problems he had , I would never have married him . But he was never himself with me , &quot; she says . &quot; He pulled_out before he revealed his real personality and went_to live with his girlfriend. &quot; Although she was glad to get_out of the marriage , Laura says she is bitter over the experience , especially because she lost time . By now she had planned to be happily married and to have_young children . Laura says she is cynical when friends talk_about making wedding plans . &quot; I don ' t have a lot of trust in marriage , which is sad , &quot; she says . &quot; Before my ex-husband , I had only the highest regard for marriage . I thought that if you did everything right , things would work_out all_right , but I was wrong. &quot;</TEXT>
