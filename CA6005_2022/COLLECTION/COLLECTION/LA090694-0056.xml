   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR ' DAY OF THE DEAD '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Inlakech Theater_Company , an Oxnard-based arts group , and the city of Ventura will sponsor a series of activities this fall to celebrate Dia de los Muertos , or Day of the Dead , a traditional Latin_American festival . Tradition has it that on Dia de los Muertos , the dead are allowed to leave their land , Mictlan , and return to the homes they once knew , &quot; to their beloved ones who are calling them and asking them to come_back , &quot; said Javier Gomez , the Inlakech artistic director . &quot; It ' s a holiday where you find communion with the people who have meant something to you , &quot; he said . &quot; The essence of the celebration is not how people died , but how they lived. &quot; Beginning Sept . 17 , on each Saturday for five weeks in a row , area residents can attend free workshops at the West Harrison Community_Center in Ventura from 9 a.m. to noon . At the three-hour workshops , participants will learn about the history of Muertos celebration and will create &quot; Muertos masks &quot; out of plaster and paint them . The masks are made by pressing wet plaster to a face , then painting the dried product . The masks may be carried or worn in the procession on Nov . 1 , the Dia de los Muertos . The festivities will begin at 3 p.m. at the community_center . From 3 to 5 p.m. , local artists will paint residents ' faces with skeletal designs . At 5 p.m. , the Inlakech Ballet Folklorico will perform , and at 5:45 p.m. , the Aztec dance troupe will do a traditional dance . The procession commences at 6 p.m. , winding through west Ventura streets to end at the Livery at 34 N . Palm Street , where participants can eat traditional Mexican foods , view Muertos masks made by local schoolchildren and watch plays and dance performances . The festival ' s theme this year is &quot; Happy Muerte to You , &quot; Gomez said , promising a special sighting of Elvis at the Nov . 1 procession . CONSTANCE SOMMER</TEXT>
