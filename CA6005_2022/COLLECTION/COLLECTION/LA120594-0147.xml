   <TEXT> Car Exports to Europe Boost October Gain : Japan ' s vehicle exports in October registered their biggest gain in 20 months , the result of a 50.8 % surge in sales to Western Europe , a trade association said . The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn . said total exports of cars , trucks and buses rose 4.0 % from last October to 364 # 439 units.The increase , led by Toyota Motor Corp. , was the biggest year-on-year rise in any month since March , 1993 . Exports to the United States fell 2.6 % to 125 # 334 units and exports to Asia also fell 2.6 % , to 51 # 203 units , the industry association said . Exports to the European Union rose , however , to 62 # 564 vehicles . The percentage gain in exports to the EU was so large chiefly because exports a year earlier were very low , said Keith Donaldson , an auto analyst at Salomon Bros . Japan ' s car exports fell sharply and without interruption through the last_half of 1993 and the first_half of this year , as auto_makers seeking to escape the effects of the strong yen moved production out of Japan .</TEXT>
