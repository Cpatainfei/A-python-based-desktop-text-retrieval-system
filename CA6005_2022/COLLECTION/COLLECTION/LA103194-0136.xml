   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL JOINS MIDEAST TALKS ON ECONOMY ; COMMERCE : OFFICIALS , BUSINESS_LEADERS FROM 60 NATIONS SEEK TO CONVERT PEACE INTO PROSPERITY . CHRISTOPHER OFFERS U.S. PLAN FOR REGION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With Israel and its Arab neighbors steadily chipping_away_at half a century of war and hatred , government officials and business_leaders from more_than 60 nations gathered Sunday at Morocco ' s royal palace to search for ways to convert peace into greater prosperity for the region . &quot; There is no reason why the economic miracles that are transforming parts of Asia , Eastern Europe and Latin_America cannot also transform this region , &quot; U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher told the opening session of the Middle_East and North Africa Economic Summit . &quot; I can foresee a day when the 300 million people of the Middle_East and North Africa , so_long held_back by strife and hatred , can finally join the mainstream of international commerce , &quot; he said . Christopher , seated next to Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat , outlined a four-point U.S. plan to stimulate investment , trade and tourism in a region where war and hostility have often built impenetrable economic barriers between the closest of neighbors , costing billions of dollars a year in lost production . Although he did not include it in the four-point plan , Christopher also called_for an end to the Arab economic boycott of Israel . He said the boycott has virtually collapsed and no longer has much economic impact but said , &quot; We want to have a formal recognition that the boycott has come_to an end. &quot; U.S. officials said the conference probably will urge the Arab League to repeal the boycott . With most league members represented in Casablanca , such an appeal would probably carry substantial weight . The conference , attended by 10 heads_of_state or government , 60 Cabinet_ministers , more_than 400 other government officials and -- probably most important -- more_than 1 # 000 business people , amounts to a coming-out party for Israel , which only a_few years ago was not welcome at_large Arab-dominated regional meetings . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , in an often-emotional review of Israel ' s struggle for peace and sovereignty , said the conference , attended by virtually all Arab governments , provides an &quot; opportunity to talk to one another , to know one another. &quot; He said peace must be &quot; translated into a better life for every citizen , &quot; adding , &quot; Poverty is the fertile ground for the growth of Hamas and Islamic Jihad , &quot; two radical Islamic terrorist organizations and sworn enemies of Arab-Israeli rapprochement . Christopher said the meeting reflects &quot; the growing acceptance of Israel in the Middle_East &quot; almost 50 years after the Jewish state was born in a bloody struggle against the surrounding Arab countries that wanted to expel it from the region . Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told reporters : &quot; This conference opens a new chapter in the outlook and in the destiny of the Middle_East . Until now , we were basically solving problems of the past and putting an end of the conflicts of yesterday . We are trying now to build a new economic structure in the Middle_East so people will feel the benefits and taste the fruits of peace. &quot; In his speech , Christopher described the steps that Washington believes will rebuild the regional economy and produce greater growth than the Middle_East has enjoyed this century : * Elimination of most existing tariffs and other trade_barriers to permit &quot; the free movement of goods , capital , ideas and labor across the borders of the Middle_East and North Africa. &quot; * Creation of a Middle_East and North Africa Bank to finance projects across the region . U.S. officials said the bank ' s capital would come from the United States , Japan , the European Union and others , including Mideast countries that hope to obtain loans . * Establishment of a regional tourism board to promote visits across the region , such_as package tours for Americans , Europeans and others that would combine attractions such_as the religious shrines in Jerusalem with the archeological sites in Arab countries like Jordan and Egypt . * Development of a regional business council to integrate trade relations and commercial opportunities throughout the region . If the conference approves the program as expected , U.S. officials said Washington will contribute some of the money but that most of it will have to come from other governments and the private sector . Talking to reporters on the flight from Riyadh , Saudi_Arabia , to Casablanca , Christopher said the peace process will succeed only if it produces &quot; the economic benefits which will show the people that peace is not just a sterile concept but that it portends positive things in their lives. &quot; He said only private investment can produce the kind of economic clout that the region needs . But he said business people cannot be expected to invest until the region overcomes the war and instability that have marked it for so_long . Peres agreed that private money is the key . &quot; Governments have policies but no money ; companies have money but no political goals , &quot; he said . &quot; At this conference , we want to bring the two together so that the companies invest in the projects that interest them , that appear to them to be profitable , and the governments provide the policy direction and the guarantees the businesses need to proceed. &quot; U.S. officials say much of the money must be generated within the region , with rich countries such_as Saudi_Arabia and the other monarchies along the Persian_Gulf contributing much of the capital . But Arab states also fill_out the lower end of the economic scale . Israel , once among the region ' s poor , has established itself in the middle . Peres said Israel is prepared to help some of its poorer neighbors . &quot; We do not think that Israel should remain an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty , &quot; he said . &quot; We think that the better_off our neighbors are , the better_off we will be . Poverty , want and desperation contribute a lot to the tensions , the conflict and the terrorism in the region. &quot; On a related subject , Christopher dismissed as &quot; public posturing &quot; the complaints of some Israeli officials that President Clinton obtained almost nothing new in his Damascus meeting last week with Syrian President Hafez Assad . At the time , U.S. officials said the Clinton-Assad talks produced small but significant advances in the painfully slow Syria-Israel peace negotiations . &quot; This is a very intense negotiation with very difficult issues , and both parties are conducting themselves in public in a way to maximize their negotiating position , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t find it surprising that either party would tend to downplay any concessions they might have received . . . . that ' s just part of this very , very tough negotiation. &quot; Peres seemed to agree . He said Clinton ' s trip was worthwhile because as long as &quot; Syria remains in the orbit of negotiations , then Syria should be in the orbit of visits. &quot; The conference , nearly two years in the planning , is sponsored by the World Economic Forum of Geneva and the Council on Foreign Relations in New York under the patronage of King Hassan II of Morocco .</TEXT>
