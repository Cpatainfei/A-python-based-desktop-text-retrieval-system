   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S SURPLUS WITH U.S. SOARS BY A BLOATED 20 % ; TRADE : THE JULY FIGURE REVIVES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHEN -- OR WHETHER -- THE POLITICALLY SENSITIVE FIGURE WILL COME DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States rose 20 % in July to its second-highest level ever , the Finance Ministry said Friday , raising questions anew about when -- or whether -- the politically sensitive surplus will decline . The $ 5.63-billion bilateral surplus -- almost half of Japan ' s $ 12.3-billion global surplus for July -- was fueled by strong American demand for Japanese automobiles , machinery and semiconductors , Finance Ministry spokesman Fumio Tomori said . Although the global surplus increased a modest 4 % in July , it surprised many analysts because of earlier forecasts of a decline . Geoffrey Barker , an analyst at Baring Securities Ltd. , said the jump in the global surplus was &quot; disappointing &quot; because preliminary figures for the first 20 days of July had indicated that the monthly surplus would fall . In yen terms , the global figure is showing a declining trend , but this has been more_than offset in dollar terms by the strong rise in the Japanese currency . The value of the dollar averaged 99.53 yen in July , compared to 108 yen a year earlier . While the dollar has recovered from its record low of 96.60 yen set_in mid-July , closing Friday in Tokyo at 100.30 , Japan ' s continuing surpluses could lead to renewed dollar weakness . The dollar closed trading in New York on Friday at 100.15 yen , down from 100.23. &quot; We are going_to be still working_on pretty big surpluses through to the end of the year , &quot; DB Capital Markets ( Asia ) Ltd . analyst Kenneth Courtis said . &quot; Surpluses may have already peaked , but they aren ' t going_to come_down quickly. &quot; The so-called &quot; J-curve &quot; effect of a strong yen inflating the dollar value of exports will continue to apply as long as the dollar stays_at about 100 yen , economists said . The J-curve effect assumes an eventual fall_in the volume of Japan ' s exports as they become less price-competitive , but some economists said Japan ' s exports could remain strong . &quot; Japanese products will continue to be bought by U.S. and Asian users even at higher prices , as their quality is still in_demand , &quot; Bank of Tokyo economist Yoichi Nakagawa said . Continued high or rising surpluses could also lead to greater pressure from the U.S._government on Japan to boost imports more rapidly through overall economic stimulus and specific market-opening measures . Washington has threatened to impose sanctions unless agreements are reached by Sept . 30 in bilateral trade talks covering automobiles and auto parts , insurance and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment . Although Japan recorded increased exports in July , there was also strong growth in the import of semiconductors , as well as aircraft and office equipment . Imports of lumber and oil fell . Robert Feldman , an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. , said the reported drop_in oil imports casts doubt on the accuracy of the monthly statistics in reflecting real trends . Overall imports have been running about 15 % higher this year than last year , and &quot; all_of a sudden in July there was a mere 8 % increase , &quot; Feldman said . &quot; It appears that oil imports were down 3 % . &quot; A drop_in oil imports is especially unbelievable because of signs that an economic recovery is getting under way , he said . &quot; Perhaps some paperwork just got done late , or something like that . . . . It just doesn ' t make any sense . It has to be a reporting blip. &quot; The view that any slowdown in import growth is only temporary was bolstered by a separate report released Friday by the Economic Planning Agency stating that a recovery in private consumption is gaining strength . Signs of renewed corporate capital spending are also emerging , it said . The overall assessment , in the agency ' s monthly report , was that the economy &quot; is gently emerging from its prior sluggish state. &quot; The agency stopped short of declaring that the long-awaited recovery is under way . Reuters contributed to this report .</TEXT>
