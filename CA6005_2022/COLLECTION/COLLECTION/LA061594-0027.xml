   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW / HISTORY ; AS YELTSIN SEES IT -- INCLUDING REVISIONS ; THE STRUGGLE FOR RUSSIA ; BY BORIS YELTSIN , TRANSLATED BY CATHERINE A . FITZPATRICK ( TIMES BOOKS : $ 25 , 316 PAGES )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that Solzhenitsyn has renounced literature in favor of politics , is there room in the Russian literary pantheon for politician-turned-author Boris Yeltsin ? * Uh , no . Yeltsin ' s second and latest book , &quot; The Struggle for Russia , &quot; is a political memoir fashioned out of excerpts from a journal that he apparently managed to keep during a tumultuous three-year period that included the failed coup of August , 1991 ; the final disintegration of the Soviet_Union ; the shoot-out at the Russian parliament , and miscellaneous other crises . &quot; Whether people like it or not , &quot; the first elected president of Russia muses out loud , &quot; they must figure_out who this Yeltsin is -- what kind of person is he , what does he think , where is he taking us ? &quot; While Yeltsin ' s book is , at moments , a worthy account of contemporary Russian politics from an insider ' s point_of_view , Yeltsin neither aspires to nor achieves much intimacy in his reflections or much grandeur in his prose . Rather , he presents himself as a hard-working politician who is really a just-plain-Ivan kind of guy . Now and then , Yeltsin allows us to glimpse the more private facets of his life : &quot; I suffer from insomnia , &quot; he explains , and he confesses to stage_fright : &quot; When I have to go_on TV , I sweat bullets. &quot; Yeltsin is far more interested in explaining ( or justifying ) himself in the eyes of history . He often refers to himself in the third_person as &quot; Yeltsin &quot; or , more often , &quot; the president. &quot; And he invariably styles himself as a democratic activist -- his attack on Mikhail Gorbachev in the last_days of the Soviet_Union , for example , is explained as a matter of principle , not politics . &quot; Unlike most democrats , I surmised that the threat of dictatorship came not only from ' Gorby ' s ' entourage but also from Gorbachev himself , &quot; Yeltsin declares . &quot; And that was truly terrible. &quot; Only rarely does Yeltsin give us a truly startling insight into his own political destiny , as when he ponders the yellowing papers in a secret_police file on the arrest of his father during the worst years of the Stalinist terror : &quot; I was only three years old at the time of my father ' s arrest , &quot; he recalls , &quot; but I remember to this day all_the horror and fear. &quot; More often , Yeltsin contents himself with dishing the inside story on Kremlin politics in the final days of the Soviet_Union and the stormiest moments of its tumultuous aftermath . Yeltsin also rises to his own defense in explaining his trepidation in the days leading_up to the assault on the White_House . Condemning the insurrectionists as &quot; neo-Nazis , bandits and outright fascists , &quot; he insists that he acted courageously and decisively to crush the threat to the infant Russian democracy . The publisher is candid enough to advise us that &quot; in a_few places , Yeltsin himself has exercised the author ' s prerogative to amend his observations and place them in perspective. &quot; In other words , Yeltsin has rewritten his journal entries so that they support his claim to a place in world history . &quot; Something amazing happened , &quot; he writes_about the collapse of communism . &quot; Overnight , a new Russia -- ' Boris Yeltsin ' s Russia ' -- took the place of the Soviet_Union in international politics. &quot; We do not yet know whether Yeltsin , like Gorbachev , will end_up on the dust heap of history . But , in the meantime , Yeltsin is hoping that readers in Russia and America , too , are still interested in knowing he thinks_of himself and his curious fate as &quot; the first freely chosen president of Russia. &quot;</TEXT>
