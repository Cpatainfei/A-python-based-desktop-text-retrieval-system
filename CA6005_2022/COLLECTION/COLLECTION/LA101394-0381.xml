   <HEADLINE> BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN_GULF ; PENTAGON TAKES STEPS TO PREVENT MYSTERIOUS GULF WAR ILLNESS ; HEALTH : RECORDS WILL BE KEPT OF HAZARDOUS EXPOSURE . VACCINE REQUIREMENTS OF ' 91 OPERATION WILL BE DROPPED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Pentagon , hoping to prevent a repeat of the mysterious spate of illnesses in those who served in the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War , will require medical personnel deployed to Kuwait in the current operation to keep careful records of troop exposure to possible environmental hazards and drug treatments , officials said Wednesday . &quot; This time we will try to get this information as we go instead of after the fact , &quot; said Col . Doug Hart , a spokesman for the Defense_Department . &quot; We will be putting more emphasis on the recording of things than was done before . we ' ll have more information than we had last time. &quot; Also , the Pentagon will not require soldiers to take certain preventive drugs and vaccines that were given_in the earlier deployment and were blamed by many for medical problems . An estimated 20 # 000 of the nearly 700 # 000 troops who served in the Gulf four years ago have reported numerous ailments , including fatigue , skin_rashes , muscle and joint pain , headaches , memory_loss , shortness of breath and gastrointestinal problems , as well as birth_defects in their offspring . Their complaints have prompted a series of investigations that thus far have yielded no definitive conclusions . The medical personnel ' s primary assignment will be to provide care_for the troops , a function no different from that in any other military operation , Hart said . However , they also will be asked to register all treatments and environmental exposures and any other additional information that could prove useful should additional illnesses develop , or as part of the ongoing investigation of the still-unsolved syndrome . Medical teams in the Persian_Gulf &quot; will be able to provide information and investigate industrial pollutants , stress , infectious_diseases and possible biological and chemical_warfare , &quot; Hart added . &quot; It will make a difference , having these people there , recording all this stuff immediately . that ' s the one thing we did learn from previous experience -- it is taking us a lot longer because we ' re doing_it after the fact. &quot; Asked earlier in the week about Persian_Gulf_War Syndrome , Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , told reporters that &quot; no one is more concerned and frustrated about our inability to get_at the root of that problem than the Defense Department. &quot; He added : &quot; I don ' t have an easy answer_for anyone , because we don ' t know what really happened , other_than that we are going_to watch this very , very carefully for any signs of possible repetition. &quot; No single substance or organism has been identified as the cause of the health_problems suffered by veterans of Operation_Desert_Storm . But many of the troops were exposed to a variety of potentially toxic chemicals , as in fumes and smoke from oil-well fires , diesel fumes , toxic paints , pesticides and depleted uranium used in munitions and armor . They were also given at least three drugs under special circumstances in which the military and the Food and Drug Administration waived the usual informed-consent procedures because of expected battlefield conditions . The drugs included pyridostigmine bromide , a drug to protect against chemical_warfare , which is licensed only for the treatment of myasthenia gravis , a chronic muscle weakness disorder ; an as-yet-unapproved vaccine to combat botulism , and a licensed vaccine to protect against anthrax . None of the three is being administered to soldiers serving in the current deployment , Hart said . Desert Storm soldiers were instructed to take a series of pyridostigmine bromide tablets to ward_off the potential effects of chemical_warfare . But the drug has side_effects , among them serious gastrointestinal symptoms . Many soldiers reported uncontrolled vomiting after taking the drug , in addition to bouts of pain and other disabling ailments . Hart denied that Gulf War Syndrome was the reason Defense_Department officials decided against requiring the drug this time . &quot; It ' s available but not required . If the threat is strong enough , it will be distributed , &quot; he said . &quot; At this point , we don ' t think the threat is the same. &quot; The anthrax and botulism vaccines have not been administered this time either , he said . However , the troops have received routine mandatory inoculations known to be safe , Hart said , including vaccines to protect against hepatitis , influenza , measles , polio and tetanus . Gulf War Syndrome Facts about the illness that has stricken Gulf veterans : * Background : Gulf War Syndrome is a mysterious collection of illnesses affecting at least 200 # 000 men and women who served in Desert Storm . Some spouses have also complained of ill effects . * Symptoms : Debilitating fatigue , skin_rash , headaches , muscle or joint pain , chest_pain , shortness of breath , memory_loss , sleep disturbances and diarrhea . * Cause : Its existence has been validated by the National Institutes of Health , but no specific cause has been diagnosed . Theories include stress , parasites and reactions to pills or inoculations designed to counter the effects of chemical_warfare . Other suspected causes include exposure to chemical toxins , ammunition made from depleted uranium , poor sanitation , oil-well fires , burning landfills or a combination of these factors .
