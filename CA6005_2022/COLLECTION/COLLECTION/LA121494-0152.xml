   <HEADLINE> ' TO LIVE ' : A SWEEPING SAGE OF MODERN CHINA ; POLITICS : BEIJING ' S DECISION TO BAN THE FILM AND LIMIT MEDIA ACCESS TO ITS PRINCIPALS HAS CREATED PROBLEMS FOR THE MOVIE ' S U.S. RELEASING COMPANY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Zhang Yimou ' s new film , &quot; To Live , &quot; which opens today , has been banned in Zhang ' s native China , a situation that ' s become a thorn in the side of the Samuel Goldwyn Co. , which is releasing the film . Goldwyn bought the rights to release &quot; To Live &quot; in the United States when it was still in script form . Company Chairman Samuel Goldwyn Jr . had been impressed by Zhang ' s previous films such_as &quot; Ju Dou &quot; and &quot; Raise the Red Lantern , &quot; both of which were nominated for best foreign-language film . An intimate epic about a family ' s survival , during and after the Chinese_revolution , the film reminded Goldwyn of &quot; Gone With the Wind &quot; ; to him , &quot; To Live &quot; was &quot; positive &quot; and life-affirming . The Chinese government came_to a different conclusion , however . Initially Zhang and the film ' s stars , Gong Li and Ge You , were allowed to leave the country to attend last May ' s Cannes Film Festival , where it won the Grand_Jury Prize and the best actor award . When it came time for Zhang to speak about the film in Paris , though , he was told he was not allowed to do so , nor to attend the festival . Zhang returned home . Why the about-face ? &quot; I think they did_it to humiliate him , &quot; Goldwyn says . Goldwyn says he ' s never been clear as_to what exactly the Chinese government objects to in &quot; To Live &quot; : &quot; It had to have approval when it was filmed . Half the Chinese army is in this film. &quot; Also , he says , there is no criticism of the current regime and such past events as the Cultural Revolution have already been publicly discredited in China . For five months Goldwyn has been trying to get Zhang as well as Gong Li and Ge You to the United States to help promote the film . &quot; But every time I try to talk to someone , this curtain descends. &quot; The Chinese Film &amp; Export Committee would not return The Times ' repeated requests for comment . The popular Gong Li -- who according to a recent profile in the New Yorker is the seventh most recognized person in China ( Zhang , with whom she lives , is sixth ) -- had tentatively agreed to answer questions about the film by telephone but has since declined , citing her nervousness about the political situation , according to a Goldwyn spokeswoman . It ' s not surprising , says Goldwyn . Even though she was allowed to attend the Cannes Festival , after Zhang was called home , Gong Li became very circumspect about media inquiries . The situation since then has worsened . &quot; To Live &quot; has been barred from release in China and production on Zhang ' s &quot; Triads , &quot; a gangster film , was recently shut_down , says Goldwyn . The director was reportedly asked to make changes in the script , which is being financed by mainland Chinese sources . Further complications arose when the Chinese government declined to submit &quot; To Live &quot; to the Academy of Motion_Pictures Arts and Sciences in the best foreign-language-film category . To be eligible , a film must officially be submitted by the country_of_origin . China had previously submitted &quot; Raise the Red Lantern &quot; and then withdrawn its support . But once it was submitted , the academy stood_firm and the film was nominated . ( In a similar incident , Poland withdrew Andrzej Wajda ' s &quot; Man of Iron &quot; in 1981 , but the academy nominated it anyway. ) Oddly , &quot; Strawberry and Chocolate , &quot; which is critical of the Cuban Communist government , has been submitted by that country as its official Oscar entry . &quot; The Chinese are pretending the film isn ' t there , &quot; says the academy ' s executive_director , Bruce Davis . &quot; It ' s caused some hand-wringing here , &quot; he admits . &quot; There ' s not much we can do if a country clamps_down on a film and refuses to submit it. &quot; Because there is some Hong Kong money in the film , Goldwyn had been hoping to persuade Hong Kong to officially submit the film , as it had done last year with another banned Chinese film , Chen Kaige ' s &quot; Farewell My Concubine. &quot; At first they agreed . &quot; Then they backed_down , &quot; says Goldwyn . &quot; The pressure on them is enormous. &quot; Goldwyn ' s only alternative is to submit the film in the general categories ( best picture , etc. ) &quot; which would put us up against ' Forrest Gump , ' &quot; he says . While Davis agrees that few foreign-language films ever make the cut for best picture ( Ingmar Bergman ' s &quot; Cries and Whispers &quot; in 1973 was the last ) , nominations in other categories ( acting , directing , writing , technical awards ) are less rare . Goldwyn hasn ' t given_up hope on the academy entirely . &quot; I just wish they ' d let me show it to their foreign film committee . They have no provision for films that are not submitted by a totalitarian government. &quot; But to reverse itself , Davis says , the academy itself would have to draft the movie . &quot; And to draft the movie would imply that we ' d seen all_the films made in China for the year and decided this was the best , &quot; he says . And Goldwyn hasn ' t given_up on getting Zhang to the United States to talk_about &quot; To Live &quot; and perhaps even to make a movie here . &quot; The man is in a class with other world-class filmmakers , Bergman and Fellini . He is a genuine voice. &quot; But , for now , a muffled one .</TEXT>
