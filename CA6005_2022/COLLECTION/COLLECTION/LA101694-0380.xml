   <HEADLINE> TRAVELING IN STYLE ; THE EMPEROR ' S LAST_RESORT ; WHEN THE CRUEL ROMAN RULER TIBERIUS GOT AWAY FROM IT ALL , HE HEADED TO THE FABLED ISLAND OF CAPRI AND THE FISHING VILLAGE OF SPERLONGA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> IT ' S NOT MY FAULT , THE ROMAN EMPEROR TIBERIUS ( 42 BC-37 AD ) must have said to himself when he began to commit some of his more spectacular atrocities toward the end of his reign . It ' s hard to grow_up the son of a ruthless , ambitious mother , Livia , and stepson of a celebrated tyrant , the one_and_only Augustus . What ' s a poor heir to do , if driven nearly mad by their schemes and maneuverings ? Tiberius Claudius Nero Caesar , to give his full name , tried to get_away from them . At the age of 36 , he fled to the Greek island of Rhodes , where he lived for seven years and cultivated his artistic side . He had been a brilliant soldier and fought a number of successful campaigns to enlarge and consolidate Rome ' s growing empire , but what he really wanted to do was hang_around with poets , artists and philosophers . When Augustus summoned him back to Rome in 4 AD , though , and named him his official heir , Tiberius had no choice but to obey , and in 14 AD , upon Augustus ' death , he became the empire ' s second autocratic ruler . Livia -- who , it was rumored , had poisoned most of her son ' s rivals and perhaps even his stepfather -- was delighted . Not so Tiberius . He spent most of the early years of his reign trying to persuade a reluctant Senate to reassume its legislative powers and restore some semblance of the vanished Republic . No one was up_to the task , so Tiberius , forced to become a despot , became increasingly morose and embittered -- the misanthropic figure of popular history . He fled south toward the island of Capri , in the Bay of Naples , where he spent most of the last 10 years of his life , indulging himself in the lubricious pursuits and cruelties recorded by ancient historians . Tiberius wasn ' t the first Roman to head south toward Capri for refuge , but he did_it more often than anybody else . The Romans were great road_builders , of course , and by the beginning of Tiberius ' reign had established a number of places along the coast toward Naples for rich patrician families and retired soldiers to vacation . The main artery south was the Via Appia , which wound through the Alban Hills toward the coast to Terracina , an ancient Spartan and Etruscan city that was then an important port . Today , Terracina is an agricultural and fishing center of about 40 # 000 people -- bustling , but with a characteristically laid-back southern atmosphere . The side streets off the main avenues are tight and shadowed ; the houses all have small , railed balconies and tall , shuttered windows behind which the inhabitants take refuge from the midday heat in summer . The harbor itself , with its rows of brightly colored fishing_boats of all shapes and sizes , never seems frantically busy -- and in summer , along the esplanade behind the public beaches , strollers walk arm in arm past hordes of sunbathers and swimmers . Much remains today to remind visitors of the town ' s classical and medieval past , including its most impressive relic , the Temple of Jupiter Anxur on the crest of rocky Mount St . Angelo , a summit that provides spectacular views over city and sea . FROM TERRACINA , THE VIA APPIA THRUSTS INLAND TOWARD FONDI AND ITRI , bypassing the coast until it links up with it again at Formia , about 24 miles to the south . In Tiberius ' time , there was a main artery along the sea named the Via Flacca ( after the Roman official Lucius Valerius Flaccus , who built it in 184 BC ) . Traces of this road are still visible . It was about 12 feet wide and skirted the coastline past the ancient fishing village of Sperlonga and around the slopes of the Aurunci Mountains that here descend to the Mediterranean . Tiberius himself , of course , never had to do much walking . He traveled_by trireme along the coast , while the accompanying legions and supply wagons marched overland . Sperlonga marked the halfway point between Rome and the Bay of Naples . It was also home_territory for Tiberius . His family on his mother ' s side were large landowners , and they owned villas in the area . The main one , where Tiberius always spent some time , was by the beach to the south , below the village . His visits were looked_forward to both by the locals , because of the prosperity they brought_to the area , and his soldiers , who were fond of the local white_wine . After the fall of the Roman_Empire , for more_than 1 # 000 years , this strip of coastal land around Sperlonga was almost entirely cut_off from the rest of the country . It could only be approached from the sea or by a narrow road , little more_than a footpath , from Fondi . The rediscovery of the region began during the building of a new highway along the coast in 1958 . Property prices soon began to soar . Outsiders were charmed by the sight of Sperlonga -- then little more_than a cluster of stone houses , stained an off-white by centuries of wind , sun and rain , perched on a rock thrust_out into the sea above an unspoiled shoreline . Today , Sperlonga has become a major tourist resort , with villas , hotels and pensioni sprawled along the beach . Newcomers , many of them from Rome , have snapped_up and remodeled dwellings in the old town itself and to the south , where the area is protected from exploitation by Rome ' s Department of Antiquities . IN THE SUMMER MONTHS , WHEN ALL OF EUROPE SEEMS TO EMPTY ITSELF out onto one piece of seashore or another , the beach here all but vanishes under long parallel rows of colored umbrellas and tanned bodies . Nevertheless , the aura of old Sperlonga , with its sense of a living past , remains strong . This is largely because of the discoveries made below the town during the construction of the road . The engineer in_charge was a devoted amateur archeologist named Erno Bellante , who took it upon himself to begin digging unofficially in and around a large cave at the southern end of the mile-long beach . The cave was known as the Grotto of Tiberius , and a late 19th-Century print shows people walking_about in the cave , with Sperlonga visible in the background . Bellante knew that earlier archeological discoveries had been made in the area -- a bearded stone head of Dionysius , for one -- and he suspected that the grotto would quickly yield more treasures . He was right . Among his early finds were the thigh , leg and foot of a gigantic statue , a beautiful stone head and about 500 other pieces , as well as a section of a pool that had once been in the cave . Since then , more_than 15 # 000 relics have been uncovered -- and the digging continues . The ruins of the villa where Tiberius used to stay can be visited , and a small museum has been built_on the scene to display the archeological finds . Among these are groups of statues , partially restored , depicting mythical events from the life of Ulysses -- including the blinding of the giant Polyphemus ; splendid heads of women and gods ; Roman copies of ancient_Greek statues and some rare Greek ceramics . A wing of the museum contains smaller artifacts , such_as plates , vases , ornaments , oil_lamps , animal sculptures and , most significantly , the skeletal head of a crocodile . The latter would seem to confirm the report by several historians that the emperor was not above tossing unfortunates to the beasts . As Sperlonga began to flourish in the 1960s , after centuries of poverty , the entire area known as the South Pontine , from Sabaudia in the north to Minturno in the south , became an increasingly important resort area . Even in winter tourists will show_up , guidebooks in_hand , for a look_at the region ' s better known attractions . At Sabaudia , it ' s a series of four coastal lakes at the edge of a national_park that also includes the ruins of an ancient Roman villa . At San Felice Circeo , a resort where wealthy Roman families have owned villas for 2 # 000 years , there are dozens of caves along the rocky shoreline , one of them named after Circe , the mythical enchantress who is supposed to have lived_in the area . At Gaeta , the main lure is a long , picturesque waterfront and a harbor full of fishing_boats , freighters and warships . Formia , right next door , is a busy commercial hub , badly bombed during World_War_II , but still containing notable Roman ruins , including the tomb of Cicero . Minturno features some splendid Roman remains , including an amphitheater built by Augustus . But it is Sperlonga that attracts the most visitors . They stroll along the maze of narrow streets and alleys , impassable to cars , or linger in the main piazza to gape at its ancient facades or stare out over the endless blue sea . The best days are in September and October , when the summer crowds are gone , the beaches are mostly empty and the water is still warm enough to swim in . My own fondest memories of the place , where my mother owned an exquisite little house for nearly 40 years , are of sitting on her terrace overlooking the coastline , or in the town piazza socializing with friends , sipping caffe latte or the still-delicious local wine . Then , too , there were the lazy hours on the beach , where we munched on fresh mozzarella di bufala and vine-ripened tomatoes in between dips . This was truly a way_of_life fit for an emperor . TIBERIUS ' FAVORITE SPOT , HOWEVER , REMAINED THE ISLE OF CAPRI , TO which he would sail directly from Sperlonga . His stepfather , Augustus , had been fond of the place , too , and spent time there -- but Tiberius moved_in permanently . Between the two of them , the emperors built themselves a dozen sumptuous residences on the small island , though the remains of only three survive . The best preserved is the Villa Jovis at the very tip of the eastern end , high above the town . It can be reached by a road that meanders up among olive groves , vineyards and whitewashed houses , with breath-taking views in all directions . Just past the entrance gate , with its cylindrical guard tower , is the Salto di Tiberio , or Tiberius ' Leap , a vantage_point at the edge of a cliff from which the emperor would arrange to have the people who displeased him hurled to their deaths on the rocks below . The villa itself , built around four huge cisterns to catch and store rainwater , sprawls over 20 # 000 square_feet , but must have been much larger in imperial times . It was a perfect refuge for a corrupt , misanthropic old_man suspicious and fearful of everyone and addicted to the perverse pleasures of the flesh . Capri , in fact , has always had a reputation for naughty goings-on . In 1917 , the_English writer Norman Douglas wrote &quot; South_Wind , &quot; a popular novel based on the local cavortings of the expatriates who had , like Tiberius , taken refuge there to indulge their eccentricities . A decade later , a Swedish doctor named Axel Munthe wrote &quot; The Story of San Michele , &quot; named for his residence at Anacapri , on the western side of the island , recounting many odd and often lurid tales of the island ' s past and present . The social center of the island is the Piazza Umberto , where friends meet in the morning to sip espresso at the open-air cafes and plan the day ' s activities . The beaches are pebbly , but the swimming everywhere is superb , and various secluded spots can be easily reached by boat . By midafternoon the night ' s activities have been set , and when evening comes , excursions are made in groups to favorite restaurants and nightclubs , where the dancing goes_on till dawn . For those who prefer a quieter time , the island provides spectacular natural sites , especially its famous shoreline caves , named mostly for the colors of the water in them . The Grotta Azzurra , or Blue Grotto , is justly celebrated . It ' s well_over 100 yards long , 30 yards high and 15 yards wide , illuminated from an underwater passage below so that the walls reflect in daylight the azure tints of the sea . The best months to visit such wonders ( or to visit the island at all ) are spring and fall , when the masses of summer vacationers are absent . AT THE END OF HIS LIFE , Tiberius made one last attempt to see Rome . He traveled as far as the walls of the capital , but then refused at the last moment to enter the city and -- ignoring his doctor ' s orders -- started back to Capri . Along the way , he stopped at various places along the coast , but was prevented by high_seas from reaching the island itself . He settled instead into a villa at San Felice Circeo that had belonged_to Lucullus , a noted patrician bon_vivant who gave tremendous parties . Tiberius would n ' t admit that he was_sick , but he was clearly dying . Apparently , he wasn ' t doing so quite fast enough for his successor , Caligula , who reportedly helped him on his way either by smothering him in his bed or by cutting_off his food and drink . When at last Tiberius expired , the imperial ring , with the seal he used to sign his terrible decrees , had to be forced from his grasp .
