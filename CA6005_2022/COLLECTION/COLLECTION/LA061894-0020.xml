BUT A JAILHOUSE VISIT BY BASEBALL STAR WILLIE MAYS HELPED THE YOUTH TURN HIS LIFE AROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a youngster growing_up in one of the city ' s toughest neighborhoods , Orenthal James Simpson seemed destined for a life of crime and violence . Raised by his mother in a bleak housing project on Potrero Hill , south of downtown , Simpson spent his teens as the leader of a gang , fighting in the streets and committing petty crimes , such_as stealing slabs of beef from a butcher ' s warehouse . &quot; I was somebody who didn ' t care about anything , &quot; Simpson once told The Times , &quot; and the best thing you can say about me and trouble was that I was borderline. &quot; But the man the world knows as O.J. had two things going_for him : his extraordinary athletic ability and the intervention of San Francisco Giants_star Willie Mays , who once paid him a visit after Simpson spent a weekend in juvenile hall . The boy who wore braces on his legs because of rickets survived the projects to become one of the greatest running backs in pro football . The popular teen-ager , a natural leader in the ghetto , went_on to win fame as a television pitchman and football commentator . On top of his speed and strength , he developed poise and grace , an easy smile and a sense of modesty that helped make him a hero in his hometown and a role_model for youngsters everywhere . In a crushing disappointment to millions of fans , Simpson was charged Friday with murdering his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and waiter Ronald Lyle Goldman outside her Brentwood condo . After promising to turn himself in , Simpson eluded police for hours , then led them on a lengthy pursuit on Southland freeways before finally surrendering at his Brentwood house Friday night . The case has revealed that Simpson had a history of spousal abuse and that police had been called repeatedly after domestic disputes , in which the former football star allegedly struck his ex-wife . But longtime friends and residents of his childhood neighborhood refuse to believe that Simpson could have any connection to the double murder . His fans suggest that he has been framed by some powerful enemy . His friends say it is not in his character to commit such a horrible act . &quot; I ' m having a hard_time seeing O.J. in a ski_mask and gloves hiding in the bushes with a knife , &quot; said Calvin Tennyson , a boyhood friend who has remained close to Simpson . &quot; This is a professional man , someone trained to control his emotions . I can ' t see him flipping out_to the point where he would kill two people and throw his whole life down the drain. &quot; O.J. , who will turn 47 on July 9 , was the third of four children born to Eunice Simpson , a hospital technician , and Jimmy Lee Simpson , a bank custodian . The Simpsons separated when O.J. was 5 and he was raised by his mother , a strong-willed woman who did her best to keep her children in school and out of trouble . &quot; None of us had dads , and things weren ' t easy , &quot; recalled Joe Bell , a childhood friend and high_school football teammate . &quot; But we were all raised by strong mothers who instilled in us a desire and drive to better ourselves. &quot; Many mothers in the projects were_on welfare , but Eunice Simpson worked long hours and frequent night_shifts at San Francisco General Hospital . She and other mothers in the neighborhood helped each other watch_over their children and made_sure they toed_the_line . &quot; If Mrs . Simpson saw me doing something wrong , she ' d slap me quick , &quot; said Bell , who now owns a thrift shop in Richmond . &quot; And if my mother saw O.J. doing something wrong , she ' d slap him . Neighbors looked_after their neighbors ' kids. &quot; When Simpson was inducted into the pro football Hall_of_Fame in 1985 , he praised his mother as &quot; the best mother a guy ever had. &quot; At the same ceremony , Eunice Simpson confessed that she never expected that her son would achieve such fame and glory . &quot; He had always said , ' One of these days you ' re going to read about me , ' &quot; she told the crowd . &quot; And my oldest daughter would always say , ' In the police report. ' &quot; Because he suffered from rickets -- a Vitamin_D and calcium deficiency -- Simpson had to wear leg braces as a small child and was left bowlegged by the disease . Nevertheless , he became a superior athlete as a youth , which conferred upon him a special leadership status in his neighborhood . He and his friends formed a gang named the Persian Warriors -- Simpson called it a &quot; social club &quot; -- and he was its leader . In the book &quot; 60 Years of USC-UCLA Football &quot; by Steve Springer and Michael Arkush , Simpson recounted how he and his fellow Warriors used to steal from factories and warehouses in the industrial district near the Potrero Hill projects . &quot; If you were bored and wanted to make some money , you go ' hit the pie company , ' &quot; Simpson recalled . &quot; Do_it maybe once a month . Either sell the pies or gorge out on them . My favorite was blackberry. &quot; They stole sardines from one company and soft_drinks from delivery_trucks , but stealing slabs of beef was the most difficult , according to the book . &quot; It was a bitch rolling those things down the_hill , &quot; he said , &quot; but there was no way one of those guys ( the butchers ) was going_to chase anyone down into the projects. &quot; Simpson and his friends also formed a social club called the Superiors , a group of the best athletes in the projects . &quot; He had more natural leadership ability than any youngster I know , &quot; recalled Lefty Gordon , a social_group worker at the Booker T . Washington Community_Center who served as an adviser to the Superiors . In an era before guns were readily available , most rival teen-agers didn ' t mess with the Superiors , who were among the biggest and strongest youths in the city . &quot; The circles in which we all traveled in that time were very , very close to the fringe , &quot; recalled Otis McGee Jr. , another childhood friend and fellow Superior who is now a San Francisco attorney . &quot; Many of us made_it , but I can think_of as_many people who I grew_up with who later died or wound_up in prison or became drug-addicted or fell_into some_other trouble. &quot; Simpson acknowledged as much in a 1967 interview : &quot; I could have turned_out bad , &quot; he said . For Simpson , the turning point came when he was picked_up by police at the age of 16 . Simpson once said it might have been for fighting ; friends recall they had stolen beer for a Superior party . In any case , Simpson spent the weekend in juvenile hall . When he was released from custody , he expected to get a beating from his father . Instead , he received a surprise visit from his idol , Willie Mays . The meeting was arranged by social_workers at the Booker T . Washington center , where Mays occasionally helped troubled youngsters . Mays spared O.J. any lectures . Instead , the sports hero took him on a drive , stopping at the dry_cleaners and going_to his house in the posh Forest Hill neighborhood of the city . Simpson soon realized that Mays was a regular person with everyday problems ; at the cleaners , his laundry wasn ' t ready . &quot; I saw that he was human , &quot; Simpson recounted . &quot; A lot of people thought I was good and I realized I could be this guy . I could be Willie Mays . . . . I don ' t think I got_in any real trouble from that point on . I got a little more focused. &quot; Simpson , who had been suspended from school five times , began to pay more attention to his studies and focus more intently on school sports . He played football at Galileo High_School , but the team rarely won , despite his talents . To his disappointment , he did not receive any college scholarships and enrolled at San Francisco City College . He began the season as the third-string tailback , but when the first two runners were injured he got his chance . He broke a variety of city college records , ultimately scoring 26 touchdowns and averaging 9.9 yards a carry . Simpson hoped to go_to USC as a sophomore but was again disappointed when the school rejected him because of his poor grades . He considered enrolling in another four-year university but was persuaded by a USC scout to stay_at city college another season , improve his grades and then come_to Los Angeles . Even then it was clear that Simpson had his sights set_on more_than a football career . He chose USC not just because of its football prowess ; as he once told a San Francisco Chronicle columnist , he wanted to attend &quot; a place where I can learn which fork to use at dinner. &quot; Simpson married a high_school sweetheart , Marguerite Whitley , in 1967 , the same year he started school at USC . In an interview soon afterward , Marguerite described O.J. as a &quot; terrible &quot; person when they first met . Simpson agreed , explaining : &quot; I didn ' t have any goals . I goofed off a lot . . . . I was sort of aimless. &quot; At USC , he became an immediate sensation , ran_for 3 # 295 yards , led the team to a national championship and won the Heisman Trophy . He was the first pick in the 1969 NFL draft , taken by the Buffalo Bills , where he spent most of his career . In 1973 , he became the first man to rush for more_than 2 # 000 yards in a season . O.J. and Marguerite had three children , but their marriage suffered from his celebrity status and time on_the_road . &quot; With Marguerite , as well as Nicole , women just treated him as if he wasn ' t married and climbed all_over him , &quot; Bell said . &quot; He was pursued in hotels , women would send him their panties in the mail , that sort of stuff . You ' ve got_to be a strong woman to deal with that. &quot; He and Marguerite separated during his Buffalo years . In 1978 , he returned to his hometown to play_out his career as a 49er . In 1979 , his final year in pro football , he and Marguerite divorced . Soon after the divorce , tragedy struck when their youngest child , 23-month-old Aaren Simpson , drowned in a swimming_pool . After his football career , Simpson worked as an NFL commentator , including on &quot; ABC Monday Night Football. &quot; He also has been in more_than a dozen movies , recently completing a TV pilot called &quot; Frogman. &quot; Success did not change Simpson , his oldest friends said , and he was generous with his wealth . He contributed thousands of dollars to the Potrero Hill Recreation Center , where he once played basketball , and to athletics programs at Galileo High_School . He also returned occasionally to visit his old neighborhoods , even filming an orange_juice commercial on Potrero Hill with kids from the projects . After he turned pro , the Simpsons bought their first place , a fancy $ 150 # 000 house with a swimming_pool in Los Angeles ; he flew his buddies down for a week ' s vacation , wining_and_dining them and driving them around town in his Corvette , recalled Tennyson , who now works in the laundry at San Francisco General Hospital . Other times , Tennyson said , he would get a phone_call out_of_the_blue from Simpson , telling him there were two tickets to Los Angeles waiting for him at the San Francisco airport . &quot; He didn ' t forget us . Even with all that money , he remained the same old O.J. we always knew , &quot; Tennyson said . Referring to reports that Simpson battered his second wife , Nicole , during their seven-year marriage , Tennyson said such conduct should not prompt the public to judge the former football star harshly . &quot; You put a man and a woman in the same house , day in and day out , and from time to time somebody gets slapped , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t think that made O.J. outstanding in America . It ' s not exactly an uncommon thing. &quot; In his old neighborhood , youths still look_up_to him as a role_model and proof that it is possible to escape the projects . The charges against him were met this week with skepticism . &quot; We always wanted to be a great star like him , not see him go_up in smoke , &quot; said 15-year-old Andrew Tanner , during a break_in a basketball_game at the Potrero Hill Recreation Center , where Simpson ' s picture is displayed . &quot; I really don ' t think he did it. &quot; Times staff writer Steve Springer contributed to this report .</TEXT>
