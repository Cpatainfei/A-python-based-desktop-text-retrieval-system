   <HEADLINE> WILL CHRISTMAS PRESENCE COUNT AT OSCAR TIME ? ; MOVIES : RELEASING A FILM AT YEAR ' S END TO QUALIFY FOR THE ACADEMY AWARDS SOMETIMES PAYS OFF BIG -- REMEMBER ' DRIVING MISS DAISY ' ? -- BUT IT CAN ALSO PROVE COSTLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Call it the Christmas rush of Oscar hopefuls . Every year , the Hollywood studios and independent film companies pop certain movies into theaters a week or two before the end of the year so they can qualify for Academy Award consideration . Usually they appear in select major markets , namely Los Angeles and New York . Sometimes runs in Toronto , Chicago and San Francisco are included . After the mandatory seven-day qualification run , some films are plucked from the screens and re-released in late January or early February . Others cling on , trying to grab for more screens , vying fitfully for audience attention against the crowded season ' s big competitors . Regardless of the strategy , last-minute Oscar qualifiers are a costly marketing maneuver -- in more ways than one . A one- or two-week Oscar push is expensive , says Samuel Goldwyn Co . President Meyer Gottlieb . &quot; And you ' re not fooling anybody if you ' re trying to sell sizzle where it doesn ' t exist. &quot; * Simply put , an early release in limited markets can trigger critical_reviews . Lower-budget art fare , in particular , needs positive reviews and strong word_of_mouth to build momentum for more playing time in theaters . Negative reviews can sink a film early , since word of a clinker spreads quickly through the national press . And stench on a picture can often kill its chances of opening in small_towns months later , marketing and distribution executives say . Still , it ' s a gamble plenty are willing to take . This year , there is a plethora of such offerings : TriStar ' s &quot; Legends of the Fall , &quot; Columbia ' s &quot; Little Women &quot; and &quot; Immortal Beloved , &quot; Fine Line Features ' &quot; Mrs . Parker and the Vicious_Circle &quot; and &quot; Death and the Maiden , &quot; Miramax ' s &quot; Tom &amp; Viv &quot; and &quot; Camilla , &quot; 20th Century Fox ' s &quot; Nell , &quot; Goldwyn ' s &quot; The Madness of King George , &quot; New Line ' s &quot; Safe Passage &quot; and Paramount ' s &quot; Nobody ' s Fool. &quot; Miramax ' s ads are already touting the nods from the Golden Globes and National Board of Review for Miranda Richardson as best actress for &quot; Tom &amp; Viv. &quot; The board nominated Rosemary Harris for best supporting actress as well . That film , which opened in New York and L.A. Dec . 2 , was pulled_back after a two-week run in New York . It is still playing in L.A. Miramax ' s other contender &quot; Camilla , &quot; released in L.A. and New York Dec . 16 , was pulled Thursday . Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein says that his reason for pulling films back and re-releasing them in mid-January is clear-cut . He doesn ' t want his &quot; sophisticated &quot; product getting lost in the traffic of some 20-plus films_over the next few weeks . &quot; Look_at all_the movies out there now . Twenty of them are going_to be lousy anyway and many will disappear next month , &quot; says Weinstein . &quot; Our purpose is to get ( Oscar ) nominations . &quot; For us , this has always worked . It worked with ( 1990 ' s ) ' The Grifters , ' which we played for a week in L.A. and New York , pulled it and then brought it back in January , &quot; he explains . &quot; We got five Academy Award nominations . That gave the film such momentum . ( 1992 ' s ) ' Passion Fish ' was another . We had it out for a week , but we felt it did so well , we decided to let it run through. &quot; * But the pull-back strategy doesn ' t always work . Remember 1991 ' s &quot; Kafka &quot; ? Most don ' t , Weinstein admits . &quot; We opened that film for a one-week Oscar qualifier , pulled it and nobody cared. &quot; Duds can sucker punch the studios too . Warner Bros. , which used the one-week Oscar-qualifier strategy with blitzkrieg success for 1989 ' s &quot; Driving Miss Daisy &quot; ( a film that eventually grabbed four Oscars including best picture ) , saw its genius backfire with Bernardo Bertolucci ' s &quot; The Sheltering Sky &quot; the following year . &quot; I opened ' Sheltering Sky ' the same way as ' Miss Daisy ' but it got terrible reviews , &quot; says Barry Reardon , Warners ' president of distribution . &quot; I remember we opened it Dec . 12 , 1990 , in L.A. , New York and Toronto , because a lot of academy members live there . I spread it the first week of January but I was dead in the water . It played about two weeks . ' The Saint of Fort Washington ' was another terrific film that just didn ' t work. &quot; So , says Reardon , &quot; if you open the movie and you don ' t get the reviews you need , you ' re dead . It ' s that simple. &quot; The cost of early hype can be a killer on several fronts . &quot; Consider that the costs promoting a typical Miramax picture run anywhere from $ 150 # 000 to $ 250 # 000 in newspaper and TV ads , &quot; he says . &quot; For a studio , early release on a big film with maybe 600 prints could run $ 2.5-to- $ 3 million . If you pull a picture back and put it out again , you ' re looking_at repeating those costs. &quot; Putting aside that expense for a minute , Reardon suggests , &quot; you ' re still caught in an enormous trap. &quot; That being , &quot; If you did an early release in limited markets and got lukewarm reviews , you ' ve got the filmmaker and producer on your ass for rushing it out there in the first place. &quot; But when the strategy does_work , the results can be sweet indeed . &quot; ' Miss Daisy ' has become the textbook case of last-minute Oscar qualifiers , &quot; notes Reardon . &quot; I opened that picture in Toronto , L.A. and New York on Dec . 13 , 1989 . My plan was to follow the ( critics ' ) best lists , the Golden Globes , all_the way to the Oscar nominations ( in February ) . Every time one of those things came_up , I added more theaters . It was probably the best thing I ever did as far as the release of the movie and it ' s been imitated many times sense . Remember a little movie called ' Fried Green Tomatoes ' ? &quot; Fox is banking on similar results for &quot; Nell. &quot; Hoping to snare a best actress Oscar nomination for Jodie Foster , the studio opened the picture in L.A. and New York Dec . 14 and by Friday it was in 10 theaters . On Sunday , the movie , which picked_up three Golden Globe nominations including best picture , will be in 835 theaters . Paramount too is shooting_for a windfall with a best actor Oscar plug for Paul Newman in &quot; Nobody ' s Fool , &quot; which bows Sunday in New York and L.A. Newman also picked_up a best actor Golden Globe nomination . Paramount marketing / distribution head Barry London plans to widen the movie to about 800 theaters on Jan . 13 . He doesn ' t fear a ghost from Christmas past : &quot; We did this last year with ' What ' s Eating Gilbert Grape ? ' We got an Oscar nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio but the public just didn ' t respond as we had hoped. &quot; * As for the other studios , Columbia and its sister company TriStar have three last-minute contenders between them . Columbia ' s &quot; Immortal Beloved , &quot; with Gary Oldman playing the frenzied genius composer Ludwig van_Beethoven , opened Dec . 16 in four cities with plans to go wider Jan . 6 and Jan . 27 . The other Columbia hopeful is &quot; Little Women , &quot; based on the Louisa May Alcott classic , which opens wide Sunday . TriStar ' s &quot; Legends of the Fall , &quot; which the studio anticipates could carry Brad Pitt over the top as a major box-office star , opens in six theaters in New York and L.A. Sunday and spreads wide Jan . 13 . The movie was a surprise Globe contender with four nods , including best picture . Gerry Rich , head of worldwide marketing at MGM / UA , who formerly worked_at Miramax , is a veteran at knowing when the process works and when it doesn ' t . &quot; It really helps the independents ' underdog films. &quot; Like others , Rich says that when the accolades don ' t roll in and the film is pulled , then re-released later , there ' s often &quot; a feeling with exhibitors that the picture is tainted goods. &quot; He says , &quot; They may be hesitant about running it in the future . So it ' s impossible to relaunch without adequate fanfare. &quot; And &quot; if you , say , had two movies you were going_to relaunch , you could easily end_up spending $ 800 # 000 total and that still may_not work. &quot; Relaunching is the last thing Fine Line , New Line and Goldwyn are considering . All have last-minute Oscar qualifiers they plan to let run_through and fan_out into wider release over time . Goldwyn will release &quot; The Madness of King George &quot; in L.A. and New York Wednesday and by mid-January will show it in 10 markets . More cities will be added Feb . 17 . &quot; We don ' t think it ' s an effective marketing strategy to pull a picture once it ' s out there and re-release it months later . You confuse people , &quot; Gottlieb says . In fact , Fine Line President Ira Deutchman says he thinks Miramax is the only player who still follows the old rules . ( Fine Line ' s &quot; Mrs . Parker &quot; opened Nov . 23 in New York and Wednesday in L.A. , while &quot; Death and the Maiden &quot; hit select theaters in those cities Friday. ) &quot; Everyone used to take Miramax ' s approach , &quot; Deutchman say . &quot; But start-up advertising costs are so high . that ' s the point of launching at the end of the year -- to generate heat and keep it fresh in people ' s minds. &quot; Besides , he adds , &quot; you want to be at your widest release , if by chance , some lucky chance , you win the big one next year. &quot; Movie Reviews Online * For LA Times reviews on all_the major movies still playing in Southern California , check the new TimesLink online service .
