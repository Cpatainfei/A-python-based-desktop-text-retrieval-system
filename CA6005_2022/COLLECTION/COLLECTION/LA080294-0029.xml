   <TEXT> Lonnie Bunch , project director of the Smithsonian ' s most ambitious exhibit ever -- American Festival Japan ' 94 -- had had enough . For days , he had argued that Japan ' s first comprehensive display of U.S. history and culture should stress America ' s racial diversity . For days , however , the Japanese side had resisted . &quot; The Japanese just won ' t understand , &quot; Bunch , who is an African American , says he was told by his counterparts . So he launched into what he calls his &quot; Martin_Luther_King meets William Jennings Bryan &quot; speech , a thundering oration on how America had grown and changed by grappling with conflict . He roared that the concept was critical to fathoming the American national soul . He leaped to his feet . He shook his fist . He pounded the table . An exquisite performance -- or so he thought . But from the Japanese side of the table , there was dead silence . Shock , perhaps , from a_people accustomed to self-restraint . Finally , someone spoke , puzzled and concerned : &quot; Dr. Bunch , are you feeling sick today ? &quot; As Bunch tells it , it was one of the more memorable cultural snafus of the three-year project sponsored by the Smithsonian , Japan ' s NHK television network and the nation ' s largest daily newspaper , the Yomiuri Shimbun . But it reflected how those who staged the Smithsonian ' s biggest attempt to bridge a cultural divide had to overcome perception gaps themselves -- including differences in defining America . Ending Aug . 31 , the mammoth undertaking , an eight-week festival in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba , cost $ 41 million and covers 200 # 000 square_feet . About half is devoted to the Smithsonian ' s exhibit , a panoramic introduction to America ' s land , people , history and culture . In addition to sending extensive photos and videos , the museum shipped more_than 400 priceless artifacts -- many shown outside the United States for the first time . They include the Wright Brothers ' 1911 Vin Fiz airplane , the Apollo 14 space module , Thomas_Edison ' s first_light bulb , George_Washington ' s mess_kit and the original gifts exchanged when Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Edo Bay with his black warships to open Japan to the United States in 1853 . The other half was organized mainly by NHK and the Yomiuri and is more playful : a NASA &quot; orbitron &quot; to simulate space_travel , a basketball_court in the NBA Hall_of_Fame and concessions selling everything from hotdogs to baseball_caps . From the very start , the two sides had to sort_out differences in vision , execution and even the basic motivation for staging such an ambitious project . The Japanese sponsors say they wanted to better bilateral relations and revitalize America ' s image , deteriorating into that of a land ridden with crime , racial conflict and economic decline . Their initial thought was to remind people of America ' s great scientific inventions and technological grandeur , its frontier spirit and creative popular culture . High on their wish list were treasures that would convey this -- and draw_in the crowds -- such_as U.S. spacecraft . &quot; Japanese people , especially young people , think they know everything about America and some people think we have nothing left to learn from the U.S. , &quot; says Mayumi Harada , a Yomiuri spokeswoman . &quot; We wanted to deter this arrogance. &quot; But the Smithsonian official they approached was not inclined to paint only rosy pictures . Bunch -- former senior curator of the California Afro-American Museum in Los Angeles -- initially turned the Japanese down flat . &quot; I wasn ' t interested in doing a show that just says , ' Look_at these beautiful pieces , ' &quot; he says , as he escorts a visitor through the exhibit . &quot; I wanted to tell a story . I felt strongly that if the Smithsonian was going_to do this , we had to challenge and expand the Japanese notions of America. &quot; Bunch ' s idea : to present a vision of how America was transformed , enriched and strengthened by racial and cultural diversity -- including the political protests and ethnic tension that engendered change . &quot; We wanted to say that America is great , but one reason is because we have struggled with issues of race , and that has enlarged our ideas about citizenship , liberty and notions of fairness , &quot; Bunch says . Such a vision meant the show had to include mementos of not only America ' s ideals , but of their failure , such_as a Ku Klux Klan robe . It meant dealing with slavery and highlighting the civil_rights movement with a video of Martin_Luther_King Jr. ' s &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech . Bunch says the Japanese negotiators initially resisted the proposal , but the video has turned_out to be one of the more powerful attractions . Bunch ' s vision also meant enlivening the Japanese-requested icons -- the Statue_of_Liberty , the Stars and Stripes and Mt . Rushmore -- with a video of Ray Charles singing &quot; America the Beautiful &quot; and scenes of Americans in all shapes , sizes and colors . He added a section on women pilots and black pilots next to the Wright Brothers airplane . He began the Western frontier section with a giant photo of an Anasazi cliff dwelling in New Mexico . His aim , he says , was to go beyond the stereotypical images of America and show the nation ' s complexity . But the two sides did not always see_eye_to_eye . &quot; At one meeting , I was told that all I ever wanted was shadows and they wanted light , &quot; he says . The perception gap came_to a head -- Bunch calls it &quot; a wonderful moment &quot; -- when a Japanese negotiator pulled him aside and said , &quot; You ' re African American . You ' ve been discriminated against . You ' re critical of America and you ' re angry . We understand that , but we just don ' t want it to dominate the exhibition. &quot; that ' s when Bunch launched into another passionate speech he says surprised even himself , on why his criticism of America was not an expression of anger but an &quot; act of love &quot; to continue improving his cherished nation . For their part , the Yomiuri representatives downplayed the differences and said they knew_nothing of the incidents Bunch related . &quot; It ' s not that we thought the show was too gloomy , but we thought maybe it was too serious , too scholarly , &quot; said spokesman Masato Kikuchi . &quot; If it ' s no fun , people won ' t come. &quot; As a result , the NHK-Yomiuri team added the second element to the show -- &quot; Enjoying America &quot; -- featuring the sports displays , concession stands and American homes . They also added brought Americans from various regions to talk_about their hometowns with Japanese audiences . In the end , Bunch ' s vision prevailed because the Smithsonian contractually controlled the show ' s content . But he remains unsure whether his message got_across . Can a nation with only tiny minority groups truly understand America ' s racial dynamics ? Is it possible to appreciate a national value that holds that debating problems helps solve them when a Japanese proverb advises : &quot; Put a lid on smelly things &quot; ? &quot; It tested all my years as a museum curator and scholar of history , &quot; Bunch says , &quot; but you ' re never sure whether they ' re going to get it. &quot; Judging from the crowd ' s reaction , many did . The reactions were as diverse as America itself . Aki Tachikawa , 22 , was mesmerized by King ' s speech and said she wished Japan produced such visionaries . &quot; I know America has problems with social issues . . . but everyone is trying to search for something and that ' s wonderful. &quot; Sadao Kishino , 58 , was impressed by the forthright manner in which the exhibit presented the nation ' s legacy of racism . &quot; If it were Japan , the negative aspects would never have been shown , because Japanese want to be_well thought of. &quot; But Nobumasa Kawamura , 22 , said the exhibit covered_up America ' s flaws . &quot; They should have shown more on the suppression of Native_Americans , or the Vietnam_War , &quot; he said . &quot; America is a sick country. &quot; Biography Name : Lonnie Bunch Title : Assistant Director for Curatorial Affairs , National Museum of American History .
