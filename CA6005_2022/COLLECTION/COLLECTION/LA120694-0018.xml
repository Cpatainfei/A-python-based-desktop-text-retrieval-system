   <HEADLINE> EMBRYO RESEARCH : MUDDY POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s veer to the right since the election is understandable . But his hasty action late Friday to forbid government-backed research on human embryos created in the laboratory is troubling -- not just because he has blocked potentially valuable research but because of what it reveals about policy-making chaos at the White_House . Soon after his inauguration in 1993 , Clinton reversed the ban on fetal-tissue research . Later he signed legislation to open research on embryos . A panel of 19 leading doctors , lawyers and ethicists labored for nearly a year to write research rules , and an advisory committee of the director of the National Institutes of Health approved them Friday . Then , without informing even the NIH director , Clinton torpedoed most of the work . While banning creation of embryos solely for research , Clinton left open limited experimentation on &quot; spare &quot; embryos derived from couples in fertility programs . Citing possible gains in treating infertility , birth_defects , genetic defects and cancer , the NIH panel had urged research in which artificially fertilized human-egg cells would be studied for up_to two weeks , before first signs of a nervous_system , and then destroyed . Such cell masses , it said , did not have the &quot; same moral status &quot; as infants . Realizing it was venturing into choppy moral waters , stirring public fears of bizarre Frankenstein-like tinkering , the panel rejected more daring procedures , such_as cloning of embryos and transfer of human embryos into animals . Still the proposal met stiff opposition . In a letter written by Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) , 35 members of Congress complained of &quot; bizarre experiments &quot; that involved the &quot; destruction of human beings. &quot; One does not have to accept this definition of the start of human life to have qualms about this research . Even several members of the NIH panel , despite surface unanimity , had private doubts , given the unimpressive results of previous embryo research and the failure yet to persuade the public that this research was valuable . Undoubtedly all this influenced Clinton ' s action , as well as concerns that the new Republican majority could use the issue to cut other parts of the federal biomedical research budget . But Clinton ' s ham-handed reaction suggests he is more concerned about reelection than making sound science policy .</TEXT>
