   <HEADLINE> FUZZY FUNGUS OUT ON FOREST SURVIVAL LIMB WITH SPOTTED OWL ; ECOLOGY : TO CHAMPIONS OF ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT , THE FURRY SANDOZE IN THE NORTHWEST IS AN IMPORTANT STRAND IN THE WEB OF LIFE , DESERVING OF PROTECTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forget spotted owls . To see where the debate over saving America ' s wildlife is heading , spend a day in the woods with ecologist David Shaw . Drive with him deep into the Olympic National Forest , hike through a grove of ancient firs , totter the length of a mossy log , and peer , finally , around the base of a dead tree to behold . . . the fuzzy sandoze . It ' s a fungus . A very odd fungus , with a fruiting body that ' s furry like a bear and sometimes as big , weighing up_to 300 pounds . A very rare fungus , known from only six sites around the Northwest . And a very intriguing fungus , at least to scientists like Shaw . &quot; We don ' t know its life_history , &quot; Shaw said , kneeling by the half-grown specimen he found in 1992 . &quot; We don ' t know if it attacks live roots or strictly dead wood . We don ' t know much about this fungus. &quot; All of which makes this fungus an ideal poster child in the campaign for ecosystem management , the latest theater in the war over imperiled wildlife . The fuzzy sandoze , one of dozens of cryptic creatures protected under a new federal plan to manage Pacific Northwest forest lands , is not particularly cute . You can ' t eat it . You can ' t build anything with it . But to champions of ecosystem management , the fuzzy sandoze is an important strand in the web of life , deserving of protection . Where land management traditionally starts with a narrow goal -- cutting timber , say , or saving a particular wildlife species -- ecosystem management takes a broader view . The goal is a sustainable ecosystem , and any human_activity is supposed to leave enough of the landscape intact to ensure the survival of all wildlife . The idea isn ' t new . But putting it into practice can be devilishly complicated , and there has never been a large-scale attempt to make_it work -- until now . Hoping to end a three-year deadlock between wildlife protection and timber production , the Clinton_Administration in April proposed a plan embracing ecosystem management across 24 million acres of federal forest land in Washington , Oregon and California . A federal judge in Seattle must approve the plan for it to go_into effect . He is to hear oral arguments Sept . 12 . What began as an effort to save a single species , the northern spotted owl , has evolved into a plan offering sanctuary to an ark full of creatures : salmon , sea_birds , slugs , snails and , yes , the fuzzy sandoze . * Environmentalists view the Northwest experiment as a step toward more holistic wildlife conservation , an improvement over the species-by-species approach fostered by the Endangered Species Act , which is up for reauthorization by Congress . But those who defend the use of natural_resources see something more ominous -- a government using analysis to create paralysis , enlisting ever more obscure organisms to prevent humans from carving out their own ecological niche . In some ways , then , the forest plan resembles the forest itself -- so big , so complex , that what you see depends_on what you look_for . David Shaw is standing now , gazing up at 500-year-old firs and hemlocks . &quot; A logger looks_at this and sees work , &quot; he said . &quot; I see a rich biotic environment. &quot; For years , his view didn ' t count for much in a region where getting big logs_out of the woods was the paramount concern . Then , in 1991 , U.S. District Judge William Dwyer in Seattle granted a request by environmentalists to temporarily ban logging across much of the Northwest ' s national forest lands . Dwyer said the government had violated its own laws by not assessing logging ' s effect on the spotted owl , listed in 1990 as threatened under the Endangered Species Act . In 1992 , when federal_officials presented their spotted-owl plan , Dwyer rejected it , saying it did not meet National Forest Management Act requirements that viable populations of all wildlife be maintained . Dwyer lifted the ban in June , in response to the government ' s new forest proposal . But the judge said his action did not indicate how he would rule on the forest plan . The result : These are busy times for scientists like Shaw . They roam the forest in_force , counting owls and other creatures . They sit at computers , using satellite imagery and multilayered , digitized maps to chart ecological connections . The government ' s scientific team studied how 10 logging scenarios would affect each of more_than 1 # 100 species , from grizzly_bears to lichens . It was the most comprehensive study of its kind ever done . But Shaw says it barely scratched the surface of the forest ecosystem , where the bulk of biodiversity is made_up of tiny , poorly understood organisms . A cubic_yard of forest soil may harbor 200 # 000 mites and tens of thousands of beetles , centipedes , springtails and spiders . High in the canopy , one spruce needle can support a world of fungi , lichen , insects and bacteria . Shaw ' s curiosity extends_to both ends of trees . He got his doctorate in forest pathology , specializing in root_rots . Now he ' s leading a federally funded project to erect a 285-foot crane that will give researchers a bird ' s-eye view of the old-growth canopy . He stumbled across the fuzzy sandoze while scouting sites for the crane . It was an exciting moment , he says , and not just because of the novelty of the fungus . &quot; The fuzzy sandoze is important because it ' s part of the process , not just because it ' s unusual or rare , &quot; Shaw said . &quot; There ' s work being carried_out by ecosystems , and all_the pieces are important. &quot; * Late on a Friday afternoon in Portland , Ore. , when most people were making tracks out of the city , Tom Tuchmann was in his office , pursuing the sticky business of turning science into public policy . &quot; People want more timber , more recreation , more biological diversity , &quot; Tuchmann said . &quot; At some point , we have to recognize that we have a limited land base , and then start making decisions about how much of each we want. &quot; Tuchmann , head of the Northwest office implementing the government ' s new forest plan , knows how unpopular those decisions can be . He must tell unemployed loggers that the region ' s annual timber harvest will drop to one-fourth of its average during the 1980s . Then he must face lawsuit-prone conservationists and try to convince them it ' s enough to protect 80 % of the remaining old-growth , not 100 % . What Tuchmann sees in ecosystem management is a way to untie the knot of environmental laws and recent court rulings involving the old-growth forest . Protect habitat , he says , and you protect wildlife -- including species that may be listed as endangered in years ahead . &quot; We ' re trying to get_ahead of the Endangered Species Act , &quot; he said . &quot; We feel that over time , we will have enough habitat to protect old-growth-related species. &quot; Environmental groups say the government ' s plan points in the right direction but does not go_far enough . They ' re already drawing_up new legal challenges . The plan ' s net effect can be put simply -- more federal land for wildlife and less for loggers . Thirty-six percent of the 24-million-acre planning area is already preserved as national_park , wilderness or administratively withdrawn areas . The plan puts an additional 31 % into old-growth reserves , and 11 % into riparian reserves that will protect every river and stream with a forested buffer up_to 600 feet wide . Even in the 22 % open_to logging , the region ' s familiar checkerboard of forested and clear-cut squares will give_way to a more careful landscape . Loggers will have to leave 15 % of the trees in every watershed they cut . Dozens of rare plants and animals will get special protection wherever they ' re found -- 100 acres around spotted-owl nests , 1.5 acres around the roosts of certain bats . The fuzzy sandoze will fare especially well . Each specimen will get a 600-acre reserve until its needs are_better known . Bat buffers ? Fungus reserves ? It ' s the kind of talk that pushes Myron Ebell ' s buttons . He works for the American Land Rights Assn. , which represents private landowners and users of public lands . Ebell says the forest plan is part of a &quot; criminal conspiracy &quot; to cripple the Northwest timber industry in the name of wildlife protection . &quot; If they ' re able to move ahead , we ' re going to see similar economic dislocations around the country , &quot; he said . Ecosystem management , by his definition , is a meaningless abstraction invoked by bureaucrats who want to exercise national land-use controls but lack the authority to do_it . Ebell says the current concern over endangered species is overwrought . &quot; Nature ' s not fragile at all , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s an incredibly resilient thing . There are people who say any loss of genetic variety is a disaster , not admitting that any gaps are quickly filled by new species. &quot; But environmentalists , noting threats such_as global warning , say humans have made a risky habit of modifying the environment in ignorance . They say that to ensure we ' re not the gap filled by new species , more intelligent tinkering is needed . &quot; We are mere mortals trying to play God , &quot; said Jim Pissot , Washington state representative of the National Audubon Society . &quot; And we need a little more data to do that. &quot;</TEXT>
