   <HEADLINE> HOT DOGS LINKED TO HIGHER RISK OF CANCERS IN CHILDREN ; DIET : BUT SOME SCOFF AT THE STUDY SHOWING THAT MORE THAN 12 WIENERS A MONTH INCREASES CHANCES OF LEUKEMIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Children who eat more_than 12 hot dogs per month have nine times the normal risk of developing childhood leukemia , a USC epidemiologist has reported in a cancer research journal . Two other reports in the same issue of Cancer Causes and Control suggest that children born to mothers who eat_at least one hot dog per week during pregnancy have double the normal risk of developing brain_tumors , as do children whose fathers ate hot dogs before conception . The recent findings , which are generating a great_deal of controversy and concern , could help explain why the incidence of childhood leukemia and brain_tumors has been increasing over the last two decades , say the researchers , led by USC epidemiologist John Peters . The scientists caution that the studies are preliminary and based on relatively small numbers of cases -- a total of 621 cancer victims in the three studies and an equal number of controls . They also note that the statistical association is not necessarily a cause-and-effect relationship . Critics , as well as the researchers themselves , point_out that such studies are difficult to conduct and interpret because people have a hard_time recalling what they have eaten . Nonetheless , the scientists argue that the results are significant and the issue deserves much more intensive scrutiny . In response to the findings , researchers at the University of Minnesota have modified their National Cancer Institute-sponsored study on childhood leukemia to explore the possible connection to hot dogs . The researchers suggest that the trigger for the cancers might be the nitrites used to preserve processed meats such_as hot dogs . Nitrites are converted in the body to highly carcinogenic nitrosamines . Still , none of the investigators argue that people should stop eating hot dogs based on the findings . Because of the low incidence of these childhood tumors , &quot; this is not a hazard at the level of tobacco smoke or high-fat diets , &quot; said epidemiologist David Savitz of the University of North Carolina , author of one of the studies on pregnant women . &quot; The rational response would be a small modification of your consumption. &quot; &quot; It ' s an intriguing idea because hot dogs certainly contain chemicals that one might wonder about , &quot; said Dr. Clark Heath , vice_president for medical research of the American Cancer Society . &quot; I don ' t think they prove the case , &quot; he said , but the results are feasible because animal studies have established that nitrites cause cancer . &quot; Obviously , it is an idea that will need to be explored further. &quot; Researchers from the hot dog and cured meat industries were not available for comment Thursday . A spokeswoman for the National Cancer Institute could not provide anyone familiar_with the findings . Other researchers scoffed at the findings as an example of the &quot; carcinogen of the week &quot; syndrome . &quot; The problem is that there are an enormous number of variables in a study like this , &quot; said nutrition expert Michael Pariza of the University of Wisconsin . &quot; You don ' t know whether they were undernourished , for example , or if they had adequate exercise . . . . It would be extremely premature to draw any conclusion from this type of study. &quot; Other researchers also attacked the studies because they were published in a journal that is not peer-reviewed , meaning that experts did not have a chance to critique the results before they appeared in print . Leukemia and brain_tumors have been a concern to pediatric oncologists because they have been increasing more_than twice as fast as childhood cancer overall . In the 17 years that such data has been collected , Heath said , cancer among children up_to age 14 has increased by an average of 0.8 % per year , while acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia has increased 1.7 % per year -- a 27.4 % total over that period . Brain_tumors have increased 1.8 % per year over the same period , a 32.8 % total . The cause of the increases has been a mystery . Even so , the cancers are still considered very rare . Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia strikes only about three in every 10 # 000 children , so even a ninefold increase still amounts to a relatively small risk . The researchers said they did not set_out to indict hot dogs . Peters and Savitz have been key players in the studies examining the link between electromagnetic fields ( EMFs ) and childhood tumors . As part of those studies , they decided to explore other potential causes . &quot; Our idea was to test as_many hypotheses about possible causes as we could think_of , &quot; Peters said . The finding about hot dogs &quot; was a real surprise , &quot; he added . &quot; It was the biggest risk for anything we saw in the study -- about four times the risk for EMFs. &quot; Peters and his colleagues identified 232 children under age 10 in the Los Angeles area who developed leukemia between 1980 and 1987 and a comparable number of matched children who did not develop it . The parents answered extensive questions about lifestyle , parental occupations , exposure to potential carcinogens and diet for the children and themselves . In particular , they were questioned about consumption of cured meats , including hot dogs , bologna , bacon , sausage and ham -- all_of which contain nitrites -- as well as charcoal-broiled meats , which contain other carcinogens . They found no link to any food other_than hot dogs . In addition to the findings for the children , Peters found that the risk of leukemia in children whose fathers consumed hot dogs regularly before the children were conceived was 11 times normal . He did not distinguish among various types of hot dogs because all contain nitrites . Savitz and Greta R . Bunin of Children ' s Hospital in Philadelphia performed similar studies among children with leukemia and brain_tumors . Savitz studied 234 cancer cases and 234 controls in Denver ; Bunin studied 155 cancer cases and 155 controls in Philadelphia . Both found about twice the normal risk of brain_tumors among children whose mothers consumed hot dogs weekly during pregnancy . Savitz also found a doubled risk of leukemia among children who ate_at least one grilled hamburger per week and a doubled risk of brain cancer among those who ate_at least one hot dog per week . All the researchers found that the greatest risk was among children who did not take vitamins -- implying that vitamins may have some type of protective effect . Although the researchers suspect nitrites in the cured meats , they agree that it could be something else as well -- perhaps the high fat content of hot dogs , bacteria or some_other chemical in them . Or it could be that a high hot dog intake &quot; is simply a marker for a very bad diet , &quot; Bunin said . The fact that the studies were not designed with hot dogs as a primary concern means that there are many unanswered questions , Savitz said . &quot; This was not by modern standards a sophisticated study of diet and cancer . We know how to do_better , but hot dogs just weren ' t a prominent enough issue to devote extensive parts of the questionnaire to them. &quot; But , he concluded , &quot; now they are. &quot;</TEXT>
