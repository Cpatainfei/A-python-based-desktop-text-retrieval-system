   <HEADLINE> TRENDS ; IT ' S NOT ALWAYS CRYSTAL-CLEAR , BUT GLASS MAKES THE CUT IN DESIGN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In simple accents and detailed crafting , in ways as diverse as light-refracting bevels and etched wildlife images , decorative glasswork is increasinglybeing used as a design element in the home . There are scores of ways to glorify glass ; it can be leaded , beveled , painted , enameled , antiqued , embossed . Many of these techniques remain unchanged since Medieval times , though the glass itself is appearing in new and modern designs . &quot; Really , what makes the difference in glass , lifting it from something purely utilitarian to an art_form , is the skill which the craftsman brings_to the glasswork project , &quot; said Tom Henry , a glass craftsman of 24 years , who owns and operates Master ' s Glass_in Costa Mesa . &quot; You can have a piece of antique glass from Europe for $ 5 to $ 10 a square_foot , or you can have a beveled , leaded , diamond-cut huge window or set of doors for $ 10 # 000 . Both are lovely and give beauty to an environment ; one just requires a lot more time and skill and craftsmanship . But anyone can enjoy glass_in their home. &quot; Decorative glass can be introduced in ways as simple as replacing the standard glass_in a curio cabinet with antique glass or hanging a piece of stained glass_in a window . Still , most people consider decorative glasswork a luxury , according to Tom Lloyd , owner of Bevelled Glass and Mirror in Newport Beach . &quot; I ' ve been in the business since 1976 , and you can see the curve go_up and down with the economy , &quot; he said . &quot; But I also think people are seeing the art_form in glasswork and are willing to pay what a craftsman needs to do the job right. &quot; The glasswork that Lloyd and Henry are talking_about is meant to add lasting beauty to a home . &quot; It ' s like a beautiful coat one will wear for decades -- you ' ll be willing to pay a ( higher ) price for it , &quot; Henry said . In doors , cabinets , windows and furnishings , the pieces are able to introduce detail that can transform the ordinary into the extraordinary . A decorative piece of glass_in a door or an entryway , for instance , can help set a tone for an entire home . Decorative glass can be purchased ready-made or custom-designed . Ready-made beveled and leaded glass doors for the entryway in one Orange County home were purchased from a glass and mirror retail company for about $ 1 # 600 for the pair . The doors were crafted in Latin_America , the glasswork beveled and leaded in Taiwan , and the pieces put_together by a Compton company . On the other hand , a pair of custom doors in leaded and beveled glass with complex etching at another home were worked_on by a local glass artist for three months before they could be set_in their teak frames . The cost was $ 20 # 000 . Choices in decorative glass range from utilitarian frosted glass to unorthodox free-form compositions . There are three main elements in decorative glass : * How the glass is made . Variations include hand blown or machine rolled , clear or colored , textured or plain . * What is done to it . Decorative processes include etching , cameo cutting , engraving , painting and enameling . * How it is put_together . Assembly processes include connecting pieces with leading , copper foil or zinc . Knowing some of the terminology of glass can help consumers considering adding glass detail to their homes to know what their options are . Glass Types Here are some basic kinds of glass : Sheet glass . Generic plate_glass from one-sixteenth of an inch to one inch thick . It is priced according to thickness , from $ 1.25 to $ 20 per square_foot . Antique glass . Hand-blown or machine re-creation and elaboration of the nuances in genuine antique glass . Bubbles , variations , striations and what some might term &quot; defects &quot; are deliberately included in the process . From $ 2.50 to $ 12 per square_foot , depending_on process . Opalescent glass . Color is mixed into the glass as it is created , then poured and rolled into sheets . This is the style of glass used in Tiffany lamps . From $ 2.50 to $ 10 or more per square_foot . Dalle-de-verre glass . Blocks or chips of glass cast in a resin to create an abstract form used in contemporary designs , particularly windows . Fern glass . A special glue is applied either in a design or all_over the surface of glass that has been sandblasted . The glue pulls the glass off in shapes of ferns , shells , etc . Double fern glass is a repetition of the process that gives the glass a double-chipped texture . Runs from $ 3 to $ 15 a square_foot . Rolled or textured glass . The glass is rolled in large sheets in various textures . Available in varied patterns , colors and degrees of transparency . Also referred to as Cathedral glass . Flash glass . Generally hand blown . An antique glass with a thin layer of colored glass fused onto its base . Stained glass . Paint and silver stain are used to define an image on pieces of colored or clear glass that is then leaded together . &quot; If a person wants a true Old_World look , stained glass is one of the older processes , &quot; Henry said . &quot; The old church work was stained glass -- pictures painted onto the glass_in order to tell a story to those who could not read. &quot; Frosted glass . Acid or sandblasting has been used to opaque the surface . Assembly Processes Here are some key ways that pieces of glass are connected : Leading . Pre-measured and cut_glass pieces that look much like pieces of a dress pattern or an intricate puzzle are bound together with lead . Waterproofing putty is always placed between the glass edges and the lead to help in preservation . Copper foil . Strips of copper foil ranging_in width from one-eighth of an inch to an inch depending_on thickness of the glass are wrapped around the edges . The pieces are then placed together and the joint is soldered on top of the glass . Bracing . Metal braces are needed to keep a window from sagging or bowing . This is especially important on large pieces or those that will be subject_to movement , such_as in a door . Some craftsmen prefer to incorporate the braces into the design , others prefer a straight-across bracing . Decorative Processes There are many ways to cut or etch glasswork . Here are some : Beveling . The glass is cut or shaped on the edges on a slant or incline . Beveled glass is what is often used in leaded glasswork , and can be quite thick . The beveling technique provides the refraction of light that is so intense . &quot; Beveled glass is beautiful , and lends itself to many different styles and periods of decor , &quot; Henry said . &quot; It became particularly popular around the turn_of_the_century . Combined with other processes -- such_as sandblasting or diamond-cut work , it has added beauty. &quot; Acid etching . The glass is obscured by a solution containing hydrofluoric_acid , which rapidly attacks the glass and dissolves its surface . Diamond-point engraving . Done entirely by hand , using a small diamond bit set_in a holder similar to a pen or pencil . Allows the user to sculpt the surface of the glass . Sandblasting . A jet of abrasive_material is projected onto the glass surface . The force of the impact of the abrasive chips a fine , granular texture into the natural or polished surface of the glass . In glasswork , the abrasive used is usually not sand , but rather a very fine grit of aluminum_oxide . Painted glass . Ceramic enamels , matte-type finishes and silver stain are used to &quot; paint &quot; glass . Enamel is a hard , glossy coating , in opaque white or colors . Staining uses an oxide or chloride of silver to create a yellow tone . Matte finishes are created by applying and removing parts of the paint to allow light to come_through certain areas . Generally , glass painting is done at a light table , with the artwork or drawn design placed on the underside of the glass . Brilliant cut work . Done using rotating wheels that deeply score the surface , creating polished prisms that increase light play . Cut_glass is_well known in work such_as Waterford crystal . French embossing . Acids or sandblasting combined with wheel work or brilliant cutting . Copper wheel engraving . Done by holding the blank glass against a lathe-like machine fitted with grinding tools . Stuben glass is a good_example of the delicate , intricate forms possible with copper wheel engraving .</TEXT>
