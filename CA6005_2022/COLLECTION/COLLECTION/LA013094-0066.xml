   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : FREQUENT FLIERS MAY FIND LESS TURBULENCE OVERSEAS ; TRENDS : IT ' S GETTING HARDER TO QUALIFY FOR FREE DOMESTIC_FLIGHTS , EASIER TO EARN FOREIGN FREEBIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These are trying times for those who live to fly free . As airlines around the world create and reshape frequent-flier programs to compete on a worldwide level , the frequent-flying life is getting ever more complicated for American domestic travelers . But in some respects , it ' s also getting more attractive for those looking_to Europe and other overseas destinations . To make the best of these developments , says Randy Petersen , Colorado-based publisher of Inside Flyer magazine , &quot; You don ' t have to fly more . What you have to do is become a more educated consumer , &quot; taking_advantage of the mileage tie-ins increasingly available through telephone_companies , credit_cards , rental-car companies , hotels and other sources . Stanley Dale , Arizona-based publisher of the newsletter Mileage &amp; Points , adds this : &quot; For anybody who travels internationally over the next couple of years , ( these changes ) could be a real plus. &quot; Here are a_few key pieces of the puzzle : * Increased mileage requirements for free U.S. flights . Having painted themselves into a corner with fare cuts , major carriers are compensating in part by raising the number of frequent-flier miles needed to qualify for a free flight . Beginning Feb . 1 , 1995 , United Mileage Plus and American AAdvantage program members will need 25 # 000 miles to get a free domestic coach flight , up from 20 # 000 . USAir ' s threshold , too , rises from 20 # 000 to 25 # 000 on Jan . 1 next year . Most of these changes , however , concentrate_on the bottom end of benefits , for the moment leaving requirements for international_flights unchanged . ( Earlier this month , United did announce a mixture of increases and decreases in qualifying mileage levels for international travel. ) Petersen forecasts that the 25 # 000 figure will become an industry standard . He predicts that Northwest will raise its threshhold from 20 # 000 to 25 # 000 , too -- and that Delta will come_down to 25 # 000 from its current 30 # 000 level . ( Northwest will say only that it is considering &quot; significant changes &quot; in its program in response to &quot; economic realities. &quot; ) As Petersen suggests , alert travelers can neutralize the hike by more efficiently gathering miles from various sources . But some sources could dry_up . Many hotel chains have updated programs so that travelers must choose either frequent-flier mileage or frequent-guest points for each stay -- but not both . ( The prominent exception is Hilton ' s HHonors program , which still allows &quot; double-dipping. &quot; ) * Less credit for short trips . On April 1 , Northwest ' s WorldPerks program will reduce the minimum mileage credit it offers per flight from 750 miles to 500 . Thus , a traveler on the 431-mile Northwest route from Dallas to Memphis , will get credit for 500 miles , instead of the current 750 . American , United and Continental Airlines made the same move about five years ago . ( Throughout 1994 , however , Northwest will add 500 bonus miles to the account of anyone connecting through Minneapolis , Detroit or Memphis. ) Delta continues to award a minimum of 1 # 000 miles for each flight , but Petersen and others suggest that will not last . * Alliances between U.S.-based and foreign-based carriers . &quot; The real growth ( of frequent-flier programs ) is going_to be in the international markets , &quot; says Dale . Throughout Europe , Dale points_out , carriers are &quot; starting to come_into things . . . . At least in the short term , that ' s going_to benefit U.S. frequent fliers because of the competition that ' s going_to surface. &quot; International cooperative pacts between airlines -- agreements that generally allow mileage earned on one airline to be applied toward a flight on another -- have been multiplying . American Airlines ' AAdvantage program now includes alliances with Canadian Airlines , Cathay Pacific , Qantas , Singapore and TWA . Northwest ' s WorldPerks program includes a partnership with KLM . USAir and British Airways , which have had limited reciprocal arrangements for passengers to &quot; earn and burn &quot; mileage points for several years , took a further step by lifting many restrictions last year . Meanwhile , United Airlines , which has played an elaborate game of musical partners in recent years ( now affiliated with Air Canada , Alitalia , Ansett Australia and Sabena , but disconnected from KLM and Swissair as of December ) , last month announced an imminent alliance with Lufthansa , bringing_together two giants and a massive route system . Under the reciprocal plans , there will be some differences between mileage accrual and redemption possibilities between the airlines .
