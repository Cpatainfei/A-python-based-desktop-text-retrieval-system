   <HEADLINE> LIKE GREEN ON RICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cooks in Mediterranean countries often prepare greens and rice in one pot for a quick , easy and satisfying dish . The technique starts_out like rice pilaf , with sauteed onion and sometimes garlic . Shredded greens are then cooked briefly with the onion . Next , the rice , broth or water and seasonings are added , and everything finishes cooking together in about 20 minutes . You can cook any tender greens this way ; the best are spinach , Swiss_chard , beet_greens and green cabbage . This method works because the greens cook quickly naturally . The water that is added_to cook the rice creates enough steam to soften the greens . During the cooking , the rice absorbs flavor and aroma from the greens , which also contribute a moist , tender texture that complements the slightly chewy rice . To make the dish even quicker , you can take_advantage of packaged rinsed spinach , so there are no leaves to wash . When the rice is cooked , sprinkle toasted almonds or pine_nuts over the top . Fresh or sun-dried tomatoes or roasted sweet red_peppers work well too . The greens and rice make a good accompaniment for roasted or grilled lamb , chicken or beef , but the dish also serves as a delightful vegetarian main_course . * This dish is popular in Lebanese and Armenian cuisines . It is most colorful when you use beet_greens because of the combination of white_rice , green leaves and reddish stems .
