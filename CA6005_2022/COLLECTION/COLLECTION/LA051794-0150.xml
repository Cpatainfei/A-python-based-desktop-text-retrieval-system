   <HEADLINE> MAKING SURE ENGINES WIN IN AERIAL BATTLES WITH BIRDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If a jet_engine can ' t stand_up to a 2.5-pound duck , its manufacturer has a multimillion-dollar turkey . Airplanes sometimes hit birds , and one or two sucked through a jet_engine can cause disaster if it can ' t keep working . This means the world ' s top jet_engine makers must perform some gory testing to make_sure the inevitable confrontations between bird and airplane will be fatal only to the bird . It may sound crude , but experts say there is just one perfect way to do this : Fire carefully weighed dead birds into running engines and then check for damage . The trials are called &quot; bird ingestion. &quot; Pratt &amp; Whitney tested its new PW4084 engines with both a big bird , an 8-pound turkey , and four 2.5-pound ducks . The bird carcasses are shot through an air cannon into the spinning engine blades . A slow-motion film of the larger bird shows the carcass flying toward the blades , which slice it into seven pieces as the engine consumes it . After the ducks are shot into the engine at about 170 miles an hour , tufts of feathers blow_out the back . The company obtained birds that had died of natural causes at poultry farms , spokesman Mark Sullivan said . As long as the birds are humanely killed , the practice seems to raise concerns only among the most vocal of animal rights activists . &quot; Anything that reduces the number of air accidents has got_to be a good thing , &quot; said Derek Niemann , a spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in England . Even as jet_engine makers use different design philosophies , they seem to favor different types of birds . GE Aircraft_Engines tried_out its GE90 engine on a herring_gull . At Rolls-Royce in England , humanely killed ducks are fired from the cannon at the Trent series of engines , a spokesman said .</TEXT>
