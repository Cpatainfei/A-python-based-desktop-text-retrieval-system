   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE PREPARES FOR LANDING ; BAD_WEATHER MAY CHANGE PLANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The crew of the space shuttle Discovery packed Thursday to come_home after a mission that made history with its U.S.-Russian partnership but achieved mixed results on the science front . Bad_weather threatened to disrupt NASA ' s landing plans . Forecasters were calling_for possible rain , low clouds and high winds at the Kennedy Space Center , any one of which could prevent the shuttle from landing there as scheduled at 9:44 a.m. PST today . Flight directors said they would consider sending Discovery to Edwards Air_Force Base in California later in the day if necessary . Another option would be to keep the shuttle up an extra day . Discovery ' s five American astronauts and cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev , the first Russian to fly_on a U.S. shuttle , have been in orbit since Feb . 3 . During the past week , the crew completed its chores inside Spacehab , the small commercial laboratory in the cargo bay . Only one of the 12 Spacehab experiments -- a cell-separation test -- encountered major trouble . The crew also finished all four joint U.S.-Russian experiments . Researchers from both countries will share the results of the medical and radiation measurements and Earth observations . But the crew achieved only two of three planned satellite releases . The most important , deployment of the Wake Shield Facility , failed due_to problems with the satellite . The steel , saucer-shaped Wake Shield remained aboard instead of flying free for two days as intended . Physicists wanted to avoid shuttle contamination while developing semiconductor film on the Wake Shield ; the film , if pure , could have led to faster computers . Astronaut Ronald Sega , a physicist and engineer who spent years working_on Wake Shield , said the experiment at least verified that thin semiconductor film can be produced in the vacuum of space . The Wake Shield is supposed to fly again on the shuttle next year . A German science satellite released Wednesday circled Earth , as did six metal balls ejected as part of a study on space debris . The crew took time Thursday to chat via ham radio with students at James Bean School in Sidney , Me. , and Krikalev tried , without success , to contact the three cosmonauts aboard Russia ' s Mir space_station .</TEXT>
