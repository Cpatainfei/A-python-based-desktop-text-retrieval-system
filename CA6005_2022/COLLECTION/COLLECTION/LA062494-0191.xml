   <HEADLINE> CALLS TO L.A. DOMESTIC ABUSE HOT LINES SOAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Both men and women are flooding domestic violence hot_lines as a result of the O.J. Simpson murder investigation . &quot; Now , the calls are up 80 % . It seems the more this unwinds , the more the phones start ringing , &quot; said Andrea Thompson Adam , hot-line coordinator for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women . The commission ' s hot_line usually fields about 1 # 300 calls a month . &quot; The women say , ' If it could happen to Nicole , it could happen to me . . . . ' The men say things like , ' I ' ve pushed my wife before . Does this mean I ' m a batterer ? ' It ' s really shaken the tree , &quot; Thompson Adam said . According to the Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Council , the county ' s other 18 hot_lines for battering victims have reported increased calls and higher attendance at support groups . The Domestic Abuse Center in Northridge has quadrupled its calls as a result of the Simpson case , a spokeswoman said . Since the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend , Ronald Lyle Goldman , increasingly graphic details of the Simpsons ' stormy relationship have emerged . He was convicted of misdemeanor spousal battery in 1989 after beating Nicole Simpson so severely that she required hospitalization . On Wednesday , as O.J. Simpson awaited trial in the slayings , police released a transcript of a 911 call his ex-wife made in October . On the tape , which has been broadcast nationwide , she could be heard pleading for help because Simpson was breaking_down her door . The increase in calls to hot_lines is the result of the unusual exposure of Nicole Simpson ' s experiences and people identifying with her , said Patricia Occhiuzzo Giggans , executive_director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women . &quot; They ' re seeing their lives played_out on TV--the intimidation , how fearful they are , how they keep the guy close to control his anger and abuse , how they almost accommodate him in some ways , especially when children are involved , &quot; Giggans said . At least half the callers volunteer that the Simpson case inspired them to call and more callers than before are using the words domestic violence to describe their situation , staffers said . The calls started to increase Monday and have continued to rise . Some women have been motivated to take the first_step to addressing long-term abuse . Roz Wolpert , a volunteer counselor at Santa Monica ' s Sojourn , a multi-service program for battered women , said she has noted a 60 % increase in callers on her shift . She recalled one woman who said she had been in a battering relationship for seven years . &quot; She told me the only reason she was finally calling is what ' s happening on the news , &quot; Wolpert said . &quot; I was beside myself , I was so happy that something good could come from this. &quot; But for some callers , the details of the Simpsons ' turbulent relationship have triggered flashbacks to previous traumas . &quot; They say , ' This is making me scared , the Simpson thing . . . . ' Some said they wanted to leave the area , &quot; said Jan Tyler , program director of Human Options in South Orange County . The calls have come from all parts of the region and beyond . Many have been referred to multicultural hot_lines and shelters with programs that are tailored to the callers ' ethnicity and are conducted in their native language . Most of the recent callers are women but the counselors have also received calls from men , a_few of whom say they have been battered and some of whom wonder if they are batterers . &quot; A lot of times people don ' t honestly recognize what this behavior is . It ' s learned behavior , &quot; Thompson Adam said . Some people may have grown_up with violence in their home or neighborhood , where they heard men say , &quot; You have to slap ' em every once in a while to keep ' em in_line , &quot; she said . &quot; People believe that , even though it ' s just a joke. &quot; One counselor suggests that bthemselves as they lose their te They can also call a hot linestory . One episode does not makeand recognize this episode for w Counselors at the Commission 1633842547lets you stay gone , or somebody on it . Victims need to ask themselvethey need to call the police . &quot; There isn ' t any easy advicemake an escape plan in conjuncti &quot; Every woman has to evaluateanother . A woman in one situatiosuffer severe repercussions as aget out. &quot; Growing Violence Against Women More_than 1.4 million domestic violence-related calls_for help have been reported by law_enforcement agencies to the state_Department of Justice since domestic violence was first made a separate crime from all other general assault crimes in 1986 . These numbers include all calls , whether or not an arrest was made . WHO ARE THE ATTACKERS ? A total of 400 # 000 individual interviews conducted between 1987 and 1991 by the U.S. Department_of_Justice showed that relatives and friends were responsible_for 33 % of attacks on women in cases where there was a single offender . By contrast , family violence accounted_for only 5 % of all violence against men : 03 # 19 , 07 # 05 WOMEN MEN Relative / intimate 33 % 5 % Acquaintance 35 % 50 % Stranger 31 % 44 % Unknown 1 % 1 % * Percentages are based on total number of victimizations for the five-year period , rather than on the annual average .
