   <HEADLINE> BIG JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS RAISES EYEBROWS ; COMMERCE : UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH 15 % GAIN IN JUNE BEGS QUESTION : WHY ARE EXPORTS STILL RISING DESPITE STRONG YEN ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Strong exports to the United States and Asia helped boost Japan ' s global trade surplus to $ 11.35 billion in June -- an unexpectedly high 15 % increase that raises questions as_to why the rise in the yen is not slowing Japanese exports . According to Finance Ministry statistics released Friday , the surplus with the United States rose by an even higher 43 % , to $ 4.73 billion from $ 3.30 billion a year ago . Economists said the export growth and the continued climb of the Japanese currency cast doubts about when the politically sensitive surplus will begin to decline . The doubts could spark further yen appreciation and more political pressure from the United States on Japan to do more to open its markets to imports . &quot; This could rebound on the yen , which would in turn worsen the J-curve effect ( of yen appreciation ) and spark a vicious_circle , &quot; Nikko Research_Center economist Tetsuro Sawano said . Over the long term , a high yen should make Japanese products more expensive overseas , cutting_into sales , while imports into Japan become more competitive . Until June , Japan ' s surplus measured in yen had been declining for more_than a year . But a stronger yen also tends to initially inflate the dollar value of Japan ' s surplus , before pushing it down as a result of increased imports and dwindled exports . This so-called &quot; J-curve &quot; effect occurs as the value of yen-based exports gets inflated in dollar terms when calculated with a lower dollar exchange_rate . The change in value eventually causes exports to fall and imports to rise , thereby rounding the curve of the J . What worries analysts is that the June rise in the surplus was not just the effect of the J-curve , but had even more to do with strong economic_growth in the United States and Asia and lingering recession in Japan . &quot; that ' s a big surplus with the United States , &quot; said Tohru Itami , chief currency trader at Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking . &quot; that ' s no good for the dollar. &quot; Friday ' s report came as the dollar continues to weaken against the yen . Analysts had expected that &quot; there was going_to be some jump back_up in Japan ' s surplus , but not that much , &quot; said Ron Bevacqua , an economist at Merrill Lynch Japan . &quot; Only part of this jump can be explained by the J-curve effect . It looks_to me that whereas everyone had hoped that last month was the first true sign that the trade surplus was going_to come_down , in_essence it was actually a blip. &quot; A Foreign Ministry official attributed the June rise to the steadily recovering U.S. economy , which particularly boosted Japan ' s exports of microchips and auto parts . Exports of seafaring ships , especially to China , also grew significantly . Some analysts insist that a trend toward a declining Japanese surplus is under way despite the June turnaround . &quot; The political focus_on the dollar value of Japan ' s trade surplus is completely misleading , &quot; said Geoffrey Barker , an analyst at Baring Securities Ltd . &quot; Dollar stability would quickly translate into a rapid decline in the surplus -- a fact which will become clearer as the year progresses , &quot; Barker said . Tomoko Fujii , an economist at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. , said her firm is still predicting a downward trend for Japan ' s surplus as economic recovery picks_up here . Fujii also said the June trade figures will not necessarily mean an even stronger yen . &quot; The currency markets did not react much to the trade figures , because their main concern is U.S. monetary policy at this time , &quot; she said .
