   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FINALS ; ANALYSIS ; FINAL FOUR A BLEND OF FAMILIAR , UNKNOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A month of competition has sorted_out the two best teams in the World Cup . Italy and Brazil are three-time champions , and both are very reluctant to give_up goals . They offer vastly contrasting styles . The road to the final was different than what most experts had predicted . When the Cup moves_into sudden_death , the essential qualities of the teams become more decisive . These represent an amalgam of strategy , technical skill and psychological endurance . Usually , the semifinalists are established soccer powers with a long history . Thus in Italy in 1990 , the semifinalists were England , Germany , Italy and Argentina -- each of which had won the World Cup previously . The current composition broke this pattern . Italy and Brazil are familiar , but Sweden had not gone this far since 1958 and had won little before or since , and Bulgaria -- which qualified only at the last minute in what was wrongly considered a freak victory over France -- had never before won a World Cup game . All this shows that soccer is in a state of transition and that the tactics of European soccer especially might be changing to put greater emphasis on sudden thrusts . Teams not encumbered by previous successes may be free to experiment . Part of the reason might be technical : The draw pitted many established powers against each other in the quarterfinals , leaving several spots open for outsiders . For example , the Brazil-Netherlands game involved teams capable of winning the Cup . For Brazil , it was the &quot; beautiful game , &quot; led by Romario and Bebeto , that Brazil invented and that others either envy or try to imitate , the game of intricate , controlled passing and fluid , constant attack . Romario made one goal , Bebeto a second , and Branco a 28-yard free_kick through the Dutch wall that clinched the game in the 81st minute . The Netherlands , which plays the most attractive game in Europe from the spectator ' s point_of_view , has a fascinating Cup history . It lost to Germany by one goal in the final in 1974 , lost to Argentina in overtime in 1978 and lost to Germany again by one goal in the round of 16 in 1990 . Its excellent players seem to lack the ultimate cohesion and discipline required for final success -- though they put_on a terrific show while they last . This year , of the three Brazilian goals , one was caused by an egregious defensive error , another because the Dutch defenders seemed oblivious to the new interpretation of the offside rule , whereby players not participating in the flow of the game are not considered offside . Italy-Spain was also a contest between established soccer powers . Italy has been described as a lucky team , and in truth it had two narrow_escapes -- against Nigeria in the 89th minute and against Spain in the 88th . On the other hand , it cannot be an accident that Italy has given_up only five goals in six games -- never more_than one a game . You do not see many teams with such a percentage . Italy does not score many goals -- five of its eight are the work of its great Roberto Baggio , who oscillates between brilliance and somnolence . The Italians are masters , however , at throwing the opponent off its game , inviting mistakes . This is what happened to Spain . Until the Italy match , Spain had emphasized defense ; against Italy it stressed offense -- especially in the second_half , most of which took_place in front of the Italian goal to such an extent that it seemed only a matter of time until the dam would break and Spain would prevail . Instead Italy suddenly launched a counterattack , scoring the decisive goal in the 88th minute on a marvelous dribble by Baggio against a Spanish defense that had moved too far upfield . In the New Jersey Meadowlands , perennial champion Germany played upstart Bulgaria . The German team had been touted before the Cup as a favorite , along with Brazil . But it never managed a convincing game . The only time the Germans looked_like champions was in the first_half against Belgium and South_Korea . The team was too old and too lacking in coherence and perhaps commitment . The tired and uninspired defending champions fell to a fast and furious attack by the little-heralded Bulgarians , 2-1 . The Germans ' lone goal came_on a penalty kick by Lothar Matthaeus . The Germans did everything right but they had neither imagination nor flair . The Bulgarians looked much more focused and also much faster . Hristo Stoitchkov tied the score with a terrific free_kick in the 76th minute and three minutes later Yordan Letchkov ' s header cinched the biggest upset of the tournament . To be sure , the Germans had some excuses . For a moment in the 73rd minute the Germans thought they had a second goal , but two of their players were ruled offside , apparently correctly , in a complex interpretation best left to theological scholars . ( The point was the same as the day before in the Brazil-Netherlands game -- whether the player concerned , this time Rudi Voeller , was involved in the original pass toward the goal. ) The gentlemanly Germans did not complain . And in truth the Germans should not have cut it so fine and would not have , had they had another choice . The quarterfinal between Sweden and Romania brought_together unseeded teams that were never expected to get there . Both had made_it the hard way : Romania had won a rousing game over Argentina ; Sweden had overcome Saudi_Arabia . Unfortunately the styles of the teams did not make_for a great match -- at least until the 79th minute . Both teams dropped_back , above all concerned about preventing the opponent from scoring . Sweden played , as usual , stolidly and conservatively . Romania was waiting for Sweden to make a mistake . Since Sweden made few attempts to assail Romania ' s defenses but offered no vulnerability , the game was about as interesting as watching a cat waiting for its prey . The cat finally pounced when Sweden ' s Tomas Brolin took a pass_on a free_kick and scored 11 minutes before the end of regulation_time . Ten minutes later , Florin Raducioiu scored for Romania . Eleven minutes into overtime Raducioiu scored again . Fourteen minutes later Kennet Andersson tied it for Sweden . A war of attrition had turned_into a free-for-all . The exhausted teams stumbled into penalty kicks , which , as the whole world knows , Sweden took 5-4 on two brilliant saves by goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli . The semifinals left little room for abstract speculation . Italy defeated Bulgaria in a stunning display of precision soccer in a game close enough so that a lot of glory was left for doughty Bulgaria . Italy ' s first_half was the best of any team in the tournament : cool , precision passing and masterful finishing by Baggio . Brazil against Sweden was much more one-sided . Brazil attacked incessantly . It had 26 shots on goal to Sweden ' s three . Nevertheless , it took Brazil until the 81st minute to score . It was curiously indecisive in completing its flamboyant maneuvers . Romario stumbled when in the clear ; he seemed to want to dribble the ball into the goal ; on another occasion , a Swedish defender rescued an out-of-position Ravelli on the goal_line ; Rai and Bebeto missed from close range . If Baggio is able to play , Brazil , for all_the joy its style supplies , might not be able to defeat the tough , disciplined , cerebral Italians , who do just manage to win and seem to improve with each game .</TEXT>
