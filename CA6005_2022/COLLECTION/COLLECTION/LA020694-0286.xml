   <HEADLINE> A NEW WASHINGTON AWAITS HOSOKAWA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa arrives here for Friday ' s summit with President Clinton , he is likely to find that the red_carpet welcoming him has a very different hue than the one rolled_out for his predecessors during the good old days of the Cold_War . The pomp and protocol will not be all that different , but the diplomatic overtones will . Hosokawa and his entourage of handlers from Japan ' s powerful economic bureaucracies will find that the rules of engagement have changed in the long simmering dispute over U.S.-Japan trade relations . Strategic allies or not , Americans are obsessed with their own &quot; economic security &quot; now , and they are redefining the linkage between trade and geopolitical security . The shift in priorities is subtle and still largely beneath the surface of open policy pronouncements . But early warning signs portend a new mode of confrontation with powerful ramifications for the way the world will look in a decade or so , during the so-called Pacific Century . No longer , in the post-Cold War era , does the threat of Soviet expansionism -- or even North_Korea ' s nuclear brinkmanship -- demand that America paper over its nettlesome trade disputes with Japan , the old bulwark against communist domino-tumbling in East Asia . &quot; The United States is no longer faced with the absolute need to trade off economic interests for security_interests , &quot; said W . Bowman Cutter , deputy director of the president ' s National Economic Council and a key White_House strategist on Asian affairs . &quot; We have more discretion now. &quot; At stake is not just tension in ties with Tokyo . The old China card , long held_up America ' s sleeve in the showdown with Moscow , is all but forgotten now in an escalating clash between Beijing and Washington over trade and human_rights . Gone , too , is a benign tolerance for developing Asian_nations ' tendency to emulate Japan ' s brand of capitalism . That model of mercantilist state guidance , many critics contend , has allowed booming Asian economies to prosper on exports while protecting home marketsand to take_advantage of an open U.S. market while enjoying the benefits of an unconditional security umbrella . Clinton articulated the evolving attitude on trade and security linkage when he complained about market barriers in a speech to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum in Seattle in November : &quot; We do not intend to bear the cost of our military presence in Asia and the burdens of regional leadership only to be shut_out of the benefits of growth that stability brings , &quot; the President said . It is open_to interpretation whether his remark was intended as a veiled threat of military withdrawal -- a kind of reverse saber rattling -- or a simple plea for voluntary economic reciprocity . * But the President ' s message was perhaps intentionally vague . No one has forgotten the blunder Jimmy_Carter made in the late 1970s , when he threatened to withdraw U.S. troops from South_Korea to push his human_rights agenda . Carter ' s gesture emboldened the volatile Communist regime in North_Korea , which the CIA believes now has a nuclear_warhead or two in its arsenal . &quot; We really are out there to defend American interests , &quot; said a Pentagon official knowledgeable_about Asia . &quot; I don ' t see us saying that if we don ' t resolve trade_barriers we ' re pulling_out . that ' s shooting ourselves in the foot. &quot; Still , the U.S.-Japan security alliance -- for more_than four decades the cornerstone of America ' s estimated $ 9 billion-a-year engagement in Asia -- may come under mounting pressure if the public perception of economic unfairness grows , analysts warn . &quot; The problem is that bad economic relations with Japan are souring the rest of our relationship , &quot; said Joan Spero , the State_Department ' s undersecretary for economic affairs . &quot; We can ' t continue to justify to the American people that we maintain these costly commitments without benefiting from the economic peace. &quot; It remains unclear whether Hosokawa can bring_to Washington a significant package of results-oriented trade concessions , as the Americans demand . More likely , analysts predict , he will ask Clinton to take the heat off and help him keep his fragile , change-minded coalition in power . But if tough-talking trade officials in the Administration prevail , the summit could become a benchmark in an unforgiving U.S. trade_policy -- never mind the political consequences for the reformist Prime_Minister . Ironically , the heat is rising in trade with Japan very soon after the Administration ' s triumphal &quot; triple_play &quot; in global trade initiatives late last year . In November , Clinton pushed the North_American Free_Trade Agreement through Congress . Then he hosted the much ballyhooed summit of Asian leaders in Seattle , setting a tentative course for regional economic cooperation . In December , cliffhanger negotiations gave a new lease on life to the global framework for free-market trade -- the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . But the new GATT agreement does not offer remedies for the most vexing problems of market access to Japan and other Asian economies , from South_Korea to Indonesia , U.S. officials and trade analysts contend . Rather than erecting high tariff walls and quotas , these economies protect themselves with informal barriers . That , supposedly , is why Japan -- despite its ascendance as the world ' s largest creditor nation -- is surprisingly insular when it comes_to foreign participation in its domestic economy . Foreigners own less than 1 % of all corporate assets in Japan and account_for only slightly more_than 1 % of total sales there . In contrast , Japanese interests alone control nearly 5 % of corporate America and account_for nearly 17 % of all U.S. sales , according to a recent study by David L . Asher , an analyst with the House Wednesday Group , a congressional forum . Asher ' s study , based on Japanese government statistics , finds that foreign penetration of the Japanese market is actually somewhat smaller today than it was 30 years ago , when Tokyo joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- where it remains an anomaly in terms of the scant foreign presence in its home markets . * Seiichiro Noboru , economic minister at the Japanese Embassy , decries the proliferation in official Washington of this type of negative analysis of Japan , which he dismisses as &quot; revisionism. &quot; Noboru , who will become consul general in Los Angeles later this month , recalled with chagrin an incident that illustrated the new American audacity during trade talks in Tokyo late last year . A high-level U.S. negotiator , apparently frustrated by the lack of progress in the talks , denounced Japan as an &quot; outlier &quot; among advanced industrial nations . Noboru and his colleagues saw the remark as an insult , labeling Japan an international pariah , akin to Iraq . &quot; We understood the idea was that Japan is so different from other countries that if you don ' t target it with sanctions , it won ' t move an inch , &quot; Noboru said . &quot; That idea hurts the ( Japanese ) people. &quot; Indeed , the Clinton_Administration appears to have been influenced widely by so-called revisionist critics of the Tokyo government who assert Japan is hardly the champion of free-market economics it professes to be -- and therefore must be treated differently than , say , Britain or Italy . Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen echoed this view_as he ended his visit to Tokyo last month , branding Japan as &quot; out of step. &quot; &quot; It ' s an untenable situation , &quot; said Robert E . Rubin , head of the National Economic Council and the Administration ' s principal coordinator for domestic and international economic_policies . &quot; In the long_run , you are not going_to solve U.S. trade_deficit problems unless you have access to these markets. &quot; The fundamental problem is Japan ' s &quot; broadly held mercantilist perspective , &quot; Rubin added . &quot; For whatever the reason , they have deeply embedded ways of doing things. &quot; The major bone of contention is Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States , which has risen inexorably from $ 17 billion in 1982 to $ 50 billion in 1992 . The trade_gap is expected to hit a record $ 59 billion , when last year ' s figures are compiled -- despite a jump in the value of the yen that theoretically should make Japan ' s products more expensive and less competitive abroad . Automobiles and auto parts alone account_for some three-quarters of the bilateral imbalance , which is why U.S. negotiators are seeking to pry open markets for foreign automotive products . * But if there is a focus in the current round of U.S.-Japan &quot; framework &quot; negotiations , it is the question of &quot; objective criteria. &quot; The issue : How can both sides agree to measure improved market access and monitor progress in bringing_down Japan ' s stubborn trade surplus ? From this point , the framework talks take_on the ethereal quality of a theological debate . The U.S. side is asking Tokyo ' s influential bureaucrats to use their powers of informal &quot; administrative guidance &quot; to coerce the private sector into importing more American goods . Japanese officials say that is impossible , arguing they no longer have the &quot; government reach &quot; to manipulate imports in the same way they planned and guided Japan ' s export machine in years past . The Japanese side takes the moral high groundat least in the eyes of its own publicby rejecting American demands for market access as &quot; managed trade &quot; that violates the spirit of GATT . Ultimately , this abstract exchange comes_down to earth with the bogyman of economic sanctionsand the question of whether the Clinton_Administration is posturing or really intends to strike_out to enforce its point_of_view . Japanese negotiators have categorically rejected the use of &quot; unilateral actions &quot; -- a euphemism for sanctions -- and vowed to suspend talks if things come_to blows . The U.S. has refused to assuage Japanese nerves by ruling out the use of sanctions if the talks fail , or if trade promises are not kept . &quot; We ' re not going_to disarm , &quot; said Spero , the State_Department official . &quot; I think the Japanese are very concerned about that. &quot; Yet the idea of imposing sanctions under existing trade lawsnamely Section 301 , a provision that empowers the President to assign punitive tariffsis a subject of great controversy . It is debatable whether such a bludgeon would effectively break_down the entrenched mind-set that obstructs market access to Japan -- or merely reinforce it . Moreover , sanctions could hurt American business interests at_home , where Japanese companies are tied deeply into the economy . ( Japan held $ 96.7 billion in cumulative U.S. direct investment -- from auto plants to office towers to bank portfolios -- at the end of 1992 , putting it ahead of Britain as the largest investor nation. ) &quot; Five years ago , it was easy to retaliate . But today , because of economic integration and strategic business alliances , a lot of U.S. interests are going_to be hurt , &quot; said William T . Archey , senior_vice_president at the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; And they ' ll be in the front of the line to complain. &quot; Beyond tariff sanctions , few forms of leverage are available . Pundits discuss downgrading airline landing rights , denying privileges to bid on federal public works projects or prosecuting Japanese multinationals under tax and antitrust_laws . But such tit-for-tat retribution smacks of protectionism , and risks igniting a trade war . * In the final analysis , is the new breed of trade warriors in the Clinton_Administration merely bluffing -- pretending to play hardball , but without a real bat ? Not so , said Rubin , the White_House economic field_marshal . This time things are really different , he said . There will be no backing_away to protect a friendly prime_minister in a jam , no soft peddling because the Japanese economy is in a slump . &quot; This trade situation has gone_on for well_over a decade , &quot; Rubin said . &quot; Each time we try to deal with it , there ' s another reason not to deal with it . We need to be sensitive to their political problems , but we also need to get things done. &quot; The Clinton-Hosokawa Summit Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa arrives in Washington on Friday for a summit_meeting with President Clinton . Here are the agendas that each leader is expected to bring_to the negotiating table : What Clinton will be telling Hosokawa : * There must be objective criteria to measure improvements in market access for a variety of foreign products and services , especially in the automotive sector . * Quantitative targets are necessary to assure the reduction of Japan ' s massive bilateral and global trade surpluses . * A significant package of income_tax cuts and public works spending is needed to boost Japan ' s domestic economy and promote imports . What Hosokawa will be telling Clinton : * The Japanese government does not have the &quot; administrative reach &quot; to force the private sector to import more foreign products . * Quantitative targets are tantamount_to &quot; managed trade , &quot; which violates the spirit of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and makes Japan vulnerable to punitive sanctions . * Japan , doing its &quot; utmost &quot; in an unstable political environment , is still considering a $ 130-billion domestic stimulation package , even after Hosokawa ' s $ 49-billion proposal had to be abandoned .</TEXT>
