   <HEADLINE> FAA MUST STRIKE BALANCE BETWEEN SAFETY , COST ISSUES ; AVIATION : AGENCY HAS TO JUSTIFY RULES THAT MAY BURDEN AIRLINES . CRITICS SAY ECONOMICS CARRY TOO MUCH WEIGHT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the Federal Aviation Administration decides whether to toughen airline safety regulations , the agency faces a dilemma : It must weigh the cost of proposed reforms against the value of human lives lost if nothing is done . A life , the government calculates , is worth $ 2.6 million . For example , records show , the FAA passed a regulation in 1992 requiring low-altitude warning systems in commuter airplanes , but only after agency officials determined that failing to act would cost $ 95.1 million in lives and property -- far more_than the $ 29 million for the devices . When the rule finally took_effect in April , 126 people had died in accidents that the FAA acknowledged may have been prevented by the safety equipment . &quot; The system kind of stinks , &quot; said Vinnie Mendolia of Medford , Ore. , whose brother , Richard , died in one such crash in 1989 . &quot; Too_bad something has to go_wrong and people have to die &quot; before regulations are changed . A four-month Times review of government documents and scores of interviews with air safety officials sheds_light_on a question hundreds of relatives of airplane crash victims and frustrated air safety investigators have asked : Why does_it sometimes take disaster or the passage of years to get federal air regulators to take meaningful action ? Like the causes of airplane crashes themselves , the answer is complex . It is rooted partly in the conflicted nature of the FAA . Serving two masters , the agency is charged with nurturing the aviation industry while ensuring the safety of the flying public . The FAA must balance safety against the cost to airlines , manufacturers and others whenever it considers changes in safety and equipment regulations . The result , according to records and interviews , can be delays in addressing safety problems -- and more accidents related to them . &quot; There were several fixes on the shelf that did not come_off the shelf until the second accident , or sometimes the third , &quot; said Ira J . Furman , a New York attorney who has worked for the National Transportation Safety Board and testified before Congress on aviation safety issues . &quot; I always wondered why it wasn ' t available beforehand . And the answer . . . is there are cost-benefit_analyses being done all_the time. &quot; The FAA ' s harshest critics don ' t for a minute believe that the agency knowingly waits for an accident to happen . But because the FAA must justify changes that require expenditures by the aviation industry , the agency sometimes must use past accidents to help make its case . And once the agency decides to make safety-related changes , it can take years before new rules take_effect , in part because the agency must consider the ramifications on the airline industry . FAA Administrator David Hinson said every government_agency is required by law to justify rules changes that cause financial burdens to government or private industry . To suggest that the practice almost requires accidents is &quot; a bit of an exaggeration , &quot; Hinson said in an interview . &quot; It ' s just a way for Congress to ensure &quot; that industry isn ' t &quot; unfairly . . . burdened . . . . But we don ' t compromise safety at any cost that I ' m aware of. &quot; &quot; I think there ' s this impression that the FAA stands around , waits for accidents to happen and then acts , &quot; Hinson said . &quot; Nothing could be further from the truth. &quot; The NTSB ' s Barry M . Sweedler , director of safety recommendations , said the FAA has an easier time pushing_through safety regulations , particularly those that are costly to the industry , when it can justify the expense . &quot; For them to go_forward to change rules that they can ' t show a cost-benefit for , it ' s very tough , &quot; he said . The point is illustrated by the FAA ' s handling of a critical safety issue on commuter planes . The FAA had recognized the benefits of installing &quot; ground proximity warning systems &quot; since the mid-1970s when it required their installation on commercial jets . The devices verbally warn a pilot if the plane is too close to mountainsides or other terrain . After studying a series of crashes in the early and mid-1980s , the NTSB on Oct . 9 , 1986 , released a study , saying it was convinced that three recent commuter plane accidents that killed 25 people likely would not have happened if the aircraft had been equipped with ground proximity warning systems . The study noted that commercial airline crashes involving &quot; controlled flight into terrain &quot; dropped 75 % once the FAA required the altitude devices . The NTSB recommended that all turbine-powered airplanes that carry 10 or more passengers be required to have one on board . But , records show , the FAA and some in the commuter airline industry , while acknowledging the life-saving merits of the devices , opposed them , questioning whether the cost , at roughly $ 14 # 000 apiece , was justified . Accidents continued . On Jan . 19 , 1988 , a Fairchild Metro Twin commuter plane crashed into a ridge in Durango , Colo . Nine of the 17 people aboard died . A month later , a Fairchild Metro III crashed in Raleigh-Durham , N.C. , killing 12 . An internal FAA memorandum dated September , 1988 , said 60 of 280 commuter airline crashes between 1972 and 1985 may have been avoided with ground proximity warning systems . &quot; When averaged_out over 14 years , &quot; the memo said , &quot; this amounts to approximately four accidents per year . These 60 accidents accounted_for 141 fatalities. &quot; In 1989 , at the FAA ' s request , the Department_of_Transportation studied 41 accidents that occurred between 1970 and 1988 , concluding that two-thirds of them could have been prevented if the planes had had ground proximity warning systems . Finally , on April 24 , 1990 , the FAA announced its intent to pursue a rule change that would require the installation of altitude warning systems in commuter planes . The next year the agency did a cost-benefit_analysis . The devices would save 56 lives a year at $ 1.5 million each -- the estimated value of a human life at that time -- and would prevent seven injuries at $ 4.5 million a year and salvage 16 airplanes worth $ 6.6 million , according to an FAA memo dated March 4 , 1991 . Total benefit : $ 95.1 million , nearly $ 70 million more_than the cost of requiring the devices on the more_than 800 airplanes that would be covered by the rule . Some airlines requested that the FAA require a cheaper version of the device , but the FAA refused . The FAA did , however , give the industry two years to comply ; in the meantime , more accidents happened . Within the FAA , officials recognized the deadly cost of more delays . &quot; For every six months we delay GPWS , we can expect an accident , &quot; said one official in a 1992 memo . * Four months before the deadline , Northwest Airlink Flight 5719 crashed in Hibbing , Minn , killing 18 people . The NTSB concluded : &quot; This accident , like many others , could have been prevented. &quot; &quot; To lose a son is a terrible thing , &quot; said Leonard Falitz , whose son , Marvin , died in the Minnesota crash . &quot; There were times when I woke_up in the middle of the night and went_through the flight recorder , every word , every detail. &quot; Another parent , Dolores Shue , still remembers a day in September , 1985 , when the phone rang and the official-sounding voice on the other end of the line said he was sorry , but he had some terrible news : The plane carrying her son , Larry , and 13 others had gone_down and , in all likelihood , Larry was dead . Later , she would learn something nearly as tragic : A ground proximity warning device could have prevented the accident . &quot; There is no good way to learn that &quot; your child has died in a plane crash , Dolores Shue said . &quot; I just couldn ' t believe it . I wasn ' t crying . I just stood_in the middle of my living room . &quot; He seemed like one of those eternal people to us. &quot; In their last conversation , Dolores Shue spoke_to her son , a writer , about the upcoming Chicago opening of his successful play , &quot; The Foreigner , &quot; and about the sitcom pilot he was writing for CBS . The first indication that something was wrong came at 6 p.m. when a Henson Airlines official telephoned . &quot; She asked me if there was someone there with me . . . . I said : ' Don ' t tell me there was an accident. ' &quot; The commuter plane had smashed into the side of a mountain in Virginia ' s Shenandoah Valley . Larry Shue ' s wake took_place the same day his play was scheduled to open in Chicago . * Critics say that the FAA , in seeking changes in regulations , depends too heavily on accidents that have already occurred . The reason , they say , is that in a climate of public outrage over a serious accident , it is easier to push reforms through Congress . Rep . James L . Oberstar ( D-Minn. ) said a heavy reliance on past accidents is built into the system . The FAA &quot; are people who are very high-minded , very committed to safety , but then they are told : ' You ' ve got_to spend the time doing these analyses , ' &quot; said Oberstar , the outgoing chairman of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation ' s subcommittee on aviation . &quot; By the time you get_through this , it can be months and years. &quot; Before the FAA can act , records show , the agency calculates how a proposed safety rule will affect the aviation industry -- everything from the public perceptions of a specific company or industry to the economic impact . Critics feel that sometimes safety takes a second seat to economic concerns . Earlier this year , when the agency pondered whether to adopt measures to prevent accidents caused by potentially deadly wake turbulence from Boeing 757 jetliners , FAA officials were concerned about economic health of the Boeing Co. , internal documents show . In internal memos , they expressed concern about what effect any new safety measures would have_on sales of the popular jetliner . They analyzed the pros and cons of taking action on the turbulence issue . &quot; Boeing ' s perception &quot; among the public was one of the cons listed . Two accidents linked to B-757 wake turbulence had already happened , killing 13 people . &quot; Ultimately , you can ' t make safety recommendations in a vacuum , &quot; said former NTSB Chairman James E . Burnett Jr . &quot; But weighed against human life , ( a company ' s ) image ought not to have much weight. &quot; A more recent , if subtler example : The FAA earlier this month called a news_conference to say that ATR regional aircraft are safe . It followed the Oct . 31 crash of an American_Eagle ATR-72 that killed 68 people in Roselawn , Ind . The FAA specifically declared that the planes were safe -- an assurance that some observers believed went too far . Friday -- a week after the FAA held the news_conference to reassure the public that ATR commuter planes were safe -- the agency ordered regional airlines not to fly the planes in icy weather . Ice has been a prime suspect in the crash . &quot; What they ought to be saying is : ' This airplane is complying with the full extent of regulations , ' &quot; said one aviation safety source who spoke on condition of anonymity . &quot; They declared the aircraft safe . that ' s not what a government regulatory_agency should say . In effect , they ' re a booster for the airlines. &quot; A close relationship between the FAA and the industry is a natural one , given the agency ' s mandate to foster air_travel . But critics say that it sometimes impedes safety decision-making . After investigating a 1988 non-fatal accident in Dallas involving a DC-10 , air safety investigators determined that the brakes on DC-10s were inadequate to stop the airplanes during an aborted takeoff . But , Burnett said , &quot; the FAA was slow to admit there was a problem . that ' s because the people at the FAA had been involved in the certification of this aircraft years ago . Admitting there was something wrong now meant they had made a mistake the first time. &quot; Another example : In 1985 , an Eastern Airlines L1011 had to make an emergency_landing in Miami shortly after takeoff . An investigation showed that the airline had a problem with missing O-rings on engines in its L1011s that caused seven forced landings . At a hearing , the FAA said it had been aware of the problem prior to the incident . Officials acknowledged that they relied_on a phone_call to Eastern ' s vice_president to remedy the problem and had not checked his maintenance records . &quot; Vice_presidents don ' t put_on O-rings , &quot; Burnett said curtly . In an interview , Burnett later said : &quot; The FAA says it has an arm ' s length relationship with industry , but the question is whether it should be just an arm ' s length. &quot; FAA officials say their relationship with the airlines and manufacturers is proper and healthy , and both are working together to make flying even safer . Chris Chiames , spokesman for the Air Transport Assn. , said : &quot; They are our regulators . We have a working relationship with them . Sometimes it ' s a good relationship ; sometimes we are at_odds . &quot; To suggest anything other_than that it is a working relationship is incorrect . There are plenty of times we feel the FAA oversteps its regulatory_authority in imposing requirements on us. &quot; Chiames defended the FAA ' s record on safety issues . &quot; What is the ( safety ) record of the industry the FAA regulates ? It ' s the best in the world . Can it be better ? We want it to. &quot; In other instances , safety issues at the FAA -- a bureaucracy with 50 # 000 employees and a budget nearly equivalent_to the state of Alabama ' s -- have simply fallen_through the cracks . One recent fatal_accident involved one of the FAA ' s own planes -- a Beechcraft Super King Air 300 that crashed into a mountain in October , 1993 , in Virginia , killing three people . The NTSB determined that pilot error was the chief reason for the crash , but the safety board , in a wider investigation , also found some disturbing lapses in the way the FAA runs its fleet of 50 planes . Many planes were missing critical safety equipment , such_as cockpit voice recorders and ground proximity warning systems , the safety board said . The agency had no approved manuals for maintenance procedures and flight operations , the board said . Similar problems were identified by the FAA itself after a 1988 accident that destroyed a Rockwell Jet Commander operated by the FAA . The NTSB cited failure of the FAA hierarchy &quot; to properly recognize and resolve problems within the flight inspection program &quot; of_their_own agency . Those problems , the NTSB said , were not corrected because &quot; management action was ineffective , and oversight by senior executives was insufficient. &quot; &quot; This business of_their_own flying operations -- they made promises , they said they would clean it up and they didn ' t , &quot; one air safety investigator said . &quot; Their own audits had pointed it out. &quot; Hinson said the agency doesn ' t always agree with the accident findings of the NTSB , which is responsible_for making safety recommendations following crashes . FAA has vowed , however , to scrutinize the procedures it uses for its own fleet to prevent future accidents . Next : How the FAA is addressing problems . Times researcher Sheila A . Kern and special correspondent Shelby Grad contributed to this report . How the Study Was Conducted To complete this report , The Times reviewed about 20 # 000 pages of internal documents obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration through the Freedom of Information Act . The newspaper also reviewed a computer analysis of the causes of airplane crashes between 1983 and last July by the National Transportation Safety Board . The Times also studied dozens of reports by government oversight agencies and interviewed scores of present and past FAA officials , airline industry sources , aviation safety experts , members of Congress , crash survivors and the families of crash victims .
