   <HEADLINE> AIDS PATIENTS CALL ' MIRACLE ' A MEDICAL HOAX ; LAWSUIT : PLAINTIFFS , INCLUDING NINE HIV-INFECTED MEN , SAY THEY WERE HUMAN GUINEA_PIGS IN AN EXPERIMENT WITH A USELESS DRUG .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Helen MacEachron lay on her bed , blinking back tears as she made another entry in her videotaped diary . With her camcorder whirring , she talked quietly about trying a new drug , Viroxan , that she hoped would stop the lymph cancer that was slowly killing her . &quot; This experimental treatment is a godsend , &quot; said MacEachron , a former legal secretary and aspiring writer in Santa Monica . &quot; If this doesn ' t get any better -- this is just a nightmare , you know ? &quot; But things quickly went_wrong with Viroxan . In a later , more jarring video segment , MacEachron unbuttoned her shirt to examine the plastic catheter that had been surgically implanted between her breasts so she could take the drug intravenously . What she saw panicked her . &quot; I can ' t believe -- oh God ! This thing has blood . . . . Oh God ! This wasn ' t here before , &quot; she said . &quot; I somehow accepted the idea that I ' m doing this . But I ' ve not accepted the idea that it could feel or be bad. &quot; When a serious infection later landed her in the hospital , and her catheter had to be removed , MacEachron decided that Viroxan indeed was bad . In late 1991 , she sued two San Fernando Valley doctors who installed the catheter and another physician who invented Viroxan . Joining the lawsuit were nine Los Angeles men infected with the AIDS virus who also had taken Viroxan . MacEachron and one other plaintiff have since died , but the first phase of their suit has recently gone_to trial in Los Angeles Superior_Court . Attorneys for both sides and outside legal_experts say they believe it is the first civil trial in the United States involving allegations of AIDS fraud . But noticeably absent from the proceedings in Department 41 is the central figure in the Viroxan saga : Stephen D . Herman , the articulate , handball-playing former radiologist who formulated the drug in a guest house behind his $ 700 # 000 Orange County home . In January , Herman , who has since moved to Florida , declared bankruptcy , automatically halting all litigation against him . Five people are known to have died after taking Viroxan , but each had been seriously ill , and state medical investigators could not directly link Viroxan to the deaths . But investigators insisted that the demise of two men with acquired immune deficiency syndrome was hastened by their involvement with Viroxan and negligent treatment they received from Herman and a North Hollywood doctor , Valentine Birds , who helped him . Although Viroxan was never approved for human testing or consumption , Herman claimed it was a miracle drug that could halt the progression of AIDS and cure cancer , warts , sunburn , psoriasis , arthritis and athlete ' s foot . He injected it in at least one patient even before he knew if it was toxic to animals . He was arrested in 1990 and later convicted of false advertising related to Viroxan sales . After state medical officials charged him with incompetence and negligence in 1991 , Herman surrendered his doctor ' s license rather than face a trial . Birds was tried_on similar charges and lost ; his license was revoked . State authorities said the disciplinary actions were the first in California against AIDS quackery . * The lawsuit brought by the late MacEachron and her co-plaintiffs charges that Viroxan -- a citrus derivative infused with ozone -- has no medical value . By being put_on it , they argue , they were deprived of crucial time in which to take legitimate drugs such_as AZT , the first_AIDS drug approved by the federal_government . The lawsuit also alleges that the doctors and another defendant , the Medical_Center of North Hollywood , where catheters were installed , conspired to use the plaintiffs as human guinea_pigs in an unethical &quot; experiment &quot; designed to generate test data that could help market Viroxan . The plaintiffs want $ 10 million apiece in damages . The defendants deny the charges . They say those who took Viroxan suffered no serious harm and are not entitled to damages . They also claim that recent studies indicate that AZT is more toxic and less likely to extend the life span of people with AIDS than originally believed . Herman injected Viroxan in dozens of patients , saying it caused dramatic increases in their T-cell counts , a measure of immune-system health . Some of those who took it have claimed the drug saved their lives . But independent AIDS experts said Herman ' s limited data proved nothing , since T-cell counts often rise and fall sharply , even with no medication . Moreover , shots of the syrup-like drug were excruciatingly painful -- so_much so that even patients who believed it was keeping them alive went_off it . To get_around that problem , Herman hit on the idea of having catheters implanted in patients ' chests , so they could take Viroxan intravenously . The physician who arranged for catheter implants was Birds , a pleasant , gray-haired osteopath who advocated holistic treatments and had unconventional ideas about treating AIDS . In 1989 , when Birds was recommending Viroxan , only one drug -- AZT -- had been approved by the federal_government for use against AIDS . But Birds urged patients not to take AZT , saying it was &quot; poison &quot; due_to its toxic side_effects . Instead , he recommended Vitamin_C and typhoid vaccine -- substances that are not standard treatments for AIDS . In an interview with The Times , Birds said he learned about typhoid vaccine from an article in a rock ' n ' roll magazine . By late 1989 , Birds had referred about 10 people for catheter implants , he said . A number of those who received the tubes soon developed infections that led to blood_poisoning and dangerously high fevers . One , a Beverly Hills floral designer suffering from AIDS , died after being found in a bathtub where he had lain for three days , in shock and suffering from pneumonia , blood_poisoning and a bad staph infection . State authorities said the infection was related to his catheter . In October , 1991 , 10 ex-patients sued Herman , Birds , the Medical_Center of North Hollywood and a Sherman Oaks doctor , Rajindra Sethi , who performed the catheter surgery . In February , five of the plaintiffs went_to trial ( the others were sent to another courtroom for trial later ) . But after 2 1 / 2 years of preparation and pretrial arguments , the legal battle has taken a toll on many of those involved . Like Herman , Birds and Sethi have declared bankruptcy . Although the state took no disciplinary action against him , Sethi voluntarily closed his practice last year , his attorney said . The main plaintiff lawyer , Raymond Henke , is so caught_up in the Viroxan case that he often seems obsessed with it . A medical malpractice specialist , he quit a handsomely paid job at a Los Angeles law_firm to pursue the case full time . With no salary since 1992 , the tall , 40-year-old attorney , with collar-length hair , is so deeply in debt that he stopped paying the mortgage on his small West Hollywood home , which now serves as his office . Visitors find it difficult to avoid tripping over the heaps of legal_briefs , depositions and medical textbooks that fill nearly every available surface in Henke ' s living room . To pay_for day-to-day trial expenses , not to mention groceries , he depends_on a $ 5 # 000 monthly loan from his parents . Preparing_for the trial took so_much of his time that he often brought along his 8-year-old son when he interviewed witnesses on weekends . With the trial in_full_swing , Henke dispatched his wife to be with her family in Costa Rica so he could concentrate better . He has so little cash , he cannot afford to pay the man who services his rented copying machine . At one point , police seized his car -- and booted Henke and his son out of it -- because Henke had failed to pay his registration fees for the past two years . * Assisting him in court is Sterling Wolfe , 30 , a UC Berkeley law_school graduate who has not been paid in two years and recently had to declare bankruptcy himself . On top of that , his fiance dumped him , upset that he was &quot; working for a cause &quot; instead of having a job with a regular salary . &quot; I ' m nowhere near as idealistic as Ray , &quot; said Wolfe , who , along with his boss often seems exhausted in court , the result of regular 100-hour workweeks and little sleep . &quot; If the clients were not the best people I ever met , I ' d be gone. &quot; Henke , however , insists he has no regrets about what he is doing . &quot; It ' s very liberating to know that the richest_man is the man who needs the least , &quot; he said . &quot; I really believe that that kind of humility is something I could have learned only in this case. &quot; Henke has carried his crusade against Viroxan far beyond the courtroom . He testified against Herman and Viroxan before a congressional subcommittee in Washington . When Herman was trying to get a Kenya medical institute to test and manufacture Viroxan , Henke tried to undercut him by sending letters to the institute and the World_Health_Organization detailing Herman ' s legal problems at_home . But defense_lawyers have mostly harsh words for Henke . &quot; I have never seen anyone so obsessed with a case , &quot; said Andrew Lloyd , an Orange County attorney who formerly represented Herman . &quot; He is so self-righteous about it . Oh , you ' re evil if you disagree_with him . This is just a case , Ray . It isn ' t Hitler against the world . I tell him , ' I ' m a lawyer , you ' re a lawyer. ' I tell him the other lawyers are nice . He says : ' No . They ' re wicked , despicable , evil. ' But no , they ' re not. &quot; Henke said he is going_after the doctors and the hospital with such a vengeance in_order to send a message that defrauding desperate people with terminal illnesses is unacceptable and will be punished . &quot; I think these guys are extremely cynical physicians whose object clearly was to take_advantage of AIDS patients for their own gain , &quot; he said . Henke charged that the doctors ' bankruptcies were deliberate efforts to delay the trial until his clients died . Defense_lawyers scoff at that contention , saying the doctors filed because they have no medical income and heavy debts . ( Henke was able to persuade federal bankruptcy judges to let him pursue Birds and Sethi in Superior Court. ) In contending that his clients were subjected_to medical experimentation by the defendants , Henke repeatedly has compared them to Joseph Mengele , the infamous Nazi doctor who performed depraved medical &quot; tests &quot; on concentration_camp inmates -- an analogy the defense rejects as ridiculous and unfair . And as the trial has unfolded , defense_lawyers have poked a number of holes in Henke ' s case . For instance , Henke said that plaintiff Rod Garcia developed a catheter infection so bad he had to be hospitalized and later was bedridden at_home for six months . So shaken was Garcia by the experience , said Henke , that he swore_off any further contact with doctors and thus has gone without AZT or other treatment for his AIDS since 1990 . But on cross-examination , defense_lawyer David O ' Keefe , who represents Birds , produced records that he said indicated Garcia refused other doctors ' advice to take AZT , before and after meeting Birds . In 1992 , according to one record , Garcia told a West Hollywood physician he was &quot; a macrobiotic &quot; who did not use conventional drugs . O ' Keefe also challenged Garcia ' s contention that he and his mother had given Birds more_than $ 25 # 000 for typhoid vaccine shots and other unapproved AIDS treatments . O ' Keefe displayed billing records that he said showed Garcia had paid Birds less than $ 3 # 900 . Henke has pledged to file separate lawsuits later against Herman . But with Viroxan ' s creator absent from the courtroom , the trial has focused_on Birds . Birds and his lawyers argue that none of the plaintiffs was injured by being steered away from AZT . Indeed , they say , the passage of time has proven Birds right about AZT , as recent studies have concluded that it is less effective and more toxic than at first believed . But Henke insists Birds is misreading the studies . He said they do not question the overall effectiveness of AZT , but only whether it is as effective when used late in the disease as in the early stages of AIDS .</TEXT>
