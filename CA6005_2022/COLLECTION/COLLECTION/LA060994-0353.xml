   <HEADLINE> TANTALIZING ; OLD PRODUCTS PALE IN COMPARISON WITH IMPROVED FORMULAS THAT REFLECT THE DESIRE TO LOOK SUN-KISSED WITHOUT RISK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Self-tanning products first came_on the market more_than 20 years ago , promising consumers they could have a fast tan without baking in the sun . Yet a dark cloud soon shadowed those early self-tanners : Instead of looking natural , the tans-from-a-tube sometimes looked streaky . Even worse , the lotions turned some fair-skinned people an unflattering shade of orange . Self-tanning products have finally found their place in the sun . In recent years improved formulas have greatly reduced the products ' unsightly side_effects . In addition , a growing awareness of the sun ' s damaging effect on skin has caused many consumers to take a second look_at self-tanners as an alternative to pale skin . Sales figures reflect the shift in tanning attitudes . Fifteen years ago , suntan oils and lotions accounted_for 65 % to 75 % of sun-related product sales , according to Clinique Laboratories Inc. Today sun blocks with a sun protection factor of 15 or higher comprise 65 % of the market . Sales of self-tanning products alone jumped 50 % in 1992 and 20 % in 1993 . &quot; The public has become more educated about sun damage -- everybody ' s trying to avoid it , &quot; says Billur Wallerich , spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus in Fashion Island Newport Beach . &quot; The next best thing to a ( natural ) healthy glow is to use self-tanning products. &quot; While they worry about wrinkles and skin_cancer , men and women still want a little color . &quot; We ' re not seeing the over-exposed tans that were popular in the ' 50s and ' 60s , but still , a touch of sun makes you look healthy , &quot; Wallerich says . &quot; We do not want to look pale in our bare summer clothes. &quot; Almost all major cosmetic companies now have their version of a self-tanner on the market , and they report brisk sales . Estee Lauder ' s Self-Action SuperTan ( about $ 25 ) has been so hot , the company reports having trouble keeping it in_stock . Since Clinique introduced its Self-Tanning Formula in 1988 , the product has been the No . 1 seller among all_of its sun-related product -- even eclipsing its sunscreens . ( A four-ounce bottle with a pump spray is $ 12.50. ) &quot; It ' s a year-round item , &quot; says Paige Ferguson , director of product development for treatment , men ' s and fragrance at Clinique in New York City . * Summer or winter , women will use a self-tanner when they ' re wearing something revealing like a strapless gown . Sales of self-tanners do jump in late spring , when people are first putting_on shorts and swimsuits and getting ready for summer , Ferguson says . To entice buyers to their product , cosmetic companies offer self-tanners in different user-friendly formulas . There are self-tanning creams , sprays , gels and mousses , says Robin Silber , cosmetic treatment buyer for Nordstrom in Orange County . Gels dry quicker , while sprays make_it easier to cover hard-to-reach places , but which product one picks is simply a matter of personal preference . Consumers can also choose from different depths of color , she says . &quot; You can have your choice of fair , medium or dark , &quot; Silber says . &quot; They ' ve really refined the quality of self-tanners to make application easier and to make the color more natural. &quot; One other improvement : &quot; The smell used to be really bad , &quot; she says . &quot; They ' ve put a blocker in it &quot; so consumers won ' t be turned_off by the odor . Regardless of the name or slick packaging , all self-tanners contain a tanning agent called dihydroxyacetone -- the same ingredient found in the early formulas such_as Q.T. and Man Tan . &quot; The material itself is colorless , but when you put it on it turns the skin a brown color , &quot; says John Wenninger , director of cosmetic chemistry for the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Assn . in Washington , D.C. &quot; The color varies with skin types. &quot; Scientists speculate the color is caused by a reaction of DHA with the skin ' s protein on the outer layers of the skin , Wenninger says . The difference between the old products and the new is the concentration of other ingredients . The early products were watery , so they tended to streak and run more , Wenninger says . While the first formulas might have contained 20 % of DHA , today ' s products such_as Clinique ' s Self-Tanning Formula have only about 5 % DHA , Ferguson says . That helps avoid an orangish cast or uneven color . &quot; The lower levels are positioned for more fair skin , &quot; Ferguson says . Just how natural the self-tan looks can depend_on how one applies the product . Before rubbing it all_over , consumers should put a small amount on the inside of their forearm then wait a_couple_of hours to see if the final color is acceptable , Wenninger says . Even with the new formulas , a_few people have still complained of an orangish tone -- a problem probably related to their skin types , he says . &quot; It may be more rare , but it still can happen , &quot; he says . Other tips from Estee Lauder for applying a self-tanning product : * Cleanse and exfoliate the skin thoroughly to remove dead skin_cells . The tan will be smoother and last longer . * Wash the hands vigorously immediately after applying to avoid &quot; tan palms. &quot; * Apply the products lightly to the knuckles , knees or elbows -- areas where there are fine , tiny lines that tend to absorb more cream and turn darker . Self-tanners take about two to three hours to work . The artificial tans last three or four days , about as long as a natural tan , before the color wears_off as the skin naturally turns_over its top layer of dead cells . The tans do not wash off . A last word of caution : Although the skin looks tan , it hasn ' t built_up the kind of resistance to sunburn that occurs with actual sun exposure . Without a sunscreen , &quot; you ' ll burn straight through , &quot; Wenninger says .</TEXT>
