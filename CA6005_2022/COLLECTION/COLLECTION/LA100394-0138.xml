   <HEADLINE> GANGSTERS TARGETING JAPANESE EXECUTIVES ; VIOLENCE : CORPORATE WORLD HAS BECOME FEARFUL . THREE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SLAIN IN LAST 14 MONTHS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A wave of violence directed at business_executives here is casting a spotlight on the murky world of relationships between gangsters and big business in Japan -- and stoking fear among those with gang contacts . Just last week , shots were fired at the home of a retired insurance executive who still consults for his company , and last month a Sumitomo Bank executive was murdered , execution style . Police have speculated that the unsolved slaying of Kazufumi Hatanaka , manager of Sumitomo Bank ' s branch in the city of Nagoya , may be related to the bank ' s aggressive efforts to collect loans made during the peak of Japan ' s late-1980s economic boom . It is suspected that some borrowers may be gangster-controlled firms . Hatanaka ' s murder is the third killing since the spring of last year that appears to be part of what Japanese media are describing as a wave of gangland terror against corporate targets . Hatanaka , 54 , was shot through the head outside the door of his 10th-floor apartment in a controlled-access condominium building . &quot; Judging from the method in the ( Hatanaka ) incident , we think it likely this was a planned attack by an organized crime group , &quot; said Takeshi Noda , head of the organized crime investigative division at the National Police Agency . &quot; Because it was a quick hit and immediate escape , we don ' t have much in the way of witnesses and evidence. &quot; Since enactment of an anti-gang law two years ago , police have moved more aggressively than ever before against Japan ' s yakuza , who for decades were romanticized in film and tolerated by the public . It is much easier than in the past , for example , for police to arrest yakuza on harassment charges . Corporations that once yielded to extortion by gangs , or sometimes even sought to benefit from their activities , have also been taking steps to end such relationships . While companies often are simple victims of protection rackets , there also are cases where firms try to make use of gangsters . For example , sokaiya are gangs that specialize in extorting money from firms by threatening to disrupt stockholders meetings . But sokaiya also are sometimes used by management to ensure that legitimate shareholders do not challenge company policies . Real_estate developers sometimes turn_to yakuza for help in evicting tenants from properties targeted for redevelopment . Tenant rights are so strong in Japan it is often hard to force people out by legal means . Recent anti-gang efforts aim to end these practices . As pressure on gangs has built , the incidence of apparent gang violence against corporations also has escalated sharply . Since 1992 , there have been 18 reported gun or knife attacks on corporate_executives , according to the National Police Agency . These attacks remain unsolved . But given the low level of random street crime in Japan , at least most are presumed_to have been targeted against specific victims , probably for reasons related to their work . &quot; Since the bursting of the ( late-1980s ) financial bubble , the corporate world has been under pressure to cut its ties with organized_crime , &quot; said a recent editorial in the Nikkei Weekly . &quot; This in turn has sparked bad feelings , and police suspect gang members have been involved in some of the recent attacks against corporate officials . In fact , some observers hold that these attacks are part of an organized terror campaign against companies and society as_a_whole , &quot; the paper said . &quot; Corporations must_not yield to these threats of violence . Doing so will only embolden those involved , and lead to the spread of such activities throughout society. &quot; The single most frequent target of attacks has been Sumitomo . Firms of the Sumitomo group -- which has Sumitomo Bank at its core -- have been targeted in 22 incidents since early last year , according to police . These have included fire bombings of executives ' homes , the firing of shots at Sumitomo properties , severed telephone_lines and verbal threats . In an incident with the marks of a ritual assassination , Fuji Photo Film Co . executive Juntaro Suzuki was killed in February on the street outside his Tokyo home by men wielding samurai swords . Suzuki ' s work involved coping_with sokaiya . A vice_president of the small Hanwa Bank , Tomosaburo Koyama , was murdered last year in what police said was the work of an experienced hit_man . Koyama was in_charge of the bank ' s problem loans and bad_debts . More incidents that appeared to involve gang attacks on business targets came last week . In Tokyo , shots were fired at the home of Ryuhei Takashima , 75 , a former chairman of Asahi Mutual Life_Insurance Co . An executive_director of the firm had been assaulted outside his home by a man with a knife in July . Since summer , ultra-rightist groups -- which often function like gangs or have gangland ties -- have been staging a harassment campaign around Takashima ' s house over the firm ' s loan policies . The same day as the attack on Takashima ' s home , someone fired at an auto dealership and a restaurant in the southwestern city of Fukuoka . Police suspect the incidents may be related to September shootings in the nearby city of Kitakyushu that have been linked to an underworld group . These incidents are creating a new climate of fear among businessmen who come_into contact with gangsters as part of their work . &quot; We are likely to lose our lives if we try to cut our ties with criminal organizations and the sokaiy a , &quot; said an unnamed executive quoted by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper . &quot; But if we continue relations with them , we are likely to be arrested , thus destroying our careers . Either way , we have to put our lives on the line. &quot; Times researcher Megumi Shimizu in Tokyo contributed to this article .
