   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; THIS ATM IS NOT FOR SPENDING BUT SUPER-SPEED SIGNAL SENDING ; TELECOM : THE DATA TRANSFER SYSTEM_CALLED ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER MODE IS STILL UNPROVEN ON A LARGE SCALE IN THE REAL_WORLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When you cut_away all_the hype about the information highway , when you look beyond the glitzy interactive movies and games and home shopping services that will travel_along it , when you get_down to the nuts-and-bolts technology that will actually make_it happen , you find yourself staring at something called ATM . It isn ' t a bank machine -- though deploying it may yet break a_few bank_accounts . Nor , as one might expect , is it a well-proven , field-tested communications technology . Rather , Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode is a cutting-edge transmission technique that makes_it possible to send vast quantities of video , voice and computer data over the same circuits at extremely high speeds . ATM is considered so powerful that it ' s likely to be installed in everything from offices and airplanes to cable_television systems and public phone networks , forming the communications backbone of everything from massive interactive television_systems to modest corporate computer_networks . But there ' s one problem : It has not yet been demonstrated that ATM actually works reliably when deployed on a large scale in the real_world . And some interactive television pioneers , including Time Warner , are now learning a painful lesson about the gap between promises and reality in the demanding environment of public telecommunications . ATM is &quot; overhyped and underdeveloped today as a total solution for . . . interactive technologies , &quot; says Jim Barton , chief technology officer of Interactive Digital Solutions , a joint_venture between Silicon Graphics Inc. and AT &amp; T . &quot; We think we have invented an incredible amount of technology and new ways of doing things with ATM . But what we ' ve really done is just build the foundation . Now we have to go_back and put_in the floors and the walls around it. &quot; In principle , ATM offers crucial advantages over existing technologies : It can handle many different types of data -- including video , voice , and computer information -- simultaneously ; it can move them at very high speeds , and it can readily &quot; switch &quot; the traffic , as the telephone network does with regular voice traffic . There are plenty of solutions available for high-speed , point-to-point communications , but ATM , with its switching capabilities , offers far more flexibility . ATM networks , like the so-called packet-switched networks that have long been the technology of choice for computer data , operate by breaking streams of information into discrete chunks . The ATM &quot; cells &quot; each contain 53 bytes of information , and they are sent across the network at lightning speed -- up_to 100 times faster than most data flows on local_area_networks . The cells include routing information that tells the network where the data should be sent . At their destination , the cells are reassembled into their original components , ending_up as a picture on a TV screen , a phone_call or a fax . And this process of disassembly-transmission-reassembly happens so fast that the moving image -- or conversation -- is not disturbed . ATM networks can move data at speeds ranging from the standard 10 megabits-per-second of a local_area_network to as much as 240 times that speed , or 2.4 gigabits per second . Those numbers go_a_long_way toward explaining why so many companies view ATM as a total solution to their data communication needs -- and as the key to some novel new applications . Boeing Corp . is looking_at installing an ATM system in airplanes for in-flight entertainment ( with significant weight savings achieved by replacing copper cabling to each seat with light-weight fiber optics ) . The military is examining ATM for use in command-and-control networks on the battlefield . Movie studios are already putting casting portfolios and films into databases which eventually will become available through ATM networks . Communications and computer equipment vendors -- from giants like AT &amp; T to start-ups such_as networking pioneer Ralph Ungermann ' s First Virtual Corp . -- are racing to provide ATM equipment . Local and long distance telephone_companies , in addition to using ATM to make their networks more efficient , will offer ATM as a service for large customers that do not want to buy their own gear . But it is the cable_television industry that will likely prove , for better or worse , whether ATM is truly ready for prime_time . Cable companies have a huge investment in copper coaxial_cable which brings cable into people ' s homes , but their networks are essentially one-way video distribution systems . Now , they want to convert them into sophisticated two-way networks that can offer telephone_service and interactive television . The cable companies must find a way to offer these new digital services while continuing to deliver the high-quality television broadcasts , says David Tennenhouse , associate_professor of computer_science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . And they think ATM is the ticket . &quot; The cable industry is looking_at digitizing their transmission to design a new system from scratch , &quot; says Tennenhouse . &quot; ATM looks_like it will give them the flexibility to divide their bandwidth into whatever they need , be it voice , video or data. &quot; But there are problems . ATM is so new that even the basic electronic languages , or protocols , used to communicate between components of an ATM network aren ' t yet finalized . Thus , different carriers have created their own , proprietary ATM signaling protocols -- which may work to everyone ' s detriment in the long_run . Barton points_out that the ATM networks now being offered by AT &amp; T and Sprint are &quot; somewhat primitive. &quot; For example , he says , &quot; ATM service offered on Sprint may_not be compatible with ATM service offered on AT &amp; T. &quot; The ability to place an ATM call across a network composed of multiple carriers is crucial for many customers . Until a proposed signaling protocol , known as User Network Interface 3.1 , is finalized by the ATM Forum , a group of more_than 500 computer and communications companies , hooking one ATM switch to another ATM switch across distances will continue to be difficult and costly . And even if everything works right , none of it is cheap : ATM switches cost $ 150 # 000 and up , according to Kevin Beagley , an AT &amp; T spokesman . Costs for publicly available ATM service start at $ 4 # 850 per month in California . In Time Warner ' s much-heralded interactive television trial in Orlando , Time Warner and its primary technology supplier , Silicon Graphics , initially met with limited success because the three test homes involved early in the trial weren ' t actually using the system the way engineers and designers had anticipated , sources said . A variety of technical problems have delayed the full rollout of the Orlando trial by nearly a year . In general , the interactive field_trials of video on demand using ATM and other technologies have not gone as predicted , says Scott Stein , president of Applied Network Communications , a consulting group based in Silicon_Valley . &quot; Trial users are not ordering nearly the numbers of movies operators had expected . Furthermore , they are continuing to visit their neighborhood video outlets for video rentals , &quot; Stein says . As a result , the ATM networks may_not be the most efficient solution . &quot; ATM suffers from overoptimism in the short run and resultant over-expectations in terms of the net revenues available from the service , &quot; wrote Alan Mosher , a Portland-based consulting writer for BIS Strategic Decisions , in the September edition of 53 Bytes , the official newsletter of the ATM Forum . Still , many major customers are pressing ahead with ATM deployments . Time Warner insists that its technology is ready . &quot; There was some fine-tuning , but we are totally confident in our system today , &quot; said Tammy Lindsay , communications director for the Orlando project . ATM : Ready for Prime_Time ? ATM ( asynchronous_transfer_mode ) networks can carry many different kinds of data -- voice phone_calls , video and computer information , for example -- simultaneously at high speed . SERVICES : The various data streams are fed into the ATM switch , where they are broken_into small pieces for transmission over high-capacity phone_lines . They are then re-assembled at the other end -- all_in the blink_of_an_eye . * Interactive shopping * Videogame server * Reference server ( dictionary , encyclopedia ) * Interactive gambling * Medical imaging ( X-ray , EKG , etc. ) * Video on demand * Interactive television Users : The technology is considered crucial to the implementation of interactive television and a host of other new &quot; information superhighway &quot; services -- but some say it isn ' t ready yet . * Schools , colleges * Motion_picture studios * Homes * Offices</TEXT>
