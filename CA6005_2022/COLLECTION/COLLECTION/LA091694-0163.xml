   <HEADLINE> KING OF THE HILL ; UP AT CITYWALK , BLUES AND DELTA CUISINE SPICE UP B . B . KING ' S NEW MEMPHIS-STYLE CLUB .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Veteran bluesman Rufus Thomas stood on a terrace over the starkly modern courtyard at Universal CityWalk , a world away from his Memphis roots . &quot; Blues and barbecue , &quot; he mused on a recent summer afternoon . &quot; You like that ? &quot; Nothing about his surroundings suggested such fare . But one of Thomas ' best_friends , the legendary B . B . King , has opened a nightclub amid the tourist trappings at CityWalk . To step through the club ' s wood-and-glass doors is to step into another world . B . B . King ' s Blues Club looks_like an old opera_house with garish New Orleans touches , purple curtains and gold accents . Tables , walls and floors are fashioned of dark wood . The place has a close-up feel , with steep balconies that hover above a wide stage . On that stage , musicians like Thomas find a new home_in Los Angeles . The 499-seat house promises nightly blues and R &amp; B performances by local and touring acts . Every Sunday brings a Southern gospel brunch . All of this is accompanied by helpings of Mississippi Delta cuisine . &quot; Fried dill_pickles and catfish , &quot; King explained on a recent stop in town . &quot; We want it to be a good-time place. &quot; The club officially celebrates its debut with all-star performances Tuesday and Wednesday . &quot; B . B. ' s Birthday_Party &quot; will feature King himself , joined by unannounced musical guests . Bonnie Raitt and Mavis Staples , among others , have shown_up at his birthday_parties in previous years . Next week also marks the opening of Lucille ' s , an adjacent cafe named for the bluesman ' s trademark Gibson guitar . The 85-seat room will feature acoustic acts , the kind of music that King insists is &quot; the core of the blues and R &amp; B. &quot; What with the recent opening of the House of Blues in West Hollywood , this has been a good year for such music in Los Angeles . Long relegated to small clubs , it now rings from two shiny platforms . Still , King never intended to bring his act here . Several years ago , MCA recorded an album of live blues at a club he owns in Memphis and corporate_executives took a liking to the place . It stands on Beale Street , infamous for its juke joints and pawn shops , establishments that once harbored not only blues but illegal gambling . Underground tunnels that gamblers used to escape police raids still exist . King first gained prominence in this neighborhood . Arriving in Memphis with his guitar and $ 2.50 , he performed with Bobby Bland , Johnny Ace and Earl Forrest in a group called The Beale Streeters . Known by his given name , Riley B . King , he also worked as a disc_jockey and acquired the moniker &quot; Beale Street Blues Boy , &quot; which in time was shortened to &quot; Blues Boy &quot; and then to B . B . &quot; Beale Street was where it all started for me , &quot; King said . &quot; that ' s where it all came from. &quot; His club opened four years ago and quickly became a favored nightspot along that road . Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney have dropped_by . Bette Midler , recently in Memphis for a concert , climbed_on stage for an impromptu jam_session . So MCA asked King and managing partner Tommy Peters if they could duplicate the feat in Southern California . The CityWalk version offers as much of Memphis as the owners could muster . Woodworkers were flown west to construct the elaborate bars that serve each of the club ' s three floors . Black-and-white photographs honor such Memphis recording greats as Otis Redding , Al Green and Booker T . and the MGs . The walls on the second floor are painted the exact blue that graced the interior of the famous Stax Records studio . The heart of the place -- its music -- takes a cue from King , whose formative years in Memphis led him to blend traditional blues with jazz , pop and jump influences . On weeknights at his club , the house band works its eclectic way from John Lee Hooker to Aretha Franklin to Stevie Ray Vaughn . Local veteran Arthur Adams and Jeannie Holliday front the eight-piece group that infuses such music with the upbeat and brassy Memphis sound of blues and soul . The horn section keeps things joyful while singers engage the audience in call-and-response . This club lacks the size to attract top-name acts_on a consistent basis . Still , the_likes_of Maria Muldaur , Tinsley Ellis and Little Charlie and the Nightcats are scheduled to perform on weekend nights in the coming months . Sunday evenings will bring a rotating diet of Motown and New Orleans bands . And King will visit a half_a_dozen times each year . When he plays in Memphis , well-known guests often sit in . Above all , the club will try to maintain a loose feel . Clyde Avant , a master of ceremonies brought from the original club , warms the crowd with rapid-fire patter . The food -- be it the blackened catfish or the Louisiana gumbo -- is tasty and reasonably priced . When the waitresses and waiters find themselves with a spare moment , they drag customers onto a small dance_floor . &quot; This is not necessarily a concert_hall , it ' s a hangout , &quot; King said . &quot; We ' re not cool . We just want to have fun. &quot; Rufus Thomas couldn ' t agree more . The way he sees it , such casual good times were a long_time coming_in the land of hip . As he put it , &quot; You can ' t lose with the stuff we use. &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : B . B . King ' s Blues Club . Location : Universal CityWalk , Universal City .
