   <HEADLINE> TAXIWAY TOO WEAK FOR 727S , OFFICIALS SAY ; AIRPORT : SNAKEBIT BADGER FANS FINALLY GET TO GO_HOME . CHARTERED JET ' S OWNER SAYS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ORDERED PLANE ONTO THE ASPHALT VAN NUYS STRIP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A chartered jetliner sank into the asphalt at Van Nuys Airport -- a last-straw climax to the Rose Bowl visit of a planeload of irritated Wisconsin football fans -- because it had somehow taxied onto pavement too weak to support such a large plane , airport officials said Monday . The Boeing 727 , carrying 137 homesick Badger fans , got stuck because its landing_gear punched through thin pavement meant only for smaller planes , officials said . The question was : Why was it there ? The Dallas-based owner of the jet , Express One International , said that Federal Aviation Administration controllers in the tower of the city-owned airport directed the 727 to the location . &quot; Our pilots did not pick that route , &quot; said Stephen Thompkins , general counsel for Express One . &quot; It ' s not like a shopping_mall where you take your car and park it anywhere you can find . The control_tower told the aircraft to proceed to taxiway Echo , and that was the only way to get there . When the 727 suddenly started to sink , it was as much a surprise to our crew as anybody. &quot; The pilot immediately brought the jet to a stop and no one was hurt in the mishap , but the passengers had to be taken_off the plane , temporarily housed in a hotel , fed and then late Sunday night bused to Los Angeles International Airport . They finally left for Madison , Wis. , about 2:30 a.m. Monday aboard a replacement jet flown in from Minneapolis by the tour operator . If it is determined that the airport -- which is responsible_for maintenance of the asphalt strip -- is at_fault , the mishap could end_up costing the city a bit of money . The tour operator , Front Page Tours of Minneapolis , footed the bill for the replacement jet and other expenses caused by the delay . &quot; I ' m not sure at this time who will end of paying , &quot; said company President Dick Page . &quot; But we ' ll be talking to everyone involved. &quot; The airport mishap added insult to injury for the tour passengers , who began their weekend holiday in Los Angeles with the news that the Rose Bowl tickets they had been promised as part of their package would not be forthcoming . Angry government officials in Wisconsin have asked California state and federal_officials to investigate the situation that left fans with the unappetizing option of paying hundreds of dollars to buy game tickets from scalpers or watch their beloved team make its first Rose Bowl appearance in three decades on TV . Page said he was glad that his company had been contracted only for transportation and had nothing to do with the ticket foul-up . Officials said the boarding area used by the jet at Van Nuys Airport is owned by Peterson Aviation , which provides aircraft services and leases a part of the facility that usually has been used for airplanes and small jets . &quot; We basically didn ' t know they were going_to have anything as heavy as a 727 there , &quot; said airport manager Ron Kochevar . The airplanes and jets usually serviced by Peterson weigh about 6 # 000 to 75 # 000 pounds , Kochevar said , while a fully loaded Boeing 727 weighs about 160 # 000 pounds . The stretch of asphalt , which Kochevar described as a &quot; transitional area &quot; off the airport ' s taxiway , is only two to three inches thick . &quot; The trouble is , there is no base under it , &quot; as there is under the heavier-duty taxiways and runways , Kochevar said . The airport manager said the incident is under investigation , but believes that it is possible that tower controllers were never told by airport administrators that the transitional area could not handle a heavy jet .</TEXT>
