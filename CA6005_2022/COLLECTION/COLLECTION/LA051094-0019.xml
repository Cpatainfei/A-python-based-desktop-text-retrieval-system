   <HEADLINE> GOV . WILSON AND IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> George Skelton misses the point in his column ( May 2 ) when he argues that Gov . Pete Wilson is bashing the system , not immigrants . Although the governor ' s rhetoric on this issue has suddenly taken a turn toward moderation -- attributable to the efforts of organizations such_as Proponents for Responsible Immigration Debate and Education ( PRIDE ) -- he continues to frame the issue in a fashion that leads to immigrant bashing . The governor continues to insist that immigrants come for services and thus cost taxpayers money , and he continues to avoid the real pull factor : We provide jobs for immigrants and exploit their labor . The &quot; lure &quot; for immigrants is not education or emergency medical_care , but jobs that employers are more_than happy to provide . Thus , immigrants support our economy , not take_away from it . Indeed , one must ask what alternatives the governor proposes to eliminating these so-called &quot; lures. &quot; How can he prefer that children be_on the streets rather than in classrooms ? How can he support the denial of emergency medical and prenatal care that would lead to a deterioration of the public health ? ARTURO VARGAS , Vice_President Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , Los Angeles * * Regarding Skelton ' s column : As a non-Hispanic minority , I acknowledge myself as a bigot with the decency to overcome the stereotypes in this racially diverse state . Wilson ' s sick and tired choice of topic appalls me : Hearing the word &quot; border &quot; in his speech shows him as an anti-Hispanic opportunist . Can somebody tell Wilson that although Hispanics compose a substantial number of illegal immigrants , there are other nationalities ( Chinese , Filipino , Irish , to name a_few ) that are notorious for their illegal entry to the United States ? Illegal immigration is not the root of California ' s economic woes ; poor state funds management is . I ' m all for having the federal_government paying_for the housing illegal immigrants until they are shipped back to where they came from , but Gov . Wilson had more_than enough time to &quot; bash the system &quot; during his term . SARAH FOSTER-DOMINGO Tarzana * * The position taken by Wilson to sue the federal_government to pay_for what illegal immigration costs California may be unpopular , but it makes_sense . It is one of the functions of the federal_government to protect our borders . It is not doing so . I am not against immigration ( I migrated to this country myself ) but I am against unregulated and illegal immigration . Government officials may juggle their figures all they want to prove that illegal immigration has nothing to do with the financial plight of our cities , our counties , and our state ; I ( and many people like me ) do not believe them . We live_in this state and we can see that illegal immigration is one of the causes of our financial crisis . We are running_out of money at a time when we need more money than ever to combat a rising crime_rate not only by increasing police , building more prisons and stiffening sentences , but above all by improving education and creating new programs that will offer our youth opportunities to acquire marketable skills and become productive citizens ( rather than pushing dope or joining a gang ) . It is difficult to achieve these goals , but it will be a little easier and we will have more resources to allocate to our youngsters if we stop importing a good number of them from abroad .
