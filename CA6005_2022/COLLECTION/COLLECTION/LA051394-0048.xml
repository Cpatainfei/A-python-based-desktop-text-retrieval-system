   <HEADLINE> VICTIMS EMERGE AS KEY FORCE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first time Ralph Hubbard visited a prison , he sat alone in the parking_lot for half an hour , his stomach churning . Hubbard , 62 , a tough former cop , certainly knew criminals . But now he was facing them in a searing new role . When his only son was shot to death after a senseless argument over a videotape , he joined the swelling army of Americans who know helplessness , frustration and rage as victims of crime . After the murder , he punched a hole in a wall . He wept almost every day for eight months , alone , too proud to show his tears , on the top floor of his home_in Brooklyn . Eventually , Hubbard ' s anguish turned_to action . He became a board_member of Parents of Murdered Children of New York State , and that role brought him to Rikers Island , the world ' s largest detention center , with 14 # 800 inmates . &quot; I could never just stand and forgive the person , &quot; he told a prisoner who asked about his son ' s killer . &quot; I wanted to get my gun and go_out and find him and blow him away . But I had responsibilities . . . . I did not push that one button that would have made me go_over the line. &quot; Hubbard ' s meeting with the prisoners in the Rikers library -- a recounting of his tragedy designed to confront criminals with the carnage they cause -- is just one example of the activism of the crime victims movement in the United States . Just as Hubbard ventured where victims did not go a_few years ago , advocates for victims can now be found in courts , prosecutors ' offices , churches , hospitals , mental_health facilities and social_service agencies . In two decades the movement has grown to more_than 9 # 000 organizations with millions of members , ranging from Mothers Against Drunk Driving to the Family Violence Prevention Fund to Concerns of Police Survivors , which helps relatives of slain officers . In the process , victims-rights advocates have become a prime_mover in making crime the nation ' s No . 1 concern . They are the centerpiece of media focus_on the effects of crime . They are the most numerous voices for stiffer penalties . They are demanding -- and increasingly getting -- action from police , prosecutors , parole boards and politicians . &quot; Crime victims have one horrible badge -- credibility , &quot; said Jay Howell , a former prosecutor in Jacksonville , Fla. , who helped set_up the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children . &quot; The victims movement has shown . . . that it is increasingly well-organized , that it is mobilized , that it is motivated and that it has become a powerful force in passing legislation , &quot; said G . Morris Gurley , vice_president of the National Victim Center , a group dedicated to securing fair treatment for crime victims . And politicians are calling the groups , soliciting support . &quot; Suddenly , everybody is looking and saying : ' We ' ve got_to get_on the bandwagon , ' &quot; Gurley said . Reading the public ' s mood at the start of his reelection campaign , Gov . Pete Wilson presided at a crime summit with the mothers and fathers of murder victims . State_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , running to be his Democratic opponent , has also been conferring_with advocates for victims . New York Gov . Mario M . Cuomo , who is seeking a fourth term , has been meeting with victims groups and was the principal speaker at candlelight memorial services in Manhattan commemorating National Crime Victims Week . The city ' s new Republican mayor , Rudolph W . Giuliani , also spoke . President Clinton has taped a TV commercial against violence directed at children and met recently with a_few crime victims at the White_House . Administration members were highly visible at a conference on family violence sponsored in Washington by the American Medical Assn. , several foundations and victims rights organizations . Both Atty . Gen . Janet Reno and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala addressed the meeting with Shalala pledging : &quot; The President has shown his unwavering commitment to our cause. &quot; Heightened media focus_on victims , particularly by TV ' s &quot; reality &quot; shows , has added_to the national outrage over crime . TV producers are scrambling to find victims with gripping stories that can be converted to potentially high-ratings entertainment . &quot; There is a feeding frenzy , &quot; said Michael I . Rudell , a New York entertainment lawyer who represents TV personalities and producers . &quot; There is not only inter-network competition . There is intra-network competition between shows. &quot; The producers usually don ' t have to look very far . A murder occurs in the United States every 21 minutes , a robbery every 46 seconds and more_than one rape a minute . In 1992 , 23 % of U.S. households were victimized by a crime of violence or theft . &quot; Becoming a victim of crime makes victims want others not to have to experience what they did , &quot; said Anne K . Seymour , a longtime advocate for victims who has worked closely with the criminal-justice community . &quot; That is the strength of the victims movement. &quot; The movement began in 1963 when the government of New Zealand established the first victims compensation program . California started the first program in the United States two years later . During the 1960s , groups zeroed_in on the lack of victims rights in the criminal-justice system . Victims were not kept informed about court cases or notified about vital proceedings . They were forced to wait long hours -- sometimes in the presence of their attackers -- before testifying . Victims complained they had no voice in the filing of charges , plea-bargaining or sentencing . Lucy N . Friedman , executive_director of New York ' s Victim Services , the nation ' s largest victim-assistance organization , said : &quot; We would hear these horror stories about rape victims walking into a police_precinct and having the desk_sergeant yell : ' Would the victim of the rape last night come_forward ? ' We would hear the mother of a homicide victim saying that when she asked when the next adjournment was going_to be_on the case , the assistant district_attorney would say : ' Why do you want to know ? You weren ' t the victim or you weren ' t a witness to the crime. ' &quot; In more_than two decades , the victims movement has scored some notable successes . All 50 states now have compensation programs making direct payments to victims for such expenses as unpaid medical_bills , mental_health counseling and funeral costs . In 1984 , the Justice_Department set_up the Office for Victims of Crime to administer a fund to funnel money to state compensation programs . The office also makes direct grants to victim assistance organizations . Federal_courts and U.S. attorneys collect fines and other penalties from convicted criminals to pay_for the fund . Victims ' bills of rights ensuring dignified and respectful treatment , including the right to participate in key legal_proceedings , have been adopted by most states . All states now include some input from victims in sentencing , with at least 35 allowing victims to appear in court to make a statement before a judge renders a decision . At least 14 states have passed constitutional amendments that would guarantee victims the right to be present , informed and heard at all key stages of the criminal-justice process . Maryland , Idaho and Utah have such an amendment on the ballot this year . All U.S. attorneys and many district_attorneys have established victim assistance programs . Typically , they notify victims of the key steps_in their cases . The National Victim Center ' s legislative database has grown to 20 # 000 statutes , ranging from laws allowing child victims to provide testimony on videotape to up-to-the-minute information about the status of the state constitutional amendments . &quot; We have reached the point where the rules are_on the books , &quot; said David Beatty , the center ' s public affairs director . &quot; Now we are trying to ( win ) the hearts and minds of people charged with implementing those rules. &quot; But major problems still exist . Many state compensation funds face serious financial difficulties . Federal contributions vary from year to year , depending_on the amount of criminal fines collected , while the number of victims seeking money is rising . In New York state , a backlog of 17 # 000 claims exists , and the waiting period victims face for payment is about a year . While many judges throughout the nation order offenders to pay restitution , enforcement often is spotty and many convicted criminals don ' t pay . Meanwhile , victims organizations have branched_out , operating shelters and support groups for battered women , day-care centers in courts and student-mediation projects that try to prevent violence . They also train police_officers to be sensitive to victims ' needs and help hospital workers to detect signs of abuse . In some hospitals , advocates for victims seek_out new parents at high risk for child_abuse and provide continuing counseling when they go_home with their infants . Since August , 1986 , when 14 people were murdered at a post_office in Edmond , Okla. , organizations in the movement have sent trauma teams to the scenes of 65 disasters -- including plane crashes , floods , hurricanes , earthquakes and mass_murders -- to help both survivors and rescuers cope_with crisis . &quot; We train volunteers every year who are ready to go at a moment ' s notice , &quot; said Marlene Young , executive_director of the National Organization for Victim Assistance , a Washington group dedicated to victims rights and services . &quot; The victims movement has moved beyond its original goals , &quot; she added . &quot; Now we are focused not only on the direct victims of crime , but we also can recognize the impact on family members , friends and the community as a whole. &quot; That is partly why Hubbard made his trip to Rikers Island . Here was an opportunity to put a face on the consequences of violence , to humanize himself and underline his family ' s ordeal after the death of his son . As the prisoners -- some of them convicted murderers -- listened , Hubbard told them how his wife isolated herself in their Brooklyn home for months after the murder . He recounted how his eldest daughter found him , his eyes red from crying . &quot; ' You see these shoulders ? ' &quot; he recalled her asking . &quot; ' You made these shoulders so therefore you can cry on them. ' &quot; He told how his wife finally snapped out of her depression . He said he recalled to her an incident in which their son had eaten his own son ' s sandwich . With a straight_face , their grandson said the sandwich was part of his school science project and he had put four worms between the bread , which caused their son to throw_up . The story made his wife roar with laughter . &quot; She was_on her knees and holding her belly and she was just going nuts , &quot; Hubbard said . After that , he said , they stayed_up and hugged and talked most of the night , and when Hubbard woke_up the next morning his wife was gone . The phone rang . She was calling to say she was out having her hair and nails done . &quot; That was the breakthrough , &quot; he said . &quot; There are only one set of tear ducts in the human_body , &quot; he told the prisoners , &quot; tears of joy and tears of sorrow . Tears of joy are really large. &quot; Who Are the Victims of Crime ?
