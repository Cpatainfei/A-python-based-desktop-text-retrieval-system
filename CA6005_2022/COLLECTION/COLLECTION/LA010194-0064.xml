   <HEADLINE> GILL_NET FISHERMEN SEEK REPRIEVE FROM BAN ; ENVIRONMENT : THE LAW APPROVED THREE YEARS AGO TAKES_EFFECT TODAY , PUTTING SOME OUT OF WORK . A GROUP IS SEEKING THE INJUNCTION UNTIL A LAWSUIT IS HEARD IN APRIL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Andy Rasmussen will be out_of_work starting today . He has not quit his job , nor has he been fired . Rasmussen , a gill_net fisherman , lost his job by public vote . In 1990 , 55 % of Californians voted to ban gill_net fishing in a three-mile zone along the California coast . The law goes_into effect today . A coalition of environmentalists and sportfishermen backed the proposition because they said gill_nets , which are anchored to the ocean_floor and stretched like volleyball nets to trap fish , pose a threat to many marine mammals . Although Rasmussen and about 50 other fishermen who set their nets between Oxnard and Santa Barbara have had three years to prepare_for their last catch , most cannot fathom what they will do when their fishery is closed . &quot; I have no idea what ' s next , &quot; Rasmussen said . &quot; About 80 % of my income is destroyed . My business is pretty much gone . I ' ll probably be in an unemployment_line on the first of the year. &quot; The gill-netters are staking their hopes on a lawsuit that challenges the proposition on constitutional grounds . A San Diego Superior_Court judge is expected to rule Thursday on the gill-netters ' request for an injunction that could let them continue fishing , at least until the lawsuit is heard in April . But if the judge rules against them they will be devastated , the gill-netters say . The problem for the gill-netters is that they cannot make an easy transition to another method of fishing , said Tony West , president of the California Gillnetters Assn . Many , such_as Hank Hubble , one of about a dozen gill-netters based in Ventura Harbor , built their boats specifically for gill-netting . &quot; I put $ 60 # 000 into that boat , and this would basically make_it useless , &quot; Hubble said . &quot; I couldn ' t use it , and no one would want to buy_it . It would be a total loss. &quot; Although gill-netting will be permitted outside the three-mile_limit , most of the boats are too small to safely operate that far from shore during harsh weather . Gill-netters will find it difficult to switch to another type of gear because the state has imposed limits on the number of fishermen who can enter other fisheries , West said . &quot; I ' ll tell you what these guys are going_to do next year , &quot; West said . &quot; They ' re going to go broke. &quot; Sponsors of the proposition argued during the 1990 campaign that benefits of the ban far outweighed the harm that would come_to the state ' s gill_net fishermen . The proposition ' s author , Assemblywoman Doris Allen ( R-Cypress ) , said during the campaign that gill_nets were the equivalent of strip-mining the sea or clear-cutting the ocean . Gill_nets , she said &quot; are referred to as ' walls of death ' because they entangle and painfully kill thousands of mammals such_as whales , dolphins , sea_otters and sea_lions . More_than 100 species of sea life are affected. &quot; To help the fishermen recover from the loss of their industry , Allen created a fund that is to pay gill-netters to switch to less destructive gear . To date , only eight of the 136 fishermen who applied for compensation have collected money from the fund , and the gill-netters argue that many who deserve money will never receive it . That , West said , is because the proposition was worded so that compensation for gill-netters would be based on the average annual income they earned from 1983 through 1987 . &quot; The problem is that there are a number of the fishermen who didn ' t work all five of those years , &quot; West said . &quot; Nobody is going_to come_out of this with what they are supposed to be getting . . . . If they started fishing in 1988 , they don ' t get a dime. &quot; Tom Barnes , the Department of Fish and Game officer responsible_for doling out compensation , said he has had no choice in how the money was rationed . &quot; We ' re going by the letter of the law , &quot; Barnes said . Even those who have received money through the fund , which was established by adding a $ 3.15 stamp required on sportfishing licenses , say the amounts have been inadequate . The average amount given_out has been $ 18 # 000 , Barnes said . Although the earnings of the fishermen vary greatly , West said , the average yearly income for a gill-netter is $ 80 # 000 to $ 100 # 000 . The reason compensation is so low , West said , is that Fish and Game is only compensating fishermen for fish that they can prove were caught in the three-mile coastal zone . Hubble said the fishermen are just one link in a chain of people who will be hurt by the loss of business . The gill-netters , who fish mainly for halibut , angel_shark and other bottom_fish , sell primarily to local markets . Supporters of the proposition argued at the time that the loss of the gill-netters ' catch was not substantial -- they said it made_up less than 2 % of the fish sold in California . But each catch , Hubble said , goes_through a seafood distributor and several truckers and markets before it lands on someone ' s dinner_table . &quot; There are probably 10 different people who handle my fish once it leaves my boat , &quot; Hubble said . &quot; All of them are going_to be hurt by this. &quot; Meanwhile , consumers will be buying the same types of fish from different sources , said Steve Rebuck , vice_president of the American Seafood Harvesters Assn . &quot; People are just going_to have to pay more to get the same fish from other countries , &quot; Rebuck said . &quot; It really doesn ' t make much sense. &quot;</TEXT>
