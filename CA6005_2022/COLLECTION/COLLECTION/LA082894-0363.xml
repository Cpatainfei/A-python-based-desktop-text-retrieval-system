   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : NOW IS A GOOD TIME TO GET INTO FOREIGN BONDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American mutual_fund investors , most of whom have few if any foreign bond holdings , now have a good opportunity to get_into or add_to those positions . Global money managers say the sharp rise in interest_rates -- a surge precipitated by rising U.S. interest_rates as much as anything -- have made European bonds attractive . European yields have risen more_than U.S. yields , &quot; a scenario not justified by the economic fundamentals , &quot; says Philip Saunders , London-based portfolio manager of the new Guinness Flight Global Government_Bond Fund , whose marketing arm is headquartered in Pasadena . He cites 10-year German government_bonds , whose yields were 5.5 % on Jan . 1 but now pay about 7.3 % . French government_bonds with similar maturities have risen from 5.7 % to 7.9 % , and comparable British debt has increased from 6.3 % to 8.9 % . Yields on U.S. Treasury_bonds with 10-year maturities have risen less drastically , from about 5.9 % at the start of the year to about 7.3 % . Reflecting the increase in yields , the average world bond mutual_fund tracked by Morningstar Inc. of Chicago was off about 5.5 % for the year to date through July . that ' s on pace for the worst showing for the category since 1982 , one year after the first international bond fund made its debut . Investors who want to move_into the market can now use efficient and convenient foreign bond mutual_funds . The sharp price declines in Europe this year are partly explained by the five interest_rate increases engineered by the Federal_Reserve_Board since February . The Fed ' s actions snapped a multiyear global bull_market in bonds . Another factor that has worried investors is the likelihood of stronger economic_growth in Europe this year , which could translate into an inflationary burst . Contributing to the inflationary scare is the fact that most European governments are running budget_deficits . Sweden ' s and Italy ' s are particularly high , dwarfing even Washington ' s in percentage terms , says Jeff Tyler , portfolio manager of the Benham European Government_Bond Fund in Mountain View , Calif . But Saunders notes that Europe also has higher unemployment than the United States and is operating at lower industrial capacity . Those factors would tend to argue against an inflationary spike . Besides , the higher European interest_rates will in themselves tend to act_as a brake on economic_growth and inflation , notes Larry Teitelbaum , lead portfolio manager of the Scudder International Bond Fund in New York . The Scudder fund now has 70 % of its assets invested in European bonds , up from a normal weighting of 55 % to 60 % . &quot; We do feel European bonds are attractive , &quot; Teitelbaum says . However , investing in European bond markets does involve the considerable risk posed by currency fluctuations or the cost of hedging against them . Any weakening of European currencies against the dollar would eat_into the returns American investors earn on international bond funds . Conversely , a weaker greenback would increase returns in dollar terms . Teitelbaum and Saunders fear that , after the dollar ' s long slide against key European currencies , the next move will be up . Consequently , both have hedged their funds against the danger of a stronger dollar . Tyler , however , is not convinced that the dollar will rise , and he has the Benham fund completely unhedged at the moment . An interesting perspective on currency risk comes from Derek Sasveld , a consultant at Ibbotson Associates in Chicago , who argues that investors should favor unhedged foreign mutual_funds . Foreign bond investments can actually enhance overall returns and reduce risk when combined with a purely U.S. bond portfolio , Sasveld says . that ' s because these investments tend not to move closely in sync with U.S. bonds over time . &quot; A large portion of the diversification benefit comes from the currency play , &quot; Sasveld says . Besides , it costs money to hedge a foreign bond portfolio , and this extra outlay will add_to a fund ' s expense ratio . * But there is a limit to the diversification benefit a foreign bond fund can add_to a portfolio . Sasveld suggests placing no more_than 25 % to 30 % of your overall holdings in international investments . Of that , foreign stock funds should account_for roughly 17 % to 20 % , foreign bond funds the remaining 8 % to 10 % . That isn ' t a particularly high stake to risk in overseas bond markets , particularly with European yields now much richer than they were at the start of the year . &quot; European bonds aren ' t a screaming buy , but I think they will hold their values better than U.S. bonds , &quot; Tyler says . * Balanced portfolios -- mutual_funds that hold both stocks and bonds -- are flirting_with their worst year since the 1970s . On average , they were down 2.2 % from January through July of 1994 , Morningstar Inc. reports . * But investors shouldn ' t give_up on the balanced approach , says Douglas D . Ramos , co-manager of the Boston-based New England Balanced Fund , which has held_up better than most . An unusually bad bond market earlier in the year explains the category ' s poor showing , he says . Ramos , who works in Pasadena , doesn ' t think the declines will persist . He sees stable bond prices and flat to higher stock prices by early 1995 . &quot; Long-term , balanced funds should return 8 % to 9 % a year , &quot; he says . That assumes a typical 60-40 stock-bond split . Because of their greater diversification , balanced funds offer more upside potential without much additional volatility compared to a pure bond portfolio for investors willing to hold at least three years , Ramos points_out . * Retail securities brokers earned median pay of $ 90 # 000 last year , an amount that easily eclipsed the previous record of $ 78 # 200 set_in 1992 , reports the Securities Industry Assn . of New York . It was the fifth consecutive year of higher compensation . Brokers who cater to institutional clients generated median 1993 earnings of $ 183 # 200 , also a record and also the fifth consecutive yearly increase . That was up from 1992 pay of $ 156 # 000 . Mutual_funds have been a growing compensation source for many brokers in recent years , but the SIA report doesn ' t disclose their effect on yearly pay .</TEXT>
