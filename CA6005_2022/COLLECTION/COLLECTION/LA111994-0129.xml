   <HEADLINE> EX-SEN . CARPENTER EXTRADITED TO U.S. ; CRIME : FIGHTING CANCER , FORMER LEGISLATOR LOSES FINAL LEGAL BATTLE TO AVOID BEING RETURNED FROM COSTA RICA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After languishing for months in a Costa Rican jail , fugitive former state Sen . Paul Carpenter was_on his way back to California and a possible sentence of up_to nine years in prison Friday on political corruption charges . Carpenter , who is suffering from advanced prostate cancer , lost the last legal skirmish in his battle to avoid extradition . The Democratic politician was taken_in handcuffs from his hospital_bed , driven to the airport and turned_over to U.S. Consul General Ken Sackett . Accompanied by two U.S. deputy marshals from Florida , he boarded a flight for Miami , where he will spend the weekend in a local jail . On Monday , deputies from the U.S. marshal ' s office in Sacramento will take custody of the onetime legislator and state Board of Equalization member and escort him back to California . In Sacramento , Carpenter will be given a complete medical_exam and will be brought before U.S. District Judge Edward J . Garcia for sentencing , perhaps as early as next week . In a recent interview at Costa Rica ' s largest public hospital , Carpenter said his cancer was spreading and he had only 15 months to live . He had asked authorities to delay his extradition so he could undergo surgery , but on Tuesday he lost his last appeal . At the airport Friday , the 66-year-old politician was dressed in a pink and blue polo_shirt and baggy blue_jeans . It was clear that his health has been failing : Beneath a thick gray beard that he has grown since his arrest , his face had become gaunt , his skin ashen . He has lost considerable weight since he was apprehended by Costa Rican authorities and jailed pending extradition . However , U.S. Atty . Charles J . Stevens in Sacramento said that medical authorities in Costa Rica said Carpenter was fit to travel . After his conviction in December on 11 counts of mail_fraud , obstruction of justice and money_laundering , Carpenter was released without bail . He disappeared before he could be sentenced in February , leaving a note to the judge that said : &quot; I find my drive for survival stronger than my sense of obligation to your legal system. &quot; U.S. officials located him at a hotel in San Jose , traveling under the alias Paul Bruce -- using his middle name as his surname . But he left the hotel before the paperwork was completed to enable Costa Rican police to make an arrest . He was finally tracked_down and apprehended in April at a suburban condominium he shared with another U.S. expatriate , but until Friday he had managed to fight extradition through a series of legal maneuvers . American officials thought that the_matter was settled more_than a week ago and deputy marshals flew here Nov . 8 to transport him back . However , Carpenter ' s attorneys were able to delay his extradition one more time by filing additional appeals , claiming that he was a political_prisoner and seeking a delay so that he could undergo surgery . U.S. Atty . Stevens has said he has no plans to pursue charges against Carpenter for unlawful flight . Free-lance reporter Brian Harris reported from San Jose , Times staff writer Paul Jacobs from Sacramento .</TEXT>
