   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; DIGGING_UP BLASTS FROM THE PAST ; IN CALIFORNIA , MORE VICTORS -- AND VICTIMS -- ARE FEELING THE EFFECTS OF ' OPPOSITION RESEARCH. ' THE GOVERNOR ' S RACE WILL SHOWCASE THE POWER OF PROBING CANDIDATES ' POLITICAL AND PRIVATE LIVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In baseball , it ' s scouting . In war , it ' s spying . In politics , it ' s called opposition research . You will not hear much about it from candidates themselves , but the California gubernatorial race promises to be a showcase for the age-old practice of digging into the public -- and private -- lives of political rivals . Just ask Darry Sragow , who is running state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi ' s campaign_for_governor . Sragow is collecting &quot; everything I can find_out &quot; about Treasurer Kathleen Brown , whom Garamendi faces in the June 7 Democratic primary . &quot; It ' s the motto of the Scouts , &quot; Sragow said . &quot; Be prepared. &quot; Garamendi is in good company . After years of lagging behind Republican research efforts , the state Democratic Party has amassed a database on Gov . Pete Wilson so his opponents can , in one party official ' s words , &quot; move quickly when a weakness appears. &quot; This month , when Brown asked fellow candidates to join her in pledging to run a &quot; no-negative &quot; gubernatorial race , she did not mention that her campaign had already spent thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours delving into her opponents ' vulnerable spots . Her political gumshoe : Ace Smith , whose clients have included a presidential hopeful named Bill_Clinton . Wilson ' s camp has built a fat file on Garamendi and an even fatter one on Brown -- an effort made easier by the fact that Joseph D . Rodota , who did opposition research on Brown during her 1990 bid for treasurer , is now Wilson ' s Cabinet secretary . In one form or another , opposition research has been part of the rough and tumble nature of democracy since the first election . Today , rapidly improving campaign techniques and communications technology have made research more crucial than ever . Campaign professionals say that to stay competitive they must start research earlier , be able to access it more quickly and package it in a dizzying array of sophisticated formats , from a television sound_bite to an &quot; attack facsimile. &quot; &quot; You ' ll be accused of malfeasance if you don ' t do opposition research , &quot; said Allan Hoffenblum , a Los Angeles-based Republican consultant . &quot; It ' s part of the game. &quot; Campaigns , it is said by those who run them , are won or lost in the library . Information is power , and when that power is unleashed in a focused way the results can be devastating . One recent contender whose dreams were dashed by an opponent who did his homework : Orange County Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder , whose front-running bid for Congress in 1988 was derailed after the college degree she listed in her campaign literature was found to be nonexistent . And who can forget former television commentator Bruce Herschensohn , whose 1992 U.S. Senate bid ended on a sour note after a Democratic Party official revealed that the Republican had visited a nude dance club ? Among opposition research specialists , almost everyone agrees on the craft ' s basic tenets : Start early . Be accurate . Investigate your own candidate as painstakingly as you do their opponents . Most professional researchers distance themselves from the kind of dirt-digging that was used against Herschensohn . Their preferred hunting_ground is the vast and varied public record -- resumes and campaign finance reports , committee votes and newspaper_clippings . Their quarry : flip-flops and contradictions , unkept promises and outright lies . But when it comes_to the nitty-gritty of political snooping -- What information is relevant ? Is anything off limits ? -- there are no hard and fast rules . &quot; It ' s a very slippery area , &quot; said one campaign official . Another political veteran , asked to draw_the_line between what is scrupulous and what is sleazy , said bravely : &quot; It depends. &quot; &quot; So_much in politics is situational ethics . It ' s right or wrong , good or evil depending_on whose ox is being gored , &quot; Hoffenblum said . &quot; A negative campaign is when they ' re talking_about you . A truthful campaign is when you ' re talking_about them. &quot; Opposition research was used to powerful effect during the last gubernatorial race when Wilson , then a U.S. senator , faced former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein . Insiders still talk_about the summer of 1990 , when Wilson ' s information gathering team , in the words of one begrudging Democrat , &quot; neutralized their biggest negative right off the bat. &quot; Feinstein was_on the attack , airing a television ad that skewered Wilson for accepting thousands of supposedly tainted dollars in contributions from the savings and loan industry . Coming at a time when then-U.S. Sen . Alan Cranston ' s ties to the S &amp; L industry were front-page news , the ad could have caused major damage . Instead , Wilson ' s team used research to turn a vulnerable point into a non-issue . Immediately , his camp aired an ad that accused Feinstein ' s husband , Dick Blum , of owning an interest in a failed S &amp; L in Oregon . Feinstein fought_back , accusing Wilson of telling the &quot; big lie &quot; and noting that Blum ' s interest amounted to 0.25 % of the thrift ' s assets . But the mission was accomplished : the S &amp; L issue -- what some had seen as Wilson ' s Achilles ' heel -- was a soft_spot Feinstein could no longer afford to poke . The man behind this coup , Rodota , has since closed his Sacramento-based opposition research firm , Benchmark Research . Campaign staffers insist that his role in Wilson ' s Administration prevents him from playing anything but an advisory role in their research efforts . But he may always be known by the nickname his colleagues gave him during the 1990 race : &quot; Dr. Death. &quot; When then-Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley ran_for governor in 1982 , rival George Deukmejian ' s campaign was alarmed to discover that Bradley had significant support in the San Joaquin Valley . &quot; I was going nuts -- there was no way Bradley was going_to be a friend of farmers , &quot; said Ken Khachigian , a Republican political consultant and a close Deukmejian adviser . So Khachigian started digging , searching for something -- anything -- to prove his point . He found it in a newspaper clipping : In 1973 , Bradley had nominated United Farm_Workers founder Cesar Chavez for the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot; In the ag ' community , that was death , &quot; Khachigian recalls happily . And what made the discovery even sweeter was that the tidbit made a perfect one-liner . ( Khachigian ' s rule_of_thumb : &quot; If you can ' t reduce it to a 3-by-5 index card , something ' s wrong. &quot; ) &quot; If you liked Jerry Brown , you ' ll love Tom Bradley , &quot; began the index card that Khachigian distributed to farmers throughout the state . The card mentioned Bradley ' s nomination of Chavez and added this footnote : &quot; Cesar Chavez ( has ) said that California ' s growers are ' bad people. ' He added : ' I hate them. ' &quot; The card ' s flip side described Deukmejian as &quot; an advocate , supporter and friend of California agriculture. &quot; Statewide and nationally , Republicans have long had the upper_hand in the cutthroat research wars . The Republican National Committee ' s opposition research unit , created by the late committee Chairman Lee Atwater , is credited with helping to demolish then-Massachusetts Gov . Michael S . Dukakis during his presidential bid in 1988 . One of the weapons that research wrought : Willie Horton , a felon who murdered a man and raped his companion while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison . In television ads that described Horton ' s misdeeds , George_Bush ' s campaign portrayed Dukakis as being soft_on crime . During the 1992 presidential election , however , Clinton ' s advisers helped the Democrats make_up lost ground . And California ' s Democratic Party got busy too . &quot; In the past , after the primary we would say : ' Oh , let ' s do research. ' . . . We were weak and everybody knew it . But now it ' s a whole new ballgame , &quot; said Bob Mulholland , who was political director of the state Democratic Party when the approach to information_gathering underwent a sea change beginning in 1992 . Under the chairmanship of Phil Angelides and now Bill Press , the party set_out to get the goods on Republicans that could make a difference on Election_Day . The 1994 governor ' s race will be the most important test of that new system , and the party is taking its anti-Wilson effort very seriously . Employing up_to 10 people at a time to pull court records and hunt_down committee votes , the party has collected piles of data , &quot; triaged &quot; it to determine what is usable and organized it via computer to make_it instantly accessible . &quot; We have moved the party into the 21st Century , &quot; executive_director Susan Kennedy said . Already , that effort has begun to pay_off , she said . In December , after Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders suggested that legalizing drugs deserves study , Wilson called_for her resignation . Within 15 minutes , the state Democratic Party was sending_out attack faxes with &quot; proof &quot; of what Kennedy calls the governor ' s &quot; blatant hypocrisy. &quot; In 1970 , when he was an assemblyman , Wilson introduced and carried legislation that required police , in certain situations , to release arrested people who were under the influence of drugs . Moreover , Wilson in 1968 co-authored a measure that reduced the first possession of marijuana from a felony to a misdemeanor . &quot; The object is to be able to respond or launch something in the same news cycle , &quot; Kennedy said . Failure to pounce on an opponent ' s weakness -- or , worse , failure to respond to a rival ' s attack -- &quot; is the kind of thing that can destroy a candidacy . You have to be able to defend yourself without delay. &quot; That , Brown campaign staffers say , is precisely the reason the 48-year-old Democrat is assembling opposition research -- despite what they describe as her sincere desire to run a positive campaign . &quot; We have to do_it , &quot; said Michael Reese , Brown ' s campaign spokesman . &quot; They have it . We need it . We must at least be prepared_for the coming battle because we don ' t know what tactics are going_to be used , what weapons will come_into play . Foolish would be the candidate who didn ' t prepare . . . for this war. &quot; Indeed , the only major gubernatorial candidate who insists he is doing no opposition research is state Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , who has raised the least money and says he does not expect to win . In addition to shoring_up her defenses , Brown has begun a little informational target_practice as well . This month , an item appeared in a San Francisco newspaper ' s political column under the headline , &quot; Garamendi Flip-Flop. &quot; It noted that while Garamendi told a Los Angeles radio_station he had believed_in the death_penalty &quot; for all_of my life , &quot; he had opposed capital_punishment early in his political career . Sragow , Garamendi ' s campaign manager , conceded the error . But he was quick to note that although Brown was not identified as the source of the tidbit , he saw her fingerprints all_over it : &quot; Kathleen Brown ' s people love to talk_about things that happened back when people were wearing leisure suits. &quot; Reese , Brown ' s spokesman , acknowledges that they planted the story . &quot; Part of opposition research is knowing what ' s out there and being able to point reporters in the right direction , &quot; he said . Indeed , the leaking of hot tips to the media is a common campaign technique , although reporters do not always bite . As eager as some campaigns are to leak the fruits of their research , they are often reluctant to talk_about the process itself . When asked to describe Brown ' s effort , Reese was initially terse : &quot; Yes , we do opposition research . that ' s it. &quot; Dan Schnur , Wilson ' s campaign spokesman , first greeted inquiries about Wilson ' s research effort with a stab at deadpan humor . &quot; We have no need for opposition research because we intend to run_on Pete Wilson ' s record , &quot; he said , adding a moment later : &quot; I thought I ' d give ( that answer ) a try. &quot; The topic that really makes political professionals wary is private_investigators . Most campaigns , fearing the stigma that a cloak-and-dagger , garbage-sifting private_eye might bring_to their candidate , say they do not hire sleuths -- although a_few acknowledge that they know of others who do . However , Harry F . Block , a Newport Beach private_detective , says &quot; it happens all_the time. &quot; &quot; I ' ve done governors in different states and more_than one political figure here in Southern California , &quot; said Block , who added that he is often asked to look_for undeclared gifts , misappropriated government funds and , the latest hot-button issue , instances of sexual_harassment . Not that he always knows exactly whom he ' s working for . &quot; Of course , they don ' t want to be ' in it. ' So you get your money and your instructions somewhere else . But when you get_into it , you know damn well who ' s behind it , &quot; he said , recalling one assignment he got from a lawyer in San Jose . &quot; He gave me my instructions . . . . But what does a lawyer in San Jose care about an Illinois senator ? &quot; Block said he is not involved in the California governor ' s race . Campaigns never use every fact they gather . Sometimes the information they have in reserve is deemed too sensitive or irrelevant . Certain topics -- particularly ones dealing with a candidate ' s sexual proclivities -- are difficult to raise gracefully . Many a tawdry detail has been junk-piled for fear of a campaign backfire . That is why Herschensohn ' s eleventh-hour embarrassment has been so controversial . Four days after the Republican was confronted with a huge photograph of the Seventh Veil , a nude dance club he later admitted he had visited , Barbara Boxer was elected to the U.S. Senate . Mulholland , the Democratic official who waved the photo in Herschensohn ' s face at a campaign stop in Chico , said that issue was relevant because Herschensohn had made family values a foundation of his campaign . But others tried to distance themselves from Mulholland ' s activities , and today Mulholland tries to draw a distinction between opposition research and the dirt he dug_up about Herschensohn -- an investigation he characterizes as &quot; a total sidebar to research. &quot; &quot; Research is public policy stuff . . . . People ' s personal lives should remain personal and most of what I call ' the beyond the public record stuff ' should not be used , &quot; he said . &quot; But when ( a Republican ) gets_up there and starts preaching to me , they better be careful. &quot; Khachigian , who was Herschensohn ' s campaign manager , calls this &quot; the faulty logic of hit_men and toadies. &quot; Boxer and top Democratic_party officials can say they knew_nothing about Mulholland ' s stunt , Khachigian said , but he is not buying_it . &quot; Having participated in this little rancid episode , Angelides , Mulholland , Barbara Boxer and all_the rest have to pay the penalty , &quot; Khachigian said . &quot; Forever more I get_to attach ( the words ) ' sleaze and smear ' to what they did. &quot; Sometimes , aggrieved candidates get_to do more_than that . Former Los Angeles County Assessor Alexander Pope will never forget the morning in 1978 when his opponent , a tax agent named Frank Hill ( no relation_to the state_senator ) , held a news_conference accusing him of resisting arrest in a Sacramento bar . Within hours , an embarrassed and apologetic Hill was back before the cameras . Closer inspection of police files had shown that Alexendera Pope -- a 27-year-old woman -- was the culprit . &quot; They had waited until ( five days ) before the election . . . . They just figured there was no way I could respond , &quot; Pope said . But respond he did . After Pope won the election , he sued Hill for libel and won . When Hill paid_up , Pope donated the $ 15 # 000 judgment to the League of Women Voters . Researching the Opposition For months , researchers have been sorting through voting histories , court records , political fund-raising and campaign literature in search of discrepancies , flip-flops and errors . The Times asked several political consultants -- not employed in this year ' s governor ' s race -- what they would look_for in the backgrounds of the major contenders . Gov . Pete Wilson -- Lots to analyze in Wilson ' s decades of public_service as a state legislator , San Diego mayor and U.S. senator , but what he has done -- and not done -- as governor will be the meat and potatoes of the research effort . Of particular interest is anything inconsistent with Wilson ' s current stands on hot-button issues such_as crime and illegal immigration . Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi -- Like Wilson , Garamendi has a lengthy public record beginning with his 1974 election to the Assembly . Opponents will pore over Garamendi ' s record as the first elected insurance commissioner as well as his unsuccessful 1982 run_for governor . Republican researchers will scrutinize Garamendi ' s lengthy legislative record looking in particular for liberal votes . State_Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- Brown ' s shorter history of public_service will force researchers to rely more_than usual on newspaper_clippings and correspondence . Brown ' s five years on the Los Angeles Unified School_Board will be analyzed because education is central to her campaign . Her four years as state_treasurer will also be scrutinized , as will her substantial fund raising . State Sen . Tom Hayden -- Opponents are unlikely to spend a lot of effort researching Hayden . &quot; His life_story is an open book , &quot; said one insider , referring to Hayden ' s history of civil_rights and anti-war activism and his former marriage to actress Jane Fonda . Hayden ' s many years in Sacramento and in politics also could provide campaign fodder , particularly anything at_odds with his reform agenda .</TEXT>
