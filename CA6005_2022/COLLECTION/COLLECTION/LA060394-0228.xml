   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO PRESS U.N. FOR SANCTIONS ON N . KOREA ; DIPLOMACY : ATOMIC AGENCY SAYS IT CANNOT DETERMINE IF REACTOR FUEL WAS DIVERTED IN 1989 FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The International Atomic Energy Agency declared on Thursday that its ability to tell whether North_Korea diverted reactor fuel to make nuclear_weapons in 1989 has been &quot; seriously eroded , &quot; and President Clinton said the United States would press the United Nations to enact sanctions . While the President is traveling in Europe , special U.S. negotiator Robert L . Gallucci is scheduled to meet with South_Korean and Japanese envoys today and Saturday to hammer_out a proposal on sanctions , officials said . But there were fresh indications the effort to punish Pyongang may prove difficult . Both China and Russia repeated Thursday that , despite North_Korea ' s actions , they are not yet prepared to support a resolution imposing economic sanctions . Thursday ' s decision ends 15 months of maneuvering between the U.N.-affiliated atomic_energy agency and North_Korea . Pyongyang initially invited the agency ' s inspectors to its Yongbyon reactor , then barred them entirely and finally allowed them access only to part of the site . As a result , while the inspectors have confirmed that North_Korea is not now diverting spent fuel rods to make nuclear_weapons , they have been unable to say whether it did so during an earlier reactor shutdown in 1989 . That issue is important because U.S. intelligence agencies suspect that North_Korea may have used the spent fuel to build one -- or possibly two -- nuclear_weapons . If North_Korea does have a nuclear bomb , it could threaten Japan and the rest of Asia . At the same time , North_Korea has warned repeatedly that it would regard the imposition of sanctions as an act of war , raising fears in some quarters that the North might initiate military_action against South_Korea . U.S. military authorities said Thursday that they have not put American forces in the region on alert , partly to avoid any actions that might be deemed provocative . But the Pentagon is considering scaling back a fleet exercise to leave ships available in case of hostilities , they said . The atmosphere at the United Nations was increasingly tense . The Security_Council is expected to meet informally to discuss the issue as early as today . But diplomats cautioned that the 15-nation body likely will not get_around_to firm action until late next week after members reach agreement on a measure that can be passed_by a clear majority . It was not immediately clear just how much the continuing reluctance of China and Russia to go_along with sanctions would hurt the American effort in the United Nations . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin told reporters in Moscow that imposing sanctions now would be premature . But he warned that &quot; if North_Korea takes a stubborn stance , &quot; eventually &quot; we will be forced , step by step . . , to resort_to international sanctions. &quot; In Beijing , Chinese spokesman Shen Guofang took a similar tack , warning that resorting_to sanctions now &quot; might sharpen the confrontation. &quot; But neither Russia nor China indicated whether they would veto a Security_Council resolution imposing sanctions . A senior American official traveling with Clinton in Rome said the President was trying to arrange a telephone_conversation with Yeltsin to discuss the issue . The official also conceded that Washington is uncertain how quickly or how forcefully it could get the Security_Council to act . That &quot; will depend_on the nature of discussions that we ' re engaged in , &quot; he said . &quot; We simply will have to see. &quot; The job facing the international inspectors has been complex . The standard method by which the agency ' s experts tell whether a country is diverting spent nuclear fuel for weapons is to test fuel rods in a reactor . Telling whether spent fuel had been diverted in previous years -- such_as in 1989 , when analysts believe North_Korea may have begun making a bomb -- is more difficult . To do so , the inspectors must measure how fuel rods in various parts of the reactor have been used_up . The task was complicated substantially a_few weeks ago when Pyongyang announced to the West ' s surprise that it would begin shutting_down its reactor immediately and start removing the spent fuel rods well ahead of schedule -- much faster than the atomic_energy agency had expected . North_Korea removed the rods at such a rapid pace that the inspectors were unable to determine if any of the spent fuel had been diverted during the 1989 shutdown -- leaving the West still uncertain whether Pyongyang has a bomb . Hans Blix , director of the International Atomic Energy Agency , said in a letter Thursday that the agency still might be able to find clues to what North_Korea did_in 1989 by testing materials at two remote waste sites . But Pyongyang refused inspectors access to those areas 15 months ago . As a result , Blix said , the ability of the Vienna-based agency to measure the fuel rods in accordance with international standards -- and to verify the accuracy of North_Korea ' s claim that it does not have nuclear_weapons -- has been &quot; seriously eroded &quot; and essentially has been lost . Blix is expected to travel_to New York to confer_with U.N. officials as early as today . But officials said that the agency ' s board of governors is scheduled to meet in Vienna on Monday and he may delay the trip until Tuesday . The Clinton_Administration lost no time in beginning its push for sanctions . Senior officials were busy contacting their counterparts in Britain , France , China and Russia -- the other permanent Security_Council members -- to discuss the timing of the move . Washington hoped to work simultaneously with South_Korea and Japan this weekend and to discuss the issue with America ' s major European allies while Clinton is overseas . Officials said that debate in the Security_Council on the issue could come_on Monday . Times staff writers John Broder in Rome , Carey Goldberg in Moscow and Rone Tempest in Beijing contributed to this report .</TEXT>
