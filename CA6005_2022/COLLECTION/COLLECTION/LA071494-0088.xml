   <HEADLINE> THE COLLECTORS ; BIPIN DESAI : ALL THE WORLD ' S A TASTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One might assume that particle physicists talk_about nothing but quarks and bosons and such . But Bipin Desai , a professor of theoretical physics at the University of California Riverside , got a surprise when he visited a nuclear research_center on the French-Swiss border in 1965 . &quot; I was a vegetarian and a teetotaler , &quot; says Desai between sips of an old Vouvray at Mario ' s , his favorite Riverside Italian spot , &quot; and all_the particle physicists talked_about was wine and food. &quot; This happened when Desai was in his late 20s . He was the youngest of five children of a wealthy Bombay family , and to that point , he had never had a sip of wine . Later on that trip , dining with a close friend , Desai and his wife , Blaire , ventured into foreign gastronomic territory : meat and red_wine . &quot; And what I found_out was , I liked it , &quot; he says . Desai immediately bought a copy of &quot; Harry Waugh ' s Wine Diary , &quot; written by the director of Chateau Latour . He read about the greatness of the 1961 Bordeaux . &quot; I ' m a very passionate person about certain subjects , &quot; says Desai , who ' s also a fan of movies and jazz , &quot; so I decided to buy some of the 1961s . Obviously , I bypassed all_the cheaper wines. &quot; While seeking_out wines from a great vintage from great chateaux , he bumped_into Ed Lazarus , then a young Los Angeles wine collector . They became friends , trading stories of fine wines tasted . A wine tasting staged around that time by Dr. Robert Borrelli , a professor at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont , prompted Desai to join Les Amis Du Vin , a national wine society that stages tastings . &quot; My wife encouraged me to join , &quot; he says . &quot; She said that tasting the wines before we buy them was pivotal , and she was right. &quot; By 1980 , Desai was building a large collection of rare old wines , though it was an increasing strain on his budget . He came from a wealthy family of Indian diamond merchants , but the wine lifestyle he wished to pursue was still beyond his means . Then , in 1982 , he hit on an idea that he admits was audacious , but which turned him into a front-rank wine collector . He wrote to some of the world ' s top wine professionals , including the esteemed Waugh , and announced he was going_to stage a massive , three-day tasting of 131 Bordeaux from the 1961 vintage at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel . The event not only sold_out but generated tremendous publicity . Instantly Desai saw that by staging such tastings , he would gain the gratitude of wine collectors who don ' t have many wines and become a conduit for French producers who wished to stage such publicity-generating events in Los Angeles . Over the years , using his own collection as a base , Desai has staged 35 such extravaganzas at such restaurants as Valentino , Citrus , Spago , Patina , Yujean Kang , Opus and a dozen other wine-oriented restaurants . Desai says even with ticket prices ranging from $ 100 to $ 2 # 000 , these events are not very profitable , but they rarely lose money either because the price is calculated to cover the cost of the wines . Early in the game , Los Angeles attorney Manny Klausner and his wife , Willette , who are prominent in food and wine circles , recommended that Desai do the tastings in the context of a fine meal , rather than as a traditional cheese-and-cracker wine tasting . Desai usually reserves the restaurant for lunch on a Saturday or Sunday and has the chef prepare a set menu , the price of which is included in the tasting . &quot; I ' d love to do dinners , &quot; he says , &quot; but when you do lunch you can get the entire restaurant. &quot; Desai says staging a tasting doesn ' t take much time . He simply comes_up with an idea ( such_as multiple vintages of Chateau Pichon-Longueville ) from the wines he and his friends have in their cellars and writes to the chateau to see whether it will participate . ( Few say no , and most contribute wines not already in his cellar. ) Today , his wine is stored in temperature-controlled public facilities in Riverside . Surprisingly , the inventory list is not computerized . It is kept_in a wire-bound booklet in which Desai writes additions and corrections . Unlike many collectors , Desai has scarcely any full cases of wine , let alone multiple cases . The inventory list shows three bottles of this , four of that . There aren ' t many giant-sized bottles , either . Some years ago , Desai obtained an import license so he could more easily get certain rare wines , some of which he makes available to restaurants and a small coterie of collector friends . He also stages small , private dinner / tastings for groups of younger collectors as well . Over the years , Desai has participated in private tastings of the tiny Order of the Purple Palate , a private group of local collectors who gather occasionally to pour fine wines for each other . Theoretical particle physics still occupies the bulk of Desai ' s time ( he has just published a significant scientific paper on black_hole analysis ) , but a much more earthly subject is gaining him a greater share of headlines .
