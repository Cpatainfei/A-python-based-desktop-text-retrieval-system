   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A ; SEC CUTS_OUT PLAN TO ALLOW MUTUAL_FUND BUYS VIA ' OFF-PAGE ' COUPONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprise reversal , a much ballyhooed proposal to allow investors to buy mutual_funds directly through detailed advertisements has been indefinitely tabled , Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr . revealed Thursday . So-called off-the-page advertising , which parts of the fund industry have pushed for years , would have allowed individuals to buy no-load funds by simply clipping coupons that accompanied new detailed disclosures of fund performance , risk and fees . Now a prospectus must be mailed out first . Levitt previously supported off-the-page proposals but now says he is convinced that the single page advertisements would not provide investors with enough information to make an informed decision . Levitt says he changed his mind after listening to investors in_focus groups , but some fund executives speculate that he backed_off after the summer derivatives scare . Instead , the SEC will launch a pilot_program that would have mutual_fund companies include a one-page fund summary -- similar to the &quot; off-the-page &quot; advertisements -- with the full prospectus . And the agency says it will encourage fund companies to write investor documents in plain English . While some no-load fund companies are disappointed that Levitt was backing_off the more aggressive off-the-page rules , fund experts agreed that the SEC ' s actions should still make_it easier to compare funds . &quot; This is a terrific idea , &quot; says Diane Coffey , spokeswoman for Dreyfus Corp . in New York . &quot; It makes the prospectus more user-friendly by putting all_the pertinent information upfront . This is clearly an improvement. &quot; Separately , the nation ' s top securities regulators said they ' re also beefing_up proxy disclosures for publicly-held mutual_fund companies and opening_up a consumer hot_line where prospective investors can call_for information . Here is what these changes mean to investors . * Q : What ' s the point of the new fund summary ? * A : It is aimed at ensuring that you can read the pertinent information about a fund before you invest . It should also give investors an easy way to make apples-to-apples comparisons between funds because you could essentially line_up various fund summaries side-by-side and compare them in a glance . * Q : Exactly what will be disclosed ? * A : that ' s currently being debated . But industry executives believe the summaries will include : investment performance over one- , five- and 10-year periods ; the fund ' s goals , objectives and strategies ; sales loads , redemption fees , management fees and other expenses ; investment minimums , and information on how investors can buy or redeem their shares . * Q : Are all fund companies going_to provide these summaries ? * A : that ' s the eventual goal . However , right now , only seven fund companies -- Capital Group , Fidelity , Vanguard , T . Rowe Price , Scudder , Dreyfus and IDS -- are involved in the pilot_program to produce them . And these companies say that , initially , the summaries will only be provided with some fund prospectuses . It ' s likely to take a year -- or more -- before all funds include an easy-to-read summary with investment documents . * Q : How does this differ from the previous proposals ? * A : The biggest difference is that the off-the-page proposals would have allowed no-load fund investors to buy a fund before they ' d actually received the full 30-40 page prospectus . If you saw an off-the-page advertisement , you could clip the coupon , send a check and get_back a prospectus with the confirmation that you were a fund shareholder . * Q : What will the SEC be doing to encourage fund companies to write their lengthy prospectuses in English ? * A : The SEC has to review and approve any investment document sent to fund shareholders -- or prospective shareholders -- including prospectuses and annual reports . Levitt promises that fund companies will get speedy review and approval of documents that aim to simplify discussions of the fund ' s risks and rewards . That could be a dramatic change from the agency ' s reputation . In the past it has spent up_to a year to approve a &quot; simplified &quot; prospectus . * Q : What is the agency doing to beef_up proxy disclosures ? * A : Publicly held mutual_fund companies will be required to give their investors more information about compensation paid to directors and brokers . These rules are aimed at ferreting_out possible conflicts_of_interest between fund managers and investors . * Q : How can I reach the SEC to get information about the new rules or about investing in_general ? * A : The agency is launching a toll-free investor hot_line , which can be reached after Oct . 24 at ( 800 ) SEC-0330 .</TEXT>
