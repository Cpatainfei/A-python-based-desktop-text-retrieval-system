   <HEADLINE> OIL SPILLED FOR 5 DAYS BEFORE DISCOVERY , LAWYER SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An oil_pipeline that leaked 84 # 000 gallons of heavy crude into McGrath Lake last December gushed for five days before the spill was finally discovered Christmas morning , a prosecutor said Tuesday . He also disclosed that pipeline operator Bush Oil Co . never bothered to repair a safety device on the 40-year-old line that could have prevented the leak . The valve broke_in February , 1993 -- 10 months before the buried pipe west of Oxnard gave_way and caused one of Ventura County ' s worst pipeline spills , officials said . &quot; There was no safety_valve on this pipe at all , &quot; said Glen M . Reiser , the Oxnard attorney brought_in by the Ventura County district_attorney ' s office to prosecute the case . Details of the spill -- which killed hundreds of migratory birds and caused the closure of seven miles of coastline in the days after Christmas -- came Tuesday as local prosecutors for the first time released evidence gathered by state Fish and Game investigators . Reiser also said he has made a settlement offer to officials at Berry Petroleum , the Taft-based firm that owns Bush Oil . The offer would allow Berry officials to settle the case by paying fines rather than face felony charges , he said . Company executives responded with a counteroffer , but prosecutors on Tuesday had not yet decided whether to accept it , Reiser said . Terms were not released for either settlement proposal . &quot; If they reject ( the offer ) , then there ' s going_to be a felony filing as soon as this week , &quot; Reiser said . &quot; The felony filing would name the corporation , and there ' s a likelihood it would name a number of corporate officers and employees. &quot; A felony conviction could mean massive fines for the company and possible state_prison terms for up_to 10 Berry executives and workers if a court deemed them responsible_for the spill , Reiser said . Fines could reach $ 2.5 million , or $ 500 # 000 for each day oil leaked into the sensitive wetland habitat , Reiser said . * A separate investigation has been conducted by the state Water Quality_Control Board , which voted Monday to send the case to the attorney_general ' s office for possible civil action . In a statement released Tuesday , the company said it already has spent more_than $ 8 million cleaning_up the spill . But Berry executives and their attorneys declined to discuss details of the Fish and Game investigation . Larry L . Hines , an attorney for Berry Petroleum , confirmed that his clients have made a settlement counteroffer . Hines also said he had filed claims with at least six local and state law_enforcement agencies , which he said failed to follow_up_on early reports of the spill . &quot; We ' re asking for an apportionment of final damages , &quot; he said , referring to Berry ' s claims against the Oxnard police and fire_departments , the Channel Islands Harbor Patrol , the California Highway Patrol , the Ventura County Sheriff ' s Department and the state_Department of Parks and Recreation . * &quot; We ' re asking them to be responsible_for the amount of oil that would not have been spilled had they properly notified the company , which would have immediately shut_down the pipeline , &quot; Hines said . Several citizens reported seeing oil near McGrath Lake on Dec . 24 , a full day before a federal Minerals Management Service crew spotted the leak from a helicopter on their way to inspect an offshore oil platform Christmas_Day . But investigators said the company is far more liable for the spill than any government_agency . For instance , Reiser said , the pipeline that eventually ruptured was never intended to pump crude_oil . When Berry bought the operation from Chevron three years ago , the pipeline had been abandoned for more_than 10 years . Chevron had used the buried line to transport natural_gas , but Berry decided to begin pumping crude_oil through the pipeline without upgrading it , the prosecutor said . &quot; This line had no cathodic protection , &quot; said Reiser , referring to a series of devices that routinely are implanted along metal pipes to protect them from corrosion . &quot; The likelihood of corrosion is much greater ( in underground pipes ) . &quot; Reiser said he has been unable to confirm the company ' s contention that it routinely pressure-checked its pipelines in an effort to ensure reliability . * &quot; We ' ve asked Berry Petroleum for documents which corroborate any leak testing they performed , but they haven ' t produced any , &quot; Reiser said . &quot; They ' ve taken the position that these records don ' t exist. &quot; Signs of life are returning to McGrath Lake , which has perennially been home to numerous species of migrating waterfowl . Fish and Game biologists said Tuesday that the area shows few signs of the environmental disaster that occurred there less than six months ago . &quot; The creek area where the oil flowed down from the break_in the pipeline looks really good , &quot; said Fish and Game biologist Heidi Togstad , who visited the site recently . &quot; We could only find very small amounts of sheen , about two inches across , and some in the lake , &quot; she said . &quot; But we saw a lot of birds using the lake , the vegetation appears to be recovering well and the water looks good. &quot;</TEXT>
