   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON BOSNIA ; A FORCED PEACE IS WORTH TRYING ; A TRULY HUMANITARIAN POLICY WOULD BE FOR THE WEST TO BRING AN END TO THE FIGHTING , EVEN IF IT IS AN UNJUST END .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Paris recently told Washington that Western efforts to end the war in Bosnia weren ' t working , and weren ' t going_to work as currently structured , the_French were right . The French worry that an indefinite prolongation of the war -- five , 10 years or more -- will seriously debilitate European security . And , they point_out , our &quot; humanitarian aid &quot; merely helps the combatants . A truly humanitarian policy would be for the West to try to bring an end to the fighting , even if that means an unjust end . The international community must try something new . Instead of rebuffing Paris out of hand , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher now has an opportunity for serious , constructive dialogue . If he does not seize it , he risks a grave rupture in U.S.-European security relations . Let ' s take a fresh look_at the situation : The net effect of international relief operations in Bosnia is to slowly strengthen the Bosnian Muslim army . We are kidding ourselves when we talk_about humanitarian aid . Everything we send either goes directly to the army or substitutes for goods the army would take from civilians anyway . Let ' s not kid ourselves either about the nature of the Bosnian government . It used to be a moderate , inclusive regime that enjoyed substantial support from the Bosnian Croat and Serb communities . Bosnian Croats and Serbs held key positions . Over the past year , however , under the pressures of the war , it became a 95 % Muslim entity . That is not good , it is not something the Muslims themselves wanted , but it happened . Today , Sarajevo is the capital , as the Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic told me recently , of a Muslim state . It is only to the outside world that the Bosnian government maintains the fiction of its &quot; multiethnic &quot; character , for the obvious reason that a multiethnic state is more likely to get international aid . Over the past several months , the Bosnian Muslim army has made gains , through vicious fighting , against Croatian forces in central and south-central Bosnia . Croatian villagers in areas of Bosnian army control are scared , with reason . Muslim atrocities occur more frequently . The question forces itself on the West : Do we support Muslim politics of revenge ? The logic behind the Bosnian assault is twofold : Remove unreliable , potential fifth-column Croatians , and take from them a swath of land down to the coast , that is , the access to the sea promised in the Geneva talks , but which the Bosnians believe they will not get unless they take it for themselves . Hard-line Muslim military commanders , a majority in the army , would go_further , to roll back Serbian and Croatian forces from all_the territory of the former Bosnia . It was one thing for the international community to seek to help the side ( the Muslims ) that suffered disproportionately from aggression , so_long as the Muslims were losing . But our support for the Muslims finally tilted the local balance in their favor . The danger , the_French point_out , is that our support encourages the Muslims to cross some invisible threshold that will bring_in Croatian and Serbian forces from outside . At that point , Muslims will lose more_than they have already lost . The international community passed_up every opportunity to restore Bosnia as a multiethnic state . The damage has already been done of allowing an example of aggression to succeed . The best we could hope for is to put an end to the fighting , an unjust armistice , that would spare the civilian population further suffering and keep the conflict from spreading through the Balkans . The international community faces three choices : Pull_out of Bosnia ; keep muddling on , or attempt to use force to bring_about territorial_division and an end to the fighting . Pulling_out would be a catastrophe . Fighting would escalate and the Muslims would lose . Chances are 50-50 that misguided American interventionists , who still think the Bosnian government is multiethnic , would push the U.S._government into arming the Muslims . Any such arming , overt or covert , would bring into the conflict for the first time a set of outside powers backing different favorites . It is World_War I again . Withdrawal would also tell the rest of the Balkans something they don ' t need to hear : The way to settle your political differences is to fight it out . The last man standing wins . Just because the entire peninsula hasn ' t blown_up yet doesn ' t mean it won ' t . If we want a Balkan domino effect , this is how to get_it . Muddling on only postpones the day_of_reckoning . The war will go_on . Meanwhile , our &quot; humanitarian aid &quot; operations cost a lot of money -- perhaps between $ 3 billion and $ 4 billion . For what ? We are dreaming if we think we have helped set the stage for a peacefully negotiated settlement in this century . So forcing a settlement on all_the parties starts to look_like it ' s not such a bad idea . Exactly how to do that would be difficult to work_out . Honestly , it may_not prove possible , but it ' s worth a try . All the_French are saying is , let ' s sit_down and have a serious look_at the mess we ' re in . Washington should cooperate .</TEXT>
