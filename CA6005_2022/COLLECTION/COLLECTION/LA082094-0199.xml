   <HEADLINE> WHERE ARE THEY NOW : STEVE CHILCOTT ; A PREMATURE END TO PROMISING CAREER ; BASEBALL : NO . 1 PICK IN ' 66 , PLAGUED BY INJURIES IN MINORS , DIDN ' T PLAY IN EVEN ONE BIG-LEAGUE GAME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Had Steve Chilcott only broken for third_base 27 years ago , he might not be building houses today . It would have seemed boneheaded at the time : a slow-footed catcher running_for third after the pitcher made a pickoff throw to second . But , given what happened when Chilcott ' s right arm slammed back into the second-base bag , popping his shoulder loose , the foolhardy play probably would have been wiser . Had the shoulder injury suffered during that play not ruined Chilcott ' s chances of playing major_league baseball , he might not be the answer to the following trivia question : Who is the only player to be selected first in baseball ' s June amateur draft and retire without playing a game in the major_leagues ? 1 . Steve Chilcott , catcher , Antelope Valley High , by the New York Mets . You could look it up . Casey Stengel , managing the Mets at the time , personally scouted Chilcott at Antelope Valley in 1966 . But , because of injuries , Chilcott never rewarded the Mets for their confidence . Chilcott played parts of seven minor_league seasons , never advancing higher than triple A . For practical purposes , though , Chilcott ' s career ended at second_base one night in the Class-A Florida State League , just about a year into his career . Chilcott ' s playing days were dotted with injuries , but none led more directly to his retirement than his shoulder problems . &quot; I just couldn ' t throw a ball hard enough to break a pane_of_glass , &quot; said Chilcott , now a 46-year-old construction supervisor in Santa Barbara . &quot; I figured I ' d better start finding something else to do. &quot; * Steve Chilcott was the guy other guys wanted to be in high_school . &quot; He was everything that you ' d want an athlete to be , &quot; said George Fetters , one of Chilcott ' s teammates on the Antelope Valley High football_team in 1965 . &quot; When you are young and you look_at a guy you ' d like to be like , I wanted to be like Steve Chilcott. &quot; Said Jerry Watkins , who played football and baseball with Chilcott in high_school : &quot; He was the epitome of a ballplayer. &quot; Chilcott not only started three years for the baseball_team , leading the Antelopes to three Golden League titles , he played quarterback for a league-championship football_team his senior year . &quot; He was just a heck of an athlete , &quot; said Fetters , now an assistant football_coach at Antelope Valley . &quot; He could throw the ball a long way and he was really a strong , physical kid . &quot; The only thing I remember is him running me over all_the time . I was an inside linebacker and I thought I was pretty good , but he would run us over . &quot; I always thought he should have played football. &quot; Football was merely an amusement for Chilcott . He knew baseball was his ticket . Chilcott moved to catcher from third_base his senior year . With a muscular 5-foot-11 , 185-pound frame , a strong arm and a powerful left-handed bat , he was a scout magnet . &quot; It was kind of funny , &quot; he said , &quot; there were usually more scouts in the stands than fans . It would be 25 scouts and 20 fans. &quot; The number of fans increased significantly on one occasion , though , because of one of the celebrities who had come_to scout Chilcott . &quot; Casey Stengel came_to town , &quot; Chilcott remembered . &quot; He showed_up just before the game started , and by the second or third inning , there were hundreds of people there , checking him out . Then after Casey left , it was just those 25 scouts and 20 fans. &quot; With all_the attention , Chilcott figured he would be a first-round pick . The Mets made him not only a first-round pick but the first overall pick in 1966 . He signed for $ 75 # 000 , plus a college scholarship . The highest paid major_league players -- Willie Mays , Mickey Mantle , Sandy Koufax -- in that era made only about $ 100 # 000 a year . Chilcott split his first season between the rookie-level Appalachian League and the Class-A New York-Penn League . He started the 1967 season at Winter Haven , Fla. , and was adjusting to professional_baseball well . He was hitting . 290 with six home_runs and 45 runs batted in through 79 games . Game No . 79 was the fateful one , though . Chilcott was leading_off second_base when the pitcher whirled and threw to second . Chilcott dived into the bag with his right arm . Making the pivotal play in his career even more miserable , Chilcott missed the umpire ' s sign and thought he was out . He was safe . When Chilcott got_up to run to the dugout , he was tagged out . He didn ' t know just how out he really was . &quot; I thought I would be back to play in a short time , &quot; he said . Chilcott , who didn ' t play again that season , now knows his injury to be a chronic recurrent posterior semi-dislocation . He underwent surgery in 1969 , but that was only one of his problems . An infection suffered after he fouled a ball off his shin sent him to the hospital for a month , and later he suffered a broken hand on a foul tip . All along , his shoulder continued to bother him . &quot; Sometimes the pain would just come_back , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' d have to get cortisone shots and have to sit_out a week or two . It was just really a frustrating routine. &quot; Chilcott , who had been traded to the New York Yankees before the 1972 season , was released in the middle of that season . He tried to rejoin the Mets , but they were too busy preparing_for the next draft to bother . At 24 , his baseball career was over . Chilcott said he was disappointed more_than depressed , particularly as he watched players such_as Tug McGraw and Ken Singleton -- his minor_league teammates -- go_on to major_league careers . &quot; For a while , after I got_out of ball , I followed the guys I used to play with , &quot; Chilcott said , &quot; and I wondered what would have or could have happened. &quot; Chilcott went_back to school . His family had moved from the Antelope Valley to Santa Barbara shortly after he graduated high_school , so he enrolled at Santa Barbara City College , where firefighting piqued his interest . He pursued a career as a firefighter in the mid-1970s , working as a temporary in the Santa Barbara Fire Dept . But after several years , frustrated that he could not get a full-time job , Chilcott realized -- again -- that it might be best to pursue another career . After helping a friend remodel homes , he seemed to have found his niche . In 1980 , the same year he married , Chilcott became a full-time contractor . Today he proudly talks_about how he supervises construction of homes . Chilcott also dabbles_in real_estate , renting apartments and houses he owns in California and Arizona to help him live comfortably in Santa Barbara . As for baseball , Chilcott coached Little_League briefly several years ago , and he follows major_league baseball on television , but that ' s it . Chilcott ' s baseball career is now a distant memory . He said he hardly ever thinks_about his days in the minors , except when he ' s out sweating on a construction site and feels a twinge in his right shoulder . Twenty-seven years later , it still hurts . Should have gone_to third , Steve . We ' re No . 1 A look_at the players selected first in each major_league June draft , along with the highest level reached by the player . 04 # 06 , 11 # 23 , 15 Year Club Player , Position Highest Level 1965 Athletics Rick Monday , of Majors 1966 Mets Steve Chilcott , c Triple A 1967 Yankees Ron Blomberg , 1b Majors 1968 Mets Tim Foli , ss Majors 1969 Senators Jeff Burroughs , of Majors 1970 Padres Mike Ivie , c Majors 1971 White Sox Danny Goodwin , c Majors 1972 Padres Dave Roberts , 3b Majors 1973 Rangers David Clyde , lhp Majors 1974 Padres Bill Almon , ss Majors 1975 Angels Danny Goodwin , c Majors 1976 Astros Floyd Bannister , lhp Majors 1977 White Sox Harold Baines , of Majors 1978 Braves Bob Horner , 3b Majors 1979 Mariners Al Chambers , of Majors 1980 Mets Darryl Strawberry , of Majors 1981 Mariners Mike Moore , rhp Majors 1982 Cubs Shawon Dunston , ss Majors 1983 Twins Tim Belcher , rhp Majors 1984 Mets Shawn Abner , of Majors 1985 Brewers B.J.
