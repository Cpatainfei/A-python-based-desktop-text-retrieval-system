   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A WITH ROBERT D . BASS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For many people , the thought of filing for bankruptcy conjures feelings of shame and Dickensian images of decrepit debtor prisons . Robert D . Bass , an Encino bankruptcy attorney who has been practicing for 20 years , says that while such thoughts are understandable , bankruptcy in fact represents a solution to financial situations that have gotten_out of control -- less a cruel punishment than a chance to start over . He notes that in the past few years San Fernando Valley bankruptcy filings have been_on the rise , an unfortunate side_effect of California ' s economic downturn . Bass discussed the fundamentals of bankruptcy filings with Times correspondent David E . Brady . Q : What traps can draw people into bankruptcy ? A : If you go_through periods_of_time where credit is easy , where credit_cards are available , you can get lulled into a sense of well-being if you make enough to make minimum payments . You end_up not ever making a dent in what you really borrowed and what you really charged . And people often find that they get_to a point where they have no way at all_of repaying what ' s owed on credit_cards . . . . If there ' s a lesson to be learned from the ' 80s , it ' s not overextend yourself , live within your means , worry about tomorrow , maintain savings and be concerned and be prepared_for the rainy_day that ' s going_to come_along . * Q : How does a person know when to file for bankruptcy ? A : It ' s when the fixed obligations , the credit_card obligations , the car leases and the level of monthly payments are something that just can ' t be met or maintained by the borrower any longer . When all you ' re doing is paying the minimum payments on your credit_card , which is basically an interest payment and not making a dent , it may be time to consider filing at that point . . . . People file when they can no longer take collection agencies calling them , the wage garnishments , the lawyers ' letters , the lawsuits and those kinds of things . Bankruptcy gives the honest debtor a fresh_start and allows them to take what they earn and use it to go_forward and support their family and themselves as opposed to paying_for past sins that have been imposed through overborrowing or overextension of credit . * Q : What are you allowed to keep after filing ? A : When you file bankruptcy , the federal bankruptcy laws as well as the laws of the state of California provide_for certain exemptions . By and large , the typical individual or consumer who files a bankruptcy will be entitled to keep their personal effects , their furniture , their clothes , some nominal equity in a car . They will be able to maintain their house . . . . For the typical person or family who ' s going_to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case , their life will go_on with little interruption and very little loss of assets . And one of the things a bankruptcy lawyer tries to do when somebody comes_to them talking_of filing is exemption planning , to ensure that the maximum possible exemptions are taken_advantage of . * Q : Once you ' ve filed , how does_it affect your future income and purchases ? A : I think your ability to obtain credit in the future will be largely dependent_on your earning capacity and your ability to establish to a lender that you ' ll be able to repay what you borrow , whether it ' s buying a car , consumer_credit or buying a house . A bankruptcy ' s really a last_resort because it ' s a hard concept for many people to come_to grips with . Most people have led their lives never thinking or imagining that they ' d have to file a bankruptcy . * Q : Can someone file for bankruptcy without a lawyer ? A : In the simplest of cases , it probably can be done without a lawyer . Without the benefit of the legal advice , people may file and find that it really wasn ' t necessary and then when they really do need the benefits of a bankruptcy they won ' t be able to file because there ' s a prohibition on filing again for a substantial period_of_time . * Q : What is your most important right after filing ? A : It stops creditors from harassing you , from continuing collection efforts , from continuing foreclosures . I think your most important right is to be left alone and to go_forward and look toward the future with some sense of hope and a feeling that you ' ll make_it again . * Q : How long does a bankruptcy filing affect your credit rating ? A : In terms of actually affecting your credit , I would suspect that probably for a year to two years it is difficult to get credit . After that period_of_time it is probably much easier . * Q : What advice would you give someone thinking_of starting a business in the Valley ? A : Be cautious . Make_sure the business is adequately capitalized so that during down times or during a start-up period you have sufficient capital to cover you and pay your operating expenses . I would strongly urge anybody who ' s running a business to be sure that all taxes are paid and obligations to the government are kept current . And anybody ' s who going_to open a business ought to have a heck of a lot of luck . * Q : What causes most businesses to fail ? A : The failure to face problems when they first start surfacing is probably one of the major contributors to businesses ultimately failing . When people finally realize it ' s time to do something , either to seek_out consultants or other professionals to look_at their business , many of those businesses are already so far under water that there is nothing that can be done . * Q : What ' s the most common misconception about bankruptcy ? A : It is the realization that it is not an admission of failure . It is a remedy that has been provided by Congress , recognizing that people get_into situations , not dishonestly , but just out of circumstances beyond their control . There is a remedy available that lets one get_rid_of that . The misconception is that bankruptcy is something that ought to be avoided or something terrible like the plague .</TEXT>
