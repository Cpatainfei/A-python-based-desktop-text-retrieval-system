   <HEADLINE> ALL WORK AND ALL PLAY ; REST ? CELLIST MSTISLAV ROSTROPOVICH DOESN ' T KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD ; JUST LOOK_AT HIS CALENDAR FOR THE NEXT 3 YEARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Mstislav Rostropovich has always been seen as larger than life , the same can be said about his calendar . The celebrated cellist , who for three decades has shown he can also conduct , will soon step_down from the helm of the National Symphony_Orchestra in Washington . Retiring from a post he ' s held for 17 years would presumably allow him breathing room after a lifetime of concerts and recordings . that ' s if he wanted breathing space . Apparently he does not . &quot; June 16 and 17 are my last two days with the orchestra . But not in life , I hope , &quot; Rostropovich said from his office at the Kennedy Center . He performs a recital tonight at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts . &quot; Every day until my 70th birthday -- on March 27 , 1997 -- is booked . For three years , every day , 9 to 4 , 9 to 5 , 9 to 6. &quot; That doesn ' t include nights , of course . At Cerritos , he has scheduled an imposing program : Richard Strauss ' Sonata for Cello and Piano , Opus 6 ; Bach ' s Suite for Unaccompanied Cello in C Minor ; Debussy ' s First Sonata for Cello and Piano , and the West Coast premiere of Alfred Schnittke ' s Epilogue from &quot; Peer Gynt , &quot; for cello , electronic tape and piano . Lambert Orkis will serve as pianist . Looking ahead , his three-year-at-a-glance calendar reveals six operas , three of which are new : In May , he leads &quot; Lygeia , &quot; based on the life of Edgar Allan Poe , by U.S. composer Augusta Read Thomas , at the International Festival of Evian in France ( he ' s festival president ) ; in December , &quot; Lolita , &quot; by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin with the Stockholm Opera , and next year , &quot; Gesualdo &quot; by Schnittke with the Vienna State Opera . He ' ll also conduct Musorgsky ' s &quot; Khovanshchina &quot; in Moscow , Shostakovich ' s &quot; Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk &quot; in St . Petersburg and Benjamin Britten ' s &quot; Peter Grimes &quot; in Vienna . &quot; That is only six operas , but ( there are ) also seven compositions for cello premiere , &quot; he said , reeling_off a list that included a concerto for flute , oboe , cello and piano by the late Olivier Messiaen . &quot; And in between , I play normally . I will not stop my normal ( performing ) activities. &quot; An innocent request for background materials on Rostropovich elicited a 17-page fax , all single-spaced : 11 pages dedicated to his discography ( more_than 100 recordings ) , three to premieres ( well more_than 100 ) , and three to awards , doctorates and honorary citizenships . As a prerequisite to granting an interview , Rostropovich declined to address questions about politics , preferring instead to discuss music . But one thinks_of Bach and religion , Beethoven and the_French Revolution . Can artistic expression ever be completely divorced from social , religious or political concerns ? &quot; I don ' t know all that in_general , but I know about my life , and for me that is impossible , &quot; he admitted . &quot; I ask now that we not discuss politics only because so many people comment about that . Let me say only that I ' m still very optimistic about my country , very optimistic. &quot; He was anything but optimistic 20 years ago , when Rostropovich -- born in Baku , an Azerbaijani city on the Caspian Sea -- departed the former Soviet_Union after sheltering dissident author Alexander Solzhenitsyn and writing an open_letter to Leonid Brezhnev protesting Soviet restrictions on cultural freedom . Concerts , recording projects and tours for both Rostropovich and his wife , soprano Galina Vishnevskaya , had been canceled ; they became &quot; non-persons. &quot; Though granted exit visas , they were eventually stripped of their citizenship . In 1989 , Rostropovich performed at the Berlin Wall two days after its destruction . In 1990 , the Soviet Legislature restored his citizenship and all medals and honorary titles . His July , 1991 , concert in Prague fulfilled a 1968 promise to play when the last Soviet soldier left Czechoslovakia . The next month , without a visa and at great personal danger , he flew to Moscow to stand beside Boris N . Yeltsin following the coup that deposed Mikhail S . Gorbachev . In September , 1993 , before a Red Square crowd of 100 # 000 -- far larger than any that gathered during the concurrent political crisis in which Yeltsin , who attended the concert , disbanded Parliament -- Rostropovich led the National Symphony in works by Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky . ( When cannons exploded in the &quot; 1812 Overture , &quot; several people reportedly shouted , &quot; A coup ! &quot; ) Ignat Solzhenitsyn , the dissident ' s 20-year-old son , was piano soloist for the two-week tour , but did not play_on the brief Red Square program . As important to Rostropovich , in any case , as his political activities vis a vis his homeland , are his efforts on behalf of the Vishnevskaya Rostropovich Foundation . Named for his wife , the foundation created , and funds , the Moscow-based Children ' s Healthcare Network to modernize two hospitals in Moscow and St . Petersburg . &quot; I would like that your grandchildren have healthy grandchildren , &quot; he said . &quot; Each third child born in Moscow has some genetic damage . Each third child ! &quot; that ' s 70 years of the Communist regime , a disastrous situation for ecology . Not only Chernobyl -- there are so many catastrophes , and many_more powerful . In 1957 , there was an atomic_explosion 20 times more powerful than Chernobyl , exactly in the center of Russia. &quot; Extra-musical issues having been dispatched , Rostropovich ( &quot; Slava &quot; to even the most casual acquaintances ) seemed thrilled to focus instead on his recital , and especially on Schnittke , who in recent years has taken a firm place in the Russian pantheon of composers . &quot; Epilogue &quot; is a special arrangement for the cellist of a ballet originally scored for orchestra ; though a single movement , it runs more_than half an hour , and Rostropovich likened it to a cello concerto . He obviously feels Schnittke ' s acclaim is deserved . &quot; After my friends -- the composers that enriched my life , Prokofiev , Benjamin Britten -- died , I had not found a musical figure who continues for me my contact ( with ) composers , &quot; he reflected . &quot; In comes Schnittke in my life , so now I make performances , several world_premieres , of his compositions. &quot; Rostropovich also talked_about Bach ' s six suites for cello alone , a pinnacle of the cello repertory . &quot; All my life I work_on these suites , &quot; he said . &quot; Two years ago , but not yet on the market , I finished my first recording of all_the suites in audio and video , a monumental work in my life . Five weeks , each day and each night , I make this work . &quot; Bach is so great that in one ' s life you come_back many times . This time , I again revised my opinions . I have become more intelligent where Bach is concerned , and some things change in interpretation . This time , too , I study the manuscript more precisely , more carefully . Even now I change my bowings. &quot; * Cellist Mstislav Rostropovich will play works by Richard Strauss , Bach , Debussy and Alfred Schnittke tonight at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts , 12700 Center Court Drive , Cerritos . Curtain time is 8 p.m. Tickets , $ 35- $ 45 .
