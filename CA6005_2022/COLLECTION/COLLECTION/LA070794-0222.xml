   <TEXT> Call them the Wal-Mart of movie_theaters . Discount movie_houses such_as American Family Theatres , which is celebrating its first anniversary at The Esplanade mall in Oxnard , are doing a brisk business from dollar-conscious filmgoers willing to postpone their trip to the theater until a_few months after a film is released . Theater co-owner Tom Brand said studios are responsible_for setting the ticket price on first-run films , but after a picture has been out for a month or two , the distributor will let theaters show it for a reduced price . &quot; The idea of a discount theater has been around forever , &quot; Brand said . &quot; The old discount theater was 99 cents , had a single screen and was kind of a dump . It was a picture ' s last stop before condemnation . What ' s changed in the discount world is the facility . We try to provide a nice movie experience , one that ' s as comfortable as theaters where you spend $ 7. &quot; The standard ticket price for American Family is $ 2 and Brand reports that the theater is making money on that . American Family , owners of 16 screens in Southern California , has increased its holdings by 50 % this year and Brand projects 50 % growth next year . &quot; The market has responded to the concept . Obviously there ' s a niche we ' re filling. &quot; Discounting seems to be a trend , according to a study by the National Assn . of Theater Owners and the Motion_Picture Assn . of America . A survey -- based on a poll of theater owners representing more_than half the screens in the United States -- found that the average ticket price last year was $ 4.14 , down from $ 5.15 in 1989 . American has another strategy to distinguish itself from other Theaters , said co-owner Jay Brand , Tom ' s brother . &quot; We don ' t bring hard R in . We try to limit to family entertainment rather than the kick-ass , exploitative sort of ( junk ) , &quot; said Jay Brand . Sharon Stone appeared only briefly on American Family screens in &quot; Fatal Instinct , &quot; Jay Brand said . &quot; We watch more carefully now . &quot; Beverly Hills Cop &quot; is acceptable , even though the language was a bit tough . Freddy Krueger would n ' t make_it on our screens. &quot; It ' s ironic that Brand should mention the movie about the famous haunting on Elm Street since his theater is itself rumored to be haunted . Ventura County ' s historian of the paranormal , Richard Senate , said former employees of the theater have told him of menacing shadows late at night and of chill winds that blow through the projection room . The specter began after a gang-related homicide at the theater in 1979 associated with a screening of the movie &quot; The Warriors. &quot; Tom Brand said he was unaware of the incident and expressed surprise . &quot; Really ? Wow , I guess I won ' t go there alone. &quot;</TEXT>
