   <HEADLINE> ANTI-IMMIGRANT BIAS IN COLONIAL TIMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Americans have been ambivalent about immigration since the nation ' s beginning . Benjamin Franklin , before he signed the Declaration complaining about barriers to immigration , was complaining about immigrants.Germans , the doughty Pennsylvanian groused , were being allowed &quot; to swarm into our settlements and by herding together establish their language and manners to the exclusion of ours. &quot; Spite toward newcomers with strange names and tongues and complexions has accompanied every peak period of immigration since . And each wave has taken much of the heat for whatever home-grown social problems they encountered . Italians , President Herbert Hoover wrote in a note to a New York congressman , are &quot; predominantly our murderers and bootleggers . . . foreign spawn ( who ) do not appreciate this country. &quot; The congressman was Fiorello LaGuardia . It might be noted that Hoover ' s immigrant forebear , Andreas Huber , was one of the German-speaking &quot; swarm &quot; that so annoyed Benjamin Franklin .</TEXT>
