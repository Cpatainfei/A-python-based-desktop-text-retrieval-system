   <HEADLINE> MORMONS : SHOWING THE DIVERSITY THAT EXISTS IN THE CHURCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I grew_up in Westchester , and am a member of The Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints . Your article on the church ( &quot; The New Mormons , &quot; Feb . 20 ) and how it has grown , was an article that I very much enjoyed . I have not lived_in Westchester for many years , having moved to Arcadia in the San Gabriel Valley when I graduated from Westchester High_School . It was most interesting to me to see how the church has grown and diversified over the years . I was thrilled to see that people of many different backgrounds have found their spiritual home_in the Mormon faith in which I grew_up . I want to thank_you -- and especially Mr. Chazanov , who wrote the article -- for the integrity with which it was researched and written . Please , continue to share this kind of positive and uplifting information with readers who are world-weary and shellshocked by the overwhelming present and future challenges of each day .
