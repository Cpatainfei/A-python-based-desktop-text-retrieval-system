   <HEADLINE> MARKET FOCUS ; VENDING MACHINES JINGLE IN ARGENTINA ; THE NATION ' S NEW ECONOMIC STABILITY MEANS THAT COINS ACTUALLY HAVE VALUE AFTER YEARS OF INFLATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since October , Alejandro Martin has sold more_than 130 American-made vending_machines , the kind that swallow coins and give_out coffee , soft_drinks or snacks . Martin ' s business is not soaring , but it ' s getting_off_the_ground -- something that would have seemed impossible in Argentina during past decades , when inflation of triple and even quadruple digits rapidly reduced the value of coins . Coin vending_machines are a sign of new times . In the past 12 months , Argentine inflation totaled only 4.3 % , the lowest rate since 1953 . Monthly inflation_rates in the past six months have averaged less than 0.1 % . Thanks to the government ' s monetary stabilization program , 50 centavos will buy the same candy_bar it bought half a year ago , making vending_machines practical for the first time in a generation . Controlling inflation has been one of the main achievements of President Carlos Menem and his economy minister , Domingo Cavallo . And monetary stability obviously is good for business : The Argentine economy grew a robust 7 % last year . Martin said the stability and growth , together with the untapped potential of vending_machines , make his company ' s future a promising one , though not without problems . He is commercial manager of Vendor Argentina , a joint_venture of Argentine investors and the Des Moines , Iowa-based Wittern Group of 32 vending machine manufacturing , marketing and servicing companies . &quot; Our market is going_to be a big market , &quot; Martin said . &quot; But it is not going_to be very easy to expand. &quot; Vending_machines are a new concept for Argentines who have watched coins quickly become worthless over the years . When Buenos Aires buses recently began operating with automatic coin_boxes -- another sign of the times -- one of the biggest problems was riders boarding without the right change . &quot; We are changing maybe 40 or 50 years of tradition , &quot; Martin said . &quot; This is a very big change , and people need to be educated to get used to using coins. &quot; * By betting that such a development is coming , he said , Vendor Argentina is putting &quot; 100 % confidence in the_Argentine economic plan and the stability of the currency. &quot; Some economists , however , see danger signs_in the economy , including an overvalued peso , a growing trade_deficit and a slowdown in the flow of capital into the country . In 1991 , Economy Minister Cavallo unveiled a stabilization plan that guarantees convertibility of the_Argentine peso at one to a U.S. dollar . But it took time to convince the marketplace of the peso ' s stability . In the first two years under the plan , retail prices climbed . That has made many Argentine products and services overpriced in dollars and has set_off a series of related results familiar to volatile economies . As a result , for instance , some of the country ' s exports are less competitive on international markets , and imports are cheaper . Argentina ' s trade_deficit rose to a record $ 3.7 billion last year and is expected to keep climbing this year . So far , the investment and financial funds coming_into the country have covered the trade_deficit , but economists say the capital flow is slowing . Recently increased interest_rates in the United States make Argentina ' s stock_market , bonds and other investment instruments less attractive than they were last year , economic analysts say . To draw funds for development , the_Argentine government and private sector now must pay higher interest_rates themselves . &quot; The financial cost of restructuring the economy has gone_up , &quot; said Osvaldo Cortesi , a partner in the Macroeconomica consulting_firm . If the trade_deficit continues to climb and capital inflow wanes , pressure may mount for a peso devaluation . But a devaluation would bring a serious risk of renewed inflation . In the past , Argentine retailers traditionally pegged prices to the dollar value of the peso , and if the peso-dollar parity is broken , that tradition is likely to return , economists say . Menem is expected to do everything possible to avoid a devaluation and the risk of inflation before presidential elections , to be scheduled for sometime early next year . Menem hopes to run_for a second term , and a surge of inflation could undermine his popularity , which has been based in large part on the success of his economic_policy . * Eventually , however , the government will have to do something to increase exports , said Walter Stoeppelwerth , senior financial analyst at the Smith New Court stock brokerage in Buenos Aires . Stoeppelwerth noted that Argentine exports account_for less than 5 % of the country ' s total economic production , a tiny proportion compared with other rapidly developing countries . Government officials say tax cuts and increased efficiency can make Argentine exports more competitive without the need for a devaluation . But Stoeppelwerth and other analysts aren ' t convinced that monetary stability is here to stay . &quot; I ' ll believe it when I can buy a Coke from a machine with coins , &quot; he said . Argentine Inflation Now that inflation has climbed_down from the days of quadruple-digit figures , the use of coins is returning . Here ' s a look_at the dramatic change in Argentina ' s inflation over the past decade . * Increases in Official Consumer_Price_Index 1984 : 688.0 % 1985 : 385.4 % 1986 : 821.9 1987 : 174.8 % 1988 : 387.7 % 1989 : 4 # 923.3 % 1990 : 1 # 343.9 % 1991 : 84.0 % 1992 : 17.5 % 1993 : 7.4 % * Source : Argentine government</TEXT>
