   <TEXT> On the afternoon of April 4 , 1991 , 15 years , 11 months and 27 days after the end of the Vietnam_War , four Vietnamese youths armed with semiautomatic_pistols stormed into a Good_Guys electronic store on Stockton Boulevard in Sacramento and held 41 people hostage . Speaking heavily accented and broken English , they issued what the Sacramento Bee described as &quot; a series of bizarre demands. &quot; They wanted a helicopter to fly to Thailand and fight the Viet Cong , $ 4 million , four bulletproof_vests and 40 pieces of 1 # 000-year-old ginseng roots . While a crowd gathered across the street , some enthusiasts equipped with their own camcorders , TV_reporters informed viewers that three of the gunmen were brothers -- Loi Khac Nguyen , 21 , Pham Khac Nguyen , 19 , and Long Khac Nguyen , 17 -- and the last , Cuong Tran , 16 , was Long Nguyen ' s best_friend . The Nguyen brothers had come from a poor Vietnamese Catholic family headed by an ex-sergeant of the South Vietnamese army . All four were altar_boys . Three of the youths had dropped_out of school or had been expelled . None had been able to find a steady job . The gunmen could be seen on live television behind the store ' s glass doors , strolling back and forth with their firearms , their hostages bound at their feet . Sacramento County Sheriff Glen Craig , who had implanted listening devices in the store , reported that the gunmen were jubilant at seeing themselves and hearing their names on TV -- &quot; Oh , ah , we ' re going to be movie_stars ! &quot; The sheriff had also told reporters that the gunmen belonged_to a loosely_knit gang called Oriental Boys -- an error , as it turned_out , since police couldn ' t prove membership in any gang . As the siege wore_on , negotiations between the gunmen and the taut-faced , gray-haired sheriff reached a stalemate . The gunmen , for their part , had grown increasingly edgy and refused to negotiate after authorities met only part of one demand -- providing them with a single bulletproof jacket . Sheriff Craig , on the other hand , later told reporters that the four would not &quot; focus_on any single demand . They were attempting to gain notoriety , attention and , perhaps , some transportation out of the country. &quot; Eight-and-a-half hours later , after the gunmen wounded two of the hostages , a SWAT team raided the store on live television . Three of the young_men were killed immediately , but not before one of them sprayed the hostages with bullets , killing two employees -- John Lee Fritz and Kris Sohne -- and a customer -- Fernando Gutierrez -- and wounding eight more . Loi Nguyen , the oldest , and the one who wore the bulletproof jacket , was seriously wounded . His trial on 49 felony counts and three counts of murder is set for July 11 . He is pleading not_guilty . As I watched this tragedy unfold on my TV_set that night , I remember being overwhelmed by an irrational fear . It was the fear that the Vietnam_War had somehow been renewed by those gunmen and by those helicopters hovering over the store . And though I was_on the safe side of the TV screen now and judging their barbaric acts , I was not without this singular sense of foreboding : Six years ago I could have been one of them . If the story of the Good_Guys ended in carnage on the linoleum floor of an electronics store , it began an ocean and an epic journey away , nourished by numerous subterranean streams . It is those streams I am foundering in . I am at once too close and too far from their story . Though an American journalist now , I came_to this country as a Vietnamese refugee , the son of a South Vietnamese army_officer . The young_men and I , through our fathers , are veterans of a civil_war we never actually fought . In their demands , I hear the thematic echo of vengeance , which forms and shapes all Vietnamese youths who grow_up in America . Perhaps all this binds me to the Good_Guys hostage-takers nearly two decades after the last U.S. helicopter hovered over a burning Saigon before heading toward the South_China_Sea . WHEN I ASKED FOR DIRECTIONS , THE blond kid on Stockton Boulevard rattled_off names of generic American landmarks in an amiable tone : Midas . . . Shakey ' s pizza . . . Carl ' s Jr . . . . man , you can ' t miss it . . . . Turn left at the House of Fabrics . Next to it , you ' ll see the Good_Guys . Inside , the first thing you noticed was yourself . Walk through the glass door and a dozen camcorders gave you back your reflections on the various TV_sets . For as little as $ 549 , you could be ( oh , ah ) your own movie_star . I saw but tried not to look_at my own faces on those TV screens . The faces , my faces , appeared expressionless , the thick brows slightly raised , touched perhaps by a tinge of skepticism . I do not believe_in instant fame , had always thought Andy Warhol ' s prediction an odd American curse . But teen-agers are daily worshipers in this secular temple of high-tech consumerism , their eyes mesmerized by the son et lumiere . At the Nintendo counter , five Asian teens vied to compete for world championship of Street_Fighter II . At the cellular_phone display , two Latino girls pretended to gossip , using those palm-sized communicators . And at the store ' s far end , a_hundred or so TV_sets formed a kind of electronic wall that talked and sang and showed the shopper the panorama of America -- talk_shows , soap_operas , commercials . A fat housewife described her sex life on a dozen or so screens . In a hushed tone , she related intimate details of her marital betrayal to Oprah and 14 million other people -- &quot; I never told anybody this but . . . &quot; -- and managed to blush . It is here , in this American postmodern public_square , that the ethnic private meets the mainstream public . At dinnertime on the night of the Good_Guys siege , Papa and Mama Nguyen suddenly saw their three eldest boys holding American hostages at the neighborhood electronics store . One can assume that their sons were simultaneously watching their own drama on dozens of TV_sets . It is a kind of instantaneous real-life opera made popular by television these days , the blood opera with all nuances flattened so that viewers get only a reporter ' s sound_bites and vivid endings . Narrative is shaved to the bone , history and background ignored . That sort of ignorance is peculiarly American , or so it seems to many of the 12 # 000 Vietnamese in the Sacramento area . A few who watched the siege recall a dangerous combination of arrogance and confusion among the TV_reporters and especially the authorities . &quot; They ran_around like chickens without heads , &quot; said one Vietnamese man who volunteered to help the police but was turned_away . &quot; The boys were Vietnamese Catholics and the sheriff initially had a Laotian monk at the scene , &quot; he said . Yet clues that would have helped the sheriffs and the journalists unlock the gunmen ' s psyches were just minutes from the Good_Guys , in Little Saigon . In a mini-mall a mile or so away , a video store called Ngoc Thao ( Precious Herb ) catered to a Vietnamese clientele . Colorful posters of gangsters and cops holding Uzis and of ancient swordsmen in silk brocades flying above temple rooftops covered the walls and glass windows . Here , as in many other video stores frequented by local Vietnamese in Sacramento , one can find 1 # 000-year-old ginseng roots -- the precious cure-all usually discovered by the lucky hero in kung_fu epics -- or other magical panaceas and cursed swords . They ' re in hundreds of Hong Kong videos , dubbed in Vietnamese , that line the shelves . The cashier , a heavily made-up woman , was having a busy day . Like a high priestess with holy_water , she dispensed pieces of Asia ' s fabled past to hordes of homesick Vietnamese . &quot; Sister , when is the Royal Tramp video coming_out ? I ' ve been waiting for months. &quot; &quot; Sister , we want ' Dragon Palms ' and ' The Revenge of Black Orchid. ' I hear the woman in ' Orchid ' is the best fighter and , like a man , kills everyone who assassinated her parents. &quot; &quot; Aunty , how much does a karaoke machine cost ? Everybody in my family is dying to be a rock ' n ' roll star. &quot; At the entrance , an 8-year-old holding a plastic bag filled with kung_fu videos was his old_man ' s pride and joy . Papa urged youngest son to say something to a friend , an army buddy wearing a fatigue jacket . Youngest son shrugged , then , without enthusiasm , recited a quote from a movie : &quot; Honorable father , I must leave you now and find a mentor to learn the martial_art way . I will avenge our family honor after I have mastered the Iron Palms of Death. &quot; The two men laughed and applauded the mythological voice of China , a voice that provides a kind of parochial snare in the Americanization process . Thanks to CNN , satellite dishes , cable TVs , VCRs , jumbo jets , camcorders and fax machines , integration turns retro-future-active . Technology renews old myths , shrinks oceans , packages memories , melts borders , rejuvenates old passions , redefines the assimilation process . For Asian children immigrating to America today , their parents ' homelands are no longer as far away as they were for children in earlier times . The American-born Vietnamese boy who mouths ancient wisdoms may_not know their meaning , may never , for that matter , master the Iron Palms of Death , but somehow Asia has already exuded mysticism into his soul . Indeed , the alluring incense , the singsong languages , the communal and familial Confucian values of loyalty and obligation , the old-world gestures of self-sacrifice and revenge -- all that earlier generations of American-born Asians tried so hard to exorcise -- is now in_style , evidenced in the Little Saigons and Little Seouls that dot so many California urban landscapes . TWO DAYS AFTER THE GOOD_GUYS SIEGE , a Sacramento Bee photo that ran the length of the page showed the Nguyen brothers ' parents standing in their living_room as if facing a firing_squad . Though stricken with grief , Bim Khac and Sao Thi Nguyen admitted journalists into their tiny two-bedroom unit in the Laura Dawn Manor Apartments , a two-story structure rented_out mostly to Southeast Asian families . The photo shows a sagging sofa , a VCR and , of course , a large TV_set . On top of the TV stands a South Vietnamese flag -- three red horizontal stripes against a gold background -- representing a country that no longer exists . On the opposite wall , a three-tier shrine displays crucifixes , statues of Mary , Joseph and Jesus and various martyred saints , all with mournful faces . The Nguyens and their six children spent four months in a refugee camp in Indonesia before coming_to the United States in the early 1980s . In Sacramento , they were receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children . The ex-sergeant from the South Vietnamese army , who is_active in church , said through an interpreter that he was no help to his children when it came_to explaining American things such_as homework or news on TV . Still , wasn ' t what he wanted for his children the same as what any Vietnamese parent wants -- that they do_well in school but keep &quot; Vietnamese traditions &quot; ? &quot; Please tell the people of Sacramento I am very sorry_for what my sons have done , &quot; the patriarch offered . Asked how his quiet , obedient boys wound_up becoming hostage-takers , Nguyen and his wife provided only a miserable silence . This is the silence of an older generation of Vietnamese refugees who no longer feel anchored anywhere but in their impoverished homes . The exterior landscape belongs_to America , strange and nonsensical , not their true home . Inside , many Vietnamese refugees tend to raise their children with stern rules -- the way they themselves were raised back home . Vietnamese is spoken , with familial personal_pronouns -- youngest son , older sister , aunt , father , great uncle , and so on -- lacing every sentence to remind the speakers and the listeners of their status in the Confucian hierarchical scheme of things . These parents are unprepared for children who lead dual lives , who may in fact commit rash and incomprehensibly violent acts -- not at all_the docile and obedient Vietnamese children they had hoped to raise . &quot; They are no longer really Vietnamese , nor are they really Americans , &quot; said a former teacher , who recently came from Vietnam and now lives_on welfare in Sacramento , of_his_own children . He called their tangled assimilation &quot; crippled Americanization. &quot; For Loi , Pham and Long Nguyen and Cuong Tran , who failed school and grew_up between the Good_Guys electronics store and the Ngoc Thao , there existed two separate notions -- notoriety and revenge , revenge being the stronger impulse . One encourages public displays ( i.e. , confessing on &quot; Oprah , &quot; or holding shoppers hostage and giving incoherent speeches ) that may lead mainstream America to acknowledge that they exist . The other fulfills the old_man ' s extraterritorial passion -- &quot; helicopters to Thailand to kill Viet Cong &quot; -- and rejects America as the wasteland . To grow_up Vietnamese in America , after all , is to grow_up with the legacy of belonging_to the loser ' s side and to endure all that entails . To grow_up in America is to desire individual fame and glory , a larger sense of the self . Driving on Stockton Boulevard , it suddenly occurs to me that , while I myself might have learned to walk that strange Vietnamese American hyphen , it continues to hurl young and hapless Vietnamese down into a dark and bottomless pit . AFTER GOOD_GUYS , THE MEDIA OFFERED A VARIETY OF EXPLANATIONS . One had to do with the chronology of waves , as in waves of Vietnamese immigrants . The first wave of refugees who came_to America in 1975 , my wave , comprised intellectuals , educators , army_officers , skilled civil_servants , professionals -- Vietnam ' s best and brightest -- those who had not experienced Vietnam under communist rule . This wave adjusted readily to American life , to an America of the 1970s that was economically stable and motivated , in part by guilt , to be generous to the newly arrived : There were English as a Second Language teachers , low-interest loans , job-training programs . The later wave , the boat people who came_in the ' 80s , were a different group -- people who had been traumatized by re-education camps , cannibalism , rape , robbery , drowning at the hands of sea pirates , people who had suffered a chaotic and broken society back home under communist hands . These less-skilled , less-educated refugees were ill equipped to adjust to a less generous America . But there were deeper currents that fed this second-wave refugee family that the media failed to detect . According to one Vietnamese who has been a social_worker and knows the family well , the Nguyen parents had been burned not once but twice by communism . They fled to the South in 1954 when Catholics were persecuted by Ho Chi Minh and his army , and they fled Saigon as boat people a_few years after the communists ransacked the South in 1975 . Communist crimes , Viet Cong crimes , human-rights abuses by the Hanoi regime -- all are meticulously documented by Vietnamese Catholic newspapers and magazines in the United States . The Viet Cong , whom the eldest Nguyen boy barely remembered , nevertheless figured as the prime villains in the household cosmology -- the chief cause of their family ' s suffering in America , the robbers of their father ' s dignity , the blasphemers of the crucifix in their church , called the Vietnamese Catholic Martyrs . The Nguyen brothers and Cuong Pham ( whose more-affluent Chinese Vietnamese parents , unlike the Nguyens , refused to open their doors to journalists ) were reportedly Hong Kong movie fanatics . All four youths watched the highly stylized films whose sword-crossing heroes and gun-toting detectives and gangsters duked it out amid Hong Kong high-rises , filling their waking dreams with homilies to honor , fraternal loyalty , betrayal and , of course , revenge . To many Vietnamese living in Sacramento , these Hong Kong videos are the real culprit in the Good_Guys shootout . Gangster films like John Woo ' s &quot; A Better Tomorrow &quot; and &quot; Bullet in the Head &quot; were the rage among Vietnamese youth in the late 1980s . It was in re-enacting these gang-shooting scenes , some speculate , that the gunmen coolly flipped coins to decide which of the hostages would take the first bullet . In &quot; Bullet in the Head , &quot; three best_friends -- blood_brothers from Hong Kong looking_to make a name for themselves ( they have been losers up_to this point ) -- travel_to Vietnam during the war to smuggle illegal ampicillin . With the help of an assassin , they end_up fighting everyone , including the Viet Cong . Though profit was their original quest , they are searching for their lost souls -- they cannot decide whether they are good_guys or bad_guys . Along the way , the brothers are captured by the Viet Cong and tortured . They escape when Army of Republic of Vietnam helicopters arrive and attack the Viet Cong stronghold . What moves the plot along and prompts young Vietnamese viewers to whooping-oohing cheers , is the escalating interplay of terror and death from one scene to the next , culminating in a betrayal of camaraderie and leading to vengeance . A few weeks after Good_Guys , Sacramento police received a mysterious letter signed by the Brothers of the Dragon . &quot; On 4-4-91 you have killed our brothers in Sacramento for no reason , &quot; it announced . &quot; For this reason there must be revenge . The Brothers of the Dragon have decided in a meeting a lesson will be made. &quot; On the margins of the letter were the Vietnamese words that embody the Hong Kong video gangster mythos , words that many Vietnamese gang members have tattooed on_their_own skin : Tinh , Tien , Tu , Toi , Thu -- Love , Money , Prison , Sin , Revenge . I TRY BUT CANNOT REACH LOI NGUYEN . HIS DEFENSE_LAWYER , LINDA M . Parisi , refuses to answer my letters and phone_calls . She traveled_to Vietnam at her own expense to better understand the case and is known to be extremely protective of her client . Then I go_to interview his parents , both under psychiatric care . Although I imagine myself to be an American journalist , the closer I come_to their home , the more I realize this has been a false assumption . Sitting in my car outside the Laura Dawn Manor , I am overwhelmed by fear and guilt . Once the door opens and the old couple welcomes me in , in my mother ' s language , I know I will lose all perspective . An American journalist would ask the old couple , &quot; How do you feel ? &quot; but I can ' t . Among Vietnamese , a collective understanding assumes that we have all suffered an epic loss , so it is pointless to ask . Once inside , I might as well put_away the note pad and declare my loyalty to the old couple , whatever their shortcomings . I am also aware that I will somehow benefit from their tragedy . If the youths were inarticulate and failed to become stars , I , the one who has a public voice , am about to gain a measure of notoriety as the teller of their sensational tale . Irrational as it may be , I feel_like a cannibal . And this , perhaps more_than any other reason , is why I can ' t bring myself to knock_on their door . Defeated , I return to San Francisco , the city of glassy high-rises and rolling hills , where I live . It is , I realize , a different narrative that I am_after now , one that moves from the incidental toward the historical . I go_to Tu Lan , a Vietnamese coffee_shop in the Tenderloin area where Vietnamese men wearing unkempt army jackets argue about Vietnamese politics in low voices on a weekday afternoon . Cigarette smoke hangs_in the air like a white mosquito_net . A song entitled &quot; Mother Vietnam : We Are Still Here &quot; echoes from the stereo . Thuan , a 22-year-old who came_to the United States five years ago , stares at my laptop with large , sad eyes as I jot_down some notes . Of course he has heard about the Good_Guys siege , which has become a legend among his friends . &quot; What those guys tried to do is to make America notice us . To me they ' re martyrs . Brother , America doesn ' t care if we live or die . At night , I see Vietnamese kids wandering the streets like ghosts . Some run_away from home , some have no home to go_to . Some travel from one city to the next looking_for something , not knowing what . Maybe if I had come early and become articulate and educated like you , it would be different . But it ' s too late . Now I ' m just a nobody . No education . I ' m just stupid like a pig. &quot; Thuan , whose father died in a communist re-education camp , has an easy explanation for the hostage-takers ' demands . &quot; The ginseng roots are to increase your internal strength tenfold . Everybody knows that . Some say you can see in the dark if you drink enough tea made from it . The older the roots are , the more potent and powerful . The helicopters are for revenge . If I were the sheriff , brother , I ' d have given them the helicopter and ammunition and sent them to Vietnam to kill all_the f------ Viet Cong in the world. &quot; IF I WERE ARTICULATE AND EDUCATED LIKE YOU , BROTHER . . . But no matter how articulate a Vietnamese becomes , dear brother , when we set foot on the American shore , history is already against us . Vietnam goes_on without us . America goes_on without acknowledging us . We , like our defeated fathers , have become beside the point , a footnote in a small chapter of the history book . Our mythology is merely a private dream in America : There is no war to fight , no heroic quest , no territory to defend , no visible enemies . I remember that day when my father , the South Vietnamese general , remained behind in Vietnam while my family and I escaped to Guam . We sat on a beach near our refugee camp with a_hundred or so Vietnamese countrymen , listening to the_British Broadcasting Corp . detail Saigon ' s fall . I heard screams , saw wailing women tear their hair , saw men beat the sand with their fists , saw children weep . Then as the sun set , an old_man stood_up and sang our national_anthem . &quot; Let ' s go_to the battlefields together , why regret one ' s life ? National blood debts must be avenged by blood . . . . Oh , citizens , sacrifice your lives for the flag . . . . &quot; And so on . But no one joined the old_man in the song . There was only silence . Then my mother whispered a challenge : &quot; We are no longer citizens , we are now ma troi ( wandering ghosts ) . &quot; And the sun , blood red , dissolved into the horizon where Vietnam was , behind my mother ' s words . Silence enshrouded the two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco where 10 of us -- two grandmothers , six grandchildren , two struggling sisters -- made our new home . Our bodies hurtled through the narrow , dark corridors like bats , avoiding the tiny kitchen where only the women were allowed entrance ( and the smell of fish sauce seeped out ) . We ate_in silence ( but always with the television turned_on ) in the dining_room that served as another bedroom at night ; waited silently in_line for the bathroom , took showers together , slept together , yet we negotiated these intimate acts with the gestures of mimes . Why talk at all if everything to be voiced would only invoke sorrow ? Where once we had been lively , upper-middle-class families in that tropical country so far away , here we were mousy , impoverished , miserable exiles living_in a deep , dark hole . The Vietnamese refugee ' s first self-assessment in America is , inevitably , of_his_own helplessness . It is characterized by blushing , by looking down at one ' s feet , by avoiding eye_contact and by waiting : for welfare and food_stamps , for the free clinic exam , for free jackets donated by charity , for green_cards . As for the Vietnamese child , at some point he comes_to the brutal realization that &quot; his &quot; side has lost , and &quot; his &quot; nation is gone ; that his parents are inarticulate fools in a new country called America , and he must face the outside world alone . As I did . One autumn morning in the locker_room of my junior_high , Johnny M. , the blond and blue-eyed boy standing gloriously naked , asked , &quot; Refugee boy , which side were you on ? The winner ' s or the loser ' s ? &quot; English still an unbendable language on my tongue , I answered , &quot; Me : Loser ' s side ! &quot; The locker_room immediately erupted into a chorus of laughter , and I felt Johnny ' s wet towel on my face -- the white_flag , I supposed , to surrender with . In geography class , Mrs . Collier brought_out the new map of East Asia . Vietnam , that country coiling in the voluptuous shape of an S , was no longer mine . It was repainted now in a uniform color -- red -- the South flooded with blood . Mrs . Collier didn ' t know why , exactly , that strange Asian kid , so quiet , suddenly buried his face in his arms and wept . It was my father ' s passion that I was feeling . A couple of months after our arrival , my father , the defeated general , made_it to America . He and Aunty Tuyet ' s husband , a paratroop captain , had commandeered a ship and escaped_from Vietnam . The defeated warriors shattered the silence with tales of battles . The women evacuated to other corners of the apartment , but we boys sat and listened , half in rapture , half in fright . Late at night , over Johnnie Walker whiskey , the living-room warriors recounted the time when they were young and brave and most alive . The Captain : &quot; I remember going_up Cambodia , brother , in ' 71 . We killed so many Viet Cong up there , we lost count . There was this Mien , and he would kill and kill , crazy for blood , and take_out the VC livers and eat them raw . . . . I swear_in front of my ancestral grave I know no one more loyal than that guy. &quot; The General : &quot; Viet Cong were everywhere , hidden in the jungle , in the tall bushes . From my helicopter , I ordered napalm . You could see the balls_of_fire brighten the tree_line when they exploded . I remember an American adviser friend of mine , killed in a helicopter . Incroyable ! Blown up by a SAM missile . My own helicopter was shot at by snipers . We landed before it exploded . But we killed at least 800 of them that day. &quot; How can such language not stir a child ' s imagination ? America is dull by comparison ; it is too real , too impersonal outside the window -- a parking_lot , a supermarket , Coke machines , the fog drifting harsh and cold . But inside , napalm fire , helicopters exploding , paratroopers landing , bombs oozing_out of a drunken warrior ' s fragmented sentences , transforming the dilapidated apartment into a battleground . Did I not hear the wailing voices of Viet Cong under_fire ? Did I not see a helicopter burst into flame ? Smell the burnt flesh ? Outside our apartment there was a stairwell , dark and cool . The voices echoing from it now -- giggling voices trying to be serious -- belonged_to my cousins and me , four child musketeers , swearing a sacred oath of vengeance after our fathers , drunk , had gone_to_bed . We talked_of eradicating the Viet Cong from the face of the earth . &quot; With bazookas , with M16s , with kung_fu power. &quot; &quot; With Bruce Lee ' s swiftness and endurance , we can massacre them all. &quot; &quot; We can bomb the levees north of Hanoi during the monsoon. &quot; I , the 12-year-old , the plotter , offered . &quot; We can flood the nasty Viet Cong out_to the South China Sea. &quot; In this way the dynamic of the exiled Vietnamese family is formed . So I still understand my brother in the coffee_shop . But while he speaks_of vengeance , I have learned a different lesson , the American lesson : the knack of re-inventing oneself . To survive in the New World , we must , likewise , challenge the old_world ' s blood-for-blood ethos and search for a new story line . I am no longer simply Vietnamese . I have changed . I have , like many I know , driven down that hyphen that stretches like a freeway from the mythological kingdom with its 1 # 000-year-old ginseng roots toward the cosmopolitan city , the wind in my hair and Springsteen on the radio . English is a bendable language now , English my own song . I am , for that matter , no longer moved by the old_man ' s martial words on that Guam beach . I believe instead in self-liberation , in American rebirth . But never mind . I am thinking now of those four boys and their fatal gestures and what distinguishes good_guys from bad_guys in the new Vietnamese-American fable . I AM NOT A CATHOLIC . There is no three-tiered shrine in my family ' s living room for martyred saints . My mother is a Buddhist but she stopped praying for a time when we lost the war . My father , born a French citizen when Vietnam was a colony , was given a Christian_name but never went_to church . Unlike the Nguyen brothers , I am only half a Northerner , and I take my cardinal points from the South , from Saigon , my birthplace , where bourgeois sensibilities and Southern irreverence replaces Northern pieties . I have been to Paris and Nice , where my father ' s relatives live and where -- for the first time since leaving Vietnam -- I felt , shamelessly , somehow I had come_home . &quot; The Northerners are fanatics , &quot; my father said at dinner one night after the Good_Guys incident . My father had lived_in Paris and liked wine more_than jasmine tea ; within five years of his arrival in America , he obtained an MBA and lifted us out of poverty into a suburban middle-class life . &quot; The Northerners immolate themselves and talk too readily of martyrdom . They don ' t think rationally . They think emotionally . Tu sais , comme ta mere ! Those boys must have ingested all_the plots for tragedy from their Northern Catholic parents. &quot; My mother dropped her chopsticks and feigned anger . &quot; We Northerners defeated the_French while you drank their wine , &quot; she said , but we all laughed . She was , like the rest of us , also drinking French wine . As the entire family sat there under the gaudy faux-crystal chandelier , in my parent ' s five-bedroom house with its kidney-shaped swimming_pool , the irony did not escape us : Historical tragedy had come_to seem beside the point . How did this happen ? Perhaps only a loser knows real freedom . Forced outside of history , away from home and hearth , he can choose to remake himself . One night America seeps in , and out goes the Vietnamese soul of sorrow . For the Vietnamese refugee family , the past is an enigma best left ( at least temporarily ) alone . Didn ' t I see America invade the household when the conversation at dinner in our new home leaned slowly but surely toward real_estate and escrow , toward jobs and cars and GPAs and overtime and vacation plans -- the language of the American_dream ? Even my father ' s dinner conversation had shifted to memories of an earlier time , a time before the war , when B-52 bombs were not falling and Vietnam was a lush tropical paradise or when he was living_in Paris as a young_man , tempestuously in_love . But I suspect irony was a luxury unavailable to those young_men . Without the warriors-turned-businessmen , the pool , the chandelier above the dining_room table to anchor them in a more complex reality , their passions remained colored by old-world vehemence . A big difference between me and them was that my father helped me with my homework . I trusted my father ' s version of America , that &quot; it was built when Europe dumped its nonconformists on America ' s shore. &quot; That to make_it in America , you need shrewdness , flexibility and a good aptitude for knowing your place in the world . My father , who saw himself as living_in exile , nevertheless taught me how to interpret Walter Cronkite ' s bad news , taught me how to drive . I did not , because of my father ' s help , fail school . That singularly most important American-making institution embraced me and rejected those boys . I am also nearly seven years older than Loi Nguyen , old enough to record the actual war in my memories as an army brat . I do not need John Woo ' s slo-mo gore . Because I thought it through myself years ago , I know the illogic of killing Viet Cong from helicopters in peacetime -- how would you distinguish them from ordinary Vietnamese ? Which conical-hatted figure would you shoot ? A FRIEND WHO WORKS IN Palawan refugee camp in the Philippines recently sent me a poem he found carved on a stone under a tamarind_tree . Written by an unknown Vietnamese boat person , it tells how to escape tragedy . &quot; Your mind is like a radio that you can dial to a different voice . It depends_on you . So do not keep your mind always tuned to sorrow . If you want , just change the channel. &quot; When I turned 30 recently , years after I switched the dial , as it were , my father said , &quot; At your age I was already a colonel. &quot; &quot; We are very different now , Dad , &quot; I snapped , a little irritated . &quot; I don ' t have a need to be a warrior here in America. &quot; My father smiled a sad , knowing smile . What relevant words of wisdom can an exiled general pass down to his fully grown American son , the one whom he sometimes introduces to his ex-army buddies as &quot; the American one , &quot; which in Vietnamese could translate , depending_on the context , as &quot; bad , &quot; &quot; soulless &quot; or &quot; traitor &quot; ? As I think_about those young_men and what they did , I realize that I , in Vietnamese eyes , haven ' t been a very good son . I had denounced my father ' s passion for his homeland as parochialism , had learned to listen to his war stories as tales of nostalgia , had , in fact , taken the private angst of his generation and disseminated it in public light -- an unfilial act . I imagine the Nguyen brothers adoring their father , the ex-sergeant of the South Vietnamese army . They must have loved and trusted his war stories . According to the Sacramento Bee , the Nguyen brothers had folded their arms , the Vietnamese filial pious gesture , and asked their parents for permission to leave the house that fateful day . This image haunts me . They tried to bring dignity to their father by fighting his war . They coveted being good Vietnamese sons : To assuage the old_man ' s grief , the young_man must defeat his old_man ' s enemy . But Hamlet ' s unfocused vehemence is not to my taste , his bloody rampage to be his father ' s son inappropriate to the New World . I am more intrigued by the complicated character of Indar in V.S. Naipaul ' s &quot; A Bend in The River , &quot; who has lost his family home and fortune to political upheavals and been forced outside of territorial boundaries . &quot; I am lucky , &quot; he said , &quot; I carry the world within me . . . . I ' m tired_of being_on the losing side . I want to win and win and win. &quot; &quot; To be or not to be &quot; is no longer the question , for some of us Vietnamese children in America have learned to escape the outdated passions . These days , after a weekend visit I hug my mother but cannot approach my father . We regard each other instead from a distance , nod , and no more . We are veterans from different wars , and I have won mine . A MILE OR SO FROM THE Good_Guys store , at the newest plot in St . Mary ' s Cemetery , flanked by a large statue of St . Pius and an American flag , Long and Pham Nguyen are buried side_by_side . It takes awhile to find their tombstones behind the pink mausoleum . It is late afternoon , and a_few birds chirp as the sprinklers spray mist that forms rainbows . The only other visitors at St . Mary ' s are a Vietnamese family busy burning incense sticks . The smoke , blown by a warm breeze , wavers alluringly . This desert-like landscape , with it sandalwood fragrance , is not part of Joan Didion ' s California anymore . The dark epic journeys that end in California have new players . Searching for the Nguyen brothers ' tombstones , I find names that leave a kind of phosphorescence on my mind -- names like Le , Tran , Vuong , Nguyen -- Vietnamese last_names that once belonged_to emperors of millennia passed , etched on new tombstones on plots where the grass has not yet fully grown . Between the two brothers ' tombstones I place ginseng roots , $ 10.99 a box_in a Vietnamese grocery_store . The box has a plastic cover with the American Stars and Stripes painted on it . And printed in the lower right-hand corner is the word USA .</TEXT>
