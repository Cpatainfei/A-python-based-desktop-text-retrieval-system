   <HEADLINE> A WEEK AFTER HIS DEATH , NIXON ' S CRITICS SURFACE ; PRESIDENCY : THOSE WHO KEPT A RESPECTFUL SILENCE ARE SAYING ' ENOUGH ALREADY. ' SUPPORTERS SAY PRAISE IS LONG DUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eulogizing his old boss here last week , even Henry A . Kissinger couldn ' t help note the irony : Richard Nixon himself -- the man who kept a list of &quot; enemies &quot; in the media -- probably would have been overwhelmed by all_the good press he ' d been getting after his death . The tributes for Nixon were unending , the tones reverent . Imagery of King Lear and Sophocles , of an indomitable warrior and an anguished soul , of reconciliation and forgiveness -- all were dominant themes in the media for days . But now , particularly in the days since Nixon ' s burial , the tone of public_debate seems to have shifted again , as_many critics who had maintained a respectful silence have begun to demand a harsher assessment of a man who never gave_up reinventing himself . For them , the plaudits had grown too loud , too quickly . &quot; Now we ' re seeing the backlash the other way , &quot; said Daniel Schorr , a commentator for National Public Radio , who earned a spot on Nixon ' s &quot; enemies list &quot; in the early 1970s . The protests of &quot; enough already &quot; have come from a variety of forums -- from radio call-in shows to letters to the editor and television and newspaper commentaries . Stanley Kutler , a University of Wisconsin historian who wrote a book on Watergate and has waged a years-long legal battle for access to more of Nixon ' s records , says he is confident that the critical eye of history will largely erase the current wave of pro-Nixon nostalgia . &quot; I expected this kind of outpouring . Nixon spent 20 years working for it , &quot; Kutler said . &quot; But in the final analysis , whatever space he gets_in the history books will begin with this sentence : ' Richard Nixon , the first U . S . President to resign because of scandal . . . ' &quot; Said Tom Wicker , a New York Times columnist who wrote a widely cited biography of Nixon : &quot; This outpouring of eulogies and great long lines ( at the Yorba Linda viewing ) show there was always a lot of support for Mr. Nixon among people who regretted he had to resign . . . . Out of a certain respect for the dead , ( critics ) haven ' t had much to say lately . And only now are they coming_around to say , ' Wait a second , let ' s look_at reality. ' &quot; Perhaps the most personal plea for more balance in the public ' s ongoing farewells to Nixon has come from Jack Sirica , the son of the late federal judge who became famous because of Watergate . A reporter for Newsday in Long_Island , N.Y. , Sirica said that colleagues had been urging him since Nixon ' s death to write a column on his father and Nixon . He resisted for several days , he said , fearing his assessment would sound too harsh . But Sirica said he changed his mind last week when he passed a school on his way to work and saw children playing_around a flag at half-staff . * He had already read a story saying many children thought Nixon was a pretty good_guy , and it was then , seeing that flag , that he decided to write a column . The piece recounted his father ' s disillusionment in listening to the infamous Watergate tapes , and it ran the day after Nixon ' s funeral under a headline that read : &quot; My Dad Decided Nixon Was a Crook. &quot; &quot; What concerned me more_than anything was that the enormity of the crime seemed to have been getting lost , &quot; Sirica , 41 , said in an interview . &quot; Watergate had become , if not a minor footnote , then at least something that could be quickly dispensed_with in the historical record. &quot; But for many among the conservative supporters that Nixon liked to refer to as the Silent Majority , the adulation will continue unabated for the onetime hero of the GOP . They see this as a time of long-overdue recognition for a man who has been unfairly vilified because of a single event in an otherwise distinguished career of public_service . Even after a state funeral attended by dignitaries from around the world Wednesday , mourners continued to turn_out by the thousands throughout the week to pay their respects_to the freshly sodded grave at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda . Brian Hayes , 32 , took two days_off work as a substitute teacher to pay homage to Nixon , and he waited patiently in_line for the library to reopen to the public Thursday . &quot; My interest in politics came_about because of him . I consider him the greatest statesman we ever had , &quot; the Long_Beach man said . &quot; Despite Watergate , there ' s an outpouring of affection for the man , and I think he richly deserves it. &quot; Cheri Pepka , 24 , of Rancho Santa Margarita , cooed softly to her four small children about Nixon ' s accomplishments as they waited to sign a guest book at the library , and she told them about a scrapbook she had started to commemorate his life and death . &quot; One day you ' ll understand all_of this . You ' ll understand what he meant to our country , &quot; she promised the children . Democrats and Republicans alike stressed similar themes in the days following Nixon ' s death on April 22 , pointing to the establishment of diplomatic relations with the People ' s Republic_of_China , an arms control agreement with the former Soviet_Union , an end to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam_War , and other achievements in foreign affairs . Indeed , praise came from what once would have seemed unlikely corners . President Clinton -- who came of political age in the 1960s while protesting Nixon ' s policies in Vietnam -- called_for a national &quot; day of mourning &quot; and delivered an eloquent eulogy on Nixon ' s legacy . And former Sen . George McGovern , who also attended the funeral , spoke in an interview after the service about &quot; reconciling &quot; with the man who helped derail McGovern ' s own failed bid for the Presidency in 1972 through a campaign of &quot; dirty tricks. &quot; &quot; About Nixon , Leaders Stress Triumphs , Not Downfall , &quot; trumpeted the New York Times on its April 24 front page , a refrain carried by other newspapers around the country . The favorable media coverage that Kissinger noted at last week ' s funeral reflects a combination of dynamics -- some that are particular to Nixon himself , others that are inevitable in any attempt to gauge public_opinion , media and political observers say . * In part , the positive reaction reflects the enormous efforts that Nixon made to rehabilitate his image , writing 10 books after his resignation and making frequent appearances on the world stage . As Schorr of NPR said : &quot; He spent 20 years running_for ex-President. &quot; In part , it reflects the overwhelming pomp and circumstance of the first_state funeral for a President in more_than two decades . And in part , it reflects the feeling that there is something unseemly about criticizing someone who has just died -- no matter his scandals . &quot; It ' s almost an America truism that you speak no ill of the dead , &quot; said KABC radio talk-show host Michael Jackson . &quot; I had one caller ( on Nixon ) who said : ' My mother always told me if you don ' t have anything nice to say , don ' t say anything at all . So goodby. ' &quot; Yet Jackson said callers to his show resisted the general portrayal of Nixon in the media , openly criticizing the former President by about a 4:1 margin . &quot; They have been tough and blunt and to_the_point -- that he ' s been given a free ride , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; I was quite surprised . There were people who identified themselves as Republicans , and even they criticized him. &quot; Several scholars and media critics said they believe that Nixon ' s treatment in_the_public_eye after his death is an inevitable and , in some respects , appropriate phenomenon . &quot; When somebody dies , you try and look_at the good things he did , &quot; said Stephen Hess , a noted student of the media with the Brookings Institution in Washington . &quot; We were not there to write Richard Nixon ' s place in history , but to bury him . What you saw ( in media coverage ) was in part good manners and in part tradition , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t really think that ' s the time to be looking_for balance. &quot; But Dick O ' Neill , a longtime Democratic activist in Orange County who headed the state party , said he was overwhelmed by the glowing coverage that Nixon received . &quot; I thought , ' Jesus , this is really something . They ' re burying a field_marshal , ' &quot; he said . &quot; It just blew my mind , considering the guy was almost impeached . To say , ' It ' s over with , let ' s forget it , ' I think that ' s the best way . &quot; But the people here in Orange County , they went bananas . . . . The young people especially -- I don ' t know what happened to them . They amazed me how shook_up they were , as if some relative had died , &quot; he mused . The low point for him , O ' Neill said , came when an aide working_on a Democratic campaign -- &quot; a young , progressive Democrat , &quot; he stressed -- volunteered to drive a car for the Nixon funeral last week to help transport dignitaries . &quot; It was beyond me , &quot; he said . Kutler , the Wisconsin historian , isn ' t worried , though . The Nixon biographer and critic says he figures that in three months , when the 20th anniversary of Nixon ' s resignation is recounted around the country , the fickle currents of public_opinion will find Nixon ' s supporters on the defensive once more . &quot; Then everyone ' s going_to remember again , they ' re going to remember the humiliation that this country went_through , the national disgrace , &quot; he said . &quot; And they ' ll get_it all straight again. &quot; * Times staff writer Lee Romney contributed to this report .</TEXT>
