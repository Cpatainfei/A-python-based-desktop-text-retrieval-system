   <HEADLINE> RIGHTISTS WIN HISTORIC VOTE IN ITALY ; EUROPE : MEDIA TYCOON SILVIO BERLUSCONI IS FRONT-RUNNER FOR PRIME_MINISTER . HIS THREE-PARTY ALLIANCE LEADS IN BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT . CORRUPTION FUROR PROPELS SHIFT FROM CENTRIST RULE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two months after his debut as a politician , media billionaire Silvio Berlusconi led right-wing forces Monday to an unprecedented victory in Italian national elections , emerging as the front-runner to become prime_minister . In elections termed the most critical in more_than four decades for a country convulsed by longstanding government corruption , Berlusconi ' s restive , three-party alliance trounced traditionally dominant centrist parties and outdistanced once-favored leftists running as a movement of Progressives . For Italy , installation of a right-wing government would mean moves toward a streamlined bureaucracy , intensified free-market economics with attendant labor unrest and , perhaps , evolution toward a political landscape sharply divided between the left and right . The rightist government could be destabilized by internal squabbles , but Italy ' s democratic institutions are not at_issue and neither are its commitments to NATO or the European Union . Projections before dawn this morning gave the right substantial pluralities in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate . Berlusconi ' s alliance had about 46 % nationwide for the Chamber and 40 % or so for the Senate . Next in both chambers were the leftists , led by the former Italian Communist_Party , with 34 % or so . Centrist parties , which have controlled all 52 Italian governments since World_War_II , were getting_about 16 % -- less than half their traditional vote . Final returns later today will show the extent of Berlusconi ' s victory , which , one of his three nationwide television channels reported , may include an absolute_majority in the Senate . Berlusconi , 57 , not only headed the national campaign of his new Forza Italia ( Go , Italy ) movement but also ran as a candidate , easily winning a seat in the Chamber of Deputies from central Rome . His allies also prospered in an election under new winner-take-all rules_in which 80 % of candidates were running_for the first time . Among them , movie director Franco Zeffirelli won a Senate seat in Catania , Sicily . In Naples , Alessandra Mussolini , granddaughter of former dictator Benito Mussolini , was reelected to the lower house as candidate of a neo-fascist party allied_with Berlusconi . &quot; The right has won , &quot; glumly reported the Rome newspaper La Repubblica , a bulwark of Berlusconi foes who argued that he had joined politics principally to advance business interests that include the country ' s largest advertising_agency , a chain of supermarkets and Milan -- Italy ' s champion professional soccer team . A self-made man who once worked as a singer on cruise_ships , Berlusconi campaigned in Cold_War terms , portraying himself as a crusader against communism . Early today , in what amounted to a victory speech , he told reporters from his TV networks that &quot; a_few months ago we started with great fear . There was a leftist team ready to take power . We were facing an uncertain future , moving toward a ( totalitarian ) regime. &quot; Berlusconi made clear that he expects President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to ask him to form a government . &quot; We will know how to run a good government for all Italians , guaranteeing freedom for all , &quot; he said . Running with the neo-fascist National Alliance and the secessionist Northern League , Berlusconi promised Italians more jobs and lower taxes under a government wed to free-market economics , conservative Christian values , controlled immigration and law and order . Gianfranco Fini , leader of the National Alliance , easily won election to Parliament on Monday , as did Umberto Bossi , founder of the League . Although both were aligned with Berlusconi for the election , Bossi insists that he will have nothing to do with the neo-fascists . Neither will he docilely follow Berlusconi ' s lead . &quot; Berlusconi thinks we are his . We ' re not , &quot; Bossi said early today . For the left , Monday ' s returns were one more cruel blow in an always-a-bridesmaid search for power . Since World_War_II , Italian Communists -- now social democratic and renamed the Party of the Democratic Left -- had always finished second to the Christian Democrats . Monday , when the Christian Democrats slumped , the ex-Communists and allied parties running as Progressives finished second to Berlusconi ' s new right . &quot; The Progressives are a force that came_into the field for the first time . . . . We must stay there , &quot; said party leader Achille Occhetto , who acknowledged the rightist victory but wondered whether campaign unity could survive the strains of forming a government . In Milan , the stock_market rose almost 4 % Monday , its strongest showing of the year on double the average volume of the past two weeks . Analysts said investors were betting_on a Berlusconi victory and a stable , right government to follow . The lira also strengthened Monday against both the dollar and the German mark in the closing hours of the two-day vote . The outgoing Parliament had authorized the second day of voting to accommodate religiously observant members of Italy ' s small Jewish community . Polls remained open until 10 p.m. Monday to allow Jews to vote after Passover celebration ended at sundown . Berlusconi , who lives_in Milan but was a candidate for Parliament from central Rome , was among the late voters at a school in the former Jewish ghetto . Tanned and polished , he drew applause from some passersby and one objection : &quot; Fascist , out of the ghetto ! &quot; shouted one man . In a middle-class nation where 40 % of voters have traditionally stuck_to the center , Berlusconi essentially filled a vacuum left by centrist parties , scarred in the country ' s worst corruption scandal . Centrist reformer Mario Segni was courted by both Berlusconi and Occhetto but decided to ally_with the largest remnant of the Christian Democrats . Berlusconi wound_up in alliance with the coarse Bossi and the polished Fini because the center would n ' t have him . Occhetto , meantime , had patiently assembled the leftist alliance with bedmates as diverse as anti-Mafia reformers , environmentalists and unabashed Marxists who defiantly broke from his party to form Refounded Communism . Occhetto , who took leadership of the West ' s largest Communist_Party in 1988 just as communism was dying , changed the name to Democratic Party of the Left ( PDS ) in 1991 and marched to social_democracy , taking all but the most extreme 15 % of its members with him . The PDS was relatively undamaged by the ongoing scandal known as Tangentopoli ( Kickback City ) , in which most of the country ' s leading companies paid millions of dollars in bribes and payoffs in exchange for public contracts . Amid the scandal , the outgoing Parliament , hundreds of whose members face corruption probes once they leave_office , added finishing touches to an electoral reform mandated by referendum last year . Under the new rules , three-quarters of the the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies and the 315-seat Senate were elected in winner-take-all votes . The rest were selected proportionately according to the overall votes of their parties .</TEXT>
