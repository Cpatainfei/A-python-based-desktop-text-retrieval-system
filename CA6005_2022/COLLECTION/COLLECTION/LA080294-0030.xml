   <TEXT> There ' s a lot of history in , around and under the streets and buildings of modern Beirut , enough to get_in the way of eager archeologists . The most recent historical overlay is a definite pain . When peace finally came_to the city in 1990 , after 15 years of civil_war , the first_teams to start work were not academics but mine-disposal experts of the Lebanese army . Once the military ' s work was done , the archeologists found they had to do battle with people more interested in building a new Beirut than in finding the old one . The demolition of war-ravaged buildings downtown , as well as rebuilding , is the responsibility of the Lebanese Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut Central District , known as Solidere , its French acronym . The company is also responsible_for preservation of the area ' s archeological sites , including the ancient Phoenician port and the more recent Islamic city . When Solidere ' s engineers announced that they would blow_up the Rivoli movie_house , the archeologists at the Phoenician site -- just a firecracker ' s throw behind the condemned structure -- began fingering their worry beads . On July 5 , Solidere ' s engineers bored holes , laid more_than 2 # 500 pounds of explosives and carefully aimed the blast so it pitched the theater forward , away from the Phoenician site . As giant clouds of dust rolled_off the pancaked building , the engineers scuttled alongside the groaning structure to the archeological dig . Grins showed under their yellow hard_hats as they pronounced the site free_of damage -- other_than a thick layer of modern dust settling_on the 3 # 000-year-old walls of the Phoenician city . The Phoenicians called their city Berytus . It was_on the eastern Mediterranean coast at the foot of the Lebanon Mountains and became an important center of Mediterranean trade . Through the centuries , the site was occupied by Romans , Arabs , Crusaders and Ottoman Turks , all adding_to its archeological treasures , before Lebanon became independent in this century after French dominion . Until the past few years , there had been little archeological digging in Beirut because the city had been continuously occupied since Phoenician times . So when bulldozers paired_off with dump_trucks in July to clear the Rivoli site , the archeologists buzzed with anticipation . They recalled rumors that ancient structures had been buried beneath the cement floor of the theater when it was erected in the late 1940s . What was found , under the watchful eye of Leila Badr , an American University of Beirut archeologist , was a well-preserved Phoenician glacis ( sloped wall ) just 20 inches beneath the asphalt of a modern road . Budgeting_for a bulldozer had never crossed the mind of Helga Seeden , another AUB archeologist , when her team began excavating an Islamic site in downtown Beirut . Seeden had as much to learn about urban archeology -- and its tools -- as her students did when the dig began this summer . Until the current digs , the history of Phoenician Beirut had to be pieced together from documents . The archeological sources remained largely untouched . Important pre-Phoenician cut-rock tombs from Beirut ' s earliest days had been accidentally bulldozed in 1954 while workers dug foundations for a building . Fortunately , much of the funerary material was salvaged . In this summer ' s digs , coffee_breaks at the Islamic site took_on a special meaning after a bulldozer unearthed a coffee_cup dating to the 1940s , a recent clue to the earlier culture . The site -- dating to 1517 -- was the sanctuary of an eminent Islamic religious authority , Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Iraq Dimashqi , who lived there until he left for Mecca , where he later died . His son returned to Beirut in 1540 , with a newly popular drink called qahweh , which came_into English as coffee . During Dimashqi ' s time , coffee was viewed with suspicion by religious_leaders , who forbade drinking it in Islamic Beirut . But in later eras , Beirut ' s port grew rich exporting coffee to European markets . Seeden , head of the Islamic dig , says ignorance can be as destructive to a site as a bulldozer . She recalled the loss of the neolithic site of Kamed el Loz in the Bekaa Valley . During 20 seasons of excavations , German teams failed to explain their work to the locals . When the Germans left , before the Israeli invasion of 1982 , the villagers tore_into the site in search of treasure , badly damaging the dig . The next stop for Beirut ' s bulldozers is an area behind three major downtown churches . From ancient texts , archeologists know that Beirut ' s renowned school of Roman_law was in this area . Dr. Hareth Boustany , a consultant with Solidere on archeology and heritage , says the rulings and texts that issued from the school became the basis for European law systems in_use today . In the 6th Century , Boustany says , a Greek historian wrote : &quot; Until all_the world follows the laws of Beirut , there will be no peace. &quot; Peace has arrived in Beirut , but watching Seeden and her noisy bulldozers it seems some time may pass before there is_quiet .</TEXT>
