   <HEADLINE> THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY : SHIELDING SIMPSON JURY SELECTION IN NAME OF EFFICIENCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many people wonder how much more of a circus the Simpson case could become . If the Los Angeles Superior_Court ' s 22-page &quot; media plan &quot; for the O.J. Simpson murder trial is any indication , the folks who prepared it are expecting the overblown coverage to explode in size and intensity . Generally , the guide is an attempt to impose discipline on traditionally anarchic reporters . For example , it says , &quot; If a press representative who has been assigned a seat ( in the courtroom ) does not claim it within 15 minutes after court convenes for each morning and each afternoon session , the seat will be given to another press representative. &quot; I was more interested in a section that provides a list of places to eat and drink Downtown . Among places near the Criminal_Courts Building was the Epicentre , where a lot of Times reporters and editors eat and drink . I like the Epicentre . But the authors should have also listed the Redwood on 2nd Street , a hangout for generations of trial and crime reporters , criminal lawyers and bail bondsmen who continue to exchange gossip and facts over its well-worn bar . * The plan also contains a section that is stirring more serious controversy -- a section that The Times is now urging Judge Lance A . Ito to reconsider . Ito , who is presiding over the Simpson case , has sharply restricted the presence of the press in the courtroom during jury selection , which begins Sept . 26 . Only one reporter , respected trial reporter Linda Deutsch of Associated Press , will be allowed to actually observe the lengthy jury selection process . She will pass along her observations to other members of the press , who will be able to listen to the proceeding in a courthouse press room . For the public at_large , jury selection will not be broadcast in any form . Jerrianne Hayslett , a court public affairs official , said the judge imposed the restriction because there is limited space in the small courtroom . &quot; There is a large jury pool . The judge wants to get_in as_many prospective jurors in the courtroom as possible , &quot; Hayslett said . &quot; He is even adding chairs in the courtroom . There will be no member of the public present . The one reporter will represent the public via the media. &quot; In some respects , I can see the judge ' s side . The first 250 people in the Simpson jury pool will report to the Criminal_Courts Building jury assembly room at 8:30 a.m. Sept . 26 . They ' ll be hustled up_to the courtroom in groups for questioning that will eliminate most of them . Ito , who has summoned a pool of 1 # 000 potential jurors , wants to work his way through the questioning as quickly as he can . But there is another side to the issue . Although efficiency is the judge ' s stated motive , his limit on coverage could also be interpreted as another in a continuing judicial effort to shield jurors from the outside world and to protect them from the intrusive and upsetting media circus . The juror protection movement started several years ago , about the same time TV gained access to covering trials . The movement gained impetus when violent crime became a major public issue and some jurors expressed fear of reprisal from outraged friends and relatives of defendants . Those fears are expressed in a new movie , &quot; Trial by Jury , &quot; which tells the story of a juror in a trial of a murderous gangster . The gangster ' s crew threatens to harm her 7-year-old son unless she votes not_guilty and persuades some of her fellow jurors to go_along . The juror protection movement has really taken_hold in the southeastern Los Angeles County communities of Downey and Bellflower . There , two Municipal Court judges have issued orders forbidding the release of names of jurors in all criminal trials . The court clerks know the names , but to everyone else the jurors are known by the numbers on their badges . Jurors have been given the protection of anonymity in cases in which the judge thinks they are in danger . It happened in the Rodney G . King beating trial and the trials of the men accused of beating Reginald O . Denny . But the fact that judges are imposing anonymity in every criminal case in Downey and Bellflower shows how far the juror protection movement has gone . As one lawyer told Times writer Catherine Gewertz , &quot; I tried a death_penalty ( case ) in Downtown recently and they didn ' t have an anonymous jury there . And here I am in Bellflower , representing a prominent surgeon for driving under the influence , and they want to use an anonymous jury . My client wasn ' t a dangerous guy who was some threat to the jury . It was ridiculous. &quot; * It ' s easy to sympathize_with nervous jurors . With the inconvenience , low pay and bad working conditions the county heaps on jurors and prospective jurors , the added fear of getting beat_up by a defendant ' s relatives is too_much . It ' s also easy to understand a juror ' s fear of the media frenzy overwhelming the Simpson trial . You ' ve seen those scenes in movies where hysterical reporters and TV crews chase people down corridors and streets ? They ' re not an exaggeration . Judge Ito said he is limiting media access to jury selection in the name of efficiency . But even if he doesn ' t intend it that way , his order will limit what the public knows about the Simpson jury selection process . Worse yet , limiting reporters ' access will drive them to heights of rudeness -- and ingenuity in getting their stories -- never envisioned by the authors of the Superior_Court ' s media guide .</TEXT>
