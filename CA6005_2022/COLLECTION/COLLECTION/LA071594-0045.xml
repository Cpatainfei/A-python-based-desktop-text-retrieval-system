   <HEADLINE> THE AUTEUR WHO COINED THE WORD ; COMMENTARY : A JEAN RENOIR EXPERT SAYS UCLA ' S RETROSPECTIVE ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER AGE-OLD QUESTIONS ABOUT ART .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Long before any director with the right agent could get his name in a special box on the billboard , Jean Renoir was considered to be one of a handful of filmmakers whose artistic stamp could be found everywhere in their work . Renoir himself called such directors auteurs , directors who wrote their own scripts . But the term was later expanded to identify those directors whose personal vision could overcome the fragmentations of a collaborative art . Whatever the status of the auteur theory as a way of determining cinematic value , the passionate commitment to the work of individual directors argued in the 1950s by Andre Bazin and such critics-into-filmmakers as Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard helped create an argument for the importance of film as a major art_form based on the existence of major artists . In that argument Renoir ' s films were central . A new postwar film audience was awakening to the work of Truffaut , Goddard , Antonioni , Rossellini , Fellini and Bergman , and it was Renoir ' s &quot; La Grande Illusion &quot; ( 1937 ) and &quot; La Regle de Jeu &quot; ( &quot; The Rules of the Game , &quot; 1939 ) that first stirred a good_part of that audience to believe that there was a particularly cinematic complexity of ideas , performances and imagery worth comparing to the established arts . Time was that anyone living_in a big city or college town could get an education in film history by just going_to the local film society or repertory theater . Now , only in retrospectives like one that begins at UCLA today do we get a chance to ask those old questions about the shape of a director ' s career and the value of individual works : What lasts ? What do we still watch with pleasure , interest and even illumination ? Renoir was born in 1894 , the second son of Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir . His older brother Pierre became an actor and appears in Jean ' s &quot; La Nuit du Carrefour &quot; ( 1932 ) as Simenon ' s Inspector Maigret , in &quot; Madame Bovary &quot; ( 1934 ) as Charles Bovary and in &quot; La Marseillaise &quot; ( 1938 ) as Louis XVI . Pierre ' s son Claude worked as a cinematographer on several of Jean ' s films from the mid-1930s onward . UCLA ' s centenaire focuses_on Renoir ' s career to 1939 , when the filmmaker immigrated to the United States , settling in Beverly Hills and making five more films during World_War_II . A film enthusiast whose childhood interest had been reawakened by an enforced period of recuperation from a war wound , Renoir in the early 1920s produced and wrote the script for &quot; Catherine &quot; ( 1924 ) , starring his wife , Catherine Hessling , who had been one of his father ' s models . It was directed by Albert Dieudonne , later the star of Abel Gance ' s epic &quot; Napoleon &quot; ( 1927 ) . * But Renoir was disappointed with what Dieudonne had done . He gave_up a career as a ceramicist and sold several of his father ' s paintings to finance his first feature , &quot; La Fille de l ' Eau &quot; ( 1924 ) , the story of a young_girl ( again played by Hessling ) who lives_on a barge with her brutal uncle . ( The only painting he kept was a large one depicting himself dressed as a hunter . It now hangs_in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. ) Between &quot; La Fille de l ' Eau &quot; and &quot; Rules of the Game , &quot; Renoir made 18 features and several shorter films , including the &quot; long shorts &quot; &quot; La Petite Marchande aux Allumettes &quot; ( &quot; The Little Match Girl , &quot; 1928 ) , &quot; On Purge Bebe &quot; ( 1931 ) and &quot; Partie de Campagne &quot; ( &quot; A Day in the Country , &quot; 1936 , completed in 1946 ) . With the exception of &quot; Rules of the Game &quot; and &quot; Grande Illusion , &quot; the films of this period are rarely shown , and the UCLA programmers have included virtually everything Renoir made , with the exception of the lost feature &quot; Marguita &quot; and the lost short &quot; Le Petit Chaperon Rouge &quot; ( &quot; Little Red Riding Hood &quot; ) . &quot; On Purge Bebe &quot; and &quot; Chotard et Cie &quot; ( 1933 ) are being shown for the first time in the United States , and many of the other films are being shown in Renoir ' s own copies , willed to UCLA . These include &quot; Le Tournoi &quot; ( 1929 ) , a story of romance and politics set_in the 16th-Century France of Catherine de Medicis , which was previously thought to exist only in a 10-minute fragment . The tremendous variety of Renoir ' s work in the 1920s and 1930s seems amazing today when a director is considered remarkably talented if he or she can work in two genres , and a genius if in three . Throughout his career Renoir was constantly experimenting with genres and styles , often within the same film . Equally fascinated by stylized sets and location shooting , he freely mingled artifice and realism in both his plots and his images . The general impression of the benevolence of Renoir ' s films may be_due to associating them with the dappled , rosy nudes of his father ' s paintings . But there is little here of Pierre-Auguste Renoir ' s frequent blandness and prettification . These films of the 1920s and 1930s , in both subject_matter and pictorial style , more resemble the harsh urban interiors of Toulouse-Lautrec or the shimmering uncertainties of Monet ' s gardens . &quot; La Fille de l ' Eau &quot; marks the beginning of a silent-film career that included adaptations of Zola ' s &quot; Nana &quot; ( also starring Hessling ) , &quot; Le Tournoi &quot; and &quot; Le Bled , &quot; an innocently imperialist paean to the settlement of Algeria . By the end of the ' 20s , however , these films in the lavish silent style ( perhaps in emulation of his early idol Erich von Stroheim ) had given Renoir a reputation for being an expensive filmmaker . * In 1931 with &quot; On Purge Bebe , &quot; an adaptation of a Feydeau farce , Renoir became one of the few French directors to make the silent-to-sound transition by proving he could make a film cheaply and quickly ( five weeks from scriptwriting to breaking_even ) , while outrageously exploiting the new technology ( the first toilet flushing on a soundtrack ) . Despite his commitment to the auteur director , Renoir was equally fascinated with the energy and movement of performers , and his camera itself increasingly plays the role of an observer within the scene rather than a God-like eye above it , even in epic works like &quot; Le Tournoi. &quot; He also acts , notably in &quot; Rules of the Game , &quot; and his films are filled with memorable faces and presences : Hessling in his early films ; Valentine Tessler in &quot; Madame Bovary &quot; ; Charles Blavette in &quot; Toni &quot; ( 1935 ) ; Jean Gabin in &quot; Grande Illusion , &quot; &quot; The Lower Depths &quot; and &quot; La Bete Humaine &quot; ( 1938 ) ; Marcel Dalio in &quot; Grande Illusion &quot; and &quot; Rules of the Game &quot; and , perhaps most strikingly , Michel Simon in &quot; Boudu Saved From Drowning &quot; ( 1932 ) , which Renoir called &quot; a kind of free exercise around an actor , &quot; and on which Paul Mazursky based &quot; Down and Out in Beverly Hills. &quot; Many of these films deal with people trapped by their own passions . &quot; La Chienne &quot; ( 1931 ) , starring Simon as a meek clerk who kills his mistress , is a forerunner of the stories of betrayal that would preoccupy film noir 15 years later . &quot; La Nuit du Carrefour &quot; ( 1932 ) exploits even more the shadows , mists and water-slick streets of a detective thriller . &quot; Toni ' s &quot; story of murder and desire , set among Italian laborers in the south of France , presages Italian neorealism and further underlines this strongly fatalistic streak , as does Renoir ' s adaptation of Zola ' s &quot; La Bete Humaine. &quot; Both &quot; La Bete &quot; and &quot; La Chienne &quot; were later remade by Fritz Lang as &quot; Human Desire &quot; ( 1954 ) and &quot; Scarlet Street &quot; ( 1945 ) . Similarly , Renoir ' s version of Gorki ' s &quot; The Lower Depths &quot; ( 1936 ) might be compared to Akira Kurosawa ' s ( 1957 ) -- rare opportunities to see how two great directors treat the same material . But even in the films shadowed by an encroaching sense of doom , there is a vein of optimism about what the world would be like if other choices were possible . One of the most intriguing of Renoir ' s films of the 1930s , &quot; The Crime of M . Lange &quot; ( 1935 ) , bears his name not only as director but also as a member of a radical culture collective , the Groups Octobre . The compatriots behind the camera are mirrored in the story of a publishing_house for which Lange writes tales about a hero named Arizona Jim and an American West he has never seen . When the conniving publisher seems to have died in a train wreck , the workers take_over and become tremendously successful . * With the kind of creative prescience that Renoir shows in many other films of the period , Lange is an early version of the kind of the sometimes sardonic , sometimes affectionate view of popular culture that would inspire the directors of the New Wave . As in &quot; La Vie est a Nous &quot; ( 1936 ) , a &quot; March of Time &quot; -like fiction documentary made as an anti-fascist recruiting film for the_French Communist_Party , Lange asserted the possibility of a collective moral response that still respected individual eccentricity and difference . Similarly , in &quot; La Marseillaise &quot; ( 1938 ) , Renoir views the_French Revolution through its most famous song , as it evolves from a popular folk tune to become the national_anthem . With comparable revolutionary optimism about film economics , the film was financed by two-franc contributions by members of the CGT , the_French trade_union . UCLA ' s showings conclude with &quot; Rules of the Game , &quot; which opened in 1939 to ferocious attacks by French fascist groups . Re-editing was fruitless , and the film was later banned by the Vichy regime . Renoir ' s flight from Europe to America occurred not long after the release of &quot; Rules of the Game , &quot; and his later films have their own appeal . But the work of few directors of any period have the continuity and variety as Renoir ' s from 1924 to 1939 , and fewer still would reward anything like a complete submersion in the sun and shadow , the complex warmth of the world he makes entirely his own .
