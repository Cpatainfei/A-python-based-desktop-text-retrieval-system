   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; BREAKING NOSE OF SPAIN ' S ENRIQUE COSTS ITALY ' S TASSOTTI EIGHT GAMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> FIFA went_to the videotape Monday and slapped an eight-game suspension on Italy ' s Mauro Tassotti for an elbow that broke a Spanish player ' s nose during a World Cup quarterfinal . FIFA ' s disciplinary committee said Tassotti ' s action against Luis Enrique in the closing moments of a 2-1 Italian victory Saturday was &quot; intentional serious violent conduct. &quot; The eight-game ban means Italy will be without two starters for Wednesday ' s semifinal against Bulgaria . Gianfranco Zola is completing a two-game suspension for a red card in a second-round victory over Nigeria . But Tassotti will sit for a while longer . He will be benched if Italy reaches the World Cup_final , plus at least Italy ' s first six games in preliminary rounds of the European Championship . In addition to the suspension , twice the longest previous ban imposed during the World Cup , Tassotti was fined $ 16 # 000 .</TEXT>
