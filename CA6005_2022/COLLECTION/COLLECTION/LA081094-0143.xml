   <HEADLINE> U.N. CONFIRMS HUTU KILLING IN REFUGEE CAMPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Defeated and bitter Rwandan army soldiers have begun killing some of_their_own people to stop them from returning home . And if that were not misery enough for the 900 # 000 refugees here , an outbreak of yet another killer disease has begun -- a mysterious fever that is suspected to be typhus . U.N. relief officials said Tuesday they have confirmed that a refugee was beaten to death at a nearby camp after urging his countrymen to return home to Rwanda . The killers were reported to be young_men wearing the uniform of the Hutu-majority Rwandan army , which lost_control of the country last month and is striving to maintain iron-handed rule over the Hutu refugees . &quot; A very nasty incident . . . the first confirmed murder that we can link to this campaign of intimidation , &quot; Ray Wilkinson , spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , said of the killing . The body of another refugee , who appeared to have been stoned to death , was found Monday ; the same motive is suspected . This new violence against the timid refugee population is certain to complicate efforts by relief agencies and the United Nations to coax Rwandans out of their disease-infested camps and back to their own land . In the incredibly bloody politics of Rwanda , Hutus are the largest ethnic_group . Until their flight , they made_up 80 % of the 8 million people in Rwanda . When they lost their short but brutal civil_war last month to an army controlled by Tutsis , fleeing Hutu soldiers and independent Hutu militias ordered all Hutu citizens to evacuate the country . Up to 4 million people , mostly Hutu , are now displaced at camps in Zaire , Tanzania , Burundi and in the southwest corner of Rwanda , where French troops are temporarily staffing a protective zone , largely for Hutus . The new Tutsi-dominated government of the Rwandan Patriotic Front has urged the refugees to come_home and has pledged to guarantee their safety . For weeks now , however , Hutu henchmen of the defeated government have told the refugees to stay_put , warning that the Tutsis will kill them . But at least in this sector of Zaire , the 100 # 000 or so refugees who went_home are starting to send_back word that they have not been harmed . The Hutu henchmen have apparently taken the next step and begun to demonstrate that refugees risk being killed for leaving the camps . U.N. officials say there is no evidence that the Rwandan Tutsis are harming returning Hutus but have stopped short of maing any firm promise of refugee safety . The tug of war over the refugees represents a continuing tragedy in a long struggle over the political future of Rwanda . An untold number of the Hutu soldiers and militiamen who maintain discipline in these refugee camps will never be able to return to Rwanda . that ' s because when they controlled the country , they led the slaughter of an estimated 500 # 000 Tutsis . So here they sit in Zaire -- many of the leaders are lodged_in hotels and houses while their people suffer in squalor . Keeping the Hutus in camps and under_control keeps the humanitarian crisis alive , and that holds the attention of the rest of the world , Hutu leaders say . They reason that perhaps the powerful nations of the West will finally sicken of the death and suffering and force the Tutsis to negotiate concessions . As for disease in the camps , health officials said they have confirmed 30 cases of the mysterious new fever ; 19 victims have died . The symptoms include an extremely high fever and red eyes . A laboratory analysis of the infection is now under way , but results are not expected for five days . Worried health officials suspect typhus . The disease is spread by lice and , they say , many of the refugees have lice . Meanwhile , in neighboring Burundi , strikes and clashes shut_down the capital , Bujumbura , for a second day Tuesday and authorities stepped_up security as diplomats feared the country would follow Rwanda down the path to conflict . At least 15 people have been killed in two days of clashes involving Tutsis protesting the arrest of their leader , the Reuters news_agency reported . It quoted aid officials as warning that their operations to assist refugees in southwest Rwanda and eastern Zaire may be affected unless the security situation improved . Trouble was sparked by the arrest of opposition politician Mathias Hitimana , leader of the Tutsi-led Party for the Reconciliation of the People .</TEXT>
