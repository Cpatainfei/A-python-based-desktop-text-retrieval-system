   <HEADLINE> LIVERMORE ' S HOPE FOR GIANT LASER IGNITES PROTESTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ideological and political battles over nuclear_weapon research were presumed as dead as the arms race , but bomb designers and arms control advocates are facing_off yet again over a massive weapon project at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory . The lab , east of San Francisco , wants to build a laser the size of a football_stadium . The multibillion-dollar machine would deliver a wallop of light energy powerful enough to trigger nuclear_fusion , generating temperatures five times higher than exist in the core of the sun . Livermore scientists say the laser , which would be among the biggest defense or energy projects of the next decade , is crucial for maintaining their proficiency in hydrogen_bomb physics in an era when the United States will be neither testing nor producing nuclear_weapons . And California politicians like it for an altogether different reason . With an initial price_tag of $ 1 billion and an operating budget of $ 4 billion over the life of the project , the laser promises to keep federal dollars flowing to Livermore and bolster the California economy . But opponents say the project , known as the National Ignition Facility , will undermine the current moratorium on nuclear_weapon tests , amounting to a form of surrogate testing that no other nation has the technical capability to equal . They also criticize it as a pork-barrel project that will further pollute the environment around Livermore . &quot; It ' s large . It ' s controversial , &quot; admits Victor Reese , assistant secretary_of_energy for nuclear_weapons . The decision on whether to build the laser will be crucial in determining the size and scope of the U.S. nuclear_weapon complex , which is undergoing a piecemeal consolidation in the aftermath of the Cold_War . And the heated debate over the project mirrors a broad uncertainty over what should be done to maintain the nation ' s nuclear capability . The two camps are maneuvering furiously as Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary weighs whether to go_ahead with the project . Approval of the laser was delayed this summer after two key California congressmen -- House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ronald V . Dellums ( D-Oakland ) and Rep . Pete Stark ( D-Hayward ) -- broke_with their California colleagues and withdrew their support . For the nuclear_weapon fraternity , the stakes could hardly be higher . Many defense officials and scientists worry that the United States is allowing its nuclear capabilities to erode too quickly , and the laser would be a major engineering tool that could help reverse that trend and keep dozens of bomb designers busy for the next decade . Proponents say that it is vital to maintaining the safety and reliability of the existing U.S. nuclear_weapon stockpile even if another bomb is never built . Further , the laser could help save Livermore itself as a center for nuclear_weapon research . As the Energy_Department copes_with budget cutbacks , one option under_consideration is consolidating all weapon work_at one lab -- probably Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico . Currently , both Livermore and Los Alamos conduct research on the nuclear packages for bombs , but Livermore is considered more vulnerable if a decision is made to have just one lab . The Energy_Department could decide to build the laser in another state if it chooses to end nuclear_weapon work_at Livermore . Livermore claims world leadership in the area of high energy lasers . And without the National Ignition Facility , Livermore scientists say their unparalleled expertise in hydrogen_bomb fusion will atrophy . While acknowledging that the primary justification for the new laser is nuclear_weapon work , Mike Campbell , Livermore ' s chief for laser programs , says it would also be used for research on fusion as a source of electrical_energy and in astrophysics . &quot; This allows us to keep smart people engaged in relevant physics , &quot; Campbell said . &quot; Some people are opposed to that. &quot; Campbell contends that large machinery like the new laser is necessary for the United States to continue its leadership in the discipline , since Europe and Japan also have fusion programs . &quot; It is an important area to be pursuing , &quot; agreed Sidney Drell , an influential physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator . Drell recently completed a study of high energy physics for Energy_Secretary O ' Leary . &quot; It is good physics , and it is very good people doing it. &quot; But opponents of the laser -- ranging from influential Washington arms-control lobbyists to local environmentalists -- regard it as a misguided effort that will be a waste_of_money and a polluting , destabilizing continuation of the arms race . Arms control advocates say the facility will allow the United States to comply with the letter but not the spirit of efforts to end all nuclear testing . &quot; The idea ( of the Livermore scientists ) is to maintain the same range of nuclear_weapons design skills that we had during the Cold_War , &quot; said Christopher Payne , a critic at the National Resources Defense Council , a Washington environmental group . &quot; They don ' t get_it . The Cold_War is over . We are negotiating a test ban so we don ' t have to do this anymore. &quot; The United States has agreed to a moratorium on all nuclear_weapon tests , and efforts are under way to negotiate a comprehensive ban by next year , when an earlier treaty expires . The rationale underlying a test moratorium is to prevent proliferation of nuclear_weapons and promote nuclear disengagement by established powers . In addition to the laser , the United States is considering whether to conduct underground tests that produce very small explosions , equivalent_to less than 100 pounds of TNT . The tests , known as hydro-nuclear tests , are considered important for bomb safety , particularly resistance to accidental detonation . But both the laser and the hydro-nuclear tests have prompted concern that other nations will perceive that America is using its superior technology and financial capability to conduct a full range of experiments that simulate a nuclear detonation -- even though a fully assembled bomb is not tested . Environmentalists have another set of concerns . A study by Livermore itself disclosed that wines produced from local grapes have three times the level of tritium -- a radioactive form of hydrogen -- as wines from Napa Valley , said Marylia Kelly , president of Tri-Valley Cares , an environmental group . Livermore officials don ' t dispute that some tritium has escaped over the years and found its way into the environment , but they contend that the wine with elevated tritium meets all federal safety standards for drinking_water by a huge margin and that a single airplane trip can expose passengers to a greater radiation dose . Moreover , the new laser will have better shielding and environmental safeguards than other high-power lasers at the one-square-mile Livermore lab . In addition , Livermore has significantly reduced the amount of tritium stored at the site . But laser opponents have managed to at least stall a decision . After lobbying by arms-control and environmental advocates , Rep . Dellums tempered his support of the National Ignition Facility , asserting in a letter to O ' Leary that the issues require far greater research before launching into the next phase of the program . Rep . Stark also withdrew his support , saying the laser will be too expensive and will send the wrong message about nuclear_weapons to the rest of the world . As a result of the congressional concerns , O ' Leary instructed subordinates in July to answer a lengthy set of questions about the uses of the laser and its implications for proliferation . Defense proponents dispute the idea that efforts to keep the U.S. nuclear stockpile safe and reliable contribute to proliferation . &quot; People who want to have their own nuclear capability will find excuses , &quot; said former Defense_Secretary Harold Brown . &quot; If it isn ' t this one , it will be another one. &quot; Although the Pentagon is reviewing its nuclear_weapon strategy , there is no doubt that the weapons will have a significant role in the future U.S. defense posture . Experts estimate that America will retain about 6 # 000 nuclear bombs over the long term . Without major new investments in instruments and computers , Livermore scientists say they will not be able to guarantee the safety and reliability of those bombs . But critics , such_as Spurgeon Keeny , president of the Arms Control Assn. , say the laser is a &quot; Rolls-Royce &quot; approach to the problem . The laser would have 192 individual beams , amplified by glass lenses in a labyrinth of tubes , aimed into a spherical test chamber made of four-inch-thick aluminum . At the center of all_the beams , scientists would mount a tiny target of super-cold deuterium and tritium , heavy forms of hydrogen . Just four 10-millionths of a pound of fuel is used . The laser_beam ignites the fuel indirectly by focusing the beams inside a small gold chamber , called a hohlraum . The hohlraum instantly vaporizes , barraging the fuel with X-rays . The temperature rises to 50 million degrees , and a sustained fusion of atoms occurs that can raise the temperature up_to 400 million degrees . The laser would represent a second approach to controlled fusion , the other being magnetic confinement inside machines called tokamaks . Magnetic fusion has been more lavishly funded , but there is little agreement that it represents the only solution . The National Ignition Facility would not really confine the fusion . Ignition would occur instantly before the target mass could fly apart and for that reason , the technology is known as inertial confinement fusion . Unlike past generations of lasers , the fusion in the new laser is intended to produce more energy than it consumes . Campbell said he is confident but not absolutely certain that the laser will meet that objective . With 1.8 megajoules of power , a measurement of energy used by physicists , it will have a significant margin over the 1 megajoule that Campbell believes is sufficient for ignition . But scientists at Livermore have been wrong before . The Nova laser at Livermore was expected to achieve ignition when it began operation in the 1980s , but it proved to be underpowered . Moreover , how the laser would actually help ensure the safety and reliability of hydrogen_bombs is disputed . In a thermonuclear_warhead , a plutonium sphere is imploded to create a fission reaction , which in turn produces high_temperatures and large amounts of X-rays . Those X-rays are reflected by an interior shroud to a second sphere that contains the fusion fuel , producing a much larger explosion . The design is similar to the hohlraum that would be used in the Livermore laser . Assistant Energy_Secretary Reese said the laser would be used to refine top secret computational codes used to design and predict the yield of nuclear_weapons . &quot; It ' s a scientific tool that allows you to understand the physics of fusion . . . and really to understand what happens at very high energy and energy density , which allows you to work_on the codes , &quot; Reese said . But critics , such_as Payne , say the laser is little more_than an expensive toy for physicists . &quot; I don ' t think we will forget how to make nuclear_weapons in the next 100 years , &quot; Payne said . &quot; It only took us three years to make them the first time. &quot; Meanwhile , as California politicians such_as Dellums waffle over their support for the laser , officials from Nevada and New Mexico have launched efforts to get the program for their states . The political moves have left Livermore officials clearly worried , not only that they would lose the laser but also that they would lose the lab ' s role in bomb research itself . &quot; The National Ignition Facility , &quot; said one scientist , &quot; is crucial to Livermore. &quot;</TEXT>
