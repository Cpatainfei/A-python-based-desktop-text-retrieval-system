   <HEADLINE> IN SEARCH OF MR . KATO ; A QUEST FOR THE CREATOR OF A MYSTERIOUS JAPANESE GARDEN CONJURES UP A FACELESS GHOST , MODERN PREJUDICES AND A WILLFUL HEIRESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thus shall ye think_of all this fleeting world ; A star at dawn , a bubble in a stream , A flash of lightning in a summer cloud ; A flickering lamp , a phantom , and a dream . -- FROM THE DELUSIONS OF APPEARANCES , THE DIAMOND SUTRA It was hidden beneath a layer of muck on the bottom of the small retaining pond by the back fence , scratched faintly into the concrete and visible only because I had drained off the putrid water and shoveled out the rotting sycamore leaves . &quot; KATO &quot; was written in childish block_letters beneath a barely legible date , &quot; 1916 , &quot; and above the initials &quot; THG &quot; and &quot; EGO. &quot; They had said it would be there , the former property_owners . This was where a man known only by his surname , Kato , had etched his signature after meditating on the landscape for three months and then building the ponds , the bridges , the stream bed and the waterfalls for what was said to be the oldest privately owned Japanese garden in Southern California . My wife and I had acquired the property on an impulse , instantly seduced by the overgrown and unkempt garden behind the modest bungalow . From the living room you look past a screen of spindly bamboo and the trunks of redwood and cypress_trees , to a pond banked by myrtle and azalea shrubs , and beyond that to the old azumaya , an open-air tea shelter , shaded by a huge live_oak . From the tea shelter , you can see the four stone-encrusted ponds spanned by little concrete bridges , one of them designed in a zigzag pattern to evade demons in hot pursuit . To the north , a snow lantern stands on an island in the main pond , next to a large rock jutting_out of the water in a shape suggesting a tortoise , auspicious for its longevity . This pond and its waterfall are guarded by sculptured pine_trees and flanked by a hillock studded with irises and sago_palms . A curtain of yew trees backs this tiny universe , and above their tops the San Gabriels serve as borrowed scenery , framing the upper_limits of the garden . At first glance , the landscape was moody , contemplative , confusing -- and familiar . My wife , Susan , and I had lived many years in Japan , and had undergone a subliminal indoctrination to the Japanese ethos , a mind-softening process cynical gaijin call &quot; tofu-nization. &quot; Maybe we were quivering cakes of bean_curd , vulnerable to the sorcery of this garden . And so we ended_up owning an incredible yard with a small house attached . The Japan thing , though , does not explain it all . I was recovering from a brain_tumor that was about a year or so in_remission . I felt robust , confident that my health had been restored , but I was also aware of how fragile , and brief , life can be . I suppose I was looking_for hidden meaning , and this garden struck me as a cosmic window -- if only I could learn how to see_through it . I had more mundane motives as well , because our first encounter with Kato ' s garden came two months after the Los Angeles riots . Before we went house-hunting I had agonized over persevering in the city or retreating to the suburbs . During the riots a flying ember had set fire to the roof of our apartment_building . We were_on a delayed honeymoon in Italy , taking the obligatory gondola ride in Venice at about the moment quick-thinking neighbors dowsed the flames with garden_hoses , leaving no more damage than a soggy bedroom . Discomfort with the neighborhood was nothing new , however . Earlier that year I had awoken at 3 a.m. to a blood-curdling scream , squinted out my bedroom window to see a man holding a pistol to my neighbor ' s head and , for the first time , dialed that metaphor for American urban life , 911 . On the evening we went_to check_out a report of a private Japanese garden in Sierra Madre , I was brooding about the bid we had placed that morning on a large Craftsman house in Hollywood , a half-block from a strip on Sunset Boulevard notorious for its prostitutes . I was receptive to buying some quiet and peace -- or at least forestalling L.A. ' s creeping nightmare . This seemed liked a place where I could enjoy a little instant rapture and perhaps meditate on some of the ambivalent feelings I had about my 10 years studying and working as a befuddled foreigner in Japan . The irony , of course , was that once we settled in , we found it difficult to sit_down and relax without seeing another onerous chore begging to be done : pruning , raking , weeding , digging , replanting . Dead trees had to be removed , the ponds needed to be drained and cleaned . My primordial dread of yardwork , acquired long ago in suburban Chicago , reawakened . We sought bids from two prominent Japanese landscape_architects ; each said he could restore the garden for about $ 1 # 000 a day . We had no choice but to go it alone with the help of a mortal , two-hour-a-week gardener . Still , I felt a compulsion to find_out what Kato ' s intentions were . Did he leave_behind any plans showing how his 7700-square-foot legacy was supposed to look ? I wanted to know what Kato was saying to me through this botanical relic , through generations of decayed and replanted vegetation . His spirit was present in the haggard pines ; it was reflected in the murky ponds , where goldfish flitted about and coquettish pink blossoms yawned atop lily_pads . The integrity of this voice -- if it was his -- had survived more_than three-quarters of a century . Kato , whoever he was , haunted the place . Is it pure coincidence that our daughter ' s dependable nanny insists she has twice seen a male ghost in the garden ? Dressed in black , he appeared suddenly during daylight and then vanished . I asked the nanny what kind of features the ghost had , assuming it must be an Asian apparition . The man had no face , she said , but he seemed to &quot; belong &quot; to the garden . Unlocking the secrets of Kato ' s garden became an obsession , but I also wanted to know more about what I was doing here in this lush little oasis on the outskirts of a city in distress , taking refuge in an illusion of time and space . What meaning was I projecting onto Kato and his microcosm as I sat_by the tea shelter and drank my coffee in the morning haze , observing the garden dumbly through a drowsy trance ? Sierra Madre , with its goofy July 4th parade and its volunteer fire_department , has a placid tree-lined ambience that reeks of Midwestern , white-bread values . Populated by 10 # 800 souls -- or 9 # 360 , depending_on the welcome sign -- it seems like a town you could not invent if you tried . But the truth is , it was invented with calculated artifice , as was nearly all_of Southern California . In 1881 , an ambitious real_estate huckster from Massachusetts named Nathaniel C . Carter bought 1100 acres on the incline rising to a mountain_range called , at the time , the Sierra Madre . He laid_out a plan for a utopian community , much in_vogue at the time , this one for gentlemen citrus ranchers . To sell the dream , Carter went_back east and returned with trainloads of tourists and prospective buyers . The Sierra Madre tract , significant because it was the site of the trail head for the burro-ride ascent to the Mt . Wilson summit , acquired a reputation as a retreat from the urban afflictions even then plaguing Los Angeles and Pasadena . By the turn_of_the_century , riding_on a speculative land boom , Sierra Madre was_well established as a prosperous town with its own water_system , post_office , amateur drama society , sanitarium and cigar factory . The date of Kato ' s arrival in Sierra Madre , much less California , remains unknown . But the debut of his patron , a wealthy Southern heiress named Thomasella Hardeman Graham -- the &quot; THG &quot; in the pond-bottom glyph -- is_well established . The strong-willed daughter of a plantation_owner and cotton miller who built the town of Pinewood , Tenn. , Graham started traveling with a chaperon in her teens , making grand_tours of Europe , Asia and the American West , and did not stop until she landed in Sierra Madre in 1908 , at the age of 38 . Graham knew of Sierra Madre because of Frank Sauerwein , a consumptive painter of Native_American and Western scenes , whom she discovered in the late 1890s at a hotel art_gallery outside the Grand_Canyon . She admired the young artist so_much she took him along on one of her European trips and gave him a gift of $ 4 # 000 -- a staggering sum in those days -- to study in Italy . Sauerwein , in turn , invited Graham to stay_at his cottage in Sierra Madre , which he rarely used . When Sauerwein died of tuberculosis in Connecticut in 1910 , he bequeathed the shack to Graham . The patch of ground around it , shaded by a large pepper_tree , became the nucleus for Thomasella Graham ' s Italian-Japanese-Californian fantasy . Graham , who had once dreamed of buying a villa in Italy , decided instead to construct her own Italianate manor that , in those unimaginably smog-free days , afforded a Tuscan view of vineyards and orchards sweeping all_the way to the Pacific_Ocean . To build her palazzo , she hired architect Robert D . Farquhar ( he would later design the California Club building Downtown and UCLA ' s Clark Memorial Library ) . As villas go , the Graham house is_on the small side , with three second-floor bedrooms , a downstairs maid ' s room , English_oak paneling in the dining_room and terrazzo floors in the butler ' s pantry and kitchen . Last inhabited in 1991 , the building still stands , but is now behind a chain-link fence warning trespassers that the structure has been condemned because of earthquake damage . Graham expressed her grandiose visions of culture by naming her 5.5-acre property &quot; Italia Mia , &quot; incorrectly entered in county land records as &quot; Mia Italia , &quot; the story goes , because a craftsman inverted the words on the wrought-iron fence that still encircles the old estate . I have found it tempting to imagine that Graham , mourning Sauerwein ' s death , built the Japanese garden as a Bohemian memorial . And others have speculated about Graham ' s feelings for Sauerwein . &quot; Thomasella never married , &quot; wrote local historical society stalwart Phyllis Chapman in an August , 1982 , article in the Sierra Madre News . &quot; Was it because her feelings for Sauerwein were of the heart , too , and no one else filled that void after his death ? &quot; Placed below the Italian villa , a majestic alley of Irish yew trees , a conventional flower_garden and a marble fountain imported from Florence , a Japanese garden is at_odds with everything else on the Graham estate . Whatever its inspiration , Kato ' s garden cries_out_for explanation . * Graham was far from alone in her Oriental fascination . By the early part of the century , a Japanese garden had become a sign of sophistication for the social elite , following the rage for Japanese art that swept Europe in the late 1800s . In Southern California , rail baron Henry E . Huntington created what he called an &quot; Oriental garden &quot; around a large pond on his San Marino estate , after acquiring the necessary plants , gates , lanterns and other accouterments from a financially distressed tea_garden in Pasadena in 1912 . As it turns_out , the garden -- which sprawls uncharacteristically -- is not really a Japanese garden at all , but a studied improvisation by Huntington ' s gardener , William Hertrich . Also in this faddish cross-Pacific cultural firmament , G . W . Wattles built a Japanese garden on his Hollywood estate that is now open_to the public as Wattles Gardens Park , and the antique-dealing Bernheimer brothers reassembled a 17th-Century Japanese temple villa in the Hollywood Hills as the tourist attraction &quot; Yamashiro , &quot; which is now a restaurant . Since the name Kato ( pronounced KAH-toe and common in Japan ) is not connected to Huntington ' s garden , I was hoping he had a hand in the tea_garden that Huntington had stripped . But Kato ' s services were not needed there , either . That garden , built around 1903 , was the work of a curio dealer named George Turner Marsh , who had designed the Japanese garden at the 1884 California Midwinter Exposition in San Francisco . It survives as Golden Gate Park ' s famous tea_garden , a continuing tourist attraction , where the fantasy of Japanese landscaping made one of its earliest marks on American pop culture . The other seminal event in the introduction of Japanese landscaping in California was the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition at San Francisco ' s Presidio Park , where an ambitious three-acre &quot; Imperial Japanese Garden &quot; was laid_out by H . Izawa and a crew of temple architects and professional gardeners from Japan . This seemed a perfect place to find Kato , but here , too , he goes unmentioned in the guidebooks and pamphlets . If the Pan-Pacific Expo did not bring Kato to America , it seems plausible that it served as inspiration for Graham . Although there ' s no record of her actually visiting San Francisco at the time , her cosmopolitan interests would have likely drawn her there . The history gained importance as my wife and I struggled to restore the garden and wondered if we were making the right decisions . We argued about whether the sago_palms , characteristic of some Edo-style gardens , belonged on the_hill , or in the garden at all . It became essential to get a better idea of what it might have looked_like 70 years ago . After six months of searching , I found a Sierra Madre resident who had seen it in its prime . She was Yoneko Hashimoto , the 75-year-old daughter of Yukataro Aisawa , who built the garden ' s rustic azumaya tea shelter and served as Italia Mia ' s groundskeeper for many years . The Aisawa family lived_on the estate from about 1922 to 1930 , while Hashimoto attended elementary_school . &quot; Miss Graham , &quot; she says , was an authority on horticultural matters and taught her father his gardening skills , including the Japanese techniques of which he had no prior experience . Aisawa continued to work as a gardener in Sierra Madre until he was detained on suspicion of espionage , shortly after Japan ' s attack on Pearl_Harbor . Federal authorities arrested the gardener because of his activity in Sierra Madre ' s Japanese Assn. , which operated a Saturday language_school and community_center serving the 20 or so families of Japanese ancestry . Like other Japanese community leaders throughout the Western United States , Aisawa was eventually cleared of suspicion and reunited with his family behind barbed_wire in an internment_camp . As a little_girl in the 1920s , Hashimoto romped on the lawns of the Graham estate and played with her younger sister in the garden , &quot; which looked a lot different then. &quot; It was more lush , she says , filled_in with the bamboo-like nandina . A huge tree on the northeast corner of the garden ( she cannot remember what kind ) muted the harsh sunlight that was scorching the zoysia grass on a recent Sunday afternoon . The only evidence of that tree is the remnant of a steel cable that was used to anchor the trunk as it deteriorated , one small puzzle solved in the archeology of Kato ' s garden . Hashimoto never met Kato . Considering the tightknit nature of the town ' s Japanese community , this suggests he probably was not around when she was old enough to remember . She does recall hearing Graham talk_about him , however , conversations that left an impression that Graham brought Kato over directly from Japan , which was encouraging news . If Kato had been brought over temporarily , it would explain why his name had eluded public mention . Yet Hashimoto ' s reminiscences also raised questions about Kato ' s very existence . As a child she played almost exclusively in the garden ' s shallow retaining pond , because her father forbade her from approaching the larger main ponds and bridges . But she has no memory of the &quot; KATO &quot; inscription on the bottom of the pond . She first learned of it in the 1960s , after Graham had died , the estate had been subdivided , and our bungalow had been built . Could it have been scratched into the cement after the war , fabricated to bolster the garden ' s legitimacy ? What if Graham , a horticulturist in her own_right , invented him for prestige purposes after designing the garden herself , using as her guide the various texts and publications on Japanese landscaping available at the time ? A gardener named Kato does not appear in the old directories kept by Southern California ' s early Japanese community . He does not surface in the city directories for Pasadena and Sierra Madre . Local historical society documents describe Kato as having been_on the &quot; staff of the Imperial Gardens &quot; in Toyko , a claim impossible to trace . The archivist at the Japanese American National Museum couldn ' t offer any clues about the gardener . Then , one morning I thought I had a breakthrough in my quest_for Kato as I was perusing the ledger of acquisitions kept by the historical archive at the Arboretum of Los Angeles County . Item A-69-326-535 jumped_off the page : &quot; One set blueprints Italia Mia garden plans. &quot; Gertrude Bailey , a longtime employee of Graham , had donated them to the collection in 1969 , along with Graham ' s wicker_baskets , sock darner , mouse trap and a Japanese tooth_powder box . But the red_line drawn across the entry for the garden blueprints , curator Sandy Snider explained , meant they were &quot; missing from the inventory. &quot; I was free to look anyway , she said . My frantic search through acid-free preservation boxes and dusty old trunks turned_up nothing . I was already harboring suspicions that Kato was apocryphal when I had a long conversation with Kendall Brown , a lecturer in fine_arts at USC , who is compiling research for a book on the history of Japanese-style gardens in California . Brown pointed to the book &quot; Landscape Gardening in Japan &quot; by Josiah Conder , first published in 1893 and popular among horticulturists in Graham ' s day . All the characteristics of an Edo-period tsukiyama - sansui ( hill and water ) garden , the variety built_on the estate , can be found among the book ' s detailed sketches . Brown thinks non-Japanese landscapers like George Marsh and Huntington ' s gardener , William Hertrich , relied heavily on the book as a reference . Indeed , Graham and Hertrich were said to be friends who swapped information on plants and collaborated in experimenting with cuttings such_as Cycas_revoluta ( sago_palms ) , of which four mature specimens survive in the garden . If Hertrich and Graham were in close contact , she could have gleaned from him lessons in the craft of Japanese garden design , using miscellaneous props and unskilled labor . &quot; Maybe Kato was simply a hired hand , &quot; suggested Brown as he looked_out_on the garden from the tea shelter . &quot; Maybe Tommy Graham wanted a Japanese garden because Henry Huntington had one . It was the fashion . This was an era when women dressed_up in kimonos . I would n ' t be surprised if she had a copy of Josiah Conder ' s book and told some hired hand , ' This is what I want. ' &quot; * We may never know whether Thomasella Graham was the sole auteur of the garden , but she dominates its story . A refugee from the social strictures of the Deep_South , Graham came_to California , as so many did , to establish her independence . In Sierra Madre , Graham is remembered as a tough woman who fought tenaciously to preserve the community ' s trees when she served on the city_Planning Commission . Perhaps it is her masculine spirit that haunts Kato ' s garden . She never married ; her close companions were always women . In the early years it was her chaperon from Tennessee , Ida Munsell , whom Yoneko Hashimoto recalls as a school marm who befriended her with great tenderness during the years she lived at Italia Mia . Later in life , after selling the Italia Mia estate and moving_into one of the smaller houses down the street she owned as rental property , Graham was inseparable from Florence Pride . They had an evening ritual of sitting_out on their porch and having two whiskey_sours each , administered punctually by a trusted male friend who kept the booze out of their reach until the appointed hour , according to their neighbors Pat and Pauline O ' Neill , now in their 80s , who occasionally joined them for drinks . The pair also made a habit of playing with their Ouija_board . One of the O ' Neills ' most cherished possessions is an antique photograph depicting Graham at age 16 with Munsell , sitting in a gondola in a Venetian canal . The photograph was passed_on to her by Gertrude Bailey , Graham ' s longtime employee and final companion , who died last year at the age of 94 . Lesbianism was not a subject discussed openly in that era , so Graham ' s private life remains uncertain . But it is clear that she had little interest in men . Harry Graham Schneider , her grand nephew who heads her only line of surviving relatives , inherited her collection of Sauerwein paintings and letters , but doubts the artist was ever her lover . &quot; To put it bluntly , she didn ' t need men . She was independent as hell , &quot; says Schneider , a bank chairman in Lake Providence , La . &quot; My aunt was one of those flag-raising feminists. &quot; Schneider visited Sierra Madre on several extended trips , the last of which was in 1947 , when Graham was about to sell Italia Mia for the surprisingly modest sum of $ 30 # 000 . She apparently had made some bad investments during the war ; Schneider suspects she was cheated by her lawyer as well . &quot; She couldn ' t afford to take_care of it . She would have died a pauper , &quot; he says . &quot; She hated to give it up , not just the house , but the yard . That Japanese garden was her pride and joy . She used to work all_the time in the garden . She had a full-time gardener , but she was always out there in her hat and gloves , kneeling and working in the dirt. &quot; Thomasella Graham , the rebellious Southern daughter , died in 1957 at 87 years of_age . According to her wishes , her remains were sent_back to Pinewood , Tenn. , for burial next to her parents ' graves . Just as Graham ' s legacy was looming very large and hope of establishing Kato ' s existence was deteriorating , I got a call from a friend at a local real_estate office , who stunned me with a tale of Kato ' s being at yet another historical Sierra Madre estate . On the property was a mansion and the remnants of a Japanese garden built_in 1917 , the year after Kato would have finished his work_at Italia Mia . The original owner was a J . Gamble Carson , who disappeared in the early 1920s , shortly after being accused of murdering his wife . Nolie Howard , the current owner , said her parents bought the property in 1947 . The seller had told them that &quot; a Mr. Kato &quot; from Japan had meditated on the terrain for one month before laying_out an exquisite three-tiered Japanese hill-and-water garden , with streams , waterfalls , bridges and ponds . All that survives is a pathetic shell of the middle tier . There is an empty pond ( no signature on the bottom ) , a concrete lantern and bridge , flanked by a chaotic overgrown hillside . A metal railing , installed to help Howard ' s elderly mother negotiate what is left of a zigzagging stroll path , scars the_hill . After the estate was subdivided , &quot; a tenant with a big dog &quot; let the garden go_to waste , according to Howard . Only a_few original trees , including a conspicuous sago_palm , remain . Still , the asymmetrical balance of the rocks , the lumpy stonework in the bridge and the concrete toro lanterns reveal a stunning resemblance to the Italia Mia garden . If this was not Kato ' s doing , it seemed highly probable that the two gardens were made by the same person or crafted from the same designs . If Kato had stayed_on in Sierra Madre to build this garden after finishing the one for Graham , the Sierra Madre News , a gossipy community weekly still in_operation , would have probably noted his presence in town . But Howard found no reference_to Kato when she scanned the microfilm of old editions . I had no luck either . What I did find was a note saying that all editions between October , 1915 , and September , 1916 , a critical period for the Kato garden at Italia Mia , were missing . Remnants of early Japanese landscaping are not unusual in Southern California . &quot; I think there are more ( old Japanese gardens ) out there than we realize , &quot; says Bruce Coats , an authority on Japanese gardens who teaches art history at Scripps College . &quot; The old estates have been subdivided and people have parts of these gardens in their back yards and don ' t really know anything about them. &quot; Sierra Madre has at least one other relic of a Japanese garden , this one hidden behind the elementary_school , Sierra Madre School . The issei fathers of the two_dozen Japanese-American children who attended the school in the 1920s built a small garden there as a gesture of good_will to celebrate the completion of a new building in 1930 . It had a tiny fish pond , a miniature bridge , a bonsai pine_tree and a stone lantern . But amid the anti-Japanese passions of the war , schoolchildren vandalized the garden . All that remains are a_few stones buried in the dirt , an overgrown pine , a skinny sago and the bridge , signed by cement man Roy Kaya , March 1931 . Helen Obazawa , now 74 , was one of the Japanese children attending the school . She has vivid memories of visiting Italia Mia ' s Japanese garden , when the school staged &quot; tea_party &quot; field trips during a unit on Japan in social studies . The children played there in a rikusha they built , she recalls , and practiced bowing upon entering the tea shelter . &quot; Miss Graham liked parties. &quot; Graham ' s idea of having the Aisawa family live_on her estate during the 1920s has parallels with other Japanese gardens of distinction . Huntington had gardener Chiyozo Goto and his family live_in the small Japanese house he obtained from Marsh ' s Pasadena tea_garden , from where he also hired Goto . Makoto Hagiwara , an entrepreneur who had the teahouse concession at Golden Gate Park , lived there with his family . The presence of Japanese gave these gardens a diorama effect , which no doubt amused visitors . In San Antonio , Tex. , Kimi Jingu and his family lived_in the stone teahouse on the grounds of a Japanese garden the city built_on the site of an old quarry in 1917 . A park_commissioner wanted a more &quot; authentic atmosphere. &quot; But after Pearl_Harbor , the city turned_off the water and evicted Jingu ' s widow , Alice , and her five children , who had no other means of subsistence . They were replaced with a Chinese couple , and the city renamed the park the &quot; Chinese Tea Garden. &quot; The family eventually found their way to Los Angeles , where Alice Jingu became a successful actress -- her credits include the film &quot; Teahouse of the August Moon. &quot; The entertainment value placed on Japanese culture is reflected in some of the old photographs of the Italia Mia Japanese garden . They depict kimono-clad Japanese men and women in what appears to be a scene from a movie . A 1931 Sierra Madre News_article mentions the use of the garden by an unnamed Hollywood film company as a set for a &quot; Japanese story , &quot; but these photos are puzzling , undated and without captions . They were in a photo album we acquired with the property , given originally to a former owner by the local historical society along with an unsigned and garbled essay on the history of Japan and the supposed symbolism of the Kato garden . * Kendall Brown , the USC scholar , says all gardens -- especially Japanese gardens -- are &quot; rhetorical statements. &quot; Gardens cannot be separated from their political and social context , he insists , and that is why the Japanese government helped build them at expositions in the United States , when it was testing its fledgling diplomatic skills after 2 1 / 2 centuries of feudal isolation . That is why the Jingus were evicted in San Antonio and the little garden at Sierra Madre School was trashed by children whose Japanese playmates had been sent_away to internment_camps . And that is why Graham hired Kato , or invented him , to enshrine her liberated life in California . Yet to say a Japanese garden is merely a political metaphor that can be interpreted , a physical asset copied_out of a book , owned , bought and sold or appraised by a bank , misses the whole point . The humbling lesson to be learned in the search for Kato is that my wife and I are mere custodians of this garden , never mind what the deed says . A nagging riddle , found in the Kato etchings at the bottom of the small retaining pond , goes directly to the question of ownership . Someone wrote &quot; 1916 , KATO , THG , &quot; all_of which is easy enough to decipher , but what about the letters on the lower right : &quot; EGO &quot; ? This has been interpreted to mean &quot; Edo , &quot; as in the old name for Tokyo , seat of the Tokugawa shogunate , and a reference_to the Edo style of garden design . But I have looked_at those markings over and over again , and they definitely say &quot; EGO , &quot; matching the initials of no one I have found remotely connected to the garden . Was it a co-worker ? Was Kato ' s English so poor that he misspelled Edo ? Or was he familiar_with Freudian theory and , fresh from the experience of toiling for the indomitably proud Thomasella Graham , scratched in the word &quot; EGO &quot; by her initials as a cryptic Zen message to future generations ? After all , Kato ' s training would have been in Japan , where the discipline of landscape_architecture is inseparable from the tradition of Buddhism . Perhaps this is the key to understanding the ultimate meaning of Kato ' s garden , that the notion of self is an illusion in this transitory world , where gardens decay and are rejuvenated , cities rise and burn , property_owners come and go , and venerable gardeners appear , and then vanish .</TEXT>
