   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY_COLLEGE DISTRICT DEBATES RECRUITING OF MORE FOREIGN STUDENTS ; ENROLLMENT : SOME BOARD_MEMBERS CALL THOSE FROM ABROAD A REVENUE SOURCE . BUT CRITICS SAY HIGH FEES CAN CREATE UNDUE HARDSHIPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beset by financial shortfalls and dwindling enrollment , Ventura County Community_College District leaders are debating whether to recruit more foreign students who pay hefty tuition and other surcharges . Foreign students provide a cash windfall for the college district because their education is not subsidized by taxpayers and they pay a minimum of $ 3 # 120 in tuition and fees a year . Even with recent fee hikes , a full-time student from California pays $ 312 annually . Last fall , Moorpark , Oxnard and Ventura colleges , with a total enrollment of 26 # 588 , collectively enrolled 239 foreign students without a district-coordinated recruitment effort . The five trustees of the college district have widely varying views on how foreign student recruitment should be handled . At one end of the spectrum , Gregory P . Cole would rather the district ignore the whole issue and concentrate_on the instruction of American students . &quot; There ' s something inherently wrong with trying to attract foreign nationals , &quot; said Cole , who has also announced plans to run_for the Thousand Oaks City_Council . &quot; We have enough problems trying to educate our own American students. &quot; On the other end , Pete Tafoya argues that board_members should decrease the surcharges on foreign students to make Ventura County colleges more attractive . Tafoya also recently requested a district study on the possible benefits of recruiting more foreign students . &quot; I ' m asking_for a change in paradigm , to use these students as a revenue source , &quot; he said . &quot; We can take a more positive role in this , or we can continue to treat them like someone we don ' t want. &quot; College board President Allan Jacobs said that after considering the_matter , he has come_to agree with Tafoya ' s position . Trustees Karen Boone and Timothy Hirschberg concur that recruiting foreign students may be a good idea for the cash-strapped district , but they see no reason to lower their fees , or even to refrain_from raising them . &quot; I don ' t want our local taxpayers to subsidize the education of foreign students , &quot; Hirschberg said . &quot; With the squeeze hitting our public institutions today , we need to be responsible to our local taxpayers. &quot; Last year , foreign students paid $ 110 per unit , the $ 13 per unit charged by the state on all students , plus a newly added foreign student surcharge of $ 5 per unit . Earlier this month , district trustees voted 3 to 2 to increase that surcharge by $ 2 per unit , with the added money going toward a district construction fund . Tafoya and Jacobs voted against the $ 2 surcharge . For their part , some foreign students are bitter about the escalating fees . &quot; I came_to the States because I was just curious of seeing the land of milk and honey , &quot; said Opiyo Odhiambo , 27 , an Oxnard College_student from Nairobi , Kenya . &quot; But here they are milking the bits of money I have by raising the fees every semester. &quot; Odhiambo , who is living with family friends near the college , said he is just scraping_by with a 7 1 / 2-hour-per-week , $ 5-per-hour job at the campus library , and can barely afford the surcharges levied by the board . Some college staff who work directly with foreign students are also irritated by the board ' s penchant for increasing foreign students ' fees while simultaneously making little effort to accommodate them . These staff_members say that whatever push for change that exists at the district level is in part the result of_their_own constant harping on the needs and struggles of the colleges ' foreign populations . &quot; One thing that seems really wrong with this system is we make these foreign students jump through hoops , &quot; said Judy Arnold , an adviser to Moorpark College ' s foreign students for about five years . &quot; We need to encourage them , to broaden their program , but we don ' t need to constantly increase their fees. &quot; Foreign student advisers say such students not only get an education at local colleges , but also immeasurably add_to the education of their American classmates . &quot; I find they really enrich campus life and help our students learn about other cultures , &quot; said Pat Preston , the foreign student administrative officer at Santa Monica College . Out of a student body of 26 # 000 , Santa Monica College has 2 # 300 foreign students , Preston said . The students bring_about $ 8.5 million to the college every year that helps fund extra classes and myriad programs the cash-strapped college could otherwise not afford , officials say . As a result , college officials fly all_over the world recruiting foreign students , attending English_language schools and study abroad fairs , pitching the attractions of their California campus . Tafoya and college staff hold_up Santa Monica as a college that has benefited from foreign student recruitment . &quot; The Santa Monica Community_College District uses foreign students as a revenue source , &quot; Tafoya said . &quot; Right now , we ' re not marketing for foreign students . Every time you increase fees , no matter how much , you lose students. &quot; Not all foreign students , however , balk at higher fees . Kinuko Osada , for instance , finds the United States in_general -- and Oxnard College in specific -- a bargain , compared to her native Japan . Osada , 31 , moved_in with her aunt in Oxnard in December and registered at Oxnard College this month . &quot; I thought I need to study English , &quot; she said . &quot; If I go_to university in Japan , it ' s more expensive. &quot; A civil_servant at her local city_hall since high_school graduation , Osada decided this year to make a change . She has visited the United States before , but this time , she quit her job , gathered_up her belongings and money , and moved halfway around the world . &quot; My family -- well , they don ' t like it , but they can ' t stop me , &quot; she explained . &quot; It is unusual in my part of the country -- I come from a rural_area -- for women to do something like this. &quot; Osada said she hopes to continue on to a four-year university after receiving her associate ' s degree from Oxnard College . Actually , Moorpark College ' s Arnold said , foreign students are often among the best at the college , with 80 % of Moorpark ' s foreign students continuing on to a four-year institution upon graduation . &quot; They usually do very , very well scholastically , &quot; she said . Moorpark College ' s foreign students often tutor American students and are even occasionally called_on to lecture a class about a subject that relates to their home country , she said . &quot; In the classrooms , foreign students can add_to political discussions , &quot; she said . &quot; They bring reality into the classrooms. &quot;</TEXT>
