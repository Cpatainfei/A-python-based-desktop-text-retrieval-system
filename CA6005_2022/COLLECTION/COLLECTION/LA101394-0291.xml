   <HEADLINE> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY ; LIVE &amp; LEARN ; AT CAL POLY POMONA , 20 STUDENTS RESIDE IN A COMMUNAL CENTER THAT STRESSES RECYCLING AND SELF-SUFFICIENCY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dinner with &quot; the hippies on the_hill &quot; is no piece of steak . It is Sara Trifiro ' s turn as resident chef at Cal Poly Pomona ' s Center for Regenerative Studies , where 20 students live , work and study with solar_power , recycled waste water and organic crops -- a postmodern Biosphere II . On a secluded campus hilltop , Trifiro , 28 , is madly chopping bell_peppers from the garden for the organic eggplant-tomato casserole , to the funky beat of a Rested Root tape . Other students set the patio tables without landfill-clogging paper napkins -- they prefer hand_towels from the kitchen . After dinner , a tired Trifiro and crew wash the dishes in solar-heated water and dump the dishwater on the compost heap . &quot; Everything takes so_much work here , &quot; groaned Trifiro , a graduate_student in landscape_architecture . &quot; It just brings_home the point that everything you do , everything you buy , every place you go and how you get there . . . you start thinking_about it . We ' re trying to set an example here. &quot; As the center ' s first anniversary approaches , students say they are forgetting their old , wasteful ways of eating fast-food hamburgers from plastic-foam boxes or running the dryer for just one towel . Now , they use homemade solar barbecues built of foil , electric tape and cardboard boxes . They joke about their &quot; solar clothes_dryer &quot; -- a clothesline strung across a window . They throw pumpkin_seeds into the steaming compost heap to see how fertile their organic waste is ; sure enough , a fat pumpkin grows . &quot; We ' re learning about living , &quot; said Diana Jerkins , 45 , the center ' s new director , an agriculture expert from the University of Georgia . She lives there too . Cal Poly faculty_members designed the 16-acre center to promote regenerative studies , the use and reuse of natural_resources without damaging the environment . A Cal Poly landscape_architecture professor had conceived the center in 1976 as a project for his graduate_students , challenging them to come_up with ideas on a new , ecologically sound lifestyle . Major foundations embraced the concept and kicked_in funding . The $ 10-million complex , which is funded entirely by grants and donations , is the only one of its kind on a college campus , a throwback to the days of ' 60s communal living but with ' 90s technology . Within the next few years , plans call_for 90 people to live_in a mostly self-sustaining environment , similar to the now-defunct Biosphere II in Oracle , Ariz. , except that Cal Poly ' s complex is open . Next month , construction starts on the center ' s Phase II , a 3 # 240-square-foot addition with classrooms , offices and seminar rooms . The center opened last Thanksgiving weekend with 10 students but without full-time staff or organized operations . On Nov . 9 , Cal Poly officials will dedicate the center as part of Founder ' s Day , a ceremony to mark the 1949 donation of land that got the university started . Meanwhile , visitors tour the center every day , including researchers from Hungary , Africa and India . A year ago , the center looked unfinished , situated on barren land that was home to owls , hawks , snakes and tarantulas . There wasn ' t much there besides four solar-paneled buildings made of cedar from an old Louisiana barn . There were no trees , flowers or plants . No fish in the six ponds . No recycling system . &quot; The first year was spent philosophizing on our ethics , getting_to know each other , figuring_out exactly what we wanted to do here and what our goals were , &quot; said senior Nichole Sirbike , a 22-year-old animal science major . &quot; This year , we ' re really just doing all_the work we talked_about last year . It ' s really exciting to see things actually get done because we talked_about things for so long. &quot; Now , grapevines wind around trellises in front of the buildings ; in the summer , the leaves provide shade and in winter they fall_off and let sunlight in . Around the center , students planted pomegranate_trees , fig_trees , morning_glories , zinnias and other plants . In rooftop planter boxes , they ' re growing mint , savory and sage . Near the fishponds , which are teeming with tilapia , basil and lemongrass grow in planters made from old tires . Terraces on the hillside are shored_up with broken concrete . And students have adopted four cats and a dog . &quot; It ' s feeling like home , &quot; said Steve Nawrath , 28 , the resident manager since the center opened . Some outsiders call them hippies , weirdos , guinea_pigs or worse ; residents jokingly describe the center as &quot; cheap rent with a statement. &quot; &quot; I saw this as a place to start_out these new ideas so people can learn from us here , &quot; said senior Liza Pugeda , 22 , who could have graduated in June but chose to continue classes so she could live at the center . &quot; It really is a family . . . . I ' ve never had friends like I have friends here. &quot; Students rotate chores , such_as cooking , grocery shopping and gardening . Rent is $ 225 a month , the same as the dormitory rates , and students each chip_in $ 60 a month for food . For breakfast and lunch , residents grab whatever is in the refrigerator , and for dinner , they eat together . Each resident must pursue an academic minor in regenerative studies while juggling other classes . They are required to work_at the center six hours a week -- three hours of chores and three hours as part of their classroom studies . &quot; We ' re all here for one thing , &quot; said Trifiro , the sometime-chef . &quot; We ' re all bonded by the cause. &quot; Life takes time here -- and thought . Cars are frowned_upon , so students make an effort to walk or ride bikes up and down the center ' s steep , winding driveway , a half-mile trek . Say you want to clean your car trunk . You trundle a cart to your car , outside the center ' s gates . You load the cart , push it to the recycling bins and sort the trash : the organic waste in one pile , aluminum cans in another , tins and metal in another , one kind of plastic here , another kind of plastic there , the newspapers here , the white_paper there . Don ' t even think_about bringing_home groceries in plastic bags -- not when the center has its own collection of cloth sacks . And make_sure to check labels for recyclable packaging . Everybody polices each other , to_the_point of obsession , said junior Raisa Hussain , a 22-year-old civil_engineering major . &quot; Oh God , if I ate a Cup o ' Noodles over here , you know how many people would come tell me , ' Well , that has monosodium_glutamate in it , and it ' s ( plastic foam ) , which you can ' t even recycle because it takes too_much energy , and the plastic wrapping and the glossy wrapper . . . &quot; Hussain said , with exhaustion . &quot; It ' s like , geez , let me eat . . . . &quot; At her family ' s home_in San Dimas , Hussain said , she feels guilty flushing the toilet -- that ' s five gallons down the drain , whereas the center ' s low-flush toilets use 1.5 gallons . She feels so guilty that she tries to avoid drinking_water when she ' s there . At the center , over candlelight dinners , the students endlessly examine their ethics . Is it OK to plant non-edible flowers , just for looks and clippings ? And how much is too_much ? Do they want to eat the chickens arriving later this month , or just eat the eggs ? Even at a birthday_party , someone spotted toy party sunglasses , frowned and said : &quot; Oh great . Plastic waste. &quot; Tensions are inevitable , students say . On the refrigerator , someone has posted an anonymous plea that reminds residents to clean_up after themselves and close packages tightly . Food disappears so quickly that no one is shy about taking the last tofu wiener . By the end of the year , the residents plan to be growing much of_their_own food , including grains , oats and corn . Students have yet to cook fish from their ponds ; tests have shown that the fish have a high lead content , possibly from the pellets they are being fed . This quarter , students will decide whether to raise livestock such_as cows and goats to produce milk , keep the grass mowed and provide manure for fertilizer . Many residents , some of them vegetarians , oppose eating the animals , a subject still under debate . So far , only part of the solar-energy system is working . In each building , solar_panels heat only the water . Within the next few years , plans call_for the center to generate all_of its own electricity through solar_energy , windmills and water turbines . Residents think_about their own future and how their lives will change when they leave the center . Eventually , Hussain said , she ' d like to build her own regenerative house , perhaps of straw . &quot; Living like this is a ( key ) for our survival , &quot; she said . &quot; If you go_back to basics , the answers are simple , the solutions are easy , and everyone can do them. &quot; Life With the ' Regens ' It ' s been dubbed &quot; Biosphere without a lid &quot; because Cal Poly Pomona ' s Center for Regenerative Studies is so hard to explain . So what makes life different in a dormitory where 20 college_students are trying to cause as little harm to the environment as possible ? Biggest kitchen disaster : Macaroni with tofu cheese . What they call themselves : &quot; Regens , &quot; short for regenerative studies students . What others call them : Degenerates , tree huggers , granolas , students in &quot; Polysphere. &quot; Hopes for future crops : Grapes , for wine . Barley , for beer . Magazines on the kitchen_table : The Amicus Journal ( Natural_Resources Defense Council ) , Vegetarian Journal , The Economist . Clothes : 1960s redux -- tie-dye and sandals . Wheels : Mountain bicycles provided by the university . Recent dinner conversation : What causes less pollution , lighting a cigarette with a match or a butane lighter ? Pet project : Trying to set_up a self-sustaining aquarium-in-a-jar for pet guppies . Most common dumb question from visitors : Where are the vending_machines ?</TEXT>
