   <HEADLINE> UNESCO IS WORTH THE TROUBLE ; BY REJOINING , THE UNITED STATES WOULD AFFIRM TO THE WORLD ITS BELIEFS IN DEMOCRACY , HUMAN_RIGHTS AND A FREE PRESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United Nations is_on the ropes . Its &quot; peacekeeping &quot; in Bosnia never kept the peace and U.N. &quot; protective forces &quot; were not_able to stop attacks on relief convoys . But assessing the value of the United Nations in military terms misses much of where the United Nations ' value lies . Caring_for immunization of the world ' s children , getting relief to refugees and working to protect the oceans signal the way nations come_together in the United Nations . There is only one United Nations banner under which the United States does not participate : the United Nations Education , Scientific and Cultural Organization . UNESCO is the agency working to bring_together networks of scientists so that whole nations are not trapped in new forms of illiteracy -- scientific , technological and computer illiteracy . It is the agency that identifies the world ' s most precious historical , cultural and environmental sites and tries to educate people living near them to respect what they have and to encourage economic incentives to preserve them . Of the world ' s nations , 182 are UNESCO members . When the United States withdrew in 1984 , UNESCO , like much of the Cold_War world , had a polarized membership , talked_of licensing journalists and trampling with the free flow of information . Its leadership was charged with financial cronyism . Since then , the world has changed and so has UNESCO . The U.S. General Accounting Office reports that the problems that caused our departure have been resolved . Editors and publishers , leading educators and distinguished American scientists and Nobel laureates have called_for the United States to rejoin . But we have not . Why ? The United Nations gets you very few political points in the United States . Office-holders don ' t get re-elected for supporting it ; some lose because they do . Yet in this complex world , how would we function without U.N. institutions in place that bring us together to talk_about common problems ? Does_it cost us not to be a part of UNESCO ? I think it does . This is another missed opportunity to demonstrate with actions that we mean what our words say . When officials at the State_Department or in the White_House speak_of U.S. foreign-policy goals , they talk_of supporting democracy and human_rights around the world , of working for a free press internationally and of giving women a chance to develop themselves . Those are the goals expressed around the UNESCO board table . In another era , we would have fought to join with those who were working to shape young minds across the globe to confront the issues of the 21st Century . Not now . The reason given for the U.S. failure to re-enter UNESCO has been that &quot; we don ' t have the money. &quot; Yet , we recently announced that we can find $ 25 billion more for defense . UNESCO members get irritated when they hear the United States , the world ' s richest superpower , plead poverty . They know that if there was a will , the money -- which could amount to $ 100 million a year -- could be found . Americans have spent hundreds of millions this past year responding to world tragedy . Some of that money might be_better spent by educating people about democracy , human_rights and tolerance . As a U.S. government-appointed observer to the recent UNESCO board_meeting , I was struck by how much of UNESCO ' s mandate meshed with the work being undertaken by the U.S. Agency for International Development . Some of those AID programs could be performed under the U.N. insignia . Many U.N. agencies , including UNESCO , have serious management problems . The U.S. goal should be to make them perform better , and this is more easily done from the inside . We in the United States have to learn to work with countries in new partnerships and see international humanitarian and development work_through new prisms . The failure of the United Nations militarily in Bosnia should not cause us to abandon other aspects of U.N. work . Despite the substantive and international political reasons to rejoin UNESCO , the United States probably won ' t . Some new money might be found to support favored programs that UNESCO is undertaking , but in the polarized Washington of today , a skittish Administration wanting to pick its struggles carefully will likely decide , as I was told at the National Security_Council , &quot; UNESCO ' s not worth the trouble. &quot; Too_bad .</TEXT>
