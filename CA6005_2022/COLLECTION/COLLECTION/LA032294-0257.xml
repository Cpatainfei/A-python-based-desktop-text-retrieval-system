   <HEADLINE> ART / CATHY CURTIS ; UNCONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ; CRAFTS SHOW AT NEWPORT HARBOR INTRIGUES IN MANY WAYS , MOST OF THEM UNINTENTIONAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What do crafts lovers Dorothy and George Saxe of Palo Alto collect ? Really good stuff and really bad stuff . What qualities do their works have in common ? Beats me . A group of 124 objects in glass , ceramics , wood and metal -- about one-fifth of the collection the couple have gathered during the past decade -- is at the Newport Harbor Art Museum ( through June 5 ) . The show is_on tour from the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio , which owns 63 objects donated by the Saxes . Unlike most exhibitions drawn from a single private collection , &quot; Contemporary Crafts and the Saxe Collection &quot; doesn ' t seem to reflect a specific taste so_much as the desire to own work by well-known practitioners in the field . But despite its curious lack of personality -- and the dismal way it is installed at the museum , which I ' ll get_to later -- the show is intriguing in several ways , most of them no doubt unintentional . It includes objects with strong sensual allure as well as hideous clunkers . It sums_up some of the central problems with contemporary craft , which is frequently too cute , bland or overdone to be taken seriously . It demonstrates the frustrating scarcity of irony ( as opposed to parody ) in the craft world , and that world ' s tendency to repackage artistic approaches into blander , prettified versions . And it comes_with a catalogue that minutely documents shifts in patronage over the past 40 years or so for each craft medium . The bulk of the work_on view is in glass -- the Saxes ' first love and most assiduously collected medium -- and ceramics , media that yield nearly all_the beauty and wit in the show . ( One exception : Kay Sekimachi ' s enchanting translucent paper bowl from 1982 with its flurry of linen threads tossing around the rim. ) Beauty lurks most often in traditional vessel forms , such_as Mark Peiser ' s delicately descriptive crystal vase &quot; Leda and the Swan &quot; and Rudolf Staffel ' s creamy floral relief porcelain vase &quot; Light Gatherer. &quot; Both artists employ sophisticated techniques to heighten the qualities inherent in their media . Drawing from art history ' s ample catalogue of visual imagery , Peiser introduces subtle surface effects of color and pattern that exploit the transparency of glass . Staffel expresses the pliant delicacy of plant_life in the most malleable of media , one that retains the imprint and pressure of the artist ' s hand . * Other works in the show reflect aspects of contemporary art , filtered in varying ways through the innately conservative aesthetics of the craft world . The best -- and probably the most amusing -- piece is Adrian Saxe ' s speckled trio of gourd-shaped porcelain vessels , &quot; A &amp; B ( Gourd Garniture ) , &quot; from 1987 . The comically squat gourds sit , like royalty , on stepped golden Chinese-style pedestals , and the little golden &quot; crown &quot; stoppers look suspiciously like the sort of candy dishes that used to be found in middle-class American parlors . Each stopper , underlining Saxe ' s droll yet conceptually acute sensibility , bears an upright three-dimensional letter or elegant typographical sign ( the a , b and &amp; of the title ) . The larger central gourd wears the ampersand , as if to emphasize the importance of bringing_together elements of design from different cultures -- or different points_of_view at a tea_party . Although the piece by Saxe ( no relation_to the collecting couple ) would n ' t be out_of_place in a forward-looking show of contemporary art , Mary Shaffer ' s technically ambitious &quot; Hanging Series No . 24 &quot; from 1978 doesn ' t venture into the more intriguing reaches of ' 70s minimalism . The huge , slumping mass of glass dangling from a cradle of twisted wires incorporates some of the anarchic , gravity-determined quality of Eva Hesse ' s last sculptures of 1970 . But by forming the piece to look_like a garment with sleeves ( angel wings ? ) , Shaffer remained faithful to the figurative bias of so many craft artists who break_away from the vessel , thereby delimiting the viewer ' s field of association . * Clifford Rainey takes a quasi-anthropological tack in &quot; Fetish , &quot; a Coca-Cola bottle made of cracked and crazed recycled glass skewered with nails and layered with shards of plate_glass . It suggests a cross between the bushmen-meet-Western-culture theme of the film &quot; The Gods Must Be Crazy &quot; and a symbol of the rage of the disenfranchised at corporate coercion in contemporary life . The problem with the piece is that it looks too_much like a well-crafted object and not enough like the embodiment of bitter , make-do voodoo . Peter Voulkos , generally acknowledged as the guy who turned the finicky field of ceramics into a Western fine-art medium , now suffers the fate of an artist whose revolution inspired legions of untalented imitators -- and whose style has long been out of vogue . Today , his asymmetrical scarred , Abstract Expressionist-inspired sculptures have lost their original brute power and now read as stylized artifacts from the modern era . Conversely , Viola Frey ' s towering ceramic figures fit_in well with our era of skepticism and ennui . &quot; Man Observing Series II &quot; is a nearly nine-foot-tall male figure in an improbably colorful business_suit . Arms akimbo , he peers at something or someone of lesser stature . Dwarfed by this cartoon-like befuddled giant , the viewer begins to feel rather like a misbehaving child . Irv Tepper ' s outsize porcelain cup &quot; Roger &quot; is one of many he has imbued with sad-sack anthropomorphic characteristics . Broken , bashed in and ominously scuffed , the piece is awash in self-conscious pitifulness , all_the more campily poignant because of the cup ' s ungainly size : Hey , even big guys have thin skins . But how absurd to have to view this piece from so far away that you practically need a telescopic lens ! Rather than display the three-dimensional objects in cases -- which permit full observation while protecting fragile work from over-enthusiastic or larcenous viewers -- Newport Harbor opted to maroon them on vast two-tiered platforms jury-rigged from ugly brown fiberboard . Virtually all_the smaller pieces -- the detailed ones you naturally want to see close_up -- are stashed as far away from the viewer as possible and do not permit viewing in the round . The temptation -- it ' s forbidden , of course -- is to scramble up_on the platforms for a better view . Inexplicably , at the opposite extreme , Bertil Vallien ' s large glass piece , &quot; Crystal Arrow , &quot; hangs_out in the open at hip level where guards must keep close watch_over viewers with the urge to touch . * Work in the show that lacks strong sensuous appeal and / or viable ideas generally has little more to offer than cuteness ( Alphonse Mattia ' s humanoid wood &quot; Hors d ' Oeuvres Server &quot; with cocktail franks for eyebrows ) , chichi eclecticism ( painter Billy Al Bengston ' s table , &quot; Kane Variation No . 20 &quot; ) , bland decoration ( nearly all_the fiber works ) or a clunky , dated attempt at artiness ( Judy Moonelis ' s ceramic piece , &quot; Untitled ( Green Storm ) &quot; ) . Unfortunately , these qualities are in generous supply , suggesting that this show may_not have been the best choice for a museum specializing in modern and contemporary art . An ideal exhibition for Newport Harbor would include objects on the basis of their content , and discuss them in ways that clearly relate to the larger world of art . The point isn ' t that it ' s somehow less worthy to make work in ceramic or fiber instead of paint or bronze . After all , it is a commonplace today that artists make work_out of any materials they wish , whether permanent or ephemeral , lovely or appalling . The issue is that some work made in &quot; craft &quot; media merely waters_down ideas from the art world while other work actually extends the dialogue . A more pertinent show would highlight not the medium but the message . &quot; Contemporary Crafts and the Saxe Collection &quot; remains through June 5 at the Newport Harbor Art Museum , 850 San Clemente Drive , Newport Beach . Hours : 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday . Admission : $ 4 adults , $ 2 students and seniors , free for children under 12 , free for everyone on Tuesdays . ( 714 ) 759-1122 .</TEXT>
