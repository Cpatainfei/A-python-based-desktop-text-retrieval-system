   <HEADLINE> O.C SNEEZES , WHEEZES IN WINDS ' WAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you had that itchy-eyed , raw-skinned , tight-chested , stuffy , sneezy , wheezy sort of feeling for the last few days , there ' s good news on the horizon . The cursed Santa Ana winds , which each fall deliver misery to thousands of coastal residents , are just about through_with their first assault of the season . For now , &quot; this episode is pretty much over , &quot; said Kris Farnsworth , meteorologist for WeatherData Inc. , which supplies forecasts to The Times . Unfortunately , doctors say , the winds leave a trail of suffering in their wake , and some of their ill effects will linger for a_few more days . And there are more Santa Anas expected -- there are usually three or four episodes per autumn . The dry , hot winds from the Great Basin blow in all kinds of tiny irritants and particles -- mostly weed and grass pollen , mold spores and dust -- which stir_up allergies and aggravate eye , skin and respiratory conditions such_as asthma and emphysema . &quot; It has profound effects , &quot; said Dr. Stanley P . Galant , director of pediatric allergy and immunology at UC Irvine . &quot; As the wind blows toward the ocean , it sweeps everything in its path into the eyes and nose and lungs of susceptible individuals. &quot; This time around , some folks didn ' t wait to see a doctor on Monday -- they high-tailed it to the local emergency_room during the weekend . &quot; We were extremely busy because of respiratory problems of all kinds , &quot; said Dr. Bill Honigman , an emergency_room physician at Kaiser Permanente Medical_Center in Anaheim . &quot; When people can ' t breathe , they have to see somebody immediately. &quot; The breezes can trigger life-threatening breathing problems , sending people to intensive-care units and forcing them onto ventilators . But most often , immunologists and other physicians say , they simply make people feel lousy . Allergists and immunologists all_over Orange County dealt with the fallout on Monday . &quot; They come_in with itchy red , watery eyes ; sneezy , itchy , runny noses ; nasal congestion , flare-ups of eczema ( an inflammation of the skin ) . . . . You can also see an increase in asthma , because of the pollen , &quot; said Dr. Rhonda Myers , an Irvine allergy , asthma and immunology specialist . The hot , dry air just makes things worse . &quot; It dries_out the mucous_membranes of the respiratory_tract ( and ) exacerbates the allergies of the eyes , nose , lungs and skin , &quot; said Dr. Donald Levy of Orange , another busy allergist and immunologist . About 20 % of the population , Levy said , suffers some form of allergy , which is an exaggerated or inappropriate response of the immune_system . During the Santa Anas , doctors generally treat reactions with medication -- inhaled bronchodilators for asthmatics , for example , or antihistamines such_as Seldane . Doctors said allergic effects such_as inflammation in the sinuses can make people more susceptible to viral infections -- compounding the effects of a bad reaction . But the misery is not confined to those with allergies : Many others find that the breezes rob their bodies of moisture , causing skin_rashes or eye irritations . The winds are especially hard on those who wear contact_lenses and those who already suffer from chronically dry eyes . &quot; Basically we live_in the desert , where you get a lot of tear evaporation and retain less moisture , &quot; said Dr. Richard H . Keates , chairman of UC Irvine ' s ophthalmology department . &quot; If you add this hot wind , it just exaggerates it . One of the most common things people have is dry eyes. &quot; Another danger is that floating particles stirred_up by the incoming breezes can land smack in the eyes . To avoid the brunt of the Santa Ana breezes , doctors recommend that people stay inside as much as possible , with their windows and doors shut . Running an air conditioner can not only relieve the heat , but act_as an air_filter . Parents of children with allergies and respiratory problems should handle the Santa Ana episodes just as they would a serious smog alert , doctors said . Other recommendations include : * Taking allergy and other medications -- such_as inhaled steroids -- preventively , before symptoms occur ; * Running humidifiers at night to replace lost moisture in the air ; * Applying sunscreen and other oils to moisten the skin ; * Wearing sunglasses ; * Applying artificial tear preparations and allergy drops to the eyes . * REMAINING VIGILANT : O.C. firefighters stay_on alert as hot , dry Santa Anas abate .
