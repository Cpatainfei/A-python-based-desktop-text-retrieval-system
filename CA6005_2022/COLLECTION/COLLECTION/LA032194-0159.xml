   <HEADLINE> TEACHERS ASSN . IS NEUTRAL ON PRIMARY RACE FOR GOVERNOR ; POLITICS : NEITHER BROWN NOR GARAMENDI WINS 60 % OF DELEGATE VOTES IN THE STATE ' S LARGEST EDUCATORS UNION . INSURANCE COMMISSIONER NONETHELESS VIEWS THE VOTE AS A VICTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Providing an unexpectedly ambiguous end to a weekend marked by relentless lobbying , the California Teachers Assn. , the state ' s largest teachers union , announced Sunday that it will not endorse a candidate in the June 7 gubernatorial primary . The surprise announcement came_after CTA delegates twice split their votes between state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi . In a first ballot Saturday and then in a runoff on Sunday , neither candidate won 60 % of delegates ' support -- the threshold required for endorsement under union rules . The standoff was widely perceived as a victory for Garamendi , who is running behind Brown in the polls . Many had expected Brown , a former Los Angeles school_board member , to win the endorsement of the union despite her differences with the rank_and_file , some who resented her support of the breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School District and her support of charter schools , in which parents , teachers and community leaders customize each school ' s curriculum . Of the 532 ballots cast in Sunday ' s runoff , Brown received 288 votes , Garamendi 244 . At least 320 votes were required to win the endorsement of the union , which represents 230 # 000 public_school teachers and is among the largest fund-raising organizations in the state . Michael Reese , Brown ' s campaign spokesman , put a positive spin on the CTA ' s decision , noting that although Brown did not win the endorsement , she did receive the recommendation of the CTA ' s 24-member board of directors , which formally urged its 660 delegates to vote for her . &quot; This was always going_to be a very difficult endorsement for us to win , with the 60 % threshold . That she won the ( board ' s ) recommendation was a victory all on its own , &quot; he said . Asked to explain the outcome , he said : &quot; Garamendi is a master at pandering . He was lock-step with their issues . No questions asked. &quot; Darry Sragow , Garamendi ' s campaign manager , countered : &quot; Being in sync with the views of the electorate may be pandering with Kathleen Brown . It just happens to be where John Garamendi is. &quot; Sragow said he was &quot; thrilled &quot; with the CTA ' s decision , which he considers &quot; a win. &quot; Noting that Garamendi has received the endorsement of the California Federation of Teachers , which has 40 # 000 members , Sragow said : &quot; John Garamendi is the only candidate for governor who has been endorsed by teachers. &quot; The last time the CTA failed to endorse in a primary for governor was in 1974 , when the leading Democratic candidate was Brown ' s brother , Jerry . After Jerry Brown won the primary , the CTA endorsed him against Republican Atty . Gen . Evelle Younger . The CTA ' s delegate assembly will meet again after the June primary to consider endorsing a gubernatorial candidate in the November general_election . Sunday ' s runoff capped a tumultuous weekend during which both campaigns vied aggressively for CTA support . Garamendi ' s campaign , expecting a Brown victory , went_on the offensive Saturday , faxing to reporters complaints that the endorsement process had been tainted by what Sragow called a conflict_of_interest -- a supposed business connection between one CTA official and the Brown campaign . CTA officials denied that Brown received any special treatment . Brown campaign staffers called the suggestion of conflict_of_interest insulting . It is unlikely that the implications had any impact because they did not reach most delegates . By Sunday morning , the contest seemed so close that Brown and Garamendi took the unusual step of dropping_by the Los Angeles hotel where the CTA was meeting to shake delegates ' hands one last time . &quot; that ' s very unusual , &quot; said Ned Hopkins , an associate executive_director of the CTA . &quot; Candidates usually stay away. &quot; Hopkins called the failure to endorse a surprise , and he attributed the close vote_in part to Garamendi ' s tough campaigning . &quot; Garamendi made a wonderful impression at a candidates forum we had in January . . . . He was articulate , right on the issues , and really made a favorable impression . Most people thought he had won that debate , &quot; said Hopkins , who noted that most CTA delegates later received Garamendi campaign mailers . During the weekend , he noted , delegates were greeted by Garamendi campaign literature on their chairs . On Sunday morning , the candidate himself appeared -- more_than an hour before Brown showed_up . &quot; He was there right at 9 o ' clock when the session began . She came at 10:30 , &quot; Hopkins said . The CTA delegates did endorse several candidates , including : Controller Gray Davis for lieutenant_governor , Assemblyman Tom Umberg ( D-Garden Grove ) for attorney_general , Assemblyman Rusty Areias ( D-San Jose ) for controller , former California Democratic Party Chairman Phil Angelides for treasurer , Assemblywoman Gwen Moore ( D-Los Angeles ) for secretary_of_state and Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin ( D-Fremont ) for superintendent of public instruction .</TEXT>
