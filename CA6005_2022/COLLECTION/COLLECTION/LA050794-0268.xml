   <HEADLINE> FESTIVALS SHOWCASE ASIAN PACIFIC FILM TREASURES ; MOVIES : TWO MAJOR EVENTS THIS MONTH DISPLAY THE REGION ' S FILMS BUT POINT UP THE PAUCITY OF THEATRICAL OUTLETS , A SITUATION THAT MAY BE CHANGING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ninth Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film and Video Festival will open May 18 , establishing itself as the largest event of its kind in the country . This year ' s edition will showcase 112 works , including nine features in their American premieres and three more in their West Coast premieres . Sponsors are the UCLA Film and Television Archive and Visual Communications , an L.A.-based Asian Pacific American media arts center . Meanwhile , the 14-year-old Hawai ' i International Film Festival will present , for the first time in Los Angeles , its sixth annual Asia-Pacific Film Tour . It will stop at USC Sunday through Friday as part of an 11-city tour to display six recent features and four video documentaries focusing_on Hawaiian history and culture . * If these festivals attest to the growing awareness of the Asian Pacific cinema , they also call attention to the paucity of such films in local theaters . The old warning regarding foreign films may still be true : Festivals may be your only opportunity to see them . Yet happily this may be changing . In a near yearlong experiment , from April , 1993 , to March , 1994 , Rim Films , a subsidiary of Raymond Chow ' s Golden Harvest Productions , booked one of the screens at the Monica 4-Plex with only Hong Kong product . Golden Harvest ultimately decided to refocus its priorities , which include launching into Southeast Asian production , and got_out of exhibition . It did prove , however , that there is an audience , mainly younger and racially and ethnically diverse , for Asian Pacific pictures . As a result , some of the more venturesome small distribution companies are considering taking_a_chance on Hong Kong product ; no doubt they will be looking_upon these two festivals with interest . For nearly eight decades , except the World_War_II years , Los Angeles was never without a Japanese-language theater , and by at least the ' 60s those films were always presented with English subtitles . The long-defunct Toho La Brea attracted a largely non-Asian audience , especially when it presented samurai movies , and over the years such sadly missed theaters as the Kabuki , the Kokusai and the Little Tokyo Cinemas attempted to attract crossover audiences . This has never been the case with the Chinese-language theaters , several of which continue to thrive without making any effort to reach beyond the Chinese community . Filipino films haven ' t had a local showcase since the Linda Lea on Main_Street for at least a decade , and the Indian cinema , which at various times has had its own local showcases , has been co-opted by the near-instant availability of its films on cassette . Unsubtitled Korean films have been a staple at the Four Star Theater for years , but only with the recent &quot; Two Cops , &quot; presented at the Vista ( because of earthquake damage at the Four Star ) , has there been an attempt to reach non-Korean moviegoers . * The irony of these vicissitudes in exhibition is that the Asian Pacific cinema has as rich and varied a heritage as the American and European cinemas , especially the Japanese , who have been responsible_for some of the greatest films made anywhere . It therefore seems a safe bet that both festivals will have their own treasures . Hawai ' i Film Festival director Jeannette Paulson has been especially impressed with Xie Fei ' s &quot; The Women From the Lake of the Scented Souls &quot; ( USC Norris Theater , Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. ) , a strong women ' s drama that just happened to be UCLA ' s Asian Pacific Fest closing-night attraction last year ; &quot; Southern Winds &quot; ( Norris , Monday at 5 p.m. ) , an anthology film with contributions by four Asian directors dealing with the common theme of changing Asia , and &quot; Act of War &quot; ( Norris , Friday at 8 p.m. ) , a video documentary , made collectively , on the 1893 U.S. invasion of the independent kingdom of Hawaii . Along with a retrospective of a selection of ' 30s films by Yasujiro Ozu , one of Japan ' s greatest directors -- his 1952 &quot; Tokyo Story &quot; is a staple of all-time best lists -- UCLA / Visual Communications ' offerings span &quot; Canadian Tales , &quot; short works by Canadian Asian Pacific filmmakers , to the experimental work of Yoko Ono and a series of contemporary Korean films . The opening-night attraction is Huang Jianxin ' s &quot; The Wooden Man ' s Bride &quot; ( UCLA Melnitz , May 19 , 7 p.m. ) , a folk tale about a woman forced to marry the wooden effigy of the man she was betrothed to , from the maker of the controversial &quot; Black Cannon Incident. &quot; Also from China : Zhang Yuan ' s &quot; Beijing Bastards &quot; ( Laemmle ' s Grande , May 20 , 9 p.m. ) , described by film historian Tony Rayns , an Asian Pacific specialist , as a &quot; seemingly free-form portrait of rock-generation kids in the city. &quot; Chung Ji-Young ' s &quot; White Badge &quot; ( Melnitz , May 21 , 7 p.m. ) is the first Korean film to depict the experiences of that country ' s Vietnam_War veterans , 300 # 000 of whom fought alongside U.S. troops . Also highly touted is Beat Takeshi ' s Japanese gangster picture &quot; Sonatine &quot; ( Melnitz , May 24 , 9 p.m. ) . &quot; Sopyonje &quot; ( Grande , May 24 , 7 p.m. ) , Korea ' s biggest box-office hit ever , is a sad tale focusing_on the itinerant pansori singers of the ' 50s -- pansori is akin to the blues -- made by Korea ' s most celebrated director , Im Kwon-Taek . Carlos Siguion-Reyna ' s &quot; I Will Wait for You in Heaven &quot; ( Grande , May 25 , 7 p.m. ) transposes Emily Bronte ' s &quot; Wuthering Heights &quot; to the Philippines in the present . Closing the UCLA / Visual Communications festival on May 29 at 7 p.m. in Melnitz Theater is Hong Kong filmmaker Clara Law ' s &quot; Temptation of a Monk , &quot; an allegory set_in the Tang Dynasty that deals with two imperial princes scheming to succeed to the throne . * Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film and Video Festival , ( 310 ) 206-FILM ; Hawai ' i International Film Festival 1994 Asia-Pacific Film Tour , ( 213 ) 740-3334 .</TEXT>
