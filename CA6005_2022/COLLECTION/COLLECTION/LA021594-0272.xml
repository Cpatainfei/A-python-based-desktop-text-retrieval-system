   <HEADLINE> QUAKE INSURANCE : MOBILE_HOMES ' SILVER LINING ; DISASTER : MANY TRAILERS WERE KNOCKED OFF THEIR BLOCKS OR BURNED . MOST OWNERS ARE COVERED BUT SOME can ' t PAY THE DEDUCTIBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If there ' s a silver_lining for owners of earthquake-damaged mobile_homes , it ' s that most were insured for quakes , compared with just one-third of all other houses in Southern California . Although about 5 # 600 mobile_homes -- or one out of 10 in Los Angeles County -- were deemed unlivable after the Jan . 17 temblor , most are expected to be rebuilt because quakes are usually included as part of a mobile_home owner ' s comprehensive insurance_policy . &quot; About 85 % of the people here didn ' t think they had earthquake insurance but they found_out they had it , &quot; said Curt Atwell , owner of Crest Mobile_Home Village in Simi Valley . Atwell said all but two or three of the 40 homeowners at his seniors-only park had earthquake coverage . &quot; Earthquake insurance is one of the greatest benefits of a mobile_home policy , &quot; said Ruth Walker , a spokeswoman for Foremost Insurance of Grand Rapids , Mich. , the nation ' s biggest insurer of mobile_homes , which has about 150 # 000 policyholders in California . Walker says Foremost has received 2 # 707 claims related to the Northridge earthquake and expects a net loss of $ 13 million -- larger than its losses from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . Even with insurance , however , many residents of mobile_home parks who are retired or earn small incomes say they can ' t afford to cover their $ 2 # 000 to $ 3 # 000 earthquake deductible payments . Mobile_home policies often come_with a 5 % deductible of the property value , compared with 10 % deductibles for conventional homeowner earthquake policies , which must be paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks_in . Insurance will be crucial to rebuild places such_as Tahitian Mobile_Home Park in Sylmar , where more_than 60 of the 240 mobile_homes went_up in flames from the earthquake . Last week charred remains of ovens , car shells and twisted metal and ashes littered a large section of the grounds . Many homes were emptied_of furniture , with only a sign_on the windows identifying the insurance_company and policy number . &quot; Do you think some people would like to move_out here ? &quot; asked Jean Priestman , who owns a single-wide trailer at space No . 28 , just a_couple_of houses away from the hollow remains of a burned trailer . Priestman , 56 , bought her trailer nine years ago for $ 30 # 000 . She has a $ 19 # 000 mortgage on her property and has insurance through Foremost . But the quake has made Priestman fearful of living in mobile_homes . * &quot; I don ' t think mobile_homes are that safe , &quot; she said , sitting inside her dark and cold trailer , still without utilities . &quot; It ' s going_to be scary , &quot; Priestman said before she launched into a description of the pandemonium that reigned the morning of Jan . 17 when it appeared the whole park would go_up in flames . &quot; I ' m not anxious to be here alone. &quot; Priestman said she would rebuild . But some owners at Tahitian and other mobile_home parks have walked away from their damaged homes , contractors and residents say , and others have sold their damaged trailers on the spot for as little as $ 3 # 000 . There are renewed safety concerns at many mobile_home communities , and many residents worry about further depreciation of their homes , which have trouble keeping their values even in good economic times . Mobile_home owners also face higher insurance_premiums as a result of the earthquake . Foremost last week applied to the state for a 13.6 % rate increase . That is_on top of a 29 % increase granted earlier this year for Foremost and 19 % for American Federation , a Foremost subsidiary . Foremost , among other insurers of mobile_homes , currently charges between $ 200 and $ 300 in annual premium for a comprehensive mobile_home policy in California . that ' s relatively expensive given that an average trailer sells for about $ 30 # 000 -- or about one-seventh the price of a single-family house in the region . Conventional home insurance_premiums typically run $ 500 to $ 600 a year without earthquake coverage , which costs an additional $ 2 per $ 1 # 000 coverage . State Farm , the state ' s biggest insurer of homes , says it charges about $ 150 in annual premium for a typical mobile_home policy , and it costs an extra 15 % for special earthquake coverage . State Farm has about 15 # 000 policyholders in the Los Angeles area , but the insurer did not have a breakdown for mobile_home claims from the quake . The state ' s Housing and Community Development Department reports that of the 5 # 600 mobile_homes that were severely damaged by the quake , about 4 # 500 trailers slid off their tripod supports . Most of these were in the San Fernando Valley , but the quake also affected several mobile_home parks in Simi Valley . In all , state figures show that 184 mobile_homes burned to the ground in fires ignited mainly by ruptured gas_lines from the earthquake . The extent of the damage and the pace of repairs since the quake vary widely from one park to the next . At Sunburst Park Mobile_Homes in Chatsworth , all but a_few of the 118 homes lurched off their tripod piers . Two trailers burned_down , one killing a 92-year-old woman when her home burst into flames . J K Construction , an Orange County-based contractor that has set_up its own trailer for an anticipated yearlong repair at Sunburst , said it has already raised 80 trailers back on their tripods at a cost of $ 1 # 500 to $ 3 # 500 each . The overall repair bills for a trailer at Sunburst will be much higher , work crews said , because floors , aluminum sidings and awnings , wood paneling and utility lines all have to be fixed . Bev Miller , a 17-year resident of Sunburst , says she is fortunate to have survived . The earthquake caused her double-wide home to move three feet and land on the ground , crushing water and utility lines underneath her trailer and causing a main gas leak that wasn ' t shut_off until 24 hours later . &quot; They said we were real lucky we didn ' t have a fire , &quot; said Miller , who with her husband , Jim , have since lived_in a rented motor_home parked next to their trailer . Inside her spacious 1 # 500-square-foot home , the chandelier and ceiling fan were both down , walls were cracked and the ceiling was bent . Bev Miller estimated total repair bills at around $ 30 # 000 -- the price the Millers paid_for the home 17 years ago . The Millers have an $ 80 # 000 policy through Michigan Millers Insurance , another specialty carrier based in Lansing , Mich. , for which they pay $ 400 a year in premium . And their deductible is $ 4 # 000 . * The Millers , who are in their 60s , have applied for a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency . Bev Miller says she would like to move her trailer to Arizona , to get_away from earthquakes , increasing crime in the Valley and the $ 400 a month they now pay_for space rent . But she said a move was unlikely . &quot; A few years ago they said it would cost us $ 8 # 000 to move it 100 miles , &quot; she said . Indeed , the high cost of hauling mobile_homes is the main reason most manufactured houses never leave their first site . A mobile_home , long viewed_as a stepchild of the housing_industry , also does not hold its value as well as a conventional house . &quot; In the last couple of years mobile_home values have dropped 25 % to 45 % , &quot; says Anne Hetherington , a Remax real_estate_agent in Granada Hills who has specialized in mobile_homes for the last 15 years . While Hetherington doesn ' t expect the earthquake to hurt the mobile_home market much , she says it won ' t help it , either . In Sylmar , at the Tahitian Mobile_Home Park , resident Sharon Frick still remembers the morning of the earthquake . &quot; Oooh , it was such a boom , &quot; she said . &quot; The fire started , we had to get_out , but the door was stuck . All the gas_mains were exploding . . . . If there ' s another earthquake , it ' s all going_to happen again. &quot; Frick , too , had insurance , but she wasn ' t sure she could pay the $ 2 # 000 deductible because she has been laid_off from her job . Her employer , a Robinson-May Co . store in the Topanga Mall in Canoga Park , was damaged by the quake and it may_not reopen for several months . &quot; I don ' t know , it ' s so discouraging , &quot; she said . &quot; It looks_like a bomb hit this place . All our neighbors are gone. &quot; In Simi Valley , at a big , family-oriented trailer_park called Simi Country , few of the 250 mobile_homes that were toppled had been raised back_up and most were without utility . At space No . 159 one day last week , Connie Lial stood nearby her pink trailer . When she saw a visitor pass_by , she said eagerly , &quot; Are you from FEMA ? &quot; Lial , unemployed , said she does not have earthquake insurance . &quot; Everything is down inside . The roof leaks . The carpet ' s all wet . I don ' t have no light , no gas , no water . Nothing. &quot;</TEXT>
