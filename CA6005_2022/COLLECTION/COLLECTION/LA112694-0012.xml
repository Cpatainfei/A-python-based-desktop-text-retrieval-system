   <HEADLINE> NAFTA BOOSTS U.S. EXPORTS , CASE FOR GATT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even as Congress ponders the most sweeping liberalization of international trade rules ever attempted , a narrower treaty relaxing trade_barriers between the United States , Canada and Mexico is beginning to result in increased U.S. exports , particularly to Mexico . President Clinton is banking on the early experience with the relatively small-bore North_American Free_Trade Agreement to help him sell Congress on the gigantic General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , which would reduce tariffs and other trade_barriers among 124 countries . GATT will be the sole item on the agenda when Congress reconvenes Tuesday . NAFTA is not exactly a miniature GATT . For one thing , NAFTA will eventually remove all barriers to trade between its three participants , while the global agreement would reduce and equalize tariffs around the world but not eliminate them . The final verdict on NAFTA , which took_effect in January , is years away . Nevertheless , most analysts agree that the early experience under NAFTA shines a favorable light on trade liberalization generally . Nowhere to be found is the &quot; giant sucking sound &quot; that 1992 presidential candidate Ross Perot warned about -- the sound of U.S. manufacturing jobs drawn to Mexico , where labor is so_much cheaper . Quite the contrary , NAFTA may result in more jobs for workers in the United States , not fewer . Caterpillar Inc. , for example , reports that its sales of giant earthmoving equipment to Mexico during the first_half of the year soared 77 % above last year ' s levels . Midwestern farmers are selling three times as much corn to Mexico this year as last . &quot; Thanks to NAFTA , new exports to Mexico and Canada have helped our businesses create as_many as 100 # 000 jobs , &quot; Clinton claimed in a recent speech . &quot; In the six months after the treaty ' s adoption , exports from the United States to Mexico increased nearly 20 % , about three times the rate of our overall export growth in this time of economic expansion. &quot; U.S. residents are also buying more Mexican products , more_than offsetting the surge in U.S. exports to Mexico . The U.S. trade surplus with Mexico dropped_by half during the first six months of 1994 , from $ 1.64 billion a year earlier to $ 810 million this year . But analysts say many of the Mexican goods being bought_in the United States are not replacing U.S.-made products but are items that buyers in the United States otherwise would not have bought_at all . Not every U.S. industry is coming_out ahead . Economist Charles W . McMillion of MBG Information Services , a business information , analysis and forecasting firm in Washington , says the United States has boosted its exports of plastics , iron , steel and fertilizer . Mexico is selling more electronic_equipment , surgical_instruments and optical equipment to the United States , as well as automobiles and auto parts . &quot; The losers ( in the United States ) are high-tech , high-wage , California-type products , and the winners are bulk commodities , &quot; McMillion said . &quot; It ' s completely at_odds with the theory that we export high-skill , high-wage products to Mexico and we import simple products and raw materials. &quot; With import taxes falling , Mexico has purchased 44 # 000 U.S.-made automobiles during the first 10 months of 1994 , six times the number purchased in all_of 1993 , according to the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn . On the other hand , McMillion said in an interview , the Big Three auto_companies have increased the number of cars they are building_in Mexico and selling in this country . Overall , argues the Clinton_Administration , NAFTA is clearly a net plus . &quot; Last year we predicted that NAFTA could support 200 # 000 jobs within two years . We are right on track to achieve this , &quot; U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in a statement marking the first anniversary last week of congressional approval of the trade pact . He also said that no one has used the trade agreement as the basis to challenge U.S. environmental regulations or health and safety standards -- although there has been no significant progress in beginning a border cleanup in Mexico that was a central element of the trade plan ' s environmental provisions . One of the ironies of the angry debate over the North_American accord has been the effect it has had in the Midwest , where much of the opposition was centered -- and where manufacturers such_as Caterpillar , long a backer of the trade plan , and farmers are happily taking_advantage of the lowered barriers . &quot; The center of American export industry is the Midwest , &quot; said Barry P . Bosworth , an economist at the Brookings Institution , a public policy research organization in Washington . &quot; Yet it was the Midwest congressional bloc that voted against it. &quot; And in the border town of Laredo , Tex. , business is booming as big diesel rigs rumble back and forth across the border at an ever-increasing rate . Restaurants have opened , distribution warehouses have been established , and the Mall del Norte has been expanded . In the year ending Sept . 30 , 1993 , roughly 113 # 500 trucks entered the United States from Mexico at the Laredo-Nuevo Laredo border crossing . That figure grew a year later to nearly 191 # 000 , according to Audrey Adams , the district director of the U.S. Customs Service . At the same time , U.S. shipments to Mexico increased threefold . When Adams served in the same region a decade ago , it was not uncommon for U.S. merchandise bound for Mexico to sit in a warehouse for nearly a year while Mexican taxes were assessed and paperwork was completed . Now , she said , &quot; it ' s just not happening like that. &quot; Instead , goods are flowing into the region from throughout the United States , and they move right along into Mexico . And products from Mexican factories -- television_sets , for example , or windshield_wipers for cars being assembled in this country -- are moving north . &quot; There is no problem getting the permits , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s a very free flow of cargo. &quot; &quot; Remember that whole_thing about the ' giant sucking sound ? ' The increases in imports are impressive -- but the increases in exports are even more impressive. &quot; GATT ' s Main Points Here are the chief provisions of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord , which Congress will consider in a special_session next week : * TARIFFS : Reduce and equalize tariffs around the world but not eliminate them . * SCOPE : Expand the reach of the international trading system to make_it possible for companies involved in accounting , banking and advertising to do business around the globe . * COPYRIGHTS : Strengthen enforcement of copyright laws to provide protection for pharmaceutical companies . * SUBSIDIES : Cut agriculture subsidies so that the prices of produce in foreign markets are not kept so artificially low that U.S. goods seem overpriced . * REFEREE : Establish an international body , the World Trade Organization , with authority to regulate global commerce .</TEXT>
