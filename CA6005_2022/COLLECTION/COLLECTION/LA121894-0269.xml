   <HEADLINE> THE MAN WHO would n ' t GO_OUT ; FOR 20 YEARS , GERARD BRACH HAS OCCUPIED A WORLD SCARCELY LARGER THAN HIS ROOM -- THE PROLIFIC CENTER OF A SCREENRITER ' S UNIVERSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s an air of mystery about screenwriter Gerard Brach , and it makes just getting_to see him something of an event . He doesn ' t do power lunches , take meetings , or give interviews , as a rule . In fact , if you don ' t know someone in his inner_circle -- directors Jean-Jacques Annaud , Claude Berri , Roman Polanski -- forget it . You ' ll never find him . The mystery deepens when Brach opens the door to his Paris apartment and greets you with a cautious smile . He ' s about five feet four , spry . Dressed casually in a blue LaCoste sweater , purple sport_shirt and dark_blue slacks , he looks more like a prosperous businessman from Cleveland than the elusive legend of French film that he is . He ' s friendly and polite in an old fashioned way : He shakes your hand and bows slightly . Then , just when you feel at_ease , you catch his eyes . They are dark and honest and flood you with a torrent of conflicting emotions -- fear , humor , pain , happiness , flashes of terror , laughter , grief , a curious optimism . It ' s disconcerting , but then he cheerfully sits_down at his desk in a shaft of sunlight , offers you a chair and starts explaining the toys on his desk : a tray of small , neon-colored spinning_tops ; toy birds the size of baseballs that warble when you lift them up ; kaleidoscopes . &quot; It ' s fantastic for exciting my imagination , you know ? &quot; Brach , 67 , says in his heavily accented English . &quot; Because it ' s true , I never go_out of my flat . I stayed here , inside for seven years ; I don ' t even go_to the elevator during that time . . . . So these help me travel visually. &quot; The idea of staying inside for seven years may sound strange , but not in Brach ' s case . He ' s an agoraphobic , a person who suffers from a fear of open spaces . And his dread of such everyday events as a walk in the sun or lunch with friends has been so intense that it has kept him in bed for weeks at a time and indoors for most of the past 20 years . The illness descended on Brach like a black cloud out of nowhere in the early 1980s , and it has been known to make him break_out in a cold_sweat , shake and freeze in panic as soon as he steps outside . &quot; The first time this came_over me , I felt_like I had suddenly come_down with this strange disease , only I don ' t know what it is , &quot; Brach says . &quot; I am standing on a Paris street_corner when suddenly -- foo ! I cannot move , I cannot cross the street , I cannot do nothing . For one half hour I do not move. &quot; &quot; I ' m extremely sensitive to perspective , that is my problem , a big part of my problem , &quot; he adds . &quot; It just seems to take me , you know , sweep me away . One day years ago , I go_to the Eiffel Tower , walking underneath it . I look_up and I have this awful sensation of vertigo -- only in reverse . I felt_like I was being sucked_up ! Is strange , no ? &quot; His illness may have kept him inside , but it did not keep him from becoming one of the most remarkable screenwriters of our time . His first feature , &quot; River of Diamonds , &quot; came_out in 1962 , and since then 27 others have made_it to the screen , establishing his international reputation for non-verbal storytelling , brilliant images and extraordinary range -- from thrillers like &quot; Cul-de-Sac , &quot; one of his favorites , to lyrical adaptations of literary classics like &quot; Jean de Florette. &quot; He ' s perhaps best known as Roman Polanski ' s screenwriter -- or , as Brach likes to quip , &quot; Roman ' s idiot. &quot; They ' ve been as close as brothers ( and as different as night and day ) for nearly 34 years . They have also collaborated on 10 films -- including &quot; Repulsion , &quot; &quot; The Tenant , &quot; &quot; Tess &quot; and &quot; Bitter Moon. &quot; They have just finished their 11th , a version of &quot; Cinderella. &quot; Over the years , a Who ' s Who of European cinema -- Michelangelo Antonioni , Bertrand Blier , Ridley Scott , Roland Joffe -- has beaten a path to Brach ' s door . Brach ' s biggest success , however , has been with Annaud , 51 . Berri introduced them in 1977 and they have collaborated on four offbeat films : &quot; Quest_for Fire , &quot; a drama about prehistoric man ; &quot; The Name of the Rose , &quot; a mystery set_in the Middle_Ages , based on Umberto Eco ' s bestseller ; &quot; The Bear , &quot; the story of a bear_cub ' s emotional development , told from the cub ' s point_of_view , and &quot; The Lover , &quot; based on Marguerite Duras ' story of a young French girl ' s coming of_age in 1920s Indochina . Each of these films has grossed more_than $ 100 million worldwide , and they are not big-budget action pictures a la Spielberg ' s or Stallone ' s , but small , intimate dramas that are short on dialogue , long on visuals and connected by what Annaud calls &quot; our silk red ribbon &quot; : the quest_for humanity in a world that has lost all sense of what being human is . Right now , they are finishing a fifth project : an untitled epic set among Eskimos and whalers in 19th-Century Greenland . &quot; I get very moved when I think the films I have done with Jean-Jacques have been the most successful for me , &quot; Brach says . &quot; Emotions I write here , in this room , take_place in dark screening rooms and theaters in America , Argentina , South_America , China . It ' s a mysterious connection of human feelings . . . I wish I could know all_the people who see my movies. &quot; To understand the real achievement of the Brach-Annaud collaboration , it helps to know about &quot; la guerre , &quot; the war . that ' s what Annaud calls the 10-year battle he ' s waged ( along with Brach ' s wife , Elizabeth ) to get the man everyone calls Gee-rard outside . It hasn ' t been easy . &quot; I stopped trying to change him long ago , &quot; says his old friend Polanski . &quot; It ' s simply not worth it . We end_up arguing and I say , ' Look , Gerard , what is the problem ? &quot; But Annaud was different . He understood the enemy well . He suffered from agoraphobia himself in his 20s . He knew the terror , dread , and humiliation it brings . And that understanding helped him wage a savvy guerrilla campaign of quick lunches and occasional trips that eventually culminated in a now-legendary event in French film circles . &quot; I was shooting ' The Bear ' in the Dolomites , &quot; Annaud recalls . &quot; I was doing the scene where the big bear was confronting the_hunter . It was a very , very difficult scene . Then suddenly the walkie-talkie on my belt goes_off and it ' s my assistant calling , ' Urgent ! Urgent ! ' And I said , ' What is it ? ' And he said , ' Someone in Paris has seen Gerard in the street taking a taxi ! ' And I said , ' No , that is not possible. ' And my assistant said , ' Yes , we guarantee it . It was Gerard . With a suitcase . Someone saw him and just called us . It ' s that spectacular ! &quot; That memorable cab ride in the summer of 1987 marked the first time that Brach had stepped outside his Paris apartment alone in nearly seven years . And he has continued to improve . On good_days , he eats lunch at a beautiful little restaurant about 100 yards from his apartment . And he cannot thank Annaud enough . &quot; Jean-Jacques has been very , very compassionate with me , he understands me perfectly , &quot; Brach says . ' With many people this is impossible . They will say to me , ' What ' s with you ? You look well . Why don ' t you go outside ? You ' re joking , right ? ' &quot; It is the situation of every man who is_sick , &quot; Brach says . &quot; People who are_well cannot bear those who are_sick because the sick cut the beautiful ambience of -- I don ' t how to say it . It is like putting a crippled hand in a black leather glove on the table at a fine restaurant during dinner . It reminds people of their frailty . &quot; But not Jean-Jacques , &quot; Brach adds . &quot; He doesn ' t judge me because I do not go_out . He never judged me. &quot; * Brach ( pronounced Brahsh ) may be a reluctant interviewee -- this is his first ever for an American publication -- but once he gets going , he ' s hard to stop . He speaks initially in French , translated by Annaud and Elizabeth . But as the interview rolls_over several days , he becomes more at_ease , and shifts into English . He ' s a born storyteller , and thanks to the cable_television , the man who rarely leaves his Sixth Arrondissement apartment is an informed citizen of the world -- and a master channel surfer . He ' s also a huge fan of American_football , even though he ' s still not sure of all_the rules . &quot; It ' s very exciting for me , watching television in English , &quot; Brach says , his eyes taking_on the twinkling glow they get when he becomes intrigued . &quot; I understand maybe half the sentences -- and I love not understanding everything . Because for me , it is like a mystery , you know . I feel_like I am an explorer . I like these strange situations . They are very interesting to me. &quot; His office is standard writer ' s fare : a long monastery table ( order and abbey unknown ) dominates the room , facing a giant black television . Art books are everywhere : open and piled on his desk , stacked on the floor , spilling from two corner book shelves . Then you realize this is the living room -- or would be , but it ' s been converted into his office . The same is true with the dining_room , now Elizabeth ' s office , complete with computer , copy machine and fax . The entire apartment is immaculate , even pretty , with hardwood floors and quaint little balconies overlooking the street . But it seems customized to do one thing : turn_out scripts . &quot; For me , the only challenge each day is the challenge to fill a blank sheet_of_paper , &quot; Brach says matter-of-factly . &quot; It ' s a fight between the will of an action and the power of laziness . . . . And day after day , I wonder which one will win. &quot; Brach doesn ' t consider screenwriting so_much writing as a kind of poetry : creating a series of images , like stones across a pond , that lead the audience to a very specific , emotional place . His most successful films often linger as a single , haunting image , such_as Yves Montand as Cesar Soubeyran at the end of &quot; Manon of the Springs &quot; learning from a blind old_woman at twilight that he has inadvertently destroyed his own family . &quot; A lot of people don ' t understand his writing , &quot; Annaud says . &quot; They look_at something like ' Quest_for Fire ' and say ' How can there be a screenplay for that movie ! There was no dialogue ! ' So what ? When you read the screenplay , it reads like something you see . that ' s the key . When you read something Gerard writes , you see . &quot; Brach talks frankly about his agoraphobia , often in a dark , wry humor that puts his many quirks in an upbeat light . At times , his adventures , as described by him and his friends , take_on the surreal quality of a tale told by a Gabriel Garcia Marquez -- particularly his dealings with Annaud . &quot; I remember days when he would only go from his bed to the desk and back again , he was so frightened , &quot; Annaud says . &quot; When we were doing ' The Name of The Rose , ' he would just stay in his bedroom , in bed , wearing a stocking cap with a pom-pom on it . He would have_on these gloves and dark glasses and he would just be there , in bed writing. &quot; &quot; The strange story of Gerard Brach , &quot; Brach cackles . &quot; It is only very recently that he ' s accepted to have one of those , &quot; Annaud says , pointing to a channel changer on Brach ' s desk . &quot; Because he invented le baton de la television . Where is it ? &quot; Brach rummages around and eventually produces a long broom handle with a plastic claw attached at one end . &quot; I am the inventor of le baton de la television , &quot; Brach says , proudly displaying the contraption . &quot; For five years , I could not convince him to get a channel changer , &quot; Annaud says . &quot; We ' d be working , and every two seconds he was pushing the television_set , changing channels with that thing. &quot; &quot; Why not ! It is mine ! &quot; Brach says defensively . &quot; I ' ve heard that the Greeks or the people in Egypt claim to have invented it . But they did not -- I did ! &quot; Brach ' s main connection with the outside world is his striking wife , Elizabeth , a tall , lanky Laplander . She was born and raised in Finland , then came_to Paris in the 1960s to study art . She met Brach in 1969 at the Cafe de Flore , the legendary Left_Bank hangout , and they ' ve been together ever since . She ' s a combination wife , agent , secretary , typist , investment_banker , cook and translator . She speaks five languages . And over the years , they ' ve become a finely tuned production team . He ' s up and writing each day at 8 , filling_up blank sheets of white_paper with his neat printing . He stops around 1 and turns the work over to Elizabeth . She types it up , and it ' s ready for Brach when he sits_down to work the next day . There is no question the relationship has been challenging . They were married in 1980 in Gerard ' s bedroom . But the inconveniences pale compared to the admiration Elizabeth holds for her husband and his work . &quot; The thing about Gerard is , he is very easy with everyone -- the poor , the rich , it makes no difference to him , &quot; Elizabeth adds . &quot; I remember once , we went_out to a party full of extreme left-wing Communists . They were drinking wine in plastic bottles , eating off plastic plates , in this terrible apartment . That same night , we went_to a party thrown by some corporate guy who ran a big shoe company . He lived_on Avenue Foch . Everybody was wearing diamonds , and when we arrived they gave us champagne and caviar . We stayed a half hour at each party . For Gerard , it was absolutely no difference , no difference at all . For him , we are all suffering. &quot; * Brach has never sought professional treatment for his agoraphobia , but he suspects the illness is rooted in the traumas of his early life . He was born in Brittany and grew_up in extreme poverty in Paris . By 18 , he had contracted tuberculosis and landed in a sanitarium as a charity_case . He spent nearly five years there , undergoing brutal operations that eventually left him with just one lung . The mental agony was equally intense ; antibiotics were not readily available , and death was a regular event . &quot; It was just after the war , and there was a very strange collection of people at this place , &quot; Brach recalls . &quot; Communists , anti-Communists , members of the Resistance , deportees . We even had some people coming_in from the concentration_camps -- some Jews , some not . It was a fantastic school of pain. &quot; By the early 1950s , Brach had recovered and was working as a runner for Pierre Roustang , who would become a legendary producer of New Wave films . Brach did everything from movie publicity to bit acting , appearing as a studio photographer in &quot; Breathless , &quot; the 1959 cult classic made by his friend Jean-Luc Godard . But Brach was so poor at times he often slept_in production offices . Sometimes he would let himself be locked_in the offices so he would have a place to stay for the weekend . To kill his hunger until the offices reopened Monday morning , he ate baguettes laced with vinegar . To kill his loneliness , he randomly dialed_phone numbers , talking with anyone who picked_up . A brutal divorce in 1955 had not helped : His first wife left him and their son , Eric . All this made Brach a memorable character when he met Polanski in 1961 in Paris , when the two began writing together . &quot; He was always scared of something -- flying , driving , walking , swimming , the street , heights , &quot; Polanski says . &quot; I remember we were doing this story about a man who sold the Eiffel Tower , and I told Gerard we had to at least see the thing if we were going_to write_about it . So we went_over there , got_up to the first level -- just the first level -- and Gerard is shaking ! So I said , ' Let ' s go up. ' And he just said , ' No , no , no ! ' He was gripping the railing so hard his knuckles were white . It was incredible . No matter how much I badgered him , insulted him , screamed at him , he would not budge. &quot; Despite Brach ' s quirks , he and Polanski were inseparable during the 1960s -- they lived_in London , hung_out in Gstaad and in Cannes . Polanski ' s fast-lane lifestyle had little effect on Brach ' s increasingly fretful nature : He never learned to drive , swim or ski and had absolutely no desire to visit America because he ' s afraid to fly . Wherever Brach and Polanski went , Brach would often set_up shop in a bedroom , in bed , writing . By the time they finished &quot; The Tenant &quot; -- the macabre story of a man who moves_into a small Paris apartment and is driven insane by the specter of its former occupant -- Brach had vanished inside . He and Elizabeth were living_in a studio_apartment just off the Champs-Elysees . He only felt safe in bed , so that ' s where he stayed . His head got cold , so he wore a stocking cap . His eyes , ever sensitive to light , would act_up , so he donned dark , goggle-like sunglasses . His hands got cold , so he wore black leather gloves ; then they ' d get hot , so he ' d wear mittens filled with ice_cubes . &quot; For most of five years , Gerard worked in bed on this little lap table , &quot; Elizabeth says . &quot; The entire apartment was so small -- 20 meters square ! You couldn ' t set_up table to dine on ! So when someone would come_to work with Gerard , then stay for lunch , we would have to clear_off Gerard ' s little lap table and eat_on that . I can still see Ridley Scott hunched_over that table , eating soup , talking with Gerard. &quot; While Brach was moving away from the world , Annaud was busy traveling around it . He was born outside Paris and picked_up a love of film at the local cinema during Sunday matinees , and by 19 he was directing commercials . By 28 , he was one of Europe ' s best directors , with several hundred commercials under his belt , a pile of prizes , a farm in the Loiret , and a reputation for never being at the last phone_number he gave you . He was also completely miserable . He felt that he ' d sold_out . The prospect of making &quot; poetry out of yogurt , &quot; he says , precipitated a personal crisis . He , too , wound_up trapped inside his apartment . &quot; I had the same disease as Gerard , &quot; Annaud says . &quot; I hated myself . I put_on 20 pounds of fat around my hips and did not want to go outside . I grew a beard and refused to go_out any more . My first wife eventually left me . Only then did I start going_out again. &quot; Annaud ' s salvation turned_out to be film -- and a love of faraway places , inspired by his military stint in Cameroon , Africa . He combined both passions in his first feature_film , &quot; Black_and_White in_Color , &quot; a farce about French and German colonialists in Africa during World_War I . It won the 1976 Oscar for best foreign film . &quot; The first day we met with Jean-Jacques was in my studio_apartment , &quot; Brach recalls . &quot; This was during the time I was not coming_out at all . I was sitting in my bed , he was sitting on the floor , and it was evidently clear we immediately understood each other . Both of us got the same impression : that we could work together . And very quickly we discovered that we were fascinated by prehistory , and we knew a lot about it . &quot; On that same day we met , &quot; Brach adds , &quot; we decided to write a script from ( J.H. Rosny ' s ) book ' Quest_for Fire. ' &quot; Brach turned_out a brilliant 100-page screenplay that had no dialogue but read like a book full of prehistoric pictures . But no sooner did Annaud start filming than one producer after another began backing_out , each one misinterpreting the film ' s theme . The end came_on location in Canada when the ninth or 10th producer ( Annaud isn ' t sure ) refused to let him shoot the crucial scenes : those dealing with the invention of fire . Annaud quit . &quot; I was so_much in the middle of a nightmare , &quot; Annaud said . &quot; I called Gerard to tell him it was all_over , and he went absolutely crazy on me , saying I couldn ' t quit , we had worked too hard on this . And finally he said , ' Don ' t be stupid ! It ' s near the end . This is what you have worked for ! ' &quot; Annaud found yet another producer and finished the film . &quot; I was so down at the time , I know if Gerard had said ' Quit ' I would have . Instead , I went_on . And I think it ' s fair to say , had I not done this movie , my career would be very , very different. &quot; The trial by &quot; Fire &quot; helped the two men forge a deep friendship . Annaud would be flying in a helicopter , scouting locations in Greenland or British_Columbia , and would call Brach in his Paris apartment just to tell him about the terrain . Brach returned the favor by filling_in Annaud on what he was seeing on television . As their friendship bloomed , so , too , did their filmmaking . Brach ' s fertile imagination gave_rise to poetic images that Annaud not only understood but also had the technical ability to translate into film . Together , they found the courage to make films they had only dreamed of before . &quot; Jean-Jacques would say , ' What do you think , maybe we do a movie about the mythology of ancient Greece ? ' And I would be stunned -- I would say , ' Is possible ? ' And he would say , ' Yes , of course it is . Anything is possible. ' He allowed me to make films with images that had filled my imagination since my youth , images of adventures , dreams , open spaces. &quot; About this time , Annaud began working to get Brach out . His first objective was small -- dinner at a quaint restaurant 100 yards from Brach ' s apartment . It took more_than three months ( three months , 17 days and one night , according to Brach ) of constant cajoling and numerous broken dates before Annaud succeeded . But no sooner did Annaud , his wife , Laurence , Brach and Elizabeth sit_down to dinner than a fight broke_out , the only restaurant fight Annaud has ever seen . The event terrified everyone , except Brach . He was fascinated by the commotion and figured it was just part of going_out . They finished dinner , and he promptly returned home -- to stay inside . Undeterred , Annaud spent months persuading Brach to spend a weekend in the Loiret , at Annaud ' s country place , 90 minutes outside Paris . Brach finally agreed , and it turned_out to be an expedition . &quot; He would only travel with a small ice_chest filled with ice_cubes , an old-fashioned atomizer full of cologne_water , a bottle of camphor , &quot; Annaud says . &quot; And a fan ! He had this little Chinese fan he was always using then . &quot; I had to drive very , very slow , or else he became very nervous , &quot; Annaud says . &quot; When we finally arrived_at my place , he grabbed Elizabeth by the arm and said , ' Look ! So many leaves ! ' I will never forget that line -- it had been so_long since he had seen so many trees . &quot; I had one room in my house that was tiny and dark , and that ' s where he stayed for all three days , ' Annaud adds . ' He came_out twice -- to go_on a little boat in a nearby river and to swing in the back yard . He liked the swing. &quot; This trip was just the first skirmish in la guerre , but it culminated in Brach ' s now legendary solo cab ride in the summer of 1987 . The question , of course , is , where did he go ? On a trip ? To the zoo ? To see a friend ? Wherever it was , Brach isn ' t saying . He prefers to let the image speak_for itself : him , with suitcase , in a cab , in Paris , traveling . &quot; Gerard has many , many secrets , &quot; Annaud says with a sly smile . &quot; And some even I do not know. &quot; * It ' s just after 1:30 , and Brach is outside , on the street , leading Annaud , Elizabeth , and a_few friends to lunch . He walks stiffly , like a man who ' s been aboard ship on a long ocean voyage , but he ' s clearly in a good mood . He ' s whistling &quot; We Are the World. &quot; He looks smart in a dark-blue , smock-like jacket and could pass for an average Parisian -- until a large sidewalk grate comes_up . He hesitates for a second , discreetly steadies himself on a friend ' s arm and keeps walking . The restaurant is small and quaint , reminiscent_of a French country cottage , and Brach is greeted like a visiting dignitary . Waitresses take his coat and lead him to his favorite spot , a corner table . He sits in the corner seat , just under a large mirror , a gift from Brach to the restaurant owner , a longtime friend . A small postcard of &quot; The Lover &quot; is wedged in one corner of the frame . During the next few hours , Brach seems right at_home . It ' s only after awhile that you notice he tends to behave like a man atop a high ladder : He doesn ' t look_around much , just focuses_on what ' s right in front of him . But that doesn ' t dampen his current obsession : CNN anchor Bobbie Battista . &quot; I love Bobbie Battista ! &quot; he says with a glee in his eyes that seems to add a permanent exclamation_mark to the end of her name . &quot; I am fascinated by her like the bird by the snake . Who is the snake , who is the bird ? I don ' t know. &quot; &quot; You interview people in cinema , &quot; Elizabeth says , &quot; and most say , ' Ah , I am fascinated with Elizabeth Taylor , or Catherine Deneuve. ' But not Gerard . He ' s fascinated by Bobbie Battista ! And most people here don ' t even know who she is. &quot; On the way home , Brach seems a bit tired . He ' s walking more slowly , holding onto Elizabeth ' s arm . Then Annaud abruptly darts across the street to point_out a favorite bookshop . Brach freezes for a second , looks both ways like a groundhog coming_out of his hole , and scoots across the street . He makes_it with ease . A few minutes later , everyone is exchanging goodbys in front of Brach ' s apartment_building when he suddenly walks down to the corner , looks_up at the sun , and waves . He smiles , and for no reason at all , starts to laugh in the sunshine , a big full laugh that shakes his small , stocky frame . He then shrugs , says goodby to everyone , and heads back inside to work , whistling -- leaving only the strains of &quot; We Are the World &quot; behind .</TEXT>
