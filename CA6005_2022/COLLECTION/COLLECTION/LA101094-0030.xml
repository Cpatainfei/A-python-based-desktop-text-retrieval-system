   <HEADLINE> JACK SMITH : IN THE GREAT COSMIC SCHEME OF THINGS . . .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In wondering the other day about why we are here ( a subject plainly beyond my philosophical reach ) , I suggested that if God is infallible -- as_many of us believe -- why did he do such a bad job of it when he created humankind ? Why , I asked , did he create two sexes , and leave the procreation of the species to sexual_union , an arrangement that causes all kinds of trouble . I have received several letters scoffing at this question , some suggesting that I myself must have enjoyed that arrangement . &quot; You dangerously strolled into Abby ' s and Ann ' s domain this morning , &quot; writes Michele Yepiz . &quot; Sexual union is , to my mind , &quot; writes Frank Wentink , &quot; although I have been unable to indulge for some years because of the infirmities of old_age , still remembered as the most glorious of all sensations when indulged in by two persons who love each other . &quot; Obviously , &quot; he concedes , &quot; even people who don ' t love each other must find it so , judging from the large_number of illegitimate_children being born in these times . After reading your column for many years it is difficult for me to imagine you never enjoyed sex. &quot; Perish the thought . That is the trouble with sweeping philosophical statements . Yet that is exactly my point . If sex were not so enjoyable , it would not be so widely practiced , and the world would not be moving toward a dreadful population explosion . The Earth ' s population today is increasing at the rate of three persons per second , or about a quarter of a_million every day . That will be an increase of one billion by the year 2000 . Where are we going_to put us ? Supposing God had arranged that men and women did not produce children by having_sex , but by washing the dishes together ? Surely that would cut_down considerably on the birth_rate . Of course , we didn ' t have dishes until the species was several thousand years old , but surely God could have found some_other , less enjoyable way to procreate . Let me leave the question of why we are here for a moment to consider three other questions of cosmic consequence reported by the press in the past week . First , astronomers have discovered that the universe is only about half as old as_many of the oldest stars and galaxies it contains . That is a paradox . We have always thought the universe included everything . Every last particle . How can it be younger that some of its parts ? I ' ll leave that one to the astronomers . The second startling news_story was about the discovery of the missing link . For decades , scientists have been searching for the bones of a creature that links human_beings and the apes . Now they think they have found it in Ethiopia . It is only a handful of teeth and skull fragments , but they are about a_million years older than any other bones found in the human family_tree . &quot; This species , &quot; says Tim D . White , a paleontologist , &quot; is the oldest known link in the evolutionary chain that connected us to the common ancestor ( we share ) with the living African apes. &quot; Creationists who doubt Darwinian theory have always thrown &quot; the missing link &quot; at scientists who insist evolution is not theory , but fact . &quot; Where ' s the missing link ? &quot; they ' d say . Now , evidently , we have it . The third news_story , in the New York Times , is rather more disturbing . About a_billion years from now , it says , the sun ' s increasing brightness may evaporate Earth ' s water . Then , on its way to becoming a red star , the sun will burn its various gases , with periodic explosions . Finally , some 12.4 billion years after its birth , it will undergo the last of its spasmodic helium explosions . The dying sun will form &quot; a planetary_nebula , a small hot stellar remnant. &quot; &quot; Further cooling will leave the sun as a white_dwarf , &quot; the article says , &quot; consisting_of matter so dense that one cubic_inch would weigh about 10 tons . At the end of the trail the sun will become a black dwarf orbited by the cinders of its former planetary system , including the frozen remnant of the long lifeless Earth . There Earth will continue to spin , perhaps forever. &quot; I was discussing these matters at lunch with Herb Henrikson , a Caltech scientist , and asked him what he thought_about the inevitable end . He said he was reminded of the story about the little old_lady who was informed that all these dreadful things would happen in 12 billion years . &quot; Oh dear ! &quot; she exclaimed . &quot; In only 12 million years ! &quot; &quot; Twelve billion years , not million , &quot; she was informed . &quot; Thank God ! &quot; she said . As one of the scientists quoted by the New York Times said : &quot; Fortunately we still have lots and lots of time. &quot; To do what ? * Jack Smith ' s column is published Mondays .</TEXT>
