   <HEADLINE> CHINESE FIRM HELPS FIGHT PRODUCT KNOCKOFFS ; LAW : SERVICE FOCUSES ON PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY , A SORE SUBJECT BETWEEN U.S. , BEIJING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Mickey_Mouse returned to China last year to star in a monthly Walt Disney Co . comic_book , a Hong Kong private investigation team was_on hand to make_sure impostors didn ' t steal his limelight . IP Protect Services ( China ) Ltd. , China ' s first foreign-invested joint_venture specializing in protecting intellectual property , is helping Disney take a state publishing_house to court for using Mickey in a competing comic . IP Protect was set_up in July , 1993 , with a staff of Chinese lawyers and retired public_security officers . Maria Tam , IP Protect ' s vice_chairman and a former Hong Kong legislator , says the firm kept a low profile until it could &quot; bring a tiger back to the village. &quot; The timing is apt . On April 30 , Washington gave China 60 days to prove it was enforcing its laws against piracy of U.S. goods or face a six- to nine-month investigation on whether economic sanctions are needed to force China ' s hand . &quot; Although China has come a long way perfecting its legislation , enforcement leaves much to be desired , &quot; Tam said . &quot; The major obstacle is local protectionism , and perhaps a bit of corruption. &quot; IP Protect has gathered evidence for Disney to bring a case against a leading state publisher , the China Youth and Children ' s Publishing Corp . Disney is determined to prevent the massive tide of knockoffs that prompted it to pull_out of China in 1989 . &quot; I ' m sure the head of the publishing_house may scream and shout and go_to some senior government official , but law is law and China is really taking active steps to make people more aware , &quot; said Felix Fong , director of IP Protect . With its lack of trained lawyers and its local_governments on the make , China has become a haven for pirates fleeing tougher intellectual property regimes across Asia . Washington estimates violations cost U.S. companies $ 800 million a year in business . Fong says very little of that money makes its way into central government coffers and the &quot; piracy haven &quot; tag sabotages Beijing ' s long-term technology importing goals . Zhao Damou , IP Protect ' s chairman , says Vice Premier Li Lanqing gave the green_light for his Chinese legal consulting_firm to set_up the joint_venture and the central government is also helping it cut_through local protectionism . In March , IP Protect took two weeks to close_down a Guangdong factory that U.K. chemicals firm Burroughs-Welcome had requested be closed_down for making fake Hazeline soap two years earlier . There are no private investigation agencies in China . Government_departments have investigated piracy cases but are woefully understaffed , and the fines levied on prosecution have been pitifully low . In 1992 , Microsoft employed Hong Kong ' s Pinkerton Investigative Services to discover the source of hundreds of thousands of its holograms being exported from a Shenzhen university for use on pirated copies of its software . The workshop was raided but was only fined $ 23 # 000 . Now Microsoft is seeking $ 22 million in damages in an appeal that Washington is watching closely . &quot; Fines are low because China is a developing country and people ' s living standards are lower , &quot; Zhao said . Washington may_not be satisfied by that argument . The last probe by the United States into China ' s intellectual property_rights violations ended in January , 1992 , with Beijing narrowly avoiding $ 1.5 billion in sanctions .</TEXT>
