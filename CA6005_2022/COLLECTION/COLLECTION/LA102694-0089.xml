   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : HOCKEY_PLAYERS STRIKING_OUT FOR GREENER PATCHES OF ICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just as Pavlov had his dog , Gary Bettman had his hockey_players , and a theory to prove . Drop the puck , Prof . Bettman maintained , and hockey_players are at their happiest -- wide-eyed , panting , entirely captivated by the simple joy of chasing and fetching a small , round play toy . But stop the puck , Bettman hypothesized , and it won ' t take long before the players are reduced to drooling , quivering basket cases . One month ought to do_it . Take_away their paychecks , lock them out of their rinks , and the players are going_to break ranks . First by ones , then by twos and threes , they are certain to cave_in and cross and come_back to play . And so they have . They have crossed the Atlantic to play for professional teams actually playing games . Jari Kurri , Teemu Selanne and Esa Tikannen to Finland . Jaromir Jagr , Martin Straka and Frantisek Kucera to the Czech Republic . Dan Quinn and Calle Johansson to Switzerland . Robert Reichel and Josef Beranek to Germany . Patrik Carnback and , any day now , Tomas Sandstrom , Mats Sundin and Peter Forsberg to Sweden . Or they are planning to cross league affiliations . Alexei Yashin , runner-up for 1993-94 NHL rookie of the year , has jumped to Las Vegas of the IHL , a franchise that also has offered to provide sanctuary for wayward thug Marty McSorley . Two of Toronto ' s most prized Maple Leafs , Doug Gilmour and Dave Ellett , are presently mulling proposals from the IHL ' s Detroit Vipers and the CHL ' s Wichita Thunder . Or they are contemplating crossing the international_date_line . Former NHL defenseman Slava Fetisov is attempting to organize a Russian &quot; super team &quot; and barnstorm Europe , playing exhibitions against club teams . Might there be anyone in Switzerland interested in paying to see Pavel Bure , Sergei Fedorov and Alexander Mogilny skate on the same line ? In Germany ? In Orange County ? Such is the state of North_American major_league hockey , circa late October 1994 . The agony and the exodus . Financial hardship was supposed to be the sledgehammer in Bettman ' s toolbox -- bludgeon the players into submission was the basic strategy -- but Bettman and his NHL board of lemmings neglected two important details when they decided to lock the players out on Oct . 1 . 1 . They locked the players out , but they didn ' t shut them in . 2 . They forgot this was hockey and not baseball . On a global scale , baseball is a regional phenomenon . Big in Japan , yes . Huge in the States , well , once upon a time . Central_America . The Caribbean . Canada ' s a Johnny-come-lately . After that , career opportunities in baseball are rather limited . Venture south of the equator , or east of Manhattan , and it ' s pretty much all soccer fields , basketball_courts and bull rings . And hockey rinks . Jari Kurri has options Barry Bonds never dreamed of . Europe is teeming with professional hockey_leagues , with more_than a half-dozen NHLs of its own , all operating at_the_same_time of the year , all competing for the best available talent -- or eager to bring it back home . With so many Finns , Swedes , Czechs and Russians playing here -- amid unfamiliar surroundings , alongside teammates speaking a strange tongue -- the NHL lockout was a clarion call to phone home . What ' s to keep Carnback , a young Mighty Duck forward born and raised in Goteborg , Sweden , hanging_around in Anaheim while Bettman and Bob Goodenow refuse each other ' s phone_calls ? Especially when his old club team , V . Frolunda , can not only guarantee him ice time , but also regular paychecks , dinners with the family and a_few laughs with the old gang ? The Ducks ' counteroffer was a spot on the fourth line , maybe , provided the season resumes some time before next Easter . Fellow Swedes Sandstrom , Sundin and Forsberg are poised to book return flights , too , now that the Swedish league has decided to relax restrictions on signing stranded NHL players . Sweden had to do something , with all_the deutsche_marks being thrown around by the Germans , blatant opportunists that they are . German hockey has always trailed Scandinavia and Russia in reputation and prestige , and you know how the Germans hate that . For them , the NHL lockout is a chance for a quick-fix , and German clubs are rolling_out the short-term , open-ended , stay-as-long-as-you-like contracts for any goal-scoring winger hankering to sample each and every one of the top 35 beers of Germany . &quot; It ' s almost like keeping_up with the Joneses , &quot; says NHL player agent Jeff Solomon . So there go the Makelas and the Jagrs , to their safe European homes , with others undoubtedly to follow as Bettman holds press_conferences to announce he ' s whittling the regular season down to 80 games . . . and then 76 . . . and then 70 . . . and 60 . . . and 50 , if we ' re lucky . Now we know Bettman ' s game_plan , and a brilliant one it is . He and the Gang of 26 have taken the NHL -- an entirely functioning and flourishing athletic league -- and turned it into the MLS . Why hockey would want to borrow soccer ' s headaches is a mystery , but the owners have gone and done_it . Now we have two sports where the best players in this country , if they wish to play for reasonable pay , are forced to pack a duffel_bag and do so abroad . And what are we left with ? Hockey in the Winter_Olympics . You know , we can get_up for these foreign sports once every four years .</TEXT>
