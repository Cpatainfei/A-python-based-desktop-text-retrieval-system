   <HEADLINE> EAST ASIA ; MALAYSIAN STATE ROCKS TREND OF ONE-PARTY RULE ; BREAKAWAY PARTY ' S WIN IN SABAH IS NASTY SHOCK TO GOVERNMENT COALITION . PRIME_MINISTER HAD STAKED HIS PERSONAL PRESTIGE ON A VICTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The political trend in East Asia seems clearly headed toward the one-party state . Indonesia and Singapore are just two examples of countries under the authoritarian rule of single-party governments that promise the voters economic_growth and jobs instead of liberal democracy . China , Vietnam and even Myanmar are finding much that they like about this new political hybrid . Malaysia , another of Asia ' s fast-growing economies , seemed well down the road to a one-party state as well . The government is dominated by a coalition called the National Front , whose major component is the United Malays National Organization of Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammed . But an election last weekend in the northern Borneo state of Sabah has left the government ' s hopes of domination badly dented and has seriously embarrassed the prime_minister , who had staked his personal prestige on a victory . When the votes were finally counted , a local , ethnic-based political group called the United Sabah Party headed by Joseph Pairin Kitingan , the state ' s chief minister , had narrowly defeated the National Front , capturing 25 of the 48 seats in the state Assembly . National Front candidates captured the remaining 23 . Sabah joined Kelantan as the only two states in the country to fall to opposition parties , though the Islamic fundamentalist party now ruling Kelantan differed with Kuala Lumpur more over religion than politics . Malaysia has 13 states , each with its own state legislature and a chief minister who functions like an American governor . The federal_government is organized on British parliamentary lines . The United Sabah Party had once been a part of the National Front but pulled_out in 1990 in an act that Mahathir called a &quot; stab in the back. &quot; Since then , the federal_government has shown little mercy toward its political opponents in Sabah . In 1991 , Jeffrey Kitingan , brother of the chief minister , was detained without trial for treason under the country ' s Draconian security laws . He was never charged with a crime , but he was not released until just before the election . The chief minister himself was then charged with corruption for steering a $ 40 # 000 government contract to relatives , a relatively minor offense in a country where federal_officials are widely believed to skim_off billions from government contracts each year . But Joseph Pairin Kitingan was convicted and fined $ 270 , a penalty small enough under the law for him to remain in politics . During the recent campaign for the state legislature , the National Front showed just how much political muscle is available to a ruling party when it has a stranglehold on the federal_government . Not only did the entire federal Cabinet come_to the remote province to campaign , but the country ' s national television and national newspapers dropped any pretense at impartiality and devoted huge efforts to the National Front cause . In the closing days of the campaign , Mahathir provided a thinly veiled threat to the electorate : Support the National Front , or the impoverished state would be cut_off from much-needed development assistance . The National Front pledged to spend $ 260 million building schools and a university in Sabah . But the arm-twisting is what everyone remembered . In the end , the ethnic stew in Sabah proved stronger than politics . The United Sabah Party is supported mainly by Kadazans , the indigenous people in Sabah who are Christian , while Mahathir ' s party is Muslim . Mahathir also seemed to underestimate the voters ' concerns about preserving a separate political identity . States ' rights are so important in Sabah that travelers from peninsular Malaysia still have to pass_through the state ' s own immigration office . A Malaysian Surprise An opposition party ' s upset victory in the Malaysian state of Sabah has left the government ' s hope of domination badly dented and has seriously embarrassed Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammed . Sabah ' s population : 2 million Population of Malaysia : 20 million Sabah ' s size : 28 # 460 square_miles , about the same as South Carolina Government : Each of Malaysia ' s 13 state states has its own legislature and a chief minister who functions like an American governor . Sabah Ethnic Breakdown Ethnic Chinese : 20 % Christian : 40 % Muslim : 40 %</TEXT>
