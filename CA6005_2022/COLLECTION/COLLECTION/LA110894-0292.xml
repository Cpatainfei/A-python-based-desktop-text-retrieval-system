   <HEADLINE> REPUBLICAN HEAD OF GSA PLANS TO STAY ; GOVERNMENT : ORANGE COUNTY MAN ADMITS BREAKING RULES . BUT ETHICS CHARGES AGAINST HIM STEM FROM HIS EFFORTS TO CUT WASTE , HE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With allegations of ethics violations continuing to swirl around him , Roger W . Johnson says he is determined to stay_on as head of the General Services Administration , even stepping_up the changes he believes have caused him to be &quot; treated like a virus &quot; in the nation ' s capital . Johnson , former CEO of Western Digital Corp . in Irvine and the highest-ranking Republican in the Clinton_Administration , has repeatedly acknowledged he broke some government ethics rules since coming_to Washington in 1993 . But he has argued that the vigorous scrutiny given his actions has less to do with ethics than with derailing his attempts to reorganize a $ 60-billion agency long seen as the epitome of wasteful bureaucracy . &quot; All I can say to those narrow-minded few who want to stop us is that if they thought their sacred_cows were in_trouble over the past year and one half , then they don ' t know what trouble really is , &quot; an angry Johnson , 60 , said in an interview in his Washington , D.C. , office last week , awaiting the results of the second inspector_general ' s investigation launched since he took_over the post . Since coming_to Washington , Johnson has been accused by the news media and critics inside the troubled agency he inherited of using government mail and phones for personal use , of asking his government secretary to await the arrival of furniture being moved from his Laguna Beach_house to his Georgetown home and of using his government chauffeur for personal trips to the airport . On Monday , the Washington Post reported that he failed to inform the Office of Government Ethics when certain terms of his severance agreement with Western Digital changed . Although it appears no disclosure laws were violated , such has been the stuff of Page 1 news , leading Johnson to question whether public_service is worth all_the trouble . &quot; Here I am under the ethics cloud . I take that very personally . I have never done anything unethical in my life . I have certainly done things that are stupid . . . but where I come from , ( violating ) ethics involves some sort of intent. &quot; Johnson ' s office estimates he has saved the government nearly $ 2 billion by trimming the fat out of courthouse construction projects and reorganizing other GSA programs . But bigger news was made of his decision to repay the government $ 1 # 062 in questionable expenses , even though an inspector_general ' s inquiry concluded he owed just $ 73 . Johnson thought he had survived the turmoil last spring by making_peace with lawmakers his cost-cutting programs had offended . But enemies inside GSA have continued to assail him in a newsletter called &quot; Crosswind -- GSA News From a Democratic Perspective , &quot; which has called Johnson &quot; arrogant , cocky and stupid , &quot; and suggested he is &quot; a mole &quot; secretly raising money for Republican congressional candidates . Johnson and his aides attribute much of the anger to a renegade union official bent_on running Johnson back to Orange County . Johnson ' s experience may be testimony to how difficult it is for a powerful CEO to make the transition to public life . &quot; All these regulations cause the federal employee to do stupid things , &quot; he said . &quot; My secretary offers to go_home and wait for the furniture . In the alternative , I could have gone_home and the government would have let me sit there for the whole day . That , in my view , is dumb. &quot; * The intensive scrutiny has already led Johnson to hire an attorney -- veteran Washingtonian Albert Beveridge III . He now pays_for all trips to California -- even those that are business related -- out of his pocket and is using a personal credit_card to charge most phone_calls out of his office . &quot; I can ' t get_in the position of defending it , so I ' m just not going_to bother with it , &quot; he said . None of the violations have been serious enough to warrant Johnson ' s resignation in the eyes of the White_House , and President Clinton singled him out for &quot; a special word of thanks &quot; during a campaign stop last weekend in Anaheim .</TEXT>
