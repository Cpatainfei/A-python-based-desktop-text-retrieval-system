   <TEXT> Northern forces have closed_in on the port of Mukalla , a key southern stronghold , after consolidating their hold_on the Indian_Ocean coast that separates the city from the south ' s capital of Aden . Northern officials say the leader of the southern revolt is trapped in the Mukalla area.The claim has not been confirmed but was strengthened Sunday when a U.N. envoy who has been talking with both sides about a cease-fire flew to Mukalla . The battle for the port involved some of the closest ground combat seen so far in the nearly 6-week-old civil_war in Yemen , a poor nation of 14 million on the tip of the Arabian_Peninsula . Northern forces now control most of the 340 miles of shoreline from Meifa Hagr to Aden , the main stronghold of separatist leader Ali Salim Bidh , which has been besieged .</TEXT>
