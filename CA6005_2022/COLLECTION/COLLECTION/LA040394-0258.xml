   <HEADLINE> VALLEY PERSPECTIVE ; HATE CRIMES AGAINST ANYONE HURT EVERYONE ; 2 SCHOOLS SHOW COMMENDABLE RESPONSE TO ACTS OF PREJUDICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s a different way to view the victims of hate crimes in our region . Our source : the most recent set of statistics available from the Los Angeles County ' s Human Relations Commission . They show African Americans as hate crime victims , along with homosexual men . Jews have also suffered from hate crimes here , as have Arabs , Latinos , Anglos , Asians , lesbians , Protestants , females . And if you ' re feeling a little left out at this point , there was an &quot; other &quot; category for hate crime victims in the region that included other religions , other nationalities , other ethnic_groups , other shades of skin_color . Anyone can be a victim of a hate crime . We point this out because some folks find it easy to be cavalier about such matters , or utterly uninterested . As long as the hatred is directed against some_other and supposedly very different group and not your own , there is no reason to be concerned , right ? Wrong . Each new discovery of heinously racist literature , ethnically derogatory leaflets and religiously based vandalism ought to send a chill up your spine regardless of whether you are one of its intended targets . The moment we begin to countenance such ignorance and hatred through silence and indifference is the moment in which we allow hatred and ignorance to spread , perhaps far enough to ultimately include you . If that sounds silly , then remember the following quote : &quot; In Germany , they first came for the communists and I didn ' t speak_up because I wasn ' t a communist . Then they came for the Jews and I didn ' t speak_up because I wasn ' t a Jew . Then they came for the trade_unionists and I didn ' t speak_up because I wasn ' t a trade_unionist . Then they came for the Catholics and I didn ' t speak_up because I was a Protestant . Then they came for me . By that time , no one was left to speak up. &quot; The quote is from Martin Neimoller , a German Protestant minister who was a leader of the church ' s opposition to Adolph Hitler . Neimoller was imprisoned in Nazi concentration_camps from 1937 to 1945 . A poster with those words can be found in the office of Kay Shafer , the deputy district_attorney assigned to track hate crimes in the county . Folks like Shafer deal mainly with the criminality involved in such incidents , but there is more to do than that . An example can be found at Placerita Junior_High_School in Santa Clarita , which was recently the target of the largest distribution of hate literature in memory in northern Los Angeles County . After more_than 1 # 000 flyers containing derogatory remarks about Latinos and Jews were stuffed into student lockers during the week of March 20 , school officials decided to use the incident to launch discussions about racism , cultural diversity and tolerance . That week , Placerita teachers also began their lessons by using a program that shows students how to confront prejudice . &quot; Like anything else , you ask if you ' re going to give more attention to it by discussing the leaflets in class , &quot; said Placerita Principal Jim Tanner , who decided it was better to confront the_matter . &quot; We felt there was going_to be more good coming_out of it. &quot; Mayall Elementary School felt the same way -- and with good reason -- last October after vandals had twice defaced it with satanic symbols , swastikas and other images of gross religious intolerance . Rather than removing the vandalism before her students could see it , Principal Barbara Fuller had teachers escort their students past the messages of hate before holding discussions on racial and religious bias . Later , Fuller invited Shafer from the district_attorney ' s office and Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker from the Los Angeles Police_Department to discuss the vandalism . If every such incident was met with similar resolve , education , and discussion , it would do much to keep the scurrilous hate-mongers at_bay .</TEXT>
