   <HEADLINE> LITTLE_ROCK LAW ; THE ROSE FIRM PROUDLY SENT FOUR PARTNERS TO THE CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION -- AND IT ' S FACED DISASTER EVER SINCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A shift in fortune was signaled , as it so often is , by the most prosaic of events . The phone rang . Phillip Carroll , at 68 one of the grand patriarchs of Little_Rock ' s legal_community , was at_home on a midsummer_night in the affluent Heights neighborhood . He was the first to receive the news that would rock the rich , sheltered way_of_life enjoyed by partners at the Rose Law_Firm . Shortly after 10 p.m. , an old friend with close ties to the Clinton White_House , federal appellate Judge Richard Arnold , called to impart the incomprehensible . Vince was dead . A suicide . His body had been found in a park in Virginia . Carroll could barely breathe . Vince Foster . Carroll had been his mentor and confessor , godfather to his eldest son . Dead by his own hand . Minutes later , Rose partner George E . Campbell ' s phone rang . It was Ann Pincus , a Little_Rock native , wife of a Washington Post reporter and lifelong friend of Campbell ' s wife , Joan . Pincus had attended a Washington dinner_party for David Gergen during which the presidential counselor received an urgent call from the White_House with the awful news . It was July 20 , 1993 , and deputy White_House counsel Vincent W . Foster Jr. , 48 , once the soul and spine of the Rose Law_Firm , boyhood friend of the President and close confidant of former Rose partner Hillary Rodham Clinton , had apparently committed suicide with an antique . 38 Colt revolver in an isolated park overlooking the Potomac_River . Suddenly , the Washington-Little Rock nexus of lawyers and politicians went_into action . The news spread across the network like a cascading wave . William H . Kennedy III , now White_House associate counsel and former chief operating officer at Rose , quickly called several of his former colleagues at the firm . Trying to learn more about Foster ' s death , Carroll sought the Washington home number of Webster L . Hubbell , also a former senior partner at Rose and then the No . 3 official at the Justice_Department , who was in a key position to monitor the Foster investigation . Back in Washington , Foster ' s boss , White_House counsel Bernard W . Nussbaum , was searching Foster ' s modest office in the West Wing , looking_for a suicide note or a blackmail demand . &quot; Did he say anything ? &quot; a bewildered Nussbaum kept asking himself as he riffled through papers on Foster ' s desk . Nussbaum , the New Yorker who had made a fortune on Wall_Street in the 1980s putting_together corporate mergers , was out of his element when confronted with violent_death , and his amateurish handling of Foster ' s suicide deepened suspicions that the White_House was trying to conceal some hidden scandal involving the First Family . Not until six days later did a White_House lawyer find a torn-up suicide note in the bottom of Foster ' s briefcase . It hinted at dark conspiracies by the FBI , the media and Republicans to destroy the Clintons and everything they were trying to accomplish . Foster , in a restrained but anguished cry , wrote that he &quot; was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington . Here , ruining people is considered sport. &quot; It was the most traumatic , unfathomable and searing event of the Clinton presidency . Why was Foster -- whom the President described as the &quot; Rock_of_Gibraltar , &quot; the man once anointed to guide the Rose Law_Firm into the next century , the man people in_trouble turned_to for help -- dead at the pinnacle of his career ? That question remains unanswered . But what is clear is that in the wake of Foster ' s death , the prosperous and peaceful life of Little_Rock ' s Rose Law_Firm has been shattered . Foster ' s death has immersed the firm in the rapidly unraveling Whitewater scandal , a tale of Arkansas banking and real_estate deals gone_bad and the White_House ' s clumsy efforts to contain the continuing damage . It set_in_motion a series of events that subjected Rose ' s 59 lawyers to unaccustomed stress . That pressure now appears to threaten an implosion of the oldest law_firm west of the Mississippi . Already , the firm ' s response to the harsh glare of national scrutiny has turned_into an ugly internal blood bath . On March 14 , Hubbell resigned from his job at the Justice_Department amid charges that he improperly billed as much as $ 100 # 000 in personal_expenses to the firm while he was a partner . The Rose investigation of Hubbell was only tangential to the Whitewater probe , but &quot; It ' s Whitewater that created the climate , that gave the dissidents in the firm the opportunity to go_after Hubbell , &quot; observes one source close to Hubbell . There is bitter talk , especially among the younger generation of Rose attorneys now taking_control , of the tarnished legacy bequeathed them , and they are trying to distance themselves from Hillary Clinton and her departed cronies . In mid-March , Rose partners voted to file charges against Hubbell with the Arkansas Supreme Court ethics division . In the past year , Rose has become the favorite target of every conservative conspiracy theorist in America , assuming the secret-villain mantle once reserved for the Trilateral Commission . The firm has been portrayed by Clinton critics , most often in the Wall_Street Journal , as a secretive fortress at the center of political and economic life in Arkansas that has now extended its sinister influence into the highest reaches of the federal_government . Hubbell and Hillary , assisted by the aggressive but shadowy Kennedy and Foster , surreptitiously took_over the government to advance their hidden agenda of federal intervention into every cranny of American life , according to this view . The firm , playing_on its capital connections , added a tentacle by sending partner Allen W . Bird II to open a Washington office last fall , feeding the suspicions of the conspiracy theorists . The truth is more mundane but in some ways more profound . The lawyers of the Rose firm became entangled in the careers of the Clintons mainly by the accident of Foster ' s birth in Hope , Ark. , and by a rising politician ' s wife ' s need for a job in 1977 . But the lives of these 59 people have now become hostage to the consequences of the Clintons ' actions and to the President ' s past business dealings with a two-bit real_estate investor and S &amp; L operator named James B . McDougal . Of the four Rose partners who assumed major roles in Washington after Bill_Clinton ' s election , one is dead , a second has resigned , and a third , Kennedy , is under scrutiny for nonpayment of taxes for a nanny . The fourth , Hillary herself , is caught squarely in the middle of Whitewater , her effectiveness as an advocate for health_care reform and other legislative efforts increasingly in doubt . No one could have predicted when Rose hired Hillary Clinton that , 17 years later , the firm ' s reputation would be hanging by a thread , a 174-year-old institution facing oblivion because of a rotten little land deal . UNTIL THEN-GOV . BILL_CLINTON OF ARKANSAS ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDAcy for the presidency at the end of 1991 , the Rose Law_Firm was little known outside the region . The firm , whose partners only recently gave_up the Old_South style of seersucker suits and white buck shoes in summer , never recruited from farther away than Tennessee or Texas . While its ambitions were to be an important regional legal player , it never acquired the stature of larger and better-connected firms in Memphis , Houston and Dallas . Still , its partners enjoyed whatever luxuries Little_Rock had to offer -- gracious old homes or newer mini-mansions , the golf_course and large swimming_pool of the exclusive Country_Club of Little_Rock , expensive cars , civilized working hours and close association with the small circle of Arkansas leaders who wield true political and financial power . The Clinton candidacy brought national focus_on Rose because of Hillary ' s employment there , but it has not been the attention the firm would have wished . Beginning early in the campaign , Rose was the subject of hundreds of news_stories and dozens of rumors about potential conflicts_of_interest , the sale or purchase of political influence , and office intrigue . Inside Rose , the pressure has only gotten_worse in the months since Foster ' s death . At first , many tried to rally around Lisa Foster , Vince ' s widow , when she moved_back to their white-pillared home_in the Heights with her three children . But now , like barracudas in an overcrowded tank , Rose lawyers have begun to turn_on each other and their former colleagues . These were just the latest and most overt signs of the poisonous climate at Rose . Even longstanding friendships within the firm have been eroded by Whitewater . Senior Rose partners Herbert C . Rule III and W . Wilson Jones have practiced together for more_than 20 years and consider themselves the best of friends . But during a joint interview , Jones repeatedly interrupted whenever Rule drifted into a discussion of the effects of Whitewater on the firm . &quot; I thought we agreed we weren ' t going_to talk_about that , &quot; Jones upbraided Rule more_than once , his voice growing edgier each time . Asked later about the evident tension , Rule dismissed it as &quot; the bickering of an old married couple. &quot; Many in the firm grumble that the price the remaining lawyers are paying_for their association with the Clintons is far too high and the rewards far too low . True , another former Rose lawyer , Richard B . Steinkamp , has just found a home_in the Clinton_Administration , recently named general counsel of a new oversight board for federal mortgage financing agencies . Yet the White_House connection has done little for Rose ' s new Washington office ; the firm ' s name is now radioactive in a city where clients looking_for political pull don ' t like to read about their lawyers and lobbyists in lurid newspaper_headlines . Although the remaining partners are loath to express such a view publicly , in conversations one hears an undercurrent of resentment at the Clintons and their pals for robbing Rose of a lucrative obscurity , for bringing its lawyers ' integrity into question , for the loss of the beloved Foster . &quot; We rely heavily on our reputation , which until recently has been untarnished , &quot; says Chief Operating Officer Ronald M . Clark , weighing his words judiciously , trying to mask his bitterness at being forced to deal with insatiable federal authorities and prying media . &quot; Here we are defending stuff that took_place six or eight years ago and which most of us know absolutely nothing about . A lot of us here complain that when you speak_of ' the firm , ' you ' re talking_about an entity . But we ' re all individuals , and I knew_nothing about Whitewater . &quot; If this is our 15 minutes of fame , &quot; the 39-year-old tax specialist laments , &quot; I ' d just as soon it end. &quot; The tribulations of the Rose Law_Firm have caused few tears to be shed in the inbred legal_community of Little_Rock . Oh sure , there are the ritual expressions of sympathy for Foster ' s widow and the clucking of tongues over the breathless media coverage . But beneath a veneer of Southern manners there is barely disguised glee at the decline of a collection of lawyers whom many of their competitors consider arrogant , aloof and overrated . &quot; They ' re nothing special , just another Little_Rock law_firm with big pretensions , &quot; says one attorney in a small Little_Rock partnership . He adds that a lawyer will chide any colleague who grows full of himself by saying , &quot; Now don ' t go acting like a Rose firm lawyer. &quot; Legal competitors are quick to pounce on the latest allegation about Rose and brag about the cases they won or clients they stole from the powerhouse on East Fourth Street . Always on background , of course ; Little_Rock is a small_town , and it ' s not polite to cut_up your fellow country_club members on the record . But from the country_club locker_room to the barroom of the Capital Hotel , wherever Little_Rock ' s lawyers gather , Rose and Whitewater are the hottest topics . Rumors abound about who ' s been subpoenaed and what records have been shredded . Some of it is just politics , old enemies of the Clintons getting_even . Some is the old-fashioned delight in the misfortunes of the better-off ; the Rose firm traditionally was among Little_Rock ' s most profitable . In many ways , what the Rose firm is going_through today mirrors Foster ' s transformation last year , when he surrendered a privileged and private existence in Little_Rock to serve in Washington at the behest of the Clintons . After arriving_at the White_House , the taciturn and tightly wrapped Foster was quickly bombarded by crises of a sort he had never encountered in Little_Rock , from battles over controversial Clinton appointments to the botched firing of the White_House travel staff . He was painted as part of the insidious Rose cabal in Washington . He worked harder under more pressure and with more painful results than he ever had in Arkansas . A corporate litigator from a quiet Southern town who some former colleagues believe initially saw a White_House job as the answer to his midlife crisis and growing restiveness as a lawyer , was thrust into a political hurricane for which he was dramatically ill prepared . And whether because of these pressures , some unbearable secret or , as_many of his friends believe , an undiscovered medical event that triggered his suicidal depression , he snapped and ended his life six months to the day after Clinton was inaugurated . &quot; We have all been trying to understand what happened to Vince ever since , &quot; says Bird . Among the effects found in Foster ' s White_House office were a dim black-and-white photo of Foster and Bill_Clinton in kindergarten and a thin manila file_folder labeled &quot; Whitewater , &quot; which contained tax records and other documents relating to the Clintons ' Ozark Mountain real_estate deal . Nussbaum , considering it the personal legal business of the Clintons , forwarded it to their private attorney in Washington . When it was revealed that Nussbaum removed Whitewater-related papers from Foster ' s office while holding at_bay police_officers investigating the death , the political equivalent of hell broke_loose for the Clintons , raising the ugly specter of a White_House cover-up . That finally forced the White_House in January to accede_to the appointment of a special counsel , Robert B . Fiske Jr. , a veteran New York prosecutor who has set_up shop in Little_Rock . Rose falls_under Fiske ' s scrutiny because Hillary Clinton and the firm represented James McDougal ' s Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan in front of state regulators appointed by her husband in an attempt to shore_up the foundering thrift . Four years later , in an unrelated matter , Rose solicited legal business from federal regulators and was hired to sue Madison Guaranty ' s auditors for negligence ; that case has raised allegations of a conflict_of_interest because of Hillary ' s earlier representation of Madison . Rose partner Bird represented Hillary Clinton in a Whitewater-related land transaction . And Foster also acted_as the Clintons ' personal lawyer in dealing with Whitewater , at least in the later stages , and handled the 1992 sale of their share of the venture . There have also been hints , from Rose partners and federal investigators , that the firm ' s lawyers handled far more Whitewater transactions than have been publicly acknowledged . The firm first felt the effects of notoriety during the 1992 presidential race , when its most famous partner took a leave_of_absence to campaign for her husband . Rose hired security_guards after catching reporters pawing through their trash and snooping around their document storage facility . The firm also , for the first time , bought a shredder to destroy confidential documents . The attention during the campaign was nothing compared to the floodlights now shining on the firm . Its elegantly appointed offices -- which include a 60-foot basement swimming_pool , salvaged from the building ' s days as a YWCA -- have been visited by agents of the FBI , the Resolution Trust Corp. , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . and the Department_of_Justice . At least a dozen times a day , reporters from as far away as London and Australia call with questions about Whitewater and the Clintons . On a recent visit to the firm , a reporter observed half_a_dozen boxes of files relating to Whitewater being wheeled down the bird ' s-eye-maple-paneled hallways , being prepared_for submission under subpoena from Fiske . &quot; Not in my wildest dreams would I have imagined what has happened , &quot; says George Campbell , at 61 one of the firm ' s elder_statesmen . He contends that the Rose firm is &quot; an innocent bystander who happens to be around when politicians are slinging mud at each other. &quot; He believes that the firm ' s name and reputation will be vindicated , but the effects of the trauma will linger . &quot; If there ' s an insight I ' ve gained from all this , it ' s about the pain involved in national politics , &quot; Campbell says , sitting primly on a sofa in his office . &quot; There are people who spend every waking moment trying to tear somebody else down. &quot; NO ONE OUTSIDE ARKANsas ' legal_community would ever have heard of the Rose Law_Firm if Vince Foster had not walked into then-Chief Operating Officer C . Joseph Giroir Jr. ' s office one day in 1976 and urged him to hire a sharp young law professor he knew , 29-year-old Hillary Rodham . Rodham was then teaching at the University of Arkansas Law_School in Fayetteville , where Foster , an alumnus , often handled recruiting for the Rose firm . Hillary was moving to Little_Rock because her husband had just won the Democratic primary for state_attorney general . For Rose , it seemed like a fortuitous match ; Bill_Clinton was clearly on the way up in politics , and Hillary was going_with him . Giroir recalls that the firm , which at the time only hired two or three associates a year , was not trying to fill an opening . Rose just made a slot for Hillary . &quot; We had a policy that if we found someone we really wanted , we would go_after them , &quot; says Giroir . Today , partners refuse to voice regret at Hillary ' s hiring . Those who played a role say one of the only concerns expressed at the time was whether her marriage might force the firm to turn_away some state business because of potential conflicts_of_interest . Others worried that Little_Rock was not ready for a &quot; lady lawyer , &quot; particularly a feminist Northerner educated at Wellesley and Yale . Hillary was a liberal woman in a staid , Southern white-male-dominated firm that had been founded before Arkansas was granted statehood , a firm that did not hire its first black attorney until 1988 . ( It currently has none. ) Ultimately , she would bring high-profile politics into a corporate law_firm that shunned publicity . Hillary was naturally drawn to Vince Foster , then only 32 but already considered a major asset at the firm because of his legal skills and attention to detail . One of the leading civil trial_attorneys in the city , &quot; He won by following the rules , &quot; observes one former colleague . Older clients liked his discretion and his ability to cut_to the heart of a legal problem . Younger associates referred to him as &quot; Vince the Knife , &quot; for his legal acuity and for his cool , assassin-like manner that could wilt a witness or an underachieving associate . He developed a reputation within the firm for moodiness , temperamental behavior and even extended spells of silence . Former colleagues say that for one 18-month stretch , he refused to talk to his secretary . His austere demeanor could intimidate those around him . Kennedy , a recent hire at the firm , was transferred out of the litigation department because he and Foster , his supervisor , couldn ' t get_along , Rose sources say . The two later came_to terms as Kennedy , a Pine Bluff , Ark. , native , proved his worth by billing more hours than any other Rose lawyer for several consecutive years . Webb Hubbell , who followed Foster as managing editor of the University of Arkansas Law Review and joined the firm two years after his older friend , also became part of Rose ' s inner_circle . Hubbell was Foster ' s fun-loving opposite , a beefy former Arkansas Razorback lineman who was as outgoing as Foster was reserved . His minor football fame was a draw_in a state where the Hogs rule , but former associates say that Foster ' s brain and Kennedy ' s prodigious capacity for work brought_in a lot more revenue . ( Clinton , Hubbell and Kennedy all declined to be interviewed for this article. ) Hillary Clinton , meanwhile , consciously sought to keep her head down , shying_away_from highly visible cases that could raise questions about her relationship to the attorney_general who would later become governor . Little_Rock lawyers and reporters on the legal beat say that in her 15 years in the Rose firm ' s litigation section , she was seldom seen in court , preferring to find a way to settle disputes outside the glare of public pleading . One attorney who opposed her on a commercial matter in the late 1980s said that Hillary led him to believe that she wanted a trial , but on the eve of their court appearance she called to offer a settlement &quot; on very favorable terms to our side . &quot; She was very worried about a high-profile loss . She had to take politics into account on each matter , &quot; says the attorney , who worked_at Rose for several years and now is at another Little_Rock firm . He asked not to be identified because the Little_Rock local legal_community is so small . &quot; She was afraid to tie it up and go_to court . She ended_up settling most matters. &quot; Even her supporters at Rose say Clinton was less than a full-time lawyer , having to attend_to state business , service on corporate boards , political_campaigns and a variety of public advocacy pursuits . Her pay reflected her relatively modest contributions to the firm ' s bottom_line -- just over $ 100 # 000 a year when many of her contemporaries were making twice that or more . Her pay was also reduced because she did not take a share_in work done_by Rose on behalf of the state_government , mostly the handling of the sale of state bonds . She was missing so often that former Chief Operating Officer Giroir says she was often assigned to assist Foster . &quot; We couldn ' t give her a full load of cases because we were never sure she would be around to handle them , &quot; Giroir says . Indeed , in 1982 , Hillary Clinton had to turn_down Giroir ' s offer of a promotion to become administrative partner , which would have given her significant management duties in the firm ; she was interested in the post , but she was too busy that year helping her husband launch his bid to regain the governorship . Yet despite her efforts to keep a low profile , Hillary Clinton still entered into some business arrangements that gave_rise to potential conflicts . The firm developed its own ethics guidelines in the mid-1980s that were supposed to limit partners ' business dealings with firm clients , but those guidelines were apparently informal . Certainly Clinton didn ' t refrain_from mixing business and legal work . For example , she sat on the board of directors of two major Rose clients , TCBY Enterprises , the yogurt franchise , and Wal-Mart Stores . Her most serious potential conflict , of course , came from the fact that she represented Madison Guaranty at_the_same_time that she was in business with its chairman , James McDougal . Most troubling of all was that while she had other firm partners handle work for Whitewater , she apparently did not disclose her business_relationship with McDougal to the firm ' s COO . &quot; I never knew that she was in business with him , &quot; says Giroir . But there is no denying that her departure , along with those of Foster , Hubbell and Kennedy , took a heavy toll on the remaining partners . One legal competitor refers to the firm today , with its senior management gutted and its legal expertise and political connections sorely missed , as &quot; Home Alone III. &quot; A HUNDRED MILES OR SO north of Little_Rock , down the road from the Ozark village of Yellville , are the 240 acres of land along the White_River that the Clintons and James and Susan McDougal bought amid dreams of real_estate riches . Oddly , it was along this same river more_than 150 years ago that one of the founders of the Rose firm first brought the partnership into disrepute and caused its temporary demise . In 1832 , 12 years after forming the partnership that grew_into the Rose Law_Firm , Robert Crittenden decided that Little_Rock could not contain his ambitions . He tried to unseat the incumbent delegate from the Arkansas territory , Henry W . Conway , but the campaign deteriorated into a bitter exchange of insults and a challenge to a duel , which left Conway mortally wounded , Crittenden disgraced and the law partnership with Chester Ashley disbanded . The firm was re-established in 1837 -- without the trigger-happy Crittenden but with its political yearnings intact . Ashley went_on to the U.S. Senate , where he served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee . His new partner , George Watkins , later became chief_justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court . The firm adopted its current name in 1865 with the addition of noted jurist U.M. Rose , a founder and later president of the American Bar Assn . A &quot; Northerner &quot; from Kentucky who arrived in Arkansas on a Mississippi riverboat , he was a linguist , legal scholar and diplomat who was cited by Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter as an important early influence . Rose_family members were associated with the firm until the late 1940s . Over the years , the partnership was a breeding ground for Arkansas ' political and legal elite , producing six members of the state Supreme Court , dozens of state legislators and officers of the state bar association . But the past decade has been unquestionably one of the most traumatic periods in the firm ' s history . Just as the rise of Hillary Clinton and her colleagues increased the firm ' s political profile throughout the 1980s , Joseph Giroir sought to radically transform the firm ' s relationship with the Arkansas business_community . Giroir never quite fit the Rose image . A small , dapper man partial to flashy suits and custom-made shirts , he considered himself half businessman , half lawyer . Yet his vision of turning Rose into an entrepreneurial player in mergers and acquisitions throughout the region ultimately collided_with the firm ' s conservative traditions . &quot; The firm almost came_apart over Giroir , &quot; says one Rose partner . When Giroir ' s major lender , First South Savings &amp; Loan , was taken_over by regulators from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. , funding for his personal ventures suddenly dried_up . In 1986 , the agency not only cut_off Giroir ' s line_of_credit , it seized $ 12 million in assets he had put_up as loan collateral . &quot; I had no choice but to sue , &quot; Giroir says now . &quot; They had just about all my money. &quot; The problem was that Rose represented the FSLIC in other thrift cases -- a conflict_of_interest that became the central management issue for nearly two years . Finally , by early 1988 , Giroir resigned and set_up his own firm , taking with him some of the best young lawyers in Rose ' s profitable securities law department . More important , he took key clients with him , including corporate and personal legal work of Jackson Stephens , the patriarch of a family financial empire and arguably the most powerful figure in Arkansas . It has taken years for Rose to rebuild its securities business since Giroir ' s departure . Rose today is not Little_Rock ' s most political firm ; there are one or two rival powerhouse firms in town that have traditionally had closer ties to the state Legislature . Yet Rose still exerts influence through its heavyweight client base , which has remained intact during the current controversy , according to Rose lawyers . &quot; My clients almost never even mention it , except to sympathize and ask how we are doing , &quot; insists senior partner Wilson Jones . But the coming months will pose a stern test of client loyalty . By March , congressional Republicans were smelling blood and had forced the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . to reopen an investigation of whether Rose had a conflict_of_interest in its legal work involving Madison before state and federal regulators . &quot; Hillary Clinton and Rose got money going_in and got money going_out , &quot; charged Sen . Lauch Faircloth ( R-N.C. ) . The mysteries of the firm are slowly yielding to the persistence of the press and the pressure from Fiske , who is still in the opening stages of his inquiry into Whitewater . Stories detailing grand_jury testimony from former Rose couriers and clerks about shredded documents , potential conflicts_of_interest , shadowy real_estate deals and political connections blare almost daily from newspapers and TV reports . Rose partners are certain to be forced to testify before Fiske ' s grand_jury throughout the spring . Fiske ' s self-described mandate is to investigate , among other things , the death of Foster and the possible complicity of the Rose firm in fiscal and legal shenanigans involving McDougal ' s failed businesses and his relationship with the Clintons . Besieged with subpoenas and under intense media scrutiny , Rose has hired its own legal counsel , the giant Houston firm of Vinson &amp; Elkins , to represent it in possible federal prosecution . The firm ' s legal_fees could easily run_into hundreds of thousands of dollars . In a sign of the serious questions still surrounding Foster ' s violent_death , Fiske has named Roderick C . Lankler , former chief litigator in the New York district_attorney ' s office , to concentrate solely on the Foster suicide . And , of course , if any proof of shredding of Whitewater-related documents surfaces in grand_jury testimony , Rose attorneys will be facing obstruction of justice charges . Taken together , that ' s enough potential trouble to make almost any client think_twice . &quot; It ' s not the sort of reputation one would go searching for , &quot; sighs senior partner Herb Rule . Rose partners deny they are covering_up any scandal and deny their shredder has been working overtime to hide the truth about the Clintons and Whitewater . Former couriers at Rose have testified before a grand_jury in Little_Rock that they were asked by clerks to shred documents marked with Vincent Foster ' s name but have acknowledged that they don ' t believe any of the papers were related to Whitewater or Madison Guaranty . One sardonic Rose partner asks : &quot; Now , if we were really going_to shred documents about Madison and Whitewater , do you think we would do_it in the middle of the day and call_in the clerks and say , ' Hey , we ' re shredding the Madison files , can you help us ? &quot; ' Yet , deservedly or not , Rose is now smack in the middle of the hottest political scandal since the Iran-contra debacle . And suddenly , Rose of Little_Rock is the most famous law_firm in America -- for all_the wrong reasons .</TEXT>
