   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ; ' THREE STRIKES ' AND WE ' RE ALL OUT OF LUCK ; POLITICS : LOCAL IMPACT OF ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION SEEMS LIKE AN IRISH_STEW , BUT IT ' S TROUBLESOME ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WANT AN IRISH_WHISKEY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Perhaps it ' s a subconscious desire to extend St . Patrick ' s Day -- but the local impact of &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation ( designed to put repeat felons away more or less for life ) seems to me like a good Irish_stew . A wonderful variety of political vegetables contribute . Floating on the surface is an apparently substantial meat-and-potatoes response to Orange County ' s ( and the rest of the state ' s ) hunger for less crime . Yet consider that just two days before St . Patrick ' s Day , and about a week after &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation was signed into law , Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren announced that crimes reported to California police had taken a nose-dive last year . Even more remarkable : Reports of crimes to California police have been heading down for a decade , while victim surveys ( as opposed to reports of crime ) have shown American crime_rates slumping for more_than two decades . Near-unanimously , furthermore , criminologists doubt that &quot; three strikes &quot; will make a difference in the frequency even of the most violent of criminal offenses . Consider , they say , that we are not seeking to deter middle-aged guys with mortgages -- but instead asocial youth for whom a felony conviction puts at risk no such stake in society . And then there is the cost -- an onion strong enough to make grown-ups weep . Billions of dollars for prison construction are apparently needed in the next five to 10 years , and the billion or two annually that would be required to operate them would kick_in by decade ' s end ; and those dollars would come atop a corrections ' budget that ' s already the state ' s fastest-growing . ( Some of the weeping is from higher education , which most observers think will lose money to the prisons ' budget ) . Now let ' s add some political parsnips , turnips , carrots and leeks . Try term limits , tax anathema , base closures and political pork . Absolutely without impugning anybody ' s motives , we may note that this is the kind of politics least likely to be mistaken for statesmanship . It ' s benefit now , pay later , quite like deficit_spending in Washington . This crop of legislators will in many instances have departed Sacramento before the piper must be fully paid . Proposition 140 ' s term limits contribute that parsnip to our stew . Tax anathema turnips grow astonishingly well in Orange County , and , with few exceptions , both local leadership and Sacramento representatives are proud_of it . Because Californians , with Orange County in the vanguard , want new prisons without any increase in taxes to pay_for them , the money will have to be redirected from current state programs and services . When it is , look_for those whose favorite programs are cut_to show little sympathy when Orange County feels the pinch . Add now to the stew that fine Irish carrot , base closures . Recall that Irvine and Mission Viejo are not exactly crazy about the Musick Honor Farm , and that much political blood has been spilled_over the location of a new county jail . One might reasonably expect that Orange County would want someone else to host a state pen . Yet it ' s easy to imagine angry legislators from other counties taking delight in sticking a prison to Orange County , hotbed of pro-incarceration , anti-tax sentiment . There is little political cover , either . Our state legislators ( save one ) , like all_of our members of Congress , sit with the Republican minority , while Democrats hold the White_House . If a Democrat -- or a Pete Wilson too weakened , too inattentive , or unhappy with Orange County conservatives -- were to round_out the picture , the stage would be set for a local prison . Of course , it may_not happen . Other towns in the state may decide they want the steady source of jobs and wages that a prison brings . In that instance , the local losses to &quot; three strikes &quot; may be more nearly proportionate to losses in the rest of the state . Like 57 other counties , Orange would have fewer roads , fewer college_students , fewer opportunities for civil litigation ( as court congestion predictably grows ) , shorter rations for public_schools , poorer public health and more homeless . Three strikes and we ' re out , poorer alongside the rest of California , whether we ' re home to a state penitentiary or not . It ' s enough to make a man want not an Irish_stew , but an Irish_whiskey instead .</TEXT>
