   <HEADLINE> BILL BOYARSKY : CHOOSING THE JUDGE FOR THE SIMPSON TRIAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With all_of us waiting to see who ' s going_to be the judge in the O.J. Simpson trial , I ' ve been wondering what sort of person would be_best suited for such a high-pressure job . Gavel-to-gavel television coverage may make_it sound like a great assignment . It was for Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell , who presided over Simpson ' s preliminary hearing . She moved the proceedings along briskly and decisively . It was the judge -- not the contesting attorneys -- who found an important precedent to support the actions of police_detectives who initially entered the Simpson estate without a warrant . But history shows that judging a hot case such_as Simpson ' s , with the chance of making unpopular or incorrect calls , can hurt or even wreck a judicial career . * Los Angeles jurists still remember the story of late Superior_Court Judge Alfred Gitelson , who , in 1970 , ordered the Los Angeles schools to integrate . The same year , he was defeated in an election campaign where he was labeled the busing judge . Gitelson ' s defeat changed the ground_rules . Before , judicial reelection was just about automatic . Suddenly , frightened judges began mounting reelection campaigns , having to solicit contributions from attorneys . Another judge involved in school integration , Paul Egly , resigned from the bench rather than subject himself to the degrading process . Recall attempts , hate mail and death threats had persuaded him he would have faced a tough and miserable fight . And if anyone had forgotten Gitelson and Egly , there was the case of Judge Joyce A . Karlin to remind them . She was the judge who granted probation to a Korean American grocer who shot and killed a black teen-ager . After that decision she had to mount an expensive reelection campaign . The shock of the Gitelson defeat lingers , 24 years later . That was evident when I talked to Robert M . Mallano , the Superior_Court ' s presiding judge . &quot; We ' re aware of that , &quot; he said . &quot; If you ' re in some case where the public has a strong feeling as_to how it will come_out and people will be angry if it doesn ' t come_out the way they want , then it ' s kind of hard to ignore that situation . But , he added , &quot; You have to make the call you think is appropriate . . . . &quot; To do that , Mallano said , a judge can ' t be overly sensitive . &quot; You don ' t want someone with rabbit ears . You see on TV how you ' ve got a bunch of lawyers commenting , law professors . They second-guess every ruling. &quot; And the judge will have to be decisive . &quot; Lawyers were asked ( in a recent study ) what attribute they thought was most important in a judge . The majority said decisiveness . that ' s the nature of our role . . . . You can ' t stop the trial and do an hour ' s research every time there is an objection . You ' d never get done. &quot; * Even when a judge makes the popular decision , he can lose . UC Hastings Law_School Professor Joseph R . Grodin found that out when he was an associate justice on the same state Supreme Court headed by Chief_Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird . Bird , Grodin and Reynosa were recalled by voters after a campaign based on the court ' s overturning of most death_penalty cases that came_before it . Grodin told me Tuesday he had intended to affirm the death_penalty in some upcoming cases but was reluctant to do so because &quot; people would say I am doing that in_order to retain my seat. &quot; In the end , he voted to uphold it in a case . &quot; The opposition group held a press_conference and said : ' We told you he was an unprincipled guy. ' It would n ' t have mattered how I voted . . . . It takes a lot of stability and self-awareness for a judge to stay_on even keel. &quot; * Judge Mallano has given the job of choosing the Simpson trial_judge to Supervising Judge Cecil Mills . Mills turned_down a request for an interview . Instead , he referred me to an interview he ' d given_in May to Jean Guccione for California Lawyer magazine . When choosing a high-profile trial_judge , he said , &quot; you want to make_sure they are not going_to get rattled . And they have to remember little things , like not picking their noses . . . . The system is characterized by the one of us on the 6 o ' clock news. &quot; But as the stories of Gitelson , Egly , Karlin and Grodin show , deeper qualities will be needed . A court spokesperson said the trial_judge is expected to be picked from an elite panel of nine judges who handle long , high-profile criminal trials . They ' ve all felt the heat . I bet they won ' t all volunteer for this job .</TEXT>
