   <HEADLINE> EXPERTS BELIEVE THE GEOLOGICAL DECK MAY HAVE BEEN STACKED AGAINST THE WESTSIDE DURING THE QUAKE . COUPLED WITH OUTDATED ARCHITECTURE , SOME BUILDINGS DIDN ' T STAND A CHANCE. ; UNDERLYING CAUSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two weeks after the Northridge earthquake , nobody knows for_sure why structural damage was highly concentrated in parts of Santa Monica , Hollywood and West Los Angeles . But scientists , engineers and city officials cite a list of possible causes that can be summed_up by a variation on the old real_estate mantra : location , location , location . And , construction . Consider : * Located 12 to 15 miles south of Northridge , the Westside areas are as close as anywhere in the Los Angeles Basin to the epicenter of the quake , which whipped_through the ground in a north-south direction . * The Westside communities are perched atop relatively thin , weakly compacted layers of sand and gravel at the junction of flatlands and the_hills above Santa Monica and Hollywood , a zone more susceptible than most to geological trauma . * They are crossed by the Santa Monica and Hollywood faults , linked to a system that stretches west to Malibu . These faults did not move during the recent quake , but they may have focused some of the energy from the Northridge temblor . * Many of the area ' s 30- to 40-year-old apartment_buildings sit atop posts that rise from wide-open , ground-floor garages that offer little earthquake resistance . And a number of buildings dating_from the early years of the century are made of unreinforced brick . One suspect in the jolting -- the Santa Monica Fault -- was recently remapped by Caltech scientists , who traced its tracks from the green swards of the Los Angeles Country_Club to the beach at Potrero Canyon . One dramatic clue is the steep slope topped by the Los Angeles Mormon Temple in Westwood . With traces no more_than 100 feet wide at its eastern end , the fault generally follows Santa Monica Boulevard until the city boundary , then widens to 900 feet across as it angles northwest , according to a study by James F . Dolan and K.E. Sieh . They classified it as an active fault , based on signs of movement within the last 11 # 000 years . Earlier studies , which described a set of parallel north and south branches bracketing the path suggested by the Caltech geologists , said the fault was no more_than potentially active . One of three underground formations that could threaten Santa Monica and surrounding areas , it is the only one that actually lies within city_limits , underlying commercial streets and residential neighborhoods alike . &quot; Most of the city was built by the time they knew they had a fault , &quot; said Eldon M . Gath , a geologist who prepared a seismic safety update for the city in 1992 . If the fault does move , it could wreak havoc with emergency evacuation routes , sever gas and water_mains and threaten police , fire and medical_care facilities , the report found . &quot; The thing we stressed big-time ( in the seismic update ) was public education , &quot; Gath said . He said that official adoption of a fault hazard zone could pose economic problems for property_owners when they seek to sell or refinance their property . Still , he said , &quot; Let ' s get people aware that they ' re living in a hazardous zone , and let them be attuned to reinforcing older houses and apartment houses. &quot; Although many of the seismic report ' s conclusions were included in a master environmental assessment released by the city in September , the call_for a public information campaign was not . &quot; It ' s still under review , &quot; said Kate Vernez , a spokeswoman for the city . The Hollywood Fault might have played a similar role in_focusing the earthquake ' s energy toward the surface in Hollywood , geologists said . According to Thomas L . Henyey , executive_director of the Southern California Earthquake Center , the geology between the earthquake ' s epicenter and the damaged areas of Santa Monica and Hollywood was another likely factor . &quot; When you ' re on the edge of a basin . . . a lot of damage is often on the periphery , &quot; he said . &quot; Transitional zones between basins and mountains are often areas where ( seismic ) waves are amplified. &quot; Liquefaction -- a phenomenon in which seismic forces mix soil and water into an unstable soup -- was probably not to blame for the damage in Santa Monica or Hollywood . But the phenomenon was almost certainly to blame for the collapse of the freeway bridge across La Cienega Boulevard , Henyey said , noting that the street ' s very name means &quot; the swam &quot; in Spanish . The ground under the damage zones is largely made_up of sand and gravel deposited by ancient rivers , according to Caltech ' s Dolan , whose findings on the Santa Monica Fault were published in 1991 . Similar deposits underlie the area where a medical_building crumpled at Olympic Boulevard and Barrington Avenue , and parts of Hollywood , where the earthquake left 6 # 000 homeless and 257 buildings severely damaged . Washed_down from the Santa Monica Mountains and the Hollywood Hills , these so-called alluvial_deposits form fan shapes that are thinner at the base of the_hills . Given a good dose of seismic energy , they can transmit earthquake waves to the surface with disquieting speed . According to readings from a sensor at Santa Monica City_Hall , the Jan . 17 earthquake peaked with a horizontal jolt that amounted to 93 % of the force of gravity . Hollywood reported 41 % , while nearby Century City registered no more_than 27 % . &quot; It ' s not as_good_as rock but not as bad as swamp , &quot; Dolan said of the lightly compacted alluvial_deposits that are common to the Hollywood and Santa Monica quake-damage zones . &quot; We don ' t know a lot about why damage is localized . This is going_to be a very , very educational earthquake for us in those terms. &quot; Also cited as a likely cause of damage in northwest Santa Monica , experts say , was the type of construction used in buildings , in many cases post-supported apartment_houses dating_from the 1950s and ' 60s . &quot; The problem is that those buildings -- we refer to them as dingbats -- took the vertical load very well , but they were not necessarily braced for the horizontal load , &quot; said Joseph V . Pica , a Fairfax district architect . Such buildings fell_out of favor after the 1971 Sylmar quake . &quot; They didn ' t get regulated out of existence , but they became economically unfeasible as a result of earthquakes , &quot; he said . The hard-hit portion of Santa Monica also has a significant number of masonry buildings , held together by deteriorating sand-and-lime mortar and weakened by earlier quakes . &quot; Ten thousand years of experience with brick buildings shows they don ' t do_well in earthquakes , &quot; said Dolan , the Caltech geologist . Although Santa Monica once counted 224 potentially dangerous masonry buildings , only 94 remain to be retrofitted for earthquake safety , said William D . Rome , building officer for the city of Santa Monica . While no one was hurt by falling bricks , that was only because of the quake ' s early morning hour , he said . &quot; Reinforcing doesn ' t stop buildings from being damaged , that ' s a false image most of the public has , &quot; said Russell Barnard , a Main_Street property_owner and Building and Safety Commission member who was_active in the 12-year debate over seismic fixing . &quot; The difference is , the pieces that fall_off are not such huge chunks. &quot; One of the most heavily damaged brick structures was an old hotel , now used for retail space and offices , at 1337 3rd St . Splits run_up the front and huge holes let sunshine pour through the crooked side and back walls of the building , whose owners did not get_around_to retrofitting before Jan . 17 . Leasing agent Arist P . Niciforos , a member of the family that has owned the building since 1985 , said it was_due for retrofitting by October of this year . Located as it is in a prime location on the 3rd Street Promenade , the only alternative is to tear it down , Niciforos said . But Pamela O ' Connor , a historic-preservation professional who serves on the Planning_Commission , said the city should not rush to replace quake-damaged old buildings . Although she is especially concerned about the fate of damaged 1920s-era apartment_buildings north of Wilshire Boulevard , older buildings along the Promenade also have historic value , she said . &quot; Our immediate concern is that buildings get demolished and people view them as an imminent threat to public health and safety , &quot; she said . &quot; If these are important buildings to Santa Monica , you need to have a second look_at it. &quot; With city officials overwhelmed by the immediate task of post-quake recovery , the temblor ' s consequences for future construction remain unclear . But it is likely that anyone looking_for real_estate these days will have earthquakes in mind . &quot; Now , every space we look_at , we ' re asking , ' How ' s that going_to support us in case of an earthquake ? ' &quot; said Darren Chuckry , a tenant in Niciforos ' building . Times staff writer Nancy Hill-Holtzman contributed to this report .
