   <TEXT> Japan ' s political world reeled Friday from Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s bombshell announcement that he is resigning amid mounting questions about a suspect stock deal , a loan from a gangster-linked trucking_company and possible illegalities over the management of his personal finances . But even as supporters expressed shock that the man they lionized as the symbol of a new era of clean and open politics himself was felled by scandal , they say the political revolution Hosokawa started cannot be turned_back . As the fragile , eight-party coalition scrambled to find a successor and debated whether the unwieldy alliance itself could last , people ranging from executives to homemakers made one thing clear in interviews : They do not want a return to the closed network of shady deals and back-room politics symbolized by the Liberal Democratic Party ' s 38-year iron rule . &quot; Once big change starts , no one can stop it , like a rolling stone , &quot; said Yoshiko Hayakawa , a writer and political activist who has been working to break_open the old_boys ' network . &quot; The fresh_breeze brought by the coalition has to keep blowing -- at least , I really hope it does. &quot; So stunned , however , were the Japanese that politicians , pundits and analysts were slow to speculate who might succeed Hosokawa , who resigned abruptly early Friday , beleaguered by persistent controversies over his personal finances . The most attention seemed to focus_on Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata of the Renewal Party ; there also was a growing buzz about former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP . Both would-be candidates , however , have their own political liabilities ; Watanabe , for example , would have to bolt his current party to possibly become prime_minister . It was unclear exactly how long the intricate process for picking Japan ' s next political_leader might take . Possible Successors A recent poll by the Nihon Keizai newspaper showed that 42 % of respondents would still vote for a coalition candidate in an election held today , compared to 22 % for the LDP . Foreign Minister Hata was most often supported as the next prime_minister in the poll , and his name still heads the list of most likely successors to Hosokawa . Hata , the boyish-faced leader of the Renewal Party , is a close ally of Ichiro Ozawa , the brilliant policy strategist whom many view_as Japan ' s most dynamic political_leader . Hata would be likely to espouse many of Ozawa ' s proposals , which range from a 10 % consumption tax and an income_tax increase to stimulate the economy to greater participation of Japan ' s Self-Defense Forces in international peacekeeping operations . But rumors are mounting that Watanabe , the former foreign_minister , might bolt the Liberal Democrats to join the coalition with his followers -- possibly even heading it as prime_minister . Watanabe , blunt and colorful , would not be expected to espouse radical reform as an entrenched LDP insider but would bring the experience the coalition badly lacks . Whether the eclectic , increasingly unwieldy coalition , which ranges from leftist Socialists to conservative former LDP heavyweights , itself can last was much debated Friday . Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama urged that the coalition remain intact and select a new leader . But Koshiro Ishida of the Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party said partners must first agree on policies -- a remark that indicated a willingness to recast the coalition , perhaps to accommodate Watanabe and his group . But the choice of Hosokawa ' s successor may shatter the coalition . The Socialists , Renewal Party and Democratic Socialists oppose the choice of Hata . Some believe that the coalition may simply appoint a caretaker prime_minister and call an election after the 1994 budget is passed to seek the voters ' will . A successor may be named early next week , but it could take as long as a_few months . Once a successor is decided , the entire Cabinet would resign and a new prime_minister would be elected by the lower house of Parliament . Hosokawa , Reform The LDP rule was shattered last summer after the arrest of its kingpin , Shin Kanemaru , on tax_evasion charges . His arrest threw the party into chaos , led to renewed public disgust over corruption and thrust into power Hosokawa , a former governor and political aristocrat from the southern island of Kyushu . Hosokawa pledged sweeping political reforms and a new populism to bring government closer to the people . Despite his dynamic start , Hosokawa fumbled badly in the last two months , showing a marked inability to effectively deal with problems -- trade relations , especially with the United States ; a stubborn economic recession across Japan , and the growing conflicts within his shaky coalition . Critics faulted his relative inexperience ; supporters claimed that the fault belonged_to the coalition itself , whose excessive policy differences paralyzed government . Hosokawa is now likely to be relegated to the sidelines of Japan ' s political world . No postwar prime_minister has ever resumed office after resigning , and his Japan New Party is too small to merit significant political clout . He is not in danger of arrest , since the statute of limitations has passed for all_of the incidents in_question , including a suspect stock purchase of Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone shares_in 1986 and a $ 952 # 000 loan from the shady Sagawa Kyubin Co . that opponents argue might have been an illegal political donation . Hosokawa also said in his news_conference Friday that new revelations of possible illegalities regarding his personal finances had surfaced , but the incidents in_question occurred several years ago . Although Hosokawa declined to provide details pending completion of the investigation by his office , the Japanese press reported that money he lent to a friend might have been used in illegal loan-shark operations without his knowledge . A Political Legacy If Hosokawa ' s image as a clean and idealistic reformer is forever tarnished , however , his legacy as a symbol and catalyst for change is likely to last , people here say . Already , the populist politics he represented is starting to take_on a life of its own . As more people take an active interest in politics , they are tuning into political debate shows such_as the popular &quot; Sunday Project , &quot; whose ratings have increased more_than 10 % in the last several months . They also are snapping_up political books such_as Ozawa ' s &quot; Blueprint for a New Japan , &quot; making heavyweight policy tomes a surprising publishing trend . In the scramble to define their policies and images in the new era of personal politics , several politicians are now writing books with a bemusing variety of slogans : * Ozawa ' s &quot; normal nation , &quot; meaning a Japan that can properly assert its own national interests . * New Party Harbinger leader Masayoshi Takemura ' s &quot; a small but sparkling nation , &quot; meaning one that plays a more modest global role . * Former Finance_Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto ' s somewhat obtuse &quot; a nation proportionate to its height. &quot; &quot; Before , if you became the head of the top LDP faction you could become the prime_minister , so there wasn ' t much need to appeal_to the public directly , &quot; said Shigenobu Tamura , chief aide to Hashimoto , who says he now spends half his time on &quot; media tactics &quot; to get his boss ' s message out_to the public . &quot; Now you must be able to articulate policy . . . and those who can appeal_to the public are the ones who become top leaders , such_as ( LDP President Yohei ) Kono , &quot; Tamura said . To establish better contact with common voters , the once-lofty LDP is going_to such lengths as opening fax lines to solicit public_opinion and even holding matchmaking parties to lure young people . Populist politics made their first_appearance in a symbolic gubernatorial election last week in conservative Ishikawa prefecture , a coastal area known for lacquerware , industrial equipment and , until now , rock-solid support for the Liberal Democrats . In a close contest , voters rejected the LDP candidate and elected a deputy governor backed by the Hosokawa government after the coalition sponsored the area ' s first-ever town_hall meeting -- giving citizens a chance to air their views -- and participated in a local television debate . Some fear that the recently passed political reform bill will squelch the fledgling populism by centralizing power in the hands of party_bosses . But others say the public ' s expectations of a more open and responsive political_system raised by Hosokawa will not change . &quot; I think it ' s unfortunate that Mr. Hosokawa is resigning , because he ' s the best person in Japan to bring_about the new_wave of politics , &quot; said Minoru Omukai , a lacquerware seller in the wind-swept town of Wajima , who supported the coalition candidate in the Ishikawa governor ' s race . &quot; But the wave of change is advancing , and whoever succeeds him will have to follow it because this is what the people want. &quot; Toshio Kanekura , 52 , an executive with a plastics firm in Kawasaki near Tokyo , lamented Hosokawa ' s intent to resign . He said the LDP had no politician with the potential to change the system as Hosokawa did -- particularly to liberate business from the shackles of regulation that Kanekura believes are destroying Japan ' s competitive strength . Deregulation was one of Hosokawa ' s major pledges and political mantras . &quot; The LDP was involved in the iron triangle with industry and corrupt political donations , &quot; Kanekura said . &quot; But Japan is now in an era of change . As long as there are voters , we will not go_back to the old LDP ways. &quot; LDP President Kono admitted as much Friday . &quot; Support for the Liberal Democrats has been lower than support for the Hosokawa coalition , &quot; he said , acknowledging there was no public clamor for the party to return to power even though it successfully forced Hosokawa ' s resignation by relentlessly pressing him on his financial problems . Meanwhile , Hosokawa -- a man said to be obsessed with his own political legacy -- will undoubtedly leave a significant mark on history despite his brief , eight-month tenure , said Mitsuru Uchida , a Waseda University professor . Although his last two months were a study in policy paralysis , Hosokawa ushered_in the coalition government , oversaw the passage of a landmark political reform bill , presided over the opening of the rice market and issued the boldest apology yet for Japan ' s wartime aggression .
