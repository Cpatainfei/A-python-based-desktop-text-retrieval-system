   <HEADLINE> WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS , READ THE INSTRUCTIONS ; CONSUMERS : AN EXHIBITION OF USER MANUALS -- INCLUDING 600 VOLUMES ON BUILDING A PLANE -- HAS MANY YEARNING FOR SIMPLER TIMES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the technically challenged , solace can be found here . It ' s not a 12-step program to overcome the anxiety of wading through perplexing VCR instructions . Rather , it is the American debut of a Dutch user-manual exhibition that showcases more_than 800 confusing or downright strange examples of instructions for everything from condoms to German tanks . Anxiety , as the exhibition demonstrates , is feeling the ground shake and watching a mushroom_cloud develop in the distance while thumbing through a Cold War-era , Soviet nuclear-blast manual for using low-level radiation-resistant gas masks . No less confusing , but certainly of less consequence , are the 600 volumes in 48 feet of shelf space that attempt to explain how to build from scratch a Fokker 100 series airplane . &quot; Our modern life is getting more complicated every day , &quot; said the show ' s Dutch designer , Peter de Rooden . &quot; The need for clear and simple instruction is therefore more urgent than ever . This is the point of the exhibit. &quot; De Rooden , founder of the Art Project Foundation , a nonprofit organization in the_Netherlands , said it took more_than 10 years to gather the items that appear in 11 languages in the exhibition , housed through the end of May at the Fashion Institute of Technology ' s galleries in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea . Dorothy Twining Globus , museum curator at FIT , conceded that user manuals are a twist for a gallery that usually showcases fabric and clothing . One recent exhibition displayed ancient cloth used in mummifying a cat . &quot; FIT is_best known for its fashion design , &quot; she said . &quot; We hope to have more exhibits like this one that reflect the entire curriculum of the school. &quot; FIT offers a bachelor ' s degree in advertising design , with some course work devoted to user-manual writing . Although the exhibition is chock-full of convoluted instructions that might drive users mad , De Rooden insists that manual writers are usually unfairly branded as feeble-minded or evil . The real problem , De Rooden said , are the technical complexities introduced by computers , which have rendered obsolete the old &quot; slip Part A into Part B &quot; instructions . The result is all too often mounds of technical hieroglyphics . The 300-page manual for a 1990s Canon computer laser_printer , replete with industry jargon and confusing tables , dwarfs a more simple 40-page manual for the 1985 model and a 20-page version for a 1980 printer that even a child could understand . A manual for a Philips VCR remote includes a diagram that more closely resembles an electrical_engineer ' s schematic -- a centipede-like drawing with 88 straight and squiggly lines and circles identifying various functions . Ouilda Benitez , who took_in the show during her lunch break , hovered over 51 airplane emergency-evacuation procedure cards , about half of which have diagrams . &quot; I only understand the ones with pictures , &quot; she said , pointing to diagrams . &quot; Put the mask on your face , and when the plane hits the water slide_down the slide. &quot; Globus said the exhibition demonstrates the need for communication to transcend language and cultural barriers . &quot; There is no reason why instructions and manuals , particularly in the area of safety , aren ' t entirely universal in terms of the methods of communication , &quot; she said . Globus pointed to a display unit that had four symbols from four countries warning against transporting butane gas in the trunk of a car . Most entertaining is the display labeled &quot; Failures. &quot; &quot; Lighting will commence in the course of the evening dawn , &quot; one manual said about installing a light fixture . And what ' s the &quot; antecedent extinction of programme &quot; ? Another manual ' s dire warning against touching two wires together .</TEXT>
