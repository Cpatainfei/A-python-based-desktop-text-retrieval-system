   <HEADLINE> DOLLAR TUMBLES TO A RECORD LOW , THEN RECOVERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The beleaguered U.S. dollar tumbled to another record low against the surging Japanese yen early Monday before edging upward and restoring calm to worldwide currency markets . Yet , even as stability returned to agitated markets later Monday and the stock_market rallied , currency traders warned that the dollar ' s rough ride was not over , and a key Federal Reserve-watcher predicted a U.S. interest_rate hike next week . The dollar ' s dramatic tumble threatens nascent economic recoveries in Japan and Western Europe , economists said , raising expectations of new , concerted action to stabilize the world ' s volatile system of currencies . Indeed , the White_House acknowledged Monday that the dollar ' s travails will be_on the table when the world ' s seven leading industrial powers meet next week . &quot; It is our view . . . that further appreciation of the mark and yen would be counter-productive for global recovery , &quot; said a senior U.S. Treasury_Department official , who declined to be named , noting that America ' s major trading partners share the view . The Dow Jones industrial average jumped up 48.56 points Monday , as investors responded to growing calm in the currency markets . The dollar closed at 100.45 Japanese yen in New York trading , unchanged from Friday , and at 1.5835 German marks , down from 1.5840. An alliance of 17 nations loaded_up on dollars late last week in a failed bid to shore_up the dollar , which has been battered by the perception of weak U.S. leadership , a rising trade_deficit and prospects for faster growth overseas . But anticipation that there could be a currency-stabilizing accord at the G-7 meeting of industrial nations in Naples -- while speculative -- &quot; is a reason the dollar stopped tumbling today , &quot; said Irwin L . Kellner , chief economist at Chemical Banking Corp . in New York . Currency traders cannot rule_out that &quot; there just might be some big move &quot; to steady the dollar , yen and Western European currencies , he said . Another way to bolster the dollar is to raise interest_rates , making U.S. investments more attractive , even though some economists warn that such action could jeopardize an already slowing national recovery . On Monday , a key Fed-watcher predicted that an interest_rate hike was in_store when the Fed ' s Open Market Committee meets next week . Former Federal_Reserve governor Wayne Angell , a noted inflation hawk , predicted the Fed would hike its discount_rate -- the rate charged to member_banks -- by half a percentage_point . Now chief economist at Bear , Stearns &amp; Co . in New York , Angell cited investors ' fears of rising inflation as one of the reasons the dollar has slumped . &quot; I see it ( the rate hike ) coming as a result of a weak domestic dollar , &quot; Angell told Bloomberg Business News . The international scope of the currency problem was most obvious Monday in Japan , where the rising yen looms as a major threat to a fledgling recovery . A strengthening currency should push_up prices for a nation ' s products , thereby cutting_into exports , economic_theory suggests . But when the yen rose against the dollar in the 1980s , Japanese producers rewrote the textbook . Rather than hike prices , they accepted the pain of lower profits in_order to hold onto customers . They also cut costs and boosted productivity , but such strategies take time to implement and pay_off . The dollar lost more_than 40 % of its value against the yen in the late 1980s ; This year alone , it has fallen about 10 % against the yen and 9 % against the German mark . For now , at least , the stronger yen &quot; is going_to discourage new investment , &quot; predicts Michael J . Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Securities America . &quot; It ' s going_to reduce bonus payments to workers . It ' s going_to prevent rallies in their stock market. &quot; Widely overlooked in the dollar ' s recent decline is the extremely selective nature of the currency slide . The U.S. dollar actually has risen against the Canadian_dollar and Mexican_peso , its overall value increasing 15 % from 1992 , according to an analysis by Chemical Banking Corp . that factors_in the relative amount of U.S. trade with other countries . Nevertheless , the spectacle of a dollar plunging against the powerful currencies of Japan and Germany carries great weight among international investors . &quot; In terms of how the dollar is looked_at globally , it ' s never against Canada and Mexico , &quot; observed Robert A . White , senior_vice_president of Standard Chartered Bank , a London-based bank active in Asia and Africa . &quot; The problems that are afflicting the dollar have not gone away. &quot; These problems include perceptions of weak foreign_policy leadership in the United States and an incoherent trade_policy , economists said Monday . In addition , the resignation of Japanese Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata reduces the likelihood of a trade agreement with the United States anytime soon . On top of all that , a rapidly growing U.S. trade_deficit and expectations of faster economic_growth overseas may be reflected in the dollar ' s weakness . &quot; A large amount of selling is coming from European investors , where the sentiment against the dollar is very negative , &quot; explained Bernard Garra , head currency trader at Ruesch International in Washington . &quot; Over the last year the Europeans invested a lot in the dollar because the environment in Europe was poorer . Now a lot of them are coming_out of the dollar and into the deutsch mark because of the prospects of long-term growth in Germany. &quot; Some also believe the Clinton_Administration has not been persuasive in its declarations of support for the dollar -- reinforcing the view that U.S. officials see the decline as a useful way to put pressure on Japan . &quot; We still don ' t have a unified , forceful statement on behalf of the dollar by the U.S._government , &quot; said Gary Schlossberg , an economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco . In Asian trading early Monday , the dollar sank through the symbolic floor of 100 yen -- a floor that had held_up for decades until recently -- prompting furious yet futile moves by the Bank_of_Japan to stabilize the greenback . The Bank_of_Japan , intervening in the currency market , bought about $ 2 billion in a vain attempt to keep the dollar above 100 yen , Japanese media reported . The central_bank does not officially disclose details of its currency transactions . Still , the dollar closed at 99.93 yen in Tokyo trading . The dollar rebounded slightly early today , closing Tokyo ' s morning trading at 100.20 yen , up 0.27 yen from Monday ' s close . On Monday , the dollar rose somewhat in European and North_American trading to finish above its recent lows . Yet many traders are not convinced that countries , through their central_banks , have the means or determination to withstand the force of private speculators , who can bet many billions of dollars on the direction of a currency . Traders generally agreed that the test for the dollar is far from over . &quot; The trading community can ' t seem to get confident with the idea of the dollar going higher , &quot; said Glenn Cole , manager of Forex sales at Credit Suisse , New York .
