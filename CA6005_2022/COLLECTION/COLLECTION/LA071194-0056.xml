   <TEXT> They have been an annual fixture on the diplomatic calendar now for two decades , but for most people the Group of Seven summit conferences remain a little-understood blur -- a yearly photo op of the world ' s most powerful leaders , followed by turgid communiques of questionable impact . Despite this image and the enormous global change that has occurred since the leaders of the world ' s seven richest industrial democracies first convened in the_French chateau town of Rambouillet in the fall of 1975 , however , the G-7 summit tradition endures . It does so for two main reasons : It works , and the institution has been flexible enough to adapt to the changes that have swept the global landscape . Exactly how it works is often not easy to see , but those involved in the meetings , whether the leaders themselves or their aides , claim that breakthroughs on tough issues often come simply because they are forced to focus_on key problems as a group over a period that usually spans three days . &quot; The value of a summit like this is that discussions can be pursued over 2 1 / 2 days , &quot; German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said . &quot; Without the meeting last year in Tokyo , I ' m sure we would not have had a ( global trade ) agreement. &quot; That accord , which sweeps_away a vast array of international trade_barriers , is expected to add hundreds of billions of dollars to global wealth before the end of the century . British Prime_Minister John Major noted that the summits offer leaders the chance to discuss longer-range issues that invariably are pushed_aside by pressing problems during bilateral meetings -- issues such_as how to achieve ecologically sustainable economic_growth or adjust to the challenges raised by the explosion of new technology . This year ' s summit was viewed_as especially productive . Among its accomplishments , the meeting : * Provided the most visible evidence so far of Russia ' s gradual integration into the community of free , industrialized nations as President Boris N . Yeltsin was warmly welcomed to the political discussions that took_up much of the summit ' s final day . While Yeltsin did not join Saturday ' s session on economic issues , his presence Sunday effectively turned the G-7 into a G-8 for the first time in 20 years . * Allowed the leaders of the only nations with any chance to influence events in the Balkans -- the United States , Russia , Britain and France -- to coordinate a joint warning to all parties involved in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina to accept a recently presented peace plan that many view_as the last alternative to greater chaos . * Enabled the summit participants to consult directly on developments on the Korean_peninsula following the death of North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung . * Gave the leaders the necessary forum to confront diverse issues from making safe the highly dangerous set of nuclear_reactors still operating in Ukraine ' s Chernobyl complex to international crime and money-laundering . Such discussions frequently provide pressure to begin work_on solutions . But such achievements touch little on the economic debates that are supposed to be at the heart of the summits -- and go little beyond the level of discussion . The brainchild of then-French President Valery Giscard d ' Estaing and former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , the summits were conceived as an alternative to brief bilateral meetings , where leaders are usually steered through a choreographed formal program . The meetings , it was believed , would be a chance for leaders to gather for more_than a day and toss around ideas informally . The idea worked , with U.S. President Gerald Ford , at the initial summit , forging a previously elusive agreement with European leaders on measures to stabilize the dollar . But G-7 summits certainly have their shortcomings . Over the years , the summits have grown more elaborate . Larger delegations have accompanied their leaders , position papers have appeared and a growing news media army has given the summits the trappings of a circus . By mutual agreement , this year the leaders edged back toward more informal discussions and pledged to go_further in this direction when they meet next year in Halifax , Canada . Participants have also found many problems beyond their grasp . Can they affect currency-exchange problems ? Perhaps , but a senior Clinton_Administration official said traders themselves exert the greatest influence . Can they affect broader economic questions ? Perhaps , but a growing number of industrial powerhouses are missing , such_as Brazil , Indonesia and China . And as the leaders ended their meetings , this question remained : Had they done any more to make the global economic picture secure ? In the short run , the answer is no : Nothing was done to ease some of the United States ' most difficult economic problems . In the longer_run , the answer is less certain , but perhaps not as negative : While no concrete steps were taken , the leaders at least moved_into the politically sensitive area of the price that Europe ' s expensive social_welfare programs exact in job creation . While summits provide the kind of visibility that leaders love to turn_into political capital back home , they can also backfire . President Clinton came_to Naples juggling three key economic issues : the shrinking value of the dollar , the questions tied to the United States ' huge trade_deficit with Japan and a proposal to push ahead with trade liberalization even before the latest global trade agreement has been ratified . On each , he came_away empty-handed . While officials said the weekend was no time to expect significant progress on such intractable problems as the dollar and Japanese trade disputes , had the leaders been able to achieve real advances , they would have been happy to trumpet them . When they left Washington , Administration officials at every opportunity pointed to the strength of the U.S. position : an economy that is leading the rest of the summit nations out of recession , steady growth in employment , interest_rates climbing_up only marginally and no solid signs of a return of inflation . Such sound economic fundamentals , they suggested , would enhance Clinton ' s position of leadership among officials struggling with slower , less certain economic_growth and uncertainties about their political futures . But there was no sign that the President translated the sunnier U.S. economic picture into leadership in Naples . Indeed , his trade proposal -- and the way he presented it , without paving the way to avoid embarrassment -- was so quickly and roundly derided that he was forced to hastily withdraw it .</TEXT>
