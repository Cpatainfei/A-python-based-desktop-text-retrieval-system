   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; BRAZIL ' S TAFFAREL , JORGINHO : THE LONELY AND THE BRAVE ; SOCCER : GOALKEEPER BARELY NEEDS TO BE THERE , AND MIDFIELDER NEVER STOPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One runs a marathon every game . The other is not much more_than a spectator . One sweats so_much that that the field doesn ' t have to be watered after he plays . The other could set_up an hibachi on the penalty spot and not have to worry about having his barbecue disturbed . One will receive a $ 120 # 000 bonus if his team wins the World Cup . So will the other . Jorginho , Brazil ' s peripatetic defender , should demand a double share . Claudio Taffarel , Brazil ' s lonesome goalkeeper , should be thankful that he doesn ' t have to buy a ticket to the games . Jorginho is the hardest working_man on Brazil ' s defense . He also is the hardest working_man on Brazil ' s offense . From his position in the back , he wears a path down the right side of the field that looks_after a while like another sideline . At one moment , he has invaded the opponent ' s penalty area , lurking near the goal . At the next , he is stealing the ball in the midfield . Look again , and he is at the other end of the field , protecting Brazil ' s flank . When the game is finished , and the Brazilians have won again , it is their famous forwards , Romario and Bebeto , who invariably are asked to take the bows . But even though their teamwork in this tournament has been magnificent as they have gleefully assisted on each other ' s goals , they sometimes need a middle man . In the semifinal game Wednesday at the Rose Bowl against Sweden , it was Jorginho who played that role . After 80 minutes of futile attacking by the Brazilians , they finally broke_through when Bebeto directed a pass from the center of the field , just outside the penalty area , to Jorginho on the right . He crossed the ball in front of the goal to Romario , who headed it into the left side of the net . &quot; that ' s a play that we practice , &quot; Jorginho said later . &quot; We tried it several times today , but it didn ' t succeed . We never had the opportunity to get_it to Romario in that spot before because they ( the Swedish defenders ) were too tall . But he was in the perfect position this time. &quot; He did not say it , but it also was a perfect crossing pass . Sweden ' s goalkeeper , Thomas Ravelli , called it too &quot; hard and wicked &quot; for the defenders to handle . Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira spoke afterward of his team ' s supremacy , emphasizing their 26 shots and nine legitimate scoring opportunities , but that was the only time they converted in their 1-0 victory . &quot; I was not frustrated , but I was becoming impatient , &quot; Jorginho said . &quot; When you attack and attack and don ' t score , you press more . Then , you leave your end of the field open , and that is very dangerous. &quot; Dangerous is not a word that applied to the Swedes ' offense Wednesday . Taffarel faced only three shots , none from inside the penalty area , and if any of his stops were worthy of being called a save it might have been because he had to bend over once . That is not unusual . Before the semifinal , he had only eight saves in five games . When Brazil beat the United States in the second round , the third of his four shutouts , he faced only one shot , none after the 12th minute . He had similar experiences against Russia and Cameroon and even against the Dutch for a half before they fell_behind , 2-0 , and were forced to attack . During an exhibition before the World Cup , Brazilian reporters allegedly complained that they were not allowed by security_forces to interview Taffarel during a game . The story seemed ludicrous at the time . Not so now . What else does he have to do during a game ? Fearing the Brazilians ' awesome offense , teams tend to go_into a defensive shell against them . Those that don ' t find Brazil ' s underrated defense difficult to penetrate . Taffarel insisted Wednesday that he does not get bored . But , asked if he ever felt threatened Wednesday , he thought for a moment and said , &quot; No. &quot; On the day after games , Parreira makes practices optional for the starters . Taffarel usually goes , to get some work in scrimmages . On one recent morning , Jorginho also went . But not to scrimmage . He ran .</TEXT>
