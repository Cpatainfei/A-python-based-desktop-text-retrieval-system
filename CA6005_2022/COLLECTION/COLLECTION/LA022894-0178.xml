   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : OH , DEER , HE ' LL MISS THIS PLACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Well , everything about Norway and its people turned_out to be an absolute delight , including that 27th letter_of_the_alphabet of theirs that looks_like a NO SMOKING sign . What kind-hearted and generous individuals they are here , even if they do spell my first_name something like Mii &amp; ! % jkkke . I had not known what to expect , having read somewhere that Norwegians were frowners and scowlers who had a high rate of suicide . My perception of a Scandinavian has always been someone whose idea of a good time was watching Max von Sydow play chess with Death . Instead , what warm hospitality I found here in the North_Pole suburbs . I will miss these people , particularly the young_woman who asked me what sort of sports awaited me back home . When I told her that Dominique Wilkins was now living_in Los Angeles , she replied , &quot; Really ? Does she ski ? &quot; I will miss Norway ' s creatures , too . I will miss the reindeer . They have reindeer here like we have cats . There are reindeer here , reindeer there , reindeer everywhere . Reindeerkeep fallin ' on my head . I will miss moose . This is my first experience missing moose . Well , actually it ' s my second experience missing moose . Yesterday I missed one , but I was in a Volvo . I also will miss the king . I saw the king a lot . I saw the king at hockey , at skiing , at skating , at sledding and in a sleigh . I think I saw him in_line at the sno-cone counter once . This King Harald really gets_out of the castle a lot . I became a veteran Harald examiner . As for the Winter_Olympics themselves , they commenced with Tommy Moe in the snow , continued with Tonya Harding joining us in mid-show , then concluded with Alberto Tomba on_the_go . It was 16 days of Tommy , Tonya and Tomba . With a lot else in between , which we ' ll be bringing you next on CBS , right after these 99 trillion words from our sponsors . In hockey , Sweden defeated Canada , either in a shootout , with a penalty shot or in an Ugliest Uniform tiebreaker , I forget . Sweden ' s hockey uniforms were yellow . They should have gotten two minutes for clashing . In biathlon , the guys with guns defeated the guys without guns , 3-2 . In bobsled , Americans were asked to take their sled , Rosebud I , and stop shoving it . It seems somebody put illegal runners on the bottom of the sled -- possibly those Ginsu runners you ' ve heard so_much about . In luge , Italians and Germans were the winners and Americans were the lugers . In speedskating , Bonnie Blair brought her big family from south of Chicago , da Blairs . She won again and again , winning_over everyone with her ability , her durability , her dedication , her work ethic and her wonderful person-next-door quality . In speedskating , the sequel , Dan Jansen skated the lap we ' ve all been waiting for , a victory lap . In speedskating , the final chapter , one Johann Olav Koss , the Nordic Air Jordan , won races , won money and won respect around the world for donating every penny of his prize to Olympic Aid for Bosnian relief . In skiing , Sports Illustrated ' s Olympic preview issue reported that the U.S. team would have difficulty beating Switzerland ' s cows , much less Austria ' s skiers . Sports Illustrated is_better with issues in which people wear fewer clothes . In cross-country_skiing , somebody passed a tree , then another tree , then another tree . And in figure_skating , uh , let ' s see , figure_skating , figure_skating , uh , did they have figure_skating ? I can ' t seem to . . . Oh , yeah . Now I remember . In the men ' s competition , Brian Boitano came_out of retirement long enough to wish that he hadn ' t come_out of retirement . Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean ice-danced the most superb , beautiful , skillful , tasteful , seamless routine that ever got judged third-best . ( You were golden in my book , you two. ) And barely-old-enough-to-drive Oksana Baiul overcame obstacles galore and Nancy Kerrigan ' s brilliance to win the women ' s gold with effort and grace . Ya got guts , kid . But watch_out for Michelle Kwan next time . In other news Sunday , Kerrigan and Harding said absolutely nothing . I leave you now with two last thoughts . One , Lillehammer has been nominated to possibly host these Olympics again in the 21st Century , and , by all means , it should . Norway , hooray . And two , if you really want to feel old , at the 2002 Olympics , Michelle Kwan will be 21 .</TEXT>
