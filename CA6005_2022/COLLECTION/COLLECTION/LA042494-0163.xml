   <HEADLINE> ASIANS SEE BRIGHT NUCLEAR FUTURE ; ECONOMY : DEMAND FOR NEW POWER SOURCES APPEARS TO PREVAIL OVER ENVIRONMENTAL WORRIES AND SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS , WHICH OFTEN STALL CONSTRUCTION ELSEWHERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nuclear power_plants , increasingly rejected in the West , have a brighter future in booming Asian_countries with energy shortages . The demand for continued growth appears to prevail over safety considerations and worries of environmentalists , which often stall construction of nuclear plants elsewhere . &quot; I think expansion of the economy is a consistent thread with the whole of Asia . . . for expanding nuclear_power , &quot; said Mary Acland-Hood of the Uranium Institute , a trade group in London that represents 80 companies in 20 countries . Energy demand in the region is expected to increase by 12 % annually in the 1990s compared to 7 % in the previous decade , according to the International Finance Corp. , the private sector arm of the World_Bank . Many countries -- notably India , Indonesia , Pakistan and Thailand -- will have shortages in the next century ranging up_to 25 % of present supply , said Shehzad Shadiq , director of energy and industry for the Asian Development Bank . While dozens of nuclear plants are planned for Asia , there is a de_facto moratorium on new ones in North_America , South_America and Europe . France is the exception . It gets 75 % of its electricity from 56 nuclear_power stations , and the_French expect their technology to play a big role in meeting Asia ' s energy needs . Pakistan has reopened talks with France on building a second nuclear plant , Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto announced in November . &quot; The nuclear_power plant shall be the best example of French-Pak friendship , &quot; she said . The two countries reached a tentative agreement on the installation in 1990 , when Bhutto was serving her first term , but the project stalled when she was ousted later that year . She was returned to power in October . Pakistan ' s first nuclear plant is in Karachi , a southern port city . In China , the_French nuclear builder Framatome is helping complete two 900-megawatt reactors at Daya Bay , near Hong Kong , that are scheduled to be running in 1994 . Beijing recently announced plans to develop a major nuclear_power industry by 2000 , including the manufacture and export of 1 # 200-megawatt generators . &quot; Nuclear industry and technology are a yardstick for measuring the overall strength of a country , &quot; said Jiang Xinxiong , head of China National Nuclear Corp . He was quoted by Xinhua , the official Chinese news_agency , as saying &quot; a network of nuclear_power plants and nuclear fuel factories &quot; would provide the country with &quot; a pillar for its international standing. &quot; Indonesian officials say nuclear_power is needed , along with other sources of electricity , to sustain economic_growth . They insist there will be no safety or environmental problems . Critics contend that building reactors on Java , an island known for earthquakes and volcanoes , risks disaster . Greenpeace , the international environmental group , said Indonesia &quot; could be headed for another Chernobyl. &quot; The explosion and fire in April , 1986 , at the Chernobyl power_plant in Ukraine was the world ' s worst commercial nuclear accident . President Suharto said at the time : &quot; With careful planning we should not have to worry too_much about such a risk. &quot; Indonesia ' s first 600-megawatt plant , powered by uranium from Australia , is supposed to be operating in 2003 . It is to be built near a dormant volcano in central Java , 280 miles east of Jakarta . Provisional plans call_for 12 plants in Indonesia by 2015 . Elsewhere in Asia , the picture is mixed . Japan has 45 plants with a capacity of 35 # 000 megawatts and plans to increase that to 75 # 000 megawatts . Japan turned_to the atom after the oil shock of 1973 sent prices soaring . Korea and Taiwan also have expansion plans . Thailand is considering a 1 # 000-megawatt nuclear plant that could help meet the increased demand for power by 2006 , said Subhin Panyamag of the state-run electric utility . In Malaysia , said Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohamad , &quot; There will be no nuclear plant until we have exhausted all other methods to generate electricity. &quot; Malaysia now depends_on hydroelectric power , natural_gas , fuel_oil and coal . The Philippines might convert a $ 2.2-billion nuclear_power station built by Westinghouse into a conventional facility , officials said after apparently failing to settle a decade-long dispute . The 620-megawatt plant was never operated because of safety concerns and allegations that Westinghouse bribed the late President Ferdinand Marcos to win the contract . Suppliers of nuclear plants see a bright future . &quot; The Asia-Pacific region has the greatest market potential in the next decade , &quot; Woodrow Williams of GE Nuclear Energy told a conference in Singapore . &quot; We are talking in terms of $ 160 billion over the next 15 years. &quot;</TEXT>
