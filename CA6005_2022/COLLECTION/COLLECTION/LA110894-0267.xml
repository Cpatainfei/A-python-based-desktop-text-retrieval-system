   <HEADLINE> HARBORING GREAT DREAMS ; TRADE : THE PORT OF HUENEME IS DINKY NEXT TO MEGA-PORTS IN LOS ANGELES AND LONG_BEACH , BUT IT ' S GROWING NICELY THANKS TO A FOCUS_ON FRESH FRUIT AND AUTOS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , the tiny Port of Hueneme tried to persuade Cool Carriers , a Swedish shipping concern that hauls Sunkist Growers ' fruit overseas , to use its docks . For years , Cool Carriers said no . The line had comfortably berthed at the Port of Long_Beach , the biggest port on the West Coast , for 22 years . Besides , Gerry Fountain , president of Cool Carriers USA Inc. , thought the Port of Hueneme was just too small . But Port of Hueneme executives &quot; never let_go , &quot; Fountain said . &quot; They continually came_after me . They showed me they could do it. &quot; So Cool Carriers switched its Sunkist shipping business to Hueneme last December . Mainly what the Port of Hueneme did is build an $ 11-million dockside refrigeration facility for Cool Carriers . The warehouse -- the largest and most modern of its kind on the West Coast , port officials boast -- keeps Sunkist citrus_fruit fresh while awaiting shipment overseas . that ' s a crucial competitive and marketing advantage for Sunkist ; at Long_Beach , the oranges would sit_up to four days in open-air sheds . Fountain had asked_for a new storage facility at the Port of Long_Beach , but couldn ' t strike a deal . Recently , Cool Carriers brought_back former Hueneme customer Turbana Corp. , which uses the new warehouse to store its own imported bananas . The Hueneme port also receives bananas and melons for Del Monte Foods , a longtime customer , and to keep Del Monte happy the port is lending the money to build another $ 3-million refrigerated facility to be finished next summer . To be sure , the 54-year-old Port of Hueneme , with its 70 acres and five berths nestled next to a Navy facility , is still a lily pond compared with the mighty expanses of the Los Angeles and Long_Beach ports . But Hueneme is the only deep water port between San Francisco and Los Angeles , and in its fiscal_year ended June 30 it handled 790 # 700 revenue tons of cargo , up 26 % from the year before . But that ' s dinky compared with the 83 million metric revenue tons at Long_Beach in fiscal 1994 and 65 million at Los Angeles . Small as it is , Hueneme isn ' t the smallest of the state ' s 20 ports -- those in Redwood City , Alameda and Eureka are even tinier . But for decades the port here languished , bound by its small acreage and its location in laid-back Ventura County . Meanwhile , those in Los Angeles and Long_Beach grew_into giants , thanks to the booming Los Angeles metropolitan area , access to rail_lines and investments in equipment and facilities needed by big shipping lines . Nonetheless , the Port of Hueneme ' s pond is filling_up nicely with its successful specialty in fresh fruit and autos . The amount of cargo passing_through has increased by a third over the past decade , and its operating revenues are expected to grow to a record $ 6.1 million in the current fiscal_year , up from $ 4 million in fiscal 1990 . The port consistently reports a surplus over its annual budget and has been paying_off debt early . In a recently released report , the Port of Hueneme estimated that it directly or indirectly generated $ 275 million in sales and 2 # 553 jobs in Ventura County . Credit for the once-sleepy port ' s awakening goes largely to Anthony Taormina , the aggressive executive_director of the Oxnard Harbor District , which owns and runs the port . A former Port of San Francisco deputy director of planning and research , Taormina moved south in 1985 to run , figuratively speaking , his own ship , and he is now paid an annual salary of $ 99 # 960 . Taormina saw that the mega-ports in Los Angeles and Long_Beach were concentrating increasingly on the flourishing containerized cargo trade -- which includes everything from shoes to VCRs that is shipped in 20-foot or 40-foot metal boxes . Long_Beach now is the nation ' s largest container port ; Los Angeles the second-largest . At the same time , Taormina didn ' t want to continue relying_on the Port of Hueneme ' s biggest business then of supplying equipment to offshore oil platforms , given the volatility of the oil market . So he and his staff of 20 focused_on the other two industries Hueneme had traditionally served : fresh fruit and cars . And they lured customers who felt lost at_sea in Los Angeles and Long_Beach . * Taormina learned how large ports can get afflicted with nearsightedness at the Port of San Francisco , which for more_than a decade has lost business to Oakland ' s port . &quot; One of the failures of San Francisco was it felt that it was the port , and no one could take cargo away from it. &quot; To bring new business to Hueneme , Taormina said , he used the &quot; sleepy little port &quot; image to his advantage by quietly negotiating deals that the crowded ports of Los Angeles and Long_Beach couldn ' t match . The fees charged on cargo and ships are generally uniform port to port . But prices for renting or owning facilities at or near a port can vary widely , and therein lies an advantage for Hueneme , which has much relatively cheap land available nearby . Consider BMW , which has delivered all its cars for 12 western states to Hueneme since 1988 . The German auto_maker had wanted to build a facility near the Port of Los Angeles , its old delivery spot , where it could put the finishing touches and accessories on the imports . But that proved impossible because land near the harbor is at a premium . BMW would have had to rent an old building there . &quot; It was easier to come_to a new and emerging port like Port Hueneme where we could get the acreage close to the port and build our own facility , &quot; said Tom McGurn , a spokesman for BMW of North_America Inc. Since then other European auto_makers , including Land Rover ( which also makes Range Rover ) , Jaguar and Volvo , have followed BMW and their common shipping line , Wallenius of Sweden , to Hueneme . Keven Beirne , regional manager for Wallenius Lines North_America Inc. , said the auto industry has been left somewhat on the sidelines at Los Angeles and Long_Beach as those ports devote more space to containerized cargo . Wallenius turned_to Hueneme after growing frustrated with the larger ports ' congestion and high rates for using the port facilities . Wallenius ships about 50 # 000 cars a year to Hueneme . Three times a month , one of Wallenius ' giant floating parking_lots , big enough to house 5 # 800 cars nose to nose on 13 decks , nestles up_to Hueneme docks . Longshoremen working for stevedore companies drive the cars down ramps and park them in an adjacent lot . The cars are driven a mile down a sparsely traveled road , past strawberry fields , to the finishing facilities and are then trucked to dealers throughout the West . * Wallenius , Cool Carriers and a third fruit-shipping line , J . Lauritzen of Denmark , are the biggest shipping customers at the Port of Hueneme . On a typical day , two ships pull into dock . Recently , Wallenius ' Madame Butterfly -- all_the company ' s ships are named after operas -- began its voyage in Sweden and picked_up cars at various places in Europe . After docking at Hueneme , it was bound for ports up the Pacific Coast and then to Japan . Yet another auto_maker , Mitsubishi of Japan , moved its California car shipments to Hueneme in January , after the Port of Los Angeles told the Japanese company it would have to move to a smaller dockside facility to make room for incoming coal shipments and pay a higher rental rate . &quot; We didn ' t feel the Port of Los Angeles was as committed to the auto business , &quot; said Katy Bremer , director of corporate logistics at Mitsubishi Motor Sales Inc. &quot; We needed to be someplace where autos were a priority. &quot; But it ' s the deal with Sherman Oaks-based Sunkist and its Cool Carriers shipping line that Taormina considers his biggest coup . Sunkist had long wanted a refrigerated facility to increase the shelf_life of its oranges and lemons . The Oxnard Harbor District offered to sell tax-exempt bonds to pay_for the 70 % of the facility that the port would own , and Cool Carriers agreed to pay_for the remaining 30 % . After that , &quot; the only thing we needed to know is that we could get our vessels in there , &quot; said Sunkist spokesman Bill Quarles . Sunkist now ships 60 % of its member packinghouses ' fruit out of Hueneme in pallets , bound for Japan and other Pacific Rim countries . The rest of Sunkist ' s exports still go_out of Long_Beach and Los Angeles because they are packed in containers that require those ports ' specialized container operations . Losing business to Hueneme hasn ' t gone unnoticed at Los Angeles and Long_Beach , although any injury to the bigger ports is more like a pinprick than a body blow . &quot; We ' re in a competitive industry , and we certainly don ' t like losing any accounts , &quot; said Port of Los Angeles spokesman Jeff Leong . &quot; But it would hurt more if we lost one of the major container_shipping lines. &quot; Indeed , some observers say the Los Angeles and Long_Beach ports are just as glad to see non-containerized cargo go elsewhere so they can expand on their lucrative container business . And Taormina is_well aware that the Port of Hueneme still has many limitations . He has tried and failed , for instance , to lure the nation ' s largest banana companies , Dole Food Co . and Chiquita Brands International , to his port . The companies now ship through Los Angeles and Long_Beach and they consider Hueneme too small for their needs . Launched in 1940 by local farmers , the Port of Hueneme was operating for only two years before the Navy took it over during World_War_II . In the 1960s and 1970s , the Harbor District bought back about 70 acres from the Navy and resumed commercial port operations . Taormina is now looking_at ways to keep the port growing . He ' s close to a deal to lease another berth and 25 acres from the Navy on a part-time basis , an achievement that would allow another shipping line to come_in . He ' s also hoping to capture more business from BMW as the auto_maker increases production at its first U.S. plant in Virginia . And last week , the Port of Hueneme won another victory when it was approved by the Department_of_Commerce as a foreign trade zone . The new status gives import companies an advantage by allowing them to forgo paying customs duties until their goods leave the port . But mostly Taormina sees the port growing along with expanding Pacific Rim trade and the opening of markets under the North_American Free_Trade Agreement and other trade pacts . If China ever opened its market to citrus imports , he said , Hueneme would be one busy little port . &quot; We have really established a niche , &quot; he said . &quot; We now have to look_at how do we enhance that niche. &quot;</TEXT>
