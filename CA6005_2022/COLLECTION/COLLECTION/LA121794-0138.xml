   <HEADLINE> GORE SEEKS A WARMING TREND IN MOSCOW ; RUSSIA : VICE_PRESIDENT DISMISSES AN EARLIER WARNING BY YELTSIN OF A ' COLD PEACE. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a three-day visit to Moscow aimed at soothing irritated relations between the United States and Russia , Vice_President Al Gore said Friday that the threat of a &quot; cold peace &quot; was only rhetorical . &quot; My impression is that there is no cold peace but instead a warm relationship that is very much on track , &quot; Gore said after a 30-minute meeting with President Boris N . Yeltsin at the hospital where Yeltsin is recovering from minor nose surgery . At a European summit in Budapest , Hungary , earlier this month , Yeltsin had warned of a &quot; cold peace &quot; in a divided Europe if the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization pushed ahead with a proposal to extend membership to the Central and Eastern European_countries while excluding Russia . Earlier , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev had snubbed a meeting of NATO foreign_ministers by abruptly refusing to sign a cooperation agreement while television_cameras waiting to record the event were rolling . A senior U.S. Administration official said the United States still does not know whether Moscow will sign the Partnership for Peace agreement but blamed some of the Russian ire on the &quot; misimpression &quot; given to the Russians by the Europeans about whether the former Warsaw Pact nations could join NATO as early as next year . Gore talked with Yeltsin &quot; in some detail about the misunderstandings they ( the Russians ) received from the Europeans about what NATO did and didn ' t do , &quot; the official said . In meetings with Russian Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , Gore stressed that the United States wants any expansion to be gradual and to be approved in consultation with the Russians , the official said . Moreover , even if Moscow opts not to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement , Russia ' s relationship with NATO will be defined through other international agreements , the officials said . * While Gore was ironing out relations with Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin , and signing more agreements on U.S.-Russian cooperation on the environment , space , energy and defense conversion , U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , also visiting Moscow , met for 90 minutes with Deputy Defense Minister Andrei A . Kokoshin and Mikhail P . Kolesnikov , head of the Russian military general_staff . Perry told the Associated Press_on his airplane that he had tried to calm Moscow ' s concern about a NATO expansion and had extensive discussions about how to support the U.N. humanitarian effort in Bosnia-Herzegovina . He said the Russian officials were preoccupied by the situation in the breakaway republic of Chechnya . To the obvious relief of his hosts , Gore repeated to every Russian official and news reporter that the United States considers the rebellion in Chechnya to be a Russian internal affair , although the United States hopes the conflict can be resolved without more bloodshed . If the televised images of Russian troops , tanks and helicopters firing on Muslim villagers in Chechnya sent the message that Moscow is still capable of using tanks to protect its national interests -- perhaps the wrong message for Poland and the Czech Republic , which insist on NATO membership as a guarantee against Russian aggression -- Gore voiced only sympathy with the &quot; immensely complicated &quot; problem . * As special forces patrolled Moscow to deter possible terrorist attacks from the Chechen community in the capital , Tipper Gore was forced to skip a planned trip to a Russian school because of a bomb threat . Moscow police said they now handle about a dozen such threats every day . They said the teen-age telephone caller to the school that the vice_president ' s wife planned to visit was probably just a prankster . Among the U.S.-Russian agreements signed as a result of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission on Economic and Technological Development were pledges to cooperate on such joint problems as Arctic pollution , telecommunications , exchanging technical information on nuclear_warhead security , recommending revisions to a Russian tax_system that stifles Western investment , and the international space_station . The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp . has also agreed to issue up_to $ 500 million in loan guarantees to promote private U.S. investment in converting Russian defense plants to peacetime uses .</TEXT>
