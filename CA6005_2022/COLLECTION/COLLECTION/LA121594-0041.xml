   <HEADLINE> ONE ELECTION DOESN ' T MAKE A REVOLUTION ; POLITICS : WOMEN DIDN ' T GAIN INSTANT PARITY IN CAMPAIGN ' 92 NOR WERE THEY CONSIGNED TO HISTORY BY CAMPAIGN ' 94 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the &quot; women and politics watch , &quot; the ghost of 1992 lingers . &quot; What happened to women ? &quot; is intoned with disbelief . Were the high spirits of ' 92 , the yester-Year-of-the-Woman , so short-lived or misplaced ? No , not misplaced . Just premature and ahistorical in entertaining a notion that one election year might overcome centuries of political practice , granting women power with one Olympic leap . Still , the hellfires of Campaign ' 94 did not immolate women . Political woman is alive and well , even if not a prime-time story . Progress takes_place nomination by nomination , inch by historical inch . That has been happening for more_than two decades , and will continue for many_more before women achieve political parity . While headlines trumpeted 1992 the &quot; Year of the Woman , &quot; that year ' s particular news was that women sprinted forward in national office . When the 103rd Congress convened , women occupied 10 % of 535 Senate and House seats , four points over the previous 6 % high . The extraordinary success produced four new female senators , while women in the House nearly doubled their ranks . A close look shows almost all newcomers winning open seats ; all but three were Democrats , and a number won in traditionally Republican or highly competitive House districts . In the state legislatures -- a marker level of steady , incremental progress for women throughout two decades -- 1992 resulted in a rare gain of two percentage_points rather than the more typical one-point increase . Enter the 1994 gender sweepstakes . How would women outpace themselves ? Expectations were unrealistic . The political ballyhoo was about something else in 1994 . Change was still an energizing issue , but this time women were not center stage as the positive symbol of change and difference . The electorate ' s energy was focused less on empowering newcomers than on ejecting old-timers . Old-timers , including those who had been in office only a term , translated as Democrats . Elected women encountered this year ' s ballot_box anger . Especially vulnerable were Democratic women in marginal seats where the 1994 Republican tide swept out interlopers in traditionally Republican areas . Where challengers faced incumbents , incumbents were vulnerable in 1994 regardless of gender if they were Democrats . In state legislative races , a remarkable 25 % of female Republican challengers defeated incumbent Democrats , whereas a mere 4 % of female Democratic challengers defeated Republican incumbents . When state legislatures convene in January , 1995 , Republican women will hold 87 additional seats and Democratic women will be down by 104 seats . Competitions for open seats followed_suit . Where there were open seats in the Senate , Republicans were likely to win in 1994 . In House races for open seats , Republican women won 67 % of the time versus 40 % for Democratic women . The overall picture for 1994 shows that in keeping with recent elections , increasingly women competed for the most coveted offices -- governors and senators in powerful states such_as California , Texas , Illinois , New York . There were even several &quot; double_feature &quot; races in which two -- sometimes more -- women won nominations for their state ' s top positions . When the new Senate convenes , for the first time in history , eight women will serve . Notwithstanding the loss of 11 departing or defeated congresswomen ( almost a quarter of their delegation ) , women in the House managed to hold onto their 47 seats . In the states , record numbers of women have been elected to statewide executive offices . In legislatures , women held onto the level of representation achieved in the record-setting elections of 1992 . One by one , inch by inch . Coronations were as inappropriate for ' 92 as funerals are this year . The epilogue to 1994 is that women returned to their familiar position -- pushing_forward here , stalling a bit there , chalking_up political firsts or near-firsts for gender politics . Election 1992 was one year , not a generation ; election ' 94 is but another year in the long push to parity . Neither year switched direction for women in politics . While nothing about social and political progress is inevitable or should be taken_for granted , while vigilance and organization remain essential , the trend_line for women in politics is uninterrupted and upwardly inclined . It is far too soon to switch_off or change channels . Stay tuned .</TEXT>
