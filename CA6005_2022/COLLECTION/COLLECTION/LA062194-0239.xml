   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON ENTERS PLEA OF NOT GUILTY IN DOUBLE MURDER ; CRIME : HE LOOKS HAGGARD IN COURT AS HE ANSWERS TO CHARGES OF SLAYING HIS EX-WIFE AND HER FRIEND . THE DEFENSE IS GRANTED ACCESS TO EVIDENCE IN THE CASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Looking dazed and haggard , O.J. Simpson pleaded not_guilty Monday to charges that he murdered his ex-wife and a friend of hers , and his lawyer later said the football hall of famer was under medication and &quot; very , very depressed , exceedingly emotional. &quot; Simpson faltered near the beginning of the arraignment in Los Angeles Municipal Court , failing to answer when Judge Patti Jo McKay asked his name and wincing when the charge of murdering his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , was read to him . For most of the brief session , Simpson , dressed in a dark suit but without a tie , belt or shoelaces -- officials will not allow him anything that could be used in a suicide attempt -- stood with his head cocked to one side . He blinked slowly and gazed around the courtroom , sighing deeply several times as lawyers discussed schedules for turning_over evidence and other details of the case . Simpson ' s lawyer , Robert L . Shapiro , asked_for access to coroner ' s reports , police reports and other case documents , some of which are completed and others that are being compiled . Shapiro did not ask_for bail , a request that would almost certainly have been denied because of the charges in the case . Prosecutors raised no objections to Shapiro ' s requests . &quot; The people are happy to share all_the evidence in this case , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark , the prosecutor assigned to the case . &quot; Every piece of evidence will be shared with the defense. &quot; Shapiro has hired experts to review evidence , particularly the findings of the Los Angeles County coroner . Late Monday , the attorney and one of those experts , pathologist Michael Baden , spent about 50 minutes at the coroner ' s office to collect and review reports related to the case . In court , Judge McKay set June 30 as a preliminary hearing date . Shapiro later said that he and Simpson welcomed the early opportunity to hear sworn testimony from witnesses in a public forum . Such a hearing , Shapiro said , would allow a public airing of the evidence and would subject witnesses to vigorous cross-examination in a case rife_with speculation . Whether that will happen , however , remains doubtful . Prosecutors already are presenting evidence to a grand_jury . If that body returns an indictment against Simpson in the murders , it would preclude the need for a preliminary hearing . Grand_juries meet in secret , and witnesses cannot bring their attorneys , two facts that make such proceedings appealing_to prosecutors trying to build a case . While the hearings are closed , California grand_juries generally disclose transcripts in cases in which the targets are indicted , so the testimony probably will not remain secret for long if Simpson is indicted . As the case shifted from police to the courtroom , lawyers on both sides spent Monday jockeying for advantage , holding a pair of news_conferences on opposite sides of town . Addressing the media in the lobby of his Century City office_building , Shapiro reiterated his contention Monday that Simpson was home when the murders were committed , but he also declined to rule_out pursuing an insanity defense for his client . &quot; At the present_time I have not discussed at any great length the facts of the case &quot; with Simpson , said Shapiro , adding that he is contacting lawyers across the country in_order to assemble a trial team headed by himself . Asked about an insanity defense , Shapiro responded : &quot; Every possible defense has to be considered by any trial_lawyer , and I certainly would reserve all possibilities. &quot; Shapiro also said his hurried reading of police reports given to him in court suggested that there was not conclusive scientific evidence linking his client to the murders . But Shapiro conceded that he had not read the entire document , and had not yet seen any of the evidence in the case . &quot; He has stated in his letter that he is innocent , &quot; Shapiro said . &quot; The charges that were read are charges that are going_to be contested. &quot; Blood samples taken from the scene of the crime showed a blood_type that matches Simpson ' s , according to sources familiar_with the case . Preliminary DNA tests have been conducted on those and other blood samples -- including ones taken from Simpson ' s driveway , as well as clothes , shoes and other items taken from his home . Prosecutors would not comment on the results of the preliminary DNA testing , but sources familiar_with the case said those tests continue to link Simpson to the murders . Preliminary DNA tests generally are not admissible in court , but final results are expected to be available in the coming weeks . Those tests are far more precise than the ones that have been conducted so far , and could play a significant role in the case against Simpson . At his news_conference , Shapiro acknowledged that Simpson had two cuts on one hand , a relatively small one to his index_finger and a larger one near his wrist , which the athlete said occurred when he broke a glass_in his Chicago hotel_room upon hearing news of his ex-wife ' s death . Simpson also has several scratches on his hands and wrists , Shapiro said , describing them as &quot; paper cuts. &quot; Prosecutors , meanwhile , met with reporters at the courthouse after the arraignment and said they were confident that they already have enough evidence to convict Simpson of the brutal double murder , which occurred June 12 outside Nicole Brown Simpson ' s Brentwood condominium . The blood-soaked bodies of Simpson , 35 , and her friend , Ronald Lyle Goldman , 25 , were found shortly after 12 a.m. June 13 , touching_off a murder investigation whose developments are being followed around the world . &quot; It was premeditated murder , &quot; Clark said . &quot; It was done with deliberation and premeditation . That is precisely what he is charged with because that is what we will prove. &quot; Clark said prosecutors have discounted any notion that the killings were an act of passion , or , as one reporter put it , &quot; a spontaneous meltdown. &quot; She also said there were no plans to charge anyone else in the slayings . &quot; Mr. Simpson is charged alone , &quot; Clark said , &quot; because he is the sole murderer. &quot; Simpson ' s failure to surrender Friday and a subsequent car chase broadcast on live television sent publicity surrounding the case to new heights and produced an outpouring of public_opinion , much of it apparently favorable to Simspon . As he and close friend Al Cowlings were pursued by police through Orange and Los Angeles counties , hundreds of supporters cheered from overpasses and more gathered_in front of his Brentwood home , where Simpson eventually gave himself up . Simpson had drafted an apparent suicide note and had a gun during that chase , which Shapiro said began because his client was heading for his ex-wife ' s grave so that he could kill himself there . Police sources said Monday that they recovered the gun from Cowlings ' Ford Bronco and that it was loaded . Prosecutors have acknowledged that Simpson ' s popularity may make_it difficult to find a jury willing to convict him . But they said Monday that they are convinced that when the facts of the case are known , support for the world renowned athlete-actor will wither . &quot; Of course there is some sympathy for Mr. Simpson because he is a public figure , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . David Conn , who is assisting Clark . &quot; But as time goes_on I think the public is going_to look a little more closely at the brutality of this crime and I think there will be a better perspective on the manner in which this case was handled. &quot; Nicole Simpson ' s throat was slashed so deeply that the wound exposed her spinal_column , according to sources familiar_with the case . Goldman was stabbed numerous times with the same weapon , which Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti has described as a &quot; substantial knife. &quot; Sources have said that Goldman ' s injuries suggested a fierce struggle with his assailant . Investigators still are searching for the murder weapon , and police returned Monday to a Chicago field where they searched with metal detectors last week . A gas_station attendant has told police that he saw a man resembling Simpson in that field last week , during the time that Simpson was briefly in Chicago before returning to Los Angeles to face questioning in connection with the killings . Late Monday , police_dogs in Chicago found a bag containing a pair of socks in the wooded area just south of the O ' Hare-Plaza Hotel where Simpson stayed briefly on June 13 . They also found a pair of sunglasses . A Los Angeles detective at the scene said the items would have to dry_out before they could be examined more thoroughly and preserved as possible evidence .</TEXT>
