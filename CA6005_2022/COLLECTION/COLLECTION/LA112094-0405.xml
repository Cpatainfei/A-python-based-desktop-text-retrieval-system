   <HEADLINE> ISRAELI ARMY KILLS 3 AFTER PALESTINIANS REDIRECT ANGER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stepping back from the internecine violence that erupted Friday in Gaza and raised the specter of a Palestinian civil_war , Palestinian protesters trained their fury on a safer target Saturday -- the Israeli army . In East Jerusalem and across the West_Bank , Israeli police and soldiers clashed with Palestinian demonstrators , shooting two dead and wounding at least seven . In the Gaza Strip , Israeli soldiers withdrew from a checkpoint near Netzarim , an isolated Jewish settlement , after hundreds of Palestinians began throwing stones at them . As the soldiers withdrew , demonstrators pursued them . The soldiers opened_fire , killing one 17-year-old Palestinian , according to an Israeli army statement . Palestinians raised a flag at the post before Palestinian police managed to restore order , and three Israeli border policemen were slightly injured , the army said . Another soldier was fatally wounded in a drive-by_shooting at the checkpoint . Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat -- who helped broker a truce with his Islamic fundamentalist foes -- may have found slight comfort in the fact that it was Israelis clashing with Palestinians on Saturday and not the Arab-on-Arab violence that killed at least 13 people Friday . But there was little else to encourage him . In demonstrations from the West_Bank town of Hebron to Gaza City , thousands of Palestinians cursed Arafat as a traitor , burned his picture and mourned the Palestinians who were killed in clashes with Arafat ' s security_forces Friday . General strikes were observed in the territories -- even in Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho , where the self-governing authority that Arafat heads is in_charge . Authorities in both places unsuccessfully urged merchants to keep their shops open . In the northern West_Bank town of Tulkarm , a fierce demonstration ended with two Palestinians killed and at least seven wounded by army gunfire . Few seemed mollified by the Palestinian Authority ' s decision , issued Saturday , to form a judicial commission of inquiry and a fact-finding commission to look_into the events leading_up to the clash that erupted Friday between Palestinian police and followers of the militant Islamic movements Hamas and Islamic Jihad outside a Gaza mosque . Palestinian intellectuals issued dire predictions that civil_war may still erupt . They blamed the strife on Arafat , along with Israel , the United States and nations that have promised to contribute financial_aid to the Palestinians but have not delivered . &quot; These incidents that occurred on Friday broke a taboo , &quot; said Ziad abu Amr , a professor of political_science at Birzeit University in the West_Bank . &quot; It reminds me of how things first started in Algeria , &quot; where the government ' s war with Islamic militants has claimed thousands of lives . &quot; The blame lies_with the Palestinian Authority , which should have foreseen this moment and prepared_for it , &quot; Amr said . &quot; One has to take serious steps that will deal with the causes , not just the symptoms , &quot; said Hanan Mikhail-Ashrawi , a former peace negotiator for the Palestinians . Mikhail-Ashrawi now heads an independent Palestinian human_rights organization formed to act_as a watchdog over the Palestinian self-governing authority . &quot; Things could have degenerated into a civil_war yesterday , &quot; Mikhail-Ashrawi said in an interview Saturday . &quot; I ' m glad that now there is no immediate violence ( between the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian militants ) . But that doesn ' t mean that there has been a miraculous solution found for the problems . The detonator was there yesterday , and we haven ' t completely removed the explosives. &quot; Mikhail-Ashrawi blamed Israel for pressuring Arafat to crack_down on Islamic militants after both Hamas and Islamic Jihad carried_out a series of bloody attacks on Israelis in the last two months . &quot; The whole attitude of Israel is patronizing , &quot; Mikhail-Ashrawi said . Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid , who is involved in negotiations with Arafat , rejected any blame for Israel in Friday ' s events . &quot; We don ' t want to see them in a state of civil_war , &quot; Sarid said Saturday . &quot; We wish them peace and tranquillity . We put pressure on Yasser Arafat to fight terror and terrorists , and this is the only target we ask him to fight . We are not pleased with the unfortunate and tragic event that occurred yesterday. &quot; Uri Savir , director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry , said Saturday that the international community understands now that a state of emergency exists in Gaza . &quot; There is a growing feeling of a need for an emergency effort toward Gaza , &quot; Savir said . He said that Gaza ' s myriad economic problems will be discussed at the end of the month in Brussels , when donor countries meet to study ways of funneling money to the Palestinian Authority . &quot; In the eyes of many , Gaza has turned_into a test for the whole peace process , because there the harshest battle takes_place between the forces of compromise and the fundamentalists , &quot; Savir said . &quot; We must make an effort to strengthen Arafat. &quot; Members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad claimed that 13 Palestinians were killed Friday and more_than 200 were injured in skirmishes that began outside Gaza ' s largest mosque and spread to the streets . The Palestinian Health Ministry issued a statement Saturday saying that 13 people were killed and 129 were injured . By Saturday night , however , unofficial Palestinian sources were putting the number of dead at 18 , saying five died overnight of wounds sustained Friday . A hastily formed reconciliation committee , which included leaders of the Israeli Arab community , managed to work_out a truce between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas late Friday night that held throughout the day Saturday . The Palestinian Authority honored a commitment to keep police away from the eight funerals in Gaza to bury some of those killed Friday . Police also stayed away when an estimated 2 # 000 Hamas supporters marched through Gaza City , protesting what they called a &quot; massacre &quot; and denouncing Arafat . But the Palestinian Authority made no apologies for the conduct of its security services . &quot; Hamas and Jihad deliberately crossed the red_line today , &quot; said a leaflet issued by Arafat ' s Fatah faction , the largest Palestinian group represented in the self-governing authority . &quot; We in Fatah affirm that enough is enough . We declare unequivocally that we won ' t stand and watch but will know how to confront all forms of political rowdiness and external agents. &quot; Hamas leaders , however , placed the blame squarely on Arafat ' s shoulders and said it is up_to him to make amends . &quot; The whole event ( of Palestinian police opening fire on demonstrators ) was planned in_advance , &quot; Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahhar insisted in an interview Saturday night on Israel Television . &quot; Arafat bears personal responsibility until he identifies the real killers and puts them on_trial , so that we can understand how . . . Palestinians could kill other Palestinians in such a barbaric manner. &quot;</TEXT>
