   <HEADLINE> FERNANDO REY , 76 ; DEBONAIR FILM_STAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fernando Rey , the suave , debonair international actor from Spain best known for his roles in the films of surrealist director Luis Bunuel and as a drug lord in &quot; The French Connection , &quot; died Wednesday in Madrid . He was 76 . Rey , who appeared in more_than 150 films made in Spain , France , Italy , Germany and the United States over half a century , died at his home of bladder cancer . In recent years , Rey had served as president of the Spanish Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences . The impeccably tailored and bearded actor , once described by &quot; French Connection &quot; producer Phil D ' Antoni as &quot; the last of the Continental guys , &quot; achieved perhaps his greatest success in the 1970s when he had already turned 50 . Rey portrayed the elegantly evil villain opposite Gene Hackman in &quot; The French Connection &quot; in 1971 and starred in Bunuel ' s &quot; Tristana &quot; in 1970 and &quot; Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie &quot; in 1972 . He won the best actor award at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival for his role in &quot; Elisa , My Life. &quot; &quot; Perhaps it is a pity that my success came so late in life , &quot; he told The Times in Madrid in 1973 . &quot; It might have been better to have been successful while young , like El Cordobes in the bullring . Then your life is all before you to enjoy it . &quot; Still , adversity , too , teaches you how to savor life -- like a cup of coffee sip by sip. &quot; Born Fernando Casado Arambillet in La Coruna , Rey studied to be an architect -- but the Spanish Civil War intervened . He and his father , an army colonel , fought on the side of the Loyalists , and by the end of the war were impoverished . &quot; I became a movie extra just to get money to eat , &quot; he told The Times in 1987 . &quot; I never had that ambition to be an actor , but it was like a chain_reaction . One day a director asked me if I could say a line , and I did it. &quot; Soon Rey was dubbing Spanish voices in foreign films , beginning with Tyrone Power in &quot; Lloyds of London. &quot; Later he dubbed Laurence Olivier in all_the Briton ' s Shakespearean films , with Olivier becoming Rey ' s unknowing acting tutor . Rey portrayed romantic leads in Spanish films in the 1940s and 1950s and earned his first major international success with Bunuel ' s &quot; Viridiana &quot; in 1961 . &quot; If it wasn ' t for Bunuel , nobody outside Spain and South_America would have the faintest idea who I am , &quot; Rey said in 1972 . He made four films for the noted director including Bunuel ' s last , &quot; That Obscure Object of Desire , &quot; in 1977 . Rey ' s favorite role was that of Don Lope , the elderly guardian obsessed with his beautiful ward , portrayed by French actress Catherine Deneuve in &quot; Tristana , &quot; a study of old_age . It was that role that won him the part in the American film &quot; The French Connection. &quot; &quot; ( Bunuel ) always wanted me to play dirty old_men , &quot; Rey said in 1987 . &quot; But we established a relationship that was very easy for me . Bunuel was so relaxing . Normally , when a film is finished , everybody is tired ; with Bunuel you had the impression you had done nothing . I ' ve seen his crew cry at the end of shooting. &quot; Rey is survived by his wife of 34 years , Argentine actress Mabel Karr , their son and daughter and four grandchildren .</TEXT>
