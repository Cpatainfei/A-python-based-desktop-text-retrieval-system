   <TEXT> Italian magistrates asked Friday that the brother of Prime Minister-designate Silvio Berlusconi and 29 others , including former government leader Bettino Craxi , be brought_to trial on corruption charges . The request followed a probe into alleged bribes paid on property deals with Italy ' s biggest savings bank , Cariplo . The probe erupted in the midst of Silvio Berlusconi ' s election campaign . A senior judge must rule whether there is sufficient ground to try the 30 on charges of corruption and receiving bribes . Paolo Berlusconi , who runs the family property businesses , was briefly arrested shortly before his brother ' s conservative Freedom Alliance won a general_election held March 27 and 28 . He denies any wrongdoing .</TEXT>
