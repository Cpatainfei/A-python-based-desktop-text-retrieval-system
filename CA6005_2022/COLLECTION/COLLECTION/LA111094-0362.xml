   <HEADLINE> BY DESIGN ; LEADERS OF THE PACK ; SHOULDER THE LOAD WITH WHIMSY . IMAGINATIVE CARRY-ALLS TOTE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALISM INTO A MONKEY SUIT OR A PAIR OF WINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Backpacks have become the fashionable alternative to purses this season , inspiring designers from the house of Prada to fledgling street-wear labels to come_up with interpretations that reflect the individuality of its wearer . While tiny black satin packs and ones made of exotic skins have been welcomed by the well-heeled , the funkier , usually more affordable versions have endeared themselves among the young and eclectic . The rule : the more unconventional the better . Apparently , no fabrication is passed_over as designers cut packs from long-haired faux fur , patterned velour , metallic vinyl and even colored Astroturf . Teens and twentysomethings are raiding the Sesame Street and Disney stores in South Coast Plaza , or their younger sibling ' s closets . A young executive might tote her Day Runner , pager and Evian in the secret compartment of a fuzzy monkey on her back . These aren ' t those utilitarian canvas carriers for hauling schoolbooks or hiking equipment . But they still serve a practical purpose . &quot; It ' s become an important fashion item because it ' s much more convenient and lets your hands stay free , &quot; says Herbie Velez , owner of Pop Icon in New York . &quot; No one can snatch it off you without a struggle , and that ' s something to consider in a nightclub or a big city. &quot; And they don ' t compare to fanny packs ( remember them ? ) , which -- outside an athletic setting -- never seemed to look right on anyone . &quot; Backpacks are a lot different because you can make more of a statement with them . There are so many styles to fit ( from ) casual to elegant , &quot; Velez says . Pop Icon was among the first to market the kiddie-style Mr. Friendly backpack to adult ravers at the turn of the decade . Accessories and images relating to children have long appealed_to the rave culture . That childlike items such_as Mary Janes and flowery barrettes have found a wider market among fad slaves this year has helped make backpacks , especially whimsical ones , into wardrobe staples . Velez followed with &quot; Mr. Tuff , &quot; a vinyl knapsack that resembles a washing detergent box . Sporting a Pop Icon pack once meant you had bagged it at the Big Apple , but this summer the goofy backpacks went nationwide . They will not appear at your local mall , warns Velez , but only cool , exclusive shops , such_as Polyester in Laguna Beach . Club deejay Sean Perry began wearing a Mr. Friendly four years ago to carry his water_bottle , keys , pictures , headphones and 45 singles . To his spin gigs at the Empire Ballroom in Costa Mesa and Dragonfly in Santa Monica , he now carries a vinyl pumpkin-orange pack his &quot; ultra-stylish &quot; roommate gave him ( &quot; It ' s way too trendy for me , &quot; he quips ) . Perry , 26 , sees backpacks as almost a requisite accessory in the club scene . &quot; It ' s always been more out of practicality than fashion , &quot; he says . The advent of the trend , however , draws_on &quot; both those reasons. &quot; Indeed , it ' s this balance between function and fashion that makes backpacks an inherently ' 90s item in a decade that continues to be dominated by retro rehash . ( Reports from Milan to New York hail the return of World_War II-era glamour for spring ' 95. ) Boots might recall the ' 70s , a dress the ' 30s and a hairdo the ' 60s , but the wild pouch in zebra velveteen is undeniably of this era . What ' s more , they ' re favored by men and women . Black_Flys of Costa Mesa manufactured backpacks from new , vintage-inspired upholstery fabric for its mostly male , snowboard clientele . &quot; We thought we ' d do_it for ( guys ) , &quot; says owner Jack Martinez , &quot; but the girl ' s market just picked_up on them . Now we can ' t keep them in stock. &quot; &quot; It ' s a ' 90s thing now , &quot; confirms Dana Harvey . To satisfy a custom order for a pair of angel wings a friend needed for an event , the Costa Mesa designer cut a pair from quilted vinyl . The response encouraged him to produce more for his Angel Boy label . &quot; Conceptually , it ' s kind of a liberating thing -- growing out of your purse , getting your wings and then flying free_of any restrictions , &quot; Harvey says . &quot; With a backpack , you just throw it on and go. &quot;</TEXT>
