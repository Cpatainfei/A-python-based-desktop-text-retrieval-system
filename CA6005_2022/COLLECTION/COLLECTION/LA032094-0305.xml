   <HEADLINE> CITY TIMES VOICES : READING , WRITING AND HELPING ; A SALVADORAN REFUGEE HAS SET_ASIDE HIS GOAL TO BECOME A LAWYER IN FAVOR OF TEACHING LITERACY SKILLS TO LATINO ADULTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Latinos are one of the fastest-growing ethnic_groups in South-Central , but there is a great lack of community-based educational services for non-English-speaking adults . The public_library system provides basic literacy in English for English-speaking adults and local schools offer English as a Second Language classes . Neither , however , addresses the learning needs of those who lack basic reading and writing skills in their native language . Learning to read and write in Spanish is the first_step before going_on to ESL classes . I started PRECO to help serve as this link . Classes are offered four nights a week at St . Columbkille and St . Vincent ' s churches . I am one of three teachers , and we have about 30 students , who are given individualized and group instruction . Most of our students are adult immigrants , ranging from age 18 to 60 , who came here for economic or political reasons and who have to deal with a lot of obstacles to survive . We teach Spanish literacy by using the students ' culture and experiences as immigrants , students and job-seekers . We focus_on teaching words representing the living conditions of the Latino community such_as vivienda ( housing ) , salud ( health ) and familia ( family ) . Traditional methods use words like manzana ( apple ) or ventana ( window ) . This works for children because at that moment they are learning to know their environment , but the traditional method is not effective for adults . If you cannot read or write , even in Spanish , it ' s very hard to find work or fill_out an application for social_services . I knew Spanish and it was still a difficult experience . For those who are illiterate , it is twice as difficult . I was a law_student at the National University in El_Salvador but was forced to come_to the United States for my personal security in 1988 because of my involvement in a student campaign to demand more funding for the university from the government . I received anonymous letters threatening me , and for my last six months in El_Salvador I was followed by government_agents who questioned me and followed me wherever I went . My wife and 5-year-old daughter are still in El_Salvador , but I knew if I did not leave I would eventually be killed . I did not know any English and worked as a dishwasher when I arrived in this country . I taught myself English , and it ' s still important to me to improve my language skills . PRECO operates out of my apartment on a budget of about $ 50 # 000 . Most of our money is invested in computer equipment for developing a textbook and flyers and school supplies . The churches have donated classroom space and we have received grants from foundations . I work more_than 60 hours each week , teaching and recruiting students , teachers and volunteers . I have all but given_up on my dream of becoming a lawyer , but I have no regrets .</TEXT>
