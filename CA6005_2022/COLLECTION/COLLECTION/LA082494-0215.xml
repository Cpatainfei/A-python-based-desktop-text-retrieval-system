   <HEADLINE> RWANDAN REFUGEES LEAVE CROWDED ZAIRE TOWN FOR NEW CAMPSITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thousands of Rwandan refugees packed their bags and headed out of Bukavu on Tuesday as tempers in the increasingly filthy and congested Zairian town became more and more frayed . From early morning , there was a steady flow of Hutus out of the city_center going toward Hongo , a new campsite opening_up for 80 # 000 people on the wind-swept shores of Lake Kivu . &quot; People are clearing_out of town incredibly fast , &quot; said Jane Pope of the CARE charity ' s Canadian branch . &quot; They are vacating the sites and there ' s been a steady stream of people. &quot; The start of a move from Bukavu came as a relief to the aid agencies , who have warned that the presence of 100 # 000 refugees in the city_center risks triggering epidemics and increasingly violent confrontations . Aid officials say Zairians are already beginning to catch the debilitating dysentery the refugees brought with them . They say that once epidemics like measles start , there will be a far higher death rate among Zairians , who are vaccinated only occasionally , than Rwandans , who have benefited from a comprehensive vaccination program . Life in this picturesque lakeside town has been transformed by the influx of tens of thousands of refugees who are convinced that the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front , which won the civil_war , will crack_down in the wake of France ' s weekend troop withdrawal from a &quot; safe zone &quot; in southwest Rwanda . Hard-line supporters of Rwanda ' s ousted Hutu administration have been accused of the massacre of about 500 # 000 minority Tutsis after the April 6 death of Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana . As the Bukavu squatters set_out on foot , trucks provided by aid agencies took many refugees from the Rwandan side of the Rusizi River across the frontier toward Nyamanangwe , another new camp . After initially closing its Bukavu border crossings Saturday on the grounds that it did not want a repeat of last month ' s Goma catastrophe , Zaire agreed under pressure from the aid agencies to open the lesser used of two bridges . The aim was to force the refugees to bypass central Bukavu , crammed to the bursting point , and settle in the camps . No Hutus were being allowed to walk across the Rusizi 2 bridge south of town on Tuesday ; instead , they were being carefully herded onto trucks heading directly to the camps .</TEXT>
