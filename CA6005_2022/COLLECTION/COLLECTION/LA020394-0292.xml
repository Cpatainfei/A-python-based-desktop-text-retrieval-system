   <HEADLINE> U.S. OFFICIALS PLAY_DOWN ABUSES IN MEXICO UPRISING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State_Department officials acknowledged on Wednesday that &quot; some human_rights abuses may have occurred &quot; after last month ' s peasant uprising in Mexico , but they asserted that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari responded in &quot; a forthcoming and responsible way. &quot; In the Clinton_Administration ' s first public testimony on the insurrection in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas , officials said they had been assured that those found guilty of abuses will be punished . But other witnesses at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing took a harsher view of events in Chiapas , where 2 # 000 members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army took_control of four county_seats on New Year ' s Day before relinquishing control several days later . Fernando Hernandez , a Mayan leader in Chiapas , testified that the killing and disappearance of native people by the army &quot; is a common and daily occurrence. &quot; Juan E . Mendez , executive_director of Human_Rights Watch / Americas , said members of his group who visited Chiapas found evidence of summary executions , disappearances and torture . In Chiapas , Salinas ' political_party , the Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , &quot; bears little resemblance to the image of modernization . . . that Salinas has carefully cultivated , &quot; Mendez said . He added that &quot; rural bosses with close ties to the PRI own not only the land -- they also own the local police , civil_authorities and judges. &quot; Alexander F . Watson , assistant secretary_of_state for Latin_American affairs , said he does not wish to challenge the Mexicans ' testimony . But he told the Western_Hemisphere subcommittee that Salinas should be commended for &quot; attempting to establish a peaceful dialogue with the rebels. &quot; Watson said Salinas had taken steps to resolve the crisis , including instructing government officials on Jan . 6 &quot; to respect the human_rights of the civilian population. &quot; A_few days later , he replaced his interior minister and appointed Foreign Minister Manuel Camacho Solis , known as a skilled negotiator , to serve as commissioner for peace and reconciliation , Watson said . &quot; A resolution of the broader problems in Chiapas will not be achieved overnight , &quot; he testified . &quot; It is an area of deep inequalities , where powerful landlords and local bosses have conspired to thwart the aspirations for justice and better standards_of_living for the rural populations. &quot; Watson also responded to critics who assert that the uprising showed Mexico to be an unworthy economic partner of the United States in the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , which the Administration pushed_through Congress last year . &quot; The legitimate grievances of the people of southern Mexico were neither caused by NAFTA nor should NAFTA be in any way compromised by these developments , &quot; he said . &quot; Indeed , the events in Chiapas demonstrated more clearly than ever the need for NAFTA ( because ) Mexico will be drawn more into the Western community of nations. &quot; Amnesty International , confirming statements by the group in Mexico_City last month , gave the subcommittee a report charging the army with gross violations of human_rights -- terrorizing Indian villages and beating , torturing and kidnaping inhabitants . Meantime , in Mexico , officials reacted to the American hearings with equanimity that would have been surprising only a_few years ago ; this , perhaps , was a reflection of the closer U.S.-Mexican relationship . The most critical comment came from Andres Rosenthal , undersecretary of foreign relations , who said they &quot; were hardly_a friendly thing to do. &quot; But Senate Majority_Leader Emilio M . Gonzalez said American legislators &quot; have every right to express their opinions . Criticisms between countries are inevitable. &quot; Times staff writer Juanita Darling in Mexico_City contributed to this report .</TEXT>
