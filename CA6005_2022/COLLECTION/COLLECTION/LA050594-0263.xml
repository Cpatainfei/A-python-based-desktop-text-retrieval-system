   <HEADLINE> CHEW ON THIS : POPCORN SALES DECLINE A LITTLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First Americans heard about the high fat content in movie_theater popcorn . This week we ate less of it . And soon many theaters will be making the salty snack differently . Sales at the nation ' s cinemas dropped an average of about 10 % after release of a report conducted by the Center for Science in the Public Interest , according to exhibition officials . For theater operators who depend_on concessions for the largest chunk of their incomes , the report and drop_in popcorn sales were hard to swallow . But the bad news appears to be only temporary . Companies representing about 25 % of the nation ' s theaters say they have switched to the lower-saturated-fat canola oil , to hydrogenated canola shortening , or are offering air-popped corn . &quot; There was a perceptible decline in popcorn sales , &quot; acknowledged Barrie Loeks , co-chairman of Sony Theaters , which operates at 175 locations in 15 states . &quot; The message we ' re getting from our customers is they want the low fat . The drop gave us enough cause for concern that we ' ve made the change to canola oil. &quot; Yet not all popcorn sales were off . A number of exhibitors said the decline was highest in the urban_centers and art houses and not even noticeable where action and broad comedy movies were playing . Said one , &quot; You could see no difference at theaters where the futuristic-prison breakout story ' No Escape ' was playing , but there was a drop at the romantic film ' Four Weddings and a Funeral. ' &quot; * Some theatergoers seemed totally unfazed when queried about the issue . Musician Sage Guyton of Los Angeles was at the Cineplex Odeon Fairfax , where corn is popped_in coconut_oil . &quot; If you like it , then I say do_it , &quot; Guyton said . At the same theater , student Catherine Howard said she would not be deterred . &quot; I ' m going_to buy popcorn because it ' s the movies ! &quot; Stephanie Cornelison , who works_at Mann Theaters in Valencia , recounted how a woman approached the concession counter and declared : &quot; I ' m outraged that you put all that fat in your popcorn when you don ' t have to &quot; -- and then ordered a large popcorn . Before the results of the nutrition survey were announced , about 70 % of the nation ' s theaters popped their corn using higher-in-saturated-fat coconut_oil , which produces the familiar , good smelling aroma Americans have been used to for decades when they enter the lobby of a movie_theater . With this week ' s modifications , closer to 50 % use coconut_oil , with the other half using a version of canola oil or air-popped corn . that ' s because of changes by the nation ' s biggest theater chains : Denver-based United Artists Theater Circuit , the largest with 2 # 300 theaters across the country , will continue using coconut_oil but will also sell air-popped corn . The other two , Kansas City-based AMC Theaters and New York-based Sony Theaters , formerly known as Loews , will switch from coconut_oil to canola oil . They are joined by a number of smaller chains , including Orange County-based Edwards Cinemas , which has already converted to canola oil . James Edwards Sr. , head of the Edwards circuit , said his theaters use less oil when they cook with canola , which he claims results in better-tasting popcorn . For the next week , Edwards Newport theater and a new 12-plex in La Verne will conduct taste tests where customers can sample coconut_oil versus canola oil . Edwards , 87 , and the dean of Southern California ' s exhibitors , said that as soon as he learned of the fat contents , he decided to change . &quot; We ' re all interested in our health , &quot; he said . * It was the same for Philip Singleton , the chief operating officer of AMC theaters , who runs 30 to 50 miles each week . &quot; I had no idea I was putting all that fat into my body . The study prompted us to look_at this as a social issue. &quot; Jayne Hurley of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said she has been overwhelmed by the response to the study . &quot; People are talking_about it . And we ' re thrilled that the nation ' s theater operators are taking these steps so quickly. &quot; A number of exhibitors from around the country are discussing the issue today at a board_meeting of the National Assn . of Theater Owners in Boston . But the story doesn ' t end there . Optimistic commodities market traders are buying_up canola futures , traded on the Winnipeg Commodity_Exchange . According to Rochelle Atlas Maize , a commodities broker at Smith Barney Shearson in Beverly Hills , the price of canola futures has risen &quot; substantially &quot; since April 25 -- the day the center issued its report .</TEXT>
