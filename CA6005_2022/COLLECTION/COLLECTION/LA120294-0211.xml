   <HEADLINE> TERRORIST WHO KILLED 3 GIS FREED ; GERMANY : RED ARMY FACTION MEMBER IRMGARD MOELLER , 47 , RELEASED FROM LUEBECK PRISON AFTER 22 YEARS . U.S. PROTESTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Irmgard Moeller was imprisoned for life 22 years ago for the murder of three U.S. soldiers , the Cold_War was in full force , the Vietnam_War still raged , and then-Chancellor Willy Brandt ' s &quot; Ostpolitik &quot; recognized what seemed to be a terminally divided Germany . The 47-year-old Red Army Faction terrorist -- Germany ' s longest-serving female prisoner -- walked free into a different world Thursday , a physically changed woman whose &quot; anti-imperialist &quot; views apparently remain much the same . &quot; It ' s all still a bit unreal , &quot; Moeller said as she was released in the Baltic Coast city of Luebeck . &quot; A lot of people are going_to ask how I survived all this time . I kept alive the aims for which I fought and felt the support of my sympathizers. &quot; Her first view of the 1990s , an era of the single superpower that trades with an increasingly capitalist Vietnam , was punctuated by scores of supporters waving red flags , singing 1960s anti-war songs and chanting &quot; Freedom for all political_prisoners &quot; in reunified Germany . The U.S. State_Department protested her release on probation . &quot; While we recognize the independence of German courts , we are disappointed that an unrepentant terrorist who murdered three U.S. soldiers has been freed from prison , &quot; the department said in an official statement . &quot; Prior to this parole , the U.S. formally reiterated to the government of Germany our view that convicted terrorists should serve their full prison terms. &quot; But the German government has made a tentative peace with the Red Army Faction , which is blamed for about 50 deaths in attacks on U.S. , NATO and German business and political targets during a 20-year campaign against &quot; imperialism and monopoly capitalism. &quot; Moeller ' s release could set the stage for the release of seven other Red Army prisoners who have served at least 15 years of their life sentences . Moeller was convicted of driving one of two car_bombs into the U.S. Army headquarters in Heidelberg on May 24 , 1972 , in protest of what she claimed was American genocide in Vietnam . The blast killed Capt . Clyde R . Bonner and soldiers Charles L . Peck and Ronald A . Woodward . Then a striking 25-year-old with long , dark hair and bangs , Moeller was arrested six weeks after the attack and was eventually sentenced to life in prison plus 15 years . In jail , Moeller refused to undergo psychiatric evaluations to determine whether she is still dangerous , and the German magazine Der Spiegel quoted her in 1992 as saying that &quot; the armed struggle was legitimate. &quot; Nonetheless , earlier this month a court in the state of Schleswig-Holstein , where the prison is , decided that she is no longer a threat to society and ordered early parole for reasons of poor health . The woman who emerged from jail in jeans and a black leather jacket had long , graying hair and an age-lined face . She was pale and said to be suffering from heart and skin ailments and other problems stemming from 12 hunger_strikes during her incarceration . The daughter of devout Roman_Catholics , Moeller was a middle-class university_student in Munich when she moved from political protests to left-wing extremism in 1971 , joining the underground Baader-Meinhof gang , which was soon renamed the Red Army Faction . Among the group ' s attacks were a 1975 assault on the German Embassy in Stockholm , in which four people were killed , and a 1979 attempt to murder Alexander Haig , who was then NATO commander . The Red Army Faction received support from the Communist government in East_Germany and got help securing training from Palestinian terrorist groups . After the Berlin Wall fell_in 1989 , it was discovered that about 10 former members of the group had been living there under new identities . German officials are still looking_for a handful of Red Army Faction members accused of violent crimes . In 1992 , the Red Army Faction issued a statement that it would no longer attack &quot; leading representatives of the economy and state. &quot; In response , the justice minister called_for reconciliation with the group .</TEXT>
