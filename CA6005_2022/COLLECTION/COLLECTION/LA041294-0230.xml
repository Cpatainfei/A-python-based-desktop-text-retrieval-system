   <HEADLINE> KURT COBAIN , 1967-1994 ; THE LAST DAYS OF A LOST SOUL ; SUICIDE : COURTNEY LOVE , FRIENDS HAD BEEN TRYING TO GET NIRVANA ' S LEADER INTO A DRUG RECOVERY PROGRAM SINCE HIS MARCH OVERDOSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kurt Cobain ' s suicide at his house here last week was simply the final step_in a sad and lonely death march that began weeks before in a hotel_room in Rome . Despite attempts by aides to publicly portray as accidental the rock singer ' s drug-induced coma March 4 in Rome , the overdose was in fact another suicide attempt -- complete with a note , according to sources close to the situation who asked not to be identified . One source said the leader of the rock_group Nirvana swallowed 60 pills . Details of the note were not available . That incident -- which left the singer in a coma for nearly 24 hours -- led Cobain ' s wife , singer Courtney Love , his band mates and others who work with the band into an intensive campaign to persuade the most acclaimed rock_star of his generation into again getting treatment for drugs and depression . But Cobain resisted their efforts , sources close to Cobain ' s family said here Sunday . &quot; It was a classic case of denial , &quot; said one of the sources . &quot; Classic and terribly , terribly sad. &quot; In the portrait painted by the sources , Cobain -- a quiet , sensitive young_man who was left scarred by an unhappy childhood and was uncomfortable with his rock stardom -- didn ' t take drugs in the stereotypical , party-minded &quot; sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll &quot; style . * Rather , he took the drugs -- low-level opiates or tranquilizers , and at times heroin -- to block_out the depression and to calm stomach pains that plagued him for years and were aggravated by the strain of touring . &quot; You ' ve got_to understand , I need relief every once in a while , &quot; a source quoted Cobain as saying frequently in reference_to the drugs . Within days of returning from Rome to the couple ' s home overlooking Lake Washington near Seattle , Cobain was reportedly turning again to heroin . Then , on March 18 , at the couple ' s two-story , $ 1.1-million house , Cobain locked himself in a room , and Love told police she feared a suicide . Police found three pistols , a rifle and 25 boxes of ammunition . Police_officers said Cobain told them he had locked himself in the room after an argument with Love , and denied that he was suicidal . Police confiscated the weapons , but no arrest was made . During that weekend , several people close to Cobain -- including his wife and bassist Krist Novoselic from Nirvana -- confronted the singer about his drug use in hope of persuading him of the urgency of getting professional help . The intervention didn ' t work -- and it was this flare-up that apparently led to reports that the group had broken_up . &quot; He is in so_much denial about a drug problem that it ' s unbelievable , &quot; a friend said following the intervention attempt . * When Love went_to Los Angeles on March 25 to go_over final details connected with the release of the new album by her band , Hole , she urged Cobain to come_with her and to check_into a recovery program . Cobain remained here , but Love pleaded with him daily to join her in Los Angeles and to seek help . She warned that child_welfare_agencies might take_away their 19-month-old daughter , Frances Bean , if they learned about the severity of his condition . The couple was threatened with such action in 1992 after Love was quoted in a Vanity_Fair article about taking heroin while pregnant . Cobain finally gave_in to Love ' s urgings and on March 28 went_to Marina del Rey , where he enrolled in Exodus , a recovery program affiliated with Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital . It was the first sign of hope in weeks , those close to the couple say . Love was elated . &quot; I was so proud_of him , &quot; she told a friend last week . But the optimism was short-lived . Three days later , he suddenly left the facility without warning . In a panic , Love hired private_investigators to find him . The trail stretched to Seattle , but the investigators apparently weren ' t able to locate him . &quot; I ' m just really afraid for him right now , &quot; Love told a friend early last week , adding that Cobain suffered from &quot; suicidal depression. &quot; She told friends about a history of suicide and manic_depression in his family . Two of his uncles committed suicide , she said . As Cobain ' s disappearance stretched from four to five to six days , she became increasingly frightened . Reports of his behavior were sketchy , but alarming . One report had him buying a shotgun and calling a friend to ask the best way to shoot yourself in the head . Other reports had him searching for drug dealers in the Seattle area . Mostly , however , he was a shadow . He wasn ' t visible around town or at the house . A sleeping bag found at a second house the couple owns in the area led to speculation he might have spent a night there . As it turned_out , the case was solved not by the investigators but by an electrician who found Cobain ' s body when he went_to do some repair work_on the couple ' s house Friday morning . Contrary to widely published reports that she had left Los Angeles for London where Hole had a concert scheduled ( but earlier canceled ) , Love was in Los Angeles when she learned about the death . She left immediately for Seattle and went directly to the house , where she was joined by relatives , friends and fellow musicians , including Kim Deal of the Breeders and members of_her_own band . It was at the home on Sunday morning that Love taped the message that was played to fans at the public memorial that evening -- the message that contained excerpts from the suicide note left by her husband . The message spoke_of Cobain ' s loss of enthusiasm for life and for music . But it will still be hard for Nirvana fans to understand the severity of the depression that pushed Cobain to take his life -- just as it is hard now for his family and friends to understand why all their efforts weren ' t enough to save him . But the degree of Cobain ' s pain is evident in something he said in &quot; Come as You Are : The Story of Nirvana , &quot; a recent biography of the band by Michael Azerrad . While he said he kept the guns for protection , he called them evil things . &quot; I shot a gun with ( a friend ) about a year ago , &quot; he recalled . &quot; We went_down to Aberdeen and went_out in the woods and shot this gun and it was just such a reminder of how brutal they are , how much damage they can do to a person. &quot; To have put a shotgun to his head while having the visual picture of such damage suggests a pain far greater than any anger and alienation even his family grasped .</TEXT>
