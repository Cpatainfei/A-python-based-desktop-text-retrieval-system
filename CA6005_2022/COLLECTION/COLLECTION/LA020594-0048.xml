   <TEXT> In taking the first_step this week toward normal relations with Vietnam , President Clinton has struggled with a dilemma as old as war itself : how to reconcile with a former battlefield enemy . For combatants at any point in human history , the path from the end of war to the beginning of peace has rarely been smooth . And yet nations repeatedly have made the journey -- sometimes reluctantly , often ambivalently , almost always in pursuit of a newly defined national goal , like the economic opportunities Vietnam now presents to U.S. business . History records exceptions , of course : Rome settled the third Punic War in 146 BC by razing the city of Carthage , enslaving all 50 # 000 of its residents and sowing the earth with salt . But more typically , even nations that have bled each other dry in wartime -- France and Germany in both World_Wars , China and Japan in World_War_II -- eventually find ways to put the past behind them and resume active relations with the former foe , more often sooner than later . Less than five years after Adolf Hitler ' s army was driven from Paris in August , 1944 , France and Germany were sworn to each other ' s defense as charter_members of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . By those historic standards , many analysts consider the 19 years it has taken the United States and Vietnam to resume even commercial relations excessive . &quot; The probability is that this ( delay ) will be seen as a very unusual event in the history of diplomatic relations , &quot; said Yale_University historian Paul M . Kennedy , author of &quot; The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. &quot; History suggests that the most difficult wars to move past are those that divided a nation at_home . Consider the case of the reconciliation-minded group of Confederate veterans who sought to raise funds for a statue of Ulysses S . Grant , the Union general who later served as President , in Richmond 37 years after the Civil War ' s end . &quot; The fund , &quot; writes historian Michael Kammen , &quot; fizzled at $ 16. &quot; More recently , the closest parallel to America ' s lingering agonies over Vietnam may be France ' s efforts to come_to terms with its former colony in Algeria . After more_than 100 years of colonial control , an uprising by Algerian nationalists beginning in 1954 sparked a bloody war that bitterly divided France and eventually forced Charles de Gaulle to negotiate independence for Algeria in 1962 . Although the result was -- like the Vietnam_War for America -- a tremendous blow to national esteem , the_French government immediately recognized its former colony and made_it the largest recipient of French foreign_aid . &quot; De Gaulle was absolutely determined to make Franco-Algerian cooperation a model for post-colonial connections , &quot; said Stanley Hoffmann , chairman of the Center for European Studies at Harvard_University . The result , though , has been more ambiguous . At the government level , while never suffering the &quot; deep_freeze &quot; that has characterized U.S.-Vietnamese relations , France and Algeria have frequently squabbled over issues such_as oil and immigration , Hoffmann said . Today , France appears torn over how to respond to a violent insurrection by Islamic militants against Algeria ' s military-backed junta . At the social level , relationships between the two countries &quot; didn ' t exist , &quot; said Dominique Moisi , deputy director of the_French Institute for International Relations in Paris . &quot; That has been a very difficult reconciliation process , because the_French are not entirely reconciled with their own history in Algeria . The process is not only reconciliation with the other but yourself . The French have still not come_to terms with what we did wrong. &quot; That psychological struggle may be the point at which the_French experience in Algeria most precisely illuminates the American anguish over Vietnam . If there is one constant to this process of peace-making in modern times , it is that nations have moved quickly to repair relations when they had a compelling reason to do so and let animosities fester when they did not . In determining the pace of reconciliation , assessments of future gains consistently seem to exert more influence than resentments over past losses . Put another way , it is not the ferocity of the war but the potential benefits of the peace that guides how quickly nations bury their differences . &quot; The natural impulse , &quot; said Robert Dallek , a diplomatic historian at UCLA , &quot; is to consult your interest. &quot; Seen_through this lens , many believe that a principal reason for the long gap in relations with Vietnam may have been the absence , until recently , of an irresistible reason to move faster -- especially given the fear among officials that moving to a normal relationship would provoke recriminations from Americans still angry over the issues that made the war so bitterly divisive . &quot; Because there was no overriding imperative to do this and there were all these other negative factors , there was perceived to be no reason to push it , &quot; said Asia scholar Alan Romberg , director_of_research at the U.S. Institute for Peace , an independent federal institution . This hard-headed assessment of costs and benefits fits the tradition of postwar rapprochement in modern times . Before the 20th Century , the major European powers displayed a bifurcated approach to reconciliation , said Paul Kennedy , who has studied the evolution of great_power relations . Generally , the major European powers -- among them Britain , France , Prussia and Russia -- believed that cultural , racial and religious differences precluded lasting reconciliation after war with nations such_as the Ottoman Empire that were outside &quot; the concert of Europe , &quot; Kennedy said . But in their dealings with each other during that period , the great_powers changed partners from war to war as casually as dancers at a ball . &quot; There was the assumption that national interest prevailed and you shouldn ' t have the hang-up of worrying about who you fought with in the last war , &quot; Kennedy said . In 1848 , British Foreign Secretary ( and later Prime_Minister ) Lord Palmerston turned this sentiment into an enduring epigram : &quot; We have no eternal allies and we have no perpetual enemies . Our interests are eternal and perpetual , and these interests it is our duty to follow. &quot; In the 20th Century , the divide in attitudes toward reconciliation with Western and non-Western powers has not held as firmly . But Palmerston ' s compass continued to guide the process of making_peace with old enemies , with states again placing primary weight on calculations of national self-interest rather than revenge or contrition . Thus , after World_War I , fear of a renascent Germany led the_French to pursue peace terms aimed at crippling its rival . But the United States and eventually Great Britain saw Germany as a potential bulwark against rising Soviet power and ultimately sought to bolster the defeated Germans by lightening the load of reparations . After World_War_II , a different calculation of national interest dictated an even swifter American reconciliation with Germany and Japan , even though U.S. losses were far greater than in World_War I and the barbarism exhibited by the defeated nations had been as savage as any in recorded history . Moreover , almost 80 # 000 U.S. soldiers remained missing in action at the end of World_War_II , compared to about 2 # 300 in Vietnam . And yet , with the Cold_War looming , those natural resentments were chaff in the search for allies against the Communist states . &quot; At that time , we in the United States thought it was to our interest to have Germany and Japan on our side rather than leaving them to the Russian side , &quot; said veteran U.S. diplomat Paul H . Nitze . &quot; There was just a perfectly obvious competition for both sides to pick_up the pieces. &quot; Japan behaved no differently after its defeat . Through the 1960s , Japan bristled_at the U.S. refusal to allow it to resume relations with China and eagerly pursued closer economic ties with its giant neighbor . But at_the_same_time , it took enormous American pressure on Japan and South_Korea -- nations with less lucrative stakes in reconciliation -- to compel them to resume formal relations in 1965 , 20 years after Korea was liberated from Japanese control . &quot; With China , the Japanese had a real requirement from their point_of_view to put things on a more normal basis , &quot; Romberg said . &quot; Korea does not loom as large for Japan , therefore the imperative to move toward ( reconciliation ) was not as great. &quot; Similarly , In the case of the United States and Vietnam , the absence of great strategic or economic interest in reconciliation -- at least until recently -- has clearly slowed the process . But , as with the_French in Algeria , other factors were also in_play . But to most analysts , tangible concerns have influenced relations between the two nations less than the war ' s psychological legacy . Although Americans actually have expressed relatively little lingering animosity toward the Vietnamese -- even in the movie &quot; Rambo , &quot; the Vietnamese still holding U.S. servicemen are only fronts for the Soviets -- the divisions within America about the war remain lacerating after two decades . Thus , many believe that one critical reason the United States has deferred the question of how to deal with Vietnam is reluctance to reopen the debate over what went_wrong there in the first place . In the end , that reluctance to disturb old wounds appears to have been swept_away primarily by a modern reinterpretation of Palmerston ' s rule : the fear of losing Vietnam as a potential ally , not in a military sense but rather in global economic competition . Ethnic tensions , like those on bloody display in the former Yugoslav federation , appear immune to that calculus . But , for most nations , the sort of division that long separated the United States and Vietnam may be rendered increasingly anachronistic by the economic forces that finally forced them together . &quot; Countries have more immediate impact on each other_than they used to , particularly as the economic barriers come_down , &quot; Romberg said . &quot; The changes in the way nations and people interact are pushing people in the direction of ( quicker ) reconciliation. &quot;</TEXT>
