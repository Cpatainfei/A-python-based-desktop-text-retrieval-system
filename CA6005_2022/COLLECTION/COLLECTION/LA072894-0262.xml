   <HEADLINE> RELIEF STARTS MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR REFUGEES ; AFRICA : RWANDANS IN ZAIRE RECEIVE CRITICAL SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND MEDICINE . SOME AID EVEN COMES FROM SOMALIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One camp is in a sports center , the other in a rocky field . Each is swamped with sick and dying Rwandans . And both received desperately needed medical help from the outside world Wednesday . There the similarities end . The Goma Cercle Sportif houses 2 # 400 ill and wounded soldiers , officers and political agents of the former Rwandan army , a force accused of widespread atrocities as it fought and lost a civil_war to prop_up a murderous regime . Down the road , the S.O.S. Orphanage houses nearly 4 # 000 Rwandan children whose parents were killed or have disappeared . From 6 months to 10 years old , the lonely children are among the saddest victims of the war . Indeed , it is a measure of the chaos and misery here that the United Nations Children ' s Fund ( UNICEF ) rushed an 11-member anti-cholera team and four tons of supplies to the orphanage from a country better known for receiving emergency aid than for sending it : Somalia . Thanks to round-the-clock relief flights and to a growing lifeline of truck convoys , critical supplies of food , medicine and other emergency goods are finally pouring into Goma , hub of the global effort to aid an estimated 1.2 million Rwandans who flooded across the border almost two weeks ago . As a result , more specialized aid is going_to groups largely overshadowed or forgotten until now . The Israeli military , for example , arrived Monday to erect a 250-bed field_hospital on the shores of Lake Kivu . But the 50 Israeli doctors , nurses and technicians will treat few refugees and focus instead on helping residents of this once-obscure border town . Thousands of Zairians , even prisoners in the city jail , have been stricken by the still-raging cholera epidemic that is now killing an estimated 1 # 800 refugees a day . Goma is considered the center of the epidemic . Other humanitarian aid goes_to a little-known walled camp specifically set_up for thousands of ethnic Tutsis who fled Rwanda before the current crisis . They are kept separate from the other refugees for understandable reasons . Up to half a_million civilians , mostly Tutsis , were butchered by the majority Hutu army and civilian militias after the country ' s Hutu president died April 6 in a still unexplained plane crash . But when the Hutu army was routed by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front , the Hutu population and their leaders fled in fear . Now members of the exiled government and militias are regrouping in the refugee camps . They are largely responsible_for distributing the hundreds of tons of food brought_in each day by relief groups . Some of the aid finally reached the Rwandan soldiers at the sports center Wednesday . But more_than 1 # 000 of the wounded already had died . A rutted tennis_court was turned_into an open-air morgue , and gaunt bodies in tattered uniforms were dumped in rows awaiting burial . Inside a small building were piles of crates from Norway ' s Red_Cross . Dr. Halvor Fossum Lauritzsen supervised as the dark , dank rooms were mopped so they could house a mobile surgical hospital , complete with two operating_theaters . Lauritzsen said surgical teams expect to operate_on about 40 soldiers daily . &quot; we ' ll deal mostly with gunshot wounds , &quot; he said . &quot; They are badly infected with gangrene . There ' s going_to be a lot of amputations. &quot; Nina Winqvist , a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red_Cross here , said her organization ' s mandate is to treat all those wounded or affected by war , not just civilians . &quot; It is a very dangerous path to start moralizing in war , to say who is good , who is bad , who should live and who should die , &quot; she said . &quot; That is not for the Red_Cross to say. &quot; Down the road , new aid also appeared at the orphanage , which is set_on a rocky field pitted by ravines and straggly patches of cassava . The 11-member UNICEF team bustled_about in white T-shirts , but Awilhagil Ali , a Somali public health officer , stopped to shake his head . &quot; The conditions here are worse than in Somalia , and the population is much larger , &quot; he said , referring to last year ' s international operation to feed Somalia ' s starving population . Said Ahmad , a Somali hydrologist , agreed as he worked nearby . &quot; In Somalia , at least we had coordination . Here there is no coordination. &quot; Steffan de Mistura -- the UNICEF representative in the Somali capital , Mogadishu , and head of the anti-cholera team -- said far more refugees are crowded together here without proper housing or sanitation than during the Somalia crisis . And many are already sick and exhausted by the long trek from Rwanda and the horrible conditions in the camps . &quot; The good news is here we are not being shot at , &quot; he said with a grin . He said the members of his medical team wear bulletproof_vests in Mogadishu for protection from the country ' s fratricidal clan wars . Still , four young Hutu men had approached the camp earlier and demanded entry , De Mistura said . &quot; One man said he had a grenade . We said they can ' t come_in , or over our dead_bodies . They got very agitated and said they ' ll be back . But we ' ve been too busy to worry about it. &quot; De Mistura said about 20 % of the children at the camp have cholera and that 58 had died so far . &quot; The situation is appalling , &quot; he said . &quot; But I believe it will change in the next three days. &quot; He said the team will dig six latrines and that UNICEF trucks will bring clean drinking_water twice a day . Since chlorine kills the cholera bacteria , shallow wells of chlorinated water will be dug outside for the children and camp workers to step_in . UNICEF ' s four doctors joined three already here , giving the children far more medical attention than other refugees . About 20 newly arrived children were immunized Wednesday for measles and polio , and screened by a doctor . A dozen others lined_up to be washed , while a crowd of half-naked children waited with plastic cups at a feeding center for steaming dollops of high-protein gruel . Dozens sat on the ground in a tent , clapping their hands as an animated man sang to them through a bullhorn . Others wandered about in freshly washed donated clothes . Scores of new white canvas_tents stood_in the sun , a carpenter sawed away noisily and boys laughed as they played in the water that gushed from a ripped hose . Even Dr. Lalani Nimet , the ever-harried camp doctor who has seemed to work in perpetual motion during the past week , slowed from a run to a fast walk as she talked . For the first time , she even smiled . &quot; It ' s OK now , &quot; she said with a grin . &quot; We ' ve got doctors , nurses , food and water . I ' m feeling on holiday today. &quot;</TEXT>
