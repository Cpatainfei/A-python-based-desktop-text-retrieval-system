   <HEADLINE> RECORD RACK : IN BRIEF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ice_Cube , &quot; Bootlegs &amp; B-Sides , &quot; ( * * ) Street Knowledge / Priority . Did we really need a remix of Ice_Cube ' s weakest single to date , &quot; You Know How We Do It &quot; ? This lackluster , partly superfluous collection includes B-sides , remixes and three new songs , but only one of the new ones , the fiery &quot; You Don ' t Wanna ---- With These , &quot; comes_close to Cube at his best . New albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) , two stars ( fair ) , three stars ( good ) and four stars ( excellent ) . Heidi Siegmund</TEXT>
