   <HEADLINE> AROUND THE VALLEY : FEEDING THE BODY AND FEEDING THE SPIRIT , THE REST OF THE YEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every year , right around this time , something strange starts to happen . We remember that people have to eat -- and we feed them . From now until the holiday season ends , people who are poor , or homeless , or very ill , or very old and lonely will sit_down to festive turkey dinners held_in their honor or receive baskets of free food . Many of the needy eat well this time_of_year . Unfortunately , hunger has an annoying habit of showing_up at inopportune times -- like during the other 10 months of the year , when the Yuletide spirit has worn_off and most people have retreated to their own woes . The hungry will be hungry again after the Christmas lights have been packed up and the last strains of &quot; Auld Lang Syne &quot; have drifted away . And who feeds them then ? People like June Spahr of Granada Hills and Ada Robinson of Pacoima . This brisk autumn day , Spahr ' s white minivan is packed with her three kids , several bags of food and one reporter . Driving along the streets of Sun Valley , Spahr talks_about the people she has come_to know in her 2 1 / 2 years as a volunteer for Project Angel Food , a food-delivery service for homebound people with AIDS . &quot; Personally , if I ' m going_to reach_out to people , I do_it with food , &quot; she says after packing her van with specially prepared meals . &quot; So this is a natural for me. &quot; Often the people she takes food to are so ill they can ' t go grocery shopping , or cook for themselves , or even answer the front_door when she arrives . Some just want her to bring the food and leave . Others need to talk . &quot; that ' s what I like , &quot; she says . On days like this when they are not in school , her children ride along , helping to find the houses on the route sheet and taking turns carrying the food . Kristina , 11 , and 9-year-old twins D . J . and Garrett , sit in the back seats of the van talking_about people on the route like they were old friends . There ' s Bill , who once gave them a stuffed animal so big it would n ' t fit_in the van . There was David , who let them play hide-and-seek and slide_down the stairs in his house . That was fun , &quot; except you get carpet burn , &quot; Garrett said , smiling and rubbing his stomach . &quot; He made us a needlepoint , &quot; Kristina added . &quot; He was great. &quot; David died last year , around this time . &quot; I ' d asked him to give me something of his life to keep_in mine , &quot; Spahr said . &quot; It ' s hard , because you see a lot of people come and go. &quot; Sometimes by then , they have become more_than clients -- they are friends . And while the food brings them together , they are bound by much more . The people at Angel Food say they are always in need of volunteers who can deliver meals . But there is never a shortage of people who need help . Always there are new people to replace the ones who die -- new people who are ill and need food , too . When a new person is added_to Spahr ' s list , the first task is finding them . &quot; I can get lost in my driveway , &quot; Spahr laughs . &quot; Since I was small I have had no sense of direction. &quot; &quot; Seriously , &quot; Kristina agrees . &quot; My brothers and I are used to this. &quot; Spahr hopes that they will grow accustomed to other things too , like the idea of sharing &quot; the gifts of life. &quot; Their van stops in front of Mario ' s house and everybody gets_out . Mario is sitting in a recliner dressed in a robe with a scarf wrapped around his neck . Spahr hugs him . The children greet him . &quot; You look much better , &quot; she says . &quot; Do I really ? &quot; Mario asks . For 2 1 / 2 years June has delivered food to Mario , before the illness made him so weak and left him blind . She always stays to talk . &quot; She ' s the first , and the very best , &quot; Mario says . &quot; It ' s nice to have somebody to look_forward to. &quot; People who live_in the Hansen Dam area look_forward to Ada Robinson , who for five years has fed the homeless who sleep there . Everybody calls her Mother Robinson . She has arthritis , walks with a cane and speaks her truth plainly . At 83 , she can no longer lift the heavy pots she used to fill with black-eyed_peas and collard greens . But Mother Robinson can still give orders and after one conversation with her , you know people listen and obey . &quot; People tell me I ' m too old to be doing this , &quot; she said , standing in her Pacoima garage , filled with bread , canned goods and other food for the homeless that she solicits from donors . &quot; Listen , they didn ' t give me this job . I got news for you , God give me this job. &quot; So every Thursday , she does the job God gave her , driving_out to Hansen Dam with a_few helpers . On a small hill , they set_up shop . Leaning_on her wooden cane , she rattles_off the names of her faithful helpers , like Santa taking an elf roll_call . &quot; Aileen , she cooks for me , Ora , Hilda , Christine , Thelma , they all help , &quot; she said . &quot; Honey , I make it. &quot; &quot; Last week a lady come_up and she says , ' Oh , it ' s raining , it ' s raining , Mother Robinson , ' &quot; suggesting they shouldn ' t go_out with the weather so bad . &quot; I said , ' What ' s wrong with that ? ' I said , ' Ain ' t you gonna eat today ? Those folks gotta eat too. ' &quot; Every day . Thankfully there are people like the Spahr family and Ada Robinson , and organizations and churches who deliver meals and hope to people who otherwise would have neither , except maybe around the holiday season . There ' s something special about seeing the spirit of giving_in people ' s lives even when there ' s no holiday around . That should make us all feel merry .</TEXT>
