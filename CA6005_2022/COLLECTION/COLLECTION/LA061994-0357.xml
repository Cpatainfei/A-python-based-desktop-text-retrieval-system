   <HEADLINE> THE DEFINING CRISIS ; UNLESS U.S.-NORTH KOREA TALKS START SOON , WAR REMAINS AN OPTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just beyond the horizon looms what could be the final phase_in the ever-deepening crisis over North_Korea ' s nuclear-weapons program -- an end game of horrendous conflict resulting in massive destruction and loss of life that will make or break the Clinton presidency , define the future of the non-proliferation system and shape the geopolitics of East Asia . Former President Jimmy_Carter ' s mediation efforts have temporarily halted the downward spiral of action-reaction that was narrowing the choices to either retreat and acceptance of a nuclear North_Korea or a deadly confrontation . North_Korea ' s offer to Carter to freeze its nuclear program and to permit the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to continue monitoring its reactors reopens the still slim hope for a diplomatic solution . It is hard to overstate the gravity of the Korea problem . This is not Bosnia or Somalia or Haiti , human tragedies producing existential angst in the White_House seminars that pass for policy deliberations . We are not talking_about peacekeepers or immigration dilemmas . This is the real_thing : Korea involves vital national interests and has major regional and global consequences . In what should not be dismissed as mere rhetoric , Pyongyang warns that the U.N. sanctions the Administration is seeking to impose mean war . Yet , the Administration has barely begun to prepare the American public for the potential consequences of its policies . The showdown with North_Korea entered a dangerous new stage last month , when Pyongyang removed fuel rods from its 5-megawatt graphite reactor , thus deliberately destroying key evidence of its past nuclear activities . This willful rejection of its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations led the watchdog IAEA to refer the_matter to the U.N. Security_Council and to cut_off its technical assistance to North_Korea . That triggered Pyongyang ' s announced withdrawal from the IAEA . North_Korea has still not thrown_out two IAEA inspectors monitoring the fuel rods or destroyed the cameras and monitoring equipment at its Yongbyon nuclear complex . As revealed during conversations with Carter , Pyongyang is using those remaining shreds of accountability to bargain for a new round of talks with the United States . If North_Korea decides to separate the plutonium from the fuel rods , it could have enough for five or six bombs within the next two months . At this point , the only way to assess its past nuclear behavior -- whether Pyongyang does have enough plutonium for one or two bombs , as U.S. officials suspect -- would be to submit to intrusive special inspections as part of the diplomatic bargain . If North_Korea goes the final step and removes the IAEA inspectors and monitoring equipment , the worst-case will be seven or eight bombs -- with no basis for guesstimates . When you add in Pyongyang ' s crash effort to build new ballistic_missiles that can hit Japan and its penchant to export such missiles and nuclear material to other rogue states , such_as Iran or Libya , the gravity of the threat posed to international security becomes palpable . But would the application of U.N. sanctions change North_Korean behavior ? Not likely . As a general rule , carrots work better than sticks . The Administration ' s two-phase approach , with an initial , mild , slap-on-the-wrists sanctions resolution to take_effect after a grace period if Pyongyang does not cooperate , would probably gain Security_Council approval if a new diplomatic effort fails . But that would only buy more time for a final effort to resolve the issue . The bottom-line question is whether Pyongyang will trade its nuclear program for any package of political and economic blandishments , or whether the isolated regime regards its nuclear program as an ultimate insurance_policy ? By removing fuel rods from its reactor , it may be trying to have both the ambiguous status of a threshold nuclear_power and economic and political rewards . Pyongyang may seek a deal based on accepting the possibility that it may have one or two bombs in exchange for relinquishing further nuclear-weapons activities . The problem with the Clinton_Administration ' s policy is that , after 16 months of diplomatic cat-and-mouse , we still don ' t know if any deal is possible . Washington has yet to present North_Korea with a clear and precise incentive package , spelling out what is required to resolve the issue and how the United States , South_Korea and Japan would respond at each step if North_Korea forsakes its nuclear program . Any credible package must require Pyongyang to cooperate fully with the IAEA , dismantle its reprocessing facility and implement the denuclearization agreement it signed with South_Korea in December , 1991 . Washington should lift its trade_embargo , provide food aid and , along with Japan , offer diplomatic recognition . In addition , the United States , South_Korea and Japan should jointly devise a plan to decommission North_Korean nuclear_reactors in exchange for the financing and construction of more proliferation-resistant light-water reactors and other energy alternatives in a reciprocal step-by-step process . The Carter trip offers an important lesson to the White_House : For diplomacy to work , the highest-ranking Administration officials must deal directly with top leadership in Pyongyang . Returning to the bureaucratic routine of assistant-secretary-level talks will mean a return to petty haggling and game playing . Clinton should follow_up_on the Carter visit by sending a high-powered presidential envoy , a prominent figure with stature and bipartisan credibility , such_as Gen . Colin L . Powell , to Pyongyang with full authority to outline a road map for a peaceful resolution . This move should be accompanied by several other steps . The President must go_on television and explain to the American public -- and to Kim Il Sung -- the gravity of the situation , the stakes involved and the real danger of war or terrorism . At the same time , he must make_it clear to North_Korea that if it does invade the South , the U.S. and South_Korean war aims would be nothing less than reunification by force . If these two steps do not produce a serious , credible response from North_Korea within a defined time frame , the United States and its coalition partners should begin to put_in place full-scale sanctions -- banning all financial transactions , freezing overseas assets and an oil embargo . North_Korea will certainly respond -- perhaps , initially sponsoring terrorist acts against U.S. and Japanese targets . But the point would be to demonstrate we are serious about nuclear proliferation and acknowledge that if North_Korea refuses a reasonable deal , it mortgages its future and has chosen the path of confrontation . Finally , to be prudent , the United States should enhance its deterrent forces -- move more defensive systems in place and increase air_power and readiness in the region , as the Administration is already considering . If Clinton takes such steps , he will have done all that is possible to address a complex situation for which there may be no good answer . But anything less would be an abdication of U.S. leadership and result in a greater threat to international security . At the same time , a credible political solution of the Korea issue would go_a_long_way toward redeeming a foreign_policy that has begun to corrode the Clinton presidency. *</TEXT>
