   <HEADLINE> IRAQ ' S ARMS -- DON ' T TRUST , DO VERIFY ; U.N. SANCTIONS AGAINST OIL EXPORTS SHOULD BE LIFTED ONLY UNDER THE STRICTEST CONDITIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iraq ' s biggest money-earner is oil , but ever since the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War that nation has been under U.N. Security Council-imposed sanctions that have kept its oil from being sold on world markets and prevented hard currency from flowing into Baghdad ' s treasury . Those sanctions would be lifted , the council said 3 1 / 2 years ago , once it was clear that Iraq no longer posed a security threat to its neighbors , especially Kuwait , which Iraq invaded and brutally occupied in 1990 . Now the council has been told by Rolf Ekeus , the diplomat it put_in charge of monitoring Iraq ' s military status , that Saddam Hussein ' s regime has lost its capability to produce weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear , chemical or biological -- and that therefore the regional military threat it presents has been largely removed . Assuming the oversight system put_in place by the United Nations to make_sure Iraq doesn ' t cheat_on the weapons ban works , the council will probably be asked sometime next spring to allow Iraq once again to begin exporting oil . Under the right conditions -- and only under the right conditions -- the United States should support that request . A key condition is that Baghdad give_up its spurious claim that Kuwait is simply a lost province that Iraq has the right to reclaim by force . Kuwait is an internationally recognized sovereign country , as legitimate a political entity as Iraq itself , and Baghdad must recognize it as such , along with the redefined border between the two states that was fixed by the U.N. Boundary Commission in 1992 . A second condition is that Iraq agree to accept indefinite international monitoring of its imports , to prevent it from reacquiring the machinery and materials to rebuild its now liquidated unconventional weapons capability . An essential part of that oversight would be cooperation from all countries that do business with Iraq . Saddam Hussein ' s regime came perilously close to setting_up a nuclear_weapons industry because it was able to obtain massive amounts of needed technology from outside , often by deceit , sometimes with the compliance of suppliers and export-hungry governments . That can ' t be allowed to happen again . It of course remains a moral outrage that Hussein and his bloody-handed collaborators are still in power . But a change of government in Iraq was not a demand set by the Security_Council for lifting the sanctions . If Iraq is found no longer to be a threat to its neighbors , then the legal basis for the sanctions disappears . The foundation for that finding has now been laid , with a monitoring system to ensure Iraq doesn ' t rearm soon to be tested . If that system can be shown to work effectively , and with the additional conditions we noted above , the time will have come_to lift the sanctions .</TEXT>
