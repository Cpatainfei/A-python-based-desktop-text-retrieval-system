   <HEADLINE> DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER ; PLAYING GAMES IN HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Did you ever wish , when you were a kid , that you could play in a cave ? Olympic hockey_players are doing that in nearby Gjovik . About a third of the hockey_games are being played in the Gjovik Fjellhall -- it means mountain hall -- an amazing sports complex carved into a mountain . Well , the Norwegians call it a mountain , but it ' s more like a good-sized hill . Even so , except for the concrete mouths of the entrance tunnels , you could look_at the otherwise ordinary hill forever and never suspect there was anything under the surface but ground . Instead , an athletic wonderland -- a full-size international hockey rink with seating for 5 # 800 and an Olympic-size swimming_pool -- greet the visitor . The rink can also be used for figure_skating and curling , and , when it isn ' t a rink , track_and_field . The arena itself looks as modern as can be -- there are even VIP suites -- but the corridors and concourses carry_out the cave theme . The rock ceilings are sprayed with waterproof concrete and the rock walls are decorated with marble slabs of etched pictograms -- Viking ships , whales , moose , humans playing stickball_games -- reminiscent_of rock carvings . The ice arena , built at a cost of 134 million Norwegian_kroner -- more_than $ 18 million at the current exchange_rate -- is only the latest project in the continuing development of the underground center . Excavation actually was begun by German armed forces during World_War_II . They wanted an ammo dump safe from air_raids , so they built it into the_hill . The swimming_pool , normally open_to the public , came years later , and the ice hall was built once the ' 94 Winter Games had been awarded to Lillehammer . Because of low maintenance costs -- there are no windows to replace , no roof to repair -- the rink will have paid_for itself in 15 years , according to Bjorn Sandnes , the venue manager . Refrigeration costs are kept low , too , by the natural coolness of the cave and huge strips of reflective fabric stretched high over the rink , which bounce the escaping cold air back_down toward the ice . There are four entrance tunnels for public use , and one secret one for very private use . Workers blasting out the bedrock , carving the tunnels , making an arena out of the inside of a hill , thought they would get tickets to all_the events there . When they learned that wasn ' t the plan , they cut their own tunnel to an area high over the rink , where they put_in a bank of seats that will never be sold to the public . And now , even the International Olympic Committee can ' t keep them away . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
