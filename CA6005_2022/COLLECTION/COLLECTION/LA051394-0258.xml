   <HEADLINE> BLUE CROSS OFFERS PART OF WELLPOINT ; HEALTH_CARE : INSURER ' S PROPOSAL COMES IN RESPONSE TO STATE PRESSURE TO INCREASE CHARITABLE SPENDING . THE GOAL IS TO COMPENSATE TAXPAYERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Under state pressure to boost its charitable spending , Blue Cross of California said Thursday that it will donate 22.5 % of its ownership stake in its for-profit managed health_care organization to a nonprofit foundation . Blue Cross disclosed the proposal , which drew a lukewarm response from consumer advocates , after the state_Department of Corporations asked the Woodland Hills-based nonprofit insurer late last month to make at least $ 100 million in charitable donations this year and contribute at least 40 % of its stock in WellPoint Health Networks to a new foundation . The charitable contributions are related to last year ' s restructuring of Blue Cross , which created and sold shares_in WellPoint to operate most of its health_insurance programs . The contributions are meant to compensate Californians for the tax-exempt status Blue Cross enjoyed while building_up the health network . Blue Cross raised $ 517 million when it sold a 19.6 % stake in WellPoint in an initial public stock offering in January , 1993 . WellPoint includes Blue Cross ' CaliforniaCare health_maintenance_organization , its preferred provider organization and its dental and pharmacy plans . The formation of WellPoint allowed Blue Cross to raise capital to continue to pay_for the charity work it has performed since its creation during the Depression . Blue Cross originally agreed to donate $ 100 million to charity over 20 years in a deal that was criticized by state legislators and consumer groups as undervaluing the tax-free benefits Blue Cross earned . The Department of Corporations , which oversees the conversion of nonprofit health_care plans to for-profit firms , now apparently shares that view . In a letter sent to Blue Cross directors last week , Department of Corporations Commissioner Gary S . Mendoza , said he &quot; did not believe any shareholder would accept a return on their investment that was comparable_to that proposed by ( Blue Cross ) . . . . I do not believe the minimum 1994 commitment I am seeking is unreasonable or would in any way undermine ( Blue Cross ' ) long-term viability. &quot; The effort to boost Blue Cross ' contribution pleased some critics . The proposal is &quot; certainly more in keeping with what the public benefit should have been , &quot; said Bob Fredenburg , a spokesman for state Sen . Art Torres ( D-Los Angeles ) , who had been critical of the original agreement . But Harry Snyder , a co-director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union , said the new proposals still fall_short . &quot; I ' m glad that Commissioner Mendoza is taking the steps he is taking , &quot; Snyder said . &quot; But they are not nearly enough . They ( Blue Cross ) don ' t have the right to continue holding_on to this money. &quot; Investors were also not pleased with Blue Cross ' proposal to divest some of its WellPoint shares . On the New York Stock_Exchange on Thursday , WellPoint shares fell $ 1.375 to close at $ 30.25. Based on Thursday ' s stock prices , Blue Cross ' 80 % ownership stake in WellPoint is worth $ 2.4 billion . The Class B WellPoint shares Blue Cross would donate under its proposal are valued at $ 363 million . In addition to donating 12 million WellPoint shares , Blue Cross would contribute $ 25 million to charities this year in addition to the $ 100 million it previously agreed to give over 20 years . Blue Cross said it does not plan to donate or sell any more of its WellPoint holdings . The $ 25 million contributions and future donations would come from existing revenue , a company spokesman said . The Department of Corporations has not yet responded to the Blue Cross proposal . A department spokeswoman said , &quot; We are working with them to put_forward and implement a strategy that meets their charitable obligations. &quot; Patrick Garner , senior_vice_president for Blue Cross , said negotiations over a new agreement began in February &quot; when we got a sense from the commissioner that the $ 100 million was not going_to be an acceptable number. &quot; CONTRIBUTIONS</TEXT>
