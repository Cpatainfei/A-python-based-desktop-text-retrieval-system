   <HEADLINE> MIGHTY DUCKS / ' 94- ' 95 PREVIEW ; DUCKS HOPE NEW FACES ENHANCE OVERALL PICTURE ; ANALYSIS : TALENTED ROOKIES KARIYA AND KARPOV RAISE EXPECTATIONS . BUT HOW WILL THEY MIX WITH VETERANS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nobody expected enough of the Mighty Ducks in their first season . This season , will everybody expect too_much ? Coach Ron Wilson ' s band of fringe players and unproven talents banned the E-word to fend_off the bad karma of expansion last season , then shared an NHL record with Florida for most victories by a first-year team ( 33 ) . They also finished with 71 points -- 10 points_out of the playoffs , and five ahead of the Kings -- and swept the two-game season series with the eventual Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers . Now that sterling rookies Paul Kariya and Valeri Karpov have arrived , along with help for a dismal power_play from Tom Kurvers , it ' s tempting to imagine they ' ll be much better . &quot; You look_at the talent out there , and we ' re making passes we would not normally make last year , &quot; said defenseman Bobby Dollas . &quot; I can ' t say we ' ll win the Stanley Cup or even make the playoffs . We ' re still building . But I look_around the dressing room , and compared to last year ' s team , we ' ve got a lot of talent. &quot; The test will be whether the Ducks can mix_in added skill and confidence without losing last season ' s disciplined work ethic -- which was the key to their season . &quot; I don ' t fear our work ethic will slacken at all , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; We have_young people who will add spark when the old guys are getting gray in the beard. &quot; The biggest question during the exhibition_season was simply when the season would start . Making the playoffs might be the season ' s goal , but General_Manager Jack Ferreira had another -- acknowledging NHL labor tension with a bit of gallows humor -- &quot; To play 84 games. &quot; Year 2 is sometimes a dicey season for expansion teams . Instead of improving , 10 of 19 have gotten_worse . &quot; I don ' t believe_in something called the sophomore jinx , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; Half the teams have done better their second year , half have done worse . It ' s like flipping a coin , half will be heads and half will be tails. &quot; The Winnipeg Jets , who joined the league from the World Hockey Assn . in 1979 , were 19 points worse in their second season . The biggest improvement was by the New York Islanders , who joined the league in 1972 and improved by 26 points their second season . Of course , it wasn ' t hard to get better . They were 12-60-6 in their first season . &quot; I think we ' ve improved our team . I think we should be better , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; But that ' s not taking_into_account that other teams will be_better too. &quot; A closer look_at the personnel : FORWARDS Left_wing Kariya , right_wing Karpov and center Anatoli Semenov transform the offense -- make that the first line -- from ugly_duckling to swan . Kariya appears ready to contend with Quebec ' s Peter Forsberg for the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year , and Karpov ' s maturity at 23 prepares him for a solid first year . Semenov was the Ducks ' best player last season before left wing Stu Grimson ' s accidental check dislocated his elbow and limited him to 20 of the last 55 games . If the sometimes delicate Semenov , 32 , stays healthy , his rookie linemates could lift him to his best season since coming_to the NHL in 1990 . It was the play of Karpov and rookie right_wing John Lilley that convinced management they could afford to trade right_wing Terry Yake -- the team ' s leading scorer in the first season with 52 points . The rest of the forwards -- who unlike the first line won ' t be allowed to slack_off on defense -- are being challenged to prove what they did last season was no fluke . It will also be crucial for them to maintain the grinding play and willingness to go_into the corners personified by former captain Troy Loney , who was traded to the New York Islanders for Kurvers in June . Center Bob Corkum fell a point shy of leading the team in scoring with 51 points -- 41 more points than his previous best -- when he severed a tendon in his foot late in the season . With his big_shot , solid two-way play and a more confident approach , he is penciled in as the second-line center . The Ducks are very high on him -- although like others around the NHL , they ' re waiting to see if he has a second 20-goal season to make_up their minds . Corkum shrugs : &quot; If I ' m not getting respect , I might be open more. &quot; Right_wing Joe Sacco is one of the 15 Ducks whose opportunity to play resulted in career highs last season . More important than his 37-point total was his red-hot 14-goal second_half . Center Stephan Lebeau ' s 80-point season in Montreal two seasons ago makes him the Duck with the best career high , but he didn ' t hit his stride in 22 games after being traded to the Ducks last season and will probably start the season as the third-line center . Left_wing Garry Valk can add scoring , and right_wings Todd Ewen and Grimson add punch . Bottom_line : Kariya and Karpov are big-time talents , but only Hartford , Tampa Bay and Ottawa scored fewer goals than Ducks last season . DEFENSE The Ducks ' success last season was almost entirely the result of solid , disciplined defense , with huge contributions from a stable of grinding forwards and terrific goaltending . That Bobby Dollas was plus-20 on an expansion team last season is an astounding statistic . That he ' s playing to increase his leverage in hopes of doubling his bargain-basement $ 275 # 000 salary should add a bit of interest to his season . Kurvers adds more offense than defense , as does rookie Oleg Tverdovsky , the second overall pick in June who will be brought along slowly , especially after missing most of the exhibition_season with a groin injury . With Sean Hill and Bill Houlder both elsewhere after summer trades , Wilson should have fewer postgame interviews when he ' s left steaming about defensemen getting caught up-ice -- but he also lost 66 points of scoring . The defensive workload falls to Dollas , veteran Ladouceur and Don McSween . David Williams and Robert Dirk are solid defensive blueliners . Bottom_line : The fact no Duck defenseman should overlook is that the four defenseman who had negative plus-minuses last season -- Houlder , Hill , Mark Ferner and Anatoli Fedotov -- are no longer in Anaheim . GOALTENDING Only eight teams in the NHL had goals-against averages under 3.00 and save percentages over . 900 last season , and the Mighty Ducks were one of them . They did_it with a tag-team effort from Guy Hebert , Ron Tugnutt and Mikhail Shtalenkov . But when Hebert won the coaches ' confidence , Tugnutt was traded and Hebert emerged as a front-line NHL goalie , winning a career-best 20 games and notching two shutouts . His goals-against average ( 2.83 ) , save-percentage ( .907 ) and games played ( 52 ) were also career highs . Wilson ' s words aside , Hebert is the No . 1 goalie going_into the season -- although Wilson has proved he will go_with whomever ' s playing better at the moment , as he did last season by unseating Hebert briefly in favor of Shtalenkov . With Wilson as cognizant as he is of the travel demands on a West Coast team , both goalies will play . Shtalenkov should be a first-rate backup -- and if Hebert falters , he ' ll push him . Though Shtalenkov appeared in only 10 games , his numbers were sterling -- a 2.65 goals-against average and a . 909 save-percentage with a 3-4-1 record . Bottom_line : Wilson will say 1-A and 1-B half_a_dozen times , but Hebert will prove his net worth again . SPECIAL TEAMS Kariya transforms both the power-play and the penalty-killing teams . The power_play was worst in the NHL last season and was so ineffective that at times it was hard to tell which team had the man advantage . Having Kurvers playing one of the points also helps , and 1994 first-round pick Tverdovsky might step_in at the other , though he ' ll be brought along slowly after missing most of the exhibition_season with a groin injury . The biggest differences , though , will result from the playmaking of Kariya and a healthy Semenov and the finishing touch of Karpov . The penalty-killers did diligent work last season , and ranked sixth in the league , and it will take work not to slip . The difference this season should be in shorthanded goals . The Ducks had nine all last season . With his open-ice speed and anticipation , Kariya could approach that many by himself . Bottom_line : Power_play will be better , still not stellar , but the real excitement will come_with Kariya killing penalties .
