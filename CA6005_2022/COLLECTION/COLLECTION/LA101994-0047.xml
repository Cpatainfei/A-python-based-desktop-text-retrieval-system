   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL TURNS PEACE HOPES TO SYRIA ; MIDEAST : OFFICIALS ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT TREATY WITH JORDAN WILL SPUR TALKS . AMERICANS ' VISIT NEXT WEEK COULD BE PIVOTAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With peace agreements with the Palestinians and now Jordan , Israel is about to focus_on Syria , its most implacable foe among the Arabs , in pursuit of a full settlement of the Middle_East conflict . &quot; I want peace with Syria , &quot; Foreign Minister Shimon Peres declared Tuesday . &quot; I think we need to reach a comprehensive peace. &quot; Israel hopes that the treaty to be signed with Jordan next week will not only encourage Syria to accelerate negotiations , but that it will suggest solutions -- such_as Syria ' s lease back to Israel of territory it now occupies in the Golan Heights -- for the difficult problems the two countries face . There was a strong element of warning , however , in comments from Israeli officials and analysts , asserting that Syrian President Hafez Assad should move swiftly and decisively to ensure he is not left_out in the peacemaking . &quot; Jordan and the Palestinians are the inner core of peace with the Arabs , and Syria could find itself marginalized , isolated and even left completely behind as we move forward , &quot; said David Kimche , president of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations . &quot; The Syrians have the opportunity of finishing a good peace with ( Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak ) Rabin , and they need to know that this opportunity may_not be there forever. &quot; Syria would now become the target , other analysts said , of &quot; a push-pull strategy &quot; intended to bring it into serious bargaining with Israel . &quot; Will he get_the_best deal by being last ? &quot; Joseph Alpher , director of the Tel Aviv University ' s Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies , said of Assad . &quot; No , and we have to tell him so . Assad won ' t want to be seen as a follower , certainly not of Jordan and the Palestinians , but he doesn ' t want to miss the boat , either. &quot; Like the basic agreement a year ago with the Palestine Liberation Organization on Palestinian self-government , the treaty that Rabin concluded with King Hussein of Jordan this week has injected tremendous energy into the Middle_East peace process . &quot; The deal with the PLO sparked King Hussein to act lest he foreclose opportunities and lose his natural advantage in the region , and the same is now true of Assad , &quot; Alpher added , stressing the speculative nature of his comments . &quot; But I ' m far from certain that Assad will respond in the same way . I don ' t understand what he gains for Syria from remaining out of play. &quot; Israeli officials are hoping that U.S. leverage will come_into play in a major way next week and force a Syrian response . U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher is_due to visit Jerusalem and Damascus early in the week in_advance of President Clinton ' s trip to the Middle_East , and to offer Assad the prestige of a presidential visit -- the first to Syria in more_than 20 years -- if he breaks the stalemate in negotiations with Israel . Despite three years of U.S. mediation , those negotiations remain stalled on a series of major issues : the extent and timing of Israeli withdrawal in the Golan Heights , security guarantees such_as demilitarization , local intelligence systems and international peacekeepers and the character of Syrian-Israeli relations in the future . &quot; Assad has long wanted the U.S. President personally to serve as the mediator with Rabin , but to get that he will now have to put_up , &quot; a ranking Israeli diplomat said . Assad , however , gave no indication Tuesday of any softening of his demand for a total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights , occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War , as basis for peace -- and for his insistence on an Israeli commitment to pull_out as the basis for treaty negotiations . The Syrian president dismissed as &quot; apostasy , &quot; much like a person forsaking his religion , the idea of a nation leasing its own land to a neighbor -- a crucial element of the Jordanian-Israeli settlement that will allow Israeli farmers to continue cultivating territory under Jordanian sovereignty . &quot; Anyone who dreams or imagines that Syria would rent its land is shamefully wrong and making a major mistake , &quot; Assad said after a meeting in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . &quot; If people adopt this theory , it will lead to the opposite of peace. &quot; Assad also criticized Hussein for making a separate peace with Israel , but pledged that Syria would do nothing to upset the treaty . &quot; We can put_up obstacles , and everybody knows that , &quot; Assad said . &quot; But this will only hurt us as Arabs. &quot; In Amman , Prime_Minister Abdul Salam Majali defended Jordan ' s decision to make_peace with Israel , saying it could not wait for other Arab states . &quot; Unfortunately , Arab coordination proved futile , &quot; he said , &quot; and it was rather useless to wait for others. &quot; Asked about rumors of secret Syrian negotiations with Israel , Assad said in Cairo that no agreements had been reached in any forum . &quot; We are still at the stage of feeling each other ' s pulses , &quot; he said . But Yossi Olmert , a leading Israeli analyst and former government spokesman , argued strongly that most of the basic negotiations had already been conducted . &quot; Rabin has to gauge Israeli political opinion , to decide whether to proceed with a referendum on the Golan Heights or go_to early elections or a referendum or whatever , &quot; Olmert said , &quot; and from that will flow the compromises that will be made on the Golan Heights . The decision lies_with Rabin , not Assad. &quot; Olmert and other Israeli analysts read the treaty with Jordan as diminishing Syria ' s room for maneuver , applying pressure for it to come_to terms with the Jewish state after nearly 50 years of hostility , but also clearing the way for an agreement once Assad feels he has a deal .</TEXT>
