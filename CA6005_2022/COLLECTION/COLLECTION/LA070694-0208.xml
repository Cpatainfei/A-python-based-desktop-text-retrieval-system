   <TEXT> Artificial knee_joints that last a lifetime . . . automotive bearings that never wear_out . . . industrial machinery with surfaces so hard they ' re almost immune to damage . Wishful thinking ? Scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , the University of Wisconsin and General Motors think not . Using a particle_accelerator first built for the New Mexico lab ' s effort to develop small magnetic fusion_reactors for space , the three organizations are trying to develop large-scale applications for a process known as ion implantation . Nuclear engineer John Conrad of the University of Wisconsin invented the process a decade ago , but until recently it was applicable only to very small items , such_as ball_bearings . Conrad is working with the lab and GM under a $ 14-million program to revamp ion implantation to industrial applications . The large accelerator at Los Alamos is being used to see if equipment weighing several tons can be treated with the process . Ion implantation is not just another way of coating a piece of equipment . It alters the outer layer in such a way that it produces an incredibly hard_surface . The target is placed inside the accelerator ' s vacuum_chamber , and the chamber is flooded with gas at low_pressure . Oscillating radio_waves strip the gas atoms of electrons , producing positively charged particles , or ions . Short pulses of negative_charges are applied to the target , attracting the ions like a huge magnet . The ions strike the target with such force that they bury themselves in the surface of the target , physically and chemically transforming the outer thousandth of an inch into a much harder material . That could extend an object ' s life span as much as a hundredfold , researchers believe . LEE DYE</TEXT>
