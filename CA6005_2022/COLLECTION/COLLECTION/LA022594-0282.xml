   <HEADLINE> COLLAPSE OF A MEGA-MERGER ; DON ' T BLAME US ; ADMINISTRATION SAYS INFORMATION HIGHWAY STILL ON TRACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Clinton_Administration officials Thursday lashed_out at claims that their regulatory policies contributed to the unraveling of the Tele-Communications Inc. / Bell Atlantic Corp . merger , saying they remain committed to helping industry build a national information superhighway . &quot; The lack of two companies merging -- granted , very large companies -- should not have a significant effect on the development of an information highway , &quot; Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said . Some industry_analysts had speculated that the decision to cancel the $ 33-billion merger_agreement between the nation ' s largest cable company and the huge Philadelphia-based telephone concern might have been a gamble by the companies to embarrass the Administration into granting regulatory concessions to the beleaguered cable industry , which earlier this week was ordered by the government to roll back cable fees for the second time in a year . But the head of the federal agency that oversees the industry said there will be no backtracking on cable regulation . &quot; Whether or not they can agree on price is not our concern ; we are concerned with the public interest . . . and keeping cable prices at reasonable levels , &quot; said Reed E . Hundt , chairman of the Federal Communications Commission . Meanwhile , Sen . Howard M . Metzenbaum ( D-Ohio ) , a critic of the proposed merger who had threatened to introduce legislation to block it , said the deal ' s failure might even benefit cable TV and telephone_company customers . &quot; Forget what Bell Atlantic and TCI try to tell you ; the collapse of their deal is great news for consumers , &quot; he said . &quot; The end of their merger is . . . the beginning of a superhighway we can all afford to ride. &quot; The merger ' s collapse will intensify debate over what role the federal_government should play in overseeing an industry that the Administration has been encouraging to risk billions of dollars to build the so-called information superhighway . The Administration envisions a new technological infrastructure that would link individual Americans with schools , government and industry . Vice_President Al Gore , among other Administration officials , has said that a national information superhighway would help create thousands of jobs and boost American competitiveness . He also said such a network would improve education , medical knowledge and scientific_research by giving doctors , teachers , students and others in even the remotest and poorest communities of the nation electronic access to current data . In recent months , TCI President John C . Malone and Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond W . Smith told Capitol_Hill lawmakers and Wall_Street investors that they were willing to spend billions to build such a network . But they said they needed their combined financial resources to provide new telecommunications services . Many cable operators said Thursday that the failed merger was the starkest evidence yet that the Clinton_Administration is not interested in backing_up rhetoric about the information superhighway with political and regulatory support for industry . &quot; These two companies were among the most aggressive in espousing the wonders of the new communications superhighway and , to the extent the deal has fallen , I think you &quot; have to blame government regulation , said Amos B . Hostetter , chairman of Boston-based Continental Cablevision , which has 2.8 million subscribers . &quot; To have an FCC chairman say that this will have no effect on investment spending &quot; on the information highway &quot; is shocking and naive , &quot; Hostetter said . &quot; This is going_to give the financial community real pause. &quot; Despite the criticism , backers of at least one other big cable-telephone marriage -- Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. and Southwestern Bell Corp . -- said they will proceed with their plans to complete a $ 4.9-billion telecommunications joint_venture similar to the TCI / Bell Atlantic deal . They said the financial benefits of the proposal outweigh any regulatory restrictions on cable revenue . Enticed by predictions that Americans are prepared to spend tens of billions of dollars a year to watch movies , tap into databanks and video_games and keep_in touch by mobile phone , the telecommunications industry has been rushing to develop ground-breaking new technologies such_as high-definition television , digital radio , satellite and wireless communications services . The cellular_phone industry , for example , is adding more_than 1 # 000 customers a day . And Hughes Aircraft Co . and Hubbard Broadcasting have invested nearly $ 1 billion in a satellite venture that , starting this spring , will allow American households to sign_up to receive as_many as 150 cable channels . Some Administration officials privately expressed relief Thursday that the collapse of merger talks means they will not have to decide the fate of a complex marriage that , if approved , would have given two telecommunications behemoths access to nearly a quarter of American households . Still , most experts say the financial rewards of the information superhighway remain too enticing to deter most entrepreneurs . &quot; The future of the information superhighway still looks bright because you now will have robust competition among three competitors &quot; -- cable , telephone and wireless communications companies , said Anthony M . Rutkowski , former director of technology for Sprint Corp . who now serves as executive_director of the Internet Society .</TEXT>
