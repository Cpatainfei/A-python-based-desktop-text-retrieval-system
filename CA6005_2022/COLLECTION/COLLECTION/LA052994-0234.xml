   <HEADLINE> PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF SOARING CRIME SKEWED , EXPERTS SAY ; SAFETY : POLLS SHOW THAT A MAJORITY OF AMERICANS FEAR BECOMING VICTIMS , BUT STATISTICS INDICATE THEIR FEARS ARE OFTEN UNFOUNDED . MEDIA , POLITICIANS BLAMED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wanted : the true crime_rate . If ever a mystery persisted in the annals of American crime , it ' s the magnitude of crime itself . Anxiety about crime grips the land but , looking_at federal statistics , you have to wonder why . The FBI reports crime is merely crawling upward . Victim surveys show crime actually falling . But for many people , an evening stroll , an unlocked car or going alone to the mall hint at lunacy . After tucking_in their children , many parents bolt the doors , check the alarms and pat the guns under their beds good_night . Measuring the dimensions of crime in the United States is a statistical nightmare : This is a vast , populous country in which crime_rates vary sharply , even from police_precinct to neighboring police_precinct . Try to draw a picture of crime besetting 250 million people and you lose the detail . Polls indicate people feel more vulnerable , to violent crime especially . This fear fuels the &quot; three strikes , you ' re out &quot; efforts occupying Congress and close to 30 states this year , the avid prison building and the pervasive unease . Are perceptions wildly out of sync with statistics ? First , some numbers : * Crime reported by police the last 20 years climbed 36 % , FBI Uniform Crime Reports figures show . The overwhelming majority of reported crime -- 85 % -- was property crime . But the largest jump in any category came_in the area of violent crime , which shot_up 81 % , driven mainly by juveniles with guns settling drug scores . * The two-decade federal victims survey indicated a 29 % drop_in crime nationwide since 1975 . The National Crime Victimization Survey counts one in four households visited by crime each year , down from about one in three in 1975 . The survey also found the rate of violent crime basically unchanged , except for a sharp increase in teen-age and black victims . * Last year , about 24 # 500 murders were reported in the United States . that ' s much as it has been for the last several decades . &quot; The best scientific evidence we have clearly shows there is no increase in crime or violent crime in the last 20 years , &quot; said William Chambliss , a sociologist at George_Washington University . &quot; The fact is , even if the crime_rate was going_up , the victims who were the victims remain the victims , &quot; said Chambliss , who also is a past president of the American Society of Criminology . &quot; The most dangerous place you can go is to your home with your boyfriend or girlfriend , family members and acquaintances . They account_for most of the violent crimes that take place. &quot; Forget the statistics , you might say . Everyone knows crime is America ' s biggest worry nowadays . National polls show not only that , but that many people think it is increasing in their own communities -- and even more think it is increasing nationally . An Associated Press poll of 1 # 004 Americans , taken_in April , found 52 % of men and 68 % of women personally worried about becoming crime victims . Even among those who said there was nowhere within a mile of their homes they would be afraid to walk at night , half still worried about being victimized . One reason crime gets the spotlight is that it ' s moved_up on the charts , ahead of foreign crises and the economy . Crime always ranks high on polls evaluating the country ' s most important problems , said Tom W . Smith , director of the General Social Survey at the National Opinion Research_Center , based at the University of Chicago . And with the Cold_War over and the economy brightening , politicians took_note of Americans ' intensified outrage against crime , adding their own spin . &quot; For good political reasons , the Congress and the President have found crime is something politically attractive to be against , &quot; Smith said . Other influences are at_work . Crime stories permeate American life -- witness their popularity as a topic of news and entertainment . Last year , crime news_reported on the three major television networks more_than doubled , and coverage of murders tripled , compared with 1992 , according to a survey by the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington . Another recent survey indicates this coverage rings familiar alarm_bells . In a Times Mirror Poll released April 6 , 63 % of respondents said the media accurately depicts the amount of crime in this country , while 29 % said it exaggerates . Half the people surveyed also said they were very concerned about becoming a crime victim , up from 36 % in 1988 . Some criminologists suggest another reason the fear of crime might be greater than statistics warrant is the extra attention paid to crimes occurring in unusual spots . But exceptional bloodshed doesn ' t even ripple the crime graph line , even though it shocks . &quot; You only hear about a very small number ( of crimes ) , and that is the impression that everybody carries around , &quot; said Malcolm Young , who runs the Sentencing Project in Washington . &quot; We ' ve accepted the 19 # 000 ( other killings ) or whatever threshold we don ' t hear about. &quot;</TEXT>
