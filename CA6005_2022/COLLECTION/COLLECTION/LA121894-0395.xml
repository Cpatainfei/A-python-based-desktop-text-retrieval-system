   <HEADLINE> PALM LATITUDES : CREATURE FEATURE ; DOGGIE DONORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cooing &quot; O.K. pumpkin &quot; as she wields her pink razor , Kim Applebaum shaves a one-inch square on both sides of the white-thatched neck of Konager , a 75-pound male Belgian sheepdog . Konager remains calm even after some swabs with alcohol and a pair of syringe plunges.A few minutes later , the canine blood pool is two bags fuller . Konager hasn ' t budged . It ' s another dog-day afternoon at San Diego ' s Canine Blood_Bank , which supplies blood to more_than 200 veterinarians . One of a handful of such ventures in California , it started in 1985 with four donors and now has four dozen volunteer dogs spilling two pints four times a year for their less-fortunate brethren . &quot; There was Buck , a black shepherd who was playing fetch when she was impaled on a stick ; that took_five pints , &quot; says nurse Applebaum . &quot; Or the dogs injured by coyote or snake attacks or car accidents . That doesn ' t even scratch medical conditions and elective surgery . We can ' t keep_up with the demand ; we need more donors. &quot; The need for canine transfusions is_on the rise partly because &quot; people will go_to greater lengths today to save their dog , &quot; says Paul Cervone , administrator of the Emergency Animal Hospital , one of the blood_bank ' s financial backers . &quot; Pets are our 1990s family . Plus we ' re doing more sophisticated surgery than 10 years ago , from hip replacement to cataract surgery. &quot; Donor dogs must have A-negative blood ( the only one of the 11 canine blood_types that ' s universal ) , weigh 50 pounds or more , be 2 to 7 years old , in good_health and calm . Very calm . &quot; When I ' m opening_up the jugular_vein to take blood for five minutes , &quot; says Applebaum , &quot; and I ' m nose to nose with a dog , I want to know she ' s obedient and isn ' t going_to bite. &quot; Nanette Wiser</TEXT>
