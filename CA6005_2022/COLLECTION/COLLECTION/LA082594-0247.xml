   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; NEW WARDEN NAMED TO HEAD LANCASTER PRISON ; CORRECTIONS : ERNEST ROE WAS CHIEF DEPUTY WARDEN IN TEHACHAPI . HE REPLACES OTIS THURMAN , WHO CAME UNDER HEAVY CRITICISM AFTER TWO ESCAPES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ernest C . Roe , a chief deputy warden at the state_prison in Tehachapi , was named the new warden at the state_prison at Lancaster , the governor ' s office announced Wednesday . Roe , 41 , has worked for the state_Department of Corrections since 1985 , said J.P. Tremblay , a spokesman for the state Youth and Adult Correctional Agency , which oversees the Corrections Department . He replaces Otis Thurman , the prison ' s first warden who was forced to resign in February under heavy criticism from the public and state officials after two escapes by maximum-security prisoners . Thurman ' s temporary replacement , John Ratelle , an interim warden for five months , cited a &quot; lack of attentiveness &quot; by the prison ' s staff as the leading factor_in the escapes . When Thurman submitted a report suggesting that construction flaws at the 18-month-old prison may have been partly to blame , that report was corrected on several points by department officials in Sacramento . Donald R . Hill , warden at the Tehachapi prison , replaced Ratelle and served as interim warden since the beginning of the month . The governor ' s office informed Roe of his appointment by telephone Wednesday . He later attended a meeting of the Lancaster Citizens Prison Advisory Committee later in the day to introduce himself to committee_members and the public , said Roger Skaggs , a spokesman at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi . Roe is a former deputy_sheriff in San Joaquin County who began his career with the state_Department of Corrections in 1985 as supervisor of its training academy at the Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown . In 1987 , he took another supervisory position at the Deuel Vocational Institute in Tracy , where he later became the assistant chief of education and an associate warden . * He moved to the 5 # 700-inmate Tehachapi facility in 1989 , where he rose to deputy chief warden and took_charge of the operations of the minimum- , medium- and maximum-security facilities , as well as the reception area , Tremblay said . Roe ' s duties at Tehachapi included overseeing the prison ' s medical services , housing and recreation programs , classification and discipline of prisoners and its records department , Tremblay added . Tip Kindel , a spokesman for the state Corrections Department , said he hoped Roe ' s appointment coupled with increased security measures will help alleviate the community ' s &quot; justifiable concerns about the escapes and security at the institution. &quot; &quot; It ' s something that the community has every right to demand from us , and we demand it from our administrators , &quot; Kindel said . &quot; We ' re hoping with all_the steps that have been taken , we can earn the confidence of the public in that community , but we will have to re-earn that trust. &quot; Lancaster Mayor Frank Roberts , who serves on the advisory committee and met Roe on Wednesday , said Roe ' s appointment was a step_in the right direction . &quot; He is soft-spoken and a well- educated guy , and I think things are going_to be OK , &quot; Roberts said . Next month , the Antelope Valley Transit Authority will begin using the prison ' s minimum-security inmates to help maintain the transportation agency ' s bus fleet , Roberts said .</TEXT>
