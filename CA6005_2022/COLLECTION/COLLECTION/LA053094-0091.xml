   <HEADLINE> ALICE IN TRANSIT LAND ; ON SOME SOUTHLAND PROJECTS , LOGIC SEEMINGLY HAS TAKEN A U-TURN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ford engineers designed the classic ' 55 Thunderbird , but they also came_up with the ' 57 Edsel . NASA scientists put a man on the moon , but a glitch in the Hubble telescope stumped them for years . History teaches us that for every act of genius , there is a blooper . For Southern California , the 1990s have been peppered with historic accomplishments in transportation : Officials reopened the quake-shattered Santa Monica Freeway 2 1 / 2 months ahead of schedule . They cut the ribbons on L.A. ' s Red_Line subway , the Century Freeway , the Metrolink commuter_train , an Orange County toll road and the Long_Beach trolley . But at_the_same_time , some baffling or plain wrongheaded transit projects and policies have been set_in_motion . The lesson to be learned , experts say , is to beware the politics of transportation -- a labyrinthine maze in which common-sense planning and logic sometimes lose out_to political concerns or even greed . It is a system in which large sums_of_money are spent with spotty accountability , an equation that occasionally allows shortsightedness and often rewards political muscle , these observers say . that ' s why , for example , bus passes for the poor cost more_than passes for the general public . And why the planned rail route from Downtown to Los Angeles International Airport would involve riding two trolleys , one subway , a bus and a shuttle . &quot; You dignify a_couple_of these decisions to call them dubious . They are amazingly dubious , &quot; said James Moore , associate_professor of urban_planning and co-director of USC ' s Center for Advanced Transportation Technology . &quot; You are heading fast and deep toward the category of stupid. &quot; Here is a score card of some of the transportation bloopers that cover our landscape , and the reasons they happened : * Why don ' t trains go where you want to go ? The Red_Line subway will stop a half-mile from the L.A. County Museum of Art and the Hollywood Bowl . It goes nowhere near Dodger Stadium or the Great Western Forum . And the last stop of the Green Line trolley -- running between Norwalk and El Segundo -- will end 1.5 miles from the airport . In fact , here ' s your route to LAX from the subway once the Green Line trolley is finished next year : Tote your luggage over to your favorite Red_Line station , transfer to the Blue Line , switch to the Green Line until the last stop , take the bus to Parking Lot C , and then hop_on the airport shuttle . In devising the routes of the Red_Line and Green Line , transit planners had one main goal : transporting commuters . Officials have said the system is designed to serve those going_to work -- not sightseers , culture aficionados or sports fans . The number of people who would use the Green Line to get_to the airport would n ' t compare to those who would take the trolley to work , they say . * Why widen a freeway to six lanes and connect it to three lanes ? In Orange County , Interstate 5 will be widened from three to six lanes of traffic in each direction -- a $ 1.6-billion extravaganza to be finished in 2001 . One problem : when the roadway hits the Los Angeles County_line , it returns to three lanes . Ever heard of bottleneck , asks Ryan Snyder , a transportation consultant and vice_president of the L.A. Board of Transportation Commissioners . Caltrans officials said they hope the I-5 will someday be widened in Los Angeles County as well , although the project will not even be considered until 2010 . In any case , officials do not think the traffic_jams will be bad at the point where the freeway narrows . This type of planning is what happens when different jurisdictions install a piecemeal approach to solve traffic woes , said Genevieve Guiliano , associate_professor of urban and regional planning at USC . &quot; It ' s a regional planning problem , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s a question of different philosophies about how traffic should be managed. &quot; * Why does the MTA need imported granite ? The Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- currently facing a $ 126-million operating shortfall and proposing fare hikes -- will pick_up part of the tab for a trip that sent five contractors and two agency employees to Italy and England to inspect bricks and granite for the agency ' s new headquarters , which is under construction . The cost for MTA officials was $ 7 # 538 . It ' s not yet known how much was spent for the contractors ' travels . In response to criticism , Rob Vogel , project manager of Catellus Development Corp. , which is building the MTA ' s headquarters , has told the agency he will not ask_for reimbursement , according to MTA spokesman Steve Chesser . During the first of two trips to Europe , the agency ' s development specialist , Robin Blair , and four members of Catellus traveled_to Pisa , Italy , from Jan . 10 to 16 . They viewed granite samples . The following month , Blair , MTA supervising engineer Vasan Srinivasan and four Catellus members ( three from the previous trip , one for the first time ) , traveled_to a quarry in Savema , Italy . From there , the group went_to London to visit a brick factory and &quot; sites where bricks are extensively used , &quot; said Shaker Sawires , the MTA ' s deputy executive_officer of operations . Sawires said it was essential that each person travel . &quot; Each one has a different function , &quot; he said . Nevertheless , from now on , authorization will be needed for all overseas travel_by the agency , according to MTA chief Frank White . This from the agency that became the butt of talk_show jokes two years ago when The Times disclosed that the agency ' s staff spent almost $ 3 million on catered meals , doughnuts , entertainment and automobile expenses . Putting aside the issue of propriety in spending taxpayers ' dollars , another question remains : Aren ' t American bricks and granite any good ? Apparently not . &quot; We tried to use local bricks , we made tests and it did not withstand busloads , &quot; Sawires said . By using the Italian-manufactured granite , the agency saved $ 200 # 000 , said Chesser , who added that 83 % of the stone materials used on the building are American . Only two years ago , the MTA came under_fire when it awarded a $ 122-million contract for rail cars to the Japan-based Sumitomo Corp . At that time , agency officials were blasted for not &quot; buying American. &quot; ( The contract was later canceled. ) * Does anyone know where the DASH buses go ? The routes of the DASH buses , which traverse Downtown , have changed more_than 10 times since the service began in 1985 . Nor do these buses take a simple approach -- a map of DASH routes looks a jumble of bent coat_hangers . &quot; They zigzag and are completely illogical , &quot; said Bob Saunders , a travel writer with the Automobile Club of Southern California . Chunming Yen , a planning associate with the city Department_of_Transportation , conceded that the maps are difficult for passengers to read . &quot; It ' s not complicated to us , &quot; Yen said . DOT officials say they are trying to devise a simpler map . * Why do we pay_for the rich to take trains ? Taxpayers pay a $ 21-per-passenger subsidy for everyone boarding the periwinkle-and-white Metrolink commuter_trains . The average household income of these passengers is $ 63 # 300 . ( By comparison , the per-passenger subsidy on the bus is $ 1.17. ) Should we pay these subsidies , asks planning expert Guiliano , when most mass-transit users -- who have an average household income of $ 15 # 000 -- ride the bus ? Metrolink officials respond that they are carrying_out the will of the voters , who in 1990 approved a county ballot measure and two state initiatives that provided funding for the commuter rail_line . &quot; In asking_for good viable transportation for everyone , voters are asking_for choices and they are willing to tax themselves to have choices , &quot; said Annette Colfax , Metrolink ' s director of finance and passenger service . * Why do bus passes for the poor cost more ? Concerned about low-income transit users who cannot come_up with $ 42 for a monthly rail / bus pass , MTA officials last year devised a program that allows passengers to purchase semi-monthly passes . Each two-week pass costs $ 23 . . . or $ 46 a month . MTA officials say they have to charge more for the semi-monthly pass to cover the administrative costs . Conceded one of them : &quot; It ' s probably not the biggest contribution to mobility that we ' ve ever done. &quot; * Why do transit officials spend 20 times more for security on rail_lines than on buses ? MTA officials spend more_than $ 1 per passenger to provide security on trains and trolleys and a nickel per passenger for security on buses , even though the vast majority of transit users -- 1.3 million passengers -- travel_by bus . &quot; Talk_about inequity , &quot; said Earl Clark , general chairman of the United Transportation Union . Transit officials insist they must guarantee the safety of rail passengers if the fledgling system is to succeed . &quot; The community made a major capital investment of $ 1.4 billion on the Red_Line and nearly $ 900 million on the Blue Line . Those investments were done to give people a new way to travel , &quot; said MTA spokesman Jim Smart . &quot; If you do not secure people ' s safety , then they won ' t use that capital investment. &quot; * What you have seen here , says planner Guiliano , are &quot; illustrations of how politicized transportation decision-making is , and what power local groups have over regional planning . The alignment of rail_lines , for instance , is completely political. &quot; The power_structure of an agency like the MTA also prompts decisions that are made with an eye to the next election , she said . The MTA , which controls a $ 3.4-billion annual budget , is ruled by a 13-member board that includes county supervisors , city_council members , mayoral appointees , and four officials from smaller cities . &quot; The fundamental problem in L.A. is that one agency has control over a huge amount_of_money that makes everything they do very visible , &quot; Guiliano said . &quot; It ' s not helped by the fact that its board is local officials who each want something for their own area. &quot; Because local transportation agencies funded by tax dollars have no competition , they can afford to make mistakes , adds planner Moore . &quot; Since there ' s no penalty for being foolish , you get foolish outcomes , &quot; he said . &quot; If revenues depended_on the quality of decisions , then decisions would be better. &quot;</TEXT>
