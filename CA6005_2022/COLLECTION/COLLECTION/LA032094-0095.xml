   <HEADLINE> OLD PAINT , YOUNG VICTIMS ; THE NO . 1 SOURCE OF CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING IS HOUSEHOLD PAINT APPLIED 15 TO 100 YEARS AGO . AN ESTIMATED 3 MILLION CHILDREN IN THE U.S. SUFFER FROM LEAD CONTAMINATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The symptoms that plagued Elizabeth Jimenez ' s 2-year-old twin daughter weren ' t really out of the ordinary . The irritability , bouts of insomnia and refusals to eat all mimicked the &quot; terrible twos &quot; -- a stage most parents of toddlers know all too well . Her pediatrician told her not to worry . But when little Alexandra vomited a dark substance , Jimenez became alarmed . A close family friend suggested the mother of five have her daughter tested for lead_poisoning . The test turned Jimenez ' s life upside-down . It showed that Alexandra was suffering a high level of the disease . &quot; I was shocked , &quot; Jimenez recalled . &quot; I was scared . I was really scared. &quot; She had good reason to be . Apparently , when the family lived_in an 80-year-old house in Pomona , Alexandra had ingested invisible lead dust from the painted walls . She also chewed on lead-tainted woodwork . Enough poison had entered her small body to cause some neurological damage . A lead level higher than 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood is considered unsafe by the Atlanta-based Centers_for_Disease_Control ( CDC ) . Alexandra ' s blood measures 49 micrograms per deciliter of blood . ( A microgram is to a deciliter about what an eyedropper of liquid is to a gallon. ) Nearly 100 years after lead_poisoning in children was first recognized , the metal continues to contaminate an estimated 3 million young children in California and the nation , inflicting upon them , most experts believe , learning disabilities , hyperactivity , lowered IQ , impaired motor coordination and in the most serious cases mental_retardation and even death . &quot; We ' re finding lots of kids with lead_poisoning who basically have had their lives limited , &quot; said Dr. Sue Binder , chief of the CDC Lead Poisoning branch . &quot; The fact that it ' s all preventable -- that we don ' t have to have poisoned children -- makes_it a real tragedy. &quot; &quot; It is the foremost preventable health hazard to children , &quot; agreed Don Ryan , executive_director of the nonprofit public interest_group , Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning in Washington . &quot; It eclipses every_other health hazard. &quot; Today , the No . 1 source of childhood lead_poisoning is household paint applied between 15 to 100 years ago , with the older paint used before 1950 usually containing the highest lead levels , experts say . The paint itself isn ' t the problem . It ' s the oxidation and deterioration of the paint , which creates a nearly invisible , highly toxic dust that settles inside the house -- on floors , walls , furniture and toys . Young children often put dust-coated toys and fingers in their mouths and ingest the lead that way . Other children get_it by eating paint chips and chewing on such lead-painted surfaces as window sills . The Northridge earthquake is certain to have made matters worse , kicking_up lead dust and cracking old paint as it twisted apart thousands of structures and jolted many_more . And the post-quake repairs are only worsening the problem , said Margo Derry , acting director of the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program for the County of Los Angeles Department of Health Services . &quot; We had a problem before with people renovating houses , &quot; Derry said . &quot; Now with the earthquake and all_the ( repair ) work going_on , the problem is infinite. &quot; California Department of Health Services officials recorded about 700 cases of childhood lead_poisoning statewide in 1993 , with 12 % of those cases considered medical emergencies . In Los Angeles County , 529 children were diagnosed as lead poisoned last year , about 60 % of them from paint . The rest were contaminated by a number of other lead sources : soil , lead-tainted home remedies -- especially popular_with some Latino and Asian communities -- pottery and china finished with unsafe lead glazes and lead solders in some canned goods and plumbing_fixtures . But health officials believe that the diagnosed cases represent only a fraction of the actual number of poisoned children . They expect childhood lead_poisoning cases to soar as routine testing of all children up_to 6 years old takes_hold in California . It ' s estimated more_than a half-million California children face the risk of lead_poisoning . Many of those afflicted with the condition don ' t look or act sick . The disease offers no definitive symptoms , except at its most acute levels . &quot; A lot of times children can be exposed to lead and it ' s causing an adverse neuro-psychological effect and you would n ' t really know it because the children don ' t become symptomatic , &quot; said Bob Schlag , head of the Lead Hazard Reduction Department of the California Department of Health Services . &quot; What we ' re concerned about are the subtle cognitive deficits in children. &quot; Testing for lead_poisoning , he said , is the only way to detect the disease and his office now recommends every child be tested at least once , with regular testing for those exposed to greater lead hazards . The American Academy of Pediatrics revised its policy on blood lead testing in July and now recommends that all children be tested at about 1 year of_age for elevated levels . Lead poisoning in children was first recognized as a serious health hazard early in this century . Worldwide , a number of countries , including Great Britain , Greece , Tunisia , Spain , Poland , Cuba and Yugoslavia banned lead paint for indoor use or restricted children ' s exposure to it in the 1920s and 1930s . In the United States , however , it wasn ' t until 1978 that the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission finally restricted the use of lead in household paint . Shortly after , leaded gasoline -- the other main source of lead contamination outside the workplace -- was banned . &quot; The one giant public health triumph of the late ' 70s and early ' 80s was taking lead out of gasoline , &quot; said Ryan . &quot; Population-wide , average blood-lead levels plummeted by more_than half. &quot; But because lead-based paint remains in half of the 104 million dwelling units nationwide , according to federal estimates , the childhood lead_poisoning problem didn ' t go_away , while much of the attention given the issue did . That began changing in 1988 , in part because of a report published by the federal Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry that said in 1984 , 15 % of U.S. children had blood lead levels high enough to affect their cognitive abilities . Moreover , the study showed that while the problem does indeed disproportionately affect children from impoverished families who live_in older , dilapidated housing , lead_poisoning isn ' t restricted to the urban poor . &quot; It was real overpowering data , &quot; Binder said . &quot; As people began to look , they began to find more and more cases , not only in the cities but in suburban homes that were being renovated . Whole families of kids were being poisoned because of the things people were doing to their homes . The recognition of how widespread it was became a catalyst for action. &quot; That helped bring_about the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 , also known as Title X , a far-reaching federal law that eventually will affect virtually everyone , including homeowners , landlords and tenants . It will bring_about profound changes in the prevention of lead_poisoning -- including mandatory real_estate disclosure laws and warning requirements for the sale or lease of any house or apartment built before 1978 . That portion of the law will take_effect in October , 1995 . Right now in California , lead-based paint is lumped together with other environmental hazards in the 1993 disclosure form issued by California Department of Real_Estate . The childhood lead_poisoning issue has not received as much attention in California as it has_on the East Coast , where a number of local and state agencies have in place aggressive lead prevention and abatement programs . Schlag says that ' s because California ' s houses are_on average newer than those nationwide , leading many to wrongly assume that lead_poisoning isn ' t an issue in the Golden State . &quot; It is one of the unfortunate myths that childhood lead_poisoning is only a problem in the East , &quot; Schlag said . In Los Angeles County , there are more_than a_million homes built before 1950 that are known to contain the highest levels of lead . Further , many_more built as late as 1978 also contain lead paint , although the amount of lead used in the paint is probably much less than that used in older paint . &quot; If you own a home that was built before 1978 , there ' s a very good chance that you ' re going to find lead in the paint , &quot; said Janet Comey , chief of the Lead Poisoning Abatement Program for the County of Los Angeles Department of Health Services . &quot; If you have children under the age of 6 and you have peeling , chipping paint , you should have some concern. &quot; Lead is most dangerous to children under 6 years old . that ' s because it attacks the brain and nervous_system . Children between 1 and 3 years old , like Alexandra Jimenez , are most susceptible to the metal because their neurological systems are rapidly developing and because they ' re more likely to put lead-tainted objects in their mouths or to chew on contaminated surfaces . Once a child is identified as lead poisoned , the case is reported to the county Health Department for further action . If the child has a blood level higher than 45 micrograms per deciliter of blood , as was the case with Alexandra , the child is usually prescribed a chelating agent , either intravenously at a hospital or orally at_home , which helps remove some of the lead . Alexandra got the latter treatment and her mother had to give the sick toddler capsules three times a day for 19 days . &quot; They smelled like sulfur and she would scream and sometimes vomit them up , &quot; Jimenez said of the medication . &quot; While she was taking those pills and getting blood_tests once a week , it got_to the point where we ' d just drive past the doctor ' s office and she would break_out crying. &quot; For less serious cases , there is no active medical treatment , said Derry , of the L.A. County health department . &quot; If there is no further exposure , what seems to work well is health education for parents , &quot; she said . &quot; We talk to parents about the circumstances of their child ' s exposure and we try to mitigate that exposure. &quot; In Los Angeles County , any family with a lead-poisoned child is assigned a public health nurse and specialist who make a visit to the child ' s home . The team interviews the parents and inspects the home to find the source or sources of contamination . Sometimes , health officials find that the child ' s home is free_of lead contamination and that the youngster is picking_up the lead at a preschool or relative ' s home . The L.A. County Department of Health Services then orders the owner of the contaminated property to eliminate the hazard , which can be very costly depending_upon how extensive the work . &quot; What we ' re trying to do is work with the owners , &quot; said county lead_poisoning chief Comey . &quot; We ' re trying to come_up with a sensible way where people can afford to do these abatements. &quot; But for now , she said , there are no government loan programs or other financial assistance aimed specifically at private lead abatement work . Officials say Title X will eventually establish an infrastructure for dealing with the lead_poisoning problem at all levels before children become sick . &quot; What we ' d like to do is prevent the lead from coming_into the child ' s environment and we would n ' t have to do the blood_tests we ' re doing now , &quot; said Schlag , of the state health department . &quot; Ultimately that ' s our long-term vision . In the meantime , a huge population is being exposed . Before we get the lead out of the environment , several generations will be passing_through at the risk stage. &quot; For Alexandra Jimenez , now 3 years old , the most visible sign of her lead_poisoning is her slower verbal development , which has fallen_behind that of her twin sister . But whether the damage is permanent remains to be seen and her family is hopeful . &quot; Fortunately , &quot; said Elizabeth Jimenez , &quot; I think I found it soon enough. &quot; Next : Dealing with lead hazards in the home . O ' Neill is a Los Angeles free-lance writer . FACTS ABOUT LEAD * As an element , inorganic lead cannot be processed by current technology and destroyed . It will continue to be a potential hazard in some form forever . * Humans do not have natural defenses against lead exposure . * The human_body can accumulate lead over a lifetime and does so even with minimal exposure . For humans to experience the adverse effects of lead exposure , they need not be exposed to large quantities of lead at any one time . * Estimates of lead exposure cases greatly understate the cumulative effect of a persistent and pervasive pollutant such_as lead . * Lead knows no socioeconomic or demographic boundary . It affects children and adults from a wide range of backgrounds . * Lead serves no physiological purpose in the human_body . The presence of lead in humans in any amount is not good . Lead levels in some segments of American society are 3 # 000 % to 6 # 000 % higher than that of pre-industrial humans . LEAD EXPOSURE Nearly 17 % of all children in the United States are exposed to lead in some form , according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report to Congress in 1987 . Lead poisoning is a common occurrence that seems , at the outset , harmless . It is the accumulation of lead in the body that can cause serious medical problems . EXTENT OF EXPOSURE : LEADED PAINT -- An estimated 12 million 7-year-olds in the United States have potentially been exposed to lead . Lead in paint is ingested by children as dust particles . WATER_PIPES -- An estimated 3.8 million children have drinking_water with dangerously high lead levels . Older homes and buildings may still use lead waterpipes . FOOD -- Most children under 6 in the United States are potentially exposed to lead in food at some level . An estimated 1 million children are exposed to enough lead in food to suffer a low level of poisoning . GASOLINE -- Some 5.6 million children under 7 years old are potentially exposed to lead left over from now-banned leaded gasoline . POTTERY -- Handcrafted pottery and china dishes with decorative paintings applied on top of the glaze are primary sources of lead exposure . Dishes with coroded glaze should also be avoided . Avoid using questionable dishes to heat or cook food . ETHNIC REMEDIES -- Azarcon , a bright orange powder , and Greta , a yellow powder , are two of the most common substances containing lead . Both remedies are used in the Latino community for intestinal illnesses . SOIL -- Soil normally contains low levels of lead . The accumulation of chipped paint and paint dust in soil around the house increases the level of exposure to children . WHO ' S AFFECTED Infants and young children are most susceptible to lead_poisoning . And because lead can easily penetrate the placenta , a developing fetus also faces a higher risk of lead_poisoning . The primary organ affected by lead_poisoning is the brain and central_nervous_system . THE MAJOR HEALTH EFFECTS : * Extremely severe poisoning can induce coma , convulsions and profound , irreversible mental_retardation . * Lower levels of lead exposure can slow cognitive development in children , reduce IQ scores and impair hearing . Prenatal lead exposure can also cause retardation in the mental and physical development of a child through at least 2 years .
