   <HEADLINE> BAMBINOS IN TOYLAND ; BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVERY YEAR IN THE ITALIAN PROVINCIAL_CAPITAL OF PORDENONE , THE CHILDREN OF THE TOWN PUT ON A BAZAAR AT WHICH THEY SELL THEIR OLD TOYS AND BUY NEW ONES SECONDHAND FROM THEIR PEERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Who knows from Pordenone ? Only the lucky few , and on a special Sunday in mid-October , children are the luckiest and happiest of all . A prosperous , energetic Italian provincial_capital of 50 # 000 located an hour northeast of Venice at the foot of the Alps , Pordenone is hardly_a tourist town . With but a handful of hotels within its limits , its attractions not only didn ' t rate any stars in the Michelin Green Guide to Italy , it was in fact dropped entirely from that magisterial volume in 1990 . The closest Pordenone has gotten_to any kind of written fame is an uncomplimentary mention in Ernest Hemingway ' s &quot; A Farewell to Arms. &quot; The great man , who passed_through the town as a World_War I ambulance driver , was apparently not much impressed . He had a character dismiss it as &quot; not much of a place &quot; and in addition had his hero desert to Switzerland rather than retreat to its friendly confines . Hardly_a ringing endorsement . Known 1 # 000 years ago as Portus Naonis because of its function as a port on the River Noncello , Pordenone does have a reputation for several things , none of which are calculated to inspire wanderlust in potential visitors or even hint at why children have a special reason to rejoice . For one thing , Pordenone is now a manufacturing center , the home of Zanussi , Italy ' s biggest maker of appliances and considered the country ' s second largest industrial firm after Fiat . In addition , the chaos in the former Yugoslavia just down the road has made the nearby Aviano NATO base quite a busy place , considerably increasing the American military presence in town . Forthright GIs in full camouflage regalia can be seen striding purposefully through its streets , and hotels post friendly warnings in English about the expense of calling_back to the base . More recently , Pordenone has become known for the event that lured my wife and I to its environs . This is an eight-day international festival devoted to the showing of vintage silent films called &quot; Le Giornate del Cinema Muto , &quot; a matchless occasion with a wonderful combination of conviviality and comprehensiveness . Though it is possible to arrive in Pordenone without setting foot in a car , my wife and I made other plans . Intent_on visiting friends north of Verona , we had rented a car in that city ' s airport and so found ourselves driving into Pordenone down a tree-lined boulevard pleasantly reminiscent_of streets in the south of France . Because of the NATO troop crunch , hotel_rooms in Pordenone were a little difficult to come_by . We settled first in the chilly Albergo Minerva in the center of town , a Spartan place with the cleanest , whitest , most unadorned rooms this side of a monastery . Hoping for a little more comfort and taking_advantage of our car , we soon moved to the Villa Giustinian , less than 10 miles away in the exquisite hamlet of Portobuffole . Built_in the 16th Century as a country retreat by a noble ( is there any other kind ? ) Venetian family , the Villa had recently been restored as a luxury hotel , and its calm grounds , quiet service and surprisingly hearty breakfasts were always welcome . * Once we settled in , we discovered that Pordenone was one of those places travelers dream about , a charming and comfortable town whose absence of tourists makes_it possible to live within a culture and not feel_like an outsider . Part of an underappreciated region of Italy known as the Friuli and inhabited by , one guidebook sensibly claims , &quot; the warmest and most hospitable of the Italians , &quot; Pordenone has both elegant shops located on the cobblestoned Corso Vittorio Emanuele and the kind of cozy and welcoming restaurants you hate to leave . One of the things that made attending &quot; Le Giornate del Cinema Muto &quot; so pleasant , aside from the fascinating programming that went_on for close to 10 hours a day , was the event ' s regularly scheduled , very civilized 2 1 / 2-hour lunch and dinner breaks . After being warned off the only restaurant most guidebooks listed , my wife and I settled into a routine of frequenting one of two establishments for most of our meals . If we were in a hurry , we went_to the casual All ' Antico Cervo ( The Old Stag ) , a no-reservations , no-credit cards neighborhood place with the freshest and most delicious pizza . If there was a little more time , and there usually was , we headed to La Gatta Buia , which means &quot; The Black_Cat &quot; but with an additional slang meaning of &quot; jailbird. &quot; There we ate beautifully and traded small_talk with the exceptionally friendly waiters who all seemed to have kind feelings toward Los Angeles . The town is so hospitable , in fact , that once a year , on a mid-October weekend , it sponsors a city fair just to give its citizens a chance to mill_around and greet each other . There is an &quot; Autoexposizione , &quot; where well-dressed men kick the tires of all_the latest model cars , an area set_up for tasting of the area ' s famous San Daniele prosciutto and , in a normally quiet piazza near the center of town , something special hiding in a printed descriptive brochure under the mundane name of &quot; Bazar 6-14. &quot; It is hard to describe the gleeful sensation that stumbling on this bustling event caused in both of us . We rounded a corner and there , stretching_out into the distance under a crisp , clear autumnal sky , were literally hundreds of stalls jammed with colorful merchandise . But while it might have looked_like just another Italian street fair , this was radically different . For one thing , there was nothing on any of these tables but toys . Sitting under posters of such modern icons as Jean-Claude Van Damme and the cast of &quot; Beverly Hills 90210 , &quot; the merchants kept sharp eyes on piles of dolls , board_games , buttons , skates , ice_skates and a huge variety of books , from the simplest Disney versions to racy science_fiction items . And quite unusual merchants they were . Not adults , not even close , but young people between the ages of 6 and 14 were sitting behind tables in this ninth annual event established to encourage children to sell their old toys and games and buy new ones secondhand from their peers . Though the presence of professionally printed badges showed that adults had organized this bazaar , they knew enough to vanish from sight on the big day . So it was an unalloyed treat to see these &quot; aspiring business people &quot; ( as a descriptive brochure called them ) , their tables no doubt neater then their rooms at_home ever are , proudly overseeing their own merchandise and intensely haggling with their compatriots . Egged_on to take_part by my wife , I approached a little_girl who scrutinized me carefully when I pointed at an Italian language novelization of &quot; E.T. &quot; She continued to look dubious as I thumbed through the book , but when I handed her the 2 # 000 lira asking price ( barely more_than a dollar ) , her uncertainty changed into the most magnificent and unexpected of smiles . There is a lot more to see in Pordenone than the children ' s bazaar , including a suitably ancient town hall-cathedral-bell tower combination on the Piazza San Marco and some examples of the painting of 16th-Century master and native son Giovanni Antonio De Sacchis , known to the world as &quot; Il Pordenone. &quot; And the town makes a good starting_point for explorations of the rest of Friuli , a region that has had three different capitals in its long history . The town of Aquileia is the farthest away , almost as far southeast as Trieste , and we never quite got there , despite the lure of what is supposed to be one of the largest Roman mosaic floors in captivity . We did get_to Udine , an hour due_east of Pordenone , with its remarkable Venetian-style town square , and then pushed_on to Cividale del Friuli , just 15 minutes farther . Cividale is the home of the celebrated Tempietto Longobardo , a haunting and even magical white stucco relief of a sextet of maiden saints that sits on a high wall_in a small temple building by a rushing river and which has lost none of its mystery in the 1 # 000 years since the Lombards created it . But wonderful as all these ancient relics are , it is the image of that smiling young_girl at the Pordenone children ' s bazaar that I believe will stay with me longest . She may have thought she got a great_deal when I paid ready money for her discarded book , but my wife and I believe we received the best deal of all .
