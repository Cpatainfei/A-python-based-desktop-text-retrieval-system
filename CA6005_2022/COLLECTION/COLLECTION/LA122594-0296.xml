   <HEADLINE> 1994 : YEAR IN REVIEW ; WHAT A WACKY TOWN II ; HOLLYWOOD IS AS HOLLYWOOD DOES--IT WAS A YEAR OF EXECUTIVE SHAKE-UPS AND A FILM SLATE THAT RAN FROM ' NATURAL BORN KILLERS ' TO ' DUMB AND DUMBER. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Perhaps there were signs_in the heavens and the earth . A quake registering magnitude 6.8 jolted Los Angeles in January and amid the widespread destruction and frayed nerves , production in the area ' s huge entertainment_industry came_to a virtual standstill for weeks . A helicopter plunged out of the sky in April , killing a top_executive of the Walt Disney Co. , and one of the most stable of entertainment firms was suddenly wracked with acrimony and turmoil at the highest levels . When it was over , new leadership was installed at the studio and a Dream Team of Steven Spielberg , Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen announced plans to form a new studio . The cast and crew of &quot; Waterworld &quot; fled their coastal Hawaiian movie set after officials issued a tidal_wave warning . But what Universal Pictures really feared was a financial tsunami should the Kevin Costner film -- which at $ 135 million and climbing stands to become the costliest ever -- bombs next summer . As 1994 wound down , one could argue that even by Hollywood standards , it was an unusually turbulent year . But then , any year that begins with a Jim Carrey movie ( &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective &quot; ) , continues with a Jim Carrey movie ( &quot; The Mask &quot; ) and ends with a Jim Carrey movie ( &quot; Dumb and Dumber &quot; ) has to be strange . From executive suites to the movies themselves , surprises abounded . Who would have thought as the year dawned that Paramount Pictures , a studio gripped with uncertainty while a merger battle raged over its parent firm on Wall_Street , would release the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time , &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; ? Or that MCA ' s two top_executives , Lew Wasserman and Sidney Sheinberg -- the very symbols of stability in the entertainment world -- would hint at leaving if they didn ' t win more autonomy from their corporate owners in Japan ? Or that Warner Bros . would have lackluster box_office with Costner ( &quot; Wyatt Earp &quot; ) , Warren Beatty ( &quot; Love_Affair &quot; ) and even Steven Seagal ( &quot; On Deadly Ground &quot; ) , but succeed beyond its wildest dreams with Carrey ' s &quot; Ace Ventura &quot; ? Or that Sony would take a staggering $ 2.7-billion write-off on Sony Pictures Entertainment -- on top of a $ 510-million operating loss on the studio ? This , in the same year the studio opened its new Art Deco commissary , where waiters in black-and-gold striped vests and crisp white shirts serve $ 15.25 hamburgers and $ 5 desserts . Or that 20th Century Fox , which looked so savvy with its summer blockbuster &quot; Speed , &quot; would look so inept by Christmas with four straight flops , and then come_up with the bizarre gimmick of offering moviegoers their money back if they didn ' t like &quot; Miracle on 34th Street &quot; ? It was a year when some mini-studios made major gains . New Line Cinema , which built its reputation with &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street &quot; flicks , became a major Hollywood deal maker , thanks to an infusion of media mogul Ted Turner ' s money . New Line spent $ 4 million on a Shane Black spec script called &quot; The Long Kiss Goodnight &quot; and $ 1 7 million on Carrey ( who starred in the studio ' s summer hit &quot; The Mask &quot; ) to star in two other films . MGM / UA , its glory days long gone and its lifeline now dependent_on a French bank , suddenly looked_like the most stable studio in town . With little fanfare , the studio quietly went_about its business , making deals and putting movies into production and even came_up with the surprise hit of the fall , &quot; Stargate , &quot; which grossed more_than $ 65 million . Sometimes there was upheaval and calm occurring inside the same company at almost the same time . Take Paramount . Was there ever a studio that appeared to be in such chaos ? For months , Viacom and QVC waged all-out war trying to wrest control of Paramount Communications as employees watched with a combination of awe and fear . When it was over , Viacom had won and Paramount ' s top two corporate_executives -- chairman Martin Davis and president Stanley Jaffe -- had departed . Yet across the country at Paramount Pictures , studio chief Sherry Lansing and her staff remained snugly in place . Saddled with $ 10.5 billion in debt , the company next brought_in Sony executive Jonathan Dolgen -- an expert at forging financial partnerships -- to chart a new path for the studio . Then there was Sony Pictures Entertainment . The studio consolidated power when it combined the distribution arms for Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures , and again when it put Columbia chief Mark Canton in_charge of both units . Yet Sony was suffering the most disequilibrium of all_the studios . It made few movies and many of the ones it did stank_up the box_office . Sony chief Peter Guber bid goodby as did a number of lower-level executives and there were constant rumors that Canton himself might go or that one of the units might be sold_off . It could be argued that the studio upheaval was attributable to the movies themselves . &quot; Movies have become so expensive to produce and to market that management , stockholders and boards of directors are less willing to indulge a creative executive again and again without seeing a substantial return on the investment , &quot; said one industry insider . Indeed , given all_the pressures to succeed -- and all_the headaches putting_together projects and dealing with egotistical actors and directors -- the real question in 1994 was why more studio executives didn ' t bail . While the box_office is heading for its best showing in more_than three decades , clouds were still on the horizon . Consider : * There were too many movies in the marketplace . Every weekend , it seemed , was a gigantic roll of the dice . While Disney and Warner Bros . seemed to be releasing a movie a week , the others had to grit their teeth and hope they picked their best shot . &quot; There were too many films chasing too few screens , &quot; explained entertainment analyst Jeffrey Logsden , managing partner at Siedler Cos . &quot; A lack of screen expansion meant that studios had to give_up more of the pie to exhibitors just to get choice screens . One way you get better screens is to give exhibitors better terms. &quot; * The old adage that nobody knows anything in Hollywood still held true . As the year began , who would have guessed that three of the biggest stars of 1994 would be Jim Carrey , Tim Allen and Keanu Reeves ? &quot; There were people inside the business who had never even heard of ' Ace Ventura ' before it came_out , &quot; said entertainment lawyer David Colden . * Violence continues to sell -- even satires about violence . Oliver Stone ' s &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; -- a movie about America ' s culture of violence and the media ' s ratings-driven exploitation of that culture -- raked_in nearly $ 50 million at the box_office for Warner Bros . Quentin Tarantino ' s ultra-cool , ultra-violent &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; has already earned nearly $ 60 million and is still performing well at the box_office . * Studios don ' t draw talent , material does . &quot; Warner Bros . has made all these movies with big stars over the years , but that doesn ' t mean the stars won ' t work anywhere else , &quot; said former TriStar chief Mike Medavoy . &quot; Kevin Costner works for Universal . Clint Eastwood does a movie for Castle Rock . Mel Gibson does one for Paramount . Michael Douglas will work for anybody . So will Sylvester Stallone . It finally comes_down to who has the material to do what they want to do . It isn ' t like in the Golden Age of movies when Warner Bros . spun_out these gangster movies , Universal did a certain kind of film , Columbia did a certain kind of film . That isn ' t the case anymore. &quot; * Put a project in turnaround at your own peril . Paramount Pictures basked in the glow of &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; a box-office champ and likely Oscar contender . But Warner Bros . and Columbia had earlier turned_down the project . Paramount , meanwhile , missed the boat when it placed &quot; Speed &quot; in turnaround and Fox scooped it up . * How many creative development people does_it take_to make a hit ? &quot; How many development people did Thalberg have ? &quot; asked one movie executive . &quot; Those guys loved movies and they made them and they knew how to make them . They selected the right people and left them together . People who run studios today are not movie_makers , they ' re basically deal makers. &quot; * Stars ruled . Studio executives repeatedly went_after the same small group of bona_fide box-office stars for their big films . Sometimes the formula worked ( although studios paid 5 % to 15 % of the gross for success ) : Arnold Schwarzenegger in &quot; True Lies , &quot; Harrison Ford in &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger , &quot; Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster in &quot; Maverick , &quot; Tom Hanks in &quot; Gump &quot; and Tom Cruise in &quot; Interview With the Vampire. &quot; Sometimes the formula didn ' t work : Costner in &quot; Earp , &quot; Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte in &quot; I Love Trouble , &quot; Macaulay Culkin and Ted Danson in &quot; Getting_Even With Dad. &quot; &quot; No studio would have done ' Four Weddings and a Funeral , ' &quot; said one industry observer . But getting a big star for a movie was not easy . Michael Douglas left &quot; Cutthroat Island &quot; after he was displeased with the script . Citing similar reasons , Jodie Foster bailed_out of &quot; Crisis in the Hot Zone &quot; and when no other major actresses would come_on board , Robert Redford also bailed . Then Redford bailed_out of Castle Rock Entertainment ' s &quot; An American President. &quot; Castle Rock then announced the picture would be made anyway -- with Michael Douglas .</TEXT>
