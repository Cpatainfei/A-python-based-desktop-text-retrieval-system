   <TEXT> Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakhstan , who spent most of his time here finishing second to Norwegian skier Bjorn Daehlie , won the gold medal Sunday in the final cross-country event of the Games , the men ' s classical 50-kilometer race . Smirnov , regarded almost as a countryman by Norwegians because of his close friendship with Norwegian skier-adventurer Vegard Ulvang , drew wild acclaim from the 31 # 000 in the stands at the Birkebeineren stadium . The entire crowd , including those who watched from vantage_points along the course , was estimated again at more_than 100 # 000 . Smirnov finished the 31.3-mile race in 2 hours 7 minutes 20.3 seconds . Mika Myllyla of Finland was second in 2:08:41.9 and Sture Sivertsen of Norway third in 2:08:49.0 , bumping Daehlie to fourth as Norwegians took four of the top 10 spots . Erling Jevne was fifth and Ulvang 10th . Ulvang , who won three gold medals and a silver medal two years ago in Albertville , France , finished with only a silver here , that earned as a member of the second-place 40k relay team . Daehlie tired badly toward the end of Sunday ' s race after having sat_out two days of practice last week because of fatigue and a cold . He finished with four medals in these Games , two gold and two silver . Smirnov led nearly all_the way after taking the lead from Myllyla early in the race . * Despite fading a bit down the stretch , the U.S. Alpine team can look_back on one of its best Olympics ever . Paul Casey Puckett ' s surprising seventh-place finish in Sunday ' s slalom gave the United States at least one top-10 finisher in nine of the 10 events . Puckett ' s excitement was dampened only by the fact that his brother , Chris , who had made the U.S. Olympic team in 1992 , was not on the 1994 team . * Italy ' s Alberto Tomba said he will probably ski through the 1995 World Championships at Sierra_Nevada , Spain , then decide how much longer to extend his career . &quot; I ' ve had a lot of ups and downs the last few years , &quot; said Tomba , who capped his Olympic career with a silver in the slalom . &quot; It ' s nice to finish the Olympics with a nice medal . I have a good feeling about it. &quot; Times staff writer Robyn Norwood contributed to this notebook . CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
