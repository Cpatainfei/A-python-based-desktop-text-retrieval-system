   <HEADLINE> PROP . 187 CARTOON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * The political cartoon by Ted Rall ( Commentary , Nov . 16 ) , labeled &quot; California Penal Code , &quot; was derisive , untrue , inflammatory and racist . The actions of the German state in the ' 30s and ' 40s were against a segment of their population who were citizens of that nation ! The actions were torture and extermination ! To compare that era with a legitimate angst resulting in an attempt to control expenditures which are bankrupting our state is mean-spirited and disgusting ! This issue -- Prop . 187 -- addressed a problem created by illegal immigrants of any color , creed , religion or ethnic group.There are legitimate arguments pro and con , but this type of attack is below contempt . SAUL H . SANDERS Palos Verdes Estates * The cartoon showing a section of the infamous Nuremberg laws with the word &quot; Jew &quot; replaced by &quot; immigrant &quot; was right on target . Prop . 187 was the closest thing the world has seen to Nuremberg laws since 1939 . I only hope that legal challenges will result in nullification of this unwise and downright evil measure before we slide_down the slippery path of Hitlerian Germany . It was easy then , as it is now , for a goat to be chosen as the focus for all our troubles . The problem with &quot; goatism &quot; is that it is so easy to change the object of our scorn . In the past the goat was the Jews ( and Gypsies , trade_unionists , communists and homosexuals ) who , when the dust cleared , numbered more_than 10 million as victims . Beware , my beloved state ! Speak out now about those who would blame an entire group for societal problems . SHERRI LIPMAN Fullerton</TEXT>
