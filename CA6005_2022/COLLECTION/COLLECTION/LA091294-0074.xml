   <HEADLINE> GRAND HOPES FOR CITY CORE ; DOWNTOWN : BACKERS SAY A $ 64-MILLION PROJECT OF APARTMENTS , SHOPS AND OFFICES IN THREE HISTORIC BUILDINGS WILL HELP CREATE A FUNKY DISTRICT LIKE N.Y. ' S GREENWICH_VILLAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Surely somewhere in this city are a_few people who love cities . At least that ' s the bet developer Ira Yellin is making as he directs a $ 64-million renovation of Downtown ' s Grand Central Market -- an innovative project that restores the aged grace of three historic buildings , mixes low-income and luxury apartments and capitalizes on easy access to the region ' s budding rail transit network . Its backers hope the Grand Central Square project at Broadway and 3rd Street will serve as a catalyst for the creation of a funky residential_district akin to such places as New York ' s Greenwich_Village or Denver ' s Lower Downtown , neighborhoods where different cultures and classes mingle willingly in a noisy , unpredictable environment . &quot; Broadway can eventually become a real city walk , &quot; said Yellin , referring to Universal CityWalk , the city-themed entertainment complex built two years ago in a parking_lot at Universal Studios , 10 miles northwest of Downtown . When it is finished next spring , Yellin ' s project will include a mix of 121 apartments , office space and retail shops as well as a refurbished Grand Central Market , the 77-year-old open-air food bazaar that serves_up everything from cow brains to guava nectar . One- and two-bedroom apartments will occupy the upper floors of the six-story Homer Laughlin Building above Grand Central Market . In the 12-story Million Dollar Building next door , apartments will rise above ground-floor retail shops and the Million Dollar Theater , a baroque movie palace built_in 1918 by Sid Grauman -- who also built the Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard . The adjacent Lyon Building on Hill Street will include 20 # 000 square_feet of office space . Apartments in the project will range from subsidized units for low- and moderate-income residents to market-rate . Rents have not yet been calculated , but Yellin predicts the project will attract a range of tenants -- from Downtown professionals to poor immigrants dependent_on the bus and subway to get_around . Three apartments on the top floor of the Million Dollar Building , once the headquarters of the Metropolitan Water District , will be marketed as historic penthouses . The living room of one , for instance , will be the mahogany-paneled board room where William Mulholland planned a water_system that laid the foundation for the modern metropolis . &quot; This is a part of Downtown that has a human dimension ; the streets and sidewalks are of a human scale , &quot; said Yellin , a lawyer turned developer who earned praise for his careful restoration of the 1893 Bradbury Building across Broadway from Grand Central . &quot; It has a history. &quot; When it opened in 1917 , Grand Central Market catered to society matrons who descended the Angel ' s Flight funicular_railway with butlers in tow from their ornate wooden palaces atop Bunker_Hill . Over time , as the wealthy moved farther and farther from Downtown , their mansions became flophouses and finally were splintered under bulldozers making_way for towers of concrete and glass during the 1960s and ' 70s . Silent movie_stars Mary Pickford , Lillian Gish and Charlie Chaplin attended the opening of the Million Dollar Theater , Grauman ' s first Los Angeles theater venture . The MWD occupied the upper floors for more_than 30 years , but since the agency moved_in 1963 , the building has been mostly vacant . In 1984 , one critic described it as &quot; an aging Miz Kitty in her dated dance-hall finery. &quot; * That finery remains evident in intricate facade carvings that include bison heads and longhorn cattle skulls . Construction crews have stumbled upon hidden treasures such_as ornately carved ceilings hidden under plaster , and canvas murals of cherubs behind false walls . Inside , marble floors are preserved whenever possible , as are original tiles . A sweeping staircase spirals down 12 stories . But even as its exteriors darkened with urban smear , Grand Central Market survived and even thrived as one of the few truly urban places left in Los Angeles . Its shops remain busy serving food as eclectic as its clientele -- from lawyers to bums . Yellin said his intent is to make the neighborhood as vibrant as the market . &quot; If there are people who like living_in a city , then they will like this project , &quot; he said . While this sort of mixed-use undertaking has long been common in cities such_as Boston or San Francisco , it is a new concept in Southern California , a region that has been historically scornful of urban-style development . Overcoming that prejudice is among the toughest tasks in the marketing of Grand Central Square . But even the project ' s doubters admit that if it is successful , it could signal the rebirth of a slowly dying district as well as serve as a prototype for other areas . Aside from its significance as a major historic renovation , the Grand Central project is a model of cooperation between public officials and private developers as well as an example of new ways to build_in urban neighborhoods . For the first time , two of the city ' s most powerful public agencies -- the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Community Redevelopment Agency -- are pooling their resources to back a project that could not get traditional financing . Yellin said private banks initially were excited about his plans -- which originally included more office space instead of apartments -- but backed_away after they visited the neighborhood , a largely Latino shopping district_lined with sagging buildings and garish signs . At the same time , the bottom fell_out of the office market . Even top-notch space in new buildings on Bunker_Hill was empty . Yellin ' s own Bradbury Building , listed on the National Register of Historic Places , is still 60 % vacant . So he shifted the Grand Central project ' s emphasis to housing and attracted the attention of the CRA and the MTA . Last year , the CRA issued a $ 44-million bond to combine with the $ 20 million Yellin had raised to finance the project . Part of the public_debt will be serviced by the MTA , which in turn will share_in part of the project ' s revenues , said Bill Lewis , manager of special projects for the transit agency . * Such an arrangement was possible because of the proximity of the Metro Red_Line ; an entrance to the Pershing Square station is just down the block from Grand Central . MTA officials hope that sort of link will both give people a reason to ride public_transit and make_it more convenient when they do . &quot; This project will create what we think will be a catalyst , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; A lot of people already use rail and bus transit to get_to the market . It just really became in our minds a real potential. &quot; In fact , such so-called &quot; transit-oriented &quot; development is gaining favor in Southern California . Other cities such_as San Francisco , Seattle , San Diego and San Jose already are concentrating development along transit_lines . And the concept is a major component of the city ' s new long-term growth strategy being formulated by Los Angeles planners . Planning experts said Grand Central ' s proximity to transit may be the wild card that helps it succeed where other residential projects Downtown have failed . * &quot; This is a complex question for Downtown , &quot; said Edward Soja , head of UCLA ' s urban_planning school . &quot; The history has been a failure to attract significant numbers into Downtown . Mass transit is the big question. &quot; Transit of a different kind is being counted_on to bridge the gap between the old Downtown along Broadway and the new Downtown atop Bunker_Hill , adjacent neighborhoods that are worlds apart . &quot; There is this massive barrier at Hill Street where a huge wall of condominiums divides Downtown into First and Third_World halves , &quot; Soja said . Construction is expected to begin next year on a new Angel ' s Flight , which will ferry passengers up and down between Bunker_Hill and Hill Street -- just as it did during Downtown ' s heyday . The Angel ' s Flight station will be directly across the street from Grand Central . Yellin and others expect the Grand Central project to be the link that connects old to new , luring people first onto Broadway and then into the rest of the historic core . &quot; That whole neighborhood is really going_to jump-start , &quot; CRA General_Manager Ed Avila said . &quot; What ' s happening is that Grand Central is the pivotal point for the revitalization of this neighborhood. &quot; At least that ' s the plan . But the very urban unpredictability that Yellin sees as central to the project has a history of dashing even the best-laid plans . Yellin , however , likes the odds and thinks his bet will pay_off . &quot; I have always believed that places like this have inherent value , &quot; Yellin said , peering through vertical blinds at the freshly scrubbed facade of his Million Dollar Building . &quot; You just have to know how to use it. &quot;</TEXT>
