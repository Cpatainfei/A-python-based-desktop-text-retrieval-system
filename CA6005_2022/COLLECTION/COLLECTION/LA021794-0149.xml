   <HEADLINE> TOGETHER AGAIN ; CARLENE CARTER AND COUNTRY_MUSIC FIND EACH OTHER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carlene Carter plunks herself down for a lunch appointment and cheerfully announces that she has just left the scene of a &quot; domestic crisis , &quot; the domicile in_question being her own . The crisis has to do with diet supplements , boxing trunks and credit_cards . The body-slimming supplements -- for which this slender , fine-boned , Dove bar-loving country singer would make a very good advertisement -- have been ordered in quantity . The credit-card limit has been reached . And , therefore , the Everlast trunks ( the ones most prizefighters wear ) cannot be ordered . Seated at a Beverly Hills hamburger joint , Carter says this does not sit well with Howie Epstein , her record producer and sweetheart of five years . He wanted the world-class boxing trunks , but it ' s impossible to charge them , and now he ' ll have to wait . While this inside tidbit may_not put Carter ' s money-management skills in the best light , it does illustrate what a good country performer does_in reaching_out to the public . It ' s a funny little tale of everydayness that shows Carter as just-folks , willing to open_up about the small intimacies of ordinary living . At the same time , she is enough of a show woman to invest it with a bit of drama by casting it as a domestic crisis . Take those elements -- openness , humor , the folksy touch , a sense of drama rising from the every day -- and you have some prime ingredients for the creation and winning presentation of country songs . It doesn ' t hurt that this story and many others spill from Carter in the most natural way , flowing in a friendly Tennessee twang that can be a little smokey and rough but also delightfully musical . It may be the Platonic ideal of a Southern accent , and you can ' t help being charmed , just as you can ' t help being taken by her singing , which is founded on a comparable duality . Carter , 38 , possesses one of the sassiest female voices in pop , one that fits well with her longstanding stage image as a robust fun lover with a wild streak as long as her skirts are short . She is also a ballad singer of great tenderness . Listening to &quot; Unbreakable Heart , &quot; from her current album , &quot; Little Love_Letters , &quot; one hears some of the sweetness , vocal purity and vulnerability of a Karen Carpenter . Carter , who plays Monday at the Crazy Horse Steak House , benefits from a special confluence of nature and nurture . She is a third-generation member of what was literally the first family of country_music . The original Carter Family featured Carlene ' s grandmother , Maybelle Carter , her great-uncle , A . P . Carter , and his wife , Sara . Emerging from Poor Valley , Va. , in 1927 , the trio served as a bridge between the old Appalachian folk tradition and modern country_music . Its repertoire included such standards as &quot; Wabash Cannonball , &quot; &quot; Wildwood Flower &quot; and &quot; Will the Circle Be Unbroken. &quot; Carlene ' s father , Carl Smith , was a honky-tonk singer who scored dozens of country hits in the 1950s and ' 60s . ( She was raised Smith but took the Carter name when she started recording. ) Her mother , June Carter , continued the Carter Family tradition with her two sisters . June Carter also co-wrote , with Merle Kilgore , one of country_music ' s greatest songs , &quot; Ring of Fire , &quot; and since 1968 has been Johnny Cash ' s wife . While Carlene grew_up singing with the family group , and toured for a time with Johnny Cash and the Carter Family , by her early 20s she had struck_out on_her_own , both in pursuit of a musical style and in taking her own hard-knocks route through life . Her arrival as a strong presence on the country scene came belatedly , in 1990 . She had spent most of her previous recording years based in London , working with some of Britain ' s best rock musicians , including guitarist Dave Edmunds , Graham Parker ' s band , the Rumour , and then-husband Nick Lowe . From 1978 to 1983 , Carter made five albums , which for the most part fully revealed her country roots yet were marketed as rock releases . Unable to get past cult-artist status and confused about her musical direction , she dropped_out of the recording scene for several years . Her career revival began in 1988 , when she hooked_up_with Epstein , best known as the bassist of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers . They began working_on songs at Epstein ' s house in Beverly Hills . The result was her 1990 comeback album , &quot; I Fell in Love. &quot; The record was a critical success that yielded two country radio hits , &quot; I Fell in_Love &quot; and &quot; Come on Back , &quot; and established Carter as a mainstream country contender . She was nominated for a Grammy as best female country singer and for an Academy of Country_Music award as best new female vocalist . The story line at the time was that the prodigal daughter had returned to her family roots after years carousing with those British rock ' n ' rollers ( and Carter had established a reputation as a willing carouser ) . But Carter says it was less a case of her music changing than of the Nashville Establishment broadening its own definition of what country_music could be . If you took the odd , fuzz-bass riff and E-bow guitar synthesizer groan out of the mix , Carter ' s 1980 album , &quot; Musical Shapes , &quot; a critics ' favorite , would fit with today ' s commercially successful hybridization of country with rock and pop , albeit with fuller-blooded performances and better songwriting than almost all_of the current competition . At the time , though , Carter didn ' t consider herself country . Actually , she didn ' t consider herself anything but a singer-songwriter . &quot; I definitely wasn ' t country enough for the country market then , &quot; she said . &quot; If you listened to country radio then , nothing I did fit in. &quot; By the late ' 80s , though , &quot; I started listening to it and familiarizing myself with what was going_on . I felt , ' It ' s not that different from what I do . Maybe there ' s a place for me now . I don ' t have to compromise myself to fit in. ' &quot; If Carter was born to be country , she was taught to be eclectic . She cites mom June Carter as her most important early musical influence . &quot; She taught me my first things on the guitar and the piano , and she exposed me to so many different kinds of music growing_up . She taught me my first boogie-woogie thing on the piano when I was 5 years old and instigated my love of music. &quot; Carter recalls her mother bringing_home Bob Dylan ' s first album in the early ' 60s and announcing , &quot; This young_man is really special. &quot; By the time she was 12 , she says , Johnny Cash had bought her her first electric_guitar and amplifier . &quot; I was slogging away to the Yardbirds. &quot; At 15 , Carter got_married to her high_school sweetheart , and at 16 she was a mother . This was not the result of a wild streak or a rebellious attitude , she says , but a way of reconciling surging hormones with the traditional morality of her upbringing . &quot; I was very religious , &quot; she said . &quot; No way did we believe_in having_sex before marriage . So when I started having these normal teen-age tendencies , I got_married real quick. &quot; She was racing through adolescence , having left high_school after her sophomore year , taken an equivalency degree , then quickly enrolled as a music major at Belmont College in Nashville . By age 20 Carter had been divorced , remarried and had her second child . She was working while pursuing her studies , giving piano_lessons to children at $ 5 per hour . But she was also writing songs and performing , which led , in 1977 , to a record deal with Warner Bros . Carter left college a semester short of earning her degree in classical piano . Soon after , she married Lowe , the respected British rocker who produced her early albums . &quot; I was always in a hurry , &quot; Carter said . &quot; I grew_up quick because my family was away a lot , and I took_care of my sister . Then in my 20s , I went_through my teens , with these wild abandon things. &quot; Today , Carter rolls her eyes at the thought of having been thrice married and a mother of two before she had reached her mid-20s . She says she brought her children up not to follow her own rushed timetable in growing_up . &quot; I said , ' Just know this : Birth_control only works if you use it. ' I think they both saw how hard it was to raise kids and be so young. &quot; Daughter Tiffany , 22 , is about to put her graphics degree to use with a Los Angeles video company . Jackson , 18 , plans to begin pre-med studies at Pepperdine . Carter learned the value of a lively stage style by watching her grandmother , her mother and her aunts at_work in the Carter Family band . &quot; My mom is a great entertainer . She said she made a great career out of not being able to sing very well . They always conducted themselves with grace and a lot of energy , and a real lot of humor. &quot; Carter says she never had much trouble with the energy part . &quot; I just had this horror of standing there on stage in a high-neck granny dress . I always wanted to jump around the stage and sing loud. &quot; She recalls receiving only one explicit bit of familial advice about stagecraft : June Carter and Johnny Cash told her not to cuss in front of an audience . &quot; I ( heed it ) now , but I didn ' t used to , &quot; Carter says blithely . &quot; They said , ' It would embarrass your grandmother , ' because they knew that would work_on me . I ' ve made so many faux pas in front of my mother. &quot; That includes a club date years ago when she was mortified to have June Carter turn_up unexpectedly on a night she had gone onstage in a T-shirt that read &quot; Picasso Sucks. &quot; &quot; Thank God she didn ' t have her glasses on . I don ' t think she could read it. &quot; By the mid-1980s , Carter was having a hard_time reading her own musical direction . In 1983 , she had put_out a synth-pop album called &quot; C ' est C Bon &quot; that she regards_as her worst , although she says it was fun at the time to dabble_with lots of keyboards . &quot; You can imagine that after doing that album I was really lost , &quot; she said . &quot; I thought , ' This is not me. ' It was cool to find_out I could do something like that , and Epic ( her label at the time ) wanted me to start another album . But I bailed . I didn ' t know what I wanted to do . But I had the sense to know I was at the end of my experimenting. &quot; In 1985 , Carter spent a year playing the part of diner owner Purdie Cupp in a London production of the musical &quot; Pump Boys and Dinettes. &quot; &quot; That was a good thing in my life , &quot; she said of going_through an eight-show-a-week regimen . &quot; I was reckless as hell , and I learned discipline from doing that. &quot; Next , Carter spent two years performing with her mother and aunts Helen and Anita in the Carter Family act . She felt her prospects for a recording career dimming and bought property in Tennessee with the idea of starting a horse ranch . She would write songs to pitch to other performers , maybe do more theater and breed horses . She says that K . T . Oslin ' s rise in 1987-88 helped her change her thinking . Here was a woman in her mid-40s who sang twangy pop songs that reflected her maturity and experience , and she was succeeding in the country market with a hybridized style and unconventional themes . &quot; I was at the point in my life where I felt I was too old to start over again , &quot; Carter explained . Carter began working with Epstein , an old acquaintance she had met in the early ' 80s when Nick Lowe toured as opening act for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers . What started as a musical partnership turned_into a romantic one . One of its first fruits was the song &quot; I Fell in_Love , &quot; a wry but exuberant song that Carter wrote to celebrate the blossoming romance . It turned_into the hit that established her in the country market . Today , the couple share Epstein ' s house in Beverly Hills , a modest-sized home_in a spectacular ridge-side spot . The colorful cacti that Carter enjoys growing blend well with the Native_American artifacts that Epstein has collected for years . Two fluffy cats and a young German_shepherd serve as company . * Old photos of A . P . Carter and the rest of the Carter family adorn the living room bookshelf . At one end of the house is a recording_studio the size of a small bedroom . It is there , not in the usual Nashville setting , that Carter ' s career resurgence has taken_shape . Carter ' s current album , &quot; Little Love_Letters , &quot; didn ' t take_shape quickly or easily . She embarked_on the most exhaustive touring of her career after the release of &quot; I Fell in_Love &quot; and found she was unable to write songs on_the_road . So she and Epstein spent a year on the follow-up , recording more_than 30 songs in search of material that was strong enough . This album , like &quot; I Fell in_Love , &quot; has been a moderate success . Its first single , &quot; Every Little Thing , &quot; hit No . 3 on the Billboard country singles chart last year , but the follow-up , the ballad &quot; Unbreakable Heart , &quot; failed to crack the Top 50 . &quot; They just don ' t want ballads from me , &quot; Carter lamented . &quot; They want me to do up-tempo , happy. &quot; She has obliged with the just-released new single &quot; I Love You ' Cause I Want To , &quot; which finds her at her sassiest , augmented by an R &amp; B-style horn section . For the first time in her career , Carter will turn_to Nashville for guidance on her next record . She and Epstein agree that , after doing two homemade albums together , a change of producer would be healthy . Carter and her record company , Giant , don ' t want a repeat of the three-year gap between &quot; I Fell in_Love &quot; and &quot; Little Love_Letters , &quot; and Epstein is too heavily booked with production work for John Prine and a summer Petty tour to produce another record for her at this point . &quot; I ' m kind of excited to see what kind of record I ' ll make with someone who ' s in the wheel in Nashville , &quot; Carter said , although she admits to a bit of apprehension at not having Epstein -- &quot; my security_blanket &quot; -- on_hand . &quot; Little Love_Letters &quot; is off the chart , having peaked at No . 35 last year . But Carter still harbors ambitions that one more hit single can spur it past the gold ( 500 # 000 sales ) mark . And she cheerfully admits being &quot; real mad &quot; that the album has been passed_over for awards nominations . At the same time , Carter , who was ready not so_long ago to abandon her recording career , maintains a sense of perspective . Her primary motivation , she said , is &quot; to be an entertainer , not somebody who topped the charts or won female vocalist of the year . &quot; You can have a big hit and not get rich . I would just like to be able to pay my bills , get my kids through college. &quot; And -- who knows ? -- maybe charge a pair of boxing trunks , crisis free . Who : Carlene Carter .
