   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : ANAHEIM ; POLICE_CHIEF OUTLINES NEIGHBORHOOD PLANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Police_Chief Randall Gaston released the city ' s new Community Policing Plan this week . The plan is aimed at reducing crime and improving the relationship between officers and residents in eight neighborhoods . Seventeen officers are being assigned full time to the program , which will be implemented March 14 . The program calls_for officers to learn the concerns of each neighborhood ' s residents and property_owners and help them organize Neighborhood Watch programs . It seeks to eliminate feelings of mistrust between the department and residents , the report says . The plan also calls_for opening four &quot; storefront &quot; police substations in the northern , southern , eastern and western parts of the city . The plan does not say which neighborhoods will be targeted , and Gaston did not return several calls_for comment Wednesday . The neighborhoods were selected by the department after input from the city ' s Gang / Drug Task_Force , the Code Enforcement Department and other agencies . Gaston wrote in a 29-page report on the program that it is needed for several reasons , including the public ' s changing expectations of police_officers , changes in the city ' s ethnic composition and the city ' s increasing crime_rate . &quot; In order to deal with community concerns relating to crime , the fear of crime , social and physical order and neighborhood decay , the Anaheim Police_Department has adopted a policing philosophy based on a community policing concept , &quot; Gaston wrote . &quot; Fundamental to this philosophy is the belief that these serious issues can only be impacted through strategies that employ a total community effort involving police , government , school , church and neighborhood partnerships , &quot; he wrote . The city has had similar programs in the past on a trial basis and both residents and the police considered them successes . The most notable program targeted the Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood between 1989 and 1992 . One officer was assigned full time to the neighborhood , which is considered one of the city ' s most violent . The officer ' s job was to meet with residents and property_owners and help them deal with their neighborhood ' s problems . The crime_rate did drop and more crimes were solved . The program ended when a federal grant dried_up . TERRY SPENCER</TEXT>
