   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON FOREIGN_POLICY ; HURLEYISM SWAMPS FOGGY BOTTOM ; THEORISTS WITH NO PRACTICAL EXPERTISE ABOUT THE AREAS THEY TARGET COULD AGAIN POISON THE WELL FOR DECADES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first year of foreign_policy under Bill_Clinton displays all_the marks of a typically American self-inflicted wound . This wound is caused by the reliance on &quot; generalists , &quot; usually lawyers and professors , to carry_out difficult new initiatives . Such people are trained in what they like to call &quot; cutting-edge skills &quot; but are totally innocent_of the histories , cultures or languages of the countries where they so readily apply their theories . At best , they are engaged in expensive on-the-job training , which , if successful , will make them useful just as they are leaving_office . It is not just that most American political appointees are catastrophically misinformed about the countries they are dealing with . They are also ideologically blinded to the kinds of knowledge they would need to be effective . They believe that theory is all that matters , much as their Marxist-Leninist counterparts argued in Brezhnev ' s Russia and Mao ' s China . Current examples of the results of theorists prevailing over people with practical expertise include the collapse of economic reform in Russia and the United States ' inability to do anything about its $ 50-billion trade_deficit with Japan . In Russia , economics professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard applied an ideologically rigid program of economic reform , based on some English-language textbooks intended to justify Anglo-American-type capitalism , without any attention to the country in which these reforms were being applied or even an ability to read Russian reports about how things were going . The results were predictable -- the movement toward democracy has been undercut , Boris Yeltsin is being discredited , Vladimir Zhirinovsky is advancing on an ultranationalist platform and many Russians are nostalgic for Lenin . Had Sachs and his band of free-market shock-therapists read Alexander Yanov ' s &quot; The Russian New Right , &quot; published in the late 1970s , they might have had a much better idea of how to shape their policies to make them effective . And they would have been forewarned that some measures of change in Russia , such_as the strong reappearance of the Orthodox Church , do not mean the same thing that they might mean in Sachs ' own society . American policy toward Japan since last summer ' s collapse of the Liberal Democratic Party offers another example of ideological blindness . Lulled by the notion that Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was a &quot; baby_boomer &quot; and a &quot; consumer advocate , &quot; the United States , without a single high official who has substantial knowledge and experience of Japan and the ability to read the language , now faces yet another year of $ 50-billion-plus trade_deficits with Japan . The intellectuals who have crafted recent American policy toward Japan include C . Fred Bergsten , a former Carter_Administration official , whose idee fixe about the yen / dollar exchange_rate has virtually destroyed the Japanese-American relationship , and Jagdish Bhagwati , a Columbia University economics professor whose Indian provenance has evidently given him a deep-seated distrust of economic planning . Bhagwati recently organized an economists ' plea to Hosokawa to resist any efforts by the United States to consider results in making trade_policy , even though a demand for results might force the Japanese government to end its policies of shielding Japanese manufacturers from international competition . There are other recent examples of American myopia . For example , the NAFTA debate scrupulously tried to avoid any mention of Mexican economic_conditions or social_policies until guerrillas in Chiapas put them on the front pages . These and other cases suggest to me a return of the Patrick Hurley syndrome . Gen . Patrick J . Hurley is indelibly associated with what is surely one of the two or three greatest disasters in the history of American foreign_policy -- the misanalysis of the Chinese_revolution of the 1940s , leading to the collapse of U.S. foreign_policy in the Pacific , the Korean and Vietnam_wars , McCarthyism and American isolation from China for two decades . Hurley was an Oklahoma politician , Herbert Hoover ' s secretary_of_war , an amateur diplomat and President Roosevelt ' s mediator between the Chinese Communists and the Chinese Nationalists in the civil_war that followed the Japanese surrender . Hurley knew neither Chinese nor anything else about China . He bungled his mission because of overconfidence and because he totally misread the situation in terms of Chinese popular sentiments . But he dishonorably blamed his failure on the China specialists of the State_Department , charging that they had predicted a communist victory ( accurately , as it turned_out ) and were therefore pro-communist . Together with Sen . Joseph McCarthy , Hurley thus managed to poison American China policy for more_than two decades . Our government again seems to be populated with Hurleys , this time from the legal_profession , the professoriate and retreads from the Carter_Administration . We have not learned what went_wrong with Hurley . He was in over his head , and his credentials in domestic politics were not transferable to areas where there is no substitute for knowledge and experience . The return of Hurleyism to Washington suggests the likelihood of the recurrence of foreign-policy disasters comparable_to the debacle of postwar China policy .</TEXT>
