   <TEXT> After their first encounter with the Clinton_Administration ' s new policy directive on peacekeeping , several members of the U.N. Security_Council feel bruised , chastened and somewhat angry . The test_case came last week when the council buckled under U.S. pressure and delayed the dispatch of 5 # 500 more troops to ravaged Rwanda . The Americans , explaining their reasons for the delay , cited the need for a realistic assessment of what can be done_in that woeful Central African_country . &quot; Realism &quot; is the touchstone of Presidential Policy Directive 25 , or PPD25 , as the directive is known in peacekeeping circles . But the call_for realism undermined ambassadors who believed_in the greater need for an emotional , clarion outcry against genocide in Rwanda . &quot; This was the wrong issue on which to test PPD25 , &quot; said a European ambassador on the 15-member Security_Council . &quot; There is a humanitarian disaster in Rwanda , and the members of the council wanted to go_on record that they were ready to do something. &quot; The council did pass a resolution authorizing some immediate help and possibly 5 # 500 more troops later , but the resolution -- with its plethora of conditions -- did not resonate with the kind of commitment and dynamism that some ambassadors had wanted . U.S. officials , however , were pleased with their handiwork . U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright , defending the toned-down resolution , told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee a_few hours later that &quot; sending a U.N. force into the maelstrom of Rwanda without a sound plan of operations would be folly. &quot; &quot; Emotions can produce wonderful speeches and stirring Op-Ed pieces , &quot; she went_on . &quot; But emotions alone cannot produce policies that will achieve what they promise . If we do not keep commitments in_line with capabilities , we will only further undermine U.N. credibility and support. &quot; Some ambassadors were persuaded by this argument . A second European ambassador said that the first encounter with PPD25 had created &quot; a bracing , sobering and beneficial impact on the council. &quot; But even this supporter acknowledged that U.S. diplomats had managed the resolution clumsily , needlessly offending some members . New Zealand Ambassador Colin Keating and Nigerian Ambassador Ibrahim A . Gambari were obviously upset by the U.S. maneuvers . French Ambassador Jean-Bertrand Merimee also seemed troubled . Rumors circulated that a_few others could not stifle their annoyance over what had happened . At issue were the size and the operating plan for the U.N. mission in Rwanda . When a mysterious plane crash killed Rwanda ' s Hutu president April 6 and set_off mass killing of the Tutsi minority and moderate Hutus , the United Nations had 2 # 500 peacekeeping troops in Rwanda . Their job was mainly to supervise a cease-fire between the Hutu-dominated government army and the Tutsi-dominated rebel force known as the Rwandan Patriotic Front . Under a peace agreement , this cease-fire was supposed to lead to national elections . In the first hours of violence , 10 Belgian peacekeeping troops were slaughtered when they tried in vain to save the moderate Hutu prime_minister from execution by marauding Rwandan troops . The Belgian government quickly pulled its troops out of Rwanda and helped persuade the Security_Council that it was futile to keep a large peacekeeping force there . The council cut the force drastically , ordering it to do no more_than try to mediate a cease-fire , observe what was going_on and supervise humanitarian relief if possible . By mid-May , there were only 450 U.N. soldiers there . As the horrendous killings mounted , Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called_on the Security_Council to change_course and dispatch an enlarged force of at least 5 # 500 peacekeepers to deal with the nightmare . But on May 5 , President Clinton signed PPD25 -- the Administration ' s new policy on peacekeeping . Kneaded by U.S. officials for more_than a year , this policy pledged the United States to ask tough questions before taking_part or even approving any U.N. peacekeeping mission . Rwanda called PPD25 into action for the first time . Boutros-Ghali proposed that the peacekeepers land at Kigali ' s airport in the center of the country and fan_out from there to assist humanitarian relief and to deter attacks on civilians who had fled their homes . But Albright objected to this plan during closed-door meetings of the council , saying that the United States favored sending U.N. troops in smaller numbers to the refugee camps just inside the Rwandan borders . She called this approach &quot; less complex &quot; and derided the idea of launching a U.N. operation &quot; through an airport at the epicenter of a civil war. &quot; She said that chances for success were slim with Boutros-Ghali ' s plan . On top of this , she said she doubted whether the secretary_general could persuade governments to give him enough troops . The United States itself would provide logistics support if the mission was worthwhile -- but no troops . The council thus had to wrestle with two military approaches , which were quickly dubbed the American &quot; outside-in &quot; plan and the secretary_general ' s &quot; inside-out &quot; plan . As a compromise , Nigeria ' s Gambari , who is serving as president of the council this month , proposed a resolution that simply authorized a force and left it up_to the commanders in the field to decide whether it made more sense to start from Kigali or the borders . After all , he argued , none of the ambassadors has a military background . On May 13 , the 15 members of the council , including the United States , seemed close to accepting the Gambari compromise . But the U.S. delegation still had questions about it , and the ambassadors decided to consult their capitals over the following weekend before voting . Last Monday , the U.S. delegation returned with a host of doubts about the resolution and a new proposal : The Security_Council should vote only to augment the current force to 800 and to return 150 military observers who had been evacuated to Nairobi , Kenya . A larger peacekeeping operation could be discussed later . This surprised most of the ambassadors and infuriated some . &quot; We had to have a resolution that the newspapers would say authorized 5 # 500 troops , &quot; an angry European ambassador said later . After hours of wrangling , the council finally voted after midnight in favor of a new compromise resolution . The resolution dispatched the small numbers that the Americans had proposed but approved in principle a future force of 5 # 500 . But these troops would go_to Rwanda only if the secretary_general satisfied the council -- particularly the United States , with its power of veto -- that the two belligerents would cooperate with the United Nations , that a cease-fire was in_sight , that troops were available , that the mission would last only a short time and that &quot; the concept of operations &quot; ( either inside-out or outside-in ) was acceptable . In short , Albright had pressured the Security_Council into asking the tough questions that PPD25 said must be asked . Although the resolution was adopted unanimously , the vote reflected bitter division . &quot; I cannot conceal my delegation ' s disappointment that this resolution only approves a very modest first phase , &quot; New Zealand ' s Keating told the council . &quot; This resolution stops short of what is really necessary . . . the commitment of the council to an operation that would make a start at the task of protecting civilians at risk. &quot; Some ambassadors were obviously irritated over the pressure to mold their resolution to fit PPD25 . &quot; We cannot have one member of the council deciding that all peacekeeping operations must follow its agenda , &quot; the angry European ambassador said . &quot; What if the Russians decided to do that ? Or China ? What if one country decides to veto all peacekeeping missions that have to do with human_rights ? We cannot have that. &quot; But Albright insisted that most of the ambassadors welcomed the exercise . &quot; I think the other members of the Security_Council are appreciative of the guidelines that we are setting , creating some kind of rationale for which peacekeeping operations are doable and which ones are pie in the sky , &quot; she told a television interviewer a_few days later .</TEXT>
