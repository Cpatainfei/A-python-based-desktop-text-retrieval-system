   <HEADLINE> EU PLANS TO ADMIT EX-SOVIET BLOC NATIONS ; DIPLOMACY : ENVOYS FROM SIX LIKELY NEW MEMBERS ATTEND SUMMIT . BUT ACCORD IS FAULTED FOR LACKING A TIMETABLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Leaders of the 12-nation European Union formalized plans Saturday that would open membership to countries of the former Communist East Bloc . Although EU members were criticized for the absence of any precise timetable , adopting the plan constitutes an important step_in extending the push for an economically and politically unified Europe beyond the Continent ' s old Cold_War divide for the first time . &quot; Today was a historic occasion for the European Union and for Europe as_a_whole , &quot; declared German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who hosted the summit . &quot; Who could have conceived_of such a meeting five years ago ? This will help us build a Europe that is peaceful and prosperous . We have departed from the past. &quot; As a gesture to symbolize the EU ' s commitment , Kohl invited the leaders of six Central and East European_nations being considered for membership to participate in the meeting ' s final session . Referring to the image of the leaders of Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Bulgaria and Romania sitting at an EU summit , Executive Commission President Jacques Delors said : &quot; There is no longer a distinction between East and West . We share traditions , culture. &quot; However , even for the most advanced of the six , membership may be several years away , according to EU officials . Under the terms of the plan , the EU will set_out a package of laws and regulations that candidate countries must enact to achieve compatibility with the group ' s internal market . At the same time , the EU has pledged to support this restructuring with a $ 6.6-billion aid fund and to liberalize access to its markets for the candidate countries . Despite Saturday ' s step , the most economically advanced of the Eastern countries -- Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary -- have complained about the EU ' s vague references_to membership &quot; around the end of the century. &quot; &quot; The Czech Republic will reach the point of compatibility soon , several years before the end of the century , &quot; Czech Prime_Minister Vaclav Klaus said . The EU leaders also agreed Saturday to negotiate so-called association agreements covering economic , trade and political ties with the three Baltic_states and Slovenia within the next six months . Such accords , considered a prerequisite for nations seeking eventual membership , have already been concluded by the six non-EU nations invited to the Essen summit . Now considered irreversible , the expansion eastward is certain to transform the nature of the EU . It is expected to add_to the dominance of Germany , which in the years since the fall of the Berlin Wall has become the largest trading partner of most candidate countries . France is likely to be further marginalized politically and economically by the move . In an attempt to balance the eastward focus , French President Francois Mitterrand , with Italian and Spanish backing , won a commitment for a $ 3.3-billion aid fund for the Mediterranean region . While the Essen meeting was billed as the Eastern Europe summit , the leaders spent much of their time on the crisis in Bosnia , finally agreeing on a declaration that underscored Europe ' s commitment to a negotiated settlement and expressed support for the U.N. Protection Force . &quot; UNPROFOR should continue its crucial mission . . . , &quot; it said . The leaders seemed to be placing their hopes on peaceful ways of pressuring the Bosnian Serbs , calling_for tighter control of Serbia ' s embargo against its Bosnian cousins . The declaration made no references_to the possible use of allied air_power to push the Bosnian Serbs toward peace .</TEXT>
