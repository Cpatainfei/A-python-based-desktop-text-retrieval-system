   <HEADLINE> AL MARTINEZ : HELLO , SWEET SPIRITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I have it on good authority that Holly Hunter will win the best actress award Monday night for her portrayal of an erotic mute in &quot; The Piano. &quot; The prediction is solid . It comes from the spirit_world . Recently deceased Greta Garbo passed it on to me through Kenny Kingston , who is L.A. ' s self-proclaimed Psychic to the Stars , both living and dead . Gloria Swanson , also deceased , says Liam Neeson will win best actor for &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; &quot; All the spirits voted for ' Schindler ' s List ' as best picture too , &quot; Kingston said the other day in his Studio City home . He is a pink-faced man with glowing blond hair and a tendency toward expansive gestures . &quot; After the ceremonies , they ' re going to party at the Sinatra compound in Palm Springs . He ' ll feel them there but , of course , he won ' t see them. &quot; Kingston says all this with such disarming flamboyance that you almost believe him . At one point in our conversation he said hello to Marilyn Monroe so naturally that I turned , expecting to see her standing behind me . Is that weird or what ? I went_to see Kingston because I knew he would have some sort of telepathic contact with celebrities beyond the grave who , given their spiritual powers , could name this year ' s Oscar winners . Everyone in L.A. is talking_about the Academy Awards and making predictions . We are nothing if not a movie town . This was never clearer than at a Westside saloon the other night when two men began punching each other out over the comparative talents of Winona Ryder and Emma Thompson . I ' ve seen a lot of bar fights in my day , but never over best supporting actress . * As a columnist expected to be occasionally topical , I began scratching around for an approach to the Oscars that had not been used to excess . I even thought about a_People ' s Poll for the Worst of Everything , including worst picture of the year , worst actor and so on . My personal choice was an art film about sex in China , the name of which , thank God , I can ' t remember . It was_on an artistic level with &quot; Ace Ventura , Pet Detective , &quot; but more scatological . I was really getting_into this when Kenny Kingston called . I knew it was him before he gave his name when he said &quot; Hello , sweet spirit. &quot; He calls everyone that . He said a copy of one of the books I ' d written had fallen from a shelf in his study not once but twice and he knew it was a message from the spirit_world for him to call me . Kingston does radio and television and plays the clubs , so it was not unusual for him to telephone a newspaper source hoping for a little mention . But mostly people are directed to us by living publicists like Stan Rosenfield or Lee Solters , and not by the dead . I was intrigued by this so I said what ' re you up_to , sweet spirit , and he said that HBO and the BBC were sending crews over to televise his spiritual predictions for the Oscars . Ah ha . It was like a message from beyond for me too , telling me to be a conduit for Oscar predictions that emanate from what Shakespeare called the undiscovered country . How many other newspaper_columnists get_to be involved in a kind of daylight seance with stars who have long since taken their final bow ? * As it turned_out , Kingston didn ' t light candles , ask me to join hands or speak in tongues . He mostly bounced around his study , pausing occasionally to look off toward the distance , and handed_down the spiritual messages . After he told me who would win best actor and actress awards and what movie would be named best picture , he came_up with another flash from beyond : Liz Taylor was Michael Jackson ' s mother in another life . &quot; Richard Burton told me , &quot; he said , holding a finger to his temple . &quot; that ' s why there ' s such a strong bond between Taylor and Jackson , sweet spirit . Burton was the father . They had a baby girl who was reborn as a boy . The boy was Michael. &quot; That was an extra he threw_in before he quoted James Dean as saying Tommy Lee Jones would win best supporting actor for &quot; The Fugitive &quot; and ( quoting Ingrid Bergman ) Emma Thompson would win for &quot; In the Name of the Father. &quot; As I thought_about it later , I felt a little silly for having sat there taking_notes for two hours and asking Kingston to repeat comments he was receiving from the dead , but what the hell . It ' s almost spring and I ' m taking a short vacation and this is a nice way of dancing off the stage before the rotten eggs fly . By the way , sweet spirits , I just remembered , the name of that lousy movie was &quot; Sex and Zen. &quot; It ' s about a man and his dog and his concubine in the Mysterious East . Michael Landon says don ' t bring the kids . Amen .</TEXT>
