   <HEADLINE> ASIA ; FILM-STAR FAMOUS , INDIAN REFORMER IS FACING A FALL ; THE PUBLIC LOVES CRUSADING ELECTION OFFICIAL T.N. SESHAN . BUT HIS IMPERIOUS WAYS HAVE IRKED THE RULING PARTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rogue_elephant of Indian politics is , it seems , about to be de-tusked . Central Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan is the only occupant of his office to have enforced tough controls on political campaigning and spending . He has tried to eliminate the advantages enjoyed by incumbents by , for instance , limiting the number of cars in campaign motorcades . This crusading , sharp-tongued Brahmin from south India has become the hero of the country ' s middle_classes , who had despaired of being able to rid politics of corruption , nepotism and other malpractices . But there are signs that the former career civil_servant with imperious ways has overplayed his hand . &quot; He has struck the fear of God into all parties , &quot; comments Vinod Mehta , editor of the influential Pioneer newspaper . &quot; All of them think they will be the gainers if they see the back of this chap. &quot; Mehta believes that public adoration may have gone_to Seshan ' s head , paving the way to what could be his downfall . &quot; I went_to a public function and was amazed at the number of people queuing_up for his autograph , &quot; Mehta said . &quot; He ' s like a film star. &quot; Such acclaim , Mehta says , may have made the 61-year-old Seshan an &quot; autocrat. &quot; Last month , he postponed six partial elections in the state of Uttar Pradesh until September because the chief minister there , Mulayam Singh Yadav , improperly used a government helicopter to campaign . The Supreme Court , which had told Seshan to cool his often-acerbic public rhetoric a_few weeks earlier , quickly ruled that he had exceeded his powers and ordered the election held as soon as possible . Voters went_to the polls May 31 . The knives are out for Seshan in the ruling Congress-I Party , because before he took the job in December , 1990 , chief election commissioners had been docile servants of their political masters . Because Seshan holds a constitutional office , he cannot be fired . Now his foes have come_up with a new gambit . There are now two other election commissioners , but only the chief is empowered by the constitution . Congress leaders want to amend the document to give the other commissioners , who are harmless ciphers , the same theoretical powers as Seshan and to require that all decisions be taken by a majority . Seshan will then be outnumbered . The ruling party has a simple majority in Parliament but needs a two-thirds majority to amend the constitution . Parleys are going_on with opposition forces , although the largest , the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party , mindful of Seshan ' s enormous middle-class support , has taken the chief commissioner ' s side . The first shot will likely be fired when Indian lawmakers assemble Monday for a special brief session to allow the introduction of a bill on election law &quot; reforms. &quot; Seshan has refused to be cowed . Alluding to his considerable girth , he has said : &quot; I have been in this dieting business for years . I haven ' t been able to cut my size . How can anyone else cut my size ? that ' s impossible. &quot; Mehta believes that if Congress and other parties succeed in diluting his powers , Seshan will quit and run_for political office . But whoever succeeds him , he says , will be very conscious that &quot; he is sitting in Seshan ' s chair. &quot;</TEXT>
