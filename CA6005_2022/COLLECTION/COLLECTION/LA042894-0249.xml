   <HEADLINE> PRODUCTION OF HUMAN ANTIBODIES IN MICE REPORTED ; SCIENCE : TWO CALIFORNIA COMPANIES ACHIEVE A GENETIC ENGINEERING BREAKTHROUGH . IT MAY ALLOW ADVANCES IN TREATMENT OF A WIDE VARIETY OF DISEASES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a development that could lead to major improvements in the treatment of autoimmune_diseases , cancer , AIDS and organ rejection in humans , two California companies report today that they have been able to genetically engineer mice so that they produce human antibodies . Mouse cells that produce these antibodies can then be grown in laboratory vats to produce large amounts of so-called monoclonal_antibodies that , when given to patients , can attack and destroy diseased cells . Monoclonal antibodies have shown great promise in treating many diseases in humans , but they suffer a major drawback : Existing monoclonals have all been produced in mice or other rodents , and the body quickly develops an immune_reaction to them , limiting their use to only one or two treatments . The human antibodies , whose development is reported today in the_British journals Nature and Nature Genetics , represent a major advance because they should not provoke an immune_response in people , allowing long-term therapy with the biotechnology drugs . Although the two companies have more studies to conduct in animals , they predict that trials in humans could begin as early as next year , probably for use in transplants and autoimmune_diseases such_as rheumatoid_arthritis . &quot; This is a significant breakthrough , &quot; said UCLA immunologist Sherie L . Morrison . &quot; They have really established the feasibility of a new way of making human antibodies. &quot; &quot; We are really excited because this is a tremendous opportunity for new therapeutic agents , &quot; added molecular biologist Robert M . Kay , vice_president for research and development at GenPharm International of Mountain View , one of the two companies . &quot; We hope we will be able to treat diseases that we have not been able to adequately address in the past. &quot; The second company is Cell Genesys Inc. of Foster City . Monoclonal antibodies were first produced 20 years ago , a feat that earned their creators a Nobel Prize . They are produced by fusing a single antibody-producing mouse spleen cell with a mouse tumor cell to produce a new cell known as a hybridoma . Hybridomas can be grown in vats to produce large quantities of the antibody and , because of their heritage from the cancer_cells , are effectively immortal . Human hybridomas cannot be readily produced , however , because it would be necessary to inject a human volunteer with the disease-related chemical or cell that researchers desire to produce an antibody against ; then they would have to remove the spleen to isolate the few cells that produce antibodies against that specific substance . Neither act is ethically defensible . GenPharm and Cell Genesys achieved their feats in a similar fashion . In both cases , they disabled the mouse genes that produce antibodies and replaced them with comparable human genes . The human antibodies thus become a functioning part of the mouse ' s own immune_system . The process involves sophisticated genetic_engineering techniques that have not been available until recently . The new developments are substantially different from earlier feats in which intact human immune_systems were produced in mice by injecting human bone_marrow and other tissue into mice with no immune_system of_their_own . Although those mice are valuable in their own_right , they cannot be used to produce monoclonal_antibodies . The production of monoclonal_antibodies is viewed_as one of the areas of greatest growth potential in the biotechnology industry . According to a recent estimate by Frost &amp; Sullivan Market Intelligence of Mountain View , sales of the proteins totaled $ 740 million in 1993 and are expected to grow to $ 3.8 billion by 1998 . Many of those commercial monoclonal_antibodies are used for medical imaging . When injected into a cancer patient , for example , the appropriate monoclonal_antibody will bind to the tumor cells , showing them up more clearly on X-rays . The proteins are also widely used in laboratory diagnostic tests to help physicians determine the concentration of important chemicals in the blood . But their use in therapy has been limited so far . The most successful product is an antibody called OKT3 that is used to suppress rejection episodes in organ transplant recipients . Although it is very successful , OKT3 can generally be used only once in a given patient because of the immune_response against it . Transplant surgeons hope the development of human monoclonal_antibodies will allow a comparable drug to be used repeatedly . Many different monoclonal_antibodies for the treatment of cancer are also in various stages of testing . Kay said his company has already used the genetically engineered mice to produce human monoclonal_antibodies against CD4 , an immune cell that plays a crucial role in autoimmune_diseases ; against immunoglobulin E , which mediates allergic_reactions ; and against carcinoembryonic antigen , a distinctive marker found on the surfaces of colon and ovarian cancer_cells . GenPharm plans to begin animal studies with the antibodies as soon as possible , he added . Cell Genesys said it is now immunizing its mice in an attempt to produce antibodies against a variety of human proteins .</TEXT>
