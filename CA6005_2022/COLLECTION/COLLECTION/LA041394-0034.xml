   <HEADLINE> A MAN OF HIS WORDS ; IN HIS POEMS , 1994 PULITZER PRIZE_WINNER WRITES OF THOSE USING STRENGTH AND SPIRITUAL TENACITY TO SURVIVE -- LIKE HIMSELF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thanks for the tree between me &amp; a sniper ' s bullet . I don ' t know what made the grass sway seconds before the Viet Cong raised his soundless rifle . Some voice always followed , telling me which foot to put_down first . -- From &quot; Thanks , &quot; by Yusef Komunyakaa * Yusef Komunyakaa , who won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for poetry on Tuesday for his collection &quot; Neon Vernacular , &quot; has much to say about survival . His autobiographical poems are rooted in his struggles with racial tensions and Vietnam horrors . &quot; I see myself coming from a community of strong survivors who refuse to be victims , &quot; he says , &quot; because victims are defeated before the fight begins. &quot; That refusal to play the victim is where he believes he differs with many of the higher-profile &quot; poets &quot; of today : top-selling rap stars . &quot; I originally wanted to embrace the imagery and forthrightness of rap_music , &quot; he says . &quot; There are some interesting , dynamic voices in rap . But I find most of it irresponsible in its overt violence and commercialization of anger . &quot; As artists , we believe we can will action through language . If that ' s the case , we have to take responsibility for what we say. &quot; Last week , Komunyakaa was at Claremont Graduate_School to receive the second annual Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award , at $ 50 # 000 the largest prize bestowed for a single work , also for &quot; Neon Vernacular. &quot; &quot; The work had great vitality . It was almost electrically compelling , &quot; says judging panelist Sandra Gilbert , a poet , critic and professor of English at UC Davis . &quot; I was excited by the way he combines colloquial language with poetic language and uses images and themes from jazz music. &quot; Back in his tidy cinder-block office at Indiana University , where he is a professor of English and Afro-American studies , Komunyakaa shrugs . &quot; I really should have a copy. &quot; But no , the prize-winning collection of new poems and selections from his earlier works is not yet on either of the two orderly bookcases that are the room ' s only personalizing touches . Like his surroundings , the poet is subdued -- black_and_white checked shirt , dark trousers , wire-rim glasses , short hair beginning to gray . He speaks in a deliberate , quiet voice that hints more of Australia , where he has traveled extensively , than of rural Louisiana where he grew_up . On Tuesday , Komunyakaa said he didn ' t even know he had been nominated for the Pulitzer . &quot; I was very surprised , but in a sense , it sort of tells me that I ' m going_in the right direction in my work . that ' s my gut-level reaction , &quot; he told the Associated Press , noting that his plans for the rest of the day included teaching his 4 p.m. workshop of &quot; young , bright writers. &quot; &quot; After that , I ' m going_to sit_down and think_about it , &quot; he says . Much of Komunyakaa ' s work flows_from the struggle to define his status as a black male and a Vietnam veteran . His poetry , he says , attempts to emphasize the strength and spiritual tenacity of his generation . &quot; For the black male , most people see this as a negative time , &quot; he says . &quot; In these troubling moments , more people are attempting to define themselves with violence as a background. &quot; Komunyakaa ' s experiences in Vietnam help him put these visions into some perspective . &quot; Vietnam helped me to look_at the horror and terror in the hearts of people and realize how we can ' t aim guns and set booby_traps for people we have never spoken a word to . That kind of impersonal violence mystifies me. &quot; Komunyakaa realizes that this same sort of haphazard anger is still powerful in American inner_cities . &quot; I see many black males grasping for some thread of hope . There are so many destructive practices , glimpses into a psychic abyss . That must be very frightening. &quot; * Komunyakaa lives in Bloomington with his wife , Mandy , and has a daughter from a previous relationship . Although he concedes that he adopted his name for cultural and religious reasons , he prefers to keep his private life private . He grew_up in Bogalusa , La. , a continuing source of inspiration . &quot; My father always believed if you worked hard , you could make_it in America , which now seems an almost insidious idea . He worked 12 to 14 hours a day and saw others who were hard_workers yet weren ' t paid that much . I questioned those contradictions from early on. &quot; Like so many of his generation , Komunyakaa left the rural South for the military . He spent some time stateside before being sent to Vietnam . In time , he became a correspondent and editor of the Southern Cross , a military newspaper . &quot; Being from the South , I didn ' t fear the vegetation and climate of Vietnam nearly as much as if I had been from an urban environment . I could identify with the landscape and with the Vietnamese people as_a_whole . That made_it very hard to hate them as the enemy. &quot; When he returned from Vietnam , Komunyakaa felt disengaged from U.S. society , feeling kinship both with his fellow vets and with those protesting the war . His experiences and emotions found their voice in poems . &quot; In 1973 , I was in a creative writing workshop taught by Dr. Alex Blackburn ( at the University of Colorado ) . He gave me some wonderful criticism and made me believe that I could write poetry. &quot; Thinking_back to his earliest poem , written in high_school , Komunyakaa concedes that he had a lot to learn . &quot; It was 100 lines in rhymed quatrains , very traditional and very verbose . It was influenced by the poetry I had read in school -- mostly British. &quot; Later , he drew inspiration from such black poets as Frances Harper , Langston Hughes , Robert Hayden , Melvin Tolson and Gwendolyn Brooks . &quot; Black poets were voices I could hear inside my own head. &quot; After earning degrees from Colorado , Colorado State and UC Irvine , he published the collections &quot; Copacetic , &quot; &quot; I Apologize for the Eyes in My Head , &quot; Dien Cai Dau &quot; and &quot; Magic City. &quot; His honors include two National Endowment for the Arts creative writing fellowships , the 1991 Kenyon Review Award for Literary Excellence and the San Francisco Poetry Center Award . &quot; Neon Vernacular &quot; was selected from 247 works to win the Tufts award , established in 1992 through an endowment grant of more_than $ 1.25 million given to Claremont Graduate_School by Kate Tufts to honor her late husband , poet and writer Kingsley Tufts , says Peter Harris , Claremont assistant director for publications . Its $ 50 # 000 prize will help give Komunyakaa space to work_on his three current projects -- and a bit of celebrity for a solitary artist . When a university colleague shouts congratulations from the hallway , Komunyakaa humbly waves . But he admits that recognition makes_it easier to approach his works_in_progress . &quot; It underlines the fact that maybe you ' re going in the right direction as a poet , &quot; he says . &quot; When you operate in an intense vacuum , it ' s nice to take a moment to step outside and look_at your work. &quot;</TEXT>
