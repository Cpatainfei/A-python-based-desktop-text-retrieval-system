   <HEADLINE> SAN ONOFRE PROPOSAL GENERATES RENEWED DEBATE ; UTILITIES : A RECOMMENDATION TO CLOSE THE ALWAYS CONTROVERSIAL NUCLEAR POWER_PLANT IN 1998 HAS ADVOCATES AND OPPONENTS FOCUSING_ON ECONOMIC ISSUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Controversy has surrounded the San Onofre nuclear_power plant since that afternoon in 1968 when former Rep . Chet Holifield pulled the ceremonial first switch , sparking the 395-megawatt Unit 1 reactor . Holifield was joined by Glenn T . Seaborg of the Atomic Energy Commission at the opening of what was then the world ' s largest nuclear_energy producer . &quot; We are substantially further along in the peaceful use of the atom than any other country , &quot; Seaborg told the luncheon gathering at the 83-acre Camp Pendleton site leased from the Marine Corps . Fifteen years later , two other reactor units were built_on the site , each rated to supply 1 # 127 megawatts of electricity . But the 26-year history of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station -- which supplies 12 % of the power used by customers of Southern California Edison , the principal owner -- has not been so peaceful . Anti-nuclear groups concerned about radiation , ocean pollution and the possibility of a nuclear catastrophe have rallied against the plant since the 1960s . This year , opponents of the plant found a powerful ally in the Division of Ratepayer Advocates , a department of the Public_Utilities Commission , that has put the future of the entire plant at stake . Ratepayer advocates contended at a proceeding last April that the plant ' s operating_costs are far too high and that SCE customers could save as much as $ 1 billion if the plant closed_in 1998 , 15 years ahead of schedule . The PUC is not expected to act_on the recommendation until December or early next year , but debate over the San Onofre issue has again been stoked . Radioactive waste and safety issues aside , opponents argue , the nuclear_energy industry is dead in this country because cheaper sources of power -- natural_gas , solar , wind -- are available . &quot; Nuclear power is not cost-effective , &quot; said Marion Pack , spokeswoman for the Santa Ana-based Alliance for Survival , which opposes nuclear_power . &quot; Whether San Onofre is shut_in 1998 or 2013 , we are still going_to have people who need to be retrained and moved_into new employment . Let ' s get_on_with it. &quot; Proponents , who include union_representatives of the plant ' s workers , dispute the DRA ' s figures and point_out San Onofre ' s importance to the Southern California economy and that nuclear_power does not pollute the air . &quot; San Onofre is absolutely vital to our community , &quot; said David N . Lund , San Clemente ' s director of economic development . &quot; To just decide to shut a plant down that employs nearly 3 # 000 people , with a $ 1.2-billion impact on the region , has to be done very , very carefully. &quot; What ' s more , the pressure to close the plant comes at a time when it has never operated more smoothly , say officials of Southern California Edison , which owns 75 % of the plant . San Diego Gas &amp; Electric owns another 20 % , with utilities in Anaheim and Riverside owning about 5 % . The original reactor was closed_in November , 1992 , after similar rounds of PUC hearings , but Units 2 and 3 are now operating at more_than 80 % of capacity , considered a mark of superior performance in the industry , said Joe Wambold , manager of business and finance for the nuclear department of SCE . &quot; This may be a banner year for production , &quot; said Wambold , a Laguna Niguel resident . &quot; Unit 2 has been_on line for more_than 370 days of continual service of full power . We are very proud_of our record. &quot; Wambold said SCE has filed a lengthy rebuttal to the DRA recommendation . &quot; Our fundamental position is that we have demonstrated that this plant is the lowest-cost alternative to our customers , &quot; Wambold said . &quot; Whether from the viewpoint of economics , safety , impacts on the environment or waste disposal , the facts speak very well for the continued operation of these plants. &quot; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s , the debate over nuclear_power centered_on issues of safety and security . Today the focus has shifted to questions of radioactive waste storage and economics . &quot; I think if you asked the average citizen what their greatest concern is when it comes_to nuclear_power , they ' d still say safety , &quot; said Chris Nichols , a spokeswoman for the Washington-based Safe Energy Communication Council , a nuclear watchdog agency . &quot; But people are looking_at their pocketbook these days on all issues. &quot; DRA officials estimate that it costs as much as $ 600 million a year to operate Units 2 and 3 at San Onofre . Electrical rates are particularly high in California primarily because of the nuclear investments that local utilities have made , they say . &quot; Wall_Street has definitely rejected nuclear_power , &quot; Nichols said . &quot; You can ' t get financing , and when you can ' t get financing , that ' s a resounding statement. &quot; Nuclear power advocates agree that no new nuclear plants are being built_in the United States but note that they are moving forward elsewhere in the world , including in Japan , Germany and Korea . To abandon nuclear_power , particularly for such an exhaustible commodity as natural_gas , would be shortsighted , they argue . &quot; The strength of our electrical_system is the diversity of our fuel supply , &quot; said Marvin Fertel , vice_president of the Nuclear Energy Institute in Washington . &quot; That was proven last January in the East during that bad cold_wave . The coal piles froze , the oil_tankers couldn ' t get_to shore because of frozen ports , and natural_gas was needed for other industrial and residential uses . But nuclear_power stayed_on line. &quot; Only a_few years ago natural_gas was considered too expensive to burn for electricity , but &quot; now it ' s a panacea , &quot; Fertel said . &quot; We really shouldn ' t rely_on any one particular source for electricity , &quot; he said . &quot; We all take electricity for granted , but it ' s really important to our quality of life. &quot; The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station is scheduled to close_in 2013 , when its license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission expires .
