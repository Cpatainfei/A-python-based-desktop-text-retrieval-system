   <HEADLINE> MIGHTY DUCKS / ' 94- ' 95 PREVIEW ; RUSSIAN CONNECTION ; FOR THREE YOUNG DUCKS , OFF-ICE ADJUSTMENTS ARE THE TOUGHEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some of the most demanding practices Valeri Karpov has faced in the NHL were conducted at the dining_room table of his still-bare Irvine apartment , with his sticks propped in a corner near the front_door and his other equipment lying outside on the patio . &quot; Imagine I ' m a real_estate_broker , and you come_in and tell me what you want , &quot; said Dimitri Agratchev , a Walt Disney Co . translator and tutor . &quot; How can I help you ? &quot; &quot; Do you have any house ? &quot; Karpov asked_in a slightly halting voice . Agratchev : &quot; What do you do ? For a living ? What is your job ? &quot; Karpov : &quot; I work for hockey_team , Anaheim ? &quot; Agratchev : &quot; You work for a hockey_team ? You are a player ? Oh , wonderful ! I have many houses for you . Are you looking_to buy or rent ? Karpov : &quot; Rent . I need three bedrooms , with a yard for my son ? &quot; Agratchev : &quot; How much would you like to pay ? Karpov : &quot; As little as possible. &quot; Agratchev : &quot; That is not always good . . . . Would you be prepared to go a little higher for a place ideal for a child with a big yard and a swimming_pool ? &quot; Karpov : &quot; OK . Good deal. &quot; Agratchev : &quot; How important is a swimming_pool ? &quot; Karpov : &quot; Very. &quot; Agratchev : &quot; Important ? &quot; Karpov : &quot; Very important. &quot; Agratchev : &quot; Can you live without a swimming_pool ? &quot; Karpov : &quot; Better with a swimming pool. &quot; A swimming_pool is not a necessity in Chelyabinsk , the industrial city Karpov is from in the Ural mountains . It ' s known as the place where Siberia begins . A dishwasher and a &quot; meek-row-wave &quot; are other items Karpov wanted to have ready before his wife and 1-year-old son arrived this month . Karpov ' s world-class hockey ability has brought him to a new life in Anaheim at 23 , along with two other rookies from the former Soviet_Union . Nikolai Tsulygin , 19 , is from Ufa in the autonomous Russian republic of Bashkiria , home to a huge oil_refinery around which much of the life of the town revolves , and Oleg Tverdovsky , who holds a Russian passport but is from Donetsk , a mining town in the coal fields of economically strapped Ukraine . Life is harder and more bleak in their cities than in the more cosmopolitan and European cities of Moscow and St . Petersburg . If not for hockey , Tsulygin would probably have followed his mother and father into the road-building industry , for which he has a technical degree . Tverdovsky , asked what he might be doing , only beams . &quot; I cannot really imagine life without hockey. &quot; To discuss what is different about their new_world is to begin a conversation that would never end . &quot; Everything , &quot; Karpov says simply , with a shrug and a smile . Here , there are bank machines at almost any corner or convenience_store , ready to spew forth money . &quot; How convenient , &quot; Karpov notes in Russian . In all_of Moscow , there may be three , he says . Here , there are cellular_phones available in every stereo store -- a definite threat to any budget -- and an endless array of hockey highlight tapes and video_games . How do you say video_game in Russian ? Karpov shrugs the shrug again and laughs . &quot; Nintendo. &quot; Still , as fortunate as they feel to be playing hockey and making a living beyond their imagination in North_America , the young Russian players are sensitive to the sort of post-Cold War American superiority they sometimes feel is a personal put-down . &quot; That is the sort of thing we have to deal with , that people sometimes dismiss Russia as a backward country , &quot; Tverdovsky said . &quot; Sometimes they hear us speak Russian in a store someplace , and they look_at you in a different way as if you come from this really different and backward place . While it is true that Russia and the economy , in particular , are in decline , I feel that it has nothing to do with people as individuals and it ' s very unfair to treat people in that way. &quot; They also notice the way people sometimes speak_to them as if they are not very intelligent at best and children at worst -- even though they know more English than those who look down their noses at them do Russian . &quot; To get_away from that , one needs to learn English , &quot; Tverdovsky says simply in Russian . Russian players are no longer an anomaly in the NHL . The Ducks ' Anatoli Semenov , 32 , is a five-year veteran and Vancouver ' s Pavel Bure , 23 , is one of the league ' s biggest stars . But the adjustment to a new language and culture is still difficult for the new players who arrive -- and one some players make more quickly than others . Karpov , who is four or five years older than the other Russian rookies and players who played for Russia in the Olympics at Lillehammer , has had no trouble stepping_on the ice , where he is_on a line with rookie Paul Kariya and Semenov . And though he knew only the Cyrillic_alphabet when he arrived in California this summer , he has now passed his written and driving exams to acquire his driver ' s license after several attempts . Tverdovsky is the youngest of the Russian rookies and , at 18 , is here without any family , unlike the others , who are both married . But he has a playful , outgoing personality and -- knowing where he was headed -- he took English in high_school , where he made almost all 5s , the equivalent of a near straight-A student . He is given to concluding translated interviews with a startling , only slightly accented comment , such_as , &quot; Next time we interview in English. &quot; Tverdovsky ' s big accomplishment so far was passing the written test for his license on the first attempt -- something many native English speakers fail to do . But the driving test ? &quot; It takes certain skills that are not the way people drive on_the_road , &quot; he said through Agratchev . &quot; They want you to keep turning your head , like on a swivel . And go very slowly and keep looking_at the speedometer. &quot; Tsulygin , a gangly youth whose slouched shoulders suggest an adolescent awkwardness , negotiated a contract that would allow him to return to Russia this season , and has been assigned to the Central Red Army team . Returning home is not always an appealing option . Tverdovsky , who was born in Ukraine but chose Russian citizenship in_order to play with the more competitive Russian national teams , hopes to live here permanently , bringing his parents and 9-year-old sister with him . After signing a three-year , $ 4.2-million contract this summer , he must be wary of reports of extortion attempts by Russian organized crime . &quot; Yes , he is aware that it is a concern , and if he goes_back he will go_to the Ukraine , &quot; Agratchev said . &quot; He will not go_to Moscow and spend time in Moscow because there he feels is not very safe . It is not as if you are guaranteed as soon as you come_to Moscow you will be hit or something , but certainly it is not very safe. &quot; Agratchev , a former professor and high-level simultaneous interpreter , works for Walt Disney Co . Chairman Michael Eisner as an international business development adviser . He tutored Karpov and Tsulygin extensively during the summer , and has helped Tverdovsky at the draft and when he arrived shortly before training camp . He has taught them English from a text designed for practical living , from &quot; Making Wise Purchases in the Grocery_Store &quot; to &quot; Housing for the Family. &quot; One chapter they can skip is Unit 8 : &quot; Finding a Job. &quot; On the ice , the players rely_on the universal language of the game , where a stick tapped sharply on the ice is calling_for a pass , and a defensive pair learn intuitively which defender will take the man and which will chase down the puck . New drills can be a challenge , which is why Coach Ron Wilson looks_to see where the young Russian players are before starting a drill at a spot in the line well in front of them , giving them a chance to watch and imitate . Wilson was in Vancouver when Bure arrived speaking little English , and his attitude is that the players have no option but to immerse . He will not learn any Russian himself . &quot; I don ' t know a word except , ' Nyet , ' he said , and then added a teasing reference_to his U.S. team ' s victory over Russia in the World Championships last spring . &quot; Whenever they ' re getting too big , I just say , ' USA 3 , Russia 1. ' &quot; The biggest challenges are the everyday ones , like understanding the American banking system . Karpov ' s joke is that the best Russian_bank is &quot; in a stocking at home. &quot; Buying a car is difficult , too , with the option to lease and the confusing absence of a hard-and-fast price ( imagine the palpitations of a car salesman ' s heart when he realizes he has a young millionaire who barely knows the language on his lot ) . There are embarrassing moments , too , like the time when Tverdovsky saw a young_woman in a store who had in her hand the exact item he was searching for . He pointed and tried to tell her he wanted something &quot; like &quot; that , only to have the girl think he was telling her he &quot; liked &quot; her . Their feelings about life at_home in Russia are mixed , because the political upheaval has brought both good changes and bad . Tverdovsky , who knew little of the Russian Orthodox church as a child , now wears a gold crucifix on a chain around his neck . &quot; When I was little in the old Communist days , I knew very little about it , &quot; he said in Russian . &quot; These were not things people talk_about or things people did . I know I was christened , baptized in a church . Yes , I feel it is an important part of life to go_to church . It makes you feel good to go. &quot; No matter the economic difficulties or the brutalities of the old regime , these players have been proud to play for Russian national and junior national teams and hope to do so again , even if most of their time is spent in North_America . &quot; Of course it matters a great_deal . It ' s very important ( that we are ) Russian , &quot; Tverdovsky said in Russian . &quot; I think to anybody the country where a person was born and raised , it ' s a great honor and privilege to represent that country on its national team. &quot; Karpov ' s son was born in Russia , but will not be raised there . &quot; I think he ' ll get a lot more opportunities , and an opportunity to get a better education certainly , than at_home , &quot; Karpov said through Agratchev . &quot; He will be able to adapt much better to normal American life -- much better than his parents . He will in many ways probably grow_up to be American . I ' m saying that because I know some_other Russian kids who came_over who were even older who are like Americans now . My wife and I will try to do our best to make him learn the Russian language and not ignore the place we are from. &quot; Foreign Farm System ? Players in the Mighty Ducks organization who are from cities in what was once the Soviet_Union : Moscow : Anatoli Semenov , Mikhail Shtalenkov Donetsk : Oleg Tverdovsky Chelyabinsk : Valeri Karpov , Maxim Bets Ufa : Nikolai Tsulygin</TEXT>
