   <HEADLINE> WHOOPI ! THERE IT IS : GOLDBERG TO HOST OSCARS ; AWARDS : PERFORMER BREAKS NEW GROUND - FIRST WOMAN AND FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN AS SOLO MASTER OF CEREMONIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whoopi Goldberg was named Sunday to host this year ' s Academy Awards show , ending a difficult search to replace its previous popular master of ceremonies , Billy Crystal . Once Crystal declined to front this year ' s event for a fifth straight year , one of the biggest guessing games in Hollywood was who producer Gil Cates would call_upon . Cates was mum and would not confirm reports that such entertainers as Bette Midler , Johnny Carson , Tom Hanks and Steve Martin had also declined . One veteran Oscar insider connected with a major studio said that the five nominees for best picture ( which will be announced Wednesday morning ) has been easier to predict than guessing who Cates would ultimately persuade to do the March 21 show . Through her publicist , Goldberg said Sunday she is &quot; thrilled about my date with Oscar . To go from watching to winning to hosting in one lifetime is major. &quot; The 44-year-old performer , currently shooting &quot; Boys on the Side &quot; in Pittsburgh , won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in the 1990 romantic comedy , &quot; Ghost. &quot; The selection of Goldberg is a departure for the Oscar show , where white males have predominated as masters of ceremonies . Not only will Goldberg be the first woman solo host , she also will be the show ' s first solo African American host . &quot; I think it ' s a terrific choice and she ' ll do a wonderful job , &quot; Crystal said Sunday . &quot; And I ' m happy for her , the Academy and the fans of the show. &quot; Cates , who is in his fifth year producing the Oscar extravaganza , said Goldberg has &quot; all_the qualities of a great Oscar host , &quot; noting she is a highly recognizable star who has millions of fans . In an earlier interview , Cates told The Times , &quot; I ' ll miss Billy . He was really wonderful . The parting was sad , but really amicable . I understand you do_it for four years and it gets_to be a grind . Last year they really struggled about how he would top his entrances of previous years . And I understand that problem . Each year I ' ve said it ' s going_to be my last , too. &quot; With the exception of Crystal , Cates ' &quot; team &quot; is returning : director Jeff Margolis , choreographer Debbie Allen and music_director Tom Conti . Cates , the 59-year-old dean of UCLA ' s School of Theater , Film and Television , is an Emmy Award-winning producer who has directed for stage , TV and movies for more_than 30 years . In pointing to the importance of the host ' s role , Cates stresses the unique qualities of the Academy Awards presentations : &quot; It ' s the oldest mass show in the country . It ties together events that have taken_place all through the previous year . It ' s the reflection ( of ) how much impact movies and visual imagery have_on our conscience . This is one of our culture ' s only mass events that appeals_to children and grandparents alike. &quot; One billion people worldwide are estimated to view the show . * The next event on_the_road to this year ' s Oscars is the Wednesday morning announcement of nominations . Many film_industry watchers believe the top film Oscar nominations will closely resemble the Directors Guild of America ' s field of five movies for its best director prize : &quot; The Piano , &quot; &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; &quot; The Remains of the Day , &quot; &quot; The Age of Innocence &quot; and &quot; Schindler ' s List. &quot; Hollywood film companies are poised to take_advantage of the prestige and publicity that nominations can bring_to a movie , and thus give a boost to ticket sales . The distributors of such likely Oscar-nominated movies as &quot; The Piano , &quot; &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; among others , already have contingency plans . &quot; If we ' re lucky enough to get the nomination , &quot; said Miramax Films co-chairman Harvey Weinstein , the distributor of &quot; The Piano , &quot; &quot; you ' ll see 300 more prints on screens by Friday , &quot; bringing the film ' s total to 800 prints . That would compare to the number of theaters Miramax had for &quot; The Crying Game , &quot; its 1992 multiple-nominated movie , at this time last year . Weinstein said &quot; The Crying Game &quot; had grossed under $ 20 million and &quot; The Piano &quot; has taken_in $ 24 million to date . But after its Oscar nominations , &quot; The Crying Game &quot; went_on to reach $ 63 million . &quot; At this point , everyone recognizes that ' Schindler ' s List ' is the favorite and a fantastic movie , but you never know , &quot; Weinstein said . &quot; The race is just beginning. &quot; A spokesperson for Warner Bros. , which distributed &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; said that no matter which way the nominations go , the popular summer film will be reissued nationally on Friday . At Universal Pictures , the distributor of &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; the plan had always been to slowly open the film from its December debut to the present . &quot; The public demand is reason enough to expand the movie , &quot; said Nikki Rocco , Universal senior_vice_president of distribution and marketing . &quot; We will continue increasing its play dates . We ' re in_for a very long run. &quot; As of last weekend , the film was at 354 movie_theaters , or the nation ' s top 150 markets . By this Friday , it will be in 750 locations , Rocco said . The nominations themselves will be revealed in front of 500 credentialed members of the news media at the pre-dawn hour of 5:30 in_order to maximize publicity opportunities , timing the announcements for the East Coast-based morning talk_shows . The 8:30 a.m. segment of those network shows will carry the reading of the nominees by Academy president Arthur Hiller and 1992 supporting actress winner Marisa Tomei , live from the Beverly Hills headquarters of the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences .</TEXT>
