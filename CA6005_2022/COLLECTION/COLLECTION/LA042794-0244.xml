   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; NATIONAL , WORLD FIGURES TOP GUEST LIST ; DIGNITARIES : DIPLOMATS FROM 86 NATIONS , PLUS CLINTON AND ALL FOUR EX-PRESIDENTS , WILL ATTEND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Diplomats from 86 nations will attend today ' s funeral for former President Richard Nixon , joined by a host of government leaders past and present in mourning a man who played a central role in American politics for five decades , officials announced Tuesday . For some who served under Nixon in an administration that was cut_short by Watergate , the solemn occasion at the site of Nixon ' s birthplace will mark a reunion of sorts . &quot; I ' m looking_forward to seeing a lot of old friends , &quot; said Robert H . Finch , a former California lieutenant_governor who served under Nixon as Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare . &quot; It ' ll be a chance to share war stories. &quot; There will be no shortage of luminaries . President Clinton will be there , along with all four of his living predecessors -- Gerald R . Ford , Jimmy_Carter , Ronald Reagan and George_Bush . Henry Kissinger , Sen . Robert Dole and Gov . Pete Wilson will all deliver eulogies , and a planeload of current and former Administration leaders will descend on Orange County as well . Among the more well-known figures from the Nixon era who are expected to attend : Spiro Agnew , Caspar Weinberger , Alexander M . Haig Jr. , George P . Shultz and Patrick Buchanan . So wide is the political mix among the guests that a White_House briefing in Washington on Tuesday quickly turned_to speculation about whether Air_Force One , which will carry both Nixon ' s old crew and current Administration officials , will have to be divided . &quot; The Republicans on the right , Democrats on the left ? &quot; one reporter asked jokingly . &quot; This will be an integrated trip , &quot; quipped White_House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers . One reporter then wondered aloud whether there would be a seat reserved for &quot; Deep Throat , &quot; the source that Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein made famous in &quot; All the President ' s Men , &quot; their book on the Watergate scandal . Officials at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace have been promising to make public a list of guests since the weekend , but nothing had been released as of late Tuesday . Instead , names have been trickling out from around the country . In Washington , officials on Tuesday announced the 86 countries that are expected to send representatives -- from Angola to Zambia . The European Union and the United Nations will also send representatives . Among the most prominent foreign diplomats expected to attend are former Prime_Minister Edward Heath of Great Britain , former President Chaim Herzog of Israel , and former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan . No current heads_of_state are known to be attending , a reflection , in part , of the fact that the service is being held_in Orange County rather than Washington . Nixon made_it known before his death that he did not want to lie_in state in the Capitol Rotunda , in a city that he felt had abandoned him during Watergate . That effectively eliminated the chance for foreign dignitaries to combine the trip with diplomatic issues , officials said . Many of the guests from around the United States and the world began arriving Tuesday . At the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point , hotel officials said they had five to 10 rooms reserved for government officials who are attending the funeral . Most of the dignitaries stayed_away_from the library Tuesday as thousands of people withstood rain and hail for the former President ' s public viewing . But Gov . Wilson and his wife , Gayle , made a late-afternoon appearance , leaving a wreath of yellow roses near the casket as they stood_in silent prayer for a_few moments . &quot; He was a friend for more_than 30 years , &quot; said Wilson , who served as an aide to Nixon when the former President ran unsuccessfully for California governor in 1962 . Wilson ' s potential opponent in November , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , will also attend . But it won ' t be all politicians at the funeral . Orange County fast-food baron Carl N . Karcher , who met Nixon in the 1940s when he was campaigning for a seat in Congress , said he , too , plans to attend today ' s event . Karcher recalled Tuesday that Pat and Richard Nixon used to send his family a holiday wreath each year to decorate the front_door of their Anaheim home . Last fall , when Karcher was forced_out as chairman of the Carl ' s Jr . restaurant_chain , Nixon wrote him a personal_letter . &quot; He wished me success . . . . He was a warm person , a person you could talk to very comfortably , &quot; he said . Karcher said it ' s fitting for Nixon to be buried at the side of his wife , Pat . &quot; I know that after her burial he wanted to be alone ( at the grave site ) for a while , &quot; Karcher said . &quot; Now he can be with her for eternity. &quot; Who ' s Coming_to Yorba Linda President Clinton , four former Presidents and dignitaries from 86 countries are among the guests expected to attend Richard Nixon ' s funeral today .
