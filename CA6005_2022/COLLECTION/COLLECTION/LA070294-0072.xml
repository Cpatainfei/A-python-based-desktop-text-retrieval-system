   <HEADLINE> U.N. TO INVESTIGATE KILLINGS IN RWANDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Security_Council on Friday ordered an investigation of &quot; acts of genocide &quot; in Rwanda after U.N. human_rights envoy Rene Degni-Segui called the tribal massacres there the largest in modern African history and said they were &quot; planned and systematic. &quot; In unanimously adopting a resolution to set_up an investigating commission , the council laid_to_rest a diplomatic dispute about whether to evoke the 1950 Geneva_Convention on genocide to label the bloodletting in Rwanda . Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed since April 6 , mostly members of the minority Tutsi tribe slaughtered by government-trained Hutu militias . The commission will be formed by U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and will issue its first findings in October . These could serve as evidence for prosecution of war_criminals by an international tribunal . But no such court exists , and no steps were taken Friday to establish one , so any punishment of the killers and their leaders remains far off . The United States , along with other council_members , was at first reluctant to label the Rwandan massacres &quot; genocide , &quot; concerned that it might create binding legal obligations for the United Nations . But Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said Thursday that the violence was clearly genocide and that an international tribunal should be considered .</TEXT>
