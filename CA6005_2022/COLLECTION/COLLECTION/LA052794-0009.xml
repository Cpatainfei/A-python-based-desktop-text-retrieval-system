   <HEADLINE> DECISION ON CHINA : SAD , AND CORRECT ; CLINTON UNHOOKS TRADE STATUS FROM RIGHTS ISSUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton acted appropriately Thursday in decoupling human_rights from trade_policy in renewing most-favored-nation trading status for China . &quot; We have reached the end of the usefulness of that policy , &quot; he said , and we must sadly agree . It was a difficult political decision , but one thoughtfully made in recognition of the need to build a productive , long-term , strategic relationship with China . A China engaged and open is far more desirable than a communist giant in isolation . That is not to suggest that China has made vast improvements in human_rights . It has not . Nor should the United States abandon the issue . The President was unequivocally clear on two points : that the United States will continue to champion human_rights and that abuses continue in China . But the attempt to leverage trade for improvements in human_rights has fallen_short . The question now is what is the best way to pursue human_rights in China ? The issue is real , but it should not be the defining element in political , economic and security discussions with Beijing . Clinton now believes that advances in human_rights are far more likely under improved relations and when they are not beneath the cloud of the annual MFN review . MFN is accorded the vast majority of U.S. trading partners without annual reviews . The status allows them to sell goods in the United States at the lowest possible tariffs . China ' s MFN status was not subject_to annual wrangling until after June , 1989 , when Chinese tanks rolled into Tian An Men Square in a bloody confrontation with pro-democracy demonstrators . Congress wanted China ' s MFN renewal linked to human_rights , but it was unable to prevail over President George_Bush ' s preference for unfettered MFN . During the 1992 presidential campaign Bill_Clinton accused Bush of &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in China . Last year President Clinton renewed MFN for China with an executive order that required China to meet seven conditions , related to human_rights , prison labor and emigration issues . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher certified that China had made improvements in two , but not the other five . That is probably because changing dynamics within China over the last year have slowed improvements . Tensions between the central government and the provinces have widened with modernization ; further stress is resulting because , in light of the ages of senior officials , changes in leadership are expected soon . With China in flux , Congress should support President Clinton ' s balanced decision on MFN , thereby presenting a united U.S. front to Beijing .</TEXT>
