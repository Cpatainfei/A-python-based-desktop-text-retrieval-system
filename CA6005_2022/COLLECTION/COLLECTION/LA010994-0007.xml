   <HEADLINE> HISTORY AND THE PLO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kim Murphy , undoubtedly unintentionally , has followed the long-held propaganda line of the PLO ( &quot; The Divided House of Arafat , &quot; Dec . 5 ) . For years the PLO has couched its actions in military language : Its attacks were &quot; military operations , &quot; and the casualties were &quot; soldiers. &quot; But euphemistic language cannot negate the facts . The &quot; soldiers &quot; were terrorists , and the &quot; military operations &quot; were terrorist attacks . The scores of slain civilians -- worshiping in synagogues , shopping at marketplaces , riding_on buses or dining in restaurants when they were attacked -- were innocent men , women and children . Past bitterness can prevent future progress , and we must move_on from here . But history cannot be ignored , nor should it be rewritten . CHERYL CUTLER AZAIR , DIRECTOR ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE Los Angeles Murphy eloquently explains the message President John F . Kennedy intended to deliver at the Dallas Trade Mart : &quot; There will always be dissident voices heard in the land , expressing opposition without alternatives , finding_fault but never favor , perceiving gloom on every side and seeking influence without responsibility. &quot; CLARENCE B .
