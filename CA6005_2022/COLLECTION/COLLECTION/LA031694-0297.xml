   <HEADLINE> CANCER STUDY CALLED VALID DESPITE FRAUD ; MEDICINE : FINDINGS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LUMPECTOMIES RATHER THAN MASTECTOMIES ARE UPHELD EVEN THOUGH ONE RESEARCHER FALSIFIED DATA , OFFICIALS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal_officials and cancer experts worked quickly to reassure American women that despite reports of fraud by one researcher in a major breast_cancer study , the findings -- that lumpectomy is often just as effective as complete mastectomy in early cancer cases -- are still valid . Many officials also expressed astonishment that the fraud , revealed nine months ago , has now triggered a public controversy . &quot; The case is a year old and closed_out for some time , &quot; said Lyle Bivens , head of the Office of Research Integrity at the Department of Health and Human Services , which released its report on the incident in June , 1993 . An article on the report in Sunday ' s editions of the Chicago Tribune cast doubt on the credibility of the study findings , published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1989 . But officials of the National Cancer Institute said Monday that when the researcher ' s data is removed from the overall study the conclusions are the same : Lumpectomy is as effective as more disfiguring radical_mastectomy . &quot; Breast conservation can be used with confidence , &quot; said Joann Schellenbach , a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society . The landmark National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project , headed by Pittsburgh surgeon Bernard Fisher , involved 5 # 000 patients at nearly 500 medical_centers . One researcher , Roger Poisson of St . Luc ' s Hospital in Montreal , has admitted to falsifying records concerning more_than 100 patients to make them eligible for inclusion in the study . Poisson has been barred from receiving any U.S. research grants for eight years . Poisson ' s work accounted_for about 16 % of the patients in the study . &quot; We put him out of business real quick , &quot; said Don McLaren , deputy associate commissioner for public affairs for the Food and Drug Administration , which regulates the experimental drug tamoxifen , which was used in some of Poisson ' s studies . In an agreement signed May 15 , 1991 , Poisson admitted that he had violated FDA regulations governing the use of investigational drugs . Bivens said that when his report was released , his staff recommended that the researchers notify scientific journals of the fraud . Fraud investigators expected to see a quick correction from the Pittsburgh researchers . To date , none has been published or received by medical journals . &quot; ( We ) were surprised to find that nothing had happened in a year , &quot; said Dorothy McFarland , who headed the Poisson investigation for the Office of Research Integrity . The Pittsburgh researchers said that preparing a new paper based on a thorough reanalysis of their data has taken a great_deal of time but that they are about to approach journals .</TEXT>
