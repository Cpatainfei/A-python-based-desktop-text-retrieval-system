   <HEADLINE> POPE TO FIGHT RESOLUTION TO ALLOW GAYS TO MARRY ; VATICAN : PONTIFF SPEAKS OUT AGAINST EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ' S NON-BINDING MEASURE , WHICH WOULD ALSO GIVE HOMOSEXUALS THE RIGHT TO ADOPT CHILDREN . ' WE can ' t LET THIS PASS , ' HE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pope John Paul said Thursday that the Roman_Catholic_Church would fight a European Parliament resolution proposing that homosexual couples be allowed to marry and adopt children . &quot; We can ' t let this pass , &quot; the Pope said . The Pope departed from a prepared address to bishops attending a Vatican seminar on the problems of the family to make a clear reference_to Tuesday ' s controversial resolution . Reading the prepared part of his text , the Pope said society could not achieve authentic progress without safeguarding the unity of the family . &quot; More and more public authorities who are alert and far-sighted are becoming aware of this elementary civil and political truth , &quot; the Pope said , reading his text . He then added in unscripted remarks : &quot; Not all_of them ( public authorities ) , however , as we have seen . We have seen and we must react . We can ' t let this pass. &quot; It was not clear what the church would do to fight Tuesday ' s resolution , which was drawn_up by German Green deputy Claudia Roth and approved at the parliament in Strasbourg by 159 votes to 96 . Two years ago , the Vatican issued a document to contest moves to give homosexuals equal rights , particularly in the United States . That document said homosexuals could legitimately be discriminated against in employment , housing and the adoption of children . The latest resolution , which is not binding on the 12 European Union states , also calls_for an end to the prosecution of homosexuality as a public nuisance or gross indecency , and to discrimination in criminal , civil , contract and commercial_law . The Pope spoke a day after the Vatican newspaper condemned the resolution in an editorial that said &quot; no man can take the place of a natural mother. &quot; The newspaper said children adopted by homosexuals would bear the scars of suffering and frustration .</TEXT>
