   <HEADLINE> SWEEP TARGETS SANTA ANA GANG ; CRIME : WITH INDICTMENTS FROM SECRET GRAND_JURY , TASK_FORCE BEGINS ARRESTING 130 ON CHARGES OF DEALING DRUGS IN A NEIGHBORHOOD POLICE SAY HAS BEEN TERRORIZED BY VIOLENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Armed with sealed indictments from a secretly impaneled Orange County Grand_Jury , a special task_force of law_enforcement officers swooped down Wednesday on a Santa Ana neighborhood gripped by rampant crime and hard-core gang activity to begin arresting 130 people accused of dealing drugs . The arrests capped a five-month undercover investigation by various local and federal agencies , which persuaded the grand_jury to indict 130 suspected gang members and associates -- the youngest a 12-year-old boy -- on a host of criminal charges , many involving the sale of illegal drugs near five of the city ' s public_schools . Santa Ana Police_Chief Paul M . Walters , whose officers headed the operation , said the crackdown ends a reign of neighborhood terror by the 6th Street gang . &quot; We ' re taking a truly violent organization out_of_commission , &quot; said Walters , who was flanked at a press_conference by Gov . Pete Wilson , who was campaigning in the area , and Orange County Dist . Atty . Michael R . Capizzi , as well as the local head of the FBI . &quot; Numerous members of this gang are responsible_for violent felonies , and many have been arrested . But few are convicted due_to the gang ' s intimidation of witnesses , &quot; the chief said . The massive &quot; Operation Roundup , &quot; involving officers from eight different agencies , allowed authorities to jail most of the gang ' s members in one fell swoop . Walters said routine narcotics operations arrest only a_few suspects at a time , allowing others to simply take their places selling drugs on the streets . Charlie Parsons , special_agent in_charge of the FBI ' s Los Angeles office , which took_part in the operation , said the investigation ' s successful outcome was largely attributable to a handful of undercover_agents who gained the confidence of neighborhood drug dealers and made videotaped purchases of cocaine and heroin . About 28 of the people arrested Wednesday belong_to the 6th Street gang , which boasts about 45 hard-core members , officials said . The remaining defendants are gang associates , they said . Capizzi said the arrests of two-thirds of its membership effectively gutted the gang , which claimed the 1000 and 1100 blocks of West 3rd Street as the core of its turf . &quot; The 6th Street gang has been busted in every sense of the word , &quot; Capizzi said . The arrests began at daylight Wednesday and were expected to continue until all 130 defendants were in custody . The defendants are to be arraigned later this week in Orange County Superior_Court and are being held_in lieu of bail ranging from $ 25 # 000 to $ 250 # 000 . More_than 260 law_enforcement agents took_part in the roundup , including officers from the Santa Ana Police_Department , Orange County Sheriff ' s and Probation departments , the FBI and other agencies . The adult suspects were indicted on felony charges of possessing heroin , crack cocaine or powdered cocaine for_sale , and face_up to five years in prison if convicted . Five of the defendants , who have two or more prior convictions involving serious or violent felonies , will face 25 years to life in prison under the state ' s new &quot; three strikes &quot; law if convicted of the charges against them . The indictments of 15 others trigger second-strike allegations that could add as much as 10 years to their prison sentences , and at least 25 others face prison_terms enhanced by as much as five additional years for dealing drugs near the following schools : Pio Pico Elementary , Lowell Elementary , Kennedy Elementary , Willard Intermediate and Santa Ana High . And 29 more face tougher sentences if convicted of selling the drugs to further criminal conduct of the gang . Perhaps the most surprising disclosure was the indictment of a youngster named Tony , who was observed by narcotics agents selling cocaine both day and night . Law_enforcement veterans said they were not surprised at his involvement in the drug trade , but were nonetheless touched and saddened . Among a handful of juveniles arrested , Tony was the youngest . Tony should have spent today back in class after summer vacation , starting seventh grade at Willard Intermediate School . Instead he is in Juvenile Hall , said his 17-year-old sister . &quot; From the way he looked , it was clear he was only 12 years old , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Joseph P . Smith . &quot; Since he was so young , we wanted to pick him up just to help him . I know that sounds corny , but I think that of all_the people we picked_up , maybe there is some hope for redemption here. &quot; While undercover narcotics agents were documenting the activities of the 12-year-old , Smith said , officers feared for the child ' s safety since he was selling directly to &quot; dangerous addicts. &quot; &quot; He reacted like any 12-year-old kid would , &quot; Smith said . &quot; He told us everything . He possessed a certain amount of street smarts , but he was clearly just a 12-year-old boy. &quot; In some cases , Smith said , cocaine , heroin and crack were more accessible to local residents than groceries or disposable diapers . &quot; In this neighborhood , you would find the stores closing sometime after dark , but the drugs were always available , &quot; the prosecutor said . &quot; Basically , what we ' re talking_about here is a 24-hour-per-day operation , &quot; Smith said . &quot; I don ' t think we ever went_into that neighborhood when drugs were not available . It was an entrenched marketplace for drug sales. &quot; Walters said the investigation started five months ago , after officers began monitoring street_drug sales from atop a parking garage attached_to the Hutton Towers building at Flower and Santa Ana Boulevard . In contrast to the youthful Tony , one of those arrested Wednesday had a rap sheet listing arrests dating_back to the late 1970s , including several arrests and convictions for assault and burglary -- even crimes committed while in prison . Pointing to an enlarged version of the man ' s rap sheet , Gov . Wilson said , &quot; This is a tragedy waiting to happen. &quot; The governor added that the arrested man should have been sentenced to life in prison many years ago but was not because of &quot; idiotic rules. &quot; Wilson had been campaigning in the Southland and said he was invited to attend the press_conference , which gave him the opportunity to do some boasting about laws enacted during his term to punish repeat criminals . He said defendants arrested on drug charges today are treated much more harshly than just a_few years ago , and noted that earlier this year he signed into law the &quot; three strikes &quot; legislation that mandates life sentences for individuals with two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies upon conviction of any third felony . &quot; It ' s proof California is changing &quot; for the better , Wilson said . &quot; Hopefully , we will remove them from the street for as long as we possibly can , &quot; he said of the defendants arrested Wednesday . While many hailed the success of the operation as a multi-agency effort to fight troubling gang activity and crime in Orange County , others questioned whether precious resources were spent on seeking routine charges . Police officials said the most serious charges involve terrorist activity by the gang members , as well as drug possession and sales . No special prosecutor has been assigned to handle the cases , sources said . &quot; When was the last time Pete Wilson was worried about gangs in Santa Ana ? &quot; asked one Orange County official . Wilson ' s appearance at the press_conference also rankled staffers of Democratic gubernatorial challenger Kathleen Brown . Brown campaign staff_member Mike Rice said , &quot; Pete Wilson should check his budget before he goes and blows his own horn , &quot; adding that the governor has cut $ 396 # 000 from the state ' s Gang Violence Suppression Program since taking_office in 1990 . The budget_for the program this year is about $ 5.1 million . Capizzi said the operation actually saved more_than $ 200 # 000 because the indictment process precludes the need for lengthy preliminary hearings in court . Parsons said he expects the operation to be duplicated elsewhere and that in fact it saved millions , considering other crimes the defendants would be committing if they remained on the streets . But Deputy Dist . Atty . Carl Armbrust said the roundup was about making streets safe for Santa Ana residents . &quot; The intention is to cripple , severely cripple or annihilate this particular gang claiming this turf in Santa Ana and terrorizing neighborhoods , &quot; Armbrust said . &quot; People are afraid for their lives , being held captive in their homes. &quot; * ' ALWAYS AFRAID ' : Neighborhood residents hope to live_in peace .
