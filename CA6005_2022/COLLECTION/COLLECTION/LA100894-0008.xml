   <HEADLINE> JOBLESS RATE DROPS TO 5.9 % , A 4-YEAR LOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s economy enjoyed a healthy expansion of 239 # 000 jobs last month , cutting the unemployment_rate to 5.9 % , the lowest level in four years , the Labor_Department reported Friday . Apparently because job gains fell slightly below expectation , the financial markets , always fearful of inflationary pressures , remained calm . The Dow Jones industrial average of blue_chip stocks gained 21.87 points to close at 3 # 797.43 in moderate trading . Interest_rates eased . The key 30-year Treasury_bond yield fell to 7.91 % , down from 7.96 % , a 28-month high on Thursday . President Clinton was jubilant as the unemployment_rate fell from its 6.1 % level in August . &quot; We ' re getting our economic house in_order , &quot; he said during a White_House news_conference . &quot; Jobs are being created at home. &quot; But the national business expansion is still running far ahead of California , which is moving much more slowly out of the_doldrums of recession . The state ' s jobless rate dropped to 8.3 % last month , down from 8.9 % . However , California ' s total employment still lags about 300 # 000 below its peak in June , 1990 . The nation by contrast , has added 5 million jobs since then . Los Angeles County ' s unemployment_rate improved to 8.3 % in September , a sharp gain from 10.3 % in the previous month . However , experts noted that the individual monthly figures are highly volatile , based on a small survey sample and without adjustment for seasonal changes , such_as the return of summer workers to schools and colleges . &quot; I think people are looking_for signs that the worst is over but it may_not be that time in Los Angeles , &quot; said Vincent Canales , labor_market analyst for the state ' s Employment Development Department . Friday ' s jobs report marked another step_in the delicate dance of expectations involving the business_community and the financial markets . Corporations are enjoying increased orders with stable wages and generally want to avoid any actions that would make_it more costly for them to borrow money . But investors in the bond market still have deep-seated fears of inflation eroding the value of their bonds . They worry constantly that falling unemployment could signal labor_market shortages leading to higher wages and then to higher prices . &quot; We really haven ' t had much true inflation but the bond market has become overly nervous , &quot; said Larry Kimbell , director of the UCLA business project . &quot; Fears have been exaggerated , and markets are kind of hypersensitive. &quot; Many experts had expected employment gains of 260 # 000 or 270 # 000 in Friday ' s national report . When the figure came_in at 239 # 000 , the markets were temporarily reassured . But there are still widespread expectations that the Federal_Reserve_Board could raise rates at its Open Market Committee_meeting next month . The reports on wholesale and consumer prices scheduled for next week could precipitate Fed action if those statistics show a blip in inflation , said Martin Regalia , chief economist for the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; The Fed wants to raise rates -- that is clear , &quot; he said . &quot; They are perched on the cusp of the next increase , &quot; he said . Last month ' s jobless rate was the lowest since October , 1990 , when the jobless figure was 5.8 % . However , the government revised its survey this year and the numbers may_not be precisely comparable . But there is little doubt that a solid economic expansion is under way , although growth is somewhat slower than during the first_half of the year . Much of the growth is coming_in services , with major expansions in retail trade . Manufacturing is growing more slowly , because companies prefer to pay overtime and keep their work_force stable , rather than hire new employees . The workweek averaged 42 hours last month , with 4.6 hours of overtime , some of the highest levels since World_War_II . There were 123.6 million Americans working last month . Unemployment totaled 7.7 million . In Sacramento , Gov . Pete Wilson said : &quot; Although the unemployment_rate is a volatile statistic , this demonstrates a continuing sign_on an improving economy. &quot; There were 14.2 million persons working in the state last month , a gain of 149 # 000 over August , according to the government ' s household survey . A separate government survey of business payrolls , considered more accurate , showed a net gain of 4 # 000 jobs . The number of unemployed Californians fell to 1.3 million , a healthy drop of 77 # 000 . &quot; We have started to make our recovery , &quot; said John O . Wilson , chief economist of the Bank of America . After averaging job losses of 167 # 000 a year between 1990 and 1993 , California should have a net job gain of 100 # 000 for this year and 150 # 000 next year , the BofA economist said . Although aerospace and defense spending cutbacks have ravaged Los Angeles County , the decline in high-tech employment is slowing . A September drop of 300 in high-tech jobs was the smallest monthly decline this year , the Employment Development Department said . &quot; The outlook is still poor &quot; in Los Angeles for the high-tech industries , said Canales of the EDD , warning against any premature optimism . The drop from 10.3 % to 8.3 % appears to be a statistical &quot; anomaly , &quot; he said . There were 4 million persons working in the county , a gain of 62 # 000 . Unemployment dropped to 368 # 000 , down 98 # 000 from August . But Wilson ' s office said that the Los Angeles economy could indeed be strengthening because revenues from sales taxes and payroll taxes are showing a strong gain . In addition to the 7.7 million Americans looking_for work but unable to find it during September , there were another 4.3 million part-time workers who wanted full-time jobs .
