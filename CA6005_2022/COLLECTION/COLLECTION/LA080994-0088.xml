   <HEADLINE> JACKSON-PRESLEY ORDER IS SWEET FOR CANDY MAKER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The man on the phone was mysterious , identifying himself only as a friend of Michael Jackson ' s family . But what he wanted from Frank Sheftel , a San Fernando Valley candy maker , was absolutely clear : 1 # 000 chocolate_bars about the size of a business_card , with raised letters that say , &quot; Lisa Marie and Michael. &quot; A heart and a musical_note were also to appear somewhere on the bars . &quot; At first , I ' m thinking nothing , &quot; said Sheftel , 33 , a fast-talking chocolate lover who has owned the Candy Factory in Sherman Village since 1990 . &quot; Then I ' m thinking , ' Lisa Marie and Michael . . . . ' And then he ' s telling me where he wants them delivered and I ' m thinking , ' Oh wow . Big wow. ' &quot; The Jackson family friend ordered the sweets last Monday , when Lisa Marie Presley confirmed the previously doubted rumors of her marriage to the pop superstar . In a polite and straightforward manner , the unidentified man told Sheftel to deliver the chocolates to four places : the Jackson family estate in Encino , Michael Jackson ' s production company in Westwood , Graceland -- the Elvis Presley mansion -- in Memphis , Tenn. , and the Trump Tower in New York , where the couple were honeymooning . The reaction of co-workers at the candy_store was initially one of disbelief . &quot; With them making_it public , then obviously it ' s true , &quot; said Sheftel ' s mother , Gloria , who helped prepare the chocolates . Within hours after the order was placed , a courier arrived_at the Candy Factory carrying a sealed envelope with $ 100 bills in it , Frank Sheftel said . The candy maker declined to reveal how much the order cost , but said such work typically runs as high as $ 3 # 000 . It took a team of five people to prepare the 1 # 000 bars , pouring melted Nestle ' s chocolate into plastic molds they made from a master mold prepared by an outside firm , and wrapping them in gold_foil . Half of the bars were delivered last week , while the other half will be shipped today by express_mail . This brush with fame is nothing unusual for Sheftel . In March , the candy maker created 300 10-inch-tall chocolates shaped like the Oscar statuette for a party hosted by studio executive Mark Canton . The Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences sued Sheftel , saying it was trying to protect Oscar ' s image . The two sides recently settled out of court , with Sheftel paying the academy $ 1 # 500 and turning_over many of the Oscar-shaped candy he used . Last year , the entertainment_industry turned_to Sheftel for the movie &quot; Forrest Gump. &quot; In it , Tom Hanks ' character eats a box of chocolates while sitting on a bus bench and telling his life_story to strangers . Sheftel says he made the chocolates Hanks eats_in the film because Hanks is partial to certain types of chocolates , including a special variety with centers of Rice Krispies and marshmallow . &quot; I thought it was very weird , &quot; said Sheftel -- who himself eats two chocolate_bars a day and sells chocolate-coated potato_chips . &quot; I thought , ' Why can ' t they go_to a store and buy assorted chocolates ? ' They said , ' No , no , no . It ' s got_to be something Tom Hanks would like to eat. ' All I knew was it was a movie called ' Forrest Gump. ' I thought it was about a park ranger. &quot; * For the Jackson-Presley order , the Sherman Oaks native turned_to the tabloid media to cash_in_on the celebrity sweets . The National Enquirer was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the story , Sheftel said , but it wanted exclusive_rights for three weeks . So he went_to the television_program &quot; Hard Copy , &quot; which broadcast his story Friday , demanding only that he not talk to other TV_reporters . He says he was paid &quot; thousands of dollars &quot; by the program -- he will not say how much -- but the show ' s producers will not confirm that . Sheftel makes no apologies for his decision to go public . &quot; It ' s a fun story , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not like I ' m showing a picture of them on their honeymoon . &quot; This is a sweet story , no pun intended , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
