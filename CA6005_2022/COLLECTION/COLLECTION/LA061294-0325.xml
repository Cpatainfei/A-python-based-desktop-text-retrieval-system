   <TEXT> When Dutch explorers landed on Easter Island in 1722 , there was not a single tree . Most ecologists assumed that the isolated Pacific island , now known as Rapa Nui , had always been barren . Recent studies , however , reveal that it once was covered with lush forests that were slashed and burned when humans moved there about AD 500 . The rape of Rapa Nui , archeologists are now discovering , is not unique . Whereas environmentalists and historians once believed that early humans lived_in harmony with their environment , growing evidence reveals that people have plundered the Earth wherever and whenever they have lived . From the first civilizations along the Tigris and Euphrates_rivers -- in what is now Iraq -- to the Mayan empire of Central_America , experts are beginning to agree , people have pillaged natural_resources , denuded forests and sterilized fields with unwanted salt . Environmental devastation , it would seem , has been an almost inevitable companion of civilization . And today , as society faces environmental problems ranging from deforestation and loss of biodiversity to salinization of farmland , many archeologists believe society can profit by studying where these civilizations went_wrong . &quot; We can look_to the past to see the future , &quot; said Charles L . Redman of Arizona State University . This new environmental awakening is bringing archeologists such_as Redman down from their ivory_towers , where they have chronicled early humans , and thrusting them into the hurly-burly of activism and ecological prophecy . &quot; The hallmark focus of this generation is a redefining of archeology &quot; from a rather abstract pursuit to one that has direct impact on day-to-day concerns , Redman said . &quot; We have to make the point that archeology is more_than just an indulgence of a rich society , &quot; said Don S . Rice of Southern Illinois University . &quot; We really do have something to say to future generations. &quot; One impetus for the new approach is the deforestation of Central and South_America and the accompanying loss of biodiversity -- a broad and complex abundance of species in such wilderness areas . Ecologists argue that biodiversity must be maintained because it provides a potential source of drugs , foods and other products that will be invaluable to future generations . In planning biological preserves , Rice argues , archeological data is crucial to demonstrating how many people regions could support in the past and what the outcomes were . &quot; It ' s hard to do this with short-term data , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a little easier with a millennium of data from archeology. &quot; Another important issue facing the United States and other nations is the degradation of soil quality , which ultimately threatens a society ' s ability to feed itself . Many earlier societies collapsed simply because of erosion . Emerging recognition of the unintentional destructiveness of past civilizations is blasting apart &quot; the escapist idea of the primordial paradise , &quot; that pre-industrial societies were composed of great environmentalists who lived_in harmony with their surroundings , Redman said . One key to destroying these myths is the relatively new science of paleolimnology , the study of lake sediment . As silt from rivers and streams collects in lake_bottoms , it carries pollen , ashes , eroded soil and other characteristic markers that provide a time-ordered history of a region . By studying pollen in sediment dating_from a particular period , for example , researchers can tell what types of vegetation grew naturally and what was raised by farmers . The disappearance of tree pollen is a strong indicator of deforestation . Another is the supplanting of wood ash by ash from animal dung , which is commonly burned when wood is unavailable . Large quantities of ash from the burning of buildings is a marker for warfare or environmental catastrophe , such_as volcanic_eruptions . These kinds of studies &quot; have revolutionized our understanding of the past , &quot; said Patrick V . Kirch of UC Berkeley . Kirch and colleague David W . Steadman have developed a 3 # 500-year chronology from a crater lake on Rapa Nui , which is about 1 # 400 miles from the nearest land and is famous for its large stone heads . Before Polynesians settled there , the pollen record shows , Rapa Nui had &quot; radically different vegetation , &quot; including lush forests and broad savannas , Kirch said . Within 700 years , he said , the population of the minuscule island had grown to 10 # 000 and the landscape was &quot; virtually treeless. &quot; Traditional archeological techniques , including fossil excavation , showed that many animals had been killed_off as &quot; a direct result of human_actions , &quot; he said . Among 30 species of sea_birds , they found , only eight survived , while none of six types of land birds survived . Artifacts excavated from dwellings show that as resources dwindled , the islanders fell_into brutal warfare fighting for what little was left , until eventually there was little of anything for anybody . In sediments , thick deposits of ash from burned buildings and fields also suggest widespread warfare . Kirch found the same pattern on islands throughout Polynesia . &quot; We need to ( free ) ourselves of the old assumptions that early societies had little impact on their environment , &quot; he said . &quot; And the most critical message is the inevitable effects of population increase. &quot; A world away , in the gray North Atlantic , the Norse colonized their offshore islands around AD 800 in a pattern that Thomas Amorosi of the City_University of New York calls &quot; rape , ruin and starve. &quot; They overpopulated the islands , overgrazed the fields and introduced agricultural practices that promoted soil_erosion . Recent silt studies have shown that food production was down , erosion had reached disastrous levels and the Norse were barely clinging_to the islands when the Little Ice_Age struck in the 1370s ; it proved to be their death_knell . Norse populations of Greenland and Vinland died_out by 1500 and Iceland ' s fell dramatically . Only the indigenous Inuit tribes , who adapted their lifestyles to hunting and fishing in the colder climate , persisted . The destruction of earlier civilizations as a result of poor farming practices provides a strong argument for changes in current soil-management policies , Amorosi said . Erosion is a growing problem in the U.S. Midwest , Redman noted , with large quantities of fertile soil being washed downstream to the Mississippi Delta . One of the chief lessons to be learned from early societies , Redman noted , is that farmland deteriorated when agriculture was centrally controlled by the government -- as is the case today in Russia , China and some developing countries -- rather than by local farmers who knew how to maintain soil quality . Soil salinization caused by extensive irrigation also played a major role in the downfall of several societies , beginning with one of the earliest , Mesopotamia in the Middle_East . Salinization is caused by the accumulation of mineral salts when irrigation water evaporates . As the concentration of the toxic salts increases , farming becomes more difficult . By 2000 BC , the Ur III dynasty was flourishing in the southern half of Mesopotamia , which comprised cities with tens of thousands of inhabitants . The society invented laws , developed writing and nourished itself with wheat and other winter-cultivated cereals , and sheepherding . As the soil became more saline , recent sediment studies have shown , agriculture shifted from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley ; by 1700 BC , &quot; there was no more barley , &quot; Redman said . The society became dependent_on imported grains before collapsing under the burden of overpopulation . One of the last written records from Ur , Redman said , is a plaintive message from the king to one of his functionaries in the hinterlands : &quot; Where is my shipment of grain ? &quot; &quot; These were a gifted , intelligent people , the pinnacle of the past , &quot; Redman said . &quot; If they couldn ' t handle their interactions with their environment , that is a serious condemnation of human organization. &quot; Even today , the Mesopotamian lands lie fallow , choked by plant-killing salt . Salinization and deforestation -- as well as over-hunting -- were villains in the U.S. Southwest as well . When people first arrived in North_America around 12 # 000 BC , the Southwest was like the Serengeti plain of Africa , said Redman , teeming with a bewildering variety of large animals -- the so-called mega-fauna , which included saber-toothed_tigers , woolly_mammoths and monstrous bears three times the size of those today . But by 10 # 000 BC , as scientists discovered long ago , the bulk of those animals were extinct , leaving_behind only buffalo , elk and other modern species . Salinization spelled the doom of the Hohokam , who lived_in central Arizona , in the area centered_on present-day Phoenix , from the time of Christ until about 1400 . Conventional studies have recently shown that the Hohokam constructed elaborate irrigation canal systems , according to Glen Rice of Arizona State University . Their civilization collapsed , like that in Mesopotamia , when the soil became too salty to support agriculture -- a condition that persists today . &quot; This sounds painfully like what is going_on today in California and many other farming regions around the world , &quot; Don Rice said . Salinization can be countered by reducing irrigation and by growing crops that require less water . Such changes are not being made , he said , because short-term profits still outweigh long-term environmental consequences . North of Phoenix , the Chaco Canyon area was magnificently forested in the pre-industrial era . The Anasazi built five-story buildings with 40-foot rooms spanned by timbers from huge trees . &quot; But there is not a tall tree in the area today , &quot; Redman said . As population and wealth grew , so did demands on the local forest for firewood and building_materials , he said . And as the trees and their extensive root systems disappeared , the thin soil eroded quickly , sediment studies show . &quot; This was a really complex society that is simply gone , &quot; he said . &quot; This is not a matter of a great drought or some_other external force . The society fell of its own internal weight from systematic deforestation. &quot; Perhaps the greatest romance has surrounded the Central_American societies of the Aztecs , Teotihuacan and Maya -- complex societies that created their own written language , built massive temples and architecturally sophisticated cities , perfected intensive agriculture and developed astronomy . They flourished for more_than a millennium until , one by one , they mysteriously collapsed , with the Maya being the last to fall , around AD 900 . A team headed by Sarah L . O ' Hara of the University of Sheffield in England studied more_than 4 # 000 years of sediment cores from Lake Patzcuaro , west of Mexico_City , and found three distinct periods of erosion . A minor episode occurred 3 # 900 to 3 # 250 years ago , when the site was first occupied . More serious erosion occurred from about 2600 to 1350 years ago , when classical civilizations thrived in the region . But by far the most destructive era was from about 1200 to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th Century , a period when the region was occupied by a_people known as the Purepecha . O ' Hara ' s team reported last year that the erosion totaled as much as 85 tons of soil per acre per year , an amount she called &quot; staggeringly high. &quot; The demise of the Maya , who once dominated large regions of what are now Mexico , Guatemala and El_Salvador , has been particularly intriguing . A variety of recent evidence suggests that internal warfare played a major role in the collapse , but many researchers believe that environmental problems were at the root of that warfare . Recent studies by Don Rice have shown that the Maya had destroyed more_than 80 % of the region ' s forests by the time of their demise in the 1600s . Loss of forest , in turn , speeded erosion , slashing farming productivity and reducing the ability of individual city-states to be self-sufficient . By the time the Spanish invaded , the Maya had lost 75 % of their population . The remaining people were slaughtered by the Spanish or succumbed to disease inadvertently introduced by the invaders . Ironically , the Spanish conquest proved to be a remarkable stimulus to the environment . Freed from the burdens of overpopulation , vegetation exploded , producing rain_forests that had not existed during the time of the Maya . Only recently , Don Rice said , have researchers recognized that these forests are a new phenomenon . But the picture painted by archeologists is not entirely gloomy . &quot; The upside is that many societies , like the Maya , were around for a very long_time , &quot; Redman said . &quot; Some did strikingly well for hundreds of years . We need to learn from them . &quot; But , more important , we need to find_out why people have repeatedly adopted short-term strategies with dire long-term consequences. &quot;</TEXT>
