   <HEADLINE> CORONER ' S OFFICE A PRIME TARGET OF SIMPSON DEFENSE ; TRIAL : WORK DESCRIBED BY DEPUTY EXAMINER WHO HANDLED AUTOPSIES IS QUESTIONED . HIS BOSS CALLS HIM ' COMPETENT. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A homicide detective walked into the Los Angeles County morgue a_few years back and asked Deputy Medical_Examiner Irwin L . Golden what he was up_to . Golden , according to the officer , responded by bending over a suicide victim and wrapping the still-attached noose around his own neck . &quot; I ' m just hanging_around with my friend here , &quot; the detective quoted Golden as saying . Until now , stories about Golden ' s style and performance have generally stayed within the circle of hardened veterans who work Los Angeles homicides . But as the man who performed the autopsies on Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman , Golden -- rightly or wrongly -- now finds himself in the public spotlight focused_on the O.J. Simpson murder probe . Golden has become a target in the defense strategy of attacking virtually everyone who collected , handled or tested more_than 240 pieces of physical evidence since the June 12 murders . And for defense_attorneys seeking to undercut the government ' s case , the 15-year veteran of the county coroner ' s office presents an attractive target -- in part because of his on-the-stand demeanor . He sometimes looked tentative or confused when he testified during Simpson ' s preliminary hearing in July , several experts noted . Perhaps more serious , based on his statements on the witness_stand , the experts contend he may have mishandled the autopsies . Although that point will be debated during the trial , records and interviews show Golden made mistakes in an October , 1990 , shooting case in which he had the fatal bullet going the wrong way . A judge dismissed murder_charges against a suspect in the case after other forensic experts exposed the error , records show . In light of such difficulties , prosecutors are scrambling to find another pathologist with a national reputation to help with the case . They have been turned_down by medical_examiners in San Francisco and Miami , officials in those cities say . Simpson defense_attorney Johnnie L . Cochran Jr . said that Golden ' s competence will be a &quot; real issue &quot; in one of the most closely watched murder cases in history . &quot; You would think that a case of this high profile , they ( the coroner ' s office ) would want to have their very best people , &quot; Cochran said . &quot; And if they had their best people on this case , then the citizens of Los Angeles County should probably have some questions. &quot; Golden , 54 , declined repeated requests for interviews . But a woman at his Burbank home said the deputy medical_examiner &quot; doesn ' t think he has anything to defend. &quot; &quot; He did his job , &quot; she said . Los Angeles County ' s chief medical examiner-coroner , Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran , declined to discuss the Simpson case autopsies . He called Golden a &quot; competent &quot; medical_examiner . Defense_attorneys routinely attack how police and coroner ' s offices gather and preserve evidence , especially in murder cases that depend largely on circumstantial_evidence and scientific results -- such_as the Simpson investigation . Their goal : to create a reasonable doubt in the mind of jurors by implying that evidence has been contaminated , samples confused or the chain of custody broken . And , being human , detectives , criminalists and medical_examiners almost always make mistakes while collecting hair , blood , clothing , gunpowder and other trace specimens amid the chaos and pressure of a crime scene , say former prosecutors . &quot; Police_departments throughout the world , in the investigative process , frequently bungle , &quot; said Vincent Bugliosi , the former Los Angeles County deputy district_attorney who prosecuted the Charles Manson clan . In the Manson case , Bugliosi worked around the facts that one police_officer had ruined fingerprints on a gun by grabbing it by the handle , while another had lost hair specimens when he dropped the evidence vial and it shattered . With the case against their client resting heavily on scientific tests , Simpson ' s attorneys have tried to show similar mistakes in the case against the football great , who has pleaded not_guilty . So far , they have established in court that police used a criminalist trainee to lift some of the most crucial bloodstains at the Bundy Drive murder scene ; a crime lab employee mislabeled one blood sample ; police left Simpson ' s white Ford Bronco unattended for a period_of_time , and , according to Judge Lance A . Ito , a lead detective made &quot; reckless &quot; statements to justify a key search_warrant . Bugliosi said he doubts that any of these miscues will ruin the case . &quot; I expect stuff like this , &quot; he said . But many say the part of the investigation most vulnerable to attack is how authorities handled two of the most important pieces of evidence -- the corpses of Nicole Simpson and Goldman . The Times has reported that detectives disregarded state law and their own policy by waiting eight hours before notifying the coroner ' s office about the killings and allowing personnel from that office to inspect the bodies . In a nationally televised interview Wednesday , Police_Chief Willie L . Williams conceded that detectives should have called the morgue sooner and that the delay made the coroner ' s job &quot; more difficult. &quot; Criticism also has been aimed at Golden and his handling of the autopsies . A board-certified forensic pathologist who joined the coroner ' s office in 1980 , Golden has testified in court 700 times and performed 6 # 500 autopsies , including those on some of the Night Stalker victims and on Kitty and Jose Menendez . Former colleagues say Golden , who earns nearly $ 118 # 000 a year from the county , is a competent deputy medical_examiner who does his best in an overworked office . In 1990 , an outside review performed for the county found that the quality of forensic work done_by the office was &quot; surprisingly high &quot; despite bad morale , marginal facilities and a workload that exceeded a recommended 300 autopsies annually per physician . The workload hasn ' t improved and deputy medical_examiners continue to average 400 autopsies a year , just to keep pace with a caseload that includes 8 % of the nation ' s homicides . &quot; It is just an assembly_line -- cut the body open , make a guess and get_it going_on its way , &quot; said a former death scene investigator who asked not to be identified . &quot; I usually felt rushed when I was there , &quot; said a former deputy medical_examiner who left the office in the late 1980s . &quot; I started_out doing 600 autopsies a year , then down to 500 a year . When I left , I was down to 450 to 475 a year , but a third of those were homicides &quot; -- the most difficult to perform . The former employee said work was further complicated by &quot; crowded , antiquated and depressing &quot; conditions in which doctors compete for operating_tables , vie for the attention of assistants and deal with a backlog of bodies stored in the hallways . On a recent visit , the former pathologist noted that things had gotten_worse -- leaks in the roof , crumbling plaster and a bad odor . Defense_attorney Leslie Abramson likens the coroner ' s office to &quot; a Model T jalopy going_down the road. &quot; She said Golden &quot; knows how to drive but isn ' t given all_of the equipment. &quot; Abramson , who defended Erik Menendez in his first murder trial , which ended in a hung jury , said Golden is honest and capable , despite differences she has had with him in court . She won an acquittal in the so-called Blak and Bloo nightclub murders , in part , by calling_in an expert to dispute Golden ' s opinion that one of the murder victims could have moved after a bullet tore through his aorta , records and interviews show . She said Golden ' s real problem is how he comes_across . &quot; Dr. Golden is not smooth , slick or overly articulate , &quot; she said . His behavior outside the courtroom came_to public attention when , a_few weeks after grueling testimony in Simpson ' s preliminary hearing , he allegedly waved something that looked_like a gun in the lobby of the coroner ' s office and , according to police , said words to the effect of : &quot; This is all you need to take_out six or seven lawyers ! &quot; Police investigated , but the city attorney did not charge Golden because authorities believed he meant it as a joke and could not determine whether the object was a real gun or a prop . A coroner ' s spokesman denied that Golden ever made_fun of corpses , as in the incident described by the homicide detective , but said some employees often adopt a gallows humor to cope_with the gruesome nature of their jobs . &quot; There are times when there is a levity involved , &quot; said spokesman Scott Carrier . Carrier also said millions of television viewers may have &quot; gotten the wrong impression &quot; about Golden because his &quot; movements . . . and answers in court &quot; betrayed nervousness from being in the glare of the Simpson case spotlight . But , based on_his_own testimony , some forensic experts fault Golden for what he says he did_in the autopsy room . They believe he failed to perform some important tests or save evidence that may be crucial in the Simpson case , deficiencies that reflect on the coroner ' s office in_general . Simpson defense_attorney Robert L . Shapiro attacked Golden ' s credentials by noting that the curriculum vitae he submitted to court was three-quarters of a page , listed no academic appointments and showed he had co-authored one four-page article in the last five years . Golden said he gives &quot; intramural &quot; lectures to his colleagues . The coroner ' s office declined to release Golden ' s resume to The Times . In comparison , better-known medical_examiners such_as Werner U . Spitz of Michigan , author of a widely used text for forensic pathology , and Boyd Stephens of San Francisco have resumes listing pages of work experience , professional lectures , publications and service with professional_associations . The 11-page resume for Stephens , who turned_down a request from prosecutors to help with the Simpson case , shows that he wrote seven articles and a book chapter in the last five years and has given 51 seminars , meetings or lectures to outside groups since 1987 . During a July 7 preliminary hearing , Golden testified about the autopsies on Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman . He acknowledged that no rape test was performed on Nicole Simpson . He said it was up_to police to request the tests , but Spitz and others say rape kits are routine autopsy procedures in murders involving women . Golden also testified that he discarded Nicole Simpson ' s stomach contents , which he examined to help determine the time of death . Experts said he should have saved those contents because they are evidence and subject_to further examination . Golden testified that he saved the contents from Goldman ' s stomach . And in a particularly tense exchange with Shapiro , the deputy medical_examiner conceded that he never matched the wounds on the victims against a knife that police brought_to the morgue because they believed it was similar to the murder weapon . &quot; He asks you to check to see , and you ' re telling us that you didn ' t think it was indicated for you to perform a proper evaluation ? &quot; Shapiro asked_in the July 8 hearing . &quot; Well , I said it could be , it could be the weapon that caused some of the wounds , including the cutting wounds . It was a single edge , it had a single sharp cutting_edge , and it ' s obviously consistent with many of the slashing wounds , and I , it was a six-inch blade , and , at the time , we didn ' t think it indicate , or I didn ' t think it indicated to go_through each wound , wound by wound . . . to try to exclude that weapon . That can be done at some_other time , &quot; Golden said . &quot; You understand a man is sitting in jail , faced with charges of double homicide , do you not ? . . . When would you suggest doing that to protect his rights ? &quot; Shapiro asked . &quot; Now ? &quot; Golden replied . Cyril H . Wecht , former Allegheny County , Pa. , medical_examiner and past president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences , called the failure to perform a rape test &quot; unforgivable. &quot; Wecht -- who is controversial among medical_examiners because he often testifies for the defense -- also contended that Golden ' s failure to match the knife with the wounds on the bodies was the &quot; most serious flaw &quot; in the autopsies . &quot; The prosecution cannot go_to trial with Golden alone , &quot; Wecht said . Asked to describe the way the autopsies were performed , Wecht added : &quot; I would use words like ' inadequate , ' ' incomplete ' and ' scientifically imprecise. ' &quot; Wecht , now a private consultant living_in Connecticut , based his comments on court testimony . The Los Angeles coroner ' s office will not publicly release the autopsy reports for Simpson and Goldman . His boss has admitted that Golden committed errors in his work after another double homicide : the Oct . 3 , 1990 , killings of Ronald Gay and Linda Louis Phillips , shot to death while sitting in a car on West 81st Street . Finding the car ' s back window shattered and two spent bullets inside , homicide investigators believed that Gay and Phillips had been gunned_down from outside the car . Golden ' s autopsies supported that theory . Golden concluded that Gay had been shot from a distance . &quot; There was no evidence of close-range firing on the skin surrounding the gunshot entrance wound , &quot; Golden wrote in his November , 1990 , autopsy . He also concluded that Phillips died when a bullet entered her right arm , went_into her right side and came_out through her back , just left of the spine . He was wrong . Additional forensic tests commissioned by defense_attorney Charles L . Linder , who represented a man accused in the murders , showed that Golden had it backward . Phillips had actually been shot in the back , with the bullet coming_out through her right arm , court records show . And as for Gay ' s wound , Golden made no mention of an abrasion to the upper left of the bullet_hole , marks that Linder ' s experts said indicated a &quot; pressure contact &quot; wound like the kind caused when a firearm is pressed against the skin . In June , 1993 , Superior_Court Judge William Pounders agreed to dismiss charges against Linder ' s client , who had been convicted of an unrelated slaying and is now in prison . After the dismissal , Linder filed court papers outlining scientific evidence showing that Golden committed &quot; significant errors of a critical nature &quot; and that the victims were shot by someone sitting in the back seat , not outside the car . A district_attorney ' s spokeswoman confirmed Friday that prosecutors agreed to the dismissal &quot; in the interest of justice. &quot; The new evidence also prompted Golden to change his mind . &quot; Further review of the autopsy photographs in conjunction with the forensic report authored by ( Linder ' s expert ) leads me to conclude that the entrance wound was_on the back and the exit on the right arm , having passed from back to front through the chest , &quot; Golden wrote in an addendum to the Phillips autopsy on June 21 , 1993 . In a written response to questions recently submitted by The Times , Los Angeles coroner-medical examiner Sathyavagiswaran said : &quot; Dr. Golden did make an error when he indicated that the bullet entered through the arm and exited in the back . I agree with opinions that a deputy medical_examiner should be able to tell the difference between an entrance wound and an exit wound. &quot; He added , however , that certain conditions can make_it difficult to do so . &quot; We all make mistakes , but we deputy medical_examiners are always ready to acknowledge our errors and rectify them as indicated by the addendum Dr. Golden issued on the case , &quot; he said . Sathyavagiswaran also said that Golden made a mistake in not discovering the contact wound to Gay and that he has directed Golden to change that autopsy as well -- four years after the shooting . Just how these or any other mistakes might come_back to haunt Golden in the Simpson trial is open_to question . But defense_attorney Cochran said he will attempt to bring the deputy medical_examiner ' s past performance to the jury ' s attention . &quot; I think the triers of fact need to know that , &quot; Cochran said .</TEXT>
