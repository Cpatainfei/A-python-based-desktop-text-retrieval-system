   <HEADLINE> U.S. ENVOY SOOTHES INDIA , PAKISTAN ; DIPLOMACY : STROBE TALBOTT ASSURES BOTH NATIONS THAT CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION DESIRES IMPROVED RELATIONS . BUT RECEPTION TO ARMS CONTROL SUGGESTIONS IS MIXED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Historians record that one Pakistani prime_minister visited New York just as the National League pennant-winning Giants , with Willie Mays in center_field , blanked Cleveland in the 1954 World_Series . &quot; This proves that the Indians are overrated , &quot; Mohammed Ali quipped to his hosts in Manhattan . Like baseball , the neighboring nations of India and Pakistan have traditionally seen their troubled relations , which have led to three wars , as having one winner and one loser . What was good for Pakistan was bad for India , and vice versa . Into those set and suspicious ways walked Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott , who visited the countries this month to try to persuade them that the United States wants improved relations with both . &quot; We do not want a zero-sum game , &quot; Talbott stressed in Pakistan . &quot; When American officials come here in the future , we don ' t want people in India thinking that it ' s to the detriment of India ' s national interest , and vice versa. &quot; The reception given to U.S. suggestions for arms control in the subcontinent was mixed and inconclusive . But on Talbott ' s broader agenda -- persuading India and Pakistan that the Clinton_Administration had not forgotten about them -- the bespectacled former journalist seems to have done_well indeed . &quot; The visit cleared the atmosphere and got the countries back to substance , &quot; said Pran Chopra , research professor at the Center for Policy Research , an Indian think_tank . &quot; He ( Talbott ) said things like , ' I ' ve come_to consult , ' ' I ' ve come_to ask , ' ' An invitation has been extended , ' instead of it being presented , as it had till then , as a sort of summons. &quot; Pakistanis were pleased too . &quot; His coming was an important signal that South Asia is_on the agenda of the Clinton_Administration , &quot; said a senior Foreign Ministry official close to the talks in Islamabad . &quot; It was not just a non-proliferation trip that failed . Talbott wanted to say to us and the Indians that the zero-sum game was over in terms of relations with the U.S. He used the same words in both capitals : The zero-sum game is over . The U.S. wants equally strong and equally profitable relations with both Pakistan and India. &quot; When Indians , irritated by a series of what they believe to be provocative statements from Washington and the possibility of U.S. warplanes being delivered to Pakistan , suggested that the United States was resuming a pro-Pakistani &quot; tilt , &quot; Talbott rejected the notion . &quot; There is no American tilt toward any specific country in this region , &quot; he emphasized at a news_conference in New Delhi . &quot; I ' d suggest the very word tilt belongs_to the past , and specifically , to the vocabulary of the Cold War. &quot; Observers in India and Pakistan said Talbott ' s main success was in instilling or reviving good feelings about the Clinton_Administration ' s intentions , with any concrete achievements still in the future . The No . 2 official in the State_Department secured Prime_Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao ' s agreement in principle to visit the United States , and the Indians promised a speedy reply on the U.S. request to approve Defense Undersecretary Frank Wisner as ambassador-designate to New Delhi to fill a year-old vacancy . As for the Pakistanis , they and the Americans issued a joint statement expressing shared commitment to &quot; pursue the goal of capping , then reducing , and finally eliminating weapons of mass destruction and ballistic_missiles in South Asia. &quot; The Clinton_Administration has proposed the release of 38 F-16s in return for a verifiable freeze on Pakistan ' s nuclear program . &quot; There ' s still a large area of disagreement , but both sides desire progress , &quot; I.A. Rehman , chairman of the Pakistani Human_Rights Commission , who met with Talbott , said afterward . Indications were that U.S. diplomats in Islamabad were working hard to flesh_out the proposals carried by Talbott . &quot; What they can be sure about is that we will not accept a unilateral arrangement , &quot; one Pakistani Foreign Ministry official cautioned . How to lure the Indians into accepting the same restrictions on their nuclear activities as Pakistan may be the rock on which the U.S. proposal founders . In the past , Chopra said , India rejected a formula advanced by the United States for a five-nation disarmament conference to be attended by Pakistan , India , the United States , Russia and China . India ' s comments after Talbott ' s departure showed that the Americans have their work cut_out for them in transforming happier feelings into concrete decisions . Rao warned that allowing delivery of the nuclear-capable F-16s to Pakistan &quot; can lead to an arms race in the region , &quot; and he called any suggestion to restrict India ' s nuclear options &quot; unacceptable and unrealistic. &quot; The new U.S. proposal floated to the Indians , Chopra said , calls_for a nine-member conference : the five permanent members of the U.N. Security_Council plus Germany , Japan , India and Pakistan . One of India ' s nettlesome questions is whether under such a formula , China would have to cap its nuclear program as well . &quot; Whether India will or won ' t go_to this meeting , and it probably will , it will ask_for much more clarification , &quot; Chopra said . He believes that India may insist that three nuclear states created by the Soviet collapse -- Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus -- also take_part . &quot; Feathers have now been smoothed , &quot; he said , summing_up the results of Talbott ' s visit . &quot; But now we must see where this leads. &quot;</TEXT>
