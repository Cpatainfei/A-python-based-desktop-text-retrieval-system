   <HEADLINE> ROSEANNE ARNOLD FILES FOR DIVORCE , JOLTS TV INDUSTRY ; ENTERTAINMENT : STAR OF TOP-RATED SHOW CLAIMS ABUSE BY HUSBAND , TOM . EFFECT ON THEIR PRODUCTIONS IS UNCERTAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Roseanne Arnold filed for divorce Monday from her husband , Tom , apparently ending a professional partnership known for its intimidating show_business clout and a personal union that she says was secretly plagued by alleged physical and psychological abuse . Arnold , star of ABC ' s top-rated &quot; Roseanne &quot; series , filed divorce papers in Los Angeles Superior_Court three days after bitter arguments by the couple outside the Studio City set of &quot; Roseanne &quot; and at their Brentwood home . In court papers , she wrote : &quot; Throughout our marriage , ( Tom Arnold ) has been physically and emotionally abusive toward me . I now realize that I am a classic battered and abused wife who has tolerated the conduct . . . only because ( Arnold ) has successfully lowered my self-esteem and reduced me into the realm of battered wife syndrome. &quot; The split instantly became a hot topic on radio and television_shows nationwide Monday . It also fueled speculation in many entertainment_industry circles about whether the &quot; Roseanne &quot; series and the couple ' s several other television and motion_picture projects , under their Wapello County production company arm , would be affected . The Arnolds , who have been married four years , were executive producers of &quot; Roseanne , &quot; &quot; Tom , &quot; and last season ' s &quot; The Jackie Thomas Show , &quot; canceled by ABC . They signed a long-term development deal last year with Warner Bros . to produce several comedy series . If Roseanne Arnold presses ahead with the divorce , it would mark another twist in a tempestuous relationship that made network executives jump through hoops to please television ' s top female star . Roseanne Arnold recently had expressed unhappiness with ABC , and executives at other networks , including CBS , have been trying to woo her away . Neither Arnold could be reached for comment Monday . During the marriage , Roseanne Arnold ' s popularity gave her enough power to influence executives at ABC and CBS to pluck her husband out of relative obscurity and make him the star of two network series . One was &quot; The Jackie Thomas Show &quot; and the other is &quot; Tom &quot; on CBS , which is struggling and not expected to be renewed for next fall . Despite the fact that she was the bigger star , Roseanne Arnold had maintained that he was the key creative force that kept &quot; Roseanne &quot; on top of the ratings . She also credited him with rescuing her from her first , unhappy marriage and a tormented past . &quot; He ' s the one person who has ever kept_up with me , &quot; she was quoted as saying in a Vanity_Fair magazine profile this year . &quot; We ' ve had bad stuff , too , but he tried very hard to take_care of me . I do with him too . that ' s real nice. &quot; The couple seemed to be together constantly , and their antics were continual fodder for tabloids and entertainment news outlets . They once mooned a camera with their respective rear-end tattoos at a sports event . They were photographed mud-wrestling for Vanity_Fair . They both disclosed that they were victims of child_abuse . They gave freely to charity and would appear on each other ' s shows . David Colden , an entertainment attorney compared the split of the Arnolds to that of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz , who owned the Desilu production company . &quot; Desi , in terms of the business was far more important . But Roseanne is the heir-apparent to the comedy crown that Lucy had in the 1950s . Creatively , where the company will go will be guided by her . How the loss of her life partner will affect her mentally will have a business impact . But that ' s true of any divorce . Lucy went_on to a number of other successful series. &quot; In an affidavit filed_in support of a temporary restraining order , Roseanne Arnold described several violent incidents in which she said her husband attacked her . She maintained that her husband , throughout their marriage , &quot; hit me , struck me , has thrown objects at me , pinched me and verbally abused me . He has also pushed me against walls , while he screams and shouts at me , drowning_out any possible pleas that I might make_for him to stop. &quot; Last Friday , Roseanne Arnold wrote that she attempted to bar Tom from the &quot; Roseanne &quot; studio , but that he gained entry anyway &quot; and assaulted four people in a violent episode . He scratched and hit these individuals. &quot; Later that night , she said Tom Arnold threatened her three children at the couple ' s Brentwood home . She said he had moved_out of the house six months earlier into a Westside condo under mutual agreement . She accused him of becoming more violent in recent months : &quot; I have finally come_to the realization that I must_not subject myself to his conduct . My life would be ruined if I continue in this abusive relationship. &quot; Roseanne Arnold has alleged for several years that she was sexually , physically and emotionally abused by her parents . Those accusations were disputed by her family Sunday in a segment on CBS ' &quot; 60 Minutes , &quot; in which her family said Roseanne Arnold had fabricated the allegations . How the split between Roseanne and Tom Arnold will affect both careers will be watched closely by the industry . It was rare that the couple was separated . She had dedicated her recent autobiography , &quot; My Lives , &quot; to her spouse . &quot; To Tom , &quot; she wrote . &quot; You and I are our own garden . Unpruned , unmarked , we drink and grow , gnarled in elemental magic . . . . I float through you , My love. &quot; Despite their professed love for one another , rumors have circulated for months that he had been having an affair with Kim Silva , his assistant . The Arnolds , in fact , openly joked about the rumors and -- in a publicity stunt -- announced a three-way &quot; marriage. &quot; They even presented Silva with an eight-carat-diamond engagement_ring . Skeptics predicted Monday that the rift might be another one of the Arnolds ' headline-grabbing stunts . &quot; After all , the argument did come_on the last_day of this season ' s filming for ' Roseanne , ' &quot; said one source close to the show who asked not to be identified . Another source close to the couple said : &quot; It seems oddly calculated , the timing of it coming at the end of filming . They strike me as a couple who doesn ' t break_up until one of them gets a bullet in the head. &quot; Times staff writer Eric Malnic contributed to this story .</TEXT>
