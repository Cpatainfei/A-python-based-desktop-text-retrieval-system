   <HEADLINE> FIRE DISRUPTS L.A. PHONES , SERVICES ; COMMUNICATIONS : MILLIONS OF CALLS , INCLUDING MANY TO 911 , CANNOT GO THROUGH . PACBELL SAYS BLAZE AT SWITCHING FACILITY CAUSED LENGTHY INTERRUPTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A fire at a Downtown Los Angeles Pacific Bell switching facility crippled the city ' s phone_service early Tuesday , blocking millions of calls , knocking_out many appeals for emergency service , disrupting businesses and shutting_down automated teller machines throughout the city . With no 911 calls getting_through in areas of the San Fernando Valley , helicopters and fire_trucks patrolled neighborhoods to search for smoke or flames , and extra police_cars cruised the streets in case residents needed assistance . The 12:47 a.m. fire caused widespread inconvenience , with phone trouble reported from the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys to South Los Angeles , from West Los Angeles to Downtown . But there were no reports of injury or death caused by a delay in emergency response . Emergency phone_service was restored about 9 a.m. Tuesday , with regular phone_service back in_operation by the afternoon . The early morning fire at the Bunker_Hill office tower , started by an electrical malfunction , caused more damage to the area ' s phone_systems than the January earthquake . The switching facility , the largest west of the Mississippi , is a critical Southern California telecommunications hub . The widespread breakdown was one of the worst in the recent history of Southern California phone problems , said Bill Chubb , a regional manager for PacBell . And the problem went well beyond phones . Because phone_lines connect computers , an electronic lifeline was severed . Fax machines were idled . Stockbrokers could not call New York . Gas_station customers at many of Arco ' s PayPoint terminals were confronted with the message : &quot; Use cash. &quot; Even lottery players were out of luck . The fire made_it difficult for many to buy tickets or get their winnings . Bob Taylor , a California lottery spokesman , said that 1 # 200 of the state ' s 22 # 000 terminals were down early Tuesday morning . By midmorning , the machines were back on line . Different neighborhoods had different problems . In the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys and part of West Los Angeles , many residents could not get_through when they called 911 , and had difficulty dialing out of their area_code . And in Downtown Los Angeles , more_than 150 # 000 customers , cut_off from the outside world , could barely function without their phones and modem-equipped computers . Although the Pacific Stock_Exchange did not shut_down , stockbrokers throughout Downtown had a long morning . Tae Chor , a broker at Olde Discount Corp. , could not connect with the New York offices through phones or computers until late morning . &quot; We did half the business we ' d normally do today , &quot; Chor said . &quot; We have no business when the phones go off. &quot; Even those with working phones were inconvenienced . Wells Fargo Bank reported that 700 of its 1 # 800 automated teller machines were disabled Tuesday morning . At Bank of America , service to 1 # 500 of 2 # 100 ATMs was affected . But by late afternoon , almost all_the ATMs were back in_service , bank officials said . ATMs -- like lottery outlets -- were affected because they use phone_lines to connect to central computers . Miki Kobayashi , travel consultant at Kuroneko Yamato Travel_Agency , said the company is so computer- and phone-dependent that it no longer uses printed airline schedules . &quot; I can ' t even sign_in , &quot; she said Tuesday morning . &quot; I can ' t get_in to make reservations for our clients. &quot; Nick Teklu , who runs an Arco gas_station in San Bernardino , said the station ' s PayPoint service was out_of_order all day . The system allows customers to pay_for gas with an automated teller card . &quot; Customers were really angry , &quot; Teklu said . &quot; Some of them have no cash ; they can ' t buy anything without the card. &quot; Tuesday ' s fire was not the first at a Downtown PacBell switching facility . A 1983 fire caused the evacuation of 1 # 700 workers and interrupted long-distance service for hours . The building ' s owners were under orders to comply with a new sprinkler law approved after the First Interstate Bank fire in 1988 . Although the work was nearly complete , sprinklers had not been installed in the area where Tuesday ' s fire occurred . The company did not meet a December , 1991 , deadline to finish the work , and was granted an extension until to July , 1994 . &quot; They didn ' t do anything wrong , &quot; said city Fire Inspector Neal Reitzell . &quot; They were not in violation of any codes . They have sprinklers in most of the areas and are in the process of installing the remaining ones. &quot; Inspectors , who had visited the building in recent months , said they were pleased that the building had its sprinklers about 85 % installed and was making progress . City building officials issue extensions if building owners have hardships that make compliance difficult . Inspectors granted the extension to PacBell because all_the electronic machinery in the building had slowed installation of the sprinklers . The fire broke_out on the 13th floor of the 17-story building , one of three high-rises at Pacific Bell ' s Grand Complex . It took about 80 firefighters less than 90 minutes to extinguish the blaze . The cause of the fire was under investigation , but officials said it appears to have started as A T &amp; T subcontractors installed new equipment to power the phone_company ' s fiber-optic lines . The fire severed the main power source to the switching station . With the power gone , PacBell could not transfer traffic to another switching office as was done during the earthquake , officials said . About 50 people were evacuated from the facility and three workers were hospitalized for minor smoke inhalation , fire officials said . Tuesday ' s outage appeared to have been the largest in the United States since a 1991 New York City phone breakdown , said Pete Hoffman , a spokesman for the Washington-based Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions , which represents local and long-distance companies . The New York City breakdown was caused when human error at an American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co . switching station disrupted long-distance phone_service and cut air traffic controller links , grounding all departures and severely limiting arrivals at three major airports in the New York area . There was much confusion Tuesday morning when residents awoke and discovered they had difficulty making calls across town . At scores of Los Angeles public_schools , teachers found it impossible to call_in sick Tuesday , prompting a scramble when principals realized some classes had no teacher . Making matters worse , principals could not call Downtown offices to order substitutes . By about 9:30 a.m. Supt . Sid Thompson turned_to broadcast news stations , asking them to air an announcement directing principals to find substitute teachers on_their_own , rather than requesting help through central_offices . In many cases , teachers could not be found until 11 a.m. , prompting schools to double_up classrooms . Overall , officials determined that the early morning fire was not as serious as it could have been . &quot; This was fortunate because there is such light telephone traffic Downtown at that time , &quot; said Chubb of PacBell . &quot; If the outage had occurred at 12:47 p.m. instead , it would have been an entirely different story. &quot; Times staff writers Amy Harmon , Linus Chua , Stephanie Chavez , Marc Lacey and Chau Lam contributed to this story . Communications Breakdown A fire at a Downtown Pacific Bell crippled telephone_service early Tuesday . Here is a look_at the system and how it was shut_down . 1 . A call goes_to a local switching center . If the call is within a local area , that office sends the call_on to its destination . 2 . If the call is outside the local area , it is sent to the Bunker_Hill facility -- which handles up_to 3 million calls an hour -- or one of one of two other Pacific Bell &quot; gateway switches &quot; in Los Angeles County . 3 . After fire breaks_out , one of several power sources to the switching station shuts_down the fiber optic &quot; trunks &quot; that route incoming calls to their destination . * Where the outages occurred : Throughout the 213 , 310 and 818 area_codes . For 911 service , the San Fernando Valley and the Westside were affected most . * Who was affected : Up to 20 # 000 calls each second were blocked immediately after the fire . More_than 150 # 000 Downtown customers were unable to make calls_out of the area . Many data networks such_as automatic_teller_machines that use phone_services to link terminals to central computers were down for much of the day . By late morning , most phone_service was restored .</TEXT>
