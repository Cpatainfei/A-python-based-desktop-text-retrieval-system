   <HEADLINE> ORANGE BALLOT OFFERS QUIRKS , CONSERVATISM ; ELECTION : THE 13 CANDIDATES INCLUDE A &quot; SHAMAN &quot; AND AN EX-POLICEMAN WITH THOUGHTS OF LEGAL AND TAXABLE PROSTITUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Voters here will choose from 13 candidates who range from a &quot; shaman &quot; in his 20th try_for mayor to a former New York City police_officer who thinks government is overlooking a prime revenue source in legalized prostitution . But most of the candidates tend to reflect the city itself : a sturdy field of home-grown conservatives , punctuated by the quirky and the unusual . Campaign platforms are notably similar . Two of the three mayoral candidates and all 10 of those running_for City_Council push for more police , more business , less government and no new taxes . City residents are sharply divided into two groups -- Old Towne &quot; preservationists &quot; and &quot; property_rights &quot; advocates . Residents who live east of the Costa Mesa Freeway also present some issues , such_as concern about spill-over crime from the county-run island of El Modena . Two of the mayoral candidates -- Joanne Coontz and Fred L . Barrera -- both hold council seats and are in a tight race . Coontz , a 65-year-old former planning commissioner , has gathered a wealth of endorsements , including that of the police union . In 1986 , she became the first woman elected to the council . She describes herself as tough , a risk-taker and someone who can unify divided residents . She said the mayor should be an ambassador for Orange . Political observers credit her with being involved , knowing the issues and doing her homework . She advocates Neighborhood Watch groups , beefed-up business programs and the library as a city priority . Her leading opponent , Barrera , 72 , is a lifelong Orange resident who went_to a segregated Latino elementary_school and then went_on to own a Union Oil dealership and co-found the Orange National_Bank . He stresses the social problems of gangs , drugs and the disobedience of youth , all_of which he said can be tied to hard economic times and the need for jobs and business growth in Orange . Barrera is in his fifth term and , as mayor pro_tem , has some edge . He lost a battle to use the title on the ballot , but he has exposure as acting mayor for the often-absent Mayor Gene Beyer . The third_person in the mayoral race is Juan Pablo Serrano Nieblas , 59 , who lists himself on his voter registration as a shaman and on the ballot as an environmentalist . A shaman is a native healer-priest . Nieblas explains that he is the son of Mexican immigrant and a member of the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians . The 59-year-old son of migrant workers who practices psychic healing and He is the only candidate running_on an anti-business theme . Nieblas is known in the city as a perennial candidate and he says he has run_for the office 20 times . Rather than woo business , Nieblas said he wants to cease offering enticements to industry . He said he has turned_down money from political_action_committees and would restore the canyon lands . The former custodian would close the Redevelopment Agency and force developers to build low-cost housing . The field vying for the two open council seats is wide . Incumbent Mark Murphy has a list of powerful endorsements and is the only council candidate to win the police union ' s backing . A city native , Murphy , 37 , stresses his business sense acquired as an account manager for Hewlett-Packard Co . and takes credit for beating_down a proposed utility tax last year . His record also includes pushing for the city ' s gift ban and working to lure the Mills Corp . to Orange . His platform includes public safety , business growth and property_rights . Another homegrown candidate is Dan Slater , a 35-year-old real_estate_broker running_on the issues of police protection and business expansion . The current council is too wimpy , too easily influenced by gadflies , he has told voters . He will give the city the decisiveness it lacks , he said . He also strongly favors imposing stringent design regulations to preserve the historic Old Towne . Michael Alvarez , 38 , also works in real_estate , overseeing his family trust and business operations . He wants to establish Neighborhood Watch programs to fight crime . He has the firefighters ' union endorsement and wants to make support of the city library system a higher priority . He is president of the Downtown Owners Assn . Opposing them is Corinne Schreck , one of the city ' s most vocal property_rights advocates . The 51-year-old property manager thinks Old Towne regulations are too restrictive . She would like to create ties between Orange Unified School District and the city , beef_up the police , lure businesses and consider making the library privately run . Coming from the east_side of town is Mara Brandman , a longtime activist . She is vice_president of Orange Park Acres and the Wilderness Homeowners Assn . and is running_on an anti-crime theme . One solution to reducing crime from El Modena might be to annex the area , she said , or to force the county to increase its anti-gang efforts . Brandman , 49 , is president of the library ' s Board of Trustees . Adolfo Perez Jr. , 22 , is running_on a pro-business theme and would try to fill some of the empty warehouses in the city . He works in banking and said he would try to cut the city budget in unspecified areas and increase funds for firefighting and police . One of the newer faces is Joseph Vanderhoff , a 46-year-old retired police_officer copfrom New York City . His platform is fighting crime and he advocates building more prisons . He said he brings 30 years of public_service and a love for the city to the voters . Now a private_detective , he also works as a lay arbitrator . He wants to legalize prostitution to both regulate it and tax it . Jim Wronski , 47 , has jumped in the ring for the second time . A bicycle shop owner , Wronski advocates more and better bicycle trails and easing restrictions on bicyclists . He said he would also look_for new ways to raise money , such_as citywide bingo games . Government should be smaller , tougher on crime , and contract_out services where possible , he said . Mechanic David Johnson , 33 , also targets crime as an issue . The former Marine wants to expand the industrial base and improve police training so that police outside of the gang unit also are trained to handle that problem . He is aiming his campaign largely at senior_citizens and he points to his work for seniors at the North Orange Christian_Church . The youngest candidate is 20-year-old Gregory Reynolds . A Cypress College_student , Reynolds said his youth would enable him to communicate with gangs and assist the city ' s gang-fighting efforts . He hopes to follow the political example of his grandfather , Max Reynolds , who was mayor of Orange for two terms in the 1960s . He said he would like to see the city regain some of its small-town friendliness .</TEXT>
