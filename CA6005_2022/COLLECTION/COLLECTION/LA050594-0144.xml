   <HEADLINE> MARKETS ; A SUPERMERCADO IN SANTA ANA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Top Valu Market No . 8 , 1120 S . Bristol St. , Santa Ana , ( 714 ) 957- 2529 . Open 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily . BRRrrrsptHummmmphfftzzzit . A loud speaker crackles on and a deep voice blares in Spanish : &quot; Te informamos hoy en el produce : jicama , solamente tres libras por sesenta y ocho centavos ; frijoles de Springfield , una libra por ochenta y cinco centavos ; Charmin . . . &quot; Here at Top Valu Market No . 8 in Santa Ana , daily specials blurb over the P.A. system in Spanish and English , interrupting a near-constant stream of American oldies hits . In front of the store , kids ride the emerald-green horse or the orange-colored Dumbo elephant on a miniature carousel . Just inside the door you ' ll see a churro stand , a video rental boutique with lots of Cantinflas movies and dubbed Disney cartoons , and magazine_racks packed with Spanish-language versions of Elle and Cosmopolitan . Top Valu No . 8 is_well stocked with standard American products , but somehow it still conveys the spirit of a Mexican marketplace . Concessionaires lining the store ' s inside perimeter sell sombreros , Western boots with metal-tipped toes and sacos , those Mexican-style men ' s short suit jackets . Multihued pinatas dangle over the vegetable bins , and the meaty aroma of frying carnitas mingles with the warm smell of baking Mexican rolls wafting from the hot deli area . Most of the Mexican produce at Top Valu -- jicama , chayotes , plantains and mangos -- is getting_to be pretty familiar everywhere . But here it ' s featured in mountainous heaps . And occasionally Top Valu No . 8 will have something exceptional like a pile of gleaming orange habanero chiles or the hard-to-find fresh epazote , an herb essential to west-central and southern Mexican cooking . &quot; About 90 % of our customers are Hispanic , &quot; says the store ' s manager , Ben Hashemi , after I ask him about the imported canned Guatemalan black_beans and the Mexican Penafiel and Jarrito sodas . &quot; We get these things to make our customers feel at home. &quot; Of all Top Valu ' s nine stores , No . 8 is the most likely to make hard-core Mexican cooks feel at_home . In its Mexican-style full-service butcher department you can get carne asada or milanesa ( or for that matter any meat you want ) cut_to order ; shrink-wrapped meats are still not entirely customary in Mexico . The butchers here also make hot and mild chorizo and an intense russet-colored carne adobada , marinated in achiote and orange_juice . Over in the dairy section you can get Mexican-style cheeses in plastic-wrapped packages , supermarket-style , but here at the meat_counter , the butcher will cut cheese to your order , slicing off a slab of queso fresco , aged cotija or stringy Oaxaca straight from huge wheels of cheese . &quot; Of all our stores this one is closest to the border , so we wanted it to have that authentic feel , &quot; says John Cordero , Top Valu ' s grocery director . Ironically , the head of the Top Valu chain , Darioush Khaledi , comes from Iranian Kurdistan . &quot; When I moved here in 1976 , I was looking_for a business to buy because I needed to make a living , &quot; Khaledi says . It could have been any kind of business , a transmission shop or a gas_station . After analyzing many possibilities , a small supermarket in Torrance proved the most promising. &quot; Today the former civil_engineer and political_prisoner ( he was jailed in Tehran for his association with Amnesty International and his opposition to the Shah ' s dictatorship ) has been called an industry leader in the field of independent Latino grocers . He ' s also been called prophetic for his foresight into the untapped potential of the lucrative Latino market , a sector that has expanded exponentially over the past decade . And after 17 years , K.V. Mart Co. , which Khaledi co-owns with his brother-in-law , Parviz Vazin , includes nine supermarkets , four moderate-sized warehouse-style stores ( with more on the drawing boards ) and five shopping_centers . * When Khaledi and Vazin first acquired their store in Torrance they let their employees continue to run the business . &quot; I had no idea what I was going_to do when we first opened and they were making money , &quot; Khaledi says . At that time he was unfamiliar_with grocery industry management protocol . Terms such_as &quot; target marketing , &quot; and &quot; demographics of spending power , &quot; so popular_with marketing experts today , were foreign to him . In fact , English was pretty foreign to him , too . &quot; I could barely speak it , &quot; he admits . But Khaledi began his own brand of back-yard market research -- he simply observed the store ' s clientele . &quot; We had a lot of Spanish-speaking customers but almost none of the employees spoke Spanish , &quot; he explains . Sensing that he could build customer loyalty by catering more directly to this clientele , he began hiring bilingual cashiers and asking their advice on what merchandise to stock . K.V. Mart ' s second store in Lennox was even more precisely geared to Hispanic customers . The market maintained a full service butcher who could cut meats in the Latin_American fashion and it stocked plenty of variety_meats . Many Central_American and Mexican customers feel comfortable shopping where they know the owner or are familiar_with the employees , so Khaledi encouraged his bilingual staff to try to remember customers ' names . Soon he began to call his markets &quot; Friendly Neighborhood Stores &quot; in advertisements . He used the same strategies for the rest of the stores in the company ' s expanding empire . Cashiers were also encouraged to relay customer requests to the manager , who in turn had the authority to order independently of any centralized ordering system . Each Top Valu could then closely tailor specialty merchandise to its neighborhood , whatever the population mix . The Long_Beach branch on Cherry Avenue and the Compton and Lawndale stores , for example , stock a section of Southern items , including instant Creole roux and gravy mix , hot pickled okra , collard greens and fat back . Shopping List HERBS AND CONDIMENTS * Camaron Molido : Along the costal areas of Mexico , fishermen dry shrimp to preserve them . These are often used ground , and now they even come_in plastic shaker-top jars . During Vigilias ( Lent ) , dishes based on dried shrimp replace meat and fresh_fish . The most famous of these , tortas de camaron , is an assault on the senses that demonstrates the complex character of true Mexican cooking . The tortas are little deep-fried puffy omelets made with separately beaten egg_whites and yolks and ground shrimp folded in . The rich mole that always sauces them calls_for the flesh of several kinds of dried chiles and strips of fresh nopales ( cactus paddles , which you can find in the produce section , whole or in bags , diced and ready to use ) . * Fresh Epazote : As basic as it is to cooking in Mexico , this herb has been elusive in California , possibly because some cooks grow the self-propagating weed-like plant at_home ( with a taste slightly different from the epazote grown in Mexico ) . Epazote is now starting to show_up in a_few restaurants but only spottily in markets . Top Valu ' s Santa Ana store is the first place I ' ve seen it on a regular basis in a supermarket . This sharp-tasting herb -- a cross between thyme and lemon , plus a mysterious something else -- is indispensable with fish , and it punches up the flavor of crab like nothing else . In south and central Mexico , epazote is regarded_as necessary in bean dishes , and also turns_up in salsas and even huevos rancheros . It is rarely used dried except for medicinal purposes . * Pico de Gallo Seasoning : Aptly named &quot; rooster beak &quot; for its sensory impact , pico de gallo seasoning is a blend of several kinds of ground chiles and salt . You see jars of it on the counters at the fruit stands on street_corners and at Mexican swap meets . People sprinkle it over cucumber or green mango slices or onto jicama and even oranges . The brand found at Top Valu includes a recipe for pico de gallo salad in which the above-mentioned fruits and vegetables are tossed with the seasoning and fresh lime_juice . * Achiote Paste and Powder : Among Mexico ' s first convenience_foods were recados , spice pastes that women sold in the marketplaces . The recado based on annatto has become the most popular because soaking and crushing the tiny , rock-hard annatto seeds that go_into it is an arduous task . A deep-brick-colored paste of the crushed seeds , garlic and other seasonings is pressed into solid 100-gram blocks called pasta de achiote condimentado ( achiote for short ) . Achiote paste is most frequently blended with jugo de naranja agria , the juice of sour Seville_oranges ( if these are out of season , a blend of fresh orange and lemon_juices substitutes fairly well ) . The marinade is smeared in a thick mass over roasts , sides_of_pork or chickens before the food is wrapped in banana leaves . Originally the leafy packets were cooked in an outdoor charcoal-heated pit oven , but broiling and barbecuing ( with or without the banana leaf wrapping ) are excellent alternatives . Achiote paste is most often found in the Mayan cooking of Yucatan , Guatemala or Belize . Cuban cooks prefer their achiote in the form of bijol , powdered annatto mixed with cornstarch that comes_in a tiny can the size of a walnut-half . Its most popular use is in Cuban yellow rice dishes where it takes the place of expensive saffron . A pinch of bijol may simply be added_to the rice cooking liquid . * Green Mole : There are hundreds of mole variations ; most of them require lengthy cooking and complex ingredients . Many moles contain several kinds of chiles and crushed nuts and seeds . I ' m not going_to tell you that a pre-made mole can compete with home cooking , but in a pinch it can make the same old chicken_breasts or cubed pork taste pretty terrific . You find green mole packed in jars in the Mexican food aisle . Unfortunately , the directions for using it are sketchy . The instructions tell you simply to dilute the mole with broth and pour it over meat or chicken . I prefer to chop about 1 / 4 cup white onion per person and saute lightly until tender , then add meat chunks or chicken_breasts to brown slightly . Next dilute the mole to a sauce-like consistency and add_to the pan ( it will thicken slightly , so have extra broth on_hand to thin the sauce ) . Simmer the mole , covered , until the meat is tender . Near the end of cooking time , add a handful of chopped cilantro . I like to make double portions of this because it can be eaten with rice or used in a burrito or a soft taco , and it ' s even better reheated . HOT DELI * Prepared Dishes : Top Valu ' s in-house cooks turn_out a small selection of home-style dishes every day . They may have chile colorado , pork chile verde or chilaquiles , sort of Mexican lasagna made from tortillas cooked with tomato salsa , then blanketed with cheese . There are also Salvadoran pupusas , savory pollos rotizados and sweet tamales for breakfast . * Carnitas : Carnitas , crisp chunks of fried pork , are well-known taco-stand fare . Less well known are the pork meats traditionally cooked carnitas-style , namely snouts ( trompas ) , ears ( orejas ) and buche ( part of the intestine ) . Each has its own special texture that devotees prize . I prefer the meaty , slightly chewy trompas cut_into slivers and eaten with good salsa in a taco . * Baked Goods : Baked on the premises are the baseball-mitt-shaped teleras , rolls used for tortas , Mexican-style submarine_sandwiches . Bolillos , Mexican-style French rolls , issue from the same oven . There ' s also a small , uninspired selection of pan dulce . DAIRY FOODS * Jocoque : Like crema Mexicana , jocoque is a cultured cream . But its particular culture gives it the more pronounced flavor of fresh cheese . Jocoque , in fact , is very similar to mascarpone but with a saltier taste . Like crema , it tops fruit_salads , tacos , gorditas or chiles rellenos . One jocoque label even suggests putting it on a baked potato . Several brands of jocoque are available . My favorite contains no gelatin , vegetable gums or other fillers . * Requeson : Basically , this is ricotta , a soft , unripened and only slightly drained cheese . When you buy the bulk-packed requeson from the butcher case , it is wonderfully creamy and especially nice with berries or sliced ripe mangos . Some like requeson with slices of gelled Latin_American fruit paste , usually guava or quince ( found around the corner from the hot deli ) . If drained until quite dry , requeson can be transformed into a scrambled-egg-style dish folded into a sauteed mixture of onions , tomatoes and chiles and served with tortillas . * Oaxaca Cheese : This mild , slightly chewy eating cheese is a near relative of mozzarella and a close cousin to Middle Eastern string_cheese . You ' ll find huge balls of it , looking_like balls of yarn , in the butcher ' s case along with the other bulk cheeses ; in the cheese department , small Oaxaca cheese balls are individually packed in plastic . PRODUCE * Jamaica : Agua de jamaica , a staple at almost every authentic Mexican food stand , is the ruby-red drink made by steeping hibiscus flowers ( actually the dried flower_bud coverings ) in water . It ' s never as good , though , as the more intensely flavored drink you can make at_home as easily as you brew tea . Look_for jamaica in bulk near the dried chiles . My recipe for agua de jamaica is simply to bring five cups of water to boil , then stir in 3 / 4 cup dried jamaica and remove the mixture from the heat . Cover and steep about 10 minutes . Add 1 / 2 cup of superfine granulated sugar , stirring very well . Allow the brew to cool in the pot , stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar . Next strain the brew into glass jars or bottles and chill well . Discard the flowers . Serve the agua with plenty of ice . If the infusion is a bit strong , add a little extra water . CHILES Some chiles , like the small green serrano or the medium-sized hot jalapeno , are fairly standardized across the country . But selecting certain chiles for a particular recipe can be a confusing task even when chiles are labeled . This is because poblano chiles , which go_by the name of ancho chiles when dried , are often mistakenly called fresh pasilla chiles in California and in Michoacan , a state from which many Mexicans have emigrated . Chiles anchos may have other names , among them pasilla and chile colorado , depending_on whom you ask and where your chile expert comes from . However , when real pasilla chiles are called_for in Mexican cookbooks , they must be the dried version of chiles chilacas . These true pasillas are easy to tell_apart from ancho / pasillas because they are long , skinny and wrinkly rather than short and stubby . But beware : Pasillas can also be called chiles negros . There are good_books to help dispel the confusion ; in the meantime , this quick guide may help : * Chiles Poblanos : These fist-size , fresh dark-green chiles are popular for chiles rellenos or as rajas , chile slices either cooked in cream with cheese or used as a garnish . Poblanos are usually quite mild . They are extremely mild if you remove all_the seeds and veins ( wear latex gloves to do this ) . They ' re also good for stuffing . * Anaheim Chiles : Also termed chile verde or chile verde del norte , these are long , two-inch wide mild peppers . * Chiles Anchos : One of the most widely used peppers in Mexican cooking , these wrinkly , wide chiles are a dark , almost black , burgundy color . They look almost exactly like the peppers called mulato chiles . Anchos have a fruity , some say prune-like taste . You can be sure an ancho is an ancho and not a mulato by holding it to the light ; the ancho will be more translucent . ( Remember , anchos are often called pasillas in California. ) * Chiles Pasillas : Another popular dried chile , often used in combination with others , pasillas stand_out from other long , thin dried chiles because they are the darkest colored and most wrinkly of all . Pasillas have a deep , complex , toasty flavor with a tart edge . MISCELLANEOUS * Cajeta : Sweetened , caramelized milk , cajeta is the Mexican equivalent of peanut_butter and jelly . Originally it was made without sugar from goat ' s milk and packaged in small wooden cajas ( boxes ) , from which the dessert gets its name . Now cow ' s milk cajeta in jars is more or less standard -- at least in urban Mexico . Cooks spread this golden , fudgy substance between layers of cake , or they fill crepes with it and sprinkle them with toasted pecans . The most baroque cajeta cake I ' ve ever seen was a cake roll filled with ice_cream and melted chocolate and covered with a cajeta sauce spread_over the outside under a coating of nuts -- a sort of upgrade of the banana_split . Cajeta has been borrowed from the dessert pantry for the everyday table . People serve a little dollop of it with queso fresco for a quick dessert . They drizzle it on waffles or make a quick snack by spreading it on crackers or toasted sandwich bread . Like peanut_butter , cajeta is also good spooned straight from the jar . * Horchata : The numerous cereal-based drinks still scarcely known north of the Rio Grande are basic to everyday Mexican eating . Champurrado is a hot_chocolate thickened with corn masa . Atoles are corn- or rice- or barley-based drinks that make nourishing breakfasts or between-meal snacks . One of the most prevalent grain-based refrescos , horchata , is a chilled , rice- and cinnamon-based drink that tastes like rice pudding in a glass . An instant version sold in paper envelopes eliminates the need for grinding all that soaked rice and makes_it easy to prepare one serving at a time . It even makes very low-fat_milk taste good .</TEXT>
