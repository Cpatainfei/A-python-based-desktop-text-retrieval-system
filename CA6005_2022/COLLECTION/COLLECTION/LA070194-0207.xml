   <HEADLINE> SEEMINGLY INCONCEIVABLE SCENARIOS BECOME REALITY IN TOPSY-TURVY JAPAN ; POLITICS : THREE POTENTIAL PRIME_MINISTERS ARE NAMED TO KEY POSTS IN NEW CABINET HEADED BY SOCIALIST CHAIRMAN TOMIICHI MURAYAMA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What ' s this ? A party at the helm of Japan controlling only 14 % of the seats in the lower house of Parliament ? Radical left-wingers supporting a coalition with the old conservative stalwarts ? Or , most unlikely of all , a Cabinet in which three potential prime_ministers hold_down the most important posts under a Socialist ? On Thursday , all three of those seemingly inconceivable scenarios became a reality in the topsy-turvy world of politics in Japan , which just a year ago was so stable that critics questioned if it really was a democracy . After all , what other democratic country had not experienced a change of government in 38 years ? Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama , Japan ' s new prime_minister , served_up the latest strange twists on Thursday when he named his Cabinet : * Yohei Kono -- who offered the nation ' s top post to Murayama instead of seeking it himself as head of the largest party , the Liberal Democrats -- was named foreign_minister , with an additional title as deputy prime_minister . * Masayoshi Takemura , the leader of the New Party Harbinger who is viewed_as a possible compromise prime_minister in the future , became finance_minister . * And Ryutaro Hashimoto , a Liberal Democrat who voluntarily bowed to Kono last August when the LDP chose a new leader , was named minister of international trade and industry . All three men differ from their back-bench predecessors in bringing both personal power and a reputation for making their own decisions to their posts . They also have vowed to end the rubber-stamping of decisions made by bureaucrats that pervaded the &quot; reform &quot; coalition administrations of Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata . Takemura , for one , on Wednesday overturned a Hata Cabinet acceptance of a Finance Ministry proposal that would have turned a plan to cut income_taxes to spur the economy into a program for a net tax increase in the future . &quot; Rather than fly off the bat into a decision fixing increases in the ( 3 % ) consumption tax , first we have to study how much costs can be cut by reforming the government ' s administration , just like private enterprises are doing as they carry_out restructuring , &quot; he said . &quot; After that , we can figure_out how much more revenue is needed &quot; to replace the shortfall from income-tax cuts . He also refused to set any deadline for a decision , defying the budget-balancing-obsessed Finance Ministry . The ministry wants legislation by the year ' s end to impose a consumption tax increase three years from now . Although Murayama noted that he had been chosen in &quot; uncommon fashion &quot; and said he wants to implement &quot; uncommon politics , &quot; his Cabinet -- except for the appointments of the three bigwigs -- was not uncommon . Seats were apportioned by seniority and factional affiliation in_line with the strengths of the coalition -- 13 to the Liberal Democrats , five to the Socialists and two to the New Party Harbinger . Only one woman , Makiko Tanaka , the outspoken daughter of the late Prime_Minister Kakuei Tanaka , was appointed . She became minister of science and technology . Man-in-the-street interviews aired on television_showed apprehension about a government headed by a party once noted for its &quot; opposition for opposition ' s sake &quot; approach to politics . Many predicted that Murayama , like his six predecessors in the last five years , would not last long . &quot; Do something to improve the economy &quot; was the most widespread request made of the new government . The emergence of the &quot; odd-triangle &quot; Cabinet itself underscored the upheaval that has altered the old assumptions of Japanese politics . Japan ' s own miniature version of the Cold_War -- the Liberal Democrats on America ' s side , the Socialists often on communism ' s side -- ended when the United States and Russia shook hands . Despite their official advocacy of abolishing the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty , the Socialists , for example , haven ' t said a word in years about getting_rid_of the alliance and the bases it provides to the United States in Japan . The Liberal Democrats , in their party charter , advocate constitutional revision -- which is anathema to the Socialists . Yet the LDP has done nothing for decades to press for revision . Last summer , defections of about 50 legislators broke the LDP grip on government , wiping_out the old definitions of political divisions between &quot; conservatives , &quot; who ran the government , and &quot; progressive reformists , &quot; who bided their time in the opposition . For the first time , conservatives supporting Hosokawa , then Hata , suddenly became the &quot; progressive reformists. &quot; The Socialists , who lost nearly half their seats in an election last July , were the big losers -- not the Liberal Democrats , who actually gained one seat compared with their post-rebellion holdings going_into the election . Even the old barometers of party seats in Parliament and the size of factions of legislators run_by political_bosses have become tenuous measuring_sticks in attempts to predict the future . The Socialists , for example , head the government holding only 14 % of the seats in the lower house . Even how much support Murayama ' s Cabinet has in Parliament is unknown . On paper , parties backing him should have produced 301 votes_in Wednesday ' s election . Yet Murayama polled only 261 in a runoff . Party discipline is cracking . Rebellions remain fermenting . And more realignments are likely as Japan seeks a new basis on which to deal with new issues . Should big government finance welfare costs for an aging population -- or should more self-reliance be sought ? Should government , through the standards it sets , continue to ensure consumer product safety , or should consumers assume the responsibility themselves ? Does Japan wish to play a greater international role , or remain a passive bystander in global politics ? More fundamentally , will Japan continue to rely_upon agonizingly slow consensus-making ( as Murayama ' s Cabinet appears to favor ) , or should votes be taken and majority decisions enforced ( as Ichiro Ozawa , Hata ' s chief strategist , argues ) ? Now that Japan has suddenly become a nation of coalition governments after knowing_nothing but rule by the Liberal Democratic Party from 1955 to 1993 , the answers , with few exceptions , can no longer be found within party structures , or even within party factions . In that sense , Murayama ' s coalition is not unique . The Liberal Democrats and Socialists already have far more experience in dealing with each other_than most people remember . During the long LDP rule , the two parties cooperated so that bills the Socialists opposed , or pretended to oppose , were enacted . Even scuffles and pushing matches were scripted , said Yasuhiro Tase , a senior political reporter for the Nihon Keizai newspaper . Murayama himself once served as his party ' s parliamentary steering_committee chief , and won a reputation for smooth dealings with the Liberal Democrats . Indeed , a bitter Hosokawa , whom the Liberal Democrats forced to resign in April over charges of questionable financial dealings , condemned the new coalition as yet another &quot; act of collusion &quot; between the two groups . He predicted it would be their last &quot; conspiracy. &quot; Murayama and Kono , however , asked voters to wait and see . Leaving home Thursday , Murayama said he would try to ease &quot; feelings of uneasiness &quot; that his election had caused &quot; in various circles. &quot; Kono challenged reporters to examine the new coalition ' s policies &quot; to see if we really have trouble reaching agreement &quot; on what to do and watch to see &quot; if we really are an ' illicit union , ' as critics charge. &quot;</TEXT>
