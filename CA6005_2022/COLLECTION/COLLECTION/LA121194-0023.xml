   <TEXT> &quot; We ' re on the Freeway , upon the Highway , that ' s the place to be . We ' re on the Right Way , there is no Left Way Let ' s go , the road is straight and clear . There are no bars ahead , there are no signs of red All the land is for you and me. &quot; Lumbering though it may be , this little ditty from one of the lavish stage shows the Los Angeles Police_Department held to raise money in the 1950s perfectly captures the competing desires that have pulled_at the heart of Los Angeles . On the one hand , it glamorizes the free city ( &quot; there are no signs of red &quot; ) , harking_back to our origin as the kind of Old Western town made legendary by such films as &quot; High_Noon &quot; and &quot; Unforgiven &quot; -- a place where everyone , from merchants to cowboys , gunmen to gamblers , could stake their own claim to the Great Frontier . On the other hand , the song also reflects the extraordinary social conformity that L.A. was striving to attain in the ' 50s ( &quot; there are , &quot; it also implied , &quot; no signs of Reds &quot; ) . Liberty and conformity , the Free Way and the Right Way : With ideals as conflicting as these , is it any wonder that this city exploded in 1992 ? &quot; To Protect and to Serve , &quot; Joe Domanick ' s vividly reported history of the LAPD since its formal inception in 1877 , shows how the department has often exacerbated these conflicts . But Domanick , a journalist whose 1990 L.A. Weekly piece on the LAPD won an L.A. Press Club award , refuses to scapegoat the police for their failure to resolve in the streets conflicts that really lie at the heart of our civic culture . Many of us , for instance , have hungered for the kind of intimate social community where people know their neighbors and dare to converse with strangers . But such a community necessarily requires a measure of conformity . Conservative ideologue Charles Murray , for instance , has recently touted his vision of Utopian American living -- a town where Americans care about , but also to some extent control , each other . For better or for worse , such a closely_knit community is the kind that the first modern police_force , London ' s &quot; bobbies , &quot; was designed to serve . As attorney Andrew Peyton Thomas shows in his new book &quot; Crime and the Sacking of America &quot; ( Brassey ' s : $ 25 ; 351 pp. ) , the bobbies practiced in the late 19th Century something traditionally regarded_as an innovation of the late 20th Century : community policing . Wearing blue to distinguish their mission from the offensive one of Britain ' s red-coated regular_army , the bobbies , Thomas writes , aimed to &quot; ferret_out crime before it actually occurred , mainly through getting_to know members of the community and encouraging their cooperation. &quot; The bobbies successfully kept crime under_control , but at the price of imposing sometimes rigid social mores on the people they served . Most Angelenos , in contrast , historically have clung tenaciously to their Old Western roots , preferring another , more libertarian vision of community : one in which we remain virtually free from the influence of others . This vision -- which leads the police to function more as soldiers than social_workers -- was championed most prominently by former LAPD chief Daryl Gates . Gates showcased his paramilitary strategies in a host of media events : Riding shotgun on an armored tank , for instance , he helped raze the walls of a suspected crack house with a 14-foot-long battering_ram ; appearing on CBS News , he effusively praised Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode ' s &quot; inspired and heroic &quot; decision to bomb the headquarters of a black radical organization called MOVE ( the first aerial bombing in the history of mainland America , the assault killed 11 people and set several blocks of housing ablaze ) . The harsher Gates ' rhetoric became , it seemed , the higher his public approval ratings soared : after a decade of touting programs with names like SWAT , CRASH and Operation Hammer and recommending to the U.S. Senate that &quot; casual drug_users ought to be taken_out and shot , &quot; for example , Gates received a 74 % approval rating in a 1988 Los Angeles Times Poll . As novelist and former LAPD sergeant Joseph Wambaugh told Times media critic David Shaw shortly before the riots of 1992 , Angelenos , who in 1981 and 1985 had voted_down ballot initiatives to improve the department ' s extremely low officer-resident ratios , had implicitly condoned Gates ' &quot; lean and mean &quot; approach to policing . In exchange for the &quot; unbelievable bargain &quot; of policing the city effectively with so few men , Wambaugh said , leaders and voters in Los Angeles have &quot; sort of given these people . . . a certain amount of latitude . . . ( to be ) very aggressive , paramilitary . . . stopping crime before it happens. &quot; People want that job done , &quot; and they don ' t want to hear about the dirty side of it . This is the deal the city made and now the city ' s crying about it. &quot; Of course , once George Holliday ' s videotape of the King beating showed us just how lean and mean the department ' s policing could be , our disregard was replaced by genuine concern . Shaw ' s articles on the department offered one explanation for why we didn ' t realize the problem sooner : Not until after the riots did journalists give prominent play to the fact that L.A. ' s violent crime_rate had become the nation ' s highest in the mid-1980s and that city payouts for lawsuits against the LAPD increased from $ 891 # 000 in 1980 to $ 14.7 million in 1991 . Domanick ' s comprehensive review of L.A. history also underscores how difficult it was for ordinary Angelenos to develop much of a lively and caring communal spirit . The biggest blow came_in the 1890s , when L.A. ' s &quot; boosters , &quot; in an effort to lure business from union-dominated San Francisco , attempted to stymie L.A. ' s labor_movement by refusing to give_in to workers ' strikes against wage reductions . By 1910 , striking printers at the L.A. Times , along with their allies in the labor_movement , grew so frustrated that they bombed the Times ' main printing plant , killing 21 employees . &quot; It ' s impossible to exaggerate just how stunning and unmitigated a disaster the dynamiting of the Times was for L.A. ' s labor_movement , &quot; Domanick writes . &quot; For decades afterward , visitors from London , New York , Chicago or San Francisco would be struck by the lack of a working class style , of a certain pride , a joie_de_vivre , a feeling that the city belonged_to the people whose sweat made_it go , as well as_to those who owned it. &quot; Angelenos ' alienation from their city grew in 1920s Prohibition , Domanick shows , when cops coddled Mafia kingpins while at_the_same_time arresting and jailing people in Little Italy who went so far as_to have wine with their dinner . By the 1930s , as Raymond Chandler ' s gumshoe Phillip Marlowe put it , L.A. had become a &quot; paradise of fakers . . . a city rich and vigorous and full of crime , a city lost and beaten and full of emptiness. &quot; While LAPD chief William Parker ferreted_out most corruption when he took_over the department in 1950 , his conviction that &quot; society was running amok &quot; led him to draw a thick blue line between his &quot; superior &quot; officers and the &quot; venal &quot; communities they patrolled . As Domanick writes , Parker ' s philosophy of &quot; The Grip &quot; discarded such &quot; archaic &quot; notions of policing as walking a beat , knowing the neighborhood and serving as a social mediator in favor of &quot; patrol_cars with faceless occupants detached from the community ; enforcing all laws and keeping an intense 24-hour surveillance over an equally faceless population. &quot; Parker ' s cops policed with such zeal , Domanick writes , that &quot; in 1956 alone , when crime was low and had yet to become the issue it is now in America , the LAPD would arrest 220 # 000 people , about 10 % of the population of L.A. &quot; Parker adopted a &quot; kill-the-messenger &quot; policy toward those who tried to warn him that his aggressive policing may end_up fomenting more unrest than it stopped . ( One such messenger , a young sergeant and mayor-to-be by the name of Tom Bradley , was summarily dismissed from his liaison work with the black community after sending the chief a memo about growing rage in that community. ) While Domanick unearths much dirt about the LAPD leaders , his book excels at drawing fair , empathetic , multidimensional portraits of their lives . Writers such_as 1930s Times reporter Harold Story , for instance , have vilified James Edgar Davis , LAPD chief in the late ' 20s and again through most of the ' 30s , as &quot; a burly , dictatorial , somewhat sadistic , bitterly antilabor man who saw Communist influence behind every telephone pole. &quot; Domanick , however , ventures beyond that caricature to show how Davis won his post only after years of picking cotton , mucking out stables and walking a police beat_in which he had , by his own estimate , to knock_down &quot; 1 # 000 doors. &quot; At the same time , Domanick shows how Davis fell prey to the same hypocrisy as some of those who recently supported Proposition 187 . The very man who came_to California dirt poor and uneducated later ordered borders erected along the major points_of_entry to the state . At one border , a billboard showed a blue-uniformed cop with his palm thrust_out near an imposing red &quot; STOP ! &quot; sign . &quot; To Protect and to Serve &quot; ultimately fails to analyze the city_council ' s often heated debates over which direction the LAPD should head now : toward paramilitary or community policing ? Chief Willie Williams , while a proponent of the latter strategy , realizes that it in a city spanning nearly 465 square_miles , it ' s no mean feat to institute bike patrols and other intimate community policing techniques . Nevertheless , community policing may be our only viable course , for history suggests that the only other direction may lead back to 1992 .</TEXT>
