   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; DEVAL PATRICK ; THE JUSTICE_DEPARTMENT ' S LEADING CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration is bullish on civil_rights . This Justice_Department aggressively champions voting_rights in several oddly shaped congressional_districts , which sent black members to the most integrated Congress in the nation ' s history . The U . S . Supreme Court is likely to take_up challenges to the alleged racial gerrymandering in North Carolina , Texas , Louisiana , Florida and Georgia . In this battle , the President sides with minorities . Unlike his predecessors , Clinton wants the districts to remain intact &quot; to ensure that the Constitution has meaning for minority voters. &quot; His advocacy proves that civil_rights is a priority for this Administration . In an even more formal reversal of the racial policies advocated by the Reagan and Bush_Administrations , the Clinton Justice_Department is arguing in favor of an appeal in a New Jersey affirmative_action case supporting the right of a school district to retain a black teacher while firing an equally qualified white with identical seniority . The Bush_Administration supported the white teacher , and won the case in the lower courts . The Clinton Justice_Department switched sides , and will argue on behalf of the local school_board , which had a voluntary affirmative_action plan and chose to consider race when downsizing . Clinton ' s tough point_man on civil-rights is Deval L . Patrick , now ensconced in the spacious office that once belonged_to J . Edgar Hoover . Racial discrimination is not theoretical to Patrick , 38 , who grew_up in a poor , black neighborhood on Chicago ' s South_Side . Scholarships allowed him to prep at Milton Academy , and complete undergraduate and law studies at Harvard_University . After graduation , he worked briefly in Los Angeles , while clerking for Judge Stephen R . Reinhardt , then for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , a rite of passage for many civil-rights lawyers , before joining a prestigious Boston law_firm . Patrick wasn ' t Clinton ' s first choice for the job of assistant attorney_general for civil_rights , which leads the federal fight against discrimination in housing , schools , lending , jobs and at the voting_booth . That honor went_to C . Lani Guinier , a law professor whose nomination was torpedoed by conservative challenges to her writings . After that political debacle and a long delay , Patrick got the nod for the important sub-Cabinet post , one of six Justice_Department divisions , which employs 500 lawyers and staff , has an annual budget of $ 55 million and argues roughly 300 court cases annually . Patrick , who plans to use his job as a bully pulpit , lives with his wife , Diane , a labor and employment attorney , and their two daughters in Washington . * Question : What ' s at stake in the redistricting cases in Georgia , Texas , North Carolina and Louisiana ? Answer : The two most important things to remember and appreciate about those cases are : . . . . One , the notion that these districts are bizarre shapes makes no sense when you take_a_look at congressional_districts across the country and realize that there is no such thing as a regular or normal shape . The other is the misnomer that these are districts where voters are segregated by race , when , in fact , they are the most integrated congressional_districts in the country and are responsible_for the most integrated Congress in history . What ' s at stake is the ability of voters in places where the politics are already racially polarized to be able to participate meaningfully in the process and elect candidates of their choice -- which is a right under the Voting Rights Act . If that concept is limited by a decision of the Supreme Court in the upcoming cases that does not take_account of those real circumstances and those real challenges and the history of the jurisdictions where these districts have been used , then we will have lost a lot of ground . Q : Why isn ' t this gerrymandering ? A : The way you ask the question indicates the common view gerrymandering is bad . Gerrymandering is traditional . Gerrymandering is done for a whole variety of reasons -- some of which the court has said are explicitly appropriate . First of all , district_lines have to be drawn for congressional races . The Constitution and federal law requires congressional_districts for congressional races . And , the district_lines are often drawn to protect incumbents or because of geography , because the river goes_in a certain way , or because the neighborhoods are different communities of interest , and a whole variety of factors . Race , by the way , is also a traditional consideration . . . . It has not always been used in ways that benefited or respected the strength of the minority vote . Q : Why are these cases so important 30 years after the Voting Rights Act passed ? Why is progress taking so_long ? A : Progress is significant in many of these places . The districts themselves represent a kind of progress . The districts are not appropriate everywhere , and it ' s not about whether minority voters can only be adequately represented by minority office holders . I don ' t accept that , and I don ' t think experience bears that out every place . The point to remember is that these districts are being litigated in places where the politics is already racially polarized , and where , in the absence of these districts , it would be impossible for the minority voter to have his or her interests represented adequately in the seat of power . That is the kind of situation the Voting Rights Act speaks_to . Q : Explain the Piscataway case . A : It ' s a case where the school district had to make a judgment about whom to let_go in a situation where declining school enrollments required that they let one teacher go . The first thing they did was consider seniority and they looked_to the most junior members of the business faculty and concluded there were two of absolutely equal seniority , with the least seniority . They started on the same day . Then they considered their performance for the years they had worked there , and they concluded that , based on their performance evaluations , they were absolutely equal in competence in the classroom . Then they considered their qualifications . They looked_at the training and so forth , and they concluded that they were absolutely equal in terms of their basic qualifications for the job . . . . Then the school_board decided , if you look_at it from the point_of_view of two people who were totally equal , we can do one of two things : We can flip a coin , or we can consider , using our affirmative_action plan , whether or how the decision will affect the diversity of the faculty . They expressed their interest in diversity by retaining the one minority teacher that they had ever had_on that faculty . Fortunately , the white teacher was rehired the next year . The significance of the case is two-fold . First , there is nothing in any case that holds that what Piscataway did violated federal statutes . I take a great_deal of pause from the notion that the previous Administration would attack the Piscataway School_Board for something that was not , in fact , a violation of law . Second , this was a voluntary plan that the local school district used to express its own interest in what was important . To the extent that can be done within the law , and considering the fact that many , many private employers have plans as restrained as this one , it is an important case for us to adjust our position . Q : Is it fair for the white teacher to lose her job ? Would it be fairer to flip a coin ? A : No . First of all , I don ' t think this is about what you or I or someone outside the Piscataway School District thinks is right . It ' s about whether Piscataway is entitled , under the law , to express its interest in what is important . . . . The second thing is Piscataway was faced with a very , very difficult decision , a decision very unlike most decisions that employers have to make . Most of the time , in reality , employers are able to make distinctions between people on the things that matter . But yes , I think that it is appropriate for Piscataway to think_about giving some rationale to its decision and to prefer that over a flip of the coin . Q : Is affirmative_action on the decline ? A : Affirmative_action has limitations in terms of both where it can be used under the law and where it should be used . Affirmative_action should be used in limited and restrained kinds of circumstances , but it still has an important benefit in the eyes of many employers . And that ' s something we ought to be able to support . Q : What do you mean by limited and restrained circumstances ? A : It ' s important to make the distinction between affirmative_action and quotas . . . . A numbers game is not appropriate , and serves few legitimate interests . . . . Affirmative_action is a more flexible , more comprehensive kind of inquiry that focuses first and foremost on quality , and then considers diversity in that context . That is not only a useful tool for employers , but a tool that many , many private employers all_over the country are using in_order to integrate their work_forces . that ' s a goal we should also support . Q : Were Americans more optimistic about civil_rights 30 years ago when we sang , &quot; We Shall Overcome &quot; ? There was a feeling then that this would become one nation , living_in harmony . Has that hope been replaced by pessimism or cynicism ? A : Not in my life or soul . Q : Thirty years ago , Dr. Martin_Luther_King Jr . said that he hoped his children would be judged by the content of their character , not the color of their skin . Has that day come ? A : We are closer today than we ever have been before , but it ' s clear , I think , to anybody who lives with their eyes open that we have a ways to go . There is no shame in not having reached that goal , in my view . The shame is in not continuing to strive for that goal . Q : A younger generation of African Americans , those 35 and under , are more likely now to embrace separatism . Are you familiar_with this trend ? A : I ' m familiar_with a_couple_of polls I ' ve read that indicate that African Americans are tired_of reaching_out and feel less hopeful , in some groups and some settings , of the dream that you referred to a moment ago from Dr. King . There are a variety of reasons for that , that stem from frustrations that many of us feel about the lack of progress we ' ve experienced in recent history , and the extent to which we ' ve moved away as a nation from an appreciation of that link I spoke_of a moment ago between civil_rights and American aspirations overall . But I think we can try to turn that around . that ' s probably the most important legacy I can leave from my term in this job . Q : What is the legacy of the Reagan / Bush era on civil_rights ? A : Many protections were eroded , and worse than that , the faith in and respect of some of those protections were eroded . We are seeing in this country a breakdown of a sense of the link between the aspirations of civil_rights and the aspirations of our highest national ideals . It ' s important for us to try , in the time we have , to restore some of that link . Q : Have you ever been a victim of discrimination ? A : Sure . I can remember times in boarding school when you couldn ' t go_off the campus without the local police stopping you and asking you what you were doing_in the neighborhood . I can remember going_to the local MacDonalds and being threatened by a crowd and called every manner of names when I was at Harvard . I can remember what we used to call &quot; drive-by insults &quot; -- when people would cruise by , slow_down , open the window and hurl out names that cut . Even today . I wear a jacket and tie to work . If I wear a pair of jeans over the weekend and go_into a nice store , I can pretty much be assured of being followed and treated suspiciously . It ' s not a daily diet for me like it is for some young_men and young_women in different circumstances than the rarefied ones I live_in . . . . We are still at a point in this country , not everywhere , but we are still in places in our national evolution where we are unable to see the person behind the skin . We will make progress past that . We have made progress . Q : There ' s a perception that class inoculates against discrimination , that affluent , accomplished African-Americans don ' t experience discrimination . A : that ' s wrong . There are scores of cases right here in the division to refute it , and I have my own experiences to refute it . In the housing context alone , I know many , many accomplished minority professionals who think_twice about accepting new professional opportunities in a new place because they just don ' t want to deal with the hassle of finding some place to live . So it is wrong to assume that class insulates anyone from anything that is civil-rights related . Q : Has race declined in significance ? A : In many , many quarters it has . It would be equally wrong to suggest that we have made no progress from when the real Civil Rights revolution began in the late 1950s . We have made enormous progress . The fact that I ' m sitting here is a kind of progress ; that you ' re sitting here is undeniable progress . Does that mean that we have come as far as we need to go or as we can go ? Of course not. *</TEXT>
