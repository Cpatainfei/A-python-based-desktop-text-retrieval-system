   <HEADLINE> SPOTLIGHT / SATURDAY ' S BOWL GAMES AT A GLANCE ; FAUST ' S FOOTBALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nineteen bowl games for those illustrious Division I-A schools . . . 38 teams earning bids . These are the times that fry men ' s , and women ' s , souls , if not brains . Then again , it might be one of life ' s little necessities . Because without this football feast how could Corporate America survive ? Excluding the Rose Bowl , the postseason has the smell of a mercenary . The Federal Express this , the Thirty Car Rental that . The IBM OS / 2 Fiesta Bowl , played Saturday , is our personal favorite , although we have yet to compute exactly what an OS / 2 is . Even worse , we ' re wondering how we missed the OS / 1 game . COME ON First , it was the West_Virginia Mountaineers . Now we have to put_up with Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz . The Mountaineers are no longer mentioning national-ranking rip-offs after their 41-7 trouncing in the Sugar_Bowl . That leaves Holtz alone on the soapbox . According to Holtz , his 11-1 Irish deserve to win the national championship as a result of Florida State ' s victory over previously unbeaten Nebraska . He reasons that Notre Dame defeated Florida State during the regular season . Never mind Notre Dame escaped the Cotton Bowl with a 24-21 victory over Texas A &amp; M . Holtz had an answer_for that , too . &quot; Playing A &amp; M here is very tough , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a home_game . We couldn ' t hear . Nobody wants to play A &amp; M in Dallas . It ' s never easy playing on road. &quot; Of course , Florida State ' s only loss came at South Bend , Ind . HOLD_ON Didn ' t UCLA Chancellor Charles Young , a member of the NCAA ' s prestigious Presidents Commission , have a seat in the Rose Bowl ? What was he doing on the sideline in the third quarter during a heated moment as Bruins and Badgers were mixing it up ? HOLD_OUT Terry Donahue said the third-quarter ejections of four players were regrettable , but he understood the foundation of frustrations . &quot; I honestly believe that a lot of the reasons for that happening were . . . there was a lot of holding , I mean a lot of holding , going_on out there -- by both sides -- and I don ' t think it was controlled properly by the officials. &quot; PAR FOR THIS COURSE Golfers among the 100 # 000-plus Rose Bowl crowd might have been aghast at seeing the lush turf of Brookside ' s two municipal courses trampled by cars , spectators and concessionaires . On the 16th hole of the No . 1 course , children were using one of the manicured bunkers as a temporary sand box . And sharp-legged lawn_chairs were digging some ugly divots . Officials of American Golf , operators of the two courses , said play will be under way today , however . SOFTLY INTO THE NIGHT Is this the last of the Texas A &amp; M Aggies at the Cotton Bowl for a while ? Many Texas football fans think so . Texas A &amp; M , which has appeared in three consecutive New Year ' s Day_games in Dallas , might be forced_out because of NCAA rules violations ( See Auburn and Washington ) . The NCAA Committee on Infractions is expected to rule this week on a case alleging Texas A &amp; M football_players were paid_for work they did not complete . Aggie fans are bracing for two years of probation . UNBURDENING BOBBY Understandably happy for Coach Bobby Bowden , who was drenched with a victory shower before the game had officially ended , Florida State ' s players said they won this one for their coach . &quot; I didn ' t get caught_up in that ' poor old Bobby ' thing because he ' s a great person , &quot; free safety Richard Coes said . &quot; This is something different for his trophy_case , though . I think it ' s fitting that we did this for him. &quot; CONFERENCE COUNTDOWN Notre Dame and Louisville gave independents , a dying breed , some recognition with their postseason victories . The Big West , that bastion of athletic prowess , followed with Utah State ' s victory over Ball State in the Las Vegas Bowl . But when it comes_to conference bragging rights , the Big Eight and Pacific 10 , each 3-1 in bowls , will boast the loudest . The breakdown : Independents 2-0 Big West 1-0 Big Eight 3-1 Pac 10 3-1 Big East 2-2 Big Ten 4-3 SEC 2-2 ACC 2-3 Mid-American 0-1 Southwest 0-2 WAC 0-4 WISCONSIN WOES A sea of red-and-white passengers heard this special greeting on American Flight 1293 en route from Chicago to L.A. on Friday . &quot; We want to welcome all you Bruin fans ! &quot; Then , there was this sign outside one Pasadena residence near the Rose Bowl before Saturday ' s game : &quot; Need Tickets ? We don ' t have any . Ha ha. &quot; WISCONSIN WONDERS Michael Feldman , host of American Public Radio ' s &quot; Whad ' ya Know ? &quot; comedy show at the University of Wisconsin , sees a boon in the Badgers ' victory . &quot; We ' re about a mile from Camp Randall ( Stadium ) , so we get five bucks a car to park ' em , &quot; he said from his Madison home . &quot; This looks_like a good franchise in the future. &quot; Feldman , watching the game on television , noted : &quot; The announcers still call us Wes consin like there is an East consin. &quot; About the only flaw in this beautiful Badger day was the cow representing the state in the Rose Bowl Parade , Feldman said . &quot; We ' re trying to lessen that profile , the bovine thing , &quot; he said . &quot; There ' s a lot here besides cows . There ( are ) bulls for one thing . . . and quite a_few sheep. &quot; LEADERS A look_at some of the day ' s top performers . PASSING 05 # 23 , 07 # 06 , 06 # 04 Player Comp . Att . Yds .

It happened right before Christmas at the Westown Mall in Knoxville , Tenn . &quot; My brother Benjie and I were shopping for a birthday when he says , ' We ' ve got_to go , ' &quot; Shuler said . &quot; I turn_around and there were 20 or 30 fans walking real abruptly toward us . He and I just took_off running_out of the mall . We just didn ' t have time to stop and sign autographs . You sign one and it ' s like a chain_reaction . It can be a good hour ' s wait. &quot; Shuler has even resorted_to disguises , wearing hats and glasses . But it doesn ' t work . &quot; People just come_up_to you and ask you if you ' ve got bad eyes. &quot; MAKING THE BIG PLAY As soon as the Rose Bowl game ended , safety Scott Nelson of Wisconsin proposed to Becky Klieforth , and , voila , they were engaged . The couple are from that little piece of paradise known as Sun Prairie , Wis . &quot; I got_down on my knees , &quot; Nelson said . &quot; She seemed a little shaky at first , but she finally said yes. &quot; OH , NO , NOT THAT SONG AGAIN A longstanding tradition at Tennessee is the playing of the song , &quot; Rocky Top , &quot; just about any time the Volunteers do something . It ' s almost enough to make you want to hear &quot; Conquest. &quot; Almost . But now , in this era of thought police and political correctness , this song could easily be interpreted as the story of lurid animal sex , rampant alcoholism and a hint of multiple murder . In addition , its reference_to smog is a clear slap at Los Angeles . How can this song be played in the let ' s-not-offend-anyone 90s ? Judge for yourself . ( Editor ' s note : The Times takes no responsibility for any emotional harm that reading these lyrics might cause. ) &quot; I wish that I was_on old Rocky Top &quot; Down in the Tennessee hills &quot; Ain ' t no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top &quot; Ain ' t no telephone bills. &quot; &quot; Once I had a girl on Rocky Top &quot; Half bear , other half cat &quot; Wild as mink but sweet as soda_pop &quot; I still dream about that. &quot; &quot; Rocky Top , you ' ll always be home sweet home to me &quot; Gold old Rocky Top &quot; Rocky Top , Tennessee &quot; Rocky Top , Tennessee. &quot; &quot; Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top &quot; Looking_for a moonshine still &quot; Strangers ain ' t come_down from Rocky Top &quot; Reckon they never will. &quot; &quot; Corn won ' t grow at all on Rocky Top &quot; Dirt ' s too rocky by far &quot; that ' s why all_the folks on Rocky Top &quot; Get their corn from a jar. &quot; NOTEWORTHY Penn State has won the coin toss nine times this season , all victories . . . . Coach Joe Paterno of Penn State tied Bear Bryant for the most bowl victories for a coach with 15 . The breakdown : Fiesta ( 5 ) , Orange ( 3 ) , Cotton ( 2 ) , Aloha ( 1 ) , Citrus ( 1 ) , Holiday ( 1 ) , Liberty ( 1 ) , Sugar ( 1 ) . At Atlanta , Matthew Dorsett returned a fumble 12 yards for the game ' s only touchdown and Southern University beat South Carolina State , 11-0 , in the Heritage Bowl . . . . California ' s football_players paid tribute to kidnap victim Polly Klaas of Petaluma by wearing her initials on their helmets in Friday ' s Alamo Bowl . Florida State extended its bowl unbeaten streak to 12 and its winning streak in bowls to an NCAA record nine . . . . Miami , college football ' s best team in the last 10 years , has lost all three Fiesta Bowl appearances . The Hurricanes also lost twice in Sugar_Bowl games that determined national championships . . . . Only 69 # 855 tickets were sold for the Cotton Bowl , the least since 67 # 381 watched Boston College beat Houston , 45-28 , in 1985 . Lawrence Wright ' s interception return for a touchdown in the second quarter of the Sugar_Bowl was the first by a Florida player in a bowl game in school history . . . . Florida , 10-11 in bowl games , won consecutive postseason games for the first time . QUOTEWORTHY Said Coach Don Nehlen of West_Virginia , after his team was routed by Florida in the Sugar_Bowl in New Orleans : &quot; Bourbon Street didn ' t bother us . The guys in orange pants bothered us. &quot; Said Penn State quarterback Kerry Collins , forgetting the team ' s games against Rutgers ( 31-7 ) , Maryland ( 70-7 ) and Northwestern ( 43-21 ) : &quot; They ' re ( Tennessee ) not used to playing in big_games . We ' re in the Big Ten , we ' re used to playing bowl-type games every week. &quot; Said Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler , upon being asked about his future : &quot; I ' m going_to get_on the bus . Go_back to the hotel . Then go some place next week where none of you ( reporters ) can find me. &quot; And junior Tyrone Wheatley , Michigan tailback , when asked about his future : &quot; I ' m not talking_about it. &quot; NBC ' s Tom Hammond , at the Fiesta Bowl , noted : &quot; The first big play of the day will be the coin toss. &quot; Notre Dame quarterback Kevin McDougal , recalling the previews : &quot; We knew what Texas A &amp; M was about . We saw the film. &quot; Defensive back Brandon Sanders of Arizona , on Miami ' s attitude about the Wildcats ' vaunted defense : &quot; I don ' t think they really believed_in the ( Desert ) Swarm. &quot; EXTRA POINT Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post wonders : &quot; Do we really need the new Carquest Bowl ? What is Carquest , a computer dating service for sedans ? &quot;</TEXT>
