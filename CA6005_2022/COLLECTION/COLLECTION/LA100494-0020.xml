   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON HAITI ; FORCING A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL ; INTERNATIONAL AID-GIVERS PUSH THE SAME OLD TOP-DOWN PLANS THAT HELP THE RICH AND ENSURE CONTINUED POVERTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While the U.S. military occupies Haiti , a second , more powerful invasion force is close behind . Made_up of economists , agriculturalists , lawyers and financiers , the stated mission of this army of so-called development experts is to restore economic viability and help alleviate poverty in Haiti . Yet their approach is likely to do little to address the root causes of poverty and instability in that country , if the plans presented by the international donors are any indication . Three years of a military dictatorship have taken an extraordinary toll on the people of Haiti . Government services , never very effective , ceased to function soon after the coup . Road and irrigation systems are now a shambles . Productive inputs are unavailable to small_farmers . Inflation is rampant and massive amounts of public funds have been stolen by the illegal government and its associates . The targeted attacks by coup supporters on Haiti ' s vibrant grass-roots development community have also undermined the rural economy , where more_than 70 % of Haitians make their living . The theft and destruction of credit-union funds , food-storage facilities , tree nurseries , tools , machinery and livestock -- not to mention the negative impact of the embargo and the fact that tens of thousands of people have been in hiding for three years -- have severely decapitalized both individual farms and social-change organizations that peasants painstakingly built to address the daunting economic and social challenges to their survival . At an informal meeting on Haiti ' s economic future held_in Paris at the end of August , Jean-Bertrand Aristide ' s constitutional government told international donors that it intended to include grass-roots cooperatives , women ' s groups , peasant associations , labor_unions , business_organizations and other key groups in civil society in the design and implementation of economic programs and policies . However , the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World_Bank , despite their rhetoric about the importance of democratizing development , are proceeding in typical top-down fashion and have yet to present any plans for including the Haitian people in determining what is best for their country . The product of this top-down process , not surprisingly , is a $ 532-million development loan and assistance package that neglects the needs of the poor . For example , while small-farmers ' organizations and other groups have called_for strengthening peasant agriculture , the U.S._government and international finance institutions are promoting the creation of a &quot; macroeconomic framework &quot; that would do just the opposite . Permitting only meager tariff protection for a handful of local food crops , import-liberalization policies pushed by donors promise to undermine local small-scale production while freeing rich Haitians to use scarce foreign_exchange to purchase luxury goods . Furthermore , it appears that the bulk of donor technical assistance , investment and credit funds will be directed toward export agriculture and assembly industries -- most of the benefits of which accrue to only a handful of Haitians -- rather than to peasants , who make_up the majority of the population . Another major issue is the sub-poverty-level wage paid to workers . Minimum_wage in Haiti has decreased from $ 3 a day in the mid-1980s to its current level of less than $ 1 . Despite this decline , donors are not encouraging any official increase in the minimum_wage , to date recommending only that the private sector voluntarily adjust wages to reflect increased costs_of_living . This is cause for alarm , since the private sector in Haiti has consistently and vehemently opposed any attempts to establish a livable minimum_wage . As in so many other countries around the world , the international community is wielding development assistance like a sword in_order to create social and economic structures that suit international , not local Haitian , interests . Donors cite the need for enforcing fiscal discipline as a rationale for their imposition . But , in the case of Haiti , this is unnecessary , as the Aristide government is already firmly committed to sound economic management , as it proved during its eight months in office in 1991 . The fact is that the Haitian government is being forced into a pact with the_devil . To obtain critically needed financing , it has accepted conditions that run counter to majority interests and that will stand_in the way of an equitable resolution of Haiti ' s economic_crisis . To avoid further trauma and destabilization , the international community must stop imposing development strategies and economic frameworks . Rather , it should work with the constitutional government to put the Haitian people in the driver ' s seat . After all , that is what real democracy is all about .</TEXT>
