   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : COMPANY TOWN ; LUCRATIVE LOVE_AFFAIR WITH THE BEATLES ; FILMS : ' A HARD DAY ' S NIGHT ' WAS A HIT 30 YEARS AGO . NOW PRODUCER SHENSON PLANS A DOCUMENTARY ON ITS MAKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> People always complain that the path to success in Hollywood is unknowable , but veteran producer Walter Shenson says he has the answer . &quot; Just make_sure your first film is a hit , &quot; he explained with a laugh over breakfast recently at the Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel . Shenson knows of what he speaks . His first several films were successes , which is an especially good career move . And this year Shenson is making plans to celebrate the biggest of them all . It was 30 years ago that Walter Shenson asked a band called the Beatles to play themselves in a movie . The result was &quot; A Hard Day ' s Night , &quot; which many still consider the best rock ' n ' roll_film of all time . Shenson hopes to rekindle a bit of Beatlemania with &quot; The Making of a Hard Day ' s Night , &quot; a television documentary timed to coincide with the film ' s 30th anniversary this fall . The project will include unseen footage and interviews with behind-the-scenes participants . The idea for the documentary came_to the producer about a year ago . The surviving Beatles were already at_work on a comprehensive documentary on the band , but Shenson says they said OK to his project after witnessing the excitement generated earlier this year by the 30th anniversary of their first_appearance on &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show. &quot; &quot; They were nervous about a conflict at first , &quot; Shenson said . &quot; And I ' ve never wanted to do anything in conflict with them . We ' ve always worked together . But after ( the Sullivan anniversary ) they said , ' Go ahead. ' So I had their blessing. &quot; The fact that Shenson still refers to the Beatles as &quot; the boys &quot; when the surviving members are_well into middle_age is a sign of how long they ' ve been in business together . Shenson was a producer living_in London , best known for having made the 1959 Peter Sellers breakthrough movie , &quot; The Mouse That Roared , &quot; when a call came that changed his fate . &quot; I was approached by United Artists to make a movie with the Beatles , and I said , ' You mean those kids with the long hair and guitars ? ' &quot; said Shenson , who was in his early 40s at the time . Shenson says UA was more interested in the soundtrack that would result from the movie than the movie itself , since there was no reason to think audiences were interested in a pop band comedy . A meeting with the group and their manager , Brian Epstein , soon followed at Abbey Road studios . After the deal was made , Shenson casually instructed the band to come_back to him with six new songs . The Beatles started filming the movie soon after their Ed Sullivan appearance , and the $ 500 # 000 , Richard Lester-directed film premiered in August , 1964 . So popular was the movie , which was shot in black-and-white documentary style , that Shenson claims UA got its money back in one day . But it was Shenson who had the last laugh . Under the contract with UA , the rights to both &quot; A Hard Day ' s Night &quot; and its follow-up , &quot; Help ! , &quot; reverted to him and the Beatles after 15 years -- just in time to exploit the video and cable TV revolutions . &quot; I ' ve gotta tell you , the money does come_in , &quot; Shenson said of the profits from the two movies , which he and the group split equally . &quot; You ought to see the size of the checks I send them. &quot; &quot; The Making of a Hard Day ' s Night &quot; may prove another bonanza for Shenson , since he plans to syndicate it worldwide . The documentary is narrated by Phil Collins , who was a 12-year-old extra in the original movie . Shenson ' s biggest gem is concert footage of &quot; You can ' t Do That , &quot; a song that appeared on the soundtrack but was cut from the movie because of time considerations . The producer remains active in the business , with two projects in development and well-received recent movies such_as &quot; Reuben , Reuben &quot; and &quot; Echo Park &quot; to his credit . But it ' s clear from all_the 1960s memorabilia that clutters his office that much of what he was and came_to be is still tied to those halcyon days with the Beatles . &quot; I really felt_like I was in the middle of a Marx Brothers movie , &quot; Shenson said . * Image make-over : With Europeans examining why their entertainment_industry is so troubled , Hollywood ' s United International Pictures is trying to avoid being cast as the scapegoat . The company , which distributes films overseas for Paramount Pictures , Universal Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , has put_out a detailed rebuttal to charges that it is monopolizing European theaters . The report , titled &quot; UIP : The Real Picture , &quot; is being widely distributed in Europe and the United States . It makes the case that the distributor has actually lost market share since 1989 , that it encourages competition , and that it poses no threat to European culture . The public relations campaign comes as UIP fights an uphill battle to renew its special operating agreements with European governments . In an open_letter that accompanies the report , UIP President Michael Williams-Jones says much of the criticism of the company is &quot; ill-informed. &quot;</TEXT>
