   <HEADLINE> DIET WOES DANGER FOR DANCERS ; DISORDERS : UNHEALTHY THINNESS MAY BE AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD FOR MANY IN THE PROFESSION . THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO ABUSE DRUGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An unhealthy thinness may_not simply be an occupational hazard for ballet_dancers . Some researchers fear that it may also be an occupational disease . One report finds many dancers have eating disorders . But the study also indicates that dancers ' problems may_not be as bad as those facing non-dancers who have eating disorders . It says non-dancers are more likely to also abuse drugs . This may mean the dancers ' weight problems are driven more by the demands of their profession , the researchers believe . The report in the American College of Sports Medicine ' s journal , Exercise and Science in Sports and Medicine , compared 50 dancers with 56 non-dancers , all women . The researchers used questionnaires and clinical interviews to check for eating disorders and substance_abuse . They also looked_for medical problems including weight loss . The dancers were primarily drawn from national and regional ballet_companies ; the non-dancers , primarily from private high_schools and colleges . Dancers averaged 21 years of_age ; non-dancers , 23 years . Thirty-six percent of each group had missed periods for five months or more . Although this can result from high levels of exercise , it also can result from a sharply restricted diet . The dancers averaged almost 11 % below ideal weight , the study said . &quot; For a normal person to try to keep our weight_down there , we would have to starve ourselves , &quot; said Dr. Michelle P . Warren of Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York . Non-dancers ' weight averaged about 5 % low , the study said . The non-dancers also &quot; do not represent a normal population in terms of normal eating , &quot; said Warren , an associate_professor . &quot; These people were struggling to stay thin. &quot; Thirty-one percent of dancers met clinical definitions of anorexia_nervosa , which is characterized by a pathological fear of weight gain . Fifteen percent of non-dancers did , the study said . But this greater tendency of dancers to have anorexia fell_short_of the statistical level needed to say that the two groups were clearly different . The groups had no statistical difference in the prevalence of bulimia , which is characterized by compulsive eating followed by self-induced vomiting . Twelve percent of dancers and 15 % of non-dancers had this condition . Warren and her colleagues wanted to know about drug use in each group , thinking that a greater tendency to use drugs would indicate greater psychological problems . Dancers who had anorexia or bulimia were no more likely than other dancers to use drugs , the study said . Non-dancers who had anorexia were more likely to use amphetamines , while non-dancers who had bulimia were more likely to use amphetamines , barbiturates and hallucinogens , the study said . Non-dancers also were more likely than dancers to develop other signs of emotional distress , such_as anxiety and depression , the study said . This indicates that at least part of dancers ' preoccupation with thinness &quot; is imposed upon them by their profession , &quot; Warren said . A separate researcher who also had been studying the eating patterns of dancers agrees . &quot; I have found almost no substance_abuse , &quot; said Jane Bonbright , a board_member of the National Dance Assn. , an educators ' professional group in Reston , Va . Warren and Bonbright are concerned that dancers are not getting enough calcium to build strong bones while they are relatively young . They say the dancers may suffer for this after menopause by developing osteoporosis , a thinning of bone , which can led to fractures .</TEXT>
