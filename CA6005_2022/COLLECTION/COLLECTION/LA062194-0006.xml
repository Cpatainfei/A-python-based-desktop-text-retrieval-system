   <HEADLINE> SPOUSE BATTERING : THE CRIME_WAVE TOO OFTEN FORGOTTEN ; SIMPSON CASE PUTS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE LIMELIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s unfortunate it may take the arrest of a high-profile celebrity like O . J . Simpson to focus the nation on domestic violence , a very serious problem that for too long has been cast by its sorry practitioners as a &quot; private family affair. &quot; It may be that the extraordinary events of last week will prove to be the beginning of the end of that neglect . We must keep_in mind , of course , that the former football star and well-liked celebrity has pleaded not_guilty to charges that he murdered his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman and that under our system of justice he is absolutely entitled to the presumption of innocence . However , it is irrefutable that the sports commentator pleaded no contest to a 1989 misdemeanor charge of spousal battery against Nicole Simpson . According to police records released last week , Simpson beat his then-wife so badly that she required treatment at a hospital after police_officers found her cowering in bushes in front of their home . The beating left her with a cut lip , a blackened left eye , a bruised cheek and a hand imprint on her neck , according to the police report . She told the responding officers she wanted Simpson arrested . The police record quotes O . J . Simpson as saying , &quot; The police have been out here eight times before , and now you ' re going to arrest me for this ? &quot; Simpson served no jail time after his 1989 no-contest plea despite a recommendation from the prosecutor in the case that he do so . Instead , Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Ronald Schoenberg sentenced Simpson to 120 hours of community service and two years ' probation . And Simpson had to pay only $ 200 in fines and contribute only $ 500 to a shelter for battered women . The judge also allowed him to be treated by the psychiatrist of his choice -- and to be treated over the telephone rather than undergo the customary face-to-face counseling program for men who batter their wives . Simpson ' s unusually light sentence is , sadly , symptomatic_of how ineffective our legal_system historically has been in responding to this commonplace crime of violence . The statistics are chilling : Women are four times more likely than men to be killed by their spouses or domestic partners , according to the most recent figures from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence . Nationally , FBI statistics show that a woman is battered every 15 seconds and that more_than one-fourth of all murders of women are committed by spouses . Los Angeles Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti contends that a woman is killed in Los Angeles County every nine days in an episode of domestic violence . It is of course not true that domestic violence is confined to crimes by men ; see the piece on today ' s Commentary page by Judith Sherven and James Sniechowski . Generally , only in the last decade have police_departments across the nation begun to arrest batterers and have prosecutors begun to file charges even when a woman withdraws her complaint ( often in response to her mate ' s threats or pleas ) . In Los Angeles , Garcetti , who was elected L.A. County district_attorney in 1992 , has made the issue of domestic violence one of his career-long priorities . It ' s true that these are often tough cases for the authorities . Police traditionally dislike responding to domestic violence calls ; such investigations are dangerous and emotionally messy . Sometimes the victim doesn ' t want to believe that her mate really meant to do her harm . She may even turn_on the officers . That complicates the problem enormously , and women ' s shelters are_full of bruised survivors trying to break the cords of their relationship . California ' s immensely helpful stalking laws are in the forefront of legislation because they let police arrest a mate who violates a judge ' s order to stay_away_from a battered spouse . ( There ' s no evidence that Nicole Simpson ever sought a restraining order against her ex-husband. ) If there is any good to come of the Simpson tragedy , it could be in_advancing a candid public discussion about domestic violence and perhaps initiating policy_changes to address this horrendous problem with stronger deterrents and tougher punishments . Unchecked by better police work , not to mention by wiser and firmer justice from the bench , domestic violence , particularly spousal abuse , will remain perhaps America ' s least-attended-to crime_wave .</TEXT>
