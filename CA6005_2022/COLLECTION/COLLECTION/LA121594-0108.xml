   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEWS ; ANNUAL COOKBOOK ISSUE ; THE YEAR ' S TASTIEST PAGE-TURNERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cookbooks tend to to pour_out of publishing_houses much like water from a spigot , and this year , in particular , was a deluge . There were texts devoted to fusion , meat-free , gluten-free and &quot; nurturing &quot; cooking -- and heaven only knows how many_more pasta recipes have been added_to the drink . The following selection includes some of the year ' s best books . Although the range of these books is representative , the list is far from comprehensive ; I chose these books simply because once I started reading them , I couldn ' t put them down . There are two memoirs , one of a cloistered Sicilian girlhood , the other from a year spent with a famous stepmother in Coyocan , Mexico . There ' s an encyclopedic book of home desserts , and a gorgeous picture-book guide to Paris bakeries . Two regional cookbooks cover the Eastern Mediterranean and the Northern U.S. heartland . You could read any one of these books and learn a great_deal that you probably didn ' t already know -- about cooking , foodstuffs , history and people in_general . I now know that sugar used to come_in loaves that were cut with special knives ; I know that orphan girls in Sicilian lay convents had to march in every funeral procession as a kind of public_service whether they knew the deceased or not . I know that the Chippewa had their own names for the months and that December was &quot; Spirit Month &quot; and that January was &quot; Big Spirit Month. &quot; I know that Frida Kahlo read Freud . I know that the man who owns La Maison du Chocolat in Paris , a Mr. Linxe , eats 10 to 15 chocolates a day and makes 35 tons of chocolate a year . I also now know how to make kibbeh . * CLASSIC HOME DESSERTS : A Treasury of Heirloom and Contemporary Recipes From Around the World By Richard Sax ( Chapters : 1994 ; $ 29.95 ; 688 pp. ) After spending years poring over cooks ' handwritten notebooks in the Rare Books and Manuscript Collection at the New York Public_Library , after gathering everybody ' s great-aunt ' s favorite cobbler recipe , and after resuscitating , refining and / or reinventing any number of long-loved or forgotten desserts in the kitchen , Richard Sax now gives us a big wonderful &quot; treasury of heirloom and contemporary recipes from around the world. &quot; &quot; Classic Home Desserts &quot; has a practical design , with clearly presented recipes and pink margins for anecdotal material , but it ' s not beautiful . Anne Disrude ' s food styling has a certain homey charm and photographs by Alan Richardson are adequate , but the photographs are poorly reproduced on bad stock , and wind_up looking_like those old , discolored recipe pamphlets from the ' 50s . The book deserves a classier and costlier presentation , for it is an amazing and useful encyclopedia of food history , cooking knowledge and amusing arcana . Sax is a good , feisty , honest writer , an impressive researcher and lover of odd facts . The book contains , he says , only the best example in each category of home dessert . Still , it seems exhaustive : there are four chapters on pies alone ( five if you include the chapter on tarts ) and four chapters on cakes ; the first , &quot; Plain Cakes and Cakes with Fruit , &quot; includes sub-sections on gingerbreads and apple cakes . &quot; Classic Home Desserts &quot; was written with the home cook in mind , which means there is nothing too professional -- too time consuming , too technically demanding . No Napoleons . No Danish_pastries . &quot; Home bakers , &quot; writes Sax , &quot; are not likely to make three different fillings for a cake. &quot; In formulating his recipes for contemporary tastes , Sax has cut_down , when feasible , on sugar and fat , although he pointedly states , &quot; I do not believe_in making low-calorie imitations of old-fashioned desserts. &quot; His recipe for panna cotta did seem to have the least amount of cream possible for an alleged &quot; cream custard , &quot; but the final result was marvelous , redolent_of vanilla_bean and fresh lemon and just rich enough . The margins are_full of old recipes , asides and literary tidbits . There are quotes from &quot; Mary Poppins Comes_Back , &quot; from Thoreau ' s &quot; Walden , &quot; from Dorothy Alison ' s &quot; Bastard Out of Carolina. &quot; There ' s a recipe for spelt or farina pudding from the late 4th Century , and , printed in full , Alice B . Toklas ' recipe for hashish fudge ( Toklas suggests , &quot; . . . it might provide an entertaining refreshment for a Ladies ' Bridge Club or chapter meeting of the DAR &quot; ) . In short , the book is a joy to cook from ; instructions are clear , easy to read , the results dependable : It ' s the book I ' ll be giving this Christmas . * BITTER_ALMONDS : By Maria Grammatico and Mary Taylor Simeti ( William Morrow and Co. : 1994 ; $ 20 ; 200 pp. ) In 1952 , in impoverished , post-war Sicily , Maria Grammatico ' s father dropped_dead of a heart_attack leaving 12-year-old Maria , her four siblings and her pregnant mother with virtually no means of support . So , five days before Christmas , she and a sister were dropped_off at the Convent of San Carlo in Erice . Maria would not see her mother again for almost a year -- the nuns forbade the pregnant woman to visit , lest the girls glimpse her &quot; big belly. &quot; The cloistered Franciscan convent may have kept the Grammatico girls fed , but life there was one of unrelenting poverty and deprivation . As Grammatico tells Mary Taylor Simeti , &quot; The food was always the same : beans , cauliflower , beans , cauliflower , and then sometimes they ' d give us peas . You know the kind ? The dried split peas ? They always stuck_to the pot and burned . The stink was enough to kill you . Down the toilet ! Baah ! We managed to survive , though , that ' s for sure. &quot; To generate income , the nuns and orphans made almond pastries and cakes that were sold to the general public through an iron grate . These were simple items : cookies , biscuits , marzipan fruit , Paschal lambs for Easter , the occasional quince or cream tart by special order . Nothing went_to waste . Even burnt pastries were ground up with an orange , sugar and spices and recycled into another sort of pastry . After 10 years at San Carlo , Maria Grammatico , thinking she had a vocation for the religious life , went_to take_a_look at a cloistered Carmelite convent . There she suffered from a nervous collapse and was brought_home , paralyzed and comatose . Back in her mother ' s house , she recovered and soon , at age 24 , found her true vocation : With a wood-burning oven , a hand-cranked nut grinder and a rolling pin , she opened her own pastry shop . Today Pasticceria Maria Grammatico is a large , successful enterprise and mecca for tourists . Simeti wrote_about Grammatico ' s pastries for Gourmet magazine several years ago and decided then that Grammatico ' s life and recipes deserved a book . &quot; Bitter_Almonds ' &quot; text comes from transcribed , edited tapes and reads like the rough draft of a novella by someone like Alice Munro . Recipes are adapted for the home cook , but The Times Test Kitchen had problems with the simple almond_cookies called &quot; Suspiri , &quot; or &quot; Sighs , &quot; made from the basic almond pastry_dough : The cookies kept spreading_out into thin lacy wafers instead of the plump rounds pictured in the book . At home , I got a slightly rounded cookie if I ground the almonds quite fine ( directions read medium-fine ) and found the cookies held their shape even better if the dough sat for a_couple_of days in the refrigerator . Still , even the flattest cookies were quite delicious . * PARIS BOULANGERIE PATISSERIE : By Linda Dannenberg ( Clarkson Potter : 1994 ; $ 35 ; 160 pp. ) The prettiest book of the season is a lavish picture_book of Parisian bakeries , &quot; Paris Boulangerie and Patisserie , &quot; by Linda Dannenberg , who last gave us the equally gorgeous &quot; Paris Bistro Cooking. &quot; While the text is written in a serviceable , pedestrian journalistic prose , the bakeries are so beautifully photographed by Guy Bouchet , this book soon had me down on the kitchen floor poring over a large map of Paris , plotting a bread and pastry tour . ( Is it true you can go round-trip for $ 799 ? ) The Parisian boulangers Dannenberg profiles are , she writes , &quot; committed to the concept of old-fashioned handmade breads , pain d ' autrefois . &quot; The patissier , on the other hand , &quot; is an artist who wants his creations to be as individual as he is -- which is the reason there are so many variations on a theme in the pastry shops of Paris. &quot; The book ' s design , by Louise Fili , was not created with the cook in mind : Recipes are run continuously in the text in a typeface that ' s difficult to read . ( Fractions , in particular , are so teeny they ' re almost illegible. ) Best copy_out any recipe you want to try ( and you ' ll also spare the book butter spots ) . Boulangers and patissiers have adapted their recipes for the home cook , though some of these adaptations are approximations and may cause disappointment , especially when it comes_to the bread : All the bread recipes use packaged yeast , whereas the unforgettable flavor of so many Parisian artisanal breads comes from a process of fermentation with starters not familiar to most home cooks . Some of these bakers also overestimate the ambition and abilities of the home cook : I , for one , won ' t ever make patisserie Dalloyau ' s coulibiac de la mer , an elaborate brioche filled with layers of fish_mousse , langoustine , scallops , leeks and brill . Other recipes send one scurrying to the supermarket : Boulanger Bernard Ganachaud submits a recipe that puts stale croissants to lavish use , La Maison du Chocolat provides Le Pleyel , a simple , almost flourless chocolate loaf cake . Easy orange-and-raisin sables from Jean-Luc Poujauran are_well worth a try . Better yet , book a flight to Paris and eat the real_thing . * FRIDA ' S FIESTAS : Recipes and Reminiscences of Life With Frida Kahlo By Guadalupe Rivera and Marie-Pierre Colle ( Clarkson Potter : 1994 ; $ 35 ; 224 pp. ) The other visual knock-out of this season is &quot; Frida ' s Fiestas , &quot; a memoir with recipes written by Kahlo ' s stepdaughter , Guadalupe Rivera , and Marie-Pierre Colle . Photographs by Ignacio Urquiza are one dreamy , colorful feast-scape after another . Archival photographs of Kahlo and Rivera and reproductions of Kahlo ' s paintings are also liberally seeded throughout the book . Guadalupe Rivera describes her stepmother Frida as affectionate , intelligent , and spirited : &quot; Everything about her , from her hairstyle to the hem of her dress , breathed a kind of roguish glee . . . &quot; Kahlo apparently could not pass_up a special occasion . &quot; She celebrated saints ' days , birthdays , baptisms , and most of the popular holidays , both religious and secular . She got everyone involved . . . &quot; Structured around the months of the year , the book has 12 chapters and presents menus for 12 celebratory feasts . Many of these feasts took_place in 1942-3 , the year Guadalupe Rivera lived with her father and stepmother , although the first month in the book , August , commemorates the Rivera-Kahlo marriage in 1929 . Kahlo ' s life may have been an ongoing series of celebrations , but not all_of these celebrations were strictly joyous . When buying a cake for the Epiphany dinner , Kahlo , in &quot; extravagantly ornate Tehuana attire and pre-Hispanic jewelry , &quot; is taunted in a public coffee house . At another dinner , Diego Rivera taunts his daughter ' s suitor . Having heard of her husband ' s affair with a beautiful Hungarian painter , Kahlo &quot; disappears &quot; for a_few days in March to Teotihuacan , where she consults her friend and seer , don Tomas , and eats a Lenten meal ( recipes given ) . At the public Feast of the Holy Cross in May , Kahlo sings a song for all to hear about &quot; the pain and contempt &quot; a wife feels_for her adulterous husband . &quot; Instead of angering Diego Rivera , &quot; the author writes , &quot; the song made him nearly die of laughter. &quot; Recipes are simply written and require a certain basic knowledge and competence with Mexican ingredients . The photographs provide some guidance -- it helps to see what the finished product is supposed to look_like -- but how the almond macaroons , which are dropped_by the tablespoon onto baking sheets in the recipe , end_up inexplicably square in the photograph is a mystery . The Times Test Kitchen had a problem with the otherwise easy Enchiladas Tapatias : the recipe says to puree the chiles with two cups of water and &quot; drain , &quot; but the correct command is to puree the chiles and strain -- otherwise you ' ll end_up with a mound of ground chiles and no sauce at all . * SAVORING THE SEASON OF THE NORTHERN HEARTLAND By Beth Dooley and Lucia Watson ( Alfred Knopf : 1994 ; $ 25 ; 394 pp. ) This latest addition to the handsome Knopf Cooks America Series of heritage cookbooks is by food writer Beth Dooley and chef Lucia Watson , who owns the highly acclaimed Lucia ' s restaurant in Minneapolis . Besides 200 recipes , this fetching and thoughtful book presents amusing historical photographs and graphics , apt literary snippets , cooking tips , and other food lore from the Ojibwa , Chippewas , Italians , Norwegians , Swedes , Germans , Hmong and other settlers in the nation ' s heartland . I went_through &quot; Savoring the Seasons &quot; looking_at all_the photographs the same way I sit_down to read cartoons in the New Yorker -- they ' re that amusing . There ' s an old coot in a visor with a beautiful white turkey on his lap , and the dazed champions of the 1933 Ortonville , Minnesota corn-eating contest . A bespectacled , bobbed woman holds an enormous mushroom like an umbrella over her head , and two men pass a bottle behind a winched-up 95-pound sturgeon ( two more bottles lie empty on the ground ) . Best of all : 72-year-old Arthur Schlegal of Blakely , Minnesota , wearing a pretty apron over his overalls , sifts flour while preparing to compete for the 1952 spice_cake prize at the county fair . Writer Meridel Le Sueur is quoted throughout the book and in such highly edited form , her normally purple prose is actually quite palatable : &quot; I was always surprised , &quot; she writes , &quot; to see my gentle grandmother put her foot on the neck of her favorite hen and behead her with a single stroke of a long-handled ax. &quot; Historical , sociological and / or culinary asides , set_apart graphically in ochre-colored boxes , include two 1925 recipes for lutefisk ( dried , reconstituted cod ) , the history of flour milling , a good tip for skimming scum off soups , and a description of contemporary ice fishing . ( On large open lakes in northern Minnesota , &quot; entire ice-fishing communities are erected , with named streets as well as garbage_collection and delivery services . Some huts have color_TVs , refrigerators , heating units and running water. &quot; ) Recipe notes are also full of curious information : &quot; The woodcock , or ' timberdoodle , ' with its mottled brown-and-black speckled feathers , often escapes hunters simply by staying perfectly still . It also has such keen hearing that it can locate worms by listening to them underground. &quot; Clearly written recipes range from the Italian-inspired porchetta to spaetzle to &quot; Hmong Market Soup. &quot; While I ' d add a bit more spice to the poultry stuffing , a bit more cinnamon to the cinnamon_roll , the basic directions are sound . There are the usual cookbook chapter divisions ( bread , poultry , meat and fish ) as well as other chapters that reflect the region ' s individual character : a chapter each on game and on pickling and preserving . &quot; Come for Coffee &quot; reflects the region ' s passion for coffee klatching ; &quot; The Communal Pot &quot; gives recipes for the regional one-dish dinners often called &quot; hot dishes &quot; which , the authors insist , are not to be confused with those &quot; dinners bound in canned cream soup and topped with potato_chips &quot; associated with other schools of Midwestern cooking . * THE COOKING OF THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN : 215 Healthy , Vibrant and Inspired Recipes By Paula Wolfert ( Harper Collins : 1994 ; $ 30 ; 429 pp. ) Paula Wolfert recently spent five years traveling , eating , cooking and shopping in Slavic Macedonia , Northern Greece , Turkey , the Levant and the Republic of Georgia and this book is the result of that journey -- jam-packed with firsthand experience , lore and invaluable instruction for cooking these regional cuisines . The four appendixes alone ( on pepper pastes , home-prepared spice mixtures , stocking the larder , and yogurts ) amount to a graduate seminar in Middle Eastern kitchen sensibility . Recipe notes provide colorful facts : Black lentil_soup from Gaziantep is made with long , droopy tarragon leaves and therefore called &quot; soup with a mustache. &quot; In Turkey , anchovies are so well loved they are baked in bread and in fig leaves and made into pancakes . In Northern Greece , there ' s a genre of food called &quot; hidden meats &quot; -- dishes devised by Greek guerrillas that are cooked in sealed containers amid embers so no rising smoke could alert enemy Turks to their whereabouts . But the real way to learn about this food is to cook it , and Wolfert ' s 215 recipes are each a course in themselves . She gives clear , undaunting directions for making 11 types of kibbeh , those three-inch long , stuffed footballs she calls &quot; the masterpiece of the Middle Eastern table. &quot; Cooking even a simple dish of okra braised with tomatoes and onions , one learns to soak okra in a vinegar bath ( to avoid stringiness and sliminess ) , to arrange and cook the pods in a pretty spoke-like pattern , and finally the technique Wolfert calls &quot; the flourish &quot; -- adding sizzling oil or butter scented with pepper , dried mint or other spices at the last minute to add a blast of flavor . * This recipe is from Dannenberg ' s &quot; Paris Boulangerie Pa tisserie . &quot; These sables , best made with chopped candied orange_peel , are somewhat subtler and less sweet when made with grated orange_zest .
