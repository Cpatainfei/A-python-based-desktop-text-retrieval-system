   <HEADLINE> APPLE REVEALS PLAN ALLOWING FOR CLONING OF MACINTOSH COMPUTER ; TECHNOLOGY : ANALYSTS DISAGREE ON WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL RECAPTURE MARKET FROM IBM-COMPATIBLES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Apple Computer Inc. , struggling to compete against the Intel-Microsoft juggernaut , on Friday revealed details of its long-discussed plan to license its technology and permit other companies to make clones of the Macintosh personal_computer . But Apple did not say whether any companies had yet signed_on , nor would it disclose what conditions would be attached_to such licenses . The Macintosh clones -- which will be based on the new Power Macintosh design and will sport the licensees ' own labels along with a new blue logo for the latest Mac software operating system -- are not expected to hit the market until the end of next year , according to Don Strickland , the Cupertino , Calif. , company ' s vice_president for licensing . &quot; Using the Mac OS licensing system as a way to build brand awareness , we think we can boost our worldwide market share to as much as 15 % or 16 % over the next three years , &quot; Strickland said . Apple has been scrambling to hold_on to a 10 % share of the $ 80-billion global PC market . Meanwhile , machines containing Intel chips and running Microsoft ' s DOS and Windows operating systems have grabbed more_than 80 % of the market . Allowing others to license Mac hardware and software would expand the base of Macintosh machines and bring some revenue to Apple . But allowing clones carries big risks : Clone makers were decisive in establishing the IBM PC as a standard , but IBM -- which did little to protect its hardware design from license-free copying -- lost out as lower-cost manufacturers simply copied the hardware and licensed the software from Microsoft . Opinion diverged widely Friday on Apple ' s chances of success . The company has been criticized for years for guarding the Mac technology too closely and thus losing the opportunity to establish it as a standard . &quot; It ' s too slow , &quot; said Philippe de Marcillac , director of worldwide PC research at Dataquest in San Jose , referring to the Apple licensing plan . &quot; By being so slow , they are definitely limiting the gains they ' re going to make. &quot; Mark Hall , editor of MacWeek magazine in San Francisco , disagreed . &quot; Now the world knows what it will take_to build a Mac clone . Apple will pick_up decent market share worldwide in two years. &quot; Since introducing the Mac a decade ago , Apple has gained a devoted following among desktop publishers and other computer users for whom ease of use and good graphics were crucial . But for years Apple charged a premium , and the vast majority of users opted for cheaper IBM-compatible PCs -- and the Windows operating system has now eroded Apple ' s ease-of-use advantage . Earlier this year , Apple introduced a new type of Mac based on the Power PC chip , giving the company a chance to revisit the licensing question . But Apple has reportedly failed to cut a deal with IBM -- an ally and co-developer of the Power PC -- and the slow rollout of the licensing plans has disappointed analysts . Apple officials declined to name any prospective licensees Friday , noting that those companies want to control the timing of such announcements . However , trade publications have reported that Apple is close to deals with , among others , Motorola Inc. , Vobis Microcomputer of Germany , Ing . C . Olivetti &amp; Co . of Italy , Toshiba Corp . and Pioneer Electronic Corp . of Japan and Goldstar Technology Inc. of Korea . Strickland indicated that initially Apple expects to manufacture machines for licensees to help jump-start the process . Later , he said , with specifications supplied by Apple , the companies would be able to build their own hardware .</TEXT>
