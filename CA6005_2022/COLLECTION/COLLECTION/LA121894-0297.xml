   <HEADLINE> ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FACE DEPORTATION COSTS IN GERMANY ; EUROPE : OFFICIALS OF STATES INVOLVED SAY FEES ARE JUSTIFIED . RIGHTS WORKERS CALL PAYMENTS ' EXPLOITATION. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An evening in the slammer is no night at the Ritz . But for the $ 64 to $ 84 per night that some German states want to collect from refugees awaiting deportation , it might at least be a Ramada Inn . Forget credit_cards -- many of these deportees have no cash even -- but a good watch , video camera or VCR will do_in some cases in which prison officials have orders to seize valuables from those who cannot pay the jail bill . In the last couple months , several of Germany ' s 16 states have begun charging illegal immigrants for the costs of their deportation , including jail stays . And the &quot; room &quot; rates run high : about $ 84 per night in Baden-Wurttemberg , $ 64 in Bavaria -- and $ 77 in Lower_Saxony , until press reports embarrassed that Social Democratic state_government into canceling the daily charges . The practice , legal under Germany ' s foreigners law and a federal asylum statute passed last year , is still more an exception than the rule . Many states , such_as North Rhine-Westphalia , do not charge , and most refugees cannot pay . Officials in Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg said they actually have collected money or goods in only about 5 % to 10 % of deportation cases . But refugee and human_rights workers are questioning the taking of any money from immigrants , especially those who have lost in the legal asylum process and must make a new start back home . &quot; It is double exploitation , &quot; said Kai Weber of the private Refugees Council in Lower_Saxony . &quot; First they are exploited as cheap workers , and afterward the money they have earned under hard conditions is taken_away from them. &quot; Stefan Teloeken , spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees in Bonn , said international conventions do not cover the issue of charging refugees fees . &quot; Legally , this is possible under German law . The question is whether it is appropriate , &quot; Teloeken said . Officials in states that charge deportees insist it is . &quot; Deportation is the responsibility of the person affected , &quot; said Hesse Interior Ministry spokesman Gerd-Uwe Mende . &quot; They are here illegally and , therefore , they must pay the consequences if they are deported. &quot; That is in principle . In fact , Mende conceded , &quot; I cannot take money from someone who has none. &quot; In the United States , deportations of foreign criminals and illegal immigrants who do not leave voluntarily are the responsibility of the federal_government , which pays_for all costs of detaining and returning them to their countries . The average_cost of detaining an illegal immigrant for deportation from the United States is about $ 39 per day , according to Michael Manuel , a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington . The U.S._government deported 37 # 003 people in 1993 and has deported 38 # 725 so far this year . The budget_for the 1994 deportation program is $ 385 million . Such figures are harder to come_by in Germany . Although asylum and deportations are governed by federal law , the responsibility for support of asylum-seekers and deportations of those who have been denied rests with the state and , in some states , with the community . An asylum study group , Arbeitskreis Asyl , says that 36 # 000 people were deported from Germany in 1993 . The federal Interior Ministry says it has no nationwide deportation figures . Unlike in the United States , people requesting political asylum in Germany receive government assistance in the form of housing , food , clothing and medical_care while awaiting a decision on their cases . The cost is about $ 10 # 000 per person per year for an estimated 1 million to 1.5 million people . In turn , the refugees ' movement is restricted -- they must remain in the county where they are placed -- and the government can find them easily in the event they are denied asylum . If they do not agree to leave voluntarily , or if the government fears they will &quot; disappear , &quot; they are jailed for anywhere from several days to six weeks , then charged and deported . Among the thousands of people awaiting deportation at any one time -- 600 in North Rhine-Westphalia alone -- are Vietnamese , Algerians and citizens of the former Yugoslav federation who have no papers and have difficulty getting any from governments resisting taking_back their refugees . Some of these people may remain in jail for months . Others awaiting deportation include illegal immigrants who got caught by police checking documents or were arrested , and asylum-seekers rounded_up after losing their cases . Bavarian Interior Ministry spokesman Christoph Hillenbrand defended the practice of charging for detention , administration of deportations and flights home , saying that federal law &quot; obliges &quot; states to ask_for payment for repatriation . &quot; Often you can ' t get this money , but sometimes they have luxury goods and sometimes cash . Maybe in 5 % of all cases , you can get a certain sum . Sometimes they ' ll surprise you and have a big Rolex or a_thousand marks ( $ 635 ) or a video player , &quot; Hillenbrand said . What does Bavaria do with the goods ? &quot; We try to sell them . It ' s not Christie ' s , but there are other ways to sell in an auction , &quot; he said . That states had begun charging deportees was virtually unknown until the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reported it in Lower_Saxony last month . Following the story , authorities in Hanover confirmed at a news_conference that they were charging deportees a daily rate and confiscating valuables from those who could not pay . But after the national weekly magazine Focus reported the story , state officials began denying the practice -- even as the state ' s Social Democratic prime_minister , Gerhard Schroeder , announced he would put a stop to it .</TEXT>
