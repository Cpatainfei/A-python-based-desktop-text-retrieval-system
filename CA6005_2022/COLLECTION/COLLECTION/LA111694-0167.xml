   <HEADLINE> STATE OKS COMPROMISE ATTACK ON AIR_POLLUTION ; SMOG : PLAN SUBMITTED TO U.S. CALLS FOR ALTERNATIVE FUELS , ELECTRIC_CARS . BUT AUTO , TRUCKING INDUSTRIES GAIN CONCESSIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Barely meeting a key federal deadline , the state Air Resources Board on Tuesday unanimously adopted a sweeping plan that aims to clean_up California ' s smog with an array of hotly contested strategies that could cost consumers and industries billions of dollars a year . After 25 hours of stormy testimony from business owners and environmentalists , the air board approved a compromise plan that pushes advanced technology in cars and trucks and includes concessions drafted to accommodate the oil , trucking and auto industries . Provisions that will force widespread use of much cleaner alternative fuels and electric vehicles in California after the year 2004 were kept_in the plan as a high priority . As a compromise , though , the board decided that it was too soon to determine how stringent a future standard might be necessary . The new plan also relies heavily on a voluntary strategy drafted by Texaco and the trucking_industry to use public money to buy and scrap thousands of older , polluting cars and diesel trucks beginning in 1996 in the four-county Los Angeles Basin , the state ' s smoggiest region . The cost of buying cars at $ 1 # 000 apiece would be about $ 75 million a year by 1999 . No sources of funds have been determined , but the ARB says the effort might be financed through a $ 7 annual fee tacked onto vehicle registrations or a $ 100 fee on new cars . California ' s new blueprint for battling ozone outlines an ambitious 15-year agenda that is supposed to finally achieve the Los Angeles Basin ' s elusive goal of healthful air in 2010 , the year mandated by Congress . Under federal law , California had until Tuesday to submit a strategy outlining in detail how it would comply with a national health standard for ozone in six regions of the state or face more onerous rules and sanctions from the federal_government . The 11-member air board was under direction from Gov . Pete Wilson to protect the state ' s struggling economy but still meet federal clean air mandates as it wrestled with how to slash ozone -- the pervasive , lung-damaging main ingredient of smog -- by about 75 % . &quot; We must understand what our actions mean to each and every sector of the economy , &quot; said Jacqueline Schafer , chairwoman of the ARB . &quot; We are in competition with other states to ensure that California ' s quality_of_life is the best . That means that in attempting to ensure our environmental future we must be cognizant of the economic mortgage required. &quot; The board decided in a 7-0 vote to strike a compromise over new technology for cars because a proposal by the ARB staff last week prompted outrage from environmentalists and businesses that support alternative fuel technology . But in a concession to the trucking_industry , the ARB made standards forcing alternative fuels in heavy-duty trucks a lower priority , setting no stringent long-term emissions goals . The new plan gives high priority to the proposal to begin scrapping old cars in the Los Angeles Basin at a pace of 6 # 000 vehicles in 1996 , increasing to 75 # 000 a year in 1999 . But local air quality officials fear that the scrap program is too unrealistic and unenforceable to satisfy federal mandates , especially for the Los Angeles region . &quot; We think it ' s the wrong way to go , &quot; said James Lents , executive_officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District , the agency that regulates air_pollution in the Los Angeles Basin . Environmentalists and businesses that back alternative-fuel vehicles criticized the ARB for giving_in to influential industries . They said it is unfair to impose new fees on residents to pay_for scrap programs when most of the burden should remain on industries that produce polluting vehicles and fuels . &quot; The CARB board wimped out on this whole_thing , &quot; said Henry W . Wedaa , Orange County ' s representative on the Air Quality Management District Board and its chairman . &quot; Why should the public pay_for this ? &quot; he said . &quot; Why shouldn ' t the industries creating the problem solve their problem ? This is just another typical scheme to get_out of cleaning_up their emissions . The real story behind the story from my perspective is that nobody wants to use alternative fuels. &quot; Andrew Hirsch , a senior manager at Southern California Gas Co. , said last week ' s draft version made &quot; a mockery of the people like us who have tried to advance this technology so far. &quot; But Tuesday ' s final plan &quot; puts_back some teeth for increased technology , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a good solid compromise. &quot; Auto , trucking and oil executives , however , said the ARB was too optimistic in gauging the extent that alternative fuels and electricity could power cars and trucks in 2005 . The price of alternative-fuel vehicles remains too high and too many technical shortcomings exist to guarantee widespread use , they said . Industry executives contend that a program to scrap old vehicles would cost billions of dollars less and save jobs . &quot; This serves as a model for how employers and the air board can work together to find things that do not cause as much job loss but meet the same air quality goals , &quot; said Allan Zaremberg , senior_vice_president of the California Chamber_of_Commerce . Air board_member Jack Lagarias , who suggested the compromise Tuesday , said the plan &quot; will send a message to ( vehicle and fuel ) manufacturers that advanced technology is still an answer to California ' s air quality problems. &quot; He said it was important to leave open_to debate in the year 2000 how stringent a standard is necessary and reasonable by then . For 25 years , the ARB staff and board have been unwavering in setting tough state mandates that force cleaner fuels and vehicles . But they have been under increasing pressure from Gov . Wilson ' s office in recent months to incorporate less costly alternatives recommended by the oil and trucking_industries . Although eclipsed during much of the debate by the controversy over the vehicle scrapping programs , the new plan contains hundreds of important and aggressive measures regulating pesticides , consumer products ranging from aerosol paint to nail_polish , and businesses from aerospace to auto mechanic shops . It also requires California heavy-duty truck operators to cut diesel exhaust in half by 2002 . The plan is a compilation of measures to be imposed by the ARB and six regional districts , including the AQMD , as well as some national standards for railroads , airlines and other interstate sources under_consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . The state ' s goal is to create an anti-smog program strong enough to replace proposals developed by the EPA that have been criticized by virtually every business and government_agency as onerous and economically disruptive . &quot; California ' s economy has a loaded gun to its head , &quot; Wilson ' s chief economist , Phil Romero , said at the hearing . Romero said the state plan would be 30 % to 80 % less expensive than the federal version . An economic consultant hired by the ARB at Wilson ' s request estimated that the state plan would cost $ 6 billion a year compared to $ 8 billion a year under the federal plan . The ARB ' s plan , however , may_not be specific enough to win the approval of the EPA , which has veto power . David Howekamp , chief of the EPA ' s western regional air division , said it lacks such necessary details as a strategy for funding the scrapping programs . &quot; They would have to address those issues , &quot; Howekamp said . &quot; They have to have enforceable measures for this to be an approvable plan. &quot; The EPA has six months to determine if the plan is complete and a year after that to approve or reject it . Schafer challenged the EPA to act quickly in accepting California ' s plan as a replacement of the federal version and also to adopt some national pollution standards for sources such_as railroads and airlines . &quot; Submitting the ( plan ) today sent the message that California is willing to accept its responsibility no matter how difficult it may be , &quot; Schafer said . &quot; California simply wants the federal_government and EPA to accept the same responsibility. &quot; Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan , a vocal opponent of the federal plan , praised the ARB Tuesday for &quot; including many constructive proposals to achieve clean air and preserve jobs. &quot; The scrapping program is designed only for Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside and San Bernardino counties , but could be expanded later . The air board acknowledged that there is no easy source of funding for buying old cars and new fees are likely to become an explosive issue for Californians . Legislative approval is necessary before the program can begin , and the California Chamber_of_Commerce and oil_industry officials have pledged to the ARB that they will persuade state legislators to pass a funding bill next year . In addition to cars , the plan prescribes the scrapping of 1 # 600 old , high polluting diesel trucks per year in the basin beginning in 1999 . Fewer would be scrapped from 1996 to 1998 . The ARB suggests low-income loans or government subsidies to pay the truckers to replace their old vehicles . Dennis Zane , who directs the Coalition for Clean Air , said trying to buy such large volumes of vehicles is a &quot; bogus , ephemeral notion . . . utterly , utterly absurd . Scrapping does have its place , but we should not see it as a substitute for new technologies. &quot; AQMD officials say they also worry that the attempt to retire so many old vehicles will fail , leaving the Southland unable to meet health standards . &quot; We think they are being overly optimistic , &quot; Lents said . Lents said he doubts that $ 1 # 000 will be enough to persuade motorists to sell their vehicles , which in most cases would be over eight years old . In an experimental program , Chevron and other oil_companies have bought and scrapped 5 # 000 cars since the summer of 1993 , but have started to run_out of willing sellers and have already upped offers to $ 1 # 500 , he said . Ford Motor Co . Executive Engineer Mike Schwarz acknowledged that the public , not the car and oil_industries , would pay_for the scrapping program . But he said that even if auto_makers are forced to produce new technologies , they still would pass the cost to consumers . &quot; The question is how , not whether , California citizens should pay_for the measures in this plan , &quot; Schwarz said . Even with the concessions , some business_leaders say the burden on California companies remains far too high . The plan &quot; will have a dramatic and adverse effect on California ' s economy , &quot; said United Parcel Service executive Ken Churchill .</TEXT>
