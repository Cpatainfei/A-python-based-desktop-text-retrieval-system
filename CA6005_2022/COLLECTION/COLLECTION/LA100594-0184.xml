   <HEADLINE> PLAGUE SCARS IMAGE , ECONOMY OF MODERN INDIA ; ASIA : EPIDEMIC REMINDS TRADE GIANT THAT SOCIAL CHANGE HASN ' T KEPT UP WITH BUSINESS STRIDES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For a country that has come_to see itself as the next global economic superpower and a regional force meriting the same U.N. status as the United States , the images and events of recent weeks have been frightening and humbling . They have served as a reminder that India , one of the emerging giants of international trade and a trove of scientific and business talent , remains a Third_World land of widespread poverty , filth and disease . &quot; I think the events of the past two weeks have certainly done a lot of harm to India , &quot; said R.C. Bhargava , managing director of Maruti , one of India ' s top auto_makers . This autumn ' s outbreak of plague , the &quot; Black_Death &quot; that decimated Europe and Asia centuries ago and hadn ' t been detected in India since the mid-1960s , has seriously hampered trade , transportation and tourism between India and other nations . But the most durable consequence may be to this country ' s view of itself . &quot; The image of India was never so badly tarnished , &quot; said Saeed Naqvi , a columnist who flew home from Britain last week to find India in the throes of plague hysteria . &quot; The country that was to march into the 21st Century with all_the blueprints for technological advance finds itself gripped in a primitive , medieval epidemic . Even the glorious contrasts of India cannot explain away the current tragedy. &quot; Those glum sentiments lingered even as the illness that gave_rise to them appeared to recede . The National Institute of Communicable Diseases reported 5 # 130 suspected plague cases nationwide Tuesday , but Chief Medical_Officer Dr. N.J. Kar said the word &quot; suspected &quot; was misleading because in New Delhi 90 % of the patients admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the disease , such_as high fever , cough and chest_pains , have tested negative . Bubonic plague cases were first reported in the state of Maharashtra , east of Bombay , in August . Pneumonic plague broke out Sept . 19 in the western city of Surat , 160 miles north of Bombay . In the last 48 hours , only one new confirmed death from plague was reported , raising the nationwide death toll to 52 . &quot; We are now on our way to recovery , &quot; Health Secretary M.S. Dayal said this week . Although some parents were furious and thousands of pupils wore cloth masks to class as a health precaution , newly confident New Delhi authorities Tuesday reopened the public_schools they had closed Thursday . The panic that gripped many residents of the capital also seemed to be dissipating , with fewer people covering their faces with handkerchiefs , masks or scarves as they walked along the streets near the bustling business_district of Connaught Place . Dreading the possible spread of the disease to their territories , a long list of countries last week clamped curbs on travel and trade with India . There were glimmers Tuesday that some of those restrictions might soon be lifted , and shipments of Indian commodities to the Persian_Gulf countries , suspended because of the epidemic , were allowed to resume . But from Australia to the West Indies , restrictions on air_travel and trade or stepped-up health monitoring of passengers arriving from India remained in_effect . Among India ' s neighbors , authorities in Bangladesh proclaimed a &quot; high health alert &quot; and offered citizens a tempting incentive to kill rats : a color_television in exchange for 10 # 000 dead rodents , which can carry the fleas that transmit the plague bacillus to humans . Nepal closed a border crossing and hospitalized three nationals who returned from India with possible plague symptoms . In Karachi , Pakistan , five ships arriving from India were placed under quarantine . Indian business sources said fearful Swedish customers had canceled orders for Indian textiles , the country ' s largest earner of foreign_exchange , while all garment orders bound for Germany are supposed to be quarantined and fumigated . Commerce_Secretary Tejendra Khanna predicted that the &quot; panic reaction of some of our trade partners &quot; would result in a 2 % decline this year in India ' s exports , or the equivalent of $ 453 million in lost foreign earnings . India ' s exports posted a 20 % growth_rate last year but were already slowing_down before the epidemic hit . Bombay-based analysts predicted the plague will only reinforce that trend . For some Indian public figures , the resurgence of a disease they had thought vanquished by medical_science and general social progress forced them to contemplate the balance_sheet of economic reforms now in their fourth year . Like many U.S. critics of &quot; supply side &quot; economics , some concluded that the blueprint followed by Prime_Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and Finance_Minister Manmohan Singh falls woefully short of ensuring a better life for all . &quot; The poor have finally taken their revenge against India ' s economic reform process , and in the only way they know -- by dying , &quot; fumed Editor M.J. Akbar of the Asian Age newspaper . &quot; The great contradiction in the whole economics reform program has been the belief that change for the better can take_place in a collapsing environment , that you can have a leap forward in industrial excellence and growth even while there is regression in the quality_of_life all around you. &quot; Although India ' s slow dismantling of its bureaucratized economy has been a boon for tycoons , investors and a middle_class that may be as large as the entire U.S. population , the reappearance of the plague has reminded India and the world that hundreds of millions here still live_in squalid conditions without access to the most rudimentary services such_as clean drinking_water and prompt medical_care . Maruti ' s Bhargava said the epidemic showed that economic and social change must be more uniform , or the reforms will be so shaky they might all come tumbling down . When officials in Surat allowed garbage and rats to accumulate after monsoon downpours struck their heavily industrialized and polluted city , it was enough to cause a health crisis of national and international dimensions , he said . &quot; The lesson is , there ' s no point trying to put_through an economic reform program if you ' re not going_to see that implementation at the grass-roots level of certain functions is carried_out , &quot; Bhargava said . &quot; You can damage everything by some silly thing like one city not cleaning_up after a flood. &quot; As chance would have it , the epidemic was in_full_swing as India was celebrating the anniversary of the birth of Mohandas K . Gandhi , the Mahatma or &quot; Great Soul , &quot; who would have turned 125 , the age he said he wanted to reach , Sunday . That led to deeper soul-searching about where India is headed . On Monday , this country staked its claim in the U.N. General_Assembly for a permanent seat on a reorganized Security_Council . &quot; Given any criteria -- population , size of economy , contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security and peacekeeping , or future economic potential , India qualifies , &quot; Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in New York .</TEXT>
