   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; HIJACKING ONLY CONFIRMS U.S. FEARS ON ALGERIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even before the Christmas_Eve jet hijacking in Algiers , Clinton_Administration officials had identified the rapidly escalating conflict between Algeria ' s military-backed regime and its Islamic opposition as the most serious &quot; new &quot; foreign_policy crisis likely to grab world headlines in 1995 . Algeria ' s regime took power after a January , 1992 , military coup voided elections that seemed certain to lead to an Islamic government . The Administration has tried , without success , to persuade its Western allies -- particularly France , Algeria ' s former colonial power -- to quit propping_up the military-backed regime . The Algerian junta set_off alarm_bells in Washington in October when it decided to abandon attempts at reconciliation in favor of an all-out campaign to eradicate the growing Islamic opposition . The shift marked a critical turning point , U.S. officials say . &quot; Our view is that the Algerian regime cannot win , &quot; said a senior U.S. specialist on Algeria . &quot; Eradication and repression won ' t work . The past three years show that this kind of strategy not only doesn ' t work , it instead further radicalizes the opposition . This will only bring_about exactly the opposite result. &quot; As if on cue , Muslim extremists hijacked the Air France jet Saturday , and it was flown to the_French Mediterranean port of Marseilles early Monday . The hijackers had killed three passengers during the initial standoff in Algiers . French police stormed the plane at dusk Monday in a firefight that left all four terrorists dead and 25 injured among the passengers , crew and police . Only 24 hours before the hijacking , the State_Department had warned Americans to get_out or stay out of the North African_country if they lacked effective means of protecting themselves . &quot; Continuing attacks against foreigners indicate that the level of risk in Algeria has increased , &quot; the State_Department said . &quot; There is a heightened risk of danger to persons traveling overland without adequate security arrangements. &quot; Before the hijacking , more_than 70 foreigners , including two_dozen French citizens , had been killed since Muslim extremists demanded in late 1993 that all foreigners leave the country . And as for the Algerian toll , the government admitted this fall that it had reached 10 # 000 killed . American sources estimate the total at more_than 20 # 000 and rising fast . The military-installed government of President Liamine Zeroual has begun using &quot; totally ruthless tactics , whatever it takes &quot; to eliminate the Islamic Salvation Front , the front-runner in the aborted 1992 elections , and the more militant Armed Islamic Group , another Administration official said . Evidence is growing of indiscriminate executions during military counterinsurgency operations , U.S. officials say . Elite government commandos , long tied to the deaths of many Islamists and civilians , are also more active . Torture and detention without trial are also rampant , according to U.S. officials and human_rights groups . As in previous , more limited counterinsurgency campaigns , the latest crackdown may lead to short-term government gains . But in the long term , U.S. analysts say , the junta may actually become more vulnerable . &quot; Every time the regime has cracked_down , the situation has calmed_down for a_few months , &quot; the U.S. official said . &quot; But it hasn ' t marked a victory . All the Islamic opposition is really doing is laying low . After the offensive is over , they come_back even stronger than they had been with a counteroffensive. &quot; Besides the hijacking , Islamic guerrillas are able to carry_out frequent operations against military targets , including barracks , with impunity , U.S. officials say . As a result , the area outside government control is steadily growing . Although the government holds Algiers , it is challenged even there . Most security_forces do not venture beyond downtown because the Islamists control many of the capital ' s neighborhoods , officials add . In the provinces , the government rules only nominally . After dark , troops retreat into the safety of barracks and the Islamists take_control , leading to public distinctions between the &quot; government of the day &quot; and the &quot; government of the night. &quot; More ominous , the Armed Islamic Group , some of whose forces fought alongside Afghan guerrillas against Soviet troops , has increased grisly attacks on Algerian civilians , intellectuals and journalists , in contrast to the predominantly military targets of other Islamic guerrillas . The hijackers of the Air France jetliner were members of the Armed Islamic Group . Zeroual has pledged presidential elections in 1995 , although U.S. officials do not consider them likely . That promise &quot; comes amid other indications of the growing influence of hard-liners in the military leadership who reject compromise with the opposition , &quot; Robert H . Pelletreau Jr. , assistant secretary_of_state for Near East affairs , said in a speech last month . Many U.S. officials and scholars expect that the &quot; eradicators &quot; in the military will sabotage any genuine effort at reconciliation by Zeroual , who is among those believed to favor a political accommodation . U.S. officials deny French suspicions that Washington is preparing_for a future Islamic regime . &quot; The best hope for a solution which will guarantee Algeria ' s internal peace and prospects , as well as its contribution to long-term regional stability , lies not in a strategy of repression but one of inclusion and reconciliation , ' Pelletreau said . Specialists in the Administration now differ on the timing of a climax to the three-year civil_war between the regime and Islamic guerrillas . Some believe a denouement is likely next year , in part because Algerian society can ' t or won ' t tolerate the soaring number of deaths . Others predict a prolonged period of conflict and chaos , as in Afghanistan , stretching two or three years or longer . Administration officials say even the best case is not good_enough , a key reason for Administration activism . After the 1992 coup , the George_Bush Administration reacted only with a statement &quot; regretting &quot; the suspension of democracy . Among Western allies , the crisis in Africa ' s third-largest country has long been a leading issue in Europe , particularly France . Several governments fear a mass migration across the Mediterranean if an Islamic government is installed . In the first two years of the crisis , France and other Mediterranean countries helped the junta that overthrew reformist President Chadli Bendjedid when the Islamic front was poised to win Algeria ' s first democratic parliamentary elections . And since 1992 , the Mediterranean nations have provided financial_aid , technical expertise and military equipment while encouraging business links . But the leadership role has gradually shifted . &quot; A number of European governments have begun to feel uncomfortable about the explicit French position -- specifically assisting the regime and pushing it toward a harder-line approach , &quot; the Administration source said . Spain is the only European_country that has moved significantly toward the U.S. position , although plans for a gas pipeline from Algeria to Spain are proceeding . Britain and Italy are inching closer , U.S. officials say . The Administration is working to unify positions to prevent the kind of Western dissension that has been so destructive in Bosnia-Herzegovina . &quot; There are no good solutions here , only bad ones , &quot; the U.S. official said . &quot; What we ' re trying to do is avoid the worst one. &quot;</TEXT>
