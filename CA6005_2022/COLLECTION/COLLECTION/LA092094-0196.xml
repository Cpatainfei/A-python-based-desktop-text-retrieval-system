   <HEADLINE> WOMAN IN TORTURE CASE TERMED INSANE ; PROSECUTION : HER LAWYER CONTENDS THAT SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO ACT RATIONALLY AT THE TIME HER NEPHEW WAS ABUSED . HE SAYS SHE INSISTS THAT THE BOY ' S INTERNAL INJURIES RESULTED FROM A ' FREAK ACCIDENT. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Orange woman charged with torturing her 10-year-old nephew was insane when she administered some of the abuse , but insists the internal injuries the child suffered were the result of a &quot; freak accident , &quot; her attorney said Monday . Cynthia Medina , 31 , has lapsed into a deep depression and remains under a suicide watch at the County Jail , where she is being held_in protective custody , said defense_attorney Richard C . Gilbert . Sources said the Medina case has been widely discussed among jail inmates and officials fear for her safety . &quot; She is very , very depressed and her heart is completely filled with sorrow and remorse for everything that has happened , &quot; Gilbert said . &quot; I believe she was insane at the time and she simply snapped and lost the ability to act like a rational human being . Only an insane person could have committed these horrible acts. &quot; Medina is scheduled to be arraigned Sept . 30 in Municipal Court in Santa Ana on four felony charges of child_abuse and one felony charge of torture . Her case is the first in which the state ' s 4-year-old torture law has been used in Orange County . Gilbert said his client may plead not_guilty by reason of insanity . Medina is accused of searing her nephew ' s tongue with hot knives , beating him with an electrical cord and anally penetrating him with a souvenir baseball_bat . The boy ' s internal injuries were so severe that doctors had to perform a colostomy . Prosecutors say the former elementary_school playground supervisor abused the boy over the past year , but administered the most severe assault on Sept . 7 . They say Medina attacked the boy because he was playing with her marijuana_cigarettes . The case has also raised questions about whether a physician acted quickly enough to report suspected abuse after examining the boy on Sept . 8 . Social_workers , investigating the report filed later that day , sought emergency medical treatment for the boy , who remains hospitalized in good_condition . Authorities say the child nearly died of his injuries . Prosecutor Charles J . Middleton declined to comment on Gilbert ' s statements Monday but said he had never seen a defense_attorney &quot; grasp at straws &quot; so early in a case . Gilbert said Monday that his client is being unfairly portrayed by law_enforcement and the media as a monster . He said Medina never intended to harm the child . Medina acknowledges that because the child was in her care , she is ultimately responsible_for his welfare , Gilbert said . But she disputes many of the allegations made by authorities , he said . According to Medina , the boy ' s internal injuries were the result of a freak accident , Gilbert added . &quot; He was being paddled with this miniature bat and he was trying to push her away from him and there was a struggle , &quot; Gilbert said . &quot; They fell and the bat inadvertently , by accident , went_into the child ' s rectum as she was paddling him. &quot; Gilbert said the boy ' s initial report to authorities corroborated this version . Gilbert said he is concerned that &quot; well-meaning people &quot; who are giving the boy gifts in the hospital may be inadvertently causing him to change his story . * Medina also disputes reports that she heated_up knives on a stove top before sticking the red-hot metal to the boy ' s tongue , Gilbert said . According to Gilbert , Medina contends that those burns occurred when the boy grabbed a heated spatula she was using to scrape ice from her freezer and put it in his mouth . The attorney said he plans to challenge the torture law . &quot; I ' m not in any way downplaying the injuries in this case , but there have been other cases involving serious injuries over the last few years and torture was never charged , &quot; he said . &quot; The law is so poorly written that almost any case involving child_abuse can be charged as torture. &quot; Gilbert said he also questions whether public policy may have influenced his client , noting that Assemblyman Mickey Conroy ( R-Orange ) authored an unsuccessful bill this year to require paddling of youths convicted of painting graffiti . &quot; I think when her own public official tells her it ' s appropriate to cane children and you have someone who is susceptible to mental_disease , that ' s how these kinds of events can take_place , &quot; he said . Conroy took offense . &quot; My bill addresses judicial discipline in an open court , &quot; Conroy said in a prepared statement . &quot; This ( Gilbert ' s remarks ) shows to what lengths some attorneys will go_to excuse any action , including torture. &quot;</TEXT>
