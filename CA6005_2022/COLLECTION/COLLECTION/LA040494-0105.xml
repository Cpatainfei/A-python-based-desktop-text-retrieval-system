   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : QUARTERLY STOCK MUTUAL FUND REVIEW ; WHILE OTHER ASIAN MARKETS FALTER , JAPANESE STOCKS HAVE A NEW SURGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Aircraft_carriers and supertankers can ' t turn_on a dime , but stock_markets can , judging from the way Asia-oriented mutual_funds have been behaving lately . Last year , Asian stock_markets outside of Japan were riding a crest of popularity . Prices doubled in Hong Kong , the Philippines , Malaysia and Indonesia , and nearly did so in Thailand , Taiwan and Singapore . Now , those markets are sprouting leaks , having been swamped by a tidal_wave of bad news from the United States and China . Stocks in Hong Kong , Thailand and Malaysia have lost roughly a quarter of their value since the year began . Adding_to the irony is that Japanese stocks , which got left at the dock in last year ' s fourth quarter , have mostly been steaming ahead this year . Though they have faltered the past two weeks , pure-Japan stock mutual_funds still rose 17.3 % , on average , in the first_quarter -- the best performance of any fund category , according to Lipper Analytical Services . Japan ' s stock_market was one of the few beacons during a dismal first_quarter around the globe . By contrast , Pacific region stock funds , some of which have Japanese holdings but many of which are geared to smaller Asian markets , tumbled 11.5 % for the quarter , on average . In part , these turnabouts can be explained by a dose of sanity returning to world financial circles . No investments can keep doubling in price , so stocks in Hong Kong and the other Southeast Asian markets were_due for a period of digestion , if not indigestion . And stocks previously may have dropped too severely in Japan , notwithstanding that country ' s uncommonly weak economy and tumultuous politics . The top-performing Japanese stock fund in the first_quarter , the DFA Japan Small-Company fund , was up 28.44 % , making_it the biggest winner among all stock funds . But that fund had been the worst stock fund of the fourth quarter , when it fell 23.93 % . And over the past four years , of course , Japanese stocks have been in a deep bear_market , and they remain off 50 % from their 1989 peaks . Now , &quot; what you have is a country with low interest_rates in deep recession , with a government that ' s using strong fiscal_policy to move the economy up , &quot; says Walter Frank , chief investment officer for Donoghue ' s Moneyletter newsletter in Ashland , Mass . &quot; that ' s the recipe for a rising economy and stock market. &quot; It also helps that the yen has been rising against the dollar , boosting the value of Japanese stocks from the standpoint of American investors . Between a tax cut and government spending on infrastructure , the Japanese government ' s stimulus package is worth an impressive $ 135 billion , says William Wendler , vice_president of Rowe Price-Fleming International , which manages the international funds of Baltimore-based T . Rowe Price Associates . Although Wendler sees the Japanese market ' s two-year outlook as promising , his firm isn ' t convinced that Japan has emerged from its recession just yet . The T . Rowe Price International Stock Fund has just a 22 % stake in Japan , even though Japanese shares account_for 44 % of the total value of all non-U.S. companies . One dilemma facing investors is whether Japanese stocks , which had risen to excessive levels in the late 1980s , remain overpriced even today . The market ' s price-to-earnings ratio stands around 80 , roughly where it peaked in 1988 . &quot; The key difference is that the world economy was facing a recession back then , while it ' s looking_at a recovery today , &quot; says Wendler . Other valuation measures , such_as dividend yields and the price-book ratio , show the Japanese market to be more reasonably priced , analysts say . At any rate , Frank believes Japan is too important to ignore and recommends that growth-oriented Americans allocate 10 % to 15 % of their stock holdings to the market , including what they might already have in Japan through broadly diversified international funds . The problems facing investors in Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian markets are quite different from those for Japan . These smaller economies have been expanding rapidly in recent years , buoyed by increased trade with China and the West . Yet the danger that Washington may revoke China ' s preferential trading status within the next two months has spooked the Hong Kong market in particular . Such a move would curtail trade and lop 2 % from Hong Kong ' s economic output , estimates Chen Zhao , managing editor of the China Analyst , a newsletter from the Montreal-based Bank Credit Analyst Research Group . Also , rising American interest_rates are being felt in Hong Kong , because the currency of the_British colony is linked to the U.S. dollar . A third concern for investors is the poor health of Deng Xiaoping , China ' s market-reform leader . &quot; If all three of these dangers happen at once , the Hong Kong market will go_down the tubes &quot; despite already steep losses , says Zhao , who calls the next three months critical . Otherwise , Southeast_Asia ' s investment potential remains sound , he says . Singapore , Malaysia and Thailand , among other Pacific economies , are expected to grow at much faster rates than mature Western economies over the next decade . So , for investors owning shares_in Pacific region stock funds -- or wanting to buy -- the key is to view these volatile markets solely as long-term plays . &quot; It doesn ' t do any good to chase_after last_quarter ' s top performers &quot; while bailing_out of the worst funds , warns Neil Burns , a broker and certified financial planner at LPL Financial Services in Mission Viejo . He recommends that growth-oriented investors maintain up_to 12 % of their portfolios in emerging-markets funds , of which Southeast Asian stocks are a core . Wendler , too , is clearly optimistic about the future of the Pacific region . &quot; Near term , the markets will be choppy , but long term this is still our favorite part of the world , &quot; he says . Asian Connections If you already own a broadly diversified international or global mutual_fund , chances are you have some exposure to Japan and the other Pacific Region markets such_as Hong Kong , Malaysia , Singapore and Thailand . The following list shows the degree to which various fund groups are oriented to Asia . Note that the smattering of pure Japanese funds are lumped into the Pacific group .
