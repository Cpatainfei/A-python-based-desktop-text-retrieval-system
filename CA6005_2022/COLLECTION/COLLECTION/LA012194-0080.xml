   <HEADLINE> INAUGURATION_DAY FOR NEW NIXON LEGACY ; POLICY : FORMER PRESIDENT AND TOP DEPUTIES LAUNCH O.C. THINK_TANK TO CONTINUE WORK STARTED 25 YEARS AGO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former President Richard M . Nixon joined a team of national_leaders from a previous generation Thursday to recall the achievements of their White_House tenure and to launch a new policy research_center that they hope will continue the work they started 25 years ago . In a garden ceremony held between the presidential library and the tiny white clapboard house where Nixon was born , Cabinet members and officers who served in the White_House described the former President as a skillful tactician who shepherded the nation through difficult times and now holds a place as a revered statesman . The speeches , including three from former secretaries_of_state and another by ex-President Gerald R . Ford , portrayed the rehabilitation of the only President to resign from office as all but complete and promised a legacy that will be shaped more by achievements than by his role in Watergate . They said the Center for Peace and Freedom , a new think_tank to be headquartered at the library , will preserve Nixon ' s place in history as a key player in shaping world events as well as add another voice to the debate over contemporary political issues . Nixon , appearing healthy and relaxed during a speech he sprinkled with humor , also reflected on the highs and lows of a public career he began in 1947 . &quot; Was it worth it ? &quot; he said . &quot; Politics is never going_to be heaven , and sometimes it ' s hell . But it was worth the trip. &quot; Even the presence of a small but loud group of protesters , another part of the Nixon legacy , was turned_into a joke . &quot; I hope you haven ' t been distressed by some of that background_noise that we ' ve had here , &quot; he said . &quot; I remind our young people out there that I ' ve been heckled by experts. &quot; * Nixon , who celebrated his 81st birthday earlier this month , told the audience of about 1 # 000 invited guests that he &quot; is not a fan of think tanks. &quot; But he promised that the Center for Peace and Freedom would have a unique mission . The $ 25-million center is scheduled to open later this year with an office in Washington . Organizers hope to move_into a permanent headquarters in a new building at the library by 1997 . George L . Argyros , a Newport Beach developer and chairman of the fund-raising_effort dubbed &quot; Legacy of Peace , &quot; said , &quot; The center ' s goal is to ensure not only that President Nixon ' s legacy is remembered . . . but that his uniquely practical approach to the vast complexities of foreign and domestic policy continues to be applied in the uncertain new_world we face in the wake of the Cold War. &quot; While officials stressed that the center will be innovative , activist and fundamentally different from other think_tanks , the specifics of how those goals would be accomplished remained hazy Thursday . Also unclear was how active a role the former President is likely to play in guiding its programs and studies . The center ' s president and its board chair are expected to be named by June , with announcements about its staffing , funding and building design to follow , officials said . A former Nixon secretary_of_state , Henry A . Kissinger , said he would serve as an unsalaried member of the center ' s board . At a news_conference after the ceremony , Kissinger said the center will be distinct because of its focus_on &quot; middle-term problems &quot; -- as opposed to short- or long-range issues . He said only government can respond quickly enough for short-term problems and traditional think_tanks usually address long-term political issues . &quot; Our purpose is to create a place where men of ideas and men_of_action can interact on middle-term problems , &quot; Kissinger said . &quot; How exactly that is going_to be done , I cannot pretend we know exactly. &quot; Kissinger said examples of middle-term problems include the evolving relationships in Eastern Europe , the Middle_East and South_Africa as well as the emerging roles of Japan and China . Literature for the center said its priority &quot; will be to have an impact on the policy-making process rather than to establish long-term niches for experts or scholars. &quot; The center plans to establish eight endowed chairs , six focusing_on foreign affairs in the Middle_East , Europe , Japan and Russia . Two others would research domestic issues . Thursday was also the 25th anniversary of Nixon ' s first inaugural as President . As a result , much of the commentary was nostalgic . At times it almost seemed like a celebrity roast as former Cabinet members looked_at Nixon seated in the front row and recalled some of the most important and difficult decisions they shared_in the White_House . * Afterward , Nixon gave a detailed and optimistic speech about the world ' s future . He shed the podium used for written text that other speakers had used and talked without notes while he clasped his hands behind his back . He made several bold predictions , suggesting that the threat of global nuclear war is over and that television ' s saturation of the planet has made_it impossible for dictators to retain power . &quot; We have had enormous technological progress , &quot; he said . In the next century , &quot; freedom , political freedom , will be the rule rather than the exception because the communications revolution has had the effect of making dictatorships unviable . They cannot stand having their closed societies open up. &quot; Nixon was enthusiastic about the rapidly changing new_world , cautioning that there are still difficult challenges ahead , but also offering a promising outlook for opportunities that politics made unthinkable during his era . Nixon almost scolded young people who say this is a hard period in which to grow_up . On the contrary , he said , it is the best . &quot; As we approach a day , the day of a new millennium , I would say you could not possibly think_of a day in which one would be more fortunate than to live_in the United States of America and on this day , at this time , &quot; he said . &quot; The reason for that is . . . what can be achieved in the future. &quot; Since he resigned from office nearly 20 years ago , Nixon has been one of the country ' s most active ex-Presidents . He has authored nine books and is nearly finished with a 10th . He still travels the globe , talking to foreign leaders , and he writes periodic newspaper_columns . The memory of the Watergate scandal that forced Nixon from office and still deprives his library of the presidential papers provided to other former chief_executives will be diminished , if not forgotten , his supporters said . They point to the attention given to his commentary as proof that he will be remembered as a capable and vital national_leader . &quot; I have said publicly , and I have written it , that President Nixon was punished beyond the cause , &quot; Kissinger said . &quot; There were big mistakes made , which he himself has admitted . I believe Watergate will be an insignificant aspect of the Nixon legacy . I believe that President Nixon will go_down as one of our eminent Presidents. &quot; * Among the invited guests , including many elected leaders and contributors to the library , there were some mixed feelings about the Nixon legacy . &quot; He is an excellent diplomat ; he ended the Vietnam_War . that ' s what he ' ll always be remembered for -- right after Watergate , &quot; said Steve Drasil , an associate member of the Nixon library . &quot; that ' s something , unfortunately , that will always be in the forefront. &quot; P Among those who worked in his White_House , however , the memories were fond and powerful . They took credit for shaping major national policy and establishing the conditions that led to the end of the Cold_War . &quot; America did not win by default , as some misguided revisionist historians of the Cold_War are already claiming , &quot; Ford said . &quot; We resolved to win in this country with sound military and diplomatic policies over a period of four decades . Throughout that era . . . Americans were inspired and led by Richard Nixon . . . . His resolve was to win and the net result was America succeeded. &quot; Times staff writers Lily Dizon , Matt Lait , Gebe Martinez and Rebecca Trounson contributed to this report .</TEXT>
