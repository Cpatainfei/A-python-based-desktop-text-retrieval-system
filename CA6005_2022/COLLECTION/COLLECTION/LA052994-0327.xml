   <TEXT> A U.N. team left North_Korea on Saturday after the Communist state rejected proposals for monitoring the refueling of a nuclear_reactor , heightening prospects that the U.N. Security_Council will take_up punitive sanctions . North_Korea ' s official news_agency said , however , that there were no plans to stop unloading spent fuel from the reactor at the Yongbyon nuclear complex . &quot; It is utterly nonsensical to tell us to suspend the refueling of the reactor , &quot; the Korean Central News_Agency , monitored in Tokyo , quoted a North_Korean analyst as saying . The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency told the Security_Council in a letter Friday that North_Korea was removing fuel rods so fast that the agency could &quot; within days &quot; lose its ability to measure the plutonium produced there . North_Korea has been suspected of converting plutonium from the research reactor into weapons-grade materials for nuclear arms . The North claims its nuclear program is peaceful , but for more_than a year it has evaded demands for full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency . In a statement Saturday from its headquarters in Vienna , the IAEA said team members had left Pyongyang after failing to win an agreement . Two inspectors will remain in North_Korea to monitor any further developments , it said . In Seoul , President Kim Young Sam was quoted as saying it is highly likely that the Security_Council will now consider imposing sanctions and that even China , North_Korea ' s closest ally , would probably support such an action . &quot; Then the situation on the Korean_Peninsula will grow extremely tense , &quot; the opposition party quoted him as telling an opposition leader Saturday . Kim ' s office , contacted later , refused to discuss the remarks . Security_Council members met Friday night to discuss the letter from IAEA Director General Hans Blix . More talks were scheduled at the United Nations for Tuesday . Some U.S. officials believe North_Korea already has one or two nuclear bombs , possibly made with plutonium acquired from a 1989 change of fuel rods . North_Korea claims it removed only a small number of fuel rods that year -- too few to make nuclear bombs -- but the IAEA says it has reason to suspect the North has more plutonium than that . Physical analysis of certain rods in the reactor ' s core would enable the IAEA to establish their age , thereby revealing how many were withdrawn in 1989 . The fuel rods currently being removed from the reactor are said to contain enough plutonium for several bombs .</TEXT>
