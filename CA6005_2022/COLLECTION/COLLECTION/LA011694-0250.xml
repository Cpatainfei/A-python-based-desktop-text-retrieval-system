   <HEADLINE> GRAMMY WINNER HARRY NILSSON DIES ; MUSIC : SINGER-SONGWRITER , 52 , APPARENTLY SUFFERED A HEART_ATTACK . HIS ' EVERYBODY ' S TALKIN ' IN ' MIDNIGHT COWBOY ' WAS A HIT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson , who gained fame with his rendition of the hit &quot; Everybody ' s Talkin ' &quot; in the 1969 movie &quot; Midnight Cowboy &quot; and whose quirky tunes such_as &quot; Me and My Arrow &quot; endeared him to the Beatles , died of an apparent heart_attack early Saturday . He was 52 . Nilsson , who had never fully recovered from a heart_attack he suffered in February , died in his sleep at his Agoura Hills home , said David Spero , his manager . Spero said Nilsson , who recorded his last album in 1979 , had just completed work Wednesday night on a new record tentatively titled &quot; Harry ' s Got a Brown New Robe. &quot; &quot; The last time I talked to him was Thursday , &quot; Spero said . &quot; He sounded great . He was very up and excited about the new songs he had finished. &quot; Nilsson , born Harry Edward Nelson III in Brooklyn , N.Y. , in 1941 , stood at the center stage of pop_music in the early 1970s . A millionaire before he was 30 , Nilsson grew rich writing hits such_as Three Dog Night ' s &quot; One &quot; and singing two Grammy-winning numbers -- &quot; Without You &quot; and &quot; Everybody ' s Talkin ' , &quot; the song that made him a major star when it was featured in the Oscar-winning film &quot; Midnight Cowboy. &quot; His hit &quot; I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City &quot; followed soon after . In 1971 , his animated movie &quot; The Point , &quot; a musical fantasy about a boy and his dog that included the top-40 song &quot; Me and My Arrow , &quot; was a prime-time triumph when it premiered on ABC and went_on to earn two film festival awards . That same year , Nilsson released his platinum-selling album &quot; Nilsson Schmilsson , &quot; which included the hit &quot; Without You &quot; and &quot; Coconut. &quot; The next year he came_out with the album &quot; Son of Schmilsson. &quot; Nilsson ' s eclectic style and whimsical songwriting won him the attention of the Beatles , with whom he became friends . In a 1988 interview with The Times , he recalled the time he and John Lennon dropped_in unannounced before a stunned RCA executive who was considering rejecting the $ 5-million contract Nilsson wanted . &quot; John said : ' You ' ve only had two ( expletive ) artists in the history of your label -- Elvis and Harry . Pay him the two bucks , ' &quot; said Nilsson , who credited Lennon with helping him to eventually get the contract . Since the late 1970s , Nilsson ' s career had been_on the slide . Although he continued to dabble_in music , Nilsson , whom rock critic Ken Tucker once described as &quot; almost proudly lazy , &quot; stopped making records and never toured . Nilsson was a heavy drinker and smoker , and his health began to decline as he put_on more weight . Nilsson ' s creative interests were revived in 1991 when the Performing Arts Conservatory produced a stage version of &quot; The Point &quot; at the Chapel Court Theatre in Hollywood . &quot; To fatten_up the score a bit , &quot; Nilsson contributed a couple new songs for the play , which received generally good reviews . Over the years , Nilsson also wrote and performed music for the movie &quot; Popeye , &quot; starring Robin Williams , and the Terry Gilliam film &quot; The Fisher King. &quot; Spero said Nilsson had given_up drinking and had recently gotten_together with former Beatle Ringo Starr to make a video , &quot; Rockers Against Drunk Driving , &quot; which will premiere on the American Music Awards on Feb . 7 . On the video , the two sing the Beatles ' song &quot; Baby , You Can Drive My Car. &quot; &quot; They were best_friends , &quot; Spero said . &quot; I talked to Ringo ' s wife , Barbara , this morning . She said he took it very hard. &quot; In addition to working_on his record , Spero said , Nilsson had been busy writing a book about his life and was looking_forward to RCA releasing a boxed set of his music in April . Nilsson is survived by his wife of 20 years , Oona , and their six children .</TEXT>
