   <HEADLINE> MANY ADULTS LAG IN READING , MATH ; LITERACY : STUDY FINDS 50 % OF STATE ' S GROWN-UPS DO NOT HAVE SKILLS TO KEEP_UP WITH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES . FIGURES ARE WORST IN THE WEST BUT MIRROR U.S. AS WHOLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About half of California ' s adults cannot read or perform math well enough to keep_up with today ' s technologically changing world , and those with the poorest literacy skills include a disproportionate number of immigrants , for many of whom English is a second language , according to an unreleased U.S. Department_of_Education study . The study , titled &quot; Adult Literacy in California , &quot; was requested by state officials as a follow-up to an ambitious national project that estimated how well the country ' s 191 million adults performed a range of literacy tasks , ranging from signing their names on bank_deposit slips to synthesizing information from long reading passages . In September , the Department_of_Education announced that nearly 50 % of American adults were &quot; at risk &quot; because they could perform only the simplest of tasks , a dismal performance that educational officials said served as a &quot; wake-up call &quot; to an epidemic of illiteracy and signified a widening society &quot; fault_line &quot; between winners and losers in the Information Age . The California numbers were worse than in other western states but mirrored literacy rates for the nation as_a_whole , according to the new report . Compared to the national rates , however , California showed a slightly greater gulf between the literacy haves and have-nots , with more registering at both the top and bottom of the scale . &quot; That means you have more people doing better than the nation and more people doing worse , &quot; said Andrew Kolstad , project director for the literacy studies with the National Center for Education Statistics , a division of the Department_of_Education . &quot; What you tend to find is you get a lot of immigrants , a lot of people scoring at the bottom , &quot; said Kolstad . &quot; Yet California has a very good and advanced post-secondary schooling system , so as people . . . get_through the system &quot; they score higher . California officials have yet to officially release results from the follow-up report , although federal_officials said they sent copies to state administrators in May . Gary Strong , the state librarian , agreed to release an executive summary of the report after California Literacy Inc. , a literacy group , leaked the results in a newsletter published last week . Strong , who chairs the state Literacy Coordinating Council -- a six-agency consortium that distributes literacy funds and ordered the study -- said the group has not officially released the study because member agencies still need time to draft their press statements explaining the findings . Council_members include officials from the state_Department of Education , state library system , community_colleges chancellor ' s office , employment department , California Conservation Corps and the governor ' s office . But Juanita Stanley , the nonprofit group ' s executive_director , said she and other literacy advocates were upset about the delay . The findings are &quot; nothing I didn ' t expect , but it ' s nice to say we have a problem here , &quot; said Stanley , whose group oversees a grass-roots network of 13 # 000 volunteer tutors throughout the state . &quot; A quarter of the adults in this state can ' t participate , they can ' t vote , they can ' t read the newspaper , they can ' t hold onto a job , they can ' t take_care of their kids properly because they can ' t read. &quot; California was one of 12 states that paid $ 345 # 000 for federal_officials to perform a follow-up study . Officials randomly tested 2 # 665 California adults , who represented the 22.8 million people 16 years old and older . The study rated participants on scales ranging from 1 to 500 in three levels of proficiency -- prose , document reading and math . Results were tallied on five levels of competency . Those who scored in the bottom two levels were considered at risk because they could do no more_than understand appliance warranties or calculate postage . Both the national and state studies intentionally avoided labeling anyone functionally_illiterate . While 23 % of the nation ' s adults registered in the bottom level for reading documents , the follow-up study showed that 26 % of Californians were either illiterate or able to perform the barest of functions . Of those at the bottom level of the literacy results in California , 59 % were foreign-born and 41 % were native-born residents , the report says . Those results were disproportionate to the percentages in the adult population as_a_whole , with immigrants comprising 24 % and natives 76 % , the report said . Stanley and other literacy advocates , however , stressed that the poor showing by immigrants was not an indication of intelligence but was attributable to the difficulties of taking the test in English . The special report said that 29 % of those who took the test said they grew_up speaking another language , and those who reported having limited English skills scored from 129 to 165 points lower than those who write or speak English well . The report found that those who scored at the lowest literacy rung came disproportionately from three groups -- adults who did not finish high_school , the elderly and the poor or those who worked in &quot; labor , assembly , fishing or farming jobs. &quot; On the top end , 5 % of California adults performed the most sophisticated quantitative exercises , compared to 4 % nationwide . Other results : * California men and women scored the same on reading , but men scored higher on quantitative sections . * 27 % of the state ' s adults say they watch four or more hours of television a day , while 23 % said they spent an hour or less in front of the set . Those who watched less television had higher literacy scores , the report said . * Those who voted , used libraries and read regularly scored higher on the test .</TEXT>
