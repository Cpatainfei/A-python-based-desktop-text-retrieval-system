   <HEADLINE> A MILESTONE FOR CANINE CATCHERS ; PUBLICITY HOUND CELEBRATES THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF FRISBEE STUNT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even a promoter as adept as Irv Lander could not have staged what he witnessed at Dodger Stadium on the evening of Aug . 5 , 1974 . Before the baseball crowd -- and a national television audience -- Alex Stein and his dog , Ashley Whippet , dashed onto the field and into a well-choreographed routine of long , hovering throws and running , leaping catches of a plastic flying disc . The crowd roared . Slack-jawed security_guards watched for eight minutes before ending the unauthorized performance . NBC broadcaster Joe Garagiola , speaking_for millions of home viewers , exclaimed that he had never seen anything like it . Lander , a self-employed Van Nuys advertising agent with a history of promoting kooky contests , wasn ' t about to let what he had witnessed slip from his grasp . He trailed after Stein , bailed him out of jail and paid his $ 250 fine . &quot; I was dazzled by the dog , &quot; Lander recalled recently . &quot; He could run 35 m.p.h. and catch a Frisbee in his jaws . I immediately had a vision for it. &quot; Two decades of promotions and publicity stunts later , &quot; canine Frisbee , &quot; as the sport is officially known , is celebrating a milestone . And Lander , founder and executive_director of the Canine Frisbee Disc Championships , remains top_dog of the far-fetched pastime that has a niche in pop culture . The 20th world championships will take_place Saturday on the grounds of the Washington Monument in the nation ' s capital . Six months of community and regional competitions involving more_than 5 # 000 dogs will culminate with 14 finalists vying for the Lander Cup , the trophy named after . . . Irv Lander . The winners also receive a $ 1 # 000 savings bond and a year ' s supply of dog_food . More_than 10 # 000 spectators attended last year ' s event at the same venue . In previous years , Lander , who still_lives in Van Nuys , has held his &quot; world championships &quot; at the Rose Bowl , Walt Disney World in Orlando , Fla. , the Astrodome in Houston , RFK Stadium in Washington and Wrigley Field in Chicago . Ever the publicity hound , Lander spends time between competitions coordinating exhibitions and soliciting the participation of celebrities , sports figures , politicians -- anyone whose persona might promote canine Frisbee . In 1976 , he presented organizers of the Democratic National Convention with 1 # 000 Frisbees , each emblazoned with the names of Jimmy_Carter and Walter Mondale . A year later , he and Alex Stein were guests at the White_House , where Ashley Whippet retrieved Frisbees thrown by Amy Carter and posed for photographs with Grits , the nation ' s First Dog . Lander corresponded with former National Football_League Commissioner Pete Rozelle for more_than a year before the league finally agreed to sponsor a halftime exhibition at Super Bowl XII in 1978 . &quot; I always reach for the sky , &quot; said Lander , who declined to reveal his age beyond saying he is a senior_citizen . &quot; I ' m not , by nature , a very pushy person or an extrovert . But I ' m very persevering. &quot; &quot; Without Irv , there would be no ( canine Frisbee ) . It ' s as simple as that , &quot; said Peter Bloeme , the 1984 world champion , who now serves as an organizer and judge . Publicity was Lander ' s long_suit before he met Stein . For years , he had served as a consultant to toy manufacturers , organizing and promoting contests involving everything from Hula-Hoops to yo-yos . As a consultant to Wham-O , Lander served as executive_director of the International Frisbee Assn. , which sanctioned competition between people but had never considered canines -- until Stein and his dog_did their thing . Within a year , Lander had secured sponsorship from major pet_food companies and , with Stein , developed the sport ' s rules and staged its first competition : the Ashley Whippet Invitational . Ashley Whippet went_on to win three world championships before dying in 1985 , at age 13 . Over the years , the game of fling and fetch has become more_than a contest in which daring young dogs &quot; fly through the air with the greatest of fleas , &quot; as Lander likes to say . After Ashley Whippet ' s demise , Sports Illustrated eulogized the first Frisbee dog as an American sports legend , &quot; both a Naismith ( basketball ' s inventor ) and a ( Babe ) Ruth. &quot; A bevy of books and instructional videocassettes were released by Frisbee-dog competitors , espousing the fundamentals of training . Almost overnight , dog owners across the nation began to shun the stick_in favor of the Frisbee . These days , Lander leaves the contest judging to others . Although he used to spend as much as six months a year roving the country , he attended only three of seven regional finals this year . Still , Lander is ever watchful for the opportunity to capitalize . He plans to schedule the stunt at a San Fernando Valley park within the next month , with Wham-O officials and -- he hopes -- media representatives as witnesses . He owns the hound whose skills will be tested that day : Cheyenne Ashley Whippet , grand-dog of the late , great one . &quot; He can run fast and leap high , &quot; Lander said . &quot; He ' s a lot like Ashley. &quot;</TEXT>
