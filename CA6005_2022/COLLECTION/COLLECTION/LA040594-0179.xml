   <HEADLINE> 4 PLEAD GUILTY TO MAKING FALSE FEMA CLAIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first fraud convictions related to the hundreds of millions of dollars being doled_out for earthquake relief , four people have agreed to plead guilty to falsely claiming to have lived_in the Northridge apartment_building in which 16 people died , authorities said Monday . All sought aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency by telephoning an assistance line and giving their address as the Northridge Meadows apartment_building on Reseda Boulevard , where the stunning failure of the first_floor caused the greatest concentration of casualties from the Jan . 17 earthquake , prosecutors said . Pleading guilty in U.S. District Court to a single count of making a false claim to a government_agency were Daniel Richards , 42 , of Hollywood ; Denise Jones , 35 , of Carson , and Miguel Cordero , 34 , of Van Nuys . Mary Mitchell , 27 , of Paramount has agreed to enter a guilty plea on Wednesday . The four cases represent the first fraud prosecutions arising out of the half-million applications for assistance related to the quake , but officials said that as_many as 10 additional arrests are expected later this week or early next week by a multi-agency anti-fraud task_force . FEMA has sent_out checks for more_than $ 600 million to cover temporary housing costs and minor repairs . In light of the prosecutions , U.S. Atty . Nora M . Manella urged anyone who has filed false aid claims to &quot; take_stock of their situation and consider withdrawing their claims or returning the money they have improperly received. &quot; Soon after the quake , FEMA sent checks for as much as $ 3 # 400 to people in heavily damaged areas of the city prior to sending inspectors to verify the damage . Some of those checks have been returned but others received by people who were not eligible have yet to be recovered , the U.S. Attorney ' s office said . FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan said some fraud occurs in every disaster and that the agency tries , through computer checks and inspections , to pursue those who should not have received money . &quot; Generally , it ' s a very small percentage and . . . most of the assistance goes_to people who need it , &quot; he said . Federal_officials got a lucky break that led to the first four arrests when an alert mail_carrier noticed that checks were arriving addressed to people with unfamiliar names . He contacted his supervisor and the anti-fraud task_force became involved . Officials said Cordero claimed in his FEMA application that he lived_in the apartment where mechanic Pil Soon Lee and his 14-year-old son were crushed to death . Richards said he lived_in an apartment where a 52-year-old man died . Cordero , Jones and Mitchell each received $ 2 # 300 checks . Richards did not receive money but repeated the claim that he had lived at Northridge Meadows when contacted by investigating agents posing as relief workers . Deputy Federal Public_Defender Anthony Eaglin , who represented Cordero , confirmed that his client had pleaded guilty but declined further comment . Cordero , who remains jailed in lieu of $ 15 # 000 bail , will be sentenced May 16 by U.S. District Judge Harry Hupp . Richards , who is in custody , is to be sentenced May 2 . Sentencing for Jones , who is free on bond , is set for June 27 . Each faces a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment , a $ 250 # 000 fine and three years probation .</TEXT>
