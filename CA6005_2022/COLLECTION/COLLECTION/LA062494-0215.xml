   <HEADLINE> STUDY FINDS NO SINGLE CAUSE FOR GULF WAR AILMENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Pentagon-commissioned panel that undertook the most exhaustive study to date of illnesses plaguing Persian_Gulf_War veterans uncovered no single cause for their ailments . The panel , led by Nobel-laureate Joshua Lederberg , found no conclusive evidence that Iraqi forces deployed toxic agents on the battlefield or that bombing of Iraqi storage facilities by allied forces released biological or chemical_agents into the air that affected U.S. troops . &quot; We could find no persuasive evidence of the use of chemicals in that theater , &quot; Lederberg said at a news_conference Thursday . But the Pentagon has established a toll-free number for veterans who believe they are suffering ailments as a result of their military_service and launched a program to diagnose the ailments . Deputy Defense_Secretary John M . Deutch said he believes &quot; there are servicemen and -women who are ill as a result of this Gulf War experience . . . . Responding compassionately and effectively are our principal priority. &quot; He said the Pentagon will declassify previously secret intelligence reports and medical documents dealing with possible use of chemical_agents , but acknowledged the information would have little bearing on the illness veterans and physicians have come_to call &quot; Gulf War Syndrome. &quot; Chest_pain , dizziness and skin irritation are among the symptoms reported . The Pentagon has come under_fire from veterans and lawmakers who have charged the military has been ignoring evidence that U.S. troops were exposed to chemical or biological contaminants . The study , conducted by the Defense Science Board Task_Force on Persian_Gulf_War Health Effects , is the latest in a string of inconclusive scientific investigations . Panel scientists said the syndrome may be a group of diseases caused by wartime stress , inhaling fine Kuwaiti sand or alcohol deprivation , among other causes . Some lawmakers privately dismissed the report Thursday , saying that the panel only examined evidence provided by the Pentagon .</TEXT>
