   <HEADLINE> MISSION VIEJO MAY GET_OUT OF LIBRARY SYSTEM ; POLITICS : CITY OFFICIALS SAY ITS FACILITY IS SOUTHLAND ' S WORST . THEY WANT COUNTY TO EITHER BUILD A NEW ONE OR HAND_OVER FUNDS COLLECTED FROM CITY TAXPAYERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> City officials say this planned community might become the first city to secede from the Orange County library system now that a new report confirms what many residents have been saying for years : that the local branch library is the worst in Southern California . The report also states that at least $ 4.5 million in tax_revenue from Mission Viejo residents has been spent to support other county libraries , a contention that is disputed by county officials . &quot; There are a whole generation of children in Mission Viejo who are growing_up without a decent library , and we can ' t permit that to happen , &quot; City Councilman Robert D . Breton said . The City_Council has called a special meeting for Wednesday to discuss the possibility of separating Mission Viejo ' s library from the 27-branch county library system , which has cut_back operating hours countywide because of budget troubles in recent months . No one , including county officials , disputes that the Mission Viejo branch library is woefully undersized . Built_in 1972 when the community had a population of 15 # 000 , the 9 # 155-square-foot building now serves 82 # 000 Mission Viejo residents and another 24 # 000 in Laguna Hills , Aliso Viejo and Leisure World . County officials say they are willing to sell the current building and contribute the proceeds -- about $ 1 million -- to building a new branch library . But efforts to start the library project have bogged down over the county officials ' contention that they won ' t be solely responsible_for constructing libraries in incorporated cities . A city-commissioned library report released Friday showed that most of the Mission Viejo library ' s problems relate directly to lack of space . The report found that : * Only 49 programs for children were held last year , none for adults . The average for a library in a community the size of Mission Viejo is 317 programs for adults and children . * The state standard for libraries is one-half square_foot per community resident . The county ' s benchmark is two-tenths of a square_foot . In Mission Viejo , the library is about half the county standard . * The branch has only 34 parking_spaces , including staff parking . Patrons often park several hundred feet down the street or circle the building , waiting for someone to leave . * The 22-year-old building is not fitted for new technology that many libraries now have . &quot; It cannot accommodate modern technology , &quot; said Barbara Pearson , the head librarian in El Segundo who compiled the report . And too often , city officials say , books gather dust in storage_areas because there is no more room on the shelves . After Pearson gave a verbal preview of the report last week , Councilwoman Sharon Cody turned_to the consultant and asked : &quot; In your opinion , is this the worst library in the Southland ? &quot; Pearson replied , &quot; Yes. &quot; Even before incorporating in 1988 , Mission Viejo has pressed the county to build a new library . The city has spent $ 2.5 million to buy land for a library and commissioned drawings for a 25 # 000-square-foot building at La Paz Road and Marguerite Parkway that will cost an estimated $ 5 million . However , a Mission Viejo ballot proposal to sell bonds to pay_for the building was rejected by residents in 1992 . Although 56 % of voters approved the measure , the initiative needed a two-thirds vote to pass . County officials have agreed to sell the current library building on Chrisanta Road and apply the money to the project . But hit with a 34 % cut_in state revenue last year , the embattled county library system doesn ' t have enough money to be responsible_for building libraries in incorporated communities , library officials say . &quot; The county has been willing for some time to participate in the building of a library &quot; in Mission Viejo , County Librarian John Adams said Friday . &quot; However , the city is under the perception that the county has an obligation to building a library in an incorporated community . That has not been our policy. &quot; But city officials say the report shows residents have already paid_for another library . A supplemental report compiled by city staff shows that Mission Viejo taxpayers have contributed $ 4.5 million to a special county fund since 1988 . The county &quot; has been using Mission Viejo taxpayers ' money to subsidize their other libraries , &quot; said Councilman Breton , who also sits on the city library committee . &quot; We do believe they have an obligation to build a new library. &quot; However , Adams said the special fund also is used for flood_control and fire service . In recent years , the County Board of Supervisors has channeled the money into the County Fire_Department . &quot; that ' s how the supervisors have prioritized the special district funds , &quot; Adams said . Whether Mission Viejo secedes from the library system depends_on whether county officials can be convinced to turn_over Mission Viejo tax_revenue to the city , city officials said . Taxpayers in cities that don ' t run their own libraries pay into a library district administered by the county . Property_owners also were taxed for the special fund until July , when the fund was eliminated by the state . City officials say they might be able to legally gain control of the portion of library district funds paid by Mission Viejo taxpayers , but admit that it ' s a gray legal area . The city and county also differ on the costs of running the Mission Viejo branch . According to Adams , Mission Viejo taxpayers paid about $ 800 # 000 into the library system during the 1992-93 budget year , while operating_costs for the local branch ran just over $ 1 million . However , city figures received from the county accounting office show that about $ 980 # 000 was paid into the library district by Mission Viejo taxpayers during that period . The consultant estimated the branch could be run_for $ 837 # 000 annually . Four Mission Viejo council_members have said they favor taking_over the branch , but not without tax_revenue to pay operating_costs . &quot; We ' d have to be very cautious about taking_over the library , &quot; Councilman William S . Craycraft said . &quot; We ' d have to have a lot more_than two figures ( tax_revenue and operation costs ) to make a decision. &quot; Mission Viejo isn ' t the only South County city looking_for help from the county . Lake Forest officials say their library is undersized , and expansion may become an issue in the future . Laguna Hills is the only city in the county without a library , and city staff are preparing a report on the issue that will go before the City_Council in March . A Mission Viejo library report shows that eight of 14 South County libraries will be undersized by county standards as the fast-growing communities continue to expand over the next 10 years . The future of their libraries may rest_on what happens in Mission Viejo , city officials say . &quot; We ' ve gotten the information we need , &quot; Mayor Susan Withrow said . &quot; Now it ' s up_to the county as_to whether they ' re going to cooperate with us . It ' s a matter of fair play now. &quot;</TEXT>
