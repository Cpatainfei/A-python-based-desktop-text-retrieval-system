   <HEADLINE> NOT MUCH ELSE MANDELA COULD DO ; SOUTH_AFRICAN LEGEND OFFERS DUAL VOTING_SYSTEM TO CALM ALL GROUPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new South_Africa must remain governable after apartheid if democracy is to take_root . The next president , very probably Nelson Mandela , cannot afford constant attacks from blacks or whites who fear domination by his African National Congress . Better to resolve these conflicts before the April elections solidify the transfer of power but perhaps trigger a permanent Balkanization . The most difficult challenge remains how to placate an unlikely but powerful alliance of spoilers : thousands of secession-minded Zulus and white right-wing extremists who demand their own independent nations and plan to boycott the balloting . They must be included in the process . Mandela is not inflexible . Although the hugely popular leader need not compromise to be elected , he must make concessions to discourage bloody divides if he is to govern effectively . He acknowledges that &quot; we must treat the threat of civil_war seriously. &quot; To discourage further violence , he must foster participation in the new democracy by South_Africans who do not pledge allegiance to his ANC . Mandela is now willing to hold two separate votes , one to elect national_leaders and the other to pick regional leaders . The twin votes would replace the proposed single vote that would have given the ANC an advantage in both national and regional races . The double balloting would allow Zulus , for example , a greater say in how their region would be governed . It is a practical move . But is it enough ? President Frederik W . de Klerk thinks the compromise is sufficient to clear the way for all parties to participate in the April balloting . He plans to recall Parliament the first week of March to rule on the ANC ' s latest concession . President Clinton , who was briefed by Mandela Friday , supports the change and indicates that Washington will continue to work to persuade all groups to participate in the April elections . Perhaps Clinton should speak directly to Mandela ' s old rival , Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi , the Zulu chief who runs KwaZulu , the quasi-independent Zulu homeland , and leads the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party . He remains unplacated . Buthelezi fears a clean sweep by the ANC despite the election proposal that would give Zulus a greater voice in their area . However , the negotiating isn ' t over . Once again Mandela proves just how shrewd a politician he is . He has compromised with groups that his primary constituency , particularly the more militant wing of the ANC , views_as enemies . Against the militants ' wishes he will try to accommodate the Zulus who do not support him -- in the same way that he has accommodated the white_men who were his jailers . If , as expected , Mandela becomes president , he will be the president of all South_Africans . He already is demonstrating how to govern a united nation .</TEXT>
