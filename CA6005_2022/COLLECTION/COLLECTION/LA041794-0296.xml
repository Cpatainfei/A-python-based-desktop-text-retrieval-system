   <HEADLINE> A LEGEND CALLED LA GAZELLE ? ; OLYMPIC CHAMPION MARIE-JOSE PEREC FLEES FRANCE ' S FRENZY TO BECOME A SPRINTER FOR THE AGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although the press back home_in Paris has not been kind to her in recent months , Marie-Jose Perec sat in the stands after a workout last week at UCLA ' s Drake Stadium and intently read a French sports daily . As often is the case -- too often , she thinks -- there was an article about her , La Gazelle . While she had been in her new surroundings too briefly for the author to report on Perec ' s progress on the track , he concentrated instead on her other activities since arriving two weeks ago to set_up an apartment in Westwood -- running errands and shopping . The fascination in France with her everyday life fascinates her . &quot; I am not Madonna , &quot; she said . She is , however , one of France ' s most prominent sports personalities , the country ' s only track_and_field gold medalist at the 1992 Summer Olympics . Among the reasons she left France was to escape her fame , which , according to her agent , Tom Sturak of Topanga Canyon , made_it difficult for her to stroll along a boulevard , visit a museum , rest at a sidewalk cafe or dine_in a restaurant -- the enticements of living in Paris -- without being disturbed by well-meaning but intrusive fans . Sturak said she would not have that problem in Los Angeles , where track_stars , he assured her , are among the dimmest in the galaxy . Fortunately for Sturak , she has a sense_of_humor because , while walking toward Drake Stadium for her first workout , she was stopped by two young_men who asked_for her autograph . When they informed her they were UCLA students from France , she laughed and signed . Running_away from her public , she told Sturak , is less important to her than running toward the destiny she has chosen for herself , which is the primary reason she chose to come_to Westwood and work with the accomplished young coach , John Smith . Other Olympic champions he has coached include Steve Lewis , Kevin Young and Quincy Watts . &quot; She doesn ' t speak much English , and I don ' t speak much French , &quot; Sturak said . &quot; But she has made_it very clear that she wants to leave a mark on this sport beyond winning a gold medal. &quot; She will begin that quest with a small step , running a relay leg in today ' s Mt . San Antonio College Relays at Walnut that she is treating more as an opportunity to introduce herself to Southern California track_and_field fans than as serious competition . She , however , is very serious about this season and , she said through an interpreter in an interview last week , is determined to prove that she is still the world ' s best in her specialty , the 400 meters . And then , predicted Smith , her new coach , she will go_on to conquer the 400-meter hurdles and the 200 and -- who knows ? -- maybe even the 100 . Perec , 25 , had no such illusions of grandeur as a child on Basse-Terre , one of two Caribbean_islands consolidating to form the_French territory of Guadaloupe . A French coach discovered her there almost 10 years ago in a 200-meter race , announcing afterward that her time qualified her for France ' s national championships . &quot; I did not even know what that was , &quot; she said . &quot; I hardly knew what the Olympic Games were. &quot; Four years later , she was competing in them , reaching the quarterfinals in the 200 at Seoul . Realizing that she had a bright future in the sport , she resigned herself not only to the Parisian climate , remaining there to train instead of returning to Guadaloupe for the winters , but also to a more disciplined approach to training . She also focused_on the 400 meters , a more natural distance for a runner with her tall , lean frame -- she ' s 5 feet 11 3 / 4 , 132 pounds . She began to work in November , 1990 , with one of France ' s best coaches , the no-nonsense Jacques Piasenta , and nine months later became a world champion . The next year , she won the Olympic gold medal , boldly proclaiming that her time at Barcelona , 48.83 seconds , was the fastest ever run_by a woman without the assistance of performance-enhancing drugs . La Gazelle owned Paris . She appeared on virtually every magazine cover and looked as if she belonged in the clothes she modeled for Paco Rabbane and Claude Montana . She even began to take courses so that she could design her own . But as she became more self-assured off the track , she became more independent on it . She and Piasenta clashed last year , primarily over her decision to run the 200 in the World Championships at Stuttgart , Germany , instead of the 400 . &quot; For me , to try the 200 was a challenge , &quot; she said . &quot; A lot of people thought it was stupid . But if you don ' t try new things in life , you don ' t get anything out of it . I have no regrets. &quot; When she finished fourth , some among the_French press criticized her for not listening to Piasenta . She lashed back at them for not putting enough emphasis in their reports on her hamstring injury , which she believed prevented her from performing better . In a stormy news_conference at Stuttgart , she told them they should spend more time gathering facts instead of pictures of her derriere . Soon , that was the only part of her anatomy they would see as she turned her back on them . The same went_for Piasenta . They had their final argument before last winter ' s European indoor championships at Paris . He insisted that she compete , but she refused because she did not feel she was in top form and did not want to run poorly in front of a home crowd . Before she could fire him , he quit . &quot; He is a super coach , but athletes have to obey everything he says , &quot; she said . &quot; He is kind of a dictator . I ' m OK with following rules , but I want to talk to a coach and tell him how I ' m feeling . That is why I came_to John Smith . He listens to what the athletes have to say. &quot; Smith initially resisted , telling her that he would coach her during the winter but that she should remain with Piasenta during the rest of the year . But when it became obvious that her split with Piasenta was irreparable , Smith invited her to Westwood . So now , Marie-Jose is Mary Jo . Although she speaks little English , she understands much of what is being spoken around her , and she laughs often at the banter among the other athletes in Smith ' s global village , which includes such Olympians as Dennis Mitchell and Young from the United States and John Regis and Tony Jarrett of Great Britain . &quot; In the group of athletes I was training with in France , there was so_much jealousy , &quot; she said . &quot; I think the athletes there hate each other . When I see Mitchell and Regis running together here , I am amazed . It makes them better because they can learn from each other. &quot; Smith said Perec will fit_in nicely . &quot; She ' s a free_spirit , &quot; he said . Asked if she could become the best athlete he has ever coached , Smith said , &quot; She could be one of the best anyone has ever coached . &quot; She ' s got a chance to go_to another level , to be up there in the stratosphere . She could be up there with Carl Lewis and Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Edwin Moses and Heike Drechsler . that ' s how I want her to think_of herself , and I think that ' s where she wants to go. &quot; For this year , Perec said she would be satisfied with regaining the No . 1 ranking that she had in the 400 meters in 1991 and ' 92 . &quot; I have to be No . 1 , &quot; she said . &quot; I have to prove that I can leave France and still be No . 1. &quot; When it was suggested that her critics in France might like to see her fail in the United States , she smiled and said , &quot; I hope not , for them. &quot; She did not have to add that she believes they will be disappointed .</TEXT>
