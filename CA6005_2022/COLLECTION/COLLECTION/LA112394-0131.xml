   <HEADLINE> U.S. TAKES_OVER URANIUM CACHE FROM KAZAKHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States has brought more_than half a ton of highly enriched uranium to this country from Kazakhstan that otherwise might have found its way to Third_World countries for use in nuclear_weapons , U.S. officials said Tuesday . The move , which is expected to be announced today , was the result of months of negotiations between Clinton_Administration officials and Kazakh leaders , who have pledged to adhere to international standards in dealing with leftover nuclear stockpiles of the former Soviet_Union . A senior Administration official described the operation as &quot; a huge success story &quot; for U.S. efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear_weapons . Officials said the uranium , which was flown to the United States in huge military C-5A cargo planes , will be reprocessed into commercial-grade material and used to help fuel nuclear_power plants here and in other countries . The final shipment from Kazakhstan arrived earlier this week . U.S. officials said the weapons-grade material could have been used to manufacture up_to 20 nuclear bombs . They said it was poorly protected and could have easily been smuggled or sold on the black_market . Officials said it was the largest cache of uranium from a former Soviet Bloc country that has been brought_to the United States in this fashion . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary are scheduled to disclose details of the operation today . American intelligence agencies confirmed last year that Iran had sent purchasing agents to Kazakhstan in an effort to buy weapons-grade uranium for the Iranian nuclear_weapons program , but U.S. officials said at the time that they did not believe Iran was able to buy any . Earlier this year , Kazakhstan ' s leaders approached the Administration about how to dispose_of the material . The uranium was contained in a huge cache at Ust-Kamenogorsk , in a remote section of the country . In October , a 24-member team that included representatives of the Pentagon , the State_Department and the Energy_Department traveled_to Kazakhstan to supervise the inventorying and packaging of the uranium . The transportation of the material to the United States began shortly after that . The Administration has been working for months to help safeguard the nuclear stockpile of the former Soviet_Union -- the actual weapons and the materials needed to manufacture them -- in the wake of the breakup of the Soviet Empire . Early this year , the White_House announced agreement on a tripartite treaty among the United States , Russia and Ukraine on the dismantling of former Soviet warheads then being kept_in Ukraine . Since that time , Ukraine has sent about 600 warheads to Russia for dismantling . Officials said the negotiations with Kazakhstan -- kept secret until this week -- were carried_on by the same interagency team that shepherded the tripartite accord . Monies for the effort are being provided under a program designed to help former Soviet republics dispose_of their weapons . U.S. officials said the effort to persuade Kazakhstan to ship its uranium to the United States for reprocessing took_on added urgency earlier this year when economic hardship there led to civil unrest and ultimately to a breakdown of law and order . U.S. analysts had feared that , in an effort to obtain more cash , Kazakhstan ' s nuclear_weapons teams might seek to sell weapons or uranium to Third_World governments such_as Iran or Iraq , which want to become nuclear_powers . The operation was given the code-name &quot; Sapphire , &quot; Washington officials said Tuesday . Kazakhstan has signed an agreement pledging to adhere to international safeguards for nuclear materials and has agreed to accept inspections by the Geneva-based International Atomic Energy Agency , the organization that sets rules for nuclear_energy around the globe . As a Soviet republic , Kazakhstan was the site of dozens of nuclear_weapons , processing centers and uranium stockpiles . When the Soviet_Union collapsed , the weapons remained in the new country . The uranium , which officials said Tuesday totals about 600 kilograms , will be reprocessed at the U.S. Energy_Department nuclear facility at Oak Ridge , Tenn . There was no immediate indication how long it will take_to complete the process .</TEXT>
