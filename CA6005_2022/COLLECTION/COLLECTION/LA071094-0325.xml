   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; A TALE OF NINE CITIES ; FINDING THE BEST AND WORST AT WORLD CUP VENUES , WHERE NEW YORK MEANT NEW JERSEY , BOSTON MEANT TRIBAL DANCING IN THE STREETS AND A ROSE BOWL SNO-CONE MEANT $ 2.50</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They came for the soccer . We gave them Americana . Their tickets entitled them to World Cup games . We threw_in an education in United States history , geography , and the economics of the $ 20 baseball_cap . They expected an athletic tournament . We staged a county fair , featuring nine exhibits stretched across 3 # 000 miles , with people and surroundings as varied as our twangs . Visitors to the Boston venue will remember the success of the Soccer Train , a commuter rail and site of opposing pep_rallies on the 50-minute trip to Foxboro Stadium . Imagine that , longtime Bostonians said . A culture clash where nobody gets hurt . Visitors to the Dallas venue will remember our failures : the blight around the aging Cotton Bowl , the empty seats inside , the construction-hampered traffic flow that turned game days into nightmares . For nearly a month , in nine locations , the world has applauded our wonders , cringed at our bruises , and , in some places , even felt our embrace . So how did we do ? Sometimes , we shined . Other times , we stumbled . Sometimes we yelled too_much , pushed too_much . When the rest of the world was rushing joyfully out of a subway or dancing through an alley , often we put_up our dukes and played the frightened bullies . But we also smiled a lot , and listened a lot , and sometimes accepted that which we did not understand . Like those hourlong postgame fan celebrations that forced stadium police to work overtime . We eventually realized something could not be so bad if it made so many people so happy . We hollered and hugged , we were impatient and helpful . In other words , we were ourselves . Sometimes we thrilled . But other times , we disappointed . Visitors to the New York venue will remember what Dublin sales representative Gerry Taylor remembers . Nothing . Taylor learned on the first weekend that despite slick World Cup advertisements , New York was not New York . Just as Boston was not Boston , but Foxboro . And Detroit was not Detroit , but Pontiac . And Los Angeles was Pasadena . And New York was actually a smelly , industrial area in northern New Jersey . Taylor left his Manhattan room early one Saturday morning , four hours before the opener between Italy and Ireland . He wrapped himself in an Irish flag and planned on a making a pregame stop in a pub next door to Giants Stadium . &quot; Do this all_the time in Dublin , &quot; he said . &quot; Pop a_few Guinness at the pub , talk to other fans , get ready for the game. &quot; But upon arriving in East Rutherford , N.J. , he realized the only thing he could drink next door to the stadium was toxic_waste . There wasn ' t a pub in_sight . Or a store . Or a house . Or even a street that wasn ' t an expressway . He spent the next three hours sitting with two friends on a curb , cursing his introduction to sports in America . &quot; Are all stadiums like this , away from cities , in the middle of nothing ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Seems to me it must be hard to have good sports in places like this , isn ' t it ? We are let down. &quot; The only thing we can assure him , and others as disillusioned as Taylor , is it wasn ' t because we didn ' t try . Rating the 1994 World Cup venues , best and worst of show : CHICAGO * BEST : We knew this would be a great spot from the moment we first bit into something called &quot; the Belly Buster , &quot; sold at a hot dog stand near Soldier Field . Ingredients : Polish beef dog , relish , ketchup , mustard , onions and jalapeno peppers . It lived_up_to its billing . Trust us . And so did everything else . Soldier Field is the perfect location for an international event , being just a short cab ride from one of America ' s great downtowns . Michigan Avenue has been buzzing for a month , what with German tourists in Bermuda shorts buying black patent_leather shoes to accompany their white socks . At night , horse-drawn carriages fought with taxis for street space in some of the best action since Ben Hur . * WORST : The only people who didn ' t enjoy themselves here were the Greeks , both the national soccer players and the large Chicago-area community that gathered to watch them one Sunday morning against Bulgaria . Greece lost that game , 4-0 . In the process , the teams drove Greek fans so crazy they started seeing things . At one point during the game , a Greek tossed a smoke_bomb on the field , later claiming it was tradition to do so after his team scored . His team is back in Athens , and it still hasn ' t scored . * IMPRESSIONS : The World Cup ' s kind of town , Chicago is . Not only were the streets brimming with international flavor , the shuttle system to Soldier Field was so efficient that cabbies complained about not getting enough chances to rip people off . Now that ' s a venue . * YOU HAD TO BE HERE : During a bachelor_party held_on the 36th floor of a prominent local hotel , somebody poured beer down the elevator shaft . By morning , the ale had dripped to ground floor and short-circuited the electrical_system . Many hotel guests -- some checking out with reams of World Cup-related luggage -- were forced to carry everything down 20 flights of stairs . Once at the bottom , they had to tip valet-parking drivers for walking 10 steps to pick_up their cars . BOSTON * BEST : We marveled not at a city ' s effect upon a World Cup , but vice versa . &quot; What has happened to a town divided along ethnic lines has been remarkable , &quot; said E.J. Kahn of the Boston Host Committee . By order of Mayor Tom Menino , the historic City_Hall area was turned_over to foreigners of every imaginable color and tongue . Old-timers who never thought they would see an African soccer team playing_at the home of the New England Patriots also never thought they would see people dancing on their cobblestone streets in tribal costumes . Police were particularly worried the night after Argentina had defeated Greece in a first-round game . While the Greeks partied in front of City_Hall , the_Argentines celebrated eight blocks away in Copley Square . The fiestas drew closer and closer until five Argentine fans wearing blue-and-white uniform shorts stood directly behind a dozen Greeks dancing in a circle . Just as security_guards prepared to move_in , the circle slowly opened , and the Greeks motioned for the_Argentines to join them . The Argentines did . The hardened city sighed . * WORST : Many fans apparently didn ' t realize that the game would be played about 45 minutes south of Boston in the desolate suburb of Foxboro . And nobody knew that once they arrived_at the stadium , in a forested area where parking availability seemed unlimited , parking_spaces would cost $ 20 each . Visitors got_even with the World Cup Organizing Committee , though , by leaving their hotels in Boston and staying closer to the stadium in places such_as Providence , R.I. Our smallest state as a World Cup host ? Not quite what organizers had_in_mind . * IMPRESSIONS : The Northeast may have tried harder than any other area , and it showed . The normally reserved Bostonians , ranked 28th out of 36 U.S. city residents in a recent survey rating kindness to strangers , discovered warmth and tolerance . When dozens of Irish tourists were swindled out of tickets , Bostonians found them more . When foreigners didn ' t understand those distinct accents , Bostonians spoke more slowly . * YOU HAD TO BE HERE : For an hour after Argentina ' s victory over Greece , more_than a_hundred Argentine fans remained at Foxboro Stadium , dancing and singing . Police politely asked them to leave their seats , but the group only moved as far as the lower concourse . Thirty minutes later , police finally escorted them down the concourse and out the front gates , where they continued to party . Was the game that exciting ? Well , yes and no . With this stadium being 20 miles from the nearest decent-sized city , they had nowhere else to go . DALLAS * BEST : From the World Cup volunteers to city cab drivers , we appreciated the people . Amid bleak surroundings and uncomfortable temperatures , they provided the venue with some badly needed touches of humanity . One hero was Laura Addington , a schoolteacher from Louisiana . She served as an interpreter for everyone . Well , at least everyone who spoke English , French , Spanish , Italian , German or Arabic . Other stars were the African taxi drivers . They knew the roads , and they knew soccer , which is the only reason we were able to find Maradona during rush_hour . * WORST : Some nights were almost cool enough to hold a sporting event . Yet most of the games were held_in the blazing afternoon or early evening sun to accommodate European television . Those brave enough to attend games suffered through stifling heat . Don ' t buy those happy expressions you saw on ESPN . It was torture . * IMPRESSIONS : Dallas is a Cowboy town . And not the Germans , Argentines or any of the soccer fanatics who came_through here changed that . With poor attendance and a distinct lack of any electricity other_than that generated by the Cowboys ' new set of uniforms , this proves there are about a_thousand better places in this country to hold an international event . Not that Dallas is a bad place -- it ' s merely the wrong place . We have learned that events such_as the World Cup require diversity of thought and appreciation of differences . Dallas is just too danged American for any of that . What Dallas ' failure here portends for the 1996 Olympics in another southern town called Atlanta , well , that ' s for another story . * YOU HAD TO BE HERE : By some estimates , the World Cup games here were outdrawn even by the demolition of the Cotton Exchange building downtown one Saturday morning . But at least at the soccer games , nobody was treated for smoke inhalation . NEW YORK-NEW JERSEY * BEST : With the melting_pot of New York City nearby , this was the only truly international venue . The stadium rocked with the sounds , colors and even smells of those countries competing . Except for its location in New Jersey , Giants Stadium was also the perfect World Cup facility , with a beautiful field and gleaming facilities that had foreigners gawking . * WORST : The only Cup fever to hit New York City involved the Stanley Cup . Maybe it was because of the Rangers . Or Knicks . Or Gay Games . It certainly wasn ' t the Yankees , whose attendance was routinely tripled by the World Cup games . Maybe it was because every day in New York City feels_like an international festival . Or maybe it was because New York City simply didn ' t have the time . Whatever , the city that doesn ' t sleep also didn ' t care . It was interesting to drive to the stadium listening to New York City sports-talk radio hosts rip soccer , then arrive to discover mile-long lines at the front gates . New Jersey license_plates , all_of them . * IMPRESSIONS : Organizers could save tourists and taxi_fare by dropping all pretenses that the game is being played in New York City . The success of this venue proves it is time to start celebrating the ethnic charms and splendid facilities of northern New Jersey . . . and leave New York to worry about the Mets . * YOU HAD TO BE HERE : The location for the World Cup host committee in this country ' s largest city ? New Brunswick , N.J. , 90 minutes from Manhattan . The location of these New Jersey-played games as listed on commemorative postal stamps ? New York . DETROIT * BEST : Do not underestimate the accomplishment of organizers who ran the Detroit venue by avoiding all traces of Detroit . Games were staged an hour ' s drive north in the suburb of Pontiac , a bedroom community dominated by large front lawns and strip malls . If Detroit street gangs possess missiles that can fly that far , we didn ' t see them . The venue MVP ( Most Valuable Professor ) was Trey Rogers , the god of sod . The assistant prof of turf-grass science at Michigan State actually made grass grow inside the Silverdome . After three years of experiments , at a cost of $ 2.4 million , the indoor stuff held_up admirably and was hailed by all but the most serious allergy sufferers . * WORST : Much like East Rutherford and Foxboro , there was no there there . The venue lacked big-city energy and a pulse . The streets emptied at 10 p.m. After night_games , if you hadn ' t paid someone to hold a spot in_line at Herschel ' s Deli , the happening spot was a Taco Bell drive-through . Of course , after a game in the non-air-conditioned Silverdome , all anybody wanted to do was lie_down in a nice comfortable meat locker . * IMPRESSIONS : Smiling faces , helpful people , but mostly sweat . Three-alarm , two-shirt sweat . * YOU HAD TO BE HERE : After the June 24 game between Brazil and Sweden , a thunderstorm passed directly over the media tent as hundreds of journalists were filing their stories . The thunder was deafening and the tent shook as if it were going_to break . Lightning threatened to knock_out the power . The lights flickered , World Cup officials implored reporters to save their files or risk losing them . This scene was repeated at media and hospitality tents in most of the venues . But aside from the Mexican team , nothing in the tournament has collapsed . WASHINGTON * BEST : We never thought we ' d say this , but we liked the subways . The blue line , which stopped three blocks from RFK stadium , was a shoulder-to-shoulder mass of international passion . The Dutch fans made their mark by pounding on the ceilings . The Swiss , by chanting through the underground terminals . The Mexicans demonstrated their presence with songs , singing loud even though they could barely breathe while crushed in overloaded cars during the final 10 minutes of the trip . It was all underground , but it was true democracy , rare even for our nation ' s capital . * WORST : Everything was wonderful until you actually walked inside RFK . The stadium is falling_apart . The Mexican fans literally caused it to rock with their constant bouncing during Mexico ' s emotional tie with Italy . The stadium security officials were surly and overbearing . Maybe it was those horrible purple berets that made them so mad . The stadium media-tent volunteers , mostly of college age , were the worst . This would be of no interest to the public , except many worldwide impressions of this country are created by foreign journalists . And those foreign journalists were treated horribly . Little attempt was made to understand or deal with them . Tickets were refused with no explanation given . Attempts to talk with media coordinators were denied . Questions about the facility were greeted with shrugs . Translators working player interviews refused to even offer translated quotes until they had been typed and apparently approved by supervisors , which often took two or three hours . When one Middle Eastern journalist complained about discrimination , one college_girl working as a volunteer laughed in his face and replied , &quot; I don ' t think so. &quot; * IMPRESSIONS : Sports organizers beware . Any further events staged here should not involve any local volunteers or officials from this World Cup . This is a wonderful city , and as our capital , it should be the one of the first places promoters go_for big events . But now we wonder if haughty attitudes and low-rent facilities haven ' t kept the big_games away . * YOU HAD TO BE HERE : A local activist hung a &quot; Save Bosnia &quot; sign_in the stands during the opening game here between Mexico and Norway . It was taken_down by local officials . He sued for the right to display it . He won . Not that the guy wanted to rub it in , but visible the next game were two &quot; Save Bosnia &quot; signs . SAN FRANCISCO-PALO ALTO * BEST : We love Los Gatos . This mountain town of 28 # 000 near San Jose has adopted -- and been adopted by -- the Brazilians . After Brazil ' s games at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto , Los Gatos became Little Rio , complete with samba music , incessant drumbeats and conga_lines through Town Plaza Park . &quot; This is very exciting , &quot; local resident Judy VanKampen said . &quot; It is totally different than what you normally see in Los Gatos , which is people walking down the street with dogs and strollers. &quot; Even though crowds were lively , they were orderly . Some of the women might have strained the city ' s public decency codes with their skimpy bikinis , but city officials , to their credit , looked the other way . Sure they did . * WORST : The whining of Palo Alto politicians because World Cup organizers identified the venue as San Francisco . But unless we are missing something , nobody has written a song called , &quot; I Left My Heart in Palo Alto. &quot; * IMPRESSIONS : Of all_the venues , Stanford_University was the worst in creating obstacles for World Cup organizers . University officials were in position to drive a hard bargain because FIFA , soccer ' s organizing body , wanted a presence in San Francisco but did not want to use Candlestick Park because of its smaller size . Thus , Stanford Stadium is by far the least modern of the venues . Even though some improvements were made , World Cup organizers did not get all_of their demands met . Yet those academics learned that the World Cup is just the type of event that educational_institutions should be encouraging . The excellent soccer is the least of its legacies . Teams from four continents played here , and the visitors who followed those teams to Palo Alto left something of themselves behind . Unfortunately for the merchants , it was not money . They were disappointed in their take . But the visitors contributed something more valuable , their cultures . Los Gatos , one feels , will never be the same . * YOU HAD TO BE HERE : A Brazilian woman walked into an ice_cream store in Los Gatos one hot day and ordered a beer . LOS ANGELES-PASADENA * BEST : My , but the old_lady still can sing . Our Rose Bowl looked wonderful with its face_lift and colorful frills . When the air is clear and the heat isn ' t oppressive , there is no better view in this World Cup than that of the San Gabriel mountains looming behind the Rose Bowl scoreboard . Well , OK , the view of that scoreboard after the United States played Columbia was pretty nice too . * WORST : That World Cup chief Alan Rothenberg would allow his hometown facility to rip_off hungry and thirsty soccer fans -- many of them his neighbors -- with inflated prices is inexcusable . Two dollars and fifty cents for a Sno-cone ? Fish and chips for $ 7.50 ? * IMPRESSIONS : The scene reminds us of the 1984 Olympics , causing emotions we never thought we would feel again . Traffic flowing smoothly , the city clean and pressed , citizens talking_about something fun . Surveys say that many people here couldn ' t care less about the event , but the ones who do have made_it memorable . * YOU HAD TO BE HERE : With so many men ignoring the &quot; Women &quot; signs_on the portable toilets outside the Rose Bowl , officials placed &quot; Out of Order &quot; signs_on several working potties and secretly passed_around the word that women should use those . ORLANDO * BEST : Quick , somebody get this town an NFL team . There was no better stadium-area atmosphere than here , where fans congregated less than a mile from the Florida Citrus Bowl at a trendy shopping and dining_area called Church Street Station . One night the Dutch fans were having so_much fun , they started stealing baseball_caps from policemen . Another night , the Mexicans were having so_much fun they lay_down on the railroad_tracks upon hearing an oncoming train . OK , so maybe we don ' t all have the same kinds of fun . Expensive restaurants became rollicking pubs . Thousands of foreigners became wailing , wandering messes . Did we mention that the_Irish were also in town ? * WORST : This was soccer in a sauna . Every team that played under the unforgiving midday sun recorded a triumph of spirit . For fans , merely getting_to the games was a similar triumph . Ten dollars to ride a parking_lot shuttle ? Fifteen dollars to park at a local school , with the money being handed to a member of the PTA ? This was central Florida hucksterism at its worst . But then , they learned from the experts down the street , those guys wearing the ears . * IMPRESSIONS : With the Dutch and Belgians in town , this was supposed to be the site of hooliganism . Police from around the state were summoned for 12-hour shifts . But nothing happened . The most serious crime involved people refusing to leave bars at closing time . Already our vacation capital , Orlando proved that it deserves to become a sports capital as well . It knows how to turn a game into an event without anybody getting hurt . After existing for so_long in the shadow of fantasyland , it acts_as if it loves this real_stuff . * YOU HAD TO BE HERE : In the downtown area on July 4 , fans from everywhere joined to sing &quot; Happy Birthday. &quot; To whom ? To the United States , of course . Considering how we came_of_age in yet another international sporting scene this summer , it was a happy birthday indeed . * Times staff writers Elliott Almond , Julie Cart , Lisa Dillman , Chris Dufresne , Helene Elliott , Randy Harvey , Mike Penner and Times Sports Editor Bill Dwyre contributed to this story . Crowd Pleaser From zealots to the casual fan to the simply curious , they have come_in droves to World Cup ' 94 , making this the best-attended tournament in the event ' s 64-year history . Through 44 of 52 games , the crowd count stood at 2 # 995 , 242 , surpassing the record of 2.5-million for Italia ' 90 . Indeed , this global spectacular has been so popular that ticket sales at some venues , such_as Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando , and Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto , have exceeded listed capacity .
