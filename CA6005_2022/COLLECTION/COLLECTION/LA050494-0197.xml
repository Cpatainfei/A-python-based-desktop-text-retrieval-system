   <HEADLINE> DIABLOS HAVING DEVIL OF A TIME ; PREP WEDNESDAY : MISSION VIEJO ' S ATHLETIC PROGRAM , ONCE THE ENVY OF ORANGE COUNTY , HAS BEEN DECIMATED BY INFIGHTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stoic expressions born of disbelief and shame crossed the faces of Mission Viejo High coaches and players as the game clock wound down on an October night in 1991 . The source of their torment was a 42-7 loss to Mater Dei in a nonleague football game at Santa Ana Stadium -- an experience with which the proud Diablos were unfamiliar . Mission Viejo entered the game undefeated and ranked No . 1 in Orange County , but it left with the cheering of Mater Dei ' s coaches , fans and players ringing in its ears . Some key performers were unavailable because of injuries , but many of the team ' s supporters believe there was more at_work in the drubbing . The effects of years of turmoil on the Mission Viejo campus -- and in the community -- were catching_up_with the team . &quot; They gave us a real beating , &quot; said Ken Sjobom , a Mission Viejo teacher and former longtime assistant football_coach . &quot; In all my years , we were never beaten like that. &quot; Including the rout by Mater Dei , Mission Viejo was 3-4 in its final seven games after winning its first four . What ' s more , the Diablos lost in the first round of the Southern Section playoffs for the first time in more_than a decade . They have not had a winning season since . But what occurred last year was especially galling to ardent supporters ; the Diablos failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 1976 . For the football_team , 1991 proved to be a watershed . By the end of the next season , the corps of coaches who helped create and sustain football excellence at Mission Viejo would be gutted . And the problems were not exclusive to the football program . Almost three years later , those demons have yet to be exorcised . Today , Mission Viejo is attempting to piece together a football program -- and an athletic department -- that once was second to none in the county . Both became casualties in a war of ideology over a school logo and repeated losers in political battles with a principal whose style of leadership has been strongly criticized by coaches , parents and teachers , although he is commended for the school ' s academic prowess . And while some believe Mission Viejo is_well on_the_road to recovery , others doubt the Diablos will ever walk as successful a path again . At one time , Mission Viejo was the yardstick by which other public_school athletic departments in the county were measured . Beginning in the late 1970s , the Diablos dominated Southern Section play . Few schools in the state have sustained as high a_level of play in as_many sports over an equal period_of_time . Cal-Hi Sports selected Mission Viejo its state school of the year three times ( 1981 , ' 86 and ' 87 ) for overall athletic success . From 1977-90 , the football_team won eight South Coast League championships , two section titles and played in another section title game . The Diablos advanced to at least the semifinal round from 1984-90 , and totaled 10 or more victories four consecutive seasons ( 1987-90 ) . Mission Viejo was ranked first in the final county football poll in 1988 and ' 90 . Bill Crow remembers those glory days well . Crow led Mission Viejo to a section title in 1981 and was 73-22-6 in seven seasons as head coach . He stepped_down in 1987 and is now an assistant at Trabuco Hills . &quot; We were real fortunate , &quot; Crow said . &quot; We did operate at a pretty successful level for a long time. &quot; And several other sports also provided their share of league titles and section championships . The boys ' swimming and diving team won the section ' s major-division title from 1975-88 . The girls did the same from 1976-86 . &quot; It got_to the point where it was a shock if we didn ' t win the ( swimming ) titles , &quot; said Assistant Principal Wil Chong , who has spent 17 years at the school . In baseball , Mission Viejo played in a section title game in 1985 . The team won league championships in 1978 and ' 89 , and qualified for the playoffs 12 times from 1976-93 . Basketball also produced its share of trophies . The boys ' team won four league titles and played in two section title games from 1976-85 . The girls won section championships in 1982 and ' 87 . There was also continued success in boys ' and girls ' soccer , track and tennis . But Mission Viejo has fallen hard . After the fall and winter sports seasons , Mission Viejo was 36th out of 38 large-division schools ( at least 1 # 200 students ) in competition for The Times ' All-Sports Awards . The Diablos had 41.025 points . Edison was first with 237.67. The Times uses a formula based on teams ' winning percentages , finish in_league and playoff results to determine points . Out of all public_schools in Orange County , Mission Viejo had the third-lowest score . Mission Viejo posted winning records in only two of 11 varsity sports it fielded in the fall and winter sessions . Judging by Mission Viejo ' s current spring records , it probably will not improve much . Even factoring_in changes in enrollment and the cyclical nature of sports in public_schools , such a sweeping decline is troubling to many . Some say situations that could have been avoided have irreparably damaged the program . John Hattrup is concerned . A 1976 graduate of the school , Hattrup led Mission Viejo to its two girls ' basketball section titles and seven league titles in 10 years . This season he took_over the Brea-Olinda girls ' program , where he had been an assistant since 1987 . The Ladycats were undefeated and ranked No . 1 in the nation by USA Today . &quot; It ' s very unfortunate , &quot; Hattrup said . &quot; I felt that we had one of the best coaching staffs , if not the best , in Orange County at Mission Viejo . &quot; All of the coaches got_along , and we all did things together . I ' m glad I made the move not just because of the national championship but also for other reasons. &quot; No problem loomed larger than the battle of wills over the logo . A fierce-looking devil was formerly used to represent the school ' s nickname . Diablo is Spanish for devil . But in 1986 , the Saddleback Valley Unified School District banned the logo amid complaints by fundamentalist Christians in the community . The group pushing for change said the image represented evil and wanted the Diablo name to go as well . A compromise was reached to ban only the logo . A drawing of a bulldog was adopted , and students were told they could no longer display the old logo on campus . But the bulldog never caught_on . The school_board ' s decision divided the community . Parents and students defied the action , displaying the banned emblem on hats , jackets and T-shirts during school and in the stands at games . Angry words were exchanged at school meetings , and two lawsuits were filed by parents who claimed their children ' s free-speech rights were being infringed upon . One suit was settled , and the other is still pending , according to a district spokeswoman . Harvey Ohman was president of the school ' s All-Sports Booster Club when the controversy hit . &quot; That whole_thing created the Hatfields and the McCoys , &quot; Ohman said . &quot; We had always been a very close-knit ( school ) , but that created factions. &quot; Hoping to again unite the community , school officials held an election in 1993 to decide on a new logo . A depiction of a smiling baby devil , the only option remotely resembling the previous logo , was chosen . But that move has been stalled because of a copyright problem . Even if the new logo does mollify some , sources said , several fences cannot be mended . Many said the logo issue cost Mike Rush , the former head football_coach , his job . Rush had sided with players and students who rebelled against the ban , which sources said enraged Principal Robert Metz . Metz is described by some coaches , teachers and boosters as a domineering administrator who does not permit opposition from the faculty . Though Metz admits he runs a tight ship , he rebuts charges of Draconian rule . And even Metz ' s harshest critics praise him for academic strides made under him . &quot; Metz went crazy over the whole devil thing , &quot; said one former booster club_member who asked to remain anonymous . &quot; Metz wanted ( Rush ) to prevent the kids from wearing any stuff with the_devil . &quot; Metz wanted him to watch the kids 24 hours a day . Rush said you can ' t watch kids 24 hours a day. &quot; Memos obtained by The Times show that Metz pressured Rush , and other members of the athletic department , to enforce the ban . In one memo to Rush dated Nov . 4 , 1992 , Metz wrote : &quot; Apparently , the_devil on the hat has expanded to include the varsity ( football ) team . I expect you to take_care of the situation with your ( team ) . &quot; Rush did not fulfill Metz ' s mandate and was given an ultimatum . &quot; Metz gave him a ( form ) to sign , which said that Rush would stop everyone from wearing the_devil , &quot; the former booster club_member said . &quot; When Rush refused to sign , Metz forced him to resign. &quot; Rush was fired by Metz in March , 1993 , after five seasons as head coach and 15 total on the coaching staff . Rush died of a heart_attack eight months later at age 46 . Metz declined to discuss the situation , saying he could not because it is a personnel matter . &quot; I think 99 % of things might be different if that logo stuff never came_up , &quot; Ohman said . &quot; Personalities got involved , and it created one problem after another. &quot; A group calling itself the Committee For Concerned Parents spearheaded a movement to have the stadium at Mission Viejo named in honor of Rush , but the district torpedoed the plan because Mission Viejo shares the stadium with Laguna Hills . The board has asked_for other memorial recommendations . &quot; I feel an injustice was committed against Mike Rush , &quot; said Arleen Brown , co-founder of the committee . &quot; Mike Rush was forced to resign because he refused to uphold the illegal ban on the Diablo mascot . &quot; No one should have to go_through the stress he went through. &quot; Metz said he never deals with his staff in an unprofessional manner . But Rush was not the only coach with whom he battled . Dave ( Wally ) Clark said Metz drove him from Mission Viejo . Clark was an assistant coach on the football and baseball_teams from 1981-90 . He said he had a good relationship with Metz -- until his son won the varsity catching job over Metz ' s son during the 1989 baseball_season . Now the football_coach at Murrieta Valley , Clark is speaking about the situation for the first time publicly . &quot; During the season , we had no clue he was so upset , &quot; Clark said . &quot; He was angry , and he never said anything to us , but when the season was over he blew up. &quot; In meetings with Clark and Coach Ron Drake after the season , Clark said Metz lambasted them for not starting his son . &quot; He told us we were horrible coaches , &quot; Clark said . &quot; He wasn ' t talking to us as a parent , he was talking to us as a principal . &quot; When you ' re in that type of position , you have to sometimes divorce yourself from being a parent . He had a hard_time doing that. &quot; Clark remained at Mission Viejo for one more year and left for Murrieta Valley before the start of the 1991 school_year . He said his final year on campus was the most difficult of his life . &quot; We didn ' t talk for the whole year before I left . . . not a word was spoken between us , &quot; Clark said . &quot; The stress and the strain really got_to me . Knowing your boss hated you was real tough. &quot; Drake spent 17 years at Mission Viejo as the head baseball_coach and a football assistant . He left the football_team after the 1991 season and resigned as the baseball_coach last season despite great success -- a 249-134 record and 12 playoff appearances . At the time of his resignation , Drake said he was stepping_down for personal reasons . Drake will not comment on the situation , but friends have said he was badly hurt by Metz ' s anger toward him . &quot; The only thing I want to say is that I have a lot of fond memories and a lot of passion for ( Mission Viejo ) , &quot; said Drake , who transferred to Laguna Hills before the start of the school_year . Drake spent the previous year assisting in baseball and football at Capistrano Valley . &quot; What happened bothers me a lot . It was very difficult , but I don ' t want to talk_about it. &quot; Clark blames Metz for much of what has happened to the school ' s athletic program -- especially in football . &quot; In many ways , Metz is a great principal , &quot; Clark said . &quot; Academically , he took that school to new heights . &quot; But the demise of the program began when the administration got rid off all_the coaches , and it was all for personal reasons . All of a sudden , everything we built just went_away because of personal reasons. &quot; Clark applied for the football coaching position after Rush resigned but was turned_down . Marty Spalding was selected , which angered many parents . Spalding was formerly an assistant at archrival El Toro , and he further angered some parents by hiring former El Toro Coach Bob Johnson as an assistant . &quot; Spalding and Johnson came_in with three strikes on them , &quot; said Ohman , former president of the booster club . &quot; The community would have responded to any other coaches but them. &quot; Mission Viejo went 4-6 and missed the playoffs last season . Spalding resigned in November . In addition to being an assistant coach on the football_team , Sjobom was the head coach on the junior varsity baseball_team from 1979-84 and 1987-92 . He assisted Drake in 1993 . When Drake resigned , Sjobom applied for the varsity job . But he was turned_down despite having won eight league titles and 69 % of his games ( 162-72 ) . The job was given to Pat Wren , who arrived_at Mission Viejo in 1992 and had a record of 4-16 on the junior varsity in 1993 . This season , the baseball_team is last in the South Coast League at 3-17 , 0-11 in_league play . Sjobom declined to discuss the baseball-coaching situation or to elaborate on his reasons for leaving the football_team . Wren did not return phone_calls . Metz denies Clark ' s claim about the outbursts and said coaches who left Mission Viejo did so on_their_own volition . Metz said he does not use his position as principal to influence selection committees . &quot; None of the coaches leaving had anything to do with my leadership ability , &quot; Metz said . &quot; There was nothing personal with_respect_to the way I ' ve dealt with my staff . &quot; The bottom_line is that there is nothing in my regime that allows_for anything personal . I don ' t deal in that format . I have never dealt like that. &quot; Metz , who has been principal since 1981 , agrees the coaching turnover in baseball and football has been high and that the instability has weakened the programs . But Metz blames the turnover on what he said was conflict within the previous football staff . Assistant Principal Chong is in_charge of the athletic department . He , too , places the responsibility for the turnover on the coaches . &quot; I don ' t think ( Metz ) had trouble dealing with anyone , &quot; Chong said . &quot; If there comes a time when coaches don ' t feel they can go_along with the philosophy of the administration , then they have a choice to make. &quot; Both Metz and Chong said the problems with the coaching situation cannot solely account_for the decline in won-loss records . They pinpoint declining enrollment as the main culprit . &quot; One of the difficulties we have to face in_playing Division I athletics is that our competition has as_many as 700 to 800 students more_than us , &quot; Metz said . &quot; When you compare the number of blue-chip athletes per hundred , obviously the greater number of students you have the better. &quot; Mission Viejo has suffered a continual decline in the student body since its peak enrollment of 2 # 699 in 1977 , according to the district . Mission Viejo is the oldest_school in the district , and some of its enrollment has been pulled_away with the opening of El Toro , Laguna Hills and Trabuco Hills high_schools . As of April 1 , Mission Viejo was the third-largest school in the district with an enrollment of 1 # 678 . El Toro ( 2 # 092 ) is first and Trabuco Hills ( 1 # 714 ) second . Throughout the late 1970s and ' 80s , Mission Viejo ' s enrollment remained about 2 # 200 . Mission Viejo has the lowest enrollment in the South Coast League , although it is not the smallest school competing in Division I . But Metz and Chong argue that shrinking enrollment , coupled with the emergence of nearby , private Santa Margarita as an athletic force , have combined to dilute the talent pool . Because of this , they said it is impossible for Mission Viejo to maintain its former level of dominance . That theory , however , does not hold water . Despite a significant enrollment drop , Edison still runs one of the best athletic programs in the county , as shown by The Times ' All-Sports rankings . And Mission Viejo ' s enrollment drop didn ' t immediately signal doom for the football program . In 1990 , the Diablos were 11-2 and advanced to a section semifinal . Enrollment then was 1 # 700 , only slightly higher than today . &quot; We would like to win every year , but that ' s not realistic , &quot; Metz said . &quot; We ' re not going_to win ( section titles ) again and again and again and again like we used to. &quot; So in what direction does Mission Viejo head now ? Well , more change is taking_place . And many believe the current moves will help . Potentially the biggest boost to the program , several Diablo supporters said , will come_in July when Metz leaves to become director of secondary_education for the district . Tustin Principal Duffy Clark will replace Metz . The Tillers maintained and cultivated a strong athletic program during Clark ' s six-year tenure as principal , a fact that pleases current All-Sports Booster Club President John Dellos . &quot; We wanted someone who recognized that athletics are an integral part of a school program , &quot; said Dellos , a member of the selection committee . Said Clark : &quot; Athletics play a part in a total school program . It ' s one of the three major components , along with academics and other activities , that help to create a successful environment. &quot; New football_Coach Bill Denny also wants to help the Mission Viejo environment . Formerly an assistant under Rush and Spalding , Denny is popular_with many parents . They believe he can put the program back on solid_ground . &quot; A lot of people have rallied around Denny , &quot; said Ohman , who also announces Diablo football games . &quot; The real feeling is that he can bring it back. &quot; Denny has moved swiftly . He is bringing_in former players to coach and teach current players about the program ' s tradition . Boys ' Athletic Director Steve Carnes , who coached Lawndale Leuzinger to a section title in 1985 , will also lend a hand . Denny has talked with the players about putting troubles behind and banding_together to get_back on top . He also plans to speak with the booster club soon . &quot; we ' ll take the positive from the past , and combine that with some energetic new people and build_on that , &quot; he said . &quot; I want the kids here to feel_like they are special because they ' re playing at Mission Viejo High . &quot; that ' s the feeling I want to build_on because this is a special place. &quot; As many can attest , that ' s a feeling few have had at Mission Viejo in quite awhile . 20 Years of Mission Viejo Football 05 # 06 , 08 # 16 , 23 # 16 Year Record League Finish Playoffs Coach 1974 5-4-0 Fourth Did not qualify John Murio 1975 6-4-0 Second Lost in first round John Murio 1976 4-5-0 Fourth Did not qualify John Murio 1977 7-4-0 Tied for first Lost in quarterfinals John Murio 1978 9-4-0 Third Won championship John Murio 1979 10-1-0 First Lost in quarterfinals John Murio 1980 7-3-1 Tied for first Lost in first round Bill Crow 1981 13-0-1 First Won championship Bill Crow 1982 8-2-1 First Lost in quarterfinals Bill Crow 1983 7-5-0 Third Lost in quarterfinals Bill Crow 1984 8-3-2 Second Lost in semifinals Bill Crow 1985 11-2-1 Third Lost in finals Bill Crow 1986 8-5-0 Third Lost in semifinals Bill Crow 1987 11-2-0 First Lost in semifinals Bill Crow 1988 12-1-0 First Lost in semifinals Mike Rush 1989 10-3-0 Third Lost in semifinals Mike Rush 1990 11-2-0 First Lost in semifinals Mike Rush 1991 7-4-0 Third Lost in first round Mike Rush 1992 5-6-0 Third Lost in first round Mike Rush 1993 4-6-0 Fifth Did not qualify Marty Spalding</TEXT>
