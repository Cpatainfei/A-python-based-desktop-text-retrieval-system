   <TEXT> From Karl Schoenberger ( &quot; In Search of Mr. Kato , &quot; Oct . 9 ) , regarding the enigmatic landscape_architect credited with designing the Japanese garden in Sierra Madre in 1916 : An intriguing clue about Kato ' s existence surfaced in early October , just after the article had gone_to press . Kuniko Brown , wife and research assistant to USC art history scholar Kendall Brown , was browsing through the collection at the Japanese Community Pioneer Center Library in Little Tokyo when she picked_up an old book in Japanese titled &quot; Zoengaku Hanron &quot; ( &quot; Introduction to Landscape_Architecture &quot; ) . To her surprise , she came_across a reference_to a certain Tokutaro Kato , named as one of two prominent Japanese landscapers active in the &quot; southern Pacific coast &quot; of the United States in the 1920s . The book , written by essayist Keiji Uehara and published in Japan in 1924 , also mentions several private Japanese gardens built_in &quot; Shiera Madure &quot; ( Sierra Madre ) and elsewhere in the Pasadena area but does not link any of these specifically to Kato . The Browns followed_up_on this lead by consulting old city directories in English and Japanese to see if they could find any further trace of the gardener . Nothing has surfaced so far , and the identity of Sierra Madre ' s Kato , even if his first_name was Tokutaro , remains a mystery .</TEXT>
