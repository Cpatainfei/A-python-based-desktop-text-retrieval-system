   <HEADLINE> WOES OF A REAL_ESTATE EMPIRE ; BALDWIN CO . KEEPS SOLID STANCE IN FACE OF SKEPTICISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The tuxedoed Baldwin brothers were all smiles as they strolled through the ballroom of the Four Seasons hotel in Newport Beach , listening to the fizz of champagne , the rustle of sequined socialites and the glowing accolades of their peers in the real_estate industry . During the $ 2 # 700-a-table charity dinner held last spring to honor longtime Orange County home builders Alfred E . and James P . Baldwin , Auxiliary Bishop Michael Driscoll of the Diocese of Orange blessed the brothers and their ventures -- a blessing that seemed already bestowed , given the $ 155-million junk_bond deal that Baldwin Co . had completed 10 months earlier and the $ 60-million credit_line it had arranged with General Electric Capital Corp . Befitting the glitzy occasion , the bishop was followed by a king , as home-building giant William Lyon mounted the podium at the May 18 dinner to praise the Baldwins for their fiscal acumen . In a humorous aside , Lyon called the Baldwins ' bond deal &quot; the great train robbery of 1993. &quot; Ironically , that remark now reflects critics ' skeptical view of the company . Former executives allege that bondholders were misled , and some investors are nervous about the firm ' s financial_condition . Since collecting the bond money a year ago , Baldwin Co . has seen its management team collapse , much to the dismay of those investors who bought the company ' s IOUs partly because of their faith in that team . The company also has left a trail of unpaid and unhappy subcontractors and has angered hundreds of Anaheim Hills homeowners by failing to build a long-promised community park . Today , Baldwin Co . is scheduled to make the second of its semi-annual bond interest payments , and company President Al Baldwin says the $ 8.5-million check will be in the mail . The company must pay about $ 17 million each year in bond interest -- a big chunk of its annual cash flow . In public documents , the company reports it had earnings of $ 28.5 million before interest in 1993 , down from $ 38.2 million the previous year . For the first_quarter of 1994 , the company reported a $ 4-million profit , down 13 % from $ 4.6 million a year earlier , and said that the cost of stepping_up construction activities on its various projects caused it to end the quarter with $ 14.8 million &quot; negative operating cash flow. &quot; With more_than 75 % of the proceeds from last year ' s bond sale gone_to pay_off old debts , the company has little left for ongoing operations . At the end of the first_quarter it also had used_up $ 41.5 million of its $ 60-million credit_line . Al Baldwin said the company ' s financial situation is solid and maintains that suggestions to the contrary are coming from embittered former employees and people who don ' t understand corporate cash management techniques . &quot; Our earnings are up and our sales are up , &quot; he said , pointing_out that the company ' s revenue from home sales jumped 35 % to $ 63 million for the first six months of this year . One indication of how tight_money is at Baldwin Co. , however , is the number of subcontractors who are filing liens against Baldwin projects and lawsuits against the company , alleging that they are not being paid . In the past month , almost $ 1 million worth of claims have been filed_in Orange County Superior_Court against Baldwin Co . and its various subsidiaries . Other claims for non-payment have been filed_in San Diego County . Al Baldwin shrugs_off suggestions that the spate of non-payment suits is an indication of financial trouble . &quot; People look_at the Baldwins as having deep pockets , ( with ) all this money from our bond offering , and some of them think we should pay them for work they haven ' t done , &quot; he said . &quot; But the bond money was used to develop lots and pay_off debt , and now that we ' re going through a major gearing_up and starting a lot of homes , we ' ve had to manage our cash. &quot; In an example of just how tightly managed that cash has been , Baldwin representatives pleaded with Anaheim officials in July for a two-year extension of their deadline to build a community park in the company ' s flagship development , The Summit at Anaheim Hills . The company argued that it cannot afford to build the $ 1.5-million project yet . On another front , the company is facing legal_action filed by two former top managers -- division presidents who say they were forced_out because the Baldwins didn ' t want to pay them what they had been promised . In their suits , former Baldwin Ventura division President Robert Burns and Orange County division President Geoffrey Fearns also allege that the Baldwin brothers misled bond investors by omitting critical information . Burns states in his civil suit that he was told by the Baldwins that he would have a 10 % partnership interest in all company projects within his division , but he alleges that the brothers repeatedly put_off executing a formal , written partnership agreement . The suit alleges , too , that Burns ' partnership agreement was not disclosed to bond investors . Burns was hired to create a Los Angeles-Ventura division for Baldwin and do advance planning for projects . None of the homes planned for the seven projects he identifies in his suit had been built when he left the company in January , but he states in the suit that he is entitled to 10 % of future profits -- an amount he estimates to be &quot; not less than $ 35 million. &quot; Al Baldwin said that Burns is lying and that he is not concerned about the outcome of the suit . &quot; He ' s a lawyer , &quot; he said , &quot; and if there were a partnership agreement it would be in writing . There isn ' t any. &quot; Burns also alleges in his suit that former Baldwin employees Fearns and San Diego division President Gregory Smith were approached by the Baldwin brothers , who tried to &quot; coerce them into engaging in a sham tax transaction. &quot; The brothers , the suit states , wanted Fearns and Smith to agree to have the company &quot; transfer to them certain properties encumbered by substantial indebtedness , in exchange for their partnership interest , &quot; in the properties . The exchange would enable Baldwin Co . to avoid reporting taxable income from the properties , the suit said . Though there is no indication that the Internal Revenue Service has begun investigating Burns ' allegations , Baldwin Co . revealed in its recently filed 1993 annual report that the IRS is examining it for the years 1979 to 1987 and that the result could be a demand for payment of about $ 8.6 million in back taxes . Al Baldwin ' s response to the Burns and Fearns suits is that they were filed to create negative publicity about the company in_order &quot; to leverage us to pay a lot of money they don ' t have coming_to them . And we ' re not going_to pay them for work they didn ' t do. &quot; The fact that Burns , Fearns and Smith all have left the company since the bonds were sold may ultimately have more effect on Baldwin Co . than anything alleged in the lawsuits . Steve Goldman , head of bond_trading at the Los Angeles brokerage Jefferies &amp; Co. , said a large mutual_fund that invested in the Baldwin bonds is very concerned about the exodus . &quot; You start asking questions , &quot; he said , when the management team presented during the sale of a bond issue is gone six months later . Beyond nervous investors and angry former employees , the Baldwin brothers are dealing with other woes . Homeowners who bought homes_in The Summit at Anaheim Hills development partly because the company promised to build a 16-acre park there are complaining about the delay in the park ' s development . At a July 19 public hearing before the Anaheim City_Council , more_than 100 homeowners attended_to express anger over what they characterized as foot-dragging by the company . Even though the start of construction on the park is months overdue , the council negotiated a compromise that requires construction of a playground by early next year but postpones completion of the rest of the park until 1997 . Councilman Frank Feldhaus and other council_members told homeowners at the hearing that they were concerned that Baldwin Co . could be pushed into bankruptcy if the park issue were forced -- and the company ' s representative at the meeting did not step_up to the podium to counter the impression that a single park was all that stood between the company and Bankruptcy Court . Al Baldwin denies bankruptcy is a possibility , and such a scenario certainly would have been unthinkable in the 1980s , when Baldwin Co . consistently ranked among the top 10 builders in Southern California . In the 30 years since it was incorporated , Baldwin Co . has built 15 # 000 homes_in Southern California , most of them in master-planned communities in Orange , San Diego and Ventura counties . &quot; They have some exceptionally well located properties , but it remains to be seen whether they can bring those projects to the market on a timely basis , &quot; said Kenneth Agid , an Irvine real_estate marketing consultant . Baldwin Co . was strapped for cash last year when it turned_to Wall_Street . The company was in default_on more_than $ 100 million of its $ 183 million in debt and had to use most of the bond proceeds to pay_off overdue loans . It was left with only about $ 30 million for new construction . That a company mired so deeply in financial difficulty could sell bonds based on its promises of a rosy future caused other Southern California developers to cheer . After three years of deep recession , they said , the Baldwin deal showed that investors were finally regaining their confidence in Southern California real_estate . Al Baldwin agrees with that : The company ' s valuable land holdings , he said , were more attractive to the investment community than its 30-year history of profitability . The bond issue in July , 1993 , was_well received on Wall_Street . The deal was oversubscribed by hungry investors -- meaning that more bonds were sold than were initially offered . But some traders now say their initial enthusiasm waned quickly . Though the bonds ' value picked_up Friday on the news that the company had completed a $ 14.9-million land sale in San Diego , they had dropped shortly after they were issued last year when the company posted lackluster quarterly returns . Wayne Mueller , managing director of the high-yield department for Bear , Stearns &amp; Co. , the New York brokerage that sold the bonds for the Baldwins , defends the company . &quot; What investors anticipated were the quarterly numbers predicted in the road_show , &quot; such_as home sales and the number of homes built but unsold , he said . &quot; But the Baldwins look_at the big picture. &quot; Because the company is privately owned , he said , it was not as concerned with the differences between quarterly and long-range numbers as a publicly traded company might have been , &quot; so people got a little jittery , &quot; Mueller said . Al Baldwin says that no such numbers were ever tossed_out . &quot; We made no projections on_the_road show or in the prospectus , &quot; he said . &quot; We talked_about our historic performance , about our land holdings and about future product_lines , but we made no projections. &quot; That was not the perception in the investment community . David Siegel , chief financial_officer for Presley Cos. , a Newport Beach home builder , said that the Baldwin bond deal made his company ' s private sale of $ 200 million worth of junk_bonds last month more challenging . &quot; The fact that the Baldwins didn ' t make their numbers , as_many people have stated , really created some caution on the part of bond buyers , &quot; he said . Other analysts see Baldwin Co . in a much more positive light . Barbara Allen , a home building expert with the brokerage Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York and a satisfied owner of a Baldwin condo in Del Mar , said she sees a bright future for some Southern California builders , especially those like Baldwin that have access to Wall_Street . Analyst Kenneth Agid agreed . &quot; They are pioneers , &quot; he said of the Baldwin brothers , &quot; and they have survived what have been some very tough and lean years . Those two are survivors. &quot; The Baldwin Empire Newport Beach-based Baldwin Co . has housing_developments in the works from Ventura to San Diego counties . The company is preparing a massive housing construction effort , partly with proceeds from a successful junk-bond sale last July that netted $ 155 million .
