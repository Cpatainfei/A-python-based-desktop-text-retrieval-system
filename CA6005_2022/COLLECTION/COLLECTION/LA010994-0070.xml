   <HEADLINE> POP EYE : THE ' 94 LIST : STONES VS . STONE ROSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Coming_off a record sales year , the pop world is counting_on a highly diverse array of key albums to maintain the 1993 momentum . Who knows whether the next 12 months can duplicate the phenomenal sales punch of 1993 , during which the &quot; Bodyguard &quot; soundtrack album sold 10 million copies , g-style rappers became household names ( can you say Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg ? Sure you can ) and the sophomore jinx was defied by alternative rockers Nirvana and Pearl Jam ? Based on the albums drawing the most early attention , industry insiders are optimistic because the coming months offer the same kind of diverse pop lineup that characterized 1993 . Here are 10 of the collections that are likely to generate the most attention during the first_half of 1994 : * Ice_Cube and Dr. Dre -- The teaming of the N.W.A. alumni could give us the rap album of the year . Tentatively titled &quot; Helter Skelter , &quot; the collection , which could be in the stores as early as June , matches Cube ( arguably the most acclaimed West Coast rapper ) and Dre ( unarguably the most talented producer in all_of rap ) . * Nine Inch Nails -- Trent Reznor , the one-man industrial music wizard , releases in March his first full-length follow-up to 1990 ' s groundbreaking &quot; Pretty Hate Machine. &quot; Titled &quot; The Downward Spiral , &quot; the album was partially recorded in the Benedict Canyon home that was the scene of the Manson Family murder of Sharon Tate and four others . Reznor set_up a home studio , which he calls &quot; Pig , &quot; in the rented house . * Arrested Development -- After winning Grammys as the best new artist and best rap_group of 1992 , the Atlanta outfit expects to have its follow-up completed in time for a summer release . * Lyle Lovett -- The country-pop singer-songwriter has finished &quot; Creeps Like Me , &quot; his first album since 1992 ' s &quot; Joshua Judges Ruth &quot; -- and his first since his celebrated marriage last July to actress Julia Roberts . It ' s due in the spring . Lovett also will be featured on a soul-meets-country duet collection whose participants include Al Green , Natalie Cole , Vince Gill and Gladys Knight . It ' s scheduled for March release . * Bonnie Raitt -- The blues-based rocker , whose 1991 &quot; Luck of the Draw &quot; proved to be an even bigger commercial success than 1989 ' s &quot; Nick of Time , &quot; returns in March with &quot; Longing in Their Hearts. &quot; * Soundgarden -- Although one of the most respected bands in the Seattle grunge scene , this band has been somewhat overshadowed by the success of Nirvana and Pearl Jam . A &amp; M is hoping that &quot; Superunknown , &quot; due in March , will correct that . * Red Hot Chili_Peppers -- Currently on its fourth guitarist ( Dave Navarro , from Jane ' s Addiction ) , the Los Angeles funk-punk pioneers are aiming for a midsummer release for the follow-up to their mainstream breakthrough , &quot; Blood_Sugar Sex Magik. &quot; * The Stone Roses -- After a five-year delay , the Manchester quartet ' s upcoming &quot; Second Coming &quot; couldn ' t be more aptly titled . When Geffen Records signed the critically acclaimed group after its 1989 album made_it the toast of British rock , the Roses seemed poised to storm the U.S. charts . But after all this time , is anyone still waiting for the group ' s second album ? If so , they ' ll find it in the stores in March . * Hole -- In a dazzling Palace show last November , the punk-spawned band , led by volatile and charismatic Courtney Love , played a collection of new songs that reflected a vitality and depth that could earn Hole a place on the national charts . Let ' s hope that those songs will dominate the April album . * The Rolling Stones -- You never know with these guys . Just when you count them out , they can pop_up with another gem , a la 1978 ' s &quot; Some Girls &quot; or 1981 ' s &quot; Tattoo You. &quot; But we certainly didn ' t get one with the 1989 tour ' s leaden &quot; Steel Wheels. &quot; Heidi Siegmund</TEXT>
