   <HEADLINE> DEATH ROW ISN ' T A HIGH-INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD , NATION ' S LEGAL EXPERTS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is a pretty good bet that if Erik and Lyle Menendez are convicted , they will not wind_up on Death Row . It is not a place for the rich . In California , every one of the 384 men and four women awaiting execution as of July 1 was poor enough to qualify for a lawyer at state expense , said Lynn Holton , spokeswoman for the state Judicial Council . Nationwide , no one seems to have made a systematic study of the finances of the executed , or of the 2 # 700 condemned prisoners . But veteran practitioners and scholars agreed they ' d never heard of a wealthy_person on Death Row . &quot; I don ' t know of any affluent people who have been sentenced to death , &quot; said Walter Berns , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and author of the 1978 book &quot; For Capital Punishment. &quot; &quot; The death_penalty is for poor people , &quot; said Stephen Bright , director of the Southern Center for Human_Rights in Atlanta and a defense_lawyer in capital cases for 15 years . Wealthy people have faced capital charges : * Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold , young sons of wealthy families and the &quot; thrill killers &quot; convicted of murdering a young boy , were spared the death_penalty in 1924 after an epic defense by Clarence Darrow that focused_on their mental_states . * Texas oilman T . Cullen Davis , charged with seriously wounding his estranged wife , Priscilla , and murdering her lover and her 12-year-old daughter in 1976 . Although his wife and two other eyewitnesses identified Davis as the gunman , he was acquitted after a defense by prominent lawyer Richard ( Racehorse ) Haynes , who attacked Mrs . Davis for her drug use and extramarital affairs . * Joe Hunt , leader of a group of wealthy youths called the Billionaire Boys Club , convicted in 1987 of murdering a Beverly Hills con_man whose body has never been found . A jury rejected a death sentence and chose life without parole for Hunt , who is seeking a new trial . Like the Menendez brothers , those defendants could afford to hire good lawyers . &quot; If you have money and can afford adequate counsel , you don ' t end_up on Death Row , &quot; said Kica Matos , capital_punishment research_director for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund . &quot; Trying capital cases is the legal equivalent of brain surgery , &quot; Bright said . In the South , he said , court-appointed death_penalty lawyers are paid barely enough to cover costs , are usually inexperienced , and often don ' t put_up much of a fight . &quot; I see cases tried with no experts for the defense , no investigator at all , and seldom one who knows how to investigate the life and background of the defendant , &quot; Bright said . One Georgia case he described in a Yale Law Journal article . Gary X . Nelson , sentenced to death in the 1978 rape and murder of a 6-year-old girl , was represented by a lawyer who had never tried a capital case , was paid $ 15 to $ 20 an hour and had no investigator or experts . His closing argument was 255 words long . Later , new lawyers , working_at their own expense , found that crucial prosecution evidence , a hair on the victim ' s body , could not be validly compared to Nelson ' s hair -- a fact mentioned in an FBI report that had never been disclosed . Nelson was freed after 11 years on Death Row . But in California , for example , defense_lawyers exaggerate the extent of ineffective representation in death cases , said state Deputy Atty . Gen . Dane Gillette , death-penalty coordinator in San Francisco . Probably the chief reason rich people aren ' t sentenced to die , Gillette said , is that &quot; they , for the most part , don ' t commit these kinds of violent crimes. &quot;</TEXT>
