   <HEADLINE> ' ONE STRIKE ' RAPE BILL PASSED BY STATE SENATE ; CAPITOL : O.C. LEGISLATOR ' S TOUGH SENTENCING MEASURE NOW GOES TO GOVERNOR , WHO HAS SAID HE WILL SIGN IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Legislature on Wednesday gave final passage to one of the most hotly debated crime bills of the year , sending to Gov . Pete Wilson an Orange County lawmaker ' s measure to require up_to life in prison for first-time , violent rapists and child_molesters . The rape bill , sponsored by Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) , won final approval in the Senate on a 39-0 vote . Racing toward a scheduled midnight adjournment of the two-year legislative session , lawmakers also passed a comprehensive overhaul of the state ' s campaign finance laws that would limit contributions and spending and allow partial taxpayer financing of legislative campaigns . But the governor is expected to veto the measure because of his objections to public financing of campaigns . A proposal to establish a new , full-time commission to regulate gambling in California died after intense back-room negotiations as the session was drawing to a close . Also rejected when lawmakers went_home for the year were measures to place bonds on the November ballot to pay_for construction of school classrooms , prisons and libraries . Orange County lawmakers saw several measures score victories , and a_few others fall to defeat . A bill from Assemblyman Tom Umberg ( D-Garden Grove ) to make possession of child pornography a felony was dashed after Republicans , who had supported the bill earlier this year , balked because of fears it might undermine the state ' s three-strikes law . But another Umberg bill to toughen reporting procedures for sex offenders was sent to the governor ' s desk . Assemblywoman Doris Allen ( R-Cypress ) won approval for a bill that directs schools to punish pupils for hate crimes , but a measure that would have toughened vagrancy laws to keep gang members from stalking school campuses died . A measure by Assemblyman Curt Pringle ( R-Garden Grove ) that gives the Balboa Bay Club a lease extension that will pave the way for a much-anticipated renovation project was approved , as was a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) designed to help Laguna Beach High_School , which has been hurt by declining revenues since last year ' s devastating fire . Meanwhile , Laguna Niguel city officials came_up short in their effort to push a bill that would allowed them to recapture $ 450 # 000 in revenue they lost during last year ' s state budget battle . The city faced stiff opposition from the county of Orange , which would have lost the revenue , and Bergeson , who is unopposed for a Board of Supervisors seat . Bergeson played the key role in getting the bill killed , pulling it into her Local_Government Committee and then refusing to conduct a hearing . On other matters : * The Senate protested Wilson ' s environmental policies by adjourning without confirming Jacqueline Schafer , the governor ' s choice to lead the state Air Resources Board . Schafer now must leave_office in November , one year after Wilson appointed her to head the regulatory board . Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) said the members had no particular problem with Schafer , a former assistant secretary_of_the_Navy , but wanted to send a message to Wilson that they are unhappy with what they perceive as his tilt in favor of the oil_industry in air quality matters . * A bill that critics say would cut corners on the cleanup of selected toxic dump sites in the state won bipartisan approval in the Senate and Assembly and now goes_to the governor . The measure , by Sen . Charles M . Calderon ( D-Whittier ) , is an attempt to speed the cleanup and settlement of financial responsibility for up_to 30 hazardous waste sites covered by the state Superfund program . It sets_up an arbitration procedure for deciding how clean a site should be , depending_on its use , and for allocating costs among those responsible_for the contamination . Calderon said the new approach is needed to unclog a system that has barely begun the job of cleaning_up thousands of contaminated sites . But the measure , which came_to_life in the final weeks of the session , has alarmed environmental groups , who fear that it will allow incomplete cleanups and leave taxpayers liable for costs . Leading the opposition , Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) contended that the bill would allow some sites to be covered over and developed without being completely cleaned_up . The Assembly approved the measure 48 to 26 ; the Senate 21 to 11 . * The Senate , reversing itself , sent the governor a bill that would make_it illegal for employers to deny women the option of wearing pantsuits or slacks to work . Sen . Lucy Killea ( I-San Diego ) , who previously had opposed the bill on grounds that it trivialized advancements made by women , cast the decisive 21st vote . A spokesman said Wilson has not yet taken a position on the bill . * The Senate , on a 21-11 vote , sent to Wilson a bill to overhaul a controversial new school performance test , formerly known as the California Learning Assessment System . The bill would give parents a larger role in the development of the test and bar certain questions that would elicit comments from students on their personal beliefs about family life , sex , morality or religion . Wilson is expected to veto the measure because it does not provide_for individual assessments for each student in every school . His veto would kill the testing program , which only a year ago was being hailed as a model for the nation . Bergeson ' s rape bill , is expected to be signed by Wilson , who since 1990 has campaigned for longer rape sentences and made this measure one of his top legislative priorities this year . But the governor would have preferred to sentence all rapists to life in prison without possibility of parole . When Bergeson first introduced the measure in the tougher form desired by Wilson , it drew broad attacks from civil libertarians and other groups , including some district_attorneys and women ' s organizations , who said the measure was so harsh it might hinder prosecutions or prompt sex offenders to kill their victims . The bill was redrafted to delete all references_to life without parole , substituting a penalty of 25 years to life for only the most brutal sexual_assaults -- those involving torture , mayhem , kidnaping or burglary with the intent to commit rape . Lesser sex crimes could earn sentences of 15 years to life , but would have to include special circumstances such_as the use of a firearm or dangerous weapon , more_than one victim or the administering of narcotics . Now , the maximum term for a single rape is eight years in prison , and the average convicted rapist spends fewer than five years behind bars . &quot; This is a very strong bill , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; It ' s the product of a strong effort by the Legislature . Sex crimes simply cannot be tolerated . This bill responds in a very strong way. &quot; Sean Walsh , the governor ' s spokesman , said : &quot; This is the toughest piece of crime legislation targeting rapists and child_molesters to ever hit the desk of a governor . We would prefer an even stronger bill and will strive in the future for a stronger one , but are pleased with this legislation. &quot; Aside from the one-strike bill , Bergeson pushed_through a bill that increases fines and jail time for domestic violence . The Umberg anti-pornography bill prompted one of the final day ' s more heated debates . Republican lawmakers said they opposed that bill because Democratic chieftains inserted an amendment exempting it from the three-strikes law . Democrat leaders have been inserting such amendments into a number of crime bills this year because they believe only violent felonies should be eligible for a third strike . Republicans , however , said that such moves threatened to open the flood gates to exemptions that would undermine the three-strikes law . Umberg said he wished the three-strikes amendment hadn ' t been added_to his bill , but argued that Republicans should support it to put tougher pornography penalties in place . His arguments drew the wrath of a fellow Orange County lawmaker , Assemblyman Ross Johnson ( R-Fullerton ) , who hounded Umberg repeatedly . &quot; Don ' t play your damn cheap political games with us , &quot; Johnson roared at Umberg . &quot; You ' re absolutely right , &quot; Umberg barked back . &quot; We shouldn ' t play political games. &quot; The Assembly passed and sent to Wilson ' s desk on a 42-32 vote a bill imposing limits on campaign contributions and spending and providing limited public funding for legislative candidates . The measure , by Senate President Lockyer , would limit contributions in legislative races to $ 2 # 000 from individuals and corporations and $ 5 # 000 from political_action_committees . The limits would apply separately to the primaries and general_elections . Spending also would be capped , at about $ 800 # 000 in state Senate_races and $ 560 # 000 in Assembly races , adjusted each year according to the number of voters in the state . The spending limits would apply only to candidates who accepted the partial public financing that the bill would create . The public financing would match private contributions raised by the candidates on a ratio ranging from 5-1 to 2-1 , depending_on the size of the private donation . Candidates whose opponents exceeded the spending limit would get extra public funds . The Assembly passed the bill on a straight party_line vote , with Democrats for it and Republicans against . Assemblywoman Debra Bowen ( D-Marina del Rey ) , a member of the conference committee that fashioned the bill , called the legislation a &quot; good start toward campaign finance reform. &quot; She added : &quot; The people don ' t care what the fine points are of campaign finance reform . They simply want us to put a system in place that caps the effect of special_interest money on elections . And their view of the world is that the Legislature spends all_of its time in the member ' s lounge playing Yahtzee with the people ' s money rather than doing the public ' s business . We need to restore public faith in the Legislature. &quot; But Ross Johnson , who is also a member of the conference committee , urged a no vote . &quot; We absolutely need campaign finance reform , &quot; Johnson said , &quot; but this bill doesn ' t do_it . What you are doing is creating an open-ended entitlement to funding politicians ' campaigns . It is an unfair system designed to help Democrats and hurt Republicans. &quot; The fight over the future regulation of the state ' s gambling industry went_down to the wire Wednesday night after a measure backed by Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren to establish a five-member statewide gambling control commission was bottled_up in the Senate Rules Committee . Supporters sought to revive the proposal but said they could not overcome opposition from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) and Wilson . Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg ( D-San Francisco ) , who pushed the gaming proposal , cited a combination of reasons , including Wilson ' s desire to control all five &quot; patronage appointments &quot; to the commission and Brown ' s reluctance to support &quot; strict regulation of gambling. &quot;</TEXT>
