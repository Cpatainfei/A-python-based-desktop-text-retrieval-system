   <HEADLINE> NARCOTICS LINK IN COLOSIO ' S DEATH DISMISSED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The attorney_general ' s office Thursday played_down allegations by a former justice official that the assassination of a presidential candidate in March may have been entangled in a web of drugs and politics . In a statement responding to testimony given by Eduardo Valle Espinosa to Mexican authorities last month at a closed-door hearing in Washington , the office of Atty . Gen . Humberto Benitez Trevino said Valle had provided no proof of his key allegations . Valle , formerly a senior aide in the attorney_general ' s office , has said he has evidence that local drug lords tied to Colombia ' s Cali cartel have infiltrated the upper reaches of Mexican politics and may have masterminded the killing of ruling party candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio . He said there is a &quot; concrete possibility &quot; that officials being paid by Mexican cocaine kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego helped plan and carry_out the assassination . The attorney_general ' s office stated Thursday that Valle &quot; said there were several grave deficiencies in the security organization of the candidate Colosio , without providing any proof that would back his allegations or show any responsibility of the citizens he has mentioned. &quot;</TEXT>
