   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN ALBUM : A GAME OF KING OF THE HILL AT DEVILS MONUMENT ; PLAINS INDIANS SAY THE MOUNTAIN IS HOLY GROUND . BUT TO ROCK_CLIMBERS , IT ' S A PLAYGROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For centuries , Plains Indians have made pilgrimages to the 860-foot-high volcanic monolith rising over this northeast corner of Wyoming to seek religious visions and leave prayer bundles of tobacco and sage . But in recent years , the massive stone pillar known as Devils Tower has become better known for the challenge it provides_for up_to 6 # 000 climbers a year from around the world . Now , Native_Americans who revere the rock as a religious shrine are at_odds with climbers who get another kind of high by scaling what in 1906 became the first national_monument in the United States . Native_Americans are petitioning the federal_government to ban the climbers , who they say desecrate a holy site by riveting its face with bolts -- even urinating on its walls . They also complain that increased climbing and tourism make_it impossible to hear the Great Spirit who , tradition says , created the Sioux here . &quot; All hell would break lose if I went_to climbing the Washington Monument or the National Cathedral , &quot; argued Francis Brown , an Arapaho and president of the Medicine Wheel Coalition for Sacred Sites of North_America , which wants to protect Devils Tower and dozens of other sacred locations . &quot; Our plan is to shut the climbing_down , slowly if that is what it takes. &quot; No way , said Andy Petefish , who runs a climbing service near the tower and strongly objects to what he claims is an attempt to destroy a federal mandate that provides_for multiple uses of the monument , including recreation . &quot; As far as I ' m concerned , prayer bundles are a bunch of trash , and I ' m very offended to have them hanging_around the monument , &quot; Petefish said . &quot; They ( monument officials ) should be managing climbing based on quantifiable , scientific_research on its impact on the tower , not on one group ' s religious beliefs. &quot; Besides , he added , &quot; the Indians get_to build fires in the most beautiful meadow in the park for their sweat lodge and Sun_Dance ceremonies , but they don ' t climb that rock , which I own as an American citizen. &quot; Not all_of the tower ' s climbers are that intransigent on the issue . Nonetheless , the dispute is especially thorny for National_Park_Service officials trying to forge a compromise . There is little doubt , however , about which side the Park Service has favored in past years . Exhibits at the monument ' s visitors center -- housed in a log_cabin built_in the 1930s -- emphasize climbing history over Native_American tradition . During summer months , park rangers don climbing gear several times a day to demonstrate &quot; handholds and foot jams &quot; on a replica of part of a tower wall . &quot; The Park Service has done a poor job of including the Native_American cultural perspective , &quot; conceded George San Miguel , chief of resource management at the monument . &quot; History , &quot; he said , &quot; did not begin here in 1875. &quot; That year , Chief Red Cloud and other Sioux chiefs met with federal_officials in Washington to discuss the transfer of mineral rights in the Black Hills , the northwest corner of which is anchored by Devils Tower -- at that time part of the Great Sioux Reservation . At the same time , miners and surveyors with a government-sponsored expedition were scouting for gold and dubbed the imposing natural citadel Devils Tower , a name Native_Americans still consider offensive . Within a_few years , the government removed the gold-bearing Black Hills from the reservation , paving the way for white settlers who developed ranches near the tower . In 1893 , two of those early ranchers pounded large stakes into one of thousands of cracks in the tower -- composed of vertical four- , six- and eight-sided gray stone columns up_to eight feet in diameter -- and made the first ascent to the summit . Since then , 65 # 000 climbers have had a go at the tower . Their legacy : nearly 600 bolts pounded into its walls . But with the growing popularity of climbing here and elsewhere on federal lands , government officials in 1991 began reviewing the impact of the sport on natural_resources . National_Park officials created a task_force of climbers , Native_Americans and local officials to come_up with a management policy amenable to all sides . Their plan calls_for a voluntary climbing ban each June , when important Plains Indian ceremonies are performed . Monument officials hope to have the plan finalized by January and implemented this spring . But the dispute may be far from over . If the voluntary closure fails , the Park Service has already threatened to impose a mandatory June climbing ban . If that happens , climber groups would be almost certain to take their argument to court . &quot; Unfortunately for us , &quot; said Jerry Flute of the nonprofit Assn . of American_Indian Affairs , &quot; our sacred sites are in very beautiful places where federal land managers are promoting their tourism value , including climbing. &quot;</TEXT>
