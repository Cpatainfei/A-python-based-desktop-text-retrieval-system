   <HEADLINE> WORLD_VIEW ; THE FUSE STILL SIZZLES ON WORLD POPULATION BOMB ; INDIA IS EMBLEMATIC . IT LOWERED FERTILITY_RATES , BUT THE NUMBERS KEEP GROWING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Almost half a century after the first alert about the Earth ' s swelling population , humankind has entered a critical transition . And no place is more representative of the change than Bombay , which doubles as India ' s wealthiest city and home to Asia ' s largest slum , the notorious Dharavi . Dharavi , a former garbage_dump , has been blanketed by almost a_million squatters fleeing the poverty of rural India . Hundreds more arrive weekly to live_in the stinking squalor of tattered burlap and rag huts , with no access to running water or electricity and only one public_toilet for every few dozen families . Women rely_on a polluted marsh for cleaning . Barefoot , ill-clad tots play in dusty alleys . Many of their preteen siblings are already scrambling for work . Dharavi symbolizes teeming India , now expected to crack the 1-billion population level by the year 2000 -- and then to surpass China as the world ' s most populous country by 2035 . Yet Bombay also reflects a changing India . The world ' s oldest official family-planning program , headquartered in the bustling port city , is estimated to have helped India avert at least 90 million births -- equivalent_to the population of Mexico -- since the 1950s through a mix of voluntary and coercive programs . Now , as the 21st Century nears , India is a microcosm of the world , with both good news and bad . &quot; We ' ve made enormous progress in the use of family-planning methods around the world . Over the past 30 years , use of birth_control in developing countries has increased from 10 % of couples to about 55 % , &quot; said Dr. J . Joseph Speidel , president of Population Action International ( PAI ) , a nonprofit research organization in Washington . &quot; The average number of children per woman has declined from six to 3.6 -- more_than half the distance to a two-child family , &quot; he said . An average of 2.1 children per woman is considered replacement level -- or zero growth . In India , traditional patterns are shifting significantly . Birth_control is now used by 45 % of married_couples . In Bombay , the practice of birth_control has increased in five years from 40 % to 56 % of couples , according to U.N. reports . These breakthroughs do not , however , mean a decline in the number of the Earth ' s inhabitants . &quot; Absolute growth &quot; is still adding ever-greater numbers . &quot; The bad news is that the number of young people entering childbearing years is so large that the absolute size of world population is growing . The yearly increase in population has risen from 75 million in 1969 to 93 million today , &quot; Speidel said . Even after fertility_rates fall , absolute increases continue through a whole life_cycle , or about 70 years -- a phenomenon called &quot; population momentum. &quot; So the world is still a long way from stabilizing its numbers . Despite India ' s declining fertility_rate , for example , its population doubled from 342 million to 685 million in 34 years -- between 1947 and 1981 . Less than 13 years later , it has reached 897 million , or almost triple the 1947 total , according to PAI . The numbers are taking a mounting toll on quality_of_life . &quot; Bombay is a city built for 2 million trying to cope_with 12 million and faced with up_to 16 million by 2000 , &quot; said Avadia Wadia , who founded India ' s Family_Planning Assn . in 1951 and is the leader of India ' s population movement . &quot; A half-century ago these avenues were_full of blossoming trees , and we had beautiful beaches . Now there aren ' t many trees left , and over half the population lives in slums . And compared with some of them , Dharavi is almost a showcase. &quot; On the eve of the U.N. Conference on Population and Development in Cairo , which is scheduled for Sept . 5-13 , U.N. experts offer three predictions about how the so-called &quot; demographic transition &quot; will end . * The best-case scenario is a uniform worldwide decline to 1.9 births per family , lower than replacement level . World population would then increase from today ' s 5.6 billion to a peak of 8 billion in 2050 , and then decline to 5.6 billion by 2150 . * The medium scenario is a slower decline to replacement-level fertility , stabilizing population at 11.5 billion people , more_than double current numbers , by 2150 . * The worst-case scenario is a continuation of current reduced fertility_rates but no further declines . By 2150 , the world would then have 694 billion people -- 124 times today ' s total . The worst case is staggering because humankind took untold millennia to reach its first billion in 1800 . And it is even more daunting because it doesn ' t allow_for a small lapse to previous fertility patterns . The impact on some countries would be devastating long before 2150 . India already squeezes 16 % of the world ' s people onto 2.4 % of the Earth ' s land . Without further inroads in slowing growth_rates , its population will triple again over the next half-century , according to PAI figures . &quot; Even in the best case , even if birthrates are_on a continuous drop , we ' re going to add a_billion people every 10 or 11 years well into the next century , &quot; said Carl Haub , demographer at the Population Reference Bureau , a private research organization . &quot; Unless we bring the numbers down , we will face economic , development and health_problems of a magnitude that we don ' t know yet . Many developing countries won ' t be able to deal with them . And the developed world won ' t be able to bail them out. &quot; Of the three scenarios , the second is now most likely , demographers predict , due_to changes in both the problem and responses to it since the first summit of experts in Rome in 1954 drew attention to what became known as the &quot; population bomb. &quot; One basic change since then is that population is no longer framed solely in terms of teeming masses of new babies . Of growing importance is the older generation . Since India attained its independence in 1947 , for example , average life_expectancy in the country -- which mirrors statistics in the developing world -- has increased from 32 to 59 years , said Wadia , the Bombay population authority . Improved living conditions and health_care in the 20th Century have effectively produced a whole new generation at the top . India , with more_than 54 million , and China have the world ' s largest populations over 60 . Wadia is herself over 80 . &quot; It is declining mortality , not rising fertility , that is causing the current population surge . Over the past 40 years , fertility_rates have fallen_in most parts of the world . But because death rates have dropped even more steeply , the absolute number of births has gone_up , &quot; said Laurie Ann Mazur , editor of &quot; Beyond the Numbers , &quot; a new anthology on population . In the past four decades , life_expectancy has increased from 66 to 75 years in wealthy countries . By 2030 , the worldwide average will rise to 72 years , while the average person in some developed countries will live well into the 80s , according to the World_Bank . And living beyond 100 will not be unusual . But new issues can in turn create new complications . &quot; The problems of an aging society include housing , economic support and health_care . As people live longer , society requires a different type of medical_care and medicines , &quot; said M . Faith Mitchell , senior State_Department coordinator for population . Developing regions will be most challenged . Like the majority of countries , India has no social_security . Elsewhere , socialism ' s demise and subsidy cutbacks as part of economic restructuring have left many elderly with few benefits to fall_back on . &quot; We are not accustomed to people living so_long . In the next five or six years , we ' ll have to make care_for the aging one of the components of our planning , &quot; said Maher Mahran , Egypt ' s population and family_planning minister . Singapore has already started . Fearful that its aging population will become dependent_on a safety net designed for the poor , Singapore ' s Parliament debated a bill this year allowing elderly parents to sue their children for maintenance if they are abandoned financially . By 2025 , 25 % of Singapore ' s population is expected to be over 60 . About 10 % is over 60 now . A second conspicuous feature of the demographic transition is an unprecedented imbalance in numbers , both within countries and between them . India ' s biggest breakthrough has been in Kerala , a southwestern state of 29 million people , denser than Bangladesh and more populous than Canada . Per capita income there is among India ' s lowest . Yet Kerala ' s fertility_rate of 2.2 children per woman is almost at replacement level , only a fraction higher than the U.S. average of 2.1. Kerala ' s birthrate is now a third lower than that in the rest of India . &quot; In the 1950s , we had a problem in every part of this country . Now , the goals of population programs have been reached in Kerala and much of the south , &quot; Wadia said . &quot; About a third of the country has completed or is passing_through the demographic transition. &quot; At the other extreme is Uttar Pradesh , India ' s northeastern state of 140 million . As a separate country , it would be the world ' s seventh-most-populous nation . Its fertility_rate of 5.5 is also among the world ' s highest . The imbalance is mirrored around the world . The populations of 58 countries will grow by more_than 100 % over the next 35 years , and 20 countries will grow by more_than 150 % , according to a new_World Bank survey . The six fastest-growing areas are Oman , the Gaza Strip , Niger , Yemen , Ethiopia and Angola . Not all Third_World countries are problem areas . In Thailand , couples using contraceptives rose from 10 % in 1970 to 67 % in 1987 . The average number of children plummeted from 6.2 to 2.4 per woman , PAI reports . And between 1960 and 1990 , Third_World women using contraceptives increased from 18 % to 50 % , the Population Reference Bureau ( PRB ) reports . Yet until the year 2030 , 95 % of population growth will be in the Third_World , most where income averages less than $ 2 a day . &quot; For many countries , population growth will keep outstripping their ability to provide_for people . It ' ll be a perpetual quest , like Alice in Wonderland -- going as fast as you can but still not_able to get there , &quot; said Kaval Gulhati , Indian-born co-founder of the Center for Development and Population Activities , which is_active in the former East Bloc and in the Third_World . In contrast , the developed world has basically made the transition . Japan ' s fertility_rate plunged from 5.1 children per woman in 1925 to 1.53 children per woman in 1991 , PRB reports . Six European states have even lower rates . Italy averages only 1.3 children per woman . And authorities in France , Germany , Luxembourg , Switzerland , Bulgaria and Hungary have told the United Nations that their birthrates are too low . The implications of the imbalance are vast . Jobs will be a major challenge , the U.N. Population Fund reports . Developing countries will have to create 30 million jobs yearly just to maintain current employment levels . Although food production has kept_up with population growth on paper , distribution is uneven . One in eight people on Earth now does not have enough to eat . And in Africa , where population is expected to grow 3 % per year through 2000 , the food supply is projected to grow only 2 % , contributing to a 50 % increase in the number of poor , the International Food Policy Research Institute reports . And the limit of production may have been reached . &quot; The world ' s fishermen and farmers can no longer keep_up with the growth in world population . This means that providing seafood and grain for the 90 million people being added each year is possible only by reducing consumption by those already here , &quot; said Lester Brown , president of Worldwatch Institute and author of &quot; Full House , &quot; a new report on population and resources . &quot; Before this decade is over , food security may replace military security as a principal preoccupation of governments , &quot; he said . The numbers crunch will be most severe in cities . In 15 years , 368 cities in the developing world will have more_than a_million inhabitants , according to the United Nations . Because most don ' t have the resources or infrastructures to cope , vast numbers of people will live_in slums . With annual population growth of 4 % , Bombay faces a shortage of 2.5 million houses by 2000 , when 75 % of its estimated 16 million people will live_in huts or on the pavement , Indian demographers predict . Housing is already so tight in Bombay that the sturdier shanties in Dharavi sell for hundreds of dollars . &quot; The rapid , unprecedented pace of population growth dwarfs all trends in terms of its implications for the future of human , national and international security , &quot; said Timothy E . Wirth , U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs . &quot; Human security is about the 1 billion individuals who live_in abject poverty . It is about the 800 million who go hungry every day and the 240 million malnourished , the 1.3 billion without clean water and more_than 2 billion without safe sanitation. &quot; All those factors contribute to tension . Population is considered a component , for example , in the breakdown of order in Rwanda and Somalia . Dharavi has twice been the site of deadly clashes , while Uttar Pradesh has a long history of communal violence in which population plays a role . &quot; Whether within countries or between regions , an imbalance raises the likelihood of conflict . When one country or group of people is doing_well and others are not , one group wants more , and the other wants to hang_on to what they have . This mitigates against peace , &quot; said Mitchell , the State_Department ' s population official . Swelling population in developing countries also makes the likelihood of catastrophic economic harm from natural disasters four times greater and heavy death tolls twice as likely , according to a 1994 U.N. survey . As numbers increase , people are forced to settle in disaster-prone areas . Dharavi , for example , borders a marsh . During the dry_season , the newer huts precariously abut its murky waters . During the rainy_season , many are flooded , forcing families to move again , sometimes onto Bombay sidewalks . Elsewhere , imbalances can contribute to reversals . In Europe , dwindling ranks of young workers and soaring numbers of pensioners have led some governments to adopt policies -- boosting maternity and child_care benefits -- to slow population declines . Imbalances are also reflected regionally , according to a new_World Bank report . Between 1995 and 2030 , Africa ' s population will increase 116 % , while North_America ' s will grow only 24 % . Asia ' s will increase 47 % , while Europe ' s will grow by only 1 % . As the issues change , so do the solutions . Since 1951 , India has tried a host of approaches , including coercive promotion of sterilization during the mid-1970s . The backlash brought_down a government , but sterilization and abortion are still provided free . Family_planning is now promoted in street plays and puppet_shows , TV ads , billboard campaigns and outreach programs . Last year , India ' s Parliament even considered a bill banning national and state legislators who had more_than two children . The law would have affected the prime_minister and family welfare minister , both of whom have eight children , as well as 397 of 508 members_of_Parliament , according to Family_Planning World . The measure didn ' t pass . The new model -- for India as well as the developing world -- is Kerala . Its emphases on women ' s rights , education , land_reform , food security and health services have led to some of the highest standards_of_living in the Third_World -- and halved the birthrate in two generations . The status of women is a critical component . &quot; Measures such_as later age of marriage , education , occupations and the ability to exercise legal , political and economic rights are a powerful stimulus to use family_planning , &quot; Wadia said . &quot; This has been amply demonstrated in Kerala , Sri Lanka , throughout East Asia in Thailand and Indonesia , where women who have higher_status and some education and access to suitable health services also choose to have smaller families , &quot; she said . In Kerala , literacy is almost twice as high as in any other Indian state . The average life_expectancy is over 70 years -- 25 % higher than in the rest of India . And 80 % of couples now use family_planning -- compared with only 28 % in Uttar Pradesh . Dharavi is also making inroads . Literacy among women has increased to 76 % there , compared to the national average of 39 % . And now 63 % of the girls in the slums wait until until they are 18 or older to marry , and 76 % do not have their first child until that age . The average number of children in Bombay ' s slums has declined to 2.2 per woman , says India ' s Family_Planning Assn . &quot; Forty years ago , there was a magic-bullet approach that said dispensing family_planning services was sufficient to reduce population growth to ideal levels , &quot; Mitchell said . &quot; But now we recognize that family_planning is only one part of a bigger picture. &quot; But just how much work lies ahead is again reflected in India . Demographers now predict that even if India achieves replacement level as soon as 2015 , its growth will not level out before reaching 1.9 billion people -- about a third of the Earth ' s current numbers . Times Washington Bureau librarian Pat Welch contributed to this article . POPULATION FACTS * In Perspective &quot; We are burdensome to the world , the resources are scarcely adequate_to us , and our needs straiten us and complaints are everywhere while already nature does not sustain us. &quot; -- Tertullian , about AD 200 , a Latin ecclesiastical writer in Carthage * A Glossary Birthrate : The number of births per 1 # 000 population in a given year . Total fertility_rate : The average number of children born alive to a woman in her lifetime . Replacement-level fertility : The fertility_rate of 2.1 children per woman that will eventually result in zero growth of national , regional or world population . Population momentum : The tendency for population growth to continue beyond the time that replacement-level fertility has been achieved because of a relatively high concentration of people in the childbearing years . * Facts and figures About 93 million people , roughly the population of Mexico , are added_to the world each year . America ' s population , more_than 259 million , is the world ' s third-largest , after China and India . U.S. life_expectancy is 75.5 years , lower than in Japan , France , Canada and Australia . Its infant_mortality is about the same as Hong Kong but worse than Europe ' s average . Timothy E . Wirth , U.S. undersecretary of state for global affairs , offers brightly packaged condoms to office visitors . &quot; They go faster than a New York minute , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m constantly having to replace them. &quot; Since 1950 , the world has consumed as_many goods and services as all previous generations combined . The industrialized world accounts_for only 22 % of Earth ' s inhabitants but accounts_for two-thirds of consumption . The urban population of the developing world is expected to nearly triple by 2025 . Developing countries must create 30 million new jobs each year just to maintain current employment levels . About one in four births in the developing world outside China is unwanted . * The conference The U.N. Conference on Population and Development , meeting Sept . 5-13 in Cairo , will consider a draft plan for improvements in these areas : Family-planning services and reproductive care . Children ' s health_care . Access to education , particularly for girls . The status of females . Economic and social development for the poor , the disadvantaged and the elderly . Male participation and responsibility in family and community life . Reducing consumption of goods and services .

Numbering the Nations Over the next 35 years , the six fastest growing areas in the world are expected to be : OMAN : + 209 % GAZA STRIP NIGER YEMEN ETHIOPIA ANGOLA : 175 % Between 1995 and 2030 , the world ' s six major regions will have widely diverse population growth patterns. * AFRICA : + 116 % ASIA CENTRAL AND SOUTH_AMERICA OCEANIA NORTH_AMERICA EUROPE : + 1 % * These figures are based on fertility patterns and do not factor_in immigration . In the same period , several countries are expected to witness a decline in their numbers because births per family are lower than replacement levels .

But Central and South_America are growing twice as fast as North_America * Africa ' s population is expected to grow 3 % per year through 2000 . By contrast , many European_nations say their birth_rate is too low . In Asia , India is expected to surpass China ' s population by 2035 .</TEXT>
