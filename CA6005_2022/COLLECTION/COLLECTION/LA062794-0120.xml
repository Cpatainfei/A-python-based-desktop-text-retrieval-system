   <HEADLINE> SUBDUCTION ZONES SHIFT TO FOREFRONT IN EARTH STUDIES ; SCIENCE : RESEARCHERS SAY THE AREAS WHERE ' SLABS ' OF ONE TECTONIC PLATE DIVE UNDER ANOTHER HAVE CAUSED MAJOR QUAKES AND PLAYED A ROLE IN VOLCANOES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When a magnitude 9.5 earthquake struck_off the Chilean coast in 1960 , and a magnitude 9.2 occurred off Alaska in 1964 , scientists were at first not even aware that subduction zones were involved . By the time three quakes reaching a top magnitude of 7.1 took_place off the Humboldt County coast in 1992 , it had been established that the nearby Cascadia subduction zone , stretching in the ocean from Vancouver Island south to Cape Mendocino , threatened a great damaging quake in the U.S. Northwest . Further , it was known that the zone was linked to the explosive volcanoes of the Cascade_Range . In the last two years , subduction zones -- where 50-mile thick &quot; slabs &quot; of one great tectonic plate dive under another -- have assumed an importance in earth_sciences far beyond what researchers thought before . At a recent conference on Santa Catalina Island that for the first time brought_together scientists from various disciplines who have been studying the subduction process , the key speaker , Seiya Uyeda of Japan , portrayed subduction zones as the star player of world geology . &quot; It is now possible to say that subduction . . . plays a more fundamental role than sea-floor spreading in shaping the Earth ' s surface features , running the plate tectonic machinery and even in controlling the evolutionary process of the entire Earth , &quot; Uyeda said . Beyond causing some of the greatest earthquakes known , and playing a role in some of the most devastating volcanic_eruptions , subduction is responsible_for a massive recycling of water , chemicals and gases from the crust down into the mantle and then back_up again , scientists now believe . Environmentally sensitive gases such_as carbon_dioxide and methane , for instance , are believed to be carried downward by the cooler , more dense subducting slabs into the mantle , only to re-emerge much later -- the process happens over a period of tens of millions of years -- from volcanoes or by expulsion in frozen form into the deepest ocean trenches . &quot; The basic question here is how to explain these phenomena , &quot; Uyeda said . Explanations are proceeding , but also at a slow pace . In a break from conventional theory , Seth Stein of Northwestern University asserted that it is the sliding of the Pacific plate under the tectonic plates in Alaska and the North Pacific that &quot; is pulling parts of California north &quot; through the medium of great quakes along the San Andreas Fault . That means that it is not so_much forces within California that generate the seismic activity in the state , he suggested , as it is the subduction processes occurring 1 # 500 and more miles away . Robert I . Tilling of the U.S. Geological Survey said that more_than 260 # 000 people have died since the year 1600 as a result of volcanic_eruptions , most of which were the product of subduction . With subduction as the keystone , scientists drew an emerging scenario of earthquakes and volcanoes : * The diving slabs are considerably colder , on the order of hundreds of degrees , than the surrounding hot subterranean rocks through which they are descending . The slow sinking process is believed to be generated by the higher density of the colder slabs . * The top surface of the slabs carries water both in sediments and in the rock below . Over millions of years , as the slab descends into the Earth ' s mantle , these waters are released and percolate upward , causing melting of hot rocks in what is known as the &quot; mantle wedge &quot; between the two interacting tectonic plates . * These melted rocks eventually rise to the surface as magma , or lava , that is erupted by volcanoes . * Deep earthquakes , such_as the magnitude 8.2 temblor that struck 400 miles underneath Bolivia on June 8 , are the product of the squeezing of slabs that have descended very deep into the mantle . The details of processes in which minerals and gases are recycled , often emerging in sea_bottoms , is less well-known , but the general concept is valid , said David W . Scholl of the Geological Survey . &quot; These elements are brought_down into the Earth , heated_up and squished back_out into the atmosphere , &quot; Scholl said . &quot; Hydrocarbons are heated_up and squished back_out . Frozen methane is expelled right into the sea bottoms. &quot; This is a picture of a dynamic Earth , driven by the silent , somber forces of subduction . Subduction , said geologist William M . White of Cornell University , is one of the key processes mixing the Earth chemically . The Hawaiian Islands , which lie over &quot; hot spots &quot; in the mantle , are one area where material carried downward by the slabs is re-emerging , he said . Steve Kirby , another Geological Survey scientist , noted that in the world ' s many subduction zones , there is &quot; a close relationship between where earthquakes are , where volcanoes are and the location of anomalies of the Earth ' s crust. &quot; The relationship is evident in the Cascadia subduction zone , a boundary where three tectonic plates -- the Pacific , the Gorda and the North_American -- come_together . Very large earthquakes apparently occur every few hundred years 50 to 100 miles off the coast , generating dangerous tsunamis . One hundred miles inland , where the slab has burrowed deeper under the surface , are the Cascade volcanoes . Vessels of the National Oceanic and Atmospherics Administration have also been exploring undersea volcanic_eruptions several hundred miles off the Oregon coast in a possible area of other subducting slabs . Scientists at the meeting concluded that while they have a handle on the broad picture of subduction , many details -- such_as the gradual heating of the slabs , or the existence of double seismic zones on each side of some slabs -- remain a mystery . Underground Movement Scientists believe that subduction zones , where 50-mile-thick slabs of one tectonic plate drive under another , are responsible_for a variety of earthquakes , volcanic_eruptions and a massive recycling of water , chemicals and gases . Here is a look_at how the zones work , as seen off the northwest U.S. coast . 1 ) Over tens of millions of years , a leading slab of one tectonic plate dives under another , carrying with it sediments filled with water and minerals . 2 ) Cool subductive slab is gradually squeezed and heated , resulting in earthquakes . 3 ) When the slab dehydrates , water is released into hot rocks in the mantle , melting them . 4 ) Magma is sent upward to be erupted by volcanoes .</TEXT>
