   <HEADLINE> COLLISION COURSE ; CONFRONTATION LOOMS AS JAPAN PERSISTS WITH TRADE_BARRIERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A few years ago , the Japanese head of a high-tech company in Japan went shopping for a state-of-the-art mainframe_computer . After weighing many options , he bought a U.S. model . Not long after , he was astounded to find himself summoned to the prime_minister ' s office to justify his purchase . &quot; In Japanese society , this is the most intense kind of pressure , short of being asked to cancel an order , &quot; said Pat Loui , a Honolulu marketing consultant who is a friend of the executive . Though it insists it is committed to free_trade , Japan continues to erect barriers -- some subtle , some as blatant as an invitation to the prime_minister ' s woodshed -- to U.S. companies seeking to prosper in the world ' s second-largest economy . By so doing , U.S. executives and diplomats say , Japan flouts the spirit of a number of recent and longstanding trade agreements reached by its own negotiators with the United States . America ' s frustration peaked this month , as the latest round of trade talks collapsed after eight months . President Clinton put U.S. prestige on the line , raising the spectre of a trade war with tough talk_about sanctions and quotas . A new government report underscored the stakes : America ' s merchandise trade_deficit with Japan grew in 1993 to nearly $ 60 billion , a record . Inarguably , headway is being made . Many American companies have painstakingly pried open the Japanese market , proving it can be done . And some U.S. executives acknowledge that their go-get- ' em bluster and lack of understanding of Japanese ways may contribute to their problems . But confrontation is looming . Washington has taken the first_step toward retaliation in a high-profile dispute over Motorola Inc. ' s access to Japan ' s cellular_phone market . Japanese leaders have sounded conciliatory , promising a package of market-opening actions within a month . But many skeptical U.S. business people say they ' ve heard that pledge before . What ' s really going_on in the key markets ? Here is an assessment of trade conditions in industries -- telecommunications , insurance , autos and medical technology -- that U.S. trade negotiators say have been notably stymied by Japanese barriers . Telecommunications With all_the talk_of a coming information superhighway , splice closures and telephone terminals have taken_on a glamorous aura . And U.S. companies such_as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co . and Motorola have captured an impressive share of the huge global market for innovative telecommunications gear . Yet despite decades of costly marketing efforts , they have made little headway with Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp . -- the victims of Japan ' s adherence to procurement methods that exclude outsiders , according to Debra Waggoner , a spokeswoman on international trade for the American Electronics Assn . Even so , the tech firms keep bashing away . &quot; It ' s the largest phone_company in the world , so how can you not try to sell to NTT ? &quot; asked Harry O . Postlewait , an executive_vice_president at Raychem Corp. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , maker of equipment for telephone and consumer electronics_companies , utilities and auto_makers . Before buying equipment , NTT -- 65 % -owned by the Japanese government -- meets with favored suppliers to discuss specifications . It then writes proposals to suit those companies ' products , in_effect shutting_out U.S. and other foreign companies from the bidding , Waggoner said . Often , NTT invites just one company to bid on a project . When foreign companies are allowed_in , they often are limited to making proposals for equipment that represents a narrow portion of the work . Many U.S. companies don ' t bother . Another problem : In their 50s , many NTT executives leave to run small companies that make telecommunications_equipment -- and count_on their old ties to win business . &quot; The problem is that you have remnants of a pure monopoly system , &quot; said Thomas Zengage , a telecommunications consultant in Tokyo . &quot; It ' s a constant battle to make the market truly open. &quot; Postlewait said Raychem has sensed &quot; a turn for the better &quot; in its dealings with Japan in the last 18 months . But the company expects to do just $ 500 # 000 in business with NTT this year , out of its overall telecommunications sales of $ 450 million . Still , Raychem has adopted a Japanese-style strategy in its tiny Tokyo office -- a strategy of building trust over the long term . &quot; We ' re trying very hard to be their friends and to work together , &quot; Postlewait said . &quot; we ' ll play by their rules. &quot; Insurance Although American insurance_companies face no explicit barriers in Japan , few U.S. carriers have entered the market . The reason , experts contend , is that American corporate impatience tends to collide_with Japan ' s bureaucracy and culture . The situation is similar in banking , where the same rules ostensibly govern all financial_institutions , yet American banks have been unable to grasp even a 1 % share of the market . &quot; Insurance_companies have gone there and tried to get_in , but they find it ' s a long process and not everything is written_down , &quot; said Mark Weston , director of international insurance for accountants Ernst &amp; Young . But it is a market worth fighting for . The Japanese are the world ' s most fervent believers in insurance . With a population half that of the United States , Japan leads the world in the amount of life_insurance in_force ; Japanese trail only Americans in purchases of other kinds of insurance . In Japan , domestic insurers set_up sales operations within major corporations , selling directly to their work_forces . These agencies typically are staffed by company retirees who are_well trusted by their former co-workers . Most American insurers , however , have failed to gain access to these networks , putting them at a powerful disadvantage . Another problem , from the U.S. perspective , is that most Japanese insurance prices are set by the government . Premiums can run twice as high in Japan as in the United States for similar coverage . Still , there is one conspicuous American success story . Aflac Inc. , a relatively obscure company based in Columbus , Ga. , broke_into the Japanese market in the mid-1970s with a unique product : cancer insurance . Today , Aflac reaps four-fifths of its $ 5 billion in annual revenue from Japan . A key difference between insurance and banking in Japan is that one major , explicit obstacle exists for foreign banks : They are not allowed to buy Japanese banks . Yet acquisition is the fastest and surest way for a bank to establish itself in a new territory , noted Fred Furlong , an economist with the Federal_Reserve_Bank of San Francisco . Without that option , &quot; it ' s much harder to establish a beachhead and fight your way in , &quot; he said . Such U.S. banking giants as Citicorp , Bank of America , Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan all have prominent Japanese offices , but their operations tend mainly to support American companies doing business in Japan . American banks ' market share is &quot; well under 1 % , &quot; Furlong said . By contrast , he said , Japanese banks held 9.8 % of all U.S. banking assets as of mid-1993 . Autos and Auto Parts For many Americans , it has been hard to sympathize_with Detroit ' s complaint that it can ' t sell cars in Japan . The Big Three ' s credibility long was undercut by the dubious engineering , design , quality and marketing of U.S. cars . But the last two years have altered the auto world ' s landscape . Many of Detroit ' s new cars and trucks are hot , while Tokyo ' s suddenly seem dowdy . Japan -- its car_makers in painful retrenchment -- actually lost ground in the U.S. auto market last year , while Detroit added_to its meager share_in Japan . U.S.-based makers of auto components predict they will sell a record $ 19 billion worth to Japanese auto_makers this year . So why did the trade imbalance in autos and auto parts -- source of more_than half the U.S. deficit in trade with Japan -- grow an additional 4 % last year to a projected $ 34.5 billion ? Some answers were suggested this month with the publication of a joint U.S.-Japanese study that details a wide variety of entrenched business practices and interlocking interests that serve as unofficial barriers to imported autos in Japan . The study , funded and endorsed by the U.S. and Japanese governments , finds_fault on both sides . It notes that some tax and other government obstacles have been eased or eliminated and criticizes Detroit for not making a serious effort , until lately , to crack the Japanese market . &quot; Which is another way of saying lack of market share is the result of choices made , not government interference , &quot; said William C . Duncan , the top Washington lobbyist for Japan ' s auto_makers . Yet the study also suggests that Detroit ' s past resistance to investing heavily in Japan had some business logic , given other overseas priorities , its financial woes in the 1980s and the limited prospects for success . The findings focused_on the financial ties between Japan ' s auto_manufacturers and dealers , obstacles to researching the auto market there , exorbitant land prices that discourage new dealerships and a distribution system that makes imports 20 % more expensive than domestically produced cars . Only the Japanese government can force change in such deeply embedded conditions , said Andrew Card , the former U.S. transportation_secretary who now is the Big Three ' s top lobbyist . But in some ways , the situation portrayed by researchers is being overtaken by events . Analysts say economic turmoil -- notably Japan ' s recession and the dramatic rise in the yen against the dollar -- is driving fundamental change that will ease the auto trade_deficit . The stronger yen gives U.S. autos and parts a big price advantage over those from Japan . That and improving U.S. quality are causing Japanese auto firms to break_out of their keiretsu , or &quot; families &quot; of suppliers , and buy more U.S. components . Similarly , better cars and prices and Detroit ' s newfound commitment -- U.S. car_makers are acquiring dealerships and building cars with right-hand drive -- are making_it more attractive for Japanese business people to align themselves with General Motors , Ford and Chrysler . &quot; Economics have broken_down a lot of the barriers , &quot; said Marc Santucci , president of ELM International , a Lansing , Mich. , research firm . &quot; If the dollar-yen relationship stays in this range , you ' ll see fairly dramatic moves &quot; in the auto trade_deficit . Medical Technology Much has been made of Japanese prowess in consumer electronics and other high-technology fields . Yet U.S. companies can claim undisputed leadership in selling medical technology to the rest of the world . Except Japan , that is . While American manufacturers of medical devices and supplies capture about 50 % of worldwide sales , in Japan their market share is a relatively puny 21 % . By comparison , Japanese medical companies have a paltry 7 % of global sales but a whopping 70 % of their domestic market . Representatives of the U.S. medical technology industry say those figures demonstrate that Japan doesn ' t play fair with offshore competitors . They complain that Japan ' s Ministry of Health and Welfare has established a confusing array of regulations that make_it difficult for U.S. firms with new medical technology to get their products into the hands of Japanese doctors and hospitals . &quot; The Japanese government is very creative in thinking_of new regulatory impediments , &quot; said Terri Ethridge , director of global strategy and analysis for the Health Industry Manufacturers Assn. , a Washington trade group . After a new medical technology has been deemed safe by Japan ' s version of the Food and Drug Administration , the Japanese ministry often requires a second round of clinical trials . The maker of a new medical testing device could be required to provide its products free to a hospital during this process , which can take two or more years . &quot; For lots of medical technology , the life_cycle is only three years , &quot; Ethridge said . &quot; By the time you can sell it ( in Japan ) , it is obsolete. &quot; The regulatory process also buys_time for Japanese competitors to develop similar products , she noted . Bob Croce , group chairman of a Johnson &amp; Johnson unit that markets endoscopic surgical equipment , has been frustrated by Japan ' s regulatory procedures . Although endoscopic devices are commonly used for a variety of surgical_procedures in the United States and Europe , the Japanese ministry considers the devices experimental . Except for gall bladder surgery , Japan refuses to reimburse doctors and hospitals for their use . Japan &quot; has a regulatory system in place that is not in tune with the dynamic growth of this industry , &quot; Croce said . The industry is also irked by new Japanese price_controls on heart_valves , pacemakers , catheters , respiratory equipment and artificial limbs . U.S. and foreign firms are by far the leading producers of such products , which account_for about $ 1 billion in annual sales in Japan , according to the manufacturers group . &quot; We support measures to contain health_care costs , but we believe the burden should be spread &quot; so it doesn ' t discriminate against foreign suppliers , said Ed Rozynski , a group vice_president . Some U.S. companies say they don ' t find Japan ' s policies discriminatory . McGaw Inc. , an Irvine supplier of intravenous products , sells more_than $ 50 million of products annually through its Japanese distributors . Larry Watts , a company spokesman , described the Japanese regulatory process as &quot; fair but demanding. &quot; Hideki Tarumi , a health and welfare official at the Japanese Embassy in Washington , said price_controls are not as onerous as the U.S. industry suggests . And the Japanese regulatory process , he added , is &quot; almost the same as the FDA. &quot; Rather , some U.S. firms don ' t do_well in Japan because they lack understanding of foreign markets , added David Anast , publisher of the Biomedical Market Newsletter in Costa Mesa . &quot; A lot of people seem to mistakenly have the idea that you set_up shop , and if you don ' t immediately have sales , then it ' s the fault of that country ' s government , &quot; Anast said . &quot; But our problems are not always someone else ' s fault. &quot; This story was reported and written by Times staff writers Martha Groves in San Francisco , Thomas S . Mulligan and David Olmos in Los Angeles and Donald Woutat in Sacramento . Trade Among Giants Behind the $ 59.3-billion imbalance in U.S.-Japan trade lurk complex flows of goods across the Pacific . The bulk of Japan ' s sales to America are cars and high-technology manufactured products . America sells a substantial amount of aircraft and computers to Japan , but much of America ' s exports consist_of unprocessed commodities such_as food and wood . Chart shows the 15 highest-volume trade flows between the two countries in 1992 . Arrows point in the direction of trade flow . 15 LEADING ITEMS TRADED BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE U.S. IN 1992 ( in billions ) * : Exports from the United States to Japan . * * : Exports from Japan to the United States . * * Cars &amp; other motor_vehicles ( $ 20.11 in Japanese exports ) : U.S. car_makers complain that government and business practices lock foreign car_makers out of the Japanese market , where imports make_up only 3 % of sales . American firms have little to lose under U.S. proposals to hike tariffs on Japanese minivans and sport utility vehicles . * * Computers ( $ 8.59 in Japanese exports ) : While claiming a substantial share of the Japanese private sector , U.S. computer firms say sales to government_agencies still fall_short_of international targets . Any sanctions against Japanese exports could backfire on U.S. firms that depend_on Japanese electronic components . * * Motor_vehicle parts &amp; accessories ( $ 5.45 in Japanese exports ) : U.S. auto part makers have been boosting sales to Japanese car_makers as they produce more vehicles in the United States . Japanese buyers might reduce their U.S. purchases should tension and trade_barriers increase . * * Integrated circuits ( $ 5.01 in Japanese exports ) : The current U.S. share of the Japanese computer chip market , about 18 % , has fallen below levels agreed to by both countries . But few expecting the market to turn_into a trade war battleground , because companies on both nations depend_on each other ' s specialized exports . * * Telecommunications_equipment ( $ 5.00 in Japanese exports ) : Complicated and obscure Japanese government buying policies appear to favor domestic manufacturers . But the success of some U.S.-made products such_as fiber-optic cables could be jeopardized as tensions rise . * Aircraft &amp; associated equipment ; spacecraft &amp; parts ( $ 3.81 in U.S. exports ) : Japan is the single largest export market for U.S. manufacturers , which have established close ties to Japanese suppliers . Even short-term animosity could prompt the Japanese to begin shifting orders for new equipment and parts to European and other foreign competitors . * * Parts for computers ( $ 3.76 in Japanese exports ) : Although Japanese exports are twice American levels , the Japanese market is still a lucrative one for U.S. firms . Dependence on each other ' s products might limit what the United States and Japan can do without harming their respective interests . * * Sound recorders , tv recorders , recording media ( $ 2.94 in Japanese exports ) : The United States has virtually ceded the manufacture of products such_as videocassette_recorders to the Japanese . Higher U.S. tariffs might hurt Japanese firms but would also raise the ire of U.S. consumers , who would have few alternatives . * * Internal combustion piston engines &amp; parts ( $ 2.94 in Japanese exports ) : Most exports from Japan are destined for Japanese-owned automobile plants in the United States . American manufacturers have pushed hard for a bigger share of that &quot; transplant &quot; market and would welcome any boost from Washington . * * Electrical machinery &amp; apparatus ( $ 2.46 in Japanese exports ) : Japan dominates trade_in this sector , which includes everything from home_appliances to industrial tools . Even many home_appliances sold under a U.S. brand name are manufactured by Japanese firms . Again , U.S. consumers would feel the fallout of a trade war . * * Baby_carriages , toys , games &amp; sporting goods ( $ 2.16 in Japanese exports ) : U.S. firms have made some inroads into the Japanese market ; the growth of U.S. retailers , such_as Toys R Us , bodes well for American firms . Many of the Japanese imports represent computer_games . Could Washington deny American youngsters their Nintendo and Sega fixes ? * Computers ( $ 2.05 in U.S. exports ) : Japan is the world ' s second-largest market for computers after the United States . Both U.S. and Japanese firms are vulnerable to sanctions and higher tariffs on finished computers and components . * * Printed circuits ( $ 1.68 in Japanese exports ) : The trade_in computer_circuit boards is dominated by the Japanese . But few expect U.S. sanctions in this sector , as_many American-made computer chips are included on Japanese-produced circuit_boards . * * Office machines ( $ 1.65 in Japanese exports ) : Japanese firms dominate U.S. sales of low-end photocopiers and are major producers of other types of equipment , such_as electric_typewriters . This could be a tempting target for U.S. sanctions as a way to deny Japanese companies greater market share . * Parts for computers ( $ 1.57 in U.S. exports ) : U.S. firms have found a large market in Japan for computer disk_drives , memory storage units and other computer and office machine parts . Japan could easily retaliate against U.S. sanctions and hurt American firms , so Washington will probably leave Japanese exports alone . A Swelling Deficit After decreasing in the late 1980 ' s , America ' s merchandise trade_deficit with Japan-the amount by which U.S. exports of goods to Japan fall_short_of Japanese exports of products to the United States-has grown dramatically in the last two years .
