   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : WINNING MAKES SOCCER A BIT EASIER TO SWALLOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One month to go before the World Cup takes_to slumming on U.S. soil and the home team is building_up one righteous head of steam . Armenia was defeated Sunday at Cal State Fullerton , 1-0 . Estonia fell the week before , 4-0 . We have been kicking some serious former Soviet_Socialist_Republic butt , just wiping the soccer field with these tiny recently independent states . Latvia , Lithuania , Azerbaijan -- keep_on lining them up . Team USA isn ' t afraid of anyone it can ' t locate on a map . As for Colombia and Romania , well , the young Americans are trying to convince themselves that time is_on their side . A lot can happen in a month , right ? Our top players return from Europe in a week or two , Coach Bora Milutinovic can fiddle_with the mix_in a couple final warm-ups against Greece and Mexico and , with any amount of luck , we make our stand before the world against Switzerland -- June 18 at the Silverdome -- without inflaming any panic in Detroit . &quot; I ' d like to get_it going right now , &quot; U.S. defender Alexi Lalas said . &quot; Realistically , we could still use the next month to fine-tune things , but I ' m optimistic . Come June 18 , I ' m totally confident we ' ll be ready , individually and collectively , to have a successful World Cup. &quot; A successful World Cup -- talk_about your relative terms . In Germany and Brazil , a successful World Cup is defined as flying home with the lumpy gold trophy in the overhead bin . The American slang is completely different . After sitting_out the World Cup for 40 years and being slapped around in 1990 , a great run_for the United States in 1994 would be playing well enough in its first three matches to earn a fourth . &quot; The second round , yeah , &quot; Lalas said , trying to imagine the day . &quot; that ' s our initial goal . We can no longer be happy just to be there . We have to do something once we ' re there. &quot; Especially now that the World Cup is our stage , for the first time ever -- and who knows about the last ? &quot; It would n ' t hurt , man , &quot; Lalas said . The World Cup didn ' t come_to the States without a fight . At first , the purists were so peeved , they had to remove their monocles to wipe the fog from them . The United States was a baseball-loving , hot dog-inhaling , soccer-illiterate land of heathens -- totally unworthy_of hosting such a sacred event . Americans have no appreciation , no respect for the game . I mean , just look_at the way they play it . Team USA hadn ' t done much recently to shatter the stereotype , either . Before Sunday ' s victory over Armenia , the United States ' international record in 1994 was a pitiful 3-4-7 . Included were losses to non-Cup participants Iceland ( 2-1 ) and Chile ( 2-0 ) , lethargic ties with Denmark , Bolivia and Moldova and a 3-1 defeat in the Joe Robbie Cup to a Swedish national team playing without most of its World Cup starters . The victories came against Norway , Moldova and Estonia -- a veritable American League West of international soccer . &quot; We went_through a month-long period dealing with cuts and outside problems and it really affected our play , &quot; midfielder Claudio Reyna said . Outside problems ? &quot; We weren ' t playing well and the excuses were flying , &quot; Reyna said . &quot; When you ' re losing , all you hear is the criticism . ' They ' re not fit. ' ' They ' re not ready. ' ' The wrong guys are_on the field. ' &quot; I think we ' re out of that rut now . We have two wins in a row , even if they are against lesser teams . We just have to get a winning attitude and take that into our ( final tuneups ) against Greece , Saudi_Arabia and Mexico . Those will be three great preparations for us. &quot; When you ' re a U.S. national soccer team member , you take your silver_linings wherever you can find them . Sunday , for instance , Lalas saw one in the stands . Titan Stadium was packed -- official attendance was listed at 9 # 753 -- which was a sizable improvement over the 2 # 158 scattered souls who witnessed last week ' s rout of Estonia , which apparently doesn ' t travel well . &quot; Hell , yeah , &quot; Lalas said . &quot; It ' s so_much better to play in front of a big crowd . Even if a lot of the fans here were for Armenia. &quot; And in three weeks , Team USA will play Mexico at the Rose Bowl , and a crowd of 60 # 000 is expected , and most of them will be cheering the team in green , red and white . &quot; It ' s a reality for U.S. soccer players , &quot; Lalas said with a shrug . &quot; A lot of our games are played_at home , yet in front of hostile , anti-U.S. crowds . We ' re used to it. &quot; Lalas chalks it up as part of &quot; all_the crap you have to go_through as an American soccer player . All that stuff -- battling other sports for attention , trying to find ( a club ) team that will have you , trying to play a game the rest of the world has an undying passion for , yet in your country , you have to toil in anonymity. &quot; What will it take_to change that ? &quot; Money , maybe , &quot; Lalas suggested . &quot; I don ' t know . People are either going_to dig it , or they ' re not . This country is very ripe for it to happen , but not everybody is gonna love it . We ' re not asking everybody to love it . &quot; For those who do , they have a great summer ahead of them . For those who don ' t , at least they ' ll have a chance to see and maybe gain a respect for the best level of play in the world. &quot; And a U.S. victory / minor miracle or two ? It would n ' t hurt , man . * U.S. TEAM WINS Frank Klopas scores his fourth goal in five games as the U.S. national soccer team defeats Armenia , 1-0 . C11</TEXT>
