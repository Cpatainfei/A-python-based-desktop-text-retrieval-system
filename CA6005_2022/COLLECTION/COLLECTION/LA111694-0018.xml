   <HEADLINE> AUDIT OF BREAST_CANCER STUDY CONFIRMS LUMPECTOMY ' S VALUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An exhaustive audit of a fraud-tainted cancer study has confirmed the original results : Breast_cancer is as effectively treated with a breast-saving procedure as with surgery in which the whole breast is removed . A report released Tuesday by a team of experts at the National Cancer Institute concluded that removing the tumor and then treating with radiation is just as likely to result in long-term survival as is mastectomy -- removal of the entire breast . The breast-saving procedure , called lumpectomy , has been in_use for some time , but its validity was thrown into question earlier this year when NCI officials announced that a major study that supported lumpectomy was based , in part , on fraud . Officials learned that a researcher at St . Luc ' s Hospital in Montreal had falsified data for some of the patients that he had enrolled in the study . The study , called the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Cancer Project , had been key research in establishing the value of lumpectomy . NCI removed the St . Luc ' s data from the study last spring and did a cursory recomputation that found the fraud did not affect the conclusion about lumpectomy . The agency also undertook a detailed audit in which researchers re-examined hospital data for 1 # 554 patients in the studies and were able to find the original charts to verify data for 1 # 390 of the enrollees . &quot; We audited 86 % of all_of the data in the original study and found that the conclusion was not changed , &quot; said Dr. Jeffrey S . Abrams of the NCI therapy evaluation program . Though some of the 484 institutions in the original study were left_out of the audit , Abrams said , the experts got enough data to construct a statistically powerful verification of the original findings . The audit found that breast_cancer patients who chose lumpectomy and radiation had a 10-year survival rate of 71 % , versus a survival rate of 66 % for those who chose mastectomy . Abrams said the results , from a statistical viewpoint , show no significant difference between the two therapies . The reports were delivered at a meeting of cancer clinicians organized by the NCI .</TEXT>
