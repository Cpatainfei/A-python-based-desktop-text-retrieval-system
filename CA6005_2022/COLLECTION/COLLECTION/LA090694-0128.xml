   <HEADLINE> RWANDA ' S NEW LEADERS ASSERT ' SAFE ZONE ' HOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Though another panicky flight of Rwandans may be the outcome , Rwanda ' s government began a three-stage operation Monday to quickly assert its authority in the U.N.-policed &quot; safe zone , &quot; where fears of its wrath and rule triggered an exodus last month . Three military liaison officers from the Rwandan Patriotic Front left for the country ' s southwest to take_up permanent posts with battalions from Ethiopia , Ghana and French-speaking African_countries already stationed in the region , said Canadian Maj . Jean-Guy Plante , spokesman for the U.N. Assistance Mission to Rwanda . Several members of the Rwandan Cabinet will tour the area under U.N. guard within the next few days , and mayors and other local officials , accompanied by a platoon of armed soldiers from the RPF , will follow . &quot; This should ( happen ) quickly , within the next 10 days , &quot; Plante estimated . If that timetable is adhered to , it will mark the consolidation of the Rwandan government ' s authority over the entire violence-racked country for the first time since it came_to power in July . The &quot; safe zone &quot; was created by the_French in late June as a stream of more_than 2 million refugees , some guilty of having massacred huge numbers of their countrymen , fled toward the border with Zaire , stampeded by fears over what the impending change in government might bring . Victors in a short , sharp civil_war , the RPF ousted a regime led by hard-line members of the Hutu majority , who , in April , masterminded a nationwide blood bath of political opponents , lawyers , journalists and other professionals and members of the Tutsi minority . The latest estimate from U.N. officials organizing emergency relief to Rwanda is that 1 million people may have been slaughtered . But this Central African_country is so disorganized , people ' s whereabouts so uncertain and old population estimates so incomplete that such a figure can only be regarded_as a rough , disputable guess . The French firmly kept RPF troops out of the southwest but pulled_out of the &quot; safe zone &quot; Aug . 21 , handing control over to troops under the flag of the United Nations . Rwanda ' s new leaders asserted that they had the right to send their own soldiers in , saying it was important for their credibility ; they later relented . Until Monday , their only permanent presence in the region was a handful of customs and immigration officials sent to staff border posts on the Zaire-Rwanda frontier . That will change this week , Plante said . &quot; We will see an increase of government activity in that zone , &quot; he told a news briefing . &quot; That is , more and more government_ministers will be visiting the main cities. &quot; When the_French handed control over to 2 # 000 U.N. troops and left , aid workers had feared another surge of refugees to Zaire like the wave that carried hundreds of thousands of miserable , sick and dying people to camps at Goma and other cities . That did not happen on the scale feared , although tens of thousands of people surged across bridges spanning the Rusizi River . According to latest estimates , 500 # 000 Rwandans who fled their homes elsewhere in the country are still in the southwest , along with 1.2 million local residents . The phasing-in of the new government ' s authority while U.N. soldiers are still on the ground seems designed to reassure Hutus that if they did not become killers , they have nothing to fear . But Plante ' s remarks made_it clear that Canadian Maj . Gen . Guy Tousignant , the U.N. commander in Rwanda , is bracing for a potentially hostile reception or attacks on the RPF officials . &quot; There ' s quite an implication for us ( the U.N. force ) , in terms of security , &quot; Plante said . &quot; One step at a time , we ' ll visit one town , and see the reaction. &quot; Tousignant toured the southwest by helicopter Saturday . Asked whether that meant the U.N. commander had concerns about what the extension of the RPF ' s authority might provoke , Plante said , &quot; He doesn ' t drive_around the countryside just to look_at the birds. &quot; U.N. sources also said Monday that customs officials stationed by the RPF on the Zaire frontier had recently become the target of threats ; it was not immediately clear who was behind them . As Plante reported the departure of the Rwandan military_officers for the former &quot; safe zone , &quot; Tousignant summoned his battalion commanders for a meeting in the capital , Kigali , and was supposed to talk with Defense Minister Paul Kagame , the Tutsi who led the RPF to victory in the civil_war . Refugees who fled into the &quot; safe zone &quot; are predominantly poor Hutu farmers but include thugs who took_part in the killings . Stoking their wariness about the new Rwandan government ' s intentions are rumors spread by officials of the old government , now across the border in Zaire , that the RPF ' s Tutsi-controlled army is bent_on vengeance . An estimated 28 # 000 members of the defeated Rwandan government ' s army were driven into Zaire along with the huge refugee population . Aid workers have reported that the soldiers are regrouping in the refugee camps . But U.N. officials have announced that some have gone_over to the RPF . Plante said Monday that about 40 of the 210 members of the old gendarmerie , or police , in the southwest had pledged their loyalty to the RPF as it prepared to send_in its officials . They and other policemen voluntarily surrendered more_than 170 weapons , he reported . Last week , Shahryar Khan , the United Nations ' special envoy to Rwanda , said 400 soldiers who had fought for the defeated government had joined up with RPF forces . Civilian officials from the old regime also were pledging loyalty to the new leaders , he said . &quot; Large_numbers of civil_servants , magistrates and teachers have sent_in their particulars and have been asked to continue working , &quot; Khan said .</TEXT>
