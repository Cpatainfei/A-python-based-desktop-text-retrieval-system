   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; KABUL RESIDENTS ENDURE SIEGE BY FACTIONAL MUSLIM FIGHTERS ; THE ISSUES MEAN LITTLE TO MOST OF THEM . BUT THE SUFFERING AND TERROR ARE DAILY REALITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Another mortar round crashed among the jumbled houses of the old city , exploded with a bone-jarring crack and threw_up a cloud of dust and smoke . A stream of people hurried out of the warren of old bazaars and dashed across a bridge_over the filthy Kabul River , crouching low to avoid shrapnel and stray bullets . The bundled figures carried sacks or pushed carts of possessions they had managed to salvage . Machine-gun fire rattled from the crumbling medieval walls of the Bala Hissar fortress that sits on a ridge overlooking the shattered buildings of the old city . A fire ignited by an explosion in the morning blazed uncontrollably , spreading through shops in the bazaar area and sending a column of black smoke into the clear air beside the minaret and battered red dome of Kabul ' s main mosque . The Afghan capital is at war again . Since New Year ' s Day , fighting has raged in Kabul as the combined forces of two of Afghanistan ' s most ruthless warlords have tried to drive the current ineffective government from power . The Afghan war , fueled by Soviet , U.S. and later Arab-supplied weapons , is one bloody struggle the world would rather forget . Most people believe that it should have ended two years ago , when President Najibullah fled and his Soviet-backed government in Kabul collapsed . The fighting has not ended because of a power struggle between rival leaders of the Islamic moujahedeen , or &quot; Holy Warriors , &quot; which broke_out as they marched in to take_control of Kabul in the spring of 1992 , after a 13-year struggle against Soviet troops and their Afghan proteges . This power struggle has led to three previous bouts of severe fighting in the capital , reducing large areas to rubble . * As fighting continued in the old city and along the Kabul River , which now forms the front_line between government and rebel forces in the midst of the city , a steady flow of wounded arrived_at Jumhuriyat Hospital . This is in the center of the city , near Chicken Street , once the hangout of Western hippies and carpet dealers in the more carefree days before the war . As the crash of shells repeatedly shook the hospital and rattled the windows , a horn blared and a jeep roared into the compound . Two young boys , butcher ' s assistants from the old bazaar , were taken_out , one unconscious , the second grimacing with pain , his clothes stained with blood . A third man lay on the floor of the jeep , his face a greenish hue in death and his jaws already tied shut with a rag . The two boys were taken_in on stretchers to have their wounds patched_up , and the stretcher was wiped clean for the next patient . &quot; The past few days have been_quiet , &quot; said a French doctor of the volunteer group Medicins Sans Frontieres . &quot; Today we ' re getting_back to normal. &quot; Kabul is in its 12th week of fighting between the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and rebel forces of the former Communist militia leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum , supported by the renegade prime_minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . Hekmatyar , an outspoken critic of the United States , has always presented himself as the &quot; purest &quot; of the Islamist leaders . His alliance with Dostum , the most unrepentant of the remnants of the former Communist government , has seriously damaged his credibility , however . Dostum , a powerful militia leader from the north of Afghanistan , precipitated the collapse of the former government in 1992 , when he suddenly turned his back on President Najibullah in Kabul and joined the moujahedeen in fighting against the government . The maneuvering for military advantage , the making and breaking of alliances , matters little to the civilians , the main victims of this latest round of the Afghan power struggle . Few of them any longer support any of the five factions that control various parts of Kabul . &quot; Everyone hates these leaders , &quot; said a middle-aged Kabul man whose house was destroyed in the fighting . He now lives_in a tent in a vast camp for Kabuli refugees near the eastern city of Jalalabad . &quot; All the leaders want is one thing -- power . It has nothing to do with religion , just power. &quot; The fighting has centered_on the old city and Microrayon , a once-fashionable Soviet-style residential_area of half-finished high-rise apartment_buildings and immobile building cranes . President Rabbani ' s troops , led by the popular moujahedeen commander Ahmad Shah Massoud , control the north and center of Kabul , while Dostum ' s and Hekmatyar ' s forces occupy the Bala Hissar and the southeastern corner of the city . The south of Kabul , flattened in earlier bouts of fighting , has been largely peaceful this time . It is under the control of yet another faction , Hezbi Wahdat , a party of ethnic Hazaras , who are Shia Muslims . The majority of Afghans are Sunni Muslims . * Gul Mohammed , administrator of a hospital in the south Kabul area of Karte-Se , is not optimistic that the fighting will stop . He voices a general disenchantment with President Rabbani , who took_office in 1992 shortly after the moujahedeen takeover . &quot; He has not provided security for any part of Kabul , &quot; Gul Mohammed said . &quot; He should have started reconstruction , but he says he is too busy fighting. &quot; Life for Kabul residents was difficult enough when there was no fighting . Now , it has become unbearable . There was little electricity before , but there has been none at all since the fighting began , and many people are without heating while snow covers the mountains surrounding the city . Sufficient food and fuel have become unaffordable for many people . A curfew is enforced after 10 p.m. , but Kabul is like a city of the dead by sundown as no one dares leave home . The most frightening aspect of the fighting is its arbitrariness . Rockets and shells are fired mostly into the old city , Microrayon and the diplomatic and government district around the Presidential Palace , but they can land anywhere . On one apparently quiet morning , several passersby were wounded when a rocket fell near the Bulgarian Embassy . The same morning , a young_man stood crying on Chicken Street . &quot; He ' s just heard that his mother has been killed by a mortar in Shor Bazaar , &quot; said a friend . Shor Bazaar , near the Bala Hissar fortress , has undergone some of the heaviest shelling . During lulls in the fighting , panic-stricken men , women and children hurry from areas of fighting to relative safety elsewhere , pushing carts or carrying huge bundles of bedding and other household goods . The crack and boom of artillery is a constant background . More_than 30 # 000 people have been displaced within the city . They are sheltering with relatives or in mosques and schools in safer parts of the city . Aerial bombardment by Dostum ' s jets adds another element of arbitrary death . One young_man commented : &quot; When you see jets flying over , you watch and wonder , will this one drop a bomb and kill me ? But what can you do ? In the mountains you could always hide in a cave , but here there is nowhere to hide. &quot; Hundreds of thousands of people have fled altogether from Kabul , which was a city swollen by refugees to about 2 million people during the later stages of the anti-Soviet war . More_than 60 # 000 of these have gone_to Jalalabad , most hoping to continue to neighboring Pakistan , which harbored more_than 3 million Afghan refugees during the war . About 1.5 million refugees still remain in Pakistan , but the government of Benazir Bhutto in Islamabad has decided that it does not want another wave from its war-torn neighbor . The border crossing at the Khyber Pass has been closed , and Afghans who hoped to go there have been forced to camp on a wind-swept gravel plain outside Jalalabad . International relief agencies are doing their best to provide tents , blankets , food and water for these wretched people , but new arrivals from the fighting in Kabul have often had to sleep_in the open . Though Dostum lost ground in Kabul early in this round of fighting , the government has not managed to dislodge his forces from the city , and the battle has ground to a stalemate . Like most people here , Gul Mohammed from the Karte-Se Hospital sees the situation simply . &quot; The anti-government forces say ( President ) Rabbani should resign . He says he will not resign . So they keep_on fighting. &quot; Beyond this , little is certain . The long-suffering people of Kabul must simply grit their teeth and bear the pain .</TEXT>
