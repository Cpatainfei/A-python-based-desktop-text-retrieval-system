   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : WOODLAND HILLS ; NEW ORGANIZATION TO STUDY HYDROGEN FUEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A question for the ' 90s : what to do with all that brain power that had been previously deployed in nuclear_energy fields ? With the Cold_War over and the resulting winding-down of the nuclear arms race , 150 scientists with the Energy Technology Engineering Center , located in a canyon near Chatsworth , face unemployment.In addition , the U.S._government is looking_at a $ 500-million investment in energy research going_to waste . Seeking a solution , ETEC created the Community Reuse Organization , a nonprofit group to draw_on private and public industries for joint projects . The organization opened its doors Wednesday in Woodland Hills with a $ 260 # 000 matching grant from the federal_government . The money will be used for a project with Hydrogen Burner Technology , Inc. of Costa Mesa for a three-month study of a low-cost hydrogen fuel . &quot; Our mission is to bring public and private industry to ETEC to use the intellectual resources and lab equipment that ' s up there , &quot; said organization chairwoman Bonny Matheson . &quot; In doing so , we maintain those jobs and equipment and create more jobs and high-quality products so we can compete globally. &quot; ETEC will test the &quot; under-oxidixed burner , &quot; an inexpensive machine that creates hydrogen gas by burning natural_gas and air , according to a release . &quot; It ' s just as safe as natural_gas , &quot; said Clark Gibbs , ETEC general_manager . &quot; It ' s used in the main engines of the space shuttle. &quot; MAKI BECKER</TEXT>
