   <TEXT> Imagine two factories standing side_by_side , each dedicated to turning_out a product quite the opposite of what the other produces . Each works efficiently for a constituency that waits eagerly for what comes_off the line . The sign above one factory could read &quot; Western Myths &quot; while the sign above the other could be &quot; Western Realities. &quot; Just to confuse matters , imagine that each facility uses the same raw_material as the other . And let ' s make_it worse still . Both factories have run_out of labels , so it ' s not clear which product came from which factory . Is that the real Wild Bill Hickok ? Was there only one Custer ? One Sitting Bull ? Not long ago I attended a writers conference devoted to Western Literature and Western Writers . During a panel_discussion , one of the participants announced , &quot; There ' s no such thing as the West. &quot; His remark did not outrage or offend or bring the conference to a halt . Everyone nodded in_agreement -- certainly we know there ' s no such thing as the West , by now everyone knows that -- and then we blithely went_on trying_on different definitions of the West like so many hats . Most of them made by Stetson . Part of the problem stems from the means of definition . Some want to talk_about place , others soul . Others choose to base their definition on economics or annual rainfall or the distance between neighbors . Still others want to focus_on whether boots are fitted with riding or walking heels . Consider the word frontier , used so frequently in discussions and depictions of the West , yet the battle over its meaning has been as intense -- albeit bloodless -- as any range war . In &quot; The Frontier in American Culture , &quot; a volume intended to accompany an exhibition at Chicago ' s Newberry Library , historians Richard White and Patricia Nelson Limerick survey this struggle over the concept of frontier . White and Limerick are perhaps the most notable of recent historians who have questioned and re-examined traditional views of the American West . Both historians write such lucid prose and bring so_much intelligence , insight and careful reasoning to their work that it ' s difficult not to be persuaded by their arguments . White concentrates_on a single , strange moment in history from which sprang two contradictory definitions of frontier . In 1893 , at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago , Frederick Jackson Turner , a historian from the University of Wisconsin , advanced his thesis that the availability in America of vast areas of so-called &quot; free land &quot; was the crucial factor_in the nation ' s development . At the same time Professor Turner was delivering his lecture , Buffalo Bill Cody had his famous Wild_West Show in town depicting a much different version of the settling of the West . Where Turner wanted to emphasize farmers , oxen and plows , Buffalo Bill offered scouts , horses and bullets . ( Also at the Columbian Exposition was Rain-in-the-Face , the Lakota reputed to have killed Custer , but then for Native_Americans , any theory of frontier made no sense and was likely only to bring them more grief. ) Neither Turner nor Cody was correct , in White ' s view , but he is concerned with another issue . How could these two versions of the frontier , as different as they are , manage to grab and keep such a tight hold_on the American mind ? Because , White says , both Turner and Cody appropriated the symbols and icons of previous events and existing myths , weaving them into new narratives . Limerick finds not only the concept of frontier flawed , but the word itself debased in its ubiquity . She attempts to catalogue its appearances and finds it everywhere -- politicians sprinkle it throughout their speeches , newspapers love to use it in their headlines , and everyone with something to sell , it seems , works it into an advertising slogan . Inevitably , a word that can mean everything means nothing . It is no wonder that many academic historians , Limerick among them , shy_away_from the &quot; f-word , &quot; and will go_to great lengths to avoid its use . It is not only its vagueness they abjure but also its ethnocentrism . Whether you follow the trail leading from Turner or Cody , it is obviously a road meant for white males . Dee Brown is not afraid to use the f-word , yet one would not want to place him in the same camp as the myth-makers . Indeed , his &quot; Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee &quot; probably did as much as any book to increase awareness of the historical mistreatment of Native_Americans . But Brown writes popular rather than academic history , and if he cannot keep the slightly awe-struck tone from his writing about the Old West it is because he believes it was &quot; simply a place of magic and wonders. &quot; His wondrous &quot; The American West &quot; is a one volume distillation of three earlier books of Western history co-written with Martin Schmitt largely to provide a narrative framework for collections of photographs . And the photographs are here as well , of Red Cloud and Sitting Bull and Geronimo and Wild Bill Hickok and George Armstrong Custer and Teddy Roosevelt , with stories to accompany them . Brown cautions against confusing true history with myth , but what are you going_to do when the life itself , even without exaggeration or adornment , seems the stuff of legend ? Certainly there must be a movie in the life of Sarah Winnemucca , the granddaughter of a Shoshone chief and wife of a U.S. Army_officer , who managed to work in the interests of both sides . Or in Arthur Balfour , who came from England , bought himself a &quot; big hat , boots , and a red bandanna , &quot; and signed_on as a Bar X cowhand and learned why the ranch was earning no profits for its British investors . Or in Prairie Rose , who , to collect a $ 50 wager , walked naked down the main_street of Ellsworth , Kansas &quot; with a six-gun in each hand to shoot out any eye that showed. &quot; Of course , no Western history that aims to be at all comprehensive can fail to record the policies and practices -- exploitative and paternalistic at best , genocidal at worst -- directed toward the Native_American population . In chapter after chapter , Brown tells stories that , no matter what the beginning , always have the same ending : Tribes driven from their lands , mighty chiefs stripped of their power , hunters and warriors reduced to living_on handouts . With astonishing swiftness , the rituals and structures of societies that had existed for centuries were altered forever . Brown documents these losses until , finally , the American West feels more like elegy than history . The sense of loss shows_up again and again in the work of contemporary Western writers . Throughout &quot; Northern Lights , &quot; an anthology edited by Deborah Clow and Donald Snow , are laments for rivers , forests , animals , families , wilderness , innocence , silence , civility . . . . When John Daniel describes a clear-cut Northwestern forest , he does_it in a way that makes_it possible to see what once was there . In a remarkably ambitious essay , Leslie Ryan connects hunting , fishing , logging , rape , the movie &quot; Silence of the Lambs &quot; and loss of trust . There is plenty of finger-pointing in these pages -- at the Forest Service , the Atomic Energy Commission , at ranchers , Easterners , whites -- yet when David Quammen points_out that certain animal species are missing from our national_parks he says it is a crime without a criminal . Crime is_on the mind of William Kittredge , and he sees its prevalence as a consequence of having lost the stories that once showed us how to live peaceably together . In &quot; Letters to an Architect , &quot; Gretel Ehrlich meditates on space , interior and exterior , and on what the effects might be as we seal ourselves off from the elements . Terry Tempest Williams , in her moving , &quot; The Clan of One-Breasted Women , &quot; writes_of how many of the women in her family have lost their very future -- or the ability to believe_in it . There is so_much fine writing in these pages that it ' s easy to conclude that the West is currently producing more writers of talent and vision than any other region . Perhaps awareness of loss provides that psychic wound that is reputed to result in creativity . Just as likely , it feeds an outrage that must have expression . What is perhaps most remarkable about these recitations of destruction and deprivation is that they are about a region so new . But then the pain of loss can be all_the more acute for what passes quickly . Or for what never was .
