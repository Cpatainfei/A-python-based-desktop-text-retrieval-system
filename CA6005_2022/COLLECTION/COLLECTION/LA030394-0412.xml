   <HEADLINE> TRADE SHOW IN VIETNAM TO BE ALL-AMERICAN AFFAIR ; COMMERCE : O.C. CONSULTANTS SEEKING POTENTIAL CLIENTS TO ATTEND EVENT LIMITED TO U.S. COMPANIES . IT BEGINS APRIL 21 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Entrepreneurs from across the United States are preparing_for the first trade show in Vietnam since the fall of Saigon in 1975 to exclusively feature U.S. businesses . About 45 companies have signed_up to exhibit their wares in Hanoi at a four-day fair that begins April 21 , said Dick Pirozzolo , a spokesman for Vietnam Investment Information &amp; Consulting in San Diego , which is organizing the trade show . Vietnam has played host to other trade fairs since the Communist government took_over , but this will be the first to feature American firms only , said Ban Doan , an aide to Vietnam ' s United Nations ambassador in New York City . &quot; This will benefit both Vietnam and America , &quot; Doan said . &quot; The two sides can exchange commerce information and talk_about working together. &quot; Major firms participating at the expo include soda bottler Pepsico Inc. of Purchase , N.Y. , and Radix Group International , a Los Angeles firm that arranges freight shipments . &quot; I ' ve been trying to get a hotel_room in Hanoi since February , &quot; said Ellen Numis , director of sales and marketing for Radix . &quot; Everything ' s booked_up because of the trade show. &quot; Orange County consultants will attend the fair , hoping to network with potential clients , though no county businesses have signed_up to exhibit their products . George Dang , an international business consultant and president of Alca International Co . in Irvine , said he will travel the 8 # 500 miles to Hanoi to meet with potential clients . &quot; Vietnam is the gold_rush right now , &quot; he said . And Wendy Kroll , president of Healthcare Professional Management Inc. in Irvine , will rendezvous at the fair with leaders of the Vietnamese Women ' s Union , which works_on women ' s issues , to discuss how to bring immunization to Vietnamese children at low costs . &quot; There are many pharmaceutical companies that want to do business with Vietnam , &quot; Kroll said . A Vietnamese singer who has been popular in Vietnam since the 1960s will travel from Westminster to Hanoi to entertain at the trade expo . Organizers declined to release his name , fearing he might be harassed by factions in the Vietnamese American community that are opposed to reconciliation with the Communist regime . The Orange County singer will be the first expatriate musician to perform in a major concert in Vietnam . &quot; We want to make_sure he gets_to the trade show safely , &quot; said Peter Tran , co-executive director for VIIC . Since President Clinton lifted the trade_embargo with Vietnam Feb . 3 , American companies can now share_in as much as $ 9 billion worth of trade and investment in that country , according to the United States-Vietnam Trade Council in Washington . Thirty U.S. firms already have representative offices there through a special license granted by the U.S. Department of Treasury , but they have not been allowed to conduct actual business . Since the late 1980s , Vietnam has bought more_than $ 4 billion in goods from Asian and European_nations , according to VIIC . Tran said he and fellow colleagues at VIIC decided to organize the expo after their first return visit to their birthplaces two years ago . &quot; We were walking_around the open markets and saw American products being sold illegally everywhere , &quot; he said . &quot; American things are so popular in Vietnam , though trade shows have only featured European and Asian products . We thought , ' Why not have an expo for American companies ? ' &quot; The expo came_together quickly with the cooperation of the two governments , which were eager to share_in the benefits a trade fair might bring . It was arranged in September , months before Clinton ' s decision to lift the trade_embargo . But VIIC officials said the U.S. Department of Treasury ' s approval of the fair signaled to them months ago that the embargo would soon end . &quot; It would n ' t make_sense for the U.S._government to allow their companies to display goods only to take those goods back to America , &quot; Tran said . &quot; Businesses want a chance to sell their products at the trade show. &quot; When Clinton announced the lifting of the commerce ban , he also said negotiators would discuss the opening of liaison offices between the two countries . On Wednesday , U.S. and Vietnamese officials announced that the two governments have agreed in principle to open offices in each other ' s capitals , a key step toward establishing diplomatic relations . The U.S. office in Vietnam ' s capital would deal with trade and human_rights issues and continue the effort to uncover information about American MIAs . VIIC officials said they hope the opening of Communist Vietnam to U.S. trade will increase the standard_of_living for the country ' s 71 million people , whose per capita income in 1992 was about $ 220 annually . More foreign presence in the Southeast Asian_country might also improve human_rights for residents there , they said . &quot; As more people find jobs , they can better feed and clothe their families , &quot; said Hung Le , co-executive director for the consulting_firm . &quot; And hopefully freedom would slowly come_in , too. &quot; With a literacy rate of 88 % , Vietnam ' s well-educated population promises not just a market for U.S. products such_as soft_drinks and electronics , but also a potentially low-cost labor_pool , VIIC executives said . Though the trade show has yet occurred , VIIC executives are so confident it will succeed that they have begun planning a second one -- this time in Ho Chi Minh City ( formerly Saigon ) in October .</TEXT>
