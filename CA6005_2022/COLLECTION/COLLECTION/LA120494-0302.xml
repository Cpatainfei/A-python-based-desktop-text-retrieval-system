   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : MID-CITY : WILSHIRE ; LAWYERS AID CHILDREN AFFECTED BY AIDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Very often , those most vulnerable to the impact of HIV and AIDS are children who have the illness or whose parents are infected . Orphaned or at risk of losing one or both parents , and sometimes suffering discrimination because of_their_own medical condition , these children are often in critical need of legal assistance . To help meet this need , two organizations dealing with_children affected by HIV / AIDS launched a project last week to help them with their sometimes overwhelming legal problems . The project is the Los Angeles Pediatric AIDS Network , a collaborative venture of the Wilshire-based Alliance for Children ' s Rights and the Los Angeles Pediatric AIDS Network . Called L.A. PALS , the project consists_of a network of more_than 400 volunteer attorneys from the Los Angeles area who will assist low-income juvenile clients with issues such_as legal guardianship and adoption , health_care problems , access to Social_Security benefits and services , civil_rights , foster care , special_education and blocked trusts , all at no cost . General income limits for eligibility are : $ 18 # 265 for a family of one ( such_as a child who has been orphaned but was left a trust_account or life_insurance ) ; $ 20 # 887 for a family of two ; $ 23 # 475 for a family of three , and $ 26 # 100 for a family of four . Families with income levels surpassing the general limits are also welcome , project manager Brenda O ' Neill said . &quot; We want to ensure that all kids have legal_representation , &quot; she said . &quot; we ' ll make referrals for families who can afford legal assistance , and take_on families who can ' t. &quot; One key problem faced by the children of AIDS patients is the need for legal guardianship if their parent or parents are overcome or die of the disease , O ' Neal said . Children who are infected can also face the denial of medical and social_services , as well as civil_rights violations such_as being denied access to a day-care center based on the child ' s medical_diagnosis . Because many children affected by HIV / AIDS live beneath the poverty level without access to legal_representation , many end_up going without the social , medical and educational services they are entitled to , O ' Neal said . The idea is that the volunteer attorneys will act_as advocates for low-income families whose lives have been affected by the virus , ensuring these children ' s needs are met . Legal services will be offered Spanish as well as English , and many of the volunteer attorneys are willing to travel_to meet their clients at_home , O ' Neal said . The Alliance for Children ' s Rights is the only free legal services organization in Los Angeles County that is devoted entirely to children . Since its inception three years ago , the alliance has provided legal assistance to over 2 # 300 children . The Los Angeles Pediatric AIDS Network is the principal provider of medical and social_services to children affected by HIV / AIDS in the city . Information : ( 213 ) 368-6010 .</TEXT>
