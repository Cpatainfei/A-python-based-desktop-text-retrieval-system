   <HEADLINE> FRENCHMAN ON_TRIAL FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ; WORLD_WAR_II : OFFICER IN THE PRO-NAZI MILITIA ALLEGEDLY ORDERED JEWS EXECUTED . DEFENSE LIKENS HIM TO SCHINDLER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Still wrestling with its World_War_II past , France put Paul Touvier , the 78-year-old former intelligence chief of the pro-Nazi French militia , on_trial Thursday in a heavily guarded courthouse for crimes against humanity committed half a century ago . Touvier -- now a balding , feeble man -- sat quietly in a bulletproof glass enclosure as a jury of nine , seven of whom were born after the war , began hearing allegations that he ordered the execution of seven Jewish hostages in Rillieux-la-Pape , near Lyon , on June 29 , 1944 . The trial in Versailles , on the southwest edge of Paris , and the difficult legal battle that was waged to bring Touvier to court have touched a raw nerve throughout France . The country , painfully fractured during World_War_II by the Nazi-installed Vichy government ' s collaboration with the German occupation , is again divided . Many French see the trial , which is expected to last five weeks , as a way to finally exorcise the ghosts of the past , allowing the country to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the D-Day Allied landings in Normandy in June with a clear conscience . Only with such a trial , they say , can the country truly heal the wounds of its past . But others in France see the proceedings , against an elderly man with prostate cancer , as a waste_of_time and taxpayers ' money . And they say it is time now to forgive , once and for all , their German adversaries . &quot; We are , by far , the European_country that has had the most trouble managing and digesting its collective attitude toward World_War_II , &quot; Bertrand Poirot-Delpech , of the_French Academy , wrote recently . &quot; The Versailles trial will not be in vain if the past finally finds its place there. &quot; Touvier is the first Frenchman to be tried_for crimes against humanity , although his former boss , Klaus Barbie , the Nazi police_chief of Lyon , was convicted of crimes against humanity in 1987 . Barbie died in a prison hospital in Lyon in 1991 . This landmark case , which , like Barbie ' s , is being filmed for posterity , began Thursday with a defense motion to dismiss 33 of 34 plaintiffs in the case , most of whom are Holocaust survivors or relatives of the executed Jews . Gerard Weltzer , a lawyer for one of the civil plaintiffs , argued that Touvier &quot; does not want to hear his victims speak. &quot; The motion was dismissed by Henri Boulard , the presiding judge . Several hundred people packed the courtroom , including almost 40 lawyers . Outside the courthouse , behind barricades manned by more_than 100 riot police , several dozen relatives of Jews sent to Nazi death camps protested , unfurling banners that read : &quot; Touvier-Barbie , Same Fight. &quot; The protesters argue that France is trying to cover_up the occupation government ' s role in the killing of Jews . Touvier was arrested in 1947 , but escaped and spent 45 years concealed by conservative Roman_Catholic priests and monks , mostly in Italy and France , and for a time received a regular pension from a Catholic charity . He was arrested in 1989 at a monastery in Nice and released on bail . But he is being held_in custody during the trial , as required by law . Touvier has admitted that he handpicked the men who executed the seven Jews in reprisal for the assassination , by Resistance fighters , of the Vichy regime ' s propaganda chief , Philippe Henriot , after the D-Day landing . The victims , ages 23 to 64 , were lined_up against a cemetery wall , shot in the back , then in the head . But Touvier ' s attorneys intend to argue that , in selecting seven Jews for execution , Touvier saved 93 other Jewish hostages whom the Nazis wanted to kill as well . His lawyer , Jacques Tremolet de Villers , has compared Touvier to Oskar Schindler , the German industrialist and Nazi_party member who saved more_than 1 # 100 people from death camps . The prosecution , however , along with relatives of the victims as plaintiffs , blames Touvier for dozens , if not hundreds , of killings of Resistance fighters . And they contend that Touvier was one of 30 # 000 French militiamen who collaborated with the Nazis out of a shared desire to exterminate the Jews . Touvier was twice sentenced to death in absentia after the war . He was pardoned in 1971 by then-President Georges Pompidou after appeals from Catholic clergy . Asked why he made that decision , Pompidou once said : &quot; Must we keep the wounds of national discord eternally bleeding ? Has not the moment come_to cast a veil , to forget those days when the_French people hated each other ? &quot; Touvier , in a pamphlet that appeared in 1979 , argued : &quot; All I ever did was to protect the_French state. &quot; But another time , cited by the newspaper Le Monde , Touvier confided to a friend : &quot; My whole life has been an enormous deception. &quot; Touvier won an appeals court verdict in 1992 that barred the state from putting him on_trial for other murders and acts of torture , which were deemed to be war_crimes and , as such , covered by the statute of limitations . Only the execution of the seven Jews qualified as a crime against humanity , for which there is no time_limit for prosecution . A crime against humanity , in French law , is defined as a crime willingly carried_out as part of a deliberate policy of genocide . Several current and former government officials are_on the list of witnesses . But the judge said Thursday that Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur had indicated that he would not testify . Balladur was a middle-level bureaucrat in Pompidou ' s office when the pardon was issued . About 10 # 000 French_people were executed as collaborators after the war , often after summary trials . Those prosecutions ended in the 1950s as postwar French authorities attempted to downplay the activities of the Vichy regime and cast the_French as a heroic people , betrayed by only a_few traitors .</TEXT>
