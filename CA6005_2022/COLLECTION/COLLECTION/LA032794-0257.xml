   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI : EXCESS SAVINGS MAY STILL BE INSURED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q : I goofed and allowed more_than $ 100 # 000 in savings to accumulate in a bank that recently failed . If the bank ' s insurance does not cover the excess and I lose the money , may I write_off the loss ? Is there anything I can do or place I can appeal_to prevent the loss of that money ? -- E.L.Y . * A : You should consider any loss a non-business bad_debt . You may write it off against any capital_gains you have from investments , with any excess deductible against up_to $ 3 # 000 of ordinary income per year . Of course , despite the size of your account , you may still qualify for full insurance protection . It all depends_on how many accounts you have , the type of accounts and how the accounts are held . Insurance coverage rules are detailed and complicated . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . publishes a free pamphlet explaining the rules to consumers . Send a postcard requesting the pamphlet to the FDIC ' s Consumer Affairs Division , 550 17th St . NW , Washington , D.C. 20429 . Consumers may also call the FDIC Consumer Hot Line at ( 800 ) 934-3342 . Rules on Claiming a Home Profit Exemption Q : My late husband sold a house prior to our marriage and used his $ 125 # 000 profit exemption . Now I am about to sell my house . Am I entitled to use my $ 125 # 000 exemption or did I lose_it because I married someone who had already used his ? Also , I briefly rented_out my house several years ago . Does this ruin my ability to use the exemption ? -- F.P . * A : Assuming that you never used a $ 125 # 000 exemption in the past , now that you are a widow , you are entitled to claim one . As long as you were married to someone who had already used an exemption -- even though it was prior to your marriage -- you were not entitled to one . But now that you are single , and assuming no prior use , you may claim the exemption so_long as you meet the qualifying criteria . You must own the home you are selling ; it must be your principal residence , and you must have lived there for three of the last five years . Community_Property Weighs on Trust Value Q : My wife and I have a revocable trust and have put all_of our property into it . Will those assets be revalued as of the date of death of one of us ? These assets are community_property , but I am unsure if the fact that they are held_in a revocable living_trust affects whether they qualify for a step-up in value . Please help . -- B.H.M . * A : If these assets are truly community_property , the fact that they are now in a trust changes nothing . They should be treated to a full step-up in value upon the death of one of the spouses . Merely establishing a trust for your assets does not change their essential nature . And , in fact , common language used in most trust documents clearly states that the assets in the trust retain the character they had prior to the establishment of the trust . Gift_Tax Limits More Taxing Than They Seem Q : In a recent column , you discussed the amount a couple could give to their son and his wife without triggering gift_tax consequences . I am a single woman without parents or children . How may I take_advantage of giving $ 10 # 000 to someone ? -- S.P . * A : Any taxpayer , regardless of marital_status , may give any other taxpayer up_to $ 10 # 000 per year without setting_off gift_tax consequences . There are no limits on the number of people you may shower with your generosity each year , but there is a ceiling on the amount you may give_away without tax complications . But what does this really mean ? Contrary to some mistaken beliefs , giving_away $ 10 # 000 to a family member or friend does not entitle you to a $ 10 # 000 tax_deduction . These gifts are not charitable contributions . Rather , they are gifts you make with money on which you have already paid income_taxes . The recipient pays no taxes and does not have to report its receipt . The benefit , such_as it is , to the donor is that these annual gifts of up_to $ 10 # 000 are not considered a part of the $ 600 # 000 all_of us are allowed to give_away over our lifetime ( and at death ) outside of the grasp of estate_taxes . So , to the extent that your estate will exceed $ 600 # 000 , you may want to give it away in small chunks before death to keep Uncle_Sam from getting a piece of it . However , giving_away more_than $ 10 # 000 to any one person in any single year is hardly the end of the world . If you do this , you are required only to file a gift_tax report to the Internal Revenue Service , which results in the amount over $ 10 # 000 simply being deducted from your $ 600 # 000 lifetime exemption . No additional taxes are levied immediately for this burst of generosity . But if you exceed your $ 600 # 000 lifetime exemption , the excess in your estate will be subject_to estate_taxes . Cut Bond Liability by Staggering Redemption Q : I have several Series HH savings bonds that will soon mature . Because these bonds were purchased by rolling_over proceeds from Series E savings bonds that were never taxed , I face a tax_liability on $ 675 of every $ 1 # 000 bond I have . How can I cash_in these bonds and pay the least amount of income_tax ? -- N.N.P . * A Your only option is to stagger the redemption of the bonds over several years to insure that their proceeds do not push you into a higher income_tax_bracket or force you to pay more taxes on any Social_Security income you receive .</TEXT>
