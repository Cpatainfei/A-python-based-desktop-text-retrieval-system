   <HEADLINE> BORDER SEPARATING N . KOREA FROM CHINA APPEARS TOO POROUS TO SEAL ; ASIA : A TRIP ALONG THE TUMEN RIVER SUGGESTS JUST HOW DIFFICULT IMPOSING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON NORTH WOULD BE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the Chinese side of the border , a convoy of seven North_Korean flatbed trucks , sagging under their load of several tons of Chinese rice , rumbled under an ornamental gate on their way across the Tumen River to North_Korea . Half a mile or so across the shallow , snow-fed river on a recent afternoon here , a North_Korean steam_engine whistled impatiently as it waited to receive the vital cargo and transport it to the hungry interior . North_Korea is an economically strapped nation where food is strictly rationed and where the patriotic goal , still unrealized , is two meals a day for all citizens . U.S. reporters granted a rare visit to the Chinese-North Korean border here in Jilin province recently watched a steady flow of such goods being transported between Tumen , one of seven border-crossing points in the province , and the North_Korean town on the opposite bank . Local officials said the trade has increased in recent months as the threat of U.N. economic sanctions against North_Korea has mounted because of its suspected nuclear_weapons program . The prospect of such sanctions seemed to recede over the weekend after former President Jimmy_Carter ' s visit . But if they ever materialize , North_Korea would rely even more heavily on its main link to the outside -- the corridor of northeast China along the Tumen River where North_Korea , China and Russia meet . More_than 40 % of North_Korea ' s $ 736 million in trade with China -- its main lifeline for grains , other food and fuel -- passes_through this remote area that is home to most of China ' s ethnic Korean population . For any U.N. sanctions to succeed , this border would have to be sealed . But those who know the area say that would be a difficult , if not impossible , task for several reasons : * Security along the 312-mile border in Jilin province is minimal , and smuggling is rampant . Few expect the Chinese government to vigorously enforce sanctions even if they are approved by the United Nations . * Since 1982 , when the border reopened after a 12-year break_in friendly relations between the two countries sparked by China ' s Cultural Revolution , trade with North_Korea has become one of the most important factors_in the local economy . Sun Jinhu , deputy director of foreign trade for the Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture here , said the biggest increase in cross-border trade has come_in the past two years -- a jump from $ 80 million in 1991 to more_than $ 300 million last year . About 22 North_Korean companies operate small joint-venture businesses , mostly hotels and restaurants , on the Chinese side . * Ethnic and language ties among Koreans on both sides of the border are likely to subvert any attempt to implement sanctions meant to punish North_Korea for its nuclear stance . Korean Chinese rallied in great numbers to fight alongside their cross-border neighbors and relatives during the Korean_War against American-led U.N. forces . Monuments to local soldiers killed in the conflict line both banks of the Tumen River . The nearly 1 million Korean Chinese who live_in the Tumen River valley would probably resist any foreign efforts to close the border . &quot; More_than 40 % of our population is ethnic Korean , &quot; Sun said . &quot; They share the same habits , language and lifestyle with the people across the border in the Democratic People ' s Republic_of_Korea ( North_Korea ) . &quot; In Yanji , the major city of the Korean Chinese ethnic minority area , waitresses in joint-venture restaurants wear lapel buttons bearing a photograph of North_Korean leader Kim Il Sung . Korean singers in slinky gowns at the Bai Shan Nightclub croon North_Korean ballads . The many stalls at the West Market in downtown Yanji sell North_Korean products , ranging from red_fox pelts to the gray stone pots and griddles highly prized in the Korean community . If the sanctions proposal ever does come_to a vote before the U.N. Security_Council , the Chinese government is expected to abstain . But even if the sanctions were approved , their success would depend_upon Chinese enforcement along this border . And there is no evidence here of a Chinese willingness or even ability to take this step . From 1970 to 1982 , the Chinese government officially closed its border with North_Korea , both because of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and because North_Korea had taken the Soviet side in the Sino-Soviet split . But even then the closing had little effect on the Korean population . When the political persecution of the Cultural Revolution became too intense , Koreans simply crossed over to the &quot; motherland &quot; to wait out the storm . When the Tumen River froze , as it does each winter , families walked across , as they have for centuries , to visit relatives on the other side . Today , with relations repaired , the Tumen River is not so_much a border as it is an inconvenience . Despite the severity of the North_Korean regime , the border is one of the least secured in the world . &quot; We have a ( 312-mile ) border with North_Korea , &quot; said Chao Zhizhong , vice general_manager of the Yanbian Foreign Economic Trade Co. , which does $ 27 million in business annually with the North_Koreans . &quot; We have a long history of relationships and trade along the Tumen River . People come and go freely. &quot; The government recently announced a crackdown on smuggling along the border . But there was little evidence of any new precautions during a recent visit . In a two-hour drive along the river between Yanji , capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture , and the Russian border , the only evidence of border security was at lightly manned border-crossing stations and a_few scattered watchtowers . The most lasting impression from the trip was the huge gap in prosperity between the Chinese and their North_Korean neighbors . Compared with the Chinese side of the border , undergoing a development boom sparked by the drive to develop the lower stretch of the Tumen River as a port linking China to the Sea_of_Japan , Korean villages on the other bank of the river looked shabby and silent . Traffic was heavy along broad new stretches of highway on the Chinese side , including hundreds of expensive imported four-wheel-drive trucks . But except for a pair of_aging steam_engines and the decrepit convoy of trucks on the Tumen bridge , there was no sign of motorized transport on the North_Korean side . In their arguments against sanctions , Chinese officials here argue that what North_Korea needs most is not isolation but more exposure to the emerging market_economy of its huge neighbor and former comrade in arms . North_Korea is particularly sensitive about its dependence on China for the most basic commodities . At the Tumen border station , photographers have erected colorful backdrops featuring Chinese and North_Korean flags so that visitors can be photographed with North_Korea in the background . But when American reporters began photographing the rice-laden trucks , a North_Korean official appealed vainly to Chinese officials to confiscate the film . Trade Gateway China is the main route for goods into North_Korea . More_than $ 300 million worth of goods passes_through the remote corridor of northeast China along the Tumen River near where North_Korea , China and Russia meet .</TEXT>
