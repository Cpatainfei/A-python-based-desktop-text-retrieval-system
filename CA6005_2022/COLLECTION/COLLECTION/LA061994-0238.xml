   <TEXT> Arthur Miller stands_in the doorway of the Southbury bus_depot , waiting for the 10:45 to arrive -- late , as usual -- and keeping an eye peeled for the interviewer he has volunteered to fetch . The visor on his cap masks his face , but at more_than six feet , he ' s still hard to miss . Craggily handsome at 78 , the man who is arguably America ' s most famous living playwright may look a bit imperious , but his manner is anything but . Driving through the verdant hills and two-barn towns of rural Connecticut , he plays the tour guide . In a gravelly voice summoned from the vast deep of a Brooklyn youth , Miller explains everything from local flora to the region ' s desiccated defense industry . More avuncular than pedantic , he ' s got the deadpan of a master kibitzer down cold . He likes to ask questions too , listening intently when talk turns_to the California economy . Miller has , after all , long been interested in how the average Joe gets_by . As Lillian Hellman could not and would &quot; not cut ( her ) conscience to fit this year ' s fashions , &quot; Arthur Miller has not abandoned the dramatic realism and socially and ethically charged concerns that he first brought_to Broadway 50 years ago . But it hasn ' t been an easy five decades . &quot; Broken Glass , &quot; Miller ' s first Broadway outing_in 14 years , received mostly positive reviews and a Tony nomination for best play . Still , the production , which just opened in April , will close next Sunday . Serious plays , it seems , hardly ever last on Broadway these days . Tony Kushner ' s &quot; Perestroika , &quot; which won this year ' s best play Tony , is the only new drama on Broadway that ' s been able to survive this season . The year began with the almost-instant closing of &quot; Wonderful Tennessee , &quot; a work by Ireland ' s distinguished dramatist Brian Friel . Similarly , both Robert Schenkkan ' s &quot; The Kentucky Cycle &quot; and Anna Deavere Smith ' s &quot; Twilight : Los Angeles , 1992 &quot; -- both of also nominated for the best play Tony -- lasted for fewer performances than &quot; Broken Glass. &quot; However , &quot; Broken Glass &quot; has a new life ahead . It went_into rehearsal Monday at London ' s National Theatre , and a Paris production is also in the offing . Indeed , Miller ' s work is as popular as ever , with shows running in at least five countries besides the United States this year alone . Attention is also being paid on other fronts . Kenneth Branagh is scheduled to direct and star in Miller ' s own screenplay of &quot; The Crucible , &quot; and Pulitzer-winning composer William Bolcom is making an opera of &quot; A View From the Bridge. &quot; Abroad , he is considered America ' s greatest living playwright . Arthur Miller is , beyond dispute , the most senior of the country ' s actively working serious dramatists . Yet not since &quot; Death of a Salesman &quot; has he received the recognition in America that he inspires abroad . After years of mostly Off Broadway productions and unenthusiastic response here , &quot; Broken Glass &quot; marked a comeback of sorts , albeit a bitter one given the short run . * Although Miller didn ' t set_out with a topical agenda , &quot; Broken Glass &quot; is timely . Set_in 1938 Brooklyn , it raises contemporary issues of ethnic separatism and anti-Semitism . &quot; I ' ve probably been influenced in selecting the theme by the recrudescence of anti-Semitism in this world , which is something that I would n ' t have believed , &quot; Miller says . &quot; It always comes as a surprise , whenever it happens . It ' s ' Well , that ' s over with ; it ' s not going_to happen anymore , ' and suddenly , there it is again. &quot; Miller has spent a career dissecting public and private morality . In fact , he has more_than once been called an American Ibsen , including , most recently , by the New York Times ' David Richards . But that ' s not the stuff of which boffo box_office is made these days . &quot; It ' s a comment on the theater , &quot; said Robert Whitehead , a co-producer of &quot; Broken Glass &quot; and a 40-year veteran of Broadway , speaking on the day it was announced that the play would close . &quot; A play of this depth has a tough time right now . It has to do with the kind of taste that has been generated by an endless mass of television : It ' s Las Vegas time . But Arthur Miller ' s position is there forever. &quot; Asked to comment on the announced closing , Miller expressed a grim view of Broadway : &quot; ' Broken Glass ' must close after some 10 weeks in New York because the costs of running are greater than the receipts . This despite many sellouts . &quot; End of ' Broken Glass ' ? Not at all . It is in rehearsal at the Royal National Theatre , London . It will be done_in the fall_in Paris at the Theatre Marigny , and in Munich and other German cities next winter . &quot; Some plays fail because they are failures . This play , as a play , is precisely what I wanted it to be and is beautifully performed . Its audiences , I dare say , have been spellbound . &quot; The conditions of non-musical theater production in New York are what have failed , not ' Broken Glass. ' In a city of so many millions , mine was the only straight play to have been initiated on Broadway . We used to have a crisis ; we are now post-crisis , in catastrophe . &quot; At the Tony Awards ceremony , a sad self-congratulatory farce , it was proudly announced that Broadway shows took_in more money than ever last year . This is theater as a form of banking . No doubt if they continue raising ticket prices , they will take_in even more money next year -- but it ' s not even true ; they didn ' t mention that the total take included shows on_the_road , not just Broadway . &quot; If people want symphony_orchestras , ballet , opera , they have to subsidize productions . We will not subsidize serious theater . We insist on theater-for-profit . And that is the theater we have . There ' s only one problem : Where is it ? &quot; Whitehead agrees that more_than art , the story of Broadway success is of pure economics . &quot; There is a confluence of reasons that make_it difficult for any serious piece_of_work , &quot; he said . &quot; If we could live with the price of a ticket that was between $ 25 and $ 30 , you could go_on forever . It ' s just that you can ' t run a show on that basis with the overhead the way it is , particularly as you look_into July , when business is always rotten. &quot; But that doesn ' t mean Miller isn ' t held_in high esteem , especially by those in the theater . Indeed , he ' s a writer who inspires lofty comparisons . &quot; It makes me nervous when people question the relevance of great writers , whether they ' re living , like Arthur Miller , or dead , like Shakespeare , &quot; says Old Globe artistic director Jack O ' Brien , who directed Miller ' s &quot; All My Sons &quot; and his adaptation of Ibsen ' s &quot; An Enemy of the People &quot; for PBS ' &quot; American Playhouse. &quot; O ' Brien says that both Shakespeare and Miller &quot; are extremely moral men who value language and who display their sense_of_humor in unexpected ways . ( Miller ) speaks_to something basic and true in us , and we respond. &quot; But familiarity may breed , if not contempt , then comparative neglect . &quot; It ' s so easy for the well- and ill-intended to dismiss Arthur because he has lasted so_long , &quot; continues O ' Brien , who directed this year ' s Tony-nominated revival of &quot; Damn Yankees. &quot; &quot; We think , ' Oh , we can ' t possibly be dealing with those questions again. ' But , yes , we are. &quot; * As Miller steers his oldish gray sedan up the driveway of his homestead , Sebastian , a neighbor dog who likes to hang_out there , is lying_in the middle of the garage floor . Miller stops , waiting patiently for the pooch to clear_out , and then pulls_in . Through the garage door , beyond the spacious green lawn , are two small studios where Miller and his wife of 32 years , photographer Inge Morath , work . Arthur Miller wears khakis and tennies with a light blue cotton shirt . He sits on lived-in patio furniture near the house he ' s called home since 1956 and talks_about how topical his latest play has turned_out to be . &quot; I didn ' t realize that the Holocaust was going_to be such the issue , with ' Schindler ' s List ' and the museum in Washington and so forth , &quot; he says . &quot; That wasn ' t really the center of my concentration . It was , rather , the mystery of how this social-political dilemma lodged_in this woman ' s limbs , so to speak , reaching across 3 # 000 miles of water. &quot; &quot; Broken Glass , &quot; which features Amy Irving , Ron Rifkin and David Dukes and is directed by John Tillinger , is about a Jewish woman who , upon reading of the rising anti-Semitic violence in Europe , develops a hysterical paralysis in her legs . Neither her uptight husband ( Rifkin ) nor a charming neighborhood doctor ( Dukes ) are able to bring her out of it . Miller ' s title suggests the shards of a domestic spat -- the kind that the husband and wife , who have been sexually estranged for years , may have had . But it also refers to Germany ' s Kristallnacht , the 1938 night of rioting in which the Nazis went_on a rampage , shattering the windows of and setting fire to Jewish shops and synagogues . The years 1937 and 1938 stand_out in the playwright ' s memory . &quot; 1937 was the year I bought a radio from a friend of mine , &quot; recalls Miller , who was a student at the University of Michigan at the time . &quot; By sheer accident , I turned it on one evening and got Europe . I heard this screaming , and I knew enough German to understand vaguely what it was . It was Hitler . The Germans were broadcasting the speech worldwide , and it was hysteria . It sounded like a crazy person . That was the year before this play takes place. &quot; Miller graduated in 1938 , and the following November came Kristallnacht . &quot; It was , historically , the hour when this whole_thing exploded with the first incredible viciousness , &quot; he says . &quot; There ' d always been anti-Semitism in Europe -- everybody knew that . But the Kristallnacht was the first dramatic thing that people were aware of , that told them this was not the old ballgame , that this was something new and incredible . * Sylvia Gellburg , the protagonist in &quot; Broken Glass , &quot; reads about these horrors and suddenly finds her legs paralyzed . From her wheelchair , she mixes her anger at what ' s going_on in Europe with her own private anguish . &quot; What I did with my life ! &quot; she cries_out to her husband in that signature Miller-esque mix of Brooklyn idiom and heightened prose familiar to anyone who ' s ever seen &quot; Death of a Salesman. &quot; &quot; Out of ignorance . Out of not wanting to shame you in front of other people . A whole life . Gave it away like a_couple_of pennies . I took better care of my shoes. &quot; It ' s a voice , a milieu , that Miller ' s always carried with him . Born in 1915 in Harlem , he grew_up in a middle-class Jewish family that was financially devastated by the Depression . He worked in a warehouse for two years to scrape together college tuition and at the University of Michigan found his calling as a playwright . Miller ' s war diary &quot; Situation Normal &quot; was published in 1944 , the same year he had his first production in a professional theater -- &quot; The Man Who Had All the Luck &quot; -- which ran only four performances . In 1945 his first ( and only ) novel , &quot; Focus , &quot; came_out , and in 1947 came &quot; All My Sons , &quot; his first critical success . He ' s also written a_few screenplays and various other works , yet is unequivocally most famous for his plays . The most notable of these -- &quot; Death of a Salesman , &quot; &quot; The Crucible , &quot; &quot; A View From the Bridge , &quot; &quot; After the Fall &quot; -- are considered classics , and others hover near that category . Miller is also remembered for standing_up to the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1956 , refusing to name names , and for his brief marriage to Marilyn Monroe . He was first married from 1940-56 , to Mary Slattery , then from 1956-60 to Monroe , and in 1962 to Morath . He has a son and a daughter by his first marriage and a daughter with Morath . He and Morath have collaborated on a number of photography books , and his 1987 autobiography , &quot; Timebends , &quot; is dedicated to her . Above all , Miller has always been known as a man of the theater , although it ' s become a harder road to hoe since the 1950s . He is one of the few artists with a five-decade overview of Broadway ' s rise and fall . &quot; I think there was a shift in the mid or late ' 50s , &quot; Miller says . &quot; Some part of the population moved_out of New York , into the suburbs . That solid middle_class that was the audience of the theater in New York got dispersed. &quot; But the decline of Manhattan theater was not just a matter of demographics . The nature of the theater and plays also changed , he says . &quot; They got_to be more and more special . The abstract theater moved_in . It ' s a terrifically interesting theater , but not for the mass of people . They felt left_out . They figured it wasn ' t for them anymore , and they went_to the movies , where they still got stories , characters and situations they were familiar with. &quot; Although the atmosphere for theater in this country has never been very accommodating , it was once better than it is now . &quot; We had a mythology that theater was about prominent values of some kind and show_business was something else , &quot; says Miller . &quot; Theater didn ' t run as long as show_business normally . However , everybody assumed that the theater was about matters that had to do with the spirit and there was room for that -- small room , but there was room. &quot; That there is almost no more such room is , according to Miller , simply the byproduct of capitalism . &quot; There are virtues to this system , but one of them is not the arts , &quot; he says . &quot; At the same time , we create more of contemporary art in every field than anybody else . We ' ve got an immense population , and , just by the law of averages , you get a lot done. &quot; When it comes_to the theater , the lasting literature has been a relatively populist one . &quot; Our theater is probably the most popular : Williams , Albee , I and a_few others have tried to do serious work , but it ' s been work that was aimed at the big audience because it ' s a democratic country , &quot; Miller says . &quot; It wasn ' t aimed at a small clique . There are playwrights who write for a small clique , but they don ' t travel much. &quot; Now , though , that big audience has become much harder for the stage to reach , and revivals are the order_of_the_day . &quot; For a New York producer to take an unknown writer and back him , the financial gamble is tremendous , &quot; says Miller . &quot; So they go_for the time-tested stuff. &quot; There hasn ' t been much room in Miller ' s own country for his kind of drama in recent years -- although he has continued to have success in England and elsewhere . The only time he ' s been_on Broadway in the past couple of decades was with 1980 ' s &quot; The American Clock , &quot; which lasted only 12 performances . In London , however , the same play was nominated for the Olivier award for best play . Miller ' s 1987 Lincoln Center one-acts , &quot; Danger / Memory ! , &quot; were not well-liked here either . And 1993 ' s &quot; The Last Yankee &quot; was given a tepid reception when it opened at the Manhattan Theatre Club , although it went_on to an eight-month run in London ' s West_End . He also blames , as he writes in &quot; Timebends , &quot; that &quot; lethal New York combination of a single all-powerful newspaper and a visionless if not irresponsible theater management , some sectors of which had , yes , profiteered to_the_point where the whole theatrical enterprise was gasping and near death . . . . &quot; Other problems include getting well-trained actors who are willing to work hard for relatively little pay . &quot; It ' s hard for us to cast plays , &quot; Miller says . &quot; There ' s no money in it comparatively . I know one guy on a television_show -- last week he had six lines for that show , and he gets $ 40 # 000 a week . Well , there ' s no way to do that in theater . There ' s a_few of them who are just crazy about acting in the theater , but there are not many. &quot; * A nattily dressed Stanley Kauffmann , the former New York Times theater_critic and , since 1958 , film critic for the New Republic , sits in the Booth Theatre on a warm May afternoon , taking_in a matinee performance of the latest work by a writer who is exactly his own age : 78 . This does not happen often . Kauffmann calls Miller &quot; a vigorous man who ' s very interested in the world , a compassionate , humane man . How many playwrights in the world are there who , while still alive , enter into world repertory as he has ? that ' s inarguable. &quot; Yet Kauffmann also has reservations . &quot; At the same time , he ' s genuine and undisturbing , like an ad for Common Cause , &quot; he says . &quot; He ' s a good , sound old-fashioned , traditional moralist -- which is not something to scoff at , but neither is it exciting in art . He ' s really a middle-class homilist. &quot; Kauffmann ' s opinions -- which are echoed in the respectful yet qualified praise Miller sometimes elicits from American critics -- differ from the particularly high regard with which the playwright is held_in England . Miller regularly travels there to see productions of his plays , and he holds the_British system in great esteem . One key difference between American and British theater is that the latter receives government money . &quot; The main thing about British theater is that they have these four or five subsidized theaters in London , &quot; Miller says . &quot; Since the deficits are made_up by the government , they can afford to experiment more . &quot; They can still play something twice a week to a half-empty house because somebody believes that it ' s valuable . It makes the difference between feeling that you ' re in a world of art or a world of business. &quot; Miller will travel_to London in July for the Aug . 5 opening of &quot; Broken Glass. &quot; &quot; I have to agree , which I ' m delighted to do , to meet that audience in the Olivier Theatre , which is immense , for two hours , &quot; says Miller . &quot; And they ' ll come and ask questions . The place will be packed . &quot; I could do_it a whole week if I wanted to , and I ' m not alone in this , &quot; Miller continues . &quot; The authors usually do that , and they keep a relationship going_with that audience . There ' s a communal feeling about the whole_thing . They haven ' t lost the theater culture there yet . I attribute it to the subsidized theaters. &quot; Miller also enjoys the ways in which his plays have been received in other countries . &quot; Everybody thinks , ' How could they understand &quot; Death of a Salesman &quot; in China ? ' &quot; says Miller . &quot; But everybody forgets that the Chinese invented business , about 6 # 000 years ago , and that the communist era is much less of the history of that society. &quot; In 1983 , Miller directed &quot; Death of a Salesman &quot; in Beijing . &quot; Bill Moyers did a piece about the play in China , &quot; he recalls . &quot; They interviewed a young_man coming_out of the theater , and he said : ' Oh , that Willy Loman , he ' s right . Everybody wants to be No . 1 . That Biff , he ' s all wrong. ' &quot; Biff represented to him the very serious , rather boring , socially responsible guy . Willy represented the future , because they were smelling the scent of capitalism . It never dawned on me that of course they would see him as the hero who was misunderstood by everybody , including his family. &quot; In 1991 , Miller directed the same play in Stockholm . &quot; We used to think this ( the expendability of workers , and salesmen ) was an American problem , because Swedes have had a kind of quasi-socialism where you had a lot of security and Willy ' s getting fired would n ' t happen , &quot; he says . &quot; This was the mythology . I never believed it . And now all that insecurity is there . They caught_up_with us. &quot; Kauffmann , who recalls first seeing actor Marcello Mastroianni in a 1956 production of &quot; Death of a Salesman &quot; in Rome directed by filmmaker Luchino Visconti , thinks the appeal may be_on a more personal level . &quot; You never saw Brooklyn look_like that in your life , &quot; jokes Kauffmann about the staging . &quot; But there was something about the father-son struggle -- a recurrent theme -- that meant a great_deal to them . They take ( Miller ) abroad as a voice of a certain period in American life and history. &quot; That voice will continue to be heard in theaters around the world , as well as in small theaters across this country -- and perhaps even on Broadway again , although the climate looks as though it will remain hostile . And Miller will continue to write and work in the theater . In addition to his impending trip to London for the National ' s staging of &quot; Broken Glass , &quot; Miller is also writing these days . &quot; I ' m working_on something , &quot; he says . &quot; I don ' t know whether it ' s going_to be fiction or a play . It ' ll take me a while to find out. &quot; * Miller steers his steel-colored sedan back into the parking_lot of the Southbury bus_station . He puts the car in park and insists , despite his visitor ' s protests , on going inside to make_sure that there really is a 12:35 bus going_out . &quot; We ' re going to check , so we don ' t leave you here to rot , &quot; he says while striding into the comfortably bourgeoise depot , revealing a trace of the Jewish mother that lurks in so many Jewish fathers . He then asks a clerk not once , but twice , about the bus . Just to make_sure . Miller is , after all , a caretaker -- at once of his guests and of a vision of the American theater as a forum for the public conscience . He is also a precursor to much younger playwrights like Tony Kushner of &quot; Angels in America &quot; fame , whose works are driven by moral imperatives . Yet as the younger generation of politically driven theater writers , few though they may be , increasingly are lured toward film , the culture of serious drama remains in jeopardy . And Arthur Miller may well be the last of a breed . &quot; He came_in at just the right time , &quot; says Kauffmann . &quot; His seemed to me at the time to be the best of the flood of plays that were of that strident temper that had come_along since the Depression . There isn ' t that kind of belief now . There isn ' t that kind of faith in the future now -- an achievable , perfectable future. &quot;</TEXT>
