   <HEADLINE> THE APPEAL OF ' BASEBALL ' IN THE AUTUMN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> According to Judith Michaelson ' s article , &quot; For PBS at Least , ' Baseball ' Is a Hit -- but It ' s No ' Civil War ' &quot; ( Sept . 26 ) , the excellent program did not garner the numbers that &quot; Civil War &quot; got , but everyone at PBS is , nevertheless , satisfied . Who was the genius programmer at PBS who decided to run the series the same week all_the networks were starting their new season ? What a pity that a fine program had to lose its potential audience because of dumb programming . BEN HOFFMAN Monterey Park I am nearly 90 years old , and this will be the first time in my lifetime that a World_Series will not be played . Every major_league baseball owner and every major_league player should be forced to sit_down together to watch Ken Burns ' brilliant &quot; Baseball &quot; on PBS . Then they should hang their heads in shame . PAULINE C . KOENIG Los Angeles</TEXT>
