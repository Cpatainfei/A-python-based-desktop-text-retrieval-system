   <HEADLINE> FRANCE WINS U.N. OK FOR RWANDA PLAN ; AFRICA : FORCE WILL TRY TO END MASSACRES . FIRST TROOPS TO LAUNCH MISSION TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A divided Security_Council , wary of making things worse yet desperate to end the horror , authorized France on Wednesday to lead a military_force into Rwanda to stop the massacres that have left several hundred_thousand civilians dead in the midst of a tribal war . In Paris , Defense Minister Francois Leotard said the first few hundred French troops will launch &quot; Operation Turquoise &quot; this morning . He said France will contribute 2 # 000 to 2 # 500 troops . Senegal has pledged to augment this with an undisclosed number of its troops . Wednesday ' s Security_Council vote reflected the world body ' s unease about a Rwandan mission . France managed to muster only one more_than the nine votes required for the resolution . Five nations -- China , Nigeria , New Zealand , Brazil and Pakistan -- abstained . Their stated objections were twofold : that the intervention should be led by the United Nations , not France , and that one of the warring groups -- the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front -- says it regards the resolution as a declaration of war . Madeleine Albright , the American ambassador to the United Nations , voted for the resolution and hailed France for its &quot; bold . . . initiative &quot; and &quot; noble offer to lead the world community in dealing with the tragedy in Rwanda. &quot; &quot; The tales of butchery . . . become almost mind-numbing , &quot; she said . &quot; But we cannot afford to become numb to this tragedy , for it is still unfolding before our eyes. &quot; Despite her praise , the_French intervention , if successful , could prove embarrassing to the Clinton_Administration . Using Rwanda as the test_case of the Administration ' s stringent new policy on peacekeeping , Albright forced the Security_Council in mid-May to put conditions on its authorization of a U.N. peacekeeping mission of 5 # 500 troops . U.N. officials believe that the obvious lack of American enthusiasm for a U.N. intervention crippled Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ' s attempts to recruit troops for the mission then . His failure prompted France to offer to send its troops for two months while the United Nations organizes its own mission . The French intervention is unhampered by the conditions -- such_as approval from warring parties and signing of a cease-fire -- imposed on the United Nations by the United States . A successful Operation Turquoise would be regarded_as persuasive evidence that the Administration ' s conditions were unnecessary . The massacres erupted in Rwanda when the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi , both members of the Hutu tribe , died in a suspicious plane crash in April . The Hutu-dominated army and gangs of Hutu extremists then began a slaughter of the minority Tutsi tribe and of Hutu politicians willing to share power with the Tutsis . The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front then swooped down from the north to battle the Hutu army , taking_over perhaps half of the tiny , hilly country in Central_Africa . Weeks of civil_war have produced massacres of Hutus by the rebels as well . The rebels oppose the intervention because France has been a major supporter and arms supplier of the Hutu-dominated government . But French Ambassador Jean-Bernard Merimee told the council : &quot; The French initiative has an exclusively humanitarian goal . . . . Our objective is simple : Help the threatened civilians , end the massacres and do_it all_in an impartial way. &quot; The 10 countries voting in favor of the resolution were France , the United States , Rwanda , Britain , Russia , Oman , Spain , the Czech Republic , Djibouti and Argentina .</TEXT>
