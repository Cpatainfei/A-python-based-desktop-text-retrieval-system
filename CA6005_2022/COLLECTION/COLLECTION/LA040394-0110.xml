   <HEADLINE> PUMPED UP ; DODGER CATCHER AND 1993 ROOCKIE PHENOM MIKE PIAZZA SPENT THE OFF-SEASON LIFTING WEIGHTS , BUILDING CONFIDENCE SO HE CAN WARD OFF THE DREADED SOPHOMORE JINX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> MICHAEL JOSEPH PIAZZA ' S EYES SMOLDER WITH DEFIANCE . HE GLISTENS from two hours of pumping iron , his cheeks flushed with adrenaline . Now , the final exercise . He scoots his sweat pants up_to his knees . He steps his 220-pound , 6-foot-3 frame onto a tiny metal platform in front of a mirror and rises on his toes to flex his calves . He gazes . He scowls . &quot; Bird legs , &quot; he grumbles . For 23 minutes , Piazza , statistically the greatest rookie catcher ever , the most exciting Dodger since Fernando Valenzuela , works his calves with weights and leg lifts . He ' s pumping iron against the wishes of his father and his team manager . His voice is hoarse , concerned . &quot; This is not for baseball . . . or my father . This is for me , the girls . . . the beach. &quot; Piazza eyes his calves again and sighs , &quot; I have flamingo legs. &quot; Sure , OK , in Piazza ' s 25-year-old world of cyborg prowess and power , his legs must seem spindly under massive shoulders , biceps and forearms that bulge and ripple with a twitch , a flick of wrist . Those muscles produced extraordinary numbers in 1993 . His 35 home_runs are the most ever by a major-league rookie catcher . His 112 RBIs are third highest by a National League rookie . His . 318 batting_average led the team and was seventh highest in the league . Defensively , Piazza threw_out 58 base-stealers , which set a Dodger record and was highest in the major_leagues . He was named to the Associated Press and United Press International All-Star teams , and was awarded National League Rookie of the Year by the Baseball Writers Assn. , only the ninth unanimous decision in the award ' s 47-year history . &quot; He has the strongest set of hands I ' ve ever seen , &quot; says former Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia . &quot; Piazza is so strong . . . so powerful. &quot; Physically , Piazza is Robocatcher . Emotionally , Piazza is an intense perfectionist given to tantrums and smashing bats and helmets . In essence , Piazza is a hothouse tomato nurtured and cultivated by his father , a high-school dropout who parlayed a used-car lot into a $ 100-million empire . Vince Piazza , 60 , deservedly self-indulgent , admittedly obsessive , shamelessly self-centered , boasts without hesitation : &quot; It was me that gave Mike the tools . I ' m living my life through him. &quot; Vince decided that his son -- like it or not -- &quot; was gonna play baseball. &quot; When Mike was 11 , Vince fashioned a batting_cage from scrap wood outside their first home_in Phoenixville , near Philadelphia . Mike hit 200 to 300 balls each day -- rain , shine , sleet or snow . Aluminum bats shattered from the cold . Wooden bats splintered from Mike ' s growing power . Vince , in his euphoria , would whisper : &quot; Dear God , is it possible ? &quot; Vince left nothing to chance : Money , influence , his boyhood friendship and business dealings with Tommy I-Bleed-Dodger-Blue Lasorda , when necessary , to get his son into colleges , the minors and , eventually , the Dodgers . &quot; Vince Piazza spends so_much time on the field and around the dugout ; he ' d like to be wearing a uniform , &quot; says Johnny Bench , the Cincinnati Reds catching legend and Hall of Famer who covered baseball for CBS Radio . Young Piazza cringes at his father ' s incessant puppeteering . &quot; Nobody really knows the bitterness , the adversity , I went_through , &quot; Mike says . He quit the Dodger organization in a snit in 1990 , claiming that he was being tormented because of Lasorda ' s perceived favoritism . After talking to Lasorda and Dodger management , he returned to the team . Now Piazza must face the improbability of back-to-back miracle years , also known as the second-year wheeze , the sophomore jinx . The jinx is well-founded statistically and a dreaded curse in superstition-steeped baseball . Consider this : Since 1970 , 18 of 35 non-pitcher rookies of the year have dropped at least 17 points in their second-year batting_averages . &quot; Now we ' ll see what this Piazza kid ' s made of , &quot; says Yogi Berra , the New York Yankee Hall_of_Fame catcher who has seen more_than one rookie rocket crash and burn for lack of guts and grit . Adds Johnny Bench : &quot; This kid didn ' t get that power , that arm , put_up those numbers , from reading his name in the newspaper. &quot; But he cautions : &quot; The big thing mentally the second year is you ' re starting from zero . If you don ' t get_off to a good start , well , I don ' t know what ' s inside Mike Piazza ' s head. &quot; Piazza ponders the 1994 season after a grilled chicken dinner at his parents ' Valley Forge , Pa. , home , where he spent much of the off-season . He wears designer jeans and T-shirt . His voice is firm . &quot; I don ' t care about the sophomore jinx . I ' m not impressed . . . just go_out and don ' t give a s- - - . It ' s not the end of the world. &quot; He pauses , nibbles warm banana_bread baked by his mother , brushing crumbs from a weak Fu Manchu : &quot; Life , sports , everything is relative . My first job is to catch . My priority is to be strong defensively . . . win ballgames , not just to duplicate what I did last year . My thing to do is to first help the ballclub behind the plate . Catching keeps my feet on the ground . In a strange way , being a good catcher helps my hitting , takes the pressure off me . I ' m gonna do just what I did last year . This year I ' ll know the pitchers , be more relaxed , I ' ll do_better . I know I can do_it . My philosophy is , if it ' s not broken , I ' m not gonna fix it . I ' m confident in my ability and my work ethic. &quot; PIAZZA BEGAN HIS CAREER HITTING BALLS AGAINST MATTRESSES IN THE basement of his home . Then his father built the outdoor batting_cage . &quot; It would get so cold , we would have to warm the bats and balls by the stove and wrap pipe insulation around the bat handles , &quot; Vince says . Vince took other measures to enhance Mike ' s success . He strengthened his relationship with Lasorda , a boyhood friend in Norristown , Pa . He leased a building for a restaurant owned by Lasorda ' s three brothers and &quot; put Tommy into a car dealership &quot; in Pennsylvania . The car dealership , Vince says , was sold and Lasorda took a profit . When the Dodgers visited Philadelphia , Mike was the batboy . When Mike was 16 , Vince tracked_down hitting great Ted Williams , who was visiting a town nearby , and drove him to the Piazza house to coach his son for an afternoon . After Mike ' s graduation from high_school in 1986 , Vince persuaded Dodger bullpen coach Mark Cresse to let Mike live_in his California home for part of the summer and attend Cresse ' s baseball camp . &quot; I ' ve known Vince for 20 years , &quot; Cresse recalls . &quot; I did_it as a favor . Our first objective was teaching Mike to play first_base because he had grown quite a bit and it was a coordination thing . . . awkward . His body hadn ' t caught_up_with his legs yet . First_base was the best place to hide him defensively. &quot; Then the Piazzas turned_to Lasorda to get Mike into the University of Miami , a top baseball college . &quot; Tommy knew the coach , &quot; Mike recalls . &quot; Tommy stuck his neck out_to get me on . I couldn ' t fit into the program . I didn ' t even make the travel team . One of the things I did wrong was rely too_much on Tommy . We put all our eggs in one basket . I should have gone_to another school where I would have played more. &quot; Piazza was disillusioned , demoralized . &quot; I asked Tommy to call the coach at Miami Dade North Community_College . I became the starting first_baseman there. &quot; But near the end of the 1988 season , a collision split two knuckles and tore ligaments in Piazza ' s left hand . &quot; I went_home , &quot; he recalls . &quot; My father asked : ' What do you think_about becoming a catcher ? It ' s your best chance at making the majors. ' &quot; The Piazzas called_on another Dodger , former catcher Joe Ferguson , now an assistant coach with the team . After a 10-minute tryout , Ferguson told Lasorda and the Piazzas , &quot; The kid ' s got the arm . You can ' t teach arm strength . He can be a catcher. &quot; Piazza got a break_in the fall of 1988 , when the Dodgers used their 62nd draft choice on him . &quot; It was a meaningless courtesy pick , &quot; Piazza concedes . &quot; But it would look good on my resume. &quot; Vince offered to pay_for his son ' s airplane_ticket to Los Angeles if Dodger scouts would watch Mike hit and catch . Lasorda was warned not to meddle . Pitching to Piazza was an old friend . &quot; Cresse helped me out . He threw me good pitches. &quot; Cresse remembers : &quot; Didn ' t matter what I threw him . Piazza crushed me. &quot; The Dodgers offered a $ 15 # 000 signing bonus . &quot; I was finally a professional_baseball player , &quot; Piazza recalls with pride . Now Piazza had to learn to be a catcher . Lasorda called_in more favors . Piazza was sent to Campo Las Palmas baseball academy in the Dominican_Republic . Here ' s the rub : &quot; This camp , &quot; according to Dodger publicity , &quot; is dedicated to the youth of the Dominican_Republic . . . &quot; No Americans needed . Piazza became the camp ' s first American -- without the knowledge of Charlie Blaney , director of Dodger minor_league operations . &quot; I wanted to keep it low profile , &quot; Lasorda explains . &quot; Blaney ' s got nuthin ' to do with me . That kid had talent. &quot; &quot; It was the only place to go , &quot; Piazza says . He went_home six weeks later , at Christmas , complaining of food_poisoning . He went_to spring_training in Florida in March of 1989 . &quot; I got the flu . I didn ' t make the team. &quot; He was sent to the rookie-league Salem Dodgers in Oregon in June of 1989 . &quot; I started hitting . I made starting catcher. &quot; He was promoted to the Single-A Vero Beach Dodgers in March , 1990 , as first-string catcher . Piazza says he lost the starting spot in June , partly because he got mononucleosis . But the real reason , he insists , &quot; was political . Coach ( Joe ) Alvarez didn ' t like my attitude . Said I was not rah-rah enough. &quot; Piazza says Alvarez ridiculed him publicly , daring him to call Lasorda . &quot; I asked Alvarez why he was treating me like this . And Alvarez said , ' I was ordered to play with your head. ' &quot; Piazza threw_a_fit . &quot; I was pissed_off enough not to want to play baseball anymore . Screw it . I walked_out and went_home to pack. &quot; Within hours , &quot; Charlie Blaney called me and said what a terrible thing I had done_by walking out. &quot; Lasorda called Piazza . Blaney called_back . &quot; He said he had a meeting , &quot; recounts Piazza , &quot; and if I paid a $ 250 fine and apologized to the coach , I could go back. &quot; Recalls Lasorda : &quot; I told them , ' I don ' t want you jerking that kid around. ' &quot; Recalls Blaney : &quot; It ' s true that Tommy didn ' t tell me Mike went ( to the Dominican_Republic ) , but Tommy ' s the major-league manager and whatever he wants to do is OK with me . &quot; Mike in those early years was not a proficient catcher . Tommy was right on that one . No problem with me and Tommy on that one . I don ' t tell any ( minor_league ) managers to play with anybody ' s head . Mike is still here and Alvarez isn ' t . I let him go at the end of the season . What happened with Mike is part of it . But Michael did jump the club after a game . Mike was trying to be his own man . I told him , and Tommy ( told ) him : ' You don ' t jump the club. ' Mike realizes that now. &quot; Alvarez , who spent 10 years with the Dodgers , now manages the Lotte Giants in Pusan , Korea . &quot; I was told by Mr. Blaney that Mike Piazza was supposed to share the catching spot . His father had one discussion with me . He said , ' I want my kid to play more . My kid should be getting more playing time. ' Mr. Piazza was a gentleman , but I had a whole team to manage . I had to treat everyone equal . &quot; Mike considered himself a free_spirit . He had his own ideas . I had mine . Next thing I know , Mike walks_out , jumps the club , after a game . I called Tommy Lasorda . Tommy said , ' Joe , I ' m not taking any sides . It ' s your club . You did what you had to do . I would have done the same thing. ' &quot; Alvarez adds : &quot; Maybe I made a mistake , but I did what I was told to do -- treat Mike Piazza like anybody else , an equal . Sure , four years later , Mike is Rookie of the Year . Hindsight is 20-20 . Physically , Mike has all_the tools . Mentally , I believe Mike is his own worst enemy . Time will tell. &quot; After Vero Beach , Piazza went_to the Single-A Bakersfield Dodgers , where he led the Dodger minor-league system with 29 home_runs in 1991 . The next year , he was promoted to the Triple-A team in Albuquerque , where he hit a team-high . 341 in 94 games . Suddenly , last year , Piazza got his chance . Scioscia , the popular veteran catcher , left as a free_agent when the Dodgers refused to guarantee him the starting position . Piazza beat_out two other catchers for the spot in spring_training . SPRING TRAINING THIS YEAR IS QUITE DIFFERENT FOR MIKE PIAZZA , superstar . He has just signed a $ 4.2-million , three-year contract , the second largest in baseball history for a second-year player . The first day , Piazza enters the batting_cage trailed by reporters and curious Dodgers . Towering above the swarm is 6-foot , 6-inch Darryl Strawberry . During spring_training , Piazza will bat third in the lineup , Strawberry fourth . They ' re going to be the Dodger power combo , in theory , when the team ' s season opens April 5 against the Florida Marlins . The Dodgers have been struggling the last two years because of Strawberry ' s missing bat , shaky relief pitching and an error-plagued infield . Lasorda is optimistic this year as he watches Piazza and Strawberry warm_up . Piazza smacks line_drives . Then he hits two dribblers . Piazza talks to himself . Strawberry winces . Piazza blasts eight rifle_shots in a row . Strawberry ' s eyes crinkle . He turns_to the throng of reporters , faces upturned , pens poised . His tone is condescending : &quot; With Piazza batting third , and me fourth , we ' ll have a real power lineup this year. &quot; Reporters scribble . Noses twitch skeptically . Last year , Piazza carried the batting_order . Strawberry , suffering back problems , played only 32 games . Inside the clubhouse , Lasorda pulls on his skivvies and Dodger blue high-top socks . He announces : &quot; Mike Piazza is one of the great success stories in this country . Here ' s a guy that nobody wanted . That young_man had to go_through quite a lot . People told me that I was wasting my time. &quot; Lasorda clenches his fist . His voice becomes a growl . &quot; But I know my business ! He ' s no fluke . He ' s got_the_best batting mechanics around . I begged our people to draft him . Nobody wanted this guy. &quot; As for his business dealings with Piazza ' s father , Lasorda says coolly : &quot; Sure . He made money for me . So what ? I put_up money , but how much doesn ' t need to be public . Vince Piazza and I are close personal friends . If anybody should ( get credit ) , it should be Vince . We should be honoring him . He was the guy who directed Mike , motivated Mike , worked with him every day . He taught Mike dedication , determination and discipline . This kid ain ' t gonna have no sophomore jinx . There ' s no such thing as a sophomore jinx. &quot; Agreeing with Lasorda in spirit is &quot; Super &quot; Joe Charboneau , a 1980 rookie-sensation outfielder for the Cleveland Indians . A character , Charboneau dyed his hair red , white and blue , opened beer_bottles with his eye_socket and inspired a hit disco song , &quot; Go , Joe Charboneau. &quot; He batted . 289 , with 87 RBIs and 23 home_runs . He was out of the majors within two years . Charboneau now runs a baseball school in suburban Cleveland . &quot; I was having an excellent second year in spring_training , &quot; he recalls . &quot; Then I dove headfirst into second_base . I ruptured two discs in my back . I had injections and prescription muscle relaxers . I was medicated heavily . I knew when the season started I wasn ' t prepared . The Indians wanted me to keep playing . In those days they expected you to play . It ended my career. &quot; Charboneau ' s advice to Piazza : &quot; There is a Santa Claus , but there is no sophomore jinx . I don ' t believe_in it . Just don ' t overtrain . I was a pro boxer . A lot of guys leave their fight in the gym , the weight room. &quot; Hobbling Piazza this season has become the National League ' s cottage industry . &quot; Now they ' re gonna go_after him , looking_for holes , &quot; says Yogi Berra . &quot; Pitchers are gonna start working_on him. &quot; Pitcher Pete Harnisch of the Houston Astros is typical . &quot; Hey , Piazza doesn ' t have any big holes by any means . He uses a freakin ' redwood as a bat . He hurt us as a team . He can ruin your day . I don ' t know if ' sophomore jinx ' applies to Mike Piazza . But we have a plan , an idea , how to pitch to Piazza , but I ' m not going_to tell you. &quot; Observes Dodger Coach Cresse : &quot; There ' s no way to say for_sure how Piazza ' s going_to do this year . There ' s no sure thing . It ' s scary . Look_at ( Eric ) Karros , &quot; he says , referring to the Dodger first_baseman who was 1992 Rookie of the Year , when he batted . 257 with 20 home_runs and 88 RBIs . In his sophomore year , Karros ' batting_average fell to . 247 and , although he hit 23 homers , his RBIs fell to 80 . &quot; He tried to live_up_to media expectations and didn ' t have_the_best year . I hope Mike doesn ' t do like Karros . . . all this media exposure. &quot; Piazza realizes mental toughness may decide his fate . &quot; I ' ve got_to learn to keep it a game. &quot; Piazza is harder on himself than necessary . After a bad day , or a bad play , he might rant , rave , sling water_jugs , slam batting_helmets . He broke so many helmets on_the_road , when the team carries a limited supply , that the Dodgers became concerned . Once , Piazza made a bad throw to second and hit Dodger pitcher Tom Candiotti on the butt . Dodger pitchers wore paper bull ' s-eyes on the backs of their pants at the next game . Piazza wasn ' t amused . &quot; Mike was screaming and cursing , &quot; recalls Karros , who shares a Manhattan Beach apartment with Piazza . &quot; He takes it so personal , so serious. &quot; Another time , Piazza learned that his girlfriend was accidentally denied admittance by Dodger security . &quot; I broke bats , smashing things , breaking things against the wall , &quot; Piazza recalls sheepishly . &quot; I ran_through the underground tunnel screaming , swearing . I said some threatening things. &quot; VINCE PIAZZA SLOWS HIS MERCEDES and points to the crumbling remains of a shack in a stand of trees . &quot; that ' s where I grew_up , &quot; he mutters . The son of an impoverished welder , he quit school at age 16 to help provide . He was an Army corporal in Europe during the Korean_War . &quot; Then I worked nights at the B.F. Goodrich tire plant . . . fixed_up used cars during the day and sold them. &quot; By 1968 , he had amassed $ 35 # 000 . Datsun was offering dealerships if you had $ 1 # 000 in cash for parts . Soon Piazza added Honda to his growing Datsun dealerships . Then came the fuel crisis of the early 1970s . Gas-guzzling American cars caused many dealerships to fold . Piazza swooped in and gobbled_up choice bankrupt franchises and , more important , the real_estate . &quot; I knew American cars would come_back eventually. &quot; By 1992 , Piazza owned about 50 dealerships across the country . He expanded into real_estate and a computer service company , Phoenix Technologies , now with 66 offices nationwide . The computer_business generated $ 200 million in 1991 . &quot; Once I had a couple armies ( of money ) behind me , I began to indulge my love of baseball , &quot; Piazza says . He sold all but 20 of his dealerships , raised $ 25 million in cash , and for the last decade has tried to buy_into the Pittsburgh Pirates , San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants . Since rejection of his 1992 bid for part-ownership of the Giants , Piazza and a partner , Vincent Tirendi , have filed suit against Major_League Baseball , alleging violations of antitrust , civil_rights and contract laws . He also charges in the suit that he was libeled and slandered in remarks by major-league officials hinting that he has links to organized crime . Baseball officials have retracted those comments . Piazza is still furious . &quot; My lifelong ambition is to own a team , but I won ' t allow those slurs to go unchallenged . It was an injustice. &quot; The suit is pending in federal_court in Philadelphia . Vince Piazza hosts lunch at the Westover Country_Club . He owns the place . Snow blankets the golf_course . The parking_lot and modest dining_room are nearly empty . Seated with Vince are five friends and employees , and Mike . The luncheon is to discuss the Mike Piazza College Scholarship Fund for high_school baseball_players . Three months earlier , Vince spent $ 20 # 000 for a fund-raising gala . Twelve-hundred people attended . The event netted $ 25 # 000 . Vince wears a custom-tailored black wool suit and heavy gold Rolex watch with diamond-encrusted dial . He dominates the luncheon in_style and presence . Vince speaks , the table listens . Vince eats , the table eats . Vince laughs , the table laughs . Vince is ebullient , animated . &quot; We can do this every year with the theme that Mike wants to give_back something to the community. &quot; Heads nod . Good idea . &quot; It ' ll be a natural for the media , &quot; Vince concludes . &quot; we ' ll call a press_conference every year. &quot; Heads nod . Good idea . Someone suggests awarding scholarships from the interest created by the fund so that it will be self-perpetuating . Vince scowls and wags his finger . He doesn ' t want the money sitting in a bank . Everybody scowls . Bad idea . Vince decides to distribute the $ 25 # 000 immediately among four local high_schools . Better idea . Quietly , Mike chews turkey and stares at his plate . There is an uneasy silence . Vince asks softly : &quot; What do you think Mike ? &quot; Mike shrugs . He ' s concerned that if the coaches are allowed to control the money , they might play favorites , the media will find_out and he ' ll get bad press . Vince ' s eyes arch with alarm . &quot; Mike ' s right on this . How we gonna protect Mike ? &quot; The table buzzes with concern . Vince decides coaches can ' t be trusted with total control so they ' ll have to share responsibility with the high-school principals . Terrific idea . Mike shrugs . &quot; Sounds OK. &quot; Vince stands . The luncheon ends . After lunch , Piazza heads for his alma_mater , Phoenixville Area High_School , to pay his respects . Today is the first meeting of the 1994 baseball_team . His brother Tony is trying_out for the varsity . &quot; Nobody knows I ' m coming , &quot; Piazza says . &quot; Not even Tony. &quot; &quot; Why the secrecy ? &quot; I ask . Piazza sighs . &quot; You ' ll see. &quot; Autograph hysteria sweeps the high_school . For nearly 30 minutes , Piazza signs hats , gloves , T-shirts , scraps of paper , balls , cards . His pep talk begins with : &quot; Work your ass off . . . first one on the field , last one off . . . excuses are for losers . . . read every book on hitting and throwing. &quot; The coaches nod , smile . Piazza continues : &quot; Sure , go_out and drink beer . I did_it . I partied hard , but I knew when to go_home . Go_out , party , but always be in control . . . keep your dignity. &quot; The coaches ' smiles vanish . They stare at the floor . Piazza ends with : &quot; Remember to be your own person and be in control. &quot; The head coach , Doc Kennedy , holds_up two color photographs of Piazza mounted on wooden plaques that are for_sale at the school . &quot; Normally , we sell ( school ) T-shirts to raise money for the team , but if we can ' t push Mike this year , there ' s something wrong. &quot; Piazza grimaces at the commercialization of his fame . Coach Kennedy turns_to Piazza : &quot; Is it OK if the players tell people if they buy a plaque , you ' ll sign it ? &quot; Piazza tries to hide his irritation . His voice is strained . &quot; Well , I ' ll sign some of them. &quot; Coach Kennedy unscrews the plexiglass over Piazza ' s pictures and asks : &quot; Could ya sign your name up the right leg on this one and across the chest on that one ? &quot; Then Piazza autographs 30 blank cards , one for each student . &quot; Coach says these are worth money , &quot; a player whispers . Piazza signs a poster on the bulletin_board . After the meeting , two assistant coaches and students rush home for pictures , cards and magazine covers . Piazza signs autographs for another hour . As we drive_away , he mutters : &quot; Think what would have happened if they knew I was coming -- 9 million kids and parents with 9 million baseballs and bats to sign. &quot; Piazza shakes his head in disgust . &quot; I can make $ 10 # 000 an hour signing baseball_cards at shows . The promoters line the kids up and you can sign 800 to 1 # 000 cards an hour and I get $ 10 to $ 15 a card . I did one show and it made me sick . I felt_like a piece of meat with a pen . To sign an autograph strictly for money is a turnoff . It ' s not worth the hassle . I just don ' t like it . I don ' t want to do_it anymore . &quot; What ' s happened is the value of my signature is really high . But it ' s a turnoff to see little kids running_up to you with a handful of cards they want signed_in certain ways to make them more valuable , and two or three baseballs they want signed_on the ' sweet spot ' to make_it worth more. &quot; PIAZZA IS HITTING BALLS IN THE basement batting_cage in his parents ' home . He has programmed the pitching machine to throw sinkers at 88 m.p.h. &quot; Sinkers are designed to make you hit grounders. &quot; The balls come every 10 seconds from in front of a dull white , unlit wall . &quot; I designed the backdrop to make the ball as hard to see as possible . When I go_to spring_training , the balls look_like grapefruits. &quot; He blasts the next pitch high into the netting . &quot; That ought to drive a run in. &quot; He smashes a line_drive . &quot; Hit to right. &quot; He fractures the bat on the last pitch . It is his last night at_home before spring_training . He eats takeout pizza in the kitchen and regales his mother , Veronica , with stories of making a commercial for Topps baseball_cards . &quot; The director was really interested in my ideas , &quot; Piazza says . He is relaxed , boyish with his mother . She is petite , attractive , quick to smile , but of few words . Piazza giggles . &quot; It was so cool . The makeup people made a scratch on my face , jelly to look_like sweat , like after a game . It was sooo cool . The director said to look tough -- walk toward the camera looking tough . . . like this. &quot; He glowers fiercely and strides across the kitchen , his powerful chest thrust forward . His mother forces a weak smile . &quot; Just how big is your chest ? &quot; I ask . &quot; Forty-six inches , I think. &quot; He pauses . &quot; Mom , go get a tape measure. &quot; He flexes while his mother measures : chest , 46 inches ; biceps , 18 inches ; forearms , 15 inches ; waist , 33 inches ; thighs , 25 inches . Piazza frowns . &quot; My thighs could be bigger. &quot; It ' s almost 9 p.m. , time to leave for the gym . Tonight his muscle-building session is devoted to legs and thighs . &quot; I spend four nights concentrating_on a different part of my body , &quot; he explains . &quot; One night , chest , triceps ; then back , biceps ; then shoulders and , finally , legs , thighs . Then I take a night off. &quot; Piazza ' s father enters . He sees the gym bag in his son ' s hand . His face tightens . His voice is alarmed . &quot; The gym again ? Don ' t overdo the weights ! You ' re doing too_much ! It worries me . You ' ll lose your bat speed ! Please ! &quot; Piazza glares at his father and leaves . In the car , he sighs . His voice is muted . &quot; I love my father , but he pushes me too hard sometimes . I need the gym , the weights , for myself. &quot; In 1991 , Piazza says , he went &quot; ballistic for the first time &quot; on weight training . &quot; It was kind of addicting as I saw my power grow. &quot; His compulsion with bodybuilding also concerns Lasorda ; bigger muscles can slow flexibility , bat speed . &quot; I told him to lay off the weights ! &quot; Lasorda has growled . Piazza ' s gym , Body Transit Fitness Center , is in Collegeville , 30 minutes from the Piazza home . It is 9:30 . The gym is officially closed . Owner Marc Polignano stays to work with Piazza each night . &quot; I have nothing but respect for Mike , &quot; the owner says . &quot; He ' s where every professional athlete should be. &quot; Piazza hoists a barbell onto his shoulders and begins with 44 leg squats , slowly increasing the weight from 135 to 300 pounds . &quot; He could probably do 350 pounds , &quot; the owner whispers . &quot; That puts him in an elite group. &quot; Next , Piazza does 34 leg presses_on his back , pushing weights ranging from 350 to 625 pounds at a 45-degree angle . His face contorts . A deep , throaty , guttural growl bursts from his mouth with each pump . &quot; Come on ! Go , big man ! &quot; the owner whispers hoarsely . Piazza ' s face glows . His eyes shine . &quot; I was here New Year ' s Eve and Christmas_Eve , &quot; he rasps proudly . During the two-hour session , he pumps iron some 253 times on eight different machines to strengthen his hamstrings , knees , lower back . &quot; Some guys don ' t have to do this , &quot; he grunts . &quot; I think I do. &quot; He takes_a_breather . His chest heaves . &quot; I do this for myself . It makes me feel strong , powerful . . . tough. &quot; Then he goes_to work_on his calves . . . for the girls . VINCE , HIS WIFE , AND FOUR OF their five sons , Vince Jr. , 26 , Mike , Tony , 16 , Tommy , 12 , ( Danny , 23 , is away at college ) gather_in their spacious , cathedral-ceiling living room of white Italian marble floors and black marble fireplace . Their trilevel , 12 # 000-square-foot house sits on a bluff with a magnificent view of the Valley Forge National Historical Park . The Piazza estate includes stables , caretaker quarters and a farmhouse deemed a national_monument . George_Washington slept there during the infamous winter of 1777-78 . This lavishness is new_to the Piazzas . Despite their wealth , their lifestyle was unpretentious until they moved to Valley Forge Mountain seven years ago . Over brandy at the living-room bar , Vince tries in vain to articulate his fixation with baseball , conceding that it helps explain his obsessiveness with Mike ' s career . He glances at his two oldest sons . He makes small_talk until , out of boredom , they wander out of earshot . He leans close and whispers , &quot; I really don ' t want to hurt my oldest ' s feelings but , the truth is , when Vince Jr . and Mike were kids , I looked_at both of them and asked myself , ' Which one has_the_best chance of playing pro baseball ? ' Mike was younger , 11 , but bigger . I chose Mike . I pushed and pushed that kid . I was relentless . When other kids were going_to the beach , I dragged him to the ballpark . As he got better , I drove him harder. &quot; Vince ' s eyes mist . His voice cracks . &quot; I know he ' s getting tired_of me now. &quot; It is 10:30 p.m. Tommy , the youngest , enters the living room . Lasorda is Tommy ' s godfather . Like Mike , he is big for his age . He has returned from his first skiing trip . His voice crackles with excitement . Vince smiles and listens patiently . Finally , Tommy sags . &quot; I guess I ' m gonna go_to_bed , Dad. &quot; Vince brightens . His voice is upbeat . &quot; Tommy , how about hitting some balls first ? &quot; Tommy ' s eyes droop . &quot; I ' m kind of tired , Dad. &quot; Vince ' s face and voice grow sad . &quot; Aww , just hit a_few , Tommy. &quot; Tommy stares dully . &quot; Geez , I ' m really tired. &quot; Vince is gentle but insistent . &quot; Then we ' ll hit some balls tomorrow , OK son ? &quot; Tommy sighs . &quot; Yeah , I guess so . OK. &quot; Vince stares through me . His eyes glitter . &quot; Tommy can be like Mike . I can give him the tools. &quot;</TEXT>
