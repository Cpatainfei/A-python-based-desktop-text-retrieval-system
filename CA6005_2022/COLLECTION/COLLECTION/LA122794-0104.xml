WHAT NEW SPORTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE PLAYED , WHAT NEW RULES MIGHT BE IMPLEMENTED , WHAT NEW LEAGUES SHOULD BE FORMED...IN OTHER WORDS , WHAT CHANGES WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IN PREP SPORTS IN 1995 ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If only the world could be perfect , which is to say , if only I could make the rules . You want to know what I would do ? Fewer cliches . It ' s the sportswriter ' s nightmare . I ' m not allowed to write them and athletes ( and theircoaches , especially ) shouldn ' t be allowed to say to say them . Show me a kid who says , &quot; I swear on a reporter ' s grave , &quot; and I ' ll show you an immediate friend of the family . Show me a coach who says , &quot; We take each game like we eat our food -- one bite at a time , &quot; and I ' ll show you somebody whom I ' ll always respect . No more &quot; one game at a time &quot; quotes . Puhleeeze ! I know you can ' t play two games at a time ! Oh , and those Trabuco Hills football uniforms ? Trash them . I can ' t tell what the numbers are while I ' m trying to keep my precious statistics . Did 36 carry the ball , or was it 38 , 88 , 86 , 96 or 98 ? If I could change anything -- or everything -- about high_school sports in 1995 , the wonders I could work . I would change the acoustics inside the Century gymnasium so I could hear myself think , and install air conditioning in the Orange gym so the guy next to me would n ' t stink . I would have all_the parochial and private_schools in the same league so the public_schools would n ' t whine anymore . I would have a giant monitor in every gym and show replays of fans ' behavior , so they could see just how childish they sometimes act . And I would make every one of them officiate at least one game . And then I would make them write_about it . And then I would make them pick the all-county team . And then I would make them field the phone_calls from other angry parents upset over who made the all-county team . I would demand that every child attend the school closest to his place of residence because I get tired_of those Week 9 recruiting violation allegations against A. ) Los Alamitos football , B. ) Mater Dei boys ' basketball , C. ) Woodbridge girls ' basketball . . . . and so on . I would get the point across to football_players that they ' re not any more special than any other athlete on campus , and I would get the point across to baseball_players that there ' s enough arrogance at the professional level without you starting in high_school . I would outlaw hip-hop before , during and after basketball_games . I would make everyone who sings the national_anthem sing it straight to avoid those embarrassing moments when I feel sorry_for them . I would change the Southern Section baseball championship to a best-of-three format so one player or umpire can ' t decide a champion . I would make swimmers wear numbers on their caps so anyone can keep track of who ' s who . I would lower the price_of_admission -- it is , after all , just high_school . And I would get the point across to some coaches that it is , after all , just high_school . I would make_sure there was plenty of money to go_around -- to education and programs , not players . I would make baseball_coaches wear regular street_clothes because A. ) it might be funny and I live for my own amusement ; B. ) there are no such things as player-coaches in high_school ; C. ) what ' s next , John Barnes in shoulder_pads or Gary McKnight in a tank_top ? I would eliminate six-team leagues in favor of eight-team leagues because eight-team leagues have more credibility , especially in football . I would get_in the face of basketball referees and tell them not to assume every time a girl blocks the ball that it ' s a foul , that too many defensive players get whistled for blocking when they have clearly planted both feet , and that tall people shouldn ' t be whistled for a foul when other players invade their vertical space . I would give seeded teams the option of hosting a first-round playoff_game because that ' s usually the one game in which they don ' t need the home-field advantage -- or I would give them the outright home-field advantage throughout the playoffs . If you win , you should be rewarded . I would eliminate the northern-most 100 miles of the Southern Section -- San Luis Obispo isn ' t south of anything except an eventual bottle of wine . Of course , somebody else might have some_other ideas . In this installment of Prep Voices , The Times Orange County asks : &quot; What changes would you like to see in high_school sports in 1995 ? &quot; * I would have a zero-tolerance rule on trash talking in basketball . If people have respect for their sport , then they should have respect for their opponents . I would also eliminate all all-county , all-league teams and most valuable player-type awards -- all individual awards and statistics -- because sports is a team game , and if you ' re worried about your statistics , you can ' t be focused_on what you need to do_in other areas to accomplish the task . Jennie Gadd Troy senior * Roller hockey is pretty popular right now . There are a lot of kids involved , and that ' s a sport that needs to be looked_at pretty closely if we are to add new sports . But with all_the Orange County fiscal problems , it ' s going_to be pretty tough to get money out of anyone for something new . John Barnes , Los Alamitos athletic director * I think high_school boys ' basketball may be the only level that does not have some kind of shot clock . It should , maybe 35 seconds like the colleges do . If you ask me why , I can ' t give you a specific reason other_than it ' s odd the girls have it , college has it , the international game has it . . . . It would n ' t change the game that much ; the talent is more evenly spread_out now . Rich Prospero Santa Ana Valley basketball_coach * I ' d like to see them get the Catholic_schools in their own league . I watched that Los Alamitos-Mater Dei game and it just didn ' t seem fair . Los Al had all kids from their own neighborhood and Mater Dei had maybe three that lived_in their area . Most states have a public_school champion and a parochial_school champion . I ' m happy for Mater Dei . I think it ' s great for California that they ' re doing so well . I just think that everybody would like to have that same opportunity . Mitch Olson Kennedy football_coach * I would like to see high_school walk-on coaches ( mostly lower level ) aware of the high_school rules . A lot of these coaches come from college and only know the college or professional rules . The head coaches and athletic directors need to make_sure that all coaches are aware of all_the rules . Jack Brisacher Football and track official * I would like to see high_school volleyball_players be able to continue to play beach volleyball during the high_school season . Right now , practice starts in late August and there are still beach tournaments going_on , but we can ' t play in them because of the rules . Misty May Newport Harbor senior * I would like to see CIF take_a_look at revising divisions . The way it ' s set_up now definitely needs to be looked_at and maybe switched to an enrollment basis . Also , the way free-lance schools get_into the playoffs and what division they are placed in needs to be revised . I would also like to see more women in the teaching and coaching roles . Nancy Paul Orange Lutheran girls ' athletic director * I would like to see them ( sports ) all continued and not cut due_to the current budget problems . I feel that high_school athletics help teen-agers feel better about themselves . They , along with other extracurricular_activities , help keep kids out of trouble . Derek Haas Cypress * I would increase the amount of funds given to sports other_than football . It ' s important because the more different sports a school has -- such_as surfing , roller hockey , badminton -- the kids have more chances to broaden their horizons . A lot of girls ' programs get overlooked , too . Yool Kim Costa Mesa High , Class of ' 93 * I would let the Southern Section enforce its rules -- every time the section wants to enforce something , someone wants to enforce legal_action against them . There are coaches out there blatantly doing things wrong , and they ' re looking_at other coaches saying , ' Look_at me and what I ' m getting_away with , ' and it ' s a slap in the face of the coaches who run clean programs . The CIF has rules that protect athletes from burnout and from being with their club coaches incessantly , and they ' re great rules , but the CIF ' s overlooking them because someone always wants to take them to court . The Southern Section has its hands tied trying to enforce its rules . The other thing I would do is change the fly-by-night coach who comes_in , breaks the rules_in a hurry and leaves and doesn ' t suffer any of the repercussions . Cary Crouch Laguna Hills softball coach * I would like to see a stadium built somewhere on a neutral site that is run_by the schools so when there ' s a big_game , the schools get the money from the gate and the concessions . The way it is now , whenever there is a big_game , the schools end_up losing out on some money . I ' d like to see a stadium built that holds about 25 # 000 people , so no one gets turned_away , and see the schools get all_the money from parking and concessions . Ken Larson Yorba Linda * The one thing I ' d change is having more kids participate in sports just because they enjoy the sport . We used to have more of that . Now , there ' s too_much what ' s-in-it-for-me . I want to see kids playing the game because they enjoy being part of it . Mike Marrujo Valencia football_coach * I ' d like to see the club soccer season end at_the_same_time the first day of high_school soccer practice begins . As of now , club players are allowed to play with club teams_up until the high_school ' s first contest . The reason being is it puts high_school coaches in a tough position whenever they need a kid for practice and they ' re off playing in a club tournament . Also , you risk losing a player to injury before the season even begins . Tino Younger Cypress College assistant women ' s soccer coach * I believe that it is unfair that private_schools should compete with public_schools . Mater Dei has the No . 1 basketball_team in the county , by far , but how many of those players live near its campus in Santa Ana ? . . . Mater Dei can select its students and athletes from throughout Orange County , while public_schools have set boundaries . . . . Perhaps private_schools could have their own league , like the Angelus League , that had schools such_as Mater Dei , Servite / Rosary and Bishop Amat . Another thing that I want to comment about is the way county leagues are set_up . The leagues should consider being more geographically oriented in_order to be more cost efficient ( transportation ) and promote more rivalry and competition . How about a Santa Ana League , since the four Santa Ana high_schools have never been in the same league , this would seem sensible . Phil Bacerra Garden Grove * If there was one thing I would like to see changed in high_school athletics it would be better officials . The officials need to know what ' s going_on and let us play a little more . They call way too many fouls and they need to be more educated as far as officiating -- not all_of them , but some of them . Marie Philman Edison junior * I could probably list over a dozen things I would like to see change in high_school sports in ' 95 . The two big ones would be private_schools separated from public_schools because they have an unfair advantage . The other is that I would like to see more parent support . In the Garden Grove League , it ' s real bad . I wish for the kids ' sake that parents would be able to support them more . Tony Tubbs La Quinta girls ' basketball_coach * I ' d like to see Rollerblade hockey as a CIF-sanctioned sport in the next year or two , at worst . More people are playing roller hockey now than ever . James Butler Huntington Beach * I ' d appreciate it very much if the No . 1 team in Orange County , whether it be Mater Dei or Los Alamitos , would play one of the top-ranked teams in the nation in football to decide once and for all who ' s No . 1 . This year , Mater Dei should play the team from ( Miami , Fla. ) Southridge to decide who really is No . 1 . I think that can be arranged by extending the season one week . That would be good for the fans and would bring_in a lot of revenue for the parties involved . Marcel LaCroix Cypress * There are several things , starting with those things that are trickling down from the pros and college , and should not be part of high_school . Specifically , trash talking and taunting . We should get_back to why we have high_school sports . It ' s not a training ground for college ; a scholarship should be way down the list . The state of affairs is out of whack . The transferring of kids -- open enrollment -- should be tightened . Too many uninformed people are making bad decisions , going_by wins and losses and not what ' s good for the kids . Parents should have to pass a test to justify why they want the transfer . And it would be good if newspapers eliminated the stats . Sometimes players , parents and even coaches get caught_up in them too_much . I ' m not sure that ' s why we do_it . Terry Henigan Irvine football_coach * What I would like to see in the year to come , is for the State of California , Orange County and our school districts to show their full support to high_school athletics and their educational value by making them a financial priority . Bill White Capistrano Valley athletic director * College recruiting rules need to be changed . It would be a lot better if colleges could contact you before you contact them , and the number of visits weren ' t so limited . The rules are way too strict and need to be more lenient toward the recruit . Olujimi Mann Santa Ana Valley junior * I would like to see the winner of the Southern Section Division I basketball playoffs play the winner of the Southern Section Division II playoffs at the end of the year . It would allow the two best teams in Southern California to play each other . Mark Emard Fullerton * My big change would be to get the money to fund athletics without booster support . In some areas we rely 90 % on boosters , while schools pay_for the transportation and officials . But things such_as uniforms , equipment and the extras you need to run a top program , to ask boosters to raise $ 5 # 000- $ 15 # 000 is not right . We got a good_deal at Estancia from Reebok for a discount on shoes , and that is realistic . I don ' t mind doing some advertising ; ideally you want no strings but in this day and age anyway to get_it done without the parents is better . To ask parents to raise funds puts coaches in an awkward situation , and you ' re more beholden to them . But I ' d feel the same way as the parents . If I give money , it ' s hard for there to be no strings . I don ' t know where the money is coming from , especially now in Orange County , but there needs to be some change . Tim Parsel Estancia boys ' basketball_coach * I ' d like to use football_stadiums for soccer games more , so we can get this thing going . I ' d also like to see more places to go_for kids , such_as community_centers . Eddie Carrillo Orange soccer coach * We haven ' t had a winner here since 1984 . I don ' t know how it could be done , but I think occasionally , more exposure should be given to the hard-working coach who teaches good fundamentals and more_than the game . There ' s a lot more to life than winning . The general public needs to know that . These kids play hard , they ' re just not as talented . Vern Nelson Bolsa Grande baseball_coach * The biggest change needed is the way schools are put into CIF divisions . It should not be 1-A , 1-AA , etc . The way they do_by pure numbers ( school population ) is wrong . that ' s why you see a Santiago and a Century play in the highest divisions -- with Mater Dei and Los Alamitos -- and it ' s not fair . Then someone like Corona del Mar with 700 students plays in the lowest . But if you compare the number of athletes they have to the ones at Santiago , Corona del Mar has more . Mike Murphy Sonora boys ' basketball_coach * I would like to see the kids clean_up their act_on the court . There are too many kids watching NBA and listening to trash talk . I ' d like to see the game become a game of skill , and less a game of talk and celebration . I was very disappointed at the Tournament of Champions with some of the things I saw on the court . You don ' t want to take_away from the game , but then again , what kind of game do we want ? I ' m all for any kind of way to bring_about a cleaner game . Bob Becker Pacifica boys ' basketball_coach * I would like to see more kids get involved in athletics in_general . It ' s a shame more don ' t get involved ; they ' re really missing out on a great experience . It ' s a great way to make friends and it teaches you good work ethics . They ' ll learn from it and get a fun experience out of it , too . Dave Smith Loara track / cross-country coach * I would change the backcourt rule_in basketball , and there would be a lot less grabbing by defenses . Nicole Wiora Saddleback senior * The divisional playoffs got better this year , but football is one of the few sports that doesn ' t deal with enrollment . If there is some system that they can incorporate similar to volleyball and basketball , where a 3 # 000 enrollment school is playing a 3 # 000 enrollment school , that would help . Then , year in and year out , you play people on the same level , drawing the same type of kid you are . Jeff Brinkley Newport Harbor football_coach * I wish someone would cover soccer a little more . I know it ' s not one of the biggest sports , but I think soccer is one of the sports that is trying to catch_on and I think a little more publicity would be good to help it . Mike Shumaker Fullerton senior * I would like to see more financial_support from the district or wherever it needs to come from . One of the things I would like to see done with the financial_support is the creation of a freshman level for girls ' basketball . Carolyn Waltman Dana Hills girls ' basketball_coach * I would like to see athletes improve on their sportsmanship . In the Empire League we have a sportsmanship conference on an annual basis and it seems to help in all sports . But while attending or coaching at other games , I still see bad sportsmanship by numerous athletes . John Selbe Cypress athletic director , football and girls ' basketball_coach * I would n ' t mind getting a division more county-oriented . Sometimes when we get_in our division ( playoffs ) , the two teams are so spread_out ( distance-wise ) . It hurts the crowd and it just doesn ' t mean much . I would enjoy an Orange County section . It would make each game that much more meaningful . ( Also , ) maybe the teams at the bottom of our league belong in an easier ( league ) . That would be the equitable thing to do . There ' s so_much disparity in our league now . It ' s top or bottom and there ' s no in-between . I don ' t see how we can change that , unless we break_up the Garden Grove League . Roger Takahashi Los Amigos football_coach * One of the items that I would like to see changed in the year to come is more funding for high_school athletics . High_school athletics desperately need more funding , especially on the girls ' side . I also feel that the girls should be funded equally so they have the same number of teams in each sport .
