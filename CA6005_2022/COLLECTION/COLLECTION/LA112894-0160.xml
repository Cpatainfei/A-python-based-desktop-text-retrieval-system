   <HEADLINE> AUDITS CAST SHADOW ON CHARTER SCHOOL ' S FUTURE ; EDUCATION : SPENDING CRITICIZED AT L.A. CAMPUS THAT ENROLLS DROPOUTS . BACKERS SAY PROBLEMS CAN BE FIXED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While teachers lacked textbooks and supplies , the principal of Los Angeles ' only charter school for dropouts drove an expensive school-leased sports_car and staff_members spent $ 7 # 000 on a secret retreat to Carmel , according to two outside audits . Critics on the Los Angeles Unified School District board , which is to review the audits of Edutrain Charter School today , say documents provide ample evidence that it ' s time to abort the experiment , which started in July , 1993 . If Edutrain closes its Grand Avenue doors , it will be the first charter school in the nation to fail since Minnesota enacted legislation to free some of its public_schools from the bonds of their parent districts in 1991 . Supporters say the management and financial audits merely detail severe growing pains , some of which they blame on vague and confusing state legislation . In hopes of persuading the Los Angeles Unified board to continue funding the school , Edutrain officials recently proposed an extensive reorganization that includes replacing both its top administrators . &quot; We made some mistakes . The school made some errors in its first year of operation , &quot; Winston Doby , president of the Edutrain Board of Governors , told school_board members earlier this month . &quot; What we are asking you is to put the kinds of actions that occurred last year in perspective. &quot; Edutrain ' s charter called_for luring dropouts back to school and keeping them there by offering part-time classes and individualized instruction . At first it seemed wildly successful : Enrollment spiked to 500 students last spring and 68 former dropouts graduated in a gala June ceremony . Then Edutrain faltered , struggling awkwardly to keep pace with the rapid_growth amid mounting internal turmoil and outside scrutiny . This fall , only 100 students showed_up for classes , and in October two_dozen teachers and staff_members were laid_off . Now a financial audit by KPMG Peat Marwick Co . has found the school is nearly $ 1 million in debt and owes at least $ 240 # 000 more to Los Angeles Unified for students it anticipated in the fall but who never enrolled . So far , no one is alleging intentional wrongdoing at Edutrain . But questions abound about how the school spent its money and whether it has the administrative and financial fortitude to resurrect itself . The financial audit indicates that the school ' s future depends_on persuading Los Angeles Unified to accept its reorganization plan and on more_than doubling its student enrollment within the next two months . In past meetings , the school_board has been divided , lauding Edutrain ' s efforts to salvage dropouts but expressing concern with the apparent lack of oversight and general disorganization . &quot; I don ' t think there was any malice , but I can ' t say we should continue to spend public funds on a school that has had this many problems in such a short time , &quot; Los Angeles Unified board_member Leticia Quezada said during a Nov . 14 special meeting . &quot; In the charter school movement . . . it ' s going_to be very critical that the community schools are above reproach. &quot; Edutrain is one of the state ' s first 100 charter schools , allowed under 1992 legislation to operate independently with the permission of local school_boards . Los Angeles Unified is responsible_for granting charter contracts within its boundaries and ensuring that the schools live_up_to their own expectations . Los Angeles Unified board_members plan to review information from the two Edutrain audits today , then decide next Monday whether to let the school survive . Their ultimate decision is complicated by Edutrain ' s debt -- much of which is owed to UCLA for start-up costs -- because state charter school legislation does not clearly delineate who would have to repay that money if the school closed . &quot; that ' s a factor that should be taken_into_account in granting them additional time , because it ' s a way to get them to pay_off that debt , &quot; said Rich Mason , general counsel for Los Angeles Unified . Among the spending decisions questioned in district excerpts of the management audit by K . H . Consulting Group -- which have not been publicly released -- are perks Edutrain provided to administrators that far exceed benefits offered other public_school administrators . Among them are the lease of a $ 39 # 000 sports_car for school President Keith Turnage , payment of $ 500 a month toward the rental of his Mt . Washington home and the hiring of a bodyguard to protect him . The management audit also questioned the wisdom of a $ 7 # 000 Carmel retreat for a select group of 13 staff_members and the $ 22 # 000 cost of last year ' s graduation ceremony -- held at the Los Angeles Convention Center -- which amounted to about $ 325 per graduate . Edutrain board_members have defended the price of staging an elaborate graduation and said they have been unable to confirm that the Carmel retreat took_place . But they have acknowledged that they erred in agreeing to furnish Turnage a fancy car and offset some of his rent to compensate him for housing students and holding school events in his home . They said they reversed those decisions in August . Several respected educators and business people sit on Edutrain ' s board , including Doby , who is vice_chancellor of student affairs at UCLA ; Darick Simpson , project director for the L.A. Minority Business Development Center ; restaurateur Jean-Claude Sakoun , and Virgil Roberts , a record company executive and board_member for the LEARN school reform_movement . Some Los Angeles Unified board_members have said they consider many of the expenditures excessive , particularly when Edutrain teachers told the auditors that they had to make_do without sufficient textbooks and other essential supplies . &quot; We used our own books in our classrooms , ones we brought from home , &quot; said one former teacher who asked not to be identified . Several current and former teachers told The Times that the school frequently ran_out of toilet_paper and the telephones were disconnected once because the bill had not been paid . The management audit also asked why Edutrain had spent nearly $ 30 # 000 on furnishings . At the Nov . 14 board_meeting , Doby said that the money had purchased desks and chairs for the school . Some teachers , however , said they and their students were left with used chairs and ripped curtains while administrators worked in top-floor offices filled with new desks , wall-to-wall carpeting and vertical blinds . District board_member Jeff Horton described the spending on administrators as &quot; just self-serving ' I wanna act and be rich. ' &quot; Also troubling to the district board are allegations in the management audit that underage students were housed in four school-funded apartments and in Turnage ' s own home , and that in some cases girls and boys were allowed to live together without supervision . At the Nov . 14 meeting , board President Mark Slavkin said Edutrain should have asked permission from Los Angeles Unified to &quot; deviate from the charter . . . and provide overnight housing. &quot; The school responded that the housing was reserved mostly for students over the age of 18 and then only in extreme situations , such_as when they became homeless , were being abused at_home or when their parents traveled out of their parole area . About 15 % of Edutrain ' s students are_on parole and at least 85 % have arrest records . However , some students interviewed by the auditors charged that the school housing and accompanying clothing allowances were doled_out based on a system of favoritism , not need , and that the apartments were widely known as party pads . Allegations of favoritism extended_to hiring decisions as well , according to the management audit , which described Edutrain as &quot; nepotism heaven. &quot; Nearly a fifth of the employees were related , the auditors found , and staff_members reported that job descriptions were sometimes crafted to match the skills of desired hires . A core_group of teachers , many of whom helped found the school , were paid $ 70 # 000 annual salaries -- more_than twice what other Edutrain teachers received . One top administrator allegedly received nearly half his salary as expense reimbursement in an apparent attempt , the audit said , to prevent the money from being tapped for child_support payments . Yet the relative autonomy of charter schools meant that Los Angeles Unified only learned of the troubles at Edutrain after a random visit last May by a state financial analyst who was curious about how the school had designed its program . Chuck Pillsbury , an analyst with the state_Department of Finance , found far fewer students in classes and roll books than the number for which Edutrain was being funded . Pillsbury brought his discovery to the attention of Los Angeles Unified administrators , whose initial investigation turned_up conflicting answers and sloppy roll-book keeping . The auditor with K . H . Consulting Group reported a similar experience when seeking financial records , saying they were incomplete and in disarray . A former teacher , who requested anonymity , charged that Edutrain administrators became &quot; power hungry &quot; but that no one outside the school knew because Edutrain lacked oversight : The school ' s own board met once a month or less and Edutrain is the only Los Angeles Unified charter school where teachers agreed not to be represented by a union . That lack of outside eyes left crucial decisions in the hands of a_few top administrators , the teacher said , none of whom had ever managed their own schools . Doby , the Edutrain board president , conceded that key administrators were not qualified to manage a school as large as Edutrain . But he has consistently maintained that it was an overzealous entrepreneurial spirit seeking to meet an unexpected demand , not a thirst for power , that dragged the school down . &quot; I think it reveals some of the weaknesses of the charter school movement , &quot; said Los Angeles Unified board_member Horton . &quot; Namely , that some kind of entrepreneurial spirit is sufficient to meet the needs of students . This , to me , is a proof that it isn ' t necessarily. &quot;</TEXT>
