   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE ; BUYING INTO THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Buying a computer ? Heh-heh , you ' re going to get bilked , of course . You ' ll pay too_much for technology that will be obsolete before you even master it . You know that , right ? Old fears die_hard . These days , in fact , it ' s almost impossible to get taken_to the cleaners when buying a personal_computer . The price_wars that bloodied the industry over the last 18 months have made_it hard to avoid a bargain . Even cheap PCs now put more power and capability at your fingertips than most people will ever use . Furthermore , obsolescence is in the eye of the beholder . Yes , computer_technology advances in gigantic bounds , which will pound the resale value of anything you buy today . But this has always been true of computers , and as long as your machine is doing the work you need it to do , who cares about keeping_up with technology fashions ? Finally , technical expertise matters far less than you might believe . Like camera or stereo nerds , you can certainly bone_up on the benefits of Enhanced IDE burst transfer rates or the subtle differences between caching controller chips , but it won ' t make a jot of difference in how much work you move off your desk or the enjoyment you get from your PC . The key to getting your money ' s worth is homing_in on who will use the gear and how . Be as specific as possible . Homework is a generic use . Writing term papers , drawing diagrams and calculating differential_equations are specific . Moonlighting is general . Creating spreadsheet budgets , maintaining customer databases and drafting project proposals are specific . Figuring_out what you hope to accomplish will help immensely in your quest_for the perfect system . Which Computing Camp ? Many of the rules for buying computers have changed in the last year , mostly for the better . The choice between Macintosh and Windows PCs , for example , is no longer a matter of theology , and the technical advantages of one camp over the other have all but evaporated . While Apple Computer remains the only maker of Macs , no longer must you pay boutique prices for one . Humbled by a shrinking customer base , Apple joined the price_wars last year . Dollar for dollar , Macintoshes now line_up squarely against Windows machines . The Mac ' s seductive charm has won a devoted following , but bear_in_mind that there are 12 IBM-compatible PCs in the world for every Macintosh . If others frequently need to read files that you create , Windows ensures wider compatibility . Exception : desktop_publishing , which the Mac still dominates , though this is changing . Also , technophobes and those coming_to the computer for the first time will generally be happier with the Macintosh . Meanwhile , a new generation of computers based on the PowerPC processor will ( sort of ) run both Windows and Macintosh operating systems . Apple is first out of the gate with the new systems ( IBM will soon follow ) , basing them on its Quadra PCs . But they run Windows in &quot; emulation mode , &quot; which means slowly . Otherwise , choose between Windows and Macintosh computers according to the software you already know how to use as well as the programs you plan to buy . This may seem obvious , but it ' s surprising how often software doesn ' t enter the picture until the hardware is already bought . that ' s really putting the cart before the horse . Once you ' ve chosen your computing camp , then ask yourself : Should your gadget travel ? Can a portable PC suffice as your sole machine ? The convenience of a notebook system is obvious ; the drawbacks aren ' t . For example , fingers must adjust to cramped notebook keyboards . Also , spend two hours working from a small and shadowy notebook screen , and you ' ll develop hallucinations and unusual tics . Some notebooks allow you to hook external monitors and keyboards to them when working_at home , or even full-blown docking stations . Such systems do cost more , though . Under the Hood Regardless of whether your system travels , each program it runs places different demands on your system , which you ' ll want to take into consideration when choosing its configuration . Here generalizations help . Roughly speaking , there are five system subcomponents to consider : processor ( CPU ) , memory ( RAM ) , hard_drive , video and peripherals . Because all data traffics through the main processor , a slow CPU translates into slow system performance ( although the reverse is not necessarily true ) . Graphics , drawing and design programs -- including desktop_publishing -- make heavy demands of all system components . If you plan to use any of these types of programs , get the fastest processor you can afford . For the Mac , this means the 32MHz 68040 ; otherwise , bargains abound_in slower 68030s . For Windows machines , you ' ll want some flavor of the 486 chip , preferably a 33MHz , 50MHz or 66MHz version . Dx means more power than Sx . And don ' t give a second_thought to the chip ' s manufacturer ; &quot; Intel Inside &quot; and other advertising slogans are so_much marketing gas . Don ' t worry about the new , super powerful Pentium chip ; programs that take_advantage of its advanced features are at least two years away . And computers that allow you to &quot; upgrade &quot; to Pentium neglect to mention that the upgrade cards typically cost as much as a new computer . Memory and hard_drive configurations are easier to calculate : The more , the better . Any computer you buy today should come_with at least four megabytes of random_access_memory , or RAM . Any less , and your dealer is hiding costs that will magically resurface at the cash_register . For desktop_publishing or high-end design and graphics work , you ' ll want at least 8MB , possibly more . Ditto large databases and spreadsheets , or if you frequently run more_than two or three programs concurrently . Almost no one needs more_than 16MB , and those power hogs know who they are . Hard drives , like old garages , run_out of space depressingly fast . Even simple documents and spreadsheets come adorned with fonts and charts and other fins and flora that insinuate themselves into larger spaces . Today ' s computer_games and screen_savers shamelessly grab 10 megabytes at a time . The porkiest files contain full-motion video or animation and sound , which is why multimedia programs are stored on compact_disc , not on a hard_disk . But even stuffy business applications now include video sequences and sound clips . A current glut of hard_drives has hammered prices down to about $ 1 per megabyte . Take_advantage of it . Today ' s floor for drive capacity is 120MB . Work upward from there . For heavy desktop_publishing , large databases and drawing and design programs , look_for at least 200MB . If you plan to produce videos or animation from your PC , or if you use photo touch-up programs , you ' ll want at least 500MB . Performance counts too , especially with databases and design programs . Some Windows PCs run their hard_drives on &quot; local bus , &quot; which pumps data along a more direct route to the CPU . It helps drive performance somewhat , but don ' t pay extra for it . Local bus was originally designed to goose video performance , which has become the most serious system bottleneck , thanks to graphical interfaces ( both Macintosh and Windows ) . Almost all Windows PCs sold today come_with a video accelerator running_on local bus . Don ' t trouble yourself about which accelerator or which local bus architecture -- or even about what these things mean . Just make_sure your Windows computer includes this feature ; it ensures that your screen can keep_up with the rest of your computer . You ' ll also need to decide how many colors your video system supports at which resolutions . For example , most plain-Jane Windows PCs support 256 colors at 640 by 480 resolution ( the number of dots of light displayed horizontally and vertically ) . For desktop_publishing , you ' ll want a display that supports 256 colors at 1 # 024 by 768 resolution . Ditto for games and multimedia applications . And look_for a monitor with a . 28 dot pitch and 70Hz refresh rate . Don ' t worry about why . High-end graphics work and full-motion video require special video cards that can display up_to 1.6 million colors . For such work , you ' ll want a monitor that ' s larger than the standard 14- or 15-inch variety as well . Video on the Macintosh is simpler . Low-end displays provide 16 simultaneous colors , adequate for spreadsheets and word_processing , perhaps , but games will look anemic , and you ' ll definitely want more pizazz when working with graphics or multimedia applications . Choices are limited , however . Let your budget dictate which video option you choose , keeping_in mind that , as with Windows PCs , you can buy special cards for full-motion video and animation . Even if you never plan to watch movies on your computer , multimedia has become a preponderant fact of computing -- which is why CD-ROM_drives are suddenly the best-selling PC peripheral today . Don ' t buy a computer without one . Two years hence they ' ll be required even to load software onto your system . Problem is , they ' re s-l-o-w . Double-speed CD-ROM_drives read text and program code at twice the speed of conventional drives , which boosts overall performance . They ' re basically the standard . Triple- and quadruple-speed drives are also available , though practically speaking , they ' re only moderately faster than double-speed drives . And they typically cost far more . If you can find a bargain on one , nab it . Otherwise , stick_to double-speed . Computer as Communicator ? Don ' t leave the store without a modem , your entree to the information superhighway , even if the cliche does make you carsick . The faster the speed , the happier you ' ll be . Faster modems can save you money on your phone_bills or connect charges , depending_on what you do on-line , and even if you use a flat-rate service , slower transmission speeds can be maddening . These days , 14 # 400 bps modems ( never mind what that stands_for ) are so cheap you ' ve got_to have one . TECH TIPS : What to Look_for While Shopping What do you hope to do with your new computer ? Answering that question will make finding the right machine easier . * Home use : For letters , homework , managing your finances , playing games , using services such_as Prodigy , get a 486SX ( 25 MHz or 33MHz ) PC or a 68030 Mac . Either way , get 4 megabytes of RAM and a 120-megabyte hard_drive . * Small business : For word_processing , spreadsheets and databases , get a 486SX or DX ( 50 MHz ) PC or a 68040 Mac , either way with 8MB RAM and a 200MB hard_drive . * Desktop_publishing , graphics and multimedia production : 486Dx ( 100 MHz ) or a 68040 Mac . In either case , get 16MB of RAM and a 500MB hard_drive .</TEXT>
