   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : ROUND OF 16 ; SPOTLIGHT ; SO , WHY AN EPIC ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I never imagined that my heart would start beating in anguish in a football match between the United States and Brazil.A team that has not surpassed infancy in this sport takes the Brazilian team to make an epic out of a victory that should have been routine . I liked the enthusiasm of the second_half . Without exception , all_of the Brazilian players were heroic , trying to compensate for the unwise foul of Leonardo. &quot;</TEXT>
