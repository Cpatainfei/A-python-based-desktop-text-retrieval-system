   <HEADLINE> AT-RISK STUDENTS COMPLETE COURSE OF ACTION ; THEY OVERCOME OBSTACLES TO EARN THEIR DIPLOMAS FROM MOORPARK COMMUNITY HIGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jose Zamora realized a_few months ago that he had one more chance to finish high_school and that he had better not blow it if he wanted to make something of himself . &quot; I was at_work , holding a shovel and a pickax in my hands , &quot; the 18-year-old said . &quot; I just started thinking , ' This is no kind of life . I have to finish school. ' &quot; Zamora is one of 16 graduates from Moorpark Community High_School ' s class of 1994 . The school is a last_resort for students at risk of dropping_out or for those who have been kicked_out of regular high_school . Along with the normal day-to-day travails of teen-agers , many of these students have faced almost overwhelming obstacles to earning their high_school diplomas , ranging from pregnancy to working full-time jobs to being kicked_out of their homes . Zamora , a cherub-faced young_man with an imposing 6-foot , 2-inch , 280-pound frame , was sent to the school midway through his sophomore year at Moorpark High_School . Zamora ' s father had walked_out on his wife and nine children , he said , forcing the family to go_on welfare until Zamora and his brothers could find work . He stopped going_to school and started working as a day_laborer , hefting bricks with his brother or doing other work_at construction sites for $ 50 a day . &quot; I wasn ' t interested in school then . I didn ' t like it , &quot; he said . &quot; But Community High_School was the first place that I read a book from cover to cover . It ' s where I realized that I didn ' t want to be hanging_out on the corner with the other paisanos waiting for work all my life. &quot; Now , high_school diploma in_hand , Zamora plans on going_to a culinary academy to become a chef . Zamora was one of 80 students at Moorpark Community High this year . School administrators estimate that about 15 % of the students end_up quitting . But those who stay and tough out their problems overcome sometimes tremendous odds and earn a real high_school education , avoiding the alternatives of getting a General Education Diploma -- or dropping_out altogether . &quot; A good number of students stumble and fall when they enter high_school or junior_high , &quot; said Gabino Aguirre , Community High principal . &quot; Whether they can get_back up is the question . These kids are challenged ; maybe they find themselves pregnant or they got someone pregnant or whatever , but , for the most part , when they come here they decide to work . They make the most of the opportunity. &quot; When 18-year-old Leidy Morales moved from Los Angeles to Moorpark with her mother , she had to make_up a months-long absence from the classroom . She said her mother tried to force her to quit school so that she could help_out at_home . The friction between the two finally forced Morales to move_in with her boyfriend . &quot; Completing high_school has always been very important to me , &quot; Morales said recently . &quot; My mom and I haven ' t talked for a while so I mailed her an invitation to the graduation. &quot; At the graduation ceremony last week , Morales came_to the podium twice to accept scholarships she received for academic excellence . As she accepted her diploma , she looked_into the crowd and was suddenly overcome by emotion : There , sitting among family members of other students , was her mother . &quot; That was the most beautiful day of my life , &quot; Morales said . &quot; It ' s something I ' ve been waiting for , and seeing her there touched my heart. &quot; Making_it through high_school and moving_on in life is the goal of most students at Community High_School , Aguirre said . He sits_down one-on-one with each new student to review the requirements for earning a diploma . Teachers closely monitor all assignments , math problems and homework . As each task is finished , the student is awarded credits toward graduation . The school allows_for scheduling flexibility and independent study to accommodate students ' work schedules or the time they need to care_for children . The flexibility has helped students like Anita Ventura , 17 , take_care of their babies . Anita , who won ' t have enough credits to graduate until the fall , said that when she became pregnant with her daughter Margerita two years ago , teachers and administrators at the regular high_school wrote her off . &quot; It ' s different here , &quot; she said . &quot; If you need to talk to somebody , Gabino ' s there all_the time , and teachers work one-on-one with you. &quot; Anita , who spoke briefly at the graduation , said she wanted to finish because she was anxious to go_to college and become a nurse . &quot; One of the first things students ask when they come here is , ' How long will it take_to finish ? ' We have a lot of self-motivated students , &quot; Aguirre said . He said students are often focused_on everyday struggles and have given little thought to life after high_school . He said he tries to make all students aware that , if they try , they can go_on to college . However , only six of this year ' s 16 graduates plan on attending college in the fall . &quot; Clearly , some kids are saying ' No , thank_you , ' &quot; Aguirre said . &quot; I just want them to understand that the opportunity is there if they want it. &quot; Many graduates will face unemployment or have to settle for jobs at local fast-food restaurants , he said . &quot; Of course , that concerns me . The reason a lot of these kids won ' t get jobs is that the economy is depressed , &quot; he said . &quot; We do our best to help them tap into the resources out there that they can use to find jobs. &quot; Graduate Shane Pinney , 18 , is looking_for a summer job so that he can save enough money to go_to Hawaii and work in his grandfather ' s pizza_parlor . &quot; I figure I ' ll go there and decide what I ' m going_to do , &quot; Pinney said . &quot; I ' d like to become a writer or a musician . I ' m not sure about college , but anything is possible. &quot; In two weeks , Pinney ' s fellow graduate , James Anthony Roberts , 19 , will be at boot camp , beginning a four-year stint with the Marine Corps . Roberts , who was kicked_out of regular high_school for fighting was then kicked_out of his home after disagreements with his parents . Although his life was mired in problems when he enrolled , Roberts said Community High_School forced him to think_about his future . &quot; For a while there , I was working 50 or 60 hours a week at Carl ' s Jr . to pay the rent , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s all I could think_about . It took having someone from the school coming_down to talk to my manager before I realized what I was doing. &quot; He said he cut_back on hours and started focusing_on school . &quot; None of us had storybook lives , &quot; he said &quot; But we all came_to the point where we said we want ( a high_school diploma ) , and that ' s all that matters. &quot;</TEXT>
