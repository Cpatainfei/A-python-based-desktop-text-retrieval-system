   <HEADLINE> TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART : DISH IS SELLING LIKE 18-INCH HOT_CAKES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First , there was the compact_disc . Now comes the compact dish . Finally , the affordable 18-inch satellite dish so many have been waiting for is here . RCA is producing the dishes and accessory equipment -- a digital receiver box and a remote_control -- with DirecTV of El Segundo , a division of GM Hughes Electronics , supplying the signal . GM Hughes , with a total investment of $ 1 billion , has put two new communication satellites 22 # 300 miles above the earth , each with a signal strong enough to reach a smaller dish . The 18-inch dish system , which went_on the market in Los Angeles about three weeks ago , provides 150 channels . A system retails for $ 699 . The initial L.A. shipment of systems -- about 10 # 000 to 250 retail outlets -- sold_out in two weeks , prompting retailers to begin restocking . Eddy Hartenstein , the president of DirecTV , said expectations are to have this system in 10 million homes nationwide by the year 2000 . The compact dish could have a bigger impact on sports viewing than anything since the VCR . Because of the channel_capacity , sports fans will be able to get every sports network imaginable , including seven regional sports networks outside California , depending_on how much they want to spend . * The arrival of the compact dish is_well timed , since the NFL this season launched its Sunday Ticket package for satellite dish owners . DirecTV has made an agreement with the NFL that will allow it to offer the final five weeks of the season , beginning Nov . 27 , to customers for $ 49.95. The NFL Sunday Ticket and the ESPN / ABC college football pay-per-view packages have been big hits with those who can get them . But to get the NFL Sunday Ticket , it takes an expensive and cumbersome satellite dish . And most cable companies don ' t have the channel_capacity to offer all_the college pay-per-view games that are available . The 18-inch dish solves those problems . If a consumer is interested , should he or she wait for the price to come_down ? &quot; It ' s already reasonably priced , and if there is a reduction it won ' t be until at least the middle of next year , &quot; Hartenstein said . * The Sunday Ticket package , which offers_up to 12 NFL games each Sunday , seems to be popular_with most sports-bar owners , who generally pay between $ 399 and $ 2 # 700 for it , depending_on seating_capacity . But some have avoided paying the fees and are showing games illegally , arousing the wrath of the NFL . Last week , the league filed lawsuits against 20 Southland sports bars that were showing games without authorization . The NFL also announced two hot_line numbers , ( 800 ) 553-4NFL or ( 800 ) 313-4NFL , for reporting unauthorized showings . The NFL figures sports-bar owners who have paid will report competitors who have not . * The bad part about the NFL Sunday Ticket package is that the sports bars are not allowed to show blacked-out Raider and Ram games , something they did before this business became legitimate -- and controlled . John Morris , co-owner of the Legends chain in Long_Beach , Santa Monica , Costa Mesa , Redondo Beach and a new one in West Covina , believes he has a solution . &quot; If we could get Al Davis and Georgia Frontiere to lift the blackouts , I ' d be willing to charge $ 5 a person at the door and turn all_the money over to them , &quot; he said . &quot; That adds_up to about $ 5 # 000 a Sunday from just our places . &quot; Figure in all_the sports bars in Southern California , and I believe the Rams or Raiders could pull_in around $ 300 # 000 every Sunday one of them have a blacked-out game. &quot; * Although the NFL Sunday Ticket package has been a plus for sports bars , the baseball strike and the hockey lockout have been killers . Morris figures his business is off 25 % at the four Legends bars that existed a year ago . He says he will make about $ 250 # 000 less this October than he did last October , simply because there are no baseball playoffs or World_Series . &quot; I ' m just figuring the lack of baseball , but the lack of hockey hurts us too , &quot; Morris said . &quot; The really bad part is all_the little people that get hurt -- the bartenders and waitresses , food and goods distributors , people like that. &quot; Joe Cirivello , who with his brothers , Dominic and Angelo , owns a sports bar in Long_Beach , protested the work_stoppages Tuesday night with a Halloween lynching of baseball and hockey on the street in front of the bar . The hangings were complete with gallows , a hangman , a hearse , a drum_roll and a trumpeter playing taps . * New concept : Are you ready for this ? Sports might be finding a new outlet -- home shopping networks . Merchandise Entertainment Television ( MET ) , a new 24-hour home-shopping network in Solana Beach , Calif. , will televise six of the California Cup races -- the third through the eighth -- Saturday from the Oak_Tree meeting at Santa Anita . In between the races , they will hawk merchandise . MET this month also announced a three-year agreement with the Continental Basketball Assn . The network will carry two games a week when the season starts Nov . 19 . Can the NBA and other sports leagues be far behind ? TV-Radio Notes The Fox crew working the Ram-New Orleans game last Sunday generally did a good job on a wild game , but the announcers could have done a better job of explaining why the Rams ' Robert Bailey could pick_up a punt in the end zone and return it 103 yards for a touchdown . Many viewers were probably confused , thinking once the ball landed in the end zone it was a touchback . It appeared the Saints thought that . What announcers Joe Buck and Tim Green failed to point_out was that the ball has to be downed if it doesn ' t bounce_out of the end zone . Most punts that go_into the end zone end_up bouncing_out for an automatic touchback . Also , when Ram offensive line_coach Jim Erkenbeck was accidentally knocked_out by a Saint player on the sidelines , the announcers said it was special teams coach Wayne Sevier , no doubt causing his wife and family some concern . At least the mistake was corrected after a commercial break . Up and comer : Harvey Hyde , former Nevada Las Vegas and Pasadena City College coach who does a weeknight sports-talk show for Las Vegas ' KDWN , has been doing college football commentary for Radio Sports Creation national broadcasts on the American Sports Radio Network ( ASRN ) this season . He did last Saturday ' s UCLA-Arizona game and is scheduled to work the Notre Dame-USC game Nov . 26 . Said Hyde ' s boss , Richard Grishar , ASRN president : &quot; Harvey is tremendous , a combination of John Madden and Hank Stram . He ' s sees things nobody else does . The problem is that he is so good we probably won ' t be able to hold onto him. &quot; Recommended viewing : &quot; Sports Greats : One on One With David Hartman &quot; makes its debut on ESPN Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. , with profiles on Ken Griffey Jr. , Troy Aikman and Hakeem Olajuwon . The series was created by Angela Wilder , wife of James Worthy , who is also an executive producer . Other executive producers of the show are Jim Spence , former No . 2 man at ABC Sports behind Roone Arledge , and Frank Wheaton , a Century City sports and entertainment agent . The show is produced and directed by Frederick Smith Jr . . . . Recommended listening : ESPN Enterprises and Tommy Boy Music are marketing a compact_disc and cassette entitled &quot; Jock Rock &quot; that consists_of songs , chants and cheers heard at ballparks and arenas . . . . Recommended for kids : An NFL Films series , &quot; Grunt &amp; Punt , &quot; the first live-action / animated football show for kids , makes its debut on the Fox Kids Network Sunday at 11:30 a.m. Baseball , anyone ? Well , not quite . ESPN will televise a softball_game Nov . 15 at 6 p.m. involving some of baseball ' s biggest names -- Mike Piazza , Barry Bonds , Bobby Bonilla , Jose Canseco , Bret Saberhagen , Ozzie Smith , Frank Thomas , and Matt Williams , to name a_few . The game , already sold_out , will be played Nov . 6 at UCLA Jackie Robinson Field . It is a prelude to an evening gala at the Beverly Hilton to benefit the Michael Bolton and Bonds foundations . . . . For the record : It was noted here last week that NBC did not show Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler yelling at offensive lineman Bruce Wilkerson , but the incident was shown . . . . It was nice to hear commentator Bob Chandler , who is undergoing treatment for cancer at the USC Norris Center , back on the Raider broadcast Sunday .</TEXT>
