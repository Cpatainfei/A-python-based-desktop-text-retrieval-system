   <HEADLINE> NEW FINDINGS MOVE RUPTURE ZONE NORTH OF FIRST LOCATION ; SURVEY : MORE THAN 1 # 500 AFTERSHOCKS HAVE BEEN RECORDED SINCE MONDAY ' S TEMBLOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists on Friday reported finding extensive new surface cracking and likely rupture zones from the Northridge quake along the Santa Susana Mountains and in Potrero Canyon , five miles west of Castaic Junction near the Ventura County_line . A team from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and UC Berkeley said they had found cracks as wide as a foot and hundreds of feet in_length at the top of the Santa Susanas in an area extending about 10 miles west from the Newhall Pass , near the ruined interchange of the Antelope Valley ( California 14 ) and Golden State ( Interstate 5 ) freeways . Meanwhile , the U.S. Geological Survey reported that more_than a dozen scientists had made an on-site inspection of a 6- to 12-inch earth displacement in Potrero Canyon just off California 126 , several miles to the north of earlier reports of evidence of quake activity . Two USGS scientists at a Caltech news briefing called this a likely rupture zone from the quake . The sites of cracking , land displacement and a new cluster of aftershocks in the magnitude 4 range are all helping researchers delineate the exact extent of the Northridge quake . Generally speaking , this is a northwest trending oblong extending perhaps 20 miles from the northeast San Fernando Valley toward Ventura County . The epicenter of the quake has been officially put at 34 degrees , 13 minutes north and 118 degrees , 32 minutes west , or just northwest of the intersection of Roscoe and Reseda boulevards , about one mile south_southwest of the center of Northridge . Although UC Berkeley seismologists said they believe the quake reached a magnitude 6.8 , Caltech and the USGS stuck_with the original 6.6 figure . Magnitude estimates may change as more stations from around the world report their instrumental readings . Jim Mori , director of the USGS Pasadena field office , said that the aftershocks , although annoying and even scary to many residents , are not deviating from a normal pattern for quakes of such size as the magnitude 6.6 last Monday . More_than 1 # 500 aftershocks had been recorded through Friday afternoon . He said that a close analysis of the aftershocks since Monday showed there have actually been only two quakes in the magnitude 5 range ( a smaller figure than had been given earlier ) , about 30 in the 4 range and about 270 others in the 3 range . Caltech and the USGS said Friday that the aftershock zone extends 20 miles east-west , from San Fernando through the Santa Susana Mountains , and for about 18 miles from Northridge in the south to the Santa Clarita Valley in the north . &quot; From the seismological point_of_view , this was a very small earthquake , &quot; Mori said of the main shock . Worldwide in an average year , he said , there are about 150 such quakes . What made this one different was that it occurred in an urban_area and the damage and casualties were dramatic . Dan Ponti and Ken Hudnut , two USGS scientists , said the discovery of a likely rupture zone in Potrero Canyon , north of the Santa Susanas , indicates that a previously undiscovered fault lies_in the canyon and that there was ground movement along this fault . Similar signs of movement were reported Tuesday along the Mission Hills Fault , south of the Santa Susanas . It is common in such earthquakes that movement on one fault will trigger movement on others , and the aftershocks reflect this , scientists said . Cracks in Potrero Canyon run in rows of about 10 to 20 yards in open areas and at the bottom of the_hills in the canyon . Geologists who first went_into the canyon Wednesday said they expect to examine the surface disturbance for five more days . David Schwartz of the USGS , who was there Friday , said , &quot; It ' s possible this is the tip of the fault that produced the Northridge earthquake. &quot; About 3 # 000 head of cattle graze in the area . Ponti said that the surface rupture in Potrero Canyon extends about four miles . But the team of Berkeley scientists said in a statement that the cracking they had noted in the Santa Susanas extended even further . They also noted signs of some cracking in the_hills to the northeast of Antelope Valley-Golden State freeway interchange and postulated that the same forces that caused the cracks had caused the interchange to collapse . Pat Williams , a geologist with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , said the cracks made_it appear that the Santa Susana range was being pulled apart , which would be consistent with the notion that the quake squeezed the San Fernando Valley , with mountains from both the north and south of it moving closer together . Refining previous figures , scientists Friday estimated the Santa Susanas were raised by about 15 inches in the quake and that the Castaic Junction dropped_by 3 1 / 2 inches . The cracking most likely resulted from rumpling of the earth ' s crust as it was pushed together , much like a fold in a carpet , with the fractures occurring across the rumple ' s surface , Williams said Friday . A retired mining geologist , Frank Cox , who was hiking in the Santa Susanas on Friday , reported that he had come_upon an extensive network of fractures and rifts on a steep ridge above Omelveny Park near the mouth of Bee Canyon in Granada Hills . He said that in some spots , the hard-packed earth had been uplifted a foot and in other areas cracks had created a jigsaw_puzzle effect .</TEXT>
