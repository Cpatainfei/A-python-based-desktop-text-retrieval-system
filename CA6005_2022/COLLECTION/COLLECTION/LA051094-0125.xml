   <HEADLINE> EX-VICE PRESIDENT LAUNCHES BID TO REPLACE YELTSIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the roar of angry hard-liners behind him , ousted Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi launched a campaign Monday to replace Boris N . Yeltsin as president of Russia . In his first major public appearance since he stood on the balcony of the Russian Parliament building in October , urging a mob to storm the Ostankino television tower in a bid to overthrow Yeltsin , Rutskoi spoke_to 7 # 000 to 10 # 000 anti-Yeltsin demonstrators at a Victory_Day rally marking the Soviet_Union ' s 1945 triumph over Nazi Germany . He predicted his archenemy Yeltsin would be tossed_out of power -- without bloodshed -- before Victory_Day next year . &quot; The 50th anniversary of the victory over fascist Germany will be celebrated in completely different conditions , &quot; Rutskoi declared in a comeback blitz that borrowed themes from ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky . &quot; The police , anti-people regime will no longer exist. &quot; Rutskoi , crisply dressed and shorn of the Old_Testament beard he had grown during four months in prison , was chauffeured to the starting_point for the march in a lilac Mercedes-Benz . But his team of bodyguards discreetly dropped him off near the subway_station , making_it look as if the humble candidate had arrived by public transportation . The former Afghan War hero was introduced to the cheering crowd as &quot; the acting vice_president of Russia &quot; -- a title unused since Yeltsin fired , then jailed , his former running_mate after the Parliament was stormed Oct . 4 . Rutskoi was released in February under a controversial amnesty . &quot; Long live President Rutskoi ! &quot; chanted the crowd . One placard read , &quot; We Beat Fascism , We Shall Beat Yeltsinism. &quot; Rutskoi called_on the fragmented Russian opposition -- an array of nationalist , Communist , fascist and monarchist splinter_groups united mainly by virulent anti-Semitism -- to pull_together under Rutskoi ' s new movement , &quot; Great Power. &quot; In a leaflet distributed by supporters , Rutskoi called_for the re-establishment of a Russian superpower within the borders of the former Soviet_Union , a return to law and order and a halt to the impoverishment of huge segments of the population . &quot; Today everyone must choose , &quot; Rutskoi wrote . &quot; Either the road to a colonial future with mafia-criminal lawlessness , or superpower status and a dignified life. &quot; Yeltsin , meantime , marked Victory_Day by planting a tree in a new park dedicated to veterans on the western outskirts of Moscow , where the invading armies of Napoleon and Hitler faltered . In keeping with the nationalist tone he has been striking more often since Zhirinovsky scored big election gains in December , Yeltsin reminded the world that Russia must always be treated with respect . He praised the stoicism of the Russian people in 1993 and promised to revive Russia ' s grandeur and dignity in 1994 . &quot; We were united in the Great War , &quot; Yeltsin said . &quot; We can be united now in civil peace. &quot; Yeltsin has generally ignored Zhirinovsky and scoffed at the dozen other men who are believed to harbor presidential ambitions for 1996 . Yeltsin has said he will not run_for reelection , but aides have hinted otherwise . Polls show Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin could be a strong candidate . Another possible candidate is centrist Nikolai Travkin , who founded the Civic Union bloc with Rutskoi before breaking_with the then-vice president last April . Travkin was named to Yeltsin ' s Cabinet on Friday , but in characteristically disorganized fashion , Travkin ' s post has not been specified . Several hard-liners have also hinted they may run . But Rutskoi seems to get under Yeltsin ' s skin as no other rival can . In dueling interviews last month , Rutskoi told the Pravda newspaper that Yeltsin and his government are &quot; crooks , political rogues and nouveaux riches , people who have destroyed the Soviet_Union , spilled the blood of the country , destroyed the economy and the army and humiliated a great nation. &quot; In his retort , in Newsweek , Yeltsin said : &quot; Rutskoi cannot rise again as a politician . He will hamper us in minor things , but that ' s all he can do . People will not accept him , and he himself , psychologically , is not a man who stands firmly on his feet. &quot; Victory_Day celebrations elsewhere in the former Soviet_Union were also marked by controversy . In Sevastopol , the Crimean port that is home to the Black_Sea Fleet , Russian officers goose-stepped to the beat of the Ukrainian navy ' s marching band . But conflict over how the two nations will divide the strategic fleet spilled_over into jeers and hisses when the Ukrainian national_anthem was played . In Riga , a ceremony was held at the monument to the Soviet soldiers who liberated the city from the Nazis , but Latvian officials did not attend . The last Russian troops , whom Latvians consider an occupying army , are to be withdrawn before Aug . 31 . Lithuania did not celebrate Victory_Day at all . President Algirdas Brazauskas released a statement noting only that Lithuania was &quot; more_than once seized by different occupants , &quot; as it was invaded and re-invaded by Germany and the Soviet_Union in World_War_II .</TEXT>
