   <HEADLINE> SURFERS PAYING A HIGH PRICE FOR THEIR YEARS OF FUN IN THE SUN ; HEALTH : AS THE BABY-BOOMER INNOVATORS OF THE SPORT GROW OLDER , MANY ARE ALSO SUFFERING A TROUBLESOME ARRAY OF MALADIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Johnny Fain was Malibu ' s golden_boy of surfing in the late 1960s . Known for an aggressive surfing style of quick , slashing turns and &quot; hang-ten &quot; riding ( 10 toes over the nose of the board ) , Fain became one of the world ' s top surfers , and was rewarded with endorsements and years on the professional surfing tour . The only child of &quot; Lassie &quot; screenwriter Jeanne Bartlett , Fain grew_up in Malibu Colony and parlayed his blond good looks and surfing prowess into small movie and stunt parts in such cult classics as &quot; Muscle Beach Party , &quot; &quot; How to Stuff a Wild Bikini &quot; and &quot; Beach Blanket Bingo. &quot; But during years of rough-and-tumble surfing and prolonged exposure to the elements , Fain also racked_up a litany of ailments . More_than a dozen cancerous and precancerous skin lesions and moles have been removed from his face and body . He has endured three ear operations and four surgeries to remove growths from his eyes , and hundreds of stitches from surfboard collisions . And now a recent operation to repair a hip eroded from years of battering has left Fain on crutches . &quot; You have to believe you ' re invincible to reach a high level of surf expertise , &quot; said Fain , 50 . &quot; You have to go beyond what a normal person thinks_of as a human limit . I am paying a price for that attitude. &quot; So , too , are many other surfers , enthusiasts and their doctors say . Surfing , with an estimated 500 # 000 Southern California devotees , has always radiated images of fun and health , of bronzed bodies , youthful good looks and pristine beaches . But as the baby-boomer innovators of the sport grow older , some of them say a troublesome array of maladies has emerged . &quot; As opposed to the blunt trauma of a football injury , many surfers suffer from a series of cumulative ailments , &quot; said Steve Hawk , editor of Surfer Magazine . Hawk , 38 , who has been surfing for more_than 20 years , has suffered from chronic back , ear and nasal problems . &quot; It ' s almost death from a_thousand cuts. &quot; County officials say it is difficult to determine the extent of surfer illnesses and ailments . &quot; We don ' t have such a file , &quot; said Dr. Laurene Mascola , chief of the acute communicable_disease control unit of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services . &quot; Some surfers don ' t go_to a doctor and if they did , doctors have an abysmal rate of reporting routine diseases and illnesses. &quot; In general , surfers tend to be a fit bunch with strong muscles and lungs derived from hours of grueling paddling against the tides . Still , many surfers and their doctors say plenty of anecdotal evidence attests to the sport ' s health consequences . Middle-aged surfers in particular say they must cope_with a growing history of skin ulcers , reef cuts , lacerations from surfboard fins and surfer knots and craters -- bumps and cuts slow to heal from constant paddling and water exposure . In December , San Francisco physician Mark Renneker co-authored &quot; Sick Surfers , &quot; a book that outlines a comprehensive list of surfer maladies . Renneker founded the Surfer ' s Medical Assn . in 1986 , a Northern California-based international_organization of roughly 700 members , including 400 medical professionals , who are dedicated to improving the health of surfers . Renneker has chronicled such surfer ailments as chronic neck and back problems , fungal_infections from wet suits , fatty growths on the rib_cage from paddling and so-called &quot; ice-cream headaches &quot; -- migraines brought_on by dunking under huge waves in frigid water . * The book also attempts to answer surfer queries about angioedema -- the swelling of the extremities in cold water -- and even the consequences of ingesting surf wax , which is used to improve the grip on the boards . One of the most common maladies , however , is &quot; surfers ' ear , &quot; or exostosis . It is caused when excess water in the ear_canal evaporates in windy conditions and chills the ear . The body responds by growing extra bone in the ear_canal , obstructing hearing . The affliction is treated by drilling away the excess bone . &quot; I must get two to three surfers a month who have to have their ears drilled out with a high-speed diamond burr -- it ' s very painful , &quot; said Dr. Justin MacCarthy , a partner in a Pacific Palisades practice . &quot; I try to tell them to wear ear plugs , but they won ' t do_it . They say it affects their sense of balance. &quot; Surfers have their own descriptions of the pain of the operation and its aftermath . &quot; It ' s like a cherry_bomb going_off inside your head , but you ' re still living , &quot; said Fain . Exposure to the sun also has taken a toll . Many dermatologists are reporting increased cases of basal cell and squamous_cell_carcinoma , as well as malignant_melanoma . Veteran surfers also suffer from pterygiums , a tissue growth over the cornea of the eye caused by exposure to wind and ultraviolet_light . John Hearne , 45 , regional director of the Surfer Foundation , a nonprofit environmental organization , has cataracts on both eyes from sun exposure . &quot; I ' ve tried to wear ski-glasses with a leash , but it ' s a hassle in big surf when you ' re duck-diving under waves , &quot; he said . Aside from infirmities caused by the natural elements , many veteran Los Angeles-area surfers believe water_pollution is eclipsing the sunny elements of the sport . Amid uncertainty in the scientific world over whether toxins in Santa Monica Bay are making people sick , surfers believe they are unwittingly helping to establish a link between the water and certain illnesses . &quot; I feel_like we ' re the canaries in the coal mine -- we ' ve got this young healthy group of people that keeps getting sick , &quot; said David Saltman , former executive_director of the Surfrider Foundation . Rainwater washes untreated sewage , trash , debris , animal waste , pesticides and motor_oil into concrete rivers and storm drains that empty into Santa Monica Bay . In August , the American Oceans Campaign , a nonprofit environmental group , completed a two-year study that identified 160 toxic chemicals flowing into the bay from Los Angeles streets . Santa Monica Bay surfers say they suffer from a range of illnesses that could be related to pollution , such_as stomach_flu , skin_rashes and sinus and ear infections . The level of pollution increases dramatically after storms -- bad news for surfers , as that is when the waves are_best . And the prime surfing spots are near storm drains , which dump sediment onto a series of points , reefs and beach breaks . Better-shaped waves are produced as swells peel over the buildup . To many medical experts , storm surfing is a horrific combination . &quot; When diving under a big wave you ' re getting worked over pretty good , &quot; said Dr. Gordon LaBedz , a member of the Surfer ' s Medical Assn . and a Seal Beach resident . &quot; Bacteria-laden water is being forced into your sinuses . ( It ) sits in little hollow areas of your skull , which if it runs_down , can cause an upper-respiratory infection. &quot; An extreme and controversial medical case involves surfer Eric Villanueva , 22 . In May , 1992 , Villanueva came_down with flu-like symptoms after surfing near Malibu Lagoon in the wake of a storm . Within a month he had congestive_heart_failure , and two months later he received a heart transplant . Doctors found high levels of antibodies in Villanueva ' s blood caused by the coxsackie B virus , a strain found in human feces that can attack and weaken the heart . Public studies have located coxsackie B in Malibu Lagoon . &quot; If you go_out there after the rains , or after the berm is breached , you ' re gambling with your life , &quot; said Villanueva , who had to have a second transplant 11 months after the first one because of complications . But experts cannot say for_sure where he contracted the illness . &quot; It ' s possible that someone could get the virus while surfing in the bay , &quot; said Dr. Michele Hamilton , co-director of the UCLA cardiomyopathy program , which is treating Villanueva . &quot; However . . . it could have been poor hygiene , family contact or a restaurant. &quot; Many surfers are aware of the problems associated with the sport , but addiction to the waves overrides their concerns . Even after surfer Jeff Estep came_down with hepatitis_A shortly after surfing at Malibu , he remembers going surfing with his sons and walking past a sign_on a Malibu beach warning of possible unsafe water . &quot; I told my boys to check for any open wounds , and to just spit a lot , keep spitting . Then out we went. &quot; County officials recommend staying out of the water when such signs are displayed . But most surfers don ' t stay out of the water for long . Johnny Fain regularly and painfully swims a mile in the Pepperdine University swimming_pool to rehabilitate his hip -- and to get ready for his inevitable return to the surf : &quot; I ' m a gladiator . &quot; I ' ll be back_out there within eight months. &quot;</TEXT>
