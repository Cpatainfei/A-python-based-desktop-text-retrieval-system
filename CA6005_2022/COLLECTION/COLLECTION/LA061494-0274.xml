   <HEADLINE> BOTTOM FISHERS CASTING FOR BARGAIN APARTMENTS ; EARTHQUAKE : THE NORTHRIDGE TEMBLOR DEALT A BLOW TO THE ALREADY SHAKY MARKET IN MULTIFAMILY BUILDINGS . that ' s BAD NEWS FOR MANY OWNERS , BUT GOOD NEWS FOR REHAB SPECIALISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ad said a &quot; red tag special , &quot; but the 77-unit Studio City apartment hardly looked inviting . A wing of the horseshoe-shaped complex had collapsed as a result of the Northridge earthquake . The rest of the structure was crooked , leaning six inches north , and two swimming_pools contained cracked stucco , tattered clothes , broken furniture and glass . But to rehab specialist Ron Bien , it looked_like a bargain . Four years ago , the apartment was appraised at $ 5 million . The current owner , burdened by a big mortgage and not covered by earthquake insurance , agreed to sell it to Bien for $ 1.35 million . After the deal closes_in July , Bien plans to repair the building , spruce it up with new archways and landscaping , and reopen it by winter . &quot; If done properly , the returns will be substantial , &quot; said Bien , who owns RB Companies Inc. , a Woodland Hills general contracting and real_estate investment_firm . Bottom fishers like Bien are finding bargain-basement prices for quake-ravaged apartments . &quot; For the buyers , it ' s utopia now , &quot; said Bernard Haddigan , a managing director at the Marcus &amp; Millichap brokerage in Encino , which specializes in apartment_buildings . And for the previous apartment owners or sellers ? &quot; It ' s Armageddon , &quot; he said . One of Haddigan ' s co-workers , broker Al Mozafar , recently listed a 16-unit apartment in Sherman Oaks that was badly damaged by the quake . It sold within a week to a Los Angeles contractor who paid $ 387 # 500 -- less than half the appraised value a_couple_of years ago . &quot; He got an excellent price , &quot; Mozafar said . Even before the Jan . 17 quake , apartment owners in the San Fernando Valley were struggling . Last year a surging total of apartment foreclosures -- caused by double-digit vacancy_rates , declining rents and the local recession -- drove apartment values down to 1986 levels . Valley apartment_building sale prices have been falling 1 % a month since mid-1990 . On average , buyers paid $ 35 # 586 per apartment unit in the Valley last year , down 47 % from $ 66 # 599 in 1990 , according to Commercial Property Information Services in San Diego . Hardest hit have been apartments in North Hollywood , Van Nuys and Panorama City . Of the 444 apartment_buildings sold in the Valley last year , about half were bank repossessions , COMPS said . After the earthquake , inspectors from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety posted red ( unsafe ) and yellow ( limited entry ) tags_on more_than 500 apartment_buildings in the Valley . Brokers said many of these will wind_up in foreclosure , probably in the fall , since it takes several months for lenders to seize properties . &quot; Hundreds of apartment owners are at the point of determining whether they have the staying power to hold_on , &quot; said Bruce Hanes , owner of Hanes Investment Realty Inc. , a Westlake Village commercial brokerage . Hanes , a 20-year broker in the region , is more pessimistic than most . He doesn ' t see apartment_building prices in the Valley climbing out of the cellar until 1999 . One big apartment lender in the Valley , Glendale-based Fidelity Federal Bank , already saw an increase of $ 175 million in first-quarter loan delinquencies -- nearly all_of it from apartment owners -- as a result of the earthquake . Another problem is that only a fraction of apartments in the Valley were insured for earthquakes , analysts said . So apartment owners are finding it tough to get private or government loans for repairs because they have little or no equity in their properties . * Adding_to owners ' woes , voters last week rejected a state bond measure that would have enabled landlords without quake insurance to get special loans . &quot; The earthquake has just pushed a lot of people over the brink , &quot; said James Boyle , a senior executive_vice_president at Coast Federal Bank of Los Angeles , which has about $ 200 million of outstanding loans to Valley apartment owners . Coast is trying to work_out a solution with struggling borrowers , Boyle said , but &quot; some apartment owners just can ' t or won ' t do it. &quot; Crawford Meeks , owner of a 16-unit apartment in Van Nuys , sees no way_out of his situation . Meeks ' uninsured apartment had minor quake damage , but the bigger problem is his huge debt . Four years ago , the former Hughes engineer put a $ 280 # 000 down_payment on the property , then valued at $ 1.1 million . Two weeks ago , the same property was appraised at $ 425 # 000 , Meeks said . Meeks , 62 , was turned_down by his lender for a reduction in his mortgage principal , and now his building is in foreclosure proceedings . &quot; I ' m just a guy trying to build a little security for retirement , &quot; Meeks said , his voice wavering . But trouble for some is opportunity for others -- especially for contractors and developers who have the cash to buy now , fix_up properties and wait for things to get better . In effect , they are betting that the apartment market has finally hit bottom . It was just one week after the quake when Bien , the rehab specialist , spotted the dilapidated roof line of the Studio City apartment complex from his truck on the Hollywood Freeway . Bien got the address and tracked_down the owner through title records . Bien , 44 , knew he wanted it on his first walk through the property . Despite the building ' s horrific appearance , Bien found that the 77 units inside were basically sound . On a recent afternoon he showed a visitor a second-floor apartment with crack-free walls and undamaged bathroom tiles . &quot; You can move_into this , &quot; he said . Bien also liked the property ' s location -- near a highway , across the street from a church and surrounded by a park . Ed Delava , finance director with ACF Property Management in Sherman Oaks , brokered the sale of the Studio City property for the owner . Delava ran ads in national and local newspapers listing the building for $ 1.3 million . In two weeks , Delava said , more_than 100 people inquired , mostly Mom-and-Pop contractors in Los Angeles , but calls also came from big developers and syndicates from all_over the West Coast . Delava received a dozen offers , but Bien will get the building for $ 1.35 million , and the lender agreed to write_off $ 2 million on the loan , enabling the current owner to walk away without a scar on his credit rating . Although city inspectors estimated repairs for the Studio City apartment_building at $ 4 million , Bien figures he can rebuild the place for $ 1.5 million . Bien has been rehabbing apartments for 20 years . With seven employees , Bien does some construction work and subcontracts out the rest . Using steel beams and hydraulic jacks , he has even lifted apartment_buildings to reposition and transport them . In 1979 , Bien bought a 5 # 000-square-foot redwood house in Northridge , then hauled it , in four sections , to a knoll in Calabasas . He rehabbed the place and now lives there . &quot; I think it would scare the typical contractor , &quot; Bien said of the run-down Studio City apartment complex . &quot; But to me , it isn ' t a big deal . I ' ve moved buildings across town . This building only moved six inches. &quot; Bien owns and manages two_dozen apartment_buildings in Los Angeles , mostly in the inner_city . Now Bien is shopping to buy an additional half-dozen quake-damaged properties and seeking a partner to help him finance the deals . &quot; Opportunities are there , &quot; he said . Bottom fishers like Bien aren ' t betting_on apartment values climbing anytime soon . Instead , they ' re buying apartments largely for the cash flow . Some brokers say that excluding debt payments , the cash flow on an apartment investment today can reach 15 % to 20 % . &quot; The returns are phenomenal , &quot; claimed Melinda Russell , an apartment specialist at Zugsmith-Thind in Encino , a commercial real_estate brokerage . Last year Russell sold 22 apartment_buildings , double her sales in 1992 , and every one was a bank repossession . &quot; There are people out there scavenging because they think they can fix it cheap , &quot; Russell said . &quot; If they buy low enough , they can undercut their neighbor ' s rent. &quot; That possibility is another worry for current apartment owners . Valley rents are already down in some areas as much as 40 % from 1990 . And competition for tenants has been fierce , due_to high unemployment that has forced people to relocate out of state , move_back in with their parents or double_up . In recent years the vacancy_rate of the Valley ' s apartment market has averaged in the low teens , brokers say . With thousands of apartment units in the region lost in the quake , many expected intact Valley apartments to fill_up . But that hasn ' t happened , said Boyle , the Coast Federal Bank executive . Instead , tenants have fled to Calabasas , Thousand Oaks and other areas less affected by the quake . &quot; The recent memory is still there , so those people won ' t be moving_back &quot; to the Valley , Boyle said . As a result , when quake-damaged properties like Bien ' s reopen later this year , he said , they will help keep Valley apartment rents low and vacancy_rates high . &quot; I don ' t see much change in the foreseeable future. &quot;</TEXT>
