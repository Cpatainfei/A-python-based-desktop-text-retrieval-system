   <HEADLINE> DOCTOR ' S 20-YEAR-OLD DREAM BLOSSOMS INTO SOUTH BRONX CLINIC ; MEDICINE : THE SPANISH-SPEAKING STAFF AT SAN JUAN HEALTH CENTER REACHES_OUT TO THE COMMUNITY . THE FOCUS IS_ON PERSONAL CARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an abandoned building in the South Bronx filled with needles , garbage and broken pipes gushing gallons of water , Dr. Richard Izquierdo hatched a dream . He imagined a clinic where doctors , like their Puerto Rican patients , would speak Spanish . Where poor people -- just like middle-class people -- would see the same doctor every time they needed treatment and could call_for advice 24 hours a day . Where no one would be turned_away , and where everyone who walked in off the street for a rash or a cough would walk_out with a plan for better health . And where the doors would stay open -- no matter how bombed_out the neighborhood got . &quot; I was too dumb to know that it couldn ' t happen , so I did_it , &quot; he said . Izquierdo , 64 , bought the building in 1968 with $ 3 # 000 in borrowed money , and a year later he opened the San Juan Health Center with a group of private-practice doctors . But within a_few years he realized that a dozen solo practitioners could not provide the comprehensive care he envisioned . This year , the San Juan Health Center celebrates its 20th birthday as a nonprofit clinic . With 15 # 000 registered patients , 72 # 000 patient visits a year , and 20 to 30 new patients each day , it has become one of the largest independent clinics in the state . The doors open at 6:30 a.m. New patients are sent_off for the nutritional and social_service screening provided to everyone . Regular patients wait to be called_for appointments for diabetes , hypertension , asthma and other common problems . &quot; I don ' t know what I would do if I didn ' t come here , &quot; said Deborah Rivers as her 13-month-old , Shavona , was given a tuberculosis test . Kim Jenkins brings her 3-year-old and 7-month-old sons for checkups . &quot; You see the same doctors . that ' s why I like it . Somebody is looking_at your chart who ' s familiar_with it. &quot; Not only do the doctors speak Spanish , but the nutritionists also plan their dietary recommendations around traditional Spanish food . &quot; We laugh and cry in the language of our patients , &quot; said Izquierdo . There are programs for AIDS , tuberculosis and prenatal care ; off-site clinics in a local high_school , drug rehab center and a homeless shelter ; and special_sessions for adolescents . &quot; The first day of the adolescent session was an eye-opener , &quot; Izquierdo recalled . &quot; There were a half-dozen teen-agers . Three were pregnant and four tested positive for TB. &quot; And when a state institution for the retarded closed_in 1988 and placed its clients in group homes , the clinic agreed to help . &quot; Today we are the largest health-care provider to mentally_retarded in the_Bronx , with 800 patients , &quot; Izquierdo said . But health_care is only part of what the clinic provides . There ' s a Halloween parade , ceremonies honoring teen-agers for academic achievement , a newsletter that lists patient birthdays , and volunteer work that helps both the clinic and the person doing_it . &quot; I ' m building job skills , and I ' ve learned a lot about computers , &quot; said volunteer Bernice Perez , 38 , as she handed a stack of papers to an administrator . Jessica Rivera , 15 , who has been a patient at the clinic since she was born , worked there last summer and now wants to go_to medical_school . &quot; They inspired me , &quot; she said . &quot; They treat you like a friend instead of a patient. &quot; Dr. Acklema Mohammad was a teen-ager when she began working part time for Izquierdo ; now she is head of pediatrics . And the director of external affairs , Rosemarie Longo , was Izquierdo ' s patient as a child . The clinic is an economic Rock_of_Gibraltar in an area that was once a burnt-out moonscape overrun_with pushers and hookers . When it first opened , it had but a_few dozen patients a day , most of them &quot; bums , &quot; as one administrator put it . Today , the Hunts Point area where the clinic is located is making a comeback . Women push strollers on every corner , and shops and restaurants bustle along Southern Boulevard , the main_drag . &quot; The health_problems of this community don ' t only stem from disease , &quot; said Paloma Hernandez , Izquierdo ' s daughter and the clinic ' s executive_director . &quot; So we have to be committed to improving the whole socioeconomic status of the community . We ' re part of the infrastructure. &quot; Every inch of the clinic ' s 16 # 000 square_feet is crammed with tiny offices , examining rooms , waiting areas and equipment . There are 113 people on staff , including 15 doctors , plus another dozen consulting specialists . The $ 5-million budget is mostly paid_for by Medicaid reimbursement , but foundation grants are being sought to fund the purchase of a nearby vacant_lot where a much larger facility could be built . Izquierdo ' s latest goal is to double his space and his patient load , and even perhaps open a birthing center and a food pantry . He can hardly believe that his original vision ever came_to pass . &quot; I started all_of this ? &quot; he said , looking_around . &quot; I can ' t believe it , that it was once just a dream in my head. &quot;</TEXT>
