   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO DEVELOP RULES FOR GULF VETERANS SEEKING DISABILITY AID</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although the cause of pain , headaches and fatigue plaguing some Persian_Gulf_War veterans remains a mystery , officials said Friday they hope to create guidelines by this summer that will enable those afflicted to qualify for disability_benefits . Officials from the departments_of_defense and veterans affairs and the National Institutes of Health will meet in May in an effort to develop diagnostic guidelines for what has become known as &quot; Persian_Gulf syndrome. &quot; Once that is done , benefits could become available to veterans &quot; who can be shown to have that type of illness and associate that with their period of military_service , &quot; said Dr. Robert Roswell , chief_of_staff at the VA medical_center in Birmingham , Ala . Roswell will direct the Persian_Gulf Veterans Coordinating Board , established Friday to coordinate research into the unexplained ailments , medical treatment and the dissemination of information among the VA , the Defense_Department and the Department of Health and Human Services . Slightly less than 10 % of the 30 # 000 disability claims submitted since the war ended in February , 1991 , have been based on alleged exposures to various environmental hazards . They include Kuwaiti oil_well fires , parasites , petrochemicals , tank shells made of depleted uranium , microwaves and possible traces of chemical and biological_warfare agents . All of the environment-related claims are being funneled through the VA ' s regional office in Louisville , Ky . Of approximately 2 # 800 submitted so far , more_than 900 have been denied while 163 have been ruled service-connected disabilities , said Gary Hickman , director of the VA ' s compensation and pension service . About 1 # 700 remain unresolved , he said . &quot; Certainly , this was a very environmentally dirty war , &quot; Roswell said . &quot; I personally believe that we ' re likely to find that there are multiple causes for the symptoms that remain undiagnosed. &quot; Under a bill passed_by Congress last year , Gulf War veterans do not have to prove their illness ' s connection to their service to get treatment at the VA ' s 172 hospitals . &quot; We believe there are several hundred to possibly 1 # 000 or 2 # 000 veterans who have symptoms which at this time we ' re not_able to adequately explain , &quot; Roswell said . &quot; We ' re not excluding the possibility that chemical ( warfare ) agents might have been a factor even though the confirmed detections were only present in very , very low doses that probably would not be clinically significant , &quot; he said . Thousands of the 650 # 000 military_personnel who participated in the Persian_Gulf_War have been treated for other service-connected ailments and injuries .</TEXT>
