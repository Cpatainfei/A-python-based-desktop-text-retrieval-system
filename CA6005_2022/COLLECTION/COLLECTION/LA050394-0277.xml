   <HEADLINE> VALLEY / VENTURA DIGEST : PITCHER LEAVES SIMI VALLEY HIGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bill Scheffels , The Times ' Ventura County pitcher of the year last season , dropped_out of Simi Valley High on Monday rather than face an expulsion hearing for making a prank bomb threat last week at school . Scheffels , a senior , enrolled Monday in the Simi Valley Adult School and Career Institute , apparently ending his high_school baseball career . He plans to finish his four remaining courses through independent study and earn his diploma over the next few months , his father , Gene Scheffels , said . But Scheffels ' status remains unclear . Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers called Scheffels on Monday night and told him &quot; to give him one more day &quot; before dropping_out of Simi Valley High , Gene Scheffels said . &quot; I don ' t think ( Scheffels ) is going_to the adult school , &quot; Scyphers told The Times . Gene Scheffels was confused about Scyphers ' call , because he said his son had already turned_in his books and completed the paperwork to drop_out of Simi Valley High . &quot; I know he ' s enrolled at the adult_education program , &quot; Gene Scheffels said . &quot; He ' s scheduled to go_over there in the morning . But Coach Scyphers called_for Bill and he said to just give him one more day. &quot; Scheffels decided to enroll at the adult school because all indications were that Principal Kathryn Scroggin was going_to recommend to the school_board that Scheffels be expelled , his father said , and the board was unlikely to oppose Scroggin ' s recommendation . Gene Scheffels said school_board administrators told him after his son dropped_out Monday that the board would not pursue an expulsion hearing . Scheffels ' scholarship to UNLV will not be affected as long as he earns a diploma , Gene Scheffels said . &quot; I wanted to play baseball , &quot; Scheffels said , &quot; but unfortunately it didn ' t work_out that way . I just want to graduate and move_on now. &quot; Scheffels , who was leading the Pioneer baseball_team in batting and in pitching victories , was suspended from school indefinitely Wednesday after he made a phony bomb threat from a cellular_phone during a morning English_class . Another student dialed the school ' s main number and handed the phone to Scheffels , he said . &quot; I definitely ( regret it ) now , &quot; Scheffels said . No arrests have been made in connection with the case but the police are still investigating , a Simi Valley police spokesman said Monday . JEFF FLETCHER</TEXT>
