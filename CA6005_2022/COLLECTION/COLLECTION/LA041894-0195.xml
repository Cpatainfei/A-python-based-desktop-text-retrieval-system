   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A WITH HENRY MANCINI ; TURNING 70 , WITH WINE , ROSES AND A FEW THORNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Henry Mancini turned 70 Saturday and the event will be celebrated Tuesday night in a benefit_concert at UCLA Pauley Pavilion . It comes at a particularly difficult time . In February , Mancini was diagnosed as having inoperable cancer . He nonetheless remains alert and optimistic , and is close to completing the music for a Broadway version of &quot; Victor / Victoria. &quot; Mancini ' s list of achievements and honors is long and varied . &quot; Moon River , &quot; &quot; Days of Wine and Roses &quot; and &quot; Charade &quot; have become pop song classics , and &quot; Baby Elephant Walk , &quot; &quot; Pink Panther &quot; and the theme for &quot; Peter Gunn &quot; are instrumental perennials . His film scores range from &quot; The Glenn Miller Story &quot; and &quot; Breakfast at Tiffany ' s &quot; to &quot; Touch of Evil , &quot; &quot; 10 &quot; and &quot; Victor / Victoria. &quot; Mancini has received 72 Grammy nominations and won 20 . Fourteen Academy Award nominations have resulted in four Oscars , and his more_than 90 albums have produced eight gold records . Born in Cleveland on April 16 , 1924 , he was raised in Aliquippa , Pa . His studies at the Juilliard School_of_Music were interrupted in 1943 for Army Air Corps and infantry service . After World_War_II , he arranged music for the Tex Beneke Orchestra before starting his film career at Universal-International in 1952 . Mancini married the former Ginny O ' Connor -- an original member of Mel Torme ' s MelTones -- in 1947 . They have three children . * Question : I know that you ' re aiming for a late November opening of the stage version of ' Victoria , &quot; your big project of the moment . How ' s it coming_along ? Answer : The only thing I have left right now , and it ' s a big one , is the Jim Garner character ' s number . I ' m about halfway through , and the harder part is yet to come , but I ' m not worried about it . * Q : Has the show flowed fairly easily from the film version ? A : Well , the first song we wrote was in 1982 , then Blake Edwards got sick and we had to put it aside for a while . But the stage version is very different . We ' re not using any of the music from the picture . And , frankly , I ' m kind of happy about that , although there were a_couple_of good songs in the movie . But we wanted to get new . We wanted to get fresh approaches . And Julie Andrews , who ' ll be starring again , wanted that , too . You know , the words have to come_out of her mouth . I just try to give Julie and Leslie ( Bricusse , the lyricist ) that platform so that the words are right . A lot of times I ' ve done music first , and occasionally Leslie ' s done the words first . But the words are what Julie is singing , not la , la , la , la . And she knows what she wants and what feels right . * Q : How does_it feel to be thinking_about music from a Broadway , rather than a film , point_of_view ? A : I ' ve lived my life in the movies since I started_out in 1952 at Universal . &quot; Here kid , here ' s the picture . We need music ; put it here , here , here , here and here . Do it. &quot; That was what they said . Then , as you get more successful , they get more kind to you . But on stage , as you move along , you move along with the director and the choreographer and the lyricist . You gotta start thinking alike or else it falls_apart . But it ' s a good thing , if you have any pride in what you do . It ' s not a gig . Let me put it that way . I mean , look_at me , for Pete ' s sake . Here I am trying to step_in to a place with Fritz Loewe and Richard Rodgers . You know what that does ? It keeps you honest , knowing these other cats have come_before . * Q : With this 70th birthday coming_up , is there anything in particular that stands_out in memory for you ? A : I think that popularity-wise , it was &quot; Peter Gunn. &quot; But as far as emotionally and artistically , I think it was the score I did for Orson Welles ' &quot; Touch of Evil. &quot; If you listen to that score you ' ll hear a lot of things that finally developed further in film music . Because Welles didn ' t want the ordinary kind of thing . He hired a whole new band for the score . He didn ' t use the Universal orchestra . Shelly Manne came_in , and Pete Candoli , Milt Bernhardt , and the bongo whiz , Jack Costanza . Of course , while something like that is happening , you ' re so busy that you kind of forget to smell the roses . * Q : And the hot part of your career ? A : That started after I left Universal , with &quot; Breakfast at Tiffany ' s. &quot; And I went right from &quot; Tiffany &quot; to &quot; Experiment in Terror , &quot; and then &quot; Days of Wine and Roses. &quot; Then &quot; Charade &quot; came_along , and &quot; Pink Panther. &quot; It was just a roll . It was a burst of energy . And the one thing that I remember about it is that I was never hassled . There ' s a mentality in the film community that everything is late , everything is a hassle , the director ' s going_to kill you . All that stuff . All the negative stuff . And sometimes it does happen that way . But I just went_through it and enjoyed the hell out of it . And I still do . I just love what I do . * Q : When did that feeling of enjoyment begin ? When did you first sense that there was something magical in this work that you do ? A : It took a while for magical to show_up . Because when you ' re a young arranger -- and I started when I was 13 or 14 -- just to get the notes down on the paper , and then hear it , was something . It wasn ' t like magic , it was like you built something and it worked . That was good_enough . Then , when I started to write for big_bands in the Army , I began to step back and listen , not just to the notes on paper , but to actually think_about musical lines and stuff . that ' s when it started to get magical . And then later on with the Tex Beneke band , with strings , that was a big step . And it ' s been that way ever since , when you say magical . * Q : If you had to define one , central aspect of the Mancini magic , what would it be ? A : Melody , I guess . I don ' t want to say that I can ' t write a bad melody , but I try not to . I ' m very conscious of melody . But it ' s not only the long sweeping lines that people think_of in some movies . A good theme -- like the &quot; Pink Panther &quot; or &quot; Baby Elephant Walk &quot; -- can work all_the way through the picture , which is what I did with them . So , for me , a good melody is not just a pretty tune . * Q : So the work still captivates you ? A : Oh , sure . It always has . I haven ' t changed , not since I was 13 years old , copying sax choruses off Artie Shaw records and not knowing what the hell I was doing . * Q : And this development with your health ? A : Well , when that first came_about , I was thinking , &quot; What ' s going_to happen when I go upstairs and try to write ? &quot; And , I ' ll be damned , I came_up here and wrote , that ' s all , like nothing ' s wrong . I had no worries about the inevitability or where the thing ' s going . can ' t . can ' t do that . I don ' t know . Maybe it ' ll hit me later . Way later . * A tribute to Henry Mancini , benefiting the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts and the Los Angeles County High_School for the Arts , with Luciano Pavarotti , Julie Andrews , Andy Williams , Quincy Jones , John Williams and Dudley Moore .
