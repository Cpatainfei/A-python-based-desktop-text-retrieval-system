   <HEADLINE> STATE TEACHERS UNION ENDORSES BROWN FOR GOVERNOR ; EDUCATION : ACTION COMES AS NATIONAL CONVENTION GETS UNDERWAY IN ANAHEIM , WITH AL GORE TO SPEAK TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 40 # 000-member California Federation of Teachers endorsed gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown here Saturday as the parent American Federation of Teachers ' 73rd convention got underway , with leaders introducing the issues that will occupy the union ' s delegates through Tuesday . &quot; We know that Kathleen Brown cares deeply about kids -- big kids and little kids -- at all levels , &quot; said California Federation of Teachers President Mary Bergan , a vice_president of the national organization . &quot; We are very proud to endorse her. &quot; The state organization , which had endorsed state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi in the gubernatorial primary in June , has had some differences with Brown in the past , in part regarding her support for charter schools . But Brown vowed Saturday to focus_on a common goal : improving the state ' s public_school system . &quot; I ' m here to focus_on the areas where we can work together , &quot; she said at a news_conference held before the union ' s national president , Albert Shanker , and U.S. Secretary_of_Education Richard W . Riley welcomed 4 # 000 delegates to the Anaheim Convention Center . Brown promised to implement a job training_program for high_school students , pump $ 100 million in technology into the schools and work to achieve campus safety . She also took a jab at Gov . Pete Wilson , echoing her campaign television commercial , which accuses him of reducing funds for education . &quot; Pete Wilson has had his chance , and he gets a failing grade , &quot; Brown said . Outside the convention center , more_than 50 members of the African United Front of Los Angeles and the Coalition Against Black Exploitation protested the convention , criticizing the AFT for refusing to consider the merits of an Afrocentric curriculum . The AFT has been unwilling to engage in scholarly debate about moving away from a Eurocentric focus_on history in public education and highlighting African contributions to history and world civilization , community activist Nzinga Heru said . She said the protesters are asking_for an opportunity to present their views and have them published in American Teacher , the AFT publication . They also want the AFT to assemble a committee of Afrocentrists to provide the union with a book list , and they ask that the union hold local seminars on the issue . The AFT issued a statement Saturday in response to the protest , saying that it &quot; respects the heritage and value of every child &quot; but does not endorse &quot; Afrocentrism or any other educational approach based on ideology. &quot; Delegates from the 852 # 000-member American Federation of Teachers , whose convention opened Friday , began formal sessions Saturday . The convention , which runs_through Tuesday , features an address today by Vice_President Al Gore . In addition to Brown and Riley , state Rep . Tom Umberg ( D-Garden Grove ) , a candidate for attorney_general , welcomed delegates Saturday , along with state Rep . Delaine Eastin ( D-Fremont ) , who is running_for superintendent of public instruction . Brown , Umberg and Eastin all issued impassioned pleas for the defeat of the &quot; Save Our State &quot; initiative on the November ballot , which would deny health and educational benefits to illegal immigrants and their children , whether or not they were born in the United States . &quot; It is not a ' Save Our State ' initiative . It is a ' Separate the People of Our State ' initiative , &quot; Brown said . The initiative would force teachers to police their students rather than teach them , she said . Umberg said the measure would pose a public safety hazard by placing thousands of schoolchildren out on the streets with nothing to do .</TEXT>
