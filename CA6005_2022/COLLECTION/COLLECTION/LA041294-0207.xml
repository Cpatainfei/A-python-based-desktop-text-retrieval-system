   <HEADLINE> CHOOSING THEIR WEAPONS ; CANCER SURVIVORS TELL CIRCLE 1000 MEMBERS HOW THEY ' VE FOUGHT THE BATTLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Diana Golden and Susan Nessim are both young_women who have survived cancer , but they offered two very different accounts of their battle with the disease . Golden and Nessim recently spoke at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach to 350 members of Circle 1000 , the Hoag Hospital Foundation ' s support group for the Hoag Cancer Center . Circle 1000 members contribute a minimum of $ 100 to the foundation annually , and in exchange they receive an invitation to the brunch . Many members give much more_than the minimum donation ( a dozen gave more_than $ 5 # 000 ) , so actual proceeds from the brunch exceeded $ 220 # 000 . Downhill Racer Golden , 31 , and Nessim , 36 , were first stricken with cancer in their youths , and both found different but effective ways of coping_with their illness and its aftermath . Golden lost her right leg to bone cancer at age 12 , yet became an award-winning skier . She received an Olympic gold medal in the women ' s disabled giant slalom at the 1988 Winter_Olympics in Calgary and won 19 U.S. Disabled National Championship gold medals . Wearing an emerald green dress and accompanied by Midnight_Sun , her giant Alaskan malamute that carries her bags , Golden talked_about overcoming fear -- using her skiing experiences as a metaphor for facing life ' s challenges . &quot; Imagine you ' re getting ready to ski , &quot; she said , and before anyone knew it she had climbed atop a table with crutches in_hand . Standing on her one leg high above the audience , she imitated her movements as she recalled tackling a particularly &quot; vicious &quot; downhill course . &quot; This is not a graceful ski ride , this is hang_on for your life , baby , &quot; she said , twisting , turning and suddenly jumping_off the table toward an imaginary finish_line , causing many in the audience to gasp . &quot; It ' s laying it on the line for what you love , &quot; she said . A year ago Golden underwent a bilateral mastectomy for breast_cancer . She has given_up ski_racing full time but she still skis , hikes and tours as a motivational speaker . &quot; People ' s understanding of cancer always needs to be broadened , &quot; she said . Tale of Rejection Nessim was 17 when she developed a rare form of childhood cancer that attacked one section of her thigh . After leaving the dark and painful &quot; kingdom of the ill , &quot; she found she still had another battle to wage : getting people to accept her . As a cancer survivor Nessim has encountered rejection , isolation and discrimination in the workplace . She recalled how , as a college_student , she got engaged and went_to visit her fiance ' s parents on spring break . At one point her fiance ' s mother turned_to her and asked , &quot; What ' s it like living with a time_bomb inside of you ? &quot; Her worst fears were confirmed at dinner when the father said , &quot; I love my son , but I don ' t want him to be a widower. &quot; &quot; I felt part of me died at that table , &quot; Nessim said . In 1985 she founded a support group for cancer survivors called Cancervive that helps people deal with the aftermath of their illness . She has written a book called &quot; Cancervive : The Challenge of Life After Cancer &quot; and is working_on several children ' s books dealing with cancer . Brunch chairwoman Arden Flamson said the speakers were chosen in part because of their age . &quot; Cancer can strike young people , too , &quot; she said . Hoag Hospital Foundation is the fund-raising arm of Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian , a nonprofit community hospital in Newport Beach . Among the guests : Sandy Sewell , Circle 1000 founding chairwoman ; Al Auer , chairman of the Hoag Hospital board ; Robert Dillman , medical director of the Hoag Cancer Center ; Patti Jamieson , executive_director of the Hoag Cancer Center ; Frances Applegate , Hyla Bertea , Sherry Cagle , Patricia Cox , Jacquelyn Dillman , Louise Ewing , Lillian Fluor , Betty Grazer , Jodi Greenbaum , Michael and Kellina Hayde , Charles and Nora Hester , Nora Jorgensen Johnson , Don and Dorothy Koll , Anabel Konwiser , Susan Phillips , Judy Steele , Dottie Stillwell , Judith Swedlund , Rita Teller , Catherine Thyen , Ginny Ueberroth and Janet Curci Walsh .
