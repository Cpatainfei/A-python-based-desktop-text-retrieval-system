   <HEADLINE> ON FIRST TRIP TO MOSCOW , ELIZABETH GETS ROYAL TREATMENT ; RUSSIA : THE BRITISH QUEEN HAS AN ENVIABLE ITINERARY . BUT OTHER EVENTS POINT_UP DANGERS IN A TROUBLED NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The queen wore lavender blue , and appeared amused . Boris Nikolayevich folded his hands neatly into his lap like an oversized schoolboy on his very best behavior . As Britain ' s Queen Elizabeth_II and Russia ' s President Boris N . Yeltsin sat side_by_side chatting in the gold-and-cream splendor of the Kremlin ' s Catherine Hall on Tuesday , the photographic flash power was sufficient to light_up Siberia in December . This is the queen ' s first trip to Russia , and her itinerary is to die for . In the first two days of her four-day visit , the monarch saw the hidden treasures of the Kremlin , attended the ballet &quot; Giselle &quot; at the Bolshoi Theater with President and Mrs . Yeltsin , strolled across Red Square , heard a Russian Orthodox choir harmonize under the golden domes of Assumption Cathedral and met the Orthodox patriarch . She drove through Moscow in her own Rolls-Royce , shipped from London for the occasion , visited a Russian school and accepted a silver samovar made in the ancient metalworking city of Tula . Today the queen and her husband , the Duke of Edinburgh , leave for St . Petersburg . Since the Russian media are less interested than their British counterparts in rumors of divorce in the House_of_Windsor , and more interested in the pomp and circumstance of a monarchy that outlasted their own , the trip has gone swimmingly . Moscow made much of the symbolism of the visit by a queen whose grandfather called the last Russian czar , Nicholas II , &quot; Cousin Nicky. &quot; Yeltsin said the queen ' s presence proved that Russia is_on the road to democracy . Although Russia has repudiated the Bolshevik revolutionaries who assassinated Nicholas in 1918 , upheavals in the last two days have reminded Russians that their country is once again a troubled and dangerous place . Shortly before the queen ' s plane landed at Vnukovo airport Monday , an investigative reporter at Moscow ' s largest daily newspaper was killed in a huge explosion after opening a booby-trapped briefcase . A lawmaker announced that 27-year-old Dmitri Kholodov was to have testified before Parliament this week about alleged illegal arms trading by high-level Russian military_officers stationed in Germany . Colleagues said Kholodov picked_up the briefcase at a train_station , after being told by an anonymous caller that it contained incriminating documents on the subject , and took it back to the Moskovsky Komsomolets newsroom . Another reporter was injured in the blast . Kholodov ' s editors accused top military officials -- specifically , Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev -- of complicity in the killing . Grachev indignantly denied the charge . At a news_conference Tuesday , the newspaper ' s editor in chief , Pavel Gusev , announced that several days before Kholodov ' s death , the reporter had visited a military base where organized crime groups had allegedly sent gangsters to be trained as hit_men . Kholodov had also written_about alleged corruption in the Federal Counterintelligence Service , a successor agency to the KGB . Gusev said members of the armed forces general_staff might also have wanted him dead . Grachev , on a trip to Kaliningrad , said he believes Kholodov ' s murder was politically motivated . But he called the accusations of military involvement an insulting attempt to rekindle anti-army hysteria and suggested that he may sue Gusev for slander , the Interfax news_agency reported . In other disturbing news this week , Russian counterintelligence authorities Monday seized 60 pounds of industrial-grade uranium that may have been destined to be smuggled into Iraq , local news_agencies reported Tuesday . Also Tuesday , trading on one of Moscow ' s main stock_exchanges was suspended after a bomb threat . And even as the queen was being toasted Tuesday evening at a state dinner in the Kremlin ' s Hall of Facets , the Echo Moscow radio_station reported that Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin had resigned . Chernomyrdin ' s press secretary immediately denied the story after talking with his &quot; bewildered &quot; boss .</TEXT>
