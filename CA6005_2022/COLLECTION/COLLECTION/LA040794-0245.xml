   <HEADLINE> PASSING THE TASTE TEST ; YOUTHS URGED TO MAKE HEALTHFUL CHOICES AT EAT-RIGHT FESTIVAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Daniel Noon , a sixth-grader at MacArthur Fundamental Intermediate School in Santa Ana , filled his lunch plate to overflowing Wednesday with lettuce , carrots , raisins and strawberries , and complained : &quot; I don ' t have any more room. &quot; Only a_few years ago , school-age kids like Daniel likely would have had nothing to do with fruits and vegetables . But he acknowledges that his tastes have changed . This kind of dietary make-over is exactly what state officials and the local chapter of the American Cancer Society were promoting Wednesday as they presided over a spectacular smorgasbord of fruits and vegetables and invited some 200 Santa Ana elementary_school children to dig_in . Held at the Sporting Club at Lakeshore Towers , the rally-like event was part of the state ' s &quot; Children ' s 5 a Day -- Power_Play &quot; program , which is advocating that everyone , including children , eat_at least five daily servings of fruits and vegetables , as specified by federal health guidelines . And there were plenty of credible role_models on_hand : Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner , Gayle Wilson , wife of California Gov . Pete Wilson , and Kimberly Belshe , director of the California Department of Health Services . The eat-right festival had a message that was summarized by Wilson in her talk to the children . She told them that eating healthful foods not only reduces the incidence of cancer by a third , but it is a &quot; cool &quot; thing to do . Parents want that same information stressed more frequently in the media , data from Belshe shows . A survey of 495 parents conducted last year shows that 93 % want to require TV commercials to promote good nutrition . Also , 68 % would restrict the kinds of foods that advertisers would be allowed to push to minors . &quot; I think it is a recognition by parents that children , like adults , are influenced by what they see on television , &quot; Belshe said later in an interview . &quot; I think the most commonly advertised foods are sweetened cereals and beverages , candy and advertisements for fast-food restaurants. &quot; Parents have good reason to worry about children ' s eating habits , Belshe said , noting that her agency determined last spring that only one in four children in California eat the recommended five daily servings of fruits and vegetables . That wasn ' t the case on Wednesday , as the 9- to 12-year-olds helped themselves to the event ' s featured 180-foot salad_bar , which is expected to be entered officially in the Guinness Book of World_Records as the world ' s largest . To stress the idea that good eating is fun , American Cancer Society volunteers dressed as carrots , corn and celery , while a rapper had the children clapping as he rhymed , &quot; You need fuel to make your engine go . . . . Don ' t want to burn_out ' cause you got_to grow. &quot; The survey , which Belshe said is the first the state has ever taken of parents ' attitudes toward their children ' s diet , also showed that 99 % want nutrition and physical_fitness taught in school . Also , parents strongly disapprove of having fast foods sold at schools , a growing trend in recent years ; almost all said they want only healthful foods sold on campuses . Sue Foerster , chief of the nutrition and cancer prevention program for the California Department of Health Services , objected that &quot; a number of school districts are capitulating &quot; to the efforts of fast-food chains to move_into school cafeterias . Noting that variety is a central tenet of good eating , she said that &quot; fast food doesn ' t promote balanced nutrition &quot; because &quot; by definition ( it offers ) a limited menu. &quot; She also complained that allowing fast foods to be served in identifiable wrappers promotes &quot; commercialism on campus. &quot; There are some dissenters , among them Daniel Crawford , who runs food services at the Capistrano Unified School District , which in 1992 became the first school district in the state to establish a fast-food program in its high_schools . Crawford said he doesn ' t believe the parents surveyed understand that schools negotiate with the fast-food chains to ensure that only nutritious food is served in the cafeterias . &quot; We don ' t serve the traditional fast-food menu , &quot; he said , shunning such traditional fast-food fare as deep-fried chicken and potatoes . The main reason for serving fast foods , Crawford said , is &quot; to try to keep the kids on campus so they would not eat junk foods. &quot; Even Belshe takes a somewhat moderate view of chain foods , saying they need not be banned from campus if they adhere to some nutritional guidelines . &quot; To the extent they can provide healthy options , it is not necessarily bad , &quot; she said . &quot; It would be unfair to presume all fast-food restaurants are providing unhealthy foods , when in fact more and more are responding to the growing interest of the public to eat nutritious food. &quot; Janis Smith , spokeswoman for Irvine-based Taco Bell , which provides food to more_than 2 # 500 schools nationwide , observed , &quot; The first_step in good nutrition is to get kids to eat and not skip meals . Kids love Taco Bell food and therefore we find ( at schools that have Taco Bell ) kids are eating lunch more ( often ) than they would otherwise. &quot; Barry Sackin , director of food services for the Anaheim Union High_School District and Anaheim ' s elementary_schools , agreed that a key issue is to serve school kids the food they want . The purpose of Wednesday ' s lunch was to demonstrate that fruit and vegetables &quot; are good to eat and fun and colorful , &quot; he said . &quot; We are refocusing our energy on training children to make healthy choices. &quot;</TEXT>
