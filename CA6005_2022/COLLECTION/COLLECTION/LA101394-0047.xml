   <HEADLINE> A MAN OF PEACE ? JURY IS STILL OUT ; NOBEL COMMITTEE WOULD BE PREMATURE TO TAP PLO ' S YASSER ARAFAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are many compelling reasons the world should acknowledge and even reward the recent progress toward peace in the Middle_East . That said , however , the decision reportedly made by the Nobel Prize Committee to grant its prestigious 1994 Peace Prize to both Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is both premature and problematic . A formal announcement by the usually staid and secretive Nobel committee is_due Friday in Olso . But already word of Arafat ' s selection , as well as lingering questions about the long-term viability of the nascent peace process , has justifiably generated controversy . The last time the Nobel committee created this kind of stir was 1973 , when it split the prize between Henry A . Kissinger , secretary_of_state in the Nixon Administration , and North Vietnam ' s Le Duc Tho . It turned_out that peace would not return to Vietnam until two years later , and not without a great_deal more bloodshed . Given that experience , it is indeed peculiar that the committee would move so quickly to honor the_likes_of Yasser Arafat . Taking nothing away from last year ' s historic Israeli-PLO agreement , which called_for normalization of relations and began the process of transferring autonomy to the Palestinians in the long-disputed West_Bank and Gaza Strip , there are still troubling questions about the PLO leader ' s commitment to peace . For one there is Arafat ' s historical link to terrorism , including the 1972 attack on Israeli athletes taking_part in the Olympics at Munich . Also , it is worth remembering that his sudden cooperative spirit has coincided with the PLO ' s loss of funding from the Soviet_Union and from Persian_Gulf states when he sided with Iraq in the Gulf War . Time will tell if Arafat is truly deserving of the highest peace honor in the world . After all , other leaders in the Middle_East -- the late Israeli Prime_Minister Menachem Begin comes_to_mind -- were able to overcome the violent politics of their early years to eventually be regarded_as statesmen and even peacemakers . But that time has not yet come for Arafat .</TEXT>
