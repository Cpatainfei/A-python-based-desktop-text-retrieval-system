   <HEADLINE> MEN OF TEAL ; IN SAN JOSE , SHARKS KNOW THE WAY TO BRING_OUT TRUE COLORS IN FANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first note sounds , and the fans take their cue . Curving their hands into claws , fingers spread , one palm facing_up and the other down , they move as one body with 34 # 380 arms . To the ominous rumbling of the theme from &quot; Jaws , &quot; they drop their top hands_down and move their bottom hands up , creating a sea of snapping mouths ready to chomp anyone not wearing teal , black_and_white . Welcome to the Shark Tank . * Detroit fans have their octopus , thrown onto the ice before playoff_games since the days it took eight victories to win the Stanley Cup . Montreal fans have their glorious history and the ghosts who inhabit the Forum . San Jose Shark fans , with barely three seasons to look_back on -- not that they ' d want to remember the first two -- have a zeal for teal . &quot; This is a feeding frenzy , &quot; said Steven Stratton , a San Jose insurance_agent and financial adviser . &quot; I lived_in California and watched the Kings , but it was never like this . Having the Sharks come_to town , to the bedroom community of San Jose , it was really something I wanted to get_in on. &quot; This passion for the Sharks , built_on civic_pride and primed by clever marketing , is blossoming in San Jose . Signs advertising space for rent in office_buildings are printed in white on teal backgrounds . Prominent teal letters dominate a billboard on Santa Clara Street , near the new , $ 162.5-million San Jose Arena ( a.k.a the Tank ) . Along busy Almaden Boulevard , lines on the sidewalk marking the location of underground sewer_lines are painted in teal . The marquee outside the Holiday Inn flashes three messages : &quot; Welcome Democratic Century Club . Hello Cathedral of Faith . Go Sharks ! &quot; &quot; It ' s funny to see , and we appreciate it for_sure , &quot; said goaltender Arturs Irbe , the team ' s most popular player . &quot; We have to thank our organization for the colors and the logo , and we are proud people are wearing our logos and symbols. &quot; Wearing Shark colors has become more_than a fashion statement for the trendy . The Sharks reached the Stanley Cup playoffs this season for the first time , beating out the Kings and Mighty Ducks for the eighth Western Conference playoff spot . Their unlikely success -- they won 17 games their first season and only 11 last season -- has captured the fans ' hearts . &quot; The first two years , they suffered . We were kind of a joke around the league , &quot; forward Gaetan Duchesne said . &quot; But they kept coming and coming this year. &quot; They come_to the team store in a steady stream . Bonnie Conte , working the cash_register , can hardly keep_up with the demand for souvenirs . By 1 p.m. last Friday , she had run_out of bags , so buyers left with arms full of unwrapped goodies . Showing good taste -- and good credit_lines -- they ignored the $ 8 hockey_stick toothbrush holders to snatch piles of black T-shirts ( $ 22.95 each ) depicting an open-jawed Shark and the warning , &quot; First attack on the post-season. &quot; Those shirts are the top seller , along with a teal shirt with a Shark breaking_through a sheet of ice and the slogan , &quot; The playoffs used to be safe. &quot; Conte ' s earrings , tiny black Sharks piercing her lobes , were not for_sale . &quot; I ' ve been a fan since the beginning , and more so since I ' ve been at the store , &quot; she said . &quot; Everyone is a fan . The last few days have been really great . You can walk_out on the street and see people at bus_stops and business people coming_out of work wearing teal . That makes_it great for the players to show our support. &quot; Everyone wants to support the Sharks , though not everyone wants to pay_for the privilege . Last week , four men were arrested for breaking_into the arena . Their booty ? Not money . Not tickets . They pilfered shirts , pucks , key chains and a stuffed toy of S.J. Sharkie , the team mascot . Those who took the legal route to fandom had to act fast . The 3 # 300 tickets available for the first two playoff_games against the Detroit Red Wings were sold in 18 minutes . The 3 # 300 tickets for tonight ' s Game 5 vanished in 11 minutes . Barbra Streisand took 26 minutes to sell_out the place . * The Sharks asked fans to wear team colors to the home playoff opener , and about 95 % complied . &quot; Reveal your teal , &quot; was the theme , and they revealed it in jerseys with players ' names on the back , their names , or whimsical messages such_as &quot; Stanley 1 &quot; or &quot; Playov ' 94. &quot; They roared when the players skated onto the ice through the mouth of a huge , snarling shark , creating sound_waves that set decorative teal , white and black balloons bouncing . &quot; You get , what is it called , goose bumps ? &quot; said center Igor Larionov , a star of the great Soviet teams of the 1980s . Said right_wing Ulf Dahlen : &quot; When we ' ve been down in big_games , they ' ve gotten_behind us and lifted us . They might be number_one in the league. &quot; The Sharks were No . 1 among NHL teams in merchandise sales in their first season and third among all pro teams , behind the Chicago Bulls and the Raiders . According to Bernadette Mansur , NHL director of corporate communications , the Sharks retained their popularity this season despite competition from the relentlessly marketed Ducks . The Sharks touched_off a quantum leap in sales of NHL licensed merchandise from $ 100 million in 1989 to $ 800 million in 1992-93 . Sales are projected to reach $ 1.1 billion for the fiscal_year ending in June , a third of what the NBA and NFL ring_up but significant to the newly marketing-conscious NHL . &quot; Every expectation is ( the Sharks ) are going_to be one of the front-runners , if not the front-runner , &quot; Mansur said . &quot; Their penetration is deep on the West Coast , but the Sharks ' distribution is pretty much national. &quot; Make that international . Not long ago , in a photograph printed in newspapers around the world , Princess Diana of Wales posed with her sons during a ski trip . Prince William , second in_line to the throne of England , was wearing a Shark cap . &quot; Eight people sent me that picture , &quot; said Greg Jamison , the Sharks ' chief operating officer . &quot; That was obviously a very , very big thing. &quot; * In their first season , playing_at the dowdy Cow Palace in Daly City , the Sharks sold_out their 40 home_games . But they didn ' t merely take from the community : They established a program called Sharks and Parks , which provides street hockey equipment and instruction to local schools and recreation centers . By June , Jamison said , 30 # 000 kids will have been involved in the program . Jamison joined the Sharks last September after 13 years with the Indiana Pacers and Dallas Mavericks . His job is to ensure the Sharks succeed after the attraction of a new arena and a &quot; hot &quot; color fade , as it inevitably will . &quot; Sometimes things are novelties and wear_off quickly . Sometimes they take_hold , and we think this has taken_hold , &quot; Jamison said . &quot; The fact that it is San Jose ' s and Santa Clara County ' s ( team ) is a point of pride . Plus the fact that the arena is in the city , right downtown , lends itself to a strong sense of loyalty . &quot; It was tough winning only 11 games last year , so this year has been even more fun . I see people come_out for the first time and like it . As one person told me , he brought somebody to a game , showed him how the blue line works , explained offside , and that ' s all you really need. &quot; George Fraser knows hockey . He ' s a Detroit native -- &quot; I grew_up two blocks from Gordie Howe and I skated as a kid , &quot; he said -- and he ' s a Shark season ticket-holder . &quot; This is a town that is starved for a sports identity , &quot; said Fraser , an insurance executive . &quot; San Francisco has the Giants . Oakland has the A ' s . We have the Sharks now . This is big time. &quot; The players enjoy that this-is-our-team feeling . &quot; At the beginning when I came here , you could go_out and not be recognized . Now , everywhere you go at least one person recognizes you , &quot; Duchesne said . &quot; It ' s nice . You can see we made a difference here , and people are starting to really like hockey now. &quot; Said Jamison : &quot; We ' re looking_to bring not only good hockey , but a flair to the presentation . The NHL puts a good , strong product on the ice from an entertainment standpoint . We need to continue to entertain , but the entertainment is never meant to overshadow the product . Sports marketing sometimes gets_away from that . We want to enhance the product . We want people to say , ' I went_to watch the San Jose Sharks play a hockey_game . While I was there they gave_away this and that and I really had a good time. ' &quot; They have had good times and seen good hockey . The Sharks on Saturday rallied in the third_period for a 4-3 victory over the favored Red Wings , tying their playoff series at 2-2 . Irbe , who declared the fans ' ruckus Friday &quot; the loudest maybe in NHL history , ' revised that estimate Saturday and will probably have to revise it yet again tonight , at the Tank . &quot; I ' m really happy to play in front of this type of crowd , &quot; he said . &quot; I think they recognize us not only as a nice-looking team but as a good team. &quot;</TEXT>
