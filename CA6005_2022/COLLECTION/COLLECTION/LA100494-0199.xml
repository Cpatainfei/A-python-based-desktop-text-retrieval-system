   <HEADLINE> MAGMA POWER ADOPTS ' POISON_PILL ' STRATEGY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Geothermal energy producer Magma Power Co . on Monday took action to ward_off a hostile $ 840-million tender_offer from rival California Energy Co . of Omaha , adopting a &quot; poison_pill &quot; shareholder rights package and filing suit in a Nevada court to prohibit a merger with the unwelcome suitor . Magma Power ' s rights plan would trigger the issuance of so many new shares of stock to existing Magma Power shareholders that the stake of any hostile bidder would be hopelessly diluted , greatly increasing the cost of the merger , said a Wall_Street analyst who asked not to be identified . Magma Power said the rights plan is &quot; designed to guard against partial tender_offers , such_as that contemplated by California Energy , and other abusive tactics that might be used an attempt to gain control of the company without paying all stockholders a fair price for their shares. &quot; The lawsuit filed Monday in Nevada state court in Reno asks_for &quot; declaratory judgment &quot; prohibiting the tender_offer under Nevada law . Magma Power , which was incorporated in Nevada , still has &quot; not formulated a response , &quot; a company source said , to California Energy ' s tender_offer spelled_out in a Sept . 19 letter from California Energy Chairman David Sokol . A merger of Magma Power and California Energy would combine the two biggest companies in the geothermal industry .</TEXT>
