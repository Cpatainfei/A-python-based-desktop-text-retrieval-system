   <HEADLINE> THE NEW THREAT THAT MUST UNITE THE WORLD ; PLUTONIUM TERRORISM : INTERNATIONAL ACTION IS NEEDED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Plutonium , named for the ancient god of the mythic underworld , is becoming a commodity in the real international criminal underworld . A larger threat than this to international security is difficult to imagine . A highly radioactive element that did not so_much as exist before nuclear technology first produced it in the 1940s , plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known to science . One ten-thousandth of a gram , inhaled , can cause cancer . A few ounces in an urban water reservoir could cause hundreds of thousands of deaths . And plutonium-239 , an isotope of the element , is a key ingredient in nuclear bombs . Weapons-grade plutonium has hitherto been under the military_control of the world ' s few nuclear_powers . Nuclear non-proliferation has been a continuing theme in international relations not just because a nuclear attack anywhere would be a catastrophe but because of the terrorist potential of plutonium in civilian hands . The recent arrest in Germany of Spanish and Colombian civilians on charges of selling black-market plutonium apparently stolen somewhere in Russia suggests that the terror many have warned of may be becoming a reality . Russia has denied that the stolen plutonium comes from its military inventory , and the plutonium intercepted by German security is in fact of reactor-fuel grade rather than high-quality weapons-grade stuff . Unfortunately , a U.S. Department_of_Energy test recently confirmed that , properly handled , even reactor-grade plutonium can be used to make a bomb ; and for other terrorist purposes , reactor-grade plutonium is as lethal as weapons-grade . The arrests in Germany instantly became a major German-Russian incident . Washington has protested to Moscow . To date , incensed Russian denials have yielded to only tentative cooperation . All this is worrisome : Even in the chilliest Cold_War days , international civilian terrorism was one area in which East-West cooperation could usually be counted_on . Post-Cold War leaders must cooperate at least as well as Cold_War leaders did . There may have been a breakdown in security at nuclear_power plants in Russia and the other post-Soviet republics . Inventory_control even at military_installations may_not be all it could be . But these problems exist in some form wherever plutonium exists , and they must be addressed as common problems , not offenses by one nation against another . Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary recently confirmed that 6 # 000 pounds of plutonium was unaccounted for in U.S. inventories . And terrorist theft of plutonium from U.S. nuclear_power plants cannot be ruled_out . The German public has every reason to be particularly alarmed , but Americans have no reason for complacency . One of the plutonium smuggling suspects arrested in Germany is from Colombia . Islamic terrorist groups are increasingly active in Latin_America . The United States has a notoriously porous , resolutely unmilitarized southern border . Preventing the unthinkable from happening calls_for rethinking -- in a hurry -- the relations between crime fighting and national defense and between national and international security . Russia , this time -- and for its own sake above all -- has got_to be an ally rather than anyone ' s ancestral enemy . No nation stands to lose more_than Russia if the gods of the underworld make plutonium their drug of choice .</TEXT>
