   <HEADLINE> DEBATE OVER ABORTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I was delighted to see the inherent fallacy of the pro-abortion position finally exposed in the side-by-side articles May 17 . At one_and_the_same time we read a &quot; Path Cleared for Abortion_Pill Use &quot; and &quot; Assault Causing Miscarriage Can Be Murder Case. &quot; The very plain truth is that , as the California Supreme Court held , the fetus is a human life worthy of protection , and therefore the taking of its life ( by a third_party as opposed to by its own mother ) is a crime which may lead to a conviction of murder . California ' s tough fetal murder law places the abortion debate in a new and brilliant light : The fetus has rights . Ironically , a woman is free to abort her fetus while a third_party causing a miscarriage would be convicted of murder . The legal ( and moral ) issue has finally been clarified in the courts : In having an abortion a woman takes the life of_her_own unborn fetus in what would otherwise be considered an act of murder . Justice Stanley Mosk ' s dissent that this creature &quot; roughly the size of a peanut . . . ( whose ) appearance remains less than human &quot; is a very poor argument favoring abortion . Is a 1-month-old child &quot; less than human &quot; because it cannot walk , reason , communicate verbally or wear a size six shoe ? Its appearance is that of a baby -- but still a human life . In the same way the appearance of human life in the womb is that of a fetus . Happily , the court has determined that whatever one desires to call life in the womb -- a fetus , an embryo or an inconvenience -- it is a human life , for it cannot be otherwise . Now that this life has rights that protect it from an assault by a third_party , maybe we should consider the serious and deadly assaults upon this life by its mother and the RU-486 abortion_pill . THE REV . JEROME T . KARCHER St . Joachim Catholic_Church , Costa Mesa * No doubt you will receive many letters on the court decision regarding murder of a fetus . And many will comment on the juxtaposition of this news_item with the one about RU-486 , the abortion_pill . Pro-choice activists are worried that the court has cleared the way for restricting or even illegalizing abortion . Anti-choice proponents are cheering the court ' s decision , for the same reason . But both sides of the debate are missing the point . The key_words in the court ruling are &quot; third_party killing. &quot; The court decision is not about &quot; when life begins &quot; ; it is about the right to choose . A woman may choose to carry a fetus to term , or she may choose not to . This has been the law since the Roe vs . Wade decision of 1973 . Having made her choice , no other person has the right to take that choice away . Regarding the question of when life begins , it certainly doesn ' t begin at conception -- it merely continues . A woman creates eggs ; a man creates sperm . A woman who does not become pregnant ends a potential human life every month . A man ends millions of them every time he ejaculates . If a woman is pregnant , she may choose to have the fetus removed ( therapeutic_abortion ) . But if she chooses to carry the fetus to term , it is a crime for another person to commit an action which causes the fetus ' death ( spontaneous_abortion ) . The California Supreme Court has reaffirmed that it is the woman who has the right to choose . This is as it should be . JOEY CRAWFORD Los Angeles * Justice Mosk , in his &quot; lengthy and graphic &quot; dissent to the California Supreme Court decision concerning fetal murder , tried to describe the ugly non-humanity of the fetus in_order to buttress his position that a post-embryonic fetus is not a person . I think he utterly failed when he used the words &quot; creature , &quot; &quot; head , &quot; &quot; eye , &quot; &quot; nostril , &quot; &quot; feet , &quot; &quot; tail , &quot; &quot; hands &quot; in this description . Perhaps his point would have been_better made if he had meticulously avoided any mention of fetal anatomy and its relation_to adult human anatomy . Then again , perhaps not . DOUGLAS CAMPBELL Culver City * Regarding your editorial on RU-486 ( May 17 ) , I resent the statement , &quot; That opens the door for widespread use of this valuable but controversial drug in this country , &quot; used by you and others . It is not the drug that is controversial ; it has been shown to be highly effective . It is , in actuality , the very minor group of those who oppose it that are controversial , not RU-486 . SHELDON BROWN Sun Valley * The abortion_pill RU-486 , when declared safe by the Food and Drug Administration , will assist President Clinton in &quot; ending welfare as we know it. &quot; Although single mothers with dependent children will still need government aid provided by the AFDC program , the government will be able to refuse AFDC aid to indigent newcomers when RU-486 is approved by the FDA . Those who have demonstrated against the abortion clinics should have their workload substantially diminished when RU-486 cuts_down on the number of pregnant women seeking to terminate their pregnancies .
