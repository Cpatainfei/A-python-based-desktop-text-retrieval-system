   <HEADLINE> ON A ROLL ; ECONOMY : BUSINESSES ARE INVESTING WITH CONFIDENCE EVEN AS ECONOMISTS BEGIN TO WONDER IF THE EXPANSION IS NEARING ITS LIMITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sooner or later , the bell tolls for every recovery . And now , given the cooler tone to recent economic statistics , some experts have started to wonder : Is the nation ' s 40-month-old upturn -- middle-aged by historical standards -- quietly slipping past its prime ? &quot; We should see a decent end of the year , &quot; predicts David A . Levy , director of forecasting at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute in New York . &quot; I ' m a little more concerned about 1995. &quot; Yet oddly enough , a journey through the nation ' s economic landscape gives a different impression altogether . Companies are loading_up on high-tech equipment . Some are installing new assembly_lines for the first time in years . Corporate profits generally are strong . Confidence of consumers and executives remains solid . Businesses continue to hire , albeit selectively . It is an upbeat refrain heard from the operators of machine_shops in the Midwest , high-tech firms in Texas , hotels , banks , steel plants and some of the nation ' s largest retailers . Their message : The economic expansion still holds vast reserves of energy , even with the restraining effects of higher interest_rates . &quot; Businesses are looking_for loans to expand or modernize , and consumers keep borrowing money to buy cars and houses , &quot; says Bert Ely , a banking consultant in Alexandria , Va . California , of course , remains near the end of the line when it comes_to enjoying the full benefits of recovery . Nonetheless , the national economy &quot; has a head of steam , &quot; says Paul W . Boltz , chief economist at the T . Rowe Price investment_firm in Baltimore . &quot; You may_not feel it in every region of the country , but the economy as_a_whole has powerful momentum. &quot; For evidence of that momentum , look no further than the semiconductor industry . North_American chip sales for 1994 are expected to surge 26 % to $ 31.1 billion . Such ebullient growth is important to the economy , not only because chip sales now exceed steel in dollar value , but because semiconductors are a proxy for the performance of high-tech overall . They reflect demand for such products as cellular_phones , personal_computers , VCRs , even automobiles . &quot; I ' ve never quite seen it like this , &quot; says Paul Plansky , vice_president at HTE Research , a San Francisco semiconductor industry research company . &quot; Usually people say it won ' t last , but companies are operating plants 24 hours a day , and you don ' t see signs of a slowdown. &quot; Texas Instruments , which virtually invented the semiconductor , illustrates the blue-sky optimism : The Dallas firm recently completed its first new U.S. semiconductor fabrication line in 10 years . Now it ' s building a second . TI plans to plow an additional $ 1 billion into new plants and equipment this year , double the level of the late 1980s . Intel , meanwhile , is investing $ 2 billion , with new chip plants planned for Oregon and Arizona and new capacity in California . &quot; Everybody is positive , &quot; says Richard Clemmer , senior_vice_president at TI . &quot; We would n ' t be investing this kind of money if we weren ' t. &quot; The view from the nation ' s industrial heartland is also cheery . Steel_companies are reporting solid profits and building new plants for the first time in more_than a decade . In Pittsburgh , fledgling Worldclass Steel is investing $ 340 million in a new mini-mill on the site of a facility once owned by U.S. Steel . Demand for machine_tools continues to be strong as factories add new equipment to improve productivity and efficiency . Auto_makers , meanwhile , are enjoying their biggest boom since the mid-1980s . Sales of pickups , minivans and sport utility vehicles are so brisk that Detroit cannot make enough of them -- a bottleneck widely blamed for a summertime lull in sales . Late last month , Ford Motor Co . announced plans to hire 900 workers and invest $ 27 million to boost production of its popular F-Series pickup and Bronco sport utility vehicle in Wayne , Mich . Other auto_makers are also expanding capacity at their U.S. and Canadian plants . Such investment could pay_off at this stage of the economic cycle . Just reaching its life_expectancy -- 56 months for the average post-World War II recovery -- would give the current expansion more_than a year to go . And recoveries have been known to last much longer . The last one , which began in mid-1981 , survived 104 months . So auto industry executives have reason for their faith in the economy . A lower national unemployment_rate , restrained inflation and the prospect of an export rally next year all suggest the upturn has staying power . &quot; We see demand for trucks of all kinds continuing to grow , &quot; explains Bob Transou , Ford ' s vice_president of manufacturing . &quot; And we want to be ready for that. &quot; Nationally , those who believe the U.S. economy is starting to shift downward can cite recent data on factory orders , economic_growth last spring , consumer spending levels and orders for big-ticket items . On top of that , economists are puzzling over a mystery : Why did the nation ' s product inventories stack_up so dramatically on warehouse shelves between April and June ? The $ 56-billion increase in inventories accounted_for a stunning 63 % of national economic_growth in the second quarter . Just working all those excess goods through the system , before factories need to replace them , is expected to push growth_rates down to the range of 2 % to 2.5 % for the second_half of 1994 , compared to growth levels of 3.6 % for the first_half . ( The revised second-quarter figure is 3.8 % . ) Anecdotal evidence suggests that at least some of the inventory pileup was unplanned . Companies , it seems , overestimated the appetite of consumers after last year ' s lively Christmas season . &quot; They stockpiled inventory and fell_flat on their faces , because they didn ' t pay_attention to the facts of life , &quot; says Kurt Barnard , a New Jersey-based retail economist . &quot; The primary fact is consumers are still cautious. &quot; Overall , the picture is ambiguous . Inventories at the manufacturing level remain modest , a sign that the economy continues to chug along . &quot; This is the central issue in the debate over whether the economy is slowing_down dramatically or merely pausing , &quot; says Ross C . DeVol , an economist with the WEFA Group , a consulting_firm in suburban Philadelphia . &quot; We think it ' s a pause. &quot; For his part , Levy sees the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s anti-inflation policy -- demonstrated by its five interest_rate hikes this year -- as the greatest threat to the economy . Historically , he contends , &quot; the Fed keeps tightening until the economy gets_into trouble . They don ' t know when to stop. &quot; So far , the effect of higher rates has been largely muted , except for the housing market , where a rally has reached a plateau in recent months . Mortgage rates have climbed nearly two percentage_points in the past year . But those and other interest_rates remain at roughly half the levels of the early 1980s , and consumer spending has not slowed enough to frighten business . &quot; Thus far , the economy hasn ' t hurt us , &quot; says Bruce Nordstrom , co-chairman of the upscale retail firm that bears his family_name . Catalog sales , launched in January by the Seattle-based retailer , are 50 % higher than expected . Every Nordstrom store -- there are 77 in 14 states -- has enjoyed a sales increase in the past three months . What ' s more , Nordstrom , which just opened its 26th California store in Arcadia and another in Annapolis , Md. , also plans new outlets in White Plains , N.Y. ; Detroit ; Indianapolis ; Dallas , and Denver over the next two years . Broadly , retail economists foresee moderate sales gains for the balance of the year , perhaps in the range of 3 % to 5 % . &quot; Industrywide , we think there will be a slight upswing in sales , &quot; Bruce Nordstrom says . The outlook is positive elsewhere in the service sector , where the hotel business illustrates how economic wounds ultimately heal , even though the process may take years . Hotel construction has screeched to a halt from the mania of the late 1980s , except for low-frills , budget lodging -- a shift that has finally allowed demand for rooms to catch_up_with supply . And that &quot; creates a profitable business from one that might have been a loser in the early 1990s , &quot; says Mike Leven , president of Holiday Inn ' s Americas division . Hilton Hotel Corp. ' s U.S. occupancy_rate of 72 % , and Holiday Inns ' 63 % , both reflect steady rises from recent years , said company executives , who expect occupancy levels to move further upward next year . &quot; There is more business travel ; there is more leisure travel , &quot; says Hilton Chairman Barron Hilton . For many businesses , there also is more action at the middle rungs of the ladder , in contrast to the flashier 1980s . Casual restaurants -- such_as Chevys , Cheesecake Factory , Houstons and California Pizza Kitchen -- are the winners in this environment , taking business both from their pricier counterparts and fast-food rivals . Los Angeles-based California Pizza Kitchen , two-thirds owned by PepsiCo , has opened 19 restaurants in 1994 and plans to open 11 more this year . Corporate America ' s spending boom on new facilities and technology has fueled a 10 % increase in bank loans over the past eight months , according to C.J. Lawrence &amp; Co . in New York . Major business loans and personal_loans by commercial_banks have been rising steadily all summer . &quot; A lot of it has to do with renewed consumer confidence , &quot; says Susan Weeks , a Citibank spokeswoman . &quot; When people are nervous , they don ' t borrow much and they don ' t spend much. &quot; Just a_few years ago , giant Citibank was teetering on the brink of collapse , dragged_down by the recession and huge losses in its portfolio of commercial real_estate loans . Citicorp , the bank ' s holding company , lost $ 456 million in 1991 as it hobbled through a painful restructuring that included writing_off millions of dollars in bad loans and shutting_down offices throughout the country . By last year , however , the retooling process was largely complete , and the national recovery helped a slimmed-down Citibank earn $ 1.9 billion . This year ' s profit is expected to hit about $ 2.7 billion , analysts say . By 1995 , it could climb to $ 3.3 billion . &quot; Just about every area of our business is showing signs of improvement , &quot; Weeks said . Take credit_cards . In the first 90 days of this year , a staggering 700 # 000 people opened new credit_card accounts with Citibank , spurred by an aggressive marketing campaign . Rising home values have also been a boon for the company ' s home equity lending business -- especially in California , where home prices have finally started to rise after falling steadily since 1990 . &quot; A year ago , people would come_in and try to get a home equity loan , but we couldn ' t help them because values had dropped and they just didn ' t have any equity , &quot; said Eric Daniels , president of Citibank ' s California operations . &quot; Now that prices are going_up , people can borrow against their houses again . It ' s almost like we ' ve got a whole new source of profits that we really didn ' t have a year ago. &quot; But as virtually everybody senses , there are important differences between the current recovery and its predecessors . Business is expanding with extreme caution . Even as jobs increase in some areas , they are being whittled_down in others . And broad-scale consolidations -- like the past week ' s proposed Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger -- continue in the name of efficiency . Nowhere are these crosscurrents more obvious than in health_care , an industry that is reshaping itself almost independently of the sweeping reform legislation rattling around Congress . Increasingly , employers are steering their workers into health_maintenance_organizations and other forms of managed health_care that promise lower costs while restricting patients ' choice of doctors . The result has been a wave of mega-mergers : Drug makers American Cyanamid Co . and American Home Products agreed last month to join forces in a $ 9.7-billion deal ; in California , HMOs TakeCare Inc. and FHP International merged in June in a deal valued at $ 1 billion . The turmoil is creating challenges for firms that long have been all but immune from competition . With 6.6 million members , HMO pioneer Kaiser Permanente is the nation ' s largest HMO . But Kaiser is mounting its largest reorganization ever , following a systemwide enrollment decline last year -- the first drop_in half a century . ( Kaiser , with operations in 16 states , lost 70 # 000 members in California. ) The realignment has prompted the company ' s first major layoffs . Aiming to streamline its operations and reduce costs , Kaiser is scrutinizing most of its 26 # 000 jobs in Northern California ; more then 3 # 200 managers will have to reapply for new positions . Kaiser may also scrap plans to open nearly completed hospitals in Roseville and Fremont . So far , however , the upheaval hasn ' t reached Kaiser ' s bottom_line . The Oakland-based company reported a record profit of $ 848 million on revenue of $ 11.9 billion last year . For managed-care companies as_a_whole , near-term financial prospects are &quot; very strong , &quot; says David M . Lawrence , Kaiser ' s chairman and chief_executive . Interviews throughout U.S. industry suggest that such sentiments are widely shared . Add them all up and it explains why virtually all forecasters expect the economy to keep growing at least through next year . The most recent blue_chip survey of economists , a gauge of the profession ' s general outlook , found average forecasts of 3.6 % growth for 1994 and a more modest 2.7 % next year . &quot; We ' ve definitely not reached the peak of the cycle yet . The underlying fundamentals are still quite strong , &quot; says Joe Lavorgna , an economist with UBS Securities in New York . In the coming months , he adds , chances of a recession are &quot; slim to none. &quot; * Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Leslie Helm in Seattle ; Donald W .
