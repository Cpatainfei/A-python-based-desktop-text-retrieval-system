   <HEADLINE> JOB BIAS LAW NOT RETROACTIVE , JUSTICES RULE ; WORKPLACE : CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATES DENOUNCE THE SUPREME COURT DECISION , WHILE CORPORATE LAWYERS EXPRESS RELIEF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Supreme Court on Tuesday saved employers from potential liability in thousands of job discrimination cases , ruling that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 does not apply to bias that occurred before the law took_effect . In an 8-1 decision , they announced that the court will not apply the law retroactively unless Congress writes into the measure a precise provision extending it to pending lawsuits . Civil rights advocates denounced the ruling as a new blow to victims of workplace bias . Business lawyers said they are relieved that companies will not be forced to pay_for past mistakes . After a two-year fight with congressional Democrats , President George_Bush on Nov . 21 , 1991 , reluctantly signed the measure , which made_it easier for workers to prove they were victims of discrimination and , for the first time , gave women the right to damages in such cases . Bush stressed then that the law did not apply to thousands of pending claims . Democratic lawmakers , however , had wanted to apply the measure retroactively and had written such a rule into a 1990 version of the bill that was vetoed by Bush . The compromise version that finally became law said nothing definite about retroactivity , and in the end , the question was left to be resolved by the Supreme Court . On Tuesday , the justices said that only recent acts of discrimination are covered . &quot; The presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence , &quot; Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court . It might even be unconstitutional , he said , to impose new punitive-damage verdicts on employers for past discrimination . Only retiring Justice Harry A . Blackmun dissented , saying there is &quot; nothing unjust &quot; about forcing an employer to pay damages for discrimination that has been illegal for 30 years . The landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 first outlawed employer discrimination based on race , religion , sex or national origin . But generally , victims of such bias could win only reinstatement to their jobs and back pay . By the 1980s , this once-powerful weapon against job bias had begun to seem somewhat feeble . Women ' s rights advocates , for example , pointed_out that victims of on-the-job sexual_harassment could not win much except a judge ' s order calling_for a halt to the harassment . In 1989 , when congressional Democrats pushed for a new bill to counter high_court rulings that had made_it harder for workers to win discrimination cases , civil_rights advocates pressed for new damage remedies as well . The final bill gave employees the right to have jury trials and set an escalating scale for damages based on the size of a company or agency . At the top end , employers with more_than 500 workers can be forced to pay_up to $ 300 # 000 to each employee who has suffered from illegal discrimination . Though no precise figures were available , lawyers said that as_many as several thousand cases could have been reopened if the high_court had deemed the law to apply retroactively . Civil rights lawyers argued that a majority of Congress favored retroactive application . Tuesday ' s ruling decided the case of Barbara Landgraf , a Tyler , Tex. , woman who was sexually harassed by a co-worker at a film-processing plant in 1985 . She filed suit against her employer , and a judge agreed that she had been a victim of sexual_harassment . Nonetheless , he ruled_in May , 1991 , that she was not entitled to damages . In Landgraf vs . USI Film Products , the high_court affirmed that judgment , saying the law did not apply to offenses that took_place in 1985 .</TEXT>
