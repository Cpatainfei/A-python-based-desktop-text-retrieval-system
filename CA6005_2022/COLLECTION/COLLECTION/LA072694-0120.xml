   <TEXT> Edison Asks PUC to Throw Out Contracts : Southern California Edison Co . appealed_to the California Public_Utilities Commission to overturn the agency ' s requirement that Edison sign power contracts with a group of independent electricity producers . The independents , many of whom produce power from renewable sources such_as wind , geothermal and biomass , won a PUC-mandated auction just before the PUC announced its plan to introduce competition to the state ' s electric utility industry.The independents want the auction contracts signed , saying they are an example of such competition . Edison argues that it doesn ' t need more electricity , particularly if it faces increased competition . Edison ' s next step -- deemed &quot; a high likelihood if not a certainty &quot; by Don Fellows , Edison manager of non-utility power purchases -- will be to sue the PUC to stop the contract signing .</TEXT>
