   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING : PAELLA WITHOUT THE MEAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s an informal vegetarian menu , built around a substantial roasted vegetable paella . It begins with a zesty Greek salad of Kalamata olives , vegetables and feta cheese , spooned into the inner leaves from romaine hearts -- perfect finger_food to serve with drinks . For dessert , a soothing , delicate baked citrus custard , topped with a sprinkling of fresh raspberries or a warm caramel sauce . This entire menu can be made ahead , and all_the recipes are easily doubled or tripled . ( However , each recipe for paella must be roasted in its own pan so the vegetables have room to brown. ) If you are tempted to extend an invitation to friends who eat meat , this menu can be rounded_out with simply roasted herbed lamb or chicken , served with their pan juices . * This salad can be spooned into the leaves as a do-it-yourself finger_food or attractively arranged on a salad_plate where a knife and fork are more appropriate . The salad itself is_best made a day in_advance , except for the feta cheese and diced tomatoes , which are mixed in just before serving . This salad mixture would also be great in warm pita bread . GREEK OLIVE SALAD 3 / 4 cup small dice celery 3 / 4 cup Kalamata olives , pitted , flesh cut_into pieces 1 / 2 cup thinly sliced green_onions 1 / 4 cup small dice pimiento , well drained 1 / 3 cup small dice , peeled , seeded cucumber 2 tablespoons olive_oil 2 tablespoons fresh lemon_juice 1 tablespoon water 1 / 2 teaspoon dried oregano 1 / 2 teaspoon dried basil 1 / 2 cup small dice feta cheese 1 / 3 cup small dice seeded tomato 20 chilled medium romaine heart leaves In 1-quart bowl , combine celery , olives , green_onions , pimiento , cucumber , olive_oil , lemon_juice , water , oregano and basil . Toss to combine well . Refrigerate at least 4 hours or up_to 2 days . Let come_to room_temperature before using . Gently stir in cheese and tomato . Adjust seasonings and lemon to taste . To serve as appetizer , arrange lettuce leaves on platter . Put salad in small bowl to fit into middle of platter for guests to help themselves . Alternately , as salad , spoon salad mixture into lettuce leaves . Arrange on chilled salad_plates , dividing evenly . Also , romaine leaves can be thinly sliced crosswise , mounded on salad_plates , with salad mixture spooned over . Makes 4 servings .

This is an impressive vegetarian main_course that can be made in_advance . As with Asian fried_rice , this rice roasts better after it is chilled . These specific vegetables complement one another in_color as well as flavor , but you can vary vegetables as you wish ; just be sure to use about 14 cups of vegetables cut_into similarly sized chunks .
