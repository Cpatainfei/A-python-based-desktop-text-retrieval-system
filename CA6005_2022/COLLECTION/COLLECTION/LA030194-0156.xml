   <HEADLINE> 3 ALGERIAN POLICE_OFFICERS HIJACK JET , GIVE_UP IN SPAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three Algerian policemen hijacked a domestic_flight with 131 people aboard Monday and forced it to land in southern Spain . They surrendered hours later but were denied political asylum . It was unclear whether the hijackers were fleeing political violence in Algeria , where Muslim radicals have targeted soldiers , police , intellectuals and foreigners in a two-year campaign against the army-backed regime . The Air Algerie plane was en route from Oran , in western Algeria , to Annaba , near the Tunisian border , when the three forced the crew to divert the jet across the Mediterranean to the southern Spanish town of Alicante , authorities said . The Boeing 727 , carrying 124 passengers and seven crew_members , landed without seeking permission from air traffic controllers , and paramilitary Civil Guards surrounded it , authorities said . The hijackers carried handguns throughout the five-hour ordeal that was prolonged by language problems between Spanish negotiators and the Arabic- and French-speaking hijackers , said Alfonso Calve , civil governor of the Alicante region . Calve said the three policemen will remain in custody pending an investigation and will not be granted the political asylum they had requested .</TEXT>
