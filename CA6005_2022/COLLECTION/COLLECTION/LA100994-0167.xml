   <HEADLINE> THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE BEHIND PROPOSITION 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We are a nation of immigrants . Yet , there have always been Americans who resented newcomers . Nativism aimed at Catholics flour ished in the 19th Century ; hostility toward Asian-Americans and La tinos is widespread today . This traditional animosity toward newcomers is now aggravated by the existence of many immigrants here illegally . The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that 3.4 million illegal immigrants were in the United States in 1992 , 80 % of whom are in Texas , California and Florida . California alone is estimated to have 1.6 million . Illegal immigrants make a significant contribution to the economy , for they will do_work Americans don ' t want to do , often under harsh and unlawful conditions . But since they are eligible for some social_services , particularly health_care and education for their children , they also cost the state money . No one really knows whether , on balance , illegal immigrants benefit or drain our economy . Nonetheless , at a time when the standard_of_living is stagnant and public resources are scarce , taxpayers are outraged at spending any tax money for these unwelcome_guests . In California , the issue has moved_into the political_arena . Proposition 187 would take_away almost all_the social_services that illegal immigrants get , including child welfare , foster care , non-emergency health_care ( including prenatal services ) and public education for elementary , high-school and university_students . The purpose is to save money -- but also to make life so miserable for illegal immigrants that they will stop coming . The wisdom and effectiveness of the measure are open_to dispute . What is not disputable is that the cutoff of elementary and high-school education for the children of illegal immigrants is unconstitutional . A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving a similar Texas effort , Plyler vs . Doe , made that clear . And the backers of Proposition 187 know that . Alan C . Nelson , immigration commissioner from 1982-89 and a co-author of the initiative , said , &quot; It is meant to provoke court action . There ' s nothing new about getting decisions reversed when circumstances have changed , and in immigration terms , we are a world away from 1982. &quot; To some extent , Nelson is right . Changed circumstances can produce an occasional reversal , as in the overturn of the separate-but-equal doctrine in 1954 , in Brown vs . Board_of_Education . But such cases are extremely rare . And have circumstances truly changed since 1982 ? Not really . The facts and reasons for denying illegal immigrant children a public-school education that Texas presented to the court are the same as those put forth to justify Proposition 187 , and the court ' s response is no less valid today than it was then -- and just as likely . In the first place , the illegal-immigrant problem in California and elsewhere is not new . In 1986 , it led to passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act , which took years to hammer_out . Second , Texas claimed as much trouble from the presence of illegal immigrant children in the public_schools in 1982 as California does today . About 10 % of the pupils in Texas school districts bordering Mexico had been born in Mexico . The immigrant children often spoke little or no English and had serious educational problems . Their presence overcrowded schools already full . According to the Texas attorney_general , all this created financial strains and lowered the quality of education for the entire school_system -- especially for the children of the legal immigrants . &quot; Preservation of the state ' s resources for the education of its lawful residents and the elimination of an inducement for illegal immigration are sufficient basis for the statute , &quot; asserted the Texas attorney_general . The Supreme Court ' s response to this , in an opinion by Justice William J . Brennan Jr . for five members of the court , is as applicable now to California as it was then to Texas . While doubting that illegal immigrants come for a free education , impose a significant burden on the state ' s economy or degrade the overall quality of Texas education , the court ' s main reasons went_to the heart of the kind of country we are . The first is what the court called the &quot; fundamental conceptions of justice &quot; on which our system is based . Although parents who can comply with the law but enter unlawfully may be punished , &quot; the children . . . can affect neither their own conduct nor their own status . . . . ( Visiting condemnation on . . . an infant . . . is contrary to the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility or wrongdoing . . . . ( P ) enalizing ( them for ) a legal characteristic over which children can have little control . . . is an ineffectual -- as well as unjust -- way of deterring the parent. &quot; The second reason is the &quot; pivotal role of education in sustaining our political and cultural heritage , . . . ( its ) fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of our society. &quot; The inability to read and write imposes a &quot; lifelong penalty and stigma &quot; that &quot; denies the means to absorb the values and skills on which our social order rests. &quot; The result , as Justice Lewis F . Powell Jr . warned , is &quot; the creation of a subclass of illiterate_persons . . . adding_to the problems and costs . . . ( of ) unemployment , welfare and crime. &quot; Even the four dissenters , led by Chief_Justice Warren E . Burger , called the Texas statute &quot; senseless &quot; and agreed that &quot; creating . . . a permanent caste . . . of illegal Mexican residents ( was ) disturbing &quot; and probably more costly than educating them . They , nonetheless , could not find it unconstitutional . The backers of Proposition 187 know all this , for they can read Supreme Court decisions , too . The &quot; changed circumstance &quot; they may be relying_on is the markedly changed composition of the court since 1982 . Justices Brennan , Thurgood Marshall and Powell , in the majority on Plyler , have been succeeded by conservative justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony M . Kennedy . But a reversal is still unlikely . The key justice is likely to be Kennedy , and he has shown himself reluctant to overrule cases establishing rights , most notably in the 1992 abortion decision , Planned Parenthood vs . Casey . If the law becomes outdated , it should be changed . But the simple justice and sound policy that underlay Plyler vs . Doe are not outdated . The denial of basic education that Proposition 187 would produce today is as &quot; senseless &quot; and &quot; unjust &quot; as Texas ' denial was in 1982 -- and it is just as unconstitutional. *</TEXT>
