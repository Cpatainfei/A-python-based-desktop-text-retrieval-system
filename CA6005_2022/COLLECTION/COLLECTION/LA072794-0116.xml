   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA GETS ESTONIAN PLEDGE , WILL PULL TROOPS ON SCHEDULE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin agreed Tuesday to withdraw Russian troops on schedule from the tiny Baltic country of Estonia in exchange for Estonian guarantees of fair treatment for its retired Russian army_officers . The agreement , which Yeltsin said was reached with &quot; much difficulty , &quot; appeared to defuse a growing dispute that had overshadowed the recent Group of Seven summit in Naples , Italy , and threatened to damage U.S.-Russian relations . &quot; I think that this day is a turning point in the relations between Estonia and , in more general terms , the Baltic_states and the Russian Federation , &quot; Estonian President Lennart Meri told reporters after a meeting with Yeltsin that apparently lasted at least three hours longer than scheduled . The last 2 # 000 or so Russian troops , remnants of the Soviet_Union ' s occupation of the Baltic_states , were scheduled to leave Estonia by the end of August . But on July 10 , speaking after the Naples meeting with leaders of the world ' s seven richest industrial nations , Yeltsin suddenly balked , saying he would not guarantee the troops would leave on_time because of &quot; very crude human_rights violations &quot; in Estonia . He was referring to Estonian citizenship and pension laws that Russia says discriminate against residents who are not ethnic Estonians . Those laws , and others like them in several former Soviet republics , are especially sore points for Kremlin leaders concerned about the 25 million Russians who ended_up living &quot; abroad , &quot; outside Russia , when the Soviet_Union collapsed . In response to Yeltsin ' s foot-dragging , the U.S. Senate voted July 13 to suspend most aid to Russia unless it stuck_to its withdrawal deadline or reached another agreement with Estonia . Forty-four members of the House of Representatives also sent a letter of protest to Yeltsin on Friday , saying in part , &quot; No nation has the right to station troops on the territory of another without that country ' s explicit approval , and Russia has no right to set conditions for the removal of its troops from the sovereign republic of Estonia. &quot; The U.S. lawmakers ' moves prompted a rush of outrage from Russian diplomats and lawmakers at what they saw as U.S. meddling in Russian affairs . Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev categorically rejected linking economic aid to Russia with troop withdrawal from Estonia . Tuesday ' s agreement promised to lay the withdrawal issue to rest . The Itar-Tass news_agency made the Russian-Estonian quid_pro_quo quite clear . &quot; The Russian and Estonian presidents signed an agreement saying the rights of Russian military pensioners should be respected equally with those of Estonian citizens , &quot; Itar-Tass said , &quot; as well as an accord under which Russian troops are to be withdrawn from Estonian territory by Aug . 31 , 1994. &quot; The &quot; military pensioners &quot; referred to are about 9 # 000 retired Soviet army_officers who Estonians worry would probably support Moscow rather than Tallinn in case of a conflict . The agreement contains a clause allowing the Estonian government to deny citizenship to an officer who threatens national security -- such_as a longtime military intelligence_officer -- but procedures appear to guarantee that such a case would be an exception rather than the rule . Particulars aside , the pensioner issue was only the latest in a series of Russian-Baltic conflicts over the treatment of the hundreds of thousands of Russians , Ukrainians and other Slavs who settled in the region while it was under Soviet rule . Several troop withdrawal deadlines have been missed as Moscow used the delays as leverage in the dispute . Estonia , however , hotly denies any human_rights violations , saying that its citizenship and pension rules conform_to world practices .</TEXT>
