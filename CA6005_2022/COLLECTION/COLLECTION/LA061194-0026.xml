   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN ACTS TO PROVIDE HOMES AND COUNTER SCAMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin , adding a touch of populism Friday to his free-market reforms , announced steps to provide millions of Russians with new homes and to protect them from ruin by financiers promising fabulous returns on their savings . &quot; It is an impermissible situation whereby the majority of the population cannot afford to buy an apartment , &quot; he told a Kremlin news_conference . &quot; Every individual has to be given a chance. &quot; Under a flurry of presidential decrees , public housing projects stalled by lack of government funds will be auctioned_off to private investors to spur construction . The revenue will underwrite a broad program of credits , subsidies and vouchers to help Russians pay_for the new homes . More_than 10 million Russians are_on years-long waiting_lists for public housing . Many are waiting in communal apartments , hostels , army barracks , school buildings and shantytowns unfit for human habitation . Many young people live with parents long after growing_up and starting their own families . Yeltsin said that from now on , &quot; any young_person getting a job &quot; will immediately receive a credit to buy or build a home -- up_to 70 % of the cost . &quot; And then , as everywhere in the civilized world , he will have 30 years to repay. &quot; Such credit possibilities are untested on a large scale in Russia , 2 1 / 2 years into Yeltsin ' s post-Communist reforms , so the program will be government supervised . If it works , officials say , the construction boom could fuel a recovery of the slumping economy . Relatively few in Russia have benefited so far from the reforms , under which the government has freed prices and sold_off most state-owned enterprises . Yeltsin admitted Friday that nearly half of all Russians now live near or below the poverty_line . But looking_back on the last year -- in which he disbanded the hostile Supreme Soviet , crushed its armed defenders with a tank assault , won voter approval of a new constitution and oversaw the election of a new , somewhat less hostile Parliament -- he claimed to have achieved political stability . &quot; A new political reality has been formed in this country , &quot; Yeltsin said . &quot; The principle ' All power to the soviets ' has become invalid . . . . We now have an opportunity to focus our efforts on creative activities , on alleviating economic and everyday problems of common people. &quot; Besides the housing shortage , Yeltsin complained about the proliferation of unregulated investment funds , quasi-banks and joint stock_companies that promote get-rich-quick schemes on the airwaves , ad pages , billboards and telephone_lines . Officials say the number of scam victims is easily in the hundreds of thousands , and their losses run to the tens of millions of dollars . Yeltsin signed a decree imposing a truth-in-advertising ethic on such investment_companies , under pain of losing their licenses . From now on , the firms must disclose the size of dividends paid during the previous year and refrain_from making claims about future profitability . &quot; You can promise the public only what you have in reality , &quot; Yeltsin warned . Yeltsin ' s wide-ranging news_conference was held_on the eve of a three-day holiday marking Russia ' s 1990 declaration_of_independence from the Soviet_Union . It also marks the end of his third year through a five-year presidential_term . The 63-year-old leader looked fit and feisty . He predicted that the country ' s long industrial recession will hit bottom next month . He said he will travel_to the Greek island of Corfu to sign a partnership with the European Union if an agreement is reached before the June 24-25 meeting . Under the proposed deal , European_nations would phase_out quotas on many Russian exports and replace them with tariffs . To meet one of Europe ' s conditions , Yeltsin signed a decree Friday allowing foreign banks gradual entry into the Russian market . The measure lifts a restriction he imposed last November at the request of Russian bankers that said foreign banks operating in Russia could serve only foreigners .</TEXT>
