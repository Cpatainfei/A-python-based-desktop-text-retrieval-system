   <HEADLINE> CLOUDS , WIND FORCE A SECOND DELAY FOR SHUTTLE ENDEAVOUR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Clouds and wind forced NASA to delay the planned launch Friday of the space shuttle Endeavour on its mission to study the Earth . It was the second launch delay this week . Liftoff for the Earth radar-mapping mission was rescheduled for 4:05 a.m. PDT today , with better weather in the forecast . NASA halted the countdown and waited for nearly three hours in hopes low clouds_over the launch site would break_up . When they did , a crosswind exceeded safety limits , a minor communications problem popped_up and launch director Bob Sieck called it quits . By then , the six astronauts had been strapped inside the fueled ship for more_than five hours , slightly longer than desired . They left the shuttle at late morning , sipping bottled water and shaking hands with technicians . NASA then drained more_than a half-million gallons of fuel from Endeavour ' s tank . The delay cost nearly $ 500 # 000 for the fuel alone . Earlier in the week , NASA had delayed the launch from Thursday to Friday to check Endeavour ' s engine oxidizer pumps for a defect discovered elsewhere in the fleet . The pumps checked_out fine . Friday ' s scrub delayed another NASA launch . The flight of an unmanned Atlas rocket with a crucial weather_satellite was moved from Tuesday to Wednesday as a result of the need for today ' s launch attempt for Endeavour . The military has reserved time in between for a classified operation . The Cape Canaveral Air_Force Station , which tracks ascending rockets for safety purposes , needs two days between launch attempts to reprogram computers . Once the nine-day shuttle flight begins , $ 366-million radar equipment will map Earth ' s surface . NASA says it is the finest space radar ever designed for environmental research , an advancement akin to color pictures versus black-and-white . The radar will scan Earth ' s surface and the astronauts will photograph the same scenes 138 miles below for comparison . About 2 # 000 researchers , teachers and students at sites around the globe will help to verify the radar ' s accuracy . NASA plans to fly the radar instruments on Endeavour again in August to see how the sites look in a different season .</TEXT>
