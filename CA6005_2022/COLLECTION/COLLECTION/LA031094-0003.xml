   <TEXT> Deconstructed mysteries : OK , so it wasn ' t the toughest pop_quiz . We asked readers to identify a photo in Tuesday ' s column and we received 194 faxed replies -- 195 if you include the misaddressed one from a Venice business regarding a customer ' s deposit . Thirty-two guesses were incorrect ( and , remember , we count_off double for incorrect guesses ) , including : the Spruce Goose airplane ( eight votes ) , a gold dredge , the abortive Port Disney resort , a Venetian_blind , the Hubble telescope , Redondo Pier after a big storm , Angel ' s Flight , an orbiting billboard and Santa Monica ' s Gateway to Malibu . The winning entry -- a 5:36 a.m. fax -- came from Don Spivack of L.A. , who said it was a model of &quot; the proposed ' Clouds of Steel ' monument , which was to be built over the Hollywood Freeway. &quot; After consulting our judges -- the people who sit closest to us -- we accepted that as close enough to &quot; Steel Cloud. &quot; Also known as the &quot; West Coast Gateway Monument , &quot; the deconstructionist work was , you ' ll recall , touted as L.A. ' s own Statue_of_Liberty . Due_to its cost -- an estimated $ 33 million -- it was non-constructed . Anyway , we ' re shipping Spivack a product titled &quot; Actual Los Angeles Freeway Rubble , &quot; which somewhat resembles the would-be landmark . * Steel clawed : The absence of the freeway monument hasn ' t made the hearts of readers grow fonder , incidentally . Of those who commented on the design , 48 had negative comments while three were positive . A sampling of the reviews : * &quot; It looks better if you stand it on end. &quot; ( Lance Richter ) * &quot; Even the recession has a silver lining. &quot; ( R . Douglas Collins ) * &quot; If it had been built , the problem of illegal ( and legal , for that matter ) immigration would have been solved . After all , would you want that to be the first thing you saw in the U.S. ? &quot; ( Norman Gotwetter ) * &quot; Yuk ! &quot; ( Mary Caciola ) * &quot; I love it . Sorry we ' ll never see it. &quot; ( Caroline Labiner Moser ) * &quot; I think I saw it in a junkyard in Carson. &quot; ( Glenn Barrow ) And , finally , Rick Bowersox was not surprised that the &quot; Steel Cloud &quot; never got_off_the_ground . * &quot; Even Bakersfield got_rid_of ' Sun-Fun-Stay-Play. ' &quot; Another needed improvement in spelling : Stan Dyer found a sign_in West L.A. that bore a name remarkably similar to that of a City_Council member . * Pre-shocks : Here ' s another earthquake clue we missed . &quot; Did anyone notice the irony of the ( Team Rideshare ) TV ad ? ( that ran before the earthquake ) , &quot; writes Jeff Simpson of La Canada . &quot; It showed the people walking slowly in a dreary mood on the 10 freeway with Downtown in the distance . It then cut_to the same people doubling_up in car-pool fashion , whistling , ' Hi ho , hi ho . . . . ' I thought it was rather amusing , since that ' s the only way we can traverse the nation ' s busiest freeway now. &quot; miscelLAny : Actor Jack Nicholson , who was recently charged in a golf_club attack on another motorist ' s car , made his directing debut in the film , &quot; Drive He Said. &quot;</TEXT>
