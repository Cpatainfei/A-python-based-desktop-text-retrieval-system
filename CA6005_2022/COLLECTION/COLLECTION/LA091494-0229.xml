   <HEADLINE> STORM BREWS OVER PROSPECT OF RECYCLED WATER IN BEER ; SEWAGE : MILLER CO . IN IRWINDALE IS SUING TO HALT $ 25-MILLION PROJECT . DISTRICT DISMISSES CONCERNS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From &quot; the land of sky-blue waters &quot; to &quot; pure , Rocky Mountain spring_water , &quot; the imagery of pristine lakes and streams has helped sell American beer for decades . So , what is a brewer to do when it finds_out some of the water it uses to make beer is going_to come from the sewer ? If the beermeister is Miller Brewing Co. , the nation ' s second-largest brewer , the answer is not to go_with the flow . Late last week , Miller filed a lawsuit to stop one of the region ' s most ambitious water reclamation projects , a $ 25-million plan by San Gabriel Valley water authorities to make drinking_water out of effluent . &quot; The project will irreversibly pollute the basin , &quot; the suit charges . The treated water will contain a host of contaminants -- from harmful bacteria to industrial chemicals with the &quot; only question being how disastrous the contamination will be , &quot; it says . Like many areas of Southern California , the San Gabriel Valley is trying to reduce its dependence on dwindling and increasingly costly water imported from Northern California and the Colorado_River . Last month , the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District , which serves about 1 million people , voted to move ahead with plans for a nine-mile pipeline that would transport reclaimed drinking_water from a sewage treatment plant in Whittier to land near Miller ' s Irwindale brewery . From there , the treated water would trickle down into the valley ' s underground water_supply to replenish it . Besides reducing the valley ' s dependence on imported water by one-quarter to one-third , the project would capture some of the 50 million gallons of potable waste water now being flushed into the ocean every day from local sewage treatment plants , said Robert Berlien , general_manager of the water district . State and local officials insist that the project is no different from other reclamation efforts that have safely supplied recycled drinking_water from sewage treatment plants to millions of people in about 50 Los Angeles and Orange County communities for more_than 30 years . Miller , the officials say , is suing to protect the company from bad publicity . &quot; Made from sewer_water &quot; is not the sort of slogan you sell beer with , Berlien said . But the lawsuit , he said , will only generate more unwanted publicity for the brewer . Miller ' s lawyers insist that they are trying to protect the valley ' s principal water source -- the San Gabriel aquifer -- which would receive the treated waste water . &quot; This is not a public relations thing , &quot; Los Angeles attorney Terry Kelly said . &quot; If you are making a food_product you want to make_sure that the ingredients are pure . Nor do we think that people ought to be drinking from a water source that ' s getting a daily dose of effluent. &quot; Ironically , the San Gabriel aquifer is already so polluted that it has been a national Superfund site for 10 years because of high concentrations of volatile organic_compounds , which come from agricultural runoff and industrial dumping and can break_down into human carcinogens . Even so , Kelly said , the brewery has never detected any chemical contamination in its water although its wells are close to one of several plumes , or heavy concentrations , of contamination in the aquifer . &quot; It is extremely pure water that comes_out of those wells , &quot; Kelly said . Miller ' s Irwindale plant , one of seven operated by the company nationwide , employs 850 people and draws about 860 million gallons of water each year to produce more_than 5 million gallons of beer . The lawsuit acknowledges that some Southern Californians have been drinking recycled waste water for years , but contends that &quot; scientific data leaves it unclear whether or not that use has harmed the health of local residents. &quot; The suit invokes an Orange County study of treated waste water that found &quot; high levels &quot; of the bacteria that causes Legionnaire ' s disease . Water officials respond by saying treated waste water from the same Whittier plant that would supply the San Gabriel Valley has been flowing to homes_in 43 Los Angeles County communities since the 1960s . For more_than a decade , plant personnel have conducted monthly tests for viruses . In 761 samples , the testing turned_up one virus , &quot; the same you would find in regular old rainwater and even less than you might find in Colorado_River water because of the tourists and other pollutants &quot; affecting it , said Earle Hartling , the Whittier plant ' s water recycling coordinator . Hartling and Berlien also cite a 1984 study by UCLA ' s School of Public Health that found no evidence of health_problems among residents drinking reclaimed water . &quot; If the planned operation follows the treatment requirements that we ' ve put forth and is consistent with existing operations , there should be little to no risk at all , &quot; said David Spath , chief of the technical programs branch of the drinking_water division of the state_Department of Health Services . Spath said the Orange County study that found legionella bacteria in treated water was inconclusive . &quot; It ' s not clear whether those organisms were alive and viable or whether their number was any greater than what is found in ordinary drinking_water , &quot; he said . The proposed San Gabriel water recycling project is actually a five-step operation . Initially , solid waste is removed through sedimentation and then aeration . Next , the water is filtered through sand and charcoal , then chlorinated . But the most important step_in the process , say many experts , occurs later , after the chlorinated water leaves the treatment plant and is piped onto the ground . There , percolation through the soil is supposed to filter_out any remaining contaminants before the water reaches the aquifer . &quot; Chlorination doesn ' t get everything . But chlorination and ( percolation ) usually work pretty well in tandem , &quot; said Scott Summers , an associate_professor of environmental engineering at the University of Cincinnati who specializes in drinking-water treatment . The Miller lawsuit argues that the ground near the brewery is too porous to allow natural filtration before the water reaches the aquifer . Water officials disagree , insisting that the water will be in the ground for at least six months -- the minimum time prescribed by state regulations . Even if the beer company were not suing , it would take two years to build the pipeline and bring the recycled waste water to Irwindale . The bad jokes , however , have already started flowing . &quot; The beer aged in porcelain , that sort of thing , &quot; Berlien chuckled .
