   <TEXT> Elite French police units raided homes and buildings near Paris and other cities Tuesday , uncovering a large cache of arms and explosives and arresting 95 people suspected of operating a support network for Islamic guerrillas in Algeria . The police sweeps , the largest since authorities began cracking_down on Islamic fundamentalists here a year ago , gave credence to repeated government warnings that French soil is being used to give logistic_support to guerrilla groups in the former French colony . It also was sure to fuel anti-Islamic feelings in France , home to 5 million Muslims , and increase scrutiny of foreigners and French citizens from North Africa . &quot; This shows clearly that there are fundamentalists strongly determined to develop terrorist actions and clandestine activities from our territory and from other European_countries , &quot; said French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua . It also showed , he told reporters , &quot; that they have the means , including false identities , to move_around in Europe . And it implicates French citizens of Algerian origin in these activities. &quot; The raids , involving more_than 300 police_officers , were ordered by France ' s top terrorist prosecutor , Jean-Louis Bruguiere . The authorities focused their attention on immigrant areas around Paris and other major cities . An array of weapons , from automatic_pistols and assault_rifles to hand_grenades , was uncovered at several sites . Pasqua said investigators also found evidence of links between the_French network and supporters in Canada , Britain , Germany , Italy and the_Netherlands . Among those arrested was Mourad Adou , 24 , described by authorities as a key leader of the Armed Islamic Group , which is believed to be responsible_for sabotage attacks and assassinations of foreigners , journalists and intellectuals in Algeria . In the past year , 23 French citizens have been killed in Algeria . The Armed Islamic Group has thus far refused to join talks between the military government in Algeria and more moderate Islamic fundamentalists . An estimated 11 # 000 people have died in Algeria since Islamic radicals took_up arms after the January , 1992 , elections , which were canceled by the government when the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front appeared to be winning . In August , French police arrested more_than 20 North Africans , eventually deporting them to Burkina Faso in West Africa . The conservative French government also has expelled some Islamic clergymen .</TEXT>
