   <HEADLINE> MARKET SCENE ; STOCKS AS A CONTACT_SPORT ; BOMBAY ' S BUSY MARKET IS NICKNAMED ' THE RING. ' BUT THE BOISTEROUS TRADE WILL SOON GIVE_WAY TO THE COMPUTER AGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The warning_bell has sounded jarringly , signaling just 15 minutes left in the trading day , and a swarm of traders have Darnesh , one of the Bombay Stock_Exchange ' s brightest whiz kids , pinned against a pillar . They roughly grab the shrimpish 25-year-old ' s earlobes or the flesh of his cheeks or neck to get his undivided attention , then shout questions at him to try to close a final deal . &quot; He can give five quotes in a single second , &quot; said an admiring BSE official , eyeing the crush around the young black-haired Gujarati . &quot; Three hundred and seventy-five companies he can give quotes for ! &quot; If capitalism is a jungle , as somebody said , then it doesn ' t get any wilder -- or noisier -- than on the floor of the Bombay Stock_Exchange . Suitably named , as in other contact_sports , the floor is called &quot; The Ring. &quot; For two hours each business day , from noon to 2 p.m. , amid stagnant air , raucous noise and the grayish light let_in by a dome that looks_like an inverted version of New York ' s Guggenheim Museum , any number of 4 # 200 brokers ' agents converge to shout their readiness to buy and sell . Some of India ' s great fortunes have been made in the Brueghelian tumult of what is proudly said to be Asia ' s oldest stock_exchange , where 3 # 500 companies are now listed . Some scams have been just as lucrative . &quot; Speculation is central to a stock_exchange . People come here to trade_in risk , &quot; said the exchange ' s executive_director , Arvind N . Kolhatkar . There are no fights though , broker Kanti V . Dand wants it made clear . As in a demonic dance , some of the traders -- most of whom are young Gujarati men , natives of an Indian state famed for its business acumen -- circulate , while others keep assigned spots on the floor . Dealers in the &quot; A &quot; group -- 88 blue-chip Indian companies whose trading volumes are high -- have special places . In blue jackets , assigned the role of incorruptible guardian_angels , members of the Quotation Service hover , ready to jot_down a buy or sell order as a guarantee that the terms of a deal will be respected by both parties . A few old_men hobble by on canes , enjoying the hubbub and the vicarious thrill . &quot; They have worked here and don ' t know anything else , &quot; Suresh More , a young officer in the Quotation Service , explained . &quot; They come here because they feel they are in their own house. &quot; They won ' t feel that way for long , it seems . Like the mechanical adding machine , the rotary dial_telephone and other outdated relics of the business world , the days of BSE trading as a contact_sport are numbered , if Kolhatkar and the rest of the leadership are able to implement their plans . By October , the exchange housed in a futuristic building on Bombay ' s Dalal Street plans to introduce electronic-screen-based trading , which means the firm Darnesh works for will be able to trade with other brokerages via computer terminal and will not need to meet their representatives in_the_flesh . &quot; When we go screen-based , this physical process will be eliminated , &quot; Kolhatkar promised . Members of the powerful old_guard in Bombay financial circles resisted change at the BSE for years , but India ' s economic reforms , tougher government regulations , the threat of competition and an upsurge in business fueled by a wave of foreign investment have left them little choice but to evolve . The problem is that the time-honored way of doing things on Dalal Street has left brokerages gagging on paperwork . At Parag Parikh Financial Advisory Services Ltd. , the eponymous chairman surveyed a desk piled high with the seven-inch squares that constitute shares of Tata Iron &amp; Steel Co . ( TISCO ) stock and the long forms that accompany each transaction . All that paper represents stock purchases worth about $ 66 # 000 , he said . &quot; In the United States , I don ' t think that stockbrokers ever see a share of stock , &quot; Parikh said . &quot; Here , high volume gives me no advantage . It just means more paper to process. &quot; Until that system is modernized , each share transfer form must be signed by seller and purchaser ; the seller ' s signature must be authenticated , and tax stamps worth five rupees , or about 15 cents , must be affixed to the form for every 1 # 000 rupees , or $ 30 worth , of stock traded . Since TISCO shares are issued in denominations of 50 , a purchase of 1 # 000 shares generates 20 stock_certificates and share transfer forms , each of which must be dated , filled_out , signed and stamped . The process can take months . The hassle of dealing with such chores has limited the capacity of banks and brokerages to accept investor money . When the chairman fell ill at the Bank of Hong Kong here , his office was taken_over by clerks so they could stick stamps on transfer forms . Screen-based dealing and a central depository for paperwork should greatly streamline the trading process , Kolhatkar , the Bombay Stock_Exchange executive , predicted during an interview in his 25th floor office overlooking the still-growing business_district of Bombay . His plan is to connect stock brokerages throughout the city via microwave transmitter . Screen-based trading , which began in 1971 in the United States , is already the rule at two-thirds of the world ' s markets , he noted . &quot; Due_to the fact India was so_much an insular country , trading practices never improved here , &quot; Kolhatkar said . &quot; But there ' s one good thing about Indians . They resist change as long as they can -- but when they have to adapt , they change fast. &quot; Competition is one reason . Two years ago , when the Indian government was stunned by a securities scam involving BSE investments that led to losses estimated at more_than $ 420 million , a plan was floated for a new exchange free_of Bombay ' s notorious wheeler-dealers . The National Stock_Exchange is supposed to open at another Bombay locale -- with state-of-the-art screen trading , speedy settlements and completely open transactions -- in phases , beginning with trading in wholesale debt this month . Some members say next year is more likely . &quot; I would consider it as solving the problems of the Bombay Stock_Exchange , and also competing with them so the customer gets_the_best services , &quot; said Parikh , a charter_member . &quot; It ' ll be survival of the fittest. &quot; Sensing a change in the wind , even Bombay ' s old_guard brokers , who have run the BSE for decades on terms profitable for themselves , are signing_up to join the new market . Since last year , about $ 1.5 billion in foreign investment , much of it American , has poured into the BSE , which has a total market capitalization in the neighborhood of $ 140 billion . For the moment , Indian law allows only registered foreign financial_institutions to invest . In December alone , the infusion of foreign cash topped $ 400 million . By April , however , the inflow had dried_up to $ 4 million in a typical week , in large part , analysts here said , because the rise in U.S. interest_rates gave outside investors other attractive options . In large part because of the drop_in overseas demand , the BSE index is off about 14 % since the year ' s start . Another body blow for brokers came when the watchdog Securities and Exchange Board of India , effective March 12 , banned a practice called &quot; forward trading. &quot; That meant buying on the margin using money loaned at interest_rates higher than those charged by banks . The practice allowed speculators to roll_over stock purchases for months . After watchdog agency ' s ukase , trading collapsed by 80 % . Despite Kolhatkar ' s sunny predictions about the advent this autumn of screen-based trading , some brokers doubt the ability of the BSE to swiftly introduce a central depository system to centralize paperwork , which they say is essential for Western-style stock_market transactions . The old_men may feel at_home in &quot; The Ring &quot; for a little while longer . In any event , predictions are widespread that trading will pick_up again in the summer . In the long term , Kolhatkar , a former civil_servant , is bullish . &quot; We ' re still just scratching the surface , &quot; he said . &quot; There are only 25 million shareholders in India . Our population today is around 900 million . There is room for expansion. &quot;</TEXT>
