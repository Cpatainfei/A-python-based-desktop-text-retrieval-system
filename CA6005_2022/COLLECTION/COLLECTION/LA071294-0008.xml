   <TEXT> It ' s too_bad John J . Pitney Jr . didn ' t do his homework before writing &quot; Left ' s Muddled Assault on the Religious Right &quot; ( Column Right , June 30 ) . He cites an ACLU warning against the conservative &quot; Christian &quot; school_board in Vista as an attack on the religious right . I ' m here to tell you it ' s not the ACLU who is doing the attacking in Vista . Since coming_to power , the conservative board majority has begun an assault on anyone who does not share their narrow religious views . They actively campaigned for the voucher initiative , which would have given public money to religious_schools . They forbade the school district to apply for a grant which would have helped poor children receive medical services . They tried to place &quot; creation_science &quot; into the curriculum . They have placed &quot; Sex Respect , &quot; an antiquated and most likely illegal program , into the sex education curriculum . They axed bus_services affecting less affluent areas of town , while building a new school in an affluent area which will house only 180 students . It remains to be seen whether the political agenda of the religious right reflects the true spirit of Christianity , but I have my doubts . Meanwhile , anyone who disagrees_with them is labeled godless . This kind of religious intimidation serves no one , and it needs to be stopped .
