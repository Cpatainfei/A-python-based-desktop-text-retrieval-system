   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; 400 DEAD FISH REMOVED FROM SANTA CLARA RIVER ; OIL SPILL : AN ENDANGERED STICKLEBACK IS AMONG THE CARP AND CHUBS KILLED AFTER EARTHQUAKE CAUSED PIPE- LINE TO RUPTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wildlife authorities have scooped_up nearly 400 dead fish floating along a 12- to 15-mile stretch of the Santa Clara River east of Piru that was blackened when an oil_pipeline ruptured , officials said Friday . One of the dead fish picked_out of the river was an endangered species known as the unarmored three-spined_stickleback . Most of the others were common chubs or carp . Crews working to rescue wildlife and clean_up the spill caused by Monday ' s earthquake also recovered 11 oiled waterfowl and saw an oiled egret that they could not capture . Seven of the birds recovered were dead , including a pair of mallards , a northern_shrike and a rail . Workers found no least Bell ' s vireos , an endangered songbird that nests in the area . &quot; I think this demonstrates once again the problems with putting pipelines near riverbeds and sensitive areas , &quot; said Ron Bottorff , director of the Friends of the Santa Clara River . &quot; People worry about tankers , but the problems lately have occurred with pipelines. &quot; Bottorff pointed_out that a 1991 oil spill occurred in the same stretch of the Santa Clara River and another spill discovered on Christmas_Day at McGrath Lake , a wetlands area near McGrath State Beach near Oxnard . Authorities do not yet know whether the fish and wildlife were killed by the oil or by chlorine , which was added_to treated waste water discharged into the river by the Valencia sewage treatment plant . The plant is operated by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts . Like many other treatment plants , the Valencia plant routinely removes chlorine to protect fish before waste water is discharged . But after Monday ' s quake , plant officials decided to leave in the chlorine to protect human health and safety in case the waste water contained bacteria . Plant officials said their system to remove the chlorine also may have been damaged . They reactivated the system and began removing the chlorine again at 2 p.m. Thursday . Heal the Bay , an environmental watchdog organization based in Santa Monica , along with the Friends of the Santa Clara River in Ventura County , on Friday denounced the use of chlorine in the waste water . * Mark Gold , executive_director of Heal the Bay , contacted the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office , which will determine next week whether an investigation is warranted , a spokeswoman said . Meanwhile , a crew of about 350 people continued to remove the thick crude . By Friday , workers had vacuumed up about 71 # 000 gallons of the 147 # 000 to 168 # 000 gallons of oil that spilled , said Albert Greenstein , a spokesman for Atlantic Richfield , parent company of Four Corners Pipeline . He said workers will continue throughout the weekend , unless rain forces them to stop .</TEXT>
