   <HEADLINE> FAKE QUAKE TO HELP PINPOINT NEEDED ROYCE HALL REPAIRS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time in its 65 years as UCLA ' s showplace auditorium , people are hoping that the latest Royce Hall production does not bring_down the house . This one is no classical_ballet or New Age jazz concert or high-brow stage show , however . It ' s a mock magnitude 4 earthquake designed to show structural engineers where emergency seismic repairs and retrofitting are needed most at the Romanesque performance hall . Engineers on Friday installed a one-of-a-kind shaking machine inside the heavily damaged building in hopes of causing the brick-and-concrete structure to vibrate enough to show which walls and floors will be most vulnerable in future earthquakes . A series of accelerometers and seismometers placed throughout the massive building will register its movement as a 10-foot spinner rotates at speeds of up_to four revolutions per second . Officials say they will carefully control the shaking to prevent further damage to the ornate , 1 # 850-seat auditorium or its six-story towers that form the architectural symbol of the Westwood campus . &quot; This will be a reality check on a computer model that has been done to predict how the building will perform in an earthquake , &quot; said Gary Hart , a civil_engineering professor who designed the $ 70 # 000 shaking machine six years ago . A retrofitting and repair plan is being drawn_up by Los Angeles structural engineer John Martin Jr . Although an emergency shoring of the towers has begun , major reconstruction is not expected to begin until the fall . Hart ' s machine , which resembles a huge , one-bladed fan , produces 20 # 000 pounds of centrifugal_force when a 7 1 / 2-horsepower electric_motor sets it spinning . About a ton of weights can be added_to the blade to create shaking levels up_to that of a magnitude 5 quake . The effect is similar to that of a washing machine on spin cycle that is improperly loaded with soggy clothing and out of balance . Officials decided to conduct the Royce Hall shaking test after structural engineers praised the value of Hart ' s machine in determining seismic strengthening needed for Los Angeles City_Hall . It was used in secret tests a year ago to verify a computer-generated analysis of the Downtown tower ' s structural weaknesses . In those tests , the machine was attached_to a concrete floor two stories beneath the City_Hall tower observation platform . The shaking was done on a weekend when municipal offices were closed , Hart said . Few people are expected to be inside Royce Hall this afternoon when major testing is scheduled to take_place . The machine is bolted to the concrete floor in the former office of Germanic_languages department Chairman Ehrhard Bahr . His department ' s third-floor facilities in the east tower were badly damaged by the Jan . 17 quake and are partially supported by steel scaffolding . During a shakedown test of the machine Friday afternoon , few people in undamaged offices at Royce Hall seemed to notice when Engineering Department technician John Langholff revved it up_to two revolutions per second . There was a buzz-saw-like whine from the electric_motor , a whup-whup-whup sound from the spinning blade and a modest vibration that registered only slightly on Langholff ' s oscilloscope screens . But it was enough to send Gordon Bradley , an assistant superintendent in_charge of outside emergency repairs , running . He warned that columns supporting the towers are sheared off at the sixth floor and that bricks there could fall . His workers could expect &quot; a little shaking , &quot; Langholff told Bradley . &quot; But you can assure them it ' s not an earthquake. &quot;</TEXT>
