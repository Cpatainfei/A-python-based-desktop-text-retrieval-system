   <HEADLINE> PORT OF LOS ANGELES TO CLOSE JAPAN OFFICE , HIRE MARKETING FIRM INSTEAD ; TRADE : HIGH COSTS AND PROTOCOL PITFALLS OF DOING BUSINESS IN TOKYO PROMPT BOARD TO CHANGE STRATEGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a cup of coffee costing $ 7 ( no refills included ) , and a no-frills dinner running about $ 100 , it is little wonder that the Port of Los Angeles was spending more_than half a_million dollars a year to staff a one-person office in Japan . The high costs have prompted the Board of Harbor Commissioners to close the office at the end of this month and hire a marketing firm , Japan Marine Services of Tokyo , to represent port interests there . The change will save the port about $ 200 # 000 a year . &quot; We were looking_at ways to enhance our marketing while cutting costs , and we decided it was in our best interest to go_with an agency rather than a proprietary operation , &quot; port marketing director Al Fierstine said . &quot; It affords us the opportunity to use their resources rather than just one man , &quot; he said . &quot; And it also affords us ( the opportunity ) to use their 25- to 30-member administrative staff rather than paying_for a full-time office , which is where the real savings comes in. &quot; The port ' s Japan office , one of 12 such offices worldwide , has operated for at least 20 years . It has been staffed by Shuji Nomura , whose contract expires Jan . 31 . Nomura has been responsible_for gathering information about marketing and maritime trends and developments likely to affect Los Angeles port operations . &quot; They tell us what top customers are doing from a corporate level -- being that corporations do not always pass_on to local ( Los Angeles ) offices information about when they ' re considering rerouting their cargo or other moves they may make , &quot; Fierstine said . In addition to guarding the port ' s maritime marketing interests , Japan Marine Services will continue working to expand the sea-to-air cargo market of shipments bound for New York , Europe or South_America through Los Angeles International Airport . Cargo holds at the Los Angeles airport are almost full , but port officials believe the market could be expanded to airports in Ontario and Burbank . Also , since Congress approved of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , the port has begun to encourage customers to use it for sending products to Mexico . Companies from Japan , Hong Kong and Taiwan make_up a large bloc of the port ' s customers . Successful dealings with Japanese businesses are linked to a mastery of Japanese etiquette and protocol . Although port officials say they have been careful to observe Japanese customs when dealing with Japanese business people ( for example , presenting a business_card pulled from a shirt pocket rather than from a card case can derail negotiations ) , employing a Japanese company for port marketing can only help . &quot; In Japan itself , when you ' re marketing , it ' s better to have the locals marketing to the locals , &quot; Fierstine said . Fierstine has heard numerous tales of how cultural ignorance by American business people has led to marketing fiascoes . &quot; American companies don ' t always do the proper marketing , and it has caused real problems , &quot; he said . He tells a story about how a U.S. beer manufacturer began selling its product in Taiwan without doing research that would have shown that Taiwanese get their medicine in bottles the same size and color as beer_bottles . &quot; It was a major faux pas , &quot; Fierstine said .</TEXT>
