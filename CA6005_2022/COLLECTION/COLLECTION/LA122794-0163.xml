   <HEADLINE> AMID CHECHNYA SIEGE , YELTSIN CLAIMS VICTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his first public appearance since sending thousands of Russian troops into the breakaway republic of Chechnya , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin announced Monday that the military operation to crush the rebels had mainly succeeded . But even as Yeltsin was delivering an upbeat evaluation of the results of the bloody , 2-week-old campaign to subdue the still-defiant Chechens , other Russian officials warned that rebel commandos had reinforced their positions around the palace still held by Dzhokar M . Dudayev , the Chechen president . About 2 # 000 Chechen gunmen armed with 34 armored vehicles , missile launchers and antiaircraft_guns had completed a defensive ring around the bomb-shattered capital of Grozny , about half a mile from the presidential palace , the Russian government press service said . Eighteen captured Russian soldiers are still being held inside the besieged city , where water , electricity , bandages and medicine are reportedly running_out . At a session of the Russian Security_Council , Yeltsin announced plans for a military occupation of Chechnya in which the tens of thousands of Russian troops now in the Muslim republic would remain there . Police units would be responsible_for restoring order . &quot; We have approached the point where we can wrap_up the military operation and switch to the second stage -- that of forming administrative bodies in the Chechen republic , &quot; Yeltsin told the council meeting . &quot; We have come_close to restoring constitutional law and order there. &quot; He said Russian troops might be moved away from Grozny to unspecified bases but said the soldiers will stay in Chechnya &quot; permanently. &quot; &quot; Chechnya is our republic , and nobody should forget it , &quot; Yeltsin said . He declared that the army had performed &quot; not badly &quot; and said officials had done a good job of providing minimal living standards for the estimated 200 # 000 refugees who have fled the bombing and shelling of the residential neighborhoods of Grozny and its suburbs . The Russian government press service announced that a provisional government headed by Salambek N . Khajiyev -- a 53-year-old chemist and Soviet-era oil executive who has been_active in the anti-Dudayev opposition -- was being set_up . Khajiyev flew to Moscow on Monday and held a news_conference at which he bluntly answered those who would call his Government of National Reconciliation a Russian puppet . &quot; You must be asking yourselves , How legitimate is this body ? &quot; Khajiyev said . &quot; It is as legitimate as the Dudayev regime . &quot; We all know very well that nobody elected Dudayev , &quot; he said , referring to the disputed elections that brought Dudayev to power in 1991 . Last year , after refusing an offer to become Dudayev ' s prime_minister , Khajiyev said he had no doubt that if given a chance , Chechens would vote against being part of Russia . &quot; We must acquire our statehood , real and not puppet , &quot; he told the newspaper Izvestia . On Monday , Khajiyev called_on Moscow to stop bombing Grozny , where &quot; only civilians are suffering. &quot; He called_for new , free elections to resolve Chechnya ' s fate . &quot; The people will decide who is legitimate , &quot; he said , adding , &quot; Dudayev must resign and leave Chechnya if he really cares about the welfare of his people. &quot; Meantime , Khajiyev said , his main task is to restore Chechnya ' s economy , which has been ravaged by a Russian economic blockade , as well as the schools , hospitals and social_welfare system that have crumbled in the three years since Dudayev declared independence . Monday ' s Russian Security_Council meeting had been billed as a showdown between the hawks and doves within the Kremlin , who have been fighting as fiercely as the Chechen guerrillas for influence over Yeltsin . It was unclear who had prevailed , because , after a long closed session , senior officials emerged to make characteristically contradictory statements as_to what will happen next . Nikolai D . Yegorov , nationalities minister and a deputy prime_minister , told the Interfax news_agency that it was imperative that Grozny be seized quickly and that criminal gangs -- presumably Dudayev supporters -- be disarmed . Yegorov insisted that most Chechens oppose negotiations with Dudayev and want him ousted . Vladimir F . Shumeiko -- another senior Yeltsin adviser and head of the Federation Council , or upper house of Parliament -- said Russia ' s Security_Council had authorized Yegorov , Sergei V . Stepashin , the head of the Federal Counterintelligence Service , and Gen . Anatoly Kvashnin , a commander in Chechnya , to negotiate for a cease-fire and rebel disarmament . In a sign that dissent against Yeltsin ' s Chechnya policy will not be tolerated , the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed Monday that it had prepared orders to sack three deputy defense ministers who have spoken out against the military crackdown . But there was no word on whether Yeltsin had signed the decree dismissing the distinguished generals : Boris V . Gromov , the much-decorated commander of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan ; Grigory Kondratiev , and Valery Mironov . The estrangement between Yeltsin and his former democratic allies deepened Monday when Father Gleb P . Yakunin and Lev A . Ponomarev -- two heroes of Russia ' s pro-democracy movement -- quit the Russia ' s Choice bloc to protest Yeltsin ' s Chechnya policy and called_for early presidential elections . Yeltsin had sharp words for another old ally , Sergei A . Kovalev , his human_rights commissioner , who has stayed in Grozny -- despite orders for civilians to leave -- to protest the bombing there . Kovalev further embarrassed Yeltsin by telling the Washington Post that the United States should revise its hands-off policy toward Russian intervention in Chechnya because the current human_rights violations are of international concern and not a purely Russian affair . Yeltsin snapped back Monday , saying that he shared Kovalev ' s concern for human_rights but adding that he wondered why the commissioner had not expressed concern over the violence of Dudayev ' s regime . Outside the presidential administration offices near the Kremlin , 24 human_rights activists from the group Memorial were arrested after staging a peaceful but unlicensed anti-war protest .</TEXT>
