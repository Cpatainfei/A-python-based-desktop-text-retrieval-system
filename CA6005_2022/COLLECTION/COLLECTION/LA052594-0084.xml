   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / LAWRENCE J . MAGID : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; ON-LINE FORUMS CAN PROVIDE HELP WITH NAGGING PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even the most experienced computer users sometimes need help . When I need help with a product , I typically start by calling the manufacturer ' s technical support department . I prefer this option because it allows_for give-and-take between me and the technician . But telephone support has its drawbacks : Some companies charge for it ; often it ' s a long-distance_call ; sometimes you can ' t even get_through . I don ' t know what ' s worse , staying_on hold or having to leave a number hoping that a technician will call you back and actually reach you . Another option is to use an on-line service or computer bulletin_board to seek help from the company or a fellow user . Many hardware and software companies operate forums on the commercial on-line services , and some have their own dial-up bulletin_boards . You ' ll probably have to pay long-distance charges to dial into their boards , but you ' ll pay an hourly on-line fee if you dial into one of the commercial on-line services . CompuServe , which charges_up to $ 9.60 an hour ( at 9 # 600 or 14 # 400 bits per second ) to access its forums , is by far the most popular service for hardware and software support . America Online ( $ 3.50 an hour ) comes_in second . Prodigy ( $ 3.60 an hour for bulletin_board access ) is gearing_up its product support boards . Many of the major software and hardware vendors , including Microsoft , WordPerfect , Lotus , IBM , Apple , Compaq and Hewlett-Packard , operate CompuServe forums where company representatives provide help to customers . In many cases , fellow users are also willing to help . In fact , these fellow users often know more_than the company representatives . And because they ' re not on the company payroll , they ' re more_than willing to share their frustrations , report bugs and suggest techniques to get_around the product ' s limitations . Before posting a question , browse through the board to see if your question has already been answered . Most company forums are organized by product and further broken_down by topic . If you do ask a question , be sure to post it in the right spot and use a descriptive subject line . Don ' t just type &quot; Help Me. &quot; Enter a subject line such_as &quot; Microsoft Word Printing Problem &quot; or &quot; Speadsheet for Mac -- What ' s Best ? &quot; Intuit , which publishes the popular Quicken personal financial management software for DOS , Windows and Mac , is one of the many software companies on CompuServe . One Quicken user posted a query about her frustrations in trying to use the program to manage her 401 ( k ) retirement_plan . Several others immediately responded that they too had run_into this problem , and they offered work-arounds to make_up for the program ' s limitations . In addition to messages , the forums offer files you can download . Last month I was having trouble with my video display , which I traced to an out-of-date video driver for my Diamond VGA card . So I signed_on to Diamond ' s CompuServe forum and downloaded the newest software driver , at no cost other_than CompuServe ' s connect fee . My problem was solved , and I never had to leave my house or wait for someone to send me a disk . Symantec , which publishes the popular Norton Utility_programs for the PC and Mac , uses its on-line forums to provide customers with interim program updates . These are not new versions of the programs ( there ' s a charge for those ) but minor bug fixes or special files , such_as one that lets its anti-virus program tackle viruses that weren ' t around when the software was last updated . Forums are also great places to find add-ons , macros and templates to enhance popular programs such_as Microsoft Word , WordPerfect , Ami Pro , Excel and Lotus 1-2-3 . In many cases , these files will add functionality that simply wasn ' t built into the program itself . Some are provided by the software publisher , but many come from fellow users or developers of shareware , who allow you to download their handiwork freely . You ' re required to pay if you keep any shareware permanently . Relatively few companies offer support via the Internet , but I expect that to change_over the next few years . There are , however , a number of &quot; newsgroups &quot; ( forums ) where users discuss software and hardware . It ' s also possible to download files ( such_as video drivers and templates ) via the Internet , but you have to know where to look and how use the file_transfer_protocol ( ftp ) . Locating files on the Internet can be tricky , but one resource , called Archie , can help you find a file if you know its name . If you don ' t know exactly what you ' re looking_for or you ' re not network-savvy , you ' re better off using one of the commercial on-line services .</TEXT>
