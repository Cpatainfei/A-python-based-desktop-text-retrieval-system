   <HEADLINE> OFFICIALS SEE NO CHARGES IN EARLY WHITEWATER INQUIRY ; PROBE : LAWYERS FOR TREASURY , WHITE_HOUSE AIDES SAY THEY DO NOT EXPECT SPECIAL COUNSEL TO SEEK INDICTMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Senior officials at the Treasury_Department and the White_House have been told by their personal attorneys that they do not expect special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . to seek criminal indictments against them because of allegedly improper meetings linked to the Whitewater controversy . Fiske is said to be close to completing the first phase of his probe , which is focusing both on the suicide last summer of White_House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster and the way in which Administration officials responded to the news of a Whitewater-related criminal referral by federal regulators . That aspect of the inquiry will focus in part on a series of meetings between Treasury_Department and White_House officials in the fall of 1993 and early in 1994 to discuss how to respond to a criminal referral that investigators at the Resolution Trust Corp . sent to the Justice_Department . The referral named President Clinton ' s 1984 gubernatorial campaign as a possible beneficiary of alleged criminal actions by a failed Arkansas savings and loan . But Administration sources said they are increasingly confident that Fiske will conclude that part of his investigation without seeking criminal charges against current or former officials of the Administration . Although they stressed that they have not been given any information by Fiske ' s office on the status of his investigation , they said attorneys hired by Administration officials that have been subpoenaed and investigated by Fiske do not believe that he will move against those officials . &quot; Based upon my understanding and assessment of what is going_on , I don ' t see the basis for any criminal indictments , &quot; said Steven Tabackman , an attorney who represents Jack Devore , the Treasury_Department spokesman who testified before the Whitewater grand_jury earlier this year . The Treasury_Department became embroiled in the Whitewater controversy because the RTC had no permanent head . In the interim , Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman became acting RTC chairman last year , and other senior Treasury_Department aides helped him work_on RTC issues on an ad_hoc basis . Their dual roles as political appointees running an independent regulatory_agency raised questions after they took_part in a series of meetings with White_House officials to discuss the case . Fiske has been trying to conclude the Washington part of his investigation so that Congress can begin Whitewater hearings this summer . The Arkansas part of his inquiry , which covers the origins of the controversy -- including the Clinton family ' s investment in the Whitewater real_estate development and the failure of a Little_Rock , Ark. , S &amp; L owned by their Whitewater partner -- is likely to take much longer , however . * Separately , the White_House said it would comply with a request by the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee for Whitewater-related documents , which the committee wants for Whitewater hearings that probably would begin in late July . Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the White_House received a letter Wednesday night from committee Chairman Donald W . Riegle Jr . ( D-Mich. ) and Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) , the ranking Republican on the panel , asking_for documents already turned_over by the White_House to Fiske . The committee said in a statement that it wants documents from current and former officials at the White_House and other agencies who may have had some involvement in the Washington aspects of the Whitewater case .</TEXT>
