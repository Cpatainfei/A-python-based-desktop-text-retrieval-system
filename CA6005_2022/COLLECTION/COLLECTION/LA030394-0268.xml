   <TEXT> As the American intelligence community tallies the damage done_by the Aldrich Ames espionage affair , it also will try to answer another question : Just how good is the new , &quot; reformed &quot; KGB ? Allegations that the Kremlin had a high-level &quot; mole &quot; inside the CIA -- and that Russian counterintelligence has rooted_out a Russian defense plant executive spying for Britain -- are certain to raise new fears about the reach and activities of Russian intelligence . Ironically , the spy-versus-spy fervor comes at a time when the old KGB has been abolished and the two intelligence services that succeeded it appear to be in disarray , racked by budget crises , a 30 % cut_in staff , wrenching reorganization , an embittering loss of prestige and a disorienting change in mission since the Cold_War ' s end . The arrest of CIA official Ames , charged with spying for Moscow in exchange for more_than $ 2.5 million , has prompted cynical spy-watchers to ask : How did the Russians afford it ? &quot; It was a surprise to discover that they still had enough money to buy Jaguars for their agents , &quot; said Christopher Andrew , a historian specializing in espionage at Cambridge_University . Ames allegedly was recruited in 1985 , when the Soviet_Union was richer and intensely anxious about the Ronald Reagan_Administration ' s military buildup . It was not until 1991 that Ames ' profligate spending , including a $ 25 # 000 down_payment on a Jaguar sedan , reportedly drew American authorities ' attention to him . Outraged U.S. officials believe that Ames may have given Russian intelligence lethal information about the identities of American agents and operating_procedures . But if Ames is a turncoat , he may be among the last of a breed that will be difficult to replace . Russian sources today paint a portrait of a tamer , poorer and far more disorganized intelligence network that poses a greatly reduced threat to the United States . &quot; Financial difficulties , political confusion , the complete lack of guidance from the political leadership as_to what are the most crucial areas -- all_of this has been extremely detrimental to the intelligence community , &quot; said Alexei G . Arbatov , a national security analyst at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow . Russian intelligence today &quot; might continue some operations , but clearly they would be_on a much , much smaller scale than previously , &quot; Arbatov said . Even the old KGB was financed on such a shoestring that its overseas &quot; residents , &quot; or spy station chiefs , were reportedly permitted to spend no more_than $ 300 without approval from Moscow . Now , the money crunch is so severe that employees of the Foreign Intelligence Service , the KGB successor agency that would have supervised Ames , do not have access to personal_computers and must share typewriters , according to the New Daily , a feisty new Moscow newspaper . In an expose last week , it documented the disarray in Russian intelligence . A paper shortage has forced agents to type reports on the backs of old documents . Their offices can no longer afford subscriptions even to Russian newspapers and magazines , let alone foreign periodicals , the paper said . A spokesman for the Federal Counterintelligence Service , the other half of the former KGB , confirmed in an interview that his agency also has not been allocated money for subscriptions this year . Even so , he said , money would be found to reward an especially well-placed source . &quot; In case we need additional money to pay valuable agents , we may apply directly to the president , &quot; said the spokesman , Sergei P . Bogdanov . The Soviet_Union always had great difficulty recruiting American agents . KGB documents smuggled out of the Soviet_Union by defector Oleg Gordievsky show that KGB bosses repeatedly reprimanded subordinates for an &quot; unacceptably low standard &quot; of recruitment , Andrew said . Gordievsky escaped_from Russia in 1985 . The last complaint he smuggled out is dated February of that year . Ames is alleged to have been recruited in May , 1985 . But Andrew said Western scholars have no documents after that date to indicate whether the KGB was satisfied with the information it was allegedly getting from Ames . After working undetected as a double_agent for the_British for 11 years , Gordievsky was fingered at precisely the time when Ames was allegedly recruited . &quot; I have no proof that Ames was responsible , but the fit is a striking one , &quot; Andrew said . If the Soviets had problems snagging Americans , Russia is finding the task even tougher , said the New Daily article , which was based on interviews with 10 unnamed agents . Because money was short and agents motivated by lucre tend to be unreliable , most Soviet foreign_agents came_in two types : idealists who wished to help the socialist workers ' state ; and anti-American activists , usually in the Third_World , who sought to counter U.S. &quot; hegemonic &quot; intent toward their countries . Agents who wanted to build communism have lost interest now that Russia has embraced capitalism and is defending its own national interests , not the workers of the world . &quot; Not one of these people -- and some of them had cooperated with us for 20 years -- would work for the idea of a Great Russia , ' &quot; the article said . Viktor V . Ivanenko , former head of the Security Ministry , said in an interview Monday , &quot; Of course , it is getting increasingly costly to recruit agents now that the intelligence service has to rely mostly on material incentives , with the old ideological dogmas forgotten and forsaken . But we still can play_on universal human values -- on the natural resistance to American egotism. &quot; However , Jeffrey Richelson , a Washington-based expert on intelligence , said that in recent years none of the Americans spying for Moscow has been ideologically motivated . They either wanted money or to settle a grudge . In some cases , the Soviets got priceless secrets for a pittance . In 1978 , the KGB paid former CIA employee William Kampites just $ 3 # 000 for the manual to a KH-11 &quot; keyhole &quot; satellite , for which the Soviets would likely have shelled_out vastly more , Richelson said . Ivanenko said agents are finding sources of financing that would have been heresy in Soviet times . In some places , operatives are allowed to open businesses -- to provide a better cover and to raise money , he said . But it ' s not only foreigners that are proving difficult to recruit . Most bright , multilingual Russian graduates from elite universities would rather land a job at IBM than in the supposedly reformed KGB . The number of students at the Andropov Red Banner Institute , which trains intelligence staff , has dropped from 300 to about 50 ; the students are no longer Russia ' s best and brightest , the New Daily said . After purges , attrition and two chaotic reorganizations , the Foreign Intelligence Service ( known to the CIA as the SVRR ) , and the Federal Counterintelligence Service ( SVR ) , have about one-third fewer employees than the old KGB , Russian officials have said . The counterintelligence agency says it has slashed its work_force from 137 # 000 to a still-enormous 75 # 000 . There are no comparable estimates for the Foreign Intelligence Agency , which handles intelligence gathering outside of Russia , including in the former Soviet republics . Conservative analyst J . Michael Waller , director of the International Freedom Foundation in Washington , argues that the KGB may have become leaner but remains just as mean . &quot; The whole KGB , like the entire Soviet bureaucracy , was bloated with a lot of do-nothing personnel , &quot; Waller said . He added that the Foreign Intelligence Service remains &quot; world class. &quot; Moreover , he argues , despite all_the talk_about the &quot; reformed &quot; KGB , Russia ' s civilian government does not fully control the intelligence services . Many former KGB leaders were purged after the August , 1991 , attempt to overthrow Soviet leader Mikhail S . Gorbachev . But KGB veterans continued to dominate when the agency was turned_into the Russian Security Ministry later that year . In December , President Boris N . Yeltsin abolished the Security Ministry and split its functions between the two new agencies , the SVR and the SVRR . &quot; The system of the organs of the VChK-OGPU-NKVD-MGB-KGB-MB turned_out to be unreformable , &quot; Yeltsin said in a harshly worded decree that spelled_out all_the acronyms by which the secret_police have been known since Bolshevik days . All employees were ordered to undergo a recertification process that was widely interpreted as a license to purge . On Wednesday , the just-fired head of the counterintelligence agency , Nikolai M . Golushko , said that of the 250 senior officers who have undergone recertification procedures since December , 14 had failed to qualify . Some people fled the old KGB as soon as they could do so without political repercussions . Insiders complain that many of the very best -- skilled intelligence_analysts , linguists , computer and communications experts -- have found more lucrative jobs elsewhere . Besides losing massive numbers of personnel , Russia has closed 30 overseas listening posts . Its once-massive agent network in Eastern Europe has been gutted . Some say all_of these factors have affected the quality of the daily intelligence briefing that appears on Yeltsin ' s desk each morning . &quot; Only the Lord knows what garbage we are sending them , &quot; one SVRR source told New Daily . &quot; But they swallow it all. &quot; Waller is skeptical . Russia hasn ' t said which overseas spy stations it closed , and it could have abandoned that many in strategically unimportant Third_World countries where the KGB ' s main job was to promote local Communist_parties , he said . Russian officials insist the infamous old KGB is no more . Russian intelligence is now forbidden to use &quot; substances damaging to human health &quot; -- presumably the poisoned umbrellas and truth_serums of old -- as well as_to blackmail people into cooperation . Besides catching foreign spies , the counterintelligence agency handles counterterrorism , drug trafficking , illegal arms sales , smuggling of radioactive materials and even prevention of industrial accidents , Bogdanov said . A report of shoddy maintenance on an aircraft led to an engine being replaced , preventing a near-certain crash , he said . Like nearly every_other Russian intelligence official interviewed in recent months , Bogdanov complained of a marked escalation of Western intelligence gathering inside Russia and in the other former republics since the breakup of the Soviet_Union . Broke or not , as long as Russian intelligence believes the West is trying to take_advantage of its new vulnerability , the spy game will go_on .
