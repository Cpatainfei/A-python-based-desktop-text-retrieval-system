   <HEADLINE> CHARITY AND TAXES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the era that I grew_up ( 1930s and 1940s ) , charity was a part of everyone ' s life . Those that had , gave , and those that were in need , received and gave thanks.In those days my family received more_than they gave and we were always thankful for the help we received . As I grew older and became more successful in life , I found_out how the givers felt when they actively donated time or material things to a person , family , or charitable organization . Call it satisfying one ' s ego , but one feels something special when actively donating to a charity you believe is helping those in need and who are grateful for the help . I cannot remember a time when I , or others I knew , didn ' t give with love in their hearts . If you believe as I do , that actively giving gives satisfaction , then why do we support a system that gives to the needy through federal , state and local_government taxes ? I don ' t know one person that feels satisfaction when paying taxes . However , the political and social bureaucracies that take your taxes and distribute most to the so-called needy are feeling the satisfaction we should be feeling and are getting paid_for it . We taxpayers must love misery instead of the satisfaction of actively giving because we keep feeding the bureaucrats ' egos more each year . IRVING CRESPI Thousand Oaks</TEXT>
