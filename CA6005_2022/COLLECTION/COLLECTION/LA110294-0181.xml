   <HEADLINE> BIDDERS FOR FCC WIRELESS AUCTION NAMED ; TELECOM : AS FIRMS RACE TO WIN LICENSES FOR ADVANCED MOBILE SERVICES , SOME WARN THAT THERE ARE STILL ' MULTIPLE HURDLES. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal regulators Tuesday disclosed the names of the 74 firms seeking to bid on lucrative licenses to provide advanced mobile phone_services . But a key industry group has told regulators they must eliminate &quot; multiple hurdles &quot; before the technology is available to consumers . Undeterred by fears of unfair competition and concerns that local zoning officials could delay construction of wireless transmission towers , many of telecommunications ' biggest names met the Federal Communications Commission ' s deadline to register for a Dec . 5 auction of wireless licenses for so-called broad-band personal communications services , or PCS . Applicants included all_of the Baby Bell telephone_companies , the General Motors Corp . subsidiary Electronic Data Systems Corp. , long-distance carrier AT &amp; T Corp. , cellular_telephone mogul Craig O . McCaw , and cable operators Continental Cablevision , Cox Cable Communications and Comcast . Scores of lesser-knowns , such_as Solana Beach , Calif. , parking_lot operator Excelsior Parking Corp . and a partnership headed by black attorneys Curtis White and Thomas Hart Jr. , threw their hats in the PCS ring as well . The auctions are aimed at launching a new generation of go-anywhere wireless devices that will enable people to send and receive phone_calls , computer data and perhaps even video through portable devices as small as a wristwatch . A pair of licenses will be bid in each of 51 regional markets , except New York , Los Angeles and Washington . Only one license will be auctioned in those three cities because the FCC has already awarded the second license under a program designed to recognize technical innovation . There was an average of 27 bidders for each license . The most , 34 , seek to provide service to American_Samoa , said Regina Keeney , head of the FCC ' s wireless telecommunications bureau . Southern California attracted the fewest contestants -- just 20 firms , including GTE and McCaw ' s new company , ALAACR Communications . McCaw , who recently sold his cellular empire to AT &amp; T , is now poised to build a new mobile phone business . Buoyant FCC officials said the number of applicants for the auction is in_line with the number that applied in each of three previous auctions for wireless paging services . Those auctions began last summer and have attracted about $ 1 billion in bids . FCC officials said they have similarly high expectations for the December event . &quot; Estimates are ( that ) the winning bidder will invest as much as $ 30 billion to $ 50 billion dollars , in addition to their bids , to build the competing wireless networks , &quot; said Reed E . Hundt , chairman of the FCC . &quot; This investment will add an additional 300 # 000 . . . jobs in the wireless industry and may contribute as_many as 700 # 000 &quot; related jobs . But in a letter sent to Hundt last week , Thomas E . Wheeler , president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn. , expressed concern about zoning rules and said wireless operators could be at a competitive disadvantage because Bellcore , the research arm of the Baby Bells , controls the assignment of telephone_numbers .</TEXT>
