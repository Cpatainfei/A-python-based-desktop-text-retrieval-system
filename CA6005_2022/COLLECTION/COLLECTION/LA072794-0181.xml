   <HEADLINE> LEGAL EXPERT URGES VENUE CHANGE IN THORNTON CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Testifying for the second day , a defense legal_expert urged a Superior_Court judge to move the high-profile murder trial of Thousand Oaks teen-ager Mark Scott Thornton out of Ventura County because of the local publicity that has surrounded the case . Edward J . Bronson , a professor of political_science and law at Cal State Chico , said during Thornton ' s change-of-venue hearing that too many potential jurors in the county have already decided that Thornton killed Westlake nurse Kellie O ' Sullivan . &quot; There is at least a reasonable likelihood that Mr. Thornton will not be able to receive a fair trial in Ventura County , &quot; Bronson said , providing_for the first time a conclusion to a survey he conducted on publicity in the case . If Superior_Court Judge Charles R . McGrath decides against the motion to move the trial , Bronson suggested several alternatives that he said would offer the 19-year-old Thornton a better chance at getting a fair trial . The judge could grant attorneys in the case additional peremptory challenges to disqualify more jurors who appear prejudiced against the defendant , Bronson recommended . Or the judge could delay the start of the September trial until memory of the case fades from the public , he said . But any of those alternative solutions , he said , were secondary to moving the trial to another county . &quot; All these things are useful , &quot; Bronson said . &quot; They can ameliorate some of the prejudices . But they cannot cure them. &quot; Thornton is charged with kidnaping and fatally shooting O ' Sullivan , 34 , the mother of a young son . A grand_jury indictment in the case includes a &quot; special circumstance &quot; that could send Thornton to the gas_chamber , if convicted . Bronson testified on Monday that a survey he designed to gauge public awareness and possible prejudice of the case also supported moving the trial out of the county . Eighty-five percent of the 403 respondents knew about the case , and two-thirds of those with knowledge of it believe Thornton is guilty , he said . He said media coverage of the case had been fairly accurate , but that news_reports tended to portray Thornton in a negative light and O ' Sullivan in a sympathetic way . Under direct examination by Deputy Public_Defender Howard J . Asher on Tuesday , Bronson said the case should be moved from the county for the same reasons that the district_attorney ' s office decided to seek the death_penalty in it . Ordinarily , he said , the crime of which Thornton is accused -- a single slaying with no allegation of rape or torture -- does not merit the death_penalty or a change of venue . But , because O ' Sullivan was white , middle-class and a mother , the tragedy of her death resonated with the community more_than other killings , he said . &quot; This is not a terrible , sadistic , multiple murder-type killing , &quot; Bronson said . He added that the uniqueness of the case is the fear and loathing it left in the community during a 12-day search for O ' Sullivan ' s body after she was discovered missing Sept . 14 . Under cross-examination , Bronson acknowledged that he is personally opposed to the death_penalty , sends $ 50 a year to the American Civil Liberties Union and favors more rights for criminal defendants . &quot; I teach civil_liberties , &quot; he told Deputy Dist . Atty . Peter D . Kossoris , &quot; and I am deeply committed to civil liberties. &quot; He said that he has testified in 56 change-of-venue hearings , mostly to have trials moved_out of the counties where crimes occurred . He also acknowledged that in some of those instances defendants have wound_up being found not_guilty , even after he testified that their chances of getting a fair trial were limited . The hearing , which is expected to last until next Wednesday , will continue today with Bronson back on the stand_for more cross-examination .</TEXT>
