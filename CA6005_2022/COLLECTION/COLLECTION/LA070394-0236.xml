   <HEADLINE> FRENCHMAN ' S ARREST CRACKS NARCOTICS RING ; CRIME : GILBERT PIERRE JEAN-MARIE BARBE IS ACCUSED OF BEING A MAJOR HEROIN SMUGGLER . THE CASE ' S SCOPE RIVALS THE INFAMOUS ' FRENCH CONNECTION ' CAPER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In one of his last moments of freedom , the man who called himself Gilbert Pierre Jean-Marie Barbe strolled along Manhattan ' s Central_Park West , a Foot Locker bag swinging at his side . The scene -- captured in murky police surveillance photos -- made him look_like an ordinary urban shopper . He wasn ' t . Instead , Barbe lived his life as if he had stepped_out of a spy novel . For at least three years , authorities say , the eccentric , 48-year-old Frenchman trotted around the globe with a collection of fake passports , building a lucrative heroin-smuggling operation . They say he lived part time in two luxury Manhattan apartments stocked with crystals and literature on New Age mysticism , closed drug deals on hotel pay phones and pocketed millions of dollars in profits . At times , he would launder his earnings . In a dishwasher . But one misstep late last year brought his world crashing down . Detectives arrested Barbe in New York City on Nov . 17 , setting the stage for a heroin seizure that made quantities from the last &quot; French Connection &quot; case in the late 1960s look modest . Dozens of other traffickers , large and small , including members of the mob , were implicated in a conspiracy to import and distribute 200 kilograms of heroin a year . Prosecutors , while still uncertain about Barbe ' s identity , are building a case so massive and complex it ' s unlikely to reach trial until next year . The crackdown on the far-flung narcotics ring not only suggested that authorities had vastly underestimated the resurgence of heroin in New York City , the world ' s largest drug market . It also closed a chapter in a twisting plot of international intrigue populated by eavesdropping investigators , tough-talking wise_guys and professional junkies . In the real-life saga of Gilbert Barbe , even Al Pacino made a cameo appearance . * The tip of the iceberg surfaced in the summer of 1991 in Hell ' s Kitchen . It was there -- only blocks from Barbe ' s two Midtown apartments , on streets he probably never walked -- that two brothers from Puerto Rico found their American_Dream in a blizzard of illicit powder , according to police . Maximo and Melquiades Torrez allegedly arrived_at work each morning in one of two apartments used as distribution centers for their goods : Glassine envelopes neatly folded and stamped with letters spelling &quot; Big Shot. &quot; The envelopes , peddled by a network of junkies and street people , went_for about $ 15 each . Business was good . The Torrez brothers allegedly sold about $ 11 # 000 of heroin a day . But their dealing angered local merchants and residents , who began complaining to police . The complaints finally reached a lieutenant with the Manhattan South Narcotics major case unit , Ray Ferrari , who had the brothers ' phones tapped . At the time , police hoped to collect enough evidence for a simple conspiracy case that would put the brothers out of business . But police were soon onto something bigger . One of the first voices they overheard was that of Juan ( Don Juan ) Castellanos , believed to be the Torrezes ' supplier . According to police , Castellanos maintained a staff of workers in dingy East Harlem apartments who cut and packaged heroin under the &quot; Big Shot &quot; label . Also on staff were two quality-control junkies who would shoot_up samples and rate the high on a scale of 1 to 10 . Once investigators identified Castellanos , they set_up a series of wiretaps that slowly took them up the heroin food_chain . They soon learned Castellanos was allegedly a middle manager in an organization run_by two men described as &quot; the yuppies of the heroin trade. &quot; Richard Texidor and Reginald Bryant drove a fleet of Mercedes and Range Rovers , and lived_in sprawling suburban spreads next to bankers and lawyers . The pair is alleged to have bought their product from a part-time supplier named John Nicolosi . Nicolosi is suspected of buying from Frank ( Junior ) Bassi , a career supplier . The alleged connections of both Nicolosi and Bassi , a major player in drug smuggling since the 1950s , reached_into three notorious Mafia families . Bassi , 60 , was a fugitive from a year-old heroin bust that landed his son in jail . But after moving to a safe house in the_Bronx , he is believed to have continued to feed several distributors throughout New York City and Long_Island , and parts of New Jersey , Maryland , Massachusetts and Virginia . Bassi was brash . He was keen at spotting undercover police trying to tail his car , taking them on &quot; rides &quot; -- circuitous routes that made them give_up in frustration -- and boasting about it later . &quot; Hey , I had eyes following me today , &quot; he would tell associates over his wiretapped phone , according to police . &quot; It must be you they ' re after. &quot; One of his contacts stood_out : Gilbert Barbe . Not that police knew anything about him ; to them , Barbe was a disembodied voice floating beyond the arm of the law . He called Bassi sporadically and spoke_to him in curt riddles . &quot; Your watches are here , &quot; he would say in his heavy French accent , referring to kilos of heroin . &quot; They ' re $ 135 # 000 each. &quot; Investigators traced the calls to several pay phones located throughout two large Midtown hotels . But dozens of stakeouts at both yielded nothing . &quot; We listened to this guy for months , &quot; Ferrari said , &quot; but we couldn ' t touch him. &quot; Sensing that their investigation had run its course , police planned a massive raid for Dec . 7 . It appeared that Barbe would skate . Then , just three weeks before the raid , the elusive Frenchman slipped . * When not in Paris or Thailand or points between , investigators say , Barbe was in Manhattan cutting big drug deals with small_change . His pockets full of quarters , he would call his customers strictly from the hotel pay phones . He never mentioned names , times or places -- much to the dismay of police who had wiretapped his customers ' phones . Finally , they overhead one conversation on Nov . 16 that gave them a start . &quot; I ' ll call_back tomorrow at 2 p.m. , &quot; the Frenchman told a voice believed to be Frank Bassi ' s . At exactly 2 p.m. on Nov . 17 , detectives began circling the pay phones in the Parker Meridien hotel . The sound of a thick French accent triggered a Pavlovian response . &quot; We ' d heard that voice thousands of times , &quot; said Detective Jerry Rosenberg . &quot; We knew it instantly. &quot; For the next several hours , detectives watched as the man with the_French accent , goatee and long dark coat went_to the Hilton , purchased a roll of quarters , made more phone_calls , then hopped into a cab . The detectives commandeered their own cab , following him to a restaurant on the Upper West_Side . Outside , Bassi was waiting . Barbe climbed into Bassi ' s brown station_wagon for a short ride . When he stepped_out , he was carrying a shopping_bag . The detectives finally stopped Barbe when he entered a subway_station at Columbus Circle , telling him they wanted to question him about robberies at Midtown hotels . Visibly nervous but cooperative , the suspect told police he was a diamond trader named Gilbert Barbe . When they asked about the bag , he showed them a shoe box filled with $ 20 # 000 in cash . &quot; I ' m a legitimate businessman , &quot; he continued to insist , inviting them to inspect his apartment on West 56th Street . Barbe produced a passport , a driver ' s license and piles of shipping records showing an address for a warehouse in Queens . As the suspect paced back and forth in the apartment under the watchful eyes of detectives , another set of investigators paid a visit to the warehouse . At first , they found nothing more_than two large shipping containers , apparently empty . But a closer inspection ended the game . Inside a secret compartment , they discovered $ 1.7 million in neat piles . Barbe was arrested that night . His suppliers and dealers , still unaware of his arrest , were next . At dawn on Dec . 7 , nearly 500 officers raided more_than 30 locations throughout the five boroughs , Long_Island and in parts of New Jersey . By afternoon , nearly 70 suspects -- including Bassi , the Torrez brothers , Castellanos , Texidor , Bryant , Nicolosi , organized crime soldiers and a police_officer accused of providing counterintelligence -- were in custody . ( All but Melquiades Torrez are awaiting trial ; he pleaded guilty to a drug-conspiracy charge and was sentenced to 5 to 10 years. ) Six days later , police arrived_at a West 57th Street building where Barbe had another apartment . The doorman wore a Santa outfit with a flashing belt ; the detectives carried sledgehammers with which they smashed down Barbe ' s door . As they walked in , one of the heroin smuggler ' s neighbors , Al Pacino , walked_out . He paused to gawk at the investigators . The search of the Frenchman ' s hideaway didn ' t last long . Inside the front closet of the 26th-floor studio , detectives found five identical black suitcases . All told , they held 424 pounds of pure heroin with an estimated street value of $ 240 million . The seizure -- although not approaching the national record of 1 # 071 pounds recovered in an Oakland , Calif. , raid in 1991 -- was the largest ever for the New York City Police_Department . It also eclipsed the 79 pounds recovered in another high-publicity probe linked to French nationals -- the so-called &quot; French Connection &quot; case . In that case , which became the basis for a book and two movies , heroin was smuggled through Marseilles in cans of_imported fish , expensive European cars and secret compartments of private and commercial jets . In effect , authorities said , Barbe wrote the sequel : In Kiev , he purchased six shipping containers outfitted with false bottoms . In Thailand , he filled the false bottoms with heroin bought_at $ 12 # 000 a kilo . In Singapore , he had the containers loaded with rattan furniture as a cover . The containers were shipped to Port Newark , N.J. , where they cleared customs , then trucked to Queens . The secret compartments served a dual purpose : To import heroin and export cash , both in massive quantities . * Barbe may be out of business , but his mystique endures . His lawyer did not return numerous phone_calls . And personal data provided by investigators is sketchy . Records , books and literature collected at his apartments suggest he is a vegetarian , a Buddhist , a follower of New Age mysticism . The $ 69 # 000 in cash was found in his 57th Street apartment hint at another trait : paranoia . About $ 40 # 000 was neatly stacked in the dishwasher . Because he kept literature explaining that U.S. currency often is tainted with narcotics residue , investigators speculate he washed his money . Police also recovered five passports , including one with the name Joel Guichard , his alias for the bogus furniture import-export business . Prosecutors , investigators and court documents still refer to him as Gilbert Pierre Jean-Marie Barbe . But sources concede that probably is not his real name . Publicity could hinder the investigation , they say .</TEXT>
