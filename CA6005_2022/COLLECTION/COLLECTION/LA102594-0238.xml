   <HEADLINE> T-BOND YIELDS ABOVE 8 % SEND STOCKS TUMBLING ; ECONOMY : THE RATE FOLLOWS WEEKS OF BEARISHNESS . WORRIES PERSIST ABOUT INFLATION , SUPPLY OF NEW BONDS AND WEAK DOLLAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Treasury_bond yields surged above 8 % for the first time in 2 1 / 2 years Monday , sending stocks tumbling amid persistent concern about inflation , an upcoming supply of new bonds and a weak dollar . The long bond ' s push_through the psychologically key 8 % yield follows weeks of bearishness in the Treasury market . Worried about the timing of the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s next rate hike , most investors and traders have had little appetite for buying bonds . The key 30-year bond yield ended the day at 8.04 % , up from Friday ' s 7.97 % . Its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , closed_down 23 / 32 point , or $ 7.19 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . The last time the bond yield was that high was_on April 29 , 1992 , when it closed at 8.06 % . The rising interest_rates wiped_out gains from an early buying spree sparked by surprisingly strong third-quarter profits by Caterpillar Inc. leaving the Dow Jones industrial average down 36.0 points at 3 # 855.30. The day ' s slide brought the blue-chip indicator ' s three-day losses to 81 points . The broader market also fell sharply with declining issues outnumbering advances by about 13 to 6 on the New York Stock_Exchange . After jumping more_than half a percentage_point in the last seven weeks , the market attempted to push bond yields above 8 % several times in the past week . But the yield closed just below that level as reluctant traders and investors shied away at the last minute . But about midmorning Monday , the yield shot above 8 % in a flurry of heavy selling , according to Robin Mesch , chief fixed-income analyst at Thomson Financial Services in Boston . The Treasury market ' s skittishness follows recent reports that economic strength continues unabated . A robust economy raises the likelihood that the Fed will raise interest_rates again to quell inflation , which tends to spiral upward when the economy expands . Bond traders are concerned that word of the economy ' s strength will be underlined this week by data , including September consumer confidence , durable goods and third-quarter gross_domestic_product . If the reports show more strength , traders believe , a rate hike is likely by the next meeting of the Fed ' s policy-making panel in mid-November . Higher rates depress the value of bonds already in circulation , so the prospect gives traders little reason to buy Treasury securities . Bond prices dropped_in tandem with a sharp decline in the dollar ' s value against the German mark , reinforcing a recent trend of parallel movements in the Treasury and foreign_exchange markets . As in the past , bond investors feared that a weak dollar would aggravate inflation by driving_up the price of_imports into the United States . In addition , a lower dollar tends to discourage foreign investors from buying dollar-denominated investments such_as Treasury_bonds . The dollar finished in New York at 1.494 German marks , down from 1.499 on Friday . It also fell against the Japanese yen , closing at 97.13 yen , down from 97.19. Analysts said the dollar ' s weakness alone is not likely to force the Fed to raise short-term interest_rates , but it caused added concern among investors already jittery over inflation , since imports would cost more . On Wall_Street , stocks moved higher early in the session , encouraged by strong corporate earnings_reports from Caterpillar , Black &amp; Decker , U.S. Healthcare and others . But as interest_rates pushed sharply upward , stocks also tumbled . &quot; Last week the market stared 4 # 000 ( on the Dow ) in the eye and blinked . Now it ' s coming_back down , &quot; said Walter Revis , market_analyst at Principal Financial Securities . &quot; It ' s just one more thing for them to be a little more nervous about , &quot; said Thomas Kirkenmeier , vice_president at Northern Trust Co . With interest_rates rising , investors are wondering if the economic recovery may have peaked and corporate earnings forecasts for 1995 will have to be revised lower . The NYSE ' s composite index fell 2.09 points to 253.50. The Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index fell 4.06 points to 460.83 and the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller companies fell 4.17 to 761.21. At the American_Stock_Exchange , the market_value index lost 2.63 to 453.72. Among the market highlights : * Interest-rate sensitive stocks were among the day ' s losers . American International Group fell 1 1 / 4 to 90 1 / 4 and Federal National Mortgage Assn . lost 1 7 / 8 to 75 . * Caterpillar earnings were a better-than-expected $ 1.20 a share and the stock rose 1 7 / 8 to 58 1 / 4 . * Black &amp; Decker earnings were 31 cents a share compared to an estimate by private economists of 28 cents . The stock rose 5 / 8 to 23 3 / 8 . * Earnings for U.S. Healthcare , listed on the Nasdaq market , were 63 cents a share , compared to an estimate of 59 cents . The stock rose 1 3 / 4 to 47 . * Airborne Freight dropped 6 3 / 8 to 19 1 / 8 after its third-quarter earnings of 38 cents a share fell under Wall_Street forecasts . * Stratus Computer jumped 1 3 / 4 to 36 1 / 4 after it posted a sharp rise in third-quarter profits . * Pfizer rose 5 / 8 to 73 7 / 8 after telling analysts it will have six drugs in Phase III clinical trials by the end of the year and expects to have a company record of 14 new chemical entities in advanced Phase III trials next year . Stocks ended mixed in overseas trading . In Tokyo , the 225-share Nikkei average ended down 46.71 points at 19 # 852.37. Frankfurt ' s DAX 30-share average rose 3.16 points to close at 2 # 025.38 , while London ' s Financial Times 100-share average fell 3.7 to 3 # 029.1. Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index closed 53.24 points lower at 2 # 633.62. Market Roundup , D10</TEXT>
