   <HEADLINE> THIS BUD ' S FOR BORA ; BUCKING PROTOCOL , WORLD CUP SOCCER COACH WILL HAWK BEER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the Super Bowl of soccer -- the 1994 World Cup -- is aired next summer , the charismatic head coach of America ' s World Cup team , Bora Milutinovic , will star in Spanish-language TV and print ads promoting Budweiser beer . And that has some critics raising sharp protests . After all , consumers would never see an active National Football_league coach hawking beer . The NFL forbids current coaches or players from appearing in ads for alcoholic_beverages -- except those that promote responsible drinking . So does Major_League Baseball , the National Basketball Assn . and the National Hockey_League . What ' s more , federal regulations -- and self-imposed beer industry guidelines -- have historically been interpreted as prohibiting active athletes as well as coaches from appearing in beer ads . But with Budweiser sales declining in recent years , some consumer activists suggest the move is one of desperation by brewer Anheuser-Busch . The 1993 Maxwell Consumer Report , a highly regarded monitor of the food , beverage and tobacco_industries , reports that Budweiser ' s market share has dropped for five consecutive years . It plummeted 3.1 % in 1993 to 23.4 % . That has left the brewer scrambling for new markets , such_as Latinos . Even the government bureau that oversees ad regulations for alcoholic_beverages says that with this campaign , Anheuser-Busch appears to be ignoring federal regulations . &quot; I can ' t believe Anheuser-Busch plans to commit millions of dollars to this campaign , &quot; said Les Stanford , information officer at the Washington-based Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . The spots are scheduled to be filmed sometime this month . &quot; I don ' t recall any ads with active coaches promoting beer , and there ' s a good reason for it , &quot; Stanford said . &quot; If you ' re a coach pushing an alcoholic_beverage , well , we look_at it the same as if you ' re a player . that ' s a no-no , &quot; he said , referring to &quot; false or misleading &quot; ad practices prohibited by the Federal Alcohol Administration Act of 1935 . In the early 1950s , the bureau specifically ruled against the use of active athletes in alcoholic_beverage advertisements , saying such ads imply that alcohol somehow contributes to athletic skills . The big beer_makers have a long history of trying to link their images with athletes and coaches . During this year ' s Super Bowl , for example , Budweiser will broadcast several beer ads featuring Mike Ditka , former head coach of the Chicago Bears , and Bum Phillips , former head coach of the Houston Oilers . At the same time , Pat Riley , now head coach of the New York Knicks and former Los Angeles Lakers coach , is in the midst of a multiyear contract as a spokesman for Miller Brewing Co. ' s &quot; Think When You Drink &quot; campaign . Similarly , Miami Dolphin quarterback Dan Marino has been a paid spokesman for Anheuser-Busch ' s &quot; Know When to Say When &quot; campaign . And in the 1988 Winter Olympic Games , the U.S. Ice_Hockey Team briefly sold ad space on the hockey_players ' helmets to Budweiser , which pasted &quot; Bud &quot; on the sides of the helmets . After consumer complaints and objections from Olympic officials , the logos were removed . Several consumer groups are particularly unhappy with Budweiser ' s latest proposal to feature the head coach of the U.S. Soccer Team . &quot; This is irresponsible and shows a lack of concern for the Hispanic population and its youth , &quot; said Jane Delgado , president and chief_executive of the National Coalition of Hispanic Health &amp; Human Services Organizations , a Latino consumer group in Washington . &quot; It ' s using a respected figure to promote a product that ' s clearly not for youth . I guess it ' s a free-for-all out there and all people care about is market share. &quot; She said she hopes the ads never run . Equally outspoken is Peggy Charren , co-founder of the consumer group_Action for Children ' s Television . &quot; The World Cup is one of the few programs you would n ' t want to turn_off when your kids are watching , &quot; she said . &quot; But here ' s a beer salesman who would be very attractive to kids . Kids will trust this guy. &quot; Not only will kids trust him , but they will probably be inclined to want to drink his brand of beer , said Sarah Kayson , director of public policy at the Washington-based National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence . &quot; This is one message that we don ' t think should be sent to kids. &quot; Milutinovic , the soccer coach who will star in the ads , conceded in a telephone_interview that he doesn ' t even drink Budweiser . &quot; I don ' t drink beer . I don ' t like it , &quot; said Milutinovic , who is fluent in five languages , including English and Spanish . &quot; I drink 7-Up. &quot; Milutinovic is widely regarded for coaching the Mexican national team to sixth place in the 1986 World Cup held_in Mexico , and for coaching the 1990 Costa Rican team that surprised many fans by qualifying for the second round of the World Cup in Italy . The team he now coaches , Team USA , also surprised the soccer world with a 2-0 win_over England in the 1993 U.S. Cup . Milutinovic said he doesn ' t think there is anything wrong with him appearing in ads for Anheuser-Busch , &quot; because they ' ve helped the sport of soccer so much. &quot; Indeed , Anheuser-Busch has sponsored soccer events in the United States for 15 years , including televised sponsorship of the past two World Cups . And it is a so-called marketing partner with the upcoming World Cup , which is hoping to whet American interest in soccer by holding the finals in the United States this year for the first time . The final game is scheduled at the Rose Bowl on June 17 . It is expected to be seen by an estimated 2 billion viewers worldwide -- nearly twice the audience of the Super Bowl . Executives at Anheuser-Busch , which has paid an estimated $ 3.5 million to be the exclusive beer sponsor of World Cup soccer , insist there is nothing wrong -- legally or morally -- with using Milutinovic in its Budweiser ads . &quot; You won ' t see Bora holding a Bud and saying , ' When I drink beer , I drink Bud , ' &quot; said Alejandro Ruelas , senior manager of ethnic marketing at Anheuser-Busch . &quot; Every piece_of_work we ' re doing is being done with the best interest of the game at heart. &quot; &quot; We certainly have sensitivity about any advertising that might undermine the millions of dollars we ' re spending to discourage underage drinking , &quot; said Joe Castellano , vice_president of consumer awareness and education at Anheuser-Busch . The Milutinovic campaign , he said , was a &quot; no brainer &quot; because the World Cup &quot; is clearly an adult-oriented event. &quot; What ' s more , Castellano said , Anheuser-Busch believes the federal regulations that prohibit active athletes from appearing in beer ads do not bar active coaches . The bureau has &quot; never construed ( the use of ) coaches as a violation , &quot; he said . Nor does the Beer Institute , the Washington-based beer industry lobby , see anything wrong with the proposed campaign . &quot; If you look_at ( Milutinovic ) as a role_model , it can send a positive message to the Hispanic community , &quot; said Jeff Becker , vice_president of alcohol issues . &quot; On the one hand , you have some people asking you to be more inclusive in your advertising , and on the other hand , you have others who will say , ' that ' s a bad idea ' to anything you do. &quot; Senior executives with World Cup ' 94 say they have no problems with the relationship between Anheuser-Busch and Milutinovic . &quot; Everything ( Anheuser-Busch ) has done has been in very good taste , &quot; said Lester Wintz , senior_vice_president of external affairs at World Cup USA ' 94 . &quot; I have no concerns. &quot; But one sports marketing expert suggested that the World Cup is simply bending to the pressure of a major sponsor . &quot; I ' m sure the World Cup committee wrestled with this one , &quot; said Martin Blackman , a New York-based sports marketing consultant . &quot; But put yourself in their shoes . Bud is giving you a lot of dough . So there might be hesitation on their part to say to Bud , ' Back off. ' But I think they should have. &quot; Bud Loses Some Fizz Budweiser beer -- the best-selling beer in the United States -- has seen its market share and sales fall_for the last five years . Budweiser market share : 23.4 % ( 1993 ) Budweiser sales ( millions of barrels ) : 44.2 millions of barrels ( 1993 ) Source : Wheat , First Securities ; Maxwell Consumer Report , Beverage Industry magazine</TEXT>
