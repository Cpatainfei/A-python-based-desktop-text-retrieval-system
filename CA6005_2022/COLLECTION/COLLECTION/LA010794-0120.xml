   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN PRESIDENT WILL CONSIDER PARDON FOR SOME INDIAN GUERRILLAS ; UNREST : SALINAS MAKES FIRST MENTION OF AMNESTY IN A TELEVISED ADDRESS . ARMY APPEARS TO HAVE LAUNCHED A NEW OFFENSIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Carlos Salinas de Gortari late Thursday said he is willing to consider a pardon for some Indian rebels in southern Mexico as his government moved to answer charges of human_rights abuses in its conflict with the guerrillas . In a televised address to the nation , Salinas said , &quot; For the poverty-stricken ( rebels ) who have participated in this violent and illegal conduct because they were tricked , pressured or even desperate , we will look_for benign treatment and even consider pardon. &quot; His comments came as the army appeared to launch a new offensive , firing rockets near the town of Cerro Huitepec , three miles southwest of the regional tourist center of San Cristobal de las Casas in lush Chiapas state , the Associated Press reported . There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage . Refugees trickled into San Cristobal despite army roadblocks around the areas where the guerrillas , who want land and improved social conditions , are believed to be hiding . Military officials say 95 people have died in the fighting since the rebels began their uprising on Jan . 1 , but reports from church groups place the number of deaths closer to 400 . In an apparent effort to generate goodwill and alleviate shortages caused by the conflict , the government has reportedly sent 20 tons of rice , beans , powdered_milk and other food into the affected region . Jorge Madrazo , director of the government ' s national Human_Rights Commission , set_up an office in San Cristobal on Thursday morning and by afternoon had received nine complaints , mainly involving disappearances , he said . For safety reasons , he said , commission officials have not yet been allowed access to Ocosingo , where the army is suspected of having executed at least seven captured rebels . The bodies of the captured guerrillas have been moved to the state_capital , Tuxtla Gutierrez , where the commission has requested autopsies , Madrazo said . Americas Watch , the U.S.-based human_rights organization , wrote Salinas on Thursday to protest the apparent execution-style slayings of at least 21 guerrillas , the bombardments of civilian hamlets and the killing of a Red_Cross worker in unclear circumstances . The organization questioned the ability of the government ' s human_rights officials to fully investigate allegations of abuse , especially those in which the army is implicated . It urged Salinas to give his full cooperation to international human_rights organizations who plan to investigate . &quot; The peaceful and legal protests of the poor majorities in Chiapas in the recent past have been greeted with repression , authoritarianism and ( arbitrariness ) , as well as with violence from local powers ( who act ) with official impunity , &quot; Americas Watch wrote . While the violence appeared to have abated in Chiapas , a group claiming to represent an urban branch of the Zapatista National Liberation Army , as the guerrillas in southern Mexico call themselves , vowed to fight on and threatened to attack &quot; the nerve_centers of the oligarchy &quot; in the capital . The so-called Mexico_City Urban Front , in letters to Mexican newspapers published Thursday , urged citizens &quot; to humor and protect us &quot; as the group fights &quot; for socialism &quot; and against hunger , electoral fraud and corruption . &quot; It cannot be legal to massacre with bombs our demands for a better future , &quot; the group said . &quot; We also have a right to speak , but unfortunately the government only understands the words of weapons. &quot; Earlier Thursday , Salinas spoke out against the uprising , calling it &quot; despicable &quot; and harmful to the name of Mexico . &quot; Violence does not generate more liberty , nor more democracy , but rather hatred and political intransigence , &quot; he said . Salinas and other government officials , who have contended that the guerrillas had help from Guatemalan leftists and other foreigners , said the leadership of the insurgency is made_up of well-trained , educated &quot; professionals &quot; who , taking_advantage of historical grievances , have rallied a group of indigenous peasants , including 14- and 15-year-olds , to participate in the uprising . Salinas made his remarks after a ceremony in which , as part of a traditional celebration of the nation ' s 1915 agrarian reform law , he handed_out titles to land long occupied by the recipients , legalizing their claims to the properties . The problems of landless peasants that the 79-year-old law was meant to solve go_to the heart of long-held grievances that turned Indians here into rebels . * Salinas has further amended the old reforms , instigating a survey of disputed land nationwide and allowing peasants who are part of an ejido , a communal farm based on Indian traditions , to divide their land into private_property . He has also substituted direct subsidies for farm price_supports , saying that previous policies have not worked . However , the new policies -- less than a year old -- have yet to show results . The problems of the countryside are evident in Tzibaja , which until the guerrillas ' New Year ' s Day uprising was just another poor Indian village without enough land to support the 300 or so families who live here . Now , this village in the_hills above Ocosingo -- where the heaviest fighting of the conflict has taken_place -- may become a symbol of both the festering problems that led to the revolt and the government ' s efforts to address them . Government officials promised to examine land disputes in Tzibaja and San Juan Chamula , a village near San Cristobal , after speaking with leaders of diverse groups in Chiapas on Tuesday . In the wake of the fighting , people here are reluctant to discuss their disputes . Women in flower-embroidered blouses and beribboned , ankle-length wrap skirts shut the metal doors of their unpainted concrete houses as strangers walk down the dirt streets . &quot; People are afraid because of all that has happened , &quot; said one young_man , speaking on the condition his name would not be used . The village ' s problem , he said , is land : &quot; We have been asking_for more land since the time of our fathers , but we get no answer. &quot; * Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson , in Mexico_City , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
