   <HEADLINE> NEXTEL LAUNCHES NEW WIRELESS SERVICE IN STATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nextel Communications Inc. on Thursday launched a digital wireless communications service in California , a first_step in the company ' s ambitious plan to create a nationwide system to compete with traditional cellular_phones . Aimed initially at businesses , Nextel ' s phone is larger than a typical cellular_phone , but can be used for a range of communications including paging and two-way radio dispatch . The Rutherford , N.J.-based firm , backed by Motorola Inc. , has over the last several years stitched together a national network of the radio_frequency licenses used by taxi dispatchers . But Nextel absorbed a big setback last month when MCI Communications pulled_out of an agreement to invest $ 1.3 billion in the company . The digital system allows far more traffic to flow over one channel than the analog system still used by most cellular_phone firms . The two cellular carriers in Los Angeles , Air Touch Communications and L.A. Cellular , are moving to convert their networks to digital . Nextel has invested about $ 300 million to build cell towers throughout California . Because the radio frequencies the firm uses are broken_up into tiny pieces , 130 towers were necessary just to cover Los Angeles . At a press_conference in downtown Los Angeles , Mayor Richard Riordan demonstrated the handset ' s digital cellular function to respond to a text message from Sacramento Mayor Joseph Serna . Serna and Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris spoke_to each other via the digital dispatch function .</TEXT>
