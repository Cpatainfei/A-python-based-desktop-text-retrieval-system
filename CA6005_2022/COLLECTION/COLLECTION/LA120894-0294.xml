   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY OFFICIALS URGE CALM AS CRISIS FALLOUT SPREADS ; FINANCES : WEARY LEADERS SEEK TO REASSURE INVESTORS , EMPLOYEES AND RESIDENTS AFTER BANKRUPTCY FILING . SOME CITY AND SCHOOL OFFICIALS MAKE PLANS IN CASE SITUATION WORSENS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A day after Orange County declared bankruptcy to ward_off creditors , its weary leaders appealed for calm and sought to assure the investment world , county employees and dozens of agencies with billions of dollars tied_up in its frozen investment fund that civic life could go_on . Even as the county made those pleas , however , city and school officials began calculating that they soon might run_out of money if they cannot claim money from the fund ; some planned for the inevitability of_their_own bankruptcy filings if the crisis deepens . &quot; People are tense and nervous . I wish they would send me our $ 24 million , &quot; said Saddleback Community_College District Chancellor Robert A . Lombardi . &quot; The only thing I can add is we ' re trying to operate without getting everybody scared to death. &quot; County supervisors were insistent Wednesday that all county and school payrolls would be met and that no one ' s taxes would be raised because of the financial turmoil . The fate of some major projects -- such_as new courthouses and a possible stadium project in Anaheim -- remained uncertain , however . &quot; I want to assure the residents of Orange County and the world investment community that Orange County has the wherewithal to resolve this situation in an orderly fashion , &quot; said Thomas F . Riley , chairman of the County Board of Supervisors . Still , as one of the nation ' s wealthiest counties reeled from the news that it had defaulted_on a $ 1.2-billion loan , stumbling into the biggest municipal financial collapse in history , the aftershocks continued : * City_managers from across the county held an emergency session to plot strategy and hire their own bankruptcy attorney . Anaheim , with $ 169 million in the fund , froze all hiring and halted capital improvement projects . Orange County Water District officials said they will not be able to meet their next payroll in two weeks unless they can tap into the county fund . * Taxpayers flooded county offices to ask whether they still had to pay property_taxes due Monday -- as , indeed , they must . One man was so irate on seeing the framed photograph of former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron hanging_on a wall that he threatened to come_back with a gun if the photo was not taken_down . * Laguna Beach Unified Supt . Paul Possemato said that some school districts may follow the county ' s lead and file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection . La Habra City School District officials said they would likely put_on hold a $ 1.5-million elementary_school expansion . * In Washington , Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said he would consider raising interest_rates again in January to forestall inflation . That could prove another blow to the county ' s investment holdings , which tumbled in value as interest_rates soared . Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey said he was closely monitoring the county ' s situation and watching for reaction in the world market . * The Commodity Futures Trading Commission , a federal agency that oversees futures and commodities markets , announced that it would step_up its efforts to investigate Wall_Street firms that place local_governments , such_as Orange County , in risky investments . * Municipal_bond values slumped nationwide as investors responded fearfully to Orange County ' s bankruptcy . Mutual_fund companies said there was no rush on the part of individual investors to sell California municipal_bond funds . But federal regulators said some fund parent firms plan to buy Orange County bonds now in fund portfolios , to calm public jitters . Traders reported that some Orange County bonds and bonds of municipalities were being priced in the market at just 50 to 80 cents on the dollar Wednesday -- but that virtually no bonds were actually changing hands at those prices . * Standard &amp; Poor ' s Corp. , a major credit rating agency , followed_through on its pledge to lower the county ' s bond_rating to below investment grade status . That will make the cost of borrowing exorbitant for county government . The rating agency notified cities , schools and special districts with money in the fund that they had been put_on negative credit watch , the usual step before a downgrade . * Payments were briefly delayed for Orange County vendors , though officials said check processing would resume today . * There were no hearings on the county ' s twin bankruptcy filings -- one for itself , one for the investment pool . Challenges to the filings are expected from taxpayer groups and some of the giant investment banks that lent money to the county , but none materialized Wednesday . Pointing Fingers Tom Rogers , a longtime member of a county taxpayers ' s association , hired an attorney to contest the bankruptcy court cases . &quot; There is no way this county is insolvent , &quot; Rogers said . &quot; Absolutely no way. &quot; During the day , county officials lashed_out at the federal Securities and Exchange Commission , which is investigating the county ' s portfolio for possible misconduct . County Supervisor William G . Steiner said he believes the SEC , which the county had begged for help in freezing its investment fund short of a bankruptcy filing , wanted a &quot; meltdown &quot; of the pool so it could pressure Congress for power to regulate the municipal securities market . SEC officials denied the allegation . &quot; As far as the SEC is concerned , we ' re not responsible_for the financial_condition of this county , &quot; said William McLucas , head of enforcement for the agency . &quot; It ' s absolutely absurd . Somebody must have been smoking something or dropped_in from planet Mars. &quot; Orange County Chief Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider pointed blame for the financial disaster squarely at Citron , who resigned Sunday . &quot; The responsibility for managing the pool lies_with a separately elected official -- and that was Bob Citron , &quot; Schneider said . A management team of county department leaders and major investors was being assembled to review the county ' s future investments . Officials said the county ' s 18 # 000 workers will be updated on their employer ' s fiscal health through an electronic phone_service . &quot; The county is not broke , &quot; said bankruptcy attorney Bruce Bennett , who is working with the county to devise a financial reorganization plan . &quot; The county is not going_out of business. &quot; Some Wall_Street investment_bankers said Wednesday that the Chapter 9 filing could have been prevented , but that some major brokerages had lost faith in county leaders and saw no support coming from state lawmakers in Sacramento . &quot; Wall_Street was dying for leadership on this , &quot; said one investment_banker who spoke on the condition that he not be named . &quot; The logical place for it to have come from was Sacramento , but we saw nothing. &quot; The banker also said there was discord within the Wall_Street community . CS First Boston Corp . -- which precipitated the bankruptcy by calling_in $ 1.2 billion in loans to the county -- took its action without consulting Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . or Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. , the county ' s other big lenders , this banker said . The county ' s failure to make a $ 1.2-billion payment to First Boston prompted the firm to sell $ 2 billion in securities it held as collateral , analysts said . &quot; I think it was a combination of them getting increasingly nervous and also frustrated with their inability to get_to the decision-makers in the county , &quot; the banker said . &quot; But I also think they just panicked. &quot; In addition , Nomura Securities in New York was said to have called_in loans it had made to the county , after its parent firm in Japan ordered its U.S. managers &quot; to get_out , &quot; a Wall_Street source said . Nomura was said to have put $ 500 million in county securities up for_sale Wednesday afternoon . Trying to Assess Losses One question the county has yet to answer is how big a loss it took_on the $ 2 billion securities sale by First Boston . Wall_Street sources estimated that the loss would have been about 20 % , meaning that the county realized a $ 400 million loss on its portfolio . Until Tuesday , the county had lost money only on paper . Merrill Lynch continued to say it will stand_by the county and that it has not withdrawn $ 2 billion in credit extended_to the county fund . But the giant firm ' s supportive position may soon become a burden , some Wall_Street executives said , because Merrill Lynch is unlikely to single-handedly take_on the job of financing the county ' s portfolio if other firms continue to walk away . In a statement , officials of Smith Barney Inc. , which has $ 800 million in credit outstanding to the county fund , said they were not contemplating any liquidation of Orange County holdings pledged as collateral . But the firm added that it believed it has the right to liquidate its position if the county fails to make timely payments -- regardless of the Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing . &quot; We believe that the automatic stay under Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code does not apply &quot; to its loan , Smith Barney said . Chapter 9 freezes a government ' s assets , protecting them from creditors , but allows the agency to retain control of its money and continue running its government as attorneys and financial advisers untangle the financial mess . But filings like Orange County ' s -- which are extremely rare -- can also lead to a host of fiscal woes , including a ruined credit rating that can prevent local_governments from selling bonds to raise money for public works projects . Some legal_experts believe that even with the Chapter 9 filing , Orange County will not escape lenders , like First Boston , which move to sell the county ' s collateral if loan payments are not made on_time . Officials in cities , school_systems and special districts countywide sought to calm worried staffs and constituents , even as they struggled to come_to terms with an economic landscape that appeared drastically altered . Most city officials said they have sufficient money to meet immediate payrolls , purchase supplies and honor commitments to vendors but expressed concerns about the future , especially if their monies remain frozen for long in the county ' s troubled investment pool . &quot; If this were a household , it ' d be kind of like putting meat and potatoes on the table , but not getting_to have the apple_pie , &quot; said Huntington Beach City_Manager Donald L . Watson . &quot; We ' re asking everyone to batten_down the hatches . We won ' t be spending a nickel we don ' t have to. &quot; Bennett , the county ' s bankruptcy attorney , said ongoing projects that are dependent upon money invested in the fund -- such_as the expansion of the Santa Ana Freeway and the building of the San Joaquin Hills toll road -- may be in more jeopardy . &quot; If the money is invested in the fund , right now , for those large projects , for the time being there won ' t be a distribution , &quot; he said . Asked how long the &quot; time being &quot; would last , Bennett said he was unsure . Rescue Plans Explored Bank of America officials , who loaned the state billions of dollars this year so it could overcome a budget_deficit , are flying from San Francisco to Orange County today to meet with officials from the county and Orange County Transportation Authority . &quot; I think very important resources are coming_forward to help , &quot; said Steiner about the development . Officials in Sacramento and Orange County expressed frustration with each other for not preventing the crisis . County leaders accused state administrators of not coming_to the county ' s aid , despite repeated pleas for loans and even a bailout . State leaders say they were rebuffed in their attempts to help_out . Officials in the state_Department of Finance said it was still too early to tell what aid the state could provide , but suggested one scenario that recently occurred to avert a financial crisis in Merced County . In that case , state officials agreed to let the county defer payments to the state for some programs , most notably a contract with the state_Department of Forestry . Reflecting the day ' s turmoil , bankruptcy lawyer Bennett said : &quot; I really can ' t point to any particular thing that is the next step &quot; in the still unfolding crisis . No hearings are yet scheduled in Bankruptcy Court . &quot; Obviously , we ' re devoting all_of our efforts right now to finding sensible solutions for the ( county ' s investment ) problems , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s the most important thing that I ' m working_on , that ' s the most important thing that everybody else is working_on . The highest priority is forming a plan to get the county out ( of this crisis ) . &quot; Platte and Lait reported from Orange County , Petruno from Los Angeles .
