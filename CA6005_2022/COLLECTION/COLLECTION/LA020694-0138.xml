   <HEADLINE> IRELAND WATCH ; ACCEPTABLE NOWHERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When two senior senators , a_few dozen House members , an ambassador and a National Security_Council official ask that a U.S. visa be issued to a foreigner , it should come as no surprise that the visa is issued . Gerry Adams , head of Sinn Fein , the political partner of the_Irish Republican Army , does not enjoy personal support at that level.He got a visa for his visit last week simply because political progress in Northern_Ireland requires a maximally open political debate . That much granted , nothing that Adams said during his 48-hour visit was as important as what we hope he heard . And what he needed to hear was that there is no Irish American support for any IRA program to bomb the_British out of Northern_Ireland . On that question , Irish America stands with Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds , who said after last year ' s Shankill Road massacre , in which 10 died : &quot; Those who perpetrate such actions have absolutely no mandate from the people , north or south , for their vicious campaigns . Excuses such_as have been put_forward are not acceptable. &quot; Unacceptable in Ireland means unacceptable in Irish America . No mandate there , no mandate here . If Sens . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) did not make that point to Adams while he was here , they should make_it to him the next time they are there . President Clinton ' s decision to grant Adams a visa was a defensible move , but it was also a bitter moment in British-American relations and one can only hope it will prove to be worth what it has cost .</TEXT>
