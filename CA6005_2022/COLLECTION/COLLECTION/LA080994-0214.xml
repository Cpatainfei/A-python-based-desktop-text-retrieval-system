   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; DRIVE-IN THEM WILD ! ; THE CAR CULTURE HAS FINALLY SKIDDED INTO POLAND . AUTO SALES ARE UP , AND THE FIRST OUTDOOR MOVIE_THEATER JUST OPENED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The screen is so small that an announcer has to read the subtitles over a microphone . The projection booth is so bulky that it blocks the best views . And the location is so poorly marked that it is easy to miss entirely . The first drive-in movie_theater in Poland is primitive -- it doubles as the site of a swap meet for used cars by day -- but its debut last month represents a cultural milestone in this country ' s phenomenal rush to the automobile . More_than 500 people , behind the wheels of cars ranging from luxury Mercedes sedans to matchbox-sized Fiats , filed into the asphalt grounds for opening_night in this dusty Warsaw suburb , better known for its bleak high-rises than its cutting-edge culture . The audience was so large that the snack_bar was swept clean of bubble_gum , candy and potato_chips before the film even began rolling . Carside hostesses served complimentary Coca-Cola , but the soft_drinks also dried_up . &quot; If I had more money , I would like to start a drive-in myself , &quot; said Andrzej Jarosz , an awe-struck taxi driver who watched the debut movie -- &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; -- from the same sheepskin-covered seat where he had worked for the previous 14 hours . &quot; This would be a great business. &quot; It was a remarkable scene -- repeated many nights since -- in a country where Communist authorities long restricted the availability of automobiles , compelling some Poles to make payments for a decade before obtaining one . But since the early 1980s , the number of cars in Poland has tripled , and a new market has developed for luxury West European , Japanese and American models , particularly among young , entrepreneurial Poles who have adjusted well to capitalism . The car culture , and the drive-in movie , have arrived . &quot; In the past , most of our customers , about 70 % , would buy a car for pleasure , to drive on the weekend , &quot; said Longin Bielak , a former race_car driver who owns a Peugeot dealership in Warsaw . &quot; Now 70 % buy_it because they need it for business . A car in Poland has become essential for many people. &quot; Thanks also to changes in the post-Communist banking system , many ordinary Poles who previously could not afford a car now have the option of buying one on credit . Almost half of Bielak ' s customers finance their cars . Only top-of-the-line makes , such_as Mercedes , are still purchased on a cash-only basis . &quot; Poles now want their cars to indicate what they are like , say something about them , &quot; said Tadeusz Zakrzewski , head of marketing for Mercedes in Poland . &quot; Our buyers want to accentuate their prestige to others. &quot; Today there are 6.7 million cars in this land of 40 million -- a modest tally when compared with West European_nations but the most in any former Communist country of Eastern Europe . The Polish explosion has caught authorities off_guard , with few highways designed for the increased traffic and parking in big cities relegated to sidewalks , median strips and front_yards . At the same time , police are struggling with a huge increase in car thefts . German models are the most popular but no automobile -- not even the lowly Polish-made Polonez -- is beyond being stolen . &quot; The cars are immediately transported to Russia and other countries to the east , and there is no way of tracing them , &quot; said Bielak , who is also vice_president of a large automobile club in Warsaw . &quot; Every owner of a Mercedes knows his car will be stolen -- the question is when. &quot; The growth in car ownership has been so dramatic that dozens of new service_stations are being built along well-traveled routes , and American fast-food restaurants have plans to open drive-thru windows . International Fast Food Polska , which operates Burger King in Poland , expects to open as_many as four drive-thru restaurants this year . Harry Grindrod , the company ' s president , said the restaurants will be modified to make the drive-thru operation less intimidating for Poles who are unaccustomed to conducting commerce through a car_window . Food orders will be given directly to employees , not via a speaker . &quot; There is a transition going_on here toward the automobile as we think_of it in the United States , not as they did_in the former Soviet Bloc , &quot; Grindrod said . &quot; Drive-thru locations are a natural part of that. &quot; Dariusz Zawislak , a 22-year-old theater hand who came_up with the drive-in theater idea , is equally sold on the concept . In fact , he is so convinced of his compatriots ' new passion for the automobile that he staked his own vehicle on it . Zawislak sold his 1988 Ford to pay his share of the drive-in ' s start-up costs , about $ 10 # 000 . The rest of the expenses are being covered by his partners , a transport company that owns the lot . &quot; Times have changed , and Poles have fallen_in_love with their cars , &quot; Zawislak said . &quot; People my age especially like new cars , expensive cars and fast cars. &quot; If the drive-in succeeds , Zawislak figures he will be able to buy a much nicer car -- and maybe even open another theater . If the venture flops , he will be stuck borrowing his parents ' car , a cramped and run-down Fiat 126P , the smallest and cheapest car in Poland . &quot; The drive-in theater is more of a social_event than just watching a film , &quot; said Zawislak , who ran unsuccessfully in last month ' s City_Council election , pledging to reverse Bialoleka ' s reputation as a cultural desert . &quot; People will treat it as a novelty at first , but hopefully they will like it and keep coming back. &quot; Poles know virtually nothing about drive-in theaters ( including their decline in the United States ) , but they are_well aware of one thing : their reputation as a popular hangout for young lovers . Eager to perpetuate that image , Zawislak and his business partners accepted a donation of 7 # 000 condoms from a Warsaw safe-sex foundation . The prophylactics are being distributed with tickets -- which run about $ 1.50 each -- at the gate . The gag gift brought the expected chuckle from Dariusz Robak , who drives a red sports_car , wears a gold necklace and owns a lucrative freight company . Robak , 25 , arrived_at the theater in his Toyota Supra with his sparingly clad 16-year-old girlfriend and her cousin . &quot; I think I have outgrown doing_it in the car , &quot; Robak joked as he examined the small packet . &quot; Besides , it is only the first show . It is too early to be giving these out. &quot; Zawislak is counting_on people like Robak to make the drive-in a success . Robak has visited the theater twice , even though he confesses he wasn ' t particularly interested in either movie . &quot; I like the idea , and I like cars , &quot; Robak said . As the movie began to flicker on the screen opening_night , Zawislak took_to the microphone to thank Poland ' s first drive-in audience for supporting his dream . The excited moviegoers responded by honking their horns and flashing their headlights .</TEXT>
