   <HEADLINE> MARTINA SETS SIGHTS ON NO . 10 ; WOMEN : SHE IS FAVORED TO DEFEAT MARTINEZ FOR THE TITLE TODAY IN HER SINGLES FAREWELL TO CENTRE COURT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Martina Navratilova , making her final appearance on Wimbledon ' s Centre Court , will play Conchita Martinez today for the women ' s singles championship . The 37-year-old Navratilova , the oldest player in the draw , has made no secret of her feelings for Wimbledon . It is her favorite tournament , her favorite playing surface and her favorite singles title , which figures , because she has nine of them . But it is the lure of a 10th championship that has driven Navratilova from sentimental favorite to simply favorite , with no strings attached . She began the fortnight seeded No . 4 , but as the result of a series of upsets -- No . 1 Steffi Graf , No . 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario -- and Navratilova ' s own improving play , Wimbledon finds itself with an unlikely matchup . &quot; I ' m going_to absolutely enjoy every moment , &quot; said Navratilova , who will make her 22nd appearance at Wimbledon and her 12th visit to the final . &quot; I think it ' s going_to be a happy goodby either way . I ' ll have the chance to win one more Wimbledon . What more can I ask_for ? &quot; In No . 3 Martinez , she will face someone who is_best known for her play_on clay , not grass . Martinez holds a 3-1 edge over Navratilova , but all_the victories were_on clay courts . This is Martinez ' s first Grand_Slam event final , which is one reason the_British oddsmakers have made Navratilova a 4-5 pick . Not since 1928 , when Lili de Alvarez did_it , has a Spanish woman advanced to a Wimbledon final . If nothing else , Martinez has Spanish momentum on her side . Spain ' s Sergi Bruguera and Vicario recently won French Open championships . Meanwhile , Navratilova hasn ' t won here since 1990 , when she defeated then-Zina Garrison for her record-setting ninth title . A victory over Martinez will move Navratilova into a second-place tie on the all-time Grand_Slam singles list . She is now tied with Chris Evert with 18 championships , one fewer than Helen Wills Moody and six fewer than Margaret Court .</TEXT>
