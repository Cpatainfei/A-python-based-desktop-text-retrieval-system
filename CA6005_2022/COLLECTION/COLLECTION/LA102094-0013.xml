   <HEADLINE> THE INFINITE VEGETARIAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; What better vegetarian food is there than that of India ? &quot; asks Neelam Batra . &quot; Indians can cook vegetarian every day of the year and not have to repeat a recipe. &quot; This Santa Monica-based author and cooking teacher is loyal to her native cuisine -- and with good reason , having just written &quot; The Indian Vegetarian &quot; ( Macmillan ; $ 25 ) for those who want to incorporate new flavors in their own meatless cooking . The book is subtitled &quot; Flavors for the American Kitchen. &quot; ' I ' m not aiming at the Indian market , &quot; says Batra . &quot; They know what to do. &quot; Batra includes fusion recipes such_as paneer cheese fajitas ( paneer is Indian-style homemade cheese ) , raita with avocado and toasted slivered almonds , and upside-down basmati rice cake with crispy ginger and onion . She suggests that certain sauces be served over pasta . It ' s a liberal approach that grew out of comments from her students and from her own experiments with the produce she buys each week at the Santa Monica farmers market . * Batra fills her cloth shopping_bags with green and yellow zucchini , lettuce , carrots , sugar_snap_peas , cauliflower , Asian pears , cilantro and whatever else is in prime shape , then incorporates these into Indian-style dishes . Mushrooms go_into grilled-mushroom-and-cheese sandwiches lightly flavored with curry_powder . Apricots , peaches , kiwi and summer berries inspire a fruit_salad seasoned with Indian chaat masala . And purple and gold potatoes wind_up in a saute with dill or cilantro . In addition to these recipes , Batra also includes some for classical Indian dishes , many of them from her family and friends . Born in New Delhi , Batra moved to Los Angeles with her husband 21 years ago . At that time , Indian restaurants were rare in this city . Although she had never formally studied cooking , Batra had watched the preparation of dishes at_home . Her mother had insisted on it . &quot; I tried to recapture all my memories and started cooking , &quot; she said . She did_it so well that a friend suggested she teach . For years now , Batra has taught cooking classes at Santa Monica City College and Montana Mercantile . During lunch at Nawab in Santa Monica , Batra nibbled on grilled shrimp and chicken with saag ( spiced greens ) ; clearly , she is not a vegetarian . Batra had intended to write a comprehensive book including meats , but her publisher wanted the vegetarian angle . That was fine with Batra . &quot; I have a way with vegetables , &quot; she says . * Batra hopes to perk_up the standard American &quot; light &quot; diet ( which relies_on salads and plain steamed vegetables ) with nutritious , flavorful legumes , breads and paneer dishes . In India , paneer is a plain , white cheese , but Batra has come_up with innovative herb and spice-flavored variations . She uses basil-flavored paneer in a tossed green_salad and suggests adding this low-fat cheese to pizza , pasta and stir-fries . She calls it &quot; today ' s guilt-free cheese. &quot; Batra ' s chapter on sauces departs from Indian custom . In India , sauces are part of each dish and are not prepared separately . Western cooks , on the other hand , create sauces to drizzle over food or serve on the side . Batra combines the two approaches with Indian-flavored sauces that can accompany a variety of dishes . Recipes range from classic curry_sauce to a yogurt sauce with caramelized onion that can be used on pizza instead of tomato_sauce . Batra does adhere to some traditions . She came_to lunch dressed in a lacy cotton sari trimmed in burgundy and gold and printed with peacocks , the national bird of India . And , like her mother , she uses a pressure_cooker . As a matter_of_fact , she has five of them . In India , where hospitality is a way_of_life , it is necessary to cook quickly for unexpected guests . Batra recalls her mother would expand a meal in a_few minutes , using the pressure_cooker . Batra uses hers for legumes , curries and even for caramel custard , a recipe included in the dessert chapter . * Although she nibbled with apparent immunity on a slice of raw serrano chile , Batra plays_down the spiciness of Indian cuisine . &quot; Contrary to popular belief , the vegetarian food cooked in homes_in India as well as here is not very spicy , &quot; she said . &quot; And it is not heavy on the stomach. &quot; * Pistachios and almonds add rich taste to this unusual version of spinach salad . Batra credits the idea to Sunil Vora of the Clay Pit restaurant in Los Angeles . FRESH SPINACH SALAD WITH CUMIN-YOGURT DRESSING 1 / 2 cup shelled raw pistachios 1 cup nonfat plain yogurt , whisked until smooth 1 / 2 cup low-fat_milk 2 tablespoons lemon_juice 1 tablespoon ground roasted cumin_seeds 1 teaspoon salt , or to taste 1 / 2 teaspoon freshly ground black_pepper , or to taste 1 bunch spinach , trimmed of tough stems , rinsed and coarsely chopped 1 / 2 cup toasted slivered almonds 1 / 4 teaspoon paprika Place pistachios in small saucepan and add water to cover .

Batra recommends buying whole coriander_seeds -- the slightly green Indian variety -- at an Indian market and grinding them . &quot; Ninety-nine percent of the time , packaged ground coriander does not have much flavor , &quot; she says . BABY ZUCCHINI WITH SPICES 25 to 30 baby green and yellow zucchini , to equal 2 pounds 1 tablespoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon mango powder 1 teaspoon dried mint leaves 1 / 2 teaspoon paprika 1 / 2 teaspoon cayenne_pepper 1 teaspoon salt , or to taste 2 tablespoons oil 2 cups 2-inch julienne strips sweet red and yellow peppers 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro , soft stems included Rinse and dry each zucchini .
