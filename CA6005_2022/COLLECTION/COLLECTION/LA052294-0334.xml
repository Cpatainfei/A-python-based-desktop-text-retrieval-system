   <HEADLINE> BOTH SIDES OF MEXICO DRUG WARS ADORE STOLEN 4X4S ; LAW : A SONG CELEBRATES SMUGGLERS ' ' SUBURBAN OF DEATH. ' SAN DIEGO OFFICIALS DEMAND ACTION TO CURB THEFTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Mexico ' s swashbuckling drug wars , the Chevrolet Suburban rules : It is a getaway vehicle , a status symbol , a war wagon whose mystique blends menace and style . Suburbans , Jeep Cherokees and other U.S.-made , four-wheel-drive vehicles are prized by gangsters and cops , symbiotic warriors who also share a penchant for cowboy_boots , sunglasses and AK-47 assault_rifles . The vehicles that symbolize rugged upscale comfort for Southern Californians have been immortalized in Mexican popular song -- the street poetry of a violent underworld in which drug lords replace the revolutionaries of traditional ballads . In &quot; The Suburban of Death , &quot; the Monterrey-based Pioneers of the North croon about the exploits of two marauding traffickers in a Suburban stocked with machine_guns and high-tech gadgetry . &quot; The Suburban of Death Is what they call it everywhere And Customs and soldiers can ' t stop it When the federales see it , they better beware &quot; Four-wheel-drive vehicles have played a recurring role in a spate of spectacular drug-related incidents in Tijuana . And the new bloodshed has revived an old scandal involving the use of stolen U.S. automobiles by Mexican officials . Mexican federal police unintentionally set_off a public relations bomb this month during their surprise arrest of Baja ' s deputy attorney_general on corruption charges . Televised images showed dozens of raffish-looking federal officers with heavy_weapons girding for combat after a brief confrontation with state police , then departing with the prisoner in a traffic-stopping convoy of Jeeps and Suburbans -- some with California license_plates . When record checks revealed that up_to 30 unmarked police vehicles appeared to have been stolen north of the border , outraged San Diego County supervisors demanded action by the U.S. and Mexican governments . An internal investigation ordered by Mexico ' s attorney_general resulted in_charges against one officer for possession of a stolen Jeep Cherokee . Eighteen other officers have been questioned . &quot; Mexican officials were caught red-handed with the goods , &quot; said Brian Bilbray , a county supervisor . &quot; We have to take_care of this problem . I think all_of us who wanted to encourage free_trade across the border didn ' t mean this kind of free trade. &quot; About 10 % of the 34 # 000 vehicles stolen in San Diego County last year ended_up going south , according to U.S. law_enforcement officials . Some Mexican police allegedly keep confiscated cars for themselves , do business with organized auto theft rings and even send paid enforcers , known as aspirinas , north to steal vehicles , U.S. officials say . The demand for sport utility vehicles in Mexico and Central_America helps explain a low 20 % recovery rate , compared to an overall recovery rate of about 82 % for stolen autos , according to San Diego County ' s Regional Auto Theft Task_Force . U.S. authorities locate about 2 # 400 stolen U.S. cars in Baja each year with the help of Mexican authorities . Nonetheless , Daniel Ryan , an FBI_agent who heads the multi-agency task_force , told a meeting of county supervisors : &quot; Up to 30 vehicles have been seen in and around different ( police ) agencies in Mexico with either license_plates that don ' t belong on them or actually stolen California license_plates . . . . This has been an ongoing problem. &quot; The brazen practice endures despite crackdowns and stern words by authorities in both nations . In 1982 , the director of Mexico ' s now-defunct Federal Security Directorate was indicted in San Diego on charges of running a theft operation that specialized in luxury cars . In 1991 , two top commanders of the Baja California transit police were charged in Mexicali with buying five four-wheel-drive models from their alleged business partners -- professional trans-border thieves . And in March , at a busy Tijuana intersection , two Suburbans carrying an elite team of federal_agents stopped a red Suburban driven by state judicial police_officers . The passengers allegedly included a drug lord and his bodyguards ; they opened_fire , initiating a fierce , close-quarters gunfight that left five men dead and ignited a political conflict between state and federal_governments . The Tijuana shootout also proved quite a shock for the Rogers family of Poway , a resolutely middle-class community northeast of San Diego . During a news broadcast about the incident , the family saw their red 1989 Suburban , which had been stolen two weeks earlier from a restaurant parking_lot and still bore California plates . The vehicle had been transformed into the &quot; Suburban of Death. &quot; The grainy footage showed rivulets of blood , frenzied paramedics , sprawled bodies in the street beneath the open_doors . Machine-gun volleys had shattered windows and shredded metal . Korinne Rogers said the experience was &quot; kind of eerie. &quot; And it left her feeling besieged . &quot; One block in my neighborhood had five different four-wheel-drives stolen in one night , &quot; said Rogers , a mother of four whose family owns a pizza_parlor . &quot; Personally , I ' m getting real tired_of this . Something has to be done. &quot; Among U.S. families , the image of sport utility vehicles is hip , not lethal . Suburbans , Cherokees and Ford Explorers have surged in popularity among that most ubiquitous of trendsetting demographic groups -- affluent young professionals . The vehicles represent a stylish reincarnation of the family station_wagon of yore , according to auto industry_analysts . Ironically , drug runners on both sides of the border , Mexican police and smugglers of illegal immigrants prefer the four-wheel-drive conveyances for similar reasons : powerful engines , an elevated view of the road and ample passenger and cargo space . Reckless smugglers crammed a dozen illegal immigrants into a stolen Suburban that crashed in Temecula in 1992 while fleeing from the Border_Patrol , killing six people . Moreover , the sturdy machines withstand the rough urban topography of Tijuana ( where potholes can resemble small canyons ) and the rural dirt roads of Mexico and Central_America . Despite their popularity , Suburbans sometimes give_way to Jeep Cherokees as the vehicle of choice . The assassins who gunned_down Tijuana ' s police_chief in a highway ambush in April were driving a Cherokee and a Ford Bronco . In San Diego , Jeep thefts have more_than doubled last year ' s average of about 34 a month , jumping to 88 in March . Exasperated law_enforcement experts attribute the rise in Jeep thefts , which has been concentrated along the Interstate 5 corridor , at least partly to the arrival in Tijuana of special Mexican federal police units investigating drug_traffickers and the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio . Some officers are suspected of taking_advantage of their proximity to San Diego to place orders for Cherokees with professional thieves , according to police sources on both sides of the border .</TEXT>
