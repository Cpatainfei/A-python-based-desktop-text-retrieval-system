   <HEADLINE> OUR SECOND ANNUAL : TOURS FOR THE THINKING PERSON ; A LOOK_AT SOME OF 1994 ' S MOST INTRIGUING ' GOAL-ORIENTED ' VACATIONS . THE BOTTOM_LINE : THERE ARE MORE THAN EVER TO PICK FROM , AND COMPETITION IS BRINGING SOME PRICES DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What satisfies a thinking traveler most ? An up-close look_at artifacts worthy of the Smithsonian Institution ? A panorama pulled from the pages of National Geographic magazine ? That first possibility is the enduring hope of Smithsonian officials , who in more_than 20 years of sponsoring escorted tours have built_up to a schedule that this year includes 300 departures to worldwide destinations . The Smithsonian Study Tours and Seminars program , based in Washington , D.C. , anticipates some 7 # 000 passengers in 1994 . The second of those two travel scenarios , meanwhile , has set many gears grinding in the nearby offices of the National Geographic Society . In September , the society dispatched its first-ever escorted tour , an eight-day exploration of Colorado and New Mexico . For 1994 , the On Tour with National Geographic program has scheduled 10 different itineraries , each likely to attract the same stripe of affluent and inquisitive traveler that the Smithsonian program aims for . Thus begins perhaps the most genteel rivalry in the travel trade -- and thus do academically inclined American travelers have more vacation options to ponder than ever before . Want to take measure of rumblings within Costa Rica ' s Arenal Volcano ? Stroll through the philatelic bureau on one of the Falklands ? Ascend by helicopter to a remote lodge_in the Canadian Rockies ? Dig for dinosaur bones in Wyoming ? All are possible , for a price . Costs usually range from $ 1 # 700 to $ 7 # 500 per person ( excluding air fare ) for journeys of eight to 16 days , though some shorter and more affordable trips are offered . The Smithsonian and National Geographic programs are hardly twins . Most obviously , Smithsonian ' s schedule of departure dates is more_than 20 times as long as National Geographic ' s . Beyond that , Smithsonian ' s offerings include more tours that are tightly focused_on a particular theme , often with special attention paid to museums , the arts or natural_sciences . One three-day seminar this spring in Washington , D.C. , will concentrate exclusively on picture_frames in American art . The National Geographic programs , at least so far , suggest a broader approach ; they ' re likely to mix culture with natural_history , and often rely_on scientists and writers associated with the magazine as lecturers . Still , both programs fit into a burgeoning trend in the travel industry : the rise of the goal-oriented vacation -- in which travelers aim not only to escape their daily routines , but to widen their understanding of the world . Museums and university organizations have joined private-sector tour operators in jostling for the attention of such travelers , and many travel professionals expect the &quot; thinking trip &quot; market to get_even more competitive in coming years . ( For some top picks from this year ' s museum- and university-sponsored tours , see related stories on this page. ) &quot; Americans are now well-traveled , and they ' re looking_for more_than the sights , &quot; says Bryan DeLeo , who directs National Geographic ' s On Tour program . &quot; They ' re looking_to learn and experience , to meet local people , and find_out what ' s going_on and what the history is. &quot; One sign of heightened competition , and the struggling world economy , is in the pricing of 1994 ' s tours . Of 98 itineraries listed in Smithsonian ' s catalogue of international tours , 37 are offered at lower prices than in 1993 . Another side_effect of this rush to offer specialized travel , ironically , could be homogenization . As institutions scramble to strike_up alliances with premier local outfitters and international tour operators , they often end_up doing business with the same specialists . In 1994 , National Geographic and Smithsonian are both acting as sponsors of voyages arranged by the tour operator Academic Travel Abroad , Inc. , a Washington , D.C.-based firm that specializes in arranging travel programs for nonprofit groups . It ' s entirely possible that one of these days , groups of Smithsonian and National Geographic travelers may find themselves side_by_side in the same remote body_of_water , seated in canoes operated by the same local concessionaire and reserved by the same international tour operator . Here ' s a quick look_at some of this year ' s offerings from each of these granddaddy nonprofit organizations . SMITHSONIAN STUDY TOURS / SEMINARS The Smithsonian program , which took its current form in 1975 , unabashedly aims for the most educated and often most wealthy travelers , noting in its catalogue the &quot; rather exclusive company &quot; a Smithsonian traveler keeps . The range of subjects and destinations among the Smithsonian ' s 300 or so departures is no less impressive . Even confining yourself to this year ' s river trips , you find among the itineraries the Orinoco , the Nile , the Elbe , the Rhone , the Danube , the Green , the Mississippi , the Hudson , and the Salmon . Most tours , riverine and otherwise , run 7-15 days and cost $ 2 # 000- $ 5 # 000 ( per person , double occupancy , air fare excluded ) . Smithsonian also offers seminars lasting 4-5 days and carrying prices of $ 900- $ 1 # 200 ( per person , double occupancy , air fare excluded ) . Along with the program ' s research expeditions , the seminars are the most thematically focused of Smithsonian tours . The research expeditions feature hands-on experience in rugged conditions , often contributing to research projects in the U.S. and abroad . Seminars are usually unaffiliated with research efforts , but packed with data . On March 14 , for instance , a six-night wolf-tracking expedition begins in Banff and Jasper national_parks , Canada , featuring briefing at the Calgary Zoo , hiking in search of prints and kill sites , lectures from a local wolf biologist , and a demonstration of radio telemetry in wolf tracking . ( Price : $ 1 # 975 per person , double occupancy , air fare to Calgary excluded. ) For travelers seeking a broader focus , Smithsonian offers more_than 100 different &quot; study tours &quot; in the U.S. and abroad , each led by a guide with a specialty in the arts or natural_sciences . Similar tours , but featuring larger groups and lower prices , are available through the Smithsonian Odyssey Tours classification . Among the most affordable trips offered this year : Springtime on the California Deserts , March 12-18 , which includes a briefing by curators at the Palm Springs Desert Museum , guided wildflower and wildlife walks , hiking in Anza Borrego and Joshua_Tree , and cottage lodgings for two nights at a Palm Springs guest ranch near the base of the Santa Rosa mountains . Price : $ 1 # 395 per person , double occupancy , most meals included , air fare to Palm Springs excluded . Among the most exotic trips : Northwest Passage Aboard the Icebreaker Kapitan Khlebnikov , July 20-Aug . 5 , which begins in Anchorage , proceeds via air and iceberg-strewn water through Russian-held islands , Inuit villages , the Bering Strait and various islands above the Arctic_Circle , returning by air via the village of Resolute and the city of Toronto . The ship includes 56 cabins and two helicopters , the better to land on ice-clogged shores . Prices for standard cabins start at $ 13 # 070 per person , double occupancy , including most meals , air fare to Anchorage and from Toronto excluded .

ON_TOUR WITH NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC The idea of the On Tour trip , says program director DeLeo , is to offer programs &quot; that reflect the variety of topics that one finds in reading National Geographic magazine -- some geography , some art , some architecture , culture , natural_history , wildlife and science . . . &quot; The lecturers who lead travelers through these programs usually have strong ties to the magazine . Bill Bryson , author of a 1992 National Geographic article about Europe ' s Main-Danube Canal , in June will lecture a tour group on the same waters . William Graves , editor of the magazine since 1990 , will lecture on a 13-day July expedition to the Aleutian Islands and the Russian Far East . National Geographic tours are marketed most heavily to those who already hold society memberships , and carry prices comparable_to Smithsonian ' s . ( The society counts about 9 million members , each of whom receives National Geographic magazine and pays dues beginning at $ 21 yearly . To take a National Geographic tour , you must become a society member. ) The most affordable tour of the organization ' s Spring-Fall ' 94 catalogue : National_Parks of Utah and Arizona , an eight-day program that includes Zion and Bryce Canyon national_parks and the Grand_Canyon . Lecturers are Otis Imboden , a National Geographic staff photographer from 1962 to ' 82 ( who will accompany the group departing Las Vegas Sept . 15 ) , and Scott Thybony , author of the National Geographic book &quot; Canyon Country Parklands &quot; ( who will accompany the Oct . 6 group ) . Groups sizes are limited to 35 . Price : $ 1 # 680 per person , double occupancy , including some meals , excluding air fare . The most exotic trip in the catalogue is probably a 15-day journey to Irian Jaya , the Spice Islands and Bali , with departures Sept . 16 and Sept 23 . That itinerary includes nine nights aboard a 19-cabin cruise_ship , an introduction to Asmat people , and village visits that feature terraced rice fields and the steaming volcano Gunung Api in the Banda Islands . Tobias Schneebaum , an anthropologist who has lived for several years among the Asmat , is a lecturer . Prices begin at $ 4 # 850 per person , double occupancy , including most meals , excluding air fare . The National Geographic Spring-Fall catalogue includes six different tours ( some are offered more_than once , yielding a total of 12 planned group departures ) . If business goes well , DeLeo says , the 1994-95 Fall-Spring catalogue will probably include 10 different itineraries . For more information : On Tour with National Geographic ; P.O.
