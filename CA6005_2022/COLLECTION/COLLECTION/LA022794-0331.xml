   <HEADLINE> STEEL-FRAME BUILDING CRACKS SPUR WIDER DAMAGE FEARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At least a dozen steel-framed office_buildings -- a type of construction long considered invulnerable to collapse -- sustained deep cracks in their supporting_columns during the Northridge earthquake , raising new and troubling safety concerns . The scope and the unprecedented nature of the failures has shaken the confidence of many engineers and prompted building owners to search for hidden damage in other buildings . The discovery also is expected to trigger a long and costly process of analysis and possibly retrofitting . Steel-frame buildings are designed to bend with the enormous forces of an earthquake without breaking . But just as earlier temblors exposed the weaknesses of unreinforced masonry buildings and stiffly designed reinforced concrete structures , the engineering hallmark of the Northridge earthquake may be that steel-frame buildings , which include the majority of the nation ' s commercial and high-rise structures built_in recent decades , are vulnerable as well , even in moderate earthquakes . &quot; I think it is the issue which potentially could have the most engineering significance from the earthquake , &quot; said John Hall , an associate_professor of civil_engineering at Caltech who headed one of several teams studying the impact of the quake . Worried about alarming people , many structural engineers said it is too early to draw broad conclusions about the relative safety or danger of steel-frame structures . None of the buildings with damage , they emphasize , were anywhere near collapse . They contrast this with reinforced concrete parking structures , such_as the 18-month-old facility at Cal State Northridge that crumpled into rubble . While noting that all_of the damaged steel buildings are less than 10 stories tall , some engineers believe that the cloud-piercing towers in Downtown Los Angeles and Century City &quot; are not as immune to damage as we once thought , &quot; Hall said . But others stress that steel-frame skyscrapers are still thought to be among those least likely to fall , even in a massive earthquake . &quot; We need improvement but the fundamental system is very sound , &quot; said Michael Engelhardt , a nationally known expert on steel-frame buildings . &quot; We can still have a tremendous amount of confidence in steel-framed construction. &quot; Still , structural engineers were troubled to find that the damaged buildings , many of which had crucial welds that fractured and columns that cracked or broke , were generally less than five years old . Several failures occurred in the steel frames of buildings under construction . Damage was found in steel buildings as far as 20 miles from the Northridge quake epicenter and in the types of modern steel-frame designs thought to be safest -- those with so-called moment-resistant frames that are lighter and considered most flexible . About half of all buildings completed last year were of steel-frame construction . At U.S. Borax ' s four-story headquarters in Valencia , 80 % of the connections between the second floor ' s beams and supporting_columns were weakened or pulled apart . Breaks_in the frame of the three-story City_Hall in Santa Clarita halved its resistance to sideways forces , engineers said . In one West Los Angeles building , which engineers declined to identify , steel supporting_columns were reported to have cracked all_the way through . News of steel ' s problems in the quake has sent engineers rushing to Los Angeles to view the damage and stirred a hot phone and fax debate over what went_wrong . The state ' s Seismic Safety Commission will discuss steel buildings at a Burbank meeting Thursday . &quot; If we have finally found the limits of steel , then this will be significant to us , &quot; said Paul Fratessa , an Oakland-based structural engineer and commission member . Los Angeles city building officials said they had learned of the problem Monday . Jim Usui , a structural engineer with the city , said some buildings will be reinspected , and officials will work with the steel_industry to develop any needed code changes . Several steel , engineering and welding groups tentatively have scheduled conferences to examine changes in building_codes , steel fabrication and welding and inspection practices . &quot; Obviously , there is a problem . This wasn ' t supposed to happen , &quot; said Nestor Iwankiw , research_director for the American Institute of Steel Construction , a trade group that plans a mid-March meeting on the issue . &quot; This is the first time this type of failure has been seen. &quot; Engineers in California had dismissed the collapse of a steel frame building in the 1985 Mexico_City earthquake , citing generally poor construction methods there . Now a_few Los Angeles-area engineering firms are sending letters to clients urging them to look_for fissures in the frames of their steel buildings . Engineers said some owners may be reluctant to look closely for damage -- which may require cutting holes in walls and fire-proofing around steel members -- because it is costly and could alarm tenants . Experts said they believe far more steel-frame buildings suffered damage than the 12 or so identified . They said reinspections are turning_up additional buildings with potential problems . &quot; All of these buildings appeared on first inspection to not be terribly damaged . . . which raises the specter that there could be a significant number of other buildings with similar problems , &quot; said Ron Hamburger , a San Francisco-based structural engineer hired to examine one of the damaged steel-frame buildings . Los Angeles structural engineer Nabih Youssef said : &quot; The list of buildings affected is growing. &quot; Although damage was not evident from the exterior of the U.S. Borax headquarters , ultrasonic tests and X-rays showed that more_than half of the beam-to-column connections in the building needed repairs , said spokesman Will Browne . The work will cost $ 5 million and take until July to complete , relegating 200 workers to temporary quarters , Browne said . The most common failure among steel buildings was at the welded connections binding the horizontal beams to vertical steel columns . The metal-alloy welds are supposed to be stronger than the girders they connect and thus are less likely to break . As the welds hold , the beams and columns bend or twist , absorbing the earthquake ' s energy . In the affected buildings , however , some connections became brittle and broke . In some cases , only the welds cracked ; in others , the weld fractures continued into the steel , deeply gouging columns or splitting them . Thomas Sabol , president of Englekirk &amp; Sabol structural engineers of Los Angeles , said the Northridge quake was the first recent earthquake to be centered in a U.S. urban_area and therefore truly test steel-frame buildings . He also said minor cracks caused by previous quakes might have gone unnoticed because they were thought so unlikely that no one looked_for them . Some engineers said one cause for the unexpected failure of steel-frame buildings was the sheer violence of the Northridge quake , which produced unusually high vertical ground motion . Other engineers said state and local building_codes focus_on containing the damaging effects of side-to-side movement rather than up-and-down forces . &quot; We have to tighten_up the codes , &quot; said Egor Popov , professor emeritus of civil_engineering at UC Berkeley . Popov said California buildings ought to be more like Japanese buildings , which are designed to resist greater earthquake forces . That could boost the cost of construction by requiring thicker columns and beams . He also said weld inspection techniques ought to be more exacting to reduce shoddy craftsmanship , and building designers should install more state-of-the-art shock-absorbing systems at the base of buildings . Most experts interviewed by The Times said that steel quality did not appear to be a problem . They tended to blame the frame failures on poorly designed and executed welding . Engelhardt , who tests steel-frame buildings at the University of Texas , Austin , had warned in a controversial paper published in December that current weld designs leave little margin for error and make them susceptible to failure in quakes . Engelhardt , who has made two trips to visit four damaged buildings , said his testing showed that the performance of steel frames is &quot; highly_sensitive to the quality of the welding , which is difficult to control in the field. &quot; Duane K . Miller , an engineer with Lincoln Electric Co . in Cleveland , the nation ' s largest supplier of welding material and equipment , said the welds themselves were less of a factor_in the building failures than overall design . He said the welding and steel_industries are searching for solutions . &quot; We want to preclude this from happening in the future , &quot; he said . Researchers are readying applications to the National Science Foundation for grants to study the shortcomings of steel-frame buildings . But conclusions could be years in coming . Meanwhile , the owners of damaged buildings are trying to get them repaired and reopened as quickly as possible . In the process , some structural engineers said , they are destroying valuable evidence by grinding or melting away welds . MCA Inc. , the Universal City entertainment giant , is repairing damage to a three-story steel-frame building under construction atop a parking structure . The building is scheduled to be completed by midsummer . &quot; It is not economically feasible to make any building a research project , &quot; said Manuel Morden , senior associate of Brandow &amp; Johnston &amp; Associates , engineer for the MCA building . &quot; We cannot wait for the research to come in. &quot; Santa Clarita has embarked_on a $ 4.5-million repair job at City_Hall , and officials hope to reopen the building in April . Also under way are repairs_to damaged columns and welds in a six-story office_building under construction and scheduled for completion next year at the Getty Center in Brentwood . All connections similar to those that were damaged will be retrofitted in five other unfinished buildings at the center , said Getty Trust spokeswoman Ruth Goldway . &quot; We will be confident that the buildings will be safer than ever , &quot; she said . At least one building , however , probably will be torn_down rather than repaired . The two-story , 160 # 000-square-foot Automobile Club of Southern California building in Santa Clarita now leans several inches to one side and toward the back because most of the first-floor columns were severed . &quot; I ' ve never seen a failure of this type . . . and it ' s going_to be quite a task to work_out just what went_wrong with this one , &quot; said David J . Gowers , a Rancho Cucamonga civil_engineer hired to examine the structure . Most structural engineers never thought they would be pondering such problems . &quot; Look_at the old Superman movies , &quot; said Scott Melnick , editor of Modern Steel Construction magazine , an arm of the American Institute of Steel Construction . &quot; Steel isn ' t supposed to crack. &quot; Cracked Frames Buildings with cracked steel frames are being discovered throughout much of Los Angeles County , some far from the epicenter of the Northridge quake . Here are some of the dozen buildings where engineers have observed problems : * AUTOMOBILE CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA Design : Two-story steel-frame building Where : Valencia Boulevard , Santa Clarita Year built : 1992 Damage : General column failure . Building may be torn_down . Status : Damage still being analyzed by engineers . Unoccupied . * THE GETTY CENTER Design : Six-story building , one of six being built to house a museum addition and the administrative offices for the Getty Trust . Where : Getty Center Drive , west of the 405 freeway in Brentwood Year built : Under construction . Damage : Six of 80 joints in the steel-framed building were damaged , one cracked in two . One steel column cracked . Status : Damaged welds and columns are being retrofitted . Building scheduled to be completed next year . * MCA INC . Design : Three-story building under construction atop a parking structure . Where : 100 Universal City Plaza , Universal City Year built : Under construction . Damage : Many of the joints cracks in the steel frame . Status : Scheduled to be completed midsummer . * OVIATT LIBRARY Design : Four-story braced steel-frame building Where : Cal State Northridge campus Year built : 1973 , expanded in 1991 Damage : Joints between supporting_columns and foundation base plates cracked . Status : Building is unoccupied . Reopening date undetermined . * SANTA CLARITA CITY_HALL Design : Three-story office_building Where : 23920 Valencia Blvd. , Santa Clarita Year built : 1987 Damage : $ 4.5 million . Failed welds connecting supporting beams to columns , mostly on the second floor . Sheared connecting bolts . Twisted girders . Status : Building is unoccupied . Due_to reopen in April . * U.S. BORAX , INC . Design : Four-story corporate headquarters Where : 26877 Tourney Rd. , Valencia Year built : 1993 Damage : More_than half the 300 joints in the building ' s steel frame failed , including 80 % of those supporting the second-story . Second floor displaced more_than an inch . $ 5 million estimated damage . Status : Building is unoccupied . Due_to reopen in July . Sources : Structural engineers familiar_with the buildings Quake Cracks Steel Buildings In past earthquakes , unreinforced brick and stiffly designed concrete buildings were considered most vulnerable to collapse . Buildings made of steel were deemed safer , because they tend to bend but not break . The Northridge earthquake shattered those assumptions . Engineers have identified a dozen or more steel buildings as high as 10 stories with badly cracked welds and supporting steel columns . Although they did not collapse , they were seriously weakened . Two types of cracks Fracture near interface of weld and column flange Fracture through column Moment resisting frame A steel moment resisting frame is a rectangular assemblage of beams and columns . The beams are welded and bolted to the columns . Source : Michael D . Engelhardt , assistant_professor of civil_engineering at University of Texas , Austin</TEXT>
