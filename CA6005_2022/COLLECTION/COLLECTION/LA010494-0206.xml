   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : EVIDENCE IN ESPIONAGE CASE RULED INADMISSIBLE ; COURTS : JUDGE SAID COMPUTER TAPES FOUND IN LOCKER OF MAN ACCUSED OF COMPUTER-HACKING CRIMES WERE ILLEGALLY OBTAINED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Key evidence in an espionage case against a former North Hollywood man accused of several computer hacking crimes was illegally obtained , a federal judge ruled Monday . U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte in San Jose said computer tapes found in a storage_locker rented by Kevin Lee Poulsen should not have been examined by prosecutors without a search_warrant and cannot be used as evidence . Whyte had ruled the tapes admissible last month but changed his mind , saying he had overlooked evidence that should have put a police_officer on notice of Poulsen ' s privacy rights . In addition to illegal possession of classified government secrets , Poulsen faces 13 other charges , including eavesdropping on telephone_conversations , and tapping into Pacific Bell ' s computer and an unclassified military computer_network . He could be sentenced to 85 years in prison if convicted of all charges . His lawyer , Paul Meltzer of Santa Cruz , said the sole evidence of the espionage charge is contained on one of the storage_locker tapes . Meltzer said a government analyst found that the tape contained a 1987 order , classified secret , concerning a military exercise . Meltzer said Poulsen maintains that he would not have knowingly possessed military secrets . Poulsen also faces a trial in Los Angeles on charges that he used his computer skills to defraud a radio_station during a Porsche automobile giveaway contest in 1990 . The lawyer said Poulsen , who has been in jail since 1991 , has served enough time to be eligible for immediate release even if convicted of all_the other charges in the San Jose case . His trial is scheduled to start Jan . 14 . Assistant U.S. Atty . Robert Crowe could not be reached for comment . Poulsen , who lived_in Menlo Park at the time of his arrest in the San Jose case , worked in the mid-1980s as a consultant testing Pentagon computer security . He was arrested in 1988 on some of the hacking charges , disappeared and was picked_up in April , 1991 , after a tip prompted by a television_show .</TEXT>
