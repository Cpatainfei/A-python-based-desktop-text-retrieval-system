   <HEADLINE> STATE SENDS SPECIALISTS TO HELP WITH TB OUTBREAK ; HEALTH : EXPERTS ON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES ARRIVE AFTER RENEWED THREAT FROM DRUG-RESISTANT STRAIN THAT HAS PLAGUED LA QUINTA HIGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State experts on communicable_disease arrived in Orange County Wednesday to help county health officials sharpen plans for handling the tuberculosis outbreak at La Quinta High_School . The stepped-up role for the state is_due in part to officials ' belief that 20 people have been exposed to a student who suffered a recent relapse of a highly drug-resistant strain of TB . Almost 200 students and staff_members were already being treated before the new cases started appearing in February . In response to the renewed threat , the county next week will retest most of the Westminster school ' s 1 # 300 students and staff , in an undertaking similar to the massive skin testing completed there last September . Dr. Richard Jackson , chief_of_state ' s division of communicable_disease control , said he sent a physician with expertise in epidemiology and a public health adviser to carefully review the case of Debi French , a senior who in February suffered a relapse of contagious TB although she insists that she was taking her daily medication . French had a strain of TB that is multi-drug resistant . &quot; There is a lot to learn when these medications fail , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; And we need to figure_out where we go from here . . . . We are interested in looking_at the extent of this problem and stopping this outbreak. &quot; Jackson said the state will be acting in an advisory capacity to the County Health_Care Agency , which has primary responsibility for countering the outbreak of tuberculosis discovered last year at La Quinta . Seventeen La Quinta students are being treated for active TB and 175 others , who tested positive for exposure to the bacteria , are receiving medication to prevent their developing the disease . More recently , 18 more students and two staff_members at the school who were in contact with French between December and February , when she relapsed , have tested positive for TB bacteria . There is concern that this makes them vulnerable to the same multi-drug-resistant TB strain that forced French to have part of a lung removed last month in Denver . Dr. Hugh Stallworth , the county ' s chief public health officer , said that at Jackson ' s request he already had decided to devote a physician full time to coordinate the TB control effort at La Quinta . Stallworth said Dr. Jodi Meador , the county ' s TB controller , will head a medical team charged with carrying_out the TB screening and devising a plan for tracking students who are found to have latent or active TB . The county wants to be certain all receive proper medication and follow-up testing to catch any relapses . Since most of the TB cases and positive exposures have been in the senior_class , where the first multi-drug-resistant case was identified , Stallworth said Meador ' s team must devise ways to track graduates who move_out of the area to enter the work_force or attend college . Health officials want to be certain that all cases are monitored by local health agencies and school health organizations to ensure that the patients follow their treatment regimen . Though the Health_Care Agency recently was authorized to fill 29 new positions to cope_with the recent countywide increase in tuberculosis , Stallworth said the agency will be understaffed during the hiring process . He has asked the state_Department of Health Services to assist him in finding physicians with experience in treating tuberculosis who can fill_in temporarily . The state is ready to help . &quot; I want the La Quinta episode to be very closely watched by the local health department , &quot; said Jackson , who has been conferring_with Stallworth on almost a daily basis from his Sacramento office . &quot; I want to have both a physician and epidemiologist focused very closely on this . If they do not have an adequate staff of physicians , I want to help them find the physicians , &quot; Jackson said . Jackson said he also has instructed his staff to investigate the records of the La Quinta outbreak &quot; to see if there are episodes where cases had been medically mismanaged. &quot; One of his concerns , he said , is about a report by the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control that the outbreak at the school might have been prevented if the first case of drug-resistant tuberculosis had been more promptly diagnosed and reported to the county and the patient ' s treatment had been more closely monitored . The state agency will determine whether any physicians should be referred to the state medical board for discipline , he said . &quot; Given the seriousness of this illness , physicians need to adhere to their public health responsibilities , &quot; he said . &quot; You can offer all_the continuing medical education courses you want , but sometimes it is time to be more forceful. &quot;</TEXT>
