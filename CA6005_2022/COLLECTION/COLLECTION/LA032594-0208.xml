   <HEADLINE> ASIA_MINOR ; FISCAL WOES , ETHNIC CONFLICTS UNDERSCORE TURKISH ELECTIONS ; SUNDAY ' S MUNICIPAL VOTE AMOUNTS TO A NATIONAL REFERENDUM ON THE STRUGGLING GOVERNMENT OF PRIME_MINISTER TANSU CILLER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a bank branch along the windy Bosphorus , manager Sema Ozturk has devised a practical response to the high-turnover tumult of Turkey ' s seesaw currency market . Never mind the vault : She keeps a cash box full of foreign currency under her desk . &quot; The head office is bringing_in currency by the planeload . It goes_out just as fast , &quot; she said . &quot; Nobody wants Turkish_lira . Today we had one customer take_away $ 500 # 000 in dollar_bills inside his briefcase. &quot; Down the street , as_many as 200 customers a day frequent Ismail Yucelsin ' s storefront currency-exchange shop . &quot; Even schoolchildren are buying dollars with their pocket_money . Who has confidence in the lira ? &quot; he asked . An almost universal lack of confidence in government fiscal_policies underlines the preeminence of pocketbook issues in preparation for Sunday ' s municipal elections in every city , town and village across this nation of 60 million . Local issues and personalities will also weigh heavily . So will a growing polarization between Turks and ethnic Kurds in an election that amounts to a national referendum on the young , struggling government of Prime_Minister Tansu Ciller . A four-party stalemate seems the most likely outcome . &quot; I think we will see more of the same after the election and a situation that will therefore become more dangerous , &quot; said commentator Cengiz Candar . Nine months after taking_office , the 47-year-old Ciller , Turkey ' s first female prime_minister , is an economist buffeted by national economic alarm . Recession looms . After a decade of strong 5 % annual growth and rapid modernization , production is slowing . The unloved lira has lost 70 % in value against the dollar since January . Inflation may hit triple digits this year . Every Turk is a millionaire , but two new purple 500 # 000 lira notes are worth about $ 40 , compared to $ 1 # 000 six years ago . Massive rejection Sunday of her conservative True Path Party could cost Ciller her job and might force forward parliamentary elections scheduled for 1996 . Polls , though , say True Path , which won power in 1991 , will finish respectably this time . Its candidate in Istanbul , former Mayor Bedrettin Dalan , is running neck-and-neck with Zulfu Livaneli , a movie director making his political debut as a candidate of the center-left Social Democrats . The Social Democrats and the True Path are coalition partners in national government in Ankara , but there and in other major cities their competing mayoral candidates face stiff challenges . The center-right Motherland Party , which directed ' 80s modernization under the late Turgut Ozal , and the Welfare Party , an Islamic movement with a fundamentalist fringe , should profit from the government discomfiture . Critics score Ciller ' s inexperience and lack of decisiveness on bringing government spending under_control . They also fault her for not enacting a broadly approved privatization program whose receipts might have helped balance the government ' s books . Once the votes are counted , analysts believe , the headstrong armed forces will launch a major campaign against Kurdish separatist guerrillas . By some published accounts , at least 350 # 000 troops are massed in the southeast , where brutal anti-insurgency policies have brought international condemnation of Turkey for human_rights abuses . Ciller ' s opponents charge that she has abdicated authority to the generals in confronting unrest among Turkey ' s 12 million Kurds . The United States and Turkey ' s European allies support the drive against terrorism , but they urge that underlying issues of Kurdish cultural and ethnic aspirations be addressed on political and social levels . So far there has been no sign of that . If , as expected , the election delivers no strong mandate to Ciller -- or fails to reinforce her opponents ' calls_for change -- Turkey may drift closer to stormy seas .</TEXT>
