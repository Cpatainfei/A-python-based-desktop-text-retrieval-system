   <HEADLINE> A WORD FOR JUSTICE AT INDONESIA ' S TRADE SUMMIT ; HUMAN_RIGHTS : CLINTON ' S VISIT COULD SHED_LIGHT_ON THE GENOCIDAL OCCUPATION OF EAST TIMOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When President Clinton meets with President Suharto of Indonesia during the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference this week , he should not overlook the haunting situation in East Timor . It is normally extremely difficult to focus public awareness on the former Portuguese colony near Australia , which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 . Perhaps one-third or more of a population of 700 # 000 have perished as a consequence of a harsh Indonesian occupation . But President Clinton ' s trip , which includes a state visit in Jakarta on Wednesday , provides a unique opportunity to highlight a tragedy that refuses to go_away . Nov . 12 marked the third anniversary of the massacre at Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili , the capital of East Timor , where Indonesian troops killed hundreds of mourners and demonstrators at a funeral commemoration -- a scene recorded by a journalist from British television . These shocking images were seen by millions of people throughout the world . Immediately thereafter , a 26-year-old East Timorese student , Fernando Araujo , tried to contact Amnesty International to provide them with information about the Santa Cruz massacre . For this and other nonviolent acts , Araujo received a a nine-year prison sentence . Araujo was also charged with having discussions on how to bring East Timor to the attention of the international community . Still another charge involved sending a letter to former President Bush likening the Indonesian occupation of East Timor to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait -- not an inaccurate comparison , but a dangerous one to make in Indonesia . It is also perilous for courageous Indonesians who dare to speak out on the East Timor situation . Last month , I attended an international conference in Portugal with Dr. George Aditjondro , a respected scholar and environmentalist who has done firsthand studies on the Timor situation . The last night of the conference , Aditjondro received a summons from the Indonesian police for interrogation about comments he made during a university panel_discussion on the future of Indonesian politics . Amnesty International believes that this was an attempt by authorities to punish Aditjondro for his criticism of government policy on human_rights and environmental concerns in Indonesia and East Timor . In recent weeks , Aditjondro has been interrogated for many hours by police about the university panel_discussion . After one five-hour session , he became ill . President Clinton should intervene with Indonesian authorities with the aim of ensuring that such harassment is ended and that Araujo be released . These two courageous individuals are only the tip of the iceberg . People further down in society , lacking international networks of support , suffer much worse . I have had my own experience with the lengths Jakarta will go_to muzzle criticism . It pressured allies in the region , such_as the Philippines , to prevent a conference on East Timor from taking_place in June . Upon arrival in Manila for the conference , after 18 hours of travel , I was summarily deported by the Philippine authorities , under obvious pressure from Jakarta . The Catholic Bishop of East Timor , Carlos Ximenes Belo , has inspired me as he speaks out courageously for truth , justice and in defense of human_rights in spite of death threats . The bishop is trying to find ways to end the conflict through support for dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations , in accordance with the principles of international_law . He deserves the backing of the United States . As we have learned in my home country of Northern_Ireland , it is only through all-inclusive dialogue and the cessation of all violence that we can begin to solve our problems together .</TEXT>
