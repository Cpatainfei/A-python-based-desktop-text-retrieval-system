   <HEADLINE> ARMENIAN PRESIDENT GETS ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME ; POLITICS : LEVON TER-PETROSSIAN , COUNTRY ' S FIRST POPULARLY ELECTED LEADER , ARRIVES ON A MISSION TO STRENGTHEN ECONOMIC TIES WITH U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first popularly elected leader of an independent Armenia arrived Sunday for a three-day visit with political and business_leaders in Southern California -- home to one of the world ' s largest Armenian communities . Levon Ter-Petrossian , who was elected in 1991 after Armenia gained its independence for the first time in 600 years , is_on a seven-day visit to strengthen economic ties between his embattled republic and the United States . Ter-Petrossian met with President Clinton and made stops in Boston and Detroit before arriving here , where he was greeted by hundreds of well-wishers as well as Mayor Richard Riordan and other dignitaries . His arrival touched_off cheers , shouts , whistling and applause that lasted from the moment he stepped from his private jet until he got_into his limousine . He was given armloads of roses by two students from a Hollywood Armenian school who had waited or over an hour on the boiling Tarmac , clad in ankle-length traditional dancing dresses of red and green velvet . Ter-Petrossian and his wife , Ludmila , made a brief midday visit to a Westside Armenian church . He addressed about 10 # 000 Armenian Americans on Sunday night in a 90-minute speech at the Los Angeles Convention Center , in which he outlined recent economic reforms in Armenia and declared himself impressed that so many Armenian immigrants here want to learn more about their native country and its recent independence . Wherever he went , the political_leader , who is also an expert in the authenticity of ancient texts , was greeted as a hero by Armenians , for whom he embodies the centuries-long dream of independence . Among those who braved 100-degree-plus temperatures at the airport were John and Rose Ketchoyian of Sherman Oaks , whose grandparents were among more_than 1.5 million Armenians killed by the Turks between 1915 and 1923 . The U.S.-born Ketchoyians , like many Armenians , have strong emotional ties to the country of their forebears . &quot; Whether it was hot or cold , we ' d still be out here , &quot; John Ketchoyian said . &quot; Armenia is trying to get established as a country and we ' re here to support him the best we can. &quot; &quot; Armenia is our country , &quot; said Rose Ketchoyian , adding that she would go there &quot; at the drop of a hat &quot; to assist in its recovery . Ter-Petrossian ' s trip comes during a cease-fire in the conflict with adjacent Azerbaijan that has crippled the Armenian economy . Although not officially at war , Armenia has supported the breakaway of the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan . That conflict has claimed more_than 15 # 000 lives . In retaliation , Azerbaijan shut_down oil_pipelines and overland trade_routes that Armenia depends_on . If the July 27 cease-fire agreement holds and peace can be achieved , officials hope those lifelines can be reopened so the country won ' t have to endure another brutal winter with only an hour or two of heat and electricity each day . Moreover , peace would set the stage for Armenia ' s industrial renewal , generating opportunities for foreign investment . Krikor Greg Tashjian , of Glendale , said he has been receiving upbeat reports on the situation from his brother , a government energy official in Armenia . Tashjian said his brother thinks very highly of Ter-Petrossian , who he said is &quot; the right man for the mission &quot; of rebuilding the former Soviet republic . Many said Ter-Petrossian has pushed for privatizing farms and industries despite the war , the blockade and the devastating 1988 earthquake , which forced the shutdown of the nation ' s nuclear plants out of safety concerns . But economic aid will be needed to reopen Armenia ' s nuclear plants and rebuild its industries . On this trip , Ter-Petrossian and his delegation met with officials from the World_Bank , which agreed to help restore the country ' s irrigation system and its reactors .</TEXT>
