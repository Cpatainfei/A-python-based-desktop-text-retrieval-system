   <HEADLINE> THE NBA / MARK HEISLER ; DON ' T MOCK THESE DRAFT PICKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the finals demonstrated , this league could use some new stars , some new personalities . Here come the candidates to be one or the other or both . &quot; In a league that lost Michael Jordan , Magic Johnson and Larry Bird , the question is who is going_to replace them , &quot; Indiana Pacer General_Manager Donnie Walsh said . &quot; Shaq ( O ' Neal ) has been pushed into the forefront , but I don ' t know if he can handle it . These kids may be more of how the league wants to be represented. &quot; we ' ll see , won ' t we ? Here ' s how it looks before Wednesday ' s draft ( heights are barefoot , and on that basis , Hakeem Olajuwon is really 6 feet 10 and Charles Barkley 6-4 1 / 2 ) : 1 . Milwaukee Bucks -- Glenn Robinson , 6-7 , 240 , Purdue . Chicago Coach Phil Jackson says , &quot; I don ' t think he ' s the greatest thing since sliced bread , &quot; but admirers think the Big Dog is the closest thing we ' ve seen to Bird since Bird . He ' s a Big quiet Dog though . In school , he often didn ' t talk after he ' d had big_games . 2 . Dallas Mavericks -- Jason Kidd , 6-3 , 215 , California . Admirers -- such_as Johnson -- think he ' s the best point guard prospect since Johnson . The Mavericks are sticking_with him despite an arrest in a hit-and-run traffic case and word of a civil suit . 3 . Detroit Pistons -- Grant Hill , 6-8 , 230 , Duke . Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski says anyone who passes_on him will feel_like Portland for passing_on Jordan in ' 84 . Hill is a Scottie Pippen type who can play either guard or small forward but is bigger than Pippen and a better shooter than Pippen was at this stage . Wonderful young_man with a glowing personality . David Stern must be burning incense under his picture . 4 . Minnesota Timberwolves -- Donyell Marshall , 6-8 1 / 2 , 218 , Connecticut . They like Juwan Howard , too , but they don ' t think Christian Laettner can guard small forwards . They take this big-time prospect , even if he did have a shaky NCAA tournament . 5 . Washington Bullets -- Howard , 6-8 1 / 2 , 253 , Michigan . They ' re delighted to take the Wolverine power forward , a true grinder who has already promised not to hold_out , saying he needs to be in camp early , making him the general_managers ' early candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize . 6 . Philadelphia 76ers -- Sharone Wright , 6-10 , 279 , Clemson . The 76ers get an athletic power forward to finish_off their front_line of 7-7 Shawn Bradley and burly Clarence Weatherspoon . 7 . Clippers -- Lamond Murray , 6-6 1 / 2 , 236 , Cal . They are reportedly offering this pick and Mark Jackson to Dallas for Jamal Mashburn , but if it doesn ' t happen , they ' ve always needed a shooter . He would also be insurance in case they don ' t sign Dominique Wilkins , a growing possibility . 8 . Sacramento Kings -- Brian Grant , 6-8 1 / 2 , 247 , Xavier . He dialed his draft status up about 10 spots in postseason camps . 9 . Boston Celtics -- Eric Montross , 7-0 1 / 2 , 275 , North Carolina . They exhale after he gets past Sacramento and jump_on him . NBA scout Marty Blake , whose chief job is to hype the draft , compared Montross to Greg Dreiling , but most people think he ' s a lot better than that . 10 . Lakers -- Khalid Reeves , 6-1 1 / 2 , 205 , Arizona . Some people think he ' s the next Joe Dumars , a heady , strong guard who can play both spots . Jerry West wisely forgets about need and grabs the best player . Maybe some day they can get a high pick and do_it the easy way . 11 . Seattle SuperSonics -- Aaron McKie , 6-4 1 / 2 , 216 , Temple . With Bob Whitsitt gone , George Karl loath to get involved in personnel and Wally Walker newly arrived in the front office , they would rather trade the pick for a big man . 12 . Miami Heat -- Eric Mobley , 6-10 1 / 2 , 259 , Pittsburgh . Sophomore Yinka Dare was supposed to go_in the lottery , looked bad in workouts , refused to visit here , thinking he was going higher , and keeps falling . 13 . Denver Nuggets -- Jalen Rose , 6-6 , 231 , Michigan . They want a point guard . He ' s a weird player , but he can handle the ball and has a boss-type personality . He could hit big or miss completely . 14 . New Jersey Nets -- Eric Piatkowski , 6-6 , 214 , Nebraska . He wowed them at the Desert Classic in Phoenix . They ' re still looking_for a shooter to replace Drazen Petrovic . 15 . Pacers -- Tony Dumas , 6-4 , 178 , Missouri Kansas City . Little-known guy with big-time talent and question-mark head . You can just hear Larry Brown telling Walsh : &quot; I can work with him ! &quot; 16 . Golden State Warriors -- Jim McIlvaine , 7-1 , 244 , Marquette . Don Nelson is telling people he ' s no good , which suggests something . They really want to deal for a big player -- Will Perdue and the Bulls ' pick ? 17 . Portland Trail Blazers -- Wesley Person , 6-5 1 / 2 , 192 , Auburn . Chuck ' s brother , quieter and , with a career 44 % mark on three-pointers , the best shooter in the draft . 18 . Bucks -- Carlos Rogers , 6-10 , 214 , Tennessee State . Unpolished but athletic . Big haul for Mike Dunleavy . 19 . Mavericks -- Dare , 6-10 1 / 2 , 271 , George_Washington . Incredible hulk but doesn ' t react to the ball . In NBA terms , that ' s like saying your pupils don ' t dilate when they shine a light in your eye . With one solid pick in the bank , the Mavericks have a shot to take . 20 . 76ers -- Eddie Jones , 6-6 , 190 , Temple . A talented wing player who could have gone 10 picks higher . 21 . Chicago Bulls -- Greg Minor , 6-6 , 228 , Louisville . Averaged 13 a game as a senior but made all-star teams at Portsmouth and Phoenix draft camps . 22 . San Antonio Spurs -- Charlie Ward , 6-0 1 / 2 , 184 , Florida State . Texas ' B.J. Tyler is regarded_as the second-best point guard in the draft , but he had a drinking problem and new owner Robert ( Call Me General ) McDermott likes them squeaky clean . 23 . Phoenix Suns -- Dickey Simpkins , 6-8 1 / 2 , 245 , Providence . Power forward who was all-tournament at Portsmouth and Phoenix . 24 . New York Knicks -- Monty Williams , 6-7 1 / 2 , 227 , Notre Dame . A Lafonso Ellis type , he would have been in the lottery except for a heart problem . Williams has been cleared by doctors , but that kind of thing scares pro teams . The Pacers considered him , but after he took a physical for them , they were so alarmed they scaled back their drills . 25 . Clippers -- Cliff Rozier , 6-10 , 260 , Louisville . On talent , he would have been in the lottery , but his work ethic isn ' t up_to snuff . Hard to pass_up this far down the line , though , with one pick in_hand . 26 . Knicks -- Dontonio Wingfield , 6-7 1 / 2 , 246 , Cincinnati . He ' s either the second_coming of George McGinnis . . . or Jesse James . After finishing high_school in Albany , Ga. , Wingfield tore_up his mother ' s kitchen ( reportedly because she would n ' t let him use the car ) and she called the police . He pleaded guilty to two counts of obstructing justice and one count of criminal damage to property . He enrolled at Cincinnati but quit after his freshman year . Knick personnel chief Ernie Grunfeld notes that there was a lot of gossip about Shawn Kemp too , and the Knicks have a pick to waste . But this guy and Pat Riley ? I don ' t think so . 27 . Orlando Magic -- Tyler , 6-0 , 173 , Texas . The Magic wants to trade Scott Skiles and use his $ 1.7-million slot to pursue Horace Grant and will need a backup point guard . THANKS FOR COMING , DOMINIQUE WILKINS It was incredible six months ago when the Clippers sorted through all_the packages they were being offered for Danny Manning and chose the 34-year-old Wilkins . Wilkins came_to town , charmed everyone , averaged 29 points his first month , drew a big crowd or two and even got the Clippers on a brief roll . But when they failed to come_up with the money he thought he was about to get -- $ 21 million for three years -- he went_into a funk that engulfed the franchise . The amazing thing is that both sides agree that the Clippers knew his asking price before the trade . Their first offer , however , was $ 8 million for two years . Subsequently , they tacked_on the extra year he wanted . . . but dropped the offer to $ 7.5 million plus annual $ 800 # 000 bonuses for making the playoffs . A Clipper official insists they remain eager to sign Wilkins , but his agent , Steve Kauffman , is telling people privately they aren ' t even trying . Wilkins has few options . Kauffman says he might sit it out until a new labor_agreement is signed , which could raise the salary cap -- now at $ 16 million -- above $ 20 million . Another possibility is making the rounds : the Knicks . They need firepower . They might have Rolando Blackman ' s $ 2-million slot . Wilkins might work for short money for a season to get_out of here . In case he does , farewell to yet another great Clipper .</TEXT>
