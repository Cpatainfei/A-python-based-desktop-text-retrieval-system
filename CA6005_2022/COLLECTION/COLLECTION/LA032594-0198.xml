   <TEXT> For years , Frederick West and his family appeared to live a rather ordinary , even dull , English life at 25 Cromwell St. , in a three-story row_house on a quiet , working-class street . Then the police went searching for West ' s 16-year-old daughter , Heather , who the Wests said ran_away seven years ago . They found her body buried beneath the back yard patio . And , the more they looked , the more they found , uncovering the remains of eight more women . Now West , a 52-year-old construction worker , is in Her Majesty ' s Prison here , charged with nine murders dating to 1977 . And there may be more . The digging continues , and police plan to move later to a house around the corner where West lived with his first wife and their 12-year-old daughter . Police have been unable to locate them . No . 25 Cromwell St. , already dubbed by Fleet_Street the &quot; House of Horrors , &quot; has joined the most notorious addresses in Britain ' s rich serial murder lore . It is the rare Briton , indeed , who cannot identify 10 Rillington Place as the home where John Reginald Halliday Christie strangled 12 women from 1943 to 1953 , or 195 Melrose Ave . as the place where Dennis Andrew Nilsen strangled or drowned most of his 15 young male victims from 1978 to 1983 . And who can forget the ones who got_away ? Jack the Ripper slit the throats of five prostitutes in London ' s East End in 1888 , touching_off a debate over his identity that continues to this day . And Jack the Stripper was a psychopath who killed seven prostitutes in London in the 1960s . For the_British , a_people proud_of having one of the world ' s most civilized societies , uncivilized murder has long captured the national imagination . Although this country of 50 million people counts only about 600 homicides a year , about the rate in New York City , it has a remarkable history of serial_killers , one surpassing any other country in Europe and one well tended by Britain ' s tabloid press . &quot; There ' s no question that Britain has been bedeviled by these characters over the years , &quot; said Anthony Busuttil , a professor of forensic medicine at Edinburgh Medical_School in Scotland . &quot; These things have become almost part of the folklore of our country. &quot; Back in 1946 , in an essay titled &quot; Decline of the_English Murder , &quot; George Orwell acknowledged the pleasure that he and his countrymen received from reading about the ultimate crime in the comfort of their drawing_rooms . A really good murder , Orwell wrote , would take_place &quot; in a semi-detached_house , which will allow the neighbors to hear suspicious sounds through the wall. &quot; The perpetrator would be a little man &quot; living an intensely respectable life. &quot; Orwell also lamented a decline in juicy cases from what he called &quot; the great period in murder , our Elizabethan period , so to speak , &quot; from 1850 to 1925 . But even as he was writing those words , John Christie was ushering_in a new era of homicide at 10 Rillington Place . Barbara Amiel , the_British author of the 1977 book &quot; By Persons Unknown , &quot; suggests that it is precisely her country ' s civility that denies psychopathic killers an outlet for their urges . In less civil societies , such_as Stalin ' s Russia or Hitler ' s Germany , there is &quot; legitimate room for the ambitions of deranged people , &quot; she wrote recently in the Sunday Times of London . And in Britain , &quot; the notion of people who seem to behave just like us , with the exception that they are carefully carrying_out the murders of other human_beings , is quite riveting , &quot; she says . &quot; Part of our attraction to horrible murders is , I think , our need to get a good shudder. &quot; The events at 25 Cromwell St . have certainly given the_British public , and people around the world , a good shudder . One reason is the setting , a quintessentially English community on gentle hills 100 miles west of London . Gloucester is one of England ' s treasures , a place of tea shops and abundant history where Beatrix Potter set her children ' s story , &quot; The Tailor of Gloucester. &quot; Gloucester ' s 100 # 000 residents trace their roots back 2 # 000 years , to the city ' s founding as an outpost of the Roman_Empire . William the Conqueror built the first castle here , in 1068 , and Henry_III was crowned 200 years later at St . Peter ' s Abbey , a glorious church that still stands as the center of a strong tourist business . Buried beneath the abbey is the body of Edward_II , the victim of , yes , a murder in 1327 . The West family house is a drab , narrow and , as Orwell seemed to have predicted , semi-detached home whose occupants seemed to be respectable people . About the only thing that sets No . 25 apart from other houses on Cromwell Street is the window_frames , which West painted a grass-stain green . The neighborhood , next to Gloucester ' s tidy downtown , is what the_British call a &quot; bedsit , &quot; because many residents rent rooms to students and others seeking temporary , low-cost shelter . The Wests too rented part of their house to boarders . In fact , at least one of them , Shirley Anne Robinson , 18 , was found in the soil beneath the house . She was , say the London papers , &quot; heavily pregnant &quot; at the time of her death . The case began late last month with a tip to Gloucester police about the disappearance of Heather West , prompting them to obtain a search_warrant for the house , where they began looking_for her body . Neighbors and relatives said Heather , one of Frederick West ' s 10 children , had been missing since 1987 and that the Wests said she had run_off with a friend . West , a short , burly man with a head of curly black hair , was arrested a day after the search began . &quot; I didn ' t kill her ! &quot; he shouted as he was escorted away . Police tore out the patio stones that West had installed in his 60-foot back yard , then used ground-penetrating radar to detect what turned_out to be the skeletal remains of Heather and Robinson , buried four feet below the surface . Then the remains of a third woman , in her 20s , was found . West ' s basement floor was removed , and 12 days after the search began , nine sets of remains had been found . His wife , Rosemary , was questioned and released ; her attorney says she knew_nothing and was &quot; deeply shocked and upset. &quot; Bernard Knight , 62 , a professor of forensic medicine at the College of Medicine at the University of Wales in Cardiff , has been brought_in to study the remains . In the history of British murder , Knight is something of a legend . The author of several crime novels in the 1960s , including &quot; The Thread of Evidence &quot; and &quot; The Lately Deceased , &quot; he is known to enjoy &quot; murder parties &quot; at which guests act_out and solve whodunits . Knight has taken the remains to his laboratory , where it will be weeks before he is able to determine the identities of the victims or the causes of death . The 70-member investigative team is fielding dozens of calls daily from worried families of missing persons ; nearly 100 of those believed to have been lost have been located -- alive -- through public appeals stemming from the case . Publicity about the hunt in West ' s yard has led to reunions of loved ones in at least 80 families . Soon , the police will take their shovels to 25 Midland Road , where West once lived with his first wife , Rena , and their daughter , who are still missing . Then they will dig_into a vacant field outside of town , where the special radar detected irregularities . Understandably , many Britons wonder how so many people could simply vanish . For years , locating missing people fell to charitable groups rather than police . Scotland_Yard only recently established a missing persons department . Four police investigators have been assigned to answer the never-ending questions from the media . Daily headlines scream of scoops in the case , using catch phrases such_as &quot; Garden of Death &quot; as well as the more common &quot; House of Horror. &quot; In their battle for circulation , some papers have published appeals_to people who knew West , hired him to do_work on their houses or have photographs of him to contact them . David Canter , a professor of psychology at Surrey University and author of a book on serial_killers , defends Britain ' s curiosity about 25 Cromwell St. , arguing that ghoulish cases &quot; can refresh our understanding of what it means to be human. &quot; When the world ' s media &quot; no longer think a ' house of horrors ' is a newsworthy story , that will be the end of civilization as we know it , &quot; he wrote recently in the Sunday Times . For Terence Morris , a criminology professor at the London School of Economics , the Cromwell Street case fits the serial_killer profile . Virtually all such criminals in Britain ' s history have been men . Their victims , often single and lonely , usually lived_on society ' s margins . &quot; People in that category are vulnerable , &quot; Morris said . &quot; These are the people who can disappear and not be missed. &quot; But Morris said this case has elements that make_it different . Most of Britain ' s serial_killers have tried to dispose_of their victims ' bodies . Dennis Nilsen , who is serving a life prison_term for killing 15 men , was discovered only when his victims ' dismembered bodies blocked the sewer_system . John Haigh , hanged_in 1949 for killing eight women , dissolved his victims ' bodies in acid . &quot; It ' s a matter of considerable criminological interest to find multiple sets of human remains , &quot; Morris said . &quot; I can ' t recall a case quite like this one. &quot; If more bodies are found , the case could become the worst serial killing in British history . Nilsen ' s 15 victims are the highest toll , followed by those of Peter William Sutcliffe , the Yorkshire Ripper , who killed 13 women during a five-year spree in the late 1970s . Sutcliffe is in a mental_hospital . Much of the interest in the West case has been generated by the appearance of normality on Cromwell Street and the lack of an identified motive . &quot; The feeling is that it could happen on anybody ' s street , &quot; said Russell Trott , a local reporter for BBC-TV . &quot; People feel close to it , without actually visiting it. &quot; But visit it they have , by the hundreds . Some have handed bouquets of flowers to police guards , who dutifully place them against the front of the house . Others have their pictures taken with the house in the background . When one of the street_signs was stolen as a souvenir , police removed the wrought-iron black number plate on the front of the house . &quot; It ' s just such a major topic of news , &quot; said Zoe Slatter , 23 , explaining why she and two friends came , with their cameras , from 45 miles away . Rumors and questions spread through the neighborhood and across the pages of newspapers , fed partly by police reluctance to reveal too_much about the case . Were the Wests , as some suggest , into kinky sex parties ? Does the house have a mirrored room and pornographic videotapes ? The police call the rumors &quot; pure speculation. &quot; &quot; We ' re just keeping an open mind , &quot; police spokeswoman Hilary Allison said . &quot; We went_down initially looking_for one body , and now we ' ve found nine . We don ' t know what else we ' ll find. &quot; In Gloucester , which averages fewer than two homicides a year , &quot; this is a rare event , &quot; she added . &quot; We mostly deal with burglaries and car thefts. &quot; West ' s attorney , Howard Ogden , has complained that the news coverage is making_it impossible for his client to get a fair trial . But Ogden himself has posed for photos in a London tabloid and once advertised his services on radio with the slogan , &quot; If you ' ve been nicked ( arrested ) , call Oggie. &quot; He got the West case because , at the time of West ' s arrest , he was the &quot; on-call &quot; lawyer for the county , a duty for which he regularly volunteers , he said , to make ends meet . On Cromwell Street , opinion on West is freely offered and frequently divided . &quot; He ' s a sick , perverted man , &quot; said Liz Steadman , 22 , who lives three doors down . &quot; We ' re all just sickened , disgusted. &quot; Chris Brothwell , a 23-year-old neighbor , remembers West had helped him a_few weeks earlier , when Brothwell locked himself out of his apartment . West brought a ladder and they broke_into one of the windows . &quot; He was helpful enough , pleasant enough , &quot; Brothwell recalled . &quot; But this isn ' t the kind of street where people usually mix with each other . It ' s scary to know some guy lived here for all these years and was bumping people off. &quot; At the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints in a small , one-story house next to 25 Cromwell St. , Robert Bennett , a church elder , said the pastor had invited West to services many times , but West had always declined politely . &quot; This is a consequence of something that ' s gone_wrong in this world , &quot; Bennett said . &quot; This is really a close-knit community . But I saw something in the eyes of all_the people who have come here . It was total disbelief . The people here will never be the same. &quot;</TEXT>
