   <HEADLINE> NORTH-SOUTH SPAT IMPERILS MUSEUM PLAN ; LEGISLATURE : PANEL BLOCKS FUNDS TO BUILD A NEW SCIENCE SHOWCASE IN L.A. SOME SAY THE MONEY IS MEANT FOR LOMA PRIETA QUAKE VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Until two weeks ago , the construction of a new $ 45-million Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles seemed an absolute certainty . But that was before the war between North and South broke_out in the state Legislature . That was before questions were raised about why money earmarked for earthquake repairs after Northern California ' s Loma Prieta quake was being used to build a new structure . ( And in Los Angeles , no less , the place known to much of Northern California as the predatory metropolis to the south that steals football_teams and other valuable assets. ) That was before legislators who had voted for the museum in 1992 suddenly balked last month at appropriating the money to build it . And the drama is still unfolding , as state legislators in Sacramento wrestle with the subject in budget hearings . A decision is expected as early as next week . The stakes in this fight are high . The museum is seen as an important cog in the redevelopment of the Exposition Park area , home of the Coliseum . Local legislators talk_of the jobs the project will create and then about how stalling on the money question seems vindictive on the part of Northern California politicians . &quot; It ' s definitely a North-South question , &quot; said Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson ( D-Los Angeles ) , one of the key backers of the project . &quot; We ' ve answered everything over and over and over again . I don ' t understand why the questions keep cropping_up , and it ' s getting_to be very frustrating. &quot; The legislators from the North counter by suggesting there is a bit of chicanery in the wind here , that money designated for one use is being spent on another . &quot; What California citizens voted for was to protect themselves from entering buildings which would be unsafe during earthquakes ; they voted against being in deathtraps . But most emphatically , they did not vote to misuse money to raze a historic museum simply so that a new and larger one could be constructed in its place , &quot; said Sen . Nicholas Petris ( D-Oakland ) . The controversy over the construction of the museum -- plans for which have been in the works for four years -- began May 25 , when state Sen . Quentin Kopp ( I-San Francisco ) persuaded a Senate budget committee to rescind all $ 45 million earmarked for the project . * In doing so , he pointed_out that the money for the museum was coming from a $ 300-million pot approved by voters in the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . He contended that money obviously intended for earthquake repair in Northern California should not be used to build a new museum in Southern California . A particular sore point : The $ 45 million was the largest single appropriation from the fund . Museum Director Jeffrey Rudolph defends using the money for a new museum . It may be in Southern California , but he said the project meets all_the requirements of the law . Rudolph said he had been so confident of the budget committee ' s approval that no one from his staff had even attended the budget session that day . He learned what had happened when a supporter in Sacramento called later in the day and said , &quot; Guess what ? &quot; &quot; We really weren ' t prepared_for it , &quot; he said . &quot; While some concerns had been expressed in other hearings , we thought we had answered the concerns of the senators. &quot; The controversy surrounding the museum centers_on two buildings that have been closed to the public since 1990 -- the Ahmanson Building and the Armory , both more_than 80 years old . In 1987 , the Legislature authorized the preparation of a master_plan for Exposition Park , where the Museum of Science and Industry is . In 1990 , as part of the plan ' s preparation , architects examined both buildings and concluded that they would be unsafe in an earthquake . Further , they said that because more_than 1 # 000 children visited the museum each day , the risk of keeping the buildings open was heightened . So , in June , 1990 , both buildings were closed to the public , though the staff still has its offices in the armory . Four months after the closure , voters passed the 1990 Earthquake Safety and Public Building Rehabilitation Bond Act . The act was in response to the Loma Prieta earthquake . It was designed , in part , to repair several severely damaged state buildings in Oakland and San Francisco . But the act did not specify a designated geographical_area . And it also said the money could be used to either repair or replace buildings that were unsafe in an earthquake . * In their quest_for funds to replace the closed buildings , museum officials began looking_for what sources might be available . They hit upon funds from the bond issue . Even if such use was unintended , the view from Los Angeles was that the wording of the law perfectly described the museum ' s status . In 1992 , state Sen . Teresa Hughes ( D-Inglewood ) introduced legislation calling_for the replacement of the museum and asked that the funding source be the building rehabilitation bond act . The bill sailed_through both the House and Senate . Among those voting for it were Kopp and Petris . Petris said he did not believe at the time that the plan was to raze the two buildings . He said he thought the idea was to restore them . &quot; I wasn ' t thinking_about having two historical buildings torn_down , &quot; he said . &quot; The proponents are interpreting it as knocking_down buildings and building new ones . I personally think it ' s a bad idea to destroy those two buildings. &quot; Rudolph , the museum ' s executive_director , said bids for the demolition of the two buildings were to be opened later this month . He said the plans , which were approved by such groups as the Los Angeles Conservancy , had been a matter of public scrutiny for years . &quot; It wasn ' t snuck through , &quot; he said of the bill authorizing the new museum . &quot; It was not a last-minute amendment to get the money. &quot; State Sen . Diane Watson ( D-Los Angeles ) , another proponent of the museum , said she understood much was now being made of tearing_down two historic buildings . But she called it a specious_argument because of conservation organizations having signed_off on the project . &quot; I hear there is some concern that Los Angeles is taking the lion ' s share of money that we don ' t deserve , &quot; she said . &quot; I think it ' s retaliation for the Raiders and other personal gripes. &quot;</TEXT>
