   <TEXT> Ten weeks before today ' s season opener , on a hot Los Angeles afternoon , the lobby of the Century Plaza hotel is humming with people who look_like they ' ve arrived_at more_than a convention . Here they come , striding purposefully in dark- suited teams of three or four , a blur of teeth and cuff links , slim briefcases and heels , the men and women who own , manage or sell time for the stations of the no-longer-upstart Fox network . At this summer ' s affiliates meeting , there is excitement and tension in the air , and not just at the prospect of next season ' s episodes of &quot; Melrose Place &quot; or the thought of what an earthquake might feel_like . This is more about what the NFL is going_to feel_like on each of these fine Rupert Murdoch-fed stations . Don ' t you know it ' s going_to feel good ? At least for a while . At first , the presence of the National Football_League on Fox on Sunday is going_to feel wonderfully strange and , well , newsworthy , or a helluva lot more newsworthy than &quot; Models Inc. &quot; or even &quot; The Simpsons. &quot; If you ' re one of those in_attendance at the Century Plaza , chances are that for seven months you ' ve been looking in the mirror every morning and repeating the mantra : &quot; NFL . NFL . NFL. &quot; Maybe you pinched yourself to make_sure you weren ' t dreaming and then shouted , &quot; Playing with the big boys now , you damn betcha ! &quot; If , on the other hand , you are not an employee of Fox or one of its stations and are old enough to remember the Korean_War , it ' s quite possible you assume the NFL was in part created by and for CBS and that Fox is television ' s version of the Mustang Ranch , and you therefore view this whole deal as the newest proof that everything is worse than it used to be . Even for the believers , there is , of course , the_matter of whether this will work in the numbers department or end_up as the biggest cost_overrun since the B-1 bomber . Last year , Murdoch , desperate to get a major sports franchise for his overmatched network , outbid CBS by roughly $ 400 million , paying $ 1.58 billion for the four-year rights to the NFL ' s big-dog NFC division ( Cowboys , 49ers , Giants ) and dunning the affiliates $ 30 million a year to help defray the cost . The estimates by some market_analysts that losses could amount to as much as half a_billion over four years are cause for a_few skipped heartbeats in the privacy of the rooms upstairs . But if any of the affiliates are nervous on this day , all they have to do to fortify themselves is take a good , long look_at the comforting figure of John Madden , who is_on the premises most assuredly for that very purpose . Coach ! There he is ! The beloved pitchman and CBS telestrator commentator , big-footed American hero of the interstate , the blue-collar pope of professional_football himself has come_along in Murdoch ' s bargain as the ultimate insurance that no one will be able to laugh_at football on Fox with John Madden calling the plays . &quot; We wanted John , we needed John , &quot; says a Fox executive . &quot; Back in January , the press was asking , ' Will we see Al Bundy in the booth ? Will we see Bart Simpson ? Is this the end of Western civilization as we know it ? ' &quot; Earlier in the day , Madden gifted the affiliates with a luncheon pep talk , but now he is camped in an upstairs lounge , nursing a diet Coke and recalling the dark December day when the unthinkable happened . &quot; It was a Friday afternoon . And I was going_to Detroit to do the 49ers , &quot; says Madden , who is conspicuous in these surroundings not just because of his 250 pounds but because he ' s dressed in a droopy blue warmup suit with a lavender baseball_cap pulled_down on his head . &quot; And I was_on my bus , and I got a call and someone told me that Fox might get football . And I assumed that Fox would get football , but that they would get a part of it . Like when ESPN came_in with a Sunday night_game , and TNT came_in with a Sunday night_game . The NFL would give ' em a little piece . And then they said CBS was going_to get_out of it , and I said , ' Nah , never happen. ' I laughed it off. &quot; CBS , after all , had been broadcasting the NFL for 38 years . &quot; And I got another call_in the bus , telling me that Fox got_it . I still didn ' t believe it . I got_into Detroit , got_to the hotel , and all_the production people were there , and Pat , and we ' re sittin ' around , and the word started comin ' in and we got the official announcement that Fox had the NFC and we didn ' t have anything . None of us saw it comin ' . No one . I told ( former player and commentator ) Matt Millen , who called me in Detroit , it was like an old drill we used to use in football called ' bull in the ring. ' You put one guy in the ring , and then you number all_the players around the ring , 1 through 10. &quot; Madden is pointing now , just like on television , and his mouth is picking_up steam . &quot; Coach calls_out ' 2 ' , and the guy ( 2 ) comes running_out , and you have to hit him . Then he calls ' 5 , ' and he comes running_out , and you ' d have to turn and hit him , you know ? &quot; &quot; I told Matt , that was like playin ' ' bull in the ring , ' and the coach calls ' 2 ' and 10 comes ! &quot; Boom . Is this a match ? John Madden and Fox ? A FEW WEEKS LATER , MADDEN IS BACK IN LOS ANGELES . HE IS WEARING A coat and tie this time , seated on a stage in a ballroom at the Universal City Hilton , where Fox is introducing its 1994 lineup to the nation ' s television critics . Onstage with him , sitting in a row between some faux Roman columns , are Fox Sports President David Hill ; Ed Goren , Fox Sports executive producer for the NFL broadcasts ; Tracy Dolgin , executive_vice_president of marketing , and second-string play-by-play man Dick Stockton . There is a big-screen TV overhead , which has just exploded in a reel of loud , frantic Fox football commercials , in which Green_Bay Packer defensive end Reggie White is seen crushing quarterbacks in a series of quick cuts , followed by Madden hurtling down the highway in his bus to a tune modeled after Chuck Berry ' s &quot; Johnny B . Goode. &quot; At the end of the reel , Hill walks to a podium , looks_out to his audience and proudly utters three words : &quot; Rock and roll. &quot; Dolgin steps_up , and with a pointer and some video charts as a visual aid , promises the critics &quot; the biggest media blitz in sports history &quot; to get America ready for the NFL on Fox . He also vows that Fox will &quot; grow the NFL audience. &quot; Then Goren takes_over and gets his biggest response from the critics when he reveals Fox ' s plan to air regular &quot; anti-violence &quot; messages from leading NFL players . Many of the critics break_into laughter . The irony evidently is lost on Goren . As is his manner on occasion , Madden deflects a pointed question about violence in the game and returns to a less dangerous part of the field , choosing to decry the league salary cap and its effect on player movement . &quot; I have trouble seeing Joe Montana in a Kansas City uniform , &quot; he says about the former 49er quarterback . &quot; And Reggie White should always be a Philadelphia Eagle. &quot; No doubt there are those who feel the same way about John Madden no longer wearing a CBS blazer . &quot; You ' ve got new and different , and you ' ve got the same , &quot; Madden said earlier , pondering the change this season for him and his 14-year sidekick , former New York Giants end and place-kicker Pat Summerall . &quot; Every time you think you got the same , you look and say , ' Ooohh , it ' s new and different. ' And every time you think it ' s new and different , you say , ' Now , look , it ' s the same. ' &quot; Madden perhaps can be expected to accentuate the positive since Fox is paying him about $ 8 million a year ( three times his CBS salary ) to do what he has always done , that is , to be himself : the average guy ascended to a throne of wisdom . And he wasn ' t going_to be able to be himself on CBS anymore unless he wanted to start narrating golf or the Winter_Olympics . Which would n ' t have been the real John Madden , he says . Anyway , with the heartache of leaving CBS behind him -- Summerall compared it to a death in the family -- Madden is now making more_than any player in the league , an achievement that can be seen as a mark of television ' s final takeover of the NFL . As the former coach of the &quot; renegade &quot; Oakland Raiders , an infrequent ( as in never ) flier and all-around Earthman , Madden is what passes for unorthodox in the culture of the NFL and so matches up somewhat with Fox ' s perception of itself as an outlaw network . But he is also 58 , a fierce traditionalist about an increasingly glitzoid game , and he does not eat breakfast to the sound of Guns N ' Roses . He ' s a no-nonsense guy going_to a network that to many has so far been little but nonsense . Take a glance at some of the MTV-inspired promotional spots for Fox football and try to imagine Madden designing them , not to mention diagramming them . Or take Fox ' s assembly-line slogan : &quot; Same Game . . . . New Attitude. &quot; Not the sort of hype you expect from the lips of the truth-telling coach -- not counting , of course , when he ' s in front of a camera hawking some product . There would appear to be some potential for cultural dissonance between man and network . Here ' s how the Fox press guide describes the improvements planned for the Fox broadcasts : &quot; 12 manned cameras , two of which are dedicated for super slow_motion replays , and eight tape_machines , with two designated for super slow_motion replays . By comparison , a typical lead regular season NFC broadcast last year had eight cameras and no more_than six tape_machines . The mobile production truck from which ( producer and director ) will work is the Super Shooter 12 , housing a state-of-the-art Grass Valley 3000-3 switching system and the Abekas A-51 digital effects unit. &quot; In addition , they ' ll be broadcasting in Dolby Surround Sound with four parabolic microphones picking_up the raw sounds of combat at the line_of_scrimmage . Here ' s the way Madden describes these improvements : &quot; We have a new truck , and I think we ' re gonna have some more cameras. &quot; Of the many un-Madden innovations in the NFL over the years ( artificial turf , TV timeouts , coaches calling the plays ) Madden reserves a special distaste for the &quot; luxury boxes , &quot; the corporate penthouses that now ring the NFL ' s newer stadiums . &quot; I just cringe when I go_by and see them , &quot; he says . Fox ' s one-hour pregame show will include a feature called &quot; SkyBox , &quot; in which a glamorous woman reporter , Lonnie Lardner , will chat with Hollywood celebrities about the game in a simulated luxury box . The names &quot; Jack &quot; and &quot; Spike &quot; are mentioned . Madden distances himself from all this , saying simply , &quot; The difference is going_to be in the pregame show , showing more players , more faces . Getting_to know the player better . The different stuff will happen before the kickoff . Then when you get_to the game , once they kick it off , you cover that . You cover the game . We ' re not getting five downs or anything . It ' s going_to be the same game. &quot; And he will still be John Madden . He will still travel between game cities on his customized Greyhound bus , as he has done since abandoning Amtrak in 1986 and jetliners before that . He is getting a new bus this season that is five feet longer than the old one . &quot; I have everything I need . It ' s got four television_sets , all with VCRs . I watch game tapes more_than anything . It ' s got telephones and faxes. &quot; Most of the time , Madden travels alone , except for two drivers . His wife of 34 years , Virginia , a retired schoolteacher and former bar owner , rarely joins him . ( His son Joe , 28 , oversees Madden ' s production company ; son Mike , 31 , is in real_estate development. ) As he ' s explaining all this , a smiling man with a camera , who happens to be vice_president of sales for a Fox affiliate on the East Coast , butts_in and wants his picture taken with the new voice of the NFL on Fox . Madden has no choice but to comply , yet he is clearly not pleased , especially when the fellow asks Madden to call him for dinner when he ' s next in town for a game . &quot; that ' s not my favorite thing to do , &quot; the former coach says when the guy is gone . &quot; that ' s not my favorite thing . I ' m not very good at that. &quot; AFTER MURDOCH SHOT THE LIGHTS OUT AT CBS SPORTS LAST DECEMBER , Madden almost went_to ABC to join &quot; Monday Night Football. &quot; He also considered an offer from NBC , which is still going_to carry the NFL ' s AFC games ( Raiders , Oilers , Broncos ) . In the end , he went_to the highest bidder ; it wasn ' t just the money , it was the chance to be the marquee player in a whole new sports department that only has one sport . &quot; I ' m not a television guy or some_other sports . I ' m just football , NFL football . And that ' s all Fox is. &quot; In fact , the hub of Madden ' s broadcast team has simply moved intact to Fox in a forced migration from CBS . In addition to Summerall , he ' ll have the same producer , director and stage_manager , plus some of the same cameramen and audio people . Goren , his executive producer , is also a CBS man . As Summerall says , &quot; I won ' t be saying , ' Stay tuned for &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; and &quot; Murder , She Wrote. &quot; ' That much will be different. &quot; No , he ' ll be telling viewers to stay tuned for the animated comedy &quot; The Simpsons , &quot; which Fox is moving to Sunday night to take_advantage of the NFL lead-in . Maybe this will not be so odd . To some , Madden himself is a cartoon character , the excitable guy who , in the ' 70s , used to race up and down the sidelines as the pink-faced coach of the Raiders , squeezed into polyester pants and a golf shirt , flinging his arms skyward in protest or celebration . Then he literally busted through walls and other barriers into all those Miller Lite commercials in the ' 80s , leading choruses of &quot; Tastes Great ! -- Less Filling ! &quot; He ' s done so many commercials -- for Ace Hardware , Krylon spray paint , diet Coke , Tinactin foot powder -- he finally built his own $ 750 # 000 Jumbo Studios near Danville , his Northern California home , where he can tape them without having to leave town . Yet in ad-crazy America , the commercials have done nothing to dent his &quot; credibility &quot; as a football analyst and , anyway , he will always have his bucketful of Emmys and coaching record with the Raiders to fill_out his resume . It is a great record -- 103 wins , 32 losses , including a Super Bowl victory in 1977 . So many of the men who get paid to narrate football games , be they career broadcasters like NBC ' s Dick Enberg or ex-athletes like ABC ' s Frank Gifford , are almost interchangeable in their earnest attempts to seem respectable , to offend no one . Madden , on the other hand , while he has not courted controversy , has remained the NFL ' s star commentator by refusing to polish his jock talk . On the air he prefers to rip and snort his way to gridiron insight as though still in the locker_room , strangling sentences in mid-thought because of his urgent need to get_on to the next one . This is what is known as being yourself , but in his view , being yourself can be , well , a difficult thing . &quot; I mean , bein ' yourself is never one thing , &quot; he says . &quot; You have a lot of different selves . Which John Madden ? There ' s a very serious John Madden , there ' s a light John Madden , there ' s a coach John Madden . that ' s the thing . It ' s not as simple as bein ' yourself . I think that bein ' yourself has to go deeply . &quot; If you ' re going to commercial , and you ' re bein ' yourself , it ' s all good stuff , but you ' re off the air . You say , ' I ' m going_to be myself , ' and some guy ' s sayin ' , you know , ' Seven , six , five , four . . . two , one . . . . ' Now I ' m really myself ! Well , hell , you ' re . . . it ' s a difficult thing . Which self ? And then bein ' a self within a framework of short spurts of time and not bein ' able to think_about what you ' re gonna do but react and bein ' ready for everything because you don ' t know what ' s gonna happen . Some people don ' t have enough confidence to do that. &quot; Boom . Madden ' s penchant for candor has led him to criticize aspects of the current game , from the epidemic of bad tackling and showboating to the corrosive effect of big money . &quot; It ' s going_to be hard to build_up ( fan ) loyalties with free_agency and all_the movement ( of players ) , &quot; he reasons . &quot; The owners can send a player off , and a player can leave on_his_own , but the fan has to stay there and take it . that ' s the reality of it , it ' s not going_to change . But I don ' t think it ' s good. &quot; Money is hurting the game in other ways , he believes . &quot; See what happened , when they started raising ticket prices and gettin ' luxury boxes and stuff , you started eliminating kids from going_to the games . that ' s bothered me for a long_time . Ever see a crowd at a Super Bowl ? Count the kids at a Super Bowl . Count the football fans at a Super Bowl ! Those things bother me. &quot; Now , here ' s an unfit-for-Fox thought : The money that has flooded into the NFL during the past 25 years , bringing glitz and cowgirl cheerleaders and changing the game and leading to player movement and higher ticket prices and keeping the kids out of the stadiums , has come , as it has in baseball , largely from television -- that is , from the billions NFL teams make from the sale of broadcast rights . Television , which made John Madden into the wealthy American folk hero that he is , has also been responsible_for tainting the game he loves . Has he ever stopped for a moment to mull this over ? He doesn ' t miss a beat_in not answering the question . &quot; The next generation , growing_up with computers and video_games , &quot; he says , &quot; to get those kids , you ' re going to have to let ' em play_along on television , &quot; with the kids interactively calling their own shots . &quot; Murdoch is committed to this . that ' s how we ' re going to get the kids . You can ' t get ' em back in the ballparks. &quot; WITH ONE WEEK TO GO BEFORE THE FIRST FOX NFL GAME , A PRESEASON match between the San Francisco 49ers and the Denver Broncos , the heat is_on at Fox Sports headquarters on the KTTV lot in Hollywood . The whole idea of the NFL on Fox is such a novelty to the press that TV sports critics from around the country are closing_in from every side . &quot; It ' s interesting being a bug under a microscope , &quot; says David Hill . Hill , a hearty Australian who reminds you a little of Robin Leach and pronounces the name of the game futbull , has spent the last six years in London producing cricket and soccer matches with great success for Murdoch ' s Sky Sports . He has been busy today cleaning_up some graphics problems , color keys and studio lighting requirements . &quot; It ' s the last_frontier of reality in television , &quot; the new Fox Sports president says fervently about the appeal of TV sports . &quot; As sitcoms and other programs become more interchangeable , in sports you still have an uncertain outcome . It ' s not necessarily the guy in the white hat that gets_to kiss the horse at the end . It ' s undeniably real. &quot; What ' s also undeniably real is that despite some flashy high-profile shows , Fox has suffered a two-year decline in its ratings overall , attracting 7.2 % of the nation ' s 94 million TV households last season , down from 7.7 % in 1992-93 . It needs the NFL , even at an initial loss , as an engine to propel its other programming and its 180-odd stations toward critical mass and top advertising dollars . The acquisition of the NFC games already has helped the network add 12 stations in important markets and has convinced Madison Avenue that this year will be better . &quot; When Fox got the NFL deal , &quot; says Paul Schulman , a Manhattan-based buyer of network time for major advertisers , &quot; it was credibility to the highest degree . People who in the past perceived Fox as the up-and-coming network changed their thinking to say , ' We now have four networks. ' &quot; Still , a TV sports franchise is no guarantee of success . CBS claims it was losing money under its NFL contract and most definitely lost money when it paid $ 1.6 billion for the rights to major-league baseball . And CBS was not trying to establish a network at the time . &quot; I think you ' ll see the Fox numbers come_across pretty strongly , &quot; Schulman says . &quot; I don ' t know if they will match identically the numbers that CBS got a year ago when they averaged a 13 rating , but I think Fox will be darn close . And remember , it ' s Year 1 , and Fox is growing. &quot; It ' s the first network sports department to be based in Los Angeles , and as Hill hustled to create it from scratch in six months , he was struck by the suitability of his new home . &quot; I ' m seeing an inter-pollination between a straight-down-the-middle sports production guy and a cameraman or paint-box operator or whatever who ' s just come_off doing ' seaQuest ' or something. &quot; Fox is not alone in trying to put a hip-hop step_in TV sports . Check_out the music-video-like promos for &quot; Monday Night Football &quot; this season , or give your eyes and ears a 10-minute workout in front of the heavy-metal assault and graphic distraction of ESPN2 , the new cable sports channel presumably designed for the sensory impaired . Hill has assured the NFL that Fox will not trivialize the game while enlisting more advertiser-attractive young people to watch it . &quot; The NFL has not had promotion in prime_time , &quot; he explains . &quot; We said to the NFL , ' Look , what we ' ll do is that , because we have a lot of young kids watching , we will promote it differently. ' So that ' s where the tag ' Same Game , New Attitude ' came from . So that ' s been the whole thrust of what we ' ve been about : getting kids who if no one told them it was exciting . . . . &quot; While he does not have an office here , Madden ' s presence is heavy in the air at Fox Sports , his name invoked with the gravity that would be accorded royalty . Ed Goren stretches the Madden mythology beyond the realms of devotion . ' He ' ll tell you that all he cares about is football . But he ' s -- I don ' t know if he ' s a Will Rogers -- he ' s a great observer of people , &quot; says Goren . He turns_around in his seat and points to a watercolor print of an adobe_house in the desert . &quot; If I brought 10 people in to look_at that painting , 10 people would see the obvious in it , whatever the obvious is in that painting . John would see the obvious and then beyond . that ' s what makes him so unique. &quot; John Madden , art critic ! Who would have known ? It brings_to mind the possibility of a Fox spinoff modeled after the late John Candy ' s impersonation of Madden in a TV sketch in which the coach rambled through the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York furiously tracing explanatory diagrams over the surface of Rembrandts and Da Vincis , just as he diagrams plays_on television . &quot; I Know What I Like : John Madden and the Art of the NFL. &quot; ON FRIDAY , AUG . 12 , ORIGINATING from Candlestick Park in San Francisco , the NFL on Fox indeed comes_to pass . Game time for this meaningless warm-up contest between the 49ers and the Broncos is 5 p.m. , to fit into prime_time in the East and Midwest . By 2 p.m. , the silver-and-white Madden Cruiser is already parked next to the stadium . At 2:40 p.m. , the door of the bus swings open , and Madden , wearing tan slacks , a blue blazer and a tie , descends . Accompanied by his agent , a Fox publicist and stadium security personnel , he is ushered through a gantlet of snapping cameras to Gate D and up_to the booth where Summerall will join him . At 3:55 , two black Lincoln Towncars edge their way through a small crowd on the stadium ' s perimeter drive and stop outside the Fox press shed . The doors open , and out of the second car steps Rupert Murdoch , with his wife , Anna , followed by Chase Carey , chairman and CEO of Fox Television Group . Murdoch , wearing a gray pinstriped suit , cranes his head to take_in Candlestick , as if he ' s thinking , &quot; So I own this now too. &quot; Considering the enormous sum he has spent for the rights to the NFC and the projected losses over four years based on that sum , a reporter asks , by what means would he measure his football venture a success ? &quot; It ' s already paid_off , &quot; he says , claiming that the network as_a_whole is $ 150 million ahead in total advertising sales from this same time last year . &quot; And our stations have increased in value $ 400 to $ 500 million from before we had football. &quot; Jay Nelson , a Wall_Street broadcast analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. , is more skeptical . &quot; I don ' t have access to all_the numbers , but in my view , his acquisition of the NFL rights was more of a defensive act than an offensive one . They had hit the wall_in their ratings prime_time . A guy like Murdoch figures if you ' re not attacking , you ' re retreating , and he figures with his other endeavors , he could afford to take the risk of a $ 100-milllion-to- $ 200-million loss . He ' s going_to make statements forever that they ' ve made_it back in such and such , but who can measure ? &quot; Back in the press trailer , Murdoch takes a_few more questions about what football means to Fox , offers a quip about Madden ' s salary , and then the baron of Fox is gone , presumably on his way to a very good seat . Time for the show . On TV screens , a montage of helmeted NFL warriors along with electric_guitars and the voice of Madden rise through an echo chamber as if out of a primeval gridiron mist : &quot; It doesn ' t get any better than this &quot; marks the beginning of the Fox era in the NFL . After the kickoff , the first thing that looks different is a little graphic strip in the upper left of the screen bearing the game clock and the score . It will stay there throughout the broadcast , recalling the same device used in the World Cup soccer matches . On the air , Madden points it out , commenting : &quot; You can go_away and come_back , like if someone ' s cooking dinner or somethin ' , and you ' ll always know what the score is . Or you could use the clock to cook the roast by. &quot; The 49ers score quickly , after quarterback Steve Young completes his first seven passes , prompting Madden to say , &quot; If you had to start a team today with one guy , I don ' t know that Steve Young would n ' t be the guy. &quot; The much discussed line-of-scrimmage audio is noticeable , but mainly it seems to intensify the sound of the referees ' whistles and the jagged crowd roar while picking_up the occasional &quot; get ' em &quot; from a defensive player . The game is simply louder on the screen . Also noticable is the recurring Fox graphic , a cubic logo that shouts &quot; Fox / NFL &quot; as it washes the screen between slow-motion replays and live action . Near the end of the first_quarter , when 49er defensive end Richard Dent pops somebody pretty good , Madden says &quot; boom. &quot; The moment does not go unnoticed by the history-conscious Fox publicity personnel . &quot; Let the record show that the first Fox ' boom ' from Madden came at 5:35 p.m. Pacific_Time , &quot; one of them sings out happily . It becomes apparent that one thing has not changed , and that is the way Madden makes his way effortlessly through a game , displaying a scholar ' s knowledge of both teams , their histories and tendencies . &quot; The San Francisco running game , &quot; he says matter-of-factly , &quot; is not a beautiful thing. &quot; Could Frank Gifford say something that true and simple ? The coach reveals an immediate affinity for rookie 360-pound Bronco offensive tackle Kevin Farkas but also has the thought , which he shares with viewers : &quot; How would you like to be the bench , and here comes Farkas ? &quot; Boom . Between plays , a Fox camera brings_in a beautiful close-up of the moon , and Madden expresses his wonder by saying , &quot; Do you believe the cow ever jumped over that thing ? &quot; In the trailer , Vince Wladika , head of Fox Sports media relations , is ecstatic . &quot; I can ' t believe I work for this guy ! Is he great ! &quot; The 49ers win the game without much opposition from the Broncos , the final score 20-3 . It is all_over at 7:55 . For David Hill and company , champagne is probably on ice somewhere in the immediate vicinity . There have been no major glitches -- at least none apparent to viewers . Fox has broadcast an NFL game , and the NFL does not seem substantially altered by the experience . On the other hand , maybe the shock will not fully register on the NFL ' s aging television constituency all at once . Maybe it will take until opening day and beyond for fans to realize that this was a little like what Madden said about the &quot; bull in the ring &quot; drill . Seemed like coach was always calling_out CBS , ABC or even NBC , but damned if it isn ' t Fox coming at you now .</TEXT>
