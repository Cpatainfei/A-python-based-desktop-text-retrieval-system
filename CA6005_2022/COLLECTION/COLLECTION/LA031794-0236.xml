   <HEADLINE> RABIN OPEN TO PALESTINIANS JOINING POLICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to restart the Middle_East peace talks , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin hinted Wednesday that his government would let Palestinian patrol officers join police_forces in cities and towns throughout the West_Bank -- but only under supervision of Israeli military authorities . Although the suggestion stopped far short of the Palestine Liberation Organization ' s demand that Palestinian police take_over law_enforcement responsibilities in Hebron , Rabin said he is prepared to negotiate over other security measures for the occupied territories -- if the PLO returns to the bargaining table . Rabin said his government might be willing to add Palestinian patrol officers in Gaza and Jericho . He made his remarks in a news_conference with President Clinton after the two leaders met Wednesday in search of ways to get Middle_East peace talks under way again . Although the White_House meeting focused_on ways to restart Israeli-PLO negotiations , Clinton and Rabin said they also discussed steps to produce a peace agreement between Israel and Syria . Early indications were that Rabin ' s offering to the PLO failed to impress its leader , Yasser Arafat , who watched the televised news_conference at his headquarters in Tunis , Tunisia . Moments after it ended , Reuters news_agency quoted Yasser Abed-Rabbo , PLO chief spokesman , saying : &quot; We are disappointed by Rabin ' s position . The Israeli government did not respond in any positive way to our demands , and ( this ) leads us to a kind of a deadlock. &quot; A U.S. official said later that the Administration will brief Palestinian leaders soon by telephone to try to persuade them that Rabin was more forthcoming than he may have appeared . The most recent round of Israeli-Palestinian talks has been aimed at resolving Palestinian self-government issues left unfinished by the historic peace agreement signed by the bitter enemies last September on the White_House lawn . The PLO abruptly broke_off the discussions last month after an Israeli settler opened_fire in a Hebron mosque with an assault_rifle , killing about 30 Palestinians . Arafat has since demanded steps to protect Palestinian civilians as the price for resuming the negotiations . Although Rabin did not announce any measures tailored to meet PLO conditions , he assured Clinton that he is ready to negotiate the issue once the talks resume , said a senior U.S. official who attended the talks . The official said Rabin acknowledged &quot; that something has to be done about the security environment , that something has to be done so the Palestinians will feel secure. &quot; Recalling that about 900 Palestinian patrol officers had been included in West_Bank police_forces before they resigned en masse at the start of the intifada , the Palestinian uprising , Rabin said a new Palestinian police presence could be worked_out -- but only if the ultimate control remains with Israel . &quot; You can ' t separate armed groups , &quot; Rabin said at the news_conference . &quot; There must be one chain of command of those who have to keep and maintain law and order. &quot; Police throughout Israeli-occupied territories , he said , &quot; have to come under the control of the government , and the government is the military government of Israel. &quot; At the same time , Rabin said Palestinians can assume complete police responsibility in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho just as soon as Israel and the PLO agree on all details for interim Palestinian self-government in those jurisdictions . &quot; If by now agreement had been reached , by now there would have been 8 # 000 , 9 # 000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; The more the negotiations are postponed , the longer it will take them to come. &quot; After the news_conference , a U.S. official said Rabin emphasized that Israel will address PLO demands only in negotiations , not as bait to lure the Palestinians back to the table . Rabin told Clinton that if he made concessions without a commitment to resume the talks , &quot; these would be pocketed and dismissed as not enough and there would be no end to it , &quot; the official said . Addressing the concerns of Syria , Clinton said he and Rabin discussed how to make 1994 &quot; a year of breakthrough &quot; between the Syrians and Israelis . He said Rabin and Syrian President Hafez Assad &quot; have a great responsibility to the people of their region. &quot; Since the start of peace negotiations at the Madrid conference in 1991 , U.S. mediators have sought to spur at least one of the most important tracks -- Israel-Syria or Israel-Palestinians -- at all times . Syria interrupted the negotiations to protest the Hebron massacre , but U.S. officials said the Syrians made_it clear that they regarded the break as only temporary . &quot; We are ready to negotiate , negotiate peace with Syria that takes_account of our mutual needs and interests , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; The promise of peace and its genuine benefits for all Israelis justifies making such decisions vis-a-vis Syria . We will not compromise on our security , but we will stand ready to do what is required of us if the Syrians are ready to do what is required of them. &quot; But Rabin did not spell_out specific steps his government is prepared to take_to reach agreement with Syria . Israeli and Syrian negotiators agreed on most secondary issues of a peace_treaty more_than a year ago but are deadlocked on core issues -- Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights , exchange of ambassadors , trade and open borders . Syria wants assurances that it will regain the Golan before it will negotiate other issues , while Israel wants to determine the nature of peaceful relations before committing itself to return the strategic highlands that it captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle_East War .</TEXT>
