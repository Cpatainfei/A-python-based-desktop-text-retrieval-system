   <HEADLINE> ' MULTIPLE ERRORS ' CITED IN IRAQ COPTER TRAGEDY ; MIDEAST : PENTAGON REPORT DETAILS MISTAKES MADE IN ' FRIENDLY FIRE ' INCIDENT . DISCIPLINE OF THOSE INVOLVED IS EXPECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mistaken destruction of two U.S. Army helicopters by a pair of American F-15C jet fighters over Iraq in April resulted from &quot; multiple errors &quot; by the pilots , air controllers and their unit commanders , a Pentagon investigation shows . The report points_out that , while air controllers on a nearby U.S. AWACS radar surveillance plane knew that the two helicopters were American , they failed to tell others aboard who were overseeing the F-15Cs -- a step that almost certainly would have prevented the tragedy . At the same time , the F-15C pilots themselves did not fly close enough to identify the helicopters properly -- missing the large U.S. flags that were painted on their fuel tanks and misidentifying the two choppers as Soviet-built Iraqi Hinds . The Pentagon report , now being reviewed by Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , is expected to lead to the disciplining of several of those involved . The incident killed 26 people : 15 Americans ; six British , French and Turkish officers , and five Kurdish leaders . The tragedy occurred inside the restricted &quot; no fly &quot; zone over northern Iraq , set_up by the allies three years ago to help protect Kurds from Iraqi harassment . Those traveling in the two U.S. helicopters were_on a tour of Kurdish villages . The Pentagon declined comment on the report ' s conclusions , portions of which were reported in Friday ' s New York Times and in the June 17 Los Angeles Times . Officials said that Perry probably will decide the issue next week , then brief next_of_kin of those killed . In Seattle , where he delivered a speech Friday , Perry told reporters that the Pentagon plans to take further steps to prevent future &quot; friendly fire &quot; incidents . &quot; It was very clear there were errors made , &quot; he said . &quot; There will certainly be corrective action. &quot; Under rules of engagement , allied warplanes are authorized to shoot_down any aircraft flying inside the &quot; no fly &quot; zone that they identify as unauthorized to be there . They are also allowed to bomb Iraqi radar units that they determine are targeting allied aircraft . Sources familiar_with the report said that the investigation cited these discrepancies as contributing to the tragedy : * The transponders carried by the two helicopters to identify them as American were not programmed to transmit the proper coded signal , leading the F-15C pilots to believe that they were Soviet-built Iraqi Hinds , whose appearance is similar . * Contrary to usual procedures , the pilots of the two F-15Cs were not warned in_advance that the U.S. helicopters were to be in the region . Instead , sources said , they were told that no &quot; friendly &quot; aircraft were scheduled to enter the &quot; no fly &quot; zone . * While the F-15C pilots were routinely trained to recognize Iraqi aircraft at a glance , they had not been drilled on the shapes and characteristics of U.S. helicopters and mistook the U.S. pair -- both Army UH-60 Blackhawks -- for Iraqi aircraft . * The rules of engagement under which U.S. pilots were permitted to fire on suspected enemy aircraft in the northern &quot; no fly &quot; zone were not as rigorous as those in a similar &quot; no fly &quot; zone in southern Iraq -- making the system more vulnerable to errors , some critics said . Perry has taken steps to restrict the authority of U.S. fighter_pilots to fire on aircraft in the northern zone . He now must decide , as well , whether to discipline some of those involved , either by relieving them of duties or by subjecting them to courts-martial . The United States narrowly escaped a similar tragedy last spring after Navy pilots in the southern Iraq &quot; no fly &quot; zone were given permission to fire on an unidentified plane but decided against it after their own observations did not track with AWACS information . The aircraft later turned_out to be a Sudanese airliner . The April 14 tragedy came as a major jolt to the military , which has become particularly sensitive to &quot; friendly fire &quot; accidents in which Americans are inadvertently killed by fire from U.S. troops . It occurred in daylight with good visibility . Officials confirmed that one of the F-15C pilots is Lt . Col . Randy May , who downed an Iraqi helicopter apparently carrying supplies to the front_lines during the 1991 Gulf War . Much of the report ' s contents amounted to confirmation of initial conclusions drawn by investigators on the day of the shooting .</TEXT>
