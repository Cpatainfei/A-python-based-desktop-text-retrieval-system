   <HEADLINE> RAPE_SUSPECT FACES 37 FELONY CHARGES IN 4 ABDUCTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Authorities brought 37 felony charges Monday against a Woodland Hills man arrested last week on suspicion of abducting and raping or sexually molesting four women and girls , the youngest only 10 . Howard August Davis , the 29-year-old son of a Beverly Hills police_officer , was scheduled to be arraigned today in Van Nuys Municipal Court . He was being held_in lieu of $ 1.1 million bail at the Los Angeles police_station in Van Nuys , but prosecutors planned to ask a judge to raise the figure to $ 2 million . In a criminal complaint filed Monday by the district_attorney ' s office , Davis was charged with kidnaping for sexual purposes , rape , forcible oral copulation , sodomy , digital penetration and child molestation . The first three victims -- two 18 , another 17 -- were abducted at knifepoint and raped in isolated locations , either in the Santa Monica Mountains or in darkened alleys , investigators said . The fourth person attacked , a 10-year-old girl who was walking to her home with groceries for her family , was threatened with a stun gun , according to Detective F . Jay Romaine of the Los Angeles Police_Department . She was sexually molested but not raped . All of the victims were dropped_off after the attacks at locations miles from where they were abducted . Davis beat his victims -- &quot; in some cases , depending_on resistance &quot; -- but he did not stab any of the three teens , nor did he use the stun gun on the 10-year-old , according to Romaine . Police arrested Davis without incident near the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Sale Avenue on Friday night , two days after investigators realized a serial rapist was attacking young females in the west San Fernando Valley . &quot; It is amazingly good police work for them to arrest a suspect in this case so quickly based on the information they had , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Martin L . Herscovitz , who filed the charges . Romaine credited the arrest to &quot; basic , good police work , and some luck. &quot; Refusing to provide specifics , Romaine said Davis was apprehended by West Valley police_officers who had a composite drawing of the rapist and were looking_for a small , light-colored pickup_truck used to abduct all four victims . &quot; He looked a lot like the composite , &quot; Romaine said , adding that at least one of the victims has since identified Davis in a photo lineup . Police said Davis was wearing &quot; distinctive &quot; clothing when he was arrested , and they recovered the four-inch knife believed used in the first three attacks . Though Davis was arrested on Ventura Boulevard , Romaine said none of the crimes occurred on that busy thoroughfare . Contradicting statements that officials made_over the weekend , Romaine said Davis is not the subject of a flyer circulated along Ventura Boulevard which seeks help solving several rapes . Police said Davis is a suspect , however , in several other rapes during late April and May . &quot; There ' s some differences , and there ' s some similarities , too , &quot; Romaine said . Citing the continuing investigation , Romaine refused to provide certain details about the attacks . Other_than saying the crimes did not occur along Ventura Boulevard , the investigator provided no location other_than the West Valley . The first woman was kidnaped after she pulled into a &quot; well-lighted spot &quot; -- a business that was not open at 2:30 a.m. on May 1 , Romaine said . The 18-year-old had been followed from her job , and when she stopped her car , Davis allegedly smashed her window and dragged her out of the vehicle . She was raped after being driven to two secluded locations in the Santa Monica Mountains in an incident that lasted several hours , Romaine said . The second and third attacks , on May 3 and May 23 , involved pedestrians who were kidnaped by a motorist who asked them for directions , authorities said . Both victims were taken_to darkened allies and attacked . The third victim was grabbed off the sidewalk by the assailant , prompting her to scream . &quot; There are people who hear her , but they ' re too late to do anything about it , &quot; Romaine said . The 10-year-old was also asked_for directions before the man &quot; exits the vehicle and drags her into it , &quot; Romaine said . She was taken into the mountains and molested before being dropped_off in a residential location , where the &quot; petrified &quot; girl sought help at a home , he said . &quot; You know , with these kinds of cases , it ' s not always what ' s visible , it ' s the psychological &quot; damage that can do the most harm in a sexual_assault case , Romaine said . On Monday , a relative who wished to remain anonymous said Davis had a troubled childhood . &quot; I am not defending him , the circumstances of his life are just sad , &quot; the family member said . The relative , who had seen Davis only two or three times during the past three years , said the family found_out about the charges from a newspaper report . Davis had lived off-and-on with his parents -- Howard Davis Sr. , a Beverly Hills police_officer , and Shirley Davis , who was recently hospitalized with emphysema , the relative said .</TEXT>
