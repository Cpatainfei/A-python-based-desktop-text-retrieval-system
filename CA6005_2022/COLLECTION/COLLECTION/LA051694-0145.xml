   <HEADLINE> HANDGUN CRIME SOARING IN U.S. , REPORT SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Handgun crime soared dramatically in 1992 , setting records both in the number of violent crimes committed by individuals armed with handguns and in the number of nonfatal crimes , the Justice_Department reported Sunday . The figures , the latest available , support police statements about the growing use of handguns in a wide variety of crimes . &quot; It certainly shows that we are living_in a more dangerous society &quot; and reinforces the Administration ' s argument for keeping guns out of the hands of criminals , said Justice_Department spokesman Carl Stern . The Justice_Department report says individuals armed with handguns committed a record 930 # 700 violent crimes in 1992 and also set a record of 917 # 500 nonfatal crimes in which handguns were used , almost 50 % higher than the average for the previous five years . No group was more vulnerable to the trend than young black males , the department said . Black males between the ages of 16 and 19 were four times as likely to be the victims of handgun crime as white males their age . Black_men age 20 to 24 were three times as likely as white_men to be victims . In addition to the record level of nonfatal crimes committed by individuals with handguns , the department said FBI statistics indicate that handgun homicides reached 13 # 200 in 1992 , a 24 % increase over the five-year average . Tonya Metaksa , executive_director of the National Rifle Assn. ' s legislative arm , called the survey &quot; somewhat flawed. &quot; She accused the Justice_Department of inflating the gun statistics by lumping together crimes in which a handgun may have been involved -- for example , used in a pistol-whipping but not discharged -- with those instances in which a gun was used &quot; as a firearm. &quot; &quot; Just take_a_look at the city of Washington , D.C. , as a microcosm , &quot; she said , citing the city ' s 400 murders last year . &quot; It isn ' t the guns ( causing the crimes ) . It is the recidivist criminals not being taken_care of by our criminal-justice system. &quot; Rep . Charles E . Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , one of Congress ' leading gun-control advocates , said the survey &quot; gives the lie to the NRA ' s arguments. &quot; &quot; I think it shows that the problem with handguns is escalating . . . . You know that more has to be done to get them off the street , &quot; he said . The report by the department ' s Bureau of Justice Statistics was based on a survey of approximately 100 # 000 crime victims conducted by the Census_Bureau . Stern said the annual survey is regarded_as a highly reliable indicator of crime . Not all_of the statistics released Sunday were ominous . While overall crimes were up and the use of handguns reached record levels , the report also says an individual ' s chances of being a victim of a rape , robbery or an assault in 1992 remained below record high rates set_in 1981 . According to the department ' s figures , the rate for those crimes fell to 35 per 1 # 000 people from 39 per 1 # 000 in 1981 . And earlier this month , the FBI said that in 1993 , serious reported crimes dropped 3 % and that violent offenses decreased by 1 % last year . In 1992 , about 13 % of violent crimes -- one in eight rapes , robberies and assaults -- were committed by individuals with handguns . That trend , reflecting growing use of handguns by criminals , was shown in the sharp rise in the rates of nonfatal handgun crimes . These rose to 4.5 crimes per 1 # 000 people age 12 or older , considerably higher than the record of four per 1 # 000 set_in 1982 , the report says . It found that individuals armed with handguns fired their weapons in about 17 % of all nonfatal crimes , wounding the victim about 3 % of the time . The survey also found that 38 % of the victims who were armed attacked the individuals seeking to harm them . One fifth of those attempting to protect themselves with a firearm were injured , compared to almost half who used other weapons or had no weapon at all , the department said .</TEXT>
