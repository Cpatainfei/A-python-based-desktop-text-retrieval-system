   <HEADLINE> SMOKING DEATHS HIGH IN SANTA PAULA , OXNARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A higher percentage of Santa Paula and Oxnard residents die from smoking than in other Ventura County cities , but the rate of such deaths countywide is significantly below the state average , a study released Thursday shows . Thousand Oaks and Camarillo had the lowest rate of deaths in the county attributable to smoking from 1989 to 1991 , the period covered by the state_Department of Health Services study . The study did not investigate why certain cities had higher rates of smoking and smoking-related deaths . But public health officials said income , education , race , tobacco marketing and environmental restrictions are all contributing factors . &quot; We see patterns in how the tobacco_industry is targeting groups , &quot; said Nan Waltman , who oversees education programs at the county ' s Public Health Department . &quot; The tobacco_industry is heavily billboarding , minimarketing in Latino communities and African American communities. &quot; In Santa Paula , about one of every five adult_male deaths was linked to cigarettes , the study showed . During the same period , about one of every six adult_females who died succumbed to smoking-related illness . The rates in Oxnard were roughly the same . &quot; They ' re basically blue-collar towns , &quot; said Jerry Leavitt , associate director of the Ventura County chapter of the American Lung Assn . &quot; Neither one of these towns has adequately addressed the issue of smoking at the work site , or smoking in restaurants , &quot; he said , referring to anti-smoking ordinances passed recently by several Ventura County cities . George A . Kaplan , head of the state ' s Berkeley-based Human Population Laboratory , which directed the study , said residents of poorer communities may have less access to health_care . &quot; If they have poorer quality of care_for diseases , they ' re more likely to die from ( them ) , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s important to see that as a property of the environment rather than something that goes_along with being poor. &quot; Statewide , 40 # 000 people died each year of the study from diseases linked to smoking . Yet the overall number of smoking-related deaths statewide declined 3.3 % from 1988 , a decrease officials link to increases in the tobacco tax and a change in social attitudes . &quot; There ' s been a real shift , a sea change in attitudes across the country from 10 years ago , &quot; said Dr. Randy Feldman , public health officer for Ventura County . &quot; Smoking is definitely not considered OK in many circles. &quot; The study also found that more Californians die from cigarette smoking than from traffic accidents , homicides or suicides combined . Smoking is a factor_in 19 % of all California deaths . Delano , a Central Valley town with a population of 22 # 762 , had the highest percentage of smoking-related deaths in the state . There , 733 men per 100 # 000 die from illnesses linked to cigarettes . That compares to the statewide average of 450 deaths per 100 # 000 men and 201 per 100 # 000 women . By comparison , the coastal city of Dana Point had the lowest mortality_rate in the state , with just 54 women and 139 men per 100 # 000 dying from smoking . The study was conducted in cities with populations of more_than 20 # 000 . Kaplan said the mortality_rates in the study underestimate the number of actual smoking-related deaths . Deaths from secondhand smoke , cigars or pipes and fires were not counted , he said .
