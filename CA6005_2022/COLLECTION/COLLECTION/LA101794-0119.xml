   <HEADLINE> L.A. MARCH AGAINST PROP . 187 DRAWS 70 # 000 ; IMMIGRATION : PROTESTERS CONDEMN WILSON FOR BACKING INITIATIVE THAT THEY SAY PROMOTES ' RACISM , SCAPEGOATING. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In one of the largest mass protests in the city ' s history , an estimated 70 # 000 demonstrators marched from the Eastside to Downtown on Sunday in boisterous condemnation of Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigration initiative , and its best-known advocate , Gov . Pete Wilson . &quot; This proposition is not against the illegal ( immigrant ) , it ' s against children , &quot; declared Salvador Alendar , a 32-year-old textile factory_worker and Mexican native who carried his 2-year-old daughter , Lisbeth , on his shoulders throughout the march ' s almost four-mile route . It was a sentiment repeated by other outraged marchers and by the dozens of speakers who took_to the elevated podium set_up at the corner of Spring and 1st streets , just across from City_Hall , and addressed the multitudes assembled beneath an azure sky . &quot; We ' ve got_to send a message to the rest of the nation that California will not stand on a platform of bigotry , racism and scapegoating , &quot; declared Joe Hicks , executive_director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , the black civil_rights organization founded by the Rev . Martin_Luther_King Jr . The march was the latest in a series of anti-187 demonstrations , but polls have shown continued strong support for the initiative . By contrast , proposition backers have run a near-invisible campaign from their Orange County base , mostly responding to news media inquiries and appearing at forums . Proposition 187 , among other things , would bar illegal immigrants from receiving public_school educations and a range of other state- and county-funded benefits , including non-emergency health_care and a variety of social_services . March organizers said more_than 100 # 000 participated Sunday , but police estimated that 60 # 000 to 70 # 000 took_part . Still , it was the largest protest gathering here in decades , surpassing Vietnam War-era demonstrations including the historic 1970 Eastside march for Chicano rights that turned violent and left three dead . Police reported no serious injuries and no arrests on Sunday . Hundreds of volunteers helped to guide the orderly , regimented crowd , which formed a column more_than a mile long , a roiling river of banners , flags and placards moving triumphantly down Cesar E . Chavez Avenue , named for the late United Farm_Workers union founder . Eastside sidewalks were packed and impromptu vendors set_up shop selling &quot; No on 187 &quot; T-shirts . Another shirt declared , &quot; No Re-pete , &quot; a reference_to Gov . Wilson ' s reelection bid . The governor ' s image was burned in effigy near City_Hall during the speeches and placed in a coffin , and depicted elsewhere on placards , T-shirts and with a noose around his neck , as a pig , and in other pejorative images . Despite participants ' anger , the mood on Sunday was mostly exuberant , leavened with ethnic pride . Flags of Mexico , El_Salvador and other Latin_American nations were everywhere . The event had been heavily promoted in the Spanish-language media and at community organizations statewide . Marchers converged across from City_Hall where , before speakers addressed the throng , three horn players performed a mariachi riff of &quot; The Star-Spangled Banner &quot; to thunderous applause . * Although the vast majority of participants were Latinos , reflecting the region ' s large immigrant population from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin_America , non-Latino whites , Asian Americans , African Americans and others also took_part . &quot; Anyone who says the immigrants of California are not working and are_on welfare is lying , &quot; Ron Unz , the Silicon_Valley entrepreneur who made a spirited bid against Wilson in the Republican gubernatorial primary race , told the crowd . Other speakers included Assemblyman Richard G . Polanco ( D-Los Angeles ) and City Councilmen Richard Alarcon , Mike Hernandez and Richard Alatorre . Organizers called the protest part of a multiethnic campaign to reject growing anti-immigrant &quot; hysteria &quot; nationwide . &quot; This is not a parade , this is a social movement , &quot; said Juan Jose Gutierrez , an Eastside activist and leading march strategist , who noted planners ' desire to turn_around what he called an anti-immigrant tide and win official recognition of immigrants ' contributions . For the moment , though , attention is focused_on next month ' s California elections and two critical contests : Wilson ' s reelection effort and the heated battle over Proposition 187 . Wilson was the favored target of Sunday ' s demonstration , depicted repeatedly in posters and speeches as a &quot; racist &quot; who has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign in a cynical effort to woo the non-Latinos who dominate California ' s voting rolls . A spokesman for Wilson dismissed the harsh criticisms and downplayed the march ' s importance . &quot; Those who are demonstrating represent a relatively small minority of Californians , &quot; said Dan Schnur , a Wilson campaign spokesman . &quot; Most Californians understand the innate unfairness of providing services for individuals who live_in this state illegally at_the_same_time services are being cut for those who live here legally. &quot; Wilson himself , during a 45-minute address Sunday to an audience of some 400 in the retirement community of Leisure World in Laguna Hills , did not mention the protest when he blamed illegal immigrants for costing the state billions of dollars in_services that should be reserved for legal residents . &quot; We are unable to provide services to our own legal residents , &quot; Wilson said . He declared that illegal immigrants absorb 10 % of the state ' s general fund . &quot; Now that is terribly unfair . . . . I say we should end those services to illegal immigrants . We are . . . rewarding people for violating U.S. law. &quot; Despite opposition from educators , medical groups , organized labor and others , polls have shown strong support for Proposition 187 among likely voters , including many Latinos . Proponents say it will deter new illegal immigration and force those already here to return home -- a premise disputed by opponents , who say the measure would leave hundreds of thousands of youths without education while contributing to the spread of disease by cutting access to non-emergency medical_care . The proposition ' s strong support , analysts say , underlines a widespread preoccupation about the fast-paced immigration that has drastically altered California ' s demographic mix since the 1980s . Anti-187 strategists acknowledge a difficult uphill battle , particularly because even though anti-Proposition 187 forces have apparently raised more_than twice as much money as proponents , fund-raising_efforts have so far fallen_short_of the kind of money needed for an all-out television blitz against the initiative . Many in the anti-187 coalition -- including mainstream Latino groups such_as the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund -- argued that a massive march barely three weeks before the election was a bad tactic , and attempted to scuttle the event . Several Latino activists privately expressed fears that a sea of brown faces marching through Downtown Los Angeles would only antagonize many voters . Another group , Taxpayers Against 187 -- the umbrella organization spearheading the campaign against the initiative whose member groups include teachers , medical professionals and union activists -- did not take_part in organizing the march . * Nonetheless , march organizers -- a statewide coalition of activists grouped together as the National Coordinating Committee for Citizenship and Civic Participation -- opted to go_ahead with the event . Participants called the demonstration a success , as it provided a forum for opponents -- citizens and non-citizens alike -- to express their frustrations . They said it sets the stage for increased immigrant participation in future campaigns , electoral and otherwise . &quot; There was concern and disagreement based on what was the best way of defeating 187 , but I don ' t think you can deny people the right to participate , &quot; said Councilman Hernandez , who was among the marchers . Not so impressed was Ron Prince , chairman of the pro-187 campaign . &quot; If the weather ' s nice , they can do that if they want to , &quot; Prince responded when contacted at the campaign ' s Orange County offices . &quot; I ' m sure a lot of people were there to see the show. &quot; The march , he predicted , would bolster his cause by focusing attention on the problem of illegal immigration . &quot; When people look_at the issue , they understand the problem and they tend to support Proposition 187 , &quot; said Prince , an accountant in Tustin . While the march turnout was impressive , many participants were foreign nationals unable to vote . Among them was Rafael , a 27-year-old illegal immigrant who hoisted a Mexican flag as he marched near the head of the event . &quot; Our lives are here now , and we ' re not going_back to Mexico no matter what happens , &quot; said Rafael , a factory_worker and father of three , including two U.S.-born sons and an undocumented 6-year-old boy now attending public_school . &quot; I work hard , and I don ' t think it ' s fair that my son should be thrown_out of school , &quot; Rafael said as he marched . Among the many Asian Americans participating was Han Kyong Kim , who came_with a group of Korean Americans . &quot; If this proposition passes , &quot; said Kim , a businessman , &quot; all immigrants will be suspect. &quot; Sunday ' s march follows a similar demonstration in May that drew between 8 # 000 and 25 # 000 protesters to Downtown Los Angeles , before Proposition 187 was placed on the ballot .
