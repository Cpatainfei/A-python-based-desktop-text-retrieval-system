   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE ; MURDEROUS ' SOCIAL CLEANSING ' DOES NOT EVEN SPARE CHILDREN IN COLOMBIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first time Calvo escaped death , he ducked to avoid bursts of machine_gun fired by a passing motorist . The second time , shrapnel from a grenade hurled at him nicked his chest . Death is nothing mysterious or distant for Calvo , who is 15 , nor for millions of Colombians living_in what may well be the most violent country in the Americas . When Colombia ' s war with cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar ended last December , the most savage &quot; narco-terrorism &quot; -- in which bombs wiped_out entire shopping_malls and downed jetliners -- also ended . But the violence that is an inexorable part of Colombian culture and history only seems to worsen . And with elections approaching in March and May , many Colombians fear that murders and kidnapings will continue to soar . In just a single week ' s time in January , the finance_minister narrowly escaped an assassination attempt ; two American missionaries were kidnaped , and 35 peasants sympathetic to a leftist political_party were slaughtered in a regional power struggle . Guerrillas continue to wage the longest war in South_America , and the murders of street_urchins by police , vigilantes and others in Colombia last year exceeded that of Brazil , which has nearly four times the population . &quot; What is happening in Colombia is that there are many forms of violence , all mixed_up , crossed over and feeding_on each other , &quot; political_scientist Alejandro Reyes said . &quot; Violence has metastasized , like a cancer , leaving its original organism and invading all_of society. &quot; It is into the category of slain street children that Calvo may one day fall . He belongs_to one of the many gangs of children and teen-agers who roam Bogota ' s roughest downtown streets . They mug and pick pockets , turn tricks as prostitutes and consume drugs , primarily glue sniffed from plastic bags . In response , vigilante death squads roam the same streets , picking_off young thugs and other street people in a campaign of &quot; social cleansing. &quot; Police often form part of the death squads , according to human_rights organizations , which estimate that one person is killed every two days through &quot; social cleansing. &quot; The real_number is believed to be higher because many of these deaths are not reported . Calvo says he has survived two attempts to kill him by what he believes was a death squad . In both the machine_gun and grenade attacks , a car passed the corner where many of the young gangsters hang_out , slowed_down and then opened_fire . &quot; I threw myself on the ground , &quot; Calvo said , describing the attacks as he sucked on a glue-filled plastic bag . A few feet away , two uniformed police_officers gave chase to a girl who had apparently robbed a passer-by . One of the officers took_off his helmet and began beating the girl as they ran . The girl escaped , and , the chase over , the officers approached a reporter and launched into a vivid description of the street horrors they feel they confront every day . &quot; Seven muggings in the 10 minutes it took me to walk_around the block ! &quot; one policeman complained . &quot; The only thing you can do with these people . . . &quot; He completed the sentence by slicing a finger across his neck . &quot; La limpieza social , &quot; his partner said . &quot; Social cleansing. &quot; &quot; These people . . . &quot; the first officer began . &quot; Are a lost cause , &quot; his partner finished . * The vigilante killings by police , civilians and paramilitary hired guns , both in the cities and in the vast countryside , make_up a large part of Colombia ' s murder and mayhem -- but only a part . Violence is also traced to leftist guerrillas , to drug_traffickers , to army anti-insurgency campaigns , to large landholders trying to get_rid_of peasants . Moreover , in a country where the judicial_system is perceived as weak and ineffective , the violent resolution of conflicts has become a way_of_life , experts say . There is a certain historical continuum to Colombia ' s fratricide . During the 1940s and 1950s , Colombia lived through a period known as &quot; La Violencia , &quot; where its two dominant political_parties , the Liberals and the Conservatives , battled over land and political power . More_than 200 # 000 people were killed . A power-sharing pact , imposed by the military , ended the fighting in 1958 but excluded the Left . Remnants of the warring factions continued to operate in the countryside , joined in the 1960s by disaffected leftists who formed guerrilla armies . Wealthy ranchers and farmers responded by organizing paramilitary bands to fight the rebels and to protect their properties , often by eliminating peasants who may or may_not have sympathized_with the guerrillas . The violence swelled as cocaine traffickers entered the picture in the 1970s , reaching its most pitched savagery with drug lord Escobar ' s declaration of war on the Colombian state in 1989 . The henchmen employed by Escobar and his Medellin cartel assassinated hundreds of judges and police , three presidential candidates in the 1989 elections , and a justice minister ; an Escobar bomb destroyed a commercial airliner in midair , killing all 107 passengers aboard . Escobar was killed last Dec . 2 in a shootout with police , after 16 months on the run . Most of Colombia was relieved , but the relief was short-lived as the reality of Colombian violence quickly re-emerged . While drug-related violence captures the headlines , it accounts_for a fraction of the total bloodshed , experts say . And political murder accounts_for an estimated 10 % of all homicides . Common crime , private score-settling , social cleansing and every_other imaginable reason-to-kill make_up the rest . The number of murders in Colombia in the last several years has routinely surpassed that of the United States , which has about eight times the population . In 1992 , 10 people were killed per 100 # 000 in the United States ; it was 82 per 100 # 000 in Colombia . In the capital city of Bogota , a person is killed , on the average , every hour , every day . Bogota has just under twice the population of Los Angeles , and more_than eight times the number of homicides . In a particularly dizzying week in January , Finance_Minister Rudolf Hommes barely avoided a bomb_blast detonated by remote_control . His bodyguard was injured . Days before , a 65-pound dynamite bomb meant for the national prisons chief was found and deactivated . Two American missionaries were kidnaped by leftist guerrillas in apparent protest of the presence of U.S. troops in Colombia . And then came the deadliest single massacre in Colombia in more_than five years . Masked gunmen thought to be Marxist guerrillas opened_fire on supporters of a political_party formed by former rebels who accepted a government amnesty three years ago . A total of 35 supporters of the Hope , Peace and Freedom Party were killed in the Jan . 23 slaughter in the tropical banana-growing region of Uraba . In a deadly , ongoing power struggle , the armed guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have declared war on the Hope , Peace and Freedom Party in hopes of intimidating its supporters and controlling the region . At least 300 former rebels have been killed since laying_down their weapons in 1991 . Colombians will vote for congress and the president this month and in May , respectively . The guerrillas have vowed to disrupt the elections , and the Uraba killings sent a chill over an already tempestuous campaign . * Colombia ' s experts in violence -- the legion of sociologists and political_scientists called &quot; violentologists &quot; -- say the weakness of state institutions and the judiciary , both of which have been corrupted by drug money , has encouraged many Colombians to take justice into their own hands . And that in turn further generalizes violence . While the government improved its intelligence-gathering operations and has deployed military_campaigns to go_after guerrillas , the basic ability to investigate and prosecute crimes remains ineffective , the experts said . According to Eduardo Pizarro of the National University , of about 17 # 000 homicides in 1987 , only 3 % were punished ; of an estimated 27 # 000 homicides last year , only 3 % to 5 % are likely to be solved . &quot; The rampant impunity makes_it very cheap to commit a crime , &quot; said Juan Gabriel Tokatlian , director of International Studies at the University of the Andes . &quot; People begin to take justice into their own hands ( and ) to resolve their own problems with violence . . . . There are car wrecks where both parties draw guns . The most mundane incident is a spark , a fuse that detonates the bomb. &quot; The phenomenon stretches from upstanding citizens who bullet-proof their cars and arm themselves -- as_many as a quarter of Colombia ' s adults may be armed -- to the cocaine barons who set_up paramilitary squads to protect their vast and expanding properties . Reyes , in a study , estimated that 375 paramilitary squads were_active at one point . In recent years , drug_traffickers are believed to have bought_up to 3 million hectares of land , including a substantial portion of Colombia ' s best farmland . As they build these empires , they organize the paramilitary groups to remove peasants , intimidate workers or fight_off guerrillas . But perhaps no violence encapsulates the desperation , frustration and sense of lost justice as does the social cleansing , which began in the late 1980s in the Colombian cities of Cali and Barranquilla and now claims hundreds of lives annually . Designed originally to eradicate male and female prostitutes , social cleansing now targets all types of destitute street people , including muggers , beggars and junkies -- people referred to in Bogota as the &quot; throwaways &quot; of society . Increasingly , business owners in major cities , frustrated by a shortage of police and lack of law and order , condone &quot; social cleansing &quot; to restore safety to the streets , human_rights activists say . &quot; Social cleansing is not accidental , &quot; social_worker Carlos Rojas said in a human_rights report prepared by the Latin_American Institute of Alternative Legal Services . &quot; There are prior threats , the victims are chosen , and there is an M.O. that is repeated . . . . The idea that these people might die in a violent way is now accepted as something normal in Colombia. &quot; Frankie is another of the street people for whom a violent_death seems inevitable . Homeless for 14 of his 22 years , Frankie ended_up on the streets after his mother died during an illegal abortion . His father , a bodyguard for a major cocaine trafficker , was already dead . Frankie sleeps on a piece of cardboard in Independence Park in central Bogota , where he is recovering from his latest wound , a bullet to the throat . A convicted killer who served time in jail , Frankie says he has been shot two or three times by the vigilantes . He has somehow survived , like a cat , he says , with many lives . &quot; The problem with la limpieza , &quot; Frankie said , &quot; is the innocent fall with the sinners. &quot;</TEXT>
