   <HEADLINE> SHOEMAKERS PUT THEIR BEST FEET FORWARD ; SOCIAL CONSCIENCE : THEY MADE THEIR MONEY RUNNING ROCKPORT , RYKA AND REEBOK . NOW EACH IS INVOLVED IN A SPECIAL CAUSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Their common professional calling consists_of cushioning the human_foot ' s contact with the ground . They are cobblers , shoe magnates who might well be content to lace_up their hefty profits and let others fret about mankind ' s moral bunions . But Paul Fireman , Bruce Katz and Sheri Poe are three shoemakers with soul . Beyond their chosen line of endeavor they share little but the geography of New England . Yet in each of these footwear manufacturers , entrepreneurial acumen has fueled an equal appetite for social activism . Their causes are varied . Fireman , chief_executive_officer of Reebok International Ltd. , has taken_on human_rights as his personal and corporate mission . Katz , co-founder of Rockport Shoes , sold_out of the shoe biz and used the money to leap into the arena of community change via on-line communication . Poe , founder of Ryka Inc. , is a rape survivor and has dedicated herself to the goal of ending violence against women . Fireman -- only partially in jest -- offered regional similarities as a possible explanation for their high level of social consciousness . &quot; Maybe it ' s something in the water , &quot; he said . &quot; And if it is , we should spread it around. &quot; Here are these shoemakers ' stories . Paul Fireman , Reebok Just a dozen or so years ago , Paul Fireman is entirely comfortable admitting , he would n ' t have recognized social responsibility if it had come calling_at his door . &quot; I ' d never heard of it , &quot; said the 50-year-old Fireman , who was raised in a family of shoe manufacturers in the gritty hamlet of Brockton , Mass . &quot; I didn ' t even know the words. &quot; Fireman , who today continues to fight a middle-aged bulge despite a serious golf habit and frequent trips to the company gym , knew only that &quot; I wanted to make a difference. &quot; And why not ? Reebok , after all , was going gangbusters ; Fireman had acquired an athletic shoe business just when health-obsessed Americans began insisting on entire wardrobes of high-priced , sport-specific footwear . In 1981 , Reebok recorded $ 1.5 million in sales . Five years later , the figure had grown to $ 916 million . But to Fireman , meteoric profits were not inconsistent with an altruistic company spirit . &quot; From Day One , &quot; he said , &quot; I didn ' t want this to look_like , taste like or smell like an American corporation of the ' 50s , ' 60s or ' 70s. &quot; He was a onetime shoe salesman , not some senescent social protester . Even so , &quot; I had grown to hate the mainstream world , with all_the compromises you had to make just to show_up at the front_door . I thought Reebok should operate slightly differently. &quot; Well aware of the boss ' s philosophy , Reebok ' s ad_agency approached Fireman in 1986 with a proposal to sponsor an international rock_music tour for Amnesty International . &quot; It seemed like a good idea , &quot; Fireman decided , even if $ 10 million was a lot of money for a_few concerts . Little did Fireman realize when he agreed to sponsor Amnesty ' s Human_Rights Now World Concert Tour -- featuring such celebrities as Bruce Springsteen , Peter Gabriel and Sting -- that a funny thing would happen on the way to the tour . &quot; We got bit by the bug , &quot; Fireman said in a 1992 speech at the Columbia University Business_School . &quot; Amnesty opened our eyes , and we became passionate about human rights. &quot; The feeling was not initially mutual from the human_rights community . &quot; They were skeptical to the extreme , &quot; Fireman said . &quot; They kept us in_abeyance &quot; -- a polite understatement , Fireman conceded . &quot; We were suits . They held_in disdain the business_community as_a_whole . In their minds , we were businessmen who did all_the wrong things. &quot; Better , Fireman was gently informed , to stick_to the traditional &quot; side-door &quot; route of quietly pouring money into existing foundations . No thanks , Fireman said . In 1988 , he initiated the annual Reebok Human_Rights Awards , offering no-strings-attached grants of $ 25 # 000 to people 30 or younger who were making &quot; significant contributions to the cause of human_rights -- often against great odds. &quot; The Rev . Carl Washington of Los Angeles was a 1993 winner , recognized for his leadership in curbing violence after the 1992 riots . * Fireman -- often with one of his Human_Rights Award board_members , former President Jimmy_Carter , by his side -- was more_than just the guy who handed_out the checks . He was also the CEO who made_sure that human_rights production standards were in place at 40 Reebok-affiliated facilities around the world , and who made_sure that &quot; business decisions were made inclusive of human rights. &quot; Publicly traded Reebok ' s profits were flat in 1993 , and some hard-eyed corporate analysts and executives wondered about this father of three -- married to the same wife since forever -- who didn ' t look a bit like Ben or Jerry yet still preached a do-gooder doctrine . &quot; Is it good business ? &quot; Fireman asked . &quot; I don ' t know if it sells any more shoes , but I don ' t think that ' s our intention. &quot; Fireman is entirely aware that he might just as well have opted for a more benign cause than the social ills of East Timor , Kurdistan , Mozambique and even these United States . But he is adamant that &quot; we didn ' t do this to become powerful . We did_it to do some good . We did_it to change the world. &quot; And anyway , he said , &quot; It feels better . What the heck ? &quot; Bruce Katz , Rockport The last thing in the world Bruce Katz ( pronounced Kates ) intended to do was follow in his father ' s professional footsteps . He built his first computer at 13 , back in the days when a computer was the size of a rec_room , and turned_up his toes at the mere mention of the shoe business . That was the domain of his dad , Saul . Engineering , his major at Cornell , was what Bruce had_in_mind . But he got sidetracked by good , healthy American ambition . There he was in 1972 , haunting the hippie emporiums of Harvard Square , hawking moccasins from the back of his pickup . &quot; Basically I went_into the ( shoe ) business to make a little money , and then leave , &quot; Katz said . To his amazement , &quot; I really had fun , and I learned a lot. &quot; He quickly realized that he was strolling in , so to speak , on the beginning of the walking-for-fitness movement . With his father , he launched Rockport shoes , now the metatarsal mainstay of many foot-weary Americans . For a while , Katz published Walking magazine while also marketing proudly clod-hopping footwear . He watched his little back-of-the-truck enterprise grow to a $ 300-million success story . If Katz was becoming a millionaire , he was also turning_into a believer -- &quot; in social change , and political activism , which I had never been much involved in . I got convinced that you could actually change things. &quot; But while funding fitness-related medical research , Katz chafed at the number of hands extended in his direction . &quot; Giving money to various organizations was very frustrating , &quot; he recalled . &quot; The need is endless. &quot; In 1986 , Katz sold Rockport -- to , coincidentally , Reebok . Determined &quot; to go_out and solve some of the world ' s problems , &quot; Katz headed straight to San Francisco , his idea of heaven . There he established an investment_firm and a philanthropic group called the Springhouse Foundation , which benefits the needy , the environment and the arts . But the fit was far from perfect . In the nonprofit arena , the 47-year-old Katz said from his office in Sausalito , &quot; I felt completely uncomfortable . People sat around and talked and talked . Nobody had the operational sense that I found in business. &quot; * Still tinkering with his computers , meanwhile , Katz cast_about for a community-based cause that would employ his engineering skills as well as his entrepreneurship . He was particularly taken by the WELL , an Internet conferencing system started in 1985 by the crowd who had brought_out the Whole Earth Catalogs . WELL participants share ideas in &quot; forums , &quot; or discussion areas , ranging from virtual_reality to cooking . A bachelor living_in San Francisco ' s serene Pacific Heights district , Katz was electronically surrounded by the_likes_of lawyers , doctors , musicians , carpenters , hobbyists and more . It was a neighborhood pub without all_the smoke , a seminar with no exams , a calorie-free dinner_party . It was a cozy , cosmopolitan salon where if a bore showed_up , you could delete him . In this disembodied but burbling intellectual environment , Katz was a contented computer camper -- so_much so that in 1991 , he became a 50-50 partner in the enterprise . Last January , he bought the whole electronic campground for an undisclosed amount . Katz ' s first order_of_business was to increase accessibility to the WELL , the better to stimulate wider discussions and , perchance , change from the ground up . While &quot; up until now , communication with large_numbers of people was really the bailiwick of the very wealthy , &quot; he said , a vast conferencing system enables community groups to transmit their messages anywhere they want . Katz said his modest goal is to get the whole world talking to each other , and to generate change from the kind of conversations that used to take_place over the back fence . Out of this effort , Katz believes , &quot; is going_to come some really nifty ways to organize people and to make some changes that will make all_of our lives better. &quot; Sheri Poe , Ryka Days after the death of Nicole Brown Simpson , Sheri Poe was galled that even for a moment , Simpson ' s abuse by her husband might have been seen as a private issue . &quot; that ' s the crux , &quot; Poe said , fuming behind a desk in Norwood , Mass. , that is adorned with equal numbers of family pictures and athletic shoes . &quot; Society has bought_into this ridiculous idea that domestic abuse is a private issue . And it ' s not . It ' s a public concern. &quot; You ' ll pardon Poe if , looking disarmingly slender for a woman who gave_birth to her fourth child five months ago , she leaps onto her soapbox from time to time . As the CEO of Ryka Inc. , which Poe describes as &quot; the only athletic shoe company exclusively devoted to the women ' s market , &quot; she has been known to remind unsuspecting rival executives , mostly male , that this country boasts about three times as_many animal shelters as women ' s shelters . She spews out facts and figures confidently -- and accurately : Every 15 seconds in this country , a woman is beaten ; domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women between 15 and 44 , and so on . She comes_by her knowledge and passion honestly -- if also unfortunately . Hitchhiking to work 22 years ago , a naive 19-year-old freshman at Southern Illinois University , Poe was raped at gunpoint . She tried to press charges but was made to think that it was her fault because she had been hitchhiking . Besides , she said , her attacker had friends in the police_department . There was no chance , they told her , of a conviction . Poe &quot; coped &quot; with her shame and anger by becoming bulimic . She said exercise finally helped her regain her self-esteem . Plagued by an aching back and perpetually sore knees , Poe blamed the shoes she wore during a decade or more of heavy-impact aerobic_exercise . If the right product didn ' t exist , Poe reasoned , she would just have to invent it -- and in 1987 she and her first husband , a marketing executive , started Ryka , named for her then-mother-in-law . A female investment_banker , who conveniently happened to also be an exercise fanatic , raised money through public stock offerings . * From the start , the Ryka pitch was unusual -- because to Poe , tending to &quot; total well-being &quot; for women meant accompanying each pair of shoes with an 800 telephone_number offering 24-hour support and information for female victims of violence . She also urges retailers to pass_out safety booklets published by her Ryka ROSE ( for Regain One ' s Self-Esteem ) Foundation , which funds treatment , education and prevention programs to help end violence against women . When Poe ' s marriage broke_up , she kept the company -- as well as the ROSE Foundation , to which she has pledged 7 % of her annual pretax profits . To date , Ryka ' s shaky performance has meant that the promise has not put huge dents in Poe ' s pockets . Since going public in 1988 , Ryka has yet to record a full year of profitability . But Poe , a former &quot; pink bag_lady &quot; for Mary Kay cosmetics , calls herself a &quot; gut-sense entrepreneur &quot; who projects brighter days for her company as well as her foundation . Still , critics accuse Poe of talking a good game when it comes_to crimes against women . Some have sniped that Poe has stooped_to the cellar of &quot; cause marketing , &quot; turning_into a professional rape victim who exploits her own experience in hopes of bigger sales . &quot; Yeah , yeah , yeah , &quot; she scoffed . &quot; I ' ve heard that , and I say , obviously you ' ve never been close to anyone who is a survivor . Because if you think it ' s a picnic to discuss this , you ' re wrong . I ' d have to be a real masochist to relive that kind of pain , just to benefit this company. &quot; Poe met her second husband , a biochemist who is the father of her two youngest children , while scuba_diving . With so many kids , her home exudes a kind of pleasant chaos , she said . Often she welcomes the escape to the relative tranquillity of an office , where most of her employees are female , and where many come_to work attired in workout clothes . Poe said she will not give_up the cause she has pegged as her own . &quot; I have a commitment to bring_forward the issue of violence against women , and I ' m going_to do that till the day I die. &quot; She smiled , perhaps ruefully . &quot; Which is good , because it ' s probably going_to take that long. &quot;</TEXT>
