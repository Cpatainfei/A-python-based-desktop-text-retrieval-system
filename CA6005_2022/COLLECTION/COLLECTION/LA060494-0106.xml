   <HEADLINE> STOCKS , BONDS REBOUND AFTER JOBS REPORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stocks and bonds staged strong rallies Friday after the May employment report showed a healthy economy free_of major inflationary pressures . A surging dollar and falling commodity prices also gave the markets a lift . Interest_rates initially soared and equities fell_in early trading after the Labor_Department reported that the nation ' s unemployment_rate plunged to 6 % in May , from 6.4 % in April . The rise was triggered by anxiety that the lower jobless rate was a signal of stronger economic_growth , which can create inflationary pressures . Bolstering that view , the report also said that average hourly wages rose to $ 11.11 from $ 11.05 , a sizable increase . Inflation can diminish the value of bonds , which pay a fixed rate_of_interest . However , it began recovering as investors took a closer look_at the data .

The Dow Jones industrial average followed the bond market higher , ending 13.23 points higher at 3 # 772.22. The blue_chip indicator finished the week with a gain of 15.08 points . Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 12 to 7 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where 270.38 million shares changed hands . Broad-market indexes also moved higher . The NYSE ' s composite index rose 1.26 to 254.34. The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller firms rose 2.70 to 742.20.

The dollar was quoted at 1.670 marks and 105.30 Japanese yen in late New York trading , up from 1.654 marks and 104.85 yen Thursday . Analysts said a decline in commodities prices , seen in a 1 % drop_in the Commodities Research Bureau ' s futures index , helped buoy bond prices . The CRB index of 21 futures closed at 232.05 , down 2.30 points for the day . Analysts said lower soybean and crude_oil prices pressured the index , which is a closely watched inflation barometer . But the pressure was probably temporary because it was a technical correction , they said . Gold lost $ 3.50 an ounce to close at $ 380.70 on the Comex .
