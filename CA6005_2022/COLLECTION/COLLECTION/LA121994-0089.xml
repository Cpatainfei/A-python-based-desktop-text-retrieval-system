   <TEXT> Telephone_Line : State regulators are expected to set the ground_rules Wednesday for competition in local telephone markets , which are now monopolies for Pacific Bell and General Telephone Co . of California . This is part of the Public_Utilities Commission ' s plan to revamp the state ' s telecommunications industry to introduce competition in all markets.Among other issues , the commissioners will look_at changing the definition of basic phone_service and how to pay_for universal service for low-income and elderly customers . The rule changes will let such giants as AT &amp; T and MCI compete for strictly local phone business . The PUC , which has already opened_up the market for so-called local long-distance as of Jan . 1 , hopes to deregulate the rest of the industry within two years .</TEXT>
