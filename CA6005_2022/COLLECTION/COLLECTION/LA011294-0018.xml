   <HEADLINE> SALINAS -- BOTH THE DOVE AND THE HAWK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was inevitable that Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari would shake_up his government after last week ' s bloody Indian uprising in the state of Chiapas . But more_than political damage_control is needed in the wake of a crisis that has tarnished the young Mexican president ' s reputation both inside Mexico and abroad . After all , the ouster of Interior Minister Patrocinio Gonzalez was an easy call_for Salinas . No official was more responsible_for the social and political mess in Chiapas that blew_up in the president ' s face . Gonzalez , who oversaw internal security in his Cabinet post , failed utterly to anticipate the Chiapas trouble . To make matters worse , he was governor of that state for five years before becoming interior minister last year and critics there claim his heavy-handed administration helped exacerbate the backward conditions that led to the outbreak of violence on Jan . 1 . That is why the far more interesting , and far more hopeful , changes that Salinas announced Monday are his selection of Atty . Gen . Jorge Carpizo MacGregor to replace Gonzalez as interior minister and his dispatching of former Mexico_City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis to Chiapas . Camacho will be Salinas ' personal envoy there and head a federal commission that will seek &quot; reconciliation , &quot; Salinas said . Both Carpizo and Camacho have outstanding credentials for their difficult new jobs . Carpizo was a respected human_rights advocate before becoming attorney_general . He will now have to ask some tough questions to determine whether security_forces have , as some rights groups fear , gone too far in putting_down the Chiapas revolt . With both Mexican and foreign journalists still barred from the area of conflict in the south , rumors and reports of bloody suppression persist . Sooner or later Salinas must reply to international concerns over human_rights abuses in this crisis , and when he does an aide of Carpizo ' s stature will be extremely helpful . Camacho is a well-regarded negotiator with close ties to Mexican leftist groups , a key reason Salinas appointed him mayor of Mexico_City , where the left is politically potent . The president surely figures that if anyone can get the Indian rebels to talk peace , Camacho can . But , as with Carpizo , Salinas must give his new appointee the leeway needed to get the job done and to calm the crisis without further bloodshed . A good first_step would be for both Carpizo and Camacho to offer the leaders of the Indian rebellion guarantees of amnesty and , perhaps more important in the short term , personal safety if they agree to stop fighting , come_out into the open and negotiate publicly with the government .</TEXT>
