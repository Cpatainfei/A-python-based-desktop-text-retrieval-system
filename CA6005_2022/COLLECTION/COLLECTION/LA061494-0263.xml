   <TEXT> Blue_chip stocks rose Monday in a rally led by companies linked to the fortunes of the economy , but bond prices fell on fears that inflation may be_on the rise . The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.67 points to 3 # 783.12. Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock_Exchange . Big Board volume came_to 243.38 million shares , up from 222.61 million on Friday . The market managed to rally despite a drop_in the shares of Exxon Corp . A federal jury found that recklessness by the nation ' s largest oil_company helped cause the worst U.S. oil spill and opened the company up_to punitive damages . Exxon was off 2 1 / 2 at 59 5 / 8 in heavy trading of more_than 3.5 million shares . Sharply lower foreign stock prices helped set the day ' s negative tone , and major stock indexes traded_in a narrow , mostly lower range . Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index plunged 94.43 points , or 3.96 % , to 2 # 291.12. It was the biggest one-day decline since April 20 , when stocks fell 5.2 % after a surge in interest_rates . In Europe , stocks were apparently hurt by economic reports hinting at future inflation .

Susan Philips , who was quoted as saying inflationary pressures are emerging in commodity markets . The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 7.35 % from Friday ' s 7.31 % , pushing its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , down 15 / 32 point , or $ 4.69 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Stock investors don ' t like to see interest_rates rise , because that increases the cost of money to corporations and makes shares less attractive relative to interest-bearing investments . &quot; The market ' s listless , &quot; said Bill Allyn , managing director at Jefferies &amp; Co . &quot; Portfolio managers are pretty much where they want to be and are waiting for direction from earnings or economic news. &quot; Many investors , analysts said , turned their attention to economic data due out this week , including today ' s report on consumer prices . Another factor contributing to the relatively light volume , analysts said , was Friday ' s quarterly expiration of stock index options and futures and options on individual stocks . Trading is often light ahead of the portfolio adjustments , they said . Investors bought the stocks of companies that benefit most from an expanding economy , such_as paper , autos and chemicals , and that buoyed the Dow industrials .

Its stock rose 1 1 / 8 to 63 3 / 4 . * Telefonos de Mexico dropped 2 1 / 8 to 58 3 / 4 along with other Mexican stocks in U.S. trading after Indian rebels in southern Mexico rejected a peace accord . Meanwhile , in the currency market , the dollar slid as investors flocked to the German mark in the wake of a ruling-party victory in European parliamentary elections . The dollar closed_in New York at 1.647 German marks , down from 1.667 on Friday . The dollar fetched 102.85 Japanese yen , down from 103.50 on Friday .
