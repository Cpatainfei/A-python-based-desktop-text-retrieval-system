   <HEADLINE> STOCKS , BOND YIELDS RISE AS FED STEPS IN TO STOP DOLLAR ' S FALL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The battered dollar plunged toward its post-World War II low against the Japanese yen Friday before the Federal_Reserve_Board unexpectedly intervened and carried the greenback to a small gain by the end of the day . But the dollar still fell against major European currencies . Meanwhile , stocks rebounded after the Fed ' s intervention in the currency markets and better-than-expected earnings were reported by Ford Motor Co . However , the falling dollar drove Treasury_bond yields higher amid concern that a weak U.S. currency would lead to inflation , thus eroding the value of fixed-income securities . The Fed ' s action , announced in a brief statement from Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , marks the first time the central_bank has intervened to prop_up the dollar against the Japanese yen since August . After ending mixed in Europe , the dollar fell sharply in early domestic trading on what market_analysts said was carry-over from Thursday ' s dip on lower-than-expected figures for U.S. economic_growth in the first_quarter . The Treasury_bond market selloff Thursday may also have contributed to the dollar ' s weakness , dealers said . Data showing economic_growth generally supports the dollar because it tends to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive and thus brings capital into the United States . But the recent declines in American stock and bond markets have overshadowed evidence of economic strength and have hurt the U.S. currency , analysts said . The dollar , which had been threatening to fall below 100 Japanese yen for the first time , bounded higher on the Fed ' s move . The dollar closed_in New York at 101.50 yen , up 0.15 after having fallen to 100.65 earlier in the day , just above a post-World War II low of 100.35 yen set_in August . However , the greenback closed lower against the German mark , ending at 1.654 marks , down from Thursday ' s 1.663. Analysts questioned how long the rally would last and said further action may be needed to prop_up the currency . &quot; The Fed broke the dollar ' s free fall , that ' s all , &quot; said David De Rosa , director of foreign_exchange trading at Swiss Bank Corp . &quot; People are still eager to sell. &quot; The Fed probably bought dollars to calm the stock and bond markets , traders said . Bonds plunged Thursday amid concern that the weak dollar would cheapen U.S. assets and exacerbate inflation by making imports more expensive . &quot; The Treasury wanted to show investors that it ' s still safe to invest in U.S. stocks and bonds , &quot; said Ezra Zask , president of Ezra Zask Associates , a hedge_fund in Norfolk , Conn. , with $ 180 million under its management . &quot; They want the dollar stronger. &quot; On Wall_Street , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.38 to 3 # 681.69 , adding 33.01 for the week . In the broader market , advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where about 293.98 million shares changed hands . Bonds swung widely throughout Friday ' s session . After a drop of nearly two points Thursday , the price of the Treasury ' s main 30-year bond was trading down almost another point Friday when Bentsen announced the government ' s intervention in the currency market . Yields then recovered somewhat . The Treasury ' s bellwether 30-year bond yield ended the week at 7.30 % , up from 7.26 % the day before . Its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , fell 7 / 16 point , or $ 4.38 per $ 1 # 000 . In addition to the currency pressure , the bond market has been weakened by heavy supply . Demand was light for $ 28 billion in new two- and five-year notes issued earlier this week . Individuals and small-portfolio bondholders led the early-morning selloff , after Thursday ' s retreat by large investors , which had been spurred by data on the nation ' s gross_domestic_product . Stocks surprised some analysts by outperforming bonds for the first time in many sessions . Friday ' s performance indicates there is fundamental strength underlying the equities market , said Alfred Goldman , vice_president at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St . Louis . &quot; If stocks were really vulnerable , the bond selloff would have given us an excuse to take it down further , &quot; he said . Among the market highlights : * Transportation issues rose as reports of a tentative settlement in the Teamsters strike pushed trucking_company shares higher . Consolidated Freightways rose 1 1 / 4 to 27 1 / 2 . * Transports were also supported by airline stocks , including Delta , which extended Thursday ' s gains after saying it will lay off about 20 % of its staff . Delta rose 2 1 / 4 to 47 1 / 2 . The Dow Jones transportation index rose 24.50 , or 1.5 % , to 1 # 660.13. * The stock_market was able to turn its focus away from rising interest_rates and to good earnings_reports . Ford Motor rose 7 / 8 to 58 3 / 8 after reporting sharply higher earnings . * Scientific-Atlanta jumped 4 3 / 8 to 33 1 / 2 after reporting strong first-quarter earnings late Thursday that prompted Goldman Sachs to upgrade its rating on the stock . Overseas markets also closed lower . Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index fell 27.13 points , or 1.17 % , to 2 # 294.1. In Frankfurt , the DAX-30 average index closed 5.24 points lower at 2 # 245.98. London ' s Financial Times 100-share average ended the week at 3 # 125.3 , off 4.6 points . The Tokyo market was closed for a holiday and will reopen Monday .
