   <HEADLINE> POP_MUSIC REVIEW ; SOUTHERN CULTURE A MIX OF COUNTRY , SURF , ROCK KITSCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern Culture on the Skids is a trio from North Carolina that ' s been basking proudly in its white-trash roots for 10 years , banging_out countrified surf music with a kitschy rock edge . The group ' s approach was a perfect fit Wednesday with the cheesy tiki decor of Jacks Sugar Shack , where its tongue-in-cheek blend of backwoods flavor , ironic stance and driving , tight delivery won_over the small audience . Singer-guitarist Rick Miller , in overalls , straw_hat and no shirt , craned his neck and flapped his arms to the song &quot; Ain ' t Nobody Here but Us Chickens , &quot; and yee-hawed sporadically throughout the set . Singer-bassist Mary Huff , in a polka-dot dress and bouffant hairdo , sang such songs as &quot; Daddy Was a Preacher and Mama Was a Go-Go Dancer &quot; in nasal , Appalachian tones . A version of the Louvin Brothers ' &quot; Great Atomic Power , &quot; a ' 50s tune that casts a warily religious eye at the new energy source , highlighted the set , which shimmied with surf guitar and pounded with the energy of charged rockabilly . Southern Culture is strictly for kicks -- a musical equivalent of Saturday night mailbox bashing . * Southern Culture on the Skids plays tonight at Fuzzyland , Mr. T ' s Bowl , 5621 N . Figueroa St. , Highland Park , 9 p.m. $ 6 . ( 213 ) 969-1433 . LORRAINE ALI</TEXT>
