   <TEXT> With computer capabilities , it would be possible to produce through cross reference of payrolls and their employee data , an introduction service to people who would like to share rides to and from work . Through this cross-reference process , computers could print out the names of people , their addresses and phone_numbers of those working in the same ZIP_codes and living_in the same ZIP_codes . This introduction service matchup would then enable people to team_up and share rides , thereby helping to relieve the crisis caused by the earthquake . Jack Moran Oxnard</TEXT>
