   <TEXT> One of the most significant changes taking_place in the practice_of_medicine is the rise of the corporate physician -- a change some people greet with skepticism . What , no Marcus Welby ? Of course , there is a huge gap between the myth of Marcus Welby and the reality of America ' s health_care system today . This development of the corporate physician is , however , not something to fear , but rather something to cheer . It is the best answer to our national health_care crisis -- if you value good_health care , careful attention to outcomes and reasonable costs . More and more , patients are receiving their care from physicians and other health_care professionals who are employees of -- and often partners in -- medical groups or health_maintenance_organizations ( HMOs ) . Americans are seeing corporate physicians in group settings instead of visiting solo practitioners in private offices . Health_care is increasingly paid through prepaid capitation ( fixed fee per patient per month ) instead of the traditional fee-for-service . Those of us involved in prepaid group practice see every day how this trend can significantly improve the quality of health_care while decreasing costs . We see , through the success of many of Unified Medical Group Assn. ' s members , that this is good for both doctors and patients . We are convinced that prepaid group practice represents the future of health_care in America . Group practice permits the sharing of important data related to medical outcomes , quality of care , utilization of resources , clinical information and medical / legal risk . With this shared data , medical groups can develop comprehensive programs to assure , manage and improve quality . They can examine their systems and practices , and conduct peer_review and patient satisfaction studies -- all with the goal of improving every aspect of health_care_delivery . As electronic clinical information_systems and automated patient medical_records become more readily available , groups will be able to analyze sophisticated outcomes data and identify &quot; best practices &quot; guidelines for improving quality and reducing costs . Such activities are virtually impossible in an individual practice setting . In group practice , multiple health_care professionals -- primary-care physicians , specialists and ancillary providers -- can work together , drawing_on a bank of information , to assure a continuum of care . The group setting also lends itself to effective ambulatory case management in which case managers help &quot; shepherd &quot; frail and catastrophically ill patients through a complex medical system . All of these factors lead to better outcomes . In the fee-for-service world , clinicians , hospitals , drug_companies and ancillary providers get paid only when they do something . Traditionally , fee-for-service care tends to be reactive rather than proactive . Doctors wait for &quot; sick people &quot; to seek care , hospitals wait for doctors to admit &quot; sick people , &quot; drug_companies wait for doctors to prescribe medication to &quot; sick people &quot; . . . and the beat goes_on . Historically , fee-for-service care has not focused_on wellness , disease prevention , patient education or early diagnosis and treatment . In fact , traditional indemnity insurance often did not cover such programs . The focus was_on episodic ambulatory care and acute hospital_care of &quot; sick people. &quot; Prepaid health_care takes the opposite approach . It takes_care of people while they are still well and tries to keep them that way . People don ' t want to be patients . They want to be_well and stay well . If they are not well , they want to get_well quickly and without an economic burden . In a health_care system of capitation , physicians , medical groups , hospitals and HMOs , all_of whom are &quot; at risk &quot; financially , have identical goals . All are rewarded financially for promoting wellness and preventing illness . To help meet these goals , physicians are encouraged to focus_on case management and continuity of care and to provide high-quality ambulatory care that helps prevent acute inpatient care . Prepaid group practice aligns the goals of the provider , the insurer and the patient . The corporate physician , working within the prepaid group practice , is thus freed from the management burdens placed upon the private practitioner . He or she has the opportunity to focus_on what a physician does best -- the practice_of_medicine . Consumers should be pleased with the advent of the medical group-affiliated &quot; corporate physician. &quot; These physicians learn to focus_on prevention first , and then on early intervention and expeditious treatment . They learn to become partners with their patients with the common goal of good patient health . All these factors favor improved quality and cost-effectiveness . It is a proven system that is already working for millions of Americans . Let us not lament the passing of Marcus Welby . The corporate physician will do a better job .</TEXT>
