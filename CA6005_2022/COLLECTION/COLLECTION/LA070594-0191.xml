   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; TEETH CAN SAY A LOT ABOUT HEALTH ; EXAMS : REGULAR VISITS COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE . SIGNS OF MANY ILLNESSES , SUCH AS AIDS OR CANCER , SHOW_UP IN THE MOUTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Regular dental check-ups can reveal more_than just cavities and other toothy problems . Sometimes a dentist can diagnose trouble elsewhere in the body because the first symptoms of many diseases show_up in the mouth . The mouth , doctors say , is like a mirror to the rest of the body . &quot; The variety of tissues in the oral_cavity represent so many similar tissues in parts of the body where it would be hard to readily detect a problem , &quot; says Dr. Alvan Sheath , an oral pathologist and specialist in diseases of the mouth at the University of Texas Health Science Center , San Antonio . Here ' s a guide to what the gums , teeth , bone , tongue , salivary_glands and soft tissues can say about your health : * Dental X-rays not only expose cavities , but may identify bone diseases by showing excessive bone growth or loss . * X-rays may also reveal secondary growths of breast , lung , colon and prostate cancers , Sheath says . &quot; A tumor within the jawbone may be the first tangible indication of the problem. &quot; * Non-functioning adrenal_glands may cause skin pigmentation changes inside the mouth , and pigmentation changes around the mouth can signal lower gastrointestinal tumors . * Non-functioning salivary_glands , or dry mouth , may be the result of an overly stressful lifestyle , Sheath says . &quot; Salivary glands shut_down when people are anxious. &quot; * In some instances , an undetected heart_attack may be felt as pain in the teeth and jaw . When all other dental problems are ruled_out , a sharp dentist will consider heart_attack as a possibility , Sheath says . * Pale tissues and gums or a very red tongue can indicate blood_disorders . * An enlarged tongue can suggest thyroid trouble . * Gum disease may signify diabetes , vitamin_C or D deficiency , or infectious viruses . &quot; If we find there ' s no other reason for severe gingivitis or lesions in the mouth , we question the patient further and may send them to be tested ( for HIV ) and then onto an appropriate physician , &quot; says Dr. Chih-Ko Yeh , an assistant_professor specializing in infectious_diseases / dental diagnostic science at the University of Texas , San Antonio , which has one of the nation ' s leading dental_schools . * HIV and AIDS may also manifest themselves as mouth ulcers . Candida infection , tuberculosis , vitamin_B deficiency and allergies are also conditions that can produce ulcers . * And what if you have a toothache ? Most times , a toothache is just a toothache .</TEXT>
