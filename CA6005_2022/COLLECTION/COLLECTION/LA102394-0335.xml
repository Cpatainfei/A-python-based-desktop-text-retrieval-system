   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CLINTON TAKES POLICY GAMBLE WITH SYRIA VISIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton faces a serious foreign_policy risk in his decision to visit Syria , a country linked with some of the deadliest acts of terrorism ever undertaken against the United States . The White_House has calculated that the visit will pay_off in pushing_forward the Middle_East peace process . But the regime of President Hafez Assad is unlikely to reciprocate with the kind of dramatic concession needed to prove the risk was worth taking , senior U.S. officials acknowledge . As a result , the Clinton_Administration may come_away looking_like it is endorsing one of the Middle_East ' s most brutal regimes -- and regretting the precedent of visiting a country officially listed as a sponsor of terrorism . Damascus has eased its stance on negotiating with Israel , which has broached the possibility of giving_up the strategically valuable Golan Heights in return for peace with its longtime enemy . But Syria remains a one-party state with a ruthless leader who slaughtered up_to 25 # 000 of_his_own people during a 1982 uprising in Hama . Assad also allegedly supported the groups held responsible_for the 1983-84 suicide bombings of two American embassies and U.S. Marine headquarters in Lebanon . The blasts killed more_than 300 Americans . Policy analysts say Clinton ' s visit may leave the wrong impression . &quot; A visit to a home capital is quite a huge concession . Presidents don ' t go_to other capitals to criticize . They go_to endorse or show respect , &quot; said Robert Satloff , director of the Washington Institute on Near-East Policy . &quot; But the merits of this trip need to be measured by the potential for gain as well as risk . And the gains could be considerable in achieving a clear change in Syrian behavior on issues such_as terrorism or winning from Assad a clear statement of his vision of peace with Israel. &quot; But some interested parties were angered by the news . In a letter faxed to the White_House , a woman whose 20-year-old daughter died at the hands of terrorists said she was outraged by Clinton ' s decision . &quot; You may say that you are seeking peace , but you are in fact rewarding terrorism with such a meeting , &quot; said Susan Cohen , whose daughter , Theodora , died in the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland . Syria and Iran were initially believed to be linked to the bombing , but subsequent evidence led to the indictments of two Libyans . &quot; Assad has never renounced terrorism , and a half-dozen of the most notorious terrorist organizations in the world operate under his protection in Syria and Syrian-controlled Lebanon , &quot; Cohen wrote . Clinton acknowledged such concerns Friday , admitting that the issue of Syria ' s relationship with terrorists had been the subject of much debate among advisers . Yet despite the risks , Administration officials and foreign_policy experts on Saturday described the decision as sound . The State_Department ' s annual &quot; Patterns of Global Terrorism &quot; lists Syria as one of seven nations that sponsor terrorism , a distinction it has held since the list was first published in 1979 . The others are Libya , Iraq , Iran , North_Korea , Cuba and Sudan . Although it says there is no evidence that Syrian officials have been directly involved in planning or executing terrorist attacks since 1986 , the State_Department report says several radical terrorists maintain training camps or other facilities in Syria or Syrian-controlled Lebanon . Among these groups are the notorious Abu Nidal group , Ahmed Jibril ' s Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command and Islamic Jihad -- all_of which are opposed to the Middle_East peace process . Others include the Japanese Red Army and anti-Turkey Kurdish groups . The report notes , however , that Syria has taken steps to restrain the international activities of some groups . In July , 1993 , Damascus helped cool escalating tensions between Lebanon and Israel by inducing Hezbollah militants to end rocket attacks on the northern Galilee region . On Friday , Lebanese militants fired five volleys of rockets into Israel . A State_Department official said Saturday that the United States &quot; tries not to draw conclusions from a single act . We look_at a pattern of behavior . &quot; We expected that Syria would keep Hezbollah from making such attacks , but we don ' t want to go overboard in interpreting one attack , &quot; the official said . &quot; Most of the incidents along the border this year have been small and isolated. &quot; Several Middle_East specialists said Saturday that the best way to deal with Assad on terrorism issues is through direct engagement . &quot; History suggests that we do better when we talk to Assad and work with him rather than when we try to ignore him or let him stew , &quot; said Richard Haass , a George_Bush Administration Middle_East strategist who is now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . The Bush_Administration invested considerable time in communicating and meeting with Assad , with two major payoffs , Haass said . Assad joined the U.S.-led Persian_Gulf_War coalition , and he went_to the 1991 conference in Madrid that inaugurated the current peace effort . The strategy is a sharp contrast with that of 10 years ago , when the Ronald Reagan_Administration tried to cut Assad out of diplomacy , and the Syrian leader turned_around and helped sabotage a May , 1983 , agreement -- mediated by the United States -- on Israel ' s withdrawal from Lebanon . &quot; The fact that he ' s on the terrorism list should not get_in the way of trying to work with him on the peace process for two reasons , &quot; Haass said . &quot; First , foreign_policy is about priorities . I would argue right now the priority is to bring peace to the region . Second , the best way to get Syria to cooperate on terrorism is to bring them more deeply into the peace process. &quot; Syria is still a long way from getting its name removed from the U.S. terrorism list -- or reaping the resulting rewards . U.S. law mandates that an Administration has to certify two things before a country can clear_away its terrorism status , according to the State_Department ' s counterterrorism office . First , the country must refrain_from terrorism or support of terrorism for at least six months . That includes refusing to grant logistic , financial and political support and refusing haven , aid or comfort to terrorist organizations . Second , the country has to give &quot; credible assurances &quot; that it will no longer engage in terrorism or support of terrorism . The White_House then makes a determination when it is satisfied with the assurances and notifies Congress 45 days before the country is to be taken_off the list . Once its name is removed , sanctions on arms sales are lifted . Although Congress cannot stop a country from getting_off the list , both houses can pass a joint &quot; resolution of disapproval , &quot; which would block any new arms transfers . Syria is unlikely to be taken_off the list before the new &quot; Patterns of Global Terrorism &quot; is published by the State_Department in April .</TEXT>
