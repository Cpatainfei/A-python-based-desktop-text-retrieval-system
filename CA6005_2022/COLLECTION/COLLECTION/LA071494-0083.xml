   <HEADLINE> SUMMER FRUIT ; GARDEN FRESH ; DRIBBLER ' S DELIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Of all_the luscious summer fruits that dribble down our chins , peaches are the dribblingest . Some summers , peaches are great . Other summers -- well , you could build a rock wall with the fruits pretending to be ripe . And once off the tree , they just don ' t ripen as sweet as they could . So grow your own ! If you have a patch of well-drained soil in full sun that ' s about 15 feet around , and if you plan it right , you can pick tree-ripened peaches in parts of June , July , August and even September -- heavenly flavored peaches the_likes_of which you can ' t buy anywhere . How ? Plant three peach_trees of equal vigor two feet apart in a triangle , each with a later fruiting time . Each mature tree will give you at least two weeks of glorious peaches for eating fresh -- and perhaps for putting_up . Peach_trees like their winters cold , their springtimes warm and dry and their summers hot . But peach people have been working away on cultivars that will produce good-tasting peaches in which these elements are marginal . Little of Southern California is classic peach territory , but now we have peaches that will ripen everywhere . Here in the mountains near Idyllwild , our season begins in June with Early Redhaven , scrumptious yellow freestones on a prolific small tree . In our garden , they ripen over several weeks . Late in July comes Polly peach , a delicious and delicately blushed white freestone . In late August , we can pick Indian Blood Clings such_as Thomas_Jefferson grew . Crimson through and through , with marvelous white peach flavor , these are beautiful fruits . If you live_in the High Desert , you can also start picking in June with Gold_Dust , a yellow freestone with exceptional flavor . The Nectar variety ripens in July , and some consider it the best-flavored white freestone of all . You can also grow Indian Blood Cling for August , or wait for White Heath Cling , a superb peach that matures in the high desert in September . White Heath has a particularly long blooming period . Frost can be a problem late in the blossom season , especially in the Low Desert . Flordaprince ripens very early -- sometimes in late April -- producing lots of yellow semi-clingstone peaches of good quality . Midpride is a fine yellow freestone that ripens in July . However , in the Low Desert , it might be wiser_to grow genetic dwarf trees in tubs . Genetic dwarf peach_trees have been bred to stay four to six feet tall once they mature . Their blooms are exceptionally beautiful , being thick on the limbs . They are adaptable to all_of Southern California and are easy to move_into a convenient spot ; just use a large redwood planter or half-barrel ( give the container rollers for easy moving ) . Plant two genetic dwarf peaches in a container for best pollination , mulch with manure , keep stringently pruned , and let the soil mix dry_out just slightly between deep waterings . Two small trees with low chilling requirements are tasty yellow freestones : Southern Sweet , which is early , and Southern Rose , which is midseason . Add fresh soil mix to the top third of the container every spring . You can even grow one standard peach_tree in a very large container . Just prune the roots as well as the branches every couple of years when the tree is dormant . In those parts of Southern California where there aren ' t many hours in January and February below 45 degrees ( called chilling hours ) , you might plant in your three holes Flordaking -- a red-blushed yellow clingstone of high_quality that ripens late May ; then Shanghai , a juicy , wonderfully sweet white freestone for July -- or Santa Barbara , a very peachy yellow peach ; and for August , aromatic yellow freestone August Pride . You ' ll plant slender , leafless bare-root trees in late winter or early spring ( in the mountains , plant in spring ) . Whether you get_it through the mail or from a local nursery , bare root means the little tree is shipped without soil after being dug while dormant -- when it ' s leafless . In a state of suspended animation , the tree can endure a two-day trip through the mail . Companies ship varying sizes of trees , so inquire before you order . You can bring a potted peach_tree into your temperate garden any time of the year . In cold winter areas , wait till spring . When you plant , tip each tree in the triangle slightly outward and remove the largest inside branches . Standard peach_trees start bearing when they ' re three years old ; dwarf trees can bear the first or second year . Life_expectancy for a peach_tree is about 20 years , although production may decline sooner . This year ' s fruit was formed on last year ' s growth . Once it has offered_up fruit , that piece of branch will never bear again . What insures that there will be new branches this year to bear next year ' s fruit ? Heavy pruning . Probably more_than any fruit_tree , peaches respond to being cut_back -- in fact , unpruned trees grow cranky and miserable . On its own , a standard peach_tree ( most of the best flavors come_on standards ) will grow to 15 feet tall , but you can keep the height down to where you can just stretch to pick from the top branches , and you can trim_back width to suit your space . Your peach_tree will respond to all this pruning by growing more lush . While the tree is dormant , either cut each branch back by one-third , or cut_back two of every three branches . Once the peaches are set , thinning is imperative . Otherwise branches break under the load and next year ' s crop is severely reduced . Thinning results in bigger , sweeter peaches on a healthier tree . Wait until fruits are an inch or so across , then pick so they ' re a hand ' s breadth apart . When a tree receives 30 inches of rain divided evenly through the year , it doesn ' t need to be irrigated . In fact , peaches from trees receiving only about 20 inches of water annually are smaller and fewer , but they ' re sweeter and more flavorful than those receiving more water . This is called dry farming -- it ' s the way Native_Americans raise incomparable peaches in the Southwest . In good soil , the only food you should give a peach_tree is a six-inch mulch of well-aged rabbit or steer manure in early spring . The biggest problem you might encounter is peach leaf curl -- it happens when winters are wet . If such a winter is forecast , cover the tree with white or brown ( not clear or black ) plastic between mid-December to mid-February ; don ' t tie the bottom . Or place the tree under an overhang where it won ' t get wet . Birds will take their share unless you use a bird scare . A bright yellow plastic balloon with big glinting eyes is the only thing I ' ve found that works . You hang one on a limb for every 85 square_feet . Alter the balloon ' s position every week or 10 days during peach season -- the birds think : Good grief ! It moved ! It ' s real ! When is a peach ripe for picking ? Press the bottom ever so gently . If it gives to the pressure , the peach is ripe and will come_off the branch with a touch . In addition to eating_out of hand and wiping_off the dribbles , we celebrate peaches in cobblers , pies , turnovers , tarts and crisps , as pickles , preserves , marmalade and cold peach soup . But is there any better way to enjoy peaches than slicing them into a bowl , sloshing over the cream and shaking on powdered sugar ? Yes . To me , fresh peach_ice_cream is the treat of summer treats . My feeling is , don ' t stint on the cream and don ' t make ice_cream unless the peaches are perfumed and ultra-peachy . And make_it Philadelphia-style . Rather than cloud the subtlety of ripe fruit with thickeners and emulsifiers such_as flour and egg_yolks , Philadelphia ice_cream is pure fruit , cream , sugar and vanilla -- the cleanest , clearest flavor . Second only to the quality of ingredients , the most crucial thing about homemade ice_cream , I think , is to serve it while it ' s soft -- within an hour or two of churning . This isn ' t the usual advice , but I find that great cold blunts the flavor . Should your cream freeze hard , leave it at room_temperature 10 to 20 minutes until it softens enough to stir into fluffiness .

Peaches that are still firm may need 30 to 60 seconds . Lift_out with a slotted spoon , then slip_off skin . Peaches mashed and mixed with sugar may deepen in_color . If they start to turn brown , add a little fresh lemon_juice . Some or even all_of the cream may be replaced with chilled half-and-half .
