   <HEADLINE> ' SMITHSONIAN ' S GREAT BATTLES ' LOSES CIVIL WAR BUFFS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Had the 13-episode &quot; Smithsonian ' s Great Battles of the Civil War &quot; existed in some era before Ken Burns ' landmark epic , it might have been a perfectly suitable television aid for understanding America ' s most dramatic_event . But producer-writer-director Jay Wertz ' s haphazard approach , focusing_on key Civil War battles at the expense of a cogent narrative flow covering the war ' s developments , places this &quot; Civil War &quot; wanna-be far down the list of essential viewing for buffs . Wertz injects one innovation here , but it ' s typically handled in a clumsy manner . Key battles are introduced with a detailed , computer-generated map indicating Northern and Southern lines , the local topography and a map legend -- all_of it resembling a screen image in a CD-ROM program . Unlike CD-ROM , however , the maps flash past with no time to study details . In such complex battles as Shiloh ( described in the second episode , airing Jan . 5 on The Learning Channel ) or even in an elementary shoot- ' em-out like First Bull_Run ( airing in tonight ' s opening episode ) , the strategic subtleties employed by generals in the field are thus glossed_over . Narrator Richard Dreyfuss sounds urgent about his business , but he never really makes any of these battles come_alive . Dreyfuss has to carry the series on_his_own ( with occasional visits by other actors such_as Charlton Heston as Lincoln ) , since the series ' extremely conventional use of period paintings , photos and film of re-created battles makes this the most visually dull of all TV Civil War projects . An exception occurs in the second episode , which surveys the war ' s early naval_campaigns , highlighted by the standoff between the Union ironclad ship Monitor and its Confederate opponent , the Merrimack ( which Wertz calls &quot; The Virginia &quot; ) . For the first time in the series , we get a sense of the war as these two ships fire at each other . If only the rest of this history ( or , at least , the two episodes reviewed ) were as dynamic . Even the reliable historian James McPherson ' s commentaries aren ' t enough to guide us through the program , which often grinds to a halt with such dull passages as -- believe it -- the technology of guns in the 1860s .</TEXT>
