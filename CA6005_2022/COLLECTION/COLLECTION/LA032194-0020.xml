   <TEXT> I am writing to express my shock and dismay at the cover pictures of Saturday ' s Times ( &quot; Executions Underscore Bophuthatswana Chaos , &quot; March 12 ) . I have seen you publish numerous photos showing dead_bodies , murder victims , the results of mayhem of all types.Never before have I seen a picture of a man begging for his life , followed by such a complete description of how he died moments later . Somehow we have become desensitized to pictures of death . But to show a helpless human being about to be murdered takes a step over the boundary . It does not matter whether that person is male , female , white , black , brown , blue or green . Murder is an affront to all human_beings . PATRICK W . HUBER Anaheim We must_not bury our heads in the sand and pretend that such problems do not exist , but , I ask that you steer away from sensationalism and shock value when searching for &quot; worthy &quot; news_items .
