   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : WOODLAND HILLS ; PANAH MURDER TRIAL TO REMAIN IN VALLEY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Woodland Hills man accused of kidnaping and murdering an 8-year-old girl will be tried in the San Fernando Valley , a judge ruled Tuesday . Defense_attorney Robert Sheahen asked Superior_Court Judge Sandy Kriegler to move the capital murder trial of Hooman Ashkan Panah to a courtroom downtown or in Santa Monica . He argued that the disappearance and slaying of Nicole Parker in November received extensive pretrial publicity , especially in the Valley , and that prospective jurors were tainted by news_reports . Panah , who lived near the child ' s father in a sprawling apartment complex on Ventura Boulevard , was charged with the child ' s murder after her body was found in a suitcase in his closet . Sheahen also argued that Lori Parker , the slain child ' s mother , works as a paralegal and is dating a well-known Valley attorney , giving her a &quot; special relationship &quot; with the Valley ' s courts . But Kriegler agreed with Deputy Dist . Atty . Peter Berman that Panah , 22 , could still receive a fair trial in Van Nuys Superior_Court since the publicity has diminished since the Nov . 20 slaying . The case returns to court Sept . 26 when other pretrial issues are likely to be raised . Among them : a motion by the defense to exclude a statement Panah made to police and a motion to exclude a blood-spattered notebook that was found in his car . The notebook contained an apology to the child ' s family but blames the killing on &quot; evil , psychotic &quot; people . Sheahen said he will seek to keep the jury from hearing Panah ' s statement , saying the suspect spoke_to police after he was given Haldol , a powerful anti-psychotic medication , by an emergency_room physician . The drug , administered to calm him , may have influenced his decision to speak with police , Sheahen said . Panah , who was indicted by a grand_jury in February , has pleaded not_guilty to seven counts , including murder , kidnaping and sodomy . Prosecutors have said they will seek the death_penalty if he is convicted of first-degree murder . ANN W . O ' NEILL</TEXT>
