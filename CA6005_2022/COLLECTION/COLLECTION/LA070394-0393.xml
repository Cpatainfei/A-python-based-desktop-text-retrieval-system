   <HEADLINE> POP_MUSIC : TAKING_STOCK OF A GRIM YEAR IN ROCK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kurt Cobain ' s suicide last April tore the heart out of contemporary rock ' n ' roll in ways that haven ' t begun to be repaired . One life does make a difference . Nine Inch Nails and Hole delivered terrific , four-star albums during the last six months , but neither they nor any other release has filled the emotional void . For all_the alienation and anger in Cobain ' s music , Nirvana ' s records offered a sense of celebration and hope -- even if those qualities weren ' t strong enough in Cobain ' s own life to eventually save him . With Nine Inch Nails , Trent Reznor makes music that is largely without hope -- an examination of despair that starts where Cobain left_off . If Cobain were still alive to balance Nails with his more uplifting music , Reznor ' s journey into the darkness would have been compelling enough to reach a wider audience . The album , a masterpiece of the genre titled &quot; The Downward Spiral , &quot; should have been a runaway hit . With Cobain ' s death , however , the record became almost unlistenable . It remains an absorbing work , but this is a time when even the most hard-boiled fan wants some comfort -- and it ' s not surprising that the Nine Inch Nails album has spiraled rapidly down the charts . Hole , the Seattle quartet led by Cobain ' s widow , Courtney Love , has run_into a different problem . Because she was known outside the rock underground more as the notorious Mrs . Cobain than as the major talent she is , the new album was viewed with suspicion by much of the rock public . In addition , Hole ' s record company , DGC , was powerless to promote the album , &quot; Live Through This , &quot; because it would have smacked of exploitation . Love was also in no condition to tour , so the band was not_able to state its own case live . Hole was dealt yet another blow last month with the death of bassist Kristen Pfaff . After just two months , the album is out of the Top 100 on the nation ' s charts . While the following albums stand as the 10 best works so far this year , it may be several more months before any album ( Pearl Jam ? Neil Young ? R.E.M. ? ) rekindles the spark and finally helps remove the black armband that continues to surround contemporary rock . * 1 Nine Inch Nails , &quot; The Downward Spiral , &quot; ( Nothing / TVT / Interscope ) . Trent Reznor explores human emptiness and despair with chilling fearlessness in this landmark collection . &quot; I am the pusher , I am the whore . . . I am the need you have for more , &quot; he snarls in one especially sobering passage that focuses_on contemporary obsessions and addictions . Rather than a celebration or acceptance of nihilism or decadence , the album stands as an anguished cry_for something to believe_in . * 2 Hole , &quot; Live Through This , &quot; ( DGC ) . This album virtually gallops with imagination and spirit -- a work that combines in its best moments the rock self-affirmation of Patti Smith with the intimacy and candor of Leonard Cohen . Though far more accessible musically than the band ' s 1992 indie debut , Hole has sacrificed none of its individuality or bite . Love ' s voice and words fluctuate between abrasive and caressing as she explores both matters of personal commitment and private doubt . * 3 Pavement , &quot; Crooked Rain , Crooked Rain , &quot; ( Matador ) . There are dangers when a band reminds you of too many influences ( think Counting Crows ) , so it may be waving a red flag to suggest that Pavement offers echoes of everyone from Lou Reed and Gram Parsons to Elliott Murphy and Thurston Moore . Yet Pavement doesn ' t use the influences to prop_up its music . The tracks here assert a convincing sense of genuine youthful optimism and discovery . * 4 Bikini Kill , &quot; Pussy Whipped , &quot; ( Kill Rock_Stars ) . Anarchy for the Northwest ? This Olympia , Wash. , band , with its punk defiance and feminist declarations , recalls the revolutionary command of the Sex Pistols . Like that classic British band , Bikini Kill brings_together two seemingly contradictory elements ( pure sonic rawness and songwriting savvy ) . The result is music that seems inaccessible on first listening , but ends_up sticking_with you like the Pistols ' best . * 5 Beastie Boys , &quot; Ill Communication , &quot; ( Capitol ) . Eight years after proving in &quot; Licensed to Ill &quot; that white boys can rap , the Beasties -- who combine a sort of Three Stooges goofiness with streetwise hip-hop resolve -- return with another extraordinary party record . The heart of the sound is in the irresistible beats , but the talk is fun , too , touching_on everything from music ( Lee Dorsey and Bob Marley ) to hoops ( Bobby Knight and Anthony Mason ) without missing a step . * 6 Sonic Youth , &quot; Experimental Jet_Set , Trash and No Star , &quot; ( DGC ) . The problem with some acclaimed veterans ( dare we say Elvis Costello ? ) is their work begins sounding labored , as if making music has become a responsibility . The wonder of these acclaimed veterans is they still make music that is joyful and alert . * 7 Beck , &quot; Mellow Gold , &quot; ( DGC ) . &quot; I ' m a loser , baby / So why don ' t you kill me &quot; is as inspired a snarl for the ' 90s as Dylan ' s &quot; Like a rolling stone &quot; chorus was for the restless ' 60s -- all_the better because Beck ' s line can mean anything to anybody . The rest of the folk / hip-hop union is no &quot; Blonde on Blonde , &quot; but Beck has a quirky , questioning intelligence and spunk . * 8 Johnny Cash , &quot; American Recordings , &quot; ( American ) . One of the cornerstones of modern pop_music steps back into the creative forefront with an album that is as simple ( just voice and guitar ) as it is affecting -- tales of sin and redemption delivered with the intimacy and urgency of someone who has learned his lessons well . * 9 The Auteurs , &quot; Now I ' m a Cowboy , &quot; ( Virgin ) . Luke Haines , the suffering poet who guides this English outfit , writes_about desire and doubts and bizarre relationships with the kind of sweeping sentimentality and awe that has been absent from the heart of rock since Bowie did_it in the ' 70s . * 10 Latin Playboys , &quot; Latin Playboys , &quot; ( Slash / Warner Bros. ) . Los Lobos ' Louie Perez and David Hidalgo join with Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake for more of the experimental World Beat sounds that made &quot; Kiko &quot; such a soulful and spirited work . The tone is primarily playful and relaxed .</TEXT>
