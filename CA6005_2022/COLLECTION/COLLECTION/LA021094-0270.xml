   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : READING BETWEEN THE BUDGET NUMBERS ; TAXPAYERS NOT GETTING THE MOST FROM R &amp; D DOLLARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Unless they want to be typecast as ingrates , America ' s competitiveness constituencies better have few complaints about the Clinton_Administration ' s proposed science and technology budget . Judged strictly by the numbers , the President ' s package unquestionably delivers the goods during a time of intense fiscal austerity . While virtually every_other budget segment got nicked , the Administration asked_for more_than $ 71 billion in spending -- excuse me , investment -- for federally funded research and development in fiscal 1995 ( beginning Oct . 1 ) , roughly a 4.1 % increase over current levels . Of that , the civilian R &amp; D budget would climb $ 1 billion , to $ 32 billion . The biggest single sci-tech winner has to be the Commerce_Department ' s National Institute for Standards and Technology . The former National Bureau of Standards has seen its budget explode from $ 381 million in 1993 to $ 520 million in 1994 to next year ' s proposed $ 935 million -- an 80 % increase in a single year . The reason ? Clinton ' s competitiveness cabal believes the NIST ' s Advanced Technology Program can be an effective venture_capitalist in critical technologies -- a civilian counterpart to the Pentagon ' s historically successfully Advanced Research Projects Agency . Can an agency that has had a modest record of funding accomplishments preserve quality through this sort of scale-up ? that ' s a question that may come_back to haunt the Administration in 1996 as Americans ask what returns they are getting for their government ' s high-tech investments . Other winners include the National Institutes of Health , with a 4.7 % increase to $ 11.5 billion , including money earmarked for both AIDS research and breast_cancer analysis ; the National Science Foundation , which supports more_than half the nation ' s non-medical basic research at universities ; global warming research , and Vice_President Al Gore ' s multimedia-hyped information superhighway , which would see its funding rise to more_than $ 400 million . The Administration was generous toward the Human Genome Initiative . Even NASA -- which faces a $ 250-million trimming of its $ 14.5-billion budget -- came_out a winner . Here ' s an agency with a confused mission , a series of recent multibillion-dollar fiascoes on its launch_pads and orbits and a space_station proposal that has been transformed from a symbol of U.S. space leadership to a medium for international cooperation between America and the old Soviet_Union ( or is that the New Russia ? ) . NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin -- as savvy a federal technocrat as they come -- is lucky the Administration didn ' t completely re-engineer his agency . Then again , given that Housing and Urban Development and Veterans Affairs share NASA ' s congressional subcommittee , he ' d better be careful when the House comes_down . Clearly , when even performance losers can be budget winners , America ' s science and technology establishment knows it has a friend in the White_House . But true friends had better do more_than open their wallets and pick_up the checks . This Administration ' s budget proposals ignored several opportunities to give taxpayers more R &amp; D value for their dollar . For example , the Administration is still struggling with how best to manage the nation ' s multibillion-dollar network of national labs in the post-Cold War era . One proposal is that up_to 20 % of a lab ' s budget be contingent upon finding matching funds from industry to pay_for specific research programs and projects . That way , labs are forced to become more market-oriented and industry-sensitive . Instead , the Administration has opted to push for more collaborative ventures between industry and the labs without attaching any particular market incentives . Consider the information superhighway effort . Does_it make_sense for government to invest more in digital R &amp; D alongside industry ? Or should government money go_into the creation of standards and special procurements that would boost private-sector initiatives ? These are the questions that the euphoria over the technology budget has unfortunately obscured . At the core of the problem is performance measures : How does the Administration determine the effectiveness of its competitiveness funding ? When you are funding research for the sake of advancing knowledge , the bottom_line is secondary . When you are funding research and development to stimulate economic_growth and enhance U.S. competitiveness in key technologies , how do you know you ' re getting your money ' s worth ? How do you know you ' re coordinating your investments appropriately ? In fact , the Clinton_Administration is in the process of completely revamping its science and technology infrastructure . The Federal Coordinating Council for Science , Engineering and Technology , run_out of the White_House , has been dismissed as toothless . Now there ' s going_to be a new national Science and Technology Council , which will absorb the National Space Council , the National Critical Materials Committee and the FCCSET . It ' s supposed to be_on par with the National Security_Council and Bob Rubin ' s National Economic Council . President Clinton is supposed to chair the new committee . One of the biggest questions in Washington ' s technocracy is whether the President will be actively involved or will defer management to his vice_president . Is this merely inside-Beltway baseball ? Absolutely not . For better or worse , this is an Administration that is putting taxpayer ' s money where its mouth is in the high-tech arena . This is an activist Administration that wants to become even more activist . Who gets_to run the show has enormous implications for everything from defense conversion to biotech to Silicon_Valley to Route 128 . Prediction : Next year ' s science and technology budget -- and how it ' s coordinated -- will be far more interesting to watch than this year ' s .</TEXT>
