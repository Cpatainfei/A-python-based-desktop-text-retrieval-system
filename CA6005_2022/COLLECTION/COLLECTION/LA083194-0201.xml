   <HEADLINE> COUPLE TO STAND TRIAL IN DEATH OF ROBBERY WITNESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Los Angeles couple were ordered to trial Tuesday on murder and conspiracy charges for the slaying of a witness to a 1991 Orange County computer_store robbery . William Clinton Clark , 40 , and Antoinette Yancey , 26 , face a possible death sentence if convicted of killing Ardell Williams last March in Gardena . In addition , Municipal Judge B . Tam Nomoto in Santa Ana ordered Clark to stand trial for a second killing . He faces murder , robbery and other charges stemming from the slaying of a 49-year-old woman who stumbled upon an armed robbery at a Fountain Valley computer_store . Kathy Lee was shot once in the head on Oct . 18 , 1991 , in the parking_lot of CompUSA when she came_to pick_up her teen-age son , who worked_at the store . The judge ' s decision Tuesday came following an unusual five-week preliminary hearing in which witnesses were videotaped to preserve their testimony because one prosecution witness in the case already had been killed . Prosecutors allege that Williams , 22 , of Gardena , was shot to death in a Gardena parking_lot because she was a witness to the computer_store robbery and slaying . Clark is accused of plotting the killing from his jail_cell , while Yancey is accused of carrying_out the killing . Defense_lawyers Jack M . Earley and Gary L . Proctor , however , said the couple had nothing to do with either killings and had argued before the judge that the prosecution lacked evidence to prove such charges . Two other defendants , one of them Clark ' s younger brother , have been convicted of first-degree murder for Lee ' s death during the computer_store robbery . Eric D . Clark and Nokkuwa ( Pretty Boy ) Ervin , the alleged triggerman , await sentencing in Orange County Superior_Court . Both William Clark and Yancey remain in custody without bail . The murder_charges against the couple carry special circumstances , making them eligible for the death_penalty should prosecutors decide to pursue such action .</TEXT>
