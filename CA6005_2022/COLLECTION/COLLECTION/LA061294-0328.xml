   <HEADLINE> U.S. DILEMMA : IS KOREA DISPUTE REASON FOR WAR ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is the U.S. dispute with North_Korea over nuclear_weapons really worth risking a second Korean_War ? That is the blunt question facing the Clinton_Administration as North_Korea stubbornly refuses to allow international inspection of a nuclear plant and the Administration pushes for U.N. economic sanctions that Pyongyang has warned it would consider an act of war . Although some dismiss the North_Korean warnings as bluster , senior Administration policy-makers and outside analysts caution that the country ' s aging leader , Kim Il Sung , is erratic enough to make military conflict a serious possibility . &quot; The President is headed for a Rubicon on this issue , &quot; said Peter A . Wilson , a former State_Department strategist who has been keeping tabs on the U.S.-North Korea dispute . And the decision on whether to cross , he said , may_not be very far off . By any measure , the stakes are substantial -- far greater than in Haiti , Bosnia-Herzegovina or any of the world ' s other current hot spots . Intelligence reports suggest that North_Korea is poised to launch a major push in its nuclear_weapons program , despite the threat of sanctions . CIA officials say North_Korea already may have one or two nuclear_weapons in_stock and could well have five more bombs by the end of the year and 30 to 40 within two years . Moreover , Pyongyang is rapidly developing intermediate-range missiles that could easily carry such warheads to Japan . Both U.S. and foreign analysts warn that if North_Korea acquires a nuclear arsenal , it could turn the strategic balance in Asia upside down and set_off a regional race for nuclear_weapons involving South_Korea , Taiwan and Japan , which now are nuclear free . And rogue states such_as Iran and Libya , which already buy missiles and other conventional weapons from North_Korea , might be able to acquire nuclear arms from Pyongyang as well , seriously threatening the West . But if the risks of inaction are great , the consequences of action could be grave as well . Most military analysts are confident that , 41 years after the first Korean_War ended in a stalemate , the United States and South_Korea ultimately would win decisively if the North invaded South_Korea -- but only at the cost of enormous casualties . With 1.1 million North_Korean troops now massed near the border , current estimates are that allied troops could suffer as_many as 18 # 000 casualties in the first few days of a war . The United States now has 37 # 000 troops in South_Korea , and South_Korea has 650 # 000 . And unless the North_Koreans decided to bypass Seoul for tactical reasons , South_Korea ' s prosperous capital city most likely would end_up in ruins . &quot; It ' s not a pretty picture , &quot; said Robert W . Gaskin , a former Pentagon strategist who now is a vice_president of Business_Executives for National Security , a defense-monitoring group . North_Korea ' s war rhetoric reached a new stridence last week when it renewed its warnings to the United States and Japan not to miscalculate the possibility of military conflict . The North_Koreans bluntly told Japan that it would be &quot; unable to evade a deserving punishment. &quot; In such a climate , opinion here is sharply divided over how far the United States should go_to prod North_Korea to abandon -- or merely to halt -- its nuclear program . The bottom-line question is whether it should risk a new war . &quot; The simple answer is no -- but you can ' t say that , because the whole concept of deterrence is the ability to threaten things you don ' t mean , &quot; said Janne Nolan , a Brookings Institution nuclear_weapons expert . &quot; It ' s a question of at what point do you stop ? &quot; &quot; The trick is to orchestrate this in a way that puts so_much pressure on the North that they are intimidated and back_away , &quot; said Leonard S . Spector , a Carnegie Endowment national security analyst . But conservatives such_as Henry Sokolski , a former Pentagon nuclear_weapons expert , argue that while enforcing the international nuclear inspection program is laudable , Clinton is misguided in hinging U.S. policy on North_Korea ' s refusal to cooperate . Although international inspections are useful , Sokolski said , &quot; their urgency is highly overrated . . . . They certainly are not worth going_to_war over or pleading for U.N. sanctions to secure . Nor are they worth making any further concessions to North_Korea to obtain. &quot; Rather , he asserted , &quot; if U.S. officials are really serious about addressing the North_Korean threat , they would do_well to back_off their preoccupation with nuclear inspections and instead get_on_with the serious business of containing . . . the North_Korean regime. &quot; That would mean drawing North_Korea into broader negotiations designed to make the country more prosperous and to coax it into unification with the more democratic South . &quot; Once you change the ( North_Korean ) regime , you can get satisfaction , &quot; he said . Others argue that the Administration is making too_much of the current &quot; crisis &quot; with North_Korea . The United States did not react nearly this strongly when Pakistan , India and Israel acquired nuclear_weapons , they reason . Why , they ask , is North_Korea ' s case any different ? Jack Mendelsohn , deputy director of the Arms Control Assn. , a private arms control group , has identified some of the reasons : * Unlike North_Korea , the governments of Pakistan , India and Israel are not members of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and therefore are not legally obligated to allow international inspectors to catalogue their facilities . * Although India and Pakistan frequently have threatened each other , none of the three countries has used its nuclear_weapons to threaten general destruction . By contrast , North_Korea has a track record of terrorism around the world . * North_Korea ' s nuclear_weapons , unlike those of India , Pakistan and Israel , might prompt Japan to build a bomb , a move that almost certainly would spur other Asian_countries to go nuclear and change the entire security balance in the region . To many analysts , the Clinton_Administration is partly responsible_for the current standoff with North_Korea . The United States backed itself into a corner by declaring from the start that the crucial issue in the dispute would be North_Korea ' s compliance with the non-proliferation treaty . Even more critical , the Administration ' s apparent waffling on the issue -- it seems to have swung from conciliation to dire warnings and back several times within a month -- has failed to provide a clear signal that Washington means business and is willing to go_to_war . Policy-makers have publicly rejected suggestions that the United States launch a preemptive strike to knock_out North_Korea ' s nuclear_weapons plants . The facilities are buried deep underground , and an attack would almost surely lead to war . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry has repeatedly said that Washington is unlikely to consider military_action unless it sees evidence that the North is about to invade South_Korea again . &quot; We will not provoke a war , &quot; he has told reporters . At the same time , one proposed set of sanctions would impose a naval_blockade to help enforce a U.N. trade_embargo -- a move that North_Korea would almost certainly consider provocative . And pressure for firm action is growing here at_home . Sen . John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) argues that the only way to make North_Korea listen is to mount a credible military threat . &quot; Clearly , we ' ve got_to prepare_for war , &quot; Sen . Bob Kerrey ( D-Neb. ) said on CBS ' &quot; Face the Nation &quot; program last Sunday . &quot; We ' ve got_to say to the North_Koreans , ' If that ' s the game that you want to play , regrettably we ' re prepared to play it. ' &quot; An ABC News poll last week showed that 48 % of Americans support allied military_action to bring North_Korea into line -- though whether the respondents understood all_the implications of such a policy is unclear . Some analysts remain uncertain about whether the White_House has the resolve to bring the United States to the brink of war to halt the North_Korean nuclear program . Wilson , the former State_Department strategist , worries that the Administration still has not seriously addressed the possibility that the U.S. policy could lead to war . &quot; At this point , it ' s unclear that there has been any systematic effort to think through that question , &quot; he said . Working against Clinton is his failure to carry_through on earlier threats involving Somalia , Bosnia and Haiti . Wilson cautioned that failure to resolve the North_Korean dispute could make Clinton vulnerable to charges that he allowed the situation to get_out of control . Worse yet , he said , &quot; if the United States is perceived as unable to solve this crisis , then the biggest proliferation problem we face will not be with states such_as Iraq and Iran . It will be with our friends , such_as South_Korea and Japan. &quot;</TEXT>
