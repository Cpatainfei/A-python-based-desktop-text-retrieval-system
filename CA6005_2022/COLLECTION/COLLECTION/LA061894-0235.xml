   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; CROWD AT COTTON BOWL ORDERLY , IF NOT A SELLOUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> OK , so it wasn ' t Streisand . An hour before first boot , outside Gate 2 at the Cotton Bowl , 18-year-old Tommy Ray held_up a ticket for Friday ' s World Cup first-round game between Spain and South_Korea . It was Charlie Derrisaw ' s fault . Three weeks ago Ray and a buddy , Cody Moore , purchased three tickets for $ 30 each . All had planned to make the five-hour drive_up from Galveston ; three unabashed soccer geeks with Texas drawls . But Derrisaw bailed_out at the last minute , some lame excuse about a make-up exam in_order to graduate high_school . &quot; We paid $ 30 , we want $ 20 , but we ' ll take $ 10 , &quot; Moore said of the fluid state of ticket negotiations . There were few inquiries . Not unexpectedly , Dallas came_up short in the attendance game . Friday ' s crowd of 56 # 247 was far short of Cotton Bowl capacity , 63 # 998 . Yet it was evident by game ' s end that Charlie Derrisaw had missed a good time , as 2-2 ties go . The worst fears of organizers and local police were not realized . The eight-foot high , chain-linked fence that had been erected -- then partially disassembled -- to protect the players from would-be hooligans , was not needed . While there were no immediate security figures , Sgt . William Darr of the Dallas Police_Department reported the number of incidents was minimal . &quot; It was very smooth as far as I know , &quot; he said . &quot; And this is how I anticipate the rest of the games will be. &quot; Of the nine World Cup venues , Dallas has been the most beleaguered . Not only have first-round ticket sales lagged , there was controversy over whether Dallas police had overreacted in erecting the security fence . &quot; It proved a lot , &quot; Chalese Stachowiak , Dallas venue press officer , said . &quot; It showed the hospitality of the Dallas people , especially the ethnic crowds . There was a lot of security , a lot of eager eyes , but no massive show of force . There were no incidents . You did not see people on the fence. &quot; Stachowiak hopes that Friday ' s game will convince authorities to remove the remaining portion of fence on the field ' s east end . She said Dallas police will meet soon to discuss the possibility . The only thing approaching an &quot; incident &quot; occurred during the opening ceremony when a fireworks sparkler with a mind of its own grazed the frilly suit of a dancing cowgirl . The action was_on the field . The game became entertainment at the point Spain ' s Miguel Nadal received a red-card ejection in the 26th minute , forcing the heavily favored Spaniards to play a man short for the remainder of the game . The strain finally took_hold , as Korea rallied for two goals in the final six minutes to salvage a tie . Fans for both sides were vocal but not raucous . &quot; What pleased me most was that they were not cheering at each other , not provoking , &quot; Andreas Herren , a FIFA official , said . &quot; They were just having a good time . It proved to the Dallas police that these are family people , friendly people . They were not intent_on rioting. &quot; Luis Castillo had his doubts . The 40-year-old computer designer and Dallas resident was born in Peru . His soccer roots reach deep . He was expecting the worst . &quot; I was surprised at the organization , &quot; Castillo said . &quot; The opening ceremonies were wonderful , the security wonderful . We came here to enjoy , not to see things go bad. &quot; No word whether the Galveston boys ever sold their ticket . But , no doubt , Tommy Ray and Cody Moore got their money ' s worth . They conceded it ' s not easy being a soccer fan in Texas , where another kind of football rules . The 17-year-old Moore , a recent high_school graduate , said some teased him for playing in a league in Alvin , hometown of baseball great Nolan Ryan . But Moore plays_on as he collects bits of information on his World Cup idols from a the local Spanish television_station . Ray is among Moore ' s few soccer converts . &quot; I thought it was a wimpy sport at first , &quot; Ray said . &quot; Then I played it. &quot;</TEXT>
