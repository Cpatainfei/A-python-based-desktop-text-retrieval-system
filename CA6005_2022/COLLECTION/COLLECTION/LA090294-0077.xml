   <TEXT> You know Lansing Lamont has his work cut_out for him when you realize that the key point of this book -- Canada could be a serious threat to the United States -- is also the punch_line in a comedy now being produced by director Michael Moore . In Moore ' s Dr. Strangelovian film , a saber-rattling President gives a Niagara Falls sheriff ( played by John Candy ) the bright idea of invading Canada before it invades us . Ha-ha , tee-hee : It ' s hard to get worked_up about this seemingly benign and innocuous &quot; Nebraska North , &quot; a place whose name , one legend goes , comes from Spanish fishermen off Newfoundland who remarked that there was aca nada , nothing here . Perhaps our attitude derives from Canada ' s historical role as a refuge from conflict , not a source of it . In 1776 , 100 # 000 British loyalists found shelter on the shores of Canada ' s St . Lawrence River . In the 19th Century , slaves headed True North on the Underground_Railroad : &quot; Farewell , old_master , &quot; went one hymn , &quot; Don ' t come_after me / I ' m on my way to Canada / Where colored men are free. &quot; And in the 1960s , of course , anti-war protesters found sanctuary in a country where even the prime_minister , Lester Pearson , had to suffer a dressing_down by L.B.J. ( After Pearson spoke out against the American bombing of North Vietnam in 1965 , L.B.J. told him : &quot; You pissed on mah rug ! &quot; ) Even Canada ' s West , certainly wilder than our own topographically , was socially tame , populated not by robber barons , gunslingers and other American-style rogues but by the dutiful employees of the Hudson ' s Bay Company . In the ' 90s , however , Canadians have more_than made_up for their arguably prosaic past with a kind of political pandemonium that makes Ross Perot ' s 1992 &quot; challenge &quot; to our two-party system pale by comparison . In last year ' s elections alone , the nation ' s long-dominant conservative Tory Party plunged from 157 parliamentary seats to two , while the leftist New Democrats retained only eight of their 44 seats . Inciting most of the fervor is the growing desire of many French-speaking Quebecois to secede from Canada ' s 127-year-old confederacy . In the scholarly but stylish &quot; Breakup , &quot; Lamont captures the depth of that desire by painting the scene at a Montreal disco palace Oct . 27 , 1992 , just after Canadian voters had rejected an accord aimed at thwarting secession : As a burst of pyrotechnics engulfs the stage in flashing lights , smoke and whorls of sparklers , Quebec ' s pro-secession leader , Jacques Parizeau , strides onto the stage . &quot; Pounding steel_drums mix with the cheering , &quot; Lamont writes , &quot; to create a pandemonium of sound atavistic , almost feral , in its intensity. &quot; Ten days from today , a similar burst of secessionist fervor is expected to boost Parizeau and his Parti Quebecois into power . If elected , Parizeau has promised to hold a referendum on Quebec ' s secession within a year . While Lamont suggests that the Parti will win that referendum ( it is only &quot; a matter of time , &quot; he writes , before Quebec secedes ) , recent polls show it garnering only 40 % support . In any case , the question remains : Is secession in Quebec ' s , and Canada ' s , best interests ? Lamont ' s answer is a resounding &quot; no. &quot; Strangely , though , his most persuasive arguments counsel just the opposite . Lamont points_out , for example , that the reasons initially motivating Canada ' s disparate peoples to unite -- to ward_off annexation by the United States and to affiliate with Britain , then the &quot; mightiest empire since Rome &quot; are no longer relevant . By contrast , the arguments Lamont musters against secession are generally lame ( Canada will lose its &quot; enviable tradition of civility &quot; ) or alarmist ( if Quebec secedes , he speculates , then who knows , maybe California or Texas will demand independence too ! ) . Fortunately , the jacket cover blurb helps explain Lamont ' s fervent opposition to &quot; breakup. &quot; He is a former vice_president and director of Canadian Affairs for the Americas Society , a U.S. think_tank funded by such corporate interests as the Rockefeller Foundation . And no one is edgier about Canada ' s dissolution than American business : Canada , after all , is by far our biggest and stablest trading partner , and pro-federalist interests such_as the Royal Bank of Canada have been warning that Quebec ' s secession could plunge the country ' s living standard by 16 % and send 1.2 million Canadians pouring into the United States . The truth , of course , is that no one really knows the social or economic costs of Quebec ' s secession . But in a bit of speculative fiction that Lamont uses to conclude his book , he sure makes them seem high . Taking us to a futuristic hydroelectric plant deep in Quebec ' s subarctic forest , he follows an &quot; assault force &quot; of 300 Cree warriors , enraged by conflicts with the province that have been festering since 1990 , when Quebec tried to build a golf_course on an ancient Indian burial_ground . Descending a canyon-like staircase of huge terraces in the plant ' s dam , the Crees attach hundreds of pounds of plastic_explosive to its inner walls . When the charges are detonated later that night , the plant ' s customers in Montreal , Quebec_City and Boston are plunged into darkness .</TEXT>
