   <HEADLINE> TENNIS ROUNDUP ; NAVRATILOVA WINS TO BEGIN LAST YEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Martina Navratilova began her last year of singles competition with a victory Tuesday , beating Japan ' s Mana Endo , 6-1 , 6-3 , in 59 minutes in the first round of the Toray Pan Pacific Open tournament at Tokyo . Navratilova is the defending champion and said afterward that she wanted one more Grand_Slam tournament victory before retiring.She has 18 . &quot; I don ' t care which one , &quot; said Navratilova , who skipped the Australian Open but is looking ahead to Wimbledon and the U.S. Open . &quot; My best chance will be at Wimbledon. &quot; The 37-year-old former world No . 1 is now ranked No . 3 . She said she skipped the Australian Open because it started too early in the season , not giving her enough time to train . With her customary net-charging style , Navratilova broke service in the first game against Endo . She broke again in the third and seventh games . Other Pan Pacific winners Tuesday included Australian Open champion Steffi Graf and Gabriela Sabatini . * Boris Becker returned to the tennis circuit after a two-month layoff and showed no rustiness , beating Britain ' s Jeremy Bates , 6-2 , 6-4 , in the first round of the $ 538 # 000 Marseille Open in France . Becker had been inactive since the beginning of December to devote time to the birth of his son , Noah Gabriel , who was born Jan . 18 in Munich , Germany .</TEXT>
