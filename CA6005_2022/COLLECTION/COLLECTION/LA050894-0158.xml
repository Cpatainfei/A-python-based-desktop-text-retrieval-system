   <HEADLINE> OLD_GUARD VIES WITH SALSA STAR IN PANAMA VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Panama ' s first presidential election since a U.S. military invasion changed the country ' s history has boiled_down to a contest between the onetime political_party of ousted Gen . Manuel Antonio Noriega and salsa star Ruben Blades . The unlikely options in today ' s vote speak_to ways Panama has changed in the five years since the invasion , and ways it has not . The elections also highlight both the success and failure of a U.S. policy designed to build democracy . The conservative coalition government of outgoing President Guillermo Endara , installed by U.S. troops once Noriega was toppled , is highly unpopular , and public anger is turning voters away from the ruling parties . Still , this election is expected to be the fairest and most free in Panamanian history . The winner will control the country ' s preparations for taking_over the vital Panama_Canal and thousands of acres of prime real_estate that become available to Panama as U.S. troops stationed here withdraw gradually by the year 2000 . It is the first time in 25 years that Panamanians will vote for president removed from the shadows of military dictatorship , and it is the first time in decades that the results are likely to be respected . So it may seem ironic to many Americans that the party that the U.S._government battled to oust -- at the cost of 23 American and hundreds of Panamanian lives -- stands a good chance of returning to power . And it may seem unusual that the next most probable victor is a musician and Hollywood actor who has not lived_in Panama for nearly two decades . Ernesto Perez Balladares , the charismatic candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party , or PRD , which backed Noriega throughout the 1980s , is leading the polls with a 3- to 10-point margin . Blades , whose campaign seemed dead in the water a_few weeks ago , places a strong second . Perez Balladares had been the seemingly uncatchable leader for most of the year , but opponents have exploited his past ties to Noriega to erode his support . And the mercurial Blades , who for a long_time seemed ambivalent about the campaign and fell dramatically in the polls , has suddenly taken_to the streets in the last month , shaking hands and offering free salsa concerts to capture the imagination of a generally disenchanted public . Panamanians who believed that democracy and a better way_of_life would be the automatic results of the 1989 invasion that ousted Noriega have been bitterly disappointed . There have been gains in political and personal freedoms and an impressive economic recovery , but few of the benefits have trickled down to the poor . A reduction of the state bureaucracy has cost many jobs , crime and drug_abuse are growing , and many Panamanians see the Endara government as elitist . &quot; We are the real opportunity for change , &quot; Blades told a jubilant crowd of mostly young Panamanians last week in his final campaign rally outside a soccer stadium in one of the city ' s working-class neighborhoods . Wearing a fluorescent orange baseball_cap backward , Blades did more singing than speaking , running_through renditions of the salsa hits that made him an international superstar , including &quot; Decisiones , &quot; which , with its risque subject , was banned in Panama during most of the Noriega dictatorship . Blades launched his maverick candidacy last year , moving from his home_in Santa Monica back to Panama after a self-imposed exile of 18 years . He casts himself as the ultimate outsider , a unique chance to break from the past , and that seems to be a big plus in the minds of voters . Judging by the polls , Blades , 45 , is the only candidate who has a chance -- though a slight one -- at preventing the return of the PRD . Capitalizing on widespread anti-government sentiment while offering old-style populism , Perez Balladares has campaigned tirelessly to distance himself and his party from Noriega . * Instead , he revived the image and memory of party founder Gen . Omar Torrijos , the military strongman who overthrew an elected government in 1968 and ruled until his death in a plane crash in 1981 . Despite his iron fist , Torrijos exploited Panama ' s class and racial differences to appeal_to the poor masses . Perez Balladares , an economist and millionaire businessman , maintains that with Noriega serving a 40-year drug-trafficking sentence in Florida , the party has been purged of its most corrupt thugs . &quot; The PRD of 1994 has absolutely nothing to do with the PRD of 1989 , &quot; he said in an interview in one of several campaign headquarters . &quot; Although ( today ' s party ) may have many of the same people who participated in ' 89 , their philosophy , their behavior , their orientation is totally opposed to what it was in ' 89 . . . . &quot; There is a problem that I have to admit . People still believe the PRD is Noriega ' s party . . . . As long as the American public doesn ' t get_to recognize that this is a different situation , it will be very hard for them to understand why we won. &quot; But his opponents say Perez Balladares ' memory is selective and revisionist . His campaign ads , for example , offer a detailed biographical sketch from his birth until his participation in the negotiations for the 1977 Panama_Canal Treaties . Suddenly , there is an abrupt jump to today , when the candidate is described as a &quot; renowned businessman. &quot; Perez Balladares lost his party ' s presidential nomination in 1984 to a Noriega selection . But he ran the PRD ' s 1989 campaign for Carlos Duque , Noriega ' s handpicked candidate . That election ended in rampant fraud when Noriega annulled results that favored Endara . Perez Balladares has denied participating in the fraud but defends his work for Duque as what he calls a moral_obligation to the party . When thousands of U.S. troops landed Dec . 20 , 1989 , to capture Noriega and destroy his army , Perez Balladares was arrested by the Americans and held for a_few hours until associates applied pressure for his release . Nicknamed &quot; the Bull &quot; because of his enormous neck and bulky build , Perez Balladares has further worried opponents today by naming as his running mate Tomas Gabriel Altamirano Duque , publisher of Panama ' s oldest newspaper , which frequently served as a mouthpiece for the Noriega regime . Despite Perez Balladares ' claim that the party has cleaned_up its act , other well-known Noriega cronies are running_for office on its slate . These include former Noriega spokesman and close friend Mario Rognoni , who is a candidate for the legislature . And the party ' s president , Gerardo Gonzalez , is seen as a hard-liner whose son is the prime suspect in the killing of a U.S. soldier on the eve of former President George_Bush ' s disastrous 1992 trip to Panama . &quot; The question is , how changed is the party , and it ' s an unknown , &quot; said a source familiar_with U.S. policy . &quot; The question is , how effectively will ( Perez Balladares ) be able to marginalize the radicals and whether that ' s his intention. &quot; Businessman Roberto Brenes , who is directing the campaign of another candidate , said : &quot; The problem is not the Bull but the tail . Can he manage all_of the people who come_with him ? If the ticket is any indication , you can expect about one-third of his people to be corrupt and one-third to be opportunists. &quot; Opponents also fear that those military_officers who once swore allegiance to Noriega are waiting in the wings to resume prominent roles in government . Perez Balladares has pledged not to rebuild the military , which the Americans disbanded after the invasion . Perhaps one explanation for the revival of the PRD can be found in El Chorrillo , a slum neighborhood that was bombed by the invading Americans . One day last week , five women were seated on the stoop of a tenement_house . It was near noon , but there was nowhere else they had to be . &quot; Life was very much better &quot; under Noriega , Suzanne Lovet said as her neighbors chimed_in and echoed her . &quot; You used to have work . Now you have nothing . ( The Americans ) give the money , but we didn ' t get_it . . . . For the last four years , we don ' t get anything . No jobs , no money and no house . The rich people getting richer , the poor people getting poorer . Just like that. &quot; &quot; With the dictatorship there were more jobs for the poor people than with the democracy , &quot; said Mare Angulo , 33 , an unemployed mother . Blades seems to recognize the phenomenon of the PRD popularity and has styled his own campaign -- with less success -- to channel the anti-government discontent . &quot; They ( the PRD ) are back strong because of the spectacular failure of the parties , the other traditional parties , in not just solving problems but showing compassion for people in Panama , &quot; he said last week . &quot; The PRD brings memories to many people of a time , whether paternalistic or not , ( when ) there was an effort made to take into consideration the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged and the disenfranchised. &quot; Endara ' s coalition , a mishmash of conservative_parties that banded_together as the so-called Civilista Movement to oppose Noriega , won the 1989 elections but was prevented by Noriega ' s henchmen from taking_office . Only after the invasion was Endara sworn_in , during a ceremony at a U.S. military base . * But under Endara , many of the supposed sins of Noriega -- corruption , nepotism and the money-laundering of drug dollars -- continued apace . Endara is barred constitutionally from seeking reelection . His coalition proceeded to commit political suicide by failing to agree on a single candidate and splitting apart . Two of the governing parties are running separate and not particularly charismatic candidates : Ruben Dario Carles , a gruff-voiced and cantankerous 73-year-old former controller , and Mireya Moscoso de Gruber , whose principal qualification seems to be that she is the remarried widow of Arnulfo Arias , a legendary politician who was thrice elected president in the 1940s and 1960s -- and thrice overthrown by the army . Some analysts see the demise of the ruling coalition and the resurrection of Noriega ' s old party as an indictment of U.S. policy , a policy doomed to fail because it focused_on the military problem of Noriega without focusing_on the political aftermath . &quot; They ( the U.S._government ) handed power over to people who didn ' t represent anyone , who had won elections but under a set of completely different rules , where everyone was supporting them because they didn ' t want the military , &quot; said analyst Marco Gandasegui , who heads Panama ' s Latin_American Studies Center . &quot; People saw that Endara didn ' t solve any problem , so a lot of people now are saying give us back ( the PRD ) . . . . It tells you the degree of frustration that exists. &quot;</TEXT>
