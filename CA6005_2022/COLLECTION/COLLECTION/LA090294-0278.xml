   <HEADLINE> RESTAURANT REVIEW ; ENTICING BLEND OF FLAVORS ; AT JIN HUNG WON , CHINESE DISHES PAIR WITH KOREAN INFLUENCES TO PRODUCE PUNGENT , SOMETIMES FIERY , RESULTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Part of food ' s magic is the way a transplanted cuisine changes to suit local tastes . Chinese cuisine is the most chameleonic of all , as will be noted by anyone visiting the very good Jin Hung Won in North Hills . Chinese emigrants have evolved distinctive cooking styles in each country they ' ve moved to . As a result , the Chinese of Vietnam cook quite differently than their counterparts in Japan . Very little a Bangkok Chinese family eats looks_like anything you ' d see on a Chinese table in Seoul . At Jin Hung Won , the kitchen is influenced by Korea , which happens to be my favorite non-Chinese-speaking country for a good Chinese meal . I ' ve never had a bad dinner in a Korean-Chinese restaurant , and I don ' t put that down to chance . Korean Chinese clearly have a distinctive style , at once tasteful and forceful ; they use oil sparingly , apply chiles with gusto and favor clean , unmuddled flavors . From a short distance , you may_not even realize that Jin Hung Won is a Chinese restaurant . It ' s located in a Korean strip mall , a long , slightly neglected-looking development where all_the storefronts are emblazoned with signs_in the blocky ( and , once you get_to know it , logical ) Korean script . Inside the restaurant is a large , well-scrubbed , almost sterile-looking series of dining_rooms , the only real decoration being a Renoir print on one wall and a large Chinese screen hidden in a corner . The language you hear being spoken is Korean ; clientele is largely Korean Americans , who come_to order the special cold noodle dishes ( posted on the wall , also in Korean script ) and enjoy the home-style Chinese dishes . Begin a meal here with a plateful of light , ethereal suei chow , literally &quot; water dumplings. &quot; These steamed dumplings , which come eight to the order , feature an airy filling of lean pork and chopped green vegetables sealed_in a light , chewy noodle skin . Enjoy them with kimchi , the spicy , partially fermented cabbage that appears at every Korean meal . Kimchi automatically comes_with everything here , no matter what you order , but in practice you might have to ask_for_it if you do not look Korean . ( &quot; I thought Americans didn ' t like pickles , &quot; apologized our waitress. ) Noodles are terrific here too , especially the ones posted on the wall . Ask_for cha jiang min , which are sticky wheat noodles in a mysterious-looking brown_sauce . The sauce is really no mystery -- it ' s full of dried tofu , minced bamboo and chopped mushrooms . Champon is a huge bowl of ramen-type noodles , fish_cakes , shredded pork and vegetables . The soup is flavorful on its own , but if you are daring enough , you might want to add a spoonful of the fiery house chile sauce , which turns it into a special treat . ( I repeat : if you ' re daring enough. ) The richest section of this menu may be the poultry dishes . Spicy crispy chicken might share the name of a sandwich served at Jack In The Box , but any resemblance ends there . This chicken has crackling skin and tender , juicy meat that falls_off the bone -- and it ' s bright red from having been dipped in a hot chile sauce . For $ 9.95 you get half a Chungking-style duck , which is basically Peking duck without the trimmings . Fried chicken with hot_sauce is like something you might find in Texas , a batter-fried bird dipped in more of that same killer hot_sauce . There is even a dish called stewed chicken with cayenne_pepper , but the wrinkle in the nose of the waitress convinced me it was going_to be too hot for our group . Standard Chinese restaurant dishes are not ignored , and quite a_few of them are far more tasty than their cliche names might suggest . Shrimp with green_peas , for example , is a dish you might pass right by unless you knew the shrimp were squeaky-fresh , the peas_green and crisp and the sauce lightened by billowy clumps of egg_white . Pan-fried fresh scallops are nicely browned and straightforward in flavor , and vegetable favorites such_as black mushroom with bamboo_shoot are aromatic and crunchy . Adventurous palates can take_on oddly textured delicacies like sea_cucumber with braised pork , while those who like rustic Chinese food will be pleased by a dish such_as stewed meatballs -- half_a_dozen fine , fatty pork meatballs with heavily browned crusts . I never eat here without having this dish . The meatballs come_in brown_sauce with cabbage and bok choy , making a perfect supper with a mound of fluffy white_rice . By the way , the back page of the menu is_full of Korean dishes . I suppose somebody must order them , but I ' ve never seen them on anybody ' s table . Just for the record , they ' re typical Korean fare such_as barbecued short ribs , broiled mackerel , farmhouse-type dishes like bin dae ttok ( a griddled mung_bean omelet / pancake ) and a variety of spicy soups . This is America , remember . We ' ve got_it all here . . . if you just know where to look . WHERE AND WHEN Location : Jin Hung Won , 9102 Sepulveda Blvd. , North Hills .
