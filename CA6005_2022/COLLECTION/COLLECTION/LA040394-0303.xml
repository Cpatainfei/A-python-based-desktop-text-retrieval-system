   <HEADLINE> PILOT ' S SON MAY HAVE CAUSED AIR CRASH IN RUSSIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A teen-ager reportedly allowed to play pilot in the cockpit may have caused last month ' s crash of a Russian-leased Airbus jet that killed 75 people , Moscow media reported Saturday . The Russian commission investigating the crash in Siberia has yet to announce its official findings , but it did say Saturday that tapes from the plane ' s &quot; black_box &quot; recorder show that guests were visiting the cockpit before the Airbus A-310 went_down . Four Moscow newspapers reported that &quot; children ' s voices &quot; appear on the cockpit tapes . The commission ' s specialists are still working_on identifying the voices and the exact causes of the crash , a spokesman told the Interfax news_agency . But Russian media were already full of a mind-boggling -- though still unofficial -- account of how the pilot ' s son may have accidentally sent the Airbus into an unstoppable nose dive by hitting a switch that turned_off the autopilot . * If true , the story of how the plane crashed will do much to cement Russian civil aviation ' s reputation as unsafe . Although the Airbus , made by a consortium based in France , appears to have been mechanically sound , it may have been done_in by lax Russian discipline . According to the English-language Moscow Times , which carried the most complete account of the crash , the flight from Moscow to Hong Kong on March 22 had been under-booked , so about 30 airline employees and family members came_along for a free trip . Among them was the 15-year-old son of Capt . Yaroslav Kudrinsky , the Moscow Times said , quoting Aeroflot and Transportation Ministry officials who asked to remain anonymous . The plane flew under the aegis of Russian International Airlines , the international branch of Aeroflot . &quot; Cockpit voice recorder readings indicated that the youth inadvertently knocked_off the autopilot and fell against the control column as his father and other crew_members stood behind him , &quot; the Moscow Times said . When the plane then plunged into a nose dive from its flying height of 33 # 000 feet , the adults were apparently thrown_off their feet , unable to reach the controls of the plane immediately . The dive became so steep that the crew could not correct it , the Moscow Times said . Among those aboard were 23 foreigners , including one American . None of the passengers or crew survived when the plane hit the tundra near the Mongolian border . Valery Eksuzian , the head of Russian International Airlines , told Interfax on Friday that the Airbus crew was &quot; not to blame. &quot; He said that analysis of radio contacts indicated that &quot; the plane started to act in ways which were not programmed into the autopilot . Judging by their exclamations , the crew was greatly surprised. &quot; Eksuzian heartily denied a French television report that none of the crew_members were in the cockpit just before things went_wrong . But no officials have denied that the pilot ' s son caused the crash . Russia ' s NTV television network reported Saturday that Kudrinsky let his son , Eldar -- whose age was given as 16 instead of 15 -- take his seat in the cockpit and went_back into the cabin . When the trouble started , another pilot who happened to be among the passengers jumped to the controls to try to save the plane but failed , NTV said . It said the boy ' s blood showed traces of barbiturates . The Russian crash commission has been analyzing the recordings with Airbus manufacturers in France , according to the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda . The commission ' s conclusions are expected in about a week and a half . The crash was so mysterious that officials had originally speculated that it might have been caused by a terrorist ' s bomb , but they now rule_out that theory . Mechanical failure also appears to be ruled_out . * It would seem , the Vechernaya Moskva newspaper wrote , that &quot; the reason for the tragedy was the human factor . Namely , that the pilot gave his seat to his 16-year-old son , let him ' drive. ' &quot; &quot; Of course , this is hard to believe . But if you think_about it , after a spontaneous ' that ' s impossible ! ' something else comes_to_mind : How coincidental are the catastrophes happening more and more often in our skies ? &quot; Vechernaya Moskva asked . &quot; Has the splitting of Aeroflot into more_than 200 companies really strengthened discipline ? &quot; In fact , discipline in the unified Aeroflot of the former Soviet_Union had not been good either . Pilots routinely took bribes to allow passengers without tickets to fly with them -- sometimes in the cockpit itself -- and technical difficulties in the aging Soviet fleet abounded .</TEXT>
