   <HEADLINE> SWISS POLICE IDENTIFY CULT LEADER ' S BODY ; CAUSE OF DEATH UNKNOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Swiss police confirmed Thursday that cult leader Luc Jouret was among the dead found in the Order of the Solar Temple ' s fire-gutted chalet in the alpine village of Granges-sur-Salvan . Jouret apparently perished along with 52 of his followers in last week ' s grisly round of blazes , slayings , bludgeonings and unexplained deaths among members of the apocalyptic order based in Switzerland and Canada . Swiss authorities did not say how Jouret , 46 , a Belgian doctor , had died . Chief pathologist Thomas Krompecher said his body bore no trace of bullet_holes . Only one top temple official , Jean-Pierre Vinet , remains unaccounted for . Early theories of a mass suicide have given_way , under revelations from Quebec and Swiss police , to evidence of well-orchestrated execution-style slayings on both sides of the Atlantic on Oct . 4 and 5 . About 15 bodies still have to be identified as they are burned beyond recognition . Jouret was identified by his dental records . Some of the victims were alive , possibly comatose , at the time of the electronically triggered fires . Others had been shot , some repeatedly , or beaten to death , police said . Among the known leaders of the decade-old Order of the Solar Temple , only Vinet , often described as the cult ' s financier , remains at_large or as yet unidentified . The body of Joseph di Mambro , described as the behind-the-scenes &quot; dictator &quot; of the order , has been identified among the dead in Switzerland , along with his wife and son . Authorities in Australia have joined those in Europe and North_America looking_into reports of money-laundering and arms trafficking . A Swiss newspaper , L ' Hebdo , on Thursday quoted Australian banking sources describing a Jouret associate opening an account last year with a $ 93-million deposit .</TEXT>
