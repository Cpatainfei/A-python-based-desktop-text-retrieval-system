   <TEXT> Before age 40 , all Dennis McAuliffe Jr . knew about Sybil Bolton , his Osage maternal grandmother , was that she had attended an East Coast boarding school , died alone of kidney_disease at age 21 with her infant daughter at her side , and was buried in an ermine coat . Three years later , McAuliffe , a Washington Post foreign editor , unraveled the mystery of his American_Indian grandmother ' s murder . He chronicled his life-shaking discoveries in his book , &quot; The Deaths of Sybil Bolton , An American History , &quot; recently published by Random House . Inspired by his son ' s 1991 birth , McAuliffe traced his grandmother ' s 1925 death to the &quot; Osage reign_of_terror , &quot; when hundreds of Osages were murdered by white settlers who wanted their land and oil wealth . &quot; My son ' s heritage has placed upon small shoulders a burden so great that a mighty nation has been unable to carry it , or chooses not to , &quot; he wrote . &quot; He must find a way to balance the two sides of himself , to find a place in his life for the Indian part of him , which continues to have no place , or part , in his society . That is his challenge , and his curse . That is my gift to him. &quot; McAuliffe , 44 , an award-winning journalist who has worked in Europe and Latin_America , did not set_out to rewrite history . However , as he tells his family ' s story , he evokes voices rarely quoted by U.S. historians . &quot; In a mystery , the guy always gets his man , and there ' s always justice , and everybody ' s happy , &quot; McAuliffe said during a recent Denver visit . &quot; Well , the strings in real_life weren ' t tied . And nobody was happy -- except for the bad_guys who walked away with the Osage millions. &quot; A real-life murder mystery , his book is punctuated by tales of Indian warfare , Gen . George Custer , Thomas_Jefferson , gunfights in Dodge City and haunting reflections about six generations of McAuliffe ' s family , his ethnic identity , and his painful experience with alcoholism . As his family story unfolds , he rattles a_few beloved perceptions about settlers in America ' s Old West , taking a stark look_at one famous illegal Kansas squatter -- Pa Ingalls of &quot; Little House on the Prairie &quot; fame . &quot; The real Charles Ingalls wore a 2-foot-long vinery of beard . His dark , narrow , hard , glassy , chilly , creepy eyes would , a century later , stare out of photos of Charles Manson , the Hollywood murderer , &quot; he wrote . McAuliffe , described by his sister as &quot; the new Indian storyteller , &quot; has no qualms about writing the Osage side of the story in what some would deem an era of political correctness and historical revisionism . &quot; Why not tell both sides of the story ? Why not say that was Osage territory and that they were squatting . Why not tell that story ? Because it ' s a very one-sided presentation , &quot; McAuliffe said about the Ingalls family . &quot; Why does ( Pa ) have to look_like Michael Landon ? Why can ' t he be a hard-eyed guy who would absolutely give you the creeps . Because that ' s what settlers looked_like . Is that revisionism , or is that being a realist ? Is that telling an honest story ? &quot; he said . To get his story , McAuliffe left his comfortable Baltimore home_in 1991 , returning to Pawhuska , Okla. , for three months to research the murder scene . He also spent three years poring over history books , press reports , birth records and FBI documents . He learned Sybil Bolton ' s death , like the deaths of most murdered Osages , was papered over with a false death certificate . Sybil ' s murderer , identified in the end , had powerful reasons to kill the beautiful , well-educated young_woman . Her birthright included a large annual income based on historic tribal oil holdings or &quot; headrights. &quot; In 1907 , each Osage , regardless of_age or amount of Osage blood , was given a headright worth 657 acres of land in what would become Oklahoma ' s Osage County . A year earlier , Congress had adopted an allotment act for the tribe , not realizing Osage land sat atop one of the biggest oil fields in North_America and the tribe would become the richest ethnic_group in the nation . From the day a 15-year-old McAuliffe learned his grandmother was Osage and had died at an early age , he suspected his white grandfather is responsible . He set_out to solve Sybil Bolton ' s death with that disturbing thought in mind . While McAuliffe later vindicated his innocent grandfather , he cannot reconcile himself to Harry Bolton ' s general dislike of Indians . &quot; My mother would explain to us children that her father ' s prejudices were unfortunate , but not unusual for a man his age who lived_in places in the Midwest where prejudice grew like the weeds and wildflowers coloring Kansas , &quot; McAuliffe wrote_about Bolton , a Denver resident who died of throat cancer in 1981 at the age of 81 . Now a &quot; card-carrying &quot; Indian journalist , he has undergone an extraordinary metamorphosis since identifying with his Osage roots . McAuliffe is an enrolled member of the tribe , and has a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood , the official Indian identification card . &quot; Now , there ' s still a lot of distrust in a native gathering , and initially with the Osages , &quot; McAuliffe said . &quot; Here comes this white guy -- blue eyes , brown hair -- he suddenly announces that he ' s an Osage , and this is_after a decade or years of white guys coming_in , you know , the ' wannabes , ' and there ' s some of that . And they held me at arm ' s length. &quot; Any doubts he had about whether his book has struck a note with the Osage were dispelled during a mid-September talk and book signing_in Fairfax , Okla . Dozens of Osage and non-Indians showed_up , toured murder sites and revealed to a stunned McAuliffe their own horror stories about mysterious suicides and poisonings in their families . &quot; A reconciliation is coming_out of this . And , I felt just flabbergasted that it had to be me who did this , &quot; he said . &quot; I looked_around and all those faces of Osages , born and raised and living_in Osage County and taking_part in all_the Osage functions . And one of those could have been my mother , and should have been my mother , &quot; McAuliffe said . &quot; And , luckily for me , the Osages agreed with me. &quot; Glimpses of Grandmother Excerpts from &quot; The Deaths of Sybil Bolton , An American History &quot; : &quot; It has been difficult for me , shaped and surrounded all my life by my parents ' love , to accept the realization that , to a greater degree , my destiny was shaped by hatred manifested in the extreme ; that the history I carry within me is colored by racial discrimination of the most violent kind -- directed against one half of my ancestors by the other half. &quot; &quot; As much as a father can , I will see_to_it that my son does not shirk from his responsibility by ignoring his true identity -- as I did . If he does , I fear , he will be doomed to repeat the upheaval that shook me , literally to my roots . That was my grandmother ' s gift to me. &quot; &quot; For half of my life -- well , one-third of it now -- I was just an ordinary , run-of-the-mill white kid like everyone else I knew , with nothing ethnically extra that met the eye , no footnotes to the Great American Success Story that my father embodied. &quot; &quot; Like all American kids , I ' m a sucker for Custer stories . My reason , though , is different from our national , morbid fascination with Custer ' s Last Stand . . . . I lived_in Custer ' s house . And it was haunted . By Phil Sheridan ' s wife . This story is as juicy as it sounds. &quot; &quot; Little Laura Ingalls , her sisters and their beloved Ma and Pa were illegal squatters on Osage land . She left that detail out of her 1935 children ' s book ' Little House on the Prairie , ' as well as any mention of ongoing outrages -- including killings , burnings , beatings , horse thefts and grave robberies -- committed by white settlers , such_as Charles Ingalls , against Osages living_in villages no more_than a mile or two away from the Ingalls ' little house. &quot; Associated Press</TEXT>
