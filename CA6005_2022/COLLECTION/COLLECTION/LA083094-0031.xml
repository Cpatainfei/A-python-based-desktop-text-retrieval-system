   <HEADLINE> GOP HEALTH PLAN COULD THREATEN STANDARD BENEFITS , AUDITORS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The health reform proposal offered by House Republican leaders could have the unintended consequence of raising the cost of standard insurance plans , threatening their very existence , the Congressional Budget Office said Monday . House Republican Leader Robert H . Michel of Illinois is pressing Democrats to use his plan as the basis for congressional action now that House Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) has conceded that Congress is unlikely to pass the kind of broad-based plan proposed by President Clinton . Michel proposes expanding the availability of catastrophic health_insurance plans that pay_for specified medical_expenses exceeding $ 1 # 800 a year for an individual and $ 3 # 600 for a family . To cover out-of-pocket expenses , Michel would allow individuals to establish tax-sheltered medical savings accounts . The CBO , in a 10-page analysis , said such a plan could prove attractive to relatively healthy individuals , who expect few out-of-pocket expenses but still want insurance in case they unexpectedly become severely ill . If that happens , the people left in standard health plans will be relatively sicker and older , driving standard-plan premiums so high that even sick people will find it cheaper to opt_for minimal-coverage catastrophic plans , the CBO said . The agency said Michel ' s plan would be good for the budget_deficit , reducing red ink by $ 11.3 billion over 10 years . But it would do almost nothing to curb growing health_care expenditures and little to expand insurance coverage , the CBO said . It said an additional 2 % of the population could acquire coverage as a result of subsidies Michel proposes .</TEXT>
