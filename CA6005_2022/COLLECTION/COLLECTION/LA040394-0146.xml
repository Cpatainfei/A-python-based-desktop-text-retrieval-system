   <HEADLINE> TECHNOARTS ; IN CYBERSPACE , CAN ANYONE REALLY APPRECIATE ART ? ; CD-ROMS ARE GIVING HOME COMPUTER USERS ACCESS TO MUSEUM AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS . BUT SOME INSTITUTIONS ARE HOLDING_BACK FROM THE DIGITAL AGE FOR FEAR OF LOSING_CONTROL -- AND DOLLARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japanese art collector Joe Price hunkers down at his computer in his Orange County home , pops a disc in his CD-ROM_drive and calls_up a digital image of one of his prized possessions -- an exquisitely detailed 18th-Century painting of a rooster by Ito Jakuchu . Zooming_in on the feathers , Price points_out bits of artistry that might go unnoticed in the painting itself . &quot; Look here , &quot; he says , magnifying a fluid stripe on one feather . &quot; There are no brush strokes , just a continuous flow of color . Isn ' t that amazing ? &quot; Price claims to understand no more_than the next computer dunce about how photographs of paintings are transformed into digital reproductions . The process of converting an image to electronic_signals in a series of ones and zeros , or digits , and then reassembling them in a precise likeness of the original is a mystery , he says , but he is enthralled with the possibilities . A retired oil man who gave the Los Angeles County Museum of Art $ 5 million to launch its Pavilion for Japanese Art , which opened in 1988 , Price has promised a major portion of his collection to the museum . Now he is making the artworks available to the public on a $ 195 CD-ROM published by Digital Collections Inc. in Berkeley . &quot; This is the most fascinating way of looking_at art . You can see and learn more from the computer than from the painting , &quot; he says . &quot; You can color correct the images to natural light . You can enhance and sharpen the picture . You can even compare the real_thing with a fake , &quot; he adds , bringing_up a pair of images to demonstrate differences between the work of Jakuchu and an imitator . Wrapping_up a demonstration of his CD-ROM ' s bells and whistles , Price presents his visitor with a souvenir -- a startlingly high-quality color reproduction of the rooster painting , which rolls_off a printer connected to the computer . This is the brave new age of art appreciation , and Price is far from its only acolyte . While &quot; Masterworks of Japanese Painting : The Etsuko and Joe Price Collection &quot; offers art lovers more_than 1 # 100 full-color images ( including 350 complete works and nearly 800 details ) , along with seven searchable data fields , descriptive commentary , artists ' biographies and an introductory movie with narration and music , other products just now coming_on the market provide equally enticing access to museums ' art_collections : * DCI has published a $ 250 CD-ROM featuring 138 paintings at the venerable Frick Collection in New York . The disc includes an introductory essay by Frick Director Charles Ryskamp , descriptions of artworks by the museum ' s curatorial staff and detailed artists ' biographies by art_historian Joseph Goldyne . The Berkeley firm -- a spinoff of AXS / Optical Technology Resource Inc. , which developed the Image Access software program -- is now at_work on a CD-ROM of the Brooklyn Museum ' s ancient Egyptian collection . * Microsoft Corp. , the computer software giant masterminded by Bill Gates and located in Redmond , Wash. , has published &quot; Art_Gallery , &quot; a $ 79 CD-ROM featuring more_than 2 # 000 images from the collection of London ' s National Gallery . The program is based on the London museum ' s Micro Gallery , an interactive information_system , designed by the_British firm Cognitive Applications Ltd. , which allows visitors to peruse the collection at computer kiosks . * Another Gates company , Continuum Productions Corp . in Bellevue , Wash. , is purchasing non-exclusive digital reproduction rights to works in other museums ' collection for an immense archive of pictures that can be viewed electronically . So far , Continuum and its predecessor , Interactive Home Systems , have purchased rights to the entire collection of London ' s National Gallery and large portions of holdings in the Seattle Art Museum , the Russian Museum in St . Petersburg , the Philadelphia Art Museum and the Barnes Foundation in Merion Station , Pa . * Trident Software , Inc. in Vienna , Va . is producing a series of $ 39.95 computer-savers , called &quot; ArtScreens , &quot; which add an element of art education to software programs designed to prevent burn-in when a computer is turned_on but not in_use . The first of the series , &quot; Great Master Collections , &quot; features 40 reproductions of works from such renowned institutions as the Louvre in Paris , the National Gallery in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York . The images can be programed to appear at random or sequentially , and users can call_up descriptive text on any of the artworks . * The National Gallery of Art in Washington , which already has produced two videodiscs on portions of its art holdings , recently announced plans to install its own version of London ' s Micro Gallery , in collaboration with Cognitive Applications Ltd . * The Art Institute of Chicago has produced and marketed an interactive computer_game -- inviting children to go_on a pre-Columbian treasure_hunt or deconstruct a Louise Nevelson sculpture by touching a color monitor -- as well as laser discs based on the permanent collection and an electronic catalogue of the complete works of Chicago painter Ed Paschke ' s work . A current project , undertaken with Voyager of New York , is an interactive program on ancient art that will enable museum visitors to view both sides of coins , rotate statuary and connect the objects to appropriate maps and illustrations -- all by touching a computer_screen . * In Los Angeles , the J . Paul Getty Trust ' s Art History Information Program is establishing an information and standards organization for digital imaging in the visual arts . And the trust has joined Eastman Kodak Co . in a new venture , LUNA Imaging Inc. , which will offer digital imaging services and electronic publishing to the academic community . As its first project , LUNA is compiling a digital archive of architect Frank Lloyd Wright ' s drawings for an electronic publication . But stunning as all these developments may be -- particularly to art specialists who developed their expertise by studying actual artworks , books and slides -- digital imaging hasn ' t exactly taken the art world by storm . For every collection that is turning_up on a disc or being scanned for future multimedia projects , there are many museums that haven ' t joined the revolution or are merely using the new technology for in-house operations and collections management . Not that they haven ' t been invited . Electronic publishers who are hungry for content have been knocking_on museums ' office doors for several years . Neither are museums holding_back because of concern that digital images will replace real artworks or that their audience will turn_into mouse potatoes , the computer-literate generation ' s version of the couch potato . Art professionals agree that digital imaging can be expected to increase museum audiences through education and outreach . * What ' s keeping museums from plunging into the digital age of art reproduction is fear of losing_control -- of both a lucrative licensing system and the artworks ' integrity . &quot; There are too many uncertainties , &quot; says Mary Grace Whalen , of the education_department at New York ' s Metropolitan Museum of Art , which has made extensive in-house use of digital images but has declined to license large blocks of images to electronic publishers . &quot; We don ' t know what the market will be . We don ' t know the value of the material or how it will be used . And , as material and technical processes tend to become cheaper , it may_not be necessary to get some big company to do the conversion process , &quot; she says . Janice Sorkow , director of photo services at Boston ' s Museum of Fine_Arts , agrees . &quot; Digitalization is a reality and it is only going_to get better , &quot; she says . &quot; One of the missions of the museum is education and dissemination of information . But once you give permission for digital reproduction , you don ' t know how it will be used . We are wrestling with policies and standards for getting the information out there. &quot; Museums hold copyrights to photographic images of many , though not all , works in their collections . The exceptions are works whose copyrights have expired and are now in the public_domain , and pieces whose copyrights are held by artists or their estates . Publishers who wish to reproduce museums ' copyrighted images -- or the museums ' photographs of works in the public_domain -- must have their requests approved and pay_for one-time publication rights , at a cost of $ 200 to $ 500 per image . This practice not only generates income for museums , it allows them to control how the images are used . Sending digital images of artworks out into the world renders the concept of one-time use obsolete and exposes the images to an unimaginable range of use and abuse , many museum technicians and administrators say . Even fervent advocates of digital imaging agree that opportunities for piracy and manipulation are inherent in the technology -- and that apparent obstacles can be subverted with the right equipment and expertise . &quot; We are at a primeval stage in this ooze , &quot; says Maxwell L . Anderson , director of the Michael C . Carlos Museum at Emory University who is organizing a panel on digital technology for the Assn . of Art Museum Directors , to be held June 1-4 in Seattle . The directors are expected to study a complicated maze of legal , technical and commercial issues concerning digital reproductions of artworks . One of the speakers will be Bill Gates , who is widely credited with pushing museums into the Digital Age . His early attempts , starting in 1989 , to buy reproduction rights for an encyclopedic visual data base -- of which fine_art is but one component -- met considerable resistance . Although Gates easily engineered a hometown deal , persuading the Seattle Art Museum to sell rights to 1 # 000 images , personnel at many other museums claim that his representatives were so aggressive , persistent and ignorant about art that they alienated potential clients . &quot; The word went_out , if they call , don ' t answer the phone , &quot; says a staff_member at a major East Coast institution . Other vendors have approached museums as well , but many of the institutions have responded by reconsidering their licensing policies and trying to figure_out how to turn the technology to their advantage . &quot; We are in the very , very , very early phase of discussing policies and what we want to do_in this area , first inside the museum and later outside , &quot; says Mickey Carpenter , director of photographic permissions and services at the Museum of Modern Art in New York . Caution is wise , according to attorney Christine Steiner , of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , who frequently speaks and writes_about protection of intellectual property . &quot; Museums have lots of experience with publishers and rights , &quot; Steiner says . &quot; What ' s different about this ( onslaught of requests ) is volume , variety and velocity. &quot; Electronic publishers pursue museums because they have vast quantities of a desirable product , museums ' names have a market_value , and vendors assume that the fewer sources they deal with , the easier the rights issue will be to resolve , she says . But museums hold works_of_art in trust . They have a responsibility to protect the art and they need to know how the material they license will be used , Steiner says . She warns against selling exclusive_rights and signing contracts that contain confidentiality clauses , while advising museums to keep a tight rein on quality_control . Since no standard contract exists , electronic publishers negotiate every museum deal individually , working with curators to select images and using an electronic camera to scan photographs provided by the museums . The museums generally receive a cash_advance against royalties and a promise of future royalties if the product produces sufficient income . * The push toward marketing digital reproductions of artworks is but a tiny indicator of the electronic publishing industry ' s quest_for multimedia content of all descriptions . What Continuum wants from museums is &quot; premier visual information , &quot; according to attorney Steve Davis , acting head of the firm . His characterization of fine_art may make purists squirm , but he says the cultural community itself has defined this top echelon of &quot; information. &quot; The images licensed by Continuum will be used for two products , Davis says . One is &quot; an on-line relicensing service . . . a one-stop shopping opportunity for publishers , producers and creators. &quot; The second is &quot; a very sophisticated data base &quot; of artworks and descriptive text that could be linked to other kinds of information -- say , photographs of related cities and landscapes , historical text or appropriate music -- delivered on up_to 50 electronic pathways . &quot; The possibilities are pretty mind-boggling , &quot; he says . With five museums under contract , Continuum has made significant inroads . A press_release announcing the Philadelphia Museum of Art ' s collaboration with the firm solemnly announces &quot; a long-term working relationship &quot; and quotes the museum ' s director , Anne d ' Harnoncourt , as saying she hopes the digital database will help the institution &quot; find new audiences to appreciate and learn from our vast collections. &quot; Continuum ' s conception of fine_art as a consumer product and its plans for an archive that mixes artworks with many other kinds of material still raise eyebrows in art circles , but the company has made some smart moves . One was to woo art_historian Hal Opperman , a specialist in 17th- and 18th-Century French art , from the University of Washington . Having left his ivory_tower to &quot; participate in a fabulous opportunity to be an educator on a grand scale , &quot; as he puts it , Opperman characterizes digital technology as the biggest revolution ever in the reproduction and dissemination of art . But perhaps Continuum ' s most inspired gesture was to hire as consultant J . Carter Brown , the former director of Washington ' s National Gallery and the very personification of the cultural elite . Beating the drum for the digital revolution is a great part-time gig for Brown , who is something of a visionary and appears to enjoy the spotlight . The upcoming AAMD conference proves that digital technology is &quot; topic A &quot; in museum circles , Brown says . And he cheerfully dispels techno-qualms , which he likens to &quot; that old thing we all had when we were children : fear of the dark. &quot; Reeling_off behind-the-scenes advantages for museums , he notes that digital reproductions are far more accurate , permanent , accessible and compact than photographs . The technology also can be immensely helpful to conservators , who can clean a tiny section of an artwork and predict the results of a complete restoration on their computer_screens . Digital reproductions also are likely to expand museums ' audiences , Brown says . Just as films based on books have created a huge market for authors E . M . Forster and Edith Wharton , CD-ROMs on art will whet appetites for original artworks , he says . &quot; What keeps people out of museums is a lack of familiarity with the subject . The more access people have to art , the more they will want. &quot; As for questions about copyrights and piracy , Brown says , &quot; I think the market will work that out. &quot; Offering an analogy of fear about pirated videotapes , he says the low cost of renting videotapes offers little incentive to would-be pirates and notes the enormous volume of business done_by video rental stores . Opportunities for pirating reproductions are already available , according to Brown and other advocates of electronic publishing . Anyone can snap a photograph and have it digitalized on a Kodak Photo CD or go_to a copy shop and have a plate from an art book scanned . But spokesmen for software companies say that protection of intellectual property is fundamental to the industry and that they are pumping considerable effort into developing protective devices for licensed imagery . Meanwhile , technology marches on . And if there is any consensus on the digitization of fine_art , it is that technology will drive the market . &quot; It ' s a very exciting environment to work in right now , &quot; Steiner says . &quot; No one seems to have an absolutist view . But I am convinced that museums can control their own digital future. &quot;</TEXT>
