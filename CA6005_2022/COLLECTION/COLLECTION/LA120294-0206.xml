   <HEADLINE> 42 NATIONS SIGN SYMBOLIC AIDS PACT ; HEALTH : DELEGATES VOW PARIS DECLARATION WILL LAUNCH SOLID , INTERNATIONAL ACTION AGAINST DISEASE . ACTIVISTS EXPRESS SKEPTICISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the Eiffel Tower wearing a ribbon of bright red_lights , political_leaders from 42 countries signed a global declaration here Thursday , promising to protect the rights of people with AIDS and to work more closely with organizations representing them . The declaration , like the ribbon on the Eiffel Tower , was largely symbolic . But delegates vowed that it will launch a solid , international political effort to drum_up more money for research , improve the safety of the blood supply and bring the world ' s largest nations together in the battle against AIDS . &quot; We have to face the painful truth that this is only the beginning , &quot; said Donna Shalala , U.S. secretary of health and human services , in an address to the opening session of the Paris AIDS Summit . &quot; Any breakdown in human solidarity is a victory for the virus. &quot; Leaders of AIDS support groups cautiously welcomed the Paris Declaration , saying they were pleased that the issue was being discussed on a world stage by powerful political_leaders , but they were also worried that most countries will not take the document seriously . Many agreed with the AIDS activists who marked World AIDS Day on Thursday with a protest on the Champs Elysee , laying prone beneath the Arc de Triomphe on the famed avenue and chanting : &quot; Not words but action ! &quot; &quot; This declaration doesn ' t do much for the needs of people with the disease , &quot; said Arnaud Lavauzelle , president of AIDES Federation , the main association representing AIDS sufferers in France . &quot; It ' s a compromise , a political decision that doesn ' t really help in our fight. &quot; Martina Clark , an American delegate for World GNP + , the Global Network of People Living with HIV / AIDS , said the declaration &quot; is just a photo opportunity yet again. &quot; &quot; There is nothing from this summit that will insist on changes in , for example , the U.S. immigration laws , &quot; said Clark , from San Francisco . &quot; There are still ways to skirt around the issue , and that is not acceptable. &quot; U.S. immigration policy , which requires special visas for people who are infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , came under sharp criticism from delegates attending the conference . Russia and Japan , whose delegates signed the declaration , also place restrictions on foreigners with acquired immune deficiency syndrome who want to enter those countries . Christophe Martet , a member of the_French branch of ACT_UP who is HIV-positive , said he did not believe that the Paris Declaration will make AIDS sufferers any more welcome in those countries . &quot; Each time I go_to the States , I will still have to cross my fingers , &quot; he said . The declaration specifically binds the countries to , as a matter of national policy , &quot; ensure equal protection under the law for persons living with HIV / AIDS &quot; in access to health_care , employment , education , travel , housing and social_welfare . Although the declaration seems to contradict current U.S. policy , Shalala , President Clinton ' s representative at the summit , said no international declaration could override American laws set by Congress . &quot; No one can change a policy sitting here in Paris , &quot; she said in an interview . &quot; But it means we ' ll keep our focus_on the issue . This is really about solidarity in the fight against AIDS. &quot; Those who complain that the declaration does not go_far enough &quot; are right , &quot; Shalala added . &quot; As far as I ' m concerned , until we rid the world of this disease , we won ' t have gone_far enough . But this is a strong step , a building block. &quot; Yann le Cam , vice_president of a French AIDS support group , agreed that the summit , and the high-level government delegates who are attending , had opened a door that had previously been closed . The delegates to the conference , which ends Saturday , represented countries from five continents and included 13 prime_ministers . U.S. officials said they hoped that the declaration and the Paris AIDS Summit will persuade other developed countries to spend more on AIDS research . The U.S._government now provides about 40 % of the world ' s spending on AIDS research . And 92 % of world funds to fight AIDS benefit only the developing world , where 8 % of AIDS patients live . International AIDS activists said , though , that American policy was paradoxical on the issue . &quot; On the one hand , they give money , and at_the_same_time they maintain irrational restrictions on foreigners with AIDS who want to travel_to the United States , &quot; said Lavauzelle , of the_French AIDS group , who was refused entry into the United States two years ago . The World_Health_Organization says that 17 million people worldwide have been infected with the human_immunodeficiency_virus , and that figure will rise to between 30 million and 40 million within six years . In an emotional address to the summit , Yolanda Simon , a member of GNP + from the Caribbean who is HIV-positive , challenged the delegates to follow_through on their promises , especially the declaration ' s vow to &quot; fully involve &quot; organizations of people with AIDS in public policy decisions . &quot; Your policies for the last 10 years have driven most people living with HIV and AIDS underground , &quot; she said . &quot; Many of them are dying in isolation . We are tired_of the lip_service that you have been paying to us . Now what are you going_to do when the ink on your signatures has dried ? &quot; Paris Bureau researcher Sarah White contributed to this report . * RELATED PICTURES : B1</TEXT>
