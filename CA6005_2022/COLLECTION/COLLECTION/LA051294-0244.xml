   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; UNLIKELY ALLIANCE COULD TAKE_SHAPE IN HUNGARY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A convincing comeback by the Hungarian Socialist_Party four years after it was ousted in Eastern Europe ' s first free elections has stirred thoughts of a once-unimaginable alliance between a liberal_party founded by dissidents and the former Communists who repressed them . Such a marriage of political convenience would seem to hold little prospect of enduring a full four-year governing term . But Hungarian voters are afflicted by nostalgia for a more stable past and by fatigue from the confrontations that have marred the first post-Communist government . Socialist candidates won a third of the popular vote_in this week ' s election , and they lead in enough individual parliamentary races heading into a May 29 runoff to be assured of having the upper_hand in forming a new coalition -- if not an outright majority that would let them govern alone . Both the Socialists and the voters ' second choice , the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats , claim to recognize the risks entailed in one-party government by a leadership that has only a slim majority and was empowered largely by a protest vote . &quot; People didn ' t vote for the old regime , they voted against the present government . This is the swing of the pendulum back to the left after moving too far to the right , &quot; said Laszlo Rajk , a leading member of the Free Democrats , a prominent dissident in the 1970s and the son of an anti-Communist activist executed during Hungary ' s darkest days of dictatorship . &quot; The Socialists are going_to need a counterbalance , as well as a stamp of approval , &quot; he said . &quot; Hungarians tend to use their votes as a vendetta , and the Socialists don ' t want to be the only ones around to be blamed next time. &quot; Rajk argues that the proposed alliance , though difficult to fathom on an emotional level , would give the Free Democrats influence in defining government policy as well as some control over what personalities and factions within the Socialist_Party emerge to take important ministerial posts . Socialist_Party leader Gyula Horn has already appealed for a coalition government , and other party leaders insist there is no reason to fear that they will set_back the pace of reform . &quot; In no way do the Socialists want to turn the clock back , &quot; insisted Imre Szekeres , a Socialist_Party vice_president likely to be nominated to a key government post . Former political_prisoners , like poet and dramatist Istvan Eorsi , concede that today ' s Socialists are a different breed from the party that jailed him after the 1956 anti-Communist revolt and censored his work_through most of his lifetime . &quot; For me , this Socialist_Party doesn ' t represent the old cadres who I grew to hate , the ones who sent me to prison and hanged my friends , &quot; said the bearded writer who is an influential member of the Free Democrats but describes himself as a &quot; misunderstood Socialist. &quot; That anti-Communist crusaders such_as Rajk and Eorsi see the Socialist resurgence as a natural and not-so-disturbing consequence of this unsettled age is likely to comfort both the confused masses and wary foreign investors who have plunked $ 7 billion into new business ventures here over the past four years . Hungary led the post-Communist pack in attracting foreign investment . But that advantage has gradually evaporated as more enticing tax_breaks have been offered to investors elsewhere in Eastern Europe and as Hungary ' s privatization ground to a halt amid government bureaucracy and corruption . New jobs failed to materialize while the make-work networks of the Communist era were disbanded , leaving 13 % of the labor_force jobless and many others awaiting layoffs at bankrupt heavy-industry complexes that have yet to be closed . Coupled with inflation that has ranged from 40 % a year to the present 22 % , the social_welfare disaster turned the population against the present government . The economic_policies of the Free Democrats and the Socialists differ little in print . But the popular groundswell for an easing of the shift to a democratic free-market system is expected to pressure the Socialists to divert more resources to social programs that could hamper their ability to stimulate economic_growth . Whether the Free Democrats agree to form a coalition with the Socialists depends heavily on the results of the second voting round , as the liberal_party risks losing those members who avidly oppose the alliance on principle . &quot; Our task now is to prevent the Socialists from getting a landslide victory , &quot; said Gabor Kuncze , the Free Democrats ' candidate for the post of prime_minister . The Free Democrats plan to campaign heartily in the three weeks before the runoff in hopes of collecting enough additional seats to enter coalition talks with the Socialists on a more even footing . &quot; Otherwise we will be giving them legitimacy and risking defections from our own membership while getting nothing substantial in return , &quot; said Eorsi . &quot; We also have to be very careful not to appear too anti-Socialist , since this is clearly the people ' s choice . we ' ll have to restrain ourselves and not speak too_much about the past. &quot;</TEXT>
