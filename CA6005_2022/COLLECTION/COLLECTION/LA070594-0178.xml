   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS ; CELLULAR-PHONE USERS TO AID CRIME FIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Drivers with cellular_phones can sign_up now to join Thousand Oaks ' new Mobile Crime Watch program , administered by the Conejo Valley Chamber_of_Commerce . Armed with $ 3 # 000 in city funds , the chamber will train at least 75 people to serve as extra eyes and ears for the Police_Department , reporting suspicious activity as they drive_around Thousand Oaks . After an hourlong training session , Mobile Crime Watch members will receive two free magnetic signs to slap_on their car_doors . Crime busters hope the boldly colored signs -- either white , red and black ; or purple , yellow and red -- will announce their presence and deter criminals . &quot; The visibility is the most effective part of this program , &quot; said Gary Koppenjan , communications manager for the chamber . The first training session is scheduled be held within a month , as soon as the chamber gathers 25 volunteers . For more information , call 499-1993 . STEPHANIE SIMON</TEXT>
