   <HEADLINE> INTEL SUFFERS NEW SETBACK IN LATEST COURT DECISION ON ARBITRATION CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Intel Corp. , the giant computer chip maker still reeling from the nasty debacle over the flaw in its Pentium microprocessor , suffered another setback Friday when the California Supreme Court reinstated an arbitration award granting rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. rights to some Intel technology . The 4-3 decision is expected to have relatively little effect on the booming microprocessor market , but it could have broader significance for the legal_community . Some proponents of arbitration had feared that had the high_court sided with the appeals court that threw_out the award , it would have had a chilling effect on the growing use of arbitration by individuals and businesses to resolve disputes . &quot; If you sign a contract and agree to participate in arbitration , and you proceeded with arbitration , I would hope that the justice system would provide a stamp of approval for the process , &quot; said Lauren Burton , executive_director of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. ' s dispute resolution services . Barring an appeal_to the U.S. Supreme Court , Friday ' s ruling settles a case that began in 1987 , when AMD accused Intel of violating a 1982 technology exchange agreement and forced an arbitration proceeding . The original agreement called_for any disputes to be settled by arbitration . After 4 1 / 2 years of hearings , retired Superior_Court Judge J . Barton Phelps , the court-appointed arbitrator , found that Santa Clara-based Intel had breached the contract_in refusing to grant AMD the rights to manufacture the 386 microprocessor . ( Chip companies once routinely shared their designs to assure customers a back-up source of production. ) But he also found_fault on AMD ' s side , so rather than require Intel to turn_over to AMD the specifications for the 386 , as AMD had sought , Phelps granted AMD rights to any Intel technology that might be found in the 386 &quot; clone &quot; that AMD had already begun producing in the face of an Intel legal assault . Intel claimed Phelps had exceeded his authority and took the issue back to court . In 1993 , a state court of appeals panel agreed with Intel , but the Supreme Court action on Friday overruled the appeals court . Microprocessors compose the &quot; brains &quot; of personal_computers , and the 386 was at the time the industry-leading chip and represented a very lucrative market . It has since been largely superseded by the 486 and the Pentium , and thus Friday ' s decision will have little direct effect . But the ruling bolsters Sunnyvale-based AMD ' s record in a tangle of complex disputes with Intel . A string of rulings in the past year or so have also gone mostly in favor of AMD and other Intel rivals . &quot; It really looks_like Intel has lost its legal battles to constrain competitors , &quot; said Linley Gwennap , editor of Microprocessor Report , a trade newsletter in Sebastopol . &quot; Now Intel will have to go head-to-head in the marketplace rather than in the courtroom. &quot; The state Supreme Court decision centered_on the extent of the arbitrator ' s power . In the ruling , written by Justice Kathryn M . Werdegar , the court held that &quot; the remedy an arbitrator fashions does not exceed his or her powers if it bears a rational relationship to the underlying contract . . . . &quot; Peter Detkin , director of litigation at Intel , said the ruling could make people reluctant to go_to arbitration &quot; because it gives arbitrators too_much power. &quot; However , Robert Daggett , a San Francisco lawyer , said the decision is a boon to champions of arbitration . &quot; The Supreme Court has in this decision pretty clearly approved a scope of the arbitrator ' s power which some people thought might be over the line , &quot; he said . &quot; That strengthens arbitration when the parties agree to it by contract. &quot;</TEXT>
