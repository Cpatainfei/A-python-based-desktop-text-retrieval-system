   <HEADLINE> PUC ' S ELECTRIC_POWER DEREGULATION PLAN IS DEBATED ; UTILITIES : FIRST LEGISLATIVE HEARING DRAWS ADVOCATES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE -- AND A MOSTLY NEGATIVE REACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The early battle_lines were drawn Monday over the state Public_Utilities Commission ' s proposal to lower California ' s electricity rates through broad-scale deregulation . The first formal -- and mostly negative -- reactions to the PUC plan came from a long line of California ' s three big investor-owned electric utilities and their customers , environmentalists , consumer advocates and independent power producers at a packed joint hearing conducted at the Capitol by Gwen Moore ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairwoman of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee , and Byron D . Sher ( D-Palo Alto ) , chairman of the Assembly Natural_Resources Committee . Indeed , Moore said , the hearing arose out of concern that the commission is &quot; trying to railroad through &quot; its proposal without adequate fact-finding and public_debate . Sher said he is concerned both by the PUC ' s &quot; breathless &quot; pace for public_debate of the plan and by the fact that the plan &quot; appears to be inconsistent &quot; with long-held state policies to protect the environment and require a diverse mix of electricity-producing fuels . PUC President Daniel W . Fessler repeatedly stressed that the commission proposal was released to stimulate such debate , and he announced a beefed-up series of PUC public hearings over the summer . &quot; I am not interested in pursuing this matter in haste , &quot; he told the legislators , noting that the options for restructuring the electric utilities have been under debate for more_than 18 months . Fessler said the first public hearing is scheduled for June 14 in Los Angeles , and a second will be held_in San Francisco or Sacramento on July 1 . Two more at undecided locations are tentatively set for July 21 and Aug . 4 . &quot; And a fifth and a sixth if needed after that , &quot; Fessler said , insisting that he plans to cast &quot; the widest possible net &quot; to elicit public views of the proposal . On April 20 , the PUC announced its plan for a broad restructuring of California ' s electric utilities , designed to bring_down the state ' s relatively high electric_power rates by creating a competitive marketplace for all power customers by 2002 -- from big industrial users to individual residents . Though some states and other nations have their own plans for deregulation , California ' s is by most measures the farthest-reaching . Any plan would also have to be reconciled with current state law . &quot; This is an important new direction , &quot; Sher said before the start of the hearing , &quot; and if it goes_forward it will clearly need legislative involvement. &quot; A major concern about the PUC plan is the prospect of an invasion of utilities from other states into a newly opened California market . These utilities could be expected to strongly compete with California power_companies , in large part because they would not have to meet California ' s demanding air_pollution or energy diversity standards at generating facilities in their home states , critics say . On Friday , a 30-member group representing about 70 % of the high-voltage-transmission entities in 11 western states announced the formation of the Western Regional Transmission Assn. , conceived to solve the sort of logistical problems that retail competition would create . The group is led by Portland , Ore.-based PacifiCorp. , a large utility that has long wanted to enter the California market . But any PUC plan would require &quot; reciprocal rights &quot; for California utilities to compete in other service territories , Fessler said Monday . He noted that he has met with utility representatives throughout the western states and Canada in the past month and expects to discuss such reciprocity issues with Mexican officials soon . Consumer advocates objected that only consumers -- and not utility shareholders -- are called_on to pay_for expensive nuclear_power plants and other investments that would become uneconomical in a competitive retail power market . Environmentalists condemned what they described as the plan ' s promotion of low energy prices -- &quot; the cheapest electron &quot; -- without regard_to reliance on foreign oil , reliability of the electric_power or environmental protections . Fessler , promising to answer a barrage of other questions in_writing , said he expects that by October the commission will have acquired enough information and comment to agree on &quot; the broad outline of where to go from here. &quot;</TEXT>
