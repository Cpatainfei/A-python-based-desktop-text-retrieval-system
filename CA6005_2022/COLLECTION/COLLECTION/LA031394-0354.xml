   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; ORANGE COUNTY TRIBE BATTLES FOR ITS IDENTITY ; THE JUANENO INDIANS WERE STRIPPED OF A LARGE PART OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA . THEY SEEK U.S. RECOGNITION TO VALIDATE THEIR PAST AND ENRICH THEIR FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Before the Spaniards , the Mexicans , the Catholic_Church and U.S. settlers took_away their land and left them homeless , the Juaneno Band of Mission Indians could lay claim to much of Southern California . The ground beneath Disneyland , Camp Pendleton and Mission San Juan Capistrano belonged_to them . Many Juanenos are buried under what now are strip malls and parking_lots , forgotten long ago in the rush from wilderness to pavement . But their 4 # 500 descendants , about half of whom live near the adobe mission here , have not forgotten . They are trying to persuade the federal_government that they exist as a tribe with roots dating_back 10 # 000 years . That struggle for recognition is a product of the Juanenos ' embattled history and the increasingly strident competition that may determine their future . They are among hundreds of Indian groups hoping to win the potentially lucrative blessing of the U.S._government . Federal recognition could bring a tribe a reservation , with schools , housing and health_care provided by taxpayers . It could even mean a casino brimming with profits . The Juanenos ' campaign is also complicated by a spate of tribal pretenders inspired by what critics call &quot; Dances With Wolves &quot; romanticism . &quot; We want a place to carry_on the traditions of our culture , &quot; Juaneno leader David Belardes said . &quot; For our children , our children ' s children and their children . We are the indigenous people of this area. &quot; The Juanenos formally applied for tribal status in 1982 but made their first government claim more_than a century before that . In recent months , they have emerged from among hundreds of bands , rising to No . 1 on a long list trying to gain active consideration by the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Their bid has been bolstered by recognition from the state , which cited an archeological history dating_back a_hundred centuries . The Juanenos ' lack of federal recognition is &quot; an oversight of history , &quot; said Paul Apodaca , curator of Native_American art at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana and an authority on Indian culture . &quot; Absolutely , they ' re a tribe . They had their own language , their own group identity . They practiced religion in a way that was distinct to them . They were a legitimate social entity . &quot; You have to remember , tribal recognition is not the government granting them something . Rather , it is recognizing them as a legitimate legal entity that the government has unfinished_business with . And the government has unfinished_business with the Juanenos . It needs to grant them recognition. &quot; In some ways , the plight of the Acjachemen people -- as the Juanenos were originally called -- is similar to that of many California tribes . After thousands of years comfortably living_off the land and developing a rich , peace-loving culture , they were enslaved by Spanish missionaries in the 18th Century . The Mexican government recognized them as citizens with limited rights . The United States seized the territory in 1848 . Its settlers offered a $ 25 a head bounty on California Indians , a practice that did not end until the turn_of_the_century . The bounty forced many Juanenos to retreat to the_hills and others to marry Latinos in attempts to assimilate . Despite such obstacles , the Juanenos maintained an &quot; identity continuously throughout history , so we are , in fact , a tribe , &quot; said Belardes , 47 , whose father , grandfather and great-grandfather pioneered the tribe ' s cause and who have a street named after them in San Juan Capistrano . &quot; And we ' ve governed ourselves from mission times to the present . In my mind , that means federal recognition. &quot; Today , Juanenos can be found as far as Texas and Florida , but most live_in Orange County . Many are Catholics who have intermarried and &quot; continue to pay taxes on the land our forefathers owned before the government took it away , &quot; said Belardes , a groundskeeper for the Capistrano Unified School District . As often as he can , he and fellow Juanenos gather for ceremonial_dances and prayers , basket weaving and tribal conferences , where they speak their own language , Acjachemen , and pass_on the sorrows and triumphs of their culture . In the history they often retell , the Acjachemen people welcomed the Spanish missionaries , only to be converted to the conquerors ' religion and commandeered to help build Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1776 . The Spaniards renamed the tribe for the mission . They used &quot; Juanenos &quot; to refer to the scattered but closely related bands of raven-haired , brown-eyed , olive-skinned Indians living_in the canyons and along the shores of the Pacific . Although it is hard to estimate population data , scholars say several hundred to several thousand Juanenos roamed the beaches and arid hills of much of the Southland . Their territory extended from the southern tier of what is now Los Angeles County to Camp Pendleton in north San Diego County and east to Riverside County , according to the state resolution recognizing the tribe . Some historians and members of the Gabrielino Indian band dispute those boundaries , saying the Gabrielinos -- who lived primarily in the Los Angeles Basin -- shared at least part of the territory . Forced to work as slaves , the Juanenos were shackled with collars and leashes and kept_in line by the garrisons that accompanied the mission fathers . The Spaniards used them for construction work , farming and domestic labor , forbidding them to pray to their god , Chinigchinich , or speak Acjachemen . The Spanish originally intended to return the mission lands to the Indians after they had civilized the tribe . But the Juanenos received only a_few plots after the new Mexican government secularized the mission and freed them from the padres ' authority in 1833 . Much of the land was divided among white settlers , who established a town in San Juan Capistrano in 1841 . California became a U.S. territory after the Mexican-American War in 1848 , and a state in 1850 . When the United States seized the territory , &quot; it sent Army generals around to negotiate treaties , &quot; Apodaca said . &quot; And they just didn ' t meet with everybody . It ' s that simple . There was no real pressure to because they already owned the state. &quot; The Juanenos first petitioned U.S. authorities for recognition in the mid-19th Century , when the bounty program was still in_force . The bounty , or scalping as it was commonly known , ended only because law_enforcement became more civilized and society more friendly to California Indians , who did not become U.S citizens until 1926 . By the turn_of_the_century , the Juanenos had lost all claim to their vast acreage . Not one of 18 treaties signed with early settlers was ratified by Congress , which foresaw the state ' s potential wealth . The very existence of the treaties was concealed for half a century . Had they been ratified , Indians would have owned about a quarter of the state , scholars say . After statehood , many Indians were crammed onto what was left of the Spanish ranchos , then left homeless when the lands were sold . Some believe that the Juanenos ' peaceful nature cost them the chance for federal recognition earlier . &quot; The Juanenos were made to suffer largely for being peace-loving , &quot; said Jane Uyeno , president of the Native_American Indian Cultural Center in Tustin . &quot; Like a lot of tribes who chose not to fight , they got stomped -- in every way possible. &quot; By contrast , the Pechanga tribe , which fought the last Indian war in California , ended_up with more_than 6 # 000 acres in Riverside County . In 1952 , each Juaneno was awarded $ 150 as part of $ 25 million set_aside by the federal_government to buy_out California ' s Indians . They had filed suit more_than a decade earlier over land rights . Angered by the payoff and the tawdry history it represented , Juaneno leader Clarence Lobo filed a second suit on behalf of the state ' s Indians . When the government offered to settle that suit 20 years later for $ 29.1 million , Lobo objected , saying it amounted to 47 cents an acre for the Indians ' confiscated land . What angered him more , Lobo said , was that fellow Indians outvoted him 4 to 1 to accept the settlement . In 1972 , they received individual checks of $ 668.52 , after legal_fees . Lobo refused his check and moved to Northern California , where he died of a brain_tumor . An elementary_school in San Clemente was recently named in his honor . * A tribe recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs can establish its own sovereign government , with a court system and police_force . It has access to lucrative grants for higher education and the power to tax any tenant who uses the land . It can also gain the multimillion-dollar profits that some reservations reap from casinos . &quot; The federal pie for Indians is so small that if you include more tribes , slices of the pie get_even smaller , &quot; said a top congressional aide who works only on behalf of Indians and who requested anonymity . &quot; What often results is an ugly fight bordering_on civil war. &quot; More_than 300 tribes in the continental United States and 226 native villages in Alaska are recognized by the federal_government . About a third of those in the continental United States are in California , and nearly a third of those are in Southern California . All have satisfied the strict ethnological , historical , legal and political requirements outlined in federal guidelines , the bureau says . Federal recognition depends_on factors including a tribe ' s &quot; repeated identification by ( U.S. ) authorities , a longstanding relationship with state_government , repeated dealings with a county , parish or local_government based on the group ' s individual identity , &quot; according to the agency ' s literature . A prospective tribe ' s chances are enhanced if it has been identified as an Indian entity by scholars , the media and in dealings with recognized tribes or national Indian organizations , the agency says . Since the Federal Acknowledgment Program was established in 1978 to handle modern claims , the Bureau of Indian Affairs has recognized nine tribes out of 147 petitions . Congress has recognized four on its own . Six tribes are under active consideration , with three -- including the Juanenos -- to be considered next , agency spokesman Carl Shaw said . Another 83 are in the application process , Shaw said . Gaining tribal status has been complicated by legalized gambling , which began on reservations in 1980 , and the surge in &quot; new age &quot; Native_American groups . Both have increased the number of contenders for tribal status and raise questions in some minds about some groups ' motives . Other tribes assailed the Golden Hill Paugussetts of Bridgeport , Conn. , for instance , saying the group seeks recognition solely to establish a casino that would try to divert New York City gamblers from Atlantic_City , N.J. Indeed , the profit potential is enticing . The Mashantucket Pequot ' s Foxwoods casino in Connecticut reports a net operating profit of more_than $ 20 million a month and a 45 % to 50 % profit_margin compared to that of 10 % to 15 % in Atlantic_City . Indian gaming enterprises began with a bingo hall in Florida and have expanded to 68 casinos and 170 high-stakes bingo games in 24 states , with more planned . About half the nation ' s recognized tribes are trying to open gaming halls . San Diego County is home to three such casinos . Riverside and San Bernardino counties have one each . In Palm Springs , the Agua Caliente band of Cahuilla Indians plans to build a gaming casino downtown to be managed by Caesars World . The partnership , announced in November , 1992 , calls_for a $ 25-million gambling hall to open in 1995 . Belardes said he was approached about opening a casino in Orange County if the Juanenos are recognized . Suggested reservation sites include military bases that are facing closure or land in the Cleveland National Forest . &quot; Our goal is to be recognized , &quot; he said . &quot; Beyond that , we cross each bridge as we come_to it. &quot; Tribes fear the potential of what Indian lobbyist George Waters calls &quot; new age charlatans from California &quot; to win recognition from Congress , which can grant tribal status without imposing the Bureau of Indian Affair ' s criteria . &quot; We call them the post- ' Dances With Wolves ' Indians , &quot; he said , referring to the 1990 Kevin Costner movie . &quot; They run_around in sweat lodges , thinking Indian religion is so cool . Most aren ' t even Indians . But they hinder the efforts of all_of those who might be legitimate . The effort to become recognized is , I ' m afraid , a vicious struggle with too many competitors and a government running_out of money. &quot; But most of all , Indian groups fear that the inclusion of &quot; charlatan &quot; tribes could diminish their own role as self-contained , sovereign powers -- for which they have fought for centuries . Many Juanenos hope that recognition comes during the Clinton_Administration . Such optimism is sobered by the fact that few tribes were recognized during the Ronald Reagan and George_Bush years . Juaneno leader Belardes hopes tribal recognition will come , in part , to bestow lasting honor on Lobo . If their fight fails ? &quot; It will be a continuation of how our people have been wronged throughout history , &quot; Belardes said . &quot; We ' ve survived and made_it on our own , without the government ' s help . So we would continue to exist , to maintain our culture and carry_on , to teach our traditions to our children , who would pass it on to theirs . &quot; In God ' s eyes -- if not the nation ' s -- we know we belong. &quot; Who Are the Juanenos ? * Name : The name Juaneno was given to native Californians by the Spaniards , who converted them to Christianity in the 18th Century . * Numbers : 3 # 000 still live_in California ; many live elsewhere . * History : Tribe dates_back 10 # 000 years and once populated the arid hills , canyons and beaches of Southern California . * Customs : Family groups lived_in villages . * Language : Acagchemem .
