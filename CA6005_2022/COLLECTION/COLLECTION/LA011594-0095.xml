   <HEADLINE> 3RD MAN JAILED IN ATTACK ON SKATER KERRIGAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The man suspected of carrying_out the attack on Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan surrendered Friday to authorities in Arizona . Shane Minoaka Stant , 22 , of Chandler , Ariz. , was charged with conspiracy to commit assault in the second degree and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution . Authorities allege the attack on Kerrigan was arranged by the bodyguard of figure_skating champion Tonya Harding , one of Kerrigan ' s rivals . Stant surrendered in Phoenix and was being held_in the Maricopa County Jail . He is the third_person arrested so far in the attack , joining Shawn Eric Eckardt , 26 , and Derrick Brian Smith , 29 , who were arraigned Friday in Portland , Ore. , and entered pleas of not_guilty . The pair were arrested in Portland Thursday night and charged with conspiracy to commit assault . Eckardt is Harding ' s bodyguard . Bail for Eckardt and Smith was set at $ 20 # 000 each . Eckardt posted bail Friday night and was released . Stant did not enter a plea in an appearance before a U.S. magistrate in Phoenix on Friday . He was appointed a public_defender and ordered detained until a Wednesday hearing on extradition to Portland . Meanwhile on Friday , Harding and her ex-husband , Jeff Gillooly , who have reconciled since their Aug . 28 divorce , were seen leaving their home outside Portland together , but they did not respond to questions from reporters . Harding later met with two attorneys , Robert Weaver and Chris Kovack . According to an affidavit filed by the FBI , Stant conspired with others during a meeting in Portland in late December to injure Kerrigan in an attempt to prevent her from competing in last week ' s U.S. Figure_Skating Championships , which served as the Olympic trials , then flew to Detroit to commit the assault . Kerrigan was struck on the right knee by a baton-wielding assailant shortly after a practice_session on Jan . 6 , the day before the championships , which Harding won . An FBI spokesman called Stant &quot; a paramilitary sort of guy who is familiar_with weapons. &quot; The 24-year-old Kerrigan , who was waived onto the Olympic team by the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . even though she was forced to withdraw from the national championships , said Friday that she plans to return to practice at her Cape_Cod , Mass. , training rink within a_few days and expects to be fit for the Olympics . The women ' s competition begins in Lillehammer , Norway , on Feb . 23 . &quot; I ' m assuming I can do the program of my life , &quot; said Kerrigan , a bronze medalist in the 1992 Games . &quot; It ' s up_to the judges , not me . I ' m really just focusing_on my skating. &quot; Despite the swelling in her right knee , even Kerrigan seemed to be having difficulty grasping the reality of the situation after learning that the three men arrested since Thursday have a connection to Harding , her U.S. Olympic teammate . &quot; I can ' t understand any explanation of why something like this would occur , &quot; Kerrigan said at a news_conference Friday outside her Stoneham , Mass. , home . &quot; I don ' t think I could ever understand the answer because I can ' t think that viciously. &quot; Asked how she will react to competing in the Winter_Olympics with Harding , Kerrigan said : &quot; I have nothing to say to her. &quot; Harding , however , has not been charged in the attack , and , although NBC News_reported Friday night that she is under &quot; active criminal investigation , &quot; authorities denied that she is a suspect at this point . &quot; We are investigating everything , &quot; said John Bradley , deputy district_attorney for Multnomah County , Ore . &quot; So , I mean , we are going_to be as complete as we can . Whatever you make of that. &quot; The Detroit Free Press also quoted unnamed law_enforcement officials as saying Harding was under investigation . Weaver , Harding ' s attorney , said Friday night that Harding was cooperating with the district_attorney ' s office . &quot; I do know that there are no charges outstanding , &quot; Weaver said . &quot; That was confirmed to me an hour ago in a meeting I had in the district_attorney ' s office . This continuous reporting by some people that there are charges outstanding needs to stop . &quot; She is quite exhausted by all_of this . While she will be making a statement , she ' s not prepared to do that today. &quot; Multnomah County Dist . Atty . Michael Schrunk would not disclose the roles believed to have been played by the three men in custody , but Fox News identified Smith as the driver of his nephew Stant ' s getaway car . Schrunk also would not say whether other arrest_warrants would be filed . According to NBC News , Eckardt has accused Harding of being involved in the &quot; planning and cover-up &quot; of the attack on Kerrigan . The Detroit Free Press reported that Eckardt , in an attempt to gather evidence that also would implicate Gillooly , planned to tape-record a meeting between the two earlier this week , but Gillooly did not show . A Portland private_investigator , Gary Crowe , said that he heard a recording of Gillooly and Eckardt planning the attack in an earlier conversation , but that tape has not been located . Also , an unidentified woman told Detroit police that she heard a recording a_few months ago of a conversation involving four people who were discussing a possible assault on Kerrigan . The names of the four men were reported to the FBI . Unless Harding , 23 , is implicated in the attack , she will not be asked to relinquish her berth in the Olympics , U.S. Olympic Committee and U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . officials said . She earned the berth by winning the national championship last Saturday night . Times special correspondent Laura Laughlin in Phoenix contributed to this story .</TEXT>
