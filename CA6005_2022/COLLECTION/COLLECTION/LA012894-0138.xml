   <HEADLINE> EGYPT FUNDAMENTALISTS ' SUIT TO FORCE A DIVORCE DENIED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A court ruled Thursday that an Egyptian professor does not have to divorce his wife even though Muslim fundamentalists think he should . Seven Muslim fundamentalist lawyers filed suit to try to force the divorce , claiming Nasr Hamid abu Zaid ' s writings as a professor of Arabic literature make him a heretic who could not remain married to a Muslim woman . Abu Zaid and his wife , a professor of French , opposed the suit . They said they are in_love and want to remain married . On Thursday , Mohammed Ahmed Awadallah , a civil affairs court judge , turned_down the suit on grounds that the plaintiffs had no direct interest in the case . His legal opinion explaining the verdict is to be released in a_few days . Egyptian intellectuals , already deeply concerned about fundamentalists ' threats , had watched the case closely . Secularists compared it to the 1992 killing of Egyptian writer Farag Foda , an outspoken critic of fundamentalist pressure for an Islamic state .</TEXT>
