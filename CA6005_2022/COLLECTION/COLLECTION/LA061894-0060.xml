   <HEADLINE> PLANNED FARE HIKE POINTS_UP INEQUITIES IN BUS , RAIL SUBSIDIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On one side of the equation are the 1.1 million bus riders each day , most of whom are poor and rely heavily , if not completely , on public transportation . Every time each of them boards a bus in Los Angeles , taxpayers kick_in $ 1.16. On the other side are the far fewer passengers on the region ' s slowly blooming rail system -- one for every 15 bus riders -- who tend to be more affluent and less dependent_on mass transit . Each of their trips commands a taxpayer subsidy three to 8 1 / 2 times that of a bus ride . Yet it is mainly bus_fares that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority seeks to raise in coming months to help bridge a $ 126-million operating deficit . It is a strategy that community activists such_as Chris Niles believe will penalize the most loyal but least well-off of the MTA ' s customers . &quot; It ' s absolutely wrong , &quot; said Niles , who works with the Labor / Community Strategy Center in the Mid-Wilshire district . &quot; They ' re putting the burden on the backs of bus riders ( to build ) very inefficient rail projects that no one ' s using . These are people who are just barely keeping their head above water who will be forced to find unique ways to finance their transit needs. &quot; MTA officials counter that bus_fares have remained untouched for six years . Even the proposed increase from $ 1.10 to $ 1.35 contained in the MTA ' s new budget would simply put Los Angeles in_line with what most other large cities -- New York , Philadelphia , Chicago -- charge . And rail projects must be launched now if the burgeoning region is to have a sensible transit network in the next millennium , officials say . &quot; We are about two things in this agency : providing good transportation services for today ' s riders and trying to develop a transportation capability that can serve tomorrow ' s riders , &quot; MTA chief_executive Franklin E . White said . &quot; A lot of people forget that second obligation. &quot; In many ways , the clashing views of White and Niles epitomize the divisive debate that has sprung_up over fare increases and service reductions proposed by the MTA last month . The battle has become fierce , leading one man to wage a hunger_strike and local politicians to speak out with unaccustomed vehemence . A public hearing on the fare increases is scheduled for 10 a.m. today at the county Hall of Administration . The MTA ' s board of directors could decide the issue next week . No one denies that the MTA is in alarming financial straits just one year after it was formed by merging the Southern California Rapid_Transit District and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission . The MTA faces an annual $ 300-million capital and operating shortfall starting next month and has had to lay off workers and delay some transit projects to balance its $ 2.9-billion budget . But no fare increases are expected for the Metrolink commuter_train , and a ride_on the Red_Line subway would remain 25 cents . Fares for Blue Line riders would be increased based upon the distance they travel , but the lion ' s share of new revenue -- about $ 50 million -- would come from bus riders ' pockets . Critics of the fare restructuring complain that it compounds disparities between the funding of rail and bus systems . Now , the MTA subsidizes operating_costs at a rate of $ 1.16 per passenger on its buses . Some of its most crowded routes , such_as Line 204 through South-Central Los Angeles , require subsidies of only 34 cents . By contrast , the subsidies stand at $ 3.15 for the Blue Line light rail system and $ 3.83 for the Red_Line . On Metrolink trains , the public ' s share is $ 9.86. To Antonio Villaraigosa , an alternate on the MTA board , the solution seems obvious . &quot; With limited dollars , we have to go_for the thing with the best bang for the buck , and the best bang for the buck is buses , &quot; he said . &quot; We need to build a first-class bus system , one that ' s clean , safe and graffiti-free. &quot; Villaraigosa and other opponents of the proposed fare increases also cite the stark differences between bus and train patrons . A recent MTA report described its bus riders as being mostly poor and non-white , whereas a Metrolink survey last year found its average passenger to be a suburban , white professional earning $ 63 # 000 annually -- more_than quadruple the $ 15 # 000 household income of 62 % of bus riders . Those differences make investment in rail projects at the expense of bus_service unconscionable , said James Moore , associate_professor of urban_planning and co-director of USC ' s Center for Advanced Transportation Technology . * Transit officials point_out that Los Angeles County voters approved a half-cent sales tax four years ago to raise money for commuter rail . The MTA has allocated $ 752.3 million for overall rail construction in its proposed budget_for next fiscal_year , including funding for the Blue Line extension to Pasadena and the Green Line trolley from Norwalk to El Segundo . Not providing longer-distance commuting options for residents because they happen to be more affluent and live_in the suburbs would be unfair , Metrolink Executive_Director Richard Stanger said . Suburban voters &quot; didn ' t say , ' Here ' s my money . Give it to the poor people to ride the buses and don ' t give me anything , ' &quot; Stanger said . &quot; that ' s what the people who support the buses expect . &quot; To a certain extent we have an obligation as a society to do that . But we also have a clear obligation from the voting measure to provide transit alternatives to outlying portions of the county. &quot; Stanger also takes_exception to assertions that the bus system is more cost-effective . Because the average trip aboard Metrolink ( 29 miles ) is longer than on the bus ( 3.9 miles ) , Metrolink moves people at a comparable cost , Stanger said . Calculated according to passenger miles , the Metrolink subsidy is 34 cents , close to the 30-cent subsidy per passenger mile for the bus system . ( The Blue Line subsidy is 35 cents , the Red_Line $ 2.95. ) MTA officials say establishing a network of rail_lines now is crucial if the region is to be equipped to deal with the transit needs of a larger population 30 years from now . But some critics question whether rail is the answer , especially in light of projections that bus riders will still form the largest group of transit users even when the MTA ' s ambitious rail projects are completed . The example of other cities that have recently built rail_lines should sound a warning , they contend . In a 1989 , federal study of eight cities that have completed rail projects within the last 20 years , five cities reported gains in overall transit use , but only at significant costs per passenger . Three cities , including Miami , dropped_in overall ridership because of bus_fare increases and service cuts adopted to help pay_for the new rail_lines . &quot; It sounds familiar , doesn ' t it ? &quot; USC ' s Moore said . &quot; Los Angeles is replicating a Miami experience. &quot; White disputes the charge , saying bus ridership has already been declining in recent years . It fell from a peak of 497 million annually in 1985 to 375 million this year , although some observers attribute the drop to the doubling of fares from 50 cents to $ 1.10 within a five-year period . By raising the fare to $ 1.35 , MTA officials expect to lose another 7 % of passengers , mostly among the poor . Other types of transit must fill the gap left by dwindling bus ridership , officials say . ( San Fernando Valley Edition ) Bus Vs . Rail To help balance its $ 2.9-billion budget , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has recommended that bus_fares be increased from $ 1.10 to $ 1.35. If approved , it would be the first fare hike in six years . Opponets accuse the MTA of turning_to bus riders to subsidize costly projects that serve far fewer people . MTA officials say that , while expensive , rail systems must be developed now to serve a burgeoning population in the next few decades .
