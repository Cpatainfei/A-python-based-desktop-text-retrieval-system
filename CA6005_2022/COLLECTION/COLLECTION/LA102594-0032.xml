   <HEADLINE> WHERE WILL ARAFAT STAND ON THE MAP OF FAITH ? ; MIDDLE_EAST : TO HAMAS ' SPIRITUAL_LEADER , A MUSLIM PALESTINE IS BEYOND QUESTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The abductions , murders and bombings perpetrated in Israel by members of the radical Palestinian Islamic movement , Hamas , have shown them to be a potent force . On one level , they are clearly engaged in a power struggle with Yasser Arafat , one that the PLO chairman cannot afford to lose . On another level , they are at war with nothing less than Western civilization , and this makes the response to them by both Arafat and Israeli leaders an extremely sensitive matter . This point_of_view was brought_home to me in a conversation I had with the Hamas spiritual_leader , Sheik Ahmed Yassin , shortly before he was arrested by the Israeli government several years ago . I met the aging sheik , left virtually paraplegic by a crippling neural disease , in the small prayer room of his simple residence on a hillside above the town of Gaza . The walls of the room were mostly devoid_of decoration , but there were two prints : one was a picture of the Muslim shrine , the Dome of the Rock , in Jerusalem ; the other was a drawing of the holy book , the Koran , superimposed on a map . The drawing showed the book as if it had arms that extended from Indonesia to Africa -- in a sense , embracing the world . This theme of Islam as a world_power and a force in Palestinian affairs was verbalized in our conversation . At that time , before the PLO-Israeli accords , the sheik thought that Arafat had a responsibility to make Palestine an Islamic state , since the overwhelming majority of its residents were Muslims . The idea of a secular state serving the interests of all religious communities seemed alien : an American notion , not a Palestinian one . If he went_to America , the sheik explained , he would obey American laws . In Palestine , one should obey the laws of Islam . It was a simple but profound equation : secular society on one side , Islam on the other . It was a comparison that I heard repeatedly in interviews with religious nationalists throughout the Islamic world . With only a switch in the name of the religious tradition , it was expressed by Buddhist nationalists in Sri Lanka , Hindu and Sikh nationalists in India and Jewish nationalists in Israel : Western civilization was_on one side , religion on the other . Behind this simple equation was often a vision of social reality that involved a series of concentric circles . The smallest were families and clans . Then came ethnic_groups and nations . The largest and implicitly the most important circles , encompassing the others , were international civilizations . From this point_of_view , the great civilizations are Islam , Buddhism , Hinduism or the civilizations of other religious traditions . Then there is Western civilization , which , although it claims today to be secular and universal , is seen by religious_leaders like Sheik Yassin as still , in_essence , the culture of Christian Europe -- as parochial in its own way as_many Westerners think Islam to be . In Hamas ' view , nations such_as France , England and the United States are subsets of Western civilization . Nations such_as Egypt , Iran and the incipient Palestine are subsets of Islam . This view of the rivalry of civilizations is the basis for several striking ideas that follow as logical conclusions to its premises : * The notion that the spread of Western-style secular culture and politics is a form of colonialism , for it is one civilization forcing its ideology on another . * The idea that America , even when not directly involved with a region like Palestine , is implicitly the enemy , since it is the fount of secular ideology and its most powerful proponent . * The fear that secular leaders like Arafat are not just bad Muslims but agents of a foreign ideology . This line_of_reasoning explains why America is so readily a target of religious terrorism , and why secular leaders like Israel ' s Yitzhak Rabin and the PLO ' s Arafat are so deeply mistrusted by the followers of Hamas . It also explains why Arafat ' s dilemma is so profound . He must combat Hamas as a political enemy , and yet his very act of defying the Islamic movement is testimony to the idea that his secularism is an enemy of Islam . This is especially true when Israel and America are seen as goading him on . In order for Arafat to succeed , he must fight Hamas on_his_own Palestinian -- and Islamic -- terms . To act in a way that would appear to cave_in to outside pressures and non-Islamic interests , however , would be political suicide . Or worse . The graves of assassinated secular leaders -- including Egypt ' s Anwar Sadat , India ' s Indira Gandhi and Algeria ' s Mohammed Boudiaf -- are tragic testimony to what can happen to leaders who are identified as enemies of religious nationalism . If Arafat suffers that fate , it will be not only Palestine ' s loss , but also Israel ' s and the world ' s . To avoid it , he must be allowed to do what secular leaders in similar situations around the world have attempted to do : embrace aspects of their traditional culture even as they attempt to isolate and destroy the activists who are its most extreme proponents .</TEXT>
