   <HEADLINE> NATION ' S 1993 INFANT-MORTALITY RATE EDGES DOWN TO ALL-TIME LOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s infant-mortality rate dropped to an all-time low in 1993 , although the rate is still higher than that of 21 other countries , the government ' s record-keepers reported Thursday . The infant-mortality rate fell to 8.3 deaths per 1 # 000 live_births in 1993 , a decline from 8.5 deaths per 1 # 000 the year before . There were also indications of a slight drop_in life_expectancy for newborns , according to provisional figures from the National Center for Health Statistics . Babies born in 1993 are expected to live an average of 75.5 years , down from 1992 ' s all-time high of 75.8 years . But almost a third of babies born in 1993 are expected to reach age 85 . Dr. Myron E . Wegman of the University of Michigan , author of a report on the figures in the journal Pediatrics , said life_expectancy fell because of an influenza epidemic in 1993 and because of higher death rates from pneumonia , influenza and chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_diseases . The National Center for Health Statistics also released final mortality statistics for 1992 : * Age-adjusted death rates for the six leading causes of death -- heart_disease , cancer , stroke , lung disease , accidents and pneumonia-influenza -- all fell . * Death rates declined for every age_group except 35 to 44 .</TEXT>
