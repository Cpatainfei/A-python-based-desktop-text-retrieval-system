   <HEADLINE> EXOTIC FRUIT ; IT ' S RARE , IT ' S EXOTIC , IT ' S FROM GRANADA HILLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> David Silber still likes to talk_about his first tropical fruit . In fact , he and his wife Tina named their Granada Hills nursery after it . And he has a photo album documenting his success with the babaco ( pronounced ba-BAH-co ) papaya . In the album are many pictures of Silber , Zsa Zsa Gabor and babacos at a gala tropical-fruit event . In some of the pictures , Zsa Zsa holds the oblong green fruit , the size and shape of a skinny , fluted football . Silber says of Zsa Zsa : &quot; She looks good there -- she ' s 70 years old , except , as you can see , she ' s fat. &quot; About the babaco , however , Silber has nothing but good things to say . &quot; Such an interesting fruit , &quot; he exclaims . &quot; It ' s aromatic and tastes like a cross between a banana and a pineapple , only not as sweet . It needs sugar , but that ' s OK . You can ' t add flavor or aroma to a fruit , but you can add sugar . And there ' s no waste with the babaco . It has no seeds and you can eat the skin . The plant is compact , but it ' s a big producer. &quot; In another photo album , there are pictures of award-winning babaco pies and cakes and savory dishes that Tina created . When sliced , the deep-yellow babaco makes a pretty star shape with a hollow center that Tina often fills with deep-purple passion_fruit . These days , the babaco is only one of 65 rare and exotic plant species the Silbers propagate and grow at the Papaya_Tree Nursery . This nursery / demonstration orchard is located in the yard around the Silbers ' white and gold-ocher ranch-style home . There is no sign outside , but those with an eye for unusual flora won ' t find the place difficult to spot . In a neighborhood of lawns and shade_trees and rose bushes , the Silbers ' is the only house surrounded by caper bushes , Persian mulberries , banana_trees , tropical guavas and mango_trees , with white bags covering the fruit . David Silber , now in his 50s , gave_up engineering at the peak of his career to raise rare tropical and sub-tropical plants . &quot; I ' m a kind of guy who likes to do his own thing , &quot; he says . Deeply tanned , with curly silver hair and lively blue eyes , Silber greets his customers in gym shorts and a sweat shirt cut_off way above the waist . He wears a toothpick behind his ear . He ' s cheerful , chatty , philosophical , uninhibited -- in the middle of a conversation , he ' s likely to squat down suddenly and rock on his toes to stretch his troublesome back . * &quot; I like plants , &quot; he says . &quot; We were vegetable growers before , but all this started 14 years ago , when a neighbor gave us some cherimoya and guava plants -- offbeat things . I joined the California Rare Fruit Growers , a club that provides information to growers . I ' m a contributing editor with them now -- I used to be a reader. &quot; In the kitchen , Silber slices off a wedge of pepino dulce , a pale-orange heart-shaped fruit with fuzzy purple stripes that has suffered , says Silber , from absolutely no promotion . Juicy , vaguely sweet , the pepino dulce tastes like a melon and is related to the tomato . &quot; It ' s good marinated in orange_juice or served with prosciutto , &quot; he says . A scrub jay flies into the adjacent lanai , perches on a basket handle and stares expectantly at Silber . Silber calmly shakes chopped nuts from a can and scatters them on the TV tray near the basket . As the jay eats his nuts , I ' m given a chunk of ice_cream banana , also called a blue Java , a thick , waxy-looking fruit that -- although not as sweet as tiny supermarket manzano bananas -- does indeed have good flavor and a dense , creamy texture . Silber next cuts_into a purple passion_fruit , which is commercially grown in Hawaii . The dark center looks_like inky tapioca and has a very strong , very rich , slightly fetid flavor . Silber explains , &quot; It ' s used only as a condiment -- it ' s too strong to eat by itself. &quot; To counter the passion_fruit , there ' s the creamy , smooth , sweet white sapote from Mexico . &quot; Mix it with ice , milk , a little sugar and you have an excellent milk_shake , &quot; says Silber . Before we leave the kitchen to tour the grounds , there ' s a slice of Dorset golden apple , a handsome , well-shaped yellow fruit with attractive , blushing shoulders , a beguiling crispness and friendly sweet taste . * In general , Silber searches out high-quality , large-fruited species that grow well in Southern California . &quot; Once I find a species , I develop mass propagation techniques , although mass , in my case , is probably seven or eight plants. &quot; Silber laughs . &quot; I ' m inquisitive . More so than average . I want to know things . I ' m in a restaurant shaking pepper on my food and I think , ' Where does pepper come from ? A tree ? A bush ? ' A vine , I find_out . I do some research . I got some vines , but I killed them . . . . &quot; The Silbers ' yard is a pleasant mixture of orchard and nursery . There ' s a small , tidy greenhouse and shade rooms for seedlings , cuttings and grafted cultivars . Throughout the yard , rows of trees and bushes in black plastic pots are clearly marked and priced . Trees , bushes and vines firmly rooted in the ground provide living proof that these rare and exotic species do indeed thrive in Southern California . &quot; The good thing about having a home demonstration orchard as well as a nursery , &quot; Silber says , &quot; is that customers can see what the plant looks_like and what the fruit tastes like . Also , we sell the fruit at certified farmers markets , so that ' s another source of income . And the orchard ' s a source of food : We eat the fruit . And we eat a lot of fruit , all day long. &quot; Silber grows a productive Florida mango called Edward in containers ; Edward , he claims , is one of the world ' s best mangoes . We also pause before a California mango named Thompson , whose branches are loaded . &quot; Look_at those fruitskies , &quot; says Silber . We are joined intermittently on our tour by Tina , who gives cooking and preparation advice , and the scrub jay , who alights on nearby branches and flicks his tail to get our attention . I learn that the gray-green , spoon-sized fruit I ' d known all my life as a guava is the Brazilian fruit called feijoa . When the Silbers speak_of guavas , they ' re referring to large tropical varieties whose fruits ripen in the fall and come_in three colors -- white , &quot; Red_Indian &quot; and magenta -- and weigh up_to a pound . &quot; With green guavas , &quot; Tina says , &quot; I make an American ' apple ' pie that ' s just delicious . With ripe fruit , I make nectar with a little lemon_juice , sugar and water . You can freeze the pulp. &quot; * The front_yard is dominated by a large olive_tree . Silber uses its limbs as support for three types of pitahaya plants . The pitahaya plants look_like skinny , vine-like cacti ; the fruit is smooth , petaled , not unlike a prickle-free cross between a prickly_pear and an artichoke , only fluorescent red ; inside , its berry-like meat is a deep-hot fuchsia . The first fruit of the spring grows nearby on a large , dark and furry-leafed bushy tree : Big Jim loquats , the Silbers claim , grow as large as baseballs and taste like cherimoyas . Also in the front_yard are Persian mulberries , the pepino dulces ( whose bushes do look_like a cross between a tomato and a pepper ) , and Oro Blanco grapefruit from southeast_Asia that both Tina and David Silber insist is the world ' s best grapefruit . On the side of the house , in raised beds , the Silbers grow six kinds of bananas that they believe are particularly well adapted to our Southern California climate : apple , Ice_Cream , Dwarf Jamaican Red , Dwarf Brazilian , Dwarf Orinoco and Raja Puri , an Indian banana . Big clumps of hanging fruit are wrapped in blue plastic to protect them from the sun -- the San Fernando Valley lacks the leaf cover of tropical forests . In the back yard , longan and lychee trees grow under shade cloth along with allspice_trees ( pimentas ) , which are native to Jamaica . David crumples up a leaf . It smells like spice_cake . Surinam_cherries , of which Silber seems quite fond , are adorably and perfectly fluted . They start_out a tangerine orange and ripen into classic , black-red cherry-ness and look as pretty as something you ' d pin on a hat . They don ' t taste much like cherries , but have a thick , almost swampy flavor -- and they don ' t hold_up well in cooking : You can ' t make a pie from them , for example . * Grumichama , a Brazilian cherry , is , according to Silber , even better than Bing : wine-y . But there are only a_few on a plant and a potential customer is coming_in the afternoon , so we ' ll have to take his word for it . Silber stops to sing the praises of Acerola cherries , originally from Barbados : &quot; They ' re the best source for Vitamin_C . Put them in full sun . You ' ll get a lot of cherries , five crops a year . You can eat them fresh ; they ' re sweet and delicious. &quot; Another item Silber likes to promote is the Miracle Fruit , a berry that , when chewed , makes acidic things , such_as yogurt or lemon , taste sweet . &quot; It ' s physiological , &quot; Silber explains . And , indeed , it works , only the sweetness is less like sugar and more like saccharin , and it lingers long after the thrill of sucking sweet_lemons wears_off -- about an hour . Better yet , suck an actual sweet_lemon , originally from Persia and now available in Granada Hills . Eventually , Silber ' s back begins to act_up , and he gets ' s a bit tired . Tina , watering nearby , is keeping a concerned eye on him . But the man ' s interest in his work is virtually irrepressible . He talks on with enthusiasm , about grafting , about watering ( bananas , and indeed , most tropicals , says Silber , require twice the water of citrus ) . He talks_about his passion for plumerias , those beautiful waxy flowers so popularized by Hawaiian leis , and about the idiosyncrasies he encounters in propagating and caring_for each plant . &quot; Every tropical is a different story , &quot; he says . One last question : What is he working_on now ? Silber frowns and removes the toothpick from behind his ear . &quot; Sapodillas or Chicos from South_America , &quot; he says . &quot; star_fruit from India . Pawpaw from the American South. &quot; ( he sings a song about the pawpaw patch , then explains that pawpaws are &quot; like cherimoyas , only better , and they ' ve found an anti-cancer drug in the bark of the tree. &quot; He thinks some more . &quot; Tree_tomatoes or tamarillos . Pitahayas . Oh , and Chinese mulberries. &quot; He pulls_out another photograph_album and shows me pictures of fruit that look_like small clumps of rose-red brains . &quot; I sold them at the farmers market and people came_back for more , &quot; he says . He thinks some more . &quot; Pineapples . Jack fruit . Egg fruit or canistel . Pistachios . . . . &quot; The list , he acknowledges , could go_on forever .
