   <HEADLINE> D.A. CALLS WATCHDOG UNIT EFFECTIVE , CRITICS CALL IT NEEDLESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Promoters of an Oxnard card club . Managers of a giant construction firm operating in Thousand Oaks . Some Inglewood police_officers living_in Simi Valley . And organized-crime figures trying to do business in the county . A year after formation of a small but highly publicized political corruption unit in the county prosecutor ' s office , Dist . Atty . Michael D . Bradbury lists those groups as some of the targets . Bradbury said he believes the unit has deterred local officials who might otherwise be tempted to peddle their influence . &quot; When you know there is a watchdog , honest people tend to remain honest , &quot; Bradbury said . Some critics , however , call the unit unnecessary . They say public officials in Ventura County adhere to a high code of personal ethics and that time spent looking_for corruption against them is not well spent . &quot; My experience in this county has been that I have not run_into any evidence or instances of political corruption , &quot; said county Supervisor Maggie Kildee , adding political corruption should be investigated only when there is sufficient evidence that it exists . &quot; I personally have never been approached by someone with that as a politician , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m simply not aware of that happening in this county. &quot; Nonetheless , Bradbury said he is glad he established the unit . &quot; The nice thing about this unit is it helps keep political figures_out of trouble , and it smacks them when they step across the line , &quot; he said . Bradbury announced the formation of the political corruption unit last June . At the time , he said the unit had been formed four months earlier and started its work by conducting an inquiry into possible laundering of contributions by card club promoters to the Oxnard City_Council . He said the new two-investigator unit would routinely analyze campaign and personal-finance documents filed by city officials and by holders of county and statewide offices . And he added that the specially trained investigators would undertake a broad range of investigations , looking_for corruption not only among politicians but in government-related transactions involving large amounts_of_money . But -- after almost a year of operations -- there is evidence that the unit has had difficulty finding anyone to charge with political corruption crimes . Charges have been filed_in only one case since the unit was created -- six misdemeanor counts of money_laundering and one felony count of grand theft against two former promoters of a card-club casino in Oxnard . They broke state law by making small contributions indirectly to two Oxnard councilmen , one former councilwoman and an assemblyman , prosecutors said . * In addition to the shortage of cases actually leading to charges , the unit has also been scaled back in size . Bradbury said he now has only one investigator -- not two -- assigned to political corruption investigations . And that investigator spends no more_than &quot; 25 % to 30 % &quot; of his time on such matters , he said . &quot; I don ' t think it would be wise or appropriate to devote a great_deal of resources to something like this , &quot; Bradbury said . &quot; On the other hand , it would n ' t be wise_to ignore it. &quot; Some public officials , especially those who consider the unit a luxury , said they are pleased to learn that the unit is not being touted as highly as in the past . &quot; I would agree that we always need to be aware and look_at any allegations that are raised , &quot; Kildee said . &quot; But it would seem that in a time of limited resources , it would n ' t be my highest priority at this point. &quot; Other politicians agreed . &quot; All I know is that those people who I ' ve associated with in the political_arena in my short term in office I ' ve found to be of great integrity , &quot; said Oxnard Councilman Andres Herrera , who was elected in November , 1992 . Others say Bradbury should not let_up on political corruption investigations . &quot; Politics can and often does lead to corruption , &quot; Oxnard Councilman Michael Plisky said . &quot; And I think the best prevention is just this kind of department . The presence of such a department may go_a_long_way toward preventing any problems with political corruption. &quot; * Preventing problems before they occur is what the political corruption unit has been doing , its architect said . &quot; When unsavory individuals are courting public officials , we will let them know &quot; about the person ' s background , Bradbury said . The prosecutor said there have been several instances since formation of the unit that his office has persuaded local officials against dealing with organized_crime figures . He would not say which local_governments received the advice . He also said his office was the first to alert Oxnard city officials that several people involved in last year ' s card-club proposal were convicted felons . But the political corruption probe into the card-club promoters yielded charges against two promoters who had no criminal_records -- Michael E . Wooten , 45 , of Camarillo and Frank Marasco , 48 , of Ventura . Each is charged with six misdemeanor counts of violating state law by making small contributions -- all less than $ 99 -- indirectly to two Oxnard councilmen , including Michael Plisky , who authorities say was unaware of the true source of the donations . But the level of the charges against Wooten and Marasco -- misdemeanors instead of felonies -- has caused the defendants ' supporters to claim Bradbury is prosecuting them to justify the resources used during the probe . &quot; He put a lot of time , energy and money into it , and didn ' t find anything , &quot; argued Richard C . Loy , Wooten ' s attorney . &quot; What did he uncover ? &quot; Loy asked . &quot; Perhaps some technical violations of reporting . In any other jurisdiction in the land , this would have been handled civilly. &quot; The defense has filed a motion in court , accusing the district_attorney ' s office of prosecutorial indiscretion , Loy said . &quot; It means , ' Mr. Prosecutor , use some common_sense here , ' &quot; he said of the motion . Louis B . Samonsky Jr. , Marasco ' s lawyer , was also incensed . &quot; If that ' s the political corruption that exists in this county , then I don ' t know that there is a necessity to have a political corruption unit , &quot; he said . &quot; I can ' t believe how clean the politics are in this county , compared to the east coast -- where if you are stopped for a traffic ticket you hand the officer a $ 20 bill with your driver ' s license , &quot; said Samonsky , a native Pennsylvanian . Bradbury agreed that Ventura County government officials generally are above suspicion . But he stands behind his prosecution of Wooten and Marasco , who are also charged with a felony count of grand theft unrelated to the contributions in Oxnard . In the felony case , prosecutors allege Wooten and Marasco -- co-owners of the defunct Darrik Marten Co . in Ventura -- submitted a false $ 10 # 000 construction voucher to a consortium of Ventura County investors in 1992 , then used the money personally without telling the lender . And Bradbury said the work of his political corruption unit goes beyond the charges filed against Wooten and Marasco . Ventura County prosecutors initiated an ongoing FBI investigation into suspected double-billing by Lehrer McGovern Bovis , the nation ' s second-largest construction management firm , on projects including the $ 64-million performing arts center in Thousand Oaks , Bradbury said . Bradbury also said that his political corruption investigators were involved in obtaining search_warrants in a bookmaking investigation that led last week to the suspension of some Inglewood police_officers residing in Simi Valley . But Bradbury would not disclose details of that case . Bradbury said the political corruption unit is important because Ventura County is a fast-growing community and the site of major development projects . He said even honest public officials can be tempted by the lure of making a fast buck . Ventura County ' s political corruption unit is modeled after one in Orange County -- which has had a string of major political corruption cases during the last 10 years . Orange County has four district_attorney ' s investigators who devote about 50 % of their time probing political corruption , said Chief_Assistant Orange County Dist . Atty . Maurice Evans . Evans said those investigators also routinely check campaign and personal finance records of public officials . But most of their cases are referred to them , he said . In Ventura County , the public probably will never see the benefits of the new unit , Bradbury said . Most of its work is designed to head_off problems before they occur , he said . Bradbury said investigating political corruption is not like investigating more routine crimes such_as burglaries . &quot; We ' re blessed in this county with pretty honest political figures , so you are not going_to see indictments charging mayors . . . and other political officials with crimes , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
