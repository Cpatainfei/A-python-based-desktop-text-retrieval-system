   <HEADLINE> MICROSOFT CASE CAUSES LITTLE STIR ; REACTION : INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES IN ORANGE COUNTY SEE FEW CHANGES FROM SETTLEMENT OF CHARGES AGAINST SOFTWARE GIANT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Computer_industry executives in Orange County say they do not forecast big changes resulting from Microsoft Corp. ' s agreement to settle antitrust charges by adjusting the way it sells operating systems to personal_computer makers . Safi Qureshey , chairman of AST Research in Irvine , a leading PC manufacturer , summed_up his feelings on Microsoft ' s signing of a consent decree with the Justice_Department with one word : relief . &quot; There ' s a sense of relief that it is over , &quot; he said Monday . But Shannon Jenkins , chief_executive at TouchStone Software Corp . in Huntington Beach , said she &quot; didn ' t hear anything encouraging &quot; in news_reports following the agreement reached Friday . Under the accord , Microsoft , the world ' s largest software maker , agreed to end certain sales practices , such_as charging computer makers a lower price for its operating system based on each machine they sell regardless of whether Microsoft software was actually installed . Most industry watchers generally agree the settlement will not have a big immediate impact on PC makers or on their customers , given the limited nature of the settlement and Microsoft ' s dominance of the software industry -- it controls 85 % of the market . Qureshey said he believes only 1 % of his customers currently have a serious interest in outfitting their computers with an operating system other_than those made by Seattle-based Microsoft . As such , Qureshey said he does not see any significant change in his business . But on a less tangible level , Qureshey said he viewed the settlement as positive because it removes a &quot; potential black cloud &quot; that may have depressed sales for his company and for the entire marketplace . Qureshey also said he was happy that the dispute did not go_to trial because if it had , AST would likely have been asked by the government to turn_over documents on its business_relationship with Microsoft . AST -- the world ' s fifth-largest personal_computer maker -- had already been required to provide Justice officials with some information , Qureshey said . He declined to elaborate . Software makers like TouchStone criticized the accord , saying it had hoped Microsoft would be forced , among other things , to make faster and fuller disclosures to the entire industry about changes to its operating system , which is critical to rival software publishers because they must design products so they ' re compatible with them . For example , TouchStone ' s Jenkins said that her firm -- with about $ 5 million in annual sales and 35 employees -- recently bailed_out of an agreement to develop an Internet-related software_product because of concerns that Microsoft could soon come_out with its own software that could have devoured it . &quot; I was hoping for some powerful results from what the Justice_Department was doing , &quot; Jenkins said . &quot; I ' m fairly disappointed. &quot; David Hanna , chairman of State_of_the_Art Inc. , an Irvine-based maker of accounting software that does not directly compete with Microsoft , said he expects the settlement to be positive for his company in the long_run . Because the accord calls_for less restrictive non-disclosure agreements , Hanna says that will enable his company to have a more open relationship with Microsoft . In the same vein , Ron Siede , director of marketing for Kingston Technology , said the settlement may indirectly give a boost to his company . Kingston , based in Fountain Valley , makes hardware that upgrades computer memory . Siede said he believes the settlement will push the market to come_out with new software faster than before .</TEXT>
