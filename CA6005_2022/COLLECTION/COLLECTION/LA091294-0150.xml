   <HEADLINE> AMID CROATS ' ADULATION , POPE RENEWS CALLS FOR PEACE ; BALKANS : HE TELLS CROWD ' HISTORIC REALISM ' REQUIRES ACCOMMODATION AMONG WARRING ETHNIC GROUPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pope John Paul II climaxed his first visit to the former Yugoslav federation Sunday amid the electric adulation of hundreds of thousands of followers and sobering new calls_for Balkan peace . The 74-year-old pontiff was strong-voiced at a three-hour Mass in this capital of predominantly Roman_Catholic Croatia , but he maneuvered with difficulty on a right leg broken_in April . &quot; The leg troubles him , but his spirits are very high , &quot; said the Rev . Roberto Tucci , a senior papal aide . An elevator at the back of a three-story papal altar at the racetrack here spared John Paul the steep , 27-step climb , and aides helped him in and out of cars and his Popemobile . But the strain of the journey showed in his face . Italian photographers who take pictures of the Pope for a living returned from a morning photo session at the presidential palace with sadness in their eyes . &quot; He doesn ' t look good at all , &quot; one photographer said . John Paul looked very good , by contrast , to jubilant Croats who applauded every step of the first Pope to visit a city where Christianity came 900 years ago . Organizers estimated the racetrack crowd at between 500 # 000 and 750 # 000 -- cowled , contemplative nuns , young people in peasant dress , city families , the disabled in wheelchairs and big , young soldiers in berets , all basking in the chords of a 230-voice choir . Addressing them , the green-robed John Paul made the most of his stay in the only part of the former Yugoslav federation he has been able to visit ; the Pope is not welcome among Serbian leaders in Belgrade , and security concerns forced him to scrap last week ' s scheduled visit to Sarajevo , the capital of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina . &quot; Raise_up your ardent and trusting plea for peace , &quot; the Pope urged in a Mass homily he delivered in Serbo-Croatian and directed not only to Croats but also to Serbs and Muslims . &quot; The present tragic division and tensions must_not make us forget that there are many elements today that unite the people at war . . . . &quot; Peace in the Balkans -- I emphasize strongly in this time of suffering -- is not a utopia ! Rather , it is necessary from the point_of_view of historic realism. &quot; The Pope won his biggest applause when he drew an analogy between religious faith and the Sava River , which bisects Zagreb . &quot; Faith in this region , today so sorely tried , must return to be a unifying and beneficial force like the rivers that flow through it . I am thinking_of the River Sava , which , beginning in Slovenia , flows through your country across the borders of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina through Serbian land , into the Danube . . . . Two rivers that meet are called to unite many peoples , just as the two expressions of Christianity must do -- Western and Eastern -- that have always coexisted in these lands , &quot; he said . Roman_Catholics , Orthodox Christians and Muslims have dwelt together in the Balkans for a millennium , he noted , adding , &quot; It is not lawful to attribute to religion the phenomenon of nationalistic intolerance which is raging in this region. &quot; Representatives of Croatia ' s Muslim minority attended the papal Mass on Sunday , and a leader of Zagreb ' s small Jewish community welcomed the Pope in a brief address to the crowd . The Serbian Orthodox Church , however , declined invitations to the Mass , Vatican officials said . Serbian spokespersons have publicly accused the Vatican of siding with Croatia in the Balkans vortex of ethnic violence . In a speech at Zagreb ' s airport before his departure for Rome , the Pope urged his listeners : &quot; Dare to forgive and welcome others . . . . To forgive means to free the heart from the feeling of revenge which is not compatible with the civilization of love. &quot;</TEXT>
