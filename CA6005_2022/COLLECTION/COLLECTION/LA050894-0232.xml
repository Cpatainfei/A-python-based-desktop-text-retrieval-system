   <HEADLINE> VOICES : GIVING_BACK ; AS A FEMALE ASIAN AMERICAN , A VETERAN RESERVE POLICE_OFFICER SAYS SHE BRINGS A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE TO THE LAPD . GETTING THE CHANCE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THE STREETS IS HER GREATEST REWARD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I ' ve been helped by community groups , and I wanted to give some of that back . When I was in high_school I was selected by the school district to represent Los Angeles in the sister city program with Nagoya , Japan . That was a three-week fully paid scholarship to Japan to serve as a student ambassador . that ' s not the sort of opportunity that comes_along all_the time . So now I really want to make a difference . There are two things I find really important for a city , and that ' s education and law_enforcement . So I found time and avenues to do volunteer work for both of these areas . In the police reserve program I know that I ' m able to make a difference working with people on a one-to-one basis . I consider myself a communicator . that ' s what being a police_officer is about : communication . Being female and being Asian American , I bring a unique perspective . The department is very diversified , but it doesn ' t have a lot of resources in some areas . There are a_few LAPD officers who know Japanese , but I don ' t think any of them are females who are Asian . I was told that if I did not work_on the pandering case , we probably would not be able to pursue it . I had some anxiety ahead of time , but once I sat there with the suspect it was acting time and I played that role . I dressed like I do for work , and he told me to wear something a little more flashy and more makeup . I met with him twice . He was trying to figure_out where I was coming from . The way the Japanese communicate , they don ' t get right to_the_point . They like to chitchat . He asked me what I did . At the time I was shopping for insurance for my firm and I told him I was in insurance . I had to testify at the preliminary hearing . That case was my second time working undercover with the Asian Crime Investigation Section . The other one involved an art forgery ring that was selling to Japanese businessmen . That was in ' 88 or ' 89 . I portrayed the secretary of a Japanese businessman . The man who portrayed the businessman was the same reserve officer who worked as a customer in the pandering case . In the art forgery case , another LAPD officer portrayed an interpreter . We were in one of the hotels and pretended that we were just traveling through and were ready to make a purchase . They brought the art pieces with them and said they were authentic and if we would wire millions of dollars into their account , we could have the art right there . I wasn ' t nervous . It was carefully planned and there were officers in a room next to us . Every day I work it ' s different . One thing I do is help teach human relations classes at the Police_Academy . The purpose is to familiarize the recruits on who the Asian Americans are , what their attitudes are toward police_officers , what to expect . For instance , normally if I ' m talking to you and I ' m not looking you in the eye , you might think I ' m lying to you . But for Asians it could be a sign of respect , because it ' s considered very challenging and aggressive to look someone in the eye . I enjoy patrol and the foot beats the most , being out there with the people . I feel_like I can do some good in Little Tokyo , where some of the merchants don ' t speak English and might be suspicious of the police . Sometimes I speak_to Asian groups about crime and law_enforcement . I make at least one arrest every time I ' m out . Maybe it ' s arresting someone who has a warrant out . The crimes can range from robbery to breaking_into cars . I think being female and short helps me because I appear to be non-threatening . It has a calming effect . I remember once on Broadway we got a call that a man was tearing_up a shoe_store and that the store employees had him in custody . My partner and I got there and I could tell the man was scared . He was a big guy and these two employees had a hold of him . So I went_up to him and said , &quot; If I tell them to let you go , will you be nice to me ? &quot; And he said &quot; OK. &quot; It was just a matter of talking to him in a way he understood and I had no problems after that . I really think that people should look_at becoming a reserve officer . It ' s very rewarding and it will help the community and it will open your eyes . People say , &quot; Where ' s a cop when you need one ? &quot; Well , why don ' t they volunteer ?</TEXT>
