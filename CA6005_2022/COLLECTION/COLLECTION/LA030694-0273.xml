   <HEADLINE> ONE-MAN PATROL ; CRIME IS DOWN IN MOUNTAINS SINCE DEPUTY TOOK OVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like some high-country wilderness guide , Bennie Garnes scans the horizon and senses trouble . The weather , at best an unpredictable animal in these mountain parts , seems poised to strike . The blustery night has brought six inches of new snow to the San Gabriel Mountains -- a heavy load that makes driving treacherous . Now the wailing wind and promise of another storm have whipped_up fresh concerns in the mind of Los Angeles County ' s most isolated deputy_sheriff . Garnes has spent the morning cruising the frozen white-washed roads in his secluded corner of Angeles Highway in and around the town of Wrightwood , looking_for tire tracks gone awry , a sure signal of a downed motorist . For five winters now , Garnes has been the highest cop in Southern California -- a lone-patrol deputy whose beat stretches 300 square_miles across northern Los Angeles County , rising clear to 8 # 000 feet , higher than many Colorado ski resorts . A river -- known as Big Rock Creek -- runs_through this patrol territory , which extends from the San Bernardino County_line west to the Vincent Gap , ranging north and south between highways 138 and 2 . It is an area of still-wild , often-inhospitable country the size of the San Fernando Valley , a domain dominated by National Forest land . Near Vincent Gulch Divide , Garnes spies two young hikers , their faces tucked into parkas as they ready for a trek toward the old Big Horn gold mine . Garnes doesn ' t trust them any more_than he does the weather . He swings the black_and_white , four-wheel-drive sheriff ' s cruiser around and questions the pair like a suspicious night security_guard -- demanding their estimated time_of_departure from the woods . His woods . &quot; Hey , this just isn ' t a good_day for a winter walk , &quot; he says as the hikers hustle off under cruel , iron-gray skies . &quot; But I can ' t stop them from going_in there . This is National Forest land , open_to the public . My job is to keep_an_eye_on them , make_sure they don ' t do anything stupid. &quot; During summer months , Garnes helps patrol a 1 # 000-square-mile expanse of high desert into the farthest reaches of the Antelope Valley . But -- from Thanksgiving to Easter -- he becomes a mountain_man , a loner . Indeed , he is the only lawman many residents ever see in this high-country terrain populated not only by commuting big-city professionals and day-trip skiers , but by stately pinion pines , bald_eagles , brown_bears and mountain_lions . Like a police_department ' s urban foot_soldier , his job is to create a presence throughout this mountain country . Since he began as Wrightwood ' s resident sheriff in 1989 , crimes such_as drug possession and equipment theft at the nearby Mountain High ski resort have plummeted . He has also played a key role in numerous rescues of hikers and skiers who became lost in an area that is 52 miles away from the nearest L.A. County sheriff ' s station . Day after day , as he patrols the lonely wilderness trails and winding highways , Garnes feels more like a Montana lawman than one working 50 miles north of the nation ' s second-largest city . Over the years , this far-flung patrol has qualified him as the only L.A. County sheriff ' s deputy with department-issue snow shoes , foul-weather parka and furry , Moscow cap . &quot; And I ' d bet money , &quot; he says , &quot; that I ' m the only local deputy who ' s ever entertained a high-speed pursuit with a snowmobile. &quot; The 44-year-old Garnes , who began his law_enforcement 20 years ago patrolling the streets of South-Central Los Angeles , came_to the mountains following the discovery of a 9-year-old boy who had frozen to death under a foot of snow after wandering away from a church outing . Sheriff ' s authorities soon decided they needed a stronger presence around Wrightwood , which on many winter weekends sees its 2 # 500 population increase tenfold with skiers , snow-boarders and tumbling tobogganers . Residents had also complained that deputies summoned during winter storms would show_up in their shiny black street shoes , ignorant of the area , worthless as a hound_dog with a bad cold . So Garnes , who had lived_in Wrightwood since the mid 1980s , was assigned there , at first just on weekends . His presence was felt within weeks . Garnes rescued a 16-year-old avalanche victim trapped under four feet of snow for more_than 95 minutes -- surviving the longest such ordeal in the United States , he says . Now full-time , Garnes spends his days as a voice of reason for city-folk who rush to the mountains at the first sight of snow , often ignoring the simplest precautions . On snowy days , he tickets motorists whose cars slip and slide along mountain roads without chains , searches for lost skiers who decide to forge their own trails . He organizes emergency response efforts for sledders with broken backs , hikers with frostbite . Several weeks ago , Garnes headed the unsuccessful rescue attempt for a woman who drowned after falling_through the thin ice of local Jackson Lake . He calls them flatlanders , the overzealous city-dwellers who see the snow-capped distant mountains and run toward the_hills as though on some frenzied gold_rush . Many wanderers assume they ' re safe just because they can often see the downtown skyline from the mountains . The resulting high_jinks -- some of them deadly -- make Garnes shake his head . &quot; Let ' s face it , a lot of people who come_up here are knuckleheads , &quot; he says . &quot; In altitude , this place is more like Alberta , Canada , than Los Angeles County . I ' ve seen too many people in jean jackets and tennis_shoes who have no clue about how fast things can change around here , who have no respect for the terrain , the weather or the wilderness. &quot; Not Garnes . His time in the San Gabriels has taught him a love and respect for this rugged landscape , where avalanches and and rock falls occur almost whimsically , where &quot; icy road &quot; signs mean business , a place where the fat pinion pine cones are among the largest of their kind in the world . With his thick mustache , Garnes is a walrus of a man resembling Captain Kangaroo . He is soft spoken -- a cop who would rather give a warning than a ticket , one who gets a kick_out of helping to chase a neighbor ' s stray cow down a mountain road . The steep San Gabriels , he says , are among the most dangerous mountain_ranges in the world . Garnes delivers such statements because he knows the land . He knows the secret fishing holes where you can find 14-inch trout and can show you the inspiration points where a person with decent eyesight can see for 150 miles or more . Over the years , he has come_to appreciate the blanketing beauty of the season ' s first snowfall . He has sat in his cruiser eyeing a cagey mountain_lion or Big Horn sheep pad across the road , a bald_eagle soar like a feathered hang-glider , gaining altitude with one flap of its majestic wings . But he has also come_across a more perverse side of these woods -- the pornographic movies shot here , covert drug dealing , drunken drivers careening home from a day of skiing . He has chased down escapees from the nearby prison fire camp , arrested suspects in the selfish thievery of everything from trucks to snowboards . Like a cagey animal , Garnes has taken a bite_out of crime in this backcountry . Between 1989 and 1993 , ski-theft incidents , for example , fell from 302 to 41 . Acting as his own one-horse patrolman and detective , Garnes has made 76 felony arrests since 1989 , collars ranging from narcotics crimes to fraud , robbery and burglary . Locals like what they see . Thanks to Garnes , Wrightwood is a place where people don ' t always bother to lock the front_door . &quot; He just makes us feel safe up here , &quot; said Charlie Koenig , owner of Charlie ' s Market in Wrightwood . &quot; Time was , it took a deputy three hours to get here on a call , if they came at all . But Bennie is here within minutes . He ' s one of us. &quot; On the streets of Wrightwood , Garnes is part Andy of Mayberry , part Colombo , part McCloud on horseback , a good-old boy who locals say makes the best chocolate chip and walnut cookies in town . On slow days , and there are many of them at this altitude , he might stop for a chat with the folks at the U.S. Forest Service_station or the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory outpost , checking in_for a cup of coffee at the Mile High cafe in nearby Valyermo . At the Mile High , a former stagecoach stop that once had a brothel out back , where chain_saws and snow-shoes now hang from the walls and ceilings , talk turns_to the time Garnes rousted a 350-pound brown_bear that had broken_into the place for a late-night bite . &quot; I used a fire_extinguisher to drive him out from under the floorboards , &quot; Garnes recalled . &quot; Man , did he come roaring out of that hole , all_right . He was last seen heading south into the mountains with a big ' ol white butt. &quot; Animals aren ' t the only wildlife around here . Garnes keeps_an_eye_on a character known as Crazy Jim who ' s been known to brandish a weapon , claiming to be an ex-CIA agent . And the hitchhiker who travels each weekend from the San Fernando Valley to stand on street_corners , waving at passersby like some smiling Vegas clown . Then there was the Big Horn mine burglary . Several gang members were surprised during a trailer break-in there and were being chased by three miners wielding shotguns : &quot; You ' ve got_to understand that you ' re not in the big city up here , &quot; Garnes said . &quot; People take matters into their own hands. &quot; By the time Garnes caught_up_with the chase , the miners had collared three of the thieves but had let one slip_away . But on this 9-degree day , Garnes wasn ' t worried . He just sat in his cruiser with the heater running , his three suspects handcuffed in the back seat . Then came a tap on the frosted window . &quot; Are you the guy I ' m looking_for ? &quot; Garnes asked . &quot; Yeah , &quot; came the reply . &quot; Hurry up , get the cuffs . It ' s cold out here. &quot; Lonely Patrol Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Deputy Bennie Garnes patrols some of the most remote and sparsely populated areas in the county . In the winter , he is the only officer patrolling a 300-square-mile area . In summer , he and another deputy cover 1 # 000 square_miles across the San Gabriel Mountains and Antelope Valley .</TEXT>
