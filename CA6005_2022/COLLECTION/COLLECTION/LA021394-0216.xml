   <HEADLINE> THE OTHER COMEBACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even if the events of Jan . 6 at Detroit ' s Cobo Arena had not occurred , the 1994 Winter_Olympics might have been considered a comeback for figure skater Nancy Kerrigan . Kerrigan won a bronze medal in the 1992 Winter Games , but dropped to fifth best at the 1993 World Figure_Skating Championships in Prague . In the rarefied air of elite sports , a mere slip_in the standings -- especially when one is expected to rise -- is seen as a slide of unnerving import . After her flawed long program at the Worlds , Kerrigan was caught moaning , &quot; I just want to die. &quot; But that reaction would be nothing compared to her piercing response -- &quot; Why me ? &quot; -- after being struck just above the knee by a baton-wielding assailant during the week of the U.S. Figure_Skating Championships in January . Kerrigan had recovered from the Prague setback with the help of a sports psychologist and high-intensity training , and she went_to Detroit favored to win the U.S. title and , consequently , the front-runner ' s spot on the U.S. Olympic team . After the attack , she was placed on the team by fiat . But it was not at all certain that the 24-year-old would be ready for the Games , which opened yesterday in Lillehammer , Norway . The physical challenge would be the easy part . No bones were broken , no muscles torn . And Kerrigan had access to the best rehabilitation equipment and methods . Even before she was back on the ice , she let the press watch her working_out in a pool and the gym . By three weeks after the accident , she had started doing triple jumps at her hometown rink , on Nancy Kerrigan Way in Stoneham , Mass . Kerrigan ' s psychological fitness would be a bigger question . In interviews , she has quietly admitted to suffering knee-clutching nightmares and even to being startled at a party when she turned quickly and glimpsed someone holding a bag of potato_chips close to her head . But Paul Wylie , Kerrigan ' s training partner and 1992 Olympic figure_skating silver medalist , declared in Newsweek , &quot; Nancy Kerrigan is no weak sister . This hasn ' t thrown her for a loop. &quot; And her mother , in a TV interview in late January , turned quickly from tearful emotion to dry-eyed resolve when asked if she thought her daughter should retire . &quot; Oh , no , &quot; Brenda Kerrigan answered , &quot; that ' s not what this family is about . that ' s giving_up . . . no way ! &quot; Even Kerrigan said that she ' d put past distractions behind her . &quot; When I ' m on the ice , nothing really affects me , &quot; she said in the same interview . While Kerrigan worked to return to form , Tonya Harding , winner of the national championship after Kerrigan was forced to withdraw , lost her balance . Harding , 23 , also had been poised for a dramatic comeback . In 1991 , she had outscored both Kerrigan and gold-medalist-to-be Kristi Yamaguchi to win the U.S. Championships , landing a gravity-disdaining triple axel jump , which only she and Japan ' s Midori Ito , among the women , have pulled_off in competition . In the 1992 Olympics , though , Harding finished a medal-less fourth , crashing the two times she attempted the 3 1 / 2-rotation jump . As four men -- Harding ' s ex-husband , Jeff Gillooly , her sometime bodyguard Shawn Eric Eckardt , alleged Kerrigan knee-bruiser Shane Stant and Stant ' s uncle Derrick Smith -- were arrested and charged for conspiring to harm Kerrigan , accusations swirled about her own involvement in the plot . Harding issued denials and continued to train . As of press time , she had not been charged and remained on the U.S. Olympic team but that could change up until two days before competition begins . ( If she is removed from the team , 13-year-old Michelle Kwan of Torrance will skate instead. ) No matter whom Kerrigan has to compete against , it seems that she can ' t lose . If she wins another Olympic medal , especially gold , the fairy-tale comeback will be complete . But even in defeat , she ' ll be crowned by the press and marketers for her Hepburnlike beauty and resilient spirit . As sports agent Michael Rosenberg of Palm Desert put it bluntly : &quot; She went from an A-minus superstar to a spectacular superstar with one whack. &quot; Kerrigan ' s Campbell ' s Soup commercial is already in heavy rotation in Los Angeles , and the skater took a quick trip here in late January to film a Reebok spot , which will debut during the Olympics . Dave Fogelson , spokesman for the shoe company , would n ' t give specifics of the script . But the general theme ? &quot; Overcoming obstacles , &quot; he said . Michele Kort</TEXT>
