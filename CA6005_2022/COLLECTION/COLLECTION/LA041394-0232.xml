   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb rebels hardened their defiance of the outside world Tuesday , ordering troops to shoot_down NATO warplanes , laying mines to trap U.N. peacekeepers and rebuffing high-level diplomats seeking to rescue abandoned peace talks . Bosnian government forces clashed with Serbs in the U.N. safe area of Gorazde , but the fighting was reported to be less intense than on the previous day , and the U.N. commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina blamed Muslim-led government units for starting it . Tensions escalated throughout Bosnia as the Serbs tightened their chokehold on this encircled capital . They also made clear through a coordinated series of retaliations for North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air strikes that no foreigners are safe in Serb-held territory . They warned that the U.N. Protection Force is now considered an enemy . A Dutch military observer in the Zepa safe area disappeared and was presumed kidnaped when he tried to cross into a Serb-held area . Rebels have also imprisoned 10 workers from a French relief agency at their garrison in the Serb-occupied Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica . The U.N. commander for Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , said the incidents were being raised with Bosnian Serb authorities &quot; at the administrative level &quot; but that he did not want the hostile actions to become an issue that would overshadow the broader aim of restarting negotiations . &quot; I would rather downplay the situation and leave things fairly calm . We are quite capable of existing at the moment , and this is not something I want to take_up with them when we have more important things to discuss , &quot; Rose said of the blockade that has effectively made hostages of all U.N. troops , relief workers and foreign journalists in the capital . Sarajevo ' s 380 # 000 residents were already prisoners of the 2-year-old Serbian siege that has maintained armed checkpoints at all points_of_entry . One senior relief official criticized as dangerous the U.N. commander ' s posture of ignoring the blockade . &quot; Rose and his people are misleading everyone . They may even be misleading themselves , &quot; said the official , who has spent much of the war in Sarajevo . In other developments Tuesday : * President Clinton warned both sides in the Gorazde fighting against improperly interpreting the NATO intervention ; he insisted that the Western alliance simply is acting to prod the warring parties to return to peace talks . * Russian lawmakers and other officials renewed their objections to the NATO action , saying it now imperils Russia ' s prospective links with the Western allies . * The Pentagon disclosed that most of the bombs released over Gorazde on Monday were duds . * The Belgrade government , accusing them of unfair reporting , said it will bar the Cable News Network and the_French news_agency Agence France-Presse from reporting in Yugoslavia . The government said it will probably take similar action against other foreign media . CNN said it had not received official notice of the action . But it defended the fairness and objectivity of its reporting . It was unclear what , if any , effect the government statement would have_on the news organizations ' reporting from the rump Yugoslavia , which now includes Serbia and Montenegro . Fear , Defiance The defiance of Bosnian Serb leaders in their mountain stronghold of Pale , 10 miles to the east , was interpreted by some U.N. and diplomatic sources here as bluster and by others as evidence of fierce resolve . &quot; We ' re in this now , and the only question is whether we ' re going to know how to follow_through , because the Serbs will keep probing and probing to see where the limits are , &quot; one Western diplomatic source warned . He said he feared the incidents suggested that the rebel leadership is in the hands of military hard-liners who will continue to test the international community ' s commitment to halting their deadly land-grab and &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot; The Bosnian Serb military commander , Gen . Ratko Mladic , ordered his troops to fire on any NATO planes they consider a threat , Serbian radio in Pale reported . A Serbian journalist contacted by telephone in Pale described the rebel leadership as confident . He said Mladic and political_leader Radovan Karadzic had played a game of chess after visiting a front-line emplacement . Maj . Rob Annink , a U.N. Protection Force spokesman , described most U.N.-patrolled areas of Bosnia as tense , including Sarajevo . It was the first time the atmosphere in the capital has deteriorated since a Feb . 21 NATO ultimatum that forced Serbs to surrender or pull_back the heavy artillery used to batter the city to ruins . Top U.N. civilian and military officials , as well as U.S. special envoy Charles Redman , had planned to travel_to Pale to meet with Karadzic and Mladic to discuss the situation but were told by telephone they were unwelcome , U.N. sources said . The commander for all 32 # 000 U.N. troops in the Balkans , French Gen . Bertrand de Lapresle , and the special representative of U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , Yasushi Akashi of Japan , flew back to mission headquarters in the Croatian capital of Zagreb after the rebuff . They left by U.N. helicopter , the only aircraft to risk landing at the Sarajevo airport . The U.N. humanitarian airlift of food and other supplies to the capital has been suspended indefinitely for security reasons . Mines , Shells Serbs laid mines to hamper movement of U.N. troops at the depots where the Serbs ' surrendered tanks and guns are stored , Annink said . The head of the 50-man U.N. military observer mission for eastern Bosnia , Canadian Maj . Roy Thomas , said about 40 of his men in Serb-held areas were under house_arrest by the nationalist rebels and that one Dutch officer had been missing since crossing through a Serbian checkpoint outside Zepa early Monday . French Cmdr . Eric Chaperon , another U.N. spokesman , said Tuesday that Gorazde was considerably calmer than the previous day , when Serbs pressed in , despite the first NATO air strikes Sunday , to take vast new stretches of government territory along the Drina River in the southeast . Rose had accused the government forces earlier Tuesday of disrupting the morning calm by firing on Serbs who had moved to within two miles of the city_center and conquered several densely populated suburbs . Chaperon said later that shooting and shelling had come from both sides . &quot; Both of the warring parties were firing at a small hill , which is southeast of the city , &quot; Chaperon said , confirming that the government shooting was directed at rebel forces that had already invaded the enclave . He said there was no major change in control of territory around Gorazde . About 15 % of the U.N. safe area has been occupied by the Serbian nationalists over the past two weeks . Rose and Lapresle told journalists that the resort_to NATO air_power was made because U.N. troops were endangered by the Serbian offensive against Gorazde . Eight U.N. liaison officers and five military observers have been deployed to the pocket . &quot; When my troops get put_in a position where they get directly attacked and the only response to preserve life is to use close air support , then it is I that decides that ' s what we should do , &quot; Rose said , explaining the sequence of events that led to his calling in air strikes . &quot; There ' s no question of it being a political act. &quot; He described the bombings that destroyed two Serbian artillery positions as &quot; very measured , very controlled , the use of minimum force to preserve the life of my soldiers. &quot; Lapresle said force had been used &quot; with great restraint and after many warnings. &quot;</TEXT>
