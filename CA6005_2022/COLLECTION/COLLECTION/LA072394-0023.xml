   <HEADLINE> QUESTIONS STILL LACK ANSWERS IN COLOSIO PROBE ; MEXICO : NEW PROSECUTOR WILL HAVE TO PROVE TO A SKEPTICAL PUBLIC THAT SHE IS NOT PART OF A COVER-UP . MANY DOUBT ' LONE ASSASSIN ' THEORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a Spartan meeting room overlooking the colonial patio of the Mexican Senate building , a congressional committee charged with following the investigation into the murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio listened attentively . Dr. Rafael Moreno , the attorney_general ' s head of criminology , was outlining the questions that he said any crime investigation must answer : &quot; What happened ? . . . Who is the murderer ? Who is the victim ? . . . When did_it happen ? . . . How ? . . . Where ? . . . What weapon was used ? And finally , why ? &quot; Two weeks later , early this month , Moreno and a dozen other forensics experts signed_off on a report on Colosio ' s murder that , for most Mexicans , left many of those questions without credible answers . People simply do not believe their conclusion that accused killer Mario Aburto Martinez was the classic lone assassin , a deranged dissident determined to make his mark on history . In the national uproar that followed , President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ordered the investigation reopened . Olga Islas , the new special prosecutor Salinas appointed , faces the daunting challenge of proving to a conspiracy-minded public that she is not participating in a cover-up by hard-line members of Colosio ' s own ruling party , drug_traffickers or someone else . &quot; I am not saying that there was a mastermind , just that the conclusions should be reached after a serious investigation , &quot; said Juan Velazquez , an attorney representing Colosio ' s widow , Diana Laura Riojas . &quot; All I am doing is asking_for an investigation. &quot; In doing so , Velazquez and Riojas are exercising her rights under Mexican law , which grants the victim ' s family a standing equal_to that of the defense or prosecution . The fragile-looking mother of two young children has become the voice for Mexicans demanding justice . &quot; They should talk with Mr. Aburto ' s family ; they should look_into the references_to third_persons in his writing , &quot; said Velazquez . &quot; They should investigate. &quot; Aburto ' s father , who lives_in San Pedro , was subpoenaed to testify last week about his allegations that his son , a 23-year-old factory_worker , met with three members of Colosio ' s security team -- who are now imprisoned as suspected plotters -- and other security agents in the months before the slaying . &quot; That certainly brings into question the theory that Mario acted alone , &quot; said Peter Schey , attorney for the Aburto family . The parents recently told The Times that their son had once applied to work as a state judicial police_officer , and said he complained in the days before the assassination that he was being followed . Besides talking with the family , it also appears likely that the new special prosecutor will attempt to retrace Aburto ' s steps_in Tijuana , where the murder occurred -- a task that did not appear to have been done thoroughly during the first probe . There are accounts that Aburto grew increasingly moody and withdrawn in the final weeks , that he was dressing better and other signs that he was coming_into money . Other new leads are expected from the panel of five legal_experts who are reviewing the original investigation ' s 284 interviews , 29 technical studies , 80 videotapes and 1 # 621 photographs . Some of the lingering questions the new prosecutor must answer are basic : The investigation has revealed that there was a far more extensive security_force from an array of government and private agencies than anyone suspected . However , investigators have offered little explanation for how a presidential candidate could be shot in the head at point-blank range_in the midst of nearly 70 security_guards . And she will be expected to sort through conflicting interpretations of existing evidence . For example , repeated viewings of the videotapes recording the murder have produced starkly different versions of what happened . Like Aburto ' s writings , the tapes were first submitted to a judge as evidence of a conspiracy that landed the three Colosio security agents in prison , accused of clearing a path in a crowd for the gunman . Later , the prosecutor dismissed the tapes as inconclusive and cited the writings as proof that Aburto acted alone . Islas ' role is crucial , because investigators ' failure so far to answer the public ' s questions has raised the specter of a dark force behind the killing that overshadows next month ' s presidential election and casts suspicion on every decision made in the Byzantine world of Mexican politics . Officials at the highest levels of government are rumored to be disturbed by fears that the slaying may have been directed by a disenchanted faction of the ruling elite . Much of the controversy surrounds Aburto himself : his treatment by the Mexican justice system , his writings and statements about mysterious political activities with influential people , and what some describe as changing and secretive behavior in the weeks before the slaying . In confessions and news interviews , Aburto has declared that he only meant to wound the candidate and denied that the other accused suspects were involved -- although witnesses say he hinted in his first confession that he had confederates . Moreover , family and acquaintances say Aburto talked repeatedly about attending political meetings -- reportedly boasting that he was paid to do so -- and alluded to a mysterious political &quot; project. &quot; His address book contained the address and phone_number of an elderly Tijuana leader of a faction of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , known as PRI , and information about when the group met . Investigators did not interview that political_leader , Blas Manrique , until three months after the assassination -- and have not explained the entry in the address book . When legislators asked former special prosecutor Miguel Montes Garcia last month whether he had spoken with all_the people listed in Aburto ' s address book , he told them the investigation was continuing . Manrique told The Times in an interview that he never met Aburto , but suggested the young_man may have been a government informer . &quot; Maybe he was working for the police , &quot; Manrique said . That speculation is echoed by others , who suggest that the ambitious young laborer fits the classic profile of a domestic political spy used to infiltrate opposition groups , operatives known in Mexico as orejas , ears . According to a scenario described by one Baja California government official , who asked not to be named , Aburto could have been recruited into an assassination plot after being cultivated as an informer . Theorists further cite the allegations by family members that Aburto was friendly with an Interior Ministry agent , Jorge Antonio Sanchez Ortega , who was present at Colosio ' s murder . He was investigated because his hands tested positive for having fired a gun and his shirt was stained with blood . Although Sanchez Ortega was cleared , his actions at the fateful campaign rally may well be reviewed as part of the renewed inquiry . Montes told the members of Congress that his questioning of Aburto had been limited because when he took_over the case on March 28 , the suspect had already been turned_over to the court system . At that point , all questioning must be done_in public hearings . Meanwhile , Aburto ' s family has complained that he is being held practically incommunicado . Schey said he has been assured that under Mexican law , Aburto has the right to choose his own attorney . However , the family ' s requests for him to see a lawyer , doctor or even them have been met with a wall of bureaucratic resistance . The prosecutor referred them to the judge , who referred them to the prison authorities , who have not responded to calls or faxes , Schey said . &quot; They don ' t want independent lawyers to visit him , they don ' t want family members to talk with him , they don ' t want doctors to examine him , &quot; Schey concluded .</TEXT>
