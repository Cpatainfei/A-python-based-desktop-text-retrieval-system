   <HEADLINE> PAPER PIERCES NOBEL SECRECY , SAYS RABIN , ARAFAT TO GET PRIZE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The traditional secrecy around the Nobel Peace Prize was torn Tuesday , just days before the award announcement , when a newspaper reported a bitter dispute over the choice of Yasser Arafat as co-winner . The Oslo newspaper Aftenposten reported that the PLO chairman and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin would be announced as winners Friday . And the newspaper said a committee_member , Kaare Kristiansen , who has labeled Arafat a terrorist , would resign if the Palestinian leader shares the $ 933 # 000 prize . Rabin and Arafat have been mentioned for months as likely winners for the historic treaty they signed last year . But the bald disclosure of the names and glimpses at behind-the-scenes bickering were rare . There have been leaks in past years to Norwegian media , but the news wasn ' t reported with such certainty . Kristiansen and others involved in this year ' s Peace Prize refused to confirm or deny the newspaper ' s report , though one source who refused to be identified told Reuters news service that it was accurate . According to the newspaper , the award committee still had time to meet and change its mind , although the paper said that appeared unlikely . Kristiansen is a former Christian Democratic politician and a longtime friend of Israel . Asked whether his reputation for disliking Arafat was correct , Kristiansen said : &quot; that ' s right. &quot;</TEXT>
