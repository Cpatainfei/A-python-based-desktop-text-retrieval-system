   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / JULIE CART ; MILUTINOVIC FACES TOUGH TASK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> World Cup decisions that once appeared clear cut for U.S. national team Coach Bora Milutinovic have clouded of late , what with injuries and tight championship races in various European leagues . Milutinovic has 35 players on his roster , the majority of them at the Mission Viejo training facility and about a dozen playing overseas . In the case of U.S. players in the_English first division , good news for their clubs is bad news for Milutinovic . For example , midfielder John Harkes plays for Derby County , which is in contention for a spot in the playoffs that could earn it a promotion to the Premier League . Same goes_for Tab Ramos with Real Betis in the Spanish second division . What this means to Milutinovic is that he may_not get some of his key offensive players back until the end of May , less than three weeks before the World Cup begins . Then there is the rash of injuries U.S. players have suffered lately . Roy Wegerle , who plays for Coventry City in the Premier League , has suffered the most recent and potentially devastating injury . Last week , Wegerle had surgery on his right knee , for the second time since January . He is not expected to return to the team before the end of the season , the first week in May . The U.S. team ' s general_manager , Bill Nuttall , said last week that the team would like Wegerle to return to Mission Viejo for rehabilitation , as he did after the first surgery in January . But , Nuttall conceded , Coventry is unlikely to release its highest-paid player to rejoin his national team , even if he is injured . Other injured players are recovering , just in time . Harkes missed 10 games with an ankle injury and is now playing again , as is Ramos , after missing three weeks with a calf injury . Cle Kooiman ' s knee injury seems to have gotten better , but he is not yet back in the lineup . Milutinovic will have all this to consider when he cuts his roster to the final 22 on June 3 . * The meeting that had been scheduled last week between World Cup Organizing Committee and Internal Revenue Service officials has been reset , after the IRS determined that its Los Angeles office , not its Washington , D.C. office , should handle the examination of WCOC ' s 1991 and 1992 tax_returns . The WCOC had asked the IRS for a ruling after some members of the World Cup board of directors grew concerned about the amount_of_money flowing_from World Cup coffers to the accounts of Major_League Soccer , the proposed new professional soccer league . Because the WCOC is a nonprofit entity , they reasoned , it might be construed as improper to transfer money to a for-profit venture . At least one tax attorney has called the practice &quot; risky , at best. &quot; The WCOC ' s tax-exempt status may be at risk if the IRS determines the as-yet undefined gifts or loans were outside tax guidelines . Another cause for concern , board_members say , is the appearance the payments of more_than $ 3.5 million leave : WCOC president Alan Rothenberg also heads the proposed professional league . * And Now The News : Item : The European soccer authority , UEFA , last week endorsed FIFA President Joao Havelange ' s bid for reelection . Comment : Let ' s see , how was that done ? Havelange already had courted the African confederation in 1990 by awarding it a much deserved third place in the World Cup_finals . He ' d already increased the field from 16 teams to 24 in 1982 , adding slots to Asia , Africa and CONCACAF . After a flurry of deal-cutting , Havelange has spent just about all_of his political capital to buy his support . Now , there are two separate but parallel realities : Both the Asian and CONCACAF regions believe they will gain another place in the 1998 finals , presumably coming from Europe ' s 13 slots , and UEFA President Lennart Johanssen told the Associated Press last week that , &quot; We have guarantees that no ( World Cup ) places will be taken_away from Europe &quot; and that some might even be added . Now that Havelange has promised so_much to so many , just where are all those World Cup places coming from ? Hint : Reports surfaced last week of Havelange ' s wish to expand the World Cup tournament to 32 teams . Wonder if there ' s any connection ? Item : The English Football Assn . last week backed_out of the match against Germany in Berlin that had come_to be known as the ' Hitler ' s Birthday Game , ' citing fears that German neo-Fascists and English hooligans would disrupt the game . Comment : Why did_it take so_long to figure this one out ? And who did the Germans think they were kidding when they maintained that Hitler ' s birthday , April 20 , carried no symbolism . Isn ' t there another day available for what could have been an exciting match , absent the political overtones ? Soccer Notes Major_League Soccer , the proposed first division professional league , has cleared a major hurdle on its way to legitimacy : it has a television contract . The three-year agreement calls_for 35 regular-season and playoff_games to be televised on ESPN and ESPN2 and the championship game on ABC . . . . Single-game World Cup tickets are expected to go_on sale May 1 . These tickets are among those returned by sponsors and other national federations . . . . The World Cup Legacy Tour has officially started . Thirty skills events for children will be held_in each of the nine venue cities . The winners of those events will participate in Soccer Celebration at the Santa Monica Pier , April 22 and 23 . For registration information , contact the World Cup office in Century City . . . . World Cup ' s mural program is in_progress on underpasses and walls near freeways throughout the city . Five murals are expected to be completed . . . . Tourism officials in Chicago and Dallas report World Cup hotel reservations are running well below expectations . In Chicago , half the 10 # 000 rooms set_aside for World Cup-related tourism were unreserved . A venue spokesman in Chicago said the failure of France , England and Japan to qualify has reduced the expected number of visitors .</TEXT>
