   <HEADLINE> LEADER OF MORMONS REAFFIRMS PRIMACY OF CHURCH TEACHINGS ; INTERVIEW : AFTER BEING CHOSEN PRESIDENT AND PROPHET IN JUNE , HOWARD W . HUNTER REACHED_OUT TO DISAFFECTED MEMBERS . BUT HE STILL UPHOLDS AUTHORITY OF THE HIERARCHY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If one thing has characterized the tenure of Howard W . Hunter as the new president and prophet of the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints , it has been his call to disaffected Mormons to return to the church . &quot; To those who have transgressed or offended , we say come_back ! To those who are hurt and struggling and afraid , we say let us stand with you and dry your tears , &quot; Hunter said in June after he was elected to the top post of the 8.8-million-member church . Hunter , 86 , is believed by Mormons to be God ' s living prophet on Earth , just as Moses was during biblical times . For this reason , those who seek reforms within the church -- including the admission of women to the Mormon priesthood and greater freedom to question the doctrines of the church -- were cautiously optimistic when Hunter struck_a_chord of reconciliation . In the last several years leading_up to Hunter ' s election , at least seven Mormons were excommunicated for publicly challenging church teaching . in his first major interview since his election , Hunter , mild-mannered and gentle , was nonetheless unbending in reaffirming the primacy of the church ' s teachings over individual conscience , the authority of the hierarchy and the appropriateness of ecclesiastical sanctions against those who cross the line . Hunter spoke_to Times Religion Writer Larry B . Stammer this week during a trip to Pasadena to meet with area Mormons . Following are excerpts from that interview : Question : You beckoned those who have set themselves apart from the church to return home . How do you think this theme of reconciliation is being received by your flock ? Hunter : My observation is it ' s been received wholeheartedly . Q : Are you concerned , as some_other church people are , about an erosion of moral purpose and of hierarchical authority ? A lot of Catholics , for example , say they do not agree with this or that policy that comes from the Vatican . Hunter : We have concern , yes . We have concern . . . that morals are being eroded among young people , particularly . We teach the principle that these things are wrong . Now when it comes_to the_matter of taking them up in the church , we do not have a split of opinion among the membership . We ' re united . The membership of the church . . . sustains and follows the teachings of those in authority . Q : Is there any concern that you need to very clearly draw_a_line now to avoid the controversy and disagreement that you might see in the Roman_Catholic_Church ? Is it important to nip it in the bud ? Hunter : Yes . We follow it ( dissent ) carefully in the church . We attempt to set_aside ( differences ) and be united entirely on matters which have been considered by the authorities of the church . Q : As you know , some Catholic theologians have been barred from teaching in Catholic universities by the Pope because they departed from Catholic orthodoxy . ( Mormons have imposed similar restrictions on Mormon theologians. ) Where does academic_freedom and freedom of inquiry cross the line into apostasy and how difficult is it to draw that line ? Hunter : that ' s a concern that ' s talked_about within the leadership of the church . Now there are many who think they don ' t have academic_freedom . In some sense that requires a definition of academic_freedom . But where there is an outspoken opposition to that which has been announced by the church ' s policy , we take action on it . We think that is a matter which should be handled by a council . . . that handles judicial matters , that they ( theologians or others ) be in conformity with the teachings of the church . If they ' re not they ' ll be subject_to disciplinary action -- and usually are . Q : There have been occasions in the past when some churches have recanted certain teachings . Galileo comes_to_mind -- when the Roman_Catholic_Church hundreds of years later said it was wrong in punishing Galileo for saying the earth revolved_around the sun . Is it possible in light of continuing revelation that the Mormon_Church may change its opposition to women in the priesthood ? Hunter : At the present_time there isn ' t an avenue of ever changing . It ' s too well defined by revelation , by Scripture . And we follow strictly the scriptural passageway in matters of that kind . I see nothing that will lead to a change_of_direction at the present_time -- or in the future . Q : As prophet and seer of the church , do you see yourself as speaking infallibly ? And how would you define infallible ? Hunter : that ' s an interesting question . I ' ll answer the first part . I would not presume_to hold myself ( personally ) as infallible , except on matters that are clearly defined by Scripture and by revelations . When ( infallible ) things are defined , we feel that the answer is scriptural and scripturally placed . Then , we take a strong stand . As far as infallibility is concerned , the officers of the church and the Council of the Twelve will support the First Presidency ( Hunter and two of his counselors ) without question or difference_of_opinion . There would be one opinion . . . . There ' s a powerful unity in the leadership of the church that is followed without deviation by the membership . Q : How do you approach your tenure as president and prophet in_view of your age and the condition of your health . Are you concerned ? Hunter : Yes , I ' m concerned . Yet there is the longstanding chain of events that lead_up to calling the person who is selected . They take the apostle who is the oldest in terms of tenure or seniority . And it ' s been that way . Q : To what do you attribute the growth of your church ? Hunter : I think it ' s the interest that is generated by the membership of the church , largely . Of course , we have an aggressive missionary program . Missionaries , largely young people between the ages of 19 and 21 . . . go_on missions for the church and give their time for a two-year period . that ' s a great factor ( in church growth ) . Our young people consider ( missions ) an obligation that they have in their education . Some can hardly wait for the day and time_to_come around so they can go . Other churches have a system whereby they pay expenses and some pay the salaries of missionaries . We don ' t do either . . . . ( Mormon missionaries ) go because they want to go and consider it a privilege . And so we interview very carefully with_respect_to morals , in particular . . . . We have these clean , young people who respond morally . They have to live a good life to be called to go . Q : I understand that a young Mormon may be barred from missionary_work if he or she has had even one sexual indiscretion . Previously , one indiscretion would result in a one-year delay . Why the tightened standard ? Hunter : I don ' t know if I can give you a reason for that . . . . But we find that in_order to combat the violation of moral codes , we have to take a strong stand . Q : The Mormon_Church has long been known and respected for its emphasis on the family as the basic building_block of society . Now you seem to be placing even more emphasis on it . Hunter : We ' ve placed great emphasis on that in recent years because we believe it ' s basic . Society ' s been changed and for those who give a listening ear in trying to hold_the_line on morals etc. , it ' s caused them to ( take a ) deeper stand and a more urgent stand concerning this . . . . Basically , there is the_matter of righteousness and unrighteous conduct . The two can ' t be reconciled unless heed is given to that which is right . . . . that ' s why we have given attention as we do to the family .</TEXT>
