   <HEADLINE> DEALING WITH THE COYOTE PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Just how does Bruce Bialosky ( Valley Commentary , Dec . 26 ) suggest coyotes be trapped ? Much research by the professionals has already been done on trapping . Padded leg hold traps ? I think not ! They are cruel and do not discriminate between coyotes , deer , bobcat , household pet cat , household pet dog or household child ! Shall we also eliminate raccoons and opossums , which have also assimilated beautifully to the pressure of the urban development , both north and south of Ventura Boulevard ? Homeowners with gardens would dearly love to rid them of rabbit and deer . Shall we trap them as well , or would the elimination of Bambi and Thumper make the issue unpopular and / or more cruel ? How about the homeowners with expensive Koi ponds ? Shall we kill_off the raccoons ? Yes , the coyotes were here first ! We , much later ! Therefore , it is our responsibility to protect our privately owned pets as well as our children ! The solution to this problem may be found in education and the subsequent application of what we have learned , not the eradication of a species . Cohabitation is most certainly possible . JUDI WILLIAMS Chatsworth * Thank_you for Bruce Bialosky ' s compassionate and comprehensive article . As he pointed_out , it is sad that a decision which has such a serious impact on public safety was made by both the Animal Regulation Commission and the City_Council based on the number of votes that were ( loudly ) represented within the powerful &quot; humane &quot; community , rather than on a common-sense approach . Unfortunately , the very knowledgeable and competent people who had effectively protected our communities until that time were portrayed as barbarians bent_on the destruction of these creatures . Nothing could be further from the truth . We have created an environment where , unfortunately , wildlife ( including our friend the coyote ) has lost its fear of humans . This is dangerous to both people and animals . Coyotes are extremely intelligent and have quickly learned that it is much easier to obtain &quot; fast food &quot; in someone ' s dumpster or yard ( including their domestic pets ) rather than running it down in the brush areas . Also , their traditional victims -- deer , rabbits , etc . -- have sensed the safety of being closer to the human community and draw their predators into our streets . We need a balanced approach to this problem , and it is no great mystery . The county responds to complaints regarding coyote invasion by setting traps and monitoring them . The mere presence of these threats to their freedom generally causes the coyote to retreat farther back into the wild lands . There are parallels between coyotes and domestic_dogs and cats . A larger food supply creates larger litters . We control this by spaying and neutering our personal pets . We have destroyed most of nature ' s methods of doing so with the coyote . We are all part of the &quot; humane community. &quot; We need to be humane to all living things . This can be done_by creating a balanced living environment with selective trapping to set_up parameters that will recondition the coyotes to return to a neutral field , naturally reduce breeding and safeguard pets and small children ( for many of us our pets are our children ) who also have a right_to_life .
