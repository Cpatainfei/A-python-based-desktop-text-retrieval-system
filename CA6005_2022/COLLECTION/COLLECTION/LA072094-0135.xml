   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL SUGGESTS SHARED CONTROL OF HOLY SITES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In hope of holding_on to this spot as its &quot; eternal and undivided capital , &quot; Israel is exploring establishment of an &quot; interfaith administration &quot; for the Old City and other holy_places , diplomats said Tuesday . This would give Christians and Muslims a share_in control of those parts of the 5 # 000-year-old city that are sacred to them -- and effectively remove the question of Jerusalem ' s future from the international agenda . So far , Israel has aroused the interest of the Vatican on the Christian side and of Jordan and Morocco on the Muslim , the diplomats said . Israel is talking through intermediaries with Saudi_Arabia because of its leading position in Islam . Jerusalem ' s future is &quot; closed politically but open religiously , &quot; Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres asserts these days , adding that he finds &quot; interesting &quot; the saying of King Hussein of Jordan that &quot; sovereignty of the holy_places belongs_to the Almighty in Heaven. &quot; Hussein ' s strong interest in Jerusalem , where his family has had the role of protector of Islamic shrines , could well make its future a major issue when he meets Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Monday in Washington . But Palestinians , who want East Jerusalem as capital of an independent Palestine , are alarmed at Israel ' s approach , fearing it will deprive them of one of their strongest arguments for a share of Jerusalem and scatter international allies they now have_on the issue . &quot; Why is Israel raising the Jerusalem issue , and in a pressing way , at this moment , although it was the party that insisted on postponing the discussion about it until the final-status talks ? &quot; the East Jerusalem newspaper Al Quds asked_in an editorial reflecting the mounting Palestinian concern . &quot; The object might be to close the ( topic ) of the city before the time for negotiations about it comes. &quot; Under the accord on Palestinian self-government signed_in September , Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization must open negotiations within two years on Jerusalem ' s future and other issues that must be resolved for final settlement of the Palestinian question . Although the other issues , including statehood , borders and Jewish settlers , will be very difficult , Jerusalem ' s fate has already emerged as the most emotional . PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in ringing tones and in virtually every speech promises Palestinians they again will be able to travel_to Jerusalem to pray at its Islamic and Christian shrines . And Israeli rightists opposed to the accord with the PLO use that image and the possible division of Jerusalem into two capitals , one Israeli and the other Palestinian , to bring tens of thousands of demonstrators to the city . The Israeli maneuver became dramatically clear when Israel extended an invitation to Hussein to visit Jerusalem and pray at Al Aqsa mosque , whose golden dome he had re-gilded this year ; the invitation was offered after Israel put_off requests by Arafat and senior PLO officials to make the same pilgrimage . &quot; Should ( Hussein ) come , he can expect a very nice reception as the head of a country that wants to make_peace with Israel and as one whose family traditionally and historically has been in_charge of maintaining the Islamic holy_places , &quot; Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said of the invitation to the king . The concept that Peres and other Israeli officials have been exploring , diplomats here said , would place the shrines and perhaps the whole of the walled Old City under an interfaith committee made_up of Christian , Jewish and Muslim representatives , removing the religious sites from all Israeli administration . &quot; The Israelis believe that , if they can get an agreement on ' Holy Jerusalem , ' then dealing with municipal Jerusalem will be easier , &quot; a senior Western diplomat said , assessing multiple off-the-record conversations he has recently had_on the subject . &quot; First , much of the emotion will be drained away , and all sides will be reassured about their shrines , &quot; the diplomat said . &quot; Secondly , the remaining Arab portions of Jerusalem might even be sliced_into another , adjacent municipality -- call it East Jerusalem , call it Al Quds as the Arabs do -- and that could become the Palestinian capital without dividing the present urban area. &quot; In suggesting an interfaith administration , Israelis have stressed that none of the religions would have primacy , diplomats said , and the question of sovereignty , a major issue not only for Israelis and Palestinians but for all Arabs , would be left open . They distinguish between this concept and past proposals to &quot; internationalize &quot; the city . The Israelis emphasize that full control of the holy_places -- particularly the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , the traditional burial place of Jesus , the Al Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock , from which the Prophet Mohammed is believed to have ascended to heaven -- would be with the Christians and Muslims respectively . Jewish representatives would be responsible_for the Western Wall , Judaism ' s holiest site as the remains of the ancient temple . As envisioned , Christian representatives would come from the denominations long active in Jerusalem , particularly Catholics , Greek and Russian Orthodox , Anglicans and Lutherans . The Muslim representatives would come from those countries -- Jordan , Morocco and Saudi_Arabia -- that have exercised custodianship over Islamic holy_places and from Palestinians . Jewish representatives would probably be Israeli but could include Jews from other countries . In a visit to Jordan this month , Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran , who serves as the Vatican ' s foreign_minister , urged that discussions about Jerusalem ' s future be brought_forward -- and not restricted to Israel and the PLO . &quot; Before territorial problems are solved , we have to find international guarantees to safeguard the uniqueness of the city . . . as assurance that , never again , one party would claim Jerusalem as their possession , &quot; Tauran said .</TEXT>
