   <HEADLINE> HYUNDAI GROUP ' S STEEL PLAN SPLITS NATION ; SOUTH_KOREA : PROPOSAL TO BUILD $ 10-BILLION MILL FUELS DEBATE OVER THE NEED FOR INDUSTRY COMPETITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> South_Korea ' s Hyun dai Group has a history of stirring_up public_opinion . In the 1992 presidential election , its founder , Chung Ju Yung , caused a political earthquake by mounting a highly charged campaign against the eventual winner , President Kim Young Sam . This time around , the nation ' s largest conglomerate is dividing the country with an ambitious plan to build South_Korea ' s second steel_mill at a cost of $ 10 billion . Some industrialists and analysts favor the plan , which is for an integrated steel_mill with annual production capacity of nearly 10 million tons . These people say South_Korea ' s fast economic_growth will require an equally fast increase in steel_production capacity . But others worry about a worldwide glut in supply by the time Hyundai ' s steel_mill is completed . More fundamentally , the debate centers_on whether competition is needed for the Korean steel_industry , currently monopolized by Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Co . ( POSCO ) . POSCO is the world ' s second-largest steel producer , after Japan ' s Nippon Steel Corp . The debate started a_few weeks ago , when speculation about the plan first spread . It became hotter this week , as most Seoul newspapers presented a detailed construction plan , quoting Hyundai executives and government officials . According to the reports , Hyundai will invest $ 10 billion to build three blast_furnaces with a capacity of 3.1 million tons each , possibly in the southeastern city of Pusan . Hyundai officials were quoted as saying the group ' s construction , engineering and heavy equipment subsidiaries will take 39 months to build the plant once they start . Park Il Kwon , a Hyundai Group spokesman , refused to confirm the reports but said the group ' s steel-product manufacturing subsidiaries , including Hyundai Pipe Co. , have carried_out some feasibility studies . These include long-term projections of Hyundai ' s own steel demands , he said . Analysts say Hyundai ' s steel needs for its car , shipbuilding , construction and electronics subsidiaries are estimated at 6 million tons a year , making_it feasible for the group to have its own steel_mill . &quot; It is no secret that we have hoped to have our own steel_mill ever since POSCO was created in the late 1960s , &quot; Park said . With annual capacity of about 21 million tons , POSCO is perhaps the world ' s most competitive steelmaker , because its plants are among the most advanced , analysts say . Aided by the strong yen , which makes Japanese steel more expensive in overseas markets , POSCO ' s earnings in 1993 rose 59 % over 1992 to $ 368 million , on revenue of $ 8.6 billion . To build its own steel_mill , Hyundai would have to overcome many hurdles . In theory , Hyundai doesn ' t need to get a green_light from the government for the project . But in practice , it would need approval to borrow foreign funds , select a mill site , import foreign technology and affect the environment . For that reason , it is reportedly working to woo public_opinion , which could influence government decision_making . It will get an important platform at a public seminar next week on ways to develop the nation ' s steel_industry . News_reports say Hyundai will strongly present its case at the seminar . It may have to . Signs from the government aren ' t favorable so far . Park Woon Suh , vice minister of trade , industry and energy , said last week he believes South_Korea needs facilities to process steel products , not make crude steel . The state-run Korea Institute for Economics and Technology , which often represents government views , recently said in a report that a new entry into crude steel_production isn ' t desirable . It said South_Korea ' s crude steel demand will be about 48.4 million tons in 2001 , only 1.5 million tons more_than supply at that time , an easy gap to fill with imports . The report said the current extra demand on Korean steelmakers , notably POSCO , will soon disappear as the yen stabilizes and world consumption falls . &quot; You cannot predict future demands based solely on the present situation , &quot; said Kim Joo Han , a key researcher for the report . &quot; There is a tendency to overestimate the competitiveness of Korean steel. &quot; Looking_at the bigger picture makes the concerns of Kim and other critics of the plan more understandable . Many Asian_countries , including China , Taiwan , Thailand and Indonesia , are racing to expand their steel_production capacity , risking a glut in the region in a_few years . The Chinese government wants to expand its national annual crude steel output to 100 million tons by 2000 . China Steel Corp . of Taiwan plans to boost its annual capacity by 30 % to 8 million tons by 1997 . If the Korean government has an institute to publicize its policy of preventing reckless steel capacity expansion , the Hyundai Group has its own mouthpiece . The Korea Economic Research Institute , under the Federation of Korean Industries , which represents most major corporations here , recently put_out a report defending Hyundai ' s position . The institute ' s analysts say Korea ' s steel demands in 2000 will reach 50 million tons , at least 10 million tons above production capacity at that time . And they call their forecast rather conservative , given the fast growth of Korea ' s auto , shipbuilding and electronics_industries and the prospects of inter-Korean economic cooperation . That would require vast amounts of steel for building North_Korean infrastructure . &quot; Steel is too important for the Korean economy to have a short supply of it , &quot; said Kwak Man Soon , a researcher at the institute . It is particularly important for Hyundai to have a stable supply of steel , which is essential for the group ' s main businesses , such_as autos , shipbuilding , construction and electronics , he said . Analysts add that a new entry by a private company into the monopolistic steel_industry would stimulate the management of POSCO , which hasn ' t had any competition in the domestic market since its inception in 1968 . Founded and long headed by Park Tae Joon , a former general and close friend of former President Park Chung Hee , POSCO has recently come under_fire for its allegedly slow and authoritarian management style . Indeed , there has been persistent speculation that the government wants to break POSCO up into two companies , one in Pohang and the other in the southwestern city of Kwangyang , where its new plants are , to stimulate its management . In response , POSCO has recently tried to reduce its dependency on steel and branch_out into higher-value-added , high-tech areas such_as telecommunications . POSCO will be the leading company in a business consortium that will provide the nation ' s second mobile phone_service , beginning later this decade .</TEXT>
