   <HEADLINE> SUNDANCE ' S GROWING PAINS ; MOVIES : AS THE UTAH FESTIVAL GETS MORE POPULAR , IT IS STRUGGLING TO FIND THE PROPER BALANCE OF INDEPENDENT FILMMAKERS AND INDUSTRY DEAL-MAKERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every year , as more and more people try to squeeze into it , the Sundance Film Festival becomes increasingly reminiscent_of that tiny automobile that held an infinite number of circus clowns . This year , though , the festival is threatening to do what that little car never did , and that is burst at the seams . Opening tonight with a Salt_Lake_City screening of the Mike Newell-directed &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; and continuing through Jan . 30 in nearby Park City , this vibrant showcase for the best of American independent film has been selling tickets at a rate that staggers even its organizers . Selling_out this year for the first time ever are all four categories of Park City passes , and this despite the full-time use of a 500-seat auxiliary theater ( the festival ' s biggest ) at the Library Center that added 22 # 000 seats to the number available . &quot; The demand has far outstripped the supply , &quot; says weary festival director Geoffrey Gilmore , who noted as well that when tickets for local residents went_on sale at Salt_Lake_City , the line was three-hours-plus in_length . &quot; We ' ve reached the point where it ' s gotten_to be more_than painful. &quot; Not only painful , but also tricky for the festival to maintain its feisty , free-spirited reputation , to preserve a balance between such potentially conflicting constituencies as struggling independent filmmakers and the deal-hungry denizens of Hollywood who traditionally come_along for the ride . Certainly no concession to box-office viability is noticeable in the 32 films ( 16 dramatic , 16 documentary ) competing for the festival ' s various juried prizes . Frequently first or second films by largely unknown directors , as a group the competitors have a tone that Gilmore characterized as &quot; unconventional and experimental. &quot; Only two , &quot; Fresh , &quot; written and directed by Boaz Yakin ( Miramax ) and the black-and-white &quot; Suture &quot; ( Goldwyn ) have distribution deals in place . Where the festival ' s increasing popularity is reflected , however , is in the films that have elected to have their world_premieres at Park City in out-of-competition slots . Not only do no fewer than nine of these films have distributors , but four of them will also go_out with major studio labels attached , including the Winona Ryder-Ethan Hawke movie &quot; Reality Bites &quot; from Universal , &quot; Threesome &quot; from TriStar and the Coen Brothers ' &quot; The Hudsucker Proxy , &quot; starring as mainstream a personality as Paul Newman . That film does have a legitimate independent pedigree , the Coens ' &quot; Blood Simple &quot; having won an award at an earlier festival . Similarly credentialed is Matty Rich ' s &quot; The Inkwell , &quot; to be distributed by Disney . Rich , who turned heads at Sundance with his gritty &quot; Straight Out of Brooklyn , &quot; has set his latest and considerably softer film , &quot; The Inkwell , &quot; in new territory , the upwardly mobile African American enclave that vacations in Martha ' s Vineyard . Other notable films with distributors include the Eric Stoltz / Mary-Louise Parker starring romance &quot; Naked in New York &quot; and a pair of lively British films . &quot; Four Weddings , &quot; the opening_night film , is a stylish and witty lunatic farce about two people ( Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell ) who can ' t seem to decide if they ' re made_for each other or not , while &quot; Backbeat &quot; breezily relates the story of the Beatles . Perhaps the smartest film at the festival , showing out of competition because it premiered elsewhere and is Canadian in the bargain , is a singular work about quite a different kind of musician . &quot; Thirty-two Short Films About Glenn Gould &quot; deals with the eccentric classical pianist in a way that is both challenging and accessible , restless and subtle . Continually inventive in its ability to visualize music , this look_at an ironic perfectionist is close to perfection itself . Equally worthy , and also showing out of competition , are a pair of the remarkable Asian films that made a splash at Cannes , Tian Zhuangzhuang ' s moving and controversial &quot; The Blue Kite &quot; from China and Tran Anh Hung ' s elegantly beautiful &quot; The Scent of Green Papaya , &quot; the first Vietnamese film submitted for Oscar consideration . What attracts all these films to Sundance is a continuing increase in two of the festival ' s constituencies . One is the press , with more_than 200 film journalists worldwide set to show_up and outlets like Premiere magazine , which used to content itself with covering the festival once it ended , starting the race weeks ago . Also on the rise are the buzz people , the industryites who come_up_to get a jump_on the next new thing . This year , all for the first time , the venerable Directors Guild of America will be hosting an &quot; invitation-only party &quot; for young directors , cellular_phones will be available for rental and an Executive Business Center , complete with fax and a message center &quot; answered by real people , &quot; will set_up shop . All the comforts of home . Though slightly dazed by what it has wrought , the Sundance organizers are attempting to cope . In addition to that new theater , a new shuttle system is being inaugurated to move people more efficiently and the lively closing night awards ceremony has been moved to a larger location .</TEXT>
