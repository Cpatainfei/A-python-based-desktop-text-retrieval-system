   <HEADLINE> GATES HAS GRAND PLANS FOR MICROSOFT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you have a personal_computer , chances are that Bill Gates and Microsoft Corp . are already a part of your life . But the 38-year-old billionaire and the company he runs want a bigger part -- a much bigger part . Gates and Microsoft are not content simply to provide programs to run_on your PC . They want to send you movies and TV_shows . They want to help educate your children . They want to be your catalogue retailer . They want to be your global telephone supplier . They even want to help you out with your rotisserie baseball_league . Gates , in fact , appears to be engaged in a hugely ambitious quest to become the preeminent force in a broad range of new technologies , a kind of John D . Rockefeller of the information age . His company is cutting deals left and right . In the last week alone , Gates has orchestrated two major alliances . On Wednesday , Microsoft announced a venture with Japan ' s Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone , the world ' s second-largest telephone_company . And on Monday , Gates and cellular_telephone titan Craig McCaw unveiled a grandiose project that they hope will lead to a $ 9-billion worldwide satellite telephone_system . These grand plans carry plenty of risks . There are lots of examples of world-beating companies -- notably IBM and General Motors -- stumbling when they stray from their core business . And though Microsoft ' s position in the personal_computer software business appears unassailable , growth in that business is slowing . At the same time , there are many in the technology world and elsewhere who would like nothing more_than to see Gates -- whose $ 7 billion in personal wealth ranks him as the second-richest American -- fail . Competitors allege that Microsoft engages in a variety of anti-competitive business practices , and the Justice_Department is considering antitrust action against the company . Gates and Microsoft deny any wrongdoing . Critics and supporters alike agree that in pursuing new ventures , Gates may be spreading his bets in hopes that he will be in the right place at the right time when new technologies become commercially viable . &quot; My take_on this is Bill ' s trying to buy himself some time , &quot; said Terence J . Garnett , head of new media at Oracle Corp. , which is hoping to beat_out Microsoft for dominance in the computer software market . Clearly , though , no one can doubt the scope of Gates ' ambition . He is a great admirer of legendary capitalists like Henry_Ford -- a favorite book is Alfred E . Sloan ' s &quot; My Years at General Motors. &quot; He has already achieved a degree of celebrity reserved for a rare few in the business world . In the United States , only investor Warren Buffett has amassed greater personal wealth . There are those who joked wistfully that Gates ' recent marriage to Microsoft executive Melinda French would slow_down the aggressive entrepreneur . But that has not been the case . The Harvard_University dropout who scrapped and toiled to build his company into a global powerhouse seems as driven as ever . Now he wants to conquer new territory . Some say much of Gates ' success stems from a stroke of luck -- IBM ' s decision to use Microsoft software for the original IBM PC . And though it clearly took a lot more_than luck to build Microsoft into the giant it is today , it may be Gates ' success or failure in navigating the murky waters of multimedia computing and interactive technology that determines his place in history books . For the moment , Microsoft ' s size , strength and ambitions are generating fear among the growing ranks of companies that want to stake a claim to the new information age . Microsoft ' s ownership of the software that controls the basic functions of most personal_computers has yielded enormous profits . Just as important , it has given Microsoft a huge advantage in producing basic business programs , such_as spreadsheets and word_processors . So powerful has the company become that many of its rivals have concluded that they must join forces or die . That has led to a wave of mergers in recent months in the $ 7.3-billion-a-year computer software business . Combinations announced in the past few weeks alone include Wordperfect and Novell , Adobe and Aldus , and Electronic Arts and Broderbund . But the idiosyncratic Gates is especially enamored of the hot new field of multimedia and interactive communications . Microsoft recently launched a major push into entertainment and educational software for the home , much of it using flashy CD-ROM technology . that ' s only the beginning . Microsoft aims to provide a range of consumer information services for personal_computer users , the first of which will provide reams of baseball statistics for sports fanatics . An even bigger prize will be providing information and entertainment via the television_set . Microsoft has a deal with cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. to develop software for new interactive cable_systems , which will allow consumers to order movies or browse through electronic shopping_malls with their television remote_controls . And to have all its bases covered , Microsoft is also moving aggressively in the telephone world . The company confirmed this week that it has tried to negotiate a broad cooperation agreement with AT &amp; T , though the negotiations came_to naught . With Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone , though , it was more successful . The two companies announced a plan to use NTT networks for software distribution , and steps to ensure that an advanced NTT facsimile service will be compatible with a new generation of office-equipment software called Microsoft At Work . And then there was the announcement this week that Gates was joining with McCaw to build a $ 9-billion global satellite telephone_system -- a venture that many in the communications business believe will never get_off_the_ground . These efforts have stirred both anger and admiration in the business . Many rivals grumble that Microsoft is deliberately sowing confusion by announcing a lot of alliances that won ' t result in products for years : Just the knowledge that Microsoft is pursuing a certain type of venture is often enough to scare competitors away . But others believe that Microsoft has an important role to play in building the infrastructure for interactive_multimedia . When it ventures into the realm of cable_television and telephones , moreover , it is at least picking on players who have their own designs on information age leadership , such_as AT &amp; T , the regional Bell telephone_companies and cable industry giant Tele-Communications Inc. and its very aggressive chairman , John C . Malone . And Microsoft ' s record in deal-making is hardly unblemished : An effort to establish interactive TV software standards through a consortium with Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner fell_through . &quot; One of the biggest challenges for companies like Wordperfect and Lotus and Microsoft is that the 1980s are over , &quot; said Ann Winblad , a Silicon_Valley venture_capitalist . &quot; Bill has to adopt the mind-set of a venture_capitalist . He has to take more risks. &quot; Microsoft has been criticized for not taking enough risks in the past , letting other firms dominate in growing areas such_as databases and networking . Gates and his company are determined not to make that mistake again . Times staff writer David Holley in Tokyo contributed to this story . * RELATED STORY : D1</TEXT>
