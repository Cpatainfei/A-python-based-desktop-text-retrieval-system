   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION ; CLEARING_UP THE MYTHS AND MISPERCEPTIONS ; ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE A SERIOUS CALIFORNIA PROBLEM THAT NEEDS ADDRESSING , BUT NOT WITH NATIONAL ' REFORMS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over the past two years , immigration has been transformed into a wedge issue , one that , like crime , race and abortion , taps into popular passions and defines essential political values . This transformation has moved the debate beyond the Beltway and the elites that once dominated it to a far larger political and public audience . But the opinions of these larger audiences are being shaped by impressions , emotions and flawed studies and not by hard facts . As a result , reforms are being proposed that address perceptions rather than reality . What are some of the basic facts that should guide our thinking and policy on this issue ? The policy context . Immigration policy needs to be viewed not as one but three separate policies : the admission of legal immigrants on family- and work-related grounds ; humanitarian admissions , principally refugees and asylees , and the control of illegal immigration through border and workplace enforcement . The distinction is important because the focus_on our failure to control illegal immigration has led many to view immigration as_a_whole in a negative light . As a result , the strengths of our legal and humanitarian admissions policies have been obscured and the standards we should use to evaluate them have been lost . The immigrant population . We need to be clear about the characteristics of current immigration flows . The most commonly noted is their scale : More immigrants entered the United States in the 1980s ( 10 million ) than during any decade in our history . Less frequently noticed is that the share of the population that is foreign-born ( 8 % ) is one-half what it was at the turn_of_the_century ( 15 % ) . In addition to their scale , what is striking about current flows is their concentration and pace : A mere six states are home to 75 % of all immigrants ; 93 % live_in urban_areas . In terms of pace , almost half of the immigrant population was not here 10 years ago . The apparent failure of many immigrants to integrate rapidly -- to speak English well , for example -- has more to do with their recent arrival than their abilities or separatist inclinations . Contrary to popular belief , most immigrants are here with the nation ' s express consent . Of the 19.7 million foreign-born counted by the 1990 Census , more_than half were legal permanent residents , one-third were naturalized citizens and roughly 13 % were here illegally . Illegal immigration . The nature and scale of illegal immigration are broadly misunderstood . The flow is , for the most part , circular , with most leaving soon after arrival . Thus , the most useful measure is the number of illegal immigrants who enter and stay , or about 200 # 000 to 300 # 000 per year , not the 1.5 million apprehensions of illegal immigrants that take_place along the southern border . Thus , in an annual immigration flow of 1.1 million , illegal immigrants represent about one-quarter , not the 75 % that public_opinion_polls report that many Americans believe . Less than half of the country ' s illegal immigrants cross the southern border clandestinely ; most enter legally and overstay their visas and most ( two-thirds ) are not Mexican . That said , almost half of the nation ' s 3.5 million illegal immigrants live_in California , one-quarter of them in Los Angeles County . This means that California ' s immigrants are more likely to be poor and illegal than is the case for the country as_a_whole . Immigrant &quot; quality. &quot; A perception that the new immigrants , who are preponderantly from poor Latin_American and Asian_countries , are less educated than their European predecessors has led to complaints about the declining quality of recent immigrants and to calls_for reduced immigration . How accurate are these perceptions , and does a policy shift toward restriction make_sense ? The key here is to distinguish among immigrants on the basis of whether they enter as legal immigrants , refugees or illegals . Legal immigrants generally have high education levels and are substantially more likely to have a college degree than native-born Americans . But the education levels of refugees and illegal immigrants fall below those of natives . Another measure of &quot; quality &quot; that is often used is income . The average incomes of both legal immigrant and refugee households that entered the United States before 1980 are higher than those of natives . The poverty rate for these groups is no higher than for natives . As for legal immigrants and refugees arriving after 1980 , a larger share is poor ( 23 % versus 12 % for natives ) . It is frequently claimed that immigrants are more likely to be_on welfare than are natives . In an absolute sense , this is true : The census indicates that 4.7 % of immigrants are_on welfare , versus 4.2 % of natives . But welfare use among immigrants is highly concentrated among two vulnerable populations : refugees , who usually arrive without family or job networks and require immediate assistance , and the elderly , who receive SSI because they have not worked here long enough to qualify for Social_Security . Working-age immigrants are substantially less likely to use welfare than are natives ( 3.7 % versus 3.2 % ) , and recently arrived working-age immigrants are even less likely to use welfare . Welfare use among illegal immigrants is so low as_to be undetectable , primarily because they are barred from virtually all benefit programs . What do these facts mean for policy ? First , fix only what is broken . Legal immigrants appear to be doing_well . Illegal immigration needs to be stopped not just at the border , but also by addressing the problem of visa overstayers . And , while California ' s immigration troubles are important to the nation , they are unique and should not dictate the nation ' s policy . Finally , because welfare use among immigrants is concentrated among two vulnerable , legally admitted populations , curbing immigrant access to public benefits may yield lower savings than many admit and will have a negligible impact on illegal immigration . The Legal Majority Legal status of the foreign-born population in 1990 : Permanent residents ( 45 % ) : 8.8 million Naturalized citizens ( 33 % ) Undocumented alien ( 13 % ) Refugees and Asylees ( 6 % ) Other legal ( 4 % ) Note : Numbers do not add_up to 100 % because of rounding .
