   <HEADLINE> AFTER ATTACKS , CHRISTIANS FEEL THREATENED IN PAKISTAN ; ASIA : LEADERS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITY DENOUNCE GOVERNMENT IN MUSLIM NATION FOR FAILING TO REPEAL BLASPHEMY LAW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pakistan ' s small Christian minority has been plunged into fear and uncertainty by the shooting ambush of three members charged with defaming Islam and by the government ' s reluctance to repeal a law punishing anti-Muslim blasphemy with death . &quot; The Christians are afraid . There ' s a great sense of insecurity , &quot; Bishop Samuel Azariah of the United Church of Pakistan said in a weekend telephone_interview . Last week , Azariah and fellow Protestant and Roman_Catholic prelates led thousands of Christians on a march through Lahore to demand that the government of Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto nullify a law mandating capital_punishment for anyone &quot; who defiles the sacred name of the holy prophet Mohammed. &quot; In the port city of Karachi , a similar demonstration staged by an estimated 3 # 000 Christians was tear-gassed by police . &quot; As long as the government doesn ' t react , there will be other protests , &quot; Azariah said . &quot; Christians are afraid , but they also want to register their protest and their concern. &quot; Leaders of Pakistan ' s Christians , who estimate their flock at about 3 million of Pakistan ' s 125 million people , say the anti-blasphemy law in the officially Muslim country is being used to persecute Christians or settle personal scores . If the government does not take action by Saturday , Christians will stage hunger_strikes , work_stoppages or other protests , said Azariah , whose church represents an amalgamation of Protestant_denominations including Anglicans , Methodists and Scottish Presbyterians . The concerns arose April 5 , when gunmen attacked three Christians , accused of scrawling anti-Muslim slogans on mosque walls , as they left a Lahore court . Manzoor Masih , 40 , was killed . One co-defendant was shot half_a_dozen times in the stomach but is in no danger because no vital_organs were struck , Azariah said . The third , an illiterate boy of 13 , was shot in the wrist and hand . From Bhutto on down , Pakistani authorities have kept mute about the attack , Azariah charged . &quot; No official condemnation has been stated at either the national or the provincial level , &quot; the bishop said . &quot; Neither Mrs . Bhutto , nor the president nor the ( provincial ) chief minister has condemned the act , and that disturbs us further. &quot; When no arrests followed the ambush , which took_place in broad daylight before witnesses , Azariah said the Christians decided to stage the marches . The death_penalty for blasphemy , made mandatory in 1991 under Pakistan ' s previous government , has never been applied , although Azariah said there have been at least three cases in which those accused of the crime were killed or died in suspicious circumstances . One victim , a Christian schoolteacher , was stabbed to death after a rumor spread that he had spoken an insulting word against Mohammed . Bhutto espouses a tolerant and liberal interpretation of Islam . Before coming_to power in October , she talked_about doing_away_with legislation that enacts Muslim religious norms into law . In Islamabad , there have been rumors of impending changes in the blasphemy law , including an amendment ordering 10 years ' imprisonment for anyone making false accusations and a softer penalty for people who may have insulted Islam ' s founder unintentionally . But in a country whose very reason for creation was the Muslim faith and where Christians are legally deemed a separate electorate , the issue is politically dangerous . Journalist Khaled Ahmed , who has followed the controversy for the Pakistani publication Friday Times , believes Bhutto has gotten cold feet . &quot; There is a deep cleavage in Pakistan , &quot; he said . &quot; The opposition will probably join up with the ( Muslim ) clergy on this . The government is scared . They now say they will not amend the law. &quot; Last week , as the Christians prepared_for their marches , the provincial assembly in Lahore unanimously passed a resolution calling_on the national government to preserve the death_penalty for blasphemy . A recent decision by the Lahore high_court may signal more trouble for Pakistan ' s Christians , Ahmed said . It ruled that the anti-blasphemy law in fact embraces all prophets , not just Mohammed . That could mean prosecuting people as blasphemers if they spread the Old_Testament stories that David was an adulterer or Noah a drunkard . &quot; We fear there may be more litigation against the Christian community , &quot; Ahmed said . In a sign of solidarity with the Christian minority , representatives of secular organizations , including the Pakistani Human_Rights Commission , the Women ' s Action Forum , War Against Rape and the Committee for Justice and Peace , took_part in the funeral procession for Masih . Azariah also said authorities in Lahore seemed to be taking steps to limit interfaith tensions . Muslim activists planned a demonstration today , but a ban was published Saturday on the display of posters and banners at the site , he said .</TEXT>
