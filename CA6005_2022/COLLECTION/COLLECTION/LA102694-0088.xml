   <TEXT> When &quot; Frankenstein &quot; opens on Halloween night at the Odyssey Theatre in West L.A. , it ' ll provide chills and thrills , promises director Debbie Devine . It will also dig a little deeper than that . The production , presented by the Glorious Repertory_Company , a new group composed of theater professionals , inaugurates &quot; Heart and Soul , &quot; a series of three plays that will &quot; celebrate the word , the visual and human interaction. &quot; The adult theater series was created with a purpose : to also be accessible to young people ages 10 and older . &quot; There is not enough theater about real-life human issues that is appropriate for adults to bring children to , &quot; Devine said . &quot; The work we do is not something where you ' re going to want to drop your kid off and pick him up after . It ' s really provocative material that you need to share and talk_about together , because it ' s complex stuff. &quot; &quot; Frankenstein , &quot; set_in 1845 Vienna , has a cast of 15 , including a Bob Baker marionette . Two actors play the monster ' s body and mind ; the latter being portrayed by Allan Hendrick , a former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company . Makeup was designed by Blake Shepard ( &quot; Star Trek : The Next Generation &quot; ) and multi-Emmy Award winner Tom Berman . Surprisingly , the play was chosen &quot; partly because of the L.A. riots , &quot; Devine said . Mary Shelley ' s &quot; book is really about a scientist who creates a monster and rejects him . And , out of that rejection and abandonment , the monster kills Victor Frankenstein ' s friends -- everything he loved . &quot; We believe if you don ' t nurture the individual and society , it ' s going_to . . . hurt you. &quot; In the play , the struggle of Vienna ' s underclass runs &quot; in tandem with what happens with the monster . All three of the plays in the series explore &quot; our community &quot; in one way or another , Devine noted . The second play will be a reprise of the Odyssey ' s 1993 holiday production of &quot; The Snow Maiden , &quot; about a Russian photographer ' s courageous search for her own humanity . It will be followed in the spring by a collaboration with Jose Cruz Gonzales from South Coast Repertory and members of his Latino Theatre Lab that looks_at the issue of immigration . Dates have not yet been set . Each play , Devine said , will appeal_to adults and to youths old enough to &quot; grasp moral ambiguity and in-depth characters and to reason through material. &quot; &quot; This is also a wonderful initiate experience to theater for adults , &quot; Devine said . It is &quot; highly theatrical , fast-paced and visually engaging &quot; -- elements that are important in &quot; the struggle to get people in the door and show them that theater can be compelling and exciting . I want to make_sure they ' re both challenged and mesmerized by it. &quot; Although the Odyssey is known for very adult , often cutting-edge theater , the &quot; Heart and Soul &quot; series is part of a new effort , according to Ron Sossi , the Odyssey ' s artistic director . In addition to Devine ' s other theater_company , the Glorious Players , which presents plays for young children , a youth conservatory is in the planning stages and the theater is &quot; pursuing grants for arts in education &quot; programming . &quot; We have a kind of major move going_on , &quot; Sossi said . &quot; We ' re doing everything we can to encourage and develop a younger audience. &quot; * &quot; Frankenstein , &quot; Odyssey Theatre , 2055 S . Sepulveda Blvd. , West L.A. , Monday , 7:30 p.m. ; Saturday , 2 p.m. ; Sunday , 1 and 4 p.m. through Dec . 4 . $ 12.50 ; ( 310 ) 477-2055 .</TEXT>
