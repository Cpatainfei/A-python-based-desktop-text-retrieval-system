   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CROATIA RISKS CUTTING ITS OWN THROAT ; BALKANS : MILITARY INTERFERENCE IN BOSNIA OPENS_DOOR TO SANCTIONS AND COULD ENCOURAGE SERBIAN AGGRESSION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An ethnic carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina might fulfill nationalist dreams of a Greater Croatia , but opposition leaders , human_rights advocates and even some allies of President Franjo Tudjman are beginning to see the expansion drive as the greatest peril confronting the country . Partitioning Bosnia into three ethnic ministates would lead to a Greater Serbia on Croatia ' s border and maroon at least two-thirds of Bosnia ' s 750 # 000 Croats in resentful Serbian and Muslim enclaves . Zagreb ' s conscription of Croatian reservists to fight for territory in central Bosnia is also provoking threats of economic sanctions by the West , which has imposed punitive embargoes on Serbia for similar interference in the Bosnian crisis . Most dangerous , in the view of increasing numbers of Croats and U.N. observers , is the precedent of accommodating forced border changes that would be set by dividing Bosnia . That could cement rebel Serb control over occupied territory in Croatia . &quot; Morality and sentimentality aside , ( it ) would not be in Croatian national interests &quot; if Bosnia were to be divided , warned Ante Tripalo , head of the Soros Foundation ' s Open Society Fund and a leading member of the liberal Croatian People ' s Party . &quot; If you can change borders in Bosnia , it sets a precedent that allows Croatian borders to change too. &quot; Rebel Serbs conquered and occupied nearly one-third of Croatia in a six-month war in 1991 and have declared it the independent Republic of Serbian Krajina . More_than 14 # 000 U.N. peacekeeping troops were deployed to the occupied territory almost two years ago to await a breakthrough in paralyzed peace talks between Zagreb authorities and the Serbian rebels . But no sooner had the U.N. soldiers taken_up patrols than the Serb nationalist quest_for a Greater Serbia turned its attention to Bosnian territory . Rebels armed and instigated by Belgrade laid siege to Sarajevo and other cities , setting_in_motion a bloody cycle of attack and retaliation that now has all three Bosnian ethnic_groups -- Serbs , Croats and Muslims -- battling for territory on which to build segregated states . &quot; It has been clear since 1991 that Tudjman and ( Serbian President Slobodan ) Milosevic have a deal to divide Bosnia that does not take_into_account the Muslims , &quot; Tripalo said . &quot; The deal was to divide Bosnia in two . But what has happened when they have tried to divide into three is genocide among all three peoples. &quot; Tudjman and Milosevic met in early 1991 , before their own conflict , in what one senior Croatian government source confirmed was a session in which they discussed how they should divide Bosnia . The rival presidents have met several times since to mark_off borders in Bosnia , and last May they dispatched their Bosnian proxies , Serb nationalist Radovan Karadzic and his Croat counterpart , Mate Boban , to draw a map detailing a three-way carve-up at a secret meeting in Montenegro . The Karadzic-Boban formula has been used as a basis for partition talks in Geneva being mediated by Britain ' s Lord Owen and special U.N. envoy Thorvald Stoltenberg . But Bosnia ' s largest nationality , Muslim Slavs who made_up 44 % of the population before the war , have spurned their attackers ' plans for uneven partitioning ; they have lately been putting_up a fierce fight for the country ' s survival . Muslim-led government troops have taken village after village from their former allies , the Bosnian Croat forces that turned_on them more_than a year ago . Tudjman threatened in a New Year ' s Day speech to send more government troops to back Croats in Bosnia . Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic conceded in an interview that Bosnian Croats &quot; made some mistakes &quot; that led to collapse of the Muslim-Croat alliance , including the massacre of Muslim civilians in the central Bosnian villages of Ahmici and Stupni Do and the destruction of a historic 400-year-old stone bridge in the southern city of Mostar . In the face of mounting Bosnian Croat losses to poorly armed but determined Bosnian government troops , Granic said the Zagreb leadership has come_to regard repair of the Croat-Muslim alliance as the highest priority . &quot; The problem is that trust between the peoples is at a very , very low level , &quot; he said of Croats and Muslims , now engaged in a seemingly unstoppable bloodletting . While Granic seemed reluctant to openly criticize Tudjman or Gojko Susak -- the Bosnian-born , ardently nationalist Croatian defense minister -- others in the leadership have expressed concern that Croatian involvement in Bosnia is endangering the nation ' s future . &quot; I don ' t think it is in our interest to risk our image as a nation prepared to come_to a peaceful agreement by getting involved in open military intervention , &quot; parliamentary Speaker Stipe Mesic told the weekly Globus . Mesic pointed_out that partitioning Bosnia and letting Croatian and Serbian regions annex to their neighboring mother states would extend Serb rule along most of Croatia ' s border , making_it easier for Greater Serbia to supply rebels in Krajina . &quot; Croatia ' s major strategic interest is that no borders be changed , &quot; Mesic told the newspaper . Mario Nobilo , Croatia ' s U.N. ambassador , conceded that dividing Bosnia poses &quot; the risk of a precedent &quot; that could result in losing international support for Zagreb ' s campaign to recover Krajina . But , like most in the inner_circle of Tudjman ' s ruling Croatian Democratic Union , he appeared confident that Croatia can somehow annex part of Bosnia without sacrificing its own territorial integrity . Some officials of the U.N. Protection Force seeking to defuse the Balkan crisis contend that Tudjman ' s simultaneous push for expansion into Bosnia and recovery of lost land from the Serbs risks a showdown war between Zagreb and Belgrade that the Serbs would be likely to win . &quot; They could lead their country into an appalling disaster , &quot; one senior U.N. official said of Tudjman and a handful of Bosnian-born Croatian government_ministers pursuing annexation of the Herzegovina region . &quot; There is a very real danger that Croatia could crumble as a state within the next few years , if some of the current , very shortsighted policies are not changed. &quot; Zoran Pusic , head of the Defense of Human_Rights group and a prominent member of the opposition Social Democratic Union , has been documenting what he says are illegal actions by the Croatian leadership to send troops to back Bosnian Croats in the fight against the Muslim-led government . He and other human_rights monitors contend that at least 2 # 000 Croatian citizens have been called_up and dispatched to Bosnia in the last month . &quot; It is intolerable for an independent state to allow its citizens to be drafted by some_other army , &quot; Pusic said of the mobilizations . &quot; These people have been informed at the military camps they were taken_to that they were being drafted , not by the Croatian army , but by the HVO &quot; -- Bosnian Croat forces . Pusic said his groups aims to publicize government human_rights violations in hopes of deterring them : &quot; I can ' t explain -- I can ' t even understand -- such blindness on the part of the Croatian government in its policy toward Bosnia. &quot; He lamented the lack of logic in Boban ' s having turned_on Muslim allies , who outnumbered Bosnia ' s Croats more_than 2 to 1 . &quot; The government has stated repeatedly that it sought to protect the interests of Croats in Bosnia , but it actually endangered most of the Croatian people there &quot; by pushing for delineation of a Croatian ministate that is home to less than one-third of Bosnian Croats . The rest are scattered throughout the republic and might be pressured to migrate out of the Serbian and Muslim regions . &quot; Our government is still sensitive to international pressure , &quot; Pusic said , predicting that Tudjman may curtail support to the Bosnian Croats if Western leaders keep threatening sanctions . Mira Ljubic-Lorger , another opposition figure , insists that there is hope for democracy in Croatia and predicts an ouster of the Tudjman regime by the year ' s end .</TEXT>
