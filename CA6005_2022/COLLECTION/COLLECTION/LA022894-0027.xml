   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; NOVA GOES ' IN SEARCH OF HUMAN ORIGINS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Modern humans , people who looked pretty much like you and me and who probably behaved much the same way , have been around for about 100 # 000 years , most researchers agree . But our ancestors , primates who walked upright on the plains of Africa , who banded_together for shelter and warmth and who may have used the simplest tools -- like a twig to remove termites from a nest -- have been around much longer , at least 3.2 million years . That age is based on a 42-inch-tall fossilized skeleton found in a wasteland of bare rock and gravel in Ethiopia 20 years ago by a then-brash young anthropologist named Donald C . Johanson , who now heads the Institute for Human Origins in Berkeley . That skeleton , known as &quot; Lucy &quot; in honor of a Beatles song playing_on the researchers ' tape_deck when its identity was confirmed , is now arguably the most famous fossil in the world . The story of that discovery and its impact on our search for the essential nature of humanity is the centerpiece of the first episode of the three-part &quot; In Search of Human Origins , &quot; an entertaining and thought-provoking &quot; Nova &quot; miniseries that debuts on PBS tonight . The series is hosted and narrated by Johanson , who has the makings of a charismatic and knowledgeable PBS host on the lines of Carl Sagan and David Attenborough . ( All three installments are running back to back tonight , from 8 to 11 p.m. , on KCET-TV Channel 28 . KVCR-TV Channel 24 is showing them at 7 p.m. tonight , Tuesday and Wednesday . KPBS-TV Channel 15 is showing them Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 7:30 and 8:50 p.m. ) Scarcely bigger than an 8-year-old , hairy and virtually indistinguishable from other primates , Lucy had one key characteristic that marked the transition between animals and men : Her knee-joint was capable of locking her leg straight , allowing her to walk upright for long periods_of_time and providing the mobility and versatility that started her line on_the_road toward modern humans . Johanson frequently , and accurately , calls her the &quot; missing link &quot; between apes and humans , a term that is only now coming_back into repute after earlier and more laughable claims disgraced it . &quot; She is really the woman that shook_up man ' s family_tree , &quot; Johanson said recently . In Part I , Johanson and his team re-create both their moment of discovery and the rather sedate celebration that led to her name . An English &quot; movement artist , &quot; heavily made_up , portrays the last_days of Lucy in the then-lush wilderness , and a highly detailed audio-animatronic Lucy head demonstrates how she might have used a twig to capture termites from their mounds . Part II tells the story of how this frail creature and her brethren , many of whom were actually closer in size to modern humans , were able to survive on the Ethiopian battleground . Early man was not the ferocious hunter so often depicted in mythology , but rather a timid scavenger who made his living by stealing carcasses after more powerful carnivores were finished with them , settling for fruits and termites and the_like when nothing better came_to_hand . On Wednesday , the final chapter moves forward in time to look more closely at the development of culture , perhaps the defining characteristic of humanity . It focuses largely on the much-maligned Neanderthal , a brutish species once thought to be our forebears but now known to be a separate lineage that became extinct 30 # 000 years ago , perhaps because they could not compete with anatomically modern humans . Yet they shared many human traits . &quot; They ate the same foods , hunted the same way , buried their dead , built the same kinds of fireplaces , &quot; Johanson said . In many ways , he argues , Neanderthals were human . Being a modern human , he concludes , may be less about what we look_like and more about how we behave . THOMAS H . MAUGH II</TEXT>
