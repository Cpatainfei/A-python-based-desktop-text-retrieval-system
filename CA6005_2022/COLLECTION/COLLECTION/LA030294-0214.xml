   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; ' BELLE EPOQUE ' : A BEAUTIFUL INTERLUDE IN TURBULENT TIMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fernando Trueba ' s sexy , bittersweet and contemplative comedy , &quot; Belle Epoque &quot; ( at the Royal and Esquire ) , takes us back in time and place to an uncertain but hopeful moment of calm before the storm . It ' s February , 1931 , somewhere in Spain . The previous December , there was an uprising in Madrid against King Alfonso XIII , who would soon leave the country , paving the way for the Republicans to gain control of the government by the end of the year . Trueba and his co-writers imagine a magical interlude in a sunny idyllic setting , where freedom and passion reign . He views the workings of the human comedy with the wisdom and detached compassion of Jean Renoir , to whom the Oscar-nominated &quot; Belle Epoque , &quot; could stand as a homage . Fleeing Madrid for the countryside and dreaming vaguely of emigrating to America , Fernando ( Jorge Sanz ) , a handsome young army deserter , lands in a charming rural community after a darkly comic -- and ultimately prophetic -- encounter with a pair of Civil Guards . In the parlor of the local brothel , where the leaders of tiny Arcos , including the priest , regularly play cards , Fernando is taken under the wing of the leading member of the landed gentry , the aging but vital Don Manolo ( the great veteran character star Fernando Fernan Gomez ) . Don Manolo lives alone in his fine old manor_house , and takes a paternal interest in Fernando . Several days later , Fernando has said his farewells , when suddenly the Don ' s four attractive daughters descend upon their father . The bowled-over Fernando , not surprisingly , manages to miss his train . In good time he manages to have his way with them -- and vice versa . There ' s Clara ( Miriam Diaz-Aroca ) , a man-hungry recent widow ; the gorgeous Rocio ( Maribel Verdu ) , clumsily , presumptuously pursued by a rich nerd ( Gabino Diego ) and his titanically overbearing mother ( veteran comedian Chus Lampreave ) ; the pig-tailed , virginal Luz ( Penelope Cruz ) and Violeta ( Ariadna Gil ) , a lesbian who finds herself attracted to Fernando once she ' s got herself in a military_uniform and him dressed as a maid , costumed for a carnival celebration . Fresh from the seminary , Fernando , who is initially naive and even prim , finds himself the sole male in a rural &quot; La Ronde. &quot; Trueba looks beyond these lusty , comic and uninhibited couplings to envision a world where reigns a pagan freedom of spirit , epitomized by the open-minded , uninhibited Don Manolo , grateful for the hugely theatrical arrival of his opera-singer wife ( Mary Carmen Ramirez ) , accompanied by her rich , devoted manager / lover ( France ' s peerless comedian Michel Galabru ) . Rebel at heart that he is , Manolo curses the fact that he ' s potent only with his indomitable wife , who ' s constantly sailing off to one disastrous concert tour after another . Trueba casts us into a ribald &quot; You can ' t Take It With You , &quot; but subtly reminds us that like life , liberty itself can be fleeting . Trueba ' s people , meanwhile , are too joyously partaking of life , speaking as freely as they make_love , to realize how special this interlude is in which for once life pretty much proceeds the way it ought to . Even though Spanish audiences are unquestionably at an advantage in_regard_to the film ' s political context and its literary allusions , &quot; Belle Epoque &quot; surely possesses a warm , universal appeal . Trueba embraces his cast so affectionately that in spirit the sly , confident veterans Gomez , Ramirez and Galabru are as youthful as the cast ' s good-looking and talented young actors . With its gorgeous settings , whimsical score and robust yet dark-tinged good_humor , &quot; Belle Epoque &quot; is sure to be a strong contender for best foreign film .
