   <HEADLINE> FULLERTON POLICE ARREST SUSPECT IN ATM FRAUD RING ; CRIME : AUTHORITIES BELIEVE HE IS PART OF A NETWORK TARGETING BANK OF AMERICA . THIS IS THE COUNTY ' S SECOND CARD SCAM ARREST IN A MONTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Quick thinking by a bank customer who flagged_down police after seeing someone loitering near an automated teller machine led to the arrest of a man suspected of being part of an ATM fraud ring , authorities said Tuesday . Shimon Levi , 29 , was arrested without incident Monday night after police found him carrying a handgun outside the Bank of America at 1831 W . Orangethorpe Ave. , said Fullerton Police Lt . Tony Hernandez . Officers who searched Levi ' s car found more_than 200 counterfeit ATM cards , $ 4 # 200 in $ 20 bills and a list of bank_account numbers , police said . &quot; ( Levi ) had a large map of Orange County laying_out 18 other locations of Bank of Americas , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; It looked_like he was just getting started for the evening and had made all_of the withdrawals out of the ATM machine at this bank. &quot; Police believe Levi was not working alone , but is part of a ring targeting Bank of America customers . Levi , a resident of West Hills in the San Fernando Valley , was being held Tuesday at the Federal Detention Center in Los Angeles on suspicion of forgery , fraudulent use of credit_cards and possession of a loaded handgun , Hernandez said . Hernandez said the ring uses receipts left_behind at ATMs to obtain customers ' account numbers and surveillance to obtain their personal identification_number , or PIN . The ring apparently manufactures phony ATM cards and encodes their magnetic strips with filched account numbers , he said . &quot; The ring will either videotape or use binoculars or telescopes to watch people put their ( PIN ) numbers into the machines , &quot; Hernandez said . This is the second time in a month that police in Orange County have arrested people in connection with an ATM card scam . On Feb . 9 , Newport Beach police arrested three men and charged them in an ATM fraud scheme that may have netted $ 100 # 000 in cash . In that case , police seized 500 automated teller machine cards , magnetic strips for altering the cards , a telescope , $ 20 # 000 in cash and two firearms . The three men are in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles awaiting arraignment March 7 . Both cases were turned_over by local police to the U.S. Secret_Service , which investigates the counterfeiting of credit_cards , a federal offense . Federal investigators would not comment on the case Tuesday . Local police said they did not know if the two Orange County cases are linked or if either is connected to a major automated teller ring in the San Fernando Valley . The San Fernando Valley ring , which has been operating for more_than a year , is believed to be responsible_for stealing at least $ 100 # 000 from Bank of America customers ' accounts , authorities said . In that scheme , authorities said the thieves have used high-powered cameras hidden in vans , hotel_rooms and rented offices to tape customers as they entered their PINs . They then pair card numbers with the PINs by noting when the transaction took_place and matching the time_of_day printed on the discarded ATM receipt to the hour recorded on the videotape , authorities said . Bank of America has apparently been a target because , until recently , its machines printed the entire account number on receipts . The bank , however , ceased the practice in December , the same month it was reported that federal_agents were investigating the San Fernando Valley ring . Other banks such_as Wells Fargo and Great Western discontinued printing the entire account numbers on ATM receipts as a security measure in mid-1992 . Bank of America ' s spokesman Harvey Radin said the discovery of the San Fernando Valley ring and the change in procedure at his bank were merely a coincidence . &quot; It was an isolated case , and blocking_out the numbers was not a result of that situation , &quot; Radin said . &quot; It ' s an extra safety measure that adds another element of security. &quot; Radin recommends the following steps to protect yourself from becoming a victim of ATM fraud : * Be aware of your surroundings . * Shield the key pad with your hand or your body while entering your code . * Do not leave your transaction receipt behind . &quot; If you take these relatively simple steps , you can protect yourself so you won ' t be a victim of this type of fraud , &quot; Radin said . Radin said customers who prove to be legitimate victims of fraud are reimbursed for their loss after their complaint is thoroughly investigated . Most ATM accounts have withdrawal limits , usually between $ 200 and $ 500 a day , which restricts the amount_of_money a thief can take at one time . Bank of America has more_than 3 # 400 automated teller machines throughout the state . Radin said that despite the recent incidents , fraudulent use of these machines is still extremely rare , accounting_for less than one-tenth of 1 % of all transactions .</TEXT>
