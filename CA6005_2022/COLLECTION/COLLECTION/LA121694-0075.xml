   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; DEFENSE MINISTERS PATCH_UP NATO UNITY ; DIPLOMACY : TWO-DAY MEETING FINDS WAYS TO STRENGTHEN U.N. FORCE IN BOSNIA . U.S. SOFTENS TALK OF EXPANDING ALLIANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During a two-day meeting ending Thursday , NATO defense ministers did a good job of patching together a sense of unity in an alliance that in recent months has become dangerously divided . On the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina , an issue that has so torn the 16-member North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization that some feared it could cause irreparable damage , the ministers visibly pulled_together to find ways of strengthening the struggling U.N. Protection Force there . On the delicate subject of extending NATO membership eastward -- which drew criticism this month from some European allies that the United States had forced the pace and spooked the Russians -- Defense_Secretary William J . Perry noticeably throttled back the Administration ' s rhetoric . &quot; There ' s no timetable on expansion , &quot; he said at a news_conference Thursday before leaving for Moscow . &quot; All of us believe this will take some years. &quot; And , in case anyone missed the subtleties , an official communique on the meeting stressed &quot; the determination of our alliance to maintain its unity and cohesion. &quot; But while NATO seems to have recovered its balance temporarily , more trouble almost certainly lies ahead . Indeed , with all_the unknowns in NATO ' s future , one of the few certainties is that unity will be increasingly difficult to maintain . In many ways , NATO faces a reality articulated nearly two centuries ago by the_French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand : Coalitions tend to last only as long as the reason that brought them together in the first place . With the common enemy -- communism -- now dead , NATO ' s glue has weakened perceptibly . The foray_into Bosnia was an attempt to carve out a new , post-Cold War role for NATO as a peacekeeper in brush-fire wars outside its own member countries . It has been a crushing failure , in part because the alliance has found itself completely at_odds with the way the United Nations conducts its business . But NATO has also suffered greatly in Bosnia because in this post-Cold War era , the interests of its members no longer coincide as they once did . When President George_Bush made a conscious decision to stay out of the way of a collapsing Yugoslavia , it marked the first time since World_War_II that the Europeans faced a major crisis on_their_own . With the forces of seven NATO allies struggling on the ground in Bosnia and the Clinton_Administration belatedly eager to punish the Bosnian Serbs from the air but unwilling to commit ground troops , strains within the group were inevitable . A row between the United States and France late last month over tactics in Bosnia became so bitter that both sides reportedly pulled_back for fear of opening a serious , long-term rift . &quot; Bosnia marks a setback , &quot; noted Edward Foster , a European defense expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London . &quot; We ' ve had a clear illustration of how the abstract concept of exporting stability plays_out in reality. &quot; The rift over NATO ' s eastern expansion has similar origins : a conviction on the part of Europeans that the United States has waded into an extremely sensitive issue , complicating rather than helping resolve their problems . The view of one European ally was reflected in a confidential telegram last month from Germany ' s NATO Ambassador Hermann von Richtofen to the Foreign Ministry in Bonn warning that the U.S. attempt to push_through rapid expansion could turn &quot; into a Pyrrhic_victory for the alliance. &quot; Since that message was leaked to a Munich newspaper , officials from several other European delegations at NATO have commented that it captured their feelings too . &quot; It ' s not the policy itself , it ' s the lack of contact , the lack of real consultation , &quot; complained a senior official at NATO , who declined to be identified by name or nationality . Transatlantic differences are nothing new_to NATO . Before the fall of the Iron_Curtain , the Americans frequently clashed with their allies . But in those years , agreement always came because of the need to unite against the Soviet threat . Now that threat no longer exists . &quot; There is a different international climate and a different America , &quot; said Dominique Moisi , deputy director of the_French Institute for International Affairs in Paris . &quot; It is an America much less keen to be involved in Europe . It ' s wrong to talk_about NATO being terminally ill , but the crisis it faces now is deeper than at any previous time. &quot;</TEXT>
