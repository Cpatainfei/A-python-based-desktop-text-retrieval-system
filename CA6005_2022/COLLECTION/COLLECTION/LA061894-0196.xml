   <TEXT> The Graphix Zone , a multimedia company best known for making an interactive music compact_disc for the singer formerly known as Prince , raised $ 3.9 million Friday in an initial_public_offering . The company issued 1.2 million shares at $ 3.25 a share on Nasdaq . Cruttenden &amp; Co. , an Irvine-based investment bank , managed the underwriting . Some portion of the money raised goes_to the underwriters ; the rest will be used as working capital . The Graphix Zone was formed in August , 1989 , by Chuck Cortright and Angela Aber , a husband-and-wife team who worked as marketing managers in the early years of AST Research Inc. , which has become multibillion-dollar computer manufacturer . Cortright , Graphix Zone chief_executive , and Aber , executive_vice_president , said they wanted to take_advantage of opportunities in multimedia , or the blending of video , sound , animation and text in a single computer_program . The founders did not sell any of their stock . Their company started_out as a desktop_publishing software retailer in the original Computer City Super Center store in Garden Grove . Computer City went_on to become a nationwide computer sales chain . After a year , the Graphix Zone moved to the Irvine Spectrum and focused_on marketing high-tech equipment and offering computer production services such_as desktop_publishing and laser printing . The company dabbled_in various projects , such_as creating a three-dimensional computer_program that helped train U.S. Olympic wrestlers in 1992 , and a service dubbed Creator Center , an editing laboratory that enabled film editors to create their own special_effects . Graphix Zone focused_on multimedia publishing in the past year , dedicating more_than half of its 30 employees to creating interactive computer_programs known as CD-ROMs , for compact_disc , read-only_memory . It published a guide to using multimedia for beginners and , in June , began shipping an interactive music CD-ROM for the music star best known as Prince , who changed his name to a hybrid male-female symbol that has no translation in the_English language . The disc blends Prince trivia , four music videos , 52 songs and animation . It was made as part of a deal with media giant Time Warner Inc. The company hopes much of its future revenue will come from such multimedia projects . The company reported net_income of about $ 15 # 000 on revenue of $ 1.7 million for the 11 months ended June 30 , 1993 , compared with a loss of $ 457 # 765 on revenue of $ 1 million for the previous 12 months . The company had a short fiscal_year since it changed its year-end from July 31 to June 30 . The company has roughly 2.5 million shares outstanding .</TEXT>
