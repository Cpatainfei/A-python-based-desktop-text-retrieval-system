   <HEADLINE> 12 DIE , 8 HURT IN PICKUP CRASH NEAR BARSTOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A compact pickup_truck crammed with 20 people apparently heading from Mexico to Los Angeles drifted_off a freeway and crashed into a drainage culvert near here early Wednesday , killing 12 passengers and sending eight others to hospitals with serious injuries . The California Highway Patrol said the driver apparently fell_asleep at the wheel after driving all night from the Mexican border town of Nogales , Ariz . Most of the victims were flung from the wreckage and scattered across the rock-strewn desert in what the CHP described as one of the most deadly single-vehicle accidents in the state ' s history . &quot; There were bodies on top of bodies , people in pain lying on top of people lying_in pain , &quot; said motorist Robert Silver , who stopped at the scene moments after the crash occurred . Of the four people who had been wedged into the cab of the 1981 Toyota pickup , only the driver survived . Nine of the 16 passengers in the bed of the pickup , which was covered by a camper shell , were killed . A CHP investigator said there were so many people in the vehicle that the weight of the human cargo may have been greater than the weight of the vehicle itself . He said that although the truck was approximately 1 # 700 pounds above the manufacturer ' s gross vehicle weight rating , that in itself was not a violation of state law . However , because a driver is responsible_for the safety of his passengers , the CHP said it would seek at least 12 counts of vehicular manslaughter against the driver . Among the seven men and five women who died was a pregnant woman . Of the survivors , at least one was from El_Salvador . That passenger , Alejandro Enriquez , 24 , told Associated Press after he was released from Barstow Community Hospital that the group of immigrants met after entering the United States . He said that as the group grew to 20 , each contributed $ 50 toward a trip to Los Angeles . The CHP said the truck was registered to a Los Angeles man , Elder Ruado Mejia Ordonez . Officers said the driver of the vehicle , who did not have a driver ' s license , identified himself as Aidan B . Ordonez . Whether they are related , or perhaps even the same man , was not immediately clear . Elder Ordonez was cited after a traffic accident last year for driving without a license . CHP investigators said they had no idea whether the group of immigrants had entered the country illegally . &quot; that ' s not our area of expertise , &quot; Pitt said . Investigators said the group apparently left Nogales about 7 p.m. Tuesday . CHP Lt . Don Pitt said some of the immigrants were headed for Los Angeles International Airport for flights elsewhere . Just before 6 a.m. Wednesday , the truck drifted_off the freeway , veered nearly 200 feet across a stretch of rocks , sand and dirt and and crashed into an earthen culvert that crosses beneath the freeway about 10 feet below pavement level . On impact , the vehicle buckled at a 45-degree angle . &quot; There were bodies everywhere , &quot; said Silver , who used a roadside call_box to summon help . &quot; Most of them were making some kind of sounds . I was holding hands , trying to keep them still . They were very calm. &quot; Of the 16 passengers in the back of the pickup -- who under California law were not required to wear seat_belts because of the camper shell -- six were ejected and killed . Three others who died in the back of the truck and three killed in the cab had to be removed from the wreckage with hydraulically powered rescue_equipment . It took the first emergency crews about 10 minutes to reach the scene . They were from a San Bernardino County Fire_Department station in Barstow . &quot; This was not a good place for a crash , &quot; department spokesman Bill Peters said . &quot; There ' s no three-minute response_time out here. &quot; Silver said he got the impression that none of the passengers knew each other because none were asking about the condition of the others . The driver , he said , was conscious after the accident and asked Silver to help him open the door . It was jammed , and the man stayed inside , alongside his dead passengers , until firefighters arrived . Pitt said the lack of skid marks indicated the strong possibility that the driver fell_asleep . &quot; Had it not been for the number of fatalities , this would have been the basic accident we have out here , day after day -- people falling_asleep on_the_road , &quot; Pitt said . There were no immediate indications of mechanical failure , according to CHP Officer Steve Hobart . Three of the injured were brought by helicopter to the San Bernardino County Medical_Center in San Bernardino . They are Jose Rosales , 20 , listed in stable condition with a broken collarbone ; Sonia Lopez , about 18 , in stable condition with pelvic and leg fractures , and an unidentified woman , about 20 , in critical condition with severe head and abdominal injuries . Hospitalized at the Loma Linda University Medical_Center in Loma Linda were Odir Garcia 11 , with possible head injuries ; an unidentified woman in critical condition with multiple fractures and an unidentified man who was undergoing surgery for unspecified injuries . Joe Flanders , a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service , said the agency would question the survivors about their immigration status after their immediate medical needs were addressed . &quot; The first order_of_business was to get them treated at hospitals , &quot; he said . &quot; We want them in hospitals so they can get fixed up. &quot; Flanders said those who smuggle immigrants into this country often cram that many people into a small vehicle . &quot; They don ' t have any qualms about the comfort or convenience of the people they carry , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' ll get as_many people into a space as they can , with no regard for comfort or human life. &quot; The worst single-vehicle crash in California history occurred in 1976 , when 29 passengers in a bus were killed near Martinez , the CHP reported . Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Edward J . Boyer , Carla Hall and Eric Malnic . * SAFETY LOOPHOLE : Camper shells are exempt from new seat_belt law . A3 Deadly Crash A dozen immigrants were killed early Wednesday when a pickup_truck carrying 20 people slammed into a 10-foot-deep drainage_ditch on Interstate 15 about 13 miles south of Barstow .</TEXT>
