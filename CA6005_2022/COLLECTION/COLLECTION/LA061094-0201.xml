   <HEADLINE> HOUSE VOTES TO LIFT BOSNIA ARMS BAN ; CONGRESS : LAWMAKERS REJECT CLINTON PLEA AGAINST UNILATERAL ACTION , 244-178 . BUT A SENATE BILL IS MONTHS AWAY , AND PASSAGE OF ANY MEASURE IS SEEN AS UNLIKELY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the latest congressional revolt over President Clinton ' s handling of foreign_policy , the House voted by a large margin Thursday to require the Administration to unilaterally lift an embargo on arms sales to Bosnia-Herzegovina . The vote was 244 to 178 ; 117 Democrats lined_up against the White_House , while 132 supported the President . After the vote , the White_House said that , while Clinton favors lifting the U.N. embargo , he opposes acting without the consent of North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization allies who have peacekeeping troops on the ground in the Balkans . But the House decided that the embargo is unfairly punishing Bosnian Muslims , who are seriously outgunned by the Bosnian Serbs . &quot; If the President had spoken out loudly and clearly for his principles , we would n ' t be in this mess . . , &quot; complained Rep . Frank McCloskey , the Indiana Democrat who led the rebellion over Bosnia . &quot; But we don ' t have any sense of resolve , clarity , focus or expertise anywhere &quot; in foreign_policy . McCloskey warned that missteps on foreign_policy would &quot; become at some point a domestic political liability for the President , &quot; undercutting his stature on such issues as health reform . The House-passed measure , attached_to the House version of the annual bill authorizing defense spending for the coming year , is unlikely to become law . Although the Senate adopted similar legislation by a 50-49 vote last month , McCloskey ' s measure must still be accepted when the House and Senate Armed Services committees meet later this year to reconcile their versions of the defense authorization bill . Later Thursday , the House passed its $ 262.7-billion defense authorization bill by a vote of 260-158 , but the Senate bill is at least two months away from clearing the Senate floor . Both the chairman and the ranking Republican of the Senate panel oppose lifting the embargo unilaterally , as does House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ronald V . Dellums ( D-Oakland ) . &quot; Given the hurdles , it ' s very unlikely this will go all_the way and , even if it does , it has not been passed_by nearly enough votes to be veto-proof , &quot; said a House foreign_policy aide . That seemed small consolation to an Administration smarting from a series of congressional rebukes that reflect a lack of confidence in Clinton ' s conduct of foreign affairs . In a letter circulated to House Democrats before the vote , Clinton argued that &quot; unilateral action now would be particularly damaging &quot; because it would undermine support for economic sanctions that Washington wants to impose on North_Korea to punish it for refusing to allow inspections of nuclear facilities . More_than that , Clinton said , McCloskey ' s amendment would mean the end of the effort to bring peace to Bosnia . Three of Clinton ' s top military and foreign_policy advisers -- Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , Joint Chiefs_of_Staff Chairman Gen . John M . Shalikashvili and Deputy Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott -- underscored those points in greater detail at a closed briefing , attended by more_than 100 House members shortly before the vote . &quot; They argued very strongly that lifting the embargo now would only intensify the war in Bosnia and that lifting it unilaterally would cause a serious rift with the NATO allies , &quot; one participant said . &quot; They even suggested at one point that the future of the NATO alliance could be at stake. &quot; But several lawmakers who attended the session said they thought that the Administration team had failed to make a compelling case . Others said they were inclined not to take the warnings too seriously because they doubted the mandate to lift the embargo would ever become law . &quot; Absolutely ! &quot; responded Rep . Susan Molinari ( R-N.Y. ) when asked if her colleagues regarded the McCloskey amendment as a &quot; free vote &quot; that allowed them to express their displeasure with Clinton ' s Bosnia policy without actually forcing him to change it . In Sarajevo , Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic welcomed the vote . The Associated Press quoted him as saying on Sarajevo radio , &quot; We were not expecting such a significant and great victory . . . . We are dealing with a unilateral lifting of the embargo , which the U.N. Security_Council can no longer influence. &quot; The Security_Council , with the support of the United States , imposed the embargo in September , 1991 . The idea was to keep weaponry in the region to a minimum and thus reduce the violence . In fact , critics argue , it has aided well-armed Serbian forces by denying Bosnian Muslims the weapons needed to defend themselves . Thursday ' s vote &quot; wasn ' t exactly a ringing endorsement &quot; for Clinton ' s foreign_policies , conceded House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee H . Hamilton ( D-Ind. ) , who led the losing fight against McCloskey ' s amendment . &quot; A number of Democrats told me they didn ' t really want to lift the embargo unilaterally but did want to send a strong signal of disapproval to the President over his Bosnia policy and knew that it would be cleaned_up in conference &quot; with the Senate , Hamilton added . Hamilton , who said he knew that the Administration could not win , had sponsored an alternative that would have urged Clinton to seek allied support for the lifting of the embargo . His amendment was defeated by a vote of 242 to 181 . &quot; There were just a large_number of people who wanted to say as strongly as possible that the President ' s policy is unacceptable , &quot; Hamilton said . Rep . Steny H . Hoyer ( D-Md. ) a leader of the embargo-lifting effort , said , &quot; For two years now , we have looked the ( Serbian ) aggressor in the eye and said , ' If you go one step further we will take definitive action. ' And they took some steps , and we backed_up . &quot; There is an old , old historical lesson : Tyrants never respond to weakness , &quot; Hoyer said .</TEXT>
