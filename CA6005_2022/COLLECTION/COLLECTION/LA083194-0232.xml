   <TEXT> Anyone going_off to college these days will need access to a computer . But you don ' t necessarily have to buy a new one , especially if you already have a home PC that you can bring along . Another option is to use one of the school ' s computers . Many colleges offer public computer labs where students can use PCs or Macs for little or no cost . These labs are typically located in the center of campus but are sometimes in dorms , libraries or individual academic_departments . Many labs also offer access to high-speed laser_printers , but there may be a charge per page . If you might be using a lab computer , ask what is done to protect users from contracting a software virus . The threat of such an infection to individual PC users is often exaggerated , but it can be a real problem when using a shared computer . The campus computer center staff can help you avoid the risk . If you already have a PC -- even an older one -- there is a good chance it will be adequate for school needs . Just about any computer is OK for writing papers or plugging_in a modem so you can connect to the school ' s central network . Of course , there are advantages to having the latest and greatest . But if you do decide to buy a new machine , be sure to do some research to find_out which one is best for your studies . And before buying , check to see if the campus store offers special deals on hardware and software . Only a_few schools require a specific type of computer , but on some campuses there is a preferred type used by most students . Being in sync with what ' s popular on campus means it will be easier to get help from fellow students and faculty as well as access to data files and software programs . The preferred machine varies not only by campus but also by department . Graphic arts_departments are likely to encourage Macintosh use and business_schools are more inclined to use IBM-compatibles , but there are exceptions , so don ' t jump to conclusions . A visit or phone_call to your department or the school ' s academic computing center is advised before buying a new computer . Your first decision is whether to go_for an IBM-compatible PC or an Apple Macintosh . I used to think that Macs were the most popular machines for undergraduates , but that ' s not necessarily true . A recent UCLA survey found that 68 % of the students have computers and that about 60 % of those are IBM-compatible . Don Worth , manager of the UCLA microcomputer support office , prefers that students have either Macs or PCs that can run Windows ; they ' re easier to support and to connect to the campus network . However , many students , he acknowledges , come_to campus with old 286 PCs -- fine for word_processing and other basic tasks . Richard Brown , director of UCLA ' s Health Policy Research_Center , gives different advice depending_on who ' s asking . When it came_to his own daughter , a student at University of California , Santa Cruz , he bought a Macintosh &quot; because it is easy to use. &quot; For graduate_students and staff working in his program , he recommends a PC with Windows because &quot; it will be easier to exchange files with other computers in the department. &quot; There was a time when campus bookstores sold machines at far below retail prices , but these days the difference won ' t be all that remarkable . If you ' re buying an IBM-compatible machine , you ' re likely to get as good a deal or better on the open market , but check first . Macs are a different story . The Stanford_University bookstore , for example , offers the Macintosh Quadra 630 with 4 megabytes of RAM and a 250-megabyte hard_disk for $ 1 # 086 . The same machine costs about $ 1 # 259 at retail_stores . Nevertheless , it still pays to shop around and watch for_sales . Definitely check the campus store before you buy software . Many campuses have negotiated site license arrangements with software firms that allow them to sell programs to students and staff at substantially reduced prices . Notebook_computers are ideal for some students because they can be carried to class for note taking or used at the library , coffee_shop or a friend ' s dorm_room . Be careful , though . But notebooks are also easily lost or stolen . If you get a notebook , consider one that accommodates an external monitor , keyboard and mouse for use in the dorm_room . Leading notebook_computer makers include Apple , Dell , IBM , Compaq and Toshiba . You ' ll also need a modem to log_on to the campus computer_system , unless your dorm happens to be wired for a direct connection . If you get a modem , your best bet is a 14 # 400-bit-per-second data-fax modem . I ' ve seen IBM-compatible , internal 14 # 400 bps modems for as little as $ 60 . High-speed external modems start at about $ 100 . If you have access to the Internet , there is a good chance the college or university has an on-line menu ( called &quot; gopher &quot; ) that you can access from any Internet provider even if you ' re away from campus . In each case , I was able to find information about campus computer resources , including hardware and software that students can buy or borrow . You can also use the Internet to check library catalogues and , in some cases , course listings . Internet gophers are organized geographically , so once you learn to use the system , it ' s easy to find your way around . Speaking of the Internet , electronic_mail is a great way for parents and friends to communicate with college_students . Many universities offer free Internet accounts to students , which means it will cost them nothing to send or receive mail .</TEXT>
