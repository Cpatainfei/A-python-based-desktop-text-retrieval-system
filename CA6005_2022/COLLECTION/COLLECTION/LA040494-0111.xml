   <TEXT> With Bosnian Serb forces pressing attacks on the Muslim and Croatian populations in at least two Bosnian cities , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry on Sunday ruled_out the use of U.S. troops to prevent the Serbs from capturing additional territory . While Christians in the capital of Sarajevo observed their first peaceful Easter_Sunday in two years , Bosnian Serb forces bombarded the city of Gorazde in southeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina for the sixth day . In the bombardment and infantry battles around the Muslim enclave , where 65 # 000 people are trapped , the toll rose to at least 10 people killed and 120 wounded , according to U.N. peacekeeping forces in the area . And in northern Bosnia , the Serbs continued to press what is being called a ferocious campaign of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; in the Banja Luka area , including the town of Prijedor . Asked whether the United States will consider air strikes or armed intervention to curb further such actions by Serbian forces , Perry declared pointedly , &quot; We will not enter the war to stop that from happening. &quot; Prijedor was the scene last week of a renewed terror campaign by Bosnian Serbs that is believed to have claimed the lives of 17 Muslims and three Croats . U.N. officials reported that more people were forced from their homes_in Prijedor on Saturday , and one person reportedly died of wounds suffered Thursday . Over the weekend , U.N. officials reported that Serbian militants had firebombed houses and forced Muslims from their homes_in Sipovo and forcibly evicted others in Vrbanja , both Banja Luka suburbs . The Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees has accused Bosnian Serb authorities of allowing the attacks , and the Red_Cross is planning the evacuation of Croats and Muslims from Prijedor . On Sunday , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic ordered his forces to arrest those responsible_for the attacks in Prijedor and guaranteed safe passage for evacuees . Perry ' s comments on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press &quot; followed a plea on the same program from Bosnia ' s Muslim prime_minister , Haris Silajdzic , for U.S. military intervention in the 2-year-old conflict . &quot; The answer is , use force . . . . Otherwise , this is going_to be a very , very long and bloody peace , &quot; Silajdzic said . &quot; ( Use ) air strikes . When they ( Serbs ) kill innocent people , they should be punished for that , and they will not stop until they are punished. &quot; Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the commander of U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia , said on the same program that the addition of U.S. troops would &quot; of course &quot; help in quelling the conflict . &quot; The arrival of any troops here will help that peace process , &quot; Rose said . The United States has not sent any ground troops to Bosnia , maintaining that a durable settlement must be in place before it risks deploying troops there . On Sunday , Perry said the United States will go no further , militarily , to halt a Bosnian Serb offensive that appears aimed at consolidating gains before any peace agreement is struck . Indeed , Perry confirmed that Washington is &quot; trying to hold_down the total costs involved &quot; in peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslav federation . Commenting on a range of U.S. national security challenges , Perry also ruled_out preemptive U.S. strikes on North_Korean nuclear facilities at this time . But he warned that fighting could break_out on the Korean_Peninsula , with catastrophic consequences , as North_Korea reacts to increased diplomatic and economic pressure from the United States . Noting that U.S. intelligence agencies believe that North_Korea now has built as_many as two nuclear bombs , Perry outlined a step-by-step U.S. diplomatic strategy designed , first , to freeze the North_Korean nuclear program in place and only then to &quot; roll . . . back the program they have. &quot; &quot; We will not have a preemptive military strike at this time and under these circumstances , &quot; Perry said . But he added : &quot; I am not ruling that option out_in the future. &quot; Perry said the United States could step_up its diplomatic efforts to bring North_Korea to heel with &quot; considerable pressure , &quot; including additional economic sanctions . &quot; That will increase the risk &quot; that the North_Koreans will respond with a military assault on the south , he warned . &quot; And because it will increase the risk , we will increase our defensive forces as needed to prudently protect ourselves against that risk. &quot;</TEXT>
