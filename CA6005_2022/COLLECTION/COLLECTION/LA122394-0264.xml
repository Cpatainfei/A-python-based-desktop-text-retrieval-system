   <HEADLINE> 75 # 000 EVACUATED AS MEXICAN VOLCANO RUMBLES ; LATIN_AMERICA : RESIDENTS OF 16 VILLAGES FLEE AMID FEARS OF AN IMMINENT ERUPTION . NEW PERIL COMES AMID OTHER NATIONAL CRISES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fearing an imminent eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano outside this nation ' s capital , the army and civil_defense forces Thursday began emergency evacuation of 75 # 000 residents from 16 villages , as President Ernesto Zedillo ' s government struggled with a series of economic , political -- and now , natural -- crises just three weeks into its term . With hundreds of other troops and riot police moving deeper into the mountains in the southernmost state of Chiapas , where Indian rebels took_over dozens of villages in a peaceful one-day insurrection on Monday , Zedillo was forced to call_on the army again in Mexico_City : Experts determined that a towering plume of black smoke from Popocatepetl on Wednesday could herald a major eruption of the 17 # 887-foot mountain . Authorities were_on alert , preparing to implement a sweeping emergency plan for the region after 5 # 000 tons of ash coated dozens of villages in the state of Puebla , east of the capital , throughout the night . Mexico ' s National Center for Disaster Prevention announced that a minor quake followed underground explosions Wednesday that were so intense they melted the snow on the peaks of the mountain known here as &quot; Popo. &quot; The blast of smoke and ash followed weeks of intense seismic activity inside Popo , which last erupted in 1947 . U.S. and Mexican scientists have expressed increasing concern that the volcano was becoming dangerously active , and environmental groups have sharply criticized the government for failing to prepare nearby residents for their evacuation . The threat of an eruption that could endanger millions of Mexicans came against the backdrop of brewing economic and political disasters that are already testing Zedillo ' s government . Less than a month into a term that Zedillo vowed would usher_in historic change , the 42-year-old economist and his young government are defending themselves not merely on natural-disaster preparedness but also on their handling of the Chiapas troubles and an ensuing financial crisis that Zedillo asserts is related . Zedillo ' s financial advisers performed radical surgery on the Mexican economy late Wednesday night , allowing the nation ' s currency to float freely against the U.S. dollar . And in a speech to economists , the president made an effort to justify the peso ' s free-fall as economic medicine needed for long-term stability -- although it will likely trigger higher inflation , cuts_in spending power and continuing financial instability well into 1995 . In the same speech , Zedillo took pains to defend his Chiapas policy and explain how the two are linked . &quot; There cannot be economic stability if there is no political stability , &quot; he said , conceding that his government must redouble efforts to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict in the embattled state , which began last Jan . 1 . But the president took no additional action on the uprising by the Zapatista National Liberation Army and its peasant supporters . He simply repeated his commitment to a proposed legislative peace commission to negotiate a political settlement . Coming less than a week before Christmas , the series of crises intensified public criticism of Zedillo , who was shown to have 58 % of popular support in public_opinion_polls just a week ago . &quot; Merry Christmas ? ? ? ? &quot; said the headline on an editorial in the independent daily Reforma on Thursday . The newspaper sharply questioned Zedillo ' s political skills and his timing in permitting the radical peso devaluation within days of one of this overwhelmingly Catholic nation ' s most important holidays . Signaling that the president ' s brief honeymoon with the Mexican press may be nearing its end , the same editorial page carried a cartoon illustrating what several analysts said was increasing dissatisfaction with the new administration . In a clear poke_at Zedillo ' s Chiapas strategy , the cartoon shows a frantic bureaucrat in coat and tie , pointing at Popo and shouting to the president , &quot; Sir , Popocatepetl is threatening to explode. &quot; A pensive Zedillo , drawn_in enormous wire-rim glasses with hand on chin , responds , &quot; we ' ll form a commission and ask it what it wants. &quot;</TEXT>
