   <HEADLINE> PANEL CHIEF SEES TREATY TO BAN NUCLEAR TESTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A treaty banning all nuclear_weapons tests could be reached this year or the beginning of next year , the chairman of the committee negotiating the ban said . This is much sooner than the 12 to 18 months that Miguel Marin-Bosch gave after the conclusion of the first round of talks on a comprehensive test ban treaty in late March . Marin-Bosch , of Mexico , is chairman of the nuclear test ban committee of the 38-nation Conference of Disarmament . After decades of Cold_War stalemate , the United States and Russia decided last year to actively support a comprehensive test ban , a decision widely supported by countries without nuclear_weapons . The United States , the Soviet_Union and Britain agreed on a partial test ban in 1963 covering tests in the atmosphere , outer space and underwater . A comprehensive test ban treaty -- aimed primarily at underground tests -- would outlaw all nuclear_explosions .</TEXT>
