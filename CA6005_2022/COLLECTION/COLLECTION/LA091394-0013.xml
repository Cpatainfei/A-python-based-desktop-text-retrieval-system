   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / JONATHAN CLARKE : DIPLOMACY IS ILL-SERVED BY NAME-CALLING ; PAINTING ADVERSARIES AS BUFFOONS TRIPS UP THE U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To judge from the language of American diplomacy in 1994 , foreigners are a feckless lot . They are &quot; irrational &quot; ( Kim Il Sung ) , &quot; desperate &quot; ( Fidel Castro ) , &quot; rogues &quot; ( Moammar Kadafi ) , enfeebled by old_age ( Deng Xiaoping ) or garden variety &quot; thugs &quot; ( Raoul Cedras , Slobodan Milosevic ) . In short , not worthy of statesmanlike treatment by the United States . This allegedly ill-endowed crew has , however , enjoyed a pretty good year -- much of it at U.S. expense . The Chinese humiliated the secretary_of_state in March . Their reward ? Renewal of most-favored nation status and a visit in August by the secretary_of_commerce with a slew of top businessmen in tow . Before his death , Kim ' s shadow-boxing on the question of North_Korea ' s nuclear potential earned his ( equally &quot; irrational &quot; ) successor the prospect of diplomatic recognition and the promise of a new , fully paid-for nuclear_reactor . And the little matter of accounting_for past plutonium production is now on the back burner . Castro has succeeded in reinstating the American trade_embargo on the U.S. political agenda and in rewriting U.S. immigration laws , not to mention consuming huge amounts of taxpayer money . In Libya , Kadafi has just celebrated the 25th anniversary of his regime , which , in comparison to his neighbors Egypt and Algeria , looks_like an oasis of stability . Milosevic has made himself indispensable as the main pressure point on the Bosnian Serbs . Only Cedras ' prospects look cloudy , but even he can expect a comfortable retirement in the south of France . Not_bad going for a bunch of supposedly isolated , impoverished or flaky has-beens . Boris Yeltsin , who once held top position in U.S. foreign-policy priorities , would have been grateful for a tenth of the presidential time and attention devoted to Haiti . The Administration has not been alone in falling_into this trap . Senators , representatives , columnists and commentators have all delivered themselves of dismissive adjectives about foreign leaders . The trouble is , diplomacy by personalized abuse just does not work . Calling people names may relieve tension or frustration , but will lead policy-makers into grave error if they start believing their own rhetoric . International diplomacy is conducted between sovereign states , complex entities that cannot be given simplistic labels . A cardinal rule of athletics is never to underestimate your opponents ; that puts a dangerous weapon into their hands . So it is with foreign relations . Opponents may be ( and often are ) highly unsavory . This does not mean , however , that the problems they create can be treated with less than top-class diplomatic finesse . Demeaning characterization undermines this principle . It creates the impression that a problem is a one-dimensional battle between good and evil , with the good destined to win effortlessly . Surely , the experience of 1994 has demonstrated the error of this approach . The belief , for example , that Kim Il Sung was an irrational , isolated dictator led U.S. policy-makers to ignore his viewpoint , which was that he was acting highly rationally in trying to protect North_Korea ' s independence and squeeze_out what benefit he could from the West . He noted that Ukraine exploited its nuclear status to gain economic assistance . He copied this example and succeeded in doing_well for his country . Similarly , when the first wave of Cuban refugees started to wash ashore in Florida , the U.S. reaction was to dismiss Castro as a desperate holdover from communism seeking to solve his domestic problems at American expense . Maybe so , but , more important , he caught the Administration with its pants down . While the world moved_on , U.S. policy on Cuba had remained frozen in an incredibly untenable Cold_War time warp . Now Castro may walk away with the big prize in the shape of the ending of the embargo . Senior Democrats , including the chairmen of both the Senate and House foreign affairs committees , have taken his side . Meanwhile , he has exposed the Clinton_Administration as in thrall to the Republican-voting Cuban community in Miami . All in all , an astute political play . These missteps should convey the message that U.S. diplomacy must discard ill-conceived abuse as a diplomatic weapon . It doesn ' t get the job done . Many foreign leaders may be distasteful ; their countries may be less well governed and less prosperous than the United States , but this does not mean that they are dopes . If foreigners can play their cards skillfully , Americans had better do so as well . In the critical tests confronting the United States , such_as a possible invasion of Haiti and the lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia , a clear head will provide a surer guide than a dictionary of insults .</TEXT>
