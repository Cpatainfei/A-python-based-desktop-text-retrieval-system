   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; JAPAN REFORM : RIGHT MOVE , OR A MOVE TO THE RIGHT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan ' s new landmark political reform package will bring_on many changes -- but not the purported one of ferreting_out entrenched corruption among politicians , bureaucrats and industry . Instead , the most likely effect of changes to the election system and political donation rules will be a further concentration of power in the hands of party_bosses . That is the growing consensus among many political analysts , as the initial flush of victory has given_way to a more sober reckoning of what , exactly , the Parliament passed late last week and what effect it will have_on politics here . &quot; I don ' t think the general public thinks that passage of these bills will bring a rosy picture , &quot; said Kojiro Shiraishi , an editorial writer specializing in politics for the Yomiuri newspaper . &quot; No way . They know the reality of the Japanese political world , which is money-tainted and controlled by bosses. &quot; A close look_at the legislative package , an eleventh-hour compromise between Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono , shows that it contains few of the safeguards commonly used against political corruption . The package was passed without an implementation date ; that date and details agreed to in the compromise are expected to be approved in the current parliamentary session . Most importantly , there is no broad public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending . Although the threshold for reporting donations was lowered from $ 14 # 018 to $ 4 # 672 , a donor may still easily split a gift exceeding that amount into smaller sums to escape reporting . Full disclosure of all contributions and greater restrictions on campaign spending are critical to ferret_out the shady deals between politicians and industry that have given_rise to more_than 15 major scandals in the last three decades , many analysts acknowledged . But they said Japanese do not demand public disclosure by their officials to the same extent as Americans because the &quot; right to know &quot; is not as established here . For instance , in a recent ruling that barely caused a ripple , Japan ' s Supreme Court decided that a governor was not required to publicly disclose how he spent his public expense money . His right_to_privacy overrode the public ' s right to know , the court ruled . Analysts said such attitudes stem from Japan ' s legacy of centuries of feudalistic rule , which instilled a &quot; government is god &quot; attitude among the populace , and what Yomiuri research fellow Tatou Takahama called a social predilection to see , hear and speak no evil . Another glaring omission in the reform package , critics said , is the absence of a special enforcement body , akin to the Federal Election_Commission or the California Fair Political Practices Commission , to monitor campaign contributions and investigate suspect deals . Although prosecutors here take_on the more spectacular cases , such_as the wide-ranging bribery investigation into the construction_industry , the vast majority of campaign reports are simply rubber-stamped by Japan ' s election_commission , said Shigeru Arisue , political secretary to Hiroyuki Arai , an LDP legislator who voted for the reform package . &quot; What is really needed is a much more aggressive election_commission , with the same power as prosecutors and police -- but I ' m afraid that might lead to fascism , &quot; he said . Hosokawa ' s decision to seek compromise by dropping the ban on contributions from corporations and labor_unions and allowing individual politicians to accept up_to $ 4 # 672 from each donor came_in_for particular criticism . &quot; Treachery , &quot; the Nihon Keizai business newspaper called it , while the Mainichi newspaper declared that Hosokawa ' s &quot; unprincipled compromise is unacceptable. &quot; Many of the Socialists , meanwhile , were outraged . Hosokawa countered that the corporate donation concession would expire after five years and that contributions could be funneled to politicians through just one supporter ' s group , instead of the unlimited number now allowed . But Japan ' s media had a field_day describing ways to circumvent the restrictions : funneling money to individual politicians through the party , which may accept unlimited donations , or by giving services and items , such_as office space or cars , which are not restricted . But the package will make politicians take responsibility for violations committed by their staff -- previously a giant loophole allowing them to shift the blame . Penalties have also been beefed_up , although they would not take_effect as long as a case is pending ; cases can take years to resolve . And changing the electoral_system to have 300 districts represented by one instead of multiple legislators will eliminate the common practice of members of the same party running against each other , theoretically decreasing the need for campaign money and avenues for corruption . What , then , do analysts see as the real agenda behind the reform package , if not to clean_up corruption ? Brute power_politics . The end of the Cold_War , a generational changing of the political guard and the downfall of political kingpin Shin Kanemaru has kicked_off a fierce scramble to realign alliances here . One of the grittiest street_fighters is Ichiro Ozawa , chief of the Japan Renewal Party who left the LDP when Kanemaru , his mentor , was arrested for tax_evasion last year . He is aiming to reshape Japan into a strong nation capable of taking decisive action internationally , including military ventures . Some analysts see the political reform as an Ozawa victory , because changing the election system is expected to help usher_in a two-party system weighted toward conservatives . That would further smash the Socialists , who have acted_as a brake on the kind of military forays Ozawa favors . Limiting contributions to individual politicians but not parties will strengthen the power of party_bosses to dole_out money in exchange for policy compliance . The result , law professor Shigeo Hagiwara said , will be a &quot; very dangerous centralization of political power &quot; that will allow party leaders to take quicker , but less democratic , action . Chalmers Johnson , a University of California professor and trenchant observer of Japanese politics , concurred . &quot; Japan has taken a major lurch to the right , &quot; he said , adding that Americans must see beyond the illusions of reform and analyze whether the trend is in the United States ' national interest . But in the shadowy world of Japanese politics , nothing is ever certain . Other observers said the reform package was a defeat for Ozawa , who was said to be aiming to enact it without LDP participation to force a splintering of that party between reformers and the old_guard . Rumors are mounting that the LDP ' s Kono decided to compromise to foil Ozawa and may eventually join Hosokawa ' s Japan New Party and Masayoshi Takemura ' s New Party Harbinger , along with a group of LDP reformers , to form a new coalition . In any case , the various scenarios have very little to do with rooting_out corruption -- a conclusion the long-suffering Japanese public seems to have already made . In a poll published Tuesday by the Asahi newspaper , only 23 % of those surveyed said the reform package will improve Japanese politics ; 63 % said it will not change ; 57 % disagreed_with the decision to allow corporate donations . Still , two-thirds said they valued it despite the problems and considered the package &quot; one step forward. &quot;</TEXT>
