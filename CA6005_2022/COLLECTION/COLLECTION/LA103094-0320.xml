   <HEADLINE> WHINING AND DINING ; ITS NO LONGER ENOUGH TO KNOW THE HOTTEST CHEFS AND THE TRENDIEST CUISINES -- FOR TRUE FOODIE STATUS , YOU HAVE TO BEND THEM TO YOUR WILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pasquale and Anna Morra consider themselves accommodating people , but this was too_much to ask . The man at the corner table wanted penne arrabiata with a twist : He wanted smoked mozzarella added_to the spicy tomato_sauce . And some clams . And some sun-dried tomatoes . All mixed together . Pasquale listened glumly to the order . He tried to convince the customer that it was a mistake on several levels . The sauce didn ' t need smoked cheese . Even if it did , he would never combine cheese and shellfish . And the sun-dried tomatoes were too strong . would n ' t the man reconsider ? The diner held his ground . He knew what he wanted , and what he emphatically didn ' t want was a lecture about regional authenticity or appropriate flavor combinations . The customer , after all , is always right . Morra retreated to the kitchen at Da Pasquale , the Beverly Hills trattoria he and his chef wife , Anna , opened in 1989 , and confessed his anguish to her . He knew it was wrong to serve such a dish , but the man wanted it and nothing else . If he fed the guy , he would hate himself . If he didn ' t feed the guy , he was going_to send an angry man out into the world to bad-mouth his restaurant . He considered his wife an artist in the kitchen , but he had a business to run . Morra had to compromise . Ten minutes later he appeared at the man ' s table with two plates -- one bowl of penne arrabiata with a reasonable amount of smoked cheese mixed in , and a separate side order of clams and sun-dried tomatoes . &quot; Here , &quot; he said . &quot; Now I ' m going_to turn my back and go_into the kitchen . You can do whatever you want. &quot; At which point the man mixed his customized dish and devoured it . This is the world of menu manipulation , a far_cry from the half-caff two-step immortalized in Steve Martin ' s comedy &quot; L.A. Story. &quot; In the movies , food tweakers are a joke , whether it ' s Meg Ryan being prissy in &quot; When Harry Met Sally . . . . &quot; or Jack Nicholson demanding a chicken_salad sandwich on toast , hold the chicken_salad , in &quot; Five Easy Pieces. &quot; The real_world is not quite so adorable . Demanding diners have descended on what remains of Los Angeles ' recession-ravaged eating scene . They ' re no longer looking_for the hot chef or the snooty menu . They don ' t need to have an intimate relationship with either the cook or his dishes . Status , now , comes from knowing what you want and getting_it . Today ' s diner is_after personal satisfaction , however idiosyncratic , however weird . that ' s the point . He wants what he wants , centuries of culinary wisdom notwithstanding . He wants to be acknowledged ; he wants to be unique . It is decidedly a buyers ' market . It is the era of what Piero Selvaggio , owner of Valentino , Primi and Posto , calls &quot; Chicca -- the little things people want to do. &quot; Let the restaurateur beware . * The sauce-on-the-side movement began innocently enough with people like my mother , who started families in the antiseptic 1950s and came_to value clean consistency above all else . Machine-cut frozen green_beans were a dependable status symbol , proof that moms had more important things to do with their time than wash , top and tail the real_thing . We had conquered nature -- cleaned it , sliced it on the diagonal in absolutely uniform little chunks , and wedged it into a nice little white box that fit quite snugly in a stack of other nice little white boxes . Forget language . What set us apart from the apes was frozen produce . Predictability was patriotic , too . Plain meat and potatoes were aggressively American , a hefty emblem of the middle_class , proof that life was_better here . Maybe our immigrant ancestors had to smother a tough cut_of_meat in an ethnic sauce , but not us . It was slab cuisine : Heat the meat , thaw the sides , and eat . We distrusted any chef who tried to mask the entree with a sauce -- did he think we couldn ' t afford the very best ? And when the offspring of the convenience generation went_off to college , what did the ' 60s generation get ? Groovy vegetarian grub , mile-high sandwiches that were three-quarters alfalfa_sprouts and nothing that required the execution of a fellow mammal . They rebelled against soulless technology and made pals with the planet again . It was the era of conscience cuisine . By the time the ' 70s were over , we were crazy for a good meal . Perhaps it was all that extremism that led to the binge mentality of the 1980s . Everyone who was anyone had to have a favorite high-end restaurant , where they dined so often that they didn ' t even need to open the menu . They knew all_the dishes by heart and made_a_point of being blase about things like skate wing and sweetbreads . Such behavior is now considered politically incorrect ; these are the lean 1990s , a decade of restraint and responsibility , of quality time and downsized expectations . So all those food-circuit big_shots are forced to find a new way to channel their power urges . And the casualties , the ones whose arteries were lined by a blanket of Brie , have become convinced that the city ' s cooks are out_to murder them by degree . The only safe haven is an off-the-menu meal . There are two kinds of troublemakers these days . The players of the last decade need to feel spoiled without seeming pretentious . A favorite story on the restaurant circuit concerns a particular character_actor who likes to go_to Italian restaurants , glance at the menu and then ask if the chef couldn ' t possibly make_up something special for him -- say , some pasta with tomatoes , garlic and basil , as though such a dish weren ' t part of the fundamental alphabet of every Italian restaurant . It ' s probably on half the menus the actor pretends to read , but asking_for_it as a special dish , and getting_it , provides the illusion that he is a singularly important fellow . And the health fascists , who could do everyone a favor and either stay home or bring their own food with them to restaurants , seem determined to make everyone bend to their will . It would be easy enough to locate the lower-fat items on a menu and stick_with those , but a considerable number of these folks want to have their cake , eat it too -- and not have it show_up on their cholesterol test . More_than one chef has had requests for risotto with no butter or oil , which is something like asking_for a brick wall , hold the mortar . The most frustrating diner is the classic Los Angeles hybrid , the one who acts like a Pritikin devotee for the first two courses and then undoes all his good deeds come dessert . One Drago customer , who took the long view , ordered a salad with dressing on the side and pasta with smoked salmon , vodka and cream , but without the cream , just so he could dive into the tiramisu with abandon . Another asked if she could have a decaf tiramisu ; she didn ' t want the espresso-soaked dessert to keep her awake at night . ( Italian restaurants are particularly vulnerable to the revisionist eater . They ' re victims of_their_own image : Italian cuisine is accessible , informal , healthy ; it ' s far less intimidating than the last decade ' s darling , classic French cuisine . And Los Angeles diners are particularly enthusiastic about altering menu reality ; maybe it ' s that pioneer spirit . &quot; They ' re spoiled , &quot; says Celestino Drago , owner of Drago in Santa Monica . &quot; In New York , it is what it is -- take it or leave it . This is Hollywood -- everybody ' s used to getting what they want. &quot; ) Food has become the image toy of the 1990s ; people fool_around with it just to prove that they can . Whenever I hear someone loudly instructing the waiter -- or , more aggressively , the chef , who ' s been summoned tableside for a public humiliation -- about what he wants to eat , I wonder . Does he really like a combination of smoked clams and shellfish because it tastes good ? Or does he like it because it ' s not on the menu ? I mean , think_about what he ' s saying . He ' s telling the chef that nothing he ' s serving is good_enough , that his years of experience and study pale next to a customer ' s imagination . And the dressing-down is public ; everyone within hearing distance knows that this diner is important enough to demand attention . I suppose there ' s a nice democratic edge to all_of this . Unlike more ostentatious trinkets , like a big BMW or an outsize house , a custom-built meal is something almost anyone can afford -- you can assert yourself at the local trattoria as easily as at a more chic eatery . Maybe that ' s what the low-rent ' 90s are all about . It ' s the people ' s decade . Anyone can have an attitude . * It wasn ' t always this way , of course . In the halcyon days of the restaurant boom , back in the early 1980s , diners worshiped at the whisk of a favored chef . Cooks could be bullies , then . And to be fair , some of them were . Waiters took orders as though they were listening for secret passwords . If you ordered smart , you were treated well ; if you ordered what they thought was a wrong combination , you were barely tolerated . Diners gratefully ate what was offered and impressed their friends with their ability to pronounce the names of the dishes . Chefs were celebrities ; they knew best . Mark Peel is now the chef and co-owner of Campanile with his wife , pastry chef and baker Nancy Silverton , but he recalls with relish his days as an angry young_man , working_at Ma Maison when Wolfgang Puck was the chef . Puck often served lamb , and every now and then a hapless diner would incur the staff ' s disdain by requesting mint jelly , a clear sign of an unenlightened palate . One employee brought_in a little bottle of the stuff as a joke , and soon after , a waiter noticed it and asked if he could serve it . With the jar in plain sight , Puck politely explained that the restaurant did not have any mint jelly . The waiter persisted . Again , Puck apologized . Just to make trouble , Peel said , &quot; But Wolf , it ' s right here. &quot; Puck picked_up the mint jelly and threw it against a tile wall , where it shattered . Mint jelly dripped down to the floor . Puck smiled at the waiter and said he was sorry . There was no mint jelly at Ma Maison . But those days are gone forever . The balance_of_power has shifted . If diners sometimes used to pay_for the privilege of feeling like a fool , now they can pay_for the chance to act like one . People go_out to eat less often than they used to , so when they do decide to splurge , the chef had better be ready to accommodate their wishes . Peel , now older and more diplomatic , offers a butterflied , grilled chicken seasoned with cracked pepper , fennel_seed , cumin and spicy chile on his menu . He gets orders for it steamed , no skin , no salt , no fat , which he grudgingly fills . But surrender can backfire . &quot; You hear them when they ' re leaving , complaining that they don ' t know what the fuss was all about ; the food was so bland , &quot; he says , with a rueful laugh . &quot; Of course it ' s bland . They took_away all_the things that make_it taste good . They could have ordered it the way we cook it and then just take the skin off themselves. &quot; His wife has a shorter fuse . When a customer requested a scoop of chocolate_ice_cream on top of her lemon tart , Silverton sent the waiter back , twice , to gently suggest that while these were the woman ' s two favorite flavors , they would not be a happy mix . The woman refused to back_down , so Silverton did . The very memory makes her wince . &quot; There are times , &quot; she sighs , &quot; when I ' ve been tempted to say , ' Forget it. ' But then I think , ' Just turn your back and give them what they want. ' &quot; Piero Selvaggio , who opened Valentino , his first restaurant , in 1972 , has become a specialist in the culinary non_sequitur : He ' s taken orders for risotto porcini with the mushrooms on the side , gnocchi with Gorgonzola cheese with the cheese on the side ( &quot; I just like to mix_in the cheese myself , &quot; customers say ) and a veal chop in orange_juice and Grand Marnier . His chef made a pasta_sauce of orange_juice and tomato_sauce for one man who loved the results so_much that he wondered why Selvaggio didn ' t immediately add the dish to the menu . Selvaggio has been at it long enough to develop a sense_of_humor about such requests , but mostly he feels sorry_for people who miss tasting a dish the way it was meant to be made . &quot; Risotto with no butter ? &quot; he asks . &quot; How can you swim and not be in the water ? Someone thinks you can do the whole_thing with olive_oil , but he misses the thick moistness that butter brings. &quot; The one-shot diner can be frustrating , but it ' s the repeat offenders who make life truly difficult for the restaurateur . How do you tell your regular customers that they don ' t know what ' s good for them ? Selvaggio dubbed one twice-weekly diner &quot; Our Lady of the Overcooked Vermicelli , &quot; because no matter how long the chef boiled the angel hair pasta before he mixed in the pesto , it wasn ' t long enough . He indulged her for years , but on what turned_out to be her last visit she was particularly demanding . &quot; We ran it under the hot water a_few times and took it back and she still said it wasn ' t right , &quot; recalls Selvaggio . &quot; I can ' t go_back to a professional chef and say , ' Cook this more. ' He ' ll say , ' Cook what ? ' &quot; He decided to sacrifice a customer : &quot; For the first time in 20 years , I said , ' Look , we just can ' t please you. ' &quot; Selvaggio never saw her again , except for one visit , when she was a guest at a large dinner hosted by someone else . &quot; Sometimes , &quot; he sighs , &quot; you have to ask , ' Are we Valentino or a house_of_prostitution ? ' &quot; * Now that I ' ve insulted every finicky diner in the greater Los Angeles area , let me defend your rights -- within reason . Not the power rangers ; they get high on pushing people around , and the only consolation chefs have is the knowledge that they aren ' t the only ones being hassled . The same person who snubs a chef undoubtedly exhibits disdain for his mechanic , his doctor , his agent and anybody else who ' s technically in a service_industry . But people with health_problems have a real issue to face . No one is suggesting that you have to order the pasta in vodka and cream if you ' re are a teetotaler with a family history of heart_disease . I understand limitations . My husband is allergic to onions unless they ' ve been cooked forever . My dad , who was diabetic , had to plot his day ' s diet in_advance just to be able to eat a scoop of ice_cream at dinner . Sometimes , people just have to make small adjustments . But with luck , we can inspire a chef to come_up with a dish he wants to make again . Tonino Morra , Pasquale ' s older brother and the owner of Caffe Toto in West Los Angeles , was the pizza chef at Il Forno when a regular customer came_in , devastated by a doctor ' s recommendation that he forgo pizza in deference to his cholesterol count . The man had a pizza jones . He implored Tonino to make a pie that would n ' t kill him . So Tonino invented a pizza with tomato_sauce , no cheese , lots of basil , garlic and shiitake_mushrooms -- and named it Pizza Ken after the customer ( who , ever grateful , has followed him to his new digs ) . Other customers saw it , tried it , liked it and order it whether they need to or not . If you believe that fat is the_devil in oleaginous form , by all means pick a dish that seems light on the oil and butter -- or buy a copy of &quot; Healthy Dining in Los Angeles , &quot; which analyzes dishes at 85 area restaurants -- and order strictly by the numbers . But there ' s a difference between reasonable caution and fundamental conservatism . Fear of the unknown : It ' s the one thing that big_shots and health hard-liners have in common . They just don ' t want to take_a_chance . I always knew I disliked Roy Cohn , the House Unamerican Activities Committee lawyer , but what clinched it for me was the revelation that he brought his own can of tuna when he lunched at New York ' s Le Cirque -- and the chef accommodated him by opening the can and plopping the tuna on a plate . This is not about lunch or taste buds or health . This is about control and the false safety of habit . It is not dining_out . A restaurant is supposed to be an adventure . If I have one dining tenet , it ' s always to order something I would n ' t , or couldn ' t , make myself . In the days before pre-washed spinach , I ordered a lot of spinach ; let somebody else stand_up to his wet elbows in silt . I like to order duck , since my single attempt to cook that deceptively difficult bird almost lost me four good friends . And when I ' m feeling up_to the occasion , in a particularly celebratory mood , I make the one special request that chefs are happy to honor . I ask them to feed me , no strings attached , to see what they like to cook when the constraints of pleasing the crowd are removed . If something looks suspicious , I follow the rule of my childhood : Try one bite , and if you don ' t like it , you don ' t have to finish it . I would have missed a lot of great food if I ' d chickened out and ordered only the dishes that were already in my data bank . Now , I would n ' t ask any of my favorite chefs to write this piece for me . You surely would n ' t let them compose your legal_brief , negotiate your three-picture deal or fit the porcelain veneers on your most demanding celebrity patient . But that ' s my point : You have your profession . So does the cook . Trust him to make your taste buds happy .</TEXT>
