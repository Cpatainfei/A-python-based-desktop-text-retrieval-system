   <HEADLINE> PROTESTANT GROUPS WON ' T MATCH CEASE-FIRE ; NORTHERN_IRELAND : MILITANTS LOYAL TO BRITAIN SAY THEY WANT PROOF IRA IS COMMITTED TO PEACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Protestant paramilitary groups loyal to Britain issued a statement here Thursday saying they would not declare a cease-fire to match the one observed by the outlawed Irish_Republican_Army for the past week in Northern_Ireland . The Combined Loyalist Military Command , which wants continued British rule_in the province , said that before calling a cease-fire it would need proof that the IRA ' s armistice is holding and that no secret peace deals were made with the_Irish nationalists by the_British government . The group also wants guarantees that Ulster , as the Protestants call Northern_Ireland , would remain in the United Kingdom after a peace settlement . However , political observers noted that no loyalist attacks have taken_place since Sunday , and that the paramilitary groups may well be observing a de_facto cease-fire without publicly committing themselves to one . Eric Smyth , a unionist city_council member here , said of the announcement : &quot; They ' re being careful , keeping people guessing . But the very fact they used the language of cease-fire is to be welcomed. &quot; Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds , who this week held an unprecedented meeting with the IRA ' s political spokesman , Gerry Adams , had called_on the loyalists Wednesday to participate in the cease-fire . And in a message to Northern_Ireland ' s Protestants that appeared in Thursday ' s unionist Belfast Telegraph , Reynolds said : &quot; The Irish_people want no hand , act or part in any attempt to coerce or cajole a majority of the people in the north into a united Ireland against their will. &quot; Reynolds said that preparations for the all-party peace talks that London and Dublin have been trying to arrange since December included no secret paramilitary input into the &quot; framework &quot; document being readied by Britain and Ireland . At the same time , the Belfast Telegraph published what it called the first details of the framework document setting_out the two governments ' ideas for the future of Northern_Ireland . The document , the paper said , calls_for replacement of most ministers in the Northern_Ireland Office ( NIO ) with locally elected politicians , and an 85-member Assembly that would take_over most of the responsibilities now administered by the NIO . The Assembly would be responsible_for the departments_of_agriculture , environment , economic development , health and social_services , education , finance and personnel . Security would remain under the British-run NIO . The province would also have a bill of rights protecting religious freedoms , cross-border consultative bodies between Northern_Ireland and the_Irish Republic , and a commitment by Dublin to remove from the_Irish constitution territorial claims to the north .</TEXT>
