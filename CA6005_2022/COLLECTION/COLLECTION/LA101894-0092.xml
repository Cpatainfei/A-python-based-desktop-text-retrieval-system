   <HEADLINE> IN THE DANGER_ZONE ; RICHARD PRESTON WAS BORN TO TELL THE TRUE STORY OF A DEADLY VIRUS OUTBREAK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Preston has a knack for getting_into wherever he wants and coaxing information from whomever he wants . &quot; I don ' t believe that I ' m a gifted writer , but I believe I am a gifted listener , &quot; says the 40-year-old author , who is in fact both . &quot; When I talk to someone , I just keep hearing their sentences over and over in my head even when I ' m asleep . And when you get fascinated by something , people open up. &quot; His just-published bestseller , &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; ( Random House ) , is a mesmerizing real-life variation on &quot; Andromeda Strain &quot; about a near-catastrophic outbreak of a tropical virus called Ebola Reston in suburban Virginia in 1989 . To bring the story to life , Preston needed to persuade the Army -- not exactly dying to rehash biological threats -- to cooperate extensively . For instance , Preston wanted to experience a &quot; Level 4 &quot; virus hot room . Level 4 viruses such_as Ebola Reston are by definition lethal , highly contagious , have no cure and no vaccine . ( By comparison , anthrax is a_Level 2 virus ; HIV , a_Level 3. ) Because a terrorist who obtained a test_tube of Level 4 virus could hold a city hostage , there are only two containment labs that work with them -- both highly secure and open only to a handful of specially trained epidemiologists clad in spacesuits . But in 1993 , when Preston asked USAMRIID ( pronounced &quot; You Sam Rid &quot; ) , the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious_Diseases in Frederick , Md. , to let him take a peek at theirs , they obliged . &quot; Actually they were reluctant to let me in less for security reasons than because people tend to panic in there , &quot; Preston says . &quot; An earlier visitor suffered an attack of claustrophobia and ripped his helmet off and they had to give him an emergency decon ( decontamination ) shower. &quot; Born in Cambridge , Mass. , to a lawyer father and a mother who taught art history , Preston graduated in 1977 from Pomona College , which he loved , majoring in English . Stuck on what to do next , he went east to Princeton_University as a graduate_student . There he met his wife , Michelle , and settled_down . Today they have three children , ages 6 months to 5 years . Since then , all Preston has done for a living is write , beginning in Princeton ' s development office , ignominiously &quot; ghost-writing letters to corporations and wealthy people begging for money , &quot; a task one can imagine him excelling_at . &quot; What I learned about people I learned from my mother . She was like the unofficial caseworker of Wellesley , Mass. , where we lived . She would get deeply involved in people ' s lives and become deeply sympathetic to them . I learned that skill of being able to lose oneself , wash_away oneself , enter into the mind of someone else . You project into their mind and see the world as they see it. &quot; Moving_on to more substantial game , Preston brought his ingenuous smile , his permanent look of sympathy crossbred with enthusiasm , and his perpetually ready memo pads to astronomers working_on Caltech ' s Hale telescope in &quot; First_Light &quot; ( Atlantic Monthly Press , 1987 ) and then to metalworkers looking_for a new way to pour sheet steel in &quot; American Steel &quot; in 1991 . &quot; First_Light &quot; earned him $ 45 # 000 . &quot; American Steel , &quot; published by a division of Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. then in the process of dissolving , made more_than $ 100 # 000 , but there were still times , he says , when he didn ' t have mortgage money . &quot; The advance comes_in and for a while you ' re living pretty well , &quot; he says . &quot; And then the money runs out. &quot; So nothing prepared him for the enthusiasm that would race through the literary world and Hollywood beginning in the fall of 1992 , when the New Yorker published the article that would grow_into &quot; The Hot Zone. &quot; * Now he sits in the house that &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; built -- six bedrooms in suburban Princeton , N.J. The living room is large with a stone fireplace and extensive collections of John McPhee and A.J. Liebling , both nonfiction writers whom , along with Henry Thoreau , Preston particularly admires . Dressed in a gray shirt , blue_jeans , brown loafers and white socks a la perennial grad_student , hair tousled and prematurely gray , the boyish Preston wolfs_down a piece of pizza , drinks a glass of wine and seems unfazed by the piece of animal spleen loaded with deadly Ebola virus particles -- sterilized and shielded by acrylic plastic to be sure -- that sits nearby as a souvenir from an Army friend . On his oak mantelpiece are a drinking bowl from Lake Turkana and an East African gourd , both of which he bought_in Nairobi where he went_in the fall of 1993 to visit Kitum Cave , the suspected host site for the Marburg virus , which is closely related to Ebola . He dressed in a portable spacesuit , entered the caves and found . . . nothing . &quot; I admit the book would have had a better ending if I ' d blown_up with the virus , &quot; he says . Instead , &quot; my heart just pounded. &quot; The long route that led Preston , dressed like the Michelin man , to an obscure Kenyan cave likely carved by the tusks of salt-seeking elephants has a complex beginning . Like the rest of the world , Preston had paid scant attention to a syndicated 1989 article about an outbreak of a rare virus among a group of medical research monkeys in Virginia . Fearing that the virus might get_out into the suburban population , USAMRIID had quietly seized the building and decontaminated it , killing about 500 monkeys in the process , a gruesome and elaborate episode that Preston handles in the book without blinking . &quot; I ' m not callous to suffering , &quot; he says , &quot; but I ' m a journalist and I have to describe accurately. &quot; Ebola Reston , as the virus was later named , turned_out to be a_Level 4 virus , a relative of Ebola Zaire , one of the most virulent viruses ever to strike humanity . But thanks to some skillful Army subterfuge and fourth-estate laziness , no one got the connection between an animal-euthanizing operation in a suburban office park and the reality that for those few weeks , several million lives around Washington , D.C. , were at risk . &quot; The truth is by the time I called , basically the Army had started to forget Reston , &quot; Preston says . &quot; They had not gotten a lot of attention for what they had done , and they were extremely happy that they had gone_in there and done_it without a lot of people getting killed and the Army getting blamed for some sort of bio-disaster. &quot; Preston had forgotten the clipping , too , but the subject preoccupied him more generally . He believed it was just a matter of time before a virus emerged from the fast-diminishing rain_forest and , in the language of epidemiology , &quot; burned &quot; its way through the overpopulated planet . &quot; I was drawn . . . by a general sense of talking around in the scientific community that the AIDS virus is the tip of the iceberg , &quot; he says . That was when expert virologists reminded him of the Reston outbreak and he picked_up the phone and called USAMRIID . &quot; They didn ' t know who I was or what I wanted , &quot; he says . &quot; My first phone_call in 1992 caused a lot of nervousness . There ' s a natural gut level mistrust of journalists in the Army . They want to know what your agenda is. &quot; He was granted a single interview with the husband and wife who led the decontamination mission , Col . Jerry and Lt . Col . Nancy Jaax , the chief veterinarian and pathologist of USAMRIID respectively , who would be major figures in the book . They provided him with the story and , more importantly , with characters . &quot; I decided instantly after doing the interview with Jerry , Nancy and also Peter Jahrling ( a USAMRIID civilian who has the name of his favorite deadly virus on his license_plate ) , I wanted to write the story . I don ' t think they had an awareness of just how interesting the Reston crisis and their work was . The basic outlines of the book all came_out in that interview , their autobiographies and their sense of their interior life. &quot; Preston told the New Yorker magazine , with which he had an informal , longstanding relationship , of his project and got his expenses covered . It was the story he was born to write . &quot; What I ' m passionately interested in is not science but American lives , &quot; he explains , &quot; and I especially love to write_about people whose lives appear normal but are actually deeply atypical , like the Jaaxes . &quot; I was struck by how the officers involved in this mission went_home to perfectly normal homes . And I think it was fascinating that USAMRIID soldiers ( whose basic job is to look_after livestock being held for vaccine research ) went_into a place the Army Rangers would have been scared to go_into . &quot; I also love to explore the zone of contact between nature and human_beings . All my books are about that in one way or another. &quot; A gift for putting science into layman ' s prose and a sharp eye for detail stood Preston in good stead working_on his magazine_article , one of the most admired pieces of its year and a finalist for a National Magazine Award . Preston ' s agent soon sold &quot; Crisis in the Hot Zone , &quot; with its title shortened by two words and its length expanded by a factor of six , to Random House for about $ 350 # 000 . In publishing , you takes your money and you makes your tour , but Preston , slated for a 15-city jag , offered to cancel if his wife found being at_home alone with their three small children too onerous . As spouses generally do_in such moments , she declined . * And then Hollywood came calling . In a widely reported story , &quot; Crisis in the Hot Zone &quot; engendered a nasty footrace between 20th Century Fox , which optioned it for director Ridley Scott and actors Robert Redford and Jodie Foster , and a competing Warner Bros . project from an original script set to star Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo . Tension over whom the script should feature derailed Fox ' s project , leaving Preston with the $ 100 # 000 option money and considerable bitterness . He calls the Warner Bros . picture &quot; a high-budget rip-off , &quot; adding : &quot; My feelings are that my lawyers are going_to watch very carefully and see what ' s going_to happen. &quot; But even the knowledge that someone is likely to make tens of millions of dollars at his expense doesn ' t much tamp his enthusiasm . He has had a career year , giving him a margin of economic safety for the first time , and more time for backpacking and canoeing . Preston came_home from his fast ride through &quot; The Hot Zone &quot; with one other rather unwelcome_guest as well : a touch of hypochondria . &quot; I find myself feeling a little apprehensive now when in an enclosed space with a lot of strange people , &quot; he says . &quot; I don ' t much like traveling on the subway anymore. &quot; Given the likely success of the book , it ' s unlikely he ' ll have to .</TEXT>
