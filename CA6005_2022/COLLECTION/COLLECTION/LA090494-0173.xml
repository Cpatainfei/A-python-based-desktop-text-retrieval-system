   <HEADLINE> MOVIES ; UNMASKING ERIC STOLTZ ; THE ACTOR , WHO HAS FOUR FILMS DUE OUT BY YEAR ' S END , PREFERS EXPLORING HIS DARK SIDE TO THE BOY-NEXT-DOOR ROLES OF HIS EARLY CAREER . FACE IT , VILLAINS ARE MORE FUN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Laziness , actor Eric Stoltz maintains , is an underrated virtue . On an ideal day , he ' d read newspapers in bed , lunch with friends , indulge in some mid-afternoon sex , and cap_off dinner with a really great film . Still , with four of_his_own movies surfacing by the end of the year -- and three more in 1995 -- it ' s a case of &quot; do as I say . . . not as I do. &quot; The actor appears as an ex-junkie / bank robber in &quot; Killing Zoe , &quot; which opened last month , and as Meg Tilly ' s misogynistic husband in MGM ' s &quot; Sleep With Me , &quot; due Sept . 23 . He plays a heroin dealer in Quentin Tarantino ' s &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; and a suspected murderer in &quot; Fluke. &quot; Only the role of an angel in &quot; God ' s Army &quot; and another in the holiday release &quot; Little Women &quot; recall the early Stoltz -- a wholesome , slightly gawky boy next door . &quot; The Waterdance &quot; ( 1992 ) , in which Stoltz played an embittered paraplegic , was the turning point . Surrounded by actors with parts more flamboyant than his , the actor emerged as the anchor for the picture that won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival and two Independent Spirit Awards for best picture and screenplay . &quot; People started looking_at the kid in ' Mask ' as an adult , &quot; observes Tarantino . &quot; For all his intensity , Eric never had ' edge. ' Now he does . He ' s on ' the list. ' He ' s cool. &quot; In fact , Stoltz is anything but cool sitting poolside at a Westside hotel , having his picture taken during a record-setting heat_wave . A dark green suit and crisp white shirt set_off red shoulder-length hair and a goatee he ' s sporting for a part in &quot; Rob Roy , &quot; an 18th-Century adventure now shooting with Liam Neeson and Jessica Lange in Scotland . His humor is dry and self-deprecating . ( &quot; My role ? To make Neeson look bigger and more handsome. &quot; ) His manner is gentle and unfailingly polite . ( &quot; You must think I ' m the black_hole of hotel guests , &quot; he remarks to the front desk after losing his second room key in two days. ) * &quot; Other actors of his generation , most notably the Brat Pack , went_for big roles in bigger pictures , &quot; observes director Michael Steinberg ( &quot; The Waterdance , &quot; &quot; Bodies , Rest &amp; Motion &quot; ) , who also co-produced &quot; Sleep With Me. &quot; &quot; But Eric distanced himself by sidestepping the obvious . Ironically , his approach seems to have worked . He ' s here -- and they ' re not. &quot; Still , two_dozen films to his credit , the 32-year-old Stoltz is one step removed from a household name . &quot; I ' m often mistaken for ( World Cup soccer player ) Alexi Lalas and , until recently , for ( late Nirvana lead singer ) Kurt Cobain , &quot; the actor acknowledges . &quot; Without facial hair , people confuse me with Jodie Foster or Suzy Amis. &quot; When it comes_to choosing roles , gut rather than pocketbook predominates . Stoltz is as open_to ensemble pieces as_to bravura parts . If possible , some of each year is reserved for the stage . A regular on the Off Broadway scene , where he played a serial_killer in last year ' s &quot; Down the Road , &quot; the actor won a Tony nomination for his 1988 Broadway debut as The Everyman , George Gibbs , in Thornton Wilder ' s &quot; Our Town. &quot; &quot; I ' m not a career builder , &quot; Stoltz says . &quot; I ' ve never plotted out how to become a ' marketable persona. ' Poor Creative Artists ( Agency ) , God love ' em , they ' ve accepted me for what I am . They channel the billion-dollar scripts Tom Cruise ' s way and send the smaller , independent films to me . I have homes_in Manhattan , New Mexico and L.A. , but I don ' t live high on the hog . I haven ' t owned a TV since 1979 . I rented a tux for the Tony Awards. &quot; So why ' s a nice guy like this playing such sleazeballs ? For one thing , he ' s maturing , getting_in_touch with the darker elements of his personality . Besides , he suggests , playing villains is more fun . &quot; Darker roles are very appealing to me , &quot; Stoltz says , taking a sip of blood-red orange_juice . &quot; Since most of the evil people I ' ve met are quite charming , it ' s a challenge to paint them in shades of gray . What ' s fun about acting is that you get_to behave outside the bounds of societal rules . Much healthier to do_it in a ' Pulp Fiction ' or a ' Killing Zoe ' instead of in real life. &quot; No chance those images could lead to violence instead of diffusing it ? &quot; Only psychopaths can ' t distinguish between story and reality , &quot; Stoltz shoots back . &quot; Keep antisocial behavior out of movies and you end_up with fluff -- happy-go-lucky stuff they show on airplanes. &quot; Some critics have lashed into the amoral violence of &quot; Killing Zoe , &quot; a tale in which Stoltz , an American safecracker with a quasi-humanist streak , is drawn into a heist planned by some drug-crazed Parisians . Stoltz prefers to see it as a psychedelic fable -- a cross between &quot; Alice in Wonderland &quot; and Roger Corman ' s &quot; Bloody Mama , &quot; both of which propel an innocent into a world of madness . First-time director Roger Avary wrote the role with Stoltz in mind , much to the amazement -- and skepticism -- of the powers-that-be . &quot; No one wanted to see Eric , &quot; recalls Tarantino , who executive-produced the film . &quot; I got a script to him after running_into him on the street . Though Eric was annoyed when a reviewer accused him of doing a Mickey Rourke impersonation , that ' s not really off-base . His performance in ' Zoe ' was an unconscious homage to Mickey Rourke-style roles -- that don ' t-give-a- ( expletive ) attitude delivered in a tough monotone. &quot; To prepare_for the role , Stoltz hung_out with a junkie to observe speech_patterns and body movement . He dug even deeper on other films . For &quot; The Waterdance , &quot; the actor remained in a wheelchair for two months , refusing to get_up even at the director ' s request . For &quot; Mask &quot; ( 1985 ) , he wore his makeup in public to get a sense of the ridicule his character -- a severely deformed adolescent -- had endured . The 22-year-old Stoltz was changed by the experience . He saw what human nature was like -- and it wasn ' t a pretty picture . &quot; Eric walked_around in 105-degree heat in makeup which took four hours to apply , &quot; recalls &quot; Mask &quot; director Peter Bogdanovich . &quot; Fake teeth prevented him from eating solid foods so he lost a lot of weight . I started_out as an actor and used to pride myself on not asking an actor to do anything I would n ' t have done . But that wasn ' t possible with him . He deserved a Purple_Heart for that role. &quot; What sets him apart , Bogdanovich observes , is a keen intelligence ( &quot; Some actors , you have to put glasses on &quot; ) , good instincts and those remarkably blue eyes . &quot; Eric has very expressive , beautiful eyes that are able to convey a lot , &quot; the director explains . &quot; that ' s what the part needed because there wasn ' t anything else . After one scene , I yelled , ' Cut ! , ' and cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs commented to me : ' He just wrote a sentence with his eyes. ' The picture would have been unthinkable without him but instead of riding its success , Eric went_off to Paris , where he lived for a_couple_of years. &quot; As passionate as Stoltz is about the work , say his colleagues , he ' s able to disengage . On the set of &quot; The Waterdance &quot; -- a low-budget , intense shoot in need of some levity -- he was the cheerleader / court jester . He ' s regarded_as an inveterate &quot; teaser , &quot; fond of testing people to find their limits . &quot; Eric ' s a bit of Peck ' s Bad Boy , &quot; says &quot; Waterdance &quot; co-star Helen Hunt ( TV ' s &quot; Mad About You &quot; ) . &quot; I was the only woman working around a group of men in wheelchairs who viewed me from waist-height . He took full advantage . . . but only because he knew I ' d come_back strong. &quot; Like last year ' s &quot; Bodies , Rest &amp; Motion , &quot; a Generation X comedy in which Stoltz played a house_painter , Rory Kelly ' s &quot; Sleep With Me &quot; targets relationships in the ' 90s -- in this case , the complications posed for three friends when one ( Craig Sheffer ) falls_in_love with the other ' s wife ( Meg Tilly ) . The project got its start in a Manhattan bar where Stoltz and some pals were ruminating about life and love . Originally intended as an up scale home_movie -- a $ 10 # 000 16-millimeter black-and-white affair shot for fun or possibly film festivals -- the picture changed_course when Tilly signed_on . Shoot it in 35mm , the money men said , and the financing is yours . Two months later , the $ 3-million shoot was under way . During the rather unorthodox script-writing phase , each of six writers was assigned a scene and briefed on the points to be covered . Characters were based on people they knew . The actors worked for peanuts . &quot; It was like guerrilla filmmaking in a commune , &quot; Tilly recalls . &quot; We clasped hands and jumped_off without knowing if our parachutes would hold_up . But at least we ' d die with great people . Eric is unusual , more successful than 99 % of the actors I know . It ' s not about selling tickets but about having your head on straight . He has his own personal boundaries . He ' s not a diarrhea-mouth who spills everything out. &quot; Stoltz admits to being shy , which is one reason he turned_to acting . Hiding behind a character not only makes_it easier to reveal oneself , he observes , but that much safer to explore . The topics investigated in &quot; Sleep With Me &quot; -- marriage , infidelity , friendship , lust -- struck a particular chord . Like many Hollywood romances , his four-year relationship with actress Bridget Fonda ( &quot; Point of No Return , &quot; &quot; It Could Happen to You &quot; ) is a bit of a high-wire act -- on the heels of some difficult and failed relationships . Though they worked together on &quot; Singles &quot; and &quot; Bodies , Rest &amp; Motion &quot; and visit each other on the set , the &quot; migrant worker &quot; lifestyle and &quot; predatory co-stars , &quot; says the actor , take a toll . &quot; You ' re in different cities , different environments . . . usually romantic , &quot; Stoltz begins . &quot; You ' re encouraged to disconnect from reality . And many of your co-stars feel it ' s their right to seduce you -- whether you have a relationship off the set or not . &quot; I ' m not above it , &quot; he adds . &quot; I had a_few on-the-set romances myself when I was in my 20s . Dumb , but understandable . Actors and rock_stars are treated like gods in our culture and some begin to think they ' re beyond reproach . They ' re often charming , talented people who just weren ' t raised right. &quot; That certainly wasn ' t the case with Stoltz , however , a native Angeleno whose early years were a curious mix of &quot; Leave It to Beaver &quot; and &quot; South Pacific. &quot; Mom was a first-grade teacher , dad a high_school principal . When Eric was 3 , they took him and his two older sisters to live_in American_Samoa , returning to Santa Barbara when he was 8 . As a child , young Eric fell_in with the Santa Barbara theater crowd , playing the piano for local productions and road_shows . Because music was so solitary , however , he refocused his sights on acting . By the time he enrolled at USC in 1979 , he had appeared in nearly 50 plays . Frustrated by the regimentation of college and itching to see the world , Stoltz dropped_out of school in 1981 . He then hooked_up_with a troupe performing repertory at the Edinburgh Festival , where he stayed until he was broke . Back in Hollywood , Stoltz won a role as a surfer in Amy Heck erling ' s &quot; Fast Times at Ridgemont High &quot; ( 1982 ) . The film , he says , was &quot; one long party , &quot; and the celebrants included such soon-to-be-stars as Nicolas Cage , Forest Whitaker , Phoebe Cates and Jennifer Jason Leigh , with whom he later became involved . After completing &quot; The Wild Life &quot; -- the first of his four collaborations with Cameron Crowe ( &quot; I was his mascot &quot; ) -- Stoltz landed the lead in &quot; Back to the Future. &quot; His euphoria proved short-lived , however , when director Robert Zemeckis fired him and replaced him with Michael J . Fox three weeks into the shoot . Stoltz says it was a &quot; brutal &quot; time -- fired without warning from his first big film . Though Zemeckis took full responsibility for miscasting him , the actor was so shaken that he headed straight to acting class . &quot; Zemeckis told me I was giving a good performance in a film he didn ' t want to make . . . contemplative and thoughtful instead of comedic , &quot; the actor recalls . &quot; I felt I could have done the part had he pointed me in that direction. &quot; &quot; Mask ' s &quot; success took the edge off his pain . Scripts came pouring in . Hollywood executives , curious about how he looked without makeup , came_to check him out . Life , too , has provided perspective -- most notably , the death of his 67-year-old mother from cancer three months ago . &quot; Getting fired ? Nothing comes_close to dealing with death , &quot; Stoltz maintains . &quot; Life would be so_much fun if we didn ' t have to contend with that at the end of it . I ' m still reeling , stunned , confused . The loss is so profound and all-encompassing that it ' s hard to see beyond it. &quot; The actor rubs his goatee and lowers his gaze . &quot; Sorry . . . the sorrow just comes_over me , &quot; he says softly . &quot; Right now , it ' s about getting_up in the morning and sleeping through the night . Not thinking but accepting. &quot; Stoltz has an easier time discuss ing producing , an area in which , in a rare burst of immodesty , he concedes he ' s &quot; pretty good. &quot; Since none of the other producers of &quot; Bodies , Rest &amp; Motion &quot; had made a film before , his production debut was a &quot; trial by fire. &quot; Co-producing &quot; Sleep With Me , &quot; however , was considerably more comfortable . &quot; In a way , it ' s a relief to be_on that side of the camera , &quot; the actor says . &quot; You don ' t have to look good and you can go_home and forget about work and that obscene hierarchy of egos . Still , acting and producing simultaneously creates a lot of headaches . One moment you ' re concerned about losing the light . The next , you ' re proposing to Meg ( Tilly ) , forced to be romantic when you ' re really furious and anxious inside . I have enormous respect for people like Clint Eastwood who can do_it all at once. &quot; Though directing is of no immediate interest to Stoltz , writer-director Neil Jimenez ( &quot; The Waterdance &quot; ) regards him as a natural-born filmmaker . &quot; Eric is very aware of how a movie is put_together , where he fits_in the story , &quot; he explains . &quot; He ' s not out_to build_up his character or shove himself into scenes in which he doesn ' t belong . Eric can put vanity on the middle burner , if not the back one . that ' s a rare trait in an actor -- or anyone , for that matter. &quot; Though Stoltz has made five films since &quot; Sleep With Me , &quot; he bucks the label &quot; workaholic. &quot; When it comes_to his career , he insists , he has very little control . &quot; I planted some garden_plants in the wrong place four or five years ago , &quot; Stoltz says , by way of explanation , &quot; and every once in awhile they bloom . There were 40 flowers a_few months ago and now , for no apparent reason , there are two . I always tend it but it has a life of its own . My career has a similar dynamic. &quot; Though he loved living_out of a suitcase in his 20s , Stoltz says , he now has to work_up the energy to go_to Scotland for three months . He has less sense of adventure and doesn ' t know how to rectify that . Still , there ' s little evidence , on the face of it , that the actor will be pulling_back . He dreams of tackling Shakespeare -- on stage or on film . And he ' d like to hook_up_with the &quot; usual suspects &quot; -- Brian De Palma , Martin Scorsese , Stanley Kubrick and Terence Malick -- before checking out . All well and good , says Stoltz pal and collaborator Michael Steinberg . Just don ' t go &quot; mainstream &quot; and leave us in the dust . &quot; Sundance this year could have been renamed ' The Eric Stoltz Film Festival , ' &quot; the director quips . &quot; On every picture I ' ve done , he ' s gotten the ball rolling . Without him , a lot of directors would have a hard_time getting work . &quot; Any book on independent filmmaking should begin with a chapter entitled : ' Get a Good Script. ' Chapter 2 should be ' Show It to Eric Stoltz. ' &quot;</TEXT>
