   <HEADLINE> BLACK LEADERS VOW UNITED FRONT TO TACKLE PROBLEMS ; CIVIL RIGHTS : PLANNED ALLIANCE WILL TARGET YOUTH , URBAN ILLS . FARRAKHAN TONES_DOWN HIS RHETORIC AT THREE-DAY SUMMIT ORGANIZED BY THE NAACP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a rare show of unity , a host of African American leaders , ranging from the controversial Louis Farrakhan to the mainstream Jesse Jackson , pledged to form a coalition Monday to seek solutions to some of the problems that bedevil black youths and black urban communities . To achieve this unity , Nation of Islam leader Farrakhan , denounced often by outsiders for a drumbeat of what seems like anti-Semitism and anti-white sentiment in his speeches , spoke in somewhat conciliatory tones and effusively praised the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People for convening the three-day National African-American Leadership Summit , which closes today . Noting that many outsiders had objected to the invitation extended_to him by the NAACP , Farrakhan said : &quot; This is a family matter , and I am a member of our family. &quot; Speaking at a meeting in Dunbar Community High_School in Baltimore that was televised nationally by Black Entertainment Television , Farrakhan said : &quot; The NAACP is the oldest , most credible civil_rights organization in this country . I ' m a life member of the NAACP . . . So I don ' t believe I ' m a stranger . I ' ve been invited into a house that belongs , in part , to me. &quot; Alluding to threats to boycott the NAACP for inviting him , Farrakhan said : &quot; You cannot punish us for coming_together as a family . . . If anyone threatens us because we are coming_together , then we will deal with it at the appropriate time. &quot; Jackson , who has campaigned in the past for the Democratic Party nomination for President , looked uncomfortable with some of the rhetoric in the auditorium and tried to temper it from time to time . Jackson objected when John_Henry Clark , a popular historian , called_on African Americans to help stamp_out white power in South_Africa . Clark told the audience that President Nelson Mandela does not really rule South_Africa because its economy and infrastructure were still in the hands of the whites . &quot; South_Africa will be free in the only way it can be free , &quot; Clark said to thunderous applause . &quot; People spilled your blood to take your country . You ' re going to have to spill the blood to take it back. &quot; &quot; I do not accept his conclusion , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; . . . I believe an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth and a life for a life leaves you blind , disfigured and dead . Someone has to stop the killing. &quot; But there were few conflicts like this in the two-hour meeting that included statements from a dozen African American leaders and a_few questions from viewers and members of the audience . Benjamin F . Chavis Jr. , the NAACP executive_director who conceived the idea of the summit , said that the leaders had already decided that the coalition would continue after the summit and would meet again . Although the meetings were closed to the news media , Chavis said that the leaders had been discussing empowerment of black youth , economic development of black communities and spiritual uplift . &quot; We must develop African American businesses and support them when they are developed , &quot; Chavis said . The leaders may offer more details about their goals when the summit closes .</TEXT>
