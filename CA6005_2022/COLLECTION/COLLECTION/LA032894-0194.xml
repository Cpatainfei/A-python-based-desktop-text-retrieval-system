   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / JULIE CART ; WORLD CUP ' 94 REPORT REVEALS 1993 FINANCES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The ongoing saga of World Cup ' 94 ' s books , and who has the right to review them , continues . But at least some critics were hushed when World Cup President Alan Rothenberg on March 22 released the Organizing Committee ' s 1993 financial_statements to the World Cup ' s board of directors and to state association presidents of the U.S. Soccer Federation . The figures , while not noting specifically where the money was spent , are revealing . According to the revised budget report ending Dec . 31 , 1993 , the single-largest revenue source was from ticket sales , more_than $ 90 million . The single-largest expense was some $ 20 million for general management , presumably staff salaries , etc . Fixed and variable expenses came_out to $ 20 million , and professional fees for the year cost $ 8.6 million . Special projects cost $ 9.2 million . Accounts receivable shows $ 15 million for the Premier Ticket program . By World Cup ' s own projections , based on selling 100 % of the Premier Ticket base packages , the net_profit from the program will be nearly $ 140 million . The balance_sheet shows &quot; advances to Major_League Prof . Soccer &quot; in the amount of $ 932 # 000 for the year . World Cup lists its current assets as $ 64.8 million . In a letter to soccer officials , Rothenberg again pledges a surplus of $ 20 to $ 25 million , to be used to provide a legacy for soccer in the United States . From the looks of things , that is likely to be a vastly underestimated figure . * Interior ministers of seven European_nations sent_out mixed signals last week in a flap about World Cup security arrangements . At a meeting of European_nations in Brussels , the minister of justice for Ireland suggested that police in the United States lack the experience to handle hooligans and other potential soccer-related problems . Having said that , the European officials then refused to provide the very information that could help World Cup security keep the peace . At least seven nations said they would refuse to provide American authorities with lists of known hooligans . Police officials in many countries keep lists of hooligans -- persons convicted of crimes involving soccer violence . Such lists are passed all around the Continent before matches where there is potential for trouble . Hooligan lists were provided to the organizers of the 1990 World Cup in Italy and also to organizers of the 1993 U.S. Cup . The list helped authorities detain English hooligans at Logan Airport in Boston and preempt trouble . Now these lists are sacred documents ? &quot; We ' re not going_to be stool_pigeons , &quot; said the Belgian interior minister . Perhaps the Belgian minister forgot that his team is in the same group as the_Netherlands , a nation with a reputation for wonderful soccer players and some misbehaving fans . What the European ministers missed but should have noted with dismay was the Los Angeles police union ' s launching of an anti-tourism campaign , timed to disrupt the World Cup . Officers have been working without a contract for 21 months and , in_order to force the situation , have been mailing letters and brochures around the country and world warning visitors &quot; not to come_to Los Angeles because it is not safe. &quot; &quot; It is our intention to carry_out a systematic publicity campaign designed to affect tourism in the Los Angeles area , especially as related to the upcoming World Cup , &quot; the letter said . * A federal judge ruled last week that World Cup ' 94 sold the same rights twice in a case involving two sponsors , Sprint and MasterCard . The exasperated judge noted the case was of &quot; little overriding legal significance &quot; but cited all parties for cruel and unusual use of hype . &quot; The parties ' assertion as_to the importance of this issue may reflect a certain amount of hyperbole , &quot; the judge stated . &quot; For example , Sprint states : ' It is estimated that 32 billion viewers throughout the world will watch the games. ' This is indeed an extraordinary assertion given the current estimation of a world population of only 5 billion , and no reliably verified evidence of interplanetary travel. &quot; They must have meant cumulative viewers . * Now that Switzerland ' s coach , Roy Hodgson , has announced his no-sex policy for his players during the World Cup , other abstinence reports are trickling in . It ' s all very amusing , if not futile , and it ' s a topic that comes_up at every World Cup . U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic says he favors a more relaxed approach , reasoning that normalcy is the best policy to offset nerves . Wives and families will be welcome to visit U.S. players during appointed hours , he said . Milutinovic has guided two teams in the World Cup , and his experience will be a key element in the U.S. team ' s campaign . But , even with his lack of World Cup experience , 1990 U.S. coach Bob Gansler handled himself with great aplomb when a similar story broke at the Italian World Cup . Asked about his policy regarding sex , Gansler answered , &quot; Not at halftime. &quot; Pressed , Gansler said that while players ' wives and girlfriends were not allowed at camp , the players were free to visit them in Florence . &quot; It ' s not the moments of pleasure that concern me , &quot; Gansler said . &quot; It ' s the hours of pursuit. &quot; Again Gansler was asked about his policy and reminded , by an Italian journalist , that &quot; sex is very important to Latin peoples. &quot; &quot; Sex is very important to Americans , too , &quot; Gansler said . &quot; that ' s why there are 250 million of us. &quot;</TEXT>
