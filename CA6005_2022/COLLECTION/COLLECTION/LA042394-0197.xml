   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : TARZANA ; CHILDREN GET A HANDS-ON LEGAL LESSON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Friday was just like any other day in Division 118 of Van Nuys Municipal Court -- with a_few exceptions . The judge was a cherub-cheeked , pony-tailed fifth-grader named Maya . The jurors swung their feet as they sat in their swivel_chairs , and the bailiff stood 4-feet , 5-inches tall . No , it was not a specialized legal case involving the altitudinally challenged . Rather , it was a mock trial put_on by fifth-grade students from Wilbur Avenue Elementary School as part of a program intended to expose them to the inner workings of a real courthouse . The third annual Day at Van Nuys Courthouse was sponsored by the San Fernando Valley Women Lawyers Assn . in honor of Law Day , May 1 , a national event celebrating the importance of law in American society . On Friday , students sat in on arraignments and other courtroom procedures , learned about their constitutional rights and talked with trial_lawyers . The field trip was the culmination of a six-week learning unit at the Tarzana school about the American court system and the U . S . Constitution . It began with a talk by Encino defense_lawyer Malka Tasoff , who discussed defendants ' rights -- such_as the right to not incriminate themselves -- and the concepts behind legal terms , such_as plea bargain and bail . Tasoff came_up with the idea for the children ' s courthouse visits and continues to coordinate the program . Tarzana Deputy City Atty . Jeffrey M . Harkavy was one of several volunteer lawyers who escorted groups of students . &quot; They asked if it was true that some kids had accidentally been locked_up in jail &quot; on previous visits , Harkavy said , incredulous . &quot; I told them I hadn ' t heard that. &quot; Other students asked where Erik and Lyle Menendez had been tried_for the slayings of their wealthy parents . The children were surprisingly well-versed in the facts of the notorious case , which was heard next door in Van Nuys Superior_Court . &quot; I was impressed , &quot; Harkavy said . Students were_quiet and well-behaved when they observed court proceedings in other divisions at the courthouse , but squirmed and fidgeted during long speeches by legal professionals . And near-pandemonium broke_out when a bailiff led the students on a tour of a holding cell . Ten- and 11-year-olds squealed with enthusiasm , flushed the toilet and danced on a bench in the cell . In the mock trial , the highlight of the day ' s events , a student played the role of television character Bart Simpson , accused of painting graffiti on a classroom wall . Classmates played the roles of judge , jury , prosecutor , defense_lawyer and witnesses . Just as in real_life , lawyers called witnesses and raised objections throughout the mock trial . Judge Maya Cohen admonished attorneys to &quot; keep it short &quot; and made witnesses swear to tell the truth and nothing but . Taking_over from student &quot; lawyer &quot; Turner Lange , former Los Angeles County Public_Defender Wilbur Littlefield delivered the closing arguments in Simpson ' s defense . Howard Waco , a real deputy public_defender , did the honors for the prosecution . Somewhat surprisingly , jurors found Simpson guilty , even though the prosecutors had built their case on circumstantial_evidence and doubts were raised about the motives of a key prosecution witness . At the end of the day , students said they believed the U . S . justice system worked most of the time , but isn ' t perfect . &quot; Just look_at this trial , &quot; said Martine Edwards . Gesturing in the direction of the already-empty jury_box , she chastised jurors for voting to convict Bart Simpson too hastily . &quot; They didn ' t have any proof . They didn ' t stay in there long enough , &quot; she said . KAY HWANGBO</TEXT>
