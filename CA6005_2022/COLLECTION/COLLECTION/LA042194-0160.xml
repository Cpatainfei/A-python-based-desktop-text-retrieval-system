   <HEADLINE> PUC PLAN WOULD ALLOW CHOICE OF UTILITY FIRMS ; ELECTRICITY : PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED TO CUT_PRICES . ENVIRONMENTALISTS FEAR SETBACK FOR THEIR CAUSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Proposing the most dramatic overhaul ever of how Californians get electric_power , the state Public_Utilities Commission said Wednesday that it wants to let customers of the state ' s three big investor-owned utilities choose their own power source by the year 2002 . Going_further than experts had expected in its campaign to cut electric prices -- by breaking the utilities ' monopoly on power generation -- the PUC said it would introduce choice in 1996 for large industrial customers of Southern California Edison Co. , San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co . and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co . Smaller industrial users would be added in 1998 and small-business customers in 1999 . And if the PUC sticks_with the plan after a set of public hearings to begin June 14 , the three utilities ' more_than 8 million residential users will be free to select their power supplier beginning in 2002 . For customers , buying electric_power will be like buying long-distance telephone_service . Customers will choose their power_company , and the local utility -- which till now has enjoyed monopoly status within its geographic turf -- will simply deliver the power to their door . &quot; It ' s a fundamental shift on the national scene , &quot; said Jan Hamrin , an energy expert and consultant to the National Assn . of Regulatory Utility Commissioners . &quot; It will probably set a standard for everyone to focus on. &quot; A few states have launched experiments in electric deregulation , but none has proposed going so far as the PUC plan . The commission hopes that competition among producers will significantly lower Californians ' electricity bills . But consumer activists objected Wednesday to several aspects of the PUC ' s scheme -- including a plan for ratepayers to pay_off some big , existing utility investments , largely in nuclear_power plants , that critics say were the companies ' own mistakes . Covering the costs of such investments -- and the new way that the commission proposes to regulate utilities in the future -- could stick consumers with higher costs instead of savings , critics said . &quot; This is a system completely stacked in favor of the utilities , &quot; said Michel P . Florio , senior attorney for Toward Utility Rate Normalization , a San Francisco-based consumer group . But environmentalists expressed concern that wide-open competition -- with the winners being those power producers who can make electricity most cheaply -- will erode the state ' s decades-long commitment to renewable and environmentally preferable energy sources . The proposal would have no direct affect on power customers in the city of Los Angeles , who get electricity from the municipally owned Department of Water and Power , or in other cities with municipal utilities , including Glendale , Burbank , Pasadena , Anaheim , Riverside and Sacramento . &quot; But clearly it will have an impact on us , &quot; said Michael T . Moore , director of public and governmental affairs for the DWP , whose rates now are 15 % to 20 % below those of Southern California Edison . The utilities had opposed deregulation through more_than a year of public -- if obscure -- debate , but the commission proposal appears to offer them a buffer against the worst potential financial damage from deregulation . They had feared that their shareholders would be left to pay_off long-term investments in power_plants that won ' t be competitive under the new system . The utilities also had worried about losing their large industrial customers , some of which already have been moving operations out of state in search of cheaper electricity . Had the commission allowed only such customers to shop for power , small-business and residential ratepayers might have seen dramatic rate hikes as they shouldered more of the utilities ' overhead . &quot; This looks_like a thoughtful , well-conceived plan , &quot; said John E . Bryson , chairman and chief_executive of Southern California Edison and its parent , SCEcorp . It both gives customers choice , he said , and provides &quot; fairness to all customer groups and to utility investors who supported the development of the infrastructure that we have. &quot; Investors seemed to signal initial agreement , though utility shares generally were strong in_stock trading Wednesday . PG &amp; E rose 62.5 cents to $ 29.625 , SCEcorp added 12.5 cents to $ 16.625 and SDG &amp; E gained 50 cents to $ 22.75. The PUC also endorsed the utilities ' ideas for how they would earn profits in the regulated portion of their business that will remain basically monopolistic -- the delivery of electricity to homes and businesses , from whatever source . All three utilities want to switch away from the traditional ratemaking process , which allows them to charge ratepayers the cost of their services plus a regulated profit . They prefer a system known as performance-based ratemaking , which ties their earnings not to how much power they sell , but to their efficiency . If they cut operating_costs below an annual goal set by the commission , the utilities want to be able to split the difference between savings to ratepayers and profit to their shareholders . The commissioners also expect utilities to find new markets outside their traditional service territories , just as utilities from other parts of the country are expected to enter the electricity business in California . Indeed , Commissioner P . Gregory Conlon said Wednesday that he would expect a regional spot market in electricity to develop , with prices updated every hour or half hour , as now exists in England and Wales . That would let utilities sell their excess power into a national transmission system for use wherever there was customer demand . Meanwhile , environmentalists expressed concern about damage to the state ' s policy of encouraging diverse sources of energy , which dates to the first Middle_East oil crisis in 1973 . The oil shock hit California harder than any state in the nation . The Legislature and regulators quickly moved to encourage non-fossil fuels , such_as wind , solar and geothermal power . As the commission deliberated , Conlon argued for a rate surcharge in the new system to continue such support . But Wednesday ' s proposal leaves customers only the option of specifying -- perhaps by marking a box on their bill -- that they want their power purchased from one of these sources . Otherwise , such energy sources will be left to compete with all_the others -- including a new class of dramatically efficient natural_gas turbines -- and environmentalists say some will be hard-pressed to be competitive . Independent power producers also were furious over a PUC decision -- also announced Wednesday -- to hold_off resolution of a bitter dispute over renewable energy . The utilities have protested an auction that would have meant more_than $ 1 billion worth of power contracts for independent producers . The commissioners said they would hold_off adjudicating the dispute until after hearings are held_on the deregulation plan . &quot; On the commission ' s first_step into a competitive future , they ' ve tripped , &quot; said an angry Jan Smutny-Jones , executive_director of Sacramento-based Independent Energy Producers . He objected that further delays leave these companies with an uncertain financial future and expressed concern that the commission may_not live_up_to the rules of the auction , which were set_up years ago . * RELATED STORIES : D1</TEXT>
