   <HEADLINE> RESHUFFLING THE DECK OF NEVADA POLITICS ; ELECTION : NEWCOMERS ARE WILD CARDS IN A GAME ONCE RULED BY POWERBROKERS . HOMESPUN AURA IS FADING FAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three years ago Jan Jones was a political nobody in the Silver_State , a mother of five best known as a TV car huckster with sparkling jewelry and a toothy grin . Since then , Jones has been rather busy . First , she became mayor of Las Vegas , the biggest city in the nation ' s fastest-growing state . Now , she is mounting a strong run_for governor , a quest that could make her the first woman to reach the top rung on Nevada ' s ladder of power . Jones , 45 , is clearly an overnight political sensation . Part of that metamorphosis is a product of her energy , ideas and telegenic personality . But her rise also proves a broader point : Political change is afoot amid the sagebrush and slot_machines . Once a state where a small fraternity of powerbrokers anointed candidates for major offices and dominated the political game , Nevada today is a place where phenomenal growth has created a jackpot of opportunities for newcomers and neophytes who possess the drive to get involved . &quot; You no longer have to be a good old_boy to break_into Nevada politics , &quot; said Eric Herzik , a political_scientist at the University of Nevada in Reno . &quot; That traditional network is breaking_down , and it ' s creating openings for different kinds of people who never had much access before. &quot; Other signs of Nevada ' s political maturation abound : * Campaigns -- once provincial affairs that relied_on door-to-door visits with voters and were run_by a small coterie of managers who doubled as lobbyists -- are now big-time , big-money events . Experienced consultants from other states have settled here , and a cottage industry of advertising companies , polling firms and television production houses has sprung_up to serve them . &quot; There is much more resident sophistication than you found before , &quot; said Sig Rogich , a veteran Las Vegas consultant and former adviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George_Bush . &quot; In the past , there were just a_few of us local people doing_it all . Now ( consultants ) with reputations have moved_in from outside. &quot; * New restrictions on the financing of political_campaigns are winning favor in the Legislature . In 1991 , the first-ever limits on campaign contributions were adopted , and candidates may no longer spend leftover donations on personal items . Political action committees were recently required to register with the secretary_of_state , and lobbyists also face new scrutiny . Under a bill passed last year , they must identify who they wine_and_dine in monthly reports . * In another change -- one triggering widespread lament -- the state ' s staggering population growth is gradually eroding the small-town , homespun feel that has long been a cherished feature of politics , Nevada style . Traditionally , elected officials of the highest rank were expected to show_up at every 4-H fair or weenie_roast . The governor -- who was always called by his first_name -- took constituent calls_at home and traveled without a trace of security . As Nevadans ' numbers soar , that sort of intimacy is becoming impossible . &quot; Longtime residents expect a_level of access ( to politicians ) that you ' d never see in a state like California , &quot; Gov . Bob Miller said in an interview . &quot; I want to fulfill that expectation , but as Nevada grows it gets_tougher and tougher. &quot; * While women candidates have made the strongest gains , Nevada minorities are running_for office in record numbers . The state is just 3 % Asian , but a Chinese American -- Cheryl Lau -- was elected secretary_of_state in 1990 , becoming the first minority to hold a statewide office . Now she is one of the three top challengers in this year ' s governor ' s race . Gay_men and lesbians , meanwhile , are also emerging as a political force , one wooed by candidates in statewide contests . Last year , gay rights advocates celebrated a victory that once seemed unthinkable in this conservative land settled by Mormons -- the repeal of an anti-sodomy law by the Legislature . &quot; Little by little , you ' re seeing change in the political_orientation of the state , &quot; said Bob Fulkerson of the Nevada Progressive Coalition , a new group that hopes to accelerate that shift by recruiting candidates for political office . &quot; A lot of the old kingmakers are still around , but their stranglehold is unraveling. &quot; At the root of many of these changes , experts say , is the state ' s extraordinary growth . Lured by jobs , cheap housing and low taxes , outsiders are pouring into Nevada in dizzying numbers , propelling the population from 800 # 000 in 1980 to more_than 1.4 million today . In Clark County , home of Las Vegas , roughly 4 # 000 new residents arrive each month , most of them from California . Some come from Republican pockets such_as Orange County , and they share conservative values long dominant here , such_as a disdain for taxes . Many arrivals , however , appear to be nourishing more liberal trends . Jean Ford , a former state legislator from Reno , says this phenomenon is visible in the contrast between two statewide referendums , one in 1978 , one in 1990 . In 1978 , Nevadans defeated the Equal Rights Amendment by a 4-1 margin . In 1990 , 63 % of the state ' s voters passed a measure guaranteeing a woman ' s right to an unrestricted abortion . &quot; That vote was an astonishing victory , &quot; said Ford , who now teaches women ' s studies at the University of Nevada . &quot; It proved how far we ' ve come , how attitudes have changed. &quot; Beyond their views on such issues , the newcomers are affecting Nevada ' s political agenda with their sheer numbers , creating problems on a scale never imagined when the state was sparsely populated and largely rural . Schools , social_services , water , health_care , overcrowded prisons -- these and other concerns now dominate debate and create unprecedented challenges for Nevada ' s leaders . Clark County , home to 64 % of the state ' s population , faces the most daunting pressures . This fall , voters will be asked to approve $ 905 million in bonds to begin building 110 desperately needed schools . Last year , county voters rejected bonds to pay_for more police and parks ; there is little confidence they will approve them for schools . &quot; Five years ago , nobody ever worried about growth . It was just , ' Go , go go , ' &quot; said Jon Ralston , a columnist and publisher of a newsletter on Nevada politics . &quot; Now we see the consequences of that attitude , and today growth is the political issue. &quot; Despite its evolution into an urbanized state more like California than Wyoming , Nevada has not altogether lost its legendary flair for political quirkiness . This tendency began early -- with Nevada ' s admission to the Union in 1864 . Statehood , recalls historian James Hulse , happened not because the desert region was &quot; suitably prepared to graduate from territorial status. &quot; Instead , President Abraham_Lincoln made_it happen because he needed Nevada ' s Electoral College votes to win reelection and end the Civil War . &quot; No other state , &quot; Hulse writes in &quot; Silver_State , &quot; his recent history of Nevada , &quot; was ever born so prematurely or had so_much trouble coming of age. &quot; Indeed , had he lived , Lincoln might have come_to regret his decision . For Nevada became a notorious maverick among states , scorned for its legalization of gambling , prostitution and prize-fighting -- and its willingness to serve_up a quickie divorce . Its politics were never , ever dull . There was , for instance , the tale of the U.S. senator reelected on his deathbed in 1940 . During a pre-election drinking spree , the Democratic senator suffered a heart_attack and was declared a dying man . Fearing that voters would elect his rival -- thus placing the seat in Republican hands -- his backers hid the news . The senator won the election , and when he died five days later , the governor appointed another Democrat to succeed him . At the Statehouse in Carson City , old-timers can recall many_a memorable episode , from the Assembly Speaker who presided drunk and incoherent over a session ' s closing days , to brawls in the halls and a mysterious bullet said to have been fired through a portrait of Lincoln during a heated debate . More recently , a popular prostitute from Esmerelda County nearly won a seat in the state Assembly . Beverly Harrell , proprietor of the Cottontail Ranch , lost the 1974 race by just 120 votes after campaigning in an RV filled with enthusiastic call_girls . Though rare today , colorful characters still pop_up on Nevada ' s political scene . This year , a man named Rhinestone Cowboy is making a bid for governor . He is joined on the ballot by Samuel Bull IV , an electrician whose campaign pledges include a shift to executions by hanging and a return to Nevada ' s no speed_limit days . If voters are not keen on Cowboy , Bull or any of the other candidates on the ballot , no matter -- Nevada continues to offer them an option available in few other states : the chance to reject all_the contenders and choose none of the above . This option has produced some intriguing outcomes ; in the 1980 Republican primary , none of the above outpolled George_Bush in the race for President . Ronald Reagan came_in first . Although such peculiarities are harmless , other enduring traits of Nevada politics are somewhat less charming , critics say . Despite its growth and increasingly complex problems , Nevada is still run_by a part-time &quot; citizens &quot; Legislature that meets for about five months every_other year . Ralston , the columnist , calls the part-time Legislature &quot; a ridiculous relic &quot; that is highly vulnerable to special-interest pressure : &quot; These legislators are paid a pittance -- $ 6 # 800 for the session -- and they have no research_staff of_their_own , &quot; he said . &quot; That makes them all_the more reliant_on lobbyists . Information is power. &quot; The most powerful players , of course , are the gaming moguls . Since their influence eclipsed that of miners and ranchers in the 1950s , casino owners have contributed more to political candidates than any other interest_group . Their lobbyists have an unparalleled record of squashing gaming tax increases and other legislation deemed hostile to the state ' s No . 1 industry . Many of today ' s gambling titans are using new techniques to make their mark . Multimillionaire Stephen A . Wynn , whose casinos include the Mirage and Treasure Island , created a highly sophisticated polling and voter research operation two years ago . He shares his findings with chosen candidates . &quot; In the past , the casinos just threw money at campaigns , &quot; said Dan Hart , who was hired by Wynn to set_up the system and now works as campaign manager for Jan Jones . &quot; That still happens , but now they ' re also finding smarter ways to use their resources. &quot; As usual , this year ' s battle for the governor ' s post will be dominated by gaming contributions , with the Democratic incumbent Miller -- the son of a casino executive -- reaping the lion ' s share of support . But the fiercely contested race also symbolizes the new dynamics evident in Nevada politics . For starters , the scale of the campaigns mounted by Miller and his three challengers is unprecedented , making_it by far the most expensive governor ' s race in state history . Although the total will look paltry beside the $ 40 million expected to be spent in the race for governor of California , it will easily top $ 4 million -- twice the sum spent in 1990 . The nature of the campaigns is different as well . With the state ' s population explosion , the candidates are more reliant than ever on television advertising to carry their message : &quot; There ' s no avoiding it , &quot; said Billy Vassiliadis , Miller ' s political consultant . The most striking change is visible in the people who believe they have a shot at the state ' s top political job . In this sense , two candidates stand_out . On the Republican side there is Lau , 49 , a former university professor and deputy attorney_general who came_out of nowhere to win the secretary_of_state ' s job in 1990 . She is opposing Assemblyman Jim Gibbons of Reno . In the Democratic primary there is Jones , a Santa Monica native who left a lucrative career with a family auto dealership business to become mayor of Las Vegas in 1991 . Both are political rookies . Both are newcomers to Nevada . Both are highly educated . And both are women opposing men in Tuesday ' s primary . &quot; This is the new breed of politician we never had in the old Nevada , &quot; said Guy Rocha , the state ' s archivist . &quot; What would be truly unusual is if these two women faced_off ( in the general_election ) in November. &quot; At the moment , that does not look likely . The latest polls show Miller -- a former Clark County district_attorney whose political career spans 20 years -- with a comfortable lead over Jones , his primary opponent , and all other rivals . With the state ' s economy in robust shape , his challengers have had trouble finding fodder for potent attacks . But some observers believe growth may be a wild card in this election . Newcomers , they argue , arrive here with open minds and limited knowledge of the state ' s political players . That may dilute the traditional advantage of incumbency , giving Miller ' s challengers a boost . &quot; When I first ran_for office , everybody was suspicious of me because I ' d only been in the state for five years and they figured I didn ' t truly understand Nevada , &quot; said Lt . Gov . Sue Wagner , whose political career began in the Assembly two decades ago . &quot; But look_around this state today -- everybody ' s a newcomer . They don ' t care whether you ' re a native or not . What they want to know is , ' Can you do the job ? ' &quot;</TEXT>
