   <HEADLINE> U.S. , SET FOR JAPAN SHOOTOUT , MAY HIT OWN FOOT ; TRADE : ADMINISTRATION EYES SANCTIONS FOR A NONEXISTENT ' PROBLEM ' ; RESPONSE COULD STALL CALIFORNIA ' S ECONOMIC RECOVERY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor , meeting in Los Angeles this weekend with counterparts from America ' s three biggest trading partners , must feel anything but at_ease . The Clinton_Administration is considering unilateral trade action in knowing violation of the agreements and principles that the ministers are meeting to enhance . That issue hangs like a foreboding cloud_over the discussions . The Administration says it will meet its self-imposed deadline of Sept . 30 to decide whether to threaten trade sanctions against Japan . If reports are true , the action would be taken against Japanese auto parts manufacturers . This should make tensions particularly high with the Japanese minister , since no unfair trade practice in auto parts has been identified . In fact , there have been repeated private admissions by U.S._government officials that the auto parts &quot; problem &quot; is largely political , not substantive . Imposing unilateral sanctions against Japan with_respect_to auto parts would be a flagrant violation of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and would repudiate the new dispute-resolution framework the United States fought so hard to get as a part of the GATT Uruguay Round agreement -- the implementation of which the ministers are meeting to discuss . The United States would be taking the action simply because it doesn ' t like the balance_of_trade between the two countries , and in spite of the failure of repeated , exhaustive attempts to document charges of unfair trade practices in autos and auto parts . A U.S. decision to act without evidence of wrongdoing would abandon 50 years of global-trade consensus and fly in the face of America ' s longstanding support for free_trade in competitive world markets . Should the United States decide on Sept . 30 to move toward sanctions , Japan ' s auto_makers will urge their country to &quot; take whatever actions are appropriate &quot; in response . We may be_on the brink of a trade confrontation the_likes_of which we haven ' t seen since before the Depression . To solve a &quot; problem &quot; that doesn ' t exist , millions of American jobs would be put at risk . In California , exports account_for 9 % of the economy and 1.4 million jobs . The shock of an international disruption of trade would register as a new and economically disastrous kind of earthquake in a state still struggling to recover from the last recession . The irony is that so_much has already been accomplished to increase U.S. sales to Japan in both autos and auto parts . Largely as the result of an intensive and sustained industry-to-industry , company-to-company effort , Japanese purchases of U.S. auto parts have jumped more_than 500 % since 1986 -- from $ 2.49 billion to $ 15.5 billion . In just the last five years , the number of U.S. suppliers to Japanese auto_makers has grown more_than fourfold , from about 300 to about 1 # 250 . U.S. auto_makers are watching their sales in Japan soar since the recent introduction of basic marketing techniques like price_cuts and the offering of cars equipped with right-hand drive . All this progress , and that potentially yet to come , would be blown away by the trade conflagration Kantor and his boss may be about to provoke .</TEXT>
