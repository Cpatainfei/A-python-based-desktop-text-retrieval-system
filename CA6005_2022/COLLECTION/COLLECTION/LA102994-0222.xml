   <HEADLINE> THOSE UNIFORMS ARE NO DISGUISE : IT ' S THE PACKERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What a special Halloween it will be for football fans . They can walk through their neighborhoods Monday night and see ghastly , slow-moving creatures with missing brains and hearts . Or they can turn_on their television_sets and see a similar bunch playing the Chicago Bears . This year ' s holiday is made_for the Green_Bay Packers , a once-regal franchise that hard_times have disfigured . Midway through the season , no team has been as disappointing or difficult to understand . &quot; Every time we turn_around , it is like we are shooting ourselves in the foot , &quot; tackle Ken Ruettgers said . &quot; We have dug ourselves quite a hole. &quot; So_much that booing fans recently forced Coach Mike Holmgren ' s wife Kathy to leave the Lambeau Field stands . Those same fans also nearly started a fight in the mezzanine with another biased observer -- quarterback Brett Favre ' s father , Irwin . A hole indeed . Here ' s how deep : -- The Packers were expected to be mentioned as Super Bowl contenders along with the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers . Instead , they are being talked_about as if they were the New England Patriots . They are 3-4 with three blown second-half leads , including two that were lost in the final seconds . If they don ' t win at Chicago on Monday night , they could be in danger of missing the playoffs . &quot; This team is_full of would-haves , could-haves and should-haves , &quot; Ruettgers said . -- Favre was expected to blossom as one of the league ' s top quarterbacks . Instead , he is tied for 15th place with a 78.9 passer rating . &quot; He ' s still like that little_girl with a curl , &quot; General_Manager Ron Wolf said . At age 25 and in his third full season in the league , isn ' t it time Favre grew_up ? -- Sterling Sharpe was supposed to pass Jerry Rice as the league ' s best receiver . Instead , six players have caught more passes than Sharpe , and 18 have gained more yards receiving . And he has become no more of a deep threat than a tight_end . In five of the Packers ' seven games , he hasn ' t caught a pass longer than 17 yards . Was that Sharpe screaming at the coaches to call more plays in his direction on that recent Thursday night_game in Minnesota ? Team officials say no , that the microphone that picked_up his cries had distorted his voice . But common_sense says that all is not well with a man who would walk_out on his team the night before the opening game over a contract dispute . . . and then spend the first seven games on a pace to catch fewer passes than he has in three years . &quot; What Sterling did at the start was the big distraction to the team , &quot; Wolf said . &quot; But once he came_back , that ended . We have no problem with him. &quot; Sharpe has been hurt not only by his occasional pouting , but by the free-agent defection of tight_end Jackie Harris . -- Reggie Cobb , signed as a free_agent from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the off-season , was supposed to give the Packers their first 1 # 000-yard rusher since Terdell Middleton in 1978 . Instead , he has behaved more like Eddie Lee Ivery . Cobb has rushed for 266 yards and one touchdown , with no run longer than 16 yards . But he also has fewer carries than any of the league ' s 25 rushers who are ranked ahead of him . Wolf said the biggest problem with the Packers ' 26th-ranked rushing offense is the weather . He is still waiting for Packer weather , icy weather , when his second-ranked defense can set_up a bruising running attack that will feature Cobb more . &quot; Once the cold_weather comes_back , we ' ll be fine , &quot; he said . &quot; We can play our kind of game in the cold weather. &quot; Of course , the Packers can always count_on defensive end Reggie White , who is having perhaps the finest season of his Hall_of_Fame career . Well , maybe not always . White recently told a reporter that he missed his former team in Philadelphia . &quot; But how can I get_back ? &quot; he asked the reporter . Returning his $ 9-million bonus , one supposes , would be a start . MONDAY NIGHT MADNESS In preparation for the first Monday night_game on Halloween in six years , Barry Krauss offers this warning : &quot; Watch_out , &quot; Krauss said . &quot; Strange things could happen . It will be very eerie. &quot; Krauss would know . He was a linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts when they played host to the Denver Broncos in the last Monday night Halloween game in 1988 . The Colts were 3-5 at the time . The Broncos were 4-4 . Fans spent early Monday evening at Halloween parties , then filled the Hoosier Dome dressed like ghosts and goblins . Some even wore masks of announcers Frank Gifford , Dan Dierdorf or Al Michaels . &quot; Everybody in the stands was wearing some sort of mask , all screaming and howling , all fired_up , &quot; Krauss said . &quot; I have never seen anything like it. &quot; The Colts responded by scoring a team-record 45 points in the first_half and won , 55-23 . To this day , Krauss believes that the Broncos were spooked . &quot; From the moment the Broncos stepped_on the field , it was like they never had a chance , &quot; Krauss said . &quot; We knew it . They knew it . When I see guys from that game today , we still talk_about it. &quot; Does this mean that this year ' s Monday night schedule -- which has given us five dogs in eight games -- can be saved ? Of eight remaining games , five should be winners . Monday -- Packers at Bears . Their 147th meeting since 1921 . Will be the most-watched game in the league ' s oldest rivalry . A winner . Nov . 7 -- New York Giants at Dallas Cowboys . A potential dog , only because the Cowboys should score early and often and then rest their stars for the next week ' s showdown in San Francisco . Nov . 14 -- Buffalo Bills at Pittsburgh Steelers . Terrific regional rivalry . Will there be more fights in the stands or on the field ? A winner . Nov . 21 -- New York Giants at Houston Oilers . Whoever agreed to give the sorry Oilers three Monday night appearances wins the award for most uninformed person in the game . A dog . Nov . 28 -- San Francisco at New Orleans . Bark , bark . Dec . 5 -- Raiders at San Diego Chargers . Other_than Winston Moss being forced to use an alias on national TV , this is a winner . Dec . 12 -- Kansas City Chiefs at Miami Dolphins . A preview of the first round of the playoffs . A winner . Dec . 19 -- Cowboys at Saints . We aren ' t even going_to ask what ABC was thinking_about here . A dog . Dec . 26 -- 49ers at Vikings . Another playoff preview . A winner . REALIGNMENT UPDATE While the favored realignment proposal reported here remains alive , it is facing greater odds every day . In preparation for reaching a decision at the owners ' meetings in Chicago next week , owners are now backing_away from their previous stances and hunkering down to protect old rivalries and habits . In other words , get ready for an NFC West that includes two teams that play in the Eastern time_zone -- Atlanta and Carolina . And get ready for an AFC Central that contains four teams that play in the Eastern time_zone -- Cleveland , Pittsburgh , Cincinnati and Jacksonville . According to owner Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys , the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars simply will be dropped into those respective divisions . &quot; The owners are now thinking that there is no way you can do anything other_than just slot the teams , &quot; Jones said . &quot; It ' s just too hard. &quot; The reasoning : -- While some owners have agreed to move , others are unhappy with the results of those moves . And for some of the most unusual reasons . For example , Indianapolis will gladly move from the AFC East to the NFC Central , but current NFC Central residents are worried about having three division teams playing in domes . &quot; The ripple effects are just too great , &quot; Jones said . -- Owners no longer care that it sounds ludicrous to have , say , a team from Charlotte , N.C. , in a western division . &quot; Do we realign just because it sounds funny to have teams from the East playing in the West ? &quot; Jones asked . &quot; Of course not . Heck , if that bothers you , let ' s just change the names of the divisions . Call them the red division , or blue division. &quot; -- Owners believe that new rivalries -- one of the projected results of realignment -- can be created simply through scheduling . &quot; Heck , we ' ll play Houston every year if the schedule-makers will just do_it , &quot; Jones said . &quot; We don ' t have to be in the same division with them. &quot; This corner thinks that by not realigning , the NFL will be missing yet another chance to update the game for younger fans . After heading so far in that direction in recent years by changing rules and adding Fox , why stop now ? QUICK HITTERS * AS GRACIOUS IN DEFEAT AS IN VICTORY : Buddy Ryan was asked about traffic accidents involving Dallas ' Erik Williams and Shante Carver , which occurred just hours after the Cowboys had defeated Ryan ' s Arizona Cardinals last Sunday . &quot; Well , they were wrecked up a little bit before they left here too , weren ' t they ? &quot; Ryan said . * LEAVE IT TO BOBBY : While leaving work around 11 p.m. one recent night , San Diego Charger Coach Bobby Ross was reminded that the Rolling Stones were giving a concert on the stadium field behind his office . So he took a peek . &quot; That place was really jumping , &quot; Ross said later . &quot; That Mike Jagger was really going. &quot; * HEADS_UP : Agent Leigh Steinberg is so concerned with head injuries that he is exploring plans to bring his 21 quarterbacks to Newport Beach this spring for a seminar and examinations by a neurologist . Just last weekend , quarterbacks Troy Aikman of the Cowboys , Vinny Testaverde of the Cleveland Browns and Chris Miller of the Rams suffered concussions . Two weeks ago , running back Merril Hoge of the Chicago Bears retired after suffering four concussions since training camp . Steinberg figures that clients Aikman and Steve Young of the San Francisco 49ers have suffered at least four concussions each . And he wonders how long sufferers would continue to play if they knew of the long-term effects . &quot; Players in this league know exactly what is inside their knee , but nothing about what is inside their head , &quot; Steinberg said . Steinberg said that the biggest problem is that nobody has researched how numerous concussions can affect a player later in life . &quot; What effect do all_of these things have_on strokes ? Or senility ? Or Parkinson ' s disease ? &quot; Steinberg asked . &quot; Somebody has to give the players some more information . There are players right now who probably should retire . But nobody knows. &quot; * IT ' S ABOUT TIME : In the year of the throwback uniforms , we have finally seen a throwback spike . Our thanks to Chris Spielman , Detroit Lion linebacker , who last week stripped a ball and returned it 25 yards for a touchdown , his first , against the Chicago Bears . In the end zone , Spielman fell to his knees and slammed the ball down with both hands . &quot; It was my 1905 spike for all_the old-timers that played this game , &quot; he said . &quot; It really was . I said if I ever scored , I was going_to go_in there like the old-timers and throw the ball down in the end zone like they used to do . All I ' m doing is reviving the true meaning of touch down. &quot; * MORE UNBELIEVABLE BY THE STEP : Barry Sanders ' 84-yard run_for the Lions against the Bears last week was not his longest in the NFL , but his longest with both shoes on . His 85-yard run this season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was accomplished after he had lost his right shoe near the line_of_scrimmage . * IF SHELL DIDN ' T COMPARE HOSTETLER TO JAY SCHROEDER , HE SHOULD HAVE : Enough of the jokes that Hostetler was most angry about an alleged comparison to Jay Schroeder . They really are quite similar . Each is 33 and has been in the league since 1985 . Each stands about 6 feet 2 and weighs about 220 pounds . Each has played in one Super Bowl . The major difference is that Schroeder has had a far more productive career , having thrown for more_than twice as_many yards and touchdowns as Hoss . * GEE , MAYBE WE DON ' T DESERVE TWO TEAMS : Figures this week reveal that the Raiders and Rams rank 26th and 27th , respectively , in home attendance . The Raiders are drawing an average of 48 # 756 to the Coliseum , the Rams 41 # 130 to Anaheim Stadium . The only team in worse shape is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , drawing only 40 # 055 . The leading Kansas City Chiefs are averaging 79 # 522 . that ' s impressive , considering that capacity at Arrowhead Stadium is more_than 1 # 000 less than that figure , 78 # 067 . * THE HIGH COST OF LEAVING YOUR FANS IN LIMBO : According to calculations by &quot; The Sports Business Daily , &quot; the Rams have already dropped $ 868 # 170 in total home ticket money ( before revenue sharing ) compared to last season . This projects to a $ 1.6-million deficit by the end of the season . Only one other team in the league , the New Orleans Saints , figure to lose even half that much .</TEXT>
