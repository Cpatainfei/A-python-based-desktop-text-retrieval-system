   <HEADLINE> E = MC SQUARES ARE REALLY LIVING IT UP ; AGING : A STUDY SAYS SCIENTISTS TEND TO LIVE LONGER THAN THE REST OF US . IT SEEMS THE SOCIAL GRACES THAT MANY OF THEM ADMIT THEY LACK MAY NOT BE SO HEALTHY AFTER ALL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If it were a movie , it would probably be called &quot; Nerds : The Ultimate Revenge. &quot; A new study spanning nearly 70 years suggests that , all else being equal , scientists live longer than non-scientists . The anachronistic image of socially impaired , slide-rule-toting chess masters has plagued legions of scientists , but their tendency to be less gregarious than others may give them the last laugh , says UC Riverside researcher Howard Friedman . &quot; The findings do bode well for attracting the brightest scholars into science , &quot; says the Harvard-educated psychologist . &quot; We don ' t have scientific proof yet , &quot; he says , &quot; but what this ( study ) may mean is that scientists have less stress . Perhaps they have found the right career niche for their interests and personalities. &quot; Until now , sociability has been naturally associated with long and healthy lives . &quot; There has been a great_deal of speculation and some evidence to predict that sociable people should live longer , &quot; Friedman says . &quot; And at first , it looked_like that would be the outcome here . Happily for scientists , we found just the opposite. &quot; According to Friedman ' s study , non-scientists are 26 % more likely to die at any given age than scientists . In a sample of 600 men born around 1912 , Friedman ' s group found that only 67 % of non-scientists were still alive by age 70 , compared to 72 % of the scientists . * With funding from the National Institute on Aging , Friedman tracked the lives -- and deaths -- of a group of California youngsters first identified as gifted in 1922 . That is the year legendary Stanford_University psychologist Lewis Terman began his seminal behavior study of 1 # 528 children in Los Angeles and San Francisco public_schools . Terman originally set_out to answer the question &quot; Are scientists different ? &quot; But , according to Friedman , Terman was never interested in the differences in their longevity . &quot; He wanted to see if bright people turned_out to be nerdy and sickly , &quot; Friedman says . &quot; There was a stereotype at the turn_of_the_century that bright kids were weird , and Terman wanted to see if they grew_up to be_well adjusted and successful. &quot; Troubled by the hunt for Communist sympathizers among American intellectuals , Terman returned to the study in the 1950s in hopes of explaining the growing friction between non-scientists -- specifically politicians and lawyers -- and scientists . Terman questioned 284 of the children who had grown_up to be scientists and queried another 326 who did not . ( All of the subjects in the second survey were white males ; very few girls or ethnic minorities became scientists in those days. ) Terman discovered two trends among the groups . First , and predictably , he found that the scientists were more interested in science than those who went_on to become businessmen or lawyers . Second , the scientists -- both as children and adults -- rated themselves and were rated by others as less sociable than most . Using death certificates and interviews with survivors , Friedman ' s team was able to find_out what happened to nearly all_of Terman ' s subjects . Looking_at causes of death , as well as health-related behaviors , the Riverside research team found that even early predictors of longevity seemed not to apply to scientists . In addition to Friedman , the team includes a biostatistician , epidemiologist , developmental psychologist , a pair of health psychologists and a physician . &quot; We know that people who live longer are not excessive drinkers or smokers . But even this seems not to be true with the scientists whose lives we studied , &quot; says Friedman , who also found no difference in the death rates of obese scientists versus obese non-scientists . &quot; I can only speculate wildly on what all this means , &quot; Friedman says . &quot; Clearly , we need to go_back again to the sample and look_at marriage patterns , hobbies , everything about the way these people lived their lives. &quot; * There is a whole body of anecdotal history about the long and lonely lives of socially awkward scientists . Thomas_Edison , who died at 84 , was no wallflower when it came_to the world of inventions . But don ' t look_for any sweet remembrances about life with this father . Not only was Edison too busy in the laboratory to spend time with his children or grandchildren , he also paid scant attention to either of his wives or any of the people who wanted to be his friends . Indeed , according to his biographers , Edison was so antisocial that he considered his deafness a blessing . He said it made_it easier for him to concentrate . Albert Einstein was more outgoing and , especially around World_War_II , quite politically active . He adored classical_music , the violin , and his first_cousin , whom he married after divorcing his first wife . He died at 76 . But even he preferred the company of formulas and theorems to that of mathematicians and physicists . While the Einsteins of today are as likely to be orbiting in space ships as they are to be bent over a microscope , the scientific personality remains somewhat aloof , say some students of behavior . &quot; The value of our findings about scientists ' longevity , &quot; Friedman says , &quot; will come from identifying what it is that makes them a breed apart and why they seem to thrive on it. &quot;</TEXT>
