   <TEXT> Teacher Rocky Karbel fingers the golden &quot; R &quot; hanging from a chain around her neck . She flicks her wrist , jangling the tiny hearts on her bracelet , and picks_up the embroidered denim jacket , showing_off a_few of the many gifts she has received over the years from students . Expensive presents are swell , said Karbel , but the gifts that really touch her are the cards , pictures and personal notes of appreciation from her charges -- and their parents . &quot; It sounds corny , &quot; said Karbel , who teaches first_grade at Riverside Drive Elementary School in Sherman Oaks , &quot; but the gifts that mean the most are the ones with pictures of the kids and a nice note. &quot; Teachers often top the holiday gift list of appreciative parents and students , and it doesn ' t take much to make them happy . &quot; Teaching is such a giving and all-consuming profession that it is nice to know you are appreciated , &quot; said Arlene Schneider , a second-grade teacher at Dearborn Street Elementary School in Northridge . &quot; A gift isn ' t necessary , but words of . . . thanks mean so much. &quot; In these days of belt-tightening budget_cuts , many San Fernando Valley teachers buy a lot of_their_own school supplies -- sometimes even paying_for field trips -- so anything that can be used in the classroom is always appreciated . Books , arts-and-crafts supplies , stickers , rubber_stamps and ink pads , and gift certificates to educational supply stores always come_in_handy . School-related gifts that pleased in the past included books donated to the school library in honor of the teacher , globes , microscopes and a camera and film . Mugs and plaques emblazoned with &quot; 1 Teacher &quot; were the craze for a while , but the creative gift basket is the latest gift-giving trend and is being well-received . Karbel recalled , for example , a Hanukkah-themed basket that included potato_pancake mix , a frying pan and a stuffed blue-and-white bear , while a kindergarten teacher said a basket stuffed with finger puppets , cassettes with read-along books , puzzles and stickers is a gift she uses over and over in school . Teachers are as individual as their students ; what pleases one could seem odd to another . A North Hills fifth-grade teacher said he enjoyed receiving sweaters and shirts , but others said clothing is a very personal gift and tough to buy for someone you don ' t know well . Karbel , who has been teaching for 24 years , said that because she shares so_much of her personal life with her students they know just what she likes . A baseball nut , she has received sports memorabilia , gift certificates to sushi restaurants and decorative items in her favorite colors , green and purple . One year an imaginative mom had all_the children draw pictures and sign their names on fabric . The mom then turned the fabric into two large pillows that rest in a place of honor in Karbel ' s den . Common gifts include stationery , picture_frames , inexpensive jewelry , household knickknacks , perfume , bubble_bath , desk accessories and , of course , the ubiquitous coffee_mug . Less well-received gifts have included a certificate for a facial , hors d ' oeuvre forks , an obviously previously worn blouse , cosmetics and light-up religious figures . In schools that serve low-income families , &quot; Giving a teacher a gift is a real luxury , &quot; said Brenda Stern-Roter , a teacher for 18 years who teaches third grade at Kittridge Elementary School in Van Nuys . She values the notes , photos and pictures she receives , such_as the one she got her first year of teaching from a boy whose card had a poem about friendship . Schneider , who has been teaching for 25 years , summed_up the general sentiments of teachers : &quot; Whatever a child wants to give to their teacher comes from their heart , and I really appreciate the thought. &quot; Favorites Remembered Gifts that have been popular_with teachers : Books Arts-and-crafts supplies Stickers , rubber_stamps and ink pads Gift certificates to educational supply stores Books donated to the school library in honor of the teacher Globes Microscopes Cameras and film Creative gift baskets Cards , pictures and personal notes of appreciation</TEXT>
