   <HEADLINE> INITIAL PCS BIDS TAKEN ; TOTAL EXPECTED TO EXCEED $ 10 BILLION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With three bangs of his gavel , Vice_President Al Gore opened the bidding Monday in the federal_government ' s eagerly awaited auction of licenses for new mobile phones , declaring that the technology will create a_million jobs and transform the way Americans communicate . The auction of 99 licenses to offer so-called broad-band personal communications services is the first_step in a costly , high-stakes contest by some of the biggest names in telecommunications to bring a new type of wireless communications to the masses . The new services , expected to be launched in major markets within the next two years , will feature mobile communications devices that are smaller , cheaper and more powerful than existing cellular_telephones . As expected , Monday ' s initial round of bidding was subdued , with none of the 30 bidders quickly separating itself from the pack with a huge wager . Bids totaled $ 380 million , with 39 of the 99 PCS licenses drawing no bids at all . &quot; There were no great surprises ; it went pretty much as we anticipated , &quot; said Roy Berger , a member of one of the wealthiest teams -- the PSC Primco limited partnership made_up of AirTouch Communications and three regional Bell telephone_companies . Despite the deep-pockets competition , at least one small company , Micro Lithography of Sunnyvale , Calif. , held its own and emerged as the top bidder for two PCS licenses , with a bid of $ 20 # 000 for both . More typically , bids were in the multimillion-dollar range , with American Portable Telecommunications bidding nearly $ 51 million for a single PCS license . The 99 licenses on the block are for regional markets , with smaller market licenses to be sold early next year . In the end , about 2 # 100 PCS licenses will be auctioned , with total proceeds expected to exceed $ 10 billion . About $ 4 billion of the auction money has already been earmarked to reduce the federal_deficit . But expectations are high that the bids will exceed that amount , and politicians at Monday ' s opening quickly floated proposals on ways to spend the extra cash .</TEXT>
