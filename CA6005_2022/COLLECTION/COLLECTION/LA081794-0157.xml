   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; AN UNCIVIL WAR OVER DISNEY PLAN ; FAMILIES , FRIENDS AND EVEN VENERABLE HISTORIANS FEUD OVER PROPOSED HISTORY PARK NEAR A VIRGINIA BATTLEFIELD . WHAT LIES BENEATH ALL THE SOUND AND FURY ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are no cannons exploding this time , no thundering hoofbeats or trumpeted calls-to-arms . But in the quiet country that lies between Washington and the Blue Ridge Mountains , a full-scale battle has been joined . And as was often said about an earlier conflict in these hills and valleys : there ain ' t nothing civil about it . Today ' s troops are fighting for economic truth and justice . They are battling about building . Hovering over the whole dispute is this question : Whose history is it , anyway ? These contemporary combatants are crossing swords over a plan by the Walt Disney Co . to build a 3 # 000-acre history theme park and mixed-use development four miles from the Civil War battlefield at Manassas -- Bull_Run to Northerners . Cost estimates range from $ 650 million to $ 1 billion . In an eerie echo of the past , the conflict is dividing friends , neighbors and families . Both sides in what is sometimes called the Third Battle of Bull_Run routinely trade lethal-impact verbal volleys . &quot; This is serious , &quot; said Robert Singletary , a Haymarket business consultant who heads a group called Welcome Disney . &quot; It ' s just as serious as war. &quot; The dispute over Disney ' s America , as the proposed entertainment_center is called , has galvanized factions from across the social and political spectrum . Former White_House Press Secretary Jody Powell -- who boasts that nine ancestors wore the gray uniforms of Johnny_Reb -- serves as a public relations consultant to Disney . Opposite him is another ex-White House employee , presidential speech writer and onetime presidential candidate Pat Buchanan , who fulminates that the land on which Disney intends to build &quot; belongs_to all Americans , past , present and generations to come , and we have a duty to posterity to preserve it. &quot; Environmentalists -- who fear traffic , urban_sprawl and potential damage to the Shenandoah National Forest 35 miles away -- are met head-on by growth proponents who argue that because development is inevitable , why not turn it over to a friendly , responsible steward like the Walt Disney Co. ? Families who protest that they will lose the small-town serenity that seems remarkable just one hour from downtown Washington are labeled not-in-my-backyard-ists by groups with names such_as Friends of the Mouse and Patriots for Disney . Accusing their adversaries of elitism , NIMBYism and &quot; economic no-growthism , &quot; these forces contend that tax_revenues will soar , and the project will infuse this sparsely settled region with commercial vitality . Those who welcome Disney ' s America insist the opposition ' s behind-the-scenes strategists are a handful of wealthy landowners whose estates and horse farms lie close to the development site . Detractors counter that Disney ' s America will only fatten the coffers of an already-rich corporate kingdom . But the fiercest fusillades have been saved for an unusual coalition of historians . Although they assert that they simply question the wisdom of locating a theme park in a region damp with what Civil War scholar C . Vann Woodward has labeled &quot; the blood , sweat and tears of American history , &quot; they have been depicted as trying to control the very field of American history itself . Champions of &quot; the Mouse &quot; say these turf-conscious intellectuals are effete , narrow-minded and possessive about their subject . Further , they charge that these writers and academics are pawns of the horsy_set , who have marched the historians out_to serve as their front_lines . &quot; Now you take someone like David McCullough , &quot; Singletary said . &quot; He ' s a fine author , but he ' s out of his field on this one . He doesn ' t have an exclusive_right on who writes history . He ' s just being used. &quot; Nonsense , retorted McCullough , a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who narrated public television ' s 1990 &quot; Civil War &quot; series . He was among the first of more_than 200 historians who last spring formed Protect Historic America , which exists solely to oppose Disney ' s America . Disney supporters -- who include Virginia Gov . George Allen as well as the state ' s two U.S. senators -- portrayed the organization as a bunch of stuffy eggheads who hadn ' t spent enough time outside their ivory_towers to understand what real Americans want to know about their country ' s past . Upbraiding Disney for planning to &quot; plasticize &quot; history , Protect Historic America ' s forces retaliated by defending existing historical resources , such_as the museums that abound_in nearby Washington . For good measure , the group has circulated Disney Chairman Michael D . Eisner ' s own recollection that being &quot; dragged &quot; to the nation ' s capital as a boy &quot; was the worst weekend of my life. &quot; But rather than engaging in a historical shouting match , McCullough said , his compatriots ' goal is to preserve &quot; some of the most scenic and historic land in America , &quot; gentle land that was home to four of the first five presidents . McCullough said his group ' s real objections come_down to the simplest , most sacred canon of American real_estate : location , location , location . &quot; We are not against Disney ' s aspirations to do American history , &quot; he said . &quot; What we are against , adamantly , is where they want to put it. &quot; Eisner has responded to these arguments by noting that the 3 # 000-acre tract is private , and &quot; we have a right &quot; to build_on it . The site served as a campground for Union and Confederate troops alike , said Protect Historic America President James McPherson , a Princeton professor of history and author of 11 Civil War books . During the war , skirmishing took_place in Haymarket itself . These days , many of its 431 inhabitants can be found at Kris and Karen ' s Subs and Salads , debating what is referred to only as &quot; Disney. &quot; &quot; It ' s all anybody talks_about , &quot; said Ziba Dearden , who shoes horses in the affluent hunt country . The talk bypasses the historians -- &quot; They have no influence , anyway , &quot; Dearden said -- and goes well beyond the proposed park . Disney officials said its content has not been finalized , but a Lewis and Clark raft ride is often mentioned , as is a virtual-reality display in which visitors can join Civil War battles . A high-speed ride through the Industrial Revolution , concluding with a narrow_escape from a vat of molten metal , has also been discussed . After some criticism , an attraction that would have allowed visitors to &quot; experience &quot; slavery apparently has been shelved . Along with Disney ' s America would come a subdivision of more_than 2 # 000 homes . A comprehensive plan approved by the supervisors of Prince William County would permit up_to 2 million square_feet of commercial development . Eighteen-story office_buildings would be allowed to rise from grassy hills . A water park is among the features of a 2-foot-thick development plan , as are 1 # 300 hotel_rooms , two golf_courses and a 283-acre campsite . Unrelated to Disney , a 21 # 000-seat concert amphitheater is in the works . Tim Thompson , owner of a general_store in the nearby hamlet of Thoroughfare , is enthusiastic about plans to build a thoroughbred track and a Formula One automobile racetrack . Thompson said the attractions could be an economic bonanza . &quot; Business-wise , I ' d have to be out of my mind not to want these things , &quot; he said . But foes of the Disney project think it ' s crazy to permit large-scale development on land they consider hallowed not only historically , but also environmentally . The area ' s historic towns and Civil War sites have retained their charm and authenticity in large part because of assiduous conservation efforts , said Tim Lindstrom of the nonprofit Piedmont Environmental Council . Far from worrying about what kind of history might be portrayed in a theme park , Lindstrom , an attorney and zoning law specialist at the University of Virginia , said the group is concerned about the impact on the land . The Disney development , he said , &quot; is like a double-barreled shotgun aimed directly at the heart of the land we are trying to protect. &quot; But what Disney foes fear most is sprawl . In an impassioned day of testimony in June before the Senate subcommittee on public lands , Richard Moe , head of the National Trust for Historic Preservation , painted a grim prospect of a landscape despoiled by T-shirt shops and fast-food havens . &quot; Road rash &quot; is just one of the evocative phrases he used . In his headquarters in Gainesville , a_few miles from the Haymarket site , Mark Pacala , the senior_vice_president and general_manager of Disney ' s America , said arguments about sprawl have been &quot; spectacularly sensationalized. &quot; He said discussions about gridlock and garish T-shirt shops are linchpins of a &quot; scare tactic campaign. &quot; Fears about &quot; millions and millions of square_feet of commercial space , about new towns -- it ' s ridiculous , &quot; he said . Because Disney ' s America is intended to be a &quot; one-day destination &quot; for visitors who are already in the Washington area , &quot; it ' s just not logical . It ' s not going_to be the economic locomotive to generate all that stuff. &quot; Such reassurance offers scant comfort to Pat Blackwell , a Haymarket resident who launched a grass-roots group called Protect within days of last November ' s announcement that &quot; the Mouse &quot; was coming_to town . Blackwell said Protect is most concerned about &quot; the sprawl and the pollution that a Disney would bring in. &quot; With Disney ' s own projections calling_for up_to 35 # 000 automobile visits per day , Blackwell said she worries that her view of the mountains will all but disappear . Pollution frightens her , she said , adding , &quot; Air ' s a necessity , that ' s a fact. &quot; Initially , said fellow Haymarket resident Linda Budreika , the park sounded &quot; sort of interesting. &quot; But after watching Disney ' s presentations , &quot; movies about Walt Disney and the Imagineers , &quot; Budreika said , doubts set_in . Soon this suburban mother of four was among protesters at the Washington opening of the Disney movie &quot; The Lion King , &quot; loudly chanting , &quot; Hey , ho , Eisner ' s got_to go. &quot; Budreika dismissed the Disney suggestion that the park would provide jobs for residents . Prince William County ' s unemployment_rate is less than 3 % , &quot; and when you ' re talking_about the low-paying jobs , places like McDonald ' s and Wendy ' s , the ' Help Wanted ' signs are all_over , &quot; she said . &quot; The infrastructure isn ' t there , &quot; Budreika said . &quot; The need for low-income housing and social_services is going_to be greater than the benefits. &quot; Charging that Disney has evaded such objections , she said , &quot; they ' re masters of illusions , they say everything will be fine . Can Dumbo fly ? &quot; That kind of criticism only supports Disney Vice_President John Dreyer ' s belief that much of the project ' s opposition reduces to plain old NIMBYism : &quot; I think it ' s very similar to the arguments you ' ve heard about a dozen projects around the country -- which is , ' I ' m here , I don ' t want anyone else to come. ' &quot; While he is not entirely happy to admit it , Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Richard Ketchum of Dorset , Vt. , one of the founders of Protect Historic America , said there may be some truth to this assertion . &quot; I ' m afraid that the ' location ' business is a bit of NIMBY , &quot; he said . But Disney has been swift to employ &quot; the so-called ' wise-use ' attitude -- meaning , ' This is my land and nobody ' s going_to tell me what to do with it , ' &quot; Ketchum said . &quot; Disney has been_on that particular tack ever since anybody raised a voice against them. &quot; But with its &quot; very well-recognized &quot; profile , Dreyer said , Disney makes a handy target , for &quot; a kind of fraternity and sorority of people who live_out there and who are well-connected to the media and the politicians. &quot; The implication that he and his fellow historians might be lumped in along with &quot; elitists and fox_hunters &quot; also irked Ketchum . &quot; Eisner ' s not exactly a beer-drinker , you know , &quot; he pointed_out . &quot; If you want to talk_about elitism , last year he earned $ 203 million. &quot; ( Eisner declined to be interviewed because &quot; he ' s said all he needs to &quot; about the project , Dreyer said. ) To bolster its share of the historical debate , Disney has brought_in its own experts . Civil War authority Shelby Foote has said he was approached , but joined up with Protect Historic America . Two prominent historians who are consulting on the Disney project are Eric Foner of Columbia University and James Oliver Horton of George_Washington University . Both were_on leave and were unavailable for comment . But A . Wilson Greene , head of the Assn . for the Preservation of Civil War Sites in Fredericksburg , Va. , said his 200-member organization had agreed to provide &quot; historical advice and research &quot; in exchange for consulting fees and a $ 100 # 000 donation from Disney . &quot; I have to make_it very clear , we are not shills for Disney , &quot; Greene said . &quot; We are not proponents for Disney ' s America ; neither are we opponents . Unlike some of the critics of Disney , we have met them and dealt with them. &quot; From the standpoint of battlefield preservation , his own specialty , Greene said , Disney ' s America does not represent the sole threat &quot; to the 15 or so Civil War engagement sites in the Haymarket area . &quot; There are battlegrounds all across this area that are teetering on the brink of destruction that has nothing to do with Disney , &quot; he said . Still , Greene admitted that he was not entirely comfortable with every aspect of Disney ' s plan to &quot; tell and teach history &quot; through entertainment and virtual_reality . &quot; The image that you may be trivializing the Civil War , involving the deaths of more_than 600 # 000 people -- that is offensive , &quot; he said . Washington transportation planner Courtney Gallop-Johnson , founder and chair of a group called the Black History Action Coalition , said that possibility was the crux of her organization ' s opposition to the project . She said the coalition is made_up of &quot; African Americans who share a grave concern with Disney ' s plan to portray slavery as part of a theme park . We don ' t think that it is a historically dignified or accurate portrayal , or suitable fare for an amusement park. &quot; Worrying , for example , that &quot; little souvenir slave_ships &quot; may be_on sale , Gallop-Johnson said it would also be insulting for slavery to be overlooked . But in his own testimony on Capitol_Hill , Disney Design and Development Corp . President Peter Rummell rebuffed the suggestion that his project was in any way vulgarizing history or plundering sacred ground . &quot; Those are harsh words for a production that not only hasn ' t opened , but hasn ' t even been fully written , &quot; Rummell said . Disney vice_president Dreyer observed that movies and novels have helped spark interest in the Civil War . Participants in modern-day re-enactments regularly pretend to be Union or Confederate_soldiers , he noted . And &quot; living history &quot; sites such_as Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia or Plimoth Plantation in Massachusetts might also be seen as theme parks , Dreyer said . Weary of their depiction as elitists , the historians said those arguments would get no disagreement from them because much of their discipline is interpretive anyway . Shifting the discussion that way is &quot; a red_herring , &quot; Protect Historic America ' s McPherson said , adding , &quot; you don ' t need a license to practice history. &quot; Before its scheduled opening in 1998 , the park must hopscotch through more_than 70 stages of approval from three dozen local , state and federal agencies . Disney officials say they will hold_firm . Arranging tomatoes at his family ' s stand six miles from the proposed park , William Coffey said he was prepared_for the traffic , and even for the possibility that the Manassas battlefield might have a neighbor with roller_coasters . &quot; But what I hate to see , &quot; Coffey said , &quot; is all this arguing. &quot; Details of the Disney Development Disney ' s America is projected to be the centerpiece of 3 # 000-acre site on rolling farmland near the junction of Interstate 66 and U.S. Route 15 in Haymarket , Va. , 35 miles from Washington . A history theme park will occupy approximately 100 acres , with the remainder used for houses , commercial space and recreational_facilities . Projected opening : 1998 Completion costs : $ 650 million to $ 1 billion . Visitors per day : Up to 30 # 000 Content : Disney officials remain vague about what the theme park will offer . An Industrial Revolution-themed thrill ride has been discussed ; an exhibit that would allow visitors to &quot; experience &quot; slavery apparently has been tabled . Eisner ' s view : Disney Chairman Michael Eisner has stressed that objections to the park ' s content are premature , like &quot; reviewing a movie before the script is written. &quot; To charges that his project may be plasticizing history , Eisner replies : &quot; The First_Amendment gives you the right to be plastic. &quot; Previous plan : Prince William County officials originally approved plans to build more_than 4 # 000 houses on the same land parcel . That project fell_into financial trouble before the Disney project was undertaken . State help : The Virginia General_Assembly approved a $ 163-million bond measure to improve the area ' s roads to accommodate Disney , with the expectation that tax_revenues would more_than make_up for that figure . The location : Four miles from the perimeter and seven miles to the entrance of the Manassas battlefield -- where the first and second Battles of Bull_Run took_place during the Civil War . Surrounded by History There is no need to manufacture historical displays in an area full of actual Civil War battlefields , critics say .
