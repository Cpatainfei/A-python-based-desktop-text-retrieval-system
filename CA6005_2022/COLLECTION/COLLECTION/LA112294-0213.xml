   <HEADLINE> BLOOD_MONEY ; MEDICINE : TINY HEMACARE HAS A POTENTIALLY PROMISING PLASMA TECHNIQUE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST AIDS . BUT THE COMPANY NEEDS $ 10 MILLION MORE TO FINISH THE PROJECT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the fight against AIDS , it ' s often easier to drum_up hope than money . that ' s been the experience at HemaCare Corp. , a small , money-losing blood-plasma products company now at a turning point in its struggle to fund research on a potential treatment for AIDS . It ' s not intended as a cure or a vaccine . The treatment involves what is known as passive hyperimmune plasma therapy . Whole plasma , the liquid part of blood that contains proteins , is taken from donors who are HIV-positive but are in the earliest stages of the disease and have healthy immune_systems . The plasma is sterilized , then infused into other patients whose AIDS is further advanced and whose immune_systems are failing , in hopes of slowing the disease . Some doctors and AIDS patients , tired_of waiting for a so-called magic_bullet against AIDS , say anything that shows some sign of helping should be pursued . HemaCare has &quot; got a promising HIV therapy and it ' s been held_up in development because the company is undercapitalized , &quot; said Dr. Paula Sparti , a physician in Miami who treats AIDS patients . &quot; This should go_forward , and it ' s not going_forward clearly because of money. &quot; Since buying rights to the therapy -- called Immupath -- in 1989 from Montreal-based Medicorp Inc. , HemaCare has plowed nearly $ 8.5 million into its development . The company has lost money four straight years , as the research costs absorbed profits from its main business of collecting plasma and platelets from donors to sell to hospitals and providing mobile treatment services for blood-disorder patients . Last year HemaCare lost $ 2.5 million on revenues of $ 11.8 million , and through the first nine months of this year it lost another $ 1.6 million on revenue of $ 8.2 million . And before the next and most expensive phase of research can go_forward , HemaCare must persuade investors to pony_up another $ 10 million to complete the final phase of human trials before going_to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of the treatment . Meanwhile , HemaCare ' s current cash reserves are only about $ 1 million . Promising results from clinical trials on 220 patients in 1991 were presented to a conference of scientists in New York last month . HemaCare ' s CEO Hal Lieberman concedes that a dearth of capital has slowed research , but he says the firm won ' t give_up . &quot; This is too good a product to walk away from , &quot; he said . The company has held discussions with several potential partners , Lieberman said , although it has failed in past years to find the right partner . HemaCare ' s research has drawn the attention of hundreds of AIDS patients , including some so convinced of its merits that they volunteered as guinea_pigs for the human trials , thus giving HemaCare the most precious thing they have : their time . The therapy is based on the observation that people with the human_immunodeficiency_virus can stay healthy for years before their immune_systems deteriorate . Investigators think the reason is that the body mounts a successful attack against the AIDS virus at first but is slowly overwhelmed . By transferring plasma from healthy , HIV-infected patients to less healthy ones , they hope to capture the antibodies produced in the early stages of infection and transfer them to patients whose immune_systems are worn down . It ' s a relatively low-tech approach to the disease , and it ' s certainly not a cure . But advocates speculate that Immupath could slow the progress of AIDS and reduce some of its symptoms , essentially &quot; holding the virus in check , &quot; explained Dr. Joshua Levy , HemaCare ' s medical director , who leads Immupath research . Because the treatment consists_of infusions of proteins the body naturally produces , it ' s unlikely to create the toxic side_effects of antiviral drugs , such_as AZT , Levy contends . And because it pools different antibodies from many donors , the treatment may stand a better chance of remaining effective despite the HIV virus ' constant mutations , he argues . * HemaCare ' s most recent study showed some encouraging results . Only one of the 21 people receiving the largest doses of plasma died during the yearlong study , while in a similar group of 21 people receiving a placebo , six died . Due_to the results , all_the participants are now receiving the therapy instead of a placebo and will continue even though their portion of the study has ended . The company must now get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to go_forward with testing Immupath on 400 people with AIDS . The FDA has put the approval on hold pending additional studies of the product ' s safety . Michael Dwiggins , 45 , is among the HIV-positive volunteers who took_part in the earlier study . His condition was diagnosed in 1990 and he was probably infected several years before . The HemaCare plasma transfusions are lengthy and uncomfortable , but &quot; you feel quite energized afterward , &quot; he said . Since beginning the therapy , he said , his condition has remained fairly stable . At least two other limited studies on passive hyperimmune therapy have recorded some similar effects , although one study of advanced AIDS patients in New York recorded no great benefit . Despite some promising results , skepticism has long dogged HemaCare ' s efforts . After all , AIDS has preoccupied the world ' s best scientists and biggest medical-research companies for years , and HemaCare seems an obscure and unlikely contender . Moreover , Wall_Street is less than enthused with HemaCare ' s recent studies . The price of HemaCare ' s stock has declined more_than 40 % since March of this year , and closed Monday at $ 3.50 per share . Although HemaCare ' s approach is reasonable , antibodies are just one element of the immune_system ' s response to infection , said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes , assistant_professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver . Many scientists think they may be among the least effective of those mechanisms , he said . Other treatments , such_as hormones that stimulate the immune_system and gene therapies , show more promise and may prove more economical , he said . Critics are even more doubtful about whether wide-scale treatment of AIDS using passive hyperimmune therapy is feasible . For Immupath to work , HemaCare must have a constant stream of HIV-positive plasma donors who are willing to give plasma every few weeks . Dr. Michael Roth , a Beverly Hills physician who treats AIDS patients with the still-experimental passive hyperimmune therapy , said the treatment appears to be beneficial but organizing a steady parade of donors for his practice is &quot; cumbersome and time-consuming. &quot; Donors drop_out , even when they are paid , and replacements must be recruited . &quot; This will never be a large-scale treatment . . . . You can ' t mass-produce it like a pill , &quot; Roth said . Financial analysts also doubt that this treatment will ever be a big moneymaker for HemaCare , even if it is effective . &quot; The issue is not , will it work ? It is , will it be practical ? &quot; said Joyce Lonergan , a biotechnology analyst with Cowen &amp; Co . in New York . HemaCare ' s Lieberman countered that organizing a national system of donor centers is exactly the sort of thing HemaCare -- a blood and plasma company -- does best . &quot; This drug will be expensive but so is getting sick , &quot; Lieberman said , adding that the treatment could cost about $ 1 # 000 per month per patient . &quot; What we are doing is cumbersome and expensive . . . . But there isn ' t anything else. &quot; The company is also considering testing a related product called intravenous immune gamma_globulin -- in_essence , a distillation of antibodies derived from human plasma . HemaCare is building a production plant in Valencia to mass-produce treated whole plasma as well as the more concentrated immune gamma_globulin . But , of course , for all this to happen HemaCare needs more money and encouraging results both in the lab and on Wall_Street .</TEXT>
