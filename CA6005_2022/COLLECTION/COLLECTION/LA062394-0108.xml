   <HEADLINE> SHELTON STICKS IT TO STICH ON COURT 2 ; WIMBLEDON : AMERICAN STUNS FORMER CHAMPION IN FIRST ROUND , 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-4 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stick another tombstone outside infamous Court No . 2 , known as &quot; the graveyard of champions , &quot; and busier than ever Wednesday , as unseeded Bryan Shelton shocked the late great second-seeded Michael Stich in three &quot; did-you-see-that ? &quot; sets . The American ' s 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-4 victory so thoroughly exasperated Stich that the former Wimbledon champion stormed off the sun-soaked court and didn ' t bother to look_back , not even as a chorus of boos from the standing-room-only crowd of 3 # 000 followed each angry step . Earlier , the games slipping_away one by one , Stich had delivered a wonderful overhead smash to his equipment bag , followed soon thereafter by another tantrum that left a thin divot in the turf . &quot; You can ' t expect a player when he loses in three sets , having high expectations , to smile and say , ' Thank_you very much , it was a great day , ' &quot; Stich fumed afterward . Shelton was one of several Americans , some prominent , some not , who won Wednesday . Andre Agassi , a former champion who is seeded 12th , needed nearly 3 1 / 2 hours and five sets to defeat Venezuela ' s Nicolas Pereira , 6-7 ( 7-4 ) , 6-3 , 6-4 , 6-7 ( 7-5 ) , 6-4 , to advance to the second round . Fifth-seeded Jim Courier , whose opening match was postponed Tuesday , beat Zimbabwe ' s Byron Black , 6-1 , 6-7 ( 7-5 ) , 6-3 , 6-4 . It was Courier ' s fourth victory over Black in as_many meetings . Top-seeded and defending champion Pete Sampras had a much easier time in his second-round match , defeating fellow American Richey Reneberg , 6-3 , 6-4 , 6-2 , in 87 minutes . No . 6 Todd Martin beat Germany ' s Patrick Kuhnen , 6-2 , 6-2 , 6-4 , and Michael Chang ground_out a 3-6 , 6-3 , 7-6 ( 7-6 ) , 6-7 ( 7-3 ) , 6-4 victory over Australian Michael Tebbutt . In women ' s play , Lori McNeil followed her upset of No . 1 Steffi Graf with a 6-3 , 6-7 ( 7-5 ) , 6-3 , victory over Japan ' s Yone Kamio . Ninth-seeded Lindsay Davenport of Murrieta reached the third round by beating South_Africa ' s Tessa Price , 6-4 , 6-2 , in 69 minutes . But it was Shelton ' s shocker that sent the most shivers down Wimbledon ' s back Wednesday . Until late last week , Shelton not only was unseeded , he was uninvited . The Georgia Tech graduate , his ranking an absolute rambling wreck at No . 120 , was reduced to having to earn one of the precious 16 qualifying spots for Wimbledon . He squeaked in -- his sixth Wimbledon appearance -- and then waited for the draw . The news was good . He got Stich . Since losing in the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year , Stich has done more diving than a Stuka . He lost in the first round of the 1993 U.S. Open , in the first round of this year ' s Australian Open and in the second round of the recent French Open . For Stich , the Slam events have been anything but Grand . Still , this was Bryan Shelton we were talking_about , the same guy who had never beaten a player ranked in the top five . A British journalist writing for the daily Wimbledon program said of the Stich match : &quot; The American Bryan Shelton is allocated the bleak task of attempting to inter him. &quot; Translation : Shelton , one of only two African-American male players on the pro circuit , began the tournament with more losses than victories this season , 14-12 . His previous claim to fame was serving as a ballboy to Jimmy Connors during a 1977 match in Birmingham , Ala . Surely Stich could beat him . He couldn ' t . For only the second time in Wimbledon history , a No . 2-seeded player was sent_packing after the opening round . It happened in 1931 . . . and then Wednesday . In short , another day , another upset , another American doing the heavy Wimbledon lifting . This time it was Shelton . A day earlier it was the unseeded McNeil , who beat Graf , merely the prohibitive favorite to win a fourth consecutive title . &quot; I played a guy today . . . he could have closed his eyes and he could have hit the ball wherever he wanted to hit it , &quot; Stich said . &quot; He had all_the luck on his side . I didn ' t have one lucky ball for myself. &quot; Shelton did have his share of shots that tripped over the net and fell_in for winners . He hit an awkward backhand off the racket frame for another point . He kept his serves mostly deep and continually frustrated Stich , who yelled to Shelton in disbelief , &quot; Are you OK ? &quot; Shelton was better than OK , he was magical . Stich , who didn ' t play well or poorly , could find no weaknesses in Shelton ' s usually erratic game . &quot; I think he felt_like I was playing really good tennis , &quot; said Shelton of Stich ' s on-court question . &quot; He felt I was playing above myself , and I did play good tennis today. &quot; He also had the ghosts of upsets past on his side . John McEnroe lost on Court 2 in 1979 . Connors staggered off its cozy , shaded confines in 1983 . Ilie Nastase lost there in 1973 , Arthur Ashe in 1976 , Vitas Gerulaitis in 1979 , Raul Ramirez in 1977 , Tim Mayotte in 1990 , Evonne Goolagong in 1974 . And now Stich , felled by the curse of Court 2 . &quot; So now I know what it means , &quot; Stich said . Stich made one brief attempt to get_back into the match . He was up , 2-0 , in the third set , but then watched helplessly as Shelton won the next four games . Stich held serve the next two times , but so did Shelton , who finally got the victory when the German ' s flailing backhand landed wide . Moments later , with Stich long gone , Shelton turned_to the audience , raised his arms in triumph and began pumping his fists . In the stands was his brother Nathaniel , an Army captain stationed in Germany who had traveled_to Wimbledon for the first time to see Bryan play . In Nathaniel ' s hands was a homemade sign . &quot; Go , Bryan , &quot; it read . He did , all_the way past Stich and into the second round . Reporters later surrounded Nikki Pilic , the German Davis Cup captain and Stich ' s occasional teacher . Was Stich injured ? Is there a problem ? &quot; He doesn ' t have a problem , &quot; Pilic said . &quot; The problem is , he didn ' t serve very well . The problem was Bryan. &quot; Wimbledon Notes Spain ' s Conchita Martinez , now considered one of the favorites in the women ' s singles , defeated Japan ' s Nana Miyagi , 6-1 , 7-6 ( 7-3 ) . . . . Third-seeded Stefan Edberg and No . 5 Jana Novotna also won their Wednesday matches . . . . Pete Sampras , on Bryan Shelton ' s upset of Michael Stich : &quot; A tough first-round match for anybody . I ' m surprised , but I ' m not that surprised . Upsets happen. &quot; And this : &quot; Out of all_the rounds , you feel a bit vulnerable in the first round or second. &quot;</TEXT>
