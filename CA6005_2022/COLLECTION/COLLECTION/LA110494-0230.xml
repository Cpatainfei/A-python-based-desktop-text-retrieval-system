   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS / STATE AND FEDERAL RACES ; CHARGES AND COUNTERCHARGES AS VOTE NEARS ; ASSEMBLY : EX-WIFE OF INCUMBENT CLAIMS HE SUFFERED FROM A ' SERIOUS GAMBLING ADDICTION. ' HE RESPONDS ANGRILY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In campaign literature that has been characterized by the incumbent as a &quot; Nixonian dirty trick , &quot; the ex-wife of Assemblyman Bill Hoge ( R-Pasadena ) claims that he suffered from a &quot; serious gambling addiction &quot; that contributed to the marriage ' s failure . The eleventh-hour allegation comes as Hoge is seeking reelection Tuesday while facing charges from Democratic opponent Bruce Philpott that the incumbent is a special friend of the gambling industry . Horse_racing interests , card clubs and a major Nevada casino have pumped $ 140 # 000 into Hoge ' s campaign coffers since 1992 , records show . As a freshman lawmaker , Hoge authored six bills to benefit horse_racing or card clubs , casting a number of votes_in favor of those interests . Hoge ' s receipt of gambling industry contributions helped earn him the No . 1 spot on California Common Cause ' s list of first-term Assembly members who raised special_interest money during the off-year of 1993 , when there was no election to pay_for . It also pegged him as vulnerable to a challenge by Democratic Party leaders working to unseat as_many Assembly Republicans as possible to ensure a Democratic majority and continued power base for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) . Unmentioned in the &quot; Dear Friend &quot; letters that the Philpott campaign is preparing to mail_out is the fact that Hoge ' s first marriage ended in divorce in 1971 . &quot; At that point in my life I was 22 or 23 years old , &quot; an angry Hoge , 48 , said in an interview , denying that he ever had a gambling problem . &quot; I didn ' t have enough money to be addicted to anything . This is a desperate ploy by a desperate candidate. &quot; On stationery that appears to come from American University in Washington , where Hoge ' s former wife , Nancy Flournoy , chairs the Department_of_Mathematics and Sciences , she writes : &quot; My ex-husband , Assemblyman Bill Hoge , had a serious gambling addiction during our marriage . It contributed to the failure of that marriage . &quot; It is shameful that he would introduce legislation to allow card rooms to extend credit to others who have that same addiction . I am so sorry. &quot; In an interview , Flournoy said she recalled times when she and Hoge would weekend in Las Vegas or Lake Tahoe and he would spend all night at gaming_tables . She said she also remembered occasions when he would wager on horse_races at Santa Anita . The Los Angeles Turf Club , which operates the track there , is one of Hoge ' s major contributors , giving him $ 31 # 500 since 1992 . &quot; Bill would get_to the blackjack tables and become so fixated on them that the rest of the world would disappear , &quot; Flournoy said . &quot; I was not happy with the prospects of that kind of activity. &quot; The couple , who met in high_school and married in July , 1967 , decided to break_up after Flournoy chose to attend graduate_school over Hoge ' s objections , she said . He sought a more traditional relationship in which the wife remained at_home , she said . &quot; It was for a combination of reasons , &quot; she said of the divorce , which was finalized in 1971 . &quot; It was the whole lifestyle issue . And it was him wanting to spend his time doing something I was not interested in. &quot; Both have remarried and have not spoken_to each other since 1971 , she said . Flournoy said she placed a call to the Philpott campaign late last week to volunteer her support after her mother , who lives_in the district , sent her some campaign literature . The 44th Assembly District stretches from Sunland-Tujunga to the San Gabriel Valley . Previously , Flournoy had been a financial contributor to Emily ' s List , a women ' s political fund-raising group , and Republicans for Choice , which backs abortion rights . Flournoy said she was a registered Republican until her concern over abortion rights caused her to change her party affiliation to Democrat . Her offer caught the attention of top party leaders who , fearing legal reprisals if Flournoy misrepresented herself , sought to verify her intentions and the validity of her letter before using it in the campaign . At Speaker Brown ' s request , the dean of Howard University ' s law_school in Washington met with Flournoy . &quot; I determined that she is who she said , she wrote the letter and she stood_by what it said , &quot; Judge Henry Ramsey of Howard University said . But Hoge flatly denied his former wife ' s account that he gambled at casinos . &quot; We ' re not talking bets at all , &quot; he said . As for his interest in horse-racing legislation , Hoge said it dates_back to when he and his late father , Ken , bred and raced_horses at Santa Anita years ago . &quot; My dad and I did this together as a father-son activity , &quot; Hoge said . The most controversial gambling bill Hoge authored would have expanded opportunities for card rooms and opened the door for gambling on credit . It was vetoed by Gov . Pete Wilson at the urging of Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren . Hoge defended a provision in the bill that would have enabled a city , without a vote of its residents , to annex an adjoining area with a card club . He said residents could still persuade their city_council to block such an annexation . He also defended the portion of the bill that would have allowed the state to enforce gambling debts . Opponents warned it would have encouraged gambling by credit_card . &quot; By golly , if you have gambling debts then you ought to be responsible_for them , ' Hoge said . In response to Hoge ' s charge Thursday that pulling his ex-wife into the campaign amounted to a &quot; Nixonian dirty trick , &quot; Philpott insisted that the disclosure is relevant because of Hoge ' s legislative record . &quot; It speaks_to the credibility and character of a candidate , &quot; Philpott said . But Hoge accused Philpott of being a hypocrite for criticizing him while accepting money from Democratic PACs that are themselves recipients of special-interest money . &quot; I am right up front telling the world where I got my campaign contributions from , &quot; Hoge said .</TEXT>
