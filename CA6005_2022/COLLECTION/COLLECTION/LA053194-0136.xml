   <HEADLINE> SCOTT HARRIS : POLITICS AND POTPIES : DINER MAKES TRACKS ; THIS ANTELOPE VALLEY EATERY IS KNOWN FOR GENEROUS SERVINGS AND A CURIOUS AMBIENCE , ESPECIALLY THE CHRONIC TREMORS OF PASSING FREIGHT_TRAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first thing you notice is the giant sign perched on the roof . &quot; EAT , &quot; it commands . Crazy Otto ' s Diner is that kind of place . Tucked between Sierra Highway and the Southern Pacific railroad_tracks , this Antelope Valley eatery is known for generous servings and a curious ambience , especially the chronic tremors of passing freight_trains . Three came_by at lunch the other day . The biggest , I ' d say , felt_like a 3.9. Crazy Otto ' s has worked hard to be a local legend . It has , for example , sued a competitor for allegedly stealing recipes for hash browns and chili . Like any landmark , it sells its own postcards . The souvenir commemorates the historic date of June 12 , 1993 , when Crazy Otto ' s cooked_up a 19 # 000-egg omelet , which the Guinness people certified as &quot; the world ' s largest. &quot; Such records are difficult to confirm . But at 1 # 364 square_feet , this entree should have included at least two bedrooms and a bath . Now another rendezvous with destiny is approaching . On June 14 -- that ' s right , just two days after the Omelet Anniversary -- this diner will serve_up its last_supper al freight . Crazy Otto ' s is being forced_out , an unlikely casualty of the political aftershocks of the Northridge earthquake . But don ' t shed tears for Crazy Otto ' s . A victim it isn ' t . To hear proprietor Scott Tranter , Crazy Otto ' s isn ' t just fighting the good fight . It ' s winning . Come June 17 , it will move two miles west , taking_over the building on the 20th Street West site now occupied by Dilligafs , another diner owned by Tranter . Alas , there is no railroad next door . In Tranter ' s telling , Crazy Otto ' s is the hero in a potboiler that involves the Southern Pacific , the Metropolitan Transit Authority ( MTA ) and Lancaster City_Hall . The struggle to save Crazy Otto ' s turned Tranter into a political propagandist . He isn ' t so bold as_to claim that the Crazy Otto ' s controversy cost Mayor Arnie Rodio his reelection . But Rodio ' s defeat , he adds , &quot; didn ' t really break my heart. &quot; It ' s a complicated tale . Understand , first , that when Tranter and his father-in-law , Donald Whitbeck , purchased Crazy Otto ' s in 1989 , they bought a business located on Southern Pacific land . Three years later , when Southern Pacific sold part of the adjoining right-of-way to the MTA for the ultimate extension of Metrolink , officials assured Tranter that the commuter rail would n ' t reach that far &quot; until after the turn of the century. &quot; But on Jan . 17 , that all changed . Broken freeways created an urgent demand for rail service between the Antelope Valley and the area known in these parts as &quot; down below. &quot; An interim rail service was initiated and MTA officials , eyeing an unexpected bonanza of federal disaster money , gave Crazy Otto ' s and neighboring businesses 90 days to vacate . The law , of course , requires Metrolink to compensate the business owners at fair market_value -- but value , of course , fluctuates with the economy . Metrolink ' s first offer for Crazy Otto ' s was about half the purchase_price in 1989 -- and $ 90 # 000 less than money still owed . that ' s when the worries really started . Nor did_it help that City_Hall didn ' t seem to care . When it looked as though Metrolink would be satisfied if Crazy Otto ' s simply remodeled its backside , Tranter says , City_Hall refused to issue building_permits . His suspicion is that city officials wanted them out_to make_way for the planned widening of Sierra Highway -- and they were happy to have Metrolink foot the bill . It was then that war was declared . &quot; SAVE CRAZY OTTO ' S DINER , &quot; the flyer proclaimed . First it tugs at the heartstrings , suggesting that many longtime employees , &quot; the same people you have come_to know and love , &quot; would lose their jobs . Then it goes_for the political jugular . &quot; We bought a business . In the name of progress , Metrolink is kicking us out and buying the building . There is no compensation for loss of business goodwill and no consideration for employee severance . With a large mortgage that must be paid off first , we may_not be left with any funds to use for rebuilding or relocation . The Lancaster City_Council has not even bothered to communicate with us . They have offered no support or assistance of any kind . Costco was offered a new building and money to move . PetsMart was offered $ 180 # 000 and free rent . And the saga continues . We ' ve all heard the horror stories . Now Crazy Otto ' s . . . has been sentenced to death with no reprieve. &quot; Then comes a sales pitch -- an appeal for customers to help_out in the crisis by purchasing gift certificates that could be redeemed at the new Crazy Otto ' s location , or would be refunded &quot; if , for some reason , we are prevented from reopening. &quot; Observers of Lancaster politics may admire the way Crazy Otto ' s made no mention of Mayor Rodio , yet scored a direct hit on the man who had become a lightning_rod of complaints over redevelopment policies . Truth is , Crazy Otto ' s was miffed that he ignored the world ' s largest omelet . If Gov . Wilson and the Palmdale mayor were impressed enough to send letters and issue proclamations , why not Lancaster ' s very own mayor ? Since that first flyer appeared , much has changed , all to the benefit of Crazy Otto ' s . The MTA has come_up with an offer that would enable Crazy Otto ' s to pay_off its mortgage and cover its move . Meanwhile , hundreds of customers have rallied to the cause , buying more_than $ 7 # 000 worth of gift certificates . ( Mayor Rodio , it seems , offered some sweet_talk , but Tranter would have none of it. ) The only people who may lose jobs , Tranter says , are the part-timers who staff Dilligafs . Judging by Tranter ' s smile , the crisis has passed . Of that I ' m not so sure . How can the new joint duplicate the original ? If you happen to be at the new Crazy Otto ' s and the place starts to shake , don ' t forget to duck for cover . Scott Harris ' column appears Tuesday , Thursday and Sunday .
