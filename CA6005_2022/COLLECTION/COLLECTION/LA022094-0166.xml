   <HEADLINE> VALLEY COMMENTARY ; LET ' S NOT STALL ; A COMPUTER-AIDED ' 90S VERSION OF HITCHHIKING CAN BE A RELIABLE , SAFE WAY OF MAKING ROADS LESS CONGESTED . THE SYSTEM WORKS WELL IN GERMANY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Earthquakes are here to stay . Traffic will be delivering aftershocks for a long_time to come . The pols insist that solutions to our car problems will be costly and difficult . But here ' s one that ' s cheap and easy . It ' s a form of hitchhiking based on a system used in Germany . It ' s a little more complicated and a lot safer than sticking_out your thumb or picking_up riders . Mitfahrerzentrale is a central ride-sharing agency that , with a simple phone_call , connects a driver traveling somewhere with an empty seat to a passenger going_in the same direction . It ' s hitchhiking computerized and made safe . On a recent business trip , I was impressed that Berliners , Hamburgers and residents of most major cities have the system , with a toll-free 24-hour phone_number that hooks_up riders with drivers on relatively short notice . The plan is well-used , especially among students and environmentalists . The number is in telephone_directories , on billboards near bus and subway stops and in tourist publications . It works ! Similar agencies exist in other European cities and England , where an outfit called Freewheelers has a system that includes photo IDs and extensive intercity trip-sharing . We have something vaguely similar called the Commuter Computer , operated since 1974 by Commuter Transportation Services . But it connects only commuters regularly going_to the same location . Hitchhiking was once widespread . However , thumbing a ride has declined in ratio to the increase of urban violence . Although I hitchhiked through my university years , I would n ' t chance it now . Some of the people inhabiting our roadsides might as well carry signs threatening , &quot; Don ' t give me a ride , or else ! &quot; But risk can be reduced , if not eliminated . A safe plan can be created for Valley residents . We would need an agency with access to police and Department of Motor_Vehicles files . It would issue &quot; hitchhiking licenses &quot; to riders and drivers . * Applicants would be required to pass a police-type inspection to eliminate those with aberrant or criminal backgrounds . Those qualified would be issued waterproof licenses prominently displaying their photographs , fingerprints , physical descriptions and a permit number . The licenses should be large enough to see from several feet away . Driver and hitchhiker would then regard one another and their corresponding licenses from a secure distance , before offering or accepting a ride . A woman could decide to travel only with another woman , for instance . Hitchhiking pickup spots could be established at bus_stops and freeway on-ramps . This would allow quick , safe entry and exit for passengers , requiring no tax dollars for new construction . Participants could go anywhere with greater speed , ease and comfort . It would be easier than driving solo , planning difficult ride-shares or waiting for the public_transport . One can imagine incentives to encourage safe hitching . One idea : coupon books good for 10 rides that a rider would buy for $ 5 , or 50 cents per ride . The driver could collect the coupons and redeem each stamp received for a 40-cent discount on a gasoline purchase . The 10-cent difference might be split between the service_station operator and the agency . * Byproducts could be increased social interaction and community friendliness , as former strangers exchange rides and conversation , and become acquainted . People that share are people that succeed . And that holds true for those torn by stress , or earthquakes . Without new taxes , this plan would give communities a way to reduce air_pollution , traffic congestion and petroleum consumption . And that , in turn , would bolster our quake-ridden economy .</TEXT>
