   <HEADLINE> U.S. MILITARY SCALING BACK MODEST RWANDA AID FORCE ; AFRICA : TROOPS REOPENED AIRPORT , SET_UP WATER_SYSTEM . SOME RELIEF GROUPS CALL PROGRAM TOO LITTLE , TOO LATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid signs of returning normalcy here in the capital , the U.S. military ' s humanitarian task_force has begun a gradual , quiet pullout -- just a month after President Clinton promised a &quot; massive &quot; American relief effort for this small country and its troubled people . Whether the American commitment has lived_up_to the President ' s promise is likely to remain a question of debate and perspective . The soldiers and Air_Force personnel on the ground here and in Goma , Zaire , although modest in number , said they believed that after a rocky beginning , their deployment ended_up saving lives and putting Rwanda on_the_road to reconstruction . But some private humanitarian groups , themselves overwhelmed by Rwanda ' s flood_tide of refugees , remained critical of how little was devoted to the crisis and how slowly the response came from American and other Western military_forces . &quot; Not a single nation of the world has decided that Rwanda matters , &quot; said John O ' Shea , director of the_Irish relief agency GOAL . &quot; It ' s been like trying to keep the tide back with our bare hands. &quot; &quot; I reject that , &quot; said U.S. Army Col . James R . McDonough , commander of the 210 American troops still on_duty Thursday in Kigali . The deployment was down from a high of 280 and will steadily decline as more of the Americans ' work is turned_over to the United Nations and Rwandans . &quot; The first thing we had to do here was stop the dying in Goma , &quot; McDonough said . &quot; The key to that was water . When we got there , 5 # 000 people a day were dying . When we left , that was down to fewer than 500 . Stopping the dying was a mission given , and met. &quot; U.S. troops were ordered into Central_Africa to assist in humanitarian efforts on July 22 , two days after a cease-fire was reached in Rwanda ' s civil_war . The first American soldiers arrived the next day to begin establishing water purification and transportation_systems in Goma , where almost 1 million refugees fled . Troops began pumping water on July 26 . This week , the operation was turned_over to private contractors and Goma-based troops pulled_out . In Kigali , the mission of U.S. forces was to bring the capital ' s war-damaged airport back into service . As of Thursday , up_to 40 flights a day were arriving with food , medicine and other relief supplies . By American count , 20 million tons of goods and equipment had passed_through the airport since it reopened for relief flights . As in Goma , the military now is incrementally turning_over its airport duties as private and U.N. workers can be trained . And by all accounts , the airport was operating as smoothly this week as any in this part of Africa , if not better -- with a working baggage system , clean floors and running water . Commercial flights here are to begin in days . The remainder of Kigali still suffers from lack of power and water -- both of which may be a month away , because of damage from the bitter 3 1 / 2-month civil_war . But other signs of a rebounding capital were evident this week : Shops and restaurants were opening , gasoline was available at service_stations and hotels were in business , even if some rooms remained ripped apart by shrapnel . &quot; There is a crust of normalcy over the place , but if you walk_around , suddenly your foot falls_through into the suppurating mess below . You ' ve got_to remember that nearly everyone here has lost half of their family , &quot; said David Shearer , a relief worker with Save the Children . From the beginning , the American contribution to Rwanda and its refugees has been the subject of some confusion . Although his advisers emphasized that the American mission would be limited , Clinton initially promised an aid effort that would rival the Kurdish relief operations after the Persian_Gulf_War . On July 30 , the President said , &quot; The United States must_not cease its efforts until the dying stops and the refugees have returned. &quot; But in the midst of a cholera epidemic that was killing hundreds by the hour , the American effort had put only 75 people on the ground in Goma , far fewer than private relief agencies that had little of the U.S. military ' s logistic capability . And a U.S. emergency airlift of supplies turned_out smaller than promised and included needless items , such_as mittens . At the end of July , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry traveled_to the region and said the American deployment could last a year or longer . But a week later , Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , arrived and began to talk_of turning the military duties over to contractors and pulling_out . &quot; Shorter rather than longer , &quot; was how he described the U.S. commitment . Now , Americans are in a measured retreat but with no final departure date announced . &quot; When we leave , we don ' t want anyone to notice , &quot; said Army spokesman Capt . Ryan Yantis . &quot; That doesn ' t mean we are sneaking_out , only that we want a systematic , logical and sequential transition. &quot; In one regard , the Americans can congratulate themselves for avoiding , so far , the violence that overtook U.S. relief efforts in Somalia . &quot; No one has been hurt . No one has been seriously ill , no serious disease . There have been no incidents with weapons , no one stepped_on a mine , no traffic accidents and no fights with locals , &quot; said McDonough .</TEXT>
