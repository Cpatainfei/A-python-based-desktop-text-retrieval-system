   <TEXT> With her left arm snared in the jaws of a killer crocodile , Sandy Rossi had to make a life-or-death decision . &quot; I knew from the beginning it was a choice between my arm and my life , &quot; she said . &quot; I chose to fight for my life. &quot; It was a fight she won , losing her arm but escaping_from one of the world ' s deadliest creatures . A year later , the 28-year-old Missouri woman is preparing to return this fall to the same remote African rain_forest where she was attacked . &quot; I have to -- that crocodile still has my watch , &quot; she joked . That sort of humor has helped Rossi overcome the trauma of the attack and the loss of her arm . The vanity license_plates on her car read &quot; BITN. &quot; &quot; I tried_for ' HOOK ' and they denied me that , &quot; she said . &quot; Then I went_for ' LEFTY , ' but that was taken too. &quot; The attack occurred in March , 1993 , in Zaire ' s Epulu River . Rossi was in the central African_nation as a tutor for the daughters of a husband-and-wife research team studying rain_forest flora and fauna . Rossi , the two girls and another American researcher had gone_to the river to bathe and escape the oppressive heat and humidity . As dusk fell , Rossi ordered the girls out of the water . She took a minute longer to rinse soap from her long , strawberry blond hair . that ' s when the crocodile attacked . The Epulu isn ' t normal habitat for the Nile_crocodile . Apparently , though , a lone croc had wandered down from another river . The Nile is one of the world ' s largest and most deadly crocodiles , said Charles Hoessle , director of the St . Louis Zoo and a crocodile expert . They measure_up to 30 feet long and feed_on large game . &quot; They don ' t seek_out humans , but they ' ll attack them like they would any other animal , &quot; Hoessle said . But this crocodile met its match in Sandy Rossi . &quot; Basically , I outlasted him , &quot; she said . As soon as the reptile clamped its jaws on her left forearm , it pulled her under water . &quot; I came_up groping_for air and yelled , ' Crocodile ! &quot; ' she recalled . Her friend , Ken Cochrane , thought she was kidding until Rossi managed to pull the animal ' s snout out of the water , where Cochrane could see his grip on her bloody forearm . &quot; It was at this point that Ken came running_over , &quot; she said . &quot; It was also at this point that the crocodile knew I would n ' t be an easy kill , so he started his death rolls. &quot; He rolled her under water repeatedly , trying to drown her , but Rossi surprised herself by remaining calm and clearheaded . &quot; You could just feel the power , &quot; Rossi said . &quot; He ' d yank me back and forth to see if I was dead yet . Then he ' d roll me some more. &quot; With help from Cochrane , Rossi struggled to her feet and , finally , her arm &quot; just basically came off. &quot; The crocodile , perhaps too exhausted to finish the kill , swam away . Natives have spotted that same crocodile several times since . A few months ago , he attacked and killed a 14-year-old boy in the Epulu . Hoessle said few humans survive in-water attacks by crocodiles . &quot; She ' s very lucky to be alive , &quot; he said . Since the attack , Rossi has become proficient with her prosthesis , a lightweight model developed by NASA . She works with weights and does aerobics as she prepares_for her return to Zaire , where she ' ll work with the same family she left_behind last March . Despite the brutal conditions in Zaire -- hot and humid , with no electricity or running water in Rossi ' s small hut -- she loved it . At night , Rossi and other Westerners would gather_in a screened-in porch with a view of the river . They ' d listen to the cackling noises and whistles of the rain_forest and feel the moist African air on their faces . &quot; We ' d sit_out there and say , ' God , we ' re so lucky to be here , ' &quot; Rossi said . Rossi befriended a tribe of Pygmies and learned to appreciate their spirit . &quot; Life in Africa is very hard on everybody -- there ' s always some sort of disease you can pick_up , &quot; she said . &quot; One of the ways the Africans get_by is they laugh_at everything . Somehow or another , they ' re able to see that life goes on. &quot; And like her Pygmy friends , Rossi has learned that life goes_on . She admits it ' s tough at times . &quot; I don ' t think you ' re ever quite over it , &quot; she said . &quot; But then again , I did not fight for my life for 20 minutes to come_back and be depressed . It ' s much too important to get_on_with my life. &quot; Hoping to become more involved in rain_forest research upon her return to Zaire , Rossi has been studying at the Missouri Botanical Garden and the zoo in St . Louis . At the zoo , Rossi often finds herself at the crocodile pits . &quot; I ' ll just stand there and look_at the crocodiles , &quot; she said . &quot; But I don ' t fear them. &quot;</TEXT>
