   <HEADLINE> DIXY LEE RAY , FORMER HEAD OF U.S. ATOMIC AGENCY , DIES ; POLITICS : THE OUTSPOKEN EX-GOVERNOR OF WASHINGTON STATE WAS KNOWN FOR HER SUPPORT OF THE NUCLEAR INDUSTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dixy Lee Ray , former chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Washington state governor , died Sunday at her home on Fox Island . She was 79 . Miss Ray had suffered from a severe bronchial condition for several months , said KIRO-TV commentator Lou Guzzo , a longtime friend . Miss Ray showed her mettle early . At 12 , she became the youngest_girl to climb Mt . Rainier , Washington ' s highest peak , located between Seattle and her Tacoma birthplace . Fifty years later , at 62 , she was sworn_in as the state ' s first woman governor -- the only one so far . &quot; I guess I ' m a late bloomer , &quot; the Democrat quipped . An outspoken supporter of the nuclear industry , she headed the Atomic Energy Commission from 1973-75 . She served a single term as governor from 1977 to 1981 . Miss Ray issued her last no-nonsense commentary on nuclear issues Thursday , when she dismissed media reports about past federal radiation experiments as alarmist . She also took Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary to task for &quot; blaming all_of her predecessors for things she says are terrible. &quot; &quot; Everybody is exposed to radiation . . . . A little bit more or a little bit less is of no consequence , &quot; Miss Ray said in an interview with the Associated Press . She also had no patience for environmentalists she considered too strident . She and Guzzo , who was her policy adviser when she was governor , co-authored two books on the subject , &quot; Trashing the Planet &quot; in 1990 and &quot; Environmental Overkill &quot; in 1993 . Never one for artifice , Miss Ray set tongues wagging in 1972 , when President Richard Nixon appointed her to the AEC and she startled observers in Washington , D.C. , by living_in a motor_home and taking her dogs to work . When the AEC was phased_out , she was named assistant secretary_of_state , overseeing the Bureau of Oceans , International Environment and Scientific Affairs . Miss Ray returned to Washington state in 1975 , complaining that former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger had given her the cold_shoulder . Her straightforward political style frequently ruffled feathers . When she succeeded Gov . Dan Evans and dismissed virtually his entire Administration , promising &quot; change , change , change , &quot; a public outcry followed . She dismissed that , too . &quot; No one owns a job , &quot; she said . &quot; From now on , we ' ll send them a Kleenex at the time they ' re fired if they ' re going to be a crybaby. &quot; She battled with reporters throughout her term , complaining that they were &quot; bitten with the bug of cynicism &quot; and unfair to her . Her popularity plummeted over the four years , and she failed to win her party ' s nomination for reelection in 1980 . She blamed the media for her defeat . Her candor while in office was considered refreshing by many , and her fiscally conservative approach to government had supporters . A Boeing Co . lobbyist called her &quot; the best_friend business ever had. &quot; In 1986 , Miss Ray was named a director of American Ecology Corp. , a toxic_waste management firm based in Agoura Hills . Ironically , while governor she had shut_down one of the company ' s low-level nuclear waste dumps in Washington state . She did so , she later told The Times , because &quot; the people who generate the waste weren ' t packaging it properly. &quot; But the company itself , she said , was not to blame . In her later years , Miss Ray also served as a consultant to the U.S. Department_of_Energy and the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico . A short , chunky woman with cropped hair and tailored clothes , Miss Ray was born Sept . 3 , 1914 , in Tacoma , one of five girls . Christened Margaret , she was called Dick as a child -- short for &quot; that little Dickens. &quot; She renamed herself after a favorite region and a Civil War general . Miss Ray never married . She earned her undergraduate degree at Mills College and a doctorate in zoology at Stanford_University . Before entering public life , she was an associate_professor of zoology at the University of Washington for 27 years and director of the Pacific Science Center for nine years .</TEXT>
