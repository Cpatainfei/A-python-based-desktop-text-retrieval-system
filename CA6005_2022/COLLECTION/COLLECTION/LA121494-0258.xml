   <HEADLINE> NO SINGLE CAUSE FOUND FOR ' GULF WAR SYNDROME '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Defense_Department said Tuesday that it has been unable to find any medical evidence pointing to a single cause for the widely reported &quot; Gulf War syndrome , &quot; but it vowed to intensify its research and to set_up special centers to treat the illness . In a preliminary report , officials said examinations of 1 # 019 Persian_Gulf_War veterans who have complained of unusual symptoms show that 85 % of the cases involve already recognizable illnesses , from arthritis to sleep_disorders . &quot; There is no magic_bullet , &quot; Stephen Joseph , assistant secretary_of_defense for health affairs , told reporters at a briefing Tuesday . &quot; We don ' t find . . . any indication of a single . . . causality that would cover that broad spectrum. &quot; Pentagon officials emphasized Tuesday that they are not trying to suggest that there is no such illness as Gulf War syndrome , or that the veterans who have complained of such symptoms may be only imagining them . But Joseph and Robert Roswell , executive_director of the Gulf Veterans ' Coordinating Board , said that in 85 % of the cases studied , the symptoms were found to have stemmed from one or more common illnesses that are treatable -- and are to be expected in such a war . Department officials said the military will establish two special treatment centers for those whose cases so far have defied diagnosis , and said the White_House will propose spending an extra $ 15 million to $ 20 million next year to continue the research . The announcements are likely to disappoint some veterans , who contend they suffer from a new disease and complain that the Pentagon has been unresponsive . Some Gulf War veterans say they believe that the syndrome -- which they describe as mysterious and untreatable -- is being passed_on to their spouses and children . The Pentagon has denied that the veterans were exposed to life-threatening chemicals . Physicians said the 1 # 019 cases reflected in Tuesday ' s report represent a significant sample of veterans who have sought treatment for Gulf War syndrome . Of the 697 # 000 who served in_Operation Desert Storm , 11 # 000 have complained of illness . Some 8 # 000 are being processed . Melanie Ayers , a Fayetteville , N.C. , military spouse who heads Gulf War_Babies , an organization of parents whose children have been afflicted , said the studies so far have been flawed because they have only involved volunteers and have not reviewed a broad enough sample . &quot; What they said ( in Tuesday ' s report ) doesn ' t make that much difference , &quot; Ayers said in a telephone_interview . Defense officials &quot; need to get their act together and organize what they are doing. &quot; The common illnesses Pentagon officials said were responsible_for most of the symptoms included circulatory and digestive problems , infections , specific injuries and blood_disorders . About one-fourth of those evaluated reported psychological problems , including depression , headaches , post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety . Officials said the remaining 15 % still are a mystery , but said it is unlikely that they would point to any one cause , either . Joseph also dismissed speculation by some veterans ' groups that the syndrome may stem from exposure by soldiers to a toxic chemical_agent or combination of chemicals , such_as insect_repellent and pyridostigmine bromide , which was taken by some soldiers as a vaccine . The treatment centers the Pentagon is establishing will be based at Walter Reed Army Medical_Center in Washington , D.C. , and at the U.S. Air_Force Medical_Center and Brooke Army Medical_Center in San Antonio , Tex .</TEXT>
