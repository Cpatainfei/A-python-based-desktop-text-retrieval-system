   <HEADLINE> WITH PREMIUM ON UNLEASHED FURY , BOXING HAS GIVEN JAMES TONEY . . . ; LICENSE TO RAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Perhaps only in boxing is uncontrollable rage something to be nurtured rather than reported to the proper authorities . James Toney is , by all appearances , a two-fisted time_bomb , unfit for circulation in the mainstream . Bill Miller , the fighter ' s 74-year-old trainer , acknowledges that the anger that makes Toney unbeatable in the ring makes him frightening outside it . &quot; I tell him a lot of times , ' Young_man , if there wasn ' t any game like boxing , you would self-destruct , ' &quot; Miller says . &quot; You can ' t take that type of mental_attitude out_in the business world every day. &quot; Where would Toney be if not for boxing ? &quot; Dead , &quot; Miller says without hesitation . &quot; Out there today , these kids carry pistols . They shoot each other . Who ' s going_to fight him fair ? I tell him all_the time , ' James , all_the tough_guys are dead. ' &quot; Jackie Kallen , Toney ' s 48-year-old manager , knows her hell-bent champion will someday have to walk the streets as Joe Citizen . It scares her . &quot; If the plumber shows_up late , you can ' t just come_up and slam him to the ground , &quot; she says . &quot; You have to deal with people. &quot; So far , though , rage has paid Toney nice dividends . There is time later for therapy to purge his demons , to psychoanalyze how a man ' s father might come_to shoot his mother six times while cradling a baby -- James -- in her arms . The prescription so far has been to harness Toney ' s raw energy and pent-up anger and then unleash it with calculated detonations between the ropes every few months , cash a paycheck , then line_up the next victim . Toney , you might say , is Jackie Kallen ' s Manhattan_Project . &quot; It ' s helped me 46 times , &quot; Toney says . Toney is 44-0-2 , is considered one of the world ' s best pound-for-pound fighters and is poised to defend his International Boxing Federation super middleweight title against Roy Jones Jr . on Friday night at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas , where people are walking on eggshells . Toney , 26 , is the modern-day Jake LaMotta , the original Raging Bull who is Toney ' s inspiration . Toney rehearses his part daily in West Hollywood at Mickey Rourke ' s Outlaw Gym . One recent day , the fighter stopped training cold and cleared the room with thunderous authority . &quot; Get the . . . out ! ! &quot; he yelled from the ring . &quot; I just don ' t give a . . . You all understand English ? I just don ' t give a . . . . &quot; Toney minions , well conditioned to his outbursts , executed the order . This , apparently , is standard_operating_procedure before a fight . Anything can set Toney off and sometimes it is as simple as Toney ' s seeing a person in the gym he does not like . &quot; You have to let him simmer_down , &quot; Kallen says . &quot; If you put your hand in boiling water , you ' re going to get burned . There ' s nothing anyone can say to control him . You can ' t . You learn . It ' s like a red alert , like a tornado warning . You hear it and get_out of the way. &quot; It is all part of the process . But it ' s never comfortable . &quot; It ' s the only place where it ' s appropriate , &quot; Kallen says of Toney ' s behavior . &quot; If he was an assassin , I could see him going_out and going , boom-boom , walking away and going_to eat a hot dog . Literally . I ' m used to it . I ' m willing to work with it . I don ' t say I condone it . It ' s not about accepting it , it ' s about the fact that this is what he is. &quot; Kallen knows the wild mood swings are not normal . Toney , at one moment , can be unabashedly sweet , playful as a kitten , lavishing Kallen with diamond rings , pink teddy_bears , $ 100 sweaters . The next , she ' s running_for the storm shelter . Believe it or not , this is a kinder , gentler Toney , a Peace Corps volunteer compared to the person Kallen met when she and the boxer first crossed paths . That was 1989 , Detroit . Kallen , a former entertainment columnist before she became Tommy Hearns ' publicist in 1978 , walked in on a sparring session at about the time Toney was trying to break Tom Dempsey ' s field_goal record with a spit bucket . &quot; I said , ' Who is that ? And what ' s wrong with him ? ' &quot; Kallen recalls . &quot; Someone said ' that ' s James Toney . He ' s crazy. ' I thought , ' Hmm , that ' s interesting. ' &quot; Toney , from Ann Arbor , Mich. , was a street thug who , at 16 , had already shot a man and exchanged dope for dollars . Toney ' s first manager , known as Johnny Ace , had a crack cocaine distribution business going_on the side until he was gunned_down in a drive-by_shooting . &quot; I had just talked to him , right ? &quot; Toney says . &quot; A half-hour later , he got blown away. &quot; Everyone kept leaving Toney . He never knew his father , also James and also a fighter . Only recently did Toney learn that when he was 3 months old , his father shot his mother , Sherri , while she was holding James . Sherri survived and lived to become one of her son ' s inspirations . Toney ' s father later went_to prison on a rape charge . He is expected to be released soon . Toney has not tied a yellow ribbon around the old oak_tree . In fact , his family won ' t tell him when James Sr . is getting_out . &quot; . . . my dad , &quot; Toney said . &quot; I ' m glad he ' s not around me now because my butt would be where he is , in prison . Because I ' d have to kill him. &quot; Toney formed his life philosophy early . &quot; I don ' t like people because you don ' t know who to trust , &quot; he says . &quot; People you can trust go_ahead and stab you in the back at the last minute. &quot; Kallen has always had a soft_spot for problem cases . She is married and has two grown children , but always imagined herself running a home for waywards . She has been a steadying influence . Kallen ' s devotion apparently knows no bounds . &quot; If it ' s in the cards to be shot by one of my fighters , maybe that ' s a fitting way to go , &quot; she says . &quot; Trying to save someone ' s life. &quot; Most saw the savage in Toney but she saw the salvageable . &quot; To see somebody pick_up a chair and slam it through a window , or put his fist through a glass door , or pick_up a scale and throw it across the room , I had not seen that kind of rage , &quot; Kallen says . &quot; It wasn ' t in my background. &quot; She also saw a menacing , tenacious fighter who liked what he did for a living and was willing to take_on all comers . Kallen hounded matchmakers for bouts until Toney emerged from obscurity in May 1991 , when he scored a technical_knockout over Michael Nunn , then the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion , in the 11th round . At the weigh-in , Nunn had playfully patted his opponent on the head . Toney blew all circuits and the fighters had to be separated . That prefight scene has been played_out many times since . After the George Foreman-Michael Moorer fight this month , Toney told Jones during a television interview : &quot; I ' ll knock your punk ass out. &quot; They keep lining_up the best fighters in the business , and Toney keeps mowing them down -- Nunn , Iran Barkley , Tim Littles , Prince Charles Williams . Running_out of challengers , Toney says the Jones fight will be his last at 168 pounds . Toney , who struggles to make his fighting weight , plans to eat his way into the heavyweight division within two years . He wants a piece of the action in a division where some boxers -- Michael Moorer to name one -- claim not even to enjoy fighting . &quot; Roy ( Jones ) , he don ' t like to fight either , &quot; Toney says of Friday ' s opponent . &quot; I like to fight . If you don ' t like to fight , you shouldn ' t be in the game . But it always shows , like Michael Moorer -- Bam ! -- knocked_out . Now he can retire and be a cop like he always said he wanted to be . I ' ll knock_out Roy Jones and he can retire and become a basketball_player , like he always wanted to be . &quot; I like boxing . When I lose the desire , I ' m going_to call it quits . I go_to every fight card when I ' m home . I watch it on TV every Tuesday -- ESPN has its shows . I watch it on my satellite. &quot; Toney is a paradox , a man given to spontaneous bursts of violence , yet a boxer steadfastly disciplined when it comes_to his career . To strengthen his resolve , he purposely trains in the heart of Hollywood , a $ 5 cab ride to any temptation . So_much for theories that boxers must retreat to log-cabin isolation to train for big fights . From his hotel_room , Toney can hear the back beats from the House of Blues . &quot; If people have to train outside , in the woods , they ' re not disciplined , &quot; he maintains . &quot; I ' m a disciplined person . I ' m around House of Blues , but believe it or not , I haven ' t been outside my hotel . Only time I ' m outside my hotel is to go_to Gold ' s Gym . that ' s a center of attraction right there . They ' ve got movie_stars , porn stars that work_out there . that ' s temptation right there. &quot; There is strength in resistance . &quot; Out in the woods , I ' d probably go crazy , fight everybody in camp. &quot; As if he doesn ' t do enough of that anyway . They say Toney has simmered . The birth of his daughter , now 23 months , was an important step . Toney also plans to marry in the spring . &quot; I ' ve changed a lot , because I ' ve wanted to change , &quot; Toney says . &quot; I don ' t fight as much outside the ring as I used to . I have a daughter -- that ' s a lot of responsibilities right there. &quot; Says Miller , his trainer : &quot; He ' s 100 % better than he used to be , but he ' s got_to get 100 % better. &quot; Axiomatically , Miller says Toney ' s ring success is related to his temper . &quot; Once that fire goes_out , that ' s it for James Toney as a fighter , &quot; Miller says . &quot; that ' s his makeup. &quot; Miller puts_up with Toney ' s rages because he recognizes the fighter as one of the best . &quot; He takes a better punch than Tommy Hearns , &quot; Miller says . &quot; Tommy was just as vicious in the ring . He didn ' t have as_many outbursts as this kid , but when that bell rang he was a different guy . But Tommy would have had big problems with this guy. &quot; Kallen has a game_plan to ease Toney back into society once his career is over . She hopes to work Toney into her husband ' s construction business . She thinks he will have spent most of his anger by then . &quot; His rage , it sort of mellows with age , &quot; Kallen says . &quot; You can only be so mad for so many years . He ' s getting a lot of it out through boxing , so hopefully by the time he retires , he ' ll be physically sated , kind of like an overeater . He ' s tasted everything , what more can he taste ? &quot; Until then , Toney rumbles on , plowing through his rages and sparring partners , while others debate who ' s going_to play him in the movie . &quot; I want the media to say James Toney was a great fighter before everybody who ' s an honest person , &quot; he says . &quot; That he never ducked nobody . that ' s all I want you to say . I ' m delighted the media says I ' m like LaMotta , Ray Robinson , that I ' m a throwback . &quot; I ' m not saying I ' m better than them or anything like that . I ' m just happy to be named in that class . Those guys , they were great fighters . I just wish I could have seen them fight live. &quot;</TEXT>
