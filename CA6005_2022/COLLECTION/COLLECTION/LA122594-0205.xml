   <HEADLINE> WILL CHECHNYA BECOME YELTSIN ' S AFGHANISTAN ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s decision to invade Chechnya , the breakaway North Caucasian republic , inevitably invites comparisons to previous Russian adventures along the fring es of its empire . Like the ill-starred interventions of the past , the incursion is more politics than security threat . But if Yeltsin has truly disregarded the military disadvantages in Chechnya in search of political gains to be won from a short and &quot; glorious &quot; war in the Caucasus , he may have made a tragically naive decision that ignores history and promises grim consequences . One obvious Chechen parallel is the war in Afghanistan . Deputy Defense Minister Boris V . Gromov and Gen . Alexander I . Lebed , two prominent veterans of the Afghan War , have stressed those similarities in their public opposition to the invasion of Chechnya . The Soviet army stayed nine years in Afghanistan seeking to fulfill the political goal of supporting communist regimes abroad . For that vague goal , the Soviets paid dearly in lives and resources , brutalized and fractionalized the Afghan people , and eventually left the country less stable than they found it . But the comparison between Afghanistan and Chechnya may be strained because Moscow considers the Chechen conflict an internal affair , a claim that has withstood international scrutiny . Closer to point is Mikhail S . Gorbachev ' s use of force against nationalistic crowds in Tbilisi , Baku and Vilnius during the twilight of the Soviet_Union . Although Chechnya has been characterized by Yeltsin as a nest of bandits , its chief crime -- like that of the Georgians , Azerbaijanis and Lithuanians -- is refusing to remain peacefully under Moscow ' s control . It is the specter of a wider Caucasian war that is most chilling to Russians , since such conflict has great historical resonance . Yeltsin himself hinted at the risks last August : &quot; If we were to apply pressure by force against Chechnya , it would arouse the whole Caucasus ; there would be such a commotion , there would be so_much blood that nobody would ever forgive us. &quot; Russian rulers have long sought dominion over the resource-rich , strategically located region , and have always encountered stiff resistance from its inhabitants . In the 19th Century , for example , Russia used 300 # 000 soldiers and took nearly 30 years to crush Shamil , the great Muslim leader of Daghestan and Chechnya . Today , some Chechens believe that if Shamil had been born Chechen , the czarist armies would never have subdued the Caucasus . The Russian writers Tolstoy and Pushkin portrayed the Chechens as hospitable and chivalrous , but also stressed their ferocity in war and vindictive character . Chechnya ' s predominantly Muslim , clan-based society , regulated by a ruthless system of blood_feud , has never adapted well to colonization . Regular revolts continued even under Soviet rule . In 1944 , Josef Stalin deported the entire Chechen population to Central Asia on trumped-up charges of Nazi collaboration . Rehabilitated in 1956 , this experience of exile remains fresh in Chechen memory , fueling their continued resistance to Russian hegemony . Common hatred of Moscow is a potentially strong unifying force in the typically fragmented region . Indeed , the loosely defined Confederation of Caucasian Peoples has warned Moscow that war against Chechnya means war against the entire Caucasus , and rumors of recruiting efforts throughout the North Caucasus abound . Unfavorable military conditions in Chechnya also reduce the chances of a &quot; clean &quot; military victory for the Russians . Cold , short and foggy days are not an ideal environment for an invasion . Furthermore , the military_forces are composed of an untested combination of interior ministry and regular_army troops . Worse , the refusal of Maj . Gen . Ivan Babichev to turn his column ' s guns on protesting Chechen civilians suggests insubordination and confusion at high levels . Taken together , the ruthless occupation of Chechnya may usher_in a prolonged period of guerrilla warfare in the Caucasus , not to mention terrorist retribution in Russian cities and massive refugee flows . The Chechen capital of Grozny -- the Russian word for &quot; terrible , fearful &quot; -- takes its name from a fort Russian occupiers established there . Faced with a tenacious resistance , the Russians discovered they could only maintain dominion over the North Caucasus through the use of terrible , fearful force . The current crisis in Chechnya , eerily reminiscent_of the Afghanistan and the Caucasian wars , suggests that the authorities in Moscow have failed to learn the lessons of that past . Yeltsin ' s reckless adventure on the restless fringe can only shake faith in the Russian Federation , not hold it together .</TEXT>
