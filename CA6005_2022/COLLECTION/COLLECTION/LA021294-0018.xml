   <HEADLINE> ' ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ' FOR U.S. MINORITIES IS ORDERED ; POLLUTION : CLINTON TELLS ALL AGENCIES TO EASE THE BURDEN ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES . IMPACT OF HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS IN AREAS TO BE DOCUMENTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton on Friday ordered all federal agencies to take steps to lighten what officials called a disproportionate burden on minority communities of pollutants and other environmental hazards . Clinton signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to &quot; make environmental justice a part of all they do. &quot; Under the order , fair treatment of minority communities would become a factor_in decisions ranging from the regulation of pesticides to the prosecution of polluters . The initiative also sets_in_motion an unprecedented data-gathering effort across the federal_government to document the impact of pollution on minorities . &quot; Every community must be included in making decisions about their health and environment , &quot; said Vice_President Al Gore , who has pressed for the initiative . Under the President ' s directive , he added , &quot; we will ensure that disadvantaged populations have an opportunity to participate fully in making health and environmental decisions. &quot; The initiative , which stems from an earlier promise by the President , has been hailed by groups struggling to counter what they view_as a pattern of environmental racism that has befouled minority communities and left them vulnerable to the arrival of new sources of industrial pollution . But a group of environmental activists meeting in Washington on Friday called_on the Administration to do more to rid their communities of pollution . Specifically , they called_for a ban on chemicals such_as lead and benzene . All have been linked to a variety of illnesses ranging from cancer to nervous_disorders to birth_defects . The Clinton_Administration is the first to address the issue at such a high level after years of appeals from minority organizations . Benjamin F . Chavis Jr. , director of the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People , has made environmental justice a priority for his organization . A 1987 study by Chavis , titled &quot; Toxic Wastes and Race , &quot; established for the first time that communities with large minority populations -- even relatively prosperous ones -- were far more likely to have hazardous waste facilities and other pollution-producing industries in their midst than were other communities . A more recent study published by the National Law Journal in 1992 concluded that polluters based in minority areas were treated less severely than those in largely white communities . It also found that toxic cleanup programs under the federal Superfund law took longer and were less complete in minority communities . Under the initiative , the EPA is expected to gather new data and issue new regulations designed to stem the concentration of heavy industry in areas largely populated by minorities . Last week , the Administration proposed a series of reforms to the Superfund program that would give minority communities a greater voice in cleaning-up Superfund sites in their neighborhoods . EPA Administrator Carol Browner added that the EPA also will reconsider many of the standards by which exposure to potentially harmful chemicals would be considered safe . Current standards for EPA ' s fish advisories , for instance , assume the consumption habits of a middle-class white male . Browner said that new standards would be explored to consider the exposure of minority groups that rely_on fishing to subsist and as a result eat large amounts of fish , which can accumulate harmful toxins . Also on Friday , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno said that the Justice_Department will supplement the EPA ' s regulatory efforts to ensure that minority communities receive equal protection from polluters . &quot; What we want to do is to make_sure we look_at the people most at risk and to make_sure that our environmental laws and our civil_rights laws are used as vigorously as possible to correct injustice , &quot; said Reno . In October , the Administration quietly handed minority communities a potentially powerful new tool to fight the introduction of hazardous materials sites in their neighborhoods . The Administration agreed to investigate two separate civil_rights complaints from minority communities in Louisiana and Mississippi , which charged that the proposed siting of new plants in their midst was racially biased . The decision marks the first time that the federal_government has encouraged the use of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in community environmental battles , although the nation ' s courts traditionally have been wary of such efforts . Clinton_Administration officials said that the move is a measure of their commitment to rectify environmental injustices .</TEXT>
