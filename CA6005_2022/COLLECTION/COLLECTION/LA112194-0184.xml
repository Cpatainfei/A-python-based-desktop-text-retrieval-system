   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS ' 94 : IMPACT ON BUSINESS ; KEY HOUSE PANEL TO BE OVERHAULED BY REPUBLICANS ; CONGRESS : A SCALED-BACK ENERGY , COMMERCE COMMITTEE MAY SUIT BUSINESS BETTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When incoming Republican leaders met last week to fulfill an election pledge to slash House committees , the panel targeted for one of the biggest hits was one that has long been a thorn in the side of the GOP and its business allies : the Energy and Commerce Committee . Over the past 14 years , the committee has grown_into a sprawling powerhouse under the chairmanship of Rep . John D . Dingell ( D-Mich ) , a blustering former prosecutor who earned the nickname &quot; The Truck &quot; for being one of Congress ' toughest investigators . His 130-member committee staff has made a career of going_after high and mighty business figures such_as deposed junk_bond king Michael R . Milken , assorted defense_contractors and even Los Angeles-based First Executive Corp. , whose president , Fred Carr , was questioned about the soundness of the insurance_company ' s investments . That era will end in January when Dingell ' s likely replacement -- Rep . Thomas J . Bliley Jr . ( R-Va. ) , a self-described &quot; genteel conservative &quot; -- takes_over as chairman . Although Bliley has declined to comment publicly on his agenda , pending his appointment , most observers expect the committee to be less regulatory and far friendlier to business . &quot; If ever there was a committee on Capitol_Hill that made companies quake in their boots , it was the Energy and Commerce Committee , &quot; said Charles Lewis , executive_director of the Center for Public Integrity , a Washington-based research group on government ethics . &quot; That committee , as much as any other committee on Capitol_Hill , went_after industry . I would think there are a lot of people who have come_to detest John Dingell and his committee , and are celebrating right now. &quot; For corporate America as well as American consumers , the pending change in leadership at the committee may be one of the most pivotal post-election events of the 1994 campaign . Billions of dollars ride_on the decisions of the committee , which oversees environmental regulation , securities markets , health_care , telecommunications , railroads , consumer protection , tourism and even some trade issues . So extensive is the panel ' s reach that one committee aide joked that its jurisdiction is rumored to extend_to &quot; everything that moves , bleeds or burns. &quot; It remains to be seen , however , whether corporate America will find deliverance in Bliley , a former Democrat who operated a funeral_home before he successfully ran_for mayor of Richmond , Va . Some issues taken_up by the committee -- telecommunications , for example -- have historically been so nonpartisan that House bills to promote cable re-regulation and telecommunications competition have passed_by overwhelming margins . What ' s more , if his fellow Republicans have their way , the committee Bliley takes_over may only be a shadow of its former self . that ' s because Republicans are considering a proposal to rename the committee the Health and Commerce Committee and slash its staff by half , to about 60 . Sources familiar_with the Republican discussions say a task_force is considering a proposal that would strip the committee of its current oversight of environmental issues , railroads , energy and some securities issues . The panel would continue to oversee telecommunications , health_care , insurance and some business investment issues . &quot; We recognize the fact that we should give_up some of this jurisdiction and spread it around , &quot; said Rep . Dan Schaefer ( R-Colo. ) , a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee . The committee , he added , has a huge jurisdiction : &quot; Some 40 % of all ( congressional ) legislation comes_before the committee. &quot; Schaefer said the committee ' s size has created a regulatory excess epitomized by lawmakers like Henry A . Waxman ( D-Calif. ) , who chairs Energy and Commerce ' s subcommittee on health and environment and has been a big proponent of tougher anti-smoking laws . &quot; Henry Waxman , year after year , was pushing new regulation and thereby driving_up costs in the health_care arena , &quot; Schaefer said . &quot; We ' re trying to avoid that. &quot; Despite talk_of reining_in the committee -- talk which must survive lengthy turf battles -- Bliley will , nevertheless , be a figure to be reckoned with . Already , as a result of his imminent appointment , the Virginian has achieved new prominence . &quot; In the past , the only calls we would get were from papers like the Richmond Times ( Dispatch ) or the Green County Record in Standardsville , Va . But the day after the elections , I came_back to my office and had 47 calls from everybody , from the ' Today Show ' to CBS News , &quot; said Bliley ' s press secretary , Charles Boesel . When asked about Bliley ' s last major TV appearance , Boesel mused , &quot; Hmmmm , I don ' t know . It may have been 1987 on CNN. &quot; Colleagues , staff_members and lobbyists say Bliley is highly respected and has gotten_along well even with his Democratic adversaries , especially Dingell . &quot; Bliley is not an ideologue , &quot; said David Vienna , a Washington lobbyist for the Pacific Stock_Exchange and other securities industry groups . &quot; He ' s tended to work in a bipartisan way on the committee . He ' s a consensus builder . . . . I don ' t expect that to change. &quot; Even so , the Republican landslide this month has imbued the GOP with a new swagger that ' s not likely to fade when Republicans make_up the majority of both houses of Congress next year . In a recent speech before the Media Institute in Washington , Roy Neel , a former Clinton_Administration official who now heads the United States Telephone Assn. , predicted the new Congress will be &quot; crankier and more ornery and partisan &quot; than in the past . &quot; I don ' t for a moment believe that a general spirit of cooperation will emerge from divided government next year. &quot; Bliley is not talking for the record yet , but his political background gives some indications as_to where his legislative interests may lie . He co-sponsored the bill that led to the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1994 that passed the House but not the Senate . Bliley was also a key force behind a health_care measure Republicans offered as an alternative to the Clinton_Administration ' s sweeping plan , and effectively blocked Dingell from reporting Clinton ' s plan out of committee . More tellingly , Bliley ' s Richmond-area congressional_district is home to a major AT &amp; T plant , as well as giant cigarette maker Philip Morris Co . As a result , he is expected to pay close attention to the tobacco_industry and telecommunications . Between 1987 and 1992 , Bliley led the House in campaign donations from tobacco-linked interests and individuals , according to the Sunshine Press of Washington , a news service that focuses_on campaign finance . But in the 18 months ended in June , tobacco political_action_committees gave nearly comparable amounts to Bliley ( $ 18 # 700 ) and Dingell ( $ 14 # 000 ) , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . Already , Rep . Jack Fields ( R-Tex. ) , the likely head of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee that oversees telecommunications and finance , has huddled with Bliley and other Republicans to discuss putting telecommunications reform legislation back on the fast track . Bliley is also expected to have an impact on other lesser-known issues that have galvanized the Energy and Commerce ' s subcommittees in the past . Bliley and Fields are likely to back_away from efforts initiated by telecommunications and finance subcommittee Chairman Edward J . Markey ( D-Mass. ) to impose new regulations to control allegedly violent television_programs . Bliley is also expected to end Dingell ' s fledgling probe of the insurance industry . &quot; I would think that Mr. Bliley will clearly focus_on deregulation and reshaping what he would regard_as the Great Society programs , &quot; Rep . Ron Wyden ( D-Ore. ) said . &quot; The challenges for him ( are ) to make_sure that he can keep the scalpel on trimming true inefficiencies in government and not let his scalpel whack deeply into true human needs. &quot; Jim Wholey , a Washington lawyer and cable industry lobbyist who served as an aide to Sen . Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , said many industry executives who once complained about excessive federal regulation may_not be hankering to roll back the clock , even with their Republican friends in_charge . &quot; There ' s a real sense that the Federal Communications Commission has overreached with its new cable rules . . . and some parts of the Cable Act passed_by Congress ( two years ago ) are really bad , &quot; Wholey said . &quot; But industry has already learned to live with much of the Cable Act , and it ' s almost as much trouble to undo it now as it is to get_along_with it. &quot; Similarly , Bliley ' s protection of the tobacco_industry may prevent passage of any new regulatory initiatives . But , observers say , it ' s unlikely he will be able to roll back existing anti-smoking laws . &quot; It ' s a great ( subcommittee ) loss to lose Henry Waxman , who ' s been fighting the tobacco_industry all_of these years , &quot; said Elaine Lamy , executive_director of Infact , a Boston-based anti-smoking group that strongly supported the California Democrat ' s efforts to impose further restrictions on the tobacco_industry . &quot; But polls have shown that the public firmly backs these advertising restrictions and ( cigarette ) excise_taxes . There ' s no way those will be repealed. &quot; And some skeptics , noting that Republicans , like Democrats , are interested in power and self-preservation , doubt that the GOP will follow_through on its promise to significantly rein_in Energy and Commerce .</TEXT>
