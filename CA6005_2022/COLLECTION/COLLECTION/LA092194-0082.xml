   <HEADLINE> RICE ' S ABOUT-FACE : CRUISE IS LESTAT ; AFTER SCREENING ' INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE , ' AUTHOR LAUDS HIS WORK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Anne Rice fans , listen up . The author who once slammed the makers of &quot; Interview With the Vampire &quot; for casting Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in the movie version of her best-seller has reversed her opinion after seeing a pre-release screening . In fact , she &quot; loved &quot; the picture , which opens in early November , and has decided to publicly endorse it . Rice ' s assistant , Suzie Quiroz , who ' s been an officer of the author ' s 3 # 500-member fan club since 1985 , said her boss even &quot; loved ( the actors ' ) performances &quot; after seeing the film last Friday . These are the same actors Rice once slung arrows at , comparing their casting to putting &quot; Huck Finn and Tom_Sawyer &quot; in the roles of French-speaking 19th-Century vampires . The writer , who lives_in her native New Orleans , once publicly zinged the young actors , particularly Cruise , telling The Times that the star ' s &quot; mom and apple_pie &quot; persona didn ' t mesh with the European , impish , proud , semi-androgynous Lestat she created on the page . Rice said she was &quot; stunned by the casting of Cruise , who is no more my vampire Lestat than Edward G . Robinson is Rhett Butler , &quot; noting she envisioned someone more like Daniel Day-Lewis , Jeremy Irons or Peter Weller in the role . One of &quot; Vampire ' s &quot; producers , David Geffen , said that after the screening , Rice told him she thought the film &quot; went way beyond her expectations &quot; and that Cruise in particular was &quot; wonderful. &quot; He noted , &quot; She even phoned ( Tom ) up and told him she was wrong . It ' s a great thing when someone who had been critical of a movie saw it , loved it and admitted she was wrong . . . a very classy thing to do. &quot; Cruise confirmed that he did speak_to Rice last Friday and said simply : &quot; We had a fantastic conversation. &quot; The film ' s director , Neil Jordan ( &quot; The Crying Game &quot; ) , reached in Dublin late Monday , said he hadn ' t spoken_to Rice , who had also written three versions of the screenplay . But he said he was &quot; very glad she ' s finally happy . This has always been her book and that ' s important . I loved her book and I really wanted to be true_to it , &quot; Jordan said . So true that those involved with the $ 50-million Geffen Pictures ' production for Warner Bros . say Jordan even added more scenes from the book than Rice herself included in her versions of the screenplay . Nobody associated with the picture , including Jordan , would address those scenes . Warners executives were naturally pleased to get Rice ' s stamp of approval . Studio spokesman Robert Friedman downplayed the jeering of some audience reaction to the film ' s trailer , attributing the negative reaction to Rice loyalists . &quot; Now with her support that should stop , &quot; he said . When the film was first screened for test audiences , Geffen said many felt there was &quot; a little too_much blood and violence. &quot; A Warner ' s source said Geffen insisted that all_of the footage initially be shown , despite what the producer said were some objections by Jordan to excise some scenes . But Geffen wanted to get a feel_for what the audience wanted . Eventually , Warners said about 20 minutes of footage was moved_around or cut and the final version that will hit theaters Nov . 11 is 1 hour and 58 minutes long . The film , originally scheduled to be released Nov . 18 , was moved_up so that Warners could have a longer stretch to push the film during the Thanksgiving holiday period , one of the biggest box-office periods of the year . But the new release date could hinder another big horror film coming_out the week before on Nov . 4 : Kenneth Branagh ' s version of &quot; Mary Shelley ' s Frankenstein , &quot; with Robert DeNiro and Helena Bonham Carter . Exhibitor sources said they are a bit worried about the TriStar Pictures ' release since it will only have a week to gather steam before &quot; Vampire &quot; competes for audience dollars . A TriStar spokesman said the studio had no plans to push the release date up_to Halloween weekend , beginning Oct . 29 , as speculated . Studios are increasingly releasing movies weeks in_advance of the popular moviegoing Thanksgiving holiday to take_advantage of longer playing time . &quot; This year is no different , &quot; said one exhibitor . &quot; They want to get as much box-office blood out of this holiday period as they can. &quot; Perhaps that too , he quipped , will please Anne Rice .</TEXT>
