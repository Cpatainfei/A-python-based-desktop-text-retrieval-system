   <HEADLINE> TOPICS / SCIENCE ; AMATEUR STARGAZERS SCOPE OUT COSMIC CRASH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The collision of Jupiter with Fragment B of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 didn ' t look_like much through the high-powered telescopes set_up Saturday night by the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory Astronomy Club in Pasadena . But it was a thrill nonetheless to the several hundred visitors who waited patiently for a chance to view the cosmic crash , one of a series of such events that continued through the week . On Saturday , amateur star-watchers and New Age adherents alike became spectators to a galactic demolition derby . Although the visual impact was far from &quot; Star Wars &quot; special_effects , imagination picked_up where the telescopes left_off . &quot; It ' s fantastic ! Imagine what ' s happening , &quot; gushed Laura Ochoa of Los Angeles , waiting in_line . &quot; A comet hitting a planet . . . . It ' s history ! &quot; Shajiyah Akbar , a Pasadena resident , wondered whether the collision would have astrological consequences . &quot; I want to see if it has any effect on people that are ruled by Jupiter , ( which ) rules Sagittarius and Pisces , &quot; she said . &quot; I thought this was a very exciting event of the century. &quot; Aside from sheer entertainment value , the collision offered a chance for astronomers , who normally study phenomena that unfold over billions of years , to observe cosmic activity before their very eyes . JPL employees belonging_to the laboratory ' s Astronomy Club arrived before dusk to set_up their own telescopes including some with eight- or 10-inch lenses -- while speculating on what they might reveal . Astronomical theories predicted a plenitude of possible effects from the comet ' s collision , said JPL engineer and Astronomy Club_member Dave Nakamoto . Among them : The comet fragments would create fireballs that would light_up a nearby moon . They would puncture holes in the planet ' s atmosphere , revealing a deeper layer of dark gases . They would release plumes of gas , similar to how a pebble dropped_in a pond sends up a splash of water . The last proved the most accurate prediction . On Saturday , the comet fragment hit the planet shortly before 8 p.m. , but it struck on the far side of the planet , so the effects weren ' t visible for a_couple_of hours . What viewers saw , at around 10 p.m. after most of the crowd had left , was a dark , diffused region , about the size of Jupiter ' s great red spot . It was hard to focus_on , Nakamoto said , but unmistakably there . &quot; It took me about 30 seconds to convince myself I was really seeing it , &quot; he said . &quot; Jupiter was getting lower in the horizon , and the atmosphere was getting turbulent . It was like looking_at a quarter at the bottom of a swimming pool. &quot; The impact zone was the size of several Earth diameters , Nakamoto said , raising chilling implications about the possibility of a similar collision on Earth . &quot; Impacts of comets and asteroids are a hot topic these days , probably because a lot of people since the early ' 80s have speculated that they caused mass extinctions on Earth , &quot; said Bob Cesarone , a JPL engineer and Astronomy Club_member . Ismael Hernandez of Los Angeles cautioned about that danger as he distributed literature on his proposal for space colonies built of lunar dust . &quot; If we keep neglecting the space_program and an asteroid hits the Earth , forget it , &quot; he warned . &quot; It ' ll be too late. &quot;</TEXT>
