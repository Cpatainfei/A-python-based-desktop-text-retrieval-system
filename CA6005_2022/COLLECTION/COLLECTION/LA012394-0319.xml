   <HEADLINE> PRIME_TIME ' S NEW MAN ABOUT ' TOON ; POMPOUS , LOUD , A ZERO WITH WOMEN -- OK , SO JON LOVITZ ' S ' THE CRITIC ' ISN ' T THE COOLEST GUY AROUND . STILL , THIS NEW CREATION OF THE ' SIMPSONS ' TEAM AIMS TO BECOME THE FIRST ANIMATED SHOW TO REPEAT THE SUCCESS OF BART AND CO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Behind a glass partition in a small , wood-paneled recording_studio on the Sony Pictures Entertainment lot , Jon Lovitz reads and rereads some lines of dialogue into a big black microphone . Flanking him on the other side of the glass , giving him patient directions and guidance , are Al Jean and Mike Reiss , the two unassuming guys who wrote his lines . Jean and Reiss , self-described nerds in high_school , rose from staff writers to executive producers of &quot; The Simpsons , &quot; which they left after last season to create ABC ' s new series &quot; The Critic. &quot; The broad animated parody , premiering at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday , revolves_around Lovitz as a pudgy , balding and unlovable film critic whose gunky hair comes_out of a spray_can . The show is yet another attempt by the networks to find a prime-time cartoon hit like &quot; The Simpsons &quot; -- but this time with people who actually worked_on Fox ' s breakthrough series : Jean , Reiss and co-executive producer James L . Brooks . &quot; A date for the theater . Let ' s check my little black_book , &quot; Lovitz says spryly into the mike , sounding very much like the snobby character he developed for the &quot; Get_to Know Me &quot; sketch he used to do on &quot; Saturday Night Live. &quot; &quot; Hmmm . AAA Escort Service . Sister Dominica . Glenn / Glenda. &quot; He ' s not happy with any of the names he reads . &quot; Ahhh , hello , Helen ! &quot; Unfortunately , according to the script , Helen is still trying to scrub her body clean after her last date with Lovitz ' s character , Jay Sherman . So Sherman tries to find a date by holding an impromptu trivia contest on his movie-review TV_show . &quot; So , ladies , just call_in if you know the name of Spielberg ' s adorable extraterrestrial , &quot; Lovitz says , still reading from the script . &quot; I ' ll take the 29th caller. &quot; There ' s a pause . Lovitz appeals pathetically : &quot; Cute little alien . Anyone ? I ' ll give you a hint : E . . . Oh ! We have a caller . The alien ' s name was ? &quot; &quot; Richard Dreyfuss , &quot; drawls an actress with a hoarse , throaty voice , standing beside Lovitz . Lovitz sighs deeply . &quot; Uh , do you have a sister ? &quot; he asks . Reiss cuts_in and says , &quot; OK , that was good . Now , let ' s try it again. &quot; &quot; Well , if it was so good , why are we doing_it again ? Let ' s cut_through the crap , &quot; Lovitz says , affecting the pompous attitude of a big_shot , turning his nose up and puffing an imaginary cigar . &quot; And when are you going_to rename this building after me , the way you promised ? &quot; Jean and Reiss look_at each other and bust out laughing . In &quot; The Critic , &quot; a half-hour comedy set_in New York , Sherman reviews movies on_his_own cheesy cable-TV show , rating them from cold to hot on his &quot; Shermometer. &quot; His big catch phrase is &quot; It stinks. &quot; His only real fans are drunken frat boys who like to make_fun of him . The movies Sherman critiques are all parodies , such_as &quot; Rabbi P.I. , &quot; in which an Arnold Schwarzenegger knockoff plays a Chicago cop who goes undercover as a Hasidic Jew . In the film_clip Sherman reviews , an animated Schwarzenegger holds a scalpel and stands nervously over a baby . A mob boss commands him : &quot; All right , if you are a real rabbi , circumcise this child. &quot; Suddenly , the Schwarzenegger character hurls the scalpel , hitting the mob boss in the heart , and says , &quot; Hava nagila , baby. &quot; When he ' s not reviewing movies , the divorced Sherman is giving bad advice to his son , Marty ; seeking advice from his hunky Australian actor friend , Jeremy ; or trying to trade on his questionable celebrity for dates with women or a good seat in his favorite restaurant , L ' Ane Riche ( translation : the Wealthy Jackass ) . Jean and Reiss , college roommates who started working together on the Harvard Lampoon in the late 1970s , know all too well the odds against success for a prime-time cartoon series . In one scene from the 1992 &quot; Simpsons &quot; Halloween special they produced , the camera panned across tombstones in a pet cemetery engraved with the names of the shows that tried to follow in &quot; The Simpsons ' &quot; footsteps : Steven Bochco ' s &quot; Capitol Critters &quot; on ABC , &quot; Fish Police &quot; from Hanna-Barbera Studios and &quot; Family Dog &quot; from Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton on CBS . Now it ' s time for Jean and Reiss , who have a development deal with Brooks , to put_up themselves . Their credits included &quot; The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson , &quot; &quot; Sledge Hammer ! &quot; and &quot; Alf &quot; before landing at &quot; The Simpsons &quot; in 1989 . They became executive producers , supervising the writing and all creative aspects . &quot; It is tough , &quot; Reiss said . &quot; The other animated shows that came_after us weren ' t very good , and they really got slammed , but it ' s a very hard process. &quot; Indeed , &quot; The Simpsons &quot; is the only prime-time cartoon series to find lasting success on one of the networks since &quot; The Flintstones &quot; three decades earlier . In general , the networks have shied_away_from prime-time animation because it ' s extremely expensive and time consuming : A half-hour sitcom may air two weeks after shooting , while a half-hour episode of animation takes roughly nine months to produce . &quot; The guardians of the market at the networks have an agenda that they have to deal with , and animation is difficult for them to fit into their agenda , &quot; observed Fred Seibert , president of Hanna-Barbera Studios . &quot; The really tough challenge the networks have is dealing with the lead time of animation . They ' re used to much quicker turnaround in their schedules and much smaller episode commitments than are affordable in animation. &quot; &quot; We immediately jumped right into ' The Critic ' with no reservations whatsoever , &quot; deadpanned Stuart Bloomberg , vice_president of programming for ABC , who ordered 13 episodes of &quot; The Critic. &quot; Oh , really ? &quot; Of course not , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s animation . It ' s really scary . All of the problems that animation brings loom heavy . It ' s that whole timing situation , in which you have to commit to a series really without seeing much of anything first . You sort of close your eyes and hope . You know , there were smart people behind ' Capitol Critters , ' and it didn ' t work for any number of reasons -- pick them. &quot; For Jean and Reiss , there ' s no real mystery why the other prime-time animated efforts didn ' t work_out . &quot; The difference between ' The Simpsons ' and , say , ' Fish Police , ' is that we just poured a tremendous amount_of_time and money into the writing , &quot; Jean said . &quot; We had a staff of Emmy winners , people who had done some of the best work_on TV , working nonstop and really honing these scripts , making_sure that they were human and believable . &quot; To pick on one of the other shows : When I read the script for ' Fish Police , ' I said , ' This is all puns about fish . I don ' t know why they think that this is the same as &quot; The Simpsons. &quot; ' I mean , ' The Simpsons ' is clearly written to appeal_to all ages , with adults in mind , and the other one seemed like it was written just for kids 8 and under. &quot; Unlike &quot; The Simpsons , &quot; which was spun_off from animated shorts that Matt Groening did on Fox ' s &quot; The Tracey Ullman Show , &quot; &quot; The Critic &quot; was sold to ABC strictly on the strength of the pilot script . &quot; Hava nagila , baby , &quot; Bloomberg said , laughing . &quot; I look_at it as a gamble , sure . But it ' s hard to deny these scripts , &quot; added Bloomberg , who already has ordered an additional 13 scripts to be written and ready to go_into production for next season in case &quot; The Critic &quot; does catch_on with viewers . &quot; I mean , they are just consistently funny . We ' ve said no to a lot -- a lot -- of animation . Certainly after ' Capitol Critters , ' it ' s got_to take something pretty special . This was very difficult to say no to. &quot; To keep the writing sharp on &quot; The Critic , &quot; Jean and Reiss carefully selected a stable of writers with experience in sophisticated comedy -- not screwball animation . Their writers include &quot; Seinfeld &quot; producers Tom Gammill and Max Pross , Nell Scovell from &quot; Murphy Brown , &quot; former &quot; In Living Color &quot; writer Steve Tompkins , former &quot; Simpsons &quot; writer Jon Vitti , former David Letterman writer Ken Keeler and Patric Verrone , who worked with Johnny Carson on &quot; The Tonight Show. &quot; &quot; Believe me , I don ' t want to be cocky , &quot; Jean said , &quot; because there ' s a huge chance this will fail , but we ' re at least trying to approach it in the ' Simpsons ' manner , using all_the best writers we can find and really working_on the scripts before they get filmed. &quot; In some ways , animation is a writer ' s paradise because there are no limits . &quot; On ' The Simpsons , ' and we do_it a lot on this show , you can say Homer Simpson is stupid and fat and ugly and he smells , &quot; Reiss said . &quot; If they were real actors , you just couldn ' t write that . You couldn ' t write those jokes . Actors do have feelings . that ' s why you don ' t hear fat jokes on ' Roseanne , ' even though if you were going_to take a shot , that ' s the first one you would take. &quot; And the characters in &quot; The Critic &quot; don ' t pull any punches . &quot; I sort of have a theory that the only way the kind of people we ' re writing about in ' The Critic ' can be sympathetic is if you draw them , &quot; Brooks said with a wry smile . The downside is the long lead time : None of &quot; The Critic &quot; movie parodies can be very current . As a result , &quot; We ' re doing a lot of different ' Jurassic Park ' jokes , and we hope people will remember the movie in six months , &quot; Reiss said . There are also more timeless sequel satires -- such_as &quot; Home Alone 5 , &quot; in which the kid is 23 with a beard and still living at_home holding his head screaming -- and parodies of such genres as movies adapted from TV_shows ( in one bit , Marlon Brando receives $ 8 million to play Mr. French in &quot; Family Affair : The Movie &quot; ) . &quot; Hey , I said it should look nothing like me ! &quot; Lovitz cried , staring at a new lapel pin featuring his squat character -- a sort of cross between Danny DeVito and Charlie Brown . &quot; I don ' t want to become Mr. Magoo , &quot; he said in reference_to the popular animated character who ended_up typecasting the voice actor who played him , Jim Backus , because the two bore a vague resemblance . Lovitz , whose film career is taking_off , seriously considered passing_on &quot; The Critic &quot; for fear of becoming stuck_in people ' s mind as the guy who does that cartoon : &quot; I was watching a movie on TV where the guy who did Fred Flintstone ( Alan Reed ) was playing a lawyer . I said , ' Hey , that ' s Fred ! He ' s not right for that role. ' So it ' s a legitimate concern . But most people said , ' Well , you ' re already known and established , so it would n ' t be like that. ' &quot; Lovitz was persuaded to do &quot; The Critic &quot; after reading the pilot script and also seeing the critical praises heaped upon Robin Williams as the genie ' s voice in &quot; Aladdin. &quot; &quot; When Robin Williams did ' Aladdin , ' everyone knew it was him and it was fun , &quot; Lovitz said . &quot; After something like that , animation almost becomes hip_to do. &quot; Brooks was won_over by Lovitz ' s comedic abilities when he saw an advance screening of &quot; A League of Their Own. &quot; Many critics thought Lovitz stole the show as the obnoxious talent_scout Ernie Capadino in what turned_out to be a career-making role . After that , film offers began pouring in , and Lovitz now has several movies awaiting release . He plays the lawyer of Elijah Wood , who divorces his parents in director Rob Reiner ' s &quot; North , &quot; and he ' s Billy Crystal ' s brother in the sequel to &quot; City Slickers. &quot; He ' s now working_on the comedy &quot; Home for the Holidays , &quot; in which he ' s Nicolas Cage ' s brother . In fact , it was because of Lovitz ' s busy film schedule that &quot; The Critic &quot; is animated at all . Brooks initially wanted to do a live-action TV series in 1992 about a morning network news_program from the perspective of the makeup woman , with the film critic as a peripheral character . Once Brooks envisioned Lovitz as the film critic , however , he decided to make the critic the star of the show . But Lovitz didn ' t want to commit to the full-time chores of a live-action comedy series . &quot; We had actually used John as a guest star on ' The Simpsons , ' &quot; Jean said . &quot; When we recorded ' The Simpsons ' with him , we were laughing so hard we were ruining the takes . Honestly , we were . So he was the only one we ever wanted . And we said , ' Well , if he ' s going_to do movies , we can make_it animated and probably make the whole_thing work. ' &quot; Brooks wasn ' t excited about that prospect , given the grueling task of producing animation . After &quot; The Simpsons , &quot; Brooks said , &quot; there was a little bit of never again . It ' s always been a desperate struggle to get ' The Simpsons ' right . It ' s not like we figured_out one day , this is what works , and then everything was easy . As a matter_of_fact , ' The Simpsons ' continues to be the most exhausting show on television . The burnout rate is amazing . &quot; But then here we are , &quot; Brooks said with a sigh . The reason he agreed to go_through it again ? Because he really wanted Lovitz . Now , Lovitz can spend just a_few weeks each season in the recording_studio taping an entire season ' s worth of episodes , leaving him free to pursue movies . &quot; There will never be another genesis for a show like this again , &quot; Brooks said . &quot; This has been the longest journey to get a specific actor for something , because it went_on forever . But it ended_up the way it seemed like it was supposed to end up. &quot;</TEXT>
