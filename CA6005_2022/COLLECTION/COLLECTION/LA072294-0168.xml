   <HEADLINE> ACCOUNTANT MISSING SINCE JULY 7 IS FOUND DEAD IN HIS CAR ; SIMI VALLEY : BODY OF FRANK PLAICE IS DISCOVERED AT BOTTOM OF EMBANKMENT . HE MAY HAVE DIED FROM A MEDICAL CONDITION , NOT THE CRASH , OFFICIALS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Missing for two weeks , a Simi Valley accountant was found dead Thursday at the wheel of his car , which had smashed into thick brush at the bottom of a steep embankment off the Simi Valley Freeway . The body of Frank Plaice , 57 , was still belted into his white 1994 Ford Probe when the car was spotted near Rocky Peak about 10:35 a.m. Thursday by Simi Valley police investigators in a sheriff ' s helicopter . A tow-truck driver winched the car back_up the 100-foot slope , and Ventura County coroner ' s investigators removed Plaice ' s body for an autopsy scheduled today . &quot; Hopefully he didn ' t suffer and wasn ' t trapped in there , &quot; his ex-wife , Jeanette Plaice , said Thursday as she waited for relatives to arrive in Simi Valley and plan the funeral . &quot; We ' re just kind of re-grieving , because we were really grieving originally in trying to find_out where he was. &quot; Frank Plaice was last seen July 7 at the Simi Valley Elks Club . He had stopped there -- he often did as club secretary -- to drop_off some papers , a fellow Elk said . No one had seen him since , and when his false teeth were discovered in his empty Simi Valley condo , his friends and family feared the worst . They sent_out flyers and scoured the route he often drove from his Chatsworth office to his Ventura County clients . The discovery of his body Thursday ended the grim search . But it did not solve the mystery of his disappearance or the cause of his death . A medical problem -- not the crash -- may have led to Plaice ' s death , said police and a coroner ' s investigator . The Ford had not rolled_over , its air_bag had inflated , and Plaice ' s body showed no signs of massive injuries , said Simi Valley Police Lt . Mark Layhew . Also , the car ' s pop-up headlights were up and its light switch was_on , Layhew said , indicating Plaice may have gone_over the side at night . &quot; It appears as though he may have succumbed to some sort of medical condition , &quot; Layhew said . Plaice ' s family said he had complained of chest_pains as recently as July 6 , the day before he disappeared . Doctors at Kaiser Hospital in Woodland Hills had diagnosed the pain as indigestion and prescribed medication for his stomach , but he still complained of the pain , said Gerry Grooms , his girlfriend of five years . Jeanette Plaice said her ex-husband was the type who would rush himself to the hospital if he was feeling gravely ill . &quot; I think he must have had a sudden attack of something , &quot; she said . &quot; He threw on his clothes -- it must have been like early morning -- and he was trying to get_to Kaiser when he realized it was more_than indigestion . . . . Instead of calling_for assistance , he went himself. &quot; That , she said , could also explain why Plaice , a diabetic with some missing teeth , had left_behind his false teeth and insulin in his condo ' s bathroom . And California Highway Patrol Sgt . Robert Dickie pointed_out , &quot; There ' s no skid marks at all . I don ' t think he braked . . . . He just veered off the roadway. &quot; Plaice ' s car left the freeway grade at the eastern end of Simi Valley just west of Rocky Peak Road , plunged down the 100-foot embankment at a 45-degree angle and buried itself nose first in a stand of live_oak . Two slight gouges are visible where the Ford ' s front_end scraped over the asphalt curb , police said . But no one on the freeway or the Southern Pacific railroad_tracks more_than 200 feet below could have seen the wreck or the two smooth tracks the car had beaten into the brush as it barreled down the slope , they said . &quot; If you were right here , &quot; Dickie said , &quot; There ' s no skid marks . There ' s nothing to even intrigue you to come_over here to look. &quot; Layhew added : &quot; The big question is . . . why didn ' t someone see him go_over the side ? &quot; Indications are , based on the fact that the headlights were in the up position and the switch was_on , that he was driving_in the hours of darkness and was driving_in a break_in traffic when he went over. &quot;</TEXT>
