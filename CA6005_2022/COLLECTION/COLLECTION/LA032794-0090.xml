   <HEADLINE> CAMP CRUISE : AN INAUGURAL VOYAGE ON THE AMERICAN FAMILY CRUISES_SHIP PROVED A BUMPY RIDE FOR PARENTS , BUT THE KIDS HAD A BLAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The moment we boarded the American Adventure cruise_ship , a grizzled Italian seaman , pushing by , stopped short at the sight of our 15-month-old baby girl . &quot; Che bella ! &quot; he exclaimed . &quot; Ciao , bambina , ciao ! &quot; Of course . This was the new American Family Cruises line , where even the guys working in the boiler room behave like Italian grandmothers when they see babies . For us , it was a match made in the Caribbean : a family cruise_ship that was_on just its second voyage last December , and the Dwyers , who had been_on one prior cruise -- so it was the Staten Island Ferry , whattaya , a snob or something ? -- but never had considered taking another . We are -- sigh -- past the moony-couples-phase of life . We have -- shriek -- young kids . Leisure is someone else ' s job . We travel only to places where tables have no sharp corners and where we are supervised by other kids and parents . A cruise ? On a boat ? In the water ? No , not really . At least , I didn ' t think so until someone started counting noses and realized that people who have kids want to go somewhere . American Family Cruises rolled_up a giant demographic wave and announced that it would take everyone away to sea and sun for seven days . The kids could do computers or roller-blade or make videos , they could eat themselves sick on pizza and ice_cream , and the parents could Take It Easy . &quot; A vacation is no vacation if it neglects the needs of a very important part of the family -- parents . . . . You need time to be you , &quot; coos the brochure . &quot; To relax and recharge . At AFC , we provide just the right balance of time for kids , time for families together and all-important time for parents. &quot; I grew faint upon reading this . For months , we kept the cruise literature next to the bed and eagerly thumbed it when the hands of the parental clock were pointing to High Anxiety . * In truth , our trip must be graded on two curves -- one for the kids , another for the parents . The trip was a miracle of inefficiency and joyful charm , of sailors and waiters tickling babies and of things that did not work . We could not wait to get_off the ship at the end of the trip . The parties on board were dazzling fun , full of laughs and dancing . Not a single clock gave anything like the right time . Our older girl had a wonderful &quot; dolphin encounter. &quot; But she could not get a pair of in-line skates because this cruise line -- dedicated to kids -- had none smaller than size four . We were , after all , on only the second sailing of the 1 # 500-passenger American Adventure since it was refitted for family cruising . Formerly the Costariviera , which sailed in the Caribbean , the vessel is more_than 30 years old . As a family cruise operation , the American Adventure travels from the Port of Miami through the eastern Caribbean , calling_at Nassau in the Bahamas , a lovely deserted island off the Dominican_Republic and Key West in Florida . The cruise line , the first dedicated entirely to family cruising , was inaugurated Dec . 18 , when four kids broke a giant bottle of Coke on the hull of the American Adventure . By the third day of our trip a week later , the ship had run_dry on Coca-Cola -- and Sprite , and just about everything except ginger_ale -- and somehow was not_able to replenish its supply in the ports . A minor matter , but quite an accomplishment on a cruise that caters to kids and charged $ 1.50 for a can of pop . I think it was right around the time the soda ran_out that my wife Cathy said : &quot; I have never seen so many broken machines in my life. &quot; The soda , popcorn and candy machines didn ' t work . Neither did the elevator at our end of the ship . The coin laundries were out_of_order . By the way , none of this bothered the kids . Seven hundred of them on the boat . Most of them , right up_to age 17 , seemed to have a spectacular time . The cruise is calibrated to please the Youth of America : the quiet and the rambunctious , the kids who are happy dragging a computer mouse and the ones who are thrilled to sing in the karaoke lounge , the children who want to tie-dye T-shirts and those who think bliss is shooting hoops . In the dining_room , we were assigned to a table with the Bell family of Florida . Our older daughter Maura , 7 , table mate Taraya Bell and Taraya ' s pal Harriet Fletcher were near peers and became instant pals . They barely made a move without each other . * About a third of the entertainment deck is devoted to well-designed recreation space for kids and is parceled_out by age_group . The preteens had a room full of Macintosh computers . Maura and pals hung_out there and in a clubhouse called &quot; Sea Haunt &quot; for the 8-to-12 set that is stocked with videos , game tables and a giant aquarium . ( Since our trip , the ship has grouped the 8- to 10-year-olds and 11- to 13-year-olds separately. ) The teens are_on another deck , where they can indulge in such inscrutable teen things as hair and make-over classes and MTV , as well as produce news broadcasts for the ship ' s TV_stations . From breakfast until after midnight , the kids ' programs are abundant , decently organized and engaging . Children age 2 to 4 and 5 to 7 are heavily supervised in an enclosed play area -- Fuzzy Wuzzy and Rockasaurus -- with camp-style activities . The kids made pizza , took trips to the captain ' s bridge , painted their faces and ran a Wizard of Oz show . Parents are not allowed into these areas , but can watch their kids on TV monitors . The young ones are given an ID bracelet , for the duration , and they must be signed_in or out of the clubhouses -- although there seemed to be little attention paid to the identity of the adult doing the writing . Children older than 8 also have structured activities , but the supervision is light . These kids basically have the run of the ship . They can go_for a snack or stick_with the program , which included organized scavenger hunts , T-shirt tie-dying and musical productions . Retired baseball_players Tug McGraw and Manny Sanguillen were_on board for a batting_cage clinic , a big hit with the older kids . Bill Toter , an engineer from Park Ridge , Ill. , and his wife brought their six kids . &quot; The 18-hour pizza and ice_cream is a great idea , &quot; Toter said . &quot; My 12-year-old son is in heaven with the baseball_players . We let them all go , and they had a great time. &quot; &quot; They had a ball , &quot; said New Yorker Pedro Perez of his son , 10 , and daughter , 15 . &quot; My daughter -- I lost her to the ship . She met so many friends . She did what she couldn ' t do_in the city -- be_on her own . The best part of the cruise was the kids . All the kids were friendly . They say hello to you ; they ' re funny . They feel free , devoid_of any danger . And the carnival -- that was beautiful. &quot; It sure was . One night the ship ran a Mardi Gras with a ring toss and dunk the clown games , a friendly magician twisting balloon animals and lots of music , including a jamming steel_band . Another day , on a shore excursion to Nassau , Maura had her &quot; dolphin encounter &quot; -- a dip in a dolphin pool and a chance to pet them . At dinner -- casual dress -- the waiters and busboys , all male , star in theme nights . On &quot; Gags and Giggles &quot; night , the maitre d ' opened the dining-room doors dressed as Groucho Marx , and out blared the theme_song to the old TV cartoon , &quot; Top Cat. &quot; Antonio , the Spaniard who was our waiter , jitter-bugged with Maura all_the way across the room to the table . The restaurant service was very good . The busboy at our table , Sinisa Kucar , a sweet soul from Croatia , cleaned our baby ' s bottles with boiling water at every meal and refilled them with juice or milk . You did not have to commit &quot; diet-cide &quot; on this ship . Fish and pasta were_on the menu every night , along with a beef or meat entree . ( A utilitarian gym featured step climbers , a_few stationary bikes and a treadmill. ) The kids had their own menus of the chicken-nuggets ilk . A cafeteria-style buffet in another room was open for informal meals , but the food was tired-looking and the surroundings unpleasant . ( The company recently announced an overhaul of the buffet menu. ) Shore excursions in Nassau and the Dominican_Republic featured massive barbecues with chicken , beef , pork chops and salads . As for accommodations , our cabin was small -- two sets of bunk_beds , a stall shower just about big enough for an adult -- but well-tended by a friendly stewardess who , every night when she turned_down the covers , left a gift on the pillow . * Now , what about that curve for grown-ups ? &quot; If the kids were not here , we ' d have gotten_off at Nassau , &quot; said Chip Strassberg of Boynton , Fla. , the patriarch of a family of a dozen or so sons , daughters and grandchildren who suffered a string of plumbing problems in successive cabins . &quot; They do seem to be making an effort to accommodate us , though. &quot; &quot; It seemed that they needed another month or two to fix_up the ship , but they ran_out of time , &quot; said Lou Kratter of Huntington Station , N.Y. , who was in the Strassberg entourage . &quot; We knew it was an inaugural sailing , &quot; said Bill Toter , the father of six . &quot; Serving people is the toughest job in the world -- they get angry about something , and then they get_on a roll. &quot; This certainly was true . I was surprised at two things : First , the number of silly minor aggravations , most involving standing in_line to register kids for programs or to go ashore . And second , the level of hair-trigger irritability among some passengers . Many complained loudly at the slightest provocation , and upon hearing genuine grievances of other passengers , adopted them as their own . Shortly after we boarded , rumors flew that the first sailing had been a major disaster . Toilets had backed_up and drowned nearly everyone . The survivors had been given a voucher for a free cruise . As our trip was the second sailing , many people put their noses in the air and smelled trouble , like terriers sniffing for rain and a voucher for another cruise . But we quickly found that most people were enjoying themselves and were happy with the trip . The weather and beaches were lovely . The kids were so happy and noisy I felt I could float away . Some people , it turned_out , did have serious complaints : After the trip , at least six passengers in four states were diagnosed with a particularly nasty form of diarrhea , called Shigellosis . After local health departments reported this , the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention sent questionnaires to everyone in the U.S. who took the trip . The results of the investigation are not yet available . The ship did pass a federal inspection of its sanitary_conditions on Jan . 8 , and no additional confirmed cases of Shigellosis have been reported on the dozen or so cruises that have sailed since ours , according to Steve Blackwell , environmental health officer for the Vessel Sanitation Program . * Assuming the diarrhea outbreak was a freak event , would I recommend this cruise ? Not to anyone with kids under 2 . Since that includes us , let me dwell_on this for a minute . Naturally , parents of babies expect to do most of the minding , but to make the vacation work , they need a_few hours a day_off . The ship brochure says that in-cabin baby-sitting for the little ones &quot; may be available , &quot; and the cruise line president told me it is guaranteed . None was available on our ship -- and there were 22 babies on board . Pretty much the only space on board for the baby set was the Playpen , a big , carpeted room with a good supply of toys for toddlers . Our Catherine had a fine time there . But with no windows , it felt as if we were breathing mall air . And while the older kids are likely to have a great time , what was really needed was some outdoor space for the babies and the younger kids who were intimidated by the six-foot-deep pool and ended_up spending most of their time in those outdoor Jacuzzi-whirlpool things . The cruise promised parents -- but didn ' t deliver -- a special evening alone together in the restaurant , gazing into each other ' s eyes while swirling wine glasses of fine Cabernet . &quot; What about that picture of the chateaubriand they were promising the grown-ups ? &quot; asked John Zadrazil of Queens , N.Y. &quot; Where is the nice dining_room where you have a nice , quiet dinner without the kids ? &quot; Yes , what about the chateaubriand ? &quot; That picture in the brochure was a mistake , &quot; said Bruce Nierenberg , president of the cruise line . However , the cruise line does have an area in the main dining_room where adults can dine without children , he said . Children can eat_in a separate area , or if they are over 2 , be fed first and dropped_off at the recreation areas to play while parents eat . All the cabins with plumbing problems now have been closed_off or repaired , he said . He also said the Coca-Cola shortage has been fixed permanently . The laundry machines are working and are now free_of charge . Nierenberg swears the cruises have improved with each trip . &quot; If you look in your mailbox , you ' ll see that we have sent a letter to everyone on board that trip , inviting them to come_back as our guest , &quot; he said . &quot; Things weren ' t perfect . We want people to know we ' re standing behind the product. &quot; we ' ll give it another try .
