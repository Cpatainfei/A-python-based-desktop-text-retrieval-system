   <HEADLINE> MAGIC MOMENTS ; THE CO-ED WINTER FORMAL AND OTHER DRAMAS UNFOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Smells like teen formal . Gardenia corsages perfume the air at La Quinta High_School ' s winter dance , where other timeless traditions cling_to this , the Academy Awards of teendom dress-up . But slow dancing and staying out too late and other rites of passage coexist with new twists . Kids have sneaked booze into the hop since Eisenhower was President , but when did they get threatened with a Breathalyzer at the door ? What used to be the quintessential date night now finds a platonic party of 32 chartering a bus as its chariot . Do you buy your own corsage for that ? Here in Newport Beach ' s Plaza of the Flags , a food court by day is transformed into the site of &quot; This Magic Moment , &quot; this year ' s Co-Ed dance . Christmas vacation , 1993 , is approaching , and the winter blahs have been fought_off for this pivotal night . A DJ spins the dance songs as couples break_off to pose for those cherished photos their children will one day giggle at hysterically . Click . Yes , girls still sign their photo backs . A few of the teen-agers are buzzing on wine , daring chaperons to catch them . Most are sober . And you can easily find a_few griping about that . &quot; How can anyone loosen_up ? &quot; one partier asks , mock incredulous . The rules for this year ' s Co-Ed : no drinking tolerated ; no leaving the dance for any reason and no returning to the parking_lot until the end , and no &quot; inappropriate &quot; attire -- last year one girl wore a see-through dress . They have been warned a Breathalyzer may be employed . &quot; I think there ' s less drinking and drugs than 10 years ago , &quot; Principal Mitch Thomas says later . &quot; I used to have to deny or carry_away a kid from an event because he couldn ' t walk . I think there ' s still marijuana use among the kids today , but we used to get five-pound bags on kids ( who would say ) , ' Oh Mr. Thomas , I found it on my way to school and didn ' t know what it was ! ' You don ' t see anything like that anymore. &quot; * Amber Myers , a 17-year-old senior , has_on a great dress from Contempo Casuals but is not happy with the dance_music . &quot; It ' s old , &quot; she said of the ' 80s tunes . Her date , Anthony , is a friend . &quot; I don ' t have a boyfriend . I was supposed to come_with some guy . . . . &quot; An adorable blonde rushes up and collapses in a nearby chair . She has big cascading curls to go_with her snit , as the 20 or so candidates for Co-Ed King are lined_up for introduction , pageant style . &quot; I am so fat , &quot; she says , all_of maybe 100 pounds . &quot; All the girls started hating me because I stole the guy they wanted . . . I was a slut , I was a virgin . It ' s like they ' re insecure in themselves . A lot of girls at school have to rip on each other , &quot; she says , perfectly contemptuous and righteous . &quot; I lived_in the_Bronx , and it ' s like , ' get a grip ! ' &quot; She has not spent all four years at La Quinta High_School , and through her tough I ' m-East-Coast bravado -- one can see her frustration at not being fully accepted . Her boyfriend is obviously a Big Guy on Campus and the object of aggressive cute chicks . She sits in the shadows as another girl escorts him to the spotlight . As Paul Herrera is announced the boy with the sexiest legs , the blonde claps , then says the girl escorting her boyfriend flattered herself by suggesting she might actually be able to steal the boyfriend . &quot; She says to me , ' you wanna fight ? ' ' I ' m like , what are you gonna do , stab me with mascara ? ' &quot; The blonde starts laughing . &quot; I mean , get a life ! &quot; After the dance , she and her boyfriend are going alone to a hotel for the night with a hot tub in the room . The boyfriend ' s parents , told that a group of kids were going_to celebrate in the room , put the bill on their credit_card . After Watson Visuwan ' s coronation , the blonde remarks that she ' s happy &quot; the W guy won . All these Vietnamese names -- W , V -- I don ' t know them. &quot; But she and the couples around her are pleased that Watson -- an agreeable football and track_star -- was crowned Co-Ed king because he deserved it . Besides his other charms , he has school &quot; spirit &quot; -- that vaguely defined quality that , say , Kurt Cobain lacked -- and he gets_along well with everybody . He fits_in . He is part of the mixed race troika of academic , student government and sports leadership that still reigns in school popularity . Associated Student Body President Jennifer Chapman is white ; vice_president Thanh Tang is Vietnamese . While it can be said that the majority of students at La Quinta of all races coexist , even get_along , there seems to be an unspoken code : Don ' t make a big deal of it . I notice that terminology does not trip them up ; they don ' t seem to hesitate over whether to say Hispanic or Latino , black or African American . Various students will talk off the record about racial differences -- any differences , for that matter -- and male students fresh off the dance_floor collect around a blonde athlete as he starts to explain . &quot; Like the Orientals , &quot; he says , wiping his sweaty forehead with his tux sleeve . &quot; The Vietnamese people are totally cool with themselves , &quot; says another athlete and class officer type . &quot; They tend to get_along_with everyone because of that . . . . &quot; The group of guys -- mostly white , with a_few Latinos -- goes_on to sound_off about all manner of school irritants . &quot; Those people who buy yearbooks , play sports , all ' s they care about is themselves , &quot; notes a brown-haired youth who does neither . He is bored , and the lingering effects of a marijuana joint smoked before the dance are starting to wear_off . &quot; The dance was fun . I love this school . I wanna go five years. &quot; Yeah , right . * For some reason , these guys couldn ' t care less if I go_to their post-dance party , as long as I don ' t print anybody ' s name without permission . Since I returned to my 1977 alma_mater to chronicle the changed school , students have seemed comfortable with my presence at all sorts of public and private moments , trusting me not to hurt them . Some of the Co-Ed goers are supposedly going night horseback riding , but the stables are way_out in Corona . So it ' s on to the party , on a Westminster cul-de-sac around the corner from where I grew_up . Arriving unfashionably early at 12:30 a.m. , I have to wait parked across the street like a stakeout until the kids who invited me arrive . I don ' t even have kids , and I feel_like a parent . Souped_up cars and trucks are screeching by at high speed , showing_off for party-going stragglers outside . A voice in my head is screaming : &quot; Someone could get killed ! &quot; Everyone else seems unconcerned . On the driveway around 1:30 a.m. , a clutch of guys stands around drinking cans of Miller , which was absolutely easy to score at a nearby liquor_store . They drift one or two at a time behind a hedge to smoke marijuana , and a_few of the jocks pass_around a pot pipe . It ' s the only visible drug . &quot; You ' re tossed ! , &quot; one kid says to a slightly tottering friend . The party hostess -- her dad was gone until later but knew of the party -- wanders outside to say hello and then returns to the house , where all is low volume and extremely tame by the standards set_in my mid- ' 70s days , when so many kids would attend a party sometimes that cars could not enter a street . * Along comes Eric Sizelove , a lanky senior on the water_polo team . For now , he is &quot; kickin ' it , having a mellow time. &quot; For now , with the help of coaches and Principal Mitch Thomas , he is making_it , bearing big dreams of a scholarship and a four-year college stint . I had found Eric a_few days before the Co-Ed , ditching his third_period English_class and lingering in the room of another teacher . Dressed in a long flannel shirt , backward hat and oversize jeans , he slouches in the teacher ' s chair . His short hair is shiny brown , his earring shiny gold . It is no accident that he appears like he can take_care of himself , although his toothy smile distracts from the homeboy look . He is reading over one of his graded English papers while students are learning how to speak English in the background . His story is no less sad for its familiarity . His father was killed in a motorcycle crash when Eric was in fourth grade , and life seems to have been a struggle ever since . His mother remarried a man Eric disliked , and years of battles followed , although stepfather and mother are now divorcing . His mother has been slowly dying of a lung disorder , but the two never discuss it beyond her being &quot; really sick. &quot; A senior in high_school , he has effectively been raising himself and not doing such a good job of it . But transferring to La Quinta High_School this year seems to have turned_around some festering problems . Raised in a rough Westminster neighborhood , Eric grew_up with gangs and their code_of_behavior . The fist or the knife or the gun answered an insult , some chump from enemy turf maddogging you . By junior_high_school he had sent one schoolmate to the hospital . &quot; Before , I was a push toy ; boys picked on me , and I had to prove to myself I wasn ' t going_to be like that . My freshman year I got straight A ' s. &quot; But then he somehow broke his hand and was kicked_off the Westminster High_School basketball_team for missing a game to visit his critically ill mother in the hospital . They told him he didn ' t have the necessary determination and attitude , he says . One gets the sense quickly , however , that Eric had some_other trouble at the school that he summarizes as constant fight-picking by &quot; Asian gangs &quot; because his clothes told them he was a rival Latino gangbanger . Instead , Eric says , he was hanging_out with 30 fellow members of a dance crew called Footprints , a group of guys that goes_to clubs and dances against other crews . &quot; We kicked_out the druggies and gang types , &quot; he notes . &quot; My crew &quot; avoids battles , he contends , but he admits that competition at dance clubs over all manner of things -- a glare , a girlfriend -- routinely can lead to fights . Why ? &quot; It ' s just how life is , &quot; he says with a slight shrug . &quot; I face violence every day . I face violence when I wake_up in the morning . It ' s something that I have to do so I ' m not a statistic. &quot; It is easy to see how some classmates and more_than a_few teachers conclude over time that trouble doesn ' t follow Eric ; he seems to ask_for_it with his confrontational mouth . He constantly has the periscope up , scanning for signs of disrespect . &quot; I never hurt someone with an object , &quot; he says slowly , leaning_back in the teacher ' s wooden desk chair . &quot; I don ' t believe_in hurting someone to_the_point of dying . When I was in seventh or eighth grade , I broke a_couple_of ribs , beat_up a guy and put him in the hospital . Since my junior or senior year , I decided I wasn ' t going_to do that anymore. &quot; About midway through his time at Westminster High_School , Eric ' s angry-at-the-world attitude contributed to some_other problems , and he transferred to La Quinta , a less tumultuous campus at the other side of the city . A few days before the Co-Ed dance , he is saying that La Quinta has been better for him because it ' s &quot; safer , smaller , so people know each other and you have more of a sense that nobody ' s gonna start trouble . But it ' s more boring , &quot; he adds . Adults such_as basketball_coach Jim Perry and water_polo coach Mark Cholette have worked tirelessly with Eric , knowing that sports could ultimately save him by delivering the identity , sense of belonging and worth that gangs gave him before . They are sensitive to those times when he needs to miss water_polo or basketball practice because his mother , a hairdresser when she can work , falls ill . But with the tenderness come unwavering rules . They are firm on discipline , being a team member and winning and losing with grace . And they watch him teeter on_the_fence , ready to catch him before he may fall . So far , it has worked , and Eric appreciates that &quot; school is good ; teachers are nice , and Mr. Perry understands what I ' m going through. &quot; * The bell rings and class is over . After her mostly Vietnamese-speaking students leave the room , teacher Barbara Henry walks to her desk to hear how things went_with Eric . I tell her I ' m stunned by his resignation about his turbulent life , and to violence . She shakes her head , dark elbow-length hair falling_over her shoulder . Dressed in jeans , a black sweater and loafers , she looks far younger than she is . &quot; Life is not as we remember it in high_school , &quot; she says with a deep exhale , and she sees this not just with her students but her children ' s classmates . &quot; They are dealing with so_much more . The parents are at_work all_the time . These kids are raising themselves . You have to look_around and say , ' These kids are not as bad as they seem , given what they ' re dealing with. ' You wonder how some of them make_it . The kids who are coddled don ' t always ( make_it ) . Those who have to work , do. &quot; From coach Perry ' s standpoint , school officials do as much as they can -- and then more . &quot; The problem is , they gotta go_back to their neighborhood. &quot; Of Eric , he says , &quot; he and his stepdad don ' t get_along ; his mom ' s gonna die . You couldn ' t pay me enough to be in that young_man ' s shoes . It ' s easy to take_care of non-problem kids who say please and thank_you . Eric needs . . . somebody to chew on him . We got him through water_polo with a lot of strokes . He was the only kid in the ( Garden Grove ) league who made the county all-star team . He ' s got some really good skills . He ' s interested in one of the Top 10 college water_polo programs in America. &quot; For now , Eric is concentrating_on making the basketball_team . But he will have more_than that to worry about by spring .</TEXT>
