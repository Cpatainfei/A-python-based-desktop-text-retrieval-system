   <TEXT> When a bearded 23-year-old anti-war activist named Bill_Clinton arrived here on New Year ' s Eve , 1969 , he found a sad , gray city under the heel of then-Communist Party leader Leonid I . Brezhnev . Soviet troops had crushed the Prague Spring reform_movement in Czechoslovakia the previous year ; the Cold_War was a deep_freeze . The Communist_Party was launching its celebrations of the 100th anniversary of V . I . Lenin ' s birth , and the Writers Union had just expelled revered novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn . Mikhail S . Gorbachev was a minor Communist_Party functionary in Stavropol . Boris N . Yeltsin was an obscure Siberian construction engineer . Moscow was cleaner and more orderly then , but poorer . The average Soviet diet was 50 % starch . The nation had one telephone for every 32 people . And in Moscow department_stores , a pair of shoes cost one-third of the average monthly salary . Almost a quarter of a century later , as leader of the Free_World , Clinton returned on Wednesday to a Moscow that is &quot; a new city in a new country , &quot; said Yuri N . Alexandrov , an architect and historian . Moscow once called itself the Third Rome , heir to the Roman and Byzantine_empires . Now expatriates call it the Big Potato . The young American President arrives in the Russian_capital as it is trying to shed its Communist trappings and rediscover its pre-1917 identity and , paradoxically , to fast-forward past the decades of Soviet stagnation into the global high-tech economy . Indeed , with its stunning ancient churches and equally breathtaking potholes , its new glitz , grime and gangsters , its neo-capitalist frenzy and its bitter new poverty , this metropolis of 9 million embodies Russia ' s struggle to remake itself . It is a city where more_than 5 # 000 Mercedes-Benzes crowd Cadillacs and Saabs in traffic_jams , where people no longer gawk at the sight of a car telephone . But each time they park , drivers must remove their windshield_wipers or they will be swiped . Such vandalism has become so endemic that elevators in high-rises have been disabled by hooligans who use cigarette_lighters to burn_off the plastic control buttons for all_the floors . The hottest thing in Moscow , though , is biznes . This is a city gone shopping-mad . Soviet economists once estimated that people nationwide spent 30 billion hours each year standing in_line . Today , most lines are not to buy , but to sell . Children hawk sodas and bananas at busy intersections , and sleek boutiques offer European designer fashions and Rolex watches . But the average Muscovite ' s monthly salary is $ 92.65 , so women still spend hours hunting for necessities at affordable prices . In winter , fruits and vegetables are still out_of_reach for many . Russians who once sat in their kitchens arguing about literature , film and politics complain that the pressure to make money leaves them less time for friends . When they do meet , the talk is of money , shopping and real_estate . The beloved U.S. dollar is banned from commerce , as authorities try to prop_up the value and the prestige of the ailing Russian ruble . When Clinton visited in 1969 , one ruble was worth $ 1.10. On Tuesday , the official rate was 1 # 293 rubles to $ 1 . Clinton spent about a week in Moscow on a winter break from his graduate studies at Oxford_University in England , where he was a Rhodes scholar . The student was described as being &quot; pudgy , &quot; bearded and always hungry by an acquaintance quoted in the Washington Times . Clinton stayed in the National Hotel overlooking the Kremlin -- then the enemy headquarters that no American President had ever visited . Today , the National is under scaffolding , as is much of old Moscow . Renovated 19th-Century buildings are unveiled almost daily , rising like pastel-painted confections from sidewalks crumbling into mud . The National is being renovated by an Austrian firm . When it opens in August , it will compete with the luxurious Metropol and Baltshug Kempinski hotels , where the visiting White_House press corps will shell_out $ 300 and more per night for single rooms . The nearby Lenin Museum , where student Clinton could have checked_out the old revolutionary ' s Rolls-Royce , is closed by Yeltsin ' s decree . Across the street , a casino has opened_up in Revolution Square , which retains its socialist name . The neighboring 50th Anniversary of the October_Revolution Square has mercifully been returned to its pre-Bolshevik moniker , Manezh Square . If Clinton takes a stroll in Red Square , he will see a tiny , gold-domed brick church on the spot where public_toilets stood_in 1969 . It is the Kazan Cathedral , razed by Stalin in an anticlerical campaign in 1936 but rebuilt and reconsecrated this year by the Russian Orthodox Church . Religion is back in in the former Communist capital . Clinton also will meet with Patriarch Alexi II , leader of the Russian Orthodox Church , in the Danilov Monastery . The Communists used the 13th-Century sanctuary to lock_up juvenile_delinquents before returning it to the church in 1983 . Moscow was spruced_up for previous summits . But the only visible improvement this time is the removal of soot and artillery holes from the Russian White_House . The massive marble fortress had not been built when Clinton visited in 1969 . After President Yeltsin ' s tanks blasted rebels out of the former Parliament on Oct . 4 , workers labored around the clock to repair the building for use by Yeltsin ' s Cabinet and other top officials . Before they moved_in , a priest was summoned to bless the building with clouds of incense , as though to exorcise the evil_spirit of the former occupants . From his room at the new Radisson Slavjanskaya Hotel , the American President may be able to see a line of empty windows at the former Moscow mayor ' s office , now the home of the new Duma , or lower house of Parliament . The windows were shot out during a firefight between government forces and anti-Yeltsin rebels who stormed the skyscraper on Oct . 3 ; as of Tuesday , the windows had not been repaired . Clinton probably won ' t be riding the Moscow Metro , which has been expanded since his last visit and now has electronic signs announcing how much time has elapsed since the last subway_train departed . At rush_hour , the ticker rarely passes the two-minute mark . And though fares have increased sharply , the Metro is still a bargain at 50 rubles , or 4 cents , a ride . Happily for Clinton , security precautions will keep Moscow motorists far from the President ' s limousine . The demise of the centrally planned economy has allowed anyone with money to buy a car , and millions of new drivers have done so . Traffic_jams are approaching Los Angeles frustration levels , with accidents epidemic . In 1992 , 36 # 371 people died nationwide in car crashes -- more_than double the number of Soviet soldiers killed in nine years of war in Afghanistan . The 1993 death toll is expected to be even higher . To the casualty list must be added the Russian who was shot by a neighbor for taking too long to turn_off his screeching car alarm . Moscow now requires that all non-Russian visitors pay a daily fee of 774 rubles , about 60 cents . No one has suggested applying the rule to the visiting President , as it is mainly aimed at merchants and other people from the Caucasus ; Russian officials blame them for much of the city ' s skyrocketing crime . Human_rights groups have protested the fee as racist . But Moscow officials have not backed_off , perhaps because public sentiment is behind them . During the period of martial_law last fall , police detained more_than 14 # 000 people and deported 5 # 000 who did not have permission to live_in Moscow , many of them Caucasians . Polls showed most Muscovites were sorry to see the state of emergency end . What irks most people more_than economic hard_times is the dirt , anarchy and carelessness that many blame on the permissive Yeltsin democrats . Last year , Muscovites were incensed by the discovery of more_than 40 # 000 pieces of undelivered mail that had been dumped in a pond near Sheremetyevo airport , confirming their worst suspicions about the Russian postal_service . Still , what has probably changed most here is the people . On Dec . 31 , 1969 , the day Clinton arrived here , the Communist_Party official newspaper , Pravda , reported that America was &quot; continuing the criminal use of chemical and biological weapons in Vietnam. &quot; Other Page One stories lauded Moscow factories for having met their annual production quotas by the Nov . 7 anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution , and declared that the cotton workers of Tajikistan were busy familiarizing themselves &quot; with great interest &quot; with the party Central Committee ' s latest doctrine released for the 100th anniversary of Lenin ' s birth . &quot; Nineteen-sixty-nine was a dreadful year , &quot; said Bulat S . Okudzhava , who was then the most popular songwriter in Russia and remains almost a national hero today . In an interview this week , Okudzhava said his circle had been despondent over the crackdown in Czechoslovakia , the stepped-up repression of intellectuals and the &quot; mendacious &quot; Brezhnev reign . Clinton then could hardly have spoken with any ordinary Russians , except the &quot; security people and ( Communist ) Party people &quot; who kept_an_eye_on tourists , the bard said . During the 1992 presidential campaign , Republicans suggested that the young anti-war activist could even have met with the KGB during his trip , an intimation that candidate Clinton scornfully dismissed . As a visiting President , &quot; I wish he ( Clinton ) would stop in the street and talk to people , &quot; Vyacheslav V . Kostikov , Yeltsin ' s press secretary , said in an interview Tuesday . &quot; He would see that Russia is a psychologically open society , &quot; not the repressed country of 1969 when &quot; people were dressed in gray coats and Russian-made suits that all look alike. &quot; Clinton is_due to speak directly to the Russian people on television Friday and to take questions from callers in a TV &quot; town_meeting &quot; of the sort he held during the presidential campaign . &quot; Imagine an American President on Russian television back then -- simply impossible ! &quot; Kostikov said . &quot; Now there is even no need to negotiate with Russians the topic of his speech. &quot; And though Russians ' unquestioning worship of everything American has cooled , the young President should have an easy time winning the hearts of Moscow ' s youth , who are already sold on U.S. pop culture . Teen-agers are listening to Guns N ' Roses , Poison , Culture Beat and rap , though &quot; American rap is better , &quot; said Tatanya Klimenko , 16 . Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone are hot , as is Whitney Houston . The blue_jeans their parents tried to buy from visiting tourists like Clinton are out ; leggings or , better yet , bell-bottoms are in . Fashion and image matter here . As for the President , &quot; I like Clinton , &quot; said Maria Romanova , also 16 . &quot; He is a new power . Clinton , in my view , can change the country -- both countries -- for the better. &quot;</TEXT>
