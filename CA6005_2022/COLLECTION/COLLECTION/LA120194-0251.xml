   <TEXT> An international drug-money laundering operation -- so brazen that prosecutors charge it used lawyers , rabbis , a diplomat , and a police_officer who reportedly stored close to $ 1 million in his precinct locker -- was broken_up Wednesday after raids in New York , Florida , Colombia , Europe and Los Angeles . Mary Jo White , the U.S. attorney in Manhattan -- where the indictments of 23 defendants were unsealed -- said the ring used couriers and cooperative bank officials to launder tens of millions of dollars in narcotics proceeds in the past year . Federal_agents photographed some of the alleged couriers carrying cash_in boxes and duffel_bags to a Citibank branch in the_Bronx , where an assistant manager was charged with aiding the operation by depositing the cash and then wiring the deposits to accounts in Europe and elsewhere . &quot; The significance of the scheme is the number of professionals involved , &quot; White said . &quot; It is white-collar crime at its worst. &quot; &quot; Rabbi , police_officer , hospital administrator , attorney , honorary consul general -- it sounds like a list of professions one would aspire ( to ) , &quot; said William A . Gavin , deputy assistant director in_charge of the FBI ' s New York field office . &quot; Money became the narcotic . Even people in respectable professions yielded and succumbed to temptation. &quot; Among those arrested after the 10-month investigation were securities dealer Latchezar Christov , 57 , the honorary consul general in Los Angeles for the Republic of Bulgaria , and Donald J . Hayden , 59 , also a securities dealer at Laidlaw Equities in Santa Monica . Court papers charged that Hayden &quot; received large quantities of cash at his office , &quot; which was then shipped via Federal Express to other ring members in New York . Prosecutors charged that Christov worked with Hayden , &quot; receiving cash and shipping it. &quot; The federal complaint described Christov ' s honorary-consul position as being a part-time employee of Bulgaria and noted that he had immunity &quot; only in connection with official acts &quot; involving diplomacy . Prosecutors charged that the ring handled drug proceeds for traffickers in the United States , Canada , Puerto Rico and cities throughout Europe . During their investigation , agents seized about $ 5 million in cash from alleged members of the organization . White charged that the ring leaders in the United States were : Richard Spence , a former New York City firefighter and a successful businessman ; Harvey Weinig , a Manhattan lawyer ; and Robert Hirsch , who was Weinig ' s law partner . Hirsch was arrested separately and has pleaded guilty to money_laundering and other charges . According to the complaint , Spence was responsible_for organizing money pickups , depositing large sums of cash into bank_accounts and moving the cash to various accounts via wire transfers . Prosecutors said Spence operated a trucking_company , a beer distributorship and a home-heating and oil_company . Court papers charged that Weinig ' s law_firm was used to conceal the organization ' s activities , to engage in banking transactions and to coordinate with bankers and couriers in Europe . Also charged was Michael Kalanz , a 30-year-old police_officer assigned to a precinct in the_Bronx . Prosecutors charged Kalanz was &quot; responsible_for counting and storing substantial amounts of United States currency and transporting it to banks on behalf of the organization. &quot; Much of the money was secreted in luggage kept_in Kalanz ' s six-foot precinct locker , which was secured with a padlock . FBI_agents charged that the network of couriers included two rabbis . FBI_agents said a search of the home of Gary Salerno , an alleged courier who works as a hospital administrator , turned_up what appeared to be a &quot; hit_man ' s kit &quot; -- including weapons , handcuffs and a garrote , a device used to strangle victims . If convicted , the defendants each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $ 500 # 000 fine .</TEXT>
