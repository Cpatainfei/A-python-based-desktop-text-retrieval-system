   <TEXT> The awful facts are straightforward , simple . She was the victim of a brutal rape . The assailant was caught and convicted on 28 counts involving 11 different women . He received 153 years in prison . But it ' s Catherine Christie who feels_like the one serving a life sentence . Even as the Orange County woman continues to salve the emotional wounds she suffered in the 1988 attack , her anger has grown_over society ' s attitude toward rape . Though her attacker will probably never leave prison , Christie learned that such stiff sentences are the exception rather than the rule_in California , where rapists average less than five years behind bars . &quot; Like others , I will live with the effects of this rape for the rest of my life , &quot; Christie said . &quot; It only seems fair that perpetrators should face the same consequences. &quot; She might soon get her wish . Buffeted by gusts of anti-crime sentiment sweeping the state in this election year , the Legislature is considering a &quot; one strike &quot; measure that would put rapists and child_molesters behind bars for life after a first conviction . It would be the strictest such penalty in the nation . The bill , carried by state Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) at the behest of Gov . Pete Wilson , has been championed forcefully by victims of rape and molestation such_as Christie , who came_forward with several others last week to provide compelling personal testimony at a televised Capitol public hearing . * The Times ' policy is not to identify rape victims , but Christie ' s name is being used in this story -- with her permission -- after she was publicly identified at the hearing . While Christie and other boosters suggest a &quot; one strike &quot; law would mete_out an appropriate penalty and could help begin to curb rape and molestation , opponents contend the proposal goes too far , representing a dangerous precedent as the state and nation grapple with how best to get_tough on crime . Critics argue that Bergeson ' s bill would send incarceration costs skyrocketing and , in cases of date_rape or incest , have a chilling effect on victims , witnesses , jurors or even prosecutors -- potentially making_it more difficult to put sex offenders behind bars . They also say the measure blindly boosts penalties to the limit instead of carefully ratcheting up sentences for varying sex crimes , which run the gamut from lewd behavior to the most savage of rapes . &quot; This isn ' t the drafting of penal law , this is the crayoning in of punishments on an apparently arbitrary basis , &quot; said Franklin Zimring , a professor of law at UC Berkeley . &quot; Penal law reform has become a branch of the theater of the absurd. &quot; Most critics blame the effort on election-year politics and pent-up public rage over crime . And in recent weeks , rape has became a top story . * A public outcry erupted last month over the parole of Melvin Carter , a serial rapist eventually released in rural Modoc County . In Claremont , residents protested plans to parole a convicted rapist in their community ; their hopes were answered at least temporarily when he flunked a psychiatric test and was kept behind bars . Wilson absorbed a dose of public abuse for the Carter parole but has used the &quot; one strike &quot; bill as a powerful retort . When gubernatorial opponent Kathleen Brown blamed him for Carter ' s release , Wilson responded with a television commercial ripping the Democrat for misunderstanding California parole law and citing the &quot; one strike &quot; bill as proof he is tough on crime . Of late , the Republican governor has barnstormed the state touting the &quot; one strike &quot; bill to boost both his crime credentials and his stock with women voters . But some women ' s groups , most notably the National Organization for Women , say the &quot; one strike &quot; measure would make rape reporting and convictions less likely . Wilson stalwarts , meanwhile , suggest NOW ' s opposition stems from a different motivation -- the group has endorsed Brown in the race for governor . Whatever the motivations , critics contend the &quot; one strike &quot; bill remains an election-year caricature of careful legislation . &quot; The bottom_line is that politicians feed_on crime hysteria to help themselves get elected , &quot; said Francisco Lobaco , the American Civil Liberties Union ' s state legislative director . &quot; that ' s the unfortunate reality of the day. &quot; Opponents tried to water_down the Bergeson bill during last week ' s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing . Sen . Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) attempted to add language drawn from Democratic legislation that would essentially make only the most heinous crimes subject_to a &quot; one strike &quot; penalty of life in prison . An uneasy Bergeson pulled the bill back and asked_for more time to work with opponents . &quot; People are legitimately concerned about public safety and tired_of repeat offenders who seem to be inadequately punished , &quot; Lockyer said a_few days later . &quot; But I want the Legislature to produce a statute that ' s appropriate and not overreact because it ' s fashionable ( to pass harsh crime laws ) in an election year. &quot; Bergeson and officials in the governor ' s office remain resolute , saying they won ' t compromise on the legislation . &quot; I think we will have the votes to move a strong bill , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; The bottom_line is we release 250 convicted sex offenders from prison in California each month . To me , that is unacceptable. &quot; * Bergeson contends a tough &quot; one strike &quot; measure is needed because most perpetrators of sex crimes are repeat offenders who rarely respond to rehabilitation . &quot; I don ' t want to give them a chance at that second victim , &quot; she said . But critics say evidence demonstrates otherwise . A 15-year study concluded in 1988 by the state_Department of Justice found that about 20 % of all sex offenders were arrested again for a similar crime . Lockyer and others suggest the statistics paint an ominous scenario -- the &quot; one strike &quot; bill might unnecessarily incarcerate for life the four of five who would not likely commit another sex crime . Few of the bill ' s opponents dispute that repeat rapists and molesters with a penchant for violence deserve to be put_away for life . But they express concerns about handing_out such extreme punishment for every sex crime conviction , suggesting a blanket life sentence for all might produce unintended effects . In less sensational cases , juries may acquit defendants if they believe the penalty doesn ' t fit the crime , critics contend . Prosecutors , meanwhile , may be more reluctant to press charges , they say . People assaulted by friends or family -- particularly in incest cases -- might refuse to cooperate with authorities once they learned of the possible consequences , they say . Such qualms have prompted some prosecutors to quietly voice reservations about the current draft of the Bergeson bill . Even as devout a crime fighter as Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren , who agrees certain sex crimes demand a life sentence , has expressed concerns to Wilson that the bill might discourage the reporting of some cases , particularly molestations . The bill also would impose a life sentence for an offense such_as spousal rape that may currently be charged as a misdemeanor . A molesters who forcefully fondles a child under the age of 14 through his or her clothing also could be put behind bars for life . &quot; Why should marital rape be considered more serious than unaggravated first-degree murder , attempted murder , mayhem ? &quot; Zimring questioned . &quot; Having relations with someone under 14 is a serious crime , but is it worse than murder ? &quot; * Under current law , rape and many other violent sex crimes are punishable by sentences ranging from three to eight years for a single count . Lobaco of the ACLU contends those terms are tough enough , particularly because rapists often serve consecutive prison sentences for multiple convictions . Others worry because rape and molestation have among the highest rates of false arrests , increasing the odds that innocent people could be incarcerated for life . Zimring , for one , finds it troubling . &quot; All around us , &quot; he said , &quot; we ' re having this enormous debate about recovered-memory cases and in the middle of it up walks the governor with a proposal to make incest a crime punishable by life in prison without the possibility of parole. &quot; Boosters of the &quot; one strike &quot; bill , however , contend that such arguments shouldn ' t eclipse the most pressing reality they see : that sentences for rape and molestation aren ' t tough enough .</TEXT>
