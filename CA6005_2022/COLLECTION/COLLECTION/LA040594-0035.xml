   <HEADLINE> WORLD_VIEW ; DEALING WITH JAPAN ; TWO WAYS TO CUT A TRADE_DEFICIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was almost exactly five years ago that France ' s then-minister of European affairs , Edith Cresson , lectured a pair of American reporters about the abysmal U.S. trade_deficit with Japan . &quot; Americans don ' t see what ' s going_on with the Japanese , &quot; she insisted . &quot; They are like ants , eating you up . You just don ' t notice it , don ' t feel it , don ' t see it. &quot; Pausing , she added , &quot; We plan to be firm with the Japanese. &quot; And the Europeans did try firmness . They worked to keep a tight control on Japan ' s auto exports , with France and Italy resorting_to especially tight quotas to guard their domestic industries . Since 1989 , the European Union has launched 26 anti-dumping actions against Tokyo , charging the Japanese with unfair pricing practices . Occasionally , EU member countries even took a page out of the Japanese book of subtle-but-effective non-tariff barriers . French customs authorities , for example , quietly decreed that all imported Japanese videocassette_recorders be cleared at Poitiers , a city nearly 100 miles from the nearest port and staffed by a single customs inspector . The collective impact of these measures , however , hardly dented the Japanese trade juggernaut . For Europeans , as for Americans , the imports kept growing , Japan ' s home market remained closed and trade_deficits soared . But as a frustrated United States reaches for a hammer to resolve its trade disputes with Tokyo , the Europeans are now trying the kid-gloves approach . While Washington has opted to revive its feared &quot; Super 301 &quot; legislation , giving President Clinton the ability to impose sanctions against Japan , and has forced showdowns with Tokyo in areas such_as cellular_telephones and semiconductors , the Europeans are engaging the Japanese in a conspicuously quiet dialogue to coax the Asian industrial giant toward greater openness . &quot; We agree with the Americans ' goal ( to reduce Japan ' s trade surpluses by opening the Japanese domestic market ) but not their means , &quot; said Peter Guilford , the EU ' s chief spokesman on trade matters . &quot; The Americans give the impression they can ' t venture out the door ( on trade matters ) without a gun and holster. &quot; It ' s hardly surprising that the Europeans have changed tactics . In the years since Cresson vowed firmness , the European Union ' s cumulative trade_deficit with Japan has reached $ 142 billion -- a figure even greater than the American imbalance with Japan when expressed as a percentage of total trade . ( Taken together , Japan ' s trade surpluses with the United States and the European Union , the world ' s two other great industrial trading powers , total $ 384.5 billion for the past five years. ) While the EU ' s trade imbalance with Japan declined slightly in 1993 , few see it as the start of an encouraging trend . And there are other problems . For instance , Japanese direct investment in the 12 EU states was running at about 15 times the rate of European investment in Japan the last time it was measured , two years ago . At the core of the present European strategy is a so-called trade assessment mechanism ( TAM ) in which groups of Japanese and Europeans review the flow of trade_in about 30 specific product areas , then trouble-shoot if there are problems . In the 15 months since they were established , the groups have met eight times in either Tokyo or Brussels , with many of the initial sessions devoted to such basics as statisticians from both sides explaining methods and databases . &quot; This has been an intensive exercise , &quot; noted Tetsuo Yamashita , a senior trade specialist at Japan ' s mission to the EU . &quot; People have gotten_to know each other well . We ' re hoping for a positive outcome. &quot; In an attempt to keep the TAMs away from the public_eye , both sides have agreed to a virtual news blackout on the contents of the talks -- refusing , for example , even to name the product areas under discussion . The first real proof of the TAMs ' effectiveness , however , is expected to come toward the end of next month , when EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan travels_to Tokyo to discuss with Japanese leaders what action the results of their discussions require . Some analysts believe the Europeans could benefit from the intensity of Japan ' s dispute with the United States . &quot; The Japanese will be under pressure to do something , &quot; declared an EU trade official . &quot; They ' ve got_to show that there ' s a softer way to resolve these issues , that something less than browbeating works. &quot; Europeans , it seems , have decided to coax Japanese markets open with praise rather than prod with criticism . As the EU applauded the modest market-opening measures announced by Tokyo last week as a &quot; positive first_step , &quot; U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor dismissed the package as &quot; half-finished work &quot; with few specifics . The package included pledges to further stimulate Japanese domestic demand and reform government purchasing procedures , presently biased toward domestic suppliers . The fact that the Europeans employ such a low-profile strategy reflects the very different images Japan has in Europe and the United States . Despite its steady inroads , Japan still accounts_for only about 10 % of the EU nations ' total foreign trade . Partly because of this , Japan-bashing has yet to become a political sport here . In the United States , the Japanese percentage of total American foreign trade runs_around 15 % . Indeed , since the collapse of the Iron_Curtain in 1989 , West European politicians have been far more preoccupied with the potential trade impact of the new , low-wage democracies on their eastern doorstep than with Japan . The extent to which the Europeans have tried to distance themselves from the latest U.S. clashes with Japan was underscored in recent comments by Brittan , who described the American approach of setting numerical targets for specific products variously as counterproductive and discriminatory , &quot; incompatible with Europe and America ' s mutual commitment to free_trade and multilateralism , &quot; he huffed . Independent European economists tend to support the EU ' s tactics , at least for the present . &quot; Experience has shown that Japan only reacts to pressure , but that pressure can ' t just be brutal demands , &quot; said Helmut Laumer , a director of the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research . &quot; The consciousness in Japan has grown enormously that something has to be done . Now is the time to work carefully. &quot; Said James Rosenstein , spokesman for the Brussels-based Assn . of European Automobile Producers : &quot; We agree with this general approach . Most Europeans don ' t like managed trade. &quot; Despite the criticism of American tactics , however , Brittan and other EU trade officials have begun to talk_about a trilateral approach to the problem , in which they would work with the Clinton_Administration and Japan on the trade_balance . But they claim that Washington has so far failed to share information from its contacts with Tokyo that , they say , is necessary for any greater U.S.-EU cooperation . Some question the sincerity of American calls_for closer coordination . &quot; There ' s a certain suspicion that the Americans only want some cover and international respectability for Japan-bashing , &quot; commented Guilford , the EU trade spokesman . The American ambassador to the European Union , Stuart Eizenstat , denies that the United States is withholding information on its talks with Japan . He said in an interview that &quot; a rather intensive exchange &quot; of data has already begun . &quot; They ( the EU ) may_not be fully satisfied with the detail they ' ve gotten , but the process has begun and it ' s continuing , &quot; he said . Eizenstat also cited two key factors that could drive the EU into closer cooperation with Washington on the Japan issue . * Europe ' s deepest recession since the 1930s has generated an urgent need to create more export-led jobs . Opening_up the large and rich Japanese domestic market could help do just that . * Data gathered during the TAMs process could convince Europeans that their products are running_into the same trade_barriers that American goods have hit in trying to penetrate Japanese markets . &quot; They haven ' t come_to any final conclusions yet , ( but ) they are beginning to recognize -- as we have -- that many of the problems are not of_their_own making , &quot; Eizenstat said . * There are also signs that even supporters of the EU ' s less confrontational tactics are growing impatient for results as the deficit with Japan persists . While negotiators from the EU and Japan last month concluded an agreement that offers Japanese auto_makers a slight increase ( to about 12 % ) in their share of the huge EU market in 1994 , there has been little progress in Japan ' s commitment to open its auto market to European cars . Automobiles , the biggest single item in the EU ' s trade with Japan , also constitute roughly one-third of the EU ' s 1993 deficit . &quot; At present , it ' s all for them and nothing for us , &quot; said Rosenstein , the spokesman for the European auto_makers . &quot; In a reasonable world , European producers should be able to get_about 10 % of the Japanese market , when we ' re now getting_about 2 % . We ' re entirely dissatisfied with this. &quot; * Brussels Bureau researcher Isabelle Maelcamp contributed to this story .
