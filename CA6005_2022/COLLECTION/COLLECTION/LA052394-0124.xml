   <HEADLINE> ROYAL DEED CROWNED ; FULLERTON RABBI HONORS SON OF BULGARIAN KING WHOSE ACTIONS SAVED 50 # 000 JEWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly 2 # 500 worshipers listened as a rabbi read Scripture at the Crystal Cathedral on Sunday morning . &quot; God has blessed us with salvation , &quot; read Rabbi Haim Asa , who wore a yarmulke and prayer_shawl during a service complete with a gospel choir and bells . Indeed , salvation was what the service was all about . For Asa , however , the term has direct meaning . He was among the estimated 50 # 000 Bulgarian Jews -- virtually the country ' s entire Jewish population -- saved from almost certain death at the hands of the Nazis by the courageous actions of King Boris III , then leader of Bulgaria . The rabbi and a smattering of other grateful former subjects were_on hand_over the weekend to honor the now-deceased king in the person of his son , King Simeon II . The festivities included a dinner Friday at Sephardic Tifereth Israel Temple in Los Angeles and the taping of Sunday ' s service , part of Crystal Cathedral pastor Robert H . Schuller ' s internationally known television_show , &quot; Hour of Power. &quot; A tour of the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance with Branko Lustig , the Academy Award-winning producer of &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and a Holocaust survivor , is scheduled for today . The commemoration will culminate in a ceremony tonight in Beverly Hills when King Boris is posthumously awarded the Jewish National Fund ' s Medal of the Legion of Honor , becoming the first non-Jew to be given what is one of the highest honors bestowed by the Jewish community . &quot; We thank_you for the gift of life that your father gave my people , &quot; Asa said at Sunday ' s service . Asa , the spiritual_leader of Fullerton ' s Temple Beth Tikvah , said his family fled Europe shortly after their lives were saved by the king . That occurred in 1943 when King Boris III -- whose country was aligned with Germany -- refused Adolf Hitler ' s direct orders to deport Bulgaria ' s Jewish population to Germany for extermination . Instead , the king urged the Jews to move to the countryside and blend_in with the general population , telling the Fuehrer that he needed the Jews to help build roads . On Aug . 14 , 1943 , Boris was summoned by Hitler to Germany , where the two had a meeting described by witnesses as a tense and angry showdown over the king ' s lack of cooperation in The Final Solution and his refusal to supply Bulgarian troops for the Russian front . Two weeks later , the 49-year-old king died under mysterious circumstances in what some believe was a poisoning ordered by Hitler . King Simeon II , who was 6 years old when his father died , was deposed by the Communists who took_over after the war . He has lived_in exile in Spain ever since . Asa said his efforts to gain recognition for King Boris ' courage began 32 years ago when he wrote his master ' s thesis on the subject . But his effort hit two major obstacles : Bulgaria ' s Communist regime , which was not eager to glorify the monarch it had deposed , and some in the American Jewish community , who were unwilling to admit or unaware that a German ally could have saved so many . That resistance eroded , the rabbi said , after two recent events . In 1990 , Bulgaria ' s Communist regime gave_way to a democratic form_of_government . And earlier this year , he said , &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; -- Steven Spielberg ' s Academy Award-winning movie about a German who saved Jews -- dispelled public perceptions that a member of the Axis establishment , by definition , had to be an anti-Semite . &quot; When you find a man who saved 50 # 000 Jews , how can you not honor him ? &quot; said David Horne , Los Angeles chairman for the Jewish National Fund . &quot; It ' s critical for people to know that someone who was the head of a state did something so important. &quot; Jack Mandel , president of the American Congress of Jewish Concentration_Camp Survivors , based in Los Angeles , agrees . &quot; He should have been recognized a long_time ago , &quot; Mandel said of King Boris . Unfortunately , he added , human nature &quot; is never to find somebody who saved , but only to persecute the ones who did wrong. &quot; King Simeon , who seemed near tears during Sunday ' s service , said he is deeply moved by the public recognition of his father ' s efforts . &quot; For a son to see such genuine and good-hearted recognition is gratifying , &quot; he said . &quot; But what my father did was only what any decent person would have done. &quot; Not necessarily so , according to Asa . &quot; This is important because history has to be made an instrument of good , not only evil , &quot; the rabbi said . &quot; History must teach that there was as much good in certain places as there was evil in others. &quot;</TEXT>
