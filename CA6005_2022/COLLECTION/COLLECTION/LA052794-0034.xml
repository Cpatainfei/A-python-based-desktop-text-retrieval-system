   <HEADLINE> A WORTHY EXPLORATION OF WAR ' S MENTAL WOUNDS -- TAKE 2 ; THE EYE IN THE DOOR BY PAT BARKER ; DUTTON ; $ 20.95 , 280 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Charles Manning , posted to the Ministry of Munitions in London during World_War I in the wake of a front-line injury , is talking to his Army psychiatrist , Dr. William Rivers . Manning begins by describing how he had to shoot one of his men , Scudder , after Scudder had become trapped in a mud-filled shell hole , sinking slowly and vocally to his death . Reporting to battalion headquarters with another serviceman , Hines , the following night , Manning found his superiors extremely unhappy ; dining on veal and ham and wine , the officers informed Manning that he had positioned his company too far forward , creating a bulge in the line . Manning suddenly realized that he and Hines would n ' t be offered even a drink . &quot; So I leant across the table , &quot; Manning says , &quot; took two glasses , gave one to Hines and said , ' Gentlemen , the King. ' And of course they all had to struggle to their feet. &quot; Manning and Hines made a quick retreat , &quot; giggling like a pair of schoolboys , &quot; before the startled brass &quot; could work_out how to put an officer on a charge for proposing the loyal toast. &quot; that ' s when the shell hit , Manning says , pointing to his mangled leg . &quot; Poor old Hines . . . . I crawled across to him . And he looked straight at me and said , ' I ' m all_right , Mum. ' And died. ' &quot; In &quot; The Eye in the Door , &quot; Pat Barker continues the story started in her highly acclaimed novel &quot; Regeneration , &quot; which centered_on the conflict encountered by Rivers in his treatment of wounded , often shellshocked infantrymen , notably the soldier-poet Siegfried Sassoon . As a doctor and a human_being , Rivers wanted to make his patients better , whole ; but as a British citizen and Army employee , he knew that every medical success meant sending one more soldier back to the battlefield . Rivers ' internal conflict does play a role in &quot; The Eye in the Door , &quot; but in this novel Barker focuses less on Rivers than on Billy Prior , an angry , shellshocked patient from &quot; Regeneration. &quot; It ' s through Prior that we meet Manning , whom Prior picks_up for a sexual encounter , and begin to see that the new novel is not only about inwardly divided minds but about the stress triggered by war in society at_large . Prior , like Manning , works for the Ministry of Munitions , but he has a much bigger chip on his shoulder about the war effort . Manning seems to have made his peace with the irrationality of war , perhaps because he still believes_in what River calls , in another context , a &quot; terminal stiff upper lip. &quot; Prior , by contrast , seethes with a barely suppressed rage , caused not by shellshock but the inequitable divisions in British society . And as it happens , at the ministry he can do something about it : A childhood friend , a shopkeeper named Beattie Roper , has been sent to prison for threatening to kill Prime_Minister David Lloyd George . Prior visits her in prison and is quickly convinced that she has been railroaded ; a pacifist from the lower classes who freely admits to hiding conscientious_objectors , she was an easy_mark . that ' s one major thread in &quot; The Eye in the Door. &quot; Another is the real-life libel trial brought against a London newspaper for publishing articles alleging the existence of a German Black_Book purportedly giving the names of 47 # 000 English sexual deviants , many of them in high places . No matter that the Black_Book ' s promoter , Harold Spencer , was later judged insane ; a similar view is expressed by Prior ' s boss , Major Lode , when he says Britain was being &quot; brought_to its knees . . . not by Germany , but by an unholy alliance of socialists , sodomites and shop stewards. &quot; Prior can ' t tell Lode , of course , that both he and Manning are bisexual , nor that Lode ' s obsession with sexual and social distinctions is part of Britain ' s problem . The third major strand in &quot; The Eye in the Door &quot; is Prior ' s fugue states in which he commits out-of-character and sometimes violent acts that his conscious mind cannot remember . This Jekyll-and-Hyde theme carries the novel ' s weight , because one of Barker ' s themes is that authentic feeling , socially acceptable or not , will inevitably work its way to the surface and may well become dangerous if repressed . Rivers frequently expresses that same concern : It ' s better to hate war even as you do the soldier ' s job , he tells his patients , than to bury one ' s disgust at needless bloodshed and wade through the killing fields like an automaton . As Rivers muses , after seeing Sassoon again upon the writer ' s return to England with a minor head wound : &quot; Perhaps , contrary to what was usually supposed , duality was the stable state ; the attempt at integration , dangerous. &quot; Passages like that make &quot; The Eye in the Door &quot; an exceptional novel , bringing substantial and relevant ideas to life through singular , arresting characters . Rivers is the psychiatrist of one ' s dreams , willing to change places with a patient if he believes it will do the patient good ; Prior is the friend you couldn ' t keep , unpredictable and angry enough to keep most acquaintances at a distance . The novel has its flaws -- Beattie ' s story simply peters_out , for example , and Sassoon ' s reappearance seems unnecessary -- but it is a worthy sequel nonetheless and a fine achievement in its own_right .</TEXT>
