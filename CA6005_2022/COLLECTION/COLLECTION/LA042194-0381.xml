   <HEADLINE> HIS EYE ' S NOT ON THE PRIZE ; THIRD PULITZER HASN ' T MADE EDWARD ALBEE ANY MELLOWER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The last time Edward Albee won the Pulitzer Prize -- in 1975 for &quot; Seascape &quot; -- the late producer Richard Barr joked , &quot; We were burning the sets of the play when we heard the news. &quot; that ' s what producers do when a show closes . The drama had failed on Broadway , playing only 65 performances . On April 11 , when news of his third Pulitzer Prize , this time for the drama &quot; Three Tall Women , &quot; reached the playwright , he was in Texas , where he is playwright-in-residence at the University of Houston . &quot; It ' s terribly discouraging , &quot; he said facetiously when interviewed on the phone early the next morning . &quot; It makes one all grumpy and sad . Grump . Grump. &quot; The comment itself is vintage Albee : a hint of a wicked self-mockery , mixed with reproof that a reporter would even ask how it feels to regain critical stature after nearly three decades of dismissive -- often brutal -- reviews and audience neglect . What do awards and public approbation have to do with the work_at hand , which is , after all , writing plays ? Still , a note of triumph can ' t help but creep into his soft , slight raspy voice when the 66-year-old playwright adds : &quot; Of course , I ' m surprised and delighted . But then I ' m surprised when I don ' t win awards , too . Every artist has many lives and deaths and you really can ' t afford to think too_much about it . There ' s never been much of a link between quality and popular acceptance , so you just keep_on doing_it on the assumption that you ' re doing_good work. &quot; Albee ' s fall from commercial and critical approbation had been all_the more precipitous given his stunning successes in the early ' 60s , first with a widely hailed Off Broadway production of &quot; Zoo Story , &quot; and then , on Broadway , with &quot; Who ' s Afraid of Virginia Woolf , &quot; his acid-etched marital slugfest later translated to the screen in 1966 with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor . Since then it ' s been a long dry spell . One would have to go all_the way back to 1983 to find a work of his on Broadway , &quot; The Man With Three Arms , &quot; which received withering reviews and died quickly . Until recently , only academia and regional and foreign theaters have welcomed the playwright . In fact , his work had rarely been seen in New York at all until last fall , when the Signature Theatre , a small 77-seat house in downtown Manhattan decided to devote an entire season to his work . His latest play , &quot; Fragments , &quot; opened two weeks ago and was the last in a lineup that included five New York premieres and two revivals . Like most of the other plays_at the Signature , this abstract and enigmatic chamber piece met with respectful if unenthusiastic notices . The New York critics ' acclaim and the Pulitzer was reserved for &quot; Three Tall Women , &quot; a play that received its world_premiere in Vienna in 1991 and then played a now-defunct Upstate New York theater before bowing at Manhattan ' s Vineyard Theatre in January . The response was so strong that the production moved almost immediately to an open-ended commercial run at Off Broadway ' s Promenade Theatre . In &quot; Three Tall Women &quot; an imperious 92-year-old woman played by 64-year-old veteran actress Myra Carter , simply identified by the letter &quot; A , &quot; is based on Albee ' s rich socialite mother , Frances , whose tempestuous relationship with her son led her to disinherit him . She repeatedly told him , &quot; I ' m sorry I ever adopted you. &quot; Albee gets his revenge . In the first act , she is an addled but remarkably feisty dowager who can ' t remember if she ' s 91 or 92 . She alternately tyrannizes and is tyrannized by her young lawyer , &quot; C , &quot; ( Jordan Baker ) and a middle-aged companion , &quot; B &quot; ( Marian Seldes ) . At the end of the first act , the elderly woman suffers a stroke . At the beginning of the second act , what the audience takes_to_be her body lies motionless on a bed . But all three actresses suddenly materialize , each representing a different period in the matron ' s life . Sparring with their respectively younger or older selves , they review a lifetime of bent hopes and schemes with regret and lacerating humor . Last fall , as he prepared &quot; Three Tall Women &quot; for its New York premiere , Albee reviewed his own life and career in his spacious TriBeCa loft , one of his three residences . Frances Albee may have disinherited him , but the playwright ' s early success made him a rich_man . Against the backdrop of his stunning collection of primitive and contemporary art , the playwright spoke_of the &quot; tough old bird &quot; who inspired the play that would represent his comeback . &quot; She was destructive and contemptible but there were reasons for her behavior , as there always are , &quot; he said . &quot; Writing the play allowed me to understand her better , though I ' m not sure I liked her any more or less than I already did. &quot; Although he insisted that he isn ' t the type of writer who usually draws_on his own life for subject_matter , he admitted that writing &quot; Three Tall Women &quot; was a form of exorcism . &quot; I just tried to get_it all down , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s the theme : What is worse than coming_to the end of your life filled with regret ? I was interested in the facts , man , just the facts : the good stuff , the bad , the misplaced pride . The facts carry implications with them. &quot; It has been often suggested that the playwright ' s steely iconoclasm and alienation stems from his adoption as a baby by Reed and Frances Albee , his father a wealthy scion of a vaudeville house chain and his mother a striking and ambitious one-time store model turned socialite . Their rebellious son , who grew_up in a Larchmont , N.Y. , mansion , got kicked_out of a number of boarding schools and Trinity College before heading for Greenwich_Village to steep himself deeply in the ' 50s counterculture and avant-garde . He found his family ' s bourgeois values &quot; detestable &quot; and excoriated them in his 1961 play &quot; An American_Dream &quot; and in his first Pulitzer Prize-winning drama , &quot; A Delicate Balance &quot; in 1967 . Although he got_along better with his father -- he is recalled both with affection and bitterness in &quot; Three Tall Women &quot; -- Albee rarely returned home once he ' d left . Albee says that Frances was ambivalent about her son ' s stunning , if short-lived , early triumphs . On one hand , the social_climber in her loved the celebrity and the famous people who eagerly sought_out the enfant_terrible of Broadway to boost the cachet of their dinner_parties . On the other hand , she denigrated his bohemian and gay lifestyle . ( In &quot; Three Tall Women , &quot; the old_woman is obviously homophobic , making a scathing reference_to her son ' s young lovers. ) * His new work appears to be as corrosive and cutting as ever , especially when it comes_to marriage . In typical Albee fashion , recrimination , reproof and betrayal affect the marriages represented not only in &quot; Three Tall Women &quot; but in two of his New York premieres at the Signature , &quot; Finding the Sun , &quot; from 1982 , and &quot; Marriage Play &quot; ( 1987 ) . In the latter , he replays some of the airless and stultifying territory of &quot; Who ' s Afraid of Virginia Woolf &quot; ; in the former , he scopes out new ground by presenting a gay couple who are no longer living together because , due_to societal pressures , they have gotten mired in terribly unhappy marriages with women . &quot; I ' m not against marriage , &quot; Albee said . &quot; I ' ve only railed against people who ' ve continued in a relationship beyond its usefulness and continue in it dishonestly . It ' s the misuse and self-delusion that bothers me. &quot; Indeed , the man who has so wittily and viciously assailed the institution of marriage in his work takes a certain pride in his own long-term gay relationships , the present one having lasted for 23 years . He said he was the &quot; happiest &quot; he ' s been in years . Yet despite the domestic calm , he is at_the_same_time insistent on the writer ' s role as social provocateur and critic . Sometimes playwriting attacks the problems directly , as in David Mamet ' s work , he explains , and other times , the approach is more subtle and ambiguous , as in his own . To those activists who fault him for not having written a play about AIDS , he responds that they don ' t understand his work . &quot; I think all my plays confront being alive and how to behave with the awareness of death , &quot; he says . &quot; If AIDS , on one level , is about how we , as a society , do not deal with what we don ' t want to deal with , if it is also about whether we should or not , then my plays have been about that from the very beginning . I now have a play I ' m writing that tangentially touches_on the_matter of AIDS that will make a number of people very angry , but it ' s no departure for me. &quot; For decades , Albee has delighted in provoking audiences . ( He maintained that he ' d love to write screenplays but Hollywood hasn ' t exactly been beating_down his door. ) Yet , amid the bleakness and rage of his new work , one can detect the barest hint of redemption , if not optimism , seeping through . Yet the playwright will brook no suggestion that he has in any way mellowed over the years . &quot; Grump , grump , &quot; Albee mocks again , at the suggestion that perhaps the bloodletting in his plays lends a certain lucidity to the characters that will make the future , however limited , more hopeful . &quot; I hope what you ' re suggesting is not a softening of my head , &quot; he said . &quot; I do have persistent angers and concerns , you know. &quot; He insisted that he would continue to mine those angers and concerns whether they met with popular and critical acceptance or not . &quot; Yeah , I want to reach as wide an audience as possible but , alas , on my own terms . I don ' t want to compromise or oversimplify just to give myself the illusion of accomplishment . You start lying , telling half-truths , well , what ' s the point ? Ascribe it to my arrogance -- an arrogance that any artist in the United States has got_to have to survive -- but I can ' t really approach my work in any other way. &quot; DONNA DIETRICH / Newsday</TEXT>
