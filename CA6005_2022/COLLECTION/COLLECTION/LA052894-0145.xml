   <HEADLINE> RESEARCHERS TRY TO SEPARATE SMOKING FACT FROM FICTION ; HEALTH : EFFECTS OF SECONDHAND EXPOSURE ARE BEING STUDIED . BUT THERE IS A COLLISION OF POLITICS AND SCIENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The big brown building , a short walk_off a country road in this scenic college town , looks more like a barn than a high-tech university laboratory . Inside , a rare and curious contraption is engaged in a habit that the surgeon_general warns is bad for your health . This is Kent Pinkerton ' s creation : the UC Davis smoking machine . As an associate_professor of anatomy at Davis , Pinkerton is interested in how the lungs work . His specialty has landed him at the crossroads of politics and medicine . In his lab at the university ' s Institute of Toxicology and Environmental Health , Pinkerton and his colleagues hope their unusual smoking machine will inject hard science into the roiling national debate over the dangers of secondhand smoke . How , they are eager to know , are the cells and tissues of the lungs altered by exposure to secondhand smoke ? Are infants born smaller when they are exposed in the womb ? Does secondhand smoke induce changes in the nasal passageways that lead to asthma ? Is there a precise dose -- for lack of a better term -- at which it becomes dangerous ? If so , where does the threshold lie ? At a time when &quot; Secondhand Smoke Kills &quot; billboards are popping_up across California , and the government has classified secondhand smoke as a human carcinogen , nonsmokers worry that the slightest whiff of smoke could wreak havoc on their lungs and hearts . Cigarette companies are waging a counterattack , insisting that it is little more_than a nuisance . The truth , which independent scientists say is somewhere in between , may emerge from the smoking machine . Scientific truths about secondhand smoke are not easy to come_by . Studies are difficult and expensive to conduct , and funding is limited . Moreover , ethical considerations prevent researchers from subjecting humans to cigarette smoke , at least not for days on end . Nor can they ask people to smoke for the sake of science . Hence the busy Davis smoking machine . Five days a week , six hours a day , the machine is at_work , blowing smoke at guinea_pigs and hamsters , whose body_parts will later be dissected in an effort to identify biological reactions that may be similar in humans . The device -- one of just two large-scale smoking machines in the nation outside of those owned by tobacco companies -- smokes more precisely than any person ever could , and therein lies its value . There are no Marlboros , Camels or Virginia Slims here . Rather , the smoking machine ' s brand of choice is one few people have heard of -- the 1R4F . These low-tar and nicotine research cigarettes , each manufactured from the same tobacco blend , are produced by the University of Kentucky . They were rolled in 1983 and kept_in a deep_freeze until being shipped to Davis , where they are conditioned for up_to 48 hours at 70 % humidity before being smoked . Every 10 minutes , a steel piston fires another 1R4F into a revolving cylinder . A small metal coil , the sort used to heat an ordinary blow-dryer , lights the cigarette with a tiny red glow . As ashes begin to emerge , two others are in various stages of being smoked . The whole mechanism is encased in a plexiglass box that is yellow with smoke residue . Through a series of pipes , the box is connected to chambers where the animals are kept . With every puff , the cylinder clicks another revolution and a red_light flashes . Each cigarette -- there are never more_than three burning at any time -- is smoked in precisely the same fashion : one puff a minute , each puff lasting two seconds , eight puffs in all . To create each puff , a vacuum draws_in 35 milliliters of air -- no more , no less . There is , Pinkerton says , an important reason for all this precision . Soft-spoken and lanky , the scientist is a master of understatement , never going_out on a limb . &quot; If we are going_to understand the mechanisms ( by which secondhand smoke injures people ) , &quot; he says , &quot; we need to have well-controlled conditions. &quot; * The Davis studies have been under way for three years -- a short span in science , when research often lasts for decades . The university scientists are particularly interested in the effects of secondhand smoke on young children ; studies show infants and toddlers -- who may suffer from bronchitis , asthma and other respiratory_diseases when exposed to secondhand smoke in the home -- are its primary victims . Among the Davis findings : Toxicologist Peter Witschi has shown that pregnant rats exposed to secondhand smoke gave_birth to pups that weighed 6 % less than those born to other rats -- not a dramatic reduction , but one that experts say is significant . Dr. Jesse Joad , a pediatrician , has demonstrated that newborn rats exposed to secondhand smoke in the womb and after birth test positive for asthma . Pinkerton has found that the lungs of newborn rats develop more slowly when exposed to secondhand smoke . As part of the experiments , Joad is investigating how nerve_fibers in the lungs of guinea_pigs are harmed by exposure to secondhand smoke ; the damage prevents the lungs from fending off other pollutants . Witschi is trying to determine whether a particularly strong carcinogen called NNK produces lung tumors in hamsters exposed to secondhand smoke , as it does_in animals that breathe direct smoke . Few such studies have been done before . &quot; This is very beginning stuff , &quot; Joad said , adding : &quot; The kind of testing that we are going_to do absolutely could never be done on children. &quot; Tobacco_industry critics contend that the research is a waste_of_time . Chris Coggins , a toxicologist for cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds , says he has done his own animal research on rats and found no biological changes in the heart , lungs or respiratory_system . The only damage documented in the study -- which appeared last year in the journal Inhalation Toxicology -- occurred in the tip of the rats ' noses , Coggins said , and was &quot; completely reversible &quot; when they were no longer exposed to the smoke . Tobacco_industry consultant Gio Batta Gori , also a toxicologist , calls the Davis studies irrelevant . Humans , Gori argues , have the &quot; intrinsic capacity &quot; to clear their bodies of low-level pollutants , including secondhand smoke . &quot; You can manipulate the experiments any way you want and come_up with some results , &quot; Gori complained of the research at Davis and other animal studies . &quot; You can choose a strain ( of animal ) that is susceptible , and you can use doses that are beyond the capacity of the animals to clear. &quot; Witschi says the doses can be manipulated -- and must be -- if scientists are to learn at what levels secondhand smoke becomes dangerous . The animals in the Davis experiments are generally exposed at 1 # 000 micrograms of smoke particles per cubic_meter of air -- levels that the researchers say are high , but can be found in typical smoking environments , such_as bars . However , some studies -- including Witschi ' s NNK research -- employ levels as high as 4 # 000 micrograms , concentrations that he acknowledges are much higher than those found in the real_world . These concentrations are a matter of great dispute . Coggins , the Reynolds toxicologist , maintains that real-world concentrations average only 35 micrograms per cubic_meter in smoking homes . In bars , he says , concentrations would run only as high as 100 micrograms per cubic_meter . His rat studies employed exposures of 100 micrograms , 1 # 000 micrograms and 10 # 000 micrograms -- and found no effects even at the highest dose , he said . * On such minutiae hang the answers to crucial questions about secondhand smoke ' s health effects . According to the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention , as well as health advocacy groups , 53 # 000 people die each year from exposure to secondhand smoke . This figure is based on epidemiology studies , which examine patterns of illness but do not prove cause and effect . The studies implicate secondhand smoke in lung_cancer and other cancers , heart_disease , sudden_infant_death_syndrome , bronchitis , pneumonia and asthma , especially in children . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , relying_on the lung_cancer epidemiology , has declared secondhand smoke a Group_A human carcinogen -- a classification that puts it in the same category as radon and asbestos . But tobacco_industry officials say the EPA ' s research is flawed because people overestimate the amount of smoke they have been exposed to , or lie_about their smoking habits . The animal research may settle this debate by showing what epidemiology cannot : precisely how secondhand smoke wreaks its havoc , and exactly how much exposure is dangerous . Experts say it is not safe to assume that passive smoking affects people in the same way as active smoking . This is for two reasons : Those exposed to secondhand smoke get a smaller dose -- inhaling about 1 % of the toxins that smokers absorb . At the same time , however , secondhand smoke is much dirtier , partly because it does not go_through a cigarette filter , said Stanton Glantz , a UC-San Francisco researcher . In the business of tobacco research , what smokers inhale is known as &quot; mainstream smoke. &quot; What comes_off the burning end of the cigarette is &quot; sidestream smoke. &quot; Secondhand smoke -- also known as environmental tobacco smoke -- is made_up mostly of sidestream smoke , but also includes what the smoker exhales . Sidestream smoke is a complex blend of more_than 4 # 000 chemicals -- including carbon_monoxide , formaldehyde , ammonia , nicotine , zinc , nickel and arsenic . In the air , it is an elusive target ; some chemicals evaporate , some condense , some attach_to the lining of the lungs when inhaled while others do not . The EPA has found that five known human carcinogens and nine probable carcinogens are emitted at higher levels in sidestream smoke than in mainstream smoke . Other toxic elements -- including carbon_monoxide , ammonia , nicotine and acetone -- are more concentrated insidestream than mainstream smoke . NNK , the carcinogen Witschi is studying , is one to four times stronger in sidestream smoke than in mainstream smoke . This is not to suggest , experts say , that exposure to secondhand smoke is more dangerous than active smoking -- it is not . But , with the exception of tobacco_industry scientists , researchers who are trying to assess the danger of secondhand smoke are finding that exposure clearly has biological effects . At the University of Maryland , Dr. Rebecca Bascom has performed some of the few studies on humans . After exposing medical_students to high concentrations of secondhand smoke for 15 minutes , she found that some experienced itchy eyes and nasal congestion , but that the reaction was not a classic allergic one -- meaning standard allergy medicines would not help people who are sensitive to cigarette smoke . At New York University Medical_Center , which maintains the only other large university-based smoking machine in the nation , researcher Arthur Penn is trying to figure_out how secondhand smoke affects the hearts of young children exposed to smoke in their homes . Penn and his colleagues exposed young chickens to very heavy concentrations of sidestream smoke -- he used five cigarettes smoked at once -- and found significantly larger plaques in their arteries than in a group of control chickens . Over time , these plaques can build_up to include deposits of fat and cholesterol , which cause heart_disease . Some of the plaque lesions were so big they could be seen without a microscope . All the chickens were_on a low-cholesterol diet , he said . In a subsequent experiment , Penn ratcheted_down the exposure level , this time subjecting the chickens to the smoke of just one cigarette -- about the same concentration as in a smoky bar . He found that even then , the chickens developed significant plaques , leading him to conclude that the same may happen in children of smokers . At UC-San Francisco , Glantz has conducted similar studies on rabbits with similar results . &quot; These results , &quot; Penn said , &quot; clearly indicate there are real , long-term effects on the cardiovascular_system due_to involuntary exposure to cigarette smoke , and our recent studies show that it is at levels you could find in many public venues. &quot; * Such research , however , does not occur in a vacuum . Politics swirls around these scientists in the same way that secondhand smoke swirls around the animals they study . Penn , Pinkerton and the others are always on_guard about what they say , knowing that any statements might be used by one side or the other in the emotional debate over restricting smoking . The collision of politics and science troubles Pinkerton , for he is not a political man . His sole interest , he says , is science . Understanding how secondhand smoke affects the lungs -- particularly in young children -- will help him better understand how all kinds of pollutants alter the respiratory_system . &quot; I know it ' s a very emotional issue , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s one of those things where we could relieve the consciences of a lot of ( parents who smoke ) or we could make them feel more guilty than ever. &quot; And then there are the constant battles for funding . The tobacco_industry , through its Center for Indoor Air Research , finances a good portion of research . Pinkerton and Penn have taken tobacco dollars , and have no qualms about it , saying they have never felt interference in their methods or what they publish . But Penn learned an interesting lesson recently : After his low-level exposure chicken studies came_up with damning conclusions , the Center for Indoor Air Research told him it would not fund subsequent work . He is now hunting around for a new grant . &quot; we ' ll be happy to take money from almost anybody , &quot; he said , &quot; with no strings attached. &quot; Pinkerton relies_on a grant from Proposition 99 , the anti-smoking initiative adopted by California voters in 1988 . But that money , too , may run_out ; in a move that is angering many scientists , Gov . Pete Wilson wants to redirect the research dollars to medical_care . The money comes from the same pool that pays_for a massive education campaign about the dangers of tobacco , including the ubiquitous secondhand smoke billboards . Pinkerton says he doesn ' t think much about who foots the bill or what their agenda might be . &quot; We don ' t want to be driven by trying to come_up with proof for legislative ideas , &quot; he said . &quot; I know that may sound contrary to what our sponsors want , but . . . if that is our only objective to doing research , then I think we are not doing_justice to science , and to our whole creative process of trying to understand how things in life work. &quot; In the Air Secondhand smoke accounts_for 85 % of all indoor air_pollution , according to researcher James Repace . Pollution is measured in micrograms of &quot; respirable particulates &quot; -- breathable particles -- per cubic_meter of air . The federal standard for clean air is 50 micrograms per cubic_meter . Although the tobacco_industry disputes his work , Repace ' s measurements show that smoky indoor air is more polluted than a busy highway . Library of Congress : Washington , D.C.
