   <HEADLINE> HOG WILD ; ROARING INTO CONSERVATIVE LITTLE TOKYO , A JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN ' S HARLEY-DAVIDSON SHOP IS TURNING HEADS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Suenori Takayama was born to be wild . The &quot; Easy Rider &quot; movie buff and motorcycle enthusiast from Kyoto , Japan , gave Japanese Village Plaza in Little Tokyo an offbeat look with the recent opening of a Harley-Davidson shop . Takayama , who owns two Harleys and a dealership in Kyoto , said he decided to expand his business to Little Tokyo in hopes of drawing not only Japanese tourists , but the Downtown business crowd as well . &quot; I want to have more Japanese people in Japan ride Harleys , &quot; the 39-year-old businessman said through an interpreter by phone from Japan . Takayama also sees his shop , Gem USA , as a way to develop friendships with and welcome American bikers or motorcycle hobbyists . Surrounded by clothing_stores , sushi restaurants and a bakery , the dealership stands_out in the plaza like a Harley on the freeway . Neon lights with the company_name and an &quot; Easyriders &quot; logo decorate the front window of the store . Harley cruisers are_on display inside , and leather jackets line the side walls . Gem USA also sells motorcycle parts and accessories and biker souvenirs , such_as T-shirts and stickers . A permit to sell Harleys is pending approval from the Department of Motor_Vehicles , employees said . The shop ' s unusual location at 335 E . 2nd St. , in the heart of Little Tokyo , has caught the eyes of some customers . &quot; It seemed strange , but interesting , &quot; Howard Gantman , press deputy to Councilwoman Rita Walters , said about his first visit there . &quot; I guess it fits_in that whole theme of selling Americana items to tourists who come_in from Japan. &quot; * Chinatown resident and ex-Harley rider Don Toy dropped_by after some of his biker friends told him about Gem USA . &quot; It ' s kind of weird , &quot; Toy said . &quot; Normally , shops like that would not be in Little Tokyo ' s Japanese Village Plaza. &quot; that ' s true , said Tom Kurai , spokesman for the plaza . Plaza managers had debated whether to take the unprecedented step of renting_out available space to a Harley-Davidson shop in Little Tokyo , Kurai said . &quot; We had visions of Hell ' s Angels coming_down here , &quot; he said . &quot; In Little Tokyo , being a conservative community , we have your old_guard , second-generation ( Japanese ) who ' ve been here 30 to 40 years . What would they think if we opened such a shop ? &quot; Takayama ' s carefree , biker image didn ' t help , either . &quot; When Mr. Takayama first approached us , he looked_like a typical biker -- long hair , jeans and T-shirt , &quot; Kurai said . &quot; We were kind of like wondering what his background was , if he was credible. &quot; In the end , plaza managers reviewed the businessman ' s financial_statements , saw pictures of his two-story Harley dealership in Kyoto and concluded that Gem USA could attract higher-income customers from Downtown to the plaza , he said . Gem USA then took_over space that had been vacated by Magic Radio , which moved across the street . Since its Aug . 7 opening , the shop has attracted an average of 50 customers a day , said sales assistant Willi Chiao . Most have been Japanese tourists , some from other parts of Downtown and only a_few bikers , Chiao said . And despite initial fears among plaza managers , there have been no problems with idle bikers loitering around the shop . * Harley-Davidson products and biker garb have increasingly grown in popularity among the Japanese , said Gem ' s owner , Little Tokyo merchants and residents and motorcycle experts . But , they said , Japanese society doesn ' t perceive bikers and their Harleys the same way Americans have stereotyped them -- as hoodlums and rebels . In fact , a Harley-Davidson is considered a status symbol among some in Japan . &quot; It represents more of the Western culture to them , whereas to us it represents a certain element of our Western culture , &quot; said Keith R . Ball , editor of Easyriders magazine . The San Fernando Valley-based publication ' s Easyriders motorcycle clothing and tattoo shop on Melrose Avenue has also drawn a large_number of Japanese tourists seeking Western memorabilia , Ball said . Some in the motorcycle industry in Japan consider the Harley &quot; king of the motorcycles , &quot; said Brian Kito , who owns a pastry shop in Little Tokyo . &quot; They ' ve seen Charles Bronson reruns . . . so the Harley always has that image of being cool , &quot; Kito said . Though the motorcycle business may be slow , Takayama said he plans to ride it out for six months before reviewing whether to continue with his U.S. investment . &quot; This is beyond business , &quot; he said through an interpreter . &quot; It ' s building a better image of American bikers. &quot;</TEXT>
