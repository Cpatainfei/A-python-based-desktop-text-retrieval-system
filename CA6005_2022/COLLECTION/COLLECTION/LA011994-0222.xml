   <HEADLINE> FIRING BASED ON AGE , EX-MITSUBISHI MANAGER SAYS ; COURTS : BUT PLUMMETING COMPUTER SALES CAUSED THE MAN , NOW 58 , TO BE LAID OFF IN 1990 ALONG WITH 38 OTHERS , AN ATTORNEY FOR THE CYPRESS-BASED U.S. SUBSIDIARY CLAIMS IN OPENING ARGUMENTS OF TRIAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Blaming its ill-fated venture of selling complete computer_systems , Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc. on Tuesday defended itself against a fired manager who sued the Cypress-based company for $ 700 # 000 , claiming age discrimination . George O ' Mary , 58 , accused Japanese-owned Mitsubishi of singling_out older managers when it terminated him and 38 other people as it cut_back its U.S. computer_business in November , 1990 , after massive losses . The former technical support manager is suing for $ 700 # 000 in lost wages and compensation for emotional distress . Attorneys for the company denied the allegations in the opening arguments of a trial that began Tuesday in Superior_Court in Santa Ana . Dirk Bruinsma , O ' Mary ' s lawyer , said that company managers held two meetings in early 1990 in which Japanese executives reportedly told employees that the company planned to eliminate managers over 40 and replace them with &quot; younger , more aggressive managers. &quot; &quot; While it may happen often , it is not often said , &quot; Bruinsma said . &quot; I suppose someone made a critical mistake . . . . Mr. O ' Mary started over and built himself up again while someone else did his job. &quot; Despite what O ' Mary described as promises of lifetime employment at Mitsubishi , the terminations occurred six months later . Of 14 managers fired , 13 were over 40 , Bruinsma said . O ' Mary , a 10-year employee whose salary was $ 100 # 000 a year , was allegedly replaced by a 29-year-old manager . O ' Mary , a Sierra Madre resident who received a $ 78 # 000 severance check , said he hunted for a job for 18 months . He was reduced to selling cemetery plots for $ 100 a month before landing a job as a software engineering trainer for McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach for half his pay at Mitsubishi Electronics . But O ' Mary ' s story regarding the staff cuts , while sympathetic , isn ' t true , said Barclay Edmundson , outside counsel for Mitsubishi Electronics America , a subsidiary of electronics and auto giant Mitsubishi Electric Corp . in Tokyo . He said that although lifetime employment has been a common practice in Japan among young hires , it was never more_than a hope for the company ' s workers in America and therefore was never included in any employment_contracts , including O ' Mary ' s . Also , Edmundson said , the alleged statements of senior executives was hearsay -- the statements were either never made or were misinterpreted . Instead , Edmundson said that Michael Foster , a senior_vice_president of the company , would testify that business reasons were used to determine each person to be let_go . Edmundson said Foster had to cut 30 % of his 144 employees in the Information_Systems Division subsidiary because Mitsubishi had decided to abandon its computer_systems business after accumulating years of losses that totaled $ 65 million . Mitsubishi , which entered the personal_computer market in the United States in 1981 , reached a sales peak of $ 175 million by 1986 , according to Edmundson . During that period , O ' Mary received raises every year and steady promotions to_the_point where he managed a crew of four traveling technicians who helped customers deal with computers and supervised a manager with five technicians . But in 1987 the division lost two major contracts to supply computers to other manufacturers , including Leading Edge Computers , which placed their own brand names on the PCs and resold them . In 1990 , Mitsubishi lost $ 17.5 million on lower sales of about $ 25 million , Edmundson disclosed . Pointing to a chart with red bars representing losses , he told jurors , &quot; No , this bar_chart is not upside down . The losses on these computers were staggering for this company . ( Mitsubishi Electronics ) had to decide to get_out , and that resulted in layoffs. &quot; Mitsubishi ' s computers were consistently inferior in technology and price , Edmundson said . It pulled the plug on computer_system sales in 1990 , deciding instead to focus_on manufacturing components , such_as monitors . Foster decided to cut O ' Mary ' s traveling technical support staff because complete computer_systems would no longer be sold , Edmundson said , adding that the technical staff occupied about two-thirds of O ' Mary ' s work_time . He chose to retain another manager , Kathy Woods , over O ' Mary because she had hands-on experience managing the in-house technical support staff and , though supervised by O ' Mary , had two years more seniority . Woods then began reporting to Ray Roque , 29 , who supervised three other groups of engineers that O ' Mary was not qualified to manage , Edmundson said . He told jurors that 29.5 % of the company ' s staff is 40 or older , compared to 30.4 % before the staff cuts . &quot; That does not suggest a grand scheme for discrimination , &quot; Edmundson said .</TEXT>
