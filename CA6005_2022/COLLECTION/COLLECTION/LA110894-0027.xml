   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW : NOVEL ; LIFE AS A FAILED WRITER AND BOGUS ACADEMIC IN A RITZY ITALIAN VILLA ; THE CLIFF , BY DAVID R . SLAVITT ; LOUISIANA UNIVERSITY PRESS ; $ 21.95 , 154 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> David Slavitt ' s 50th book -- yes , 50th -- is a savage sendup of the literary life , a novel to keep_away from those innocents entering MFA programs who don ' t yet know about things like agents , slush piles , writer ' s block , book tours , bad reviews , university tenure , writers colonies and grants . The premise of &quot; The Cliff &quot; is deceptively hilarious . John Smith is a failed writer taking refuge in teaching at an obscure college . Out of the blue , he receives a letter from The Foundation inviting him to spend some time , all expenses paid , at the legendary Villa Sfondrata in Bellagio , Italy , so he can finish his project on the death of Mussolini in peace and quiet , surrounded by lakes , Alps and fresh air . The letter , however , was meant for the respected historian John Smith , on the other side of campus . This John Smith is more interested in mostaccioli than in Mussolini -- and he ' s about to be sacked by the_English department . He carries the letter around in his pocket for a_few days , fully intending to deliver it to the real John Smith . But time passes . Then the real John Smith has a heart_attack and is attached_to various life-support systems . Our John Smith figures the real John Smith has more important things on his mind -- like staying alive -- than worrying about responding to The Foundation about some grant . So , with no job prospects , no income , soon no place to live and nobody to go visit , John Smith goes_to the Villa Sfondrata pretending he is the John Smith who is writing_about the death of Mussolini . Having seen too many Peter Sellers and Woody Allen movies , I went_into this story fully expecting a sidesplitting escapade of mismatched identities , a silly love_story , lots of slapstick entrances and exits ( maybe a_few guys dressed in gorilla suits ) and a colorful cast of solipsistic , pseudo-intellectual literary characters exchanging witty dialogue . Wrong . &quot; The Cliff , &quot; although smart , doesn ' t turn_out to be quite as hilarious as the premise implies . Slavitt is not so_much telling a story as using his narrative to spoof everything he ' s probably come_across in his distinguished and , let ' s face it , long academic career . He ' s jousting with philosophy and ethics ( &quot; It would be agreeable to go_to the Italian Alps . . . But surely unethical ! Outrageous to take_advantage in that way of someone ' s innocent error . . . . But by now I was thinking what Freud had taught me to think , that there is no such thing as an error &quot; ) . There are some wondrously funny moments . Our brilliant , moody , schlemiel of a narrator , a guy who can ' t even make his rent , is highly critical of the food served at this historic villa . Our John Smith , the impostor , lives in daily terror of being exposed as a fake . His biggest worry are the evenings when the resident musicians , statesmen , poets or scientists discuss their works_in_progress . The guests -- who come and go -- and there are lots of them -- seem amusing enough , like the publisher who twirls , skips and hops down the halls when he thinks he is alone . The problem here is that the characters are described , and Slavitt lets_it_go at that : There they are and well , isn ' t it amusing ? Then one guest disappears . Slavitt ' s now turned it into a mystery , sort of Agatha Christie-style . But as the narrator , and reader , suspects : it ' s hardly_a mystery at all . Slavitt is brilliant and he writes with grace , passion and humor . The narrator ' s sincere attempts to reconcile with his alienated daughter are touching and not at all sentimental . The highlight of the book must be the narrator ' s scathing letter to the manager about the villa ' s terrible service and dismissive treatment of its guests . And there is , inevitably , the ersatz historian John Smith ' s version of the death of Mussolini , a sendup of why the Italians could never win a war : The partisans have captured Il Duce but don ' t know what to do with him . &quot; In Menaggio , however , the phone was out_of_order . They pushed_on farther south to Mezzegra , another tiny village just below Tremezzo , where a prominent partisan chieftain lived , or anyway his mother did , in a farmhouse in the_hills . They figured they could ask him what to do . Or at least to use the phone . Or if not the phone , then the bathroom . . . . &quot; &quot; The Cliff &quot; unfortunately is too self-consciously satirical to pass as a real novel . It is an academic exercise in how the writing life works -- but the book fails , ironically , as fiction .</TEXT>
