   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL REPORT : EXECUTIVE PAY ; FIVE MATTEL EXECUTIVES PROVE THAT TURNAROUND MAKES FAIR PAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mattel Inc. pays its executives well , and it ' s certainly not play money . All of Mattel ' s top five executives ranked in the top 30 of the most highly compensated executives among the state ' s 100 largest public companies -- a record matched by no other company on the list . Leading the way was Joseph C . Gandolfo , president of operations and the fourth-ranking officer of the El Segundo toy maker . His total compensation in 1993 of nearly $ 7.3 million -- more_than Mattel ' s own chief_executive , by virtue of awards of stock_options and stock appreciation rights -- was the fifth-highest of all executives on The Times ' list . The other four officers and their total compensations are John W . Amerman , chairman and chief_executive , $ 7.2 million ( ranking sixth ) ; Jill E . Barad , president and chief operating officer , nearly $ 5.4 million ( 10th ) ; James E . Eskridge , now president of Mattel ' s Fisher-Price unit , $ 4.1 million ( 24th ) , and Lindsey F . Williams , president of Mattel International , $ 3.7 million ( 29th ) . It was those stock_options and stock appreciation rights that made the Mattel executives ' compensation packages so lucrative . Stock analysts say that ' s fitting , given the company ' s excellent performance since Mattel was_on the brink of bankruptcy in 1987 . That year , the company lost more_than $ 90 million and began a plant-closing , product-adjusting restructuring . But in the past five years , &quot; the stock has been a phenomenal performer , &quot; said Laurie Lively Smith , securities analyst at Seidler Cos . in Los Angeles . &quot; Shareholders have made an enormous amount_of_money , and it ' s only right that if management performs well , they should share_in that and be ( given incentives ) to perform equally well in the future. &quot; The incentives are there . Under a long-term incentive plan , which is not included in The Times ' 1993 compensation tables , the executives stand to reap large amounts of Mattel stock , provided certain goals and conditions are met . For Amerman , the long-term plan could be worth $ 5.2 million , for Barad $ 4.1 million and for Eskridge $ 3.4 million . Although it was approved in late 1993 following Mattel ' s merger with Fisher-Price , the shares were not granted until Jan . 1 , and the executives will not be vested in the plan until 1997 . In light of recent history , the goals -- which include matching or bettering shareholder returns of the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 -- seem attainable . The management team at Mattel today is largely responsible_for the company ' s climb to No . 1 among the world ' s toy makers . Led by Amerman , Mattel dumped tangential -- and unsuccessful -- ventures into electronics and publishing , refocusing on its historic strengths , particularly the Barbie and Hot Wheels toy lines . Amerman opened_up what he called the company ' s &quot; tunnel vision. &quot; Barbie , once primarily a fashion_plate , became the center of a universe of products , largely under Barad ' s tutelage . Barbie is the unquestioned all-time champion of toy sales . Through a series of licensing_agreements and acquisitions , Mattel broadened its product_line and customer base ; most notable are its linkup with the Walt Disney Co . and its merger last year with Fisher-Price . Until that acquisition , the stock_market generally had fretted about Mattel ' s dependence on Barbie for revenue and had held_down the company ' s stock price . Now Barbie accounts_for about 40 % of Mattel ' s sales , a figure that is likely to dwindle further as the company puts its international marketing savvy to work_on Fisher-Price products . Although there is no indication that any of the executives were being wooed by other companies , &quot; retention &quot; bonuses were a part of their compensation packages in 1993 , ranging from $ 600 # 000 for Amerman to $ 300 # 000 for Gandolfo . &quot; When you compare Mattel to its peer_group of high-quality consumer non-durables , by probably every financial characteristic it would rank in the top five , &quot; said Margaret B . Whitfield , an analyst who tracks the company for Hancock Institutional Equity Services in Washington . In the past five years , she said , the company ' s earnings have grown 33.9 % , and its average return on equity has been 37.9 % . The stock has been trading_in the mid- $ 20s for most of this year , following a 5-for-4 split . that ' s a sizable improvement from its nadir of less than $ 3 in 1987 . &quot; The thinking of the board is , the stock of the company has risen by almost a factor of 10 over the past six or seven years , and the shareholders ' value has increased about $ 5 billion , &quot; Mattel director Harold Brown said . Brown , defense_secretary during the Carter_Administration , is managing partner of E.M. Warburg , Pincus &amp; Co. , which has owned Mattel shares since it participated in the toy maker ' s 1984 restructuring . Much of the compensation , Brown said , &quot; is dependent upon stock performance . So those who believe -- and I ' m one -- that pay should depend_on performance and be tied closely to the interests of the shareholders should view this as a good_example of compensation. &quot; The calculated value of the Mattel executives ' stock_options and grants is based on a conservative assumption of 5 % annual appreciation of the company ' s stock price throughout the term of the options . ( Although the company did the calculations , as required , for inclusion in its proxy materials , a Mattel spokesman contends that to count such &quot; potential &quot; value as compensation in 1993 is a &quot; misrepresentation. &quot; However , to achieve a 5 % increase in value , a stock would have to perform only half as well as the market ' s average over the past 50 years. )</TEXT>
