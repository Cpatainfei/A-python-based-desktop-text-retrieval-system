   <HEADLINE> ANTIOXIDANTS FAIL TO SLOW CANCER , STUDY FINDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Antioxidant vitamins , often touted as a way to ward_off cancer , fail to prevent the development of precancerous growths in the colon , a study shows . The research is the latest to cast doubt on the popular but largely unproven notion that extra doses of these nutrients provide a shortcut to good_health . Beta carotene and Vitamins_C and E were tested on 864 men and women who had already been treated for colorectal adenomas , polyps that precede cancer . Among the 751 who completed follow-up tests , researchers found no signs that the vitamins had stopped them from getting more colon growths . &quot; A great_deal of money is being spent to market the concept that taking additional vitamins will stop cancer . This particular study does not suggest that , &quot; said one researcher , Dr. John A . Coller of the Lahey Clinic in Burlington , Mass . The study was published in Thursday ' s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine . In April , the journal carried a study showing that Vitamin_E and beta carotene , which is the vegetable form of Vitamin_A , failed to protect smokers from lung_cancer . In fact , that study reached the surprising conclusion that beta carotene was associated with an increased risk of cancer . Those vitamins had seemed to be an especially promising way to attack colon_cancer , although earlier , smaller studies produced conflicting results . People who eat lots of fruits and vegetables are less likely to get colon_cancer . Many assumed that the key was the relatively large amount of antioxidant vitamins in fruits and vegetables . Antioxidants soak_up hazardous oxygen molecules called free_radicals . In the latest study , volunteers were randomly assigned to take dummy pills or daily vitamin supplements . Of that group , 751 underwent colon exams after one year and four years later to check for new adenomas . The doctors found that the vitamins made no difference in the risk of precancerous growths . Of the 113 patients who did not complete the study , 44 died , 32 no longer wished to participate , 19 were too ill or had moved and 18 dropped_out for unknown reasons . Patients who received the vitamins took 25 milligrams of beta carotene , one gram of Vitamin_C , 400 milligrams of Vitamin_E or a combination of the three .</TEXT>
