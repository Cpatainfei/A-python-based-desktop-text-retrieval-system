   <HEADLINE> NOTEBOOK ; NORWEGIANS GIVEN 26 SHINING REASONS TO BE SMILING HOSTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hundreds of thousands of Norwegians celebrated Sunday as the host nation finished the Games with 26 medals , the most by any country . Germany , with its first- and third-place finishes in the four-man bobsled , was second in the medal standings , ahead of Russia , with 24 . Russia finished with 23 but had the most golds , 11 , to 10 for Norway and nine for Germany . The United States finished tied for fifth with Canada with 13 , behind Italy , which had 20 . It was the United States ' best performance at a Winter Games . Six of the U.S. medals were gold , two by speedskater Bonnie Blair , and one each by speedskaters Cathy Turner and Dan Jansen , and Alpine skiers Diann Roffe-Steinrotter and Tommy Moe . * Paul Kariya , you ' ve just won an Olympic silver medal . What are you doing next ? Um , he ' s not going_to Disney ' s Mighty Ducks . Not yet , anyway . Kariya of the Canadian hockey_team says he hasn ' t made a final_decision yet , though even the Ducks expect him to return to Maine for the rest of this season . He was selected fourth by the Ducks in last year ' s NHL draft . Duck General_Manager Jack Ferreira said last week he believes Kariya will return to the University of Maine , where Kariya won the Hobey Baker Award last season as the best player in college hockey , but Kariya offered no hints Sunday . &quot; I ' m going_to Boston to see my girlfriend and I ' m going_to relax , &quot; he said . &quot; I really haven ' t made a decision yet . . . . I ' m just exhausted . I have no energy left . I have nothing left to give. &quot; Kariya played double shifts in Canada ' s last three games , after wing Todd Warriner suffered a knee injury . He blossomed during the extra playing time -- he had about 25 minutes Sunday , including more_than 10 in the third_period -- and got stronger as the tournament progressed . Kariya scored Canada ' s first goal Sunday , at 9:08 of the third_period , and finished with a team-high seven points , on three goals and four assists . &quot; One of the biggest things here I ' ve learned is I have a long way to go_to be the type of player I want to be , &quot; he said . &quot; There are a lot of great players here , and I learned from them. &quot; * Swedish defenseman Tomas Jonsson joins teammates Hakan Loob and Mats Naslund as the only players to win a Stanley Cup , a world championship and an Olympic gold medal . * Viktor Tikhonov coached some of the Soviet_Union ' s greatest hockey_teams , but his Olympic finale was less than glorious . Tikhonov , who has coached the Soviets , Unified Team and Russians since 1978 , apparently coached his last game Saturday in Russia ' s 4-0 shutout loss to Finland in the bronze-medal game . It was the first time since the Soviets began playing in the Olympic hockey tournament that a Soviet or Russian team failed to win a medal . Information on Tikhonov is sketchy , but journalists from Russia say his contract expires March 15 and will not be renewed . They said Boris Mikhailov , a former Soviet player , will coach the Russian team at the World Championships in April , to be held_in Italy . &quot; I don ' t know if it ' s possible to love him or not , but the history of world hockey is connected with his name , &quot; said Tikhonov ' s assistant , Igor Dmitriev . Tikhonov , 64 , had promised to attend Saturday ' s postgame news_conference , but backed_out . Dmitriev gave no explanation for that , but talked at length about his team ' s disappointing performance and the depleted state of Russia ' s hockey reserves . More_than 50 players from the former Soviet_Union have left to play in the NHL and European leagues , and the program has been battered by poor economic_conditions in Russia and a power struggle in the hockey federation . * Eight players from the silver-medal Canadian Olympic team will rejoin their NHL clubs after the Games . Returning to the NHL are David Harlock with Toronto , Corey Hirsch and Jean Yves Roy with the New York Rangers , Greg Johnson with Detroit , Dwayne Norris and Todd Warriner with Quebec , Brian Savage with Montreal , Brad Schlegel with Calgary , and Brad Werenka with Edmonton .
