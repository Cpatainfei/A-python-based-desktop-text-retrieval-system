HE SAYS HE FINDS MORE HAPPINESS THAN MONEY IN FULFILLING WHAT HE SEES AS HIS OBLIGATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Southern California office of Legal Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers ( LAVAS ) is almost in visible , tucked into a far back corner of a two-story Bolsa Avenue strip mall on the edge of Little Saigon . It is spare and cluttered , decorated only with posters extolling human_rights and postcards painted by Vietnamese refugees living_in detention camps throughout Asia . It is a hot Sunday , and Lan Quoc Nguyen is getting ready to settle in_for a typical day ' s work . Throughout the day Nguyen , the supervising attorney for the office , and his staff will continue the often frustrating and labyrinthine job of reviewing case after case of Vietnamese refugees being held_in the camps who want desperately to find asylum in a country -- any country -- other_than Vietnam . Nguyen , 30 , says he does_it because , as a former refugee who escaped_from Vietnam with his family in a boat and who spent time in a detention camp in Malaysia , he feels it is his moral_obligation . A general practice attorney with an office in Tustin , Nguyen says he puts_in between 30 and 40 hours a week , evenings and weekends , at the LAVAS office doing free legal work . He puts_in even more unpaid hours each week on a series of radio and television_shows broadcast locally to the Orange County Vietnamese-speaking population on Little Saigon Radio and Television . On both programs , he presents legal advice on a variety of subjects from property law to traffic violations , all tailored for an audience faced with the task of sorting_out unfamiliar federal and state laws . There is no sense that Nguyen is a careerist . His ground_floor Tustin law office is small , neat and functional , but hardly the sort of legal sanctum designed to impress or intimidate . He dresses cleanly , but without flash . His passions are genuine , but he has lived with them for so_long -- through years of_his_own persecution and confinement in an Asian camp -- that he speaks_of them in matter-of-fact tones , with conviction but without missionary zeal . He can tell of squalor and suicide in the detention camps with controlled force , but there are no theatrics . Nguyen may be the most visible and best-known Vietnamese attorney in Orange County , familiar particularly to his own countrymen and women . But as a result of all his high-profile pro bono work in the Vietnamese community ( as well as the fact that he follows Vietnamese tradition by living with and supporting his elderly parents in Westminster ) , Nguyen says -- smiling -- that he is &quot; barely making_it . But I ' m happy . that ' s more important . I spend long hours , but I think it ' s worth it . I do feel I have an obligation to the community to do this. &quot; By the time he turned 14 , life in Saigon had become intolerable for Nguyen and his family . It was 1979 , and Nguyen ' s teacher father and his oldest brother , a former soldier , were both interned in &quot; re-education camps. &quot; &quot; Security was tight in the Vietnamese government at the time , and persecution was rampant , &quot; Nguyen says . &quot; Any intellectual family couldn ' t do anything , and we had a black mark on our history because of ( supposed political activities ) by other members of the family already . We were always under surveillance by the authorities. &quot; The family planned escape by boat , but time and time again the attempts failed . &quot; You had to do everything secretly , &quot; Nguyen says . &quot; Get a boat , find petroleum , get food and water , find people you could really trust . Some of the people would just rip you off and run , and you couldn ' t go_to the police. &quot; Seven times the plans went awry before the Nguyens could even get_to a boat . Family members were turned_in to authorities , jailed and later released . Finally , on the eighth try , the Nguyen family of seven boys and their mother sailed away on a small_boat with several other families . During seven days at_sea , the boat ran_out of fuel and its passengers ran_out of water before taking_on other refugees from a smaller_boat that had an abundance of both . After weathering a fierce storm , the boat finally landed at Malaysia , and the Nguyen family was immediately processed into a detention camp at its port_of_entry , where the family lived for 10 months . Next , they were transferred to a transit camp in Kuala Lampur for two months and from there emigrated to the United States in 1979 , where they were sponsored by a family in Orange County . Nguyen ' s father was eventually released in 1990 from his camp in Vietnam ( the oldest brother escaped with the rest of the family ) , but the government refused to allow him to join his family in the United States . Finally , &quot; he got a tourist visa to East_Germany right about the time the Berlin Wall came_down , &quot; Nguyen says , &quot; and when he arrived there he crossed into West_Berlin , went_to the nearest American embassy there and applied for asylum . &quot; When I passed the bar , he was my first client . I was scared to death , because if I lost that case I didn ' t know what I was going_to do. &quot; Nguyen , who was graduated from Hastings Law_School in San Francisco , won his father ' s case , and , when the family was reunited in the United States , Nguyen says he felt he was finally free to &quot; work fully on behalf of refugees without worrying about retaliation against ( my family ) by the Vietnamese government. &quot; Nguyen ' s experience as a boat person and a refugee interned in a detention camp &quot; is what I think drives him , &quot; says Van Tran , who works with Nguyen at LAVAS . &quot; He ' s seen as very committed , a very bright attorney who has a deep concern for the welfare of the refugees -- his own people -- as well as the community welfare . &quot; Lan is a person with a conscience , and that ' s what I find appealing about him . He doesn ' t forget his roots as a boat person . He ' s definitely one of the key members of the future generation of Vietnamese Americans in this community , and we can expect him to contribute more as the years go by. &quot; Tony Lam , mayor pro_tem of Westminster and the first Vietnamese American to be elected to a public office in the United States , called the amount_of_time that Nguyen spends in free legal work for refugees &quot; amazing . He could be making a much better living at ( his practice ) , but he spends so_much time at LAVAS . I really credit him for that . He has a lot of passion and compassion . He ' s already earned the respect and affection of the community here. &quot; The need for such advocacy , Nguyen says , is more urgent now than ever . The asylum-seekers , he says , would almost surely face persecution in Vietnam as political undesirables . And , he adds , because of a deadline agreed upon by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the U.N. member nations , the camps likely will close at the end of this year , and thousands of refugees may face forced repatriation to Vietnam . Hunger_strikes in the camps in protest of the policy are common , he says . Some refugees , believing themselves beyond hope , have resorted_to self-immolation , hanging or poisoning as a dramatization of their plight . &quot; Many of them would rather die than return to Vietnam , &quot; Nguyen says . &quot; Legal abuse over there is so rampant . Under international_law , they ' re no longer recognized as official refugees . It ' s an unfair rejection of their refugee status . So it ' s not really an immigration problem now ; it ' s a human_rights problem . that ' s where we come in. &quot; The work often obliges Nguyen to confront massive and sometimes impenetrable bureaucracies . From the LAVAS office in Westminster ( the national office is in Virginia ) , Nguyen and his staff are working_on about 230 cases involving camp inmates in Asia who have relatives in Orange County . Local LAVAS office estimates of the total number of inmates in the Asian camps hover around 50 # 000 . &quot; Essentially , &quot; Nguyen says , &quot; we work_on a specific person , but along the way we also engage in some ( general ) advocacy to some extent , speak out on the part of refugees and asylum-seekers. &quot; The process most often begins , he says , when a relative or friend of someone in the camps brings a file of data collected about that person to the LAVAS office and asks_for help in getting that person out . &quot; Communications between here and the camps are difficult , &quot; Nguyen says , &quot; and some people we can ' t contact at all . We have a case where we don ' t know what a person looks_like , and we can ' t talk to them . We do what we can , though , and take their word on the basis of the papers they have , or talk to their relatives or associates here , people or activists who might be able to verify the information. &quot; If Nguyen determines that a case has promise , appeals_to grant refugee status for the asylum-seeker are filed either with a reviewing board in the country in which the camp is located , or with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees , or with the U.S. State_Department , depending_on how far previous appeals have gotten . &quot; Once they are granted refugee status , a lot of times we never see them again , since the United States may or may_not be their No . 1 choice , &quot; Nguyen says . &quot; They are seeking protection from persecution in Vietnam ; they want to get_out of the camp where they are now , and they will go anywhere they can get sponsored , any country that will accept them . &quot; It is frustrating work because you have a situation where some country will take_in the person and the relative will sponsor them , but the local country will refuse to let them go , refuse to process their papers , even refuse to let us talk to them. &quot; The cases that Nguyen and his associates take_on have already been rejected by one authority or another at least once . Their success record , however , is good . Hard percentages , listed by camp , don ' t accurately reflect that success , says Nguyen -- about 80 % of the cases they take_on in the camp in Hong Kong are won and about 45 % in the Philippines camp -- because some authorities are easier to work with than others , and circumstances often vary by country . To see for himself , Nguyen traveled at his own expense to the Philippine detention camp known as Palawan in 1992 . Working with international volunteers there , he began processing cases from the day of his arrival , often working outdoors in stiflingly hot and humid weather . He says he found the camp conditions deteriorating . &quot; Palawan is one of the best camps in the region , &quot; says Nguyen , &quot; but the living conditions are still very difficult . Families live_in a very small space : 12 feet square for a family of three or four , with all_the facilities there . They cook there , and much of the food is rotten . All communications with the outside world are censored . There ' s no work , and people have nothing to do. &quot; To worsen matters , the U.N. high commission and the governments operating the camps &quot; imposed things that made life difficult for them , &quot; Nguyen says . &quot; They had been trying to implement what they called a voluntary repatriation program , but it didn ' t go well , so they made life difficult ( in an attempt to force the refugees to return to their home countries ) . They cut_out all information and material coming_in or out of camp , cut_out all overseas remittance from relatives . &quot; We try to tell them that it ' s against the U.N. Charter , that it ' s a human_rights issue . We yell , keep_up the fight as best we can and never give_up . If we give_up now , we lose. &quot; It is Wednesday morning , and Nguyen is a half hour from leaving for Long_Beach , where he is_due in court . At the moment , however , he is wedged into a corner of a tiny studio at the offices of Little Saigon Radio and Television in Santa Ana . It is his weekly , morning call-in show from 9:30 to 10 on KWIZ ( 96.7 FM ) , during which he answers questions from listeners -- he usually gets_about 20 calls -- on matters legal . The show is conducted entirely in Vietnamese , and today ' s topic is how property_taxes are assessed . &quot; I ' m going_to be talking_about how people can apply for a reduction on their property_taxes , &quot; he says . &quot; A lot of people don ' t know they can do that . Next week I ' m going_to talk_about what to do if people get stopped for a DUI. &quot; He gets no pay_for the radio show , or for the 15-minute legal advice television spot he does for Little Saigon Radio and Television every_other Tuesday at 6:10 p.m. on KRCA Channel 62 . But the staff at the station says that in the approximately eight months since the shows began , his programs have become among the most popular in their lineup . &quot; I find his programs very , very educational , &quot; says co-worker Tran . &quot; It ' s probably the first time , in a major way , that segments providing free legal advice by an accredited attorney are going_on the air on a weekly basis . There ' s a great need for that in our community because we ' re very young ; many of us are newly arrived , and we may be intimidated by the legal_system here. &quot; Diem Do , who hosts shows on Little Saigon Radio and Television that deal with youth and human_rights issues , says he and Nguyen often exchange ideas about their programs and occasionally appear together . Like many local Vietnamese people , Nguyen &quot; came a long way , &quot; Do says . &quot; He came_with nothing , had lost everything , came_to a strange land not knowing the language , being_on the bottom of society , having to fight his way up . He has a lot of good ideas , and he ' s a man with a good heart . I think what he ' s been through helps him relate better to a lot of people. &quot; Nguyen calls his time in the broadcast booth &quot; very fun . And it makes me do research . I can ' t just get a lot of this stuff off the top of my head . It helps me learn. &quot; That thirst_for_knowledge , and the passion to put it to use , drove Nguyen even before his arrival in Orange County , poor and with a limited command of English . In fact , one of the first acts_on his arrival was to enroll at Garden Grove ' s Bolsa Grande High_School , where he graduated in 1983 . &quot; When I was in the camp , &quot; he says , &quot; I always had a desire to become one of those people who helped . It ' s very emotional for a boat person to return to a camp and do that . During my time in the camp , my education was still in my mind . And when I was in law_school , I did research in international_law . The refugees were my major concern. &quot; And likely will continue to be . Nguyen says that &quot; the refugee situation won ' t be over by the end of the year . Even though they say they ' re closing the camps , there may be some people still there . So we ' ll continue to work. &quot; And Nguyen will continue to divide his time . &quot; The guy ' s really intelligent , &quot; says Do , &quot; and he could be really successful in his ( private law_practice ) , but he diverts his time and energy to so many other things . He ' s managed to find the time to do that . Money is not the only thing in his life . &quot; I think all that he gives_back to the community is what really enriches his life. &quot; Profile : Lan Quoc Nguyen Age : 30 Background : Born and raised in Saigon .

My mother and my brothers went_through a lot , but we didn ' t know what he went_through during those years . We had to fill each other in . It took a long_time to get used to it. &quot; On the projected closing of Asian refugee camps : &quot; I don ' t think the refugee issue will be over by the end of the year . Even though they ' re closing the camps , there may be some people still there . So we ' ll continue to work. &quot;</TEXT>
