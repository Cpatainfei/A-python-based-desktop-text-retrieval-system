   <HEADLINE> U.S. LEPROSY TREATMENT CENTER TURNS 100 ; MEDICINE : HOSPITAL DEVOTED SOLELY TO HANSEN ' S DISEASE IS ONE OF THE WORLD ' S LEADING RESEARCH FACILITIES . ON CENTENNIAL , IT ' S HAILED AS ' STUNNING SUCCESS STORY. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One hundred years ago today , five men and two women were secretly transported by barge up the Mississippi_River to an abandoned Louisiana plantation . The seven were suffering from leprosy , one of the most feared and loathed conditions of the time . And the plantation was to become the one hospital in the United States devoted solely to treating the disease and to offering a long-term sanctuary to its patients . Today , Hansen ' s disease -- as it is now known -- can be treated and cured , and the once powerful stigma associated with it has been substantially diminished . Only about 130 patients -- most of them elderly , with no place else to go -- still call the center their home and a mere 6 # 000 patients in the United States are affected by the disease . Nevertheless , the century-old facility in Carville , La. , which is run_by the U.S. Public Health Service ' s Health Resources and Services Administration , is suddenly enjoying renewed attention because of its age-old research techniques . The knowledge gained from studying and treating Hansen ' s disease , which is caused by a bacterium , now appears to have widespread application to other illnesses , including diabetes and tuberculosis . Federal health officials have called the work of the center a &quot; stunning success story &quot; in the public health arena . Renamed the Gillis W . Long Hansen ' s Disease Center in 1985 after the congressman who helped keep it open , the facility celebrates its centennial this week . Thursday and Friday , experts from around the world are scheduled to commemorate the anniversary with a meeting in Baton_Rouge to share the latest research information on Hansen ' s disease . &quot; Since the discovery for a clinical cure for Hansen ' s disease . . . the center has become one of the world ' s leading international research_centers and now contributes to progress in the treatment of other diseases , &quot; said Dr. Philip R . Lee , assistant Health and Human Services secretary and head of the U.S. Public Health Service . Hansen ' s disease is an infectious condition that affects the skin , nerves and eyes . If left untreated , it can lead to muscle deformity , bone infection , loss of sensation in extremities -- sometimes even paralysis -- and blindness . Although an estimated 2.4 million persons worldwide have the disease , last year for the first time the incidence of new cases began to drop and the World_Health_Organization is hopeful that Hansen ' s will be under_control by the year 2000 . It is not considered life-threatening , although serious cases can cause major deformities , which are permanent . Lack of sensation in_hands and feet , for example , can result in neglect of repeated injuries to those areas of the body , leading to infections and , ultimately , to bone destruction . Hansen ' s is treated with a combination of two or three antibiotics for different periods_of_time , depending_on its severity . The first drugs to treat it were identified in 1941 , marking &quot; the beginning of the end to the agonizing stigmatization surrounding this condition , &quot; said Dr. Ciro Sumaya , Health Resources and Services administrator . &quot; Patients no longer would have to enter an isolated world. &quot; Dr. Robert Jacobson , director of the center , said the disease can be treated and cured but &quot; damage caused by the disease will remain . Nowadays , when the diagnosis is made earlier , we ' re seeing less deformities than in the past. &quot; It is considered &quot; mildly &quot; infectious because &quot; 95 % of the population does not appear to be susceptible to it , &quot; Jacobson said . &quot; Those who get_it seem to have a defect in their immune_response , &quot; which could be inherited . Although its exact mode of transmission has never been confirmed , Hansen ' s is believed to be passed_through the respiratory_system by coughing and inhalation . Because the bacterial agent that causes Hansen ' s ( Mycobacterium_leprae ) is so closely related to the one responsible_for tuberculosis ( Mycobacterium_tuberculosis ) , researchers at the Carville facility increasingly have been called_upon to apply their expertise to combatting TB .</TEXT>
