   <HEADLINE> FAMALARO ' S SISTER WONDERS ' WHERE IT STARTED ' ; CRIME : ONLY QUESTIONING OF ACCUSED KILLER OF DENISE HUBER YIELDED FEW CLUES . HE IMMEDIATELY ASKED FOR LAWYER WHEN THE MURDER WAS MENTIONED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Looking haggard but struggling to remain composed , John J . Famalaro ' s voice quavered only once when an investigator asked him to explain why his freezer contained the corpse of a young Newport Beach woman who had been beaten , striped naked and handcuffed . &quot; After , after you ' ve read me my rights I think I want to talk to an attorney , &quot; Famalaro said softly . &quot; I just want to go see my attorney , please. &quot; A videotape of that interview shortly after his July 13 arrest , released Thursday , shows the 37-year-old murder_suspect fidgeted in his chair when faced with the evidence , and then requesting his attorney when the murder of 23-year-old Denise Huber was raised . Lt . Scott Mascher of the Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Department abandoned his questioning of the house_painter and handyman , who sat in the corner of a dimly lit interrogation room , his legs stretched_out in front of him . The interview lasted only a_few minutes . It was the first and last time that Famalaro has talked to the detectives trying to unravel why someone might tote a frozen body across the west for more_than three years . He remains in an Arizona jail_cell , but may be extradited to Orange County for trial as soon as next week . Taped interviews with Famalaro ' s sister and former brother-in-law offered a_few more clues , revealing the former Lake Forest resident ' s troubled upbringing and adult life . Famalaro ' s sister , Marion Thobe , told investigators she has struggled to understand why both her brothers have been accused of such twisted acts . Warren Famalaro , a former chiropractor , served time in prison for molesting two young patients . &quot; I don ' t know where it started , &quot; Thobe , 40 , of Prescott , told investigators . She seemed to lay at least some of the blame on her mother , Anna Mae Famalaro . She said she and her brothers were raised in an unhealthy , repressive environment where they were verbally abused , beaten with belts and forbidden to talk_about sex , maturing or even pregnancy . &quot; It wasn ' t a normal household , &quot; Thobe said . &quot; She would go_out to other people and say , ' Look_at my three wonderful children. ' But in the house we were ( expletive ) , &quot; she said . She described her father as a kind &quot; Christian &quot; man but said her mother took religion to an extreme that bordered_on fanaticism . Anna Famalaro was not tolerant of her children ' s antics and would often react with violence . &quot; She ' s an odd duck , &quot; Thobe said . &quot; She was pretty physical . My dad wasn ' t . She would use a belt . . . . She had a short fuse , you know . The tolerance wasn ' t there. &quot; When interviewed by detectives , Marion Thobe ' s former husband , a one-time Iowa police_officer , also talked_about Anna Mae Famalaro : &quot; All I know , all I can say is what I experienced myself with the mother . In the 15 years I was part of that family , the mother is very controlling -- very dominating and -- you don ' t do things her way , she gets mad , &quot; said Duane Thobe . &quot; The mother , I can just imagine how awful it must have been growing_up with her. &quot; Duane Thobe described a telephone_conversation Famalaro had with Marion shortly after his arrest . &quot; Marion said there wasn ' t much of a conversation and all he did was cry . He said , ' Do you hate me ? Do you ever want to see me again ? ' . . . He just cried the whole time. &quot; Those who knew the Famalaros report that Anna Famalaro would cover John Famalaro ' s eyes in the movie_theater if the actors so_much as kissed , even when her son was in his late teens . Neighbors say Anna Famalaro tried to discourage her son from dating , and never seemed satisfied with any of his female friends . &quot; It ' s amazing the impact one person can have_on a family , just amazing , &quot; Marion Thobe continued . &quot; This isn ' t a pretty story. &quot; &quot; She followed ( John ) on a date once , &quot; she later added . &quot; . . . To make_sure he didn ' t do anything wrong. &quot; Marion Thobe told investigators her mother also interfered with her marriage , telling her son-in-law that his wife could not be trusted . Her mother , she said , thought she was cheating on her husband because she attended exercise classes regularly and dressed fashionably when she went_out . Investigators asked Marion Thobe why she moved next door to her mother at the Prescott Country_Club given their mother ' s overbearing nature . Marion Thobe said she hoped her mother would have &quot; mellowed &quot; over the years , but upon returning found that she remained cold and aloof . After the Thobes divorced and moved_out , Famalaro moved_into the home where Huber ' s body would later be found . In an interview last month , Anna Famalaro said she was hurt by the harsh portrait that others have painted of her . She described herself as a conservative Christian who was being unfairly blasted as a domineering mother . * Famalaro ' s upbringing could become key during the murder trial , especially if defense_attorneys chart an &quot; insanity &quot; defense or argue that the bizarre upbringing manifested itself in violent acts . Huber ' s body was found in a freezer inside a stolen rental truck parked in the driveway of a home owned by Duane Thobe , Marion Thobe ' s ex-husband . Famalaro was living_in a home is in a country_club community in Dewey , Ariz . Huber ' s belongings were found in the garage in a box marked &quot; Christmas. &quot; Investigators asked Duane Thobe his whereabouts when Denise Huber disappeared , and he told police he was dealing with his own failing marriage at the time . Duane Thobe told investigators he helped Famalaro move several times , including into the Laguna Hills warehouse where authorities believe Huber was murdered . But Duane Thobe stressed he never saw the freezer . &quot; I never saw a freezer . Never saw a freezer , &quot; he said . &quot; I never moved a freezer . It wasn ' t at the warehouse . . . . I ' d swear to it. &quot; Famalaro faces the death_penalty if convicted of kidnaping and murdering Huber , a young waitress who vanished in June , 1991 , after tire blew_out on her car on the Corona Del Mar Freeway as she was driving_home from a rock_concert . Orange County investigators suspect that Famalaro abducted Huber from the freeway and then took her to a Laguna Hills warehouse where he was living and bludgeoned her to death . Even three years after her disappearance , detectives allege they have found traces of blood in the warehouse . Medical tests are pending to determine whether Huber was sexually molested . Famalaro is expected to waive extradition Monday and be transferred from Arizona to the Orange County Men ' s Jail later in the week , Deputy Public_Defender Leonard Gumlia said Thursday . Times staff writer Greg Hernandez and correspondent Shelby Grad contributed to this report .</TEXT>
