   <HEADLINE> GREEN INC. ; ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IS CHAMPIONED , BUT SMALL AREA BUSINESSES SAY THEY ' RE NOT CLEANING_UP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If business success were a popularity_contest , environmental technology would be a leading index . The industry is trumpeted by the_likes_of Vice_President Al Gore and Gov . Pete Wilson . Its growth seems inevitable , and few would quibble with its aims -- it ' s not every industry that can claim it ' s out_to save the planet . But for local companies , the reality doesn ' t quite match the hype . Turning environmental technology into a new , green engine for job growth in California is tougher than it looks . In fact , &quot; we are hampered tremendously by being here , &quot; contends Inderjit Sabherwal , president of the toxic-waste cleanup firm Ensotech Inc. in Sun Valley . Sabherwal said that due mostly to frustration with state regulations governing soil and water cleanup , he is considering moving his 20-year-old business out of California . The San Fernando Valley area has scores of environmental businesses -- those that prevent , detect , monitor and clean_up pollution , or offer green alternatives to activities that harm the environment . Thanks to strict pollution laws and armies of unemployed engineers , Los Angeles is home to the nation ' s second-biggest concentration of environmental-technology companies in the country . For many of those companies , however , the going is tough . Although a_few giant concerns , such_as Lockheed Corp . and Rockwell International ' s Rocketdyne unit , have gotten_into the environmental-technology race , most of the companies in this evolving industry are small . Their expansion is limited by an array of obstacles . Lack of capital , increased competition , inconsistent enforcement of environmental laws and cumbersome state and local regulations governing cleanup are among the most common gripes . The recession has also taken a toll . Sabherwal , for example , said his company was doing annual sales of $ 5 million and had a staff of 60 five years ago . Today , sales have diminished to $ 4 million , and his staff has dropped to about 30 . He blames the local recession in part . But he also said the state is slower than it used to be in pressing companies to clean_up toxic_waste . Michael Uziel of Enviropro Inc. , a Chatsworth firm specializing in hazardous-waste cleanup with revenues of $ 3 million per year , says sales have fallen_off in the last three years . He says that the Clinton presidency and state programs aimed at fostering the industry have been of little help to him . And Owen W . Dykema , a 65-year-old former Rocketdyne engineer who has spent the last 15 years honing his invention for burning coal without producing acid_rain , is just about out of money . He ' s still searching for that elusive investor he needs to bring his product to market . * But many of these companies are particularly rankled about regulatory problems . Common themes are the slow pace of state approvals for cleanup and excessive testing requirements . Before a company such_as Ensotech can remove and treat , say , dirt tainted with lead , complicated negotiations over the extent of contamination , and the best way to deal with it , must be completed with the agency in_charge -- usually the state_Department of Toxic Substances Control or regional water quality boards . Local fire_departments , water districts or county health departments often have to sign_off on the project as well . Sabherwal tells the story of his company ' s efforts to dispose_of piles of dirt contaminated with oil , scraped from lands owned by a San Diego public agency . After more_than a year of negotiations , Sabherwal was unable to settle_on a plan for disposing_of the dirt that was acceptable to his client and the Department of Toxic Substances Control . The client finally loaded the soil on a train bound for a landfill in Utah , where hazardous-waste statutes aren ' t as tough . James M . Strock , secretary of environmental protection for the state , said enforcement of state regulations has been steady . But he acknowledged problems with cleanup approvals . &quot; In California , we have the highest environmental standards in the world . But we also have one of the most convoluted permitting systems. &quot; Another reason why many companies are having trouble is that , as their industry has matured , market growth has tapered_off . At the same time , competition from a growing number of firms in the business has increased . * The competitive atmosphere has created an arms race of innovation , as companies struggle to meet client demands for cheaper and quicker ways to clean waste . But they run_into roadblocks because they lack the capital needed to develop and market new products . Uziel , for instance , has spent $ 350 # 000 developing a method of cleaning tainted soil by shooting microwaves through it . He thinks the device could drastically cut costs of cleaning_up petroleum and other toxins . But he must find a partner to sell it because he can ' t afford the $ 3 million he says it would cost to market it himself . Sabherwal has spent $ 1.5 million of_his_own money developing a method for treating soil with heat . &quot; I haven ' t gotten one cent from a government_agency , and the banks won ' t lend you anything. &quot; One reason few investors will take_a_chance on environmental technology -- especially if it ' s related to soil and ground-water cleanup -- is that cleanup is considered risky because it ' s subject_to government regulation , said Don Hichens , general partner with Liberty Environmental Partners . San Francisco-based Liberty is one of only about a half_dozen venture_capital firms in the country that specialize in funding environmental technology . Air-pollution technology has been somewhat more successful in drawing investment because of California ' s long track record with strict air_pollution standards , ample room for innovation and support from government_agencies . For the most part , investors prefer putting their money behind market-driven pollution products such_as recycling and prevention technology , Hichens said . An example of preventive technology is Rocketdyne ' s new $ 1.3-million aqueous cleaning facility , scheduled to open at the Rockwell International division ' s Canoga Park site in November . That facility uses ultrasound waves , rather than polluting solvents , to remove grime from engine parts . Rocketdyne is also developing environmental products to market . Still , innovation is more likely to come from small start-up firms than from big defense companies or engineering / remediation firms , said Hichens . And there are plenty such companies around . Take Dykema , the former Rocketdyne engineer with an invention for burning coal without producing acid_rain . Working from a tiny office in his West Hills home , he spends his days hunting for a foreign partner with the means to test and market his technology . His idea , first developed at Rocketdyne , is to smolder the coal in a fuel-rich chamber prior to burning . The gas mix and temperature are manipulated so that polluting compounds such_as sulfur form a solid . The remaining coal is relatively sulfur-free and can be burned without releasing the chemical into the air , he claims . Dykema ' s plan requires a $ 30-million retrofit of 17-story coal-burning plants . Although a small-scale prototype of such a boiler has been built , the method has never been tested in a full-sized utility plant , Dykema said . With just $ 10 # 000 left in his company ' s bank_account , Dykema says if he doesn ' t find a partner he ' ll give_up the effort by year ' s end . What the environmental industry &quot; really excels_at is getting_to the point where I am , &quot; he said . &quot; Where we really fall_down is getting from here to the market. &quot; Same goes_for Randy Cook , a San Fernando car shop owner and environmental entrepreneur . His idea is a spill-containment kit for diesel trucks that consists_of a_few folding booms , oil-absorbing mats and a pot of sticky clay for plugging leaks -- all neatly packed in a plastic bag . Cook claims it ' s a cheap and practical solution to the common problem of roadside diesel_fuel spills . For $ 49.95 , he says , truckers could use his system to control fuel-tank leaks instead of waiting for the fire_department to come . But few firms are buying_it . Although Cook has managed to sell some kits to industrial shops , his dream of marketing them on a wide scale to trucking firms hasn ' t materialized , and he ' s frustrated that no one in government will act_on his argument that spill-containment kits for truckers should be mandatory . &quot; I have no help . I ' m just going door to door , knocking_on doors , &quot; Cook complained . &quot; I don ' t understand it . This will save thousands of dollars. &quot; Despite the problems , there are signs environmental technology has turned a corner . Banks and insurance_companies are leaning_on companies to keep their environmental record clean , further spurring the market for environmental technology . Nationally , a handful of innovative environmental companies sold stock to the public for the first time last year , a milestone that some believe will encourage more investment in the industry . Strock , the California environmental secretary , said regulatory reform is one goal of the state ' s newly formed Environmental Technology Partnership , a task_force of state and industry leaders charged with nurturing the state ' s $ 20-billion environmental technology industry . The task_force is reviewing regulations statewide and is seeking to speed_up the pace of permits . The state also recently began an environmental technology certification program in the hope that &quot; certified &quot; technology will encounter fewer regulatory barriers and attract more investment to the industry . A similar effort is being carried_out on the federal level . In July , the White_House released a glossy 150-page report that outlined its strategy for regulatory changes , and educational and export programs to stimulate the market for environmental technology . And the federal Environmental Protection Agency has doled_out $ 36 million in grants for environmental technology projects . New state programs to encourage the industry are also getting under way : an environmental technology &quot; incubator &quot; funded by local_government and donations is scheduled to open in Thousand Oaks this fall . About 20 start-up firms have already applied for office space and technical assistance it will offer . Uziel , the CEO of Enviropro , says the growth of the industry can ' t come too soon to solve the nation ' s huge environmental problems . &quot; Whatever you have heard and read , &quot; he warns , &quot; it ' s worse out there. &quot;</TEXT>
