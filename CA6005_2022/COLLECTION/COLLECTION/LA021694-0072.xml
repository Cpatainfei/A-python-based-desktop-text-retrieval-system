   <HEADLINE> STATE HIGH_COURT REFUSES TO STOP MEDFLY SPRAYING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Supreme Court cleared the way Tuesday for the aerial spraying of the Medfly-killing insecticide malathion over an 18-square-mile area of Corona and Norco later that night . Weather_conditions seemed ideal for the 3 1 / 2-hour flyovers , in which droplets of malathion-laced corn_syrup were to be spewed over residential neighborhoods , businesses , parks and farms by three helicopters flying at 400 feet . Another desperate appeal by the city of Corona -- filed Tuesday in Riverside Superior_Court and claiming that the state ' s public notification of the spraying was illegally broad -- failed to stop the spraying . Judge Victor Miceli immediately rejected the appeal . So Corona city officials , for 4 in legal attempts to stop the aerial spraying and unable to win a last-minute reprieve from Gov . Pete Wilson , said they are preparing to sue the state for damages . &quot; It will cost us $ 100 # 000 or better to send crews out_to hose_down the parks and schools , &quot; complained Corona Councilman Jeff Bennett . &quot; I ' m advising every resident to file a damage claim against the state . This is . . . wrong. &quot; State agricultural officials said the unpopular aerial spraying is necessary to stop the insidious march of the Medfly into rich farmlands , jeopardizing the state ' s $ 18-billion agricultural industry . Japan and other export markets have threatened to boycott California citrus and other vulnerable crops if the infestation spreads . Before Tuesday , Corona officials had lost two lower court battles to stop the spraying , unsuccessfully claiming that the state failed to abide_by its own environmental laws by not studying the long-term health effects of the garden variety insecticide , and that Wilson technically erred in declaring a state emergency because of the pest . But Wilson refused to ground the helicopters . The Superior_Court judge said he would not challenge the governor ' s decision and ruled that malathion was safe . An appellate_court agreed , and added that the need for the eradication is obvious . The state Supreme Court on Tuesday , without comment , refused to consider the city ' s appeal . Finally on Tuesday , the same Riverside Superior_Court judge rejected the final argument that the spray-notification process was ambiguous . So despite three false starts -- caused by court delays and inclement weather -- the three helicopters were prepped for flights Tuesday at March Air_Force Base near Riverside , where they were under military guard . Protesters had threatened to release helium-filled balloons to thwart the helicopters but decided against it . The amount of malathion to be released amounted to 1.2 fluid_ounces per acre -- a weaker dose than would likely be used by back yard gardeners and commercial growers if they were to battle the Medfly on_their_own , state officials say . The concentration is half that used in 1989-90 when more_than 500 square_miles of Southern California were sprayed by air , and officials believed the effort had gotten_rid_of the pests . But the Medfly reappeared in 1991 . To battle the current infestation in the Los Angeles Basin , about 500 million sterile Medflies will be released weekly in a 1 # 500-square-mile area encompassing parts of Los Angeles , Orange and San Bernardino counties . Corona officials said some of those flies should have been reserved for use in western Riverside County as well . But the state said there were not enough sterile Medflies to blanket Corona as well , so the aerial spraying was a necessary last_resort . Confronted with the public outcry against the spraying , state officials said the droplets are not dangerous on contact -- although they may stain car paint . The Medfly is killed after eating the bait , but the malathion is too weak to affect horses and other livestock , state pesticide experts say . At worst , people exposed to the insecticide-bait mixture may experience a short-lived rash , medical experts have said . Critics have contended that malathion exacerbates chronic fatigue syndrome and other maladies . Owners of an estimated 15 # 000 horses in the region have complained that their animals might be spooked by the low-flying helicopters , and the state recommended that the horses be hobbled or otherwise restrained . Between eight and 10 aerial applications are scheduled in the next four months in an effort by the state and federal Cooperative Medfly Project to rid the Mediterranean_fruit_fly from Corona and Norco . A mated female Medfly was discovered in a trap there in December .</TEXT>
