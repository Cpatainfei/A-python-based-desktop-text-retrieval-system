   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; EXPANDED ROLE OF TV VIEWED CAUTIOUSLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The unwelcome specter of television looms larger and larger in the world of international soccer . This summer , for the first time , television will play a more-than-journalistic role in the World Cup . In a decision that looks suspiciously like the thin edge of a wedge , FIFA , world soccer ' s governing body , has ruled that television images can be used to judge the guilt or innocence of players who commit fouls . Such footage will be used only as a disciplinary tool after the fact and not during the game . Currently , disciplinary measures against players are taken solely on the basis of the referee ' s written match report . &quot; Television and video evidence will be used only in cases where there is some doubt about the responsibility of players sent_off or not sent_off , &quot; said Joseph ( Sepp ) Blatter , FIFA ' s general secretary . &quot; There will be no videos to artificially help the referee . The game must go_on with this uncertainty because it ' s a game played and controlled by human_beings and they must be permitted to make mistakes. &quot; Fine , but how long will it be before the next step is taken and referees run_over to check an instant replay on the sideline before awarding a penalty kick or red-carding a player ? Now that the door has been opened , all kinds of demons are likely to try to slip inside . * The Germans are finding_out now what problems result when match decisions are taken_out of the referee ' s hands . A couple of weeks ago , Bayern Munich defeated Nuremburg , 2-1 , in a Bundesliga match that enhanced Bayern ' s chances of winning the league championship and pushed Nuremburg closer to relegation to the second division . But Bayern ' s opening goal , scored by Thomas Helmer against his German international teammmate Andreas Kopke , the Nurmeburg goalkeeper , should not have been allowed . Even the Munich players admitted afterward that the ball had not gone_in . Referee Hans-Joachim Osmers awarded the goal and Bayern earned two crucial points for its subsequent victory . Nuremburg protested . Bundesliga officials consulted television replays of the game and saw that Helmer ' s shot had not crossed the line . For only the second time in history , league officials nullified the result and ordered the match to be replayed , a decision that infuriated Bayern Munich ' s coach , Franz Beckenbauer . &quot; This decision is completely incomprehensible , &quot; said Beckenbauer , Germany ' s 1990 World Cup-winning coach . &quot; We couldn ' t do anything about the_matter at all and ended_up being penalized . Any idiot can see that . While our opponents can rest , we have to play three matches in eight days. &quot; Last Saturday , it tied the first of those and dropped into second place behind rival Kaiserslautern . On Tuesday , it will play Nuremburg again , then end the season on Saturday . If Bayern Munich , 12 times champion of Germany and one of the world ' s great teams , loses this championship race , television ' s role in that loss will be argued long and loud . What will decide matches from now on -- the referee or a television_camera ? * Three hundred guests attended the lavish party . More_than 200 pounds of shrimp and lobster were consumed . Cavier and champagne and a 40-pound cake did an equally fast disappearing act . All the while , a 24-piece orchestra played . It was all_in honor of Pele , 53 , and his new wife , the former Assiria Seixas Lemos , 33 . The pair , who were married in a civil ceremony last year in the United States , celebrated that marriage in Recife , Brazil , on Saturday . But somehow it doesn ' t seem right . In a land such_as Brazil , where homeless children by the thousands wander the streets in search of food and shelter , Pele , of all people , should have seen the error . He did his reputation no good by partying so ostentatiously with the privileged and powerful . He was once barefoot , too . * The Italians have seen the light . Defensive soccer is a thing of the past . Starting next season , teams will be awarded three points for a victory instead of two . The idea is to encourage more attacking play and reward the teams that go_for goals . The idea is taking_hold on a broad scale . World Cup teams will receive three points for a victory this summer , and the three-point plan also will be in_effect when qualifying for the 1996 European Championship continues this fall . * World Cup officials in the United States fell_flat on their faces when they tried to force World Cup cities to ban the sale of alcohol during the tournament . Now , Norway , one of the 24 participating teams , is having a slight drinking problem , too . It seems that one of the Norwegian team ' s sponsors is a brewery that has pictures of the team on its advertising posters . This has prompted Rune Bratseth , the team ' s captain and an ardent teetotaler , to threaten to quit if the advertising_campaign is not withdrawn . The sponsor has said it will comply . * With Japan and South_Korea vying to stage the World Cup in 2002 , a potential compromise has been voiced . It is possible that both countries could be given the event . If the idea of a 32-team tournament becomes reality , each country could be given 16 teams and each would play host to games through to the semifinals . The idea is being given &quot; serious consideration , &quot; said Peter Vellapan , general secretary of the Asian Football Confederation . But which country would get the championship game and on what basis ? Soccer Notes Paris St Germain has won the_French League championship for the second time in the club ' s history and the first time since 1986 . . . . Dutch star Ruud Gullit will return to his old club , Italian champion AC Milan , next season after a year with rival Sampdoria , where he scored 15 goals and helped the club win the Italian Cup . . . . Belgium ' s World Cup coach , Paul Van Himst , is being offered a contract extension through the 1998 World Cup in France . . . . Colombia ' s captain and star midfielder , Carlos Valderrama , has been included in the team that will take_part in a four-nation tournament in Miami on Tuesday and Thursday . Valderrama was injured several weeks ago in a match against Sweden , also in Miami . Other teams in the tournament are Peru , El_Salvador and Honduras . Gunnar Halle , Norway ' s World Cup defender , suffered cracked ribs while playing for his English club , Oldham , and probably will miss the World Cup . . . . Holland ' s Erwin Koeman , the brother of fellow Dutch international Ronald Koeman , also will miss the finals after suffering a torn groin muscle while playing for PSV Eindhoven . . . .
