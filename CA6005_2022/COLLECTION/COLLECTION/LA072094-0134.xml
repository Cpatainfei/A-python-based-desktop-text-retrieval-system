   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; SIMPSON CASE IGNITES DEBATE ON LEGAL ETHICS ; LAW : ETHICAL BOUNDS OF DEFENSE_LAWYERS ' REMARKS ARE MURKY IN STATE . GARCETTI ' S COMMENTS ARE ALSO QUESTIONED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although the legal_profession is_full of people known for their rhetorical excesses , even lawyers face limits on what they can say . No lesser authority than the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that lawyers must watch their remarks in an attempt to assure fair and just trials . But in California -- the only state that has not adopted American Bar Assn . rules on lawyers ' comments -- the line between fair comment and foul_play is often murky . So it is no surprise that the latest comments from O.J. Simpson ' s defense_team , headed by Century City lawyer Robert L . Shapiro , have touched_off a robust debate in legal circles . Members of Simpson ' s defense_team , speaking anonymously to reporters , suggested that Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Fuhrman may have planted evidence in an attempt to frame the former football star on murder_charges . &quot; I don ' t mind calling someone a liar to his face , but to just slander someone anonymously and slink off into the darkness , this bothers me , &quot; said Los Angeles defense_lawyer Harland Braun , referring to the unsubstantiated and hotly denied suggestion that Fuhrman may have planted a bloody glove at Simpson ' s estate . On the other hand , defense_lawyer Barry Tarlow said Simpson ' s attorneys had been &quot; forced to descend into the gutter approach of litigation used by Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti. &quot; Indeed , the prosecution side has come_in_for its share of criticism -- largely because of public comments by Garcetti and leaks from unnamed law_enforcement officials . Tarlow blasted a &quot; devastating series of orchestrated leaks &quot; about Simpson -- most recently , reports that the former football star was carrying a passport and $ 10 # 000 when he led police on a low-speed chase through Orange and Los Angeles counties a month ago , casting doubt on the ex-athlete ' s statements that he was contemplating suicide in the wake of his former wife ' s murder . Veteran defense_lawyer Gerald L . Chaleff said both sides are leaking information and theories to the media in an attempt to manipulate the opinion of potential jurors in the double murder case : &quot; None of these statements , suppositions or leaks can be cross-examined. &quot; &quot; It ' s tragic to see a case like this where we seem to have a trial by leak or press_release , &quot; Chaleff said . &quot; Throughout this entire process , no one is coming_forward to take responsibility for statements , leaks or suppositions that are being released , either from the Los Angeles Police_Department or from the defense. &quot; Whether it is the allegation that Simpson was carrying cash and a passport , or the claim that Fuhrman may have planted evidence , &quot; the press ought to say we are not going_to publish this unless someone is willing to sign their name to it , &quot; Chaleff said . There is a long tradition of lawyers trying to manipulate the media , but this case is different , said West Los Angeles defense_lawyer Barry Levin . &quot; Any time I as a defense_lawyer feel I can ethically benefit my client by making a pretrial release of information , I will do so . But most of the time no one in the media will listen . It ' s not Bob Shapiro ' s fault that the media has an insatiable appetite for any story or theory in this case . He ' s just doing his job. &quot; Defense_lawyer Marcia A . Morrissey agreed . &quot; The defense would not be doing their job correctly if they ignored the media , &quot; she said . &quot; We don ' t litigate cases in vacuums , unfortunately. &quot; Indeed , Shapiro told the National Assn . of Criminal Defense_lawyers in a 1993 speech that &quot; the importance and power of the media cannot be overemphasized &quot; in high-profile cases when the media comes &quot; in droves. &quot; In a landmark 1966 decision , the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the murder_conviction of Cleveland physician Sam Shepard on the grounds that he was denied a fair trial because of extensive pretrial publicity . However , the high_court added that such reversals are not a total solution : &quot; The courts must take such steps by rule and regulation that will protect their processes from prejudicial outside interferences . Neither prosecutors , counsel for defense , the accused , witnesses , court staff nor enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the court should be permitted to frustrate its function. &quot; In 1991 , by a narrow majority , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that greater restrictions can be placed on the speech of a lawyer handling a case than can be imposed on other people . The purpose of the restrictions is to assure a fair and just trial . The basic standard set_out by the high_court is whether a lawyer ' s comment poses &quot; a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing a judicial proceeding. &quot; But that standard is too vague to offer lawyers any &quot; bright line guidance , &quot; said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky . Justice Anthony Kennedy ' s plurality opinion stressed , however , that particular care must be taken with any regulation that would inhibit &quot; the criminal defense bar , which has the professional mission to challenge the actions of the State. &quot; In that case , the Nevada Bar Assn . attempted to sanction a defense_lawyer for comments he made after his client was indicted . The lawyer portrayed prospective government witnesses as drug dealers and money launderers . The Supreme Court held that the Nevada rules were too vague to give the lawyer sufficient guidance on what he was permitted to say . The American Bar Assn . has adopted model rules about lawyer comments on pending litigation . But there is little case_law to provide guidance on the ethics of what lawyers can and cannot say about a case , Chemerinsky said . The situation is particularly murky in California because it is the only state that has not adopted the American Bar Assn . rules , said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers . Because of that , it is highly unlikely that attorneys on either side of the Simpson case would face bar association or court sanctions for comments they have made , legal_experts said . &quot; If there are no rules , then there are no rules to break , &quot; Gillers said . He said that if California had the ABA rules , lawyers on both sides in the Simpson case might be in_trouble . He cited statements by Garcetti on &quot; This Week With David Brinkley &quot; on June 19 , two days after Simpson was arrested . &quot; Well , it ' s not going_to shock me if we see an O.J. Simpson , sometime down the road -- and it could happen very soon -- it could happen months from now -- say , ' OK , I did do_it , but I ' m not responsible. ' We ' ve seen it in Menendez . It ' s going_to be a likely defense here , I believe , once the evidence is reviewed by the lawyers , &quot; Garcetti said . &quot; Any suggestion of an ultimate guilty plea &quot; violates one of the ABA rules , Gillers said . &quot; The district_attorney is not supposed to predict a guilty plea because it signals to the public a likelihood of culpability based on what the public assumes is the prosecutor ' s broader knowledge of the case . The subtext is ' I know the facts. ' &quot; Garcetti disagreed_with Gillers ' interpretation of the rule . &quot; As a prosecutor , it is my job to anticipate defenses , &quot; he said . &quot; The ABA section in_question does not go_to anticipating possible defenses , but to a situation involving a possible guilty plea of a defendant or in which a defendant has already made a confession or admission. &quot; Gillers said that statements attributed to the defense_team suggesting Detective Fuhrman planted evidence violate a different ABA rule against attacking the character of a witness . Asked_for a response , Shapiro said : &quot; I won ' t take any position on any evidentiary matter except in the courtroom. &quot; Gillers also said the defense might have run_afoul of an ABA rule_in referring to allegedly racist remarks Fuhrman made when he was attempting to get a stress disability pension from the Police_Department in 1983 . Gillers said those statements might have violated a rule against commenting on information &quot; the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is likely to be inadmissible as evidence in a trial and would , if disclosed , create a substantial risk of prejudicing a fair trial. &quot; However , other lawyers disagreed , saying it was possible that Fuhrman ' s prior statements might be admissible on cross-examination as part of a defense effort to show that he was biased against Simpson . In any case , Gillers said , even those states that have adopted the ABA rules do not enforce them vigorously . Chemerinsky said much of what lawyers in the case have said to the media has been &quot; completely appropriate , &quot; including a Garcetti news_conference in which he praised the prosecution team after Simpson was bound over for trial , and various statements by Shapiro questioning the strength of the prosecution case . But he said he , too , was troubled by Garcetti ' s comments on the Brinkley show and by the suggestion that Fuhrman planted evidence . &quot; The defense has no obligation to speak_to the press at all , but once they ' ve made the accusation that the police_officer planted evidence , they have an obligation to say what the factual basis for that statement is , &quot; Chemerinsky said . &quot; If there is a factual basis , an immediate disciplinary and criminal investigation of the officer should be launched . If there is no factual basis , the policeman is owed an immediate apology and the lawyers acted unethically , &quot; Chemerinsky said . Gillers said the defense had no such obligation , and said he would be surprised if the defense came_forth with more information on the issue at this point . &quot; The kind of motive that would prompt them to make the charge is inconsistent with the desire to explain themselves . By leaving it unexplained , they play into rumor and public suspicion. &quot; One possible remedy available to both sides is seeking a gag order . Thus far , neither side has done that or even hinted that it plans to do so . On Thursday , Garcetti said : &quot; We have never asked_for a gag order in a case , and I cannot imagine a situation in which we would. &quot; Shapiro said : &quot; If we were to seek a gag order , we would do that in court and we would not discuss it beforehand. &quot; Gag orders are granted infrequently . Last year , a federal appeals court overturned a gag order imposed on Braun by a federal judge presiding over the criminal trial of four Los Angeles police_officers accused of beating Rodney G . King . The appeals court said that Braun could not be prohibited from making critical comments about the prosecutors in the King case . Ultimately , his client and one other officer were acquitted and two officers were convicted and are serving federal prison_terms .</TEXT>
