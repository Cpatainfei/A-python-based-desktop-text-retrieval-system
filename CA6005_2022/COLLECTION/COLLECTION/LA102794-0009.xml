   <HEADLINE> POLITICS WATCH ; JUMPING THE FENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a year of destructive partisan politics , it is refreshing to see Rudolph W . Giuliani , the Republican mayor of New York City , drop a political bombshell by endorsing his state ' s Democratic governor , Mario M . Cuomo , for reelection . We are not naive enough to think Giuliani did so entirely out of altruism.He openly dislikes the Republican candidate , a state_senator from Upstate New York who Giuliani fears would undermine the city ' s efforts to close a $ 1-billion budget gap . And Giuliani is a bitter rival of the GOP candidate ' s mentor , U.S. Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato . Still , the mayor ' s willingness to risk his political future by crossing party boundaries in a Fiorello La Guardia-like gesture is a striking example for gridlock-bound Washington and Sacramento . There is recent precedent for such an action . Both Giuliani and his fellow big-city Republican mayor , Richard Riordan of Los Angeles , backed President Clinton in helping pass the crime bill despite partisan opposition from Republicans in Congress . And two top Republicans , Jack Kemp and William Bennett , came_out against California ' s Proposition 187 despite the fact Gov . Pete Wilson is campaigning for it . All this highlights the gulf in modern politics between private thought and public behavior . Kemp and Bennett could have kept their counsel ; Giuliani could have voted for Cuomo and expediently remained silent . &quot; that ' s one of the reasons why people are so turned_off about politics today , &quot; Giuliani said , adding , &quot; Because we don ' t act like we ' re real people. &quot;</TEXT>
