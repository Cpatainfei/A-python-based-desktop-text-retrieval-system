   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON JURY QUESTION LIST PROBES RANGE OF ATTITUDES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the first of 304 potential jurors in the O.J Simpson case return to court this month , they will be quizzed on a sweeping questionnaire about their attitudes toward Simpson , the two people he is accused of killing , celebrities in_general , domestic violence , DNA testing and interracial marriages . Prospective jurors have filled_out the unusual , 79-page questionnaire , made public by the court Friday . The survey , containing 294 questions , is designed to test each potential juror ' s suitability for the celebrated trial . Questions range from the mundane to the provocative : &quot; Do you seek_out positions of leadership ? . . . Have you seen O.J. Simpson in any form of advertising , such_as television commercials for Hertz Corp . or in orange_juice advertisements ? . . . What is your impression of Nicole Brown Simpson based upon what has been reported or published in the media ? . . . Have you ever felt sufficiently frustrated within a domestic relationship that you considered violence ? &quot; There is even a question asking whether the jury candidate owns any &quot; special knives. &quot; &quot; A person who himself owns a collection of knives is not going_to think_of themselves as violent , &quot; said UCLA law professor Peter Arenella , who believes that the question was devised by the defense to reveal attitudes potential jurors might have about people who own knife collections , as Simpson reportedly does . Those who do have such collectibles , Arenella said , probably &quot; would not draw any inference that Mr. Simpson would be violent merely because he owns knives. &quot; Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito , who released blank copies of the questionnaire Friday , worked with lawyers from the defense and prosecution to draft the document . Ito and the attorneys are expected to use the results , along with further questioning in court , to help select the 12 jurors and eight alternates for the double murder trial . Long and involved jury questionnaires are usually only used in high-profile cases such_as Simpson ' s in which a defendant is sufficiently affluent to hire a jury consultant . Simpson has pleaded not_guilty in the June 12 knife slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman outside her Brentwood condominium . Prosecutors believe the murder weapon was a 15-inch German-made Stiletto that they contend Simpson bought six weeks before the killings at a Downtown Los Angeles cutlery store . In addition to the query about knives , the questionnaire seeks to explore -- much more extensively -- the jury candidates ' attitudes toward the media , race and the type of DNA blood testing that prosecutors plan to use to connect the former football star to the murder scene . A full 13 pages of questions -- representing one of the largest sections in the survey -- are devoted to jurors ' views of the media , including the tabloid press and television_shows that are generally seen as more entertainment than journalism . &quot; Which of the following best describes how you would describe the media coverage overall ? &quot; one question asks , offering answers that range from &quot; accurate &quot; to &quot; sometimes accurate-sometimes not &quot; to &quot; inaccurate. &quot; The question that asks jurors whether they have seen Simpson in TV advertising is followed by a further query : &quot; If yes , describe the image that O.J. Simpson seemed to portray in your opinion. &quot; Jury consultants representing the prosecution and defense have helped to tailor the questions to eliminate bias . The goal of prosecutors is to detect jurors who might have more sympathy than objectivity in weighing the fate of a man who has spent his career cultivating a very likable image , experts noted . Defense attorneyswould like to ferret_out those who might have negative feelings toward Simpson based on race or other factors . One questions deals with attitudes toward interracial marriage . Another question asks point-blank : &quot; How big a problem do you think racial discrimination against African Americans is in Southern California ? &quot; A question apparently aimed at DNA testing asks jurors whether they have given blood samples to a doctor and whether they ever felt uncomfortable with the accuracy of the results . Questions about domestic violence are seen as important because information about O.J. Simpson ' s past physical abuse of Nicole Simpson could become evidence in the murder trial . Simpson pleaded no contest in 1989 to misdemeanor spousal abuse against his then wife . Jurors scheduled to return to court Oct . 12 will be asked about their responses to some , but not necessarily all , of the questions . This will be part of voir dire , the portion of jury selection that seeks to screen_out those who have made_up their minds about the case , have biases against either side , or who cannot set_aside information they have gained from sources outside court . If necessary , a second group from the jury pool is expected to start voir dire Oct . 17 , and a third group Oct . 24 . If the entire pool of 304 potential jurors does not yield the needed number of untainted panelists and alternates , Ito will begin creating another pool . However , Robert L . Shapiro , one of Simpson ' s lead attorneys , said in court this week that he could not imagine that the 20 could not be picked from among the 304 .
