   <HEADLINE> INFLATION_RATE FOR OCTOBER A SLIGHT 0.1 % ; ECONOMY : CONSUMER_PRICE_INDEX REPORT PROMPTS CRITICISM -- AND SUPPORT -- OF FED ' S LATEST INTEREST_RATE HIKE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Consumer prices barely budged in October , the Labor_Department reported Wednesday , offering more proof that inflation remains largely in check despite signs of consistently strong economic_growth . The consumer_price_index rose just 0.1 % last month , following September ' s 0.2 % advance . In the greater Los Angeles area , consumer prices rose 0.5 % in October but are up just 1 % for the year through October , the Labor_Department said . Sam Hirabayashi , the Bureau of Labor Statistics regional commissioner in San Francisco , attributed last month ' s increase mainly to higher grocery and private transportation costs . The report follows by a day the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s attempt to ward_off future inflation with a larger-than-expected boost in interest_rates . The central_bank jacked_up key short-term interest_rates Tuesday by three-quarters of a percentage_point -- its sixth increase this year -- in an attempt to slow the economy to a less inflationary pace . But last month ' s overall gain in the closely monitored inflation gauge was the smallest since prices posted a similar rise in April . Fed critics quickly seized_on Wednesday ' s benign inflation report -- energy and clothing prices actually fell -- as proof that the central_bank had needlessly increased the threat of recession by voting the biggest increase in interest_rates in 13 years . &quot; Inflation is not a threat , &quot; said Jerry Jasinowski , president of the National Assn . of Manufacturers and a leading Fed critic . &quot; The Federal_Reserve ' s aggressive increase in interest_rates yesterday was unnecessary. &quot; Critics argue that the Fed has failed to realize that dramatic changes in the U.S. economy , including increased foreign competition , mean the economy can grow at faster rates with lower unemployment without raising inflation threats . But other economists support the central_bank , saying that at this stage of the recovery , with U.S. industry operating at a 15-year high and unemployment down to 5.8 % , there is a need to slow growth to keep inflation from getting_out of control next year . Many economists insisted that the Fed ' s efforts to achieve a &quot; soft landing &quot; -- growth slow enough to keep wage and price pressures under_control -- appear to be working . A drop of 0.7 % in October energy prices helped hold_down the overall consumer_price_index . Food prices , which remained unchanged , also tempered the general advance . In September , energy prices also fell 0.7 % , while food prices rose 0.3 % . But even without the impact of the often-volatile food and energy segments , the so-called core rate_of_inflation showed an increase of only 0.2 % . The CPI figures show inflation rising at a pace that was slightly slower than forecast . Economists on average had predicted that consumer prices would rise 0.2 % . Excluding food and energy , they expected prices to rise 0.3 % . Other data released by the government suggests that the economy could strengthen further . American workers ' average weekly paychecks jumped in October , the biggest monthly increase in more_than a decade . Average weekly earnings rose 1.5 % last month , the largest advance since a 2.3 % gain in February , 1982 , the Labor_Department said . Earnings rose 0.7 % in September . Because consumers account_for about two-thirds of the nation ' s economic activity , the buying power of the average worker is viewed_as key to future growth . In another report , the Commerce_Department said inventories held by American businesses rose in September for a sixth straight month as businesses kept building stocks before the coming holiday sales season . Total business inventories increased 0.5 % to a seasonally adjusted $ 907.2 billion -- well above Wall_Street economists ' expectations of a slim 0.1 % rise -- following a 0.9 % gain in August .
