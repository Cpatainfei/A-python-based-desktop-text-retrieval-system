   <HEADLINE> ARAB_LEAGUE PUTS OFF CONSIDERATION OF ISRAEL BOYCOTT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the Arab League finds itself increasingly divided over whether to consider Israel a friend or foe , the massacre of about 30 Palestinians by a Jewish settler in Hebron has set_back the timetable for a possible lifting of the Arab boycott against the Israelis , officials said Monday . Foreign ministers of the Arab world , still fractured by the wounds left by Iraq ' s 1990 invasion of Kuwait , found themselves at their 101st regular session unable even to agree on who represents a common enemy of the Arabs -- though Israel got barely a mention among possible threats to Arab security . The conclusion of two days of meetings with no new resolutions adopted on the Arab boycott , Arab security or even the issue of a proposed Arab court of justice reflects the extent to which the Arab world remains unsettled by the Gulf War and uncertain about how to deal with prospects of a general peace with Israel . &quot; Relations with Israel have really changed substantially , and we cannot speak about Israel using the same language we used to use in the past , &quot; said Nagui Ghatrify , spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Egypt , which has urged its Arab neighbors to move toward peaceful relations with the Jewish state . But Syria and Lebanon prevailed in maintaining a hard-line stance toward Israel on resolutions pertaining to the Middle_East conflict , against a growing sentiment among the Arab Gulf states and North African_countries , like Tunisia and Morocco , that a moderate tone toward Jerusalem must be adopted in the Arab world . The Gulf states and North Africa proposed taking steps toward dealing with Israel as a recognized state and a member of the Middle_East community with which there should be contacts &quot; in a sense of partnership , &quot; said a source familiar_with the closed talks . In his opening address to the league , Secretary_General Esmat Abdel-Meguid called_for complete disarming of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories ; dismantling of all Jewish settlements in the territories , and speeding_up creation of an effective international observer force in the West_Bank . Despite strong lobbying by the United States , no move was taken_to lift the secondary economic boycott of Israel , under which companies that do business with the Jewish state are banned from doing business in the Arab world . &quot; The bloody and tragic events in Hebron really did not make_it possible or convenient to discuss the question of the boycott , &quot; Ghatrify said . &quot; It would have been a very nice gesture to Israel , ( but ) there remains a lot of bitterness , sadness and agony. &quot; Adnan Omran , the league ' s assistant secretary_general , said the group is unlikely to act_on the boycott until there is movement on the peace process between Israel and its neighboring Arab states . Farouk Shareh , Syria ' s foreign_minister , said the boycott &quot; is a legitimate act . . . as a result of Israel ' s occupation of Arab land , and it should remain so until the occupation ends. &quot; Sources said the league adopted resolutions on the peace process ; the Golan Heights ; the intifada ( the Palestinian uprising against Israel ) ; Jerusalem ; south Lebanon , and Palestinian refugees . They were very similar to previous , hard-line resolutions -- in part because Syria and Lebanon refused all overtures toward moderation . Under league rules , resolutions must be adopted unanimously ; there is not even agreement on amending the charter to allow_for divided opinion .</TEXT>
