   <HEADLINE> U.N. WILL PAY $ 94 # 000 TO SETTLE COMPLEX SEX HARASSMENT CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United Nations said Friday that it has settled one of its most protracted sexual_harassment cases , awarding American Catherine Claxton $ 94 # 000 . In addition , she will be reimbursed $ 110 # 300 for legal_fees and $ 6 # 500 for costs in the case she brought against Luis Maria Gomez , an Argentine official who was second in command in the U.N. Development Program before he resigned . Technically , the deal worked_out with Claxton means she receives the money for compensation resulting from the &quot; prolonged and complex nature of the proceedings that led to the resolution of her case , &quot; a U.N. announcement said . The settlement also provides that Claxton , an office worker , can appeal a decision concerning her job classification at the United Nations without liability . But U.N. sources said the settlement does not cover her suit in New York state court against Gomez personally , where she and her lawyers seek $ 2 million in damages . Claxton , in still-secret papers , charged three years ago that , in 1988 , Gomez shut the door to his office , grabbed and kissed her , and in another incident in a routine meeting , made sexual remarks . Gomez denied the entire episode , and his lawyers at one point demanded that the case be reopened , contending that the U.N. standards for sexual_harassment were made_up after the fact . The Claxton case , because of the wide publicity it engendered , pointed_up the lack of procedures and rules_in dealing with sexual_harassment in the vast U.N. structure with employees from all cultures in the world . In Friday ' s announcement , Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he has assembled a task_force to recommend improvements to current policies and procedures for handling future allegations of sexual_harassment . Attorneys who participated in the Claxton case , including noted trial_lawyer Alan Dershowitz , who defended Gomez , will be invited to present their views .</TEXT>
