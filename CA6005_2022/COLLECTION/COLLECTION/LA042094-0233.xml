   <HEADLINE> LEGISLATURE URGED TO NOT BOOST FELONIES ; CRIME : SEN . LOCKYER CAUTIONS AGAINST UPGRADING SOME MISDEMEANORS . HE FEARS WORSE PRISON OVERCROWDING BECAUSE OF ' THREE STRIKES ' LAW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Senate Leader Bill Lockyer recommended Tuesday that the Legislature refrain_from upgrading misdemeanor crimes to felonies because of uncertainty about the impact of the newly enacted &quot; three strikes &quot; anti-crime law . &quot; It ' s a genuine problem both of fairness and fiscal dimensions , &quot; Lockyer said in an interview . &quot; We ' re already worried that ' three strikes ' incarceration costs could cannibalize other taxpayer programs such_as education . So to the extent we expand the number of less serious felonies , we increase the problem. &quot; He announced the recommendation during a series of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on bills that would raise several misdemeanor offenses to felonies . Among the crimes that have been under_consideration for felony status are graffiti vandalism and abalone poaching . Lockyer is the former chairman of the committee and remains an influential member . Some Republicans said Lockyer was engaging in election-year posturing to wound the &quot; three strikes &quot; initiative . &quot; It ' s partisan , but everything is partisan this time_of_year , &quot; said Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) , who saw her anti-graffiti bill softened by the committee after Lockyer ' s warning . Lockyer said the &quot; three strikes &quot; ballot measure -- which sentences three-time felons to 25 years to life in prison -- enjoys such strong public support that &quot; this sort of tweaking won ' t make a difference. &quot; Instead , he suggested that the Legislature ' s persistent election-year practice of elevating relatively minor crimes to felonies could accelerate prison overcrowding problems expected to be caused by the &quot; three strikes &quot; law . The measure was signed into law by Gov . Pete Wilson this year , but &quot; three strikes &quot; backers went_ahead and put an initiative on the November ballot to guard against legislators tinkering with the provisions . Lockyer said he does not dispute that some crimes may deserve to be elevated to felony status , but suggested that many others are lesser offenses that should not be counted under the &quot; three strikes &quot; law . Although some legislators have proposed provisions to ensure that a particular crime does not count as a strike , Lockyer contends that voters ' approval of the November ballot measure would erase such exemptions , making third-time offenders liable for 25 years to life in prison for innocuous crimes . If the ballot measure passes , he said , it would take a two-thirds vote_in the deeply divided Legislature to exempt a felony from &quot; three strikes. &quot; LOCKYER , BILL</TEXT>
