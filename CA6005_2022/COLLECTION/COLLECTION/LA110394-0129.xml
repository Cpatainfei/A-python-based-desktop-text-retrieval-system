   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; SURVEYING THE PUSH-PULL OF FRENCH RENAISSANCE PRINTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just about everything you ever wanted to know about French prints of the 16th Century will be found in a sizable survey show newly opened at the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center -- although , you may_not have wanted to know anything at all . Printmaking flourished as a medium in Renaissance France , especially during the later decades . The exhibition , however , is pretty clear evidence of just how specialized a taste this work is today . It ' s hard to know just why . One reason might be the inescapable feeling that French Renaissance art represents , to a significant degree , an imported culture . Francis I , while warring in Lombardy in northern Italy , acquired an avid taste for Italian culture , and he was soon determined to shake_off any lingering traces of medievalism at_home . Eager to be up-to-date , as well as_to make his ambitious court rival the princely grandeur of neighboring city-states to the south , he spent considerable energy ( not to mention funds ) wooing Italian artists northward . Michelangelo and Raphael would n ' t come . The aged Leonardo da Vinci did -- only to die there not long after . More important for what was to follow , Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco Primaticcio also came . The two gifted , younger artists , who had left the classicism of the earlier generation behind in favor of Mannerist elaborations , were commissioned to renovate and decorate the king ' s hunting_lodge at Fontainebleau . Their high-style achievement set a tone that would redound in French art into the next century . Prints were one way the stylistic news spread . &quot; The French Renaissance in Prints From the Biblio-theque Nationale de France &quot; is a selection of nearly 200 engravings , etchings and woodcuts drawn from the extraordinary collection of the great Parisian library . The prints were chosen by Harvard professor Henri Zerner , who also worked with Marianne Grivel of the University of Rennes , France , and Cynthia Burlingham , curator at UCLA ' s Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts . Co-organized by the Biblio-theque and the Grunwald , the exhibition does a good job of sorting through very complicated terrain . The curators have given useful shape to a mightily tangled era . Separate sections of the show are devoted to prints derived from the elaborate decorations at Fontainebleau ; to the highly finished ( and often mechanistically dull ) work of the School of Paris , where printmaking was soon centered ; to regional developments in smaller cities ; and , to political tracts and propaganda related to the seemingly endless wars between Catholics and Protestants in this most tumultuous of French centuries , when royal rulers sometimes seemed to change with the seasons . Among the more intriguing of the latter group is a long , horizontal woodcut , printed from three plates and hand-colored , which depicts a meandering procession of 22 religious penitents in identical white robes , their faces hidden beneath hoods . One of them is the king -- although you can ' t tell him apart from all_the rest . The secretive costumes speak_of the political peril of religious affiliation . They also level all penitents in the eyes of God , regardless of station . The show is bracketed at each end by an in-depth look_at a single artist -- Jean Duvet in the first_half of the 16th Century , and Jacques Bellange at the start of the 17th -- who both worked in provincial centers far from the Parisian court . ( Their distinctiveness was no doubt enhanced by the fact. ) With 14 prints by each , it ' s possible to get a good_sense of the work of both . Individually , the figures in Jean Duvet ' s engravings tend to be marked by an intense naturalism , but typically they are deployed in fantastic , roiling , densely packed scenes . Duvet illustrated biblical tales from the Book of Revelations in a manner that sent the mundane mortal world spinning . The prints of Jacques Bellange , by contrast , couldn ' t be more gossamer , courtly and ethereal . Attenuated , transparent , crystalline forms achieve an otherworldly air . The miraculous ascension of the crucified Christ is announced by an angel in &quot; The Three Marys at the Tomb &quot; in a manner that renders all_of them as ghostly apparitions . Bellange ' s prints can be nearly as crowded with people and incidents as Duvet ' s , but his rendering of space is somehow thinned_out , like the Venetian Tintoretto ' s , as if lit by the glow of an inner_light . One provocative element of the show concerns the abundance of popular woodcuts made in Paris , such_as the complicated , hand-colored &quot; Judgment of Solomon &quot; ( circa 1560 ) by Mathurin Nicolas . Not much is known about the market for these relatively inexpensive broadsides , moral allegories and didactic narratives , though it likely differed from the courtly audience for engravings . Compared to the often polite and slickly refined engravings of the School of Paris , the woodcuts can possess a lively freshness that puts you in mind of popular posters or cheeky cartoons . They set you up for Honore Daumier three centuries down the road . &quot; The French Renaissance in Prints &quot; isn ' t a show that will send you out the door humming its greatest hits , but it is an admirable scholarly endeavor that fits an essential piece into a European historical puzzle . With its hefty , well-written , 493-page catalogue , and with a tour that will bring the show to New York ' s Metropolitan Museum in January , then home to Paris in April , it will likely stand as the definitive exhibition of its subject for some time_to_come . * UCLA at the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center , 10899 Wilshire Blvd. , Westwood , ( 310 ) 443-7000 , through Jan . 1 .
