   <HEADLINE> POPE URGES ITALY CATHOLICS TO KEEP POLITICAL UNITY ; ELECTIONS : HIS LETTER TO BISHOPS IS SEEN AS A RALLYING CRY FOR THE DISINTEGRATING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY . OPPOSITION IS CRITICAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pope John Paul II stuck an oar into the troubled waters of Italian politics Monday in a controversial pre-electoral appeal urging Roman_Catholics to reaffirm their political and cultural unity . A papal letter to Italian bishops was immediately seen as a rallying cry_for the decaying Christian Democratic Party , long a Vatican -- and American -- favorite but now fast disintegrating in a welter of corruption after nearly half a century as the country ' s dominant political force . What the Pope ' s spokesman called &quot; an appeal_to conscience &quot; came at the start of a week in which Prime_Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi faces a confidence debate in Parliament and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is expected to set a date for unpredictable , landmark elections . March 27 or April 10 seems the most likely date for the renewal of a Parliament many of whose senators and deputies are among about 3 # 000 Italian politicians , business_leaders and bureaucrats so far implicated in a two-year investigation into a multibillion-dollar nationwide kickback scandal . Acknowledging the need for &quot; profound political and social renewal , &quot; the Pope nevertheless urged Catholics to &quot; bear_witness with courage their faith in God . . . and their love for Italy through a united and coherent presence and an honest and disinterested service in the social and political field. &quot; Dishonest politicians should be punished , the Pope said , but he warned against confusing the &quot; abuse of power . . . and the normal and healthy functioning of institutions for public good. &quot; &quot; It is clear that the decisions affecting the future of a well-ordered society should not be put only into the hands of judicial authority alone , &quot; John Paul said . Magistrates in Milan and other major cities are expanding the scandal investigations despite calls_for a political solution to an apparently bottomless chronicle of institutionalized corruption . Splintered by scandal , the Christian Democrats are seeking to rebuild their credibility as the political center in time for the elections , in which the former Communist_Party looms as the nation ' s strongest political focus . That is not a pleasing prospect , John Paul made plain , noting the Christian Democrats ' &quot; great merit of having saved liberty and democracy &quot; from communism . &quot; The presence of lay Christians in social and political life not only was important to oppose various forms of totalitarianism , beginning with communism , &quot; the Pope said . &quot; It is still necessary to express the Christian tradition and culture of Italian society at the social and political level. &quot; In postwar decades , the Vatican openly supported the Christian Democrats , but Monday ' s papal letter had no precedent in John Paul ' s 15-year reign , said his spokesman , Joaquin Navarro . Navarro called the papal remarks &quot; an appeal_to responsibility . . . . This message is not political but cultural and ethical . It is his intention to go_deeper than tactics or politics. &quot; The Polish Pope ' s partisan sortie into politics became immediate fodder for protest from political groups expecting to oust the Christian Democrats from power for the first time since World_War_II . &quot; The Pope is a citizen of another state and should not concern himself with Italian politics , &quot; said Sen . Francesco Speroni , a leader of the separatist Northern League . Without mentioning them , the Pope scolded both the Northern League , which wants to make Italy a federal republic with three regional governments , and Italian neo-fascists who , along with the former Communists , scored well in municipal elections last month .</TEXT>
