   <HEADLINE> NOTEBOOK ; NORWAY WATCHES TWO GOLD MEDALS SLIP AWAY TO FOES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Norway has had worse days in the Olympics -- Winter and Summer -- but it ' s doubtful that one ever hurt as much as Tuesday . Two anticipated gold medals in Nordic skiing quickly turned_into a single silver . Hardly had the Italians beaten Norway ' s crack 40-kilometer cross-country relay team when Germany -- and Japan and Austria as well -- beat the Norwegians in team ski_jumping off the 120-meter hill . Jens Weissflog , the large-hill individual champion , gave Germany the victory with a final jump of 444 feet 6 inches . It was the longest of the day , tied the_hill record and gave Germany 970.1 points . Japan was second with 956.9 , Austria third with 918.9 and Norway a medal-less fourth with 898.8. In team competition , four jumpers for each team have two jumps apiece . Japan appeared to have won its first gold medal of these Games when its last jumper , Masahiko Harada , took his final jump . His team led by 55.1 points and all he needed was an average jump . Instead , he had a poor one , sailing only 319-9 and offsetting jumps of 442-9 and 436-3 1 / 2 by Jinya Nishikata and Takanobu Okabe . Then Weissflog launched his winning effort , and Harada buried his head in his hands . Harada , world champion on the normal hill , had leaped 400-3 1 / 2 on his first jump . &quot; I felt the pressure before the last jump and my takeoff was too early , &quot; Harada said . Joining Weissflog on the German team were Hansjoerg Jaekle , Christof Duffner and Dieter Thoma . When the results were announced they celebrated with a four-man wave . The United States finished 11th among the 12 teams competing . MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
