   <HEADLINE> HAITIAN GOURMANDS FIND THEIR PICKINGS SLIMMER AS EMBARGO HITS ELITE ; CARIBBEAN : EVEN THE PRIVILEGED ARE NOW FEELING THE PINCH . MANY ARE FOCUSING_ON A RELIEF FUEL SHIPMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First went gasoline . Then it was the electricity and telephones . Now it ' s Baltic Mousse . Until now -- and all through a series of international economic sanctions that have almost emptied Haiti ' s streets of vehicles and left the already beggared nation largely without power and telephones , with most of its people malnourished if not starving -- the country ' s elite had counted_on maintaining its usual privileges . Chief among them were the half_a_dozen or so quality international restaurants in Petionville , a tony suburb of Port-au-Prince high on a mountainside overlooking -- but distanced from -- the capital ' s squalor and misery . And the creme de la creme of the fancy beaneries was La Souvenance , where the specialty was Baltic Mousse , a mixture of herring and salmon eggs served with chopped onions and capers , often accompanied by champagne . But Baltic Mousse is no more , finally falling victim to the latest international sanctions . Those were imposed in mid-October to punish the Haitian military and its civilian allies for refusing to permit the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who had been overthrown in September , 1991 , in a violent revolt . Some people had put their hopes on a 300 # 000-gallon shipment of gasoline and diesel_fuel , due here this week for distribution to international feeding centers , hospitals and other humanitarian agencies . Perhaps some of it could be siphoned_off through traditionally corrupt avenues to those willing to pay ; or perhaps even given legally to restaurants on grounds that they provide &quot; humanitarian &quot; assistance by employing people . Not a chance , say diplomats and officials of the international agencies organizing the fuel shipment . They are determined to avoid charges that they are violating their own embargo -- so determined that they are tightly restricting distribution of the admittedly small amount of fuel . Not even the nation ' s most prominent hospital will receive any . The reasoning is that it mostly cares_for the rich . Although the diplomats and other international officials acknowledge that probably 25 % or more of the fuel will be subject_to &quot; leakage , &quot; even the most cynical observers doubt that any will find its way to Petionville ' s restaurants , at least not enough to keep them open for long . That is a shock to an elite that easily and arrogantly found a way to frustrate earlier sanctions , paying huge fees for ships to smuggle in spare_parts , French ice_cream and other delicacies . Jean-Guy Barme , the owner of La Souvenance , was once heard to say with a sly grin , &quot; Vive l ' embargo &quot; as he served freshly smoked Norwegian salmon , accompanied by a fine French white_wine . Now , standing in his restaurant , its tables adorned with wilting flowers , the subtle pink and gray colors of the elegant dining_room darkened by a power outage , the French-born Barme says he is finally beaten . &quot; I hope I can stay open on the weekends , &quot; he said , &quot; but I don ' t know . If there ' s no power and no fuel for the generators , I don ' t know. &quot; What he does know is that he can ' t get the fresh ingredients needed for something as fragile as Baltic Mousse . Neither can he count_on the steady refrigeration necessary to protect such delicacies from the tropical heat and humidity . The same restrictions have written finis for other posh restaurants -- La Voile , Cascade and Chez Gerard , all_of which have closed or restricted their openings to one or two days on weekends . &quot; It is a real loss , &quot; said the owner of a pharmaceutical company who lives_in Petionville . &quot; I want Aristide back , but I want to be able to go_to Souvenance or La Voile . Why shouldn ' t we have something nice in our lives ? &quot; For the international organizers of the boycott and the overwhelming majority of Haiti ' s 6 1 / 2 million people , the vanished Baltic Mousse is no loss , not when most of the population is out_of_work , has no private or public transportation and thus has no access to the already severely limited health system . CARE , the American relief organization , has had to suspend most of its feeding operations in the Northwest , Haiti ' s poorest region , because of the lack of fuel , while Catholic Relief Services has been forced to cut_back to one meal a day its feeding program in Port-au-Prince and other urban_areas . With black-market gasoline selling for nearly $ 8 a gallon , only the richest can afford to drive . Buses are charging passengers $ 5 to travel half the distance of their old routes , making_it nearly impossible for most students to reach their schools . The Haitian power_company has cut output so severely that even Petionville goes days without electricity . Now utility officials are saying that all service may end within days because the only working turbine is_on the verge of breaking_down . Cap Haitien , the country ' s second-largest city , has not had electricity for more_than two months , and most other areas have been blacked_out for even longer . Several telephone_exchanges have shut_down ; others are in such bad repair or so overloaded that it takes hours to get a dial tone , and that only leads to a busy signal . For more_than 12 hours , from Tuesday night to Wednesday morning , Haiti was without outgoing telephone_service : no international calls , no local_calls , nothing . &quot; We ' ve got some service restored , &quot; a telephone_company official said Wednesday , &quot; but it could happen again . It probably will. &quot; The humanitarian fuel shipment by Royal Dutch-Shell , arranged and paid_for by the United States , will not alleviate most of these hardships . Diplomats acknowledged that it is a gesture to offset growing criticism that the embargo is seriously harming Haiti ' s poor . Distribution of the shipment , about 85 % of it diesel_fuel , will be restricted to select public hospitals , four internationally operated feeding programs and non-governmental water treatment facilities . Officials said the shipment will be rationed to stretch it for as long as two months . &quot; Three hundred_thousand gallons , that ' s nothing , &quot; one diplomat said . &quot; It ' s about a pint a person . It ' s what Shell sells in two days . It ' ll take longer to hook it ( the tanker ) to the pipe than it will to pump it out. &quot; Anti-Aristide forces here , and even some people who favor his return , argue that the shipment is discriminatory . &quot; So you give fuel to a hospital , &quot; said Emmanuel Constant , head of the Front for Advancement and Progress of Haiti , a military-linked , violence-prone , anti-Aristide party . &quot; What about the poor_person who has no gas to drive his sick child to the hospital ? Isn ' t that humanitarian as well ? &quot; As small and relatively insignificant as the shipment will be , it has been threatened with theft and violence , armed intervention to prevent either its unloading or its distribution . &quot; If it isn ' t distributed equitably , &quot; said Constant , who led a violent demonstration Oct . 11 that discouraged a U.S. military cargo_ship from docking here , &quot; we ' ll just steal it. &quot;</TEXT>
