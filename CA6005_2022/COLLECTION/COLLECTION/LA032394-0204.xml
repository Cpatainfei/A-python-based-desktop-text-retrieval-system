   <HEADLINE> EUROPEAN UNION STILL DEADLOCKED ON 4 NEW MEMBERS ; DIPLOMACY : TIMETABLE FOR ADMISSION OF SWEDEN , FINLAND , NORWAY AND AUSTRIA IS CLOUDED BY VOTING PROCEDURE DISPUTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the third time in less than a month , the European Union ' s 12 foreign_ministers failed Tuesday to break a diplomatic deadlock that threatens to undermine the organization ' s plans to admit four new nations at the start of next year . The increasingly bitter dispute over voting procedures in an enlarged union has clouded the success of recently completed negotiations with the four candidate countries -- Sweden , Finland , Norway and Austria -- and placed the timetable for their proposed entry in jeopardy . It also has tarnished the union ' s image in all four countries , where already skeptical electorates must approve terms of membership in votes scheduled for later this year . After Tuesday ' s meeting failed , a clearly frustrated Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos announced that the ministers will next try to resolve their differences at an already scheduled , informal meeting this weekend in the northwestern Greek city of Ioannina . As the present holder of the union ' s rotating presidency , Greece will be host of the meeting . &quot; I can ' t accept the nightmare of not making a decision this weekend , &quot; Pangalos told reporters after the meeting . &quot; If we can ' t , we ' ll be in a lot of trouble. &quot; The EU enlargement is considered a vital step_on the path to greater European economic and political integration . While the present dispute centers_on how best to preserve the delicate balance of voting strengths among member states in an enlarged union , the real issues are the preservation of power and national self-interest . For very different reasons , two nations -- Britain and Spain -- have staunchly resisted what would appear to be a logical adjustment in an expanded union , namely to increase the minimum number of votes among member states required to block important new legislation . Their resistance reflects divisions that have emerged in the union , formerly known as the European Community , as it has grown in size and ambition over the past 3 1 / 2 decades from a group of six countries pledged to close economic cooperation to 12 nations committed by treaty to full political and monetary union . Under the present system , the 12 states muster a total of 76 votes , with large countries such_as Germany , Britain and France wielding 10 each and the smallest , Luxembourg , two . By agreement , a total of 23 &quot; no &quot; votes -- roughly , any combination of two large countries and one small -- is enough to block important new laws . ( However , fundamental changes on how the union functions , such_as the disputed voting issue , must be agreed upon unanimously. ) In some ways , the present crisis within the EU is reminiscent_of the early constitutional clashes that unfolded during the formation of the United States more_than two centuries ago . To accommodate the interests of both large and small American_states , for example , the Founding Fathers eventually agreed on a two-house national legislative_branch -- the Senate , where all states are treated equally , and the House , where representation is based on population size . But against the background of a divisive history , sharply divergent cultures and nine separate languages ( 12 if the four new candidates eventually enter ) , the search for compromise in building a more unified Europe is proving far more difficult . Spain ' s opposition to raising the size of a &quot; blocking minority &quot; to 27 votes reflects the fears of southerners being outvoted in a union suddenly prone to a northern bias . Britain , on the other hand , worries about an erosion of the power of large states to protect their interests . British resistance is also driven by the right_wing of Prime_Minister John Major ' s ruling Conservative_Party , a group long suspicious of its country ' s involvement in the union ; it has threatened open revolt against the prime_minister if he gives_in on the voting issue . As Tuesday ' s meeting ended here , Spanish resistance appeared to weaken slightly , but Britain remained unmoved in the face of mounting pressure from its partners . &quot; British intransigence now poses a threat to the very possibility of enlarging the EU , &quot; declared the European Parliament ' s Socialist leader , Jean-Pierre Cot , as Tuesday ' s meeting broke_up . &quot; This quarrel is not petty . It focuses_on the very concept we have of the European Union. &quot;</TEXT>
