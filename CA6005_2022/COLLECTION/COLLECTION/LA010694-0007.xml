   <TEXT> POP / ROCK Ruling Could Redirect Royalties : A New York federal_court ruling giving royalties to the heirs of the man who wrote the song &quot; When the Red , Red Robin Comes Bob , Bob , Bobbin ' Along &quot; could bring a windfall to the writers of favorite old tunes and their descendants . The case was brought by four heirs of Harry Woods , a now all-but-forgotten composer whose biggest claim to fame was the snappy 1926 hit . Judge Richard Owen ruled that the roughly $ 100 # 000 in royalties from versions of the song must revert to the composer ' s heirs and not the song ' s publisher . The publisher , the Bourne Co. , contended that the versions in_question were &quot; derivatives , &quot; the royalties for which , under current copyright law , go_to publishers . All sides agreed that &quot; Red , Red Robin &quot; -- performed in various forms over the years by Doris Day , Dean Martin and Al Jolson -- was a test_case , meaning that the judge ' s ruling , unless overturned on appeal , would apply to virtually all other music copyrighted since the 1920s .
