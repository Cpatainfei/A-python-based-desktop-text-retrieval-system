   <TEXT> On Nov . 16 , 1980 , Louis Althusser , the leading philosophical and political theorist of French Marxism , strangled his wife , Helene Rytman , in their suite at the Ecole Normale Superieure , an elite institute for the training of the_French professoriate where he had lived , first as a student , then as a professor , for 34 years . Many received the news of his crime as a symbol of the demise of European communism . Those who knew Althusser understood that whatever fit of madness induced him to strangle Helene was not brought_on by the world of politics . The elegant theorist , the man who redefined the concept of &quot; ideology &quot; as &quot; our imaginary relationship to real conditions of existence &quot; and who fought against a purely economistic interpretation of the works of Marx , had shuttled back and forth between the Ecole Normale and the psychiatric_Hospital Sainte Anne at regular intervals for many , many years . As a result of the murder of his wife , Louis Althusser was declared unfit to stand trial by reason of insanity -- in French , this is called a non-lieu . This verdict preceded and preempted a trial . The non-lieu saved Althusser from the nightmare of a trial , and possible condemnation , but its consequences were enormous . As a person deemed unfit to plead , he lost his right to a trial -- that is the right to testify and be held responsible_for his actions ; he lost his right to enter into contract ( his affairs would be handled by a legal_guardian ) and hence by extension -- at least symbolically -- his signature , his authorship . Althusser , calling himself a &quot; missing person , &quot; claims to be writing his memoir from this &quot; non-place. &quot; He writes not as some latter-day Chateaubriand , from beyond the grave : He writes buried alive . Following the murder , Althusser was committed to psychiatric internment for a period of three years , after which he retired quietly to an apartment far from the Ecole Normale . There he wrote the second of the two memoirs published in this volume , which were donated after his death in 1990 to the IMEC , the Institute for the Memory of Contemporary Publishing in Paris . ( The IMEC houses archives of a number of French writers , including Celine , Genet and Paulhan ) . Olivier Corpet , the director of the IMEC , prepared the Althusser manuscripts for posthumous publication along with Yann Moulier Boutang , Althusser ' s biographer . Their editors ' forward , like the introduction to a very good mystery tale , frames what follows with a statement of the basic facts and with provocative questions for the reader : &quot; How is it that such a story can move_into the realm of madness , yet its author remain so aware ? How does one come_to terms with the author of a book of this kind ? &quot; Althusser ' s story , they argue , is both the work of a madman and of a philosopher , both a work of imagination and a document about contemporary French intellectual history . Part one , &quot; The Future Lasts a Long_Time , &quot; was written in 1985 . It is structured as a flashback , beginning with the scene of crime -- the night of the strangulation -- and moving backward to Althusser ' s relationship with his mother , his upbringing , his relationship with Helene , his intellectual formation and the escalating mental_illness that would lead to the murder . Part two , &quot; The Facts , &quot; written before the murder in 1976 , is straightforward and condensed , reiterating the themes of part one in a lighter mode . The lucidity of a man condemned by his madness to a living death is perhaps what gives this book its chilling edge . Althusser ' s sense , since childhood , of_his_own nonexistence is at its core . He was named after his mother ' s great love , Althusser ; when Louis died at Verdun in World_War I , Althusser ' s mother would marry Louis ' brother , Charles , and name their son for the dead love . Althusser is a brilliant close reader of his given name : &quot; For a long_time , Louis was a name I literally detested . It was too short . . . and ended in the sharp &quot; ee &quot; sound which offended me . . . . Doubtless it also said yes ( oui ) a little too readily on my behalf , and I rebelled against this ' yes , ' which corresponded to my mother ' s desire rather than to mine . Above all , it contained the sound of the third_person pronoun ( ' lui ' ) which deprived me of any personality of my own , summoning as it did an anonymous other . It referred to my uncle , the man who stood behind me : ' Liu ' ( him ) was Louis . It was him my mother loved , not me . . . . My mother ' s love , directed through me to someone who was dead , made_it impossible for me to exist in my own right. &quot; Douglas Johnson , a former student of Althusser ' s , argues in an introduction designed for readers outside France that one should not take Althusser too seriously when he insists that he was something of a fraud as a thinker . This is just the kind of joke , Johnson surmises , that brilliant Ecole Normale students like to make about never having to study . He ' s doubtless right on target about students at the Ecole , but not about Althusser . The sensation of fraudulence was deeply bound up with Althusser ' s self-definition , his depression , his imagination . The passages where he explores his own success , and his concomitant feelings of being a fake ( his ability to charm , to reduce things to a formula ) , are among the most critical moments in the book . He writes , &quot; In fact my philosophical knowledge of texts was rather limited . . . . I felt ( what an illusion ! ) that I was capable of working_out , if not the specific ideas at least the general drift or direction of an author or a book I had not read , on the basis of a simple turn of phrase . I obviously had certain intuitive powers as well as a definite ability for seeing connections , or a capacity for establishing theoretical oppositions , which enabled me to reconstruct what I took_to_be an author ' s idea on the basis of the authors to whom he was opposed. &quot; This confession does not lessen our sense of Althusser ' s contribution to the history of philosophy -- his theories , by now , have taken_on a life of_their_own , separate from his life -- but it heightens our sense of his self-loathing . Each successful writing project would be followed by anguish , and a breakdown . What Althusser proves in &quot; The Future Lasts Forever &quot; is that in addition to his talents for theoretical work , he had a real genius for story-telling . The feeling of having &quot; gotten_away with murder &quot; all his life is what makes the literal murder of his wife make such terrifying good_sense . His writing ranks with Gide ' s for narcissistic self-condemnation and with James M . Cain ' s for sheer creepiness and a sense of evil . The clarity of his French formulations are inevitably somewhat muted in English , but Richard Veasey ' s British translation works . I liked the choice of &quot; The Future Lasts Forever &quot; as the title for the two-part volume , instead of the original French , which would have translated literally as &quot; The Future Lasts a Long_Time Followed by the Facts : Autobiographies. &quot; The idea of a future lasting forever captures perfectly our sense that Althusser was condemned by his murder to a living death . As a reader I had the uncanny feeling of inhabiting Althusser ' s thoughts ; repulsed and fascinated by him , as he was by himself , I was terrified and compelled to read on . Who , I kept asking myself , was Helene , the woman portrayed on Page 1 , already dead , the tip of her tongue showing between her teeth and lips ? I learned that after the first time Althusser made_love to her ( he was a virgin at age 30 ; she was 38 ) he vowed never to do_it again and needed to be hospitalized for anguish ; that she was purged from the_French Communist_Party on suspicion of betraying the Resistance and that Althusser didn ' t believe the charges but voted to purge her in a moment of cowardice ; that he tortured her by seducing other women in her presence ; that his friends resenting her ; that , with the pressure of taking_care of him , she became every bit the witch they imagined . We may need to wait for the translation of Yann Moulier Boutang ' s biography to learn more about Helene Rytman ' s own story . The way Althusser himself tells it , the real incentive for murder was all hers .</TEXT>
