   <HEADLINE> RWANDA REFUGEES URGED TO GO_HOME IN BID TO EASE CRISIS ; AFRICA : THE U.N. REVERSES ITS POLICY AND OFFERS TO HELP REPATRIATE MORE THAN A MILLION HUTUS . IN WASHINGTON , CLINTON ORDERS ' MASSIVE INCREASE ' IN U.S. AID .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Swamped by the dying , diseased and exhausted , the United Nations announced Friday that it would encourage and assist the voluntary repatriation , on foot , of more_than 1 million Hutu refugees back to Tutsi-controlled Rwanda in hopes of lessening the humanitarian crisis here . The decision was a major policy reversal for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , which had insisted Rwanda was still a dangerous place after a civil_war and 3 1 / 2 months of tribal slaughter . The policy_change , which came_after U.N. officials received assurances from Rwandan rebel leaders that those returning would be safe , was unlikely to have an immediate effect on the flood of refugees who have overrun this border town and overwhelmed international relief agencies . But aid officials said they hoped that the policy_change would eventually encourage the refugees to begin their trek home , easing the catastrophic conditions here . On Friday in Washington , President Clinton ordered an &quot; immediate and massive increase &quot; in U.S. assistance to Rwandan refugees , including a round-the-clock airlift of food , water and medicine to areas where the death toll from a widening epidemic of cholera and other highly contagious_diseases has risen dramatically . In Goma , Ray Wilkinson , a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency , said his organization had confirmed nearly 3 # 000 deaths in the past three days . But that figure , he said , didn ' t include hundreds who were collected and buried in mass graves by French army teams or countless others who have died in sprawling refugee camps that still are without adequate food , water or medicine . The ravages of the fast-spreading epidemic , compounded by exhaustion and hunger , were everywhere amid the grim chaos here Friday . As the day wore_on , hundreds of corpses were placed in dusty rows alongside the road . Bodies also crowded the few field clinics and lay across the black lava-strewn fields . At a single clinic run_by the Catholic diocese in downtown Goma , about 30 people died overnight from a refugee population of 10 # 000 . &quot; The normal death rate is 1 in 10 # 000 , &quot; said Isabelle Pardeau , a doctor at the clinic . &quot; Two in 10 # 000 is severe . Ten is catastrophic . And here we had 30. &quot; Outside the foul-smelling clinic , a woman staggered by a stone_wall . She took two steps , then leaned weakly against the wall . One more stumbling step and she collapsed , face down and lifeless in the sharp-edged rocks . About 130 were dead by early morning just outside the town of Munigi , where several thousand sick people lay jammed together on reed mats , thin mattresses and bare rocks under the hot sun . Half a dozen doctors and nurses worked frantically to separate the dead from the living . &quot; These two people are dead , &quot; an Irish nurse , Bernadette Feeney , shouted from the middle of the field . &quot; They are dead . They must be removed. &quot; A French doctor screamed and cursed in her radio nearby , &quot; We need water ! We need water now ! Now ! &quot; The six-tent field_hospital finally received a container of clean water by late afternoon and enough intravenous drips to rehydrate the worst off . In most cases , a relative stood above the patient , holding a plastic bag with saline_solution . But 50 more corpses had already appeared , and no food had arrived for the third day in a row . At Munigi , the sickness was compounded by fear as Zairian army soldiers appeared overnight and tried to order the people to leave . Witnesses said the soldiers first fired automatic_rifles into the air , then fired into the crowd . At least three people were killed . Aid officials and the Zairian government have tried to use food as a magnet to draw refugees from Goma , where no emergency food or water is distributed , and into makeshift camps as far as 40 miles away . A river of refugees poured up the narrow road Friday , leading cattle , goats and children . Most carried mattresses , blankets , cooking pots or water containers on their heads . A few were hauled in wheelbarrows or rode heavily loaded bicycles . Thousands squatted by the roadside under the hazy shadow of nearby volcanoes . Others never made_it , however , and corpses lay_in blankets and mats along the road . One man ' s body stretched across the pavement where he fell , blocking traffic . And even those who arrived_at the camps found little help since no clean water and only a third of the required food was available . An estimated 300 # 000 people , for example , have already settled amid the grassy hillocks and jagged lava boulders at Kibumba , 15 miles north of Goma . The camp , a teeming rabble of tiny grass huts dotted with tents of blue plastic , stretches to the hazy horizon . Smoke from cooking fires is thick and foul . The only local source of water is a scum-covered pond lined with cattle excrement . Entrepreneurs and still-uniformed soldiers of the defeated government army sell plastic containers of water for the equivalent of 50 cents each to those who can afford them . Others sell potatoes , cabbages and freshly slaughtered goat meat by the roadside . The camp has only one medical dispensary , three tents surrounded by a sea of the stricken . A single tanker truck with 2 # 000 liters of clean water arrived_at the clinic at 1 p.m. , but the camp ' s needs were 3 million liters a day , said Bob Van Soest , a Dutch sanitation worker . &quot; It ' s a nightmare , &quot; he said wearily . &quot; In this area , you can ' t dig for water . We don ' t have time to do a survey for drilling . The people are dying under our hands . We need to truck the water in . But the roads are impassable. &quot; Many here said they had no intention of going_back to Rwanda because they fear they will be killed by the Tutsi-run government of the Rwandan Patriotic Front , led by Maj . Gen . Paul Kagame . An estimated 500 # 000 Tutsis were hacked and shot to death by vicious Hutu death squads before Kagame ' s guerrilla army won control of the tiny mountainous country two weeks ago . &quot; I can ' t go_back , &quot; said Salvatori Uzabakiriho , a 20-year-old Hutu and former student in Rwanda ' s capital , Kigali . &quot; They will kill me . They will kill me because I am not one of them. &quot; Another refugee , Eustasie Wanzunuwe , 30 , insisted -- even as she lay_with an intravenous drip in her arm -- that the cease-fire in Rwanda was only a ruse . &quot; They stopped fighting so we will go_back , &quot; she said weakly . &quot; Then they will kill us . That is the strategy. &quot; The defeated government ' s propaganda radio has fueled the panic by warning that victorious Tutsis will show Hutu refugees no mercy if they return . Wild rumors have spread that Tutsis have mined roads into Rwanda and caused the cholera epidemic by poisoning the food and water . Eight ministers of the former government are in Goma , and aid officials fear the exiled Hutu leaders seek to keep the refugees here as virtual hostages until they can resume the war . In any case , several hundred refugees who tried to return to Rwanda on Friday were halted at the border at Goma by heavily armed Zairian commandos . Wilkinson , of the U.N. refugee agency , said a letter explaining the new repatriation policy had been given to the local Zairian governor . Wilkinson said he expects the border to reopen in the next few days . &quot; We do not know why &quot; it was closed , he added . He said the decision to urge refugees to return to their villages came_after Michele Moussalli , a special envoy for the U.N. refugee agency , met with Kagame in Kigali on Thursday and met relief officials at the border here Friday . Wilkinson said Moussalli won assurances from the new government that &quot; any Rwandan not wanted for alleged war_crimes and who wants to go_home will be welcome. &quot; &quot; We now believe it is safe for the people who want to go_back , &quot; Wilkinson said . &quot; We will help anyone who wants to go back. &quot; No one would be forced to return , he said . He added that no timetable has yet been made_for the repatriation , and refugees must return home the way they came -- on foot . He called the decision &quot; a sliver of optimism &quot; amid the horrors that have descended upon this remote stretch of Central_Africa . But he admitted it would be &quot; a hard_sell &quot; to refugees terrified of reprisals after the Hutu-led massacres .
