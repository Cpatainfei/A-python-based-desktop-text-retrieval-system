   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : BREA ; SCHOOLS OUTLAW DISCRIMINATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to curtail a rise in racial and ethnic discrimination among students in Brea Olinda Unified School District , trustees this week implemented a policy outlawing such behavior . Under the policy , any student who displays or distributes flyers or any kind of hate material , including stickers and buttons , will face suspension or expulsion . In addition , students will be prohibited from name-calling and from discriminating , harassing , teasing , abusing or assaulting other students because of handicap or a difference in background , ability , religion , culture , race , ethnicity , language , tradition or gender . Supt . Edgar Z . Seal said the administration made the recommendation following parents ' pleas , which were sparked by a recent incident at Brea Junior_High_School . A student at the school found a swastika in a book she checked_out of the campus library , then displayed the swastika , while making derogatory remarks to other students . As a result of the incident , the student was suspended for four days , Seal said . The incident was reminiscent_of one last June , when three students were suspended for making &quot; racial slurs. &quot; Two of the students , who went_to Brea Junior_High , were suspended for four days , while a Brea Olinda High_School student was suspended for five days . Racial discrimination among students is not new but the suspensions were the first in the district ' s history , Seal said . Until last year , principals would call parents and counsel students who discriminated against their classmates . Now , principals report such problems to the district , Seal said . &quot; We noticed the incidents were taking_place and we felt ( the policy ) was needed because our student population is becoming more and more diverse , &quot; he said . &quot; We need to celebrate our cultures , not denigrate them. &quot; Currently , 68 % of the district ' s students are Anglo , 18 % are Latino , 8 % are Asian and 2 % are black . By the year 2020 , officials expect Caucasian students to be in the minority.MIMI KO</TEXT>
