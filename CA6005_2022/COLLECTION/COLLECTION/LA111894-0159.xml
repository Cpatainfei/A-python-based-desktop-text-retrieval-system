   <HEADLINE> STATE FINES HMO $ 500 # 000 IN CASE OF GIRL WITH CANCER ; MEDICINE : REGULATORS SAY ADEQUATE TREATMENT WAS NOT PROVIDED . TAKECARE CALLS THE ACTION UNJUSTIFIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State regulators , in an extraordinary action , on Thursday fined a Northern California health_maintenance_organization $ 500 # 000 for failing to provide adequate medical_care to a 9-year-old girl with a rare childhood cancer . The fine against TakeCare Inc. is the biggest financial penalty ever levied against a health plan by the California Department of Corporations , which regulates HMOs . Corporations Commissioner Gary S . Mendoza called the TakeCare case &quot; particularly egregious &quot; and said the health insurer ' s actions &quot; put the patient ' s life in jeopardy. &quot; The enforcement action was applauded as an important victory by medical and consumer groups that have been increasingly critical of the HMO industry ' s efforts to drive down medical costs -- an effort they contend can jeopardize the quality of patient care . Some of those same groups have also complained of what they see as the state ' s lax regulation of HMOs . &quot; This sends a message to the industry that they need to pay_attention to more_than just the bottom_line , &quot; said Judith Bell , co-director for the San Francisco office of Consumers Union , a watchdog organization . Steven Thompson , a vice_president for the California Medical Assn. , the state ' s largest physician organization , said the fine sends a message to HMOs that &quot; before you deny treatment , make_sure that the denial is based on good , sound medical advice. &quot; Ria Carlson , spokeswoman for FHP International Corp. , a Fountain Valley-based HMO that acquired TakeCare earlier this year , called the fine unjustified , but she said FHP will &quot; work very closely with Corporations to resolve &quot; the_matter . The state alleges that TakeCare failed to provide Carley Christie of Woodside access to a qualified pediatric surgeon when she was diagnosed in January , 1993 , with a rare form of childhood kidney cancer known as Wilms ' tumor . The state also alleges that the Concord-based health plan &quot; retaliated &quot; against Carley ' s parents , Harry and Katherine Christie , when they decided to go outside TakeCare ' s network of authorized physicians to find a surgical specialist with experience in Wilms ' tumors . After the successful surgery at Stanford_University Hospital , TakeCare refused to cover the $ 57 # 000 medical_bill , saying the Christies violated their HMO agreement in going outside the network without approval . The Christies have contended that in the traumatic few days after their daughter was diagnosed with cancer and then scheduled for surgery , they had insufficient time to get the proper authorization . Moreover , they didn ' t want their daughter ' s surgery to be performed by a physician who lacked experience with Wilms ' tumors . Carley , now 11 , has since recovered from her surgery and subsequent cancer treatment . She is &quot; an active young_woman &quot; who plays_on her sixth-grade soccer team and takes jazz-dance and piano_lessons , said Harry Christie , an electronic_equipment salesman . &quot; Thank God we made the decision we did , because we know Carley got_the_best medical_care to ensure her survival , &quot; Christie said . The Christies have been waging a battle with TakeCare and state regulators for nearly two years to get compensation in their case . Earlier this year , an independent state arbitrator ruled_in favor of the Christies and ordered TakeCare to reimburse them for their medical and some legal expenses . Although the fine was a record for state regulators , some HMO members , however , have won multimillion-dollar damage awards in treatment-denial cases that have been decided in court . Mendoza , who has ruffled the feathers of health insurers since taking_over the Department of Corporations ' top job a year ago , said his decision is an attempt to &quot; make certain that the quality of patient care is not compromised in this era of cost containment. &quot; Mendoza said his department receives about 2 # 000 complaints a year from HMO members , a small figure when compared to the many millions of Californians who belong_to such plans . But the Consumer Union ' s Bell says that figure doesn ' t necessarily represent the true number of HMO complaints . &quot; There are plenty of complaints , but consumers either don ' t know they can file with the Department of Corporations or they don ' t think the agency will do something , &quot; she said , noting that few people are as persistent as the Christies in pursuing claims .</TEXT>
