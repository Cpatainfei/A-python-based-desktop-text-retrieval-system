   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ALEXANDER COCKBURN : STAGE IS SET FOR EXPANDED INTERVENTION ; THE BOMBING OVER GORAZDE COULD BE A BUMP ON THE ROAD TO PEACE , BUT MORE LIKELY SIGNALS A WIDER WAR AGAINST THE SERBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The weekend NATO bombing of Serbian forces around the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde comes as the consummation of a protracted , furious campaign here for vigorous military intervention on behalf of the Bosnian Muslims . After teetering on the edge of the knife , amid advice by U.S. military officials not to mount air strikes against Serbs around Gorazde , the Clinton_Administration reversed its posture of only last week and committed F-16Cs in two strikes . As we shall see , this was the finale of a set-up by the Bosnian Muslims . The actual raids won ' t make any difference in the local tactical situation . So the real intent is to signal what Henry Kissinger used to call &quot; U.S. resolve. &quot; But resolve for what ? With the secession -- amid Western encouragement -- of Slovenia and Croatia from the old Yugoslav federation , and the prompt recognition by the West of the breakaway in April , 1992 , of the Muslim-dominated republic of Bosnia , bloodshed was assured . The Serbs in the Krajina enclave in Croatia and in the fragile ethnic and religious mix_in Bosnia felt that their position had become impossibly precarious . The war , with all its horrors , began . The deal pushed by the United States this spring fostered a closer relationship between the Croatians and the Bosnian Muslims . The Serbs in their enclave in Croatian Krajina would acknowledge Croat suzerainty , but receive guarantees of some form of autonomy . As envisaged in all_the peace plans , the Serbs in Bosnia would hold about 50 % of Bosnia . Serbian concerns would thus be allayed . But the Serbs could be reading this very differently . U.S.-fostered ties between Croatia and the Bosnian Muslims mean that arms now flow unimpeded through Croatia to the increasingly formidable Muslim forces , which are commencing onslaughts against the Serbs . Furthermore , Croatia could start pressing_down_on the Serbs in Krajina , evoking once again memories of the terrible massacres of World_War_II . The Serb attack on Gorazde reflects their fear that the diplomatic and military balance of forces has turned against them and that a U.S.-Croatian-Muslim coalition will engineer all_the perils Serbs feared back in 1992 . They have good reasons to sense a double-cross . The Western press have been overwhelmingly blind to Serb concerns and partial -- often grossly so so -- to the Bosnian Muslims as the latter maneuvered toward U.S. military intervention on their side , which is now taking_place . Take the Feb . 5 shelling of the marketplace in Sarajevo that killed more_than 60 people and decisively strengthened the hand of those urging intervention . BBC correspondent John Simpson , writing in the_British weekly the Spectator for April 2 , describes how Bosnia ' s President Alija Izetbegovic failed to appear at a Feb . 9 cease-fire meeting among all parties brokered by the U.N. commander , Lt . Gen . Michael Rose . It seemed that once again , as so often before , Izetbegovic was trying to torpedo any cease-fire or settlement . Rose , according to Simpson ( himself no friend of the Serbs and writing in a fanatically pro-interventionist periodical ) sprang into his armored car , made haste to Izetbegovic ' s quarters and closeted himself with the Muslim president , who proceeded to the peace meeting shortly thereafter . Simpson writes that according to one &quot; insider &quot; ( one would surmise , Sir Michael himself ) the_British general &quot; threatened to question publicly whether the Serbs really had been responsible_for the marketplace explosion. &quot; Rose officially denies the story and the Muslims are saying nothing . Experienced correspondent Misha Glenny has also hinted at Muslim culpability . The Serbs ' attack on Gorazde was preceded last week by Muslim attacks on Serbs in central Bosnia . The Serbs said they would retaliate unless the Muslims guaranteed a cease-fire . The Muslims offered only a 24-hour truce . The Serb attacks on Gorazde followed , with -- according to the London Financial Times of last Friday -- U.N. officials on the spot admonished by their bosses to downplay the Muslim provocation . The Bosnian Muslims and their U.S. public-relations firm have been successful in manipulating opinion here . The stage is now set for larger intervention against the Serbs . A pessimist or a cynic could see across the rubble of President Clinton ' s domestic policies and the Whitewater mess the outline of a more bellicose foreign stance . Today , bombs over Gorazde ; tomorrow , bombs over North_Korea . The Clinton_Administration may feel that Serbia ' s sponsor , Russia , is toothless as Boris Yeltsin slumbers through his twilight . They should beware . As veterans of the Korean_War will recall , China is a different matter .</TEXT>
