   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; PRESSURE APPEARS TO BE_ON SWEDES ; HOCKEY : THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT NOTHING SHORT OF THE GOLD IS ENOUGH . CANADIANS ARE RELAXED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Happily casting themselves as underdogs in today ' s gold-medal game against Sweden , Canada ' s Olympic hockey_players romped through practice Saturday . &quot; I like our mood , &quot; Coach Tom Renney said . &quot; And given what we had to work with over the course of the year and how various hockey people looked_at how we ' d compete , we ' re satisfied with that role . &quot; In the minds of other people , maybe we ' re somewhere we shouldn ' t be . But in our minds , we deserve to be where we are. &quot; Although they have won the World Championship three times since 1987 and Olympic bronze medals in 1980 , ' 84 and ' 88 , Swedish teams have never won a gold medal . A loss today to Canada , whose 5-1-1 record is identical to theirs , might cost Coach Curt Lundmark his job . &quot; We read in the newspapers that we ' re supposed to win the gold , &quot; said left wing Mats Naslund , the former Montreal Canadien standout . &quot; Even our ( hockey ) federation says the only thing that counts is if we win the gold . That didn ' t help. &quot; Sweden ' s only loss here was to Canada , by 3-2 in the final round-robin game . Canada also defeated Sweden in two of their three pre-Olympic games and at last year ' s World Championship , but the players aren ' t relying_on history . &quot; If you go_in thinking , ' We beat them three times , so we should beat them a fourth , ' that can be deceiving , &quot; defenseman Brad Schlegel said . &quot; This is a one-shot deal . . . . Sweden is a patient hockey club , sound defensively , and they move the puck well and counterattack . We have to be aware of that. &quot; They also have to be aware of Peter Forsberg , who set_up Sweden ' s first three goals against Russia in a 4-3 semifinal victory Friday . Forsberg was the sixth pick in the 1991 NHL draft . &quot; He proved to me he ' s not only a promising player , he ' s ready to play in big_games , &quot; Naslund said . &quot; I had doubts , a little bit , but ( Friday ) he played 60 minutes of super hockey. &quot; Naslund centers for Jonas Bergkvist and Roger Hansson on Sweden ' s top line . Its top individual scorer , right_wing Patrik Juhlin -- seven goals , eight points -- usually plays with Naslund and King draft pick Daniel Rydmark . Canada has scored 25 goals , five fewer than Sweden , but each team has given_up only 16 . Corey Hirsch , who has a 1.98 goals-against average , will start in goal for Canada against Tommy Salo , who has a 2.20 average . &quot; We ' ve got_to pay the price along the ( boards ) and down low , &quot; Renney said . &quot; We ' ve got_to stay out of the penalty_box , be patient and dedicate ourselves to a game_plan of strong defense. &quot; This is the first gold-medal experience for most of the Canadians -- only three players are back from the 1992 team that lost the gold medal to the Unified Team -- and they are savoring it . &quot; We came_in as underdogs and nobody expected us to be here , &quot; Hirsch said . &quot; We ' re enjoying ourselves , enjoying the moment , when maybe other teams are feeling the pressure. &quot;</TEXT>
