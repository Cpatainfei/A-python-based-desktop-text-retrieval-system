   <HEADLINE> DECADE OF WARS CLAIMS LIVES OF 1.5 MILLION CHILDREN WORLDWIDE ; VIOLENCE : GLOBAL CONFLICTS TAKE HEAVY TOLL ON THE MOST DEFENSELESS . YOUNG SURVIVORS FACE SHATTERED LIVES , LOSS OF INNOCENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From the battlefields of Bosnia to the killing fields of Cambodia and Rwanda , more_than 1.5 million children around the world have been killed by wars over the past decade . The millions who survive face an often uncaring world that cannot cope_with their wounded hearts and shattered lives . They cry_out_for parents who are dead or missing , for homes that have been blasted into rubble , for stolen childhoods filled with gunfire instead of laughter . Mohammed Ajmal , 12 , was trying to forget Afghanistan ' s civil_war and indulge in one of the joys of childhood -- flying a kite -- when a rocket exploded in the yard of his house in Kabul , ripping his chest with shrapnel . For more_than a month , he has lain in the Indira Gandhi Children ' s Hospital , which was hit by 62 rockets this year . There is no chest surgeon and his family has no money to go abroad for an operation . When Nejra Sprzo was 15 , her mother put her , her brother and five cousins on a bus from Sarajevo , Bosnia , to Zagreb , Croatia , where their grandmother lives . Her mother promised Nejra they would be back in a week and she would get a new dress . That was more_than two years ago . Last April , when telephone_lines to Sarajevo were finally restored , Nejra told her mother : &quot; Mummy , I ' m not your little_girl anymore . Don ' t worry about us . We learned how to take_care of ourselves. &quot; Beata Uwimana , 11 , is one of an estimated 100 # 000 Rwandan children who are separated from their families . The youngest of six children , she lost her parents and five brothers and sisters in the chaos at the Rwanda-Zaire border when 1 million Rwandans fled the civil_war in July . Ruth Nyirandenzi , 29 , found Beata wandering on a road near Goma , a Zairian border town , and took her to the Mugunga Refugee Camp to share a tiny hut with her two children . Shyly , Beata said she wants to return to school -- but most of all she wants to find_out if any of her family survived the cholera epidemic that killed an estimated 50 # 000 refugees in the Goma camps . &quot; Nine out of 10 casualties of war are civilians , and children are very often the main casualties , &quot; said Mike Aaronson , overseas director for the relief group Save the Children . Four million children have been disabled , maimed , blinded or brain-damaged in over 100 conflicts during the past decade , the group said in a recent report , &quot; Children at War. &quot; Twelve million have lost their homes . Five million are living_in refugee camps . One million are separated from their families . During rebel sieges of cities in Angola , relief agencies were so flooded with starving children that only the severely malnourished -- &quot; those a step away from death , &quot; said Ronald Fourcaud of Doctors Without Borders -- could be given a bowl of corn meal a day . About 7 # 000 children live_on their own on the streets of Angola ' s capital , Luanda , scrounging for food and falling prey to drugs , sexual abuse and disease . &quot; We ' re seeing 14-year-olds turning_up with gonorrhea , &quot; said Barbara Reynolds , an official with UNICEF . In Afghanistan , where children have one of the world ' s lowest literacy rates and most schools are closed , many youngsters take terrible risks to survive . Some have taken_on adult jobs at metalwork shops . But running food and other supplies across the front_lines is the main way to make money in besieged Kabul , and up_to 3 # 000 people , many young boys , risk their lives daily . &quot; I am always afraid of the rockets and mortars , but my father does not make enough to feed the family , &quot; said Shiralam , 13 . He works with his friend , Aziz , 12 , so they can carry more on their bicycle , which was laden with a huge bag of flour . Shiralam can make the equivalent of $ 2 a day . His ambition is to go_back to school , but if he had more money he would like to buy a kite and move his family somewhere safe . Many Afghan teen-agers become soldiers , and most military checkpoints around Kabul are manned by illiterate youths . Child soldiers have been reported in 35 countries over the last decade . Estimates put the number at more_than 200 # 000 , including thousands of girls . In Liberia , UNICEF estimates 6 # 000 children under age 15 are among the 60 # 000 combatants in the 5-year-old civil_war . They are used as cooks , front-line soldiers , executioners and spies . Human_rights groups say most of Liberia ' s child soldiers were forced into combat roles . The rebel groups deny that , claiming they help youngsters by giving them meals , clothes and protection , but children tell of being flogged , raped , drugged and tortured to ensure obedience . Magne Raundalen , a child psychologist who is president of the Norwegian UNICEF Committee and has been visiting war zones for 10 years , said children in southern Sudan are traumatized by long separations from their families . For six years , at least 20 # 000 Sudanese youngsters have trekked long distances across the vast African_nation to escape fighting . Lions and crocodiles devoured some . Bombs and bullets killed others . Many starved to death . Gideon Gatpan Thoar , one of the Sudanese wanderers now in a refugee camp in northern Kenya , said in a book written for UNICEF that he saw people killed and heard the sound of guns constantly . &quot; When I am asleep , they come_into my head like a dream or cinema . That is my suffering , &quot; he said . Save the Children estimates 250 # 000 children have died because of the war in southern Sudan since 1983 . Raundalen said victims of land_mines in Angola &quot; may be the most traumatized children I ' ve seen all_over the world. &quot; Suddenness is a key element in trauma , and those children were suddenly wounded and handicapped for life , he said . &quot; Many of them were numb or paralyzed . When you talked to them , they said , ' I feel nothing. ' This numbness masks all_the horror , &quot; he said . According to Save the Children , 1 million people have been killed by land_mines in the past decade , many of them children who are more vulnerable because of their size and curiosity . Afghanistan , Angola and Cambodia have the most land_mines and highest casualties . Mediha Imamovic , a psychiatrist who works_at the Doctors Without Borders guidance center in Sarajevo , said every child in the Bosnian capital is traumatized . &quot; Our children have suddenly grown_up . They became adults too soon ; they began thinking only in terms of reality . The war overshadowed or completely destroyed their imagination , &quot; she said . When asked what they would like , children in Sarajevo never say chocolate , nice toys or clothes , she said . They want to survive , to have heating and something to eat_at home , and not to become invalids . They fear sniper bullets . In Rwanda , countless thousands of children were among the half-million or more victims of genocide . Some children , assumed by their attackers to be dead from machete wounds , survived for days in a pile of corpses before being found . The Red_Cross has registered 32 # 000 children who are either lost or orphaned . &quot; There are many , many infants . Someone just found them and carried them where they are and we can ' t get any information about where they came from , &quot; said Sarah Hill of Save the Children in Rwanda ' s capital , Kigali . &quot; Some children come unable to talk_about what they experienced . Others can ' t speak or have gone mad or are confused. &quot; In most countries at war , children name one or two close family members who have died , but many Rwandan children can name 20 close family members who were slain , said Raundalen , the UNICEF psychologist . &quot; What was worse was that 56 % of the 207 children we interviewed in Nyamata had seen children participate in the killings . . . and 42 % had seen children killing children , &quot; he said . UNICEF ' s Reynolds said it is impossible to help most of the estimated 1.5 million Angolan children traumatized by years of combat because many have fled to the bush . Some of those she has seen are withdrawn into stupor , others into hyperactive aggressiveness and violence . &quot; Children in almost every major Angolan city have been subjected_to weeks of artillery bombardment , seen their parents killed , watched a sibling starve to death , &quot; she said . Helping the children of war takes time and training , Raundalen said . Children who have lost trust in the adult world need to know &quot; there is a last father left , the international community , &quot; he said . They must be allowed to unburden their grief , and those who are alone need &quot; kind adults who can represent stability and continuity and commitment to the child. &quot; In dealing with Iraqi children after the Gulf War , Raundalen told Muslim religious_leaders to urge parents to put their children on their laps and tell all their worries and bad memories to Allah . &quot; We get feedback that now the children are sleeping better , &quot; he said . Imamovic , the psychiatrist in Sarajevo , said she talks to children and has them draw about their experiences and hopes .</TEXT>
