   <HEADLINE> WITH THEIR BEST FEET FORWARD ; THEY ARE 3 SHOEMAKERS INTERESTED IN MAKING A BETTER SHOE -- AND PASSIONATE ABOUT BUILDING A BETTER WORLD ; PAUL FIREMAN , REEBOK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Their common professional calling consists_of cushioning the human_foot ' s contact with the ground . They are cobblers , shoe magnates who might well be content to lace_up their hefty profits and let others fret about mankind ' s moral bunions . But Paul Fireman , Bruce Katz and Sheri Poe are three shoemakers with soul . Beyond their chosen line of endeavor they share little but the geography of New England . Yet in each of these footwear manufacturers , entrepreneurial acumen has fueled an equal appetite for social activism . Their causes are varied . Fireman , chief_executive_officer of Reebok International Ltd. , has taken_on human_rights as his personal and corporate mission . Katz , co-founder of Rockport Shoes , sold_out of the shoe biz and used the money to leap into the arena of community change via on-line communication . Poe , founder of Ryka Inc. , is a rape survivor and has dedicated herself to the goal of ending violence against women . Fireman -- only partially in jest -- offered regional similarities as a possible explanation for their high level of social consciousness . &quot; Maybe it ' s something in the water , &quot; he said . &quot; And if it is , we should spread it around. &quot; Here are these shoemakers ' stories . Just a dozen or so years ago , Paul Fireman is entirely comfortable admitting , he would n ' t have recognized social responsibility if it had come calling_at his door . &quot; I ' d never heard of it , &quot; said the 50-year-old Fireman , who was raised in a family of shoe manufacturers in the gritty hamlet of Brockton , Mass . &quot; I didn ' t even know the words. &quot; Fireman , who today continues to fight a middle-aged bulge despite a serious golf habit and frequent trips to the company gym , knew only that &quot; I wanted to make a difference. &quot; And why not ? Reebok , after all , was going gangbusters ; Fireman had acquired an athletic shoe business just when health-obsessed Americans began insisting on entire wardrobes of high-priced , sport-specific footwear . In 1981 , Reebok recorded $ 1.5 million in sales . Five years later , the figure had grown to $ 916 million . But to Fireman , meteoric profits were not inconsistent with an altruistic company spirit . &quot; From Day One , &quot; he said , &quot; I didn ' t want this to look_like , taste like or smell like an American corporation of the ' 50s , ' 60s or ' 70s. &quot; He was a onetime shoe salesman , not some senescent social protester . Even so , &quot; I had grown to hate the mainstream world , with all_the compromises you had to make just to show_up at the front_door . I thought Reebok should operate slightly differently. &quot; Well aware of the boss ' s philosophy , Reebok ' s ad_agency approached Fireman in 1986 with a proposal to sponsor an international rock_music tour for Amnesty International . &quot; It seemed like a good idea , &quot; Fireman decided , even if $ 10 million was a lot of money for a_few concerts . Little did Fireman realize when he agreed to sponsor Amnesty ' s Human_Rights Now World Concert Tour -- featuring such celebrities as Bruce Springsteen , Peter Gabriel and Sting -- that a funny thing would happen on the way to the tour . &quot; We got bit by the bug , &quot; Fireman said in a 1992 speech at the Columbia University Business_School . &quot; Amnesty opened our eyes , and we became passionate about human rights. &quot; The feeling was not initially mutual from the human_rights community . &quot; They were skeptical to the extreme , &quot; Fireman said . &quot; They kept us in_abeyance &quot; -- a polite understatement , Fireman conceded . &quot; We were suits . They held_in disdain the business_community as_a_whole . In their minds , we were businessmen who did all_the wrong things. &quot; Better , Fireman was gently informed , to stick_to the traditional &quot; side-door &quot; route of quietly pouring money into existing foundations . No thanks , Fireman said . In 1988 , he initiated the annual Reebok Human_Rights Awards , offering no-strings-attached grants of $ 25 # 000 to people 30 or younger who were making &quot; significant contributions to the cause of human_rights -- often against great odds. &quot; The Rev . Carl Washington of Los Angeles was a 1993 winner , recognized for his leadership in curbing violence after the 1992 riots . * Fireman -- often with one of his Human_Rights Award board_members , former President Jimmy_Carter , by his side -- was more_than just the guy who handed_out the checks . He was also the CEO who made_sure that human_rights production standards were in place at 40 Reebok-affiliated facilities around the world , and who made_sure that &quot; business decisions were made inclusive of human rights. &quot; Publicly traded Reebok ' s profits were flat in 1993 , and some hard-eyed corporate analysts and executives wondered about this father of three -- married to the same wife since forever -- who didn ' t look a bit like Ben or Jerry yet still preached a do-gooder doctrine . &quot; Is it good business ? &quot; Fireman asked . &quot; I don ' t know if it sells any more shoes , but I don ' t think that ' s our intention. &quot; Fireman is entirely aware that he might just as well have opted for a more benign cause than the social ills of East Timor , Kurdistan , Mozambique and even these United States . But he is adamant that &quot; we didn ' t do this to become powerful . We did_it to do some good . We did_it to change the world. &quot; And anyway , he said , &quot; It feels better . What the heck ? &quot;</TEXT>
