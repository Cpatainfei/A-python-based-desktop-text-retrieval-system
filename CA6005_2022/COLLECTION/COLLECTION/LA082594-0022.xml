   <HEADLINE> SALAD ; LETTUCE : ENJOY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The salad_bowl -- a big , old ironstone washbasin with a wreath of roses around the edge -- is_full to overflowing with tender lettuces . Some are sweet and soft , others crisp and juicy . The colors are a tapestry of bright and dark greens , with hints of bronze , ivory and gold . The lightest veil of cream and lemon and a sprinkling of snipped chives is enough to dress the whole_lot . When it comes_to home-grown lettuce , Alice B . Toklas had it right : &quot; The first gathering of the garden in May of salads , radishes and herbs made me feel_like a mother about her baby -- how could anything so beautiful be mine ? &quot; Look_at them sparkling with dew in the morning light : the red-tinged frills of Lollo Rossa and emerald ovals of Little Gem , the chartreuse roses of old-fashioned Boston Bibb . . . Just listen to Angelo Pellegrini . In &quot; The Food Lover ' s Garden , &quot; now deservedly a classic , that ardent eater suggests harvesting lettuces when the heads are half grown -- of good size and color but still firm and tender with youth . &quot; Their very appearance then , &quot; he says , &quot; will tempt one to bend to the ground and eat them in the manner of a blissful ruminant. &quot; * The lettuce list would just about fill the food section if every variety were named . There are hundreds , possibly thousands , from heat-tolerant Apollo to super-hardy Winter Marvel , but all are members of the same species , Lactuca_sativa , one of the oldest vegetables in cultivation . Lettuce comes from the Latin word for milk ( lac ) , because of the milky juice exuded by its leaves and stalks when cut . Over time three main categories have been developed : L . sativa var . capitata , head_lettuce ( also known as cabbage lettuce , because of its tightly folded head ) ; L . sativa var longifolia , romaine ( also known as Cos , from the Greek island of Kos , its supposed home ) ; and L . sativa var . crispa , leaf_lettuce ( also known as looseleaf , cutting lettuce or cut-and-come , because of its relaxed appearance and willingness to keep growing new leaves as fast as the outer ones are harvested . Mesclun or Misticanza is not a single type of lettuce but a mixture of baby leaves , predominantly lettuce but often including cress , endive , dandelion , roquette , mustard , chervil and other herbs . Once unknown outside of fancy restaurants , mesclun is becoming widely available in produce sections , usually sold loose by the pound , sometimes packed in plastic bags . Be sure the leaves are whole and sound -- some unscrupulous packers bulk out the mix with cut-up material , which shortens shelf_life and should not command mesclun ' s premium price . There ' s not much nourishment in lettuce , although the dark-green types do provide a bit of Vitamin_A . Lettuce is , however , a famous soporific . If you demand that food have value beyond flavor , keep_in mind the following , from &quot; Kettner ' s Book of the Table &quot; ( London , 1877 ) : * &quot; The chemists obtain from the lettuce an inspissated ( condensed ) juice -- called sometimes lactucarium , sometimes lettuce-opium -- which is said to allay pain , to slacken the pulse , to reduce animal heat , and to conduce to sleep . When Adonis died , it is reported that Venus threw herself on a lettuce-bed to lull her grief and cool her desires. &quot; Growing first-class lettuce is easy and quick . Buying_it at the farmers market is even easier and quicker . The thing that matters is that the stuff be local . Except for iron iceberg and industrial-strength romaine , lettuce is delicate , a poor shipper and a poor keeper . Buy_it fresh , keep it cold and eat it quickly . * Cream coats salad_greens without making them soggy . Use balsamic vinegar if the greens have strong flavors , lemon if they ' re more delicate . CREAM DRESSING FOR TENDER GREENS 1 / 3 cup whipping cream , preferably not ultrapasteurized 2 tablespoons lemon_juice or 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 / 2 teaspoon salt 1 / 8 teaspoon Dijon mustard Tiny dash sugar , if using lemon_juice Beat cream , lemon_juice , salt , mustard and sugar in bottom of bowl . Dressing will thicken as cream curdles . Add prepared greens and toss well , using fingers to avoid bruising leaves . Makes about 1 / 2 cup dressing , enough for about 2 quarts of lightly piled tender salad_greens , 4 to 6 generous servings . Each 1-tablespoon serving contains about : 35 calories ; 153 mg sodium ; 14 mg cholesterol ; 4 grams fat ; 1 grams carbohydrates ; trace protein ; trace fiber .</TEXT>
