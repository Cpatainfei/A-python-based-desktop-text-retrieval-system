   <HEADLINE> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK : PROMISING DRIVERS TAKE THE EUROPEAN ROUTE TO BIG TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is not a single road to the top for an American race driver in Indy car or Formula One racing . Most of today ' s crop -- Al Unser Jr. , Michael Andretti and Robby Gordon -- chose the old-fashioned way and moved_up through U.S. series -- Super Vee , Formula Ford , Barber Saab . Or , in Gordon ' s case , off-road trucks . A few , notably Bobby Rahal and Danny Sullivan , headed overseas to hone their talents in the highly competitive European Formula Three and Formula Two series before returning home to race Indy cars . Two young Southern Californians , Zak Brown of North Hollywood and Elton Julian of Beverly Hills , are taking the European route . Both had electrifying victories as teen-agers . Brown , 22 , won the first race he entered in England , a Formula Ford 1600 event in the rain at Donington Park . In a field of 60 , he started sixth , took the lead_on the first lap and led all_the way . When it was over , an enthusiastic British journalist exclaimed , &quot; You ' re the next ( Ayrton ) Senna. &quot; Brown was 18 . &quot; I believed him , &quot; Brown remembered . &quot; But I ' ve sobered_up since then. &quot; Julian , 20 , became the youngest driver to win in the_British Formula Three championships when he was 17 and drove a Ralt to victory for the Alan Docking team at Thruxton . It was a bittersweet triumph for the teen-ager . Only two weeks earlier , he had been involved in a racing accident in which his teammate , Marcel Albers of the_Netherlands , was killed . &quot; This one ' s for you , Marcel , &quot; Julian said in the winner ' s circle . Both Brown and Julian started their careers at the Jim Hall Racing School for kart drivers in Oxnard , but they are going_in different directions today . Brown is working toward Indy cars , while Julian , a true internationalist who was born in the Canary Islands of an Armenian father and Ecuadorean mother , will make his debut in Formula One next season . Julian recently tested two days with the Tourtel Larrousse team at the Paul Ricard circuit in France , and when his lap times were quicker than those of Hideki Noda and Jean Dennis Deletraz , he was signed_on as the team ' s test driver for 1995 . &quot; We are hoping he will be the team ' s No . 2 driver when the racing season starts , &quot; said his father , Arman , a former television sports producer . Julian drove a Lola in the final three races of the European Formula Three series before testing for the Larrousse ride . Brown will have a busy 1995 schedule , racing in both the European Formula Three and the Toyota Atlantic series in the United States . &quot; I ' m doing both because I don ' t want to lose sight of my main goal , which is Indy , and yet I don ' t want to lose my contacts in Europe where I ' ve done my best driving , &quot; Brown said . His best showing this year was a second in a Formula Three support race to the_British Grand Prix before 100 # 000 spectators at Silverstone . Briefly SPRINT CARS -- Ron Shuman , winner of six of the last seven Sprint Car_Racing Assn . events , will try to maintain his 31-point lead over Rip Williams for the championship of the inaugural SCRA season in Saturday night ' s main event at Ventura Raceway . Only one event remains after Ventura , the Quaker State Classic at the Imperial County Fairgrounds in Imperial Nov . 25-26 . DRAG RACING -- The R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . is doubling its prize_money for the Winston Drag Racing Series in 1995 to $ 2 million to showcase its 20th year with the National Hot Rod Assn . Top-fuel and funny car champions will each receive $ 200 # 000 and the pro stock winner will get $ 125 # 000 . . . . When Kenny Berstein made the first 300-m.p.h. pass_on March 20 , 1992 , it was like getting the first olive out of the jar . In last week ' s Winston Select Finals at Pomona , there were 19 runs of 300 or better . . . . Named to the McDonald ' s all-star team , as selected by fans , were Don Prudhomme , top fuel ; John Force , funny car ; Darrell Alderman , pro stock , and David Schultz , pro motorcycle . . . . Oldsmobile announced that it will drop_out of drag racing after the 1995 season . MIDGETS -- Two races remain in the U.S. Auto Club ' s Western States series , Nov . 19 at Ventura and Nov . 24 , the Turkey Night Grand Prix , at Bakersfield , but John Cofer of Macdoel , Calif. , has already clinched the championship . . . .
