   <HEADLINE> EATS OF EDEN ; BOUNTY HUNTERS FEAST THEIR EYES , ETC. , ON THE HEAVENLY SPREADS OF THE BUFFET LINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Consider the buffet , from humble steam table to grand hotel feast . Why is it we run wild at the very sight of one , as soon as we pick_up a plate ? My first memorable buffet happened while I was an exchange student in 1970 . In that year , I visited Stockholm ' s Operakalleren , home to the most lavish smorgasbord in Europe . Inside , amid the luxurious decor , I glimpsed the royally laden tables , then panic set_in . No one had told me where to begin . A kindly maitre d ' saved the day . He saw my problem and stepped_in , explaining the smorgasbord ' s proper etiquette . &quot; First eat the iced dishes and smoked fish , &quot; he said , &quot; then eat the cold dishes , composed salads and jellied meats. &quot; I took his advice , gratefully , working my way up_to hot dishes such_as dilled potatoes , Swedish_meatballs , reindeer steak and beef with onions . The food was incredible , and I relished it , right up_to the moment the bill arrived and I discovered I had blown two weeks ' worth of expense money . Since then , I ' ve had deck buffets aboard ships , breakfast buffets in Las Vegas and , this year , a terrific barbecue buffet at Maurice Bessinger ' s in Charleston , S.C. , where unlimited platefuls of breaded catfish , Southern fried chicken and mustard-colored pork come_to less than $ 6 . These days , I ' m careful to do any buffet in several stages , combining dishes scientifically , so the foods don ' t clash . Unfortunately , er , I still eat too_much . What follows is only a small sampling of the buffets in our area , but I hope it ' s a good cross-section . Many types of restaurants , from Sizzler on up , have salad_bars so complete they are effectively buffets themselves . In addition , upscale supermarkets such_as Vons Pavilions and Irvine Ranch have special salad areas where customers can choose items and pay by the pound , making_it easy to eat buffet-style at_home . So enjoy , and remember to eat slowly . You can always go_back for more . The Terrace Buffet at the Ritz-Carlton The mother of all Orange County brunches is this outrageous , almost otherworldly buffet , which carries with it an astronomical price_tag . Anyone looking_for that big blowout or a truly celebratory experience should find this grand Sunday feast satisfies all requirements . Where outside Stockholm would you find a smoked fish and caviar bord like this one ? There are three kinds of caviar , home-cured salmon , smoked mahi-mahi , trout and assorted fixings ; cream_cheese , chopped egg , capers , onions , blini , sour_cream and a half_dozen varieties of mini-bagels . That , by the way , is only a corner of this buffet . On a sunny day , foods are layed_out by the downstairs pool , and the tables appear to stretch almost endlessly . One table has fresh oysters and iced prawns , another Caesar_salad tossed to order by a chef . How about an omelet man to cater to your every conceivable whim ? You want roast meats , they ' ve got ' em , hand-carved and plated with spicy , exotic chutneys . Try leg_of_lamb with the unctuous mango chutney , or garlic-and-herb-studded tenderloin of beef topped with a rich mushroom reduction . Breakfast meats and hot dishes are next : perfect eggs Benedict with a textbook Hollandaise and runny center yolk , spicy Italian sausage , braised chicken with shredded cabbage , tiny waffles accompanied by jars of real maple_syrup . And don ' t forget the dessert buffet , overflowing with impossibly rich French_pastries , tiramisu , rum_babas and sauces . The hotel has a wine list loaded with an international selection of fine vintage wines , not to mention service that is snappy and professional . The buffet ' s clientele is well-heeled , but that doesn ' t stop a casual crowd from infiltrating . For those who want a taste but can ' t rationalize this much luxury , an abbreviated , more moderately priced buffet ( $ 25 ) is served in the hotel ' s Lobby Lounge . Ritz-Carlton Hotel , 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive , Dana Point . ( 714 ) 240-5008 . Buffet Sunday only , 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Adults , $ 38.50 ; children under 12 , $ 19.25. All major cards accepted . Country Harvest Buffet Meanwhile , at the other end of the pricing spectrum , there is Country Harvest Buffet , a growing new chain with three Orange County locations . The Costa Mesa store is bright , cheerful and almost always filled with families and seniors . It ' s safe to say there isn ' t much overlap between the crowd you bump_into here and the one nibbling on caviar and oysters in Dana Point . Except , maybe , for the way both groups pile_up their plates . But there is no shortage of conviviality , from the cheerful hostesses who show you to your narrow , Formica-topped table , to the managers in white shirts ( who minister to the food stations by remote microphone , making_sure items are replenished when they run_low ) . And most of the people eating here seem quite happy . Because when it comes_to bang for the buck , Country Harvest Buffet has to be called a bargain . Are there actually good things to eat here ? Well , a_few . Mostly , though , it is glorified cafeteria fare . Here ' s how it works . You stand_in a line , sometimes a long one , to pay . Inside , you are free to hit the various food islands as often as you like . Anyone who has been to a casino buffet in Vegas should be familiar_with this format . One island has cold salads such_as ambrosia , corn_salad and cole slaw ; another has hot dishes , another is sumptuously laden with desserts . Featured dishes change according to the day_of_the_week : Fridays , for instance , it ' s Maryland crab cakes , clam_chowder and fried shrimp ; Saturdays , roast_pork loin with apple prune dressing and barbecued beef ribs , among other things . Most foods taste mass-produced , but there are exceptions . Pull a piece of corn bread from the center of the pan , and it will be fluffy and delicious , a fine complement for the house roast chicken , another good bet . The pork_loin and apple prune dressing cannot be faulted , nor can roasted potatoes , blueberry muffins and roast_beef . Avoid anything fried and especially anything posing as Italian . For dessert , try chocolate_fudge pudding cake , or better yet , the perfectly decent apple crisp . If you leave here hungry , you are even pickier than I . Country Harvest Buffet has three O.C. locations : 1630 W . Katella Ave. , Anaheim , ( 714 ) 539-2234 ; 2300 Harbor Blvd. , Costa Mesa , ( 714 ) 631-2235 ; 1008 E . 17th St. , Santa Ana , ( 714 ) 541- 3020 . Breakfast Saturday and Sunday , 8 to 11 a.m. ; lunch Monday through Friday , 10:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. , and Saturday , 11:30 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. ; dinner Monday through Saturday , 3 to 9 p.m. , and Sunday , 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Breakfast is $ 5.49 ( $ 4.99 for seniors ) ; lunch , $ 5.39 ( $ 4.89 for seniors ) ; dinner , $ 6.89 ( $ 6.05 for seniors ) . MasterCard and Visa accepted . New Seoul B.B.Q. Buffet Korean cuisine is a natural for the buffet format , and this spotlessly clean Korean barbecue house has the most appealing format I ' ve yet seen in an Asian restaurant . It ' s a quantum leap forward from the typically gruesome Chinese steam table buffet , where almost everything is fried in cornstarch or drenched in dark soy_sauce . Furthermore , you get_to do the cooking yourself . The smiling waitresses take drink orders , turn_on your individual charcoal braziers and bring you hot bean soup alongside a mound of steaming white_rice . You then hit the buffet line , piling your plate with uncooked Korean meats and seafoods -- kalbi ( short ribs ) , bulgogi ( marinated beef ) , shrimp , eel , mussels , squid -- and vegetables like scallions , spinach , bean_sprouts , pickled garlic and green_salad . Plus fresh orange slices to refresh the palate . Then you head to your table and place items in the middle of the brazier , cooking them up_to your heart ' s desire . ( Oh , but don ' t cook the chap chae , slippery cold noodles with sesame dressing . It ' s a side dish. ) The quality and hygiene is top-notch , and it ' s all good fun . Being that this is a Korean cuisine , expect that many of the proteins ( especially spicy pork and the squid ) will have been given an intense bath in garlic and chili . You will also find several of the cuisine ' s notoriously odoriferous kimchi ( vegetables pickled with dried shrimp , hot_pepper and garlic ) on the restaurant ' s extensive condiment line , ones fashioned from cabbage , radish and more . Eat them with abandon , but be warned that the fruit-flavored gum you get_at the cash_register on your way_out will not go_a_long_way toward erasing the evidence . New Seoul B.B.Q. Buffet , 9902 Garden Grove Blvd. , Garden Grove . ( 714 ) 537-9902 . Lunch Monday through Friday , 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. ; dinner Monday through Friday , 3 to 10:30 p.m. , and Saturday and Sunday , 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Lunch , $ 6.50 ; dinner , $ 10.95. MasterCard and Visa accepted . Marmac ' s This is a dark , clubby restaurant with real brick walls , semicircular black booths and softly tinkling cocktail piano music ; in short , the sort of ambience popularized by Velvet Turtle during the ' 70s . From the restaurant ' s fortress-like exterior , it is the last place you ' d ever expect to find a toqued chef ladling out brown gravy . But that ' s what awaits you ( unless you decide to order a_la_carte from the menu , which is predominantly steak and seafood ) . What makes Marmac ' s special is the hand-carved prime rib -- a good one -- included in this buffet . A carving chef will cleave a thick pink slab , oozing juices , off a huge standing_rib_roast . You get_to enjoy it with good trimmings , too : terrific , yeasty rolls , spinach salad with a fine hot bacon dressing , even whole baked potatoes , steaming in their foil wrappers . Pass_on most of the filler , though . The tired-looking salad_bar , for instance , is composed of things like cold pastas and runny cole slaw , while three or four dishes like dry roast chicken or starchy , overly creamy fettuccine with seafood make_up the hot section . For what it is worth , Marmac ' s changes these dishes daily , though the prime rib is available every day . Desserts are equally uninspiring , save one . Amid the sheet cakes and milk_powder puddings , you ' ll find a small freezer stocked with Carnation vanilla_ice_cream . Scoop yourself some , then top it with Hershey ' s chocolate_syrup and multicolored sprinkles . At these prices , you ' ll swear you ' ve walked into your own party . Marmac ' s , 12777 Knott St. , Garden Grove . ( 714 ) 898-5645 . Lunch Monday through Saturday , 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. , and Sunday , 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. ; dinner Monday through Saturday , 4 to 10 p.m. , and Sunday , 3:30 to 10 p.m. Lunch buffet is $ 5.95. Dinner buffet : Monday through Wednesday , $ 6.95 ( without prime rib ) or $ 12.95 ( with ) ; Thursday through Sunday , $ 9.95 ( without prime rib ) or $ 12.95 ( with ) . American Express , MasterCard and Visa accepted . The Clay Oven The lunch buffet has long been a standard in Indian restaurants , partly to bolster business for the evening trade , and partly because these curries and stewed vegetable dishes are_well suited to the steam table . Praveen Bansal ' s Clay Oven is one of the most pleasant of the county ' s Indian restaurants , giving excellent value for the dollar . It ' s a cheerful , elegant little room stuck_in the middle of an Irvine mini-mall , uncharacteristically ( for an Indian restaurant ) doubling as a showcase gallery for local artists . During lunch , the restaurant is_well lit , and the management plays soft ragas over a sound_system . No wonder so many patrons linger well past the lunch hour . You ' ll find the usual suspects on this buffet line , but they are done with atypical lightness and flavor . There is always chicken from the tandoor -- the restaurant ' s eponymous clay oven -- at least one green vegetable dish and mounds of fluffy basmati rice . The day I sampled the buffet , there were stewed yellow lentils , curried chicken , spinach with potato , a refreshing yogurt dip called raita , several kinds of fresh cut vegetables , hot flat bread from the oven and a creamy , almond-rich rice pudding for dessert . Sundays , when the Indian clientele comes_out in_force , the buffet includes fruits and an expanded vegetarian section . The good news is that the price remains the same all week . The Clay Oven , 15435 Jeffrey Road , Irvine . ( 714 ) 552-2851 . Lunch buffet served daily , 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. $ 6.50. American Express , MasterCard and Visa accepted . Souplantation In my view , this is the best of the chains doing soup , salad and pasta buffets . You don ' t get as much protein for your dollar as you do at a Country Harvest Buffet , but according to nutritionists , you don ' t really need that much . Furthermore , any time I ' ve eaten_in a Souplantation , the food has been fresh and high_quality . In October , hot pastas were added_to the already bountiful format , which has always included a variety of cold pastas such_as shrimp tarragon with a rich mayonnaise-based dressing . Sauces and pasta shapes change weekly ; the last time I visited I found a hearty salsa Bolognese as well as marinara and a creamy primavera Alfredo , all waiting to douse my radiatore and linguine . The long salad_bar is the base of operations for many people who come here , and it invariably has several types of greens , 10 dressings , 11 &quot; fresh cuts &quot; or fresh vegetables , eight prepared salads such_as the pastas , herbed barley salad and carrot-raisin salad , plus prepared salads , which could be sesame-flavored won-ton chicken or Caesar . At the soup station , chili , chicken noodle and clam_chowder are the standbys , available every day . A vegetarian soup such_as black_bean or minestrone is always available , too , plus a wild card soup that might be anything : cream of broccoli , Irish_potato leek . . . you get the idea . Add_to this great blueberry muffins , two kinds of Italian focaccia , fruits , puddings , yogurts , soft-serve ice_cream , several fat-free choices and at dinner only , a baked potato bar , and you ' ve got something for everyone . Souplantation , 111179 Talbert Ave. , Fountain Valley , ( 714 ) 434-1814 . ( Additional O.C. franchises are in Brea , Costa Mesa , Garden Grove , Laguna Niguel and Tustin. ) Open Sunday through Thursday , 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. , Friday and Saturday till 10 p.m. Lunch , $ 5.99 ; dinner ( from 4 p.m. ) , $ 7.19. Children under 12 , $ 3.99 any time . MasterCard and Visa accepted .</TEXT>
