   <HEADLINE> EDISON DEAL SEEKS TO AVOID POWER AUCTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprise move to stave_off a disputed power-purchase auction mandated by state regulators , Southern California Edison Co . reached a separate agreement Tuesday to buy power from one of the bidders : Kenetech Corp. , a wind energy company . Edison has asked the state Public_Utilities Commission , which is_due to consider the controversial auction at a San Francisco meeting today , to approve its preliminary agreement to buy 500 megawatts of power from San Francisco-based Kenetech and throw_out the other bids . Under the agreement , the first 250 megawatts of power would be purchased only after Edison customers -- perhaps by polling -- approved paying higher rates for the energy . The second_half would be bought later than the auction requires . In all , Edison would be buying just 60 % of the energy that was to be purchased at the auction . In January , Edison petitioned the commission to free it entirely from the auction , mandated under a PUC requirement that the state ' s major investor-owned utilities meet part of their future needs with electricity from wind , solar , geothermal or biomass sources . San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co . and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co . had disputed other aspects of the bidding process . But Edison contended that it did not need the extra power -- it already buys more_than 23 % of its electricity from renewable sources -- and that buying_it under the terms of the auction would increase ratepayers ' costs . The PUC auction could cost Edison customers as much as $ 500 million more , said Vikram Budhraja , an Edison vice_president . Before the agreement , Kenetech was a strong critic of Edison ' s position . &quot; What we have done is negotiated an agreement with Edison that goes beyond what we would have been awarded &quot; under the preliminary rankings in the bidding , said Clarence Grebey , Kenetech spokesman . &quot; The pricing is different than would be required under the ( PUC ) formula. &quot; Harold F . Koegler , president of San Rafael-based FloWind Corp , a rival wind energy firm , said his company will petition the PUC to require that FloWind be included in the negotiations . &quot; We are shocked by this last-minute activity to try to do an end_run , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
