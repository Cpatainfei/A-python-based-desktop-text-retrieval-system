   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : THESE WOMEN WERE DREAMERS AND DOERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If perseverance , determination , broken dreams and heady triumphs help describe the entertainment_industry , then the Hollywood La Brea Gateway is a lasting tribute to the spirit and world-renowned allure that make_up the Hollywood image . Art is truly subject_to interpretation . When Times Art Critic Christopher Knight reviewed the Gateway , he lambasted it for its presentation of women , referring to it as multicultural sexism and much more . Yet when I looked_at the work I said , &quot; Hallelujah ! It ' s about time. &quot; Never in my wildest dreams did I believe I ' d ever see women of color immortalized in such a creative and wonderful fashion . The Art Deco style , neon , glitzy , gutsy approach to the gateway design makes me think_of the Hollywood embedded in my soul ; a place of magic , wonder and imagination . But the mere presence of these brave , gifted women reflects the reality of Hollywood . The sculptural figures supporting the dome -- Dorothy Dandridge , Anna May Wong , Mae West and Dolores Del Rio -- are more_than mere sex symbols or glamour girls . Their individual histories mark them as daring , courageous and determined . These enormously talented women took_on a town that created false images in the midst of hate , racism and prejudice . Knight , in blasting the use of these women , offered instead Hattie McDaniel and Margaret Dumont , believing them to be more representative of women in Hollywood . It is true McDaniel is an Oscar-winning legend ; however , she epitomized the Hollywood stereotype of black_women of that era . Her screen image was most comforting to white America and did not challenge the film_industry ' s campaign of viewing the black_woman as less than desirable . Dandridge ' s image not only added balance but demonstrated to Hollywood that indeed America and the world could celebrate a black_woman . Wong and Del Rio faced the same challenges and prejudice on behalf of their cultures . West battled the age and control factor . Their beauty and intelligence were held against them , making_it difficult to find meaningful work that wasn ' t reduced to racial stereotypes or cultural myths . All four women took_charge of their dreams and made film history against tremendous odds . * Dandridge , for instance , gained national and international stardom for her Oscar-nominated performance in &quot; Carmen Jones &quot; at a time when America was desperately clinging_to Jim Crow laws and an apartheid system that also reached_into the Latin and Asian communities . But they were dreamers and doers . And for one fleeting moment they forced Hollywood to deal with them on_their_own terms . They opened_doors , challenged old beliefs and fought the good fight for balanced screen images . These women carried a tremendous burden on their feminine shoulders with only a hint of fragility . In essence , they had the strength of the universe . Hats off to creator Catherine Hardwicke for her vision and courage to create a work_of_art that breaks new ground in mainstream Hollywood . She gave us a double treat , the magic and history of Hollywood in the form of pioneering women . For everyone who has ever dreamed of Hollywood fame , for those down to their last dime but holding_on . . . . For writers , producers , directors wishing to express their visions , and for those of us who are simply not connected or &quot; just not right &quot; for this or that , let these women be your shining beacons of hope . And don ' t you , like the Hollywood of their era , hold their beauty against them . They are Hollywood ' s women of steel .</TEXT>
