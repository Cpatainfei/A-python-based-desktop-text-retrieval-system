   <HEADLINE> NEW PREMIER , COALITION GOVERNMENT TAKE_OVER IN IRELAND , ENDING MONTHLONG CRISIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Irish Parliament elected a new prime_minister and a coalition government Thursday , ending a monthlong political crisis . The new premier is John Bruton , head of the Fine Gael party , which had been in opposition in recent governments headed by Albert Reynolds , leader of the Fianna Fail Party , Ireland ' s largest . Bruton , 47 , who won by an 85-74 vote_in Parliament , will head a coalition that includes the Democratic Left Party and the Labor_Party , which had been in previous coalition governments . The crisis began when Reynolds lost a parliamentary vote_of_confidence because of his handling of a child-molestation case involving a Roman_Catholic priest . But Bruton did not sail easily into the new post : Democratic Left members spent the day arguing about whether they should join the government because they wanted to be assured of the appropriate number of Cabinet and sub-Cabinet posts in the new administration . The Fine Gael Party ' s ties to the_Irish Republican Army are not as close as those of the former ruling party , Fianna Fail , but Bruton said Thursday that addressing himself to the Northern_Ireland peace process would be a priority . And Peter Robinson , a member_of_Parliament and proponent of continued British control of Northern_Ireland , said Bruton has a greater understanding of the loyalist position than do most members of the_Irish Parliament . Bertie Ahern , who replaced Reynolds as leader of Fianna Fail , pledged full cooperation with Bruton ' s coalition and paid tribute to Reynolds for his work toward peace in Northern_Ireland . It was Reynolds and British Prime_Minister John Major who offered separatists a place at_peace talks one year ago . Since then , both the IRA and Protestant paramilitary groups have observed a cease-fire in Northern_Ireland , and talks have been held with the_British government . Meanwhile , in Belfast , the_British government held talks with the militant Protestant unionist groups , which are British loyalists , as officials did last week with Sinn Fein , the political arm of the IRA . Officials said the talks had been congenial , though the meeting focused_on the touchy issue of paramilitaries in Northern_Ireland giving_up their weapons and explosives . In London , Major declared in Parliament that terrorist weapons in Northern_Ireland must be &quot; decommissioned and destroyed &quot; before the government enters full-scale talks with either Sinn Fein or loyalist paramilitary groups . He told the House of Commons that he is &quot; not concerned &quot; whether the arms are actually surrendered , as long as they are done_away_with before substantive talks begin .</TEXT>
