   <HEADLINE> TEAM COMPILES BOSNIA ATROCITIES FOR WAR_CRIMES TRIAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Marcia McCormick , the day begins and ends with unforgettable horror . Hour after hour , she pores over pages filled with the words of women whose bodies have been brutalized and souls scarred in war . They are as young as 5 , as old as 81 . All are rape victims in the former Yugoslavia . McCormick , a lawyer , catalogues each of these hundreds of reports into a computer . Her task : to record a first draft of history . Her hope : that the testimony will be a first_step toward justice . She is among about 40 people at DePaul University ' s College of Law compiling a data base of atrocities and aggression in the former Yugoslavia to be used by the prosecution at a United Nations war_crimes tribunal -- the first since Nazi and Japanese leaders were tried after World_War_II . &quot; What we have here is the beginning of historical archives , &quot; said M . Cherif Bassiouni , project director and international_law professor at DePaul . &quot; We owe it to the victims ; we owe it to ourselves in terms of_our_own humanity to make a record of the truth. &quot; Bassiouni began the project in late 1992 after being named to a five-member U.N. commission selected to investigate war_crimes in the former Yugoslavia . Last May , the U.N. Security_Council set_up an 11-judge tribunal at The Hague . DePaul ' s team of lawyers and researchers -- many of them volunteers -- will present to the commission a compendium of cruelty in the Serbian-Muslim-Croatian conflict : more_than 5 # 000 incidents of murder , rape , torture , kidnaping , mass graves and prison_camps . &quot; It ' s the sort of thing one reads about with_respect_to medieval wars and thinks , gee , these things didn ' t really happen , or if they did , they won ' t happen again , &quot; said the Egyptian-born Bassiouni , who has stood among corpses in mass graves and dodged sniper fire during trips to the war zone . &quot; People say these ethnic_groups have been fighting for hundreds of years so it ' s just inherent in their nature . . . but that ' s not the case , &quot; said Mark Bennett , assistant project director . &quot; It shows what human nature is when there are no controls . I think this would happen anywhere in the world given the same set of circumstances -- and that ' s what ' s most frightening. &quot; The DePaul team ' s series of reports has been culled from 63 # 000 pages of documents , including eyewitness and victim testimony , news_stories and reports from governments and human_rights groups such_as Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch . Gathering facts immediately is critical , said Bassiouni , who secured foundation funding and support from DePaul . The United Nations did not provide any money . &quot; People change their views , &quot; he said . &quot; Their perceptions also change . The information disappears . You have to do_it when it ' s fresh in the minds and memories. &quot; Still , some human_rights experts doubt there is the political will and financial resources in the international community for trials . The tribunal still has no top prosecutor or indictments and a February report by Helsinki Watch claimed &quot; the U.N. has delayed and obstructed its ability to function. &quot; But politics isn ' t the focus_on the fourth floor of DePaul ' s International Human_Rights Law Institute , where boxes of affidavits and maps line the halls and walls and staffers sit hunched_over computers , using special software tailored to classify war_crimes in a conflict that has killed up_to 200 # 000 people . Some reports are spare , but shocking : a girl known as K.J. , shot 10 times , bullets piercing her lungs and liver ; the forced evacuation of Croatian patients from a hospital to Ovcara where it is believed 280 prisoners were executed ; a 28-year-old woman raped in an outdoor stadium by 28 Serbs in a single day before she blacked_out . &quot; It ' s a cliche but it comes_back to haunt you , &quot; said McCormick , who is compiling the rape report . &quot; At the beginning it was much easier to be upset when I read ( the testimony ) . . . . Now , I ' ll have a horrible nightmare. &quot; Translators decipher documents in Serbo-Croatian , French or German , but lawyers have a more arduous mission -- trying to find a method in the madness . &quot; Every big case I ' ve worked_on has an element of what I ' m doing -- putting_together a puzzle , &quot; said Penny Venetis , a New York lawyer who tackled savings and loans cases before taking a leave to work_at DePaul . &quot; We ' re trying to figure_out relationships between 700-odd ( prison ) camps we have identified , &quot; she said . If they succeed , the project could be very valuable , said Diane Orentlicher , professor of international_law at American University in Washington , D.C. &quot; What they ' re doing can become state-of-the-art documentation . . . . they ' re creating the potential for tracking the movement of soldiers and showing patterns of abuse that make_it possible to see things you can ' t by looking_at one case , then another one , &quot; she said . The team also will transfer more_than 140 videotapes to CD-ROM , breaking them down frame by frame to identify perpetrators , which sometimes is surprisingly easy . &quot; In areas where some of the worst atrocities occurred , they were carried_out by people who had lived together , &quot; Bennett said . &quot; They knew their perpetrators and , in a lot of instances , they made no attempt to hide their identity. &quot; But identifying them and prosecuting them are two different matters . The tribunal will not try anyone in absentia and governments can ' t be forced to turn_over citizens , though the court ' s president has expressed optimism that they will . Two war-crime suspects are in custody in Denmark and Germany ; two others have been convicted . Bassiouni is confident there will be trials . &quot; The question is how many , how long it will take and how high they will reach , &quot; he said . &quot; If we catch 10 % of the people who committed the crimes and prosecute them . . . the message we will be sending will be extraordinary. &quot;</TEXT>
