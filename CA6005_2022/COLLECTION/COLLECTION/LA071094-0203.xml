   <HEADLINE> WHAT WE WON ' T LEARN FROM OUR RECESSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> None of California ' s candidates have addressed the most important questions of the election : What caused the state ' s recession ? What must government do_in response ? To an extent unmatched in the rest of the country , California ' s recession was , first and foremost , caused by its increasingly dysfunctional relationship with Washington . Fully 50 % of its 600 # 000 job losses resulted from cutbacks in defense . Furthermore , at a time when Californians could least afford it , the Clinton_Administration ' s 1993 budget &quot; reforms &quot; weighed even more heavily against the state . &quot; Deficit reductions &quot; were achieved with huge defense cuts scheduled to take_effect in 1997 -- conveniently after the next presidential election . Meanwhile , income and payroll taxes to support Social_Security , Medicare and Medicaid programs were dramatically increased . Since California is much younger , has a higher cost_of_living and thus generates higher wages than the national norm , the new taxes shifted an additional $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion a year from the state to the rest of the country . Also damaging was a federal trade_policy that severely weakened the dollar , reducing the value of California ' s relatively price-insensitive exports while driving_up the cost of its imports . Finally , a magnificently ill-timed burst of renewed activism by the Environmental Protection Agency took a toll . Recent Bay Delta water-policy interventions sent shock_waves through such California economic mainstays as agriculture , biomedical engineering and textiles -- threatening to weaken the state ' s bond_ratings , which are anchored by the giant Metropolitan Water District agency . To be sure , home-grown factors amplified California ' s problems , the most important of which was the collapse of its manufacturing sector . A generator of 2.1 million jobs in its peak year of 1990 , manufacturing played a critical role in the upward mobility of the state ' s growing Latino and Asian populations . Trouble began in the 1980s , however , when state and local officials enacted a series of often counterproductive , fraud-prone environmental , social-justice and safety legislation that hit manufacturing particularly hard . Even before the recession , manufacturing job growth stagnated during the decade , after rising by nearly 470 # 000 in the 1970s . The bottom fell_out when the worldwide recession cut_into already razor-thin manufacturing margins . Since 1990 , California ' s manufacturing industries have lost a staggering 150 # 000 jobs on top of defense cutbacks . Total manufacturing employment fell by 15 % , to levels not seen since the early 1970s . California ' s political leadership , meanwhile , was so enamored of the fantasy of government-subsidized industrial development that it ignored sectors such_as finance , insurance , real_estate and business services that collectively added 55 # 000 jobs during the recession . Entertainment , electronics , textile and biomedical companies , whose growth might have offset the state ' s manufacturing and defense declines , also suffered from inattention . Then came a self-destructive publicity campaign , led by defense giants , that was eagerly embellished by development officials and media from outside the region . As a result , exaggerated accounts of California ' s decline became conventional wisdom throughout the world . Since a region ' s image crucially affects its international money , trade and technology flows , investors shunned California . Typical were the Japanese , who shifted thousands of jobs to Mexico , reduced tourism and slashed their real-estate investment from $ 3 billion in 1989 to virtually nothing in 1993 . Housing and commercial markets dependent_on positive expectations nose-dived , costing 115 # 000 construction jobs . This profile of California ' s recession suggests a clear political agenda for the state ' s future prosperity . Most critical is to stop looking_to Washington for bailouts that almost certainly will never materialize . Instead , Californians should press for tax parity , insisting , in the least , that increasingly anti-California federal payroll and income levies should be indexed to reflect the higher cost_of_living in the state . And rather than further muddy the complex , delicate issues of water policy or urban development , the federal_government should return to Californians the money and authority required for the state to solve its social and environmental problems on its own terms . To staunch the decline of the manufacturing base , the state must sharpen its regulatory focus and enforce only those measures that unequivocally achieve major environmental and social benefits without generating greater offsetting costs . Companies that paint , plate or otherwise treat metals , for example , are subject_to overwhelmingly complicated oversight requirements even though they contribute minimally to the state ' s overall environmental or safety problems . Such disproportionate regulatory obsessions cost the state thousands of manufacturing jobs and reduce the resources that might otherwise be spent on more pressing needs , such_as developing non-polluting auto fuels and propulsion technologies . Finally , the state must end its self-loathing and immigrant scapegoating . During the last two decades , California has generated greater upward mobility for a more diverse population , and fostered more industries competitive in virtually every major sector of the global economy , than any other region . Regrettably , Gov . Pete Wilson would rather blame Washington ' s immigration policies for his budget woes and , with the approval of Democrats , construct economic_policies around the mirage of a federal panacea . After misleadingly flogging the state ' s economy as &quot; America ' s worst , &quot; Kathleen Brown offers a hodgepodge of new taxes , modest welfare cutbacks and subsidized funds for quasi-public industries , all to be paid_for with the same kind of bond issuances Californians rejected last month . Perhaps the state ' s voters do want to continue their dysfunctional relations with Washington ; heap social mandates on their businesses while supporting only sectors that draw sustenance from government ; wallow in unwarranted despair , and push their burgeoning ethnic populations into the dead-end politics of poverty . But at least they should have a different choice . Rather than the thin economic gruel offered in the current campaign , they deserve a debate about the recession that will generate real solutions , not empty style points , for the problems that exist in California ' s still remarkable economy. *</TEXT>
