   <TEXT> If you were Dana Carvey , you might be happy as hell that George_Bush didn ' t get reelected . Nothing necessarily ideological , mind you , just fewer people on the street or on press junkets pestering you to do just a_few seconds -- please ? -- of the hemming-and-hawing lisp and ineffectual tomahawk chops that made the real Bush finally seem like a parody of Carvey ' s own appropriation on &quot; Saturday Night Live. &quot; A term ' s worth of that , and a Bush breather ought to be welcome for a versatility-loving comic . And yet . . . &quot; Yeah , I ' d done enough of Bush , &quot; Carvey allows , feeling a little more for his spoofee ' s welfare than his own , perhaps . &quot; I think he ' d been beaten_up quite enough , and it was fine to send him off into the night . I ' m working_on my ( Jack ) Kemp . Impressionists gotta get a jump , we gotta think ' Who ' s the front-runner ? ' &quot; But . . . it ' s kind of weird. &quot; An embarrassing admission is imminent . &quot; I find myself going_in a restaurant and thinking ( he breaks_into his best Bush ) , ' Wellll , got a little biscuit . . . ' I mean , I find myself still doing him , to myself , so that is a sickness in itself. &quot; But George_Bush seems to be the one recurring &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; character of the ' 90s that isn ' t in development as a feature_film these days , though you ' d think the ex-Prez would be at least as eligible a spinoff as Linda Richman or Pat . So , whither the film career of Carvey , who exited the show while still its most popular player nearly two years ago ? It ' s coming , it ' s coming . Enter &quot; Clean_Slate , &quot; Carvey ' s first real starring vehicle since leaving TV ' s preeminent late-night revue , if you don ' t count the &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; movies , in which he enjoyed elevated sidekick status . ( &quot; Opportunity Knocks , &quot; his sole prior stab at carrying a feature_film , was released four years ago while Carvey was still in the midst of &quot; Saturday Night &quot; fever. ) &quot; Clean_Slate , &quot; which opened Friday , is the film a very weary Carvey has arrived_at a Manhattan hotel to promote , on a one-day leave from a shoot in Canada , though he confesses only half-jokingly that he barely remembers making the movie in_question . This forgetfulness isn ' t a riff on the script ' s amnesia theme but an allusion to the fact that the picture wrapped a year ago and he ' s been busy filming other movies ever since , one of the successors being the already rush-released &quot; Wayne ' s World 2. &quot; &quot; A year ? that ' s like a lifetime , &quot; he reiterates wearily . &quot; I ' ve done three films since this . So it ' s kinda like ' What was that again ? ' &quot; The one with the dog , we remind him . ( Barkley the terrier , who has much more time to burn than Carvey , is doing interviews of a sort on another floor. ) &quot; Yeah , people love the dog . that ' s good . People were going , ' Were you afraid the dog was gonna steal the movie ? ' I said , ' Please , God , I hope he does. ' If we can get some dog laughs , that ' s great. &quot; The human laughs in &quot; Clean_Slate , &quot; meanwhile , for once in Carvey ' s career , don ' t rely_on his submerging his own persona in the service of exaggerated characterizations . He plays it about as close as he ' s going_to get_to straight in a thickly plotted comedy whose premise is sort of the inverse of &quot; Groundhog_Day &quot; : As a private_detective newly beset by a rare form of amnesia that causes him to clear_out his memory bank every time he dozes , he starts each morning mentally anew , while the rest of the world awakens to the usual continuity . This role wasn ' t written with the comic or his famous mimicry in mind , and here at last , Dana Carvey stays visible as someone who looks and sounds much like Dana Carvey , a romantic leading man thing , without accents and wigs . A breakthrough he ' s been striving for ? &quot; Honestly , not really . I like playing characters , &quot; he insists , &quot; and I ' ve really come_to terms with that , and I realize that I don ' t really have a face . I think if there ' s anything true about me , it ' s that I just change a lot . I don ' t think I have a singular persona like Tom Cruise or Kevin Costner or something . I have such a bland , rubbery face that I can change it , so why not play to that ? &quot; This picture , he indicates , is more an aberration than a model for his film career : &quot; I basically would look_for quirkier , weirder parts at this point , probably more extreme characters , edgier stuff . that ' s my thing , just play to my strengths from now on . &quot; But ironically , my favorite kind of film is an Everyman in an amazing dilemma -- ' Three Days of the Condor ' ; pick any Hitchcock film . I love those kind of film noir mystery-detective what ' s-going-on movies . that ' s what appealed_to me about ' Clean_Slate ' : ' Hey , it ' d be cool to be in something like that. ' But for me , ultimately , honestly , probably my strengths are characters and comic rhythms , sort of transposing what I did on ' Saturday Night Live ' into a filmic medium . . . . Listen to me , I sound so pseudo-intellectual. &quot; He recovers , ever-present modesty intact : &quot; My hero -- which I don ' t mean to make any comparison -- would be Peter Sellers . When I watch him work , I most identify with what he ' s doing . He knows how to bend the words , and that ' s what I like to do , bend words musically , get a laugh that way . I was just watching ' The Party ' the other day . He was hitting musical_rhythms in his speech , and you could tell that he was having a good time with it. &quot; * Self-amusement , obviously , is no small factor for Carvey , who after all is a guy who goes_out to eat and can ' t resist wondering in that inner lisp if buttering the biscuit would or would n ' t be prudent . Carvey ' s gift is that he works strictly within the topical realm of verbal comedy but as if he were a physical comedian , relying_on vocal nuances and gestures so savvily that it often doesn ' t matter if content isn ' t up_to form , as was too often the case with &quot; SNL. &quot; Satire and scatology may have figured into Carvey ' s work regularly enough , but guile has always been secondary to the glee he takes_in pure performance , which makes even his most devastating parodies seem sort of innocent . The world is_full of angry comics , and Carvey isn ' t one of them . All this talk_about Carvey ' s acting aspirations is interrupted at one point by a startling declaration . &quot; Well , &quot; he says unexpectedly , fielding a query about his future in films , &quot; I feel_like I ' m a comedian. &quot; He says it again for good measure . &quot; I ' m not an actor , I ' m a comedian. &quot; So pardon us while we stop to collect our jaws off the carpet . But his declaration isn ' t a matter of humility . &quot; People always go , ' Don ' t put yourself down , ' and I say to them , ' Well , there ' s 10 # 000 actors and about 50 comedians -- I ' m complimenting myself. ' And I think a comedian has to exert control over what he does. &quot; Therein lies the rub , and the real point , of his juxtaposition . &quot; I mean , certainly David Letterman exerts control on his show , &quot; Carvey continues , &quot; and Roseanne Arnold exerts control , and Robin Williams exerted control on ' Mrs . Doubtfire. ' You ' re still a collaborator in film , but you need to exert your influence , because you know best how to make you funny . That doesn ' t mean you know anything about film , or it doesn ' t mean you understand the history of cinema , but you do -- after being a stand-up for 10 years -- kind of know what your strengths are comedically and how to play to ' em. &quot; Aha , now emerges the ego , figures the cynic . But not really . Reports from impartial sorts who have toiled on film sets alongside Carvey give tale of a prototypical ( and Hollywood atypical ) nice guy who ' s anything but a power wielder . For all his talk_of &quot; control , &quot; Carvey ' s speaking mostly in the theoretical , as someone who hasn ' t much wielded it yet but is lately prone to pondering how to keep his hands near his own reins . Difficult is not the hallmark of his approach to Hollywood -- so far , anyway . &quot; This is all kind of baby-boom , dysfunctional jargon , but I am a people-pleaser , &quot; he acknowledges . &quot; I want everyone to like me , which really , really is just the way that I ' ve learned to operate in the world . It works for me a lot of the time , and it works against me some of the time . I try to assert myself more , because I know that my tendency to please can get me in a lot of trouble , and not following my instincts. &quot; And who would n ' t be trying to sharpen up the instincts a little , with the deadly &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; - &quot; SCTV &quot; curse yet to be outlived ? * On the plus side , Carvey can enjoy having retired from &quot; SNL &quot; at a personal peak : &quot; I was really happy with the way it turned_out , because I started_out as the Church Lady , basically , and by the end they were mentioning different characters along with her . That was a triumph , because for a while there I thought I was just gonna be the guy in the dress. &quot; But in the periphery of the path ahead , there ' s a cinematic salvage yard littered with the wreckage of high-concept , low-ball vehicles that lowered public estimation of the once-beloved likes of Chase , Aykroyd , Candy , Short , et al . Carvey doesn ' t want to whistle through that graveyard , but he ' d still rather err on the side of too many movies than too few , lest he not learn along the way . &quot; This trip from ' Saturday Night Live ' into movies , it ' s fraught with danger , &quot; he understates . &quot; If anything , I would beg for compassion for the people who make the trip . They ' re thrust into this arena they really don ' t understand , and yet they don ' t get_to go make 10 B-movies and learn their craft , because of their success in television . . . . &quot; A lot of times editors overedit comedic scenes so that the rhythm is taken_out of the hands of the comedian . We were shooting_up in Toronto and they had this Marx Brothers filmfest up there , and I would come_back and watch those movies , and I was just like ' Wow , they ' re playing it in a two-shot , and it ' s not cutting , and it ' s just Harpo and Chico doing their stuff , and here comes a straight guy , and they ' re ( messing ) with him , and they ' re staying_on the shot , and they ' re staying_on the shot , and they ' re staying_on the shot. ' You watch a lot of modern comedies , and they overshoot everything , and then they just . . . &quot; He makes a wanton snipping motion . It turns_out Carvey means &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 , &quot; which was hurriedly written and filmed and even more hurriedly edited for Christmas release , as an example . In the subplot wherein novice-to-love ' s-ways Garth falls_under the spell of Kim Basinger , Carvey had control almost every step of the way -- writing those scenes , casting Basinger ( &quot; She was brilliant &quot; ) , working closely with the director and cinematographer . But being shut_out at the all-important last stop , the editing room , was a &quot; frustrating &quot; learning experience . Likewise , he was disappointed that the setup he wrote , in which Garth imagines himself to have grown_up , affording a new swagger in his walk and talk , was scissored from the final edit . &quot; It ' s a little embarrassing when you see a performance and the premise of the performance was cut. &quot; He still hasn ' t seen &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 &quot; or &quot; Clean_Slate &quot; from beginning to end . &quot; I have a hard_time watching myself on the screen . People say , ' Oh , what are you , a romantic lead now ? ' I see someone with no chin who looks very tired , who has his hair colored and looks uncomfortable . &quot; And Garth , I see a guy 38 . . . &quot; This requires a little explanation . &quot; In my mind , look , they never say our ages , and I say Garth is at least 30 . I mean , &quot; Carvey offers with a whiff of apology , &quot; I never for a second_thought that I looked_like a guy who just got pubes , unless he has some kind of disease . When that line came_around , I did say to Mike Myers , ' What ' s with this pubes thing ? We ' re trying to say I ' m 14 or something ? I don ' t know when yours came_in , but . . . ' &quot; * Lest it sound like this no-control issue has soured Carvey on the whole movie thing , that ' s not the case . His two most recent shoots have him buzzing , both having presented him with oddball parts of Peter Sellers-ish proportions in reputable ensemble satires . Recently he completed work under director Alan Parker on &quot; The Road to Wellville , &quot; based on T . Coraghessan Boyle ' s award-winning comic novel about rampant enemas and other strange doings at a turn-of-the-century Michigan health spa . Carvey plays central guru figure John Harvey Kellogg ' s disillusioned , rat-eating , dumpster-living son . &quot; It ' s a pretty sick film , &quot; he says with a little pride . &quot; I had a big scene with Bridget Fonda -- she ' s naked in a tub and I strip for her -- but mostly I ' m getting_to work with the world ' s greatest living actor . I do throw bottles of feces at Anthony Hopkins ' face. &quot; Sir Anthony ' s face , he means . &quot; Yeah , giant bottles of human excrement go flying at Sir Anthony ' s face , yes . So who could turn_down a part like that ? And I look just hideous in the film . I ' ve got this makeup guy , Peter Frampton -- when he wakes_up , he comes_alive -- who cut_out these pieces from a Coke can and put ' em behind my ears and made ' em push_out like that . And then he painted my teeth so they looked just decayed and rotten and chipped . . . &quot; He couldn ' t sound more delighted if he was Chauncey Gardner with the clap . Upon completing &quot; Wellville , &quot; Carvey caught the red-eye to Toronto to commence shooting &quot; It Happened in Paradise , &quot; directed by George Gallo ( &quot; 29th St. &quot; ) and co-starring Jon Lovitz and Nicholas Cage . Here , as with &quot; Wayne ' s World 2 , &quot; Carvey is being allowed to create his own part -- as a none-too-bright Italian American good-fella -- and improvisation is being heartily welcomed as the cameras roll . Carvey ' s exhausted but intoxicated . &quot; What I ' ve found is that the act of discovering it while you ' re filming is the key to comedy on film , rather than rehearsing it , getting_it all perfect , ' now let ' s go_in front of the cameras and try to repeat that , ' &quot; Carvey says . &quot; When I was doing ' Saturday Night Live , ' I ' d try to be bad at read-through , bad in rehearsals . Sometimes the writers would go , ' What are you doing ? ' Because I was so afraid to hit it on Thursday or Friday and then spend the rest of the weekend trying to repeat myself , and even trying at dress_rehearsal not to do_it too well , so that when you ' re on air you ' re discovering where its limits are , right as the camera ' s rolling . And on film that ' s really hard to do . But on this film , on ' It Happened in Paradise , ' it ' s happening. &quot; * Yet how many opportunities will there be to play these kinds of weirdos in Hollywood pictures on a scale commensurate with the billing and budget he ' s used to ? For backup , Carvey has at least two of_his_own projects in development , both Sellers-type riffs on naive immigrants . At Columbia , he has &quot; Tucson , &quot; about a paperback-fed Irishman who comes_to the Old West with his own ideas about what a cowboy is ; at MGM , he hopes to do &quot; Beverly Hills Ninja , &quot; a Clouseau-esque comedy about a Japanese-born and -bred white guy who stumbles into America still laboring under the delusion that he ' s a great warrior . &quot; If it ' s in television or film , I ' m trying to protect whatever my strengths are and play to my instincts , don ' t sway from that . And it ' s hard to do . And they do bring truckloads of money , &quot; he says , laughing . &quot; To say that money isn ' t a factor at all is crazy . . . . But usually you can make a lot of different choices . I had this brilliant acting coach who really helped me quite a bit . He died of AIDS . And he called me from the hospital , from his deathbed , basically , and he said , ' Don ' tchase the Hollywood dream . It ' s a dead-end_street ' -- don ' t go_for fame and money when everyone around you is going_to ' go_for the fame and the money. ' &quot; I mean , I was offered a Church Lady commercial this year -- this year ; I hadn ' t done the character in four years -- for seven figures , and didn ' t do_it . And I ' m not Johnny Integrity at all , but I honestly really like the character and I thought that would cheapen her . Isn ' t that weird ? &quot; Carvey had paged through the New York Times over breakfast and happened_upon an article on Dave Thomas , the veteran of the satirical series &quot; SCTV &quot; who never quite made_it outside the show and is now toiling as a wacky sidekick on a hit network sitcom . There are generalizations in the piece about the disillusionment of Thomas ' generation of comics that have Carvey pondering how much they might apply to him : &quot; There ' s a lot of traps in Hollywood -- selling your soul . . . . Sooner or later , as somebody from ' Saturday Night Live , ' you ' re in a situation where you ' re doing something where they say you would have parodied that in your early days . Did you read that about Dave Thomas ? I thought that was real interesting -- now he ' s doing what once he would have made_fun of . &quot; It ' s not a desirable situation , &quot; Carvey adds , thoughtfully , &quot; but maybe it happens to all_of us sooner or later. &quot; This possibility seems to engender the slightest of Angst in the world ' s least angry dead-on savage parodist . But not much more_than that . He takes his delight in the goofy subversion of the moment more_than the expansive scheming and cunning of ideology . And if Carvey did break_down , swallow the shame and imprudently go_for the Church Lady commercial , chances are he ' d wind_up having a perfectly self-amusing good time giving the old_bag a spin. *</TEXT>
