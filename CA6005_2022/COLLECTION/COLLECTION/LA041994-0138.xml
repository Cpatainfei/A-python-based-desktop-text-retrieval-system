   <HEADLINE> MITCHELL SERVES NOTICE OF INTENT TO PUSH HEALTH REFORM ; POLITICS : MAJORITY_LEADER USES WEEKEND RETREAT TO SPELL_OUT FOR DEMOCRATS HIS SUPPORT FOR UNIVERSAL MEDICAL COVERAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) , having forestalled a chance at a seat on the Supreme Court to concentrate_on health_care reform , has put his Democratic colleagues on notice that it is time to confront the difficult trade-offs that lie ahead . Painful as the choices may be , especially in a congressional election year , Mitchell has made_it clear that he intends to hold Democrats accountable and do his best to force action on comprehensive universal health_care before the year is out . Mitchell signaled that the debate on health reform is entering this critical phase when he used the Democrats ' annual retreat last weekend to spell_out an unusually detailed set of options aimed at paring the costs of the plan without sacrificing President Clinton ' s goal of universal coverage . For some senators , the meeting at Williamsburg , Va. , marked the first time they really faced the specifics . &quot; In laying_out the options , he really brought us to a better focus about what it is we have to decide and how we might reach consensus , &quot; said Sen . Tom Daschle ( D-S.D. ) , who has been one of the Senate ' s leading backers of the President ' s plan . Daschle cautioned that three sets of alternatives being offered by Mitchell were primarily &quot; for educational value &quot; and were offered &quot; without any expectation that we would adopt any of the options. &quot; However , all were aimed at lowering the cost of Clinton ' s proposal without sacrificing his goal of universal coverage -- a tack similar to that being pursued in the House , where Energy and Commerce Chairman John D . Dingell ( D-Mich. ) is trying to round_up enough support on his panel to pass sweeping health legislation . Lawmakers ' concerns over the cost of the Clinton plan heightened earlier this year , when the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the President ' s proposal would add $ 74 billion to the federal_deficit by the end of the century . All three options outlined by Mitchell also include the most controversial proposal in Clinton ' s plan : that all employers be required to pay some share of their workers ' health benefits . One would pare that mandate from the minimum 80 % employer contribution proposed by Clinton to 50 % . It also would scale back benefits by 5 % in overall value and allow firms with 1 # 000 or more workers to opt_out of government-organized purchasing cooperatives . Under the President ' s plan , far more firms -- those with less than 5 # 000 workers -- would be required to join the so-called &quot; alliances. &quot; Another option would distribute government subsidies not to the small businesses with low-wage earners but to all low-wage workers , including those employed by big companies . Analysts said this alternative would be a more efficient and equitable way to provide assistance in buying insurance . Administration officials said Mitchell ' s weekend presentation was intended to provide Senate Democrats -- especially on the Finance_Committee -- with &quot; a sense of the options &quot; and specifically to &quot; accelerate their progress &quot; toward drafting a bill . Mitchell , a longtime advocate of health reform , acted independently of the White_House , but Administration analysts &quot; fell_over themselves &quot; whenever he or his staff sought information or technical advice , Administration sources said . &quot; What Mitchell was saying , in_effect , was : ' Focus , you guys . Time ' s up . Think . Here we go ! ' &quot; explained one Administration official . &quot; In terms of what Mitchell was presenting , he used the core of the President ' s plan , and from that he did some tweaking. &quot; To the extent that Mitchell ' s action may expedite progress in the Senate , it also may persuade House members to proceed apace with their own health reform efforts . House members have been wary of getting too far out_in front of the Senate on health_care because they have not forgotten last year ' s bruising budget battle in which they voted for an unpopular energy tax only to have the Senate kill it later . Among those who sharply criticized Mitchell ' s options was Rep . Jim McDermott ( D-Wash. ) , the chief sponsor of the Canadian-style single-payer plan , in which the government pays most medical_bills . McDermott said he would not vote for a proposal that reduces the ratio of employer-employee contributions from 80 % -20 % to 50 % -50 % . &quot; There ' s no way I ' ll go_back ( to Washington state ) and tell the aerospace mechanics that they are going_to have to pay_for half their health_care , &quot; he said . &quot; This plan was clearly put_out by someone who ' s not going_to run again. &quot; Also on Monday , senior White_House officials expressed optimism that comprehensive health_care reform will be enacted this year -- in part , one said , because the Whitewater controversy appears to be receding as an issue . But another senior Clinton adviser conceded that the President still must overcome a public perception that his plan means &quot; big government is taking_over the health_care system. &quot; &quot; Our job , &quot; he added , is to ensure that Congress does not merely enact &quot; a small package of insurance reforms &quot; that do not provide universal coverage or control costs . The President , meanwhile , continued a series of recent health_care appearances with a speech in Milwaukee that stressed what his plan would do for small business . Addressing about 1 # 000 employees of the Ameritech telecommunications company at Milwaukee ' s Italian Community_Center , Clinton said his proposals would cap the percentage of payroll that any business must pay_for health benefits and would provide subsidies for small firms with low-wage earners . Under Clinton ' s plan , no firm would have to pay more_than 7.9 % of payroll , while small firms with low-wage workers may pay as little as 3.5 % of payroll . Times staff writer Paul Richter contributed to this story from Milwaukee .</TEXT>
