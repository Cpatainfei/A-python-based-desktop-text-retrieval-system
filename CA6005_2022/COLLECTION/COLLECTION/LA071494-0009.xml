   <HEADLINE> CULVER CITY CONSIDERS 11 % SURCHARGE ON CELLULAR PHONES ; FINANCES : OFFICIALS SAY THE TAX WOULD ADD $ 60 # 000 TO BEEF_UP SOME SERVICES , SUCH AS PARK SUPERVISION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Culver City may soon join the growing list of Los Angeles County communities that tax cellular_phone users . The City_Council two weeks ago voted 3 to 2 to tentatively approve an ordinance that would extend an 11 % utility users tax to cellular_telephone users with a Culver City billing address . The tax would cost Culver City users an average of $ 4 annually . Councilmen Steven Gourley , Edward Wolkowitz and Mike Balkman voted_in favor of the tax ; James D . Boulgarides and Mayor Albert Vera opposed it . The council will vote again on the tax July 18 . City officials said the additional revenue from the cellular_phone tax would allow the city to beef_up some services , such_as park supervision . A growing number of cities , including Santa Monica , Malibu and Los Angeles , have implemented cellular_phone taxes in recent years . Los Angeles and Santa Monica both impose a 10 % tax ; Malibu ' s is 5 % . Based on reports that some of those cities have seen a 2.5 % to 4 % increase in revenue from the taxes , Culver City officials estimated an initial $ 60 # 000 annual boost in revenue to the $ 43.8-million budget_for the 1994-95 fiscal_year . The tax would go_into effect by Oct . 1 , after the phone_company sets_up a billing system . In the future , officials said the city could expect an additional annual revenue of $ 80 # 000 , based on the extension of the tax to other mobile communications services -- a catchall phrase meant to encompass future developments in communications . The tax would be based on the standard fixed monthly access charge , said Candice Maloney , a spokeswoman for L.A. Cellular , one of the larger companies providing cellular_phone service to Culver City . &quot; For instance , if a customer has a plan where they pay $ 69 for 100 minutes , the $ 69 would be taxed . It has nothing to do with how much they use the phone , or where they call . Air time and usage is not taxed , &quot; she said . So far the company has not received any complaints from customers , Maloney said . &quot; L.A. Cellular never enjoys playing the role of tax_collector , but we ' re always happy to work with local municipalities , &quot; Maloney said . Opponents said the tax would send a negative message to Culver City businesses . During the next council meeting , Vera said , he will ask the council to shelve the idea for six months , saying that the timing for the tax proposal was poor . &quot; You don ' t raise taxes right after balancing a budget , &quot; he said . In the meantime , he said , he would seek alternatives . &quot; I would go_after some of those fat ( administrative ) salaries before taxing people. &quot; He added that representatives from the Sony studios on Washington Boulevard have complained . A spokesperson for Sony could not be reached for comment . Vera also said that because the city has balanced its budget , the need for additional revenue is not crucial . Gourley countered that , based on the experience of the other cities , the tax is an ideal revenue source . He is confident that the proposed ordinance will be approved on the next vote . &quot; Everyone else is taxing , &quot; he said . &quot; So why not do_it here instead of letting Los Angeles take it away from us ? &quot; Other utilities taxed by the city includes gas , electric , telephone , water and cable_television .</TEXT>
