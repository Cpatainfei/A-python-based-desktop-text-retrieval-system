   <HEADLINE> HARDING ' S HOPES SHRINKING ; FIGURE_SKATING : HER FORMER HUSBAND IS SAID TO BE NEAR A PLEA BARGAIN THAT WOULD IMPLICATE HER IN THE ATTACK ON KERRIGAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two weeks before the Winter Games are to begin , Tonya Harding ' s chances of skating for the U.S. team and avoiding criminal charges appeared bleak as investigators gathered new evidence in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan . Harding ' s former husband , Jeff Gillooly , spent about two hours in the Multnomah County_Courthouse on Saturday , after reportedly working_out a deal that will reduce his jail time and implicate his former wife . And as investigators in Detroit , the site of the Jan . 6 attack that kept Kerrigan out of the U.S. Figure_Skating Championships , reportedly looked_at phone records damaging to Harding , Olympic officials were considering an alternate skater for the Games . Gillooly ' s attorney , Ron Hoevet , would not say if Gillooly was there to testify before the grand_jury investigating the case . There were indications , however , that the grand_jury was in session Saturday . Hoevet said he and Gillooly would make a public statement on Monday or Tuesday , a strong indication that Gillooly planned to enter a plea then . Investigators in Detroit reportedly have information that Harding asked_for Kerrigan ' s hotel_room number before the attack and made several calls to Harding ' s bodyguard , Shawn Eckardt , the day of the assault . The evidence is being gathered_in an apparent attempt to corroborate statements made by Eckardt , who publicly has implicated Harding , and Gillooly , who reportedly has said she was in on the alleged plot . Gillooly , Eckardt , confessed hit-man Shane Stant and Derrick Smith , who is accused of driving the getaway car , all are free on bail . Meanwhile , the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . is strongly considering sending 13-year-old Michelle Kwan to the Lillehammer Games as an alternate , an unusual step . &quot; It ' s not completely confirmed , &quot; association spokeswoman Kristin Matta said . &quot; Given the circumstances , it ' s definitely a possibility. &quot; Kwan ' s representative issued a statement Saturday saying she continues to train but has not been notified she is going_to Lillehammer . If she was in Lillehammer , Kwan would be available if Harding was removed from the team at the last minute . The Winter Games will begin Feb . 12 , but women ' s figure_skating doesn ' t start until Feb . 23 and the roster can be changed until Feb . 21 . Harding acknowledged Thursday that she learned shortly after she returned from the national championships that those around her were involved in the attack . But she denied knowing about the attack beforehand . Harding , who has held workouts before large , supportive audiences at a suburban mall during the past week , does not practice on weekends . Several news organizations have quoted sources as saying Gillooly has agreed to plead guilty to one count of racketeering and would get a two-year sentence , rather than the maximum penalty of three years under the current conspiracy charge against him .</TEXT>
