   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT SEEN IN NUCLEAR SMUGGLING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German police fear some Russian officials are involved in the smuggling of nuclear material , a senior aide to Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Friday . Bernd Schmidbauer , Kohl ' s intelligence coordinator , made the comment in discussing why police did not notify their Russian counterparts of a sting designed to collar a suspected nuclear smuggler . &quot; This isn ' t an accusation , but rather the point that must be discussed in Moscow -- working together , &quot; he said . Schmidbauer was to fly to Moscow on Saturday with Germany ' s top intelligence chiefs and nuclear scientists in an effort to coordinate actions against nuclear smuggling . Officials in Moscow have denied that weapons-grade nuclear materials have been spirited out of Russia .</TEXT>
