   <TEXT> Ask any soccer fan to name the five greatest players ever and , chances are , Johan Cruyff would be high on the list . Voted European player of the year in 1971 , 1973 and 1974 , Cruyff was a player of sublime skills , a forward who ranked alongside Pele , Diego Maradona , Franz Beckenbauer and George Best as the greatest of their generation . Cruyff inspired the Dutch national team in the 1970s , the player whose sparkling talent led his country to the 1974 World Cup_final , which the_Netherlands lost to West Germany , 2-1 , in Munich . Four years later , the Dutch , still under the leadership of Coach Rinus Michels but now without Cruyff , again reached the final . This time , they lost to Argentina , 3-1 , in Buenos Aires . That marked the end of an era . The brilliant Dutch team of the ' 70s passed into history . The era of &quot; Clockwork Orange &quot; and &quot; Total Football &quot; was over . If the Dutch could not win the World Cup with players such_as Cruyff , Johan Neeskens , Johnny Rep and Ruud Krol in their ranks , they never would win it . At least that was the theory . Now , flash forward to the 1980s . The great Dutch clubs of Ajax Amsterdam , Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven again had produced a collection of superb players . Holland ' s new stars were Marco Van Basten , Ruud Gullit , Frank Rijkaard and Ronald Koeman . Like their predecessors , they dominated the European scene . Gullit was selected European player of the year in 1987 . Van Basten won the same honor in 1988 , 1989 and 1992 . Together , and still under Michels ' guidance , they achieved the_Netherlands ' greatest triumph by winning the 1988 European Championship in Germany , a feat that sparked a national celebration . By 1992 , however , the Dutch team was beginning to fade . Injuries and time had taken their toll . At that year ' s European Championship , in Sweden , the stars of the ' 80s burned brightly one last time in a thrilling 3-1 quarterfinal victory over Germany , but the Dutch then lost the semifinal on penalty kicks to eventual champion Denmark . Van Basten , of all people , saw his decisive kick saved . Another era of Dutch soccer had ended . Now , flash forward again . It is 1994 . The Dutch team has qualified for the World Cup in the United States . And who are the names being talked_about ? Cruyff ? Van Basten ? Gullit ? Michels ? How could this be ? Soccer has come full circle . Twenty years after losing the World Cup_final in Germany , the Dutch again are among the favorites to win the 1994 title . They would have been favored even more had it not been for four factors . After agreeing to take_over as coach of the national team if it qualified for the finals , Cruyff no longer will be involved . He and the Dutch federation failed to see eye-to-eye on his financial and other demands . Some commentators in Holland were astounded and angered by Cruyff ' s stance , which they considered arrogant . The Barcelona coach ' s demands allegedly included a 10 % share of the Dutch federation ' s profits from the World Cup , the right to wear his own brand of sportswear ( and not that of the Dutch team ' s sponsor ) and the refusal to have his photograph used commercially as part of the team . With Cruyff out of the picture , the Dutch federation gave the World Cup coaching_job to Dick Advocaat , who had successfully steered Holland into the finals . Advocaat has something else in his favor -- experience in the United States . He played for the Chicago Sting of the defunct North_American Soccer League . But will Advocaat be able to motivate the team as well as Cruyff ? Indeed , will some of the stars even play well for him ? &quot; Making comparisons is all part and parcel of the game , &quot; Advocaat said , &quot; but I can live with that . &quot; I have complete confidence that we can get excellent results . We have the players to do that. &quot; But Gullit , long a Cruyff supporter , refused to play for Advocaat in the qualifying matches and his participation in the World Cup was in doubt . Then , after enjoying a tremendous season with Sampdoria in Italy , the dreadlocked Dutchman , now 31 , again became part of the coach ' s plans . But only briefly . After appearing for the_Netherlands in a well-earned victory over Scotland and playing well , Gullit inexplicably quit . This time , it was for good . He gave no explanation . In a surprise move , Advocaat then turned_to 29-year-old Van Basten , who has been struggling to recover from ankle surgery for more_than a year . Van Basten at first agreed to replace Gullit . Then , under pressure from AC Milan , his club team , he changed his mind and said he would not accept Advocaat ' s offer . Turmoil in the Dutch squad is par for the course , it seems . The fourth factor that might hurt Dutch chances this summer is the age of some key players . Defender Koeman , for example , is 30 and has lost a step or two . But his ability to win a match with a single wicked , curving free_kick makes him indispensable . Koeman , who plays for Cruyff at Barcelona , is said to have the most powerful shot in soccer . Then there is Rijkaard , 29 , who is playing as well as ever , having left AC Milan this season to return to Ajax Amsterdam . Midfielder Jan Wouters , at 33 , is another veteran who has seen better days but is still playing well . And a new generation of Dutch stars is beginning to emerge . Striker Dennis Bergkamp is regarded_as one of the finest forwards in the world and a potential World Cup star . Others who could leap to prominence this summer include forward Peter van Vossen , Bryan Roy , Aron Winter and Marc Overmars and defender Ulrich Van Goebbel . It is the mark of the Dutch team ' s resilience that only a_couple_of days after the Gullit bombshell it trounced Hungary , 7-1 , as if to emphasize that all was not lost . So what are Holland ' s prospects ? If Koeman and Rijkaard can shine one last time , if Advocaat can successfully blend yesterday ' s stars with the stars of tomorrow , then the_Netherlands must be considered a serious candidate to win the World Cup . The Dutch task in the first round is not an especially difficult one . Holland has been grouped with its European neighbor , Belgium , as well as Saudi_Arabia and Morocco . In an odd twist , Saudi_Arabia was formerly coached by Leo Beenhakker , a former coach of the_Netherlands . Beenhakker was fired and replaced by Argentina ' s Jorge Solari . The Dutch should make the second round with ease , and their progress after that will depend_on which teams they meet on_the_road to the Rose Bowl . And if they go all_the way , they will take their fans with them and the Pasadena stadium will be turned_into a sea of orange . Dutch fans are the most colorful , if not bizarre , in the world , with a passion for outrageous costumes . But while the cameras focus_on the painted faces in the crowd , soccer fans will be looking_for the patterns being woven on the field . And what if Holland and the United States should meet ? What an odd coincidence that would be . The U.S. federation recently named Rinus Michels as its director of coaching . And Michels used to coach the L.A. Aztecs , who used to play in the Rose Bowl and had Cruyff as their star player . A Netherlands-United States final in Pasadena is an unlikely scenario , but it would make the circle complete .</TEXT>
