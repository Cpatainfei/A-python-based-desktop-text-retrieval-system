   <HEADLINE> STARS , STRIPES -- AND SOCCER ? WORLD CUP FANS CRY FOUL ; YES , THE EARTH ' S MOST REVERED SPORT IS COMING TO A COUNTRY THAT SHUNS IT . THE REASONS ADD UP TO BILLIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Talk_about the ultimate punishment ! It was 1990 , Italy was hosting the World Cup soccer championships , and an Italian judge had before him an avid fan convicted of hooliganism during an Italian league match . The sentence : Silence . No talking_about soccer for the duration of the quadrennial tournament that regularly captures the globe ' s biggest sporting audience . &quot; Rip_out my heart ! Sacrifice my offspring ! But not this ! &quot; The World Cup . It was her country ' s loss to Austria in the 1978 World Cup that drove a young West_Berlin woman to leap from her apartment window shouting : &quot; I don ' t want to live any more ! &quot; During that same game , a man in a Frankfurt restaurant tried to strangle another diner who was cheering for the other side . Eight years later , when the tournament finals moved to Mexico , a Colombian man became so enraged when his wife turned_off the TV_set during the middle of a game that he shot her . He turned the set_back on , watched the rest of the match , then called police to turn himself in . The United States may be preoccupied with sports , but nothing here rivals the place soccer holds_in the global society . In many countries , it is the social fabric that knits disparate classes and groups . Some examples : * By winning the 1990 World Cup , West Germany united East and West in ways that the fall of the Belin Wall could not . * Bolivia ' s qualification for the upcoming 1994 World Cup tournament , to be held_in the United States , set_off a national hysteria that is only now abating in the tiny landlocked Andean nation . * When Bulgaria squared_off against France in Paris for a World Cup qualifying spot in November , Bulgarian Parliament members postponed a crucial ratification vote on a new government so they could watch the game on television . * Argentina ' s former president , Carlos Saul Menem , so persistently insinuated himself into public appearances with Argentina ' s wildly popular national team that players began rolling their eyes when Menem appeared . Diego Maradona , the team ' s temperamental star , seemed to take great delight in keeping the country ' s chief_executive waiting . * Pope John Paul II -- a pretty fair goalkeeper in his youth in Poland -- happily blessed the refurbished Olympic Stadium in Rome for the 1990 World Cup . Of five most-watched sports events in television history , four are soccer matches . That 1990 final in Rome leads the list with a worldwide audience of more_than one billion people in 167 countries . Hundreds of millions tune_in just for the World Cup Draw -- a boring bit of housekeeping in which Ping-Pong balls representing nations are drawn from bowls and arranged into competition groups . So why , oh why , soccer purists ask , did the sport ' s governing body award its most revered prize to a country with a reputation as the sport ' s Siberia ? How could the Federation International de Football , or FIFA , so desecrate the World Cup , this glittering spectacle , by allowing it to be staged by the Americans , who have again and again shown their barbarity . Who don ' t even play professional soccer , for heaven ' s sake ! For generations , Americans have given the sport the back of their ticket-buying hands . An alphabet soup of professional leagues have come and gone -- the NASL , the MISL , the APSL , the MSL , the CISL the USISL . This summer , the World Cup will be held_in nine U.S. cities in a monthlong tournament climaxing with the July 17 championship game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena . Yet with only six months to go before the playoffs begin , only 13 % of Americans surveyed in a recent poll were even aware their country would be hosting the event . So what did FIFA have_in_mind ? One key is clearly that the World Cup is Very Big Business . The 1990 affair in Italy generated $ 8 billion in revenue . And , as FIFA is_well aware , the Americans have proven adept at organizing well-run and financially successful mega-events . ( Remember the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and their $ 250 million surplus ? ) FIFA is gambling that by placing the World Cup_finals in the United States , it can tap into the seemingly bottomless vats of money possessed by American television networks , sports sponsors and marketeers . Besides , while they may_not emulate more soccer-crazed nations by halting virtually every_other form of human_activity during the World Cup , the Americans have shown that they ' re trying . Consider , for example , the Silverdome . Traditionalists blanched when it was announced that some games would be played_at the indoor arena in Pontiac , Mich . Never before had a World Cup game been played indoors . Those Americans had clearly let their ignorance about soccer trip them up this time -- FIFA refuses to sanction matches_played on anything other_than natural grass . And everyone knows grass can ' t grow indoors , they said ; only that ghastly bright green plastic turf can thrive . But a team of khaki-clad agronomists sprang into action . A hybrid of three types of turf was formulated and tested with great success last summer . The grass lived for two weeks under its fiberglass sky . Lest it get unduly scuffed , the grass was removed from the arena . So , resting_on wooden pallets in a parking_lot in suburban Detroit , the Silverdome ' s field lies sleeping for the winter . Then there ' s the business about hooligans . England , with its reputation for having perhaps Europe ' s most unruly soccer fans , failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup . But the_Netherlands , whose fans may rank a close second to England ' s , has qualified . When a U.S. security official tried to allay global concerns about hooliganism , however , his efforts went awry . Maintaining that American police_officers can handle anything hooligans have to offer , the official added : &quot; If the police can ' t hold them , we ' ll put them up against our gangs in South Central L.A. The gangs will win , hands down. &quot; The security expert was puzzled when Europeans , already appalled by this country ' s gun culture , were not reassured .</TEXT>
