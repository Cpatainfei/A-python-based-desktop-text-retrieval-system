   <HEADLINE> BOND YIELDS RISE , STOCKS END MIXED ; MARKETS : THE DOLLAR SLIPS AGAINST THE MARK AND YEN . INFLATION FEARS RETURN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bond yields rose sharply Friday as rising commodity prices fueled inflation fears and the dollar slumped to a two-week low against the German mark . But stocks ended mixed , despite the rising interest_rates and the falling dollar . The Treasury ' s bellwether 30-year bond yield closed at 7.30 % , up from 7.23 % on Thursday . Its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , fell 25 / 32 point , or $ 7.81 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . The day began with bonds_trading lower because of a selloff overseas before the U.S. markets opened , said John Canavan , an analyst with Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc. in Princeton , N.J. And with the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s short-term interest_rate increases out of the way for now , and no important economic data for guidance , the bond market followed the dollar . The dollar spent the day falling against the German mark and the Japanese yen , among other key currencies . A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated securities less valuable to foreign investors . In New York , the dollar fetched 1.647 German marks , down from Thursday ' s 1.657. The greenback fell to 104.05 Japanese yen , down from 104.25. The dollar opened lower against the mark in Europe , as the German currency retained strength from comments Thursday by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer that interest_rates will remain steady . Traders watched for central_bank intervention as the dollar selloff continued , and when no action was taken , the currency continued to fall . Meanwhile , futures prices of most commodities , including gold , oil and grains , advanced . Gold shot higher on the New York Comex , closing at $ 385.90 an ounce , up $ 4.50. Light , sweet crude_oil settled at $ 18.92 per barrel , up 47 cents , at the New York Merc , its highest level in almost a year . This was considered a sign of inflation , which the bond market abhors because it erodes the value of fixed-income securities such_as Treasury_notes . Canavan also said there was volatility in the market as futures options expired about 1 p.m. and traders rushed to square their positions . The long bond fell as much as 1 1 / 32 points . Stocks followed bond prices lower most of the day , but buy programs kicked_in near the close and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average into positive territory . The blue_chip average ended_up 7.37 to 3 # 766.35 , boosting the week ' s gains to 106.67. The Dow lost as much as 17 points by midafternoon . Then options expirations prompted program traders to move_in . However , declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1 # 145 to 1 # 030 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where 293.52 million shares changed hands , down from 307.35 million on Thursday . Broad-market indexes were mixed . The NYSE ' s composite index fell 0.58 to 251.58. The Standard &amp; Poor ' s composite index fell 1.56 to 454.92. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller companies fell 0.61 to 726.70. Among Friday ' s stock_market highlights : * Autodesk dropped 2 3 / 4 to 50 1 / 4 . Prudential Securities and Alex .

Ford added 5 / 8 to 59 3 / 4 and General Motors tacked_on 1 / 8 to 55 3 / 8 . * Kansas City Southern eased 1 3 / 8 to 44 1 / 8 .
