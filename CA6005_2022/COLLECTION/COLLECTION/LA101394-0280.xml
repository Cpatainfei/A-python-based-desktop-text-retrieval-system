   <TEXT> Jim Morin stands_in front of a hazy chalkboard filled with scribbling as he surveys two lines of blue-and-white-clad fifth- and sixth-graders entering his classroom . Fresh air wafts through an open doorway as the students burst into the sparsely decorated room , filling it with chatter . &quot; Kiritsu ! &quot; he says with voice raised , demanding their attention . &quot; Kyotsuke ! &quot; he commands . The students , accustomed to daily ritual , quickly come_to order . Then bowing , they greet their instructor with a &quot; good morning. &quot; &quot; Ohayo gozaimasu , &quot; they say in unison . Meanwhile , students in other classes break_into choruses of &quot; buenos dias &quot; or &quot; bonjour . &quot; Welcome to Jackie Robinson Academy , the Long_Beach School District ' s newest and arguably most radical school . Younger students spend up_to 90 % of their school_day immersed in a language -- French , Japanese or Spanish . Students in the upper grades receive up_to half their instruction in a foreign language . After five years of planning , the academy opened its doors last month to 572 students from pre-kindergarten to sixth grade . Another 425 students were turned_away , an indication that the academy is one of the district ' s most popular schools . And for ample reason . The language immersion program is one of several efforts to help prepare students for a diverse , global , high-tech society . Officials said they selected French , Japanese and Spanish because those languages are used often in international business . Each class has access to sophisticated computer_systems to allow students to communicate and share assignments with_children throughout the state and the country , as well as allowing them access to data around the world . And it is the only school in the district that takes the Montessori approach , a private_school technique in which children are grouped together by ability rather than age and encouraged to progress at their own pace . Some classes have children three years apart in age . Instructors say grouping children in this fashion encourages independence and fosters self-esteem . At the school , children with physical or learning disabilities , rather than being placed in classes by themselves , are included in_general classes and offered the same learning environment as other students . Administrators have created an ethnically balanced student body that mirrors the racial and ethnic composition of the city . White students make_up 23 % of the enrollment ; blacks , 27 % ; Latinos , 32 % ; Asians , 5 % ; Filipinos , 9 % , and other groups , such_as Native_Americans and Pacific Islanders , 4 % . The school received a $ 550 # 000 federal grant awarded to districts to help desegregation efforts . By emphasizing a diverse enrollment , foreign languages and computer_technology , &quot; we ' re trying to start off early to give students skills they need to participate in the 21st Century , &quot; said area Supt . Dorothy Harper . &quot; It ' s a new way of teaching and a new way of learning. &quot; The school ' s only requirement for admission is that parents get involved in school activities . Before their children could be considered for enrollment , parents had to agree to devote at least 20 hours for the school_year to school-related activities . The requirement proved no obstacle as parents throughout the district scrambled to sign_up their children for the new $ 7.6-million school on Pine Avenue across from Veterans Memorial Park on the west_side of the city . Parent Dilcia Francis said she signed_up her two sons and drives them to and from school each day . Francis , a native of Honduras , said she wants her sons , Hiram and Zahir , to become fluent in Spanish . &quot; I want them to have the language skills , &quot; Francis said . &quot; It will keep them in touch with their roots. &quot; * During the first week , administrators and teachers encountered some rough spots as they labored to launch Robinson ' s ambitious academic_programs . In some classes , students initially resisted teachers ' efforts to immerse them in a foreign language , repeatedly asking instructors to speak in English . In most cases , teachers work with the children if they become frustrated by rephrasing what was said or by asking a bilingual student to assist in translating for their classmates . Then there were delays in introducing certain subjects as some teachers took extra_time to plan lessons . &quot; This is new for all_of us , &quot; said Morin , who is teaching for the first time . Despite his lack of teaching experience , Morin was hired because he is fluent in Japanese . He learned the language during a two-year stay there as a missionary . The school ' s teachers are relatively inexperienced -- administrators placed a premium on recruiting teachers with strong bilingual skills , said Principal Erlinda Teisinger . Of the 22 teachers , seven are teaching for the first time . Many are taking classes themselves to improve their teaching and bilingual skills . This is not particularly unusual since there is a shortage of qualified bilingual educators , Teisinger said . Morin , who decided to switch to teaching after eight years as an accountant in the district , is going_to night_school to earn a teaching credential and certification as a bilingual teacher . He said he decided to leave his accounting position -- taking a pay_cut -- &quot; to be involved in something more personally satisfying. &quot; * Teisinger , who is fluent in four languages , was hired in February from Fresno , where she earned accolades for developing innovative high-tech and science programs at Balderas Elementary School . The Fresno school , which she opened in 1990 , has been recognized by the U.S. Department_of_Education as one of the country ' s 200 most innovative schools . &quot; They saw my kids operating_on cow ' s eyes , experimenting with plants in botany class and doing other hands-on science projects , &quot; she said . Long_Beach officials say Teisinger has been the driving force behind the academy ' s emphasis on high-tech and computers . Recently she sent_out a plea for more computers through the school district ' s newsletter . The school received a total of 90 computers . In addition to pushing for a greater emphasis on teaching computer and other technological skills , Teisinger has been recruiting private industry and higher education institutions to get involved with programs . Neighboring Pacific Hospital of Long_Beach has agreed to present health lessons , and Cal State Long_Beach is training the school ' s bilingual teachers . Hughes Aircraft Co . is donating a satellite dish and fax machines . But the foreign language immersion classes are the centerpiece of the school ' s program . Teisinger , who has taught language immersion classes , credits bilingual programs for her fluency in Spanish , Tagalog and Ilocano , a Filipino dialect . Maria Quezada , a language specialist who provides training for Jackie Robinson Academy ' s bilingual teachers , says bilingual immersion programs help students ' overall academic performance . &quot; Kids really become attuned to language so they become more analytic of English , &quot; said Quezada , director of the Multifunctional Resource Center at Cal State Long_Beach . &quot; These skills transfer from one language to another . And English is not lost . English is enhanced. &quot; * Indeed , studies indicate that English-speaking students in bilingual programs gain an academic edge over their traditionally educated peers , said David Ramirez , executive_director for the Center for Language Minority Education and Research at Cal State Long_Beach . &quot; They end_up scoring higher on ( IQ_tests ) compared to their peers , &quot; said Ramirez , who conducted a national study of the impact of bilingual programs on learning . &quot; They seem to exhibit higher thinking skills , greater flexibility with new situations and challenges . They are just brighter. &quot; Ramirez helped develop and design Robinson ' s foreign language program . Meanwhile , Morin speaks enthusiastically about preliminary plans for a three-year economics curriculum that he intends to teach in Japanese and English to the academy ' s older students . So far , Morin ' s fifth- and sixth-graders have been getting 10 % of their instruction in Japanese , an equivalent of about 45 minutes a day , he says . Most of the instruction consists_of familiarizing the students with the Japanese alphabet and numbers , as well as simple commands and greetings . &quot; that ' s really all we ' ve got time for . At least the first_half of the year , &quot; he said . &quot; When they get more comfortable with numbers , I will start integrating the financial curriculum with that. &quot; In his sparely decorated room , accented by a handful of fern-like plants and a plastic map of Japan , Morin describes his plans to teach the school ' s sixth-graders about the value of money . He hopes to introduce a &quot; Jackie Robinson dollar &quot; ( a currency equivalent_to the U.S. dollar ) that can be used to exchange goods and services at student-run &quot; businesses. &quot; With the aid of computer_programs , students will manage personal budgets . Students will also learn about international currency systems such_as the yen or the franc , as well as rates_of_exchange , Morin said . But that ' s something for the future . On this Tuesday morning , it was time for some of his students to head out_to the school ' s field for a firsthand lesson -- in English -- about the physics of hot-air_balloons . A kaleidoscope of colors -- mauve , purple , gray , green , yellow , orange and red -- were splashed across a nylon canvas that rose gradually as an operator fired_up burners to inflate the balloon . Students took pictures of the colorful blob as it slowly expanded . About 20 children -- five from Morin ' s class -- took turns riding in the wicker_basket , the gondola , which took_off several feet from the ground as burners heated air inside the balloon . Afterward , the children gushed about their science lesson . Eleven-year-old Nubia Torres exclaimed : &quot; This is fun . We learn by doing , not by reading books . It ' s exciting. &quot;</TEXT>
