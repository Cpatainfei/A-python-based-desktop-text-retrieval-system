   <HEADLINE> ARRESTED IN ' 89 , DEFENDANTS GET NO PITY FROM BENCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Six pale , weary prisoners shuffle into an oblong cage against the wall of a courtroom . They sit in a row on a bench . The cage door locks , and their trial , now in its fifth year , resumes . Their crime : borrowing from a Soviet bank to import computers , in competition with firms tied to the Soviet KGB , and defaulting_on part of the loan . The defendants argue that only their arrests in 1989 kept them from repaying in full . The offended Soviet_Union and its KGB no longer exist , and thousands of entrepreneurs it jailed for &quot; speculation &quot; now work freely in the new Russia . But the trial of the Tellur Cooperative drags_on -- an example of judicial sluggishness that is turning the country ' s pretrial prisons into overcrowded infernos . One reason is that the original Soviet investigators are still on the case for Russia ' s Interior Ministry . Six judges thought the charges too flimsy to hear ; one threw them back at the ministry , only to be overruled by the Supreme Court . Hearings are often interrupted for up_to four months . &quot; The trial is intentionally delayed to force those who are still in prison to plead guilty , &quot; charges Alexander Morozov , one of five original defendants who were freed after falling ill ( Morozov from a hunger_strike ) but are still on_trial . The defense is now focusing_on ailments of the six jailed defendants . Alexander Golushko rises in the cage and describes how cellmates saved his life with a chest massage after his heart stopped . Judge Tamara F . Savina declines to free him . Alexander Andreyanchenko gets_up and declares a hunger_strike . He calls the judge a &quot; puppet &quot; of the Interior Ministry . She sends him back to jail . Vladimir A . Kopylov , 47 , director of the Tellur Cooperative , blows a kiss from the cage to his wife , who manages a_few words describing their daughter ' s recent 15th birthday_party . &quot; He ' s rotting alive , &quot; his wife says later . He has 107 cellmates in 67 square_yards of space . He ' s losing his hair , his eyesight and his spirit , she says . &quot; He ' s already an old man. &quot; Savina is not impressed . &quot; What do you want us to do about prison conditions ? &quot; the judge replies to a reporter ' s question . &quot; Close_down all_the prisons and let the criminals go free ? &quot; She laughs . &quot; Go_back to America and pry into your own judicial affairs. &quot; RICHARD BOUDREAUX</TEXT>
