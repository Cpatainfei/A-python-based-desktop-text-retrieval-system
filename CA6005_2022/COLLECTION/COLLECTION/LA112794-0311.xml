   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : CENTRAL : DOWNTOWN ; THANKSGIVING MEAL TO SHOW OFF SHELTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They set a bigger table for Thanksgiving dinner this year at the Union Rescue Mission . Although they will not officially begin serving the homeless in their new home at 545 S . San Pedro St . until Dec . 12 , mission staff_members threw open the doors of their state-of-the-art facility and invited 4 # 000 of the less fortunate for Thanksgiving dinner . Their shopping list looked something like this : 140 turkeys , 750 pounds of sweet_potatoes , 600 pounds of green_beans , 150 pounds of cranberry_sauce , 100 gallons of gravy , 700 pounds of stuffing , 4 # 000 rolls and , for dessert , 460 pumpkin_pies . Mission staffers anticipated serving about 1 # 000 more people this year than they did last year in their present dining_room , which is tiny compared to their new one that can seat 600 people at a time . And despite some concerns about their new neighborhood , it is this increased capacity to serve the needy that has convinced mission staffers that the move from their 68-year-old home near of Main and 2nd streets is a good one . &quot; We will have more beds so that people won ' t be forced to sleep on hard plastic chairs . Everything we need is in that building , &quot; said Michael Teague , mission ' s chief operating officer . The mission has beds for about 400 men . An additional 200 or so men find refuge in the shelter ' s chapel each night . They sleep on chairs . With 235 # 000 square_feet , the new mission will be one of the largest shelters in the nation . It can hold_up to 810 dormitory beds for transients and longer-term residents enrolled in a substance_abuse recovery program . The new space also allows the mission to offer services for women , beyond short-term emergency care , for the first time . One hundred beds have been reserved for them and room has been allocated for 12 cribs . Deborah Munoz , manager of women ' s services , said it was critical to do something to meet their needs because the female population on Skid_Row is growing . Munoz was helping Patricia Thornton , 36 , find a gift for her son , who just had his first birthday . Thornton , who lives_on Skid_Row , is struggling to stabilize her life and kick her alcohol dependency so that she can win her two children back from foster care . &quot; I ' m glad the mission is moving . Women need a place to stay down here . A place where a woman can feel_like a woman , &quot; Thornton said . The new five-floor building also has a health_care facility , a 400-seat chapel , classrooms and a basketball_court . Its price_tag was $ 29 million , funded with a $ 6.5-million community redevelopment grant and private donations . The new mission , however , is in the heart of Skid_Row , where drug trafficking and crime are rampant . The mission has doubled its security by hiring 20 more guards . Although a more hardened clientele may join the mission ' s regular patrons , staffers are confident that they will be able to maintain a safe environment . When the move was announced , some of their new neighbors complained about the growing concentration of shelters in their area and worried that sidewalk encampments and crime would increase . &quot; I think we are helping to make that community safer , &quot; Teague said . Mission security_guards will patrol around the shelter ' s entrances on San Julian and San Pedro streets . Because of the many resources inside the mission -- including a courtyard where those who do not have beds may sleep safely -- Teague said he does not think more homeless people will be camping_out in the area . Teague added that the number of homeless service centers in the neighborhood is an asset because they can coordinate resources . The mission used to serve three hot meals a day , but at the new location it will serve only two , along with a light snack in the evening . Teague said meals are available in so many of the other shelters in the neighborhood that the mission can cut_back .</TEXT>
