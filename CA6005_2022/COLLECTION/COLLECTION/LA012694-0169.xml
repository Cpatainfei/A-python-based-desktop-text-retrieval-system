   <HEADLINE> ' HIGHLY POSSIBLE ' HOSOKAWA MAY QUIT , AIDE SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s resignation &quot; is highly possible , &quot; Hosokawa ' s chief personal adviser said Tuesday . &quot; The prime_minister is not the type of person who seeks to cling_to a position , &quot; Shusei Tanaka said. &quot; He has made_it his principle to live_up_to his promises. &quot; Tanaka was referring to Hosokawa ' s pledge when he took_office in August to &quot; assume responsibility &quot; if he failed to enact political reforms . Early today , Hosokawa denied that he might resign if the political reforms are not enacted by Saturday , when the current legislative session ends . Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura , however , refused to confirm or deny Tanaka ' s prediction . Last Friday , 21 upper house members of Hosokawa ' s coalition rebelled to help defeat a political reform package that would have constituted the biggest overhaul of Japan ' s electoral and political_system since the U.S. occupation after World_War_II . Hosokawa had made the reforms the core of his policy for a coalition that took power after the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority .</TEXT>
