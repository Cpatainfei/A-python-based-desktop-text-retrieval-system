   <HEADLINE> FIELDS OF DREAMS ; WHEN IT COMES TO COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS , HIGH_SCHOOL PLAYERS LEARN THAT IT TAKES MORE THAN ATHLETIC PROWESS TO SUCCEED AT THIS GAME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Estrada is standing on the sidelines at the Peninsula-West Torrance football game , watching intently as the young players on the field run and pass and butt heads on the line . He ' s holding a clipboard , making notations on a form after every play , but he ' s actually holding much more_than that in his hands . What Estrada is holding are the dreams and futures of young_men . Estrada is a professional high_school football scout . Every year he will watch 40 to 50 high_school football games in the South Bay and throughout Los Angeles on behalf of an Orange County-based company called Para-Dies Scouting , assessing the players ' abilities , attitudes and potential . His reports and those from company scouts in other Southern California areas will be assembled and sold to colleges and universities for $ 1 # 500 to $ 2 # 000 a copy , giving them an overview of what ' s available in the Southern California high_school football market . For anxious high_school football_players who will be waiting for those college football_coaches to call , a thumbs up or a thumbs down from Estrada could be a deciding factor . Each notation he makes on that clipboard can help advance -- or demolish -- a high_school boy ' s dreams of getting a &quot; ride &quot; -- that is , a full college scholarship . It ' s big business , this quest to get a scholarship , not just in football but in other sports , for girls as well as boys . Full or partial scholarships are available in about two_dozen sports , and since implementation in the 1970s of Title IX , which seeks to balance expenditures on women ' s sports with men ' s , the growth of women ' s athletics scholarships has been explosive . In 1991 , the last year for which figures are available , the National Collegiate Athletic Assn . reported that about 90 # 000 college athletes were receiving about $ 468 million in full and partial scholarships -- almost a third of them to women -- from 540 NCAA Division I and II colleges and universities . Although the numbers are large , the size of the athletic scholarship pie actually is small , given the huge demand for a slice of it . No one knows just how many high_school athletes -- and their parents -- entertain dreams of getting an athletic ride . But insiders estimate that no more_than 10 % of high_school athletes qualify for athletic scholarships , either full or partial . Still , the South Bay has a rich history of producing great athletes . George Brett went from the diamond at El Segundo High to an almost certain spot in baseball ' s Hall_of_Fame . Vince Ferragamo , a star at Banning High in Wilmington , went_on to bigger stardom as the Rams ' quarterback in their 1980 NFC championship season . Former NBA great Paul Westphal played_at old Aviation High in Redondo Beach , while one of the NBA stars of the 1980s , Reggie Theus , came_out of Inglewood High . And the list goes_on . If it can happen to them , some parents think , maybe it can happen to my kid . As a result , many adults go_to great lengths to help their children qualify for a college athletic scholarship , which not only would ease the burden of tuition but just might turn_out to be a ticket to the pros . In the South Bay , some parents have moved_into certain school districts from miles away -- and up_to 15 years in_advance -- to get their kid in the best , most high-profile athletic program for his or her sport . Others take their kids across the country to &quot; showcase tournaments &quot; where college coaches and recruiters can see them in action . Still others pay hundreds of dollars to companies that circulate athletic resumes among college coaches . Some , including legendary El Segundo High_School baseball_coach John Stevenson , think it ' s gotten_out of hand . &quot; It has become a frenzy , &quot; said Stevenson . &quot; There are kids playing solely because their parents are demanding that they earn a scholarship . Kids are trying to play for the wrong reasons. &quot; Almost everyone connected with high_school sports has a story about pushy parents screaming at their kids for supposedly blowing a scholarship by missing a layup or muffing a grounder . And yet , with the average_cost of a private four-year college hovering around $ 14 # 000 ( tuition , room and board ) a year , who can blame a parent of a high_school athlete for thinking that it certainly would be nice if Junior or Sissy could get all or even a portion of that tuition picked_up by the school ' s athletic department ? So the question becomes , how do you help the kid do_it ? How do you increase the chances that your young athlete will get financial_aid ? Based on interviews with coaches , student athletes , scouts , recruiters and parents , here are some suggestions : Make Sure the Kid Can Play That may sound obvious , but the ability to play a sport well -- very well -- is a factor some parents overlook when they start dreaming of an athletic scholarship . Simply put , they think their young athlete is better than he or she really is . &quot; There ' s a lot of wishful_thinking going_on out there , &quot; said football scout Estrada . &quot; But you have to be realistic . Sometimes parents will come_up and ask me about their kids . I can ' t lie to them . If they ask me , I tell them the truth . Most of the time they ' re nice about it , but sometimes they don ' t want to believe me. &quot; Stevenson , the baseball_coach at El Segundo High for 36 years , also cautions parents about the &quot; big fish / small pond &quot; syndrome . &quot; Some parents say , ' Why can ' t my kid get a scholarship , he ' s an All-League player ? ' &quot; said Stevenson . &quot; But what are there , six teams in his league ? There ' s a big difference between being a great player at El Segundo High_School and just being a player at USC. &quot; Of course , some kids -- a very few -- are standouts , the so-called &quot; blue chippers. &quot; For them , it ' s not a question of whether they ' re good_enough to get an athletic scholarship , but which school they will grace with their presence . Consider , for example , Inglewood High_School basketball_player Paul Pierce , one of America ' s most wanted young_men . Under NCAA rules , recruiters aren ' t permitted to contact high_school players until after their junior year . Last July 1 , his first day of eligibility , the 6-foot , 7-inch Pierce got more_than half_a_dozen calls from college coaches . Since then , he ' s received hundreds of calls and letters from recruiters , representing all_the top college basketball programs . Pierce , who ' s rated the top college prospect in California , has narrowed the list to about six , including UCLA and USC . Across the country , college basketball_coaches are anxiously awaiting his decision , hoping he will choose them . &quot; ( Coaches ) call_back to back to back , &quot; said Pierce , a soft-spoken young_man who just turned 17 . &quot; It gets a little hard sometimes. &quot; But for Pierce ' s mother , Lorraine Hosey , it ' s been a godsend . &quot; I couldn ' t afford to send my kids to college , &quot; said Hosey , whose two other sons also were athletic standouts , one getting a basketball scholarship at the University of Wyoming and the other becoming a professional_baseball player . &quot; For us , Paul ' s basketball has been a blessing. &quot; But while his basketball abilities are undeniable , Pierce still has one more hoop to get_through before he can take those abilities to the college_level . He has a 2.8 grade point average , but he still has to score a 700 or better on the Scholastic Aptitude Test . Which brings us to an equally important requirement for getting an athletic scholarship . Make Sure the Kid Has Good Grades Until the early 1980s , about the only academic_requirement for playing college ball was maintaining a 1.6 grade point average in your college courses -- not a skull-busting requirement . In 1983 , however , the NCAA started requiring high_school graduates to meet minimum grade-point and SAT standards to be eligible for college scholarships . There is now a sliding scale : if you have a 2.0 GPA , you need a 900 SAT score ; if your GPA is 2.5 , you need a 700 SAT . And the GPA must be in 13 &quot; core courses &quot; -- math , English , the sciences . The rules are strict . Poor grades mean no scholarship and no play . End of story , end of dreams . &quot; You have to have the grades , &quot; said Patrick Roy , coach of the Inglewood Sentinels basketball_team , which had core-class requirements for its student athletes even before the NCAA instituted them . &quot; Our priority is to put kids in school , not just to play basketball . If you don ' t want to . . . work for the grades to get you into college , you ' re in the wrong program. &quot; Says football scout Estrada : &quot; The city of L.A. probably has_the_best athletes overall in Southern California , but a lot of times nobody ' s pushing those kids to study and go_to school . So you get a kid with maybe a high C average , but then you look_at his SAT , and sorry , it ' s 600 -- and you get 200 just for writing your name . So those kids can ' t get scholarships . In the South Bay the schools are generally better , the grades are better , the SATs are higher . For a kid who ' s a good but not a great player , grades can be the most important factor. &quot; Some kids , in fact , flip the equation , making athletics an adjunct to getting an academic scholarship instead of the other way around . Peninsula High_School girls ' basketball_player Katharine Foster-Keddie is an example . &quot; I ' m using sports to get_into better schools , &quot; said Foster-Keddie , a 17-year-old six-footer who has a 3.9 GPA and recently became a semifinalist for a National Merit Scholarship . Although she ' s been approached by several colleges that provide athletic scholarships , she wants to attend an Ivy League school , preferably Harvard or Yale , which do not award athletic scholarships . But she knows that being a sports standout -- she also plays volleyball -- could tip the admissions scales in her favor . Foster-Keddie and her parents also recognized another important step_in increasing the chances for a scholarship . That is . . . : Make Sure the Kid Plays Where the Decision-Makers Will See Her The South Bay features a number of powerhouse schools in certain sports : baseball ( El Segundo ) , basketball ( Inglewood ) , girls basketball ( Peninsula ) , and girls and boys volleyball ( Mira Costa in Manhattan Beach ) . Faced with limited travel budgets , especially in the so-called &quot; non-revenue sports &quot; such_as volleyball , coaches and recruiters naturally gravitate toward the best teams , the ones with the stars and blue chippers , bypassing lesser-known programs . &quot; It ' s sort of a meat market in some respects , &quot; said Wendell Yoshida , who coached the Peninsula Lady Panthers ' basketball_team to a 1992 national championship and operates a nationally known program. &quot; ( Coaches and recruiters ) are out there all_the time . We ' re going to Ohio this year to play in a major Christmas tournament , and there ' ll be college recruiters and coaches crawling all_over the place. &quot; But what if you don ' t happen to live_in the El Segundo school district , or the Palos Verdes Peninsula district , or the Inglewood district , or whatever district is tops in your kid ' s sport ? Well , you can do what a lot of parents -- including Foster-Keddie ' s -- have done : Move_into the district so your kid can go_to school there . &quot; Wendell Yoshida is the best basketball_coach in the area , &quot; said Foster-Keddie ' s father , Kevin Foster-Keddie . &quot; When ( Katharine ) was in the fifth grade , and seemed to be showing talent in basketball , a friend said , ' Call Yoshida. ' &quot; Foster-Keddie did , sent Katharine to several of Yoshida ' s summer basketball camps , and then when she was about ready to start high_school , he and Katharine moved to a leased home_in Rancho Palos Verdes -- leaving the rest of the Foster-Keddie family back home_in El Segundo . &quot; We made a lot of changes , &quot; Kevin Foster-Keddie said . &quot; It was difficult . But I believe you have to be supportive. &quot; Another Peninsula basketball star , Allison Fortner , a 5-foot 9-inch shooting guard who recently returned from a trip to the East Coast for a showcase tournament to show her stuff to recruiters , also is a transplant : she moved_into the district from San Pedro . Almost every_other top program has players with similar stories of moving from sometimes far-flung areas into the school district . Basketball_coach Roy at Inglewood has had players move_into the district from Artesia , the San Fernando Valley , all_over . &quot; They feel they need to come here to be seen by the coaches , &quot; Roy said . And one El Segundo resident , who asked to remain anonymous , acknowledged that he decided to move to the city 15 years ago -- when his son was still in diapers -- in large part because of Stevenson ' s baseball program . But what if you can ' t quite uproot your entire family just to make_sure your kid is in the best sports program ? What if you can ' t afford to fly all_over the country showing_off your kid at showcase tournaments ? How can you get recruiters and coaches to notice you ? The solution may be . . . : Advertise , Advertise , Advertise &quot; Unless you ' re a true blue-chipper in football or basketball , you need to market yourself , &quot; said Tracy Jackson , president of College Prospects of America , an Ohio-based firm that contracts with student-athletes to distribute profiles of their athletic and academic statistics to colleges across the country . &quot; It ' s a dating service concept ; we introduce athletes to colleges and vice versa . If they want to get_married , that ' s up_to them. &quot; The oldest and largest company of its type , nine-year-old College Prospects operates through about 175 independently owned franchises in 47 states . For $ 650 , a student can have a complete resume sent to every college athletics program in which they might legitimately be qualified to play . Jackson makes no guarantees that they ' ll get a scholarship , but he says there ' s a money-back guarantee that the athlete will get_at least one response from a college coach . Not everyone approves of the concept -- Stevenson of El Segundo calls such services &quot; parasites , &quot; and even Jackson acknowledges that some fly-by-night operations have damaged the concept ' s image . But the company literature is thick_with testimonials from college and high_school coaches and parents . And some student athletes say it ' s the only way to get their names out there . Sandra Clark of Carson , whose daughter , Leslie King , 17 , is a standout girls ' softball player at Carson High_School , said Leslie was hoping somebody would notice her , but nobody did . &quot; Her coach told her about it ( College Prospects ) , and since she signed_up , she ' s gotten_about 25 responses. &quot; &quot; The coaches are sending me questionnaires , &quot; said Leslie , a senior who ' s on the honor roll and has a 3.95 GPA . &quot; I haven ' t talked to any of them yet , but I ' m hoping something will work out. &quot; &quot; It wasn ' t easy to come_up with the money ( for the service ) , &quot; Clark said . &quot; But when you consider how much college costs , we thought it was worth it. &quot; But perhaps the most important piece of advice on college athletic scholarships , according to almost everyone , is not to attach too_much importance to them . For most kids the odds are long , the payoff often is not that great -- especially from a partial scholarship -- and the athletic scholarship may_not jibe with the kid ' s educational goals . &quot; Our mission ( in high_school athletics ) is not to build college players or professional players , &quot; said Stevenson . &quot; Our mission is to provide an education , and athletics is part of the educational process . If a kid gets a scholarship , that ' s nice , but I don ' t think kids should play just for that purpose . They should play because they love to play. &quot; Times Staff Writer Rob Fernas contributed to this story .</TEXT>
