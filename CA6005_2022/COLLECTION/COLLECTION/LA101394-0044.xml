   <HEADLINE> EYE ON THE PRIZE ; GLEEFUL OFFICIALS AND FACULTY HOPE USC ' S FIRST NOBEL WILL HELP THE CAMPUS FINALLY SHED A STEREOTYPE AS AN ACADEMIC LIGHTWEIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Across the USC campus on Wednesday , the news that chemist George A . Olah had brought the university its first Nobel Prize was greeted with joy and grateful relief . There is , it seems , nothing like the first time . USC has plenty of Heismans in its trophy_case but desperately wanted a Nobel . &quot; It was , &quot; one USC official commented dryly , &quot; like an unscratched itch. &quot; Never again would USC face the indignity of being left_off the list of major California institutions with Nobel laureates on their faculty . Stanford has won 14 prizes , Caltech 12 , even cross-town rival UCLA has been able to boast three . And now , the University of Southern California . &quot; Certainly , this university has wanted a Nobel winner for some time , &quot; USC President Steven B . Sample , exclaimed on Wednesday in something of an understatement . The prize , faculty and students explained , gives USC powerful ammunition as it tries to shed an old and annoying stereotype as the University of Spoiled Children , or worse , the University of Second Choice for serious academics . Although it is unlikely that George Olah will ever be more famous than another USC alumnus , O.J. Simpson , the Nobel was welcomed as a sign that the school long regarded by some as more interested in gridiron yardage than international acclaim is deserving of new respect . Sample said he is pleased that the prize was awarded after a $ 120-million gift from Walter B . Annenberg for communications programs at USC , one of the largest grants in the history of higher education . Combined , the Nobel and the Annenberg grant &quot; will have a synergistic effect . That will be very helpful in student recruitment , fund raising and faculty recruitment , &quot; USC ' s president said . Not surprisingly , perhaps , USC ' s dean of admission and financial_aid thought ahead to this Saturday ' s football game with Stanford when he thought_about the prize . Why not , said Joseph Allen , have the USC marching band spell_out the word Olah on the playing_field ? After all , Allen noted , the Stanford band has taunted USC ' s academic reputation in the past by forming the average SAT scores of Trojan freshmen , which traditionally lag below the Stanford scores . &quot; It ' s wonderful to have this new symbolism , &quot; Allen , more seriously , said of the Nobel . &quot; It ' s strong evidence that this is a place that has improved its academic quality and is committed to keeping that going. &quot; David Merkowitz , public affairs director of the American Council on Education in Washington , agreed that the Nobel will boost USC ' s national reputation . &quot; Having a Nobel laureate on the faculty is a sign of enhancement , &quot; he said . &quot; And I ' m sure they will use it for good measure in terms of recruiting and marketing. &quot; In recent years , USC has been pushing for admission into the big_leagues of national and international research universities . The school , situated south of Downtown , ranks about 20th among American universities in the amount of federal research aid it receives , $ 225 million annually . Five years before UCLA was admitted to the Assn . of American Universities , USC won entrance in 1969 to that premier organization of research institutions , whose membership now totals just 56 schools . More recently , the university has been seeking to bolster the reputation of its undergraduate programs , long the butt -- justified or not -- of in-house criticism and jokes from rivals Stanford and UCLA . USC leaders say that work is bearing fruit in recruiting of better-quality students . The current crop of USC freshmen had an average SAT score just over 1100 , a rise of about 100 points over a decade ago , although still well below the level at Stanford or UCLA . &quot; This will help our reputation , &quot; agreed Michelle Ladd , a senior who is managing editor of the Daily Trojan student newspaper . &quot; People will see us for something other_than football , for a while at least. &quot; During the afternoon , several hundred faculty , staff and students gathered for a champagne reception in which Olah was applauded for more_than a minute as he stood at the podium . Olah said the prize represented a sign that the university was &quot; maturing , &quot; and that its image was changing to that of being a serious research institution . Seated as he talked was Katherine B . Loker , an alumna who has donated millions of dollars over the years in support of Olah ' s work . &quot; I am so excited I am speechless , &quot; she said . &quot; When we first met him , I knew he was a Nobel Prize individual. &quot; She said Olah was the first to call Wednesday morning with news of the award . &quot; Then my sister called five minutes later and said , ' Your man won. ' &quot; During one of the many speeches , Philip Stephens , the chairman of the chemistry_department , drew a round of laughter when he declared : &quot; It is even more important to USC than the football_team winning the national championship. &quot; But on a more serious note , he said the award &quot; makes a statement that USC is a research university of the first rank. &quot; Ironically , the Nobel may have its most important effect in Southern California , USC officials said Wednesday . In some respects , the university is more respected out-of-state than locally , partly because of the cross-town shade cast by UCLA and Caltech . &quot; In some ways , it ' s harder to be recognized in your own back yard , &quot; said Morton Schapiro , an economist who is USC ' s dean of letters , arts and sciences . He forecast future Nobels for USC faculty , a game usually played by those other local schools . &quot; It ' s good to get your first , but there will be other ones , &quot; Schapiro said . Still , the recent edition of The Insider ' s Guide to the Colleges declared that : &quot; USC likes to think_of itself as an extended_family . Not everyone will fit into this clan , but students ready to spend four years partying , meeting future business contacts and doing a little studying might want to enroll. &quot; Olah himself alluded to USC ' s image in remarks to his chemistry_department colleagues just hours after getting the big phone_call Wednesday morning . &quot; I think you should have a balance in any institution and USC is maturing , combining a first-class science and medical research effort with a successful athletic program , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
