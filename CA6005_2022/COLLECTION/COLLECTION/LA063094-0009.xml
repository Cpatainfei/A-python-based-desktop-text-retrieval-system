   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON THE SIMPSON CASE ; RACE AND SEX -- THE LAST TABOO LIVES ; ONCE AGAIN , AMERICA TAPS INTO A FAVORITE WHITE STEREOTYPE -- THE BLACK_MAN AS HYPERSEXUAL AND DANGEROUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The semi-nude picture of O.J. and Nicole Simpson on the cover of People magazine made me shudder . Would this be a chilling reminder to many whites that a black_man , albeit a wealthy and famous one , not only was suspected of murder but also had violated America ' s last taboo against interracial sex ? If so , his indictment would be mine , too . This is not paranoia . Many black_men cringed the moment O.J. became a suspect in the murder of his wife . Many of us were reminded of Bigger Thomas , the character in Richard Wright ' s &quot; Native Son &quot; who murdered a white_woman , reinforcing the ancient white fears of black_men as hypersexual and dangerous . To many black_men , O.J. may become the new Bigger Thomas . Although thousands of Asian , Latino and white_men , some wealthy and prominent , have been accused of sexual crimes and abuses , four black_men have become the symbols of male sexual menace . The Clarence Thomas confirmation_hearings touched_off the national debate over sexual_harassment . Mike Tyson ' s conviction touched_off the debate over &quot; date rape. &quot; A 13-year-old ' s accusation against Michael Jackson touched_off the debate over child sexual abuse . O.J. Simpson ' s arrest has touched_off the debate over domestic violence . There are two reasons for this symbolism . First is the negative view many Americans have of black_men . The dire plight of young black_men has much to do with that view . The California Assembly Commission on the Status of African American Males notes that four out of 10 men entering California prisons are black . Only 43 % of black males under age 21 live with two parents . Black males with a high_school education are twice as likely as white males to be unemployed . The national figures mirror those in California . Nearly 1 # 000 black teen-age males a year die from gunfire , according to the National Center for Health Statistics . Young black males are seven times more likely than whites to end_up as homicide victims . The media obsession with ghetto crack , gangs and poverty has convinced many Americans that black males are hopelessly trapped in a grim netherworld of anger and violence . Even O.J. was not immune . He grew_up in a single-parent household in a tough section of San Francisco . He flirted_with gangs . Some media reports have suggested that only his incredible athletic talent and luck spared him a prison rap sheet . But nothing stirs latent_hostilities toward black_men more_than the X factor of interracial sex . Sexual fear is a product of America ' s long history of racial stereotyping . In early 20th-Century popular literature , black_men were routinely depicted as lustful , sex-crazed brutes . Thomas Dixon in his wildly successful 1905 novel , &quot; The Clansman , &quot; branded the black_man &quot; half child , half animal , whose passions , once aroused , are as the fury of the tiger. &quot; D.W. Griffith immortalized that image for millions of filmgoers in &quot; Birth of a Nation &quot; in 1915 . Film critics still praise it as a classic . In &quot; American Dilemma , &quot; Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal called America ' s perverse preoccupation with black male sexuality &quot; the main defense for segregation. &quot; Clarence Thomas was mindful of this tragic history when he called Anita Hill ' s accusations of sexual misconduct a &quot; high-tech lynching. &quot; It was no accident that the final battle of legal segregation was fought over interracial marriage laws . In 1949 , 30 states prohibited marriage between blacks_and_whites . When the Supreme Court struck_down the prohibition in 1967 , 17 states made interracial marriage a felony offense . Twelve states still had anti-miscegenation laws on the books well into the 1970s . While polls show that the majority of white Americans no longer oppose interracial marriages , a substantial number do . A 1991 General Social Survey conducted by the National Opinion Research_Center reported that one in five whites believes that interracial marriage should be illegal ; marriage between black_men and white_women is frowned_on the most . But even 66 % of those who don ' t oppose interracial marriage say they would oppose a close relative marrying a black_man . Forty-five percent in the survey were opposed to Anglos marrying Latinos or Asians . Many churches aren ' t beacons of enlightenment on mixed marriages , either . Sociologist Ernest Porterfield in &quot; Black_and_White Mixed Marriages &quot; discovered that the majority of mixed couples who attended church before marriage discontinued attendance afterward . South_African expatriate Mark Mathabane , whose wife is white , recounts in &quot; Love in Black_and_White &quot; bitter encounters with racism in America . Mathabane ' s experience is not exceptional . The sight of a black male and white female together often brings hostile stares , insults , harassment and physical attack . This is why black-white marriages are a rarity . According to the 1990 Census , only 4 % of black_men have married white_women . While O.J. gained fame as athlete , entertainer and media personality , he carefully avoided racial or political controversy . This earned him mainstream acceptance , hero status and temporary exemption from racial backlash for marrying white . But many black_men know this exemption doesn ' t apply to them . that ' s why we worry that if O.J. is put_on trial , so will we be .</TEXT>
