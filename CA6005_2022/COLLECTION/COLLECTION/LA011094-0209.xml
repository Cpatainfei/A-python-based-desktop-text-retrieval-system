   <HEADLINE> QUALITY AND HOPES ARE UP AT PALM SPRINGS FILM FESTIVAL ; MOVIES : EIGHTY ENTRIES FROM 22 COUNTRIES ARE EXPECTED TO DRAW MORE THAN 45 # 000 MOVIEGOERS . A BANQUET HONORS SOPHIA LOREN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sonny Bono was clearly befuddled . The ex-mayor of Palm Springs , founder of the 5-year-old Palm Springs International Film Festival , squinted at his notes and gripped the microphone like a man adrift . &quot; Is this thing on ? &quot; he croaked . Those gathered at the Plaza Theater for the festival ' s opening-night screening last Thursday of the_French hit &quot; Les Visiteurs &quot; fidgeted and giggled when Bono held_up a letter from President Clinton but then declined to read it due_to political differences . He then went_on to encourage the current mayor , Lloyd Maryanov , to &quot; carry_on the baton &quot; symbolizing civic progress . Since so many of the Springs ' fabled denizens and their taxes have long since moved to Rancho Mirage , this optimism is evidently based both on the film festival and the legalized gambling ordinance recently passed_by the City_Council . After Bono relinquished the podium , the crowd was jarred back into cinematic reality with &quot; Les Visiteurs , &quot; a French production by director Jean-Marie Poire that tells the story of a 12th-Century knight who runs_afoul of a witch and finds himself and his squire transported to present_times . Here they meet their descendants , stink_up everyone ' s cars with their medieval hygiene and mock the modern bourgeoisie . It ' s a sort of &quot; Monty Python ' s Holy_Grail Meets Feydeau. &quot; Later , at a reception in the courtyard where the local Hollywood Old_Guard showed true esprit by standing patiently in an unmoving buffet line , one man remarked to another , &quot; I hear this film did huge box_office in France. &quot; &quot; Yeah ? &quot; replied his friend . &quot; So did ' The Nutty Professor. ' &quot; Even if opening_night did not quite reach the stellar heights of previous years , the city ' s leaders could take_pride in this year ' s festival , which has attracted more_than 80 entries from 22 countries . Running until through Sunday , the festival is expected to draw more_than 45 # 000 moviegoers . A more select group gathered Saturday night at a $ 250-a-plate banquet honoring Sophia Loren for her screen achievements . Those attending included Bob and Delores Hope , Ginger Rogers , Tippi Hedren , Arthur Hiller and ex-Columbia head Leo Jaffe . Loren , accompanied by her son Eduardo Ponti , said she was genuinely touched by the recognition and felt that since leaving her humble origins in Italy , her &quot; life has been one long dream. &quot; In addition to screenings of Loren ' s more memorable works , including &quot; The Countess From Hong Kong &quot; and &quot; Two Women , &quot; the festival has taken_on a decidedly Italian accent this year in staging the first full retrospective of Federico Fellini ' s work since his death last year . Among the films being shown are &quot; 8 1 / 2 , &quot; &quot; Amacord , &quot; &quot; La Dolce Vita &quot; and &quot; Nights of Caribira. &quot; Indeed , the hottest venues the first few days of the festival were for Italian entries such_as Ricky Tognazzi ' s taut political thriller , &quot; La Scorta , &quot; about four carbinieri trying to protect a magistrate in violence-prone Sicily ; brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani ' s beautifully photographed &quot; Fiorille , &quot; about several generations of a cursed Tuscan clan ; and Francesca Archibugi ' s &quot; Il Grande Cocomero , &quot; about the relationship between a psychiatrist , his emotionally troubled patient and her overprotective mother . All three films have had overflow crowds . Although most film festivals , like Cannes , exist as a marketplace for independents seeking distributors , Palm Springs is a festival in the celebratory sense of the word . In fact , 75 % of the films here already have distribution deals . There is also a growing feeling among both industry professionals and festival devotees that the quality of foreign independents shown here has risen dramatically . One reason mentioned repeatedly is that international co-productions have dramatically raised the technical and artistic quality of independents . For years , filmmakers have complained that while state subsidies gave them the freedom to pursue non-commercial subjects , such reliance also resulted in small budgets and amateur participation on many levels of the production . Nowhere is the international co-production more successfully illustrated than in the growing clout of Canadian independents . This year Canada has 10 films in the festival , including &quot; The Boys of St . Vincent , &quot; a three-hour made-for-TV dramatization of a scandal surrounding the sexual abuse of boys by Catholic clergy at an orphanage ; &quot; La Florida , &quot; about a Quebecois family ' s attempt to run a motel in Florida ; and &quot; Le Sexe des Etoiles , &quot; an Oscar submission about a young_girl ' s struggles with her father ' s new identity as a transsexual . The most eagerly awaited film of the opening weekend , although reactions to it were mixed , was Roman Polanski ' s &quot; Bitter Moon , &quot; a tale of psychological and sexual obsession starring Peter Coyote and Emmanuelle Seigner . Coyote ' s character , during a Mediterranean cruise , narrates to a young Englishman the history of his obsessive , soul-destroying relationship with his wife . While some in the audience were clearly uncomfortable with the graphic nature of the work , writer Larry Gelbart ( &quot; Tootsie &quot; ) said that a viewer has to accept the film as &quot; a very personal view of Polanski on the nature of human relationships. &quot; Abel Ferrara ' s remake of &quot; The Invasion of the Body_Snatchers , &quot; while having made the festival circuit rounds for a year , also screened this weekend . But both late-night performances were attended by only a smattering of insomniacs . Among the films coming this week are the late Cyril Collard ' s autobiographical &quot; Savage Nights &quot; ; Percy Aldon ' s &quot; Younger and Younger &quot; ; an award-winning Spanish film , &quot; Belle Epoque &quot; ; and John Schlesinger ' s &quot; The Innocent. &quot; Information : ( 619 ) 778-8979 .</TEXT>
