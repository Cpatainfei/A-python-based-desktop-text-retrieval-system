   <TEXT> In an era of fires , floods , earthquakes , riots , recession and AIDS , L.A.-area modern_dance suddenly teems with metaphors for survival . Throughout the Southland , a major trend in local work is defined by hyper-athletic , risk-oriented dancing in which contending with physical_objects and with changing architectural conditions reflects feelings about trying to exist in a confined , threatening or out-of-control environment . This isn ' t protest art ; it ' s movement for movement ' s sake . But the physical conditions and structure of the work undeniably address how human_beings cope_with overwhelming events . Tests of gravity , stamina and spatial ingenuity are central to this kind of dancing : How many times can you roll steeply uphill in military_formation ? How many different ways can you move a pile of 50-pound wooden blocks ? How much dance can you cram on a tabletop ? Inside a plexiglass cube ? Onto a single concrete block ? Jacques Heim , Stephanie Gilliland , Joel Christensen , Frank Guevara , Mehmet Sander and Lori DuPeron come from different dance backgrounds , but all have worked locally in this controversial new_style or school or offshoot of postmodernism . Some people are calling their work Hyperdance , partly because its advocates inevitably praise its hyper-physical , hyper-kinetic intensity , while its detractors say it ' s mostly hype . Either way , it ' s different from the hyper-physical work coming_out of other U.S. cities or touring here from Europe , Canada and Japan . Rather than portray social themes or dramatize human_relationships , the trend in L.A. emphasizes objects , architecture and extending the physical limits of dancing . Obviously , all dance involves a quest_for personal bests , with such idioms as ballet , modern and jazz dance particularly intent_on technical expansion : faster footwork , more turns , higher_jumps , longer stretches . But those forms -- and even the postmodernism that made task- oriented motion commonplace on our stages -- typically denied effort . Dancers tried to make_it look easy , to always seem in control . No longer . Watching people swallowed_up by strenuous , uncontrollable processes has become increasingly familiar on L.A. stages . And showing effort has become a sign of honesty , if not a badge of honor . Work like this isn ' t appearing in other U.S. communities in any concentrated fashion , says Sali Ann Kriegsman , director of the dance program at the National Endowment for the Arts . &quot; I can ' t say I ' m seeing more of it ( on a national level ) , &quot; she comments , explaining that narrative and autobiography still dominate contemporary dance elsewhere , and what ' s happening in Southern California could well be a rejection of the emphasis on expressive content . Kriegsman considers Hyperdance to be &quot; part of dancers ' normal appetite for new challenges , new horizons &quot; and finds it a melding of techniques from the martial_arts , the sports world and the physical_fitness craze , along with a deep creative response to &quot; the explorations of the moon and space : overcoming the terror of loss of gravity , the potential for movement that isn ' t grounded in the usual way. &quot; * At Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica , seven members of Jacques Heim ' s Diavolo Dance Theatre swarm up a ramp to the top of a seven-foot-high metal jungle gym and then dive off -- some landing on a platform halfway down , others on the floor below . Three take the plunge face down . Then they do_it again . Throughout Heim ' s &quot; Tete au Carre , &quot; the 10-by-10-by-7-foot jungle gym functions as a city infrastructure , confining the dancers , conditioning their movement options and continually changing around them with the addition of the ramps and platforms , as well as curtains and projection_screens . Heim says the theme is &quot; the relationship between people and architecture , specific environments . And it was very hard to deal with this kind of ( dance ) space . &quot; I got that ( idea ) by living_in L.A. , &quot; he says . &quot; I feel really trapped here , going from point to point in my car , so I wanted to do a piece that is confined , and in the last section I have eight people -- some of them are 6-foot-4 -- inside the jungle gym . &quot; How will all_of them move_in this environment ? &quot; Heim asks . &quot; How will they relate to one another ? I know the way I relate to people here is very different than the way I related to people in Paris or New York . It ' s affecting us and affected most of the movement ( in this piece ) . &quot; The 29-year-old Heim , solidly built with deep-set eyes and a nervous , watchful manner , comes_to Hyperdance from a background in European dance theater . He created and performed street theater in his native Paris , then studied dance both in England and at CalArts . He currently teaches contact improvisation at UCLA and the Orange County School of the Arts and says that , as a choreographer , he goes_back and forth between theater and experimenting with movement . &quot; My goal is to mix those , &quot; he says . &quot; What I try to do is based on relationships -- how we relate to another man , how we relate to a woman , how two women would relate . But when I talk to the dancers , I say I ' m not interested in doing a piece particularly about something , but more to see how far we can go physically with a theme . Especially how far we can go_into stamina . &quot; I ' m very interested in working with non-dancers , people with sports backgrounds , people who are interested in moving , who are quite physical , who are not afraid of risk , who are not afraid of people jumping into them or of falling. &quot; Heim is one of the choreographers set to appear in a sampler program of Hyperdance at Cal State L.A. on March 26 and 27 -- the first event of its kind . * If such films as &quot; The Red Shoes , &quot; &quot; The Turning Point &quot; and &quot; Flashdance &quot; defined the dancing image and aspirations of previous generations , Hyperdancers seem to emulate a strikingly different movie role_model : the infinitely malleable , well-nigh indestructible quicksilver ninja of &quot; Terminator 2. &quot; The high-velocity women ' s attack squadron in Stephanie Gilliland ' s &quot; Coriolanus &quot; certainly comes_close , fusing a gritty , streetwise attitude with intimidating physical force . &quot; We ' re literally inventing a new body in dance , &quot; Gilliland , 41 , exclaims . &quot; You can ' t do the work we ' re doing without having a different body . And it might mean bigger thighs or more developed arm muscles , whatever ' s needed . &quot; My aesthetic happens to be people flinging their bodies in space with abandon , &quot; she says . &quot; I love strength and power -- I find it incredibly beautiful . But I also do very quiet solo work. &quot; Her suite of &quot; Furniture Pieces &quot; has a little of both : high-flying tabletop gymnastics for three women and a solo full of intricate , improvised gymnastic balances located on a carpet-covered cat-scratcher . Why dance on furniture if you ' re not Fred Astaire ? Because working with objects and unlikely spatial formats generates new movement possibilities , Gilliland says . Instead of accepting the stage floor as the dancer ' s God-given habitat , &quot; you alter the place where activity occurs , &quot; she says , &quot; and make_it higher or smaller -- like a table -- or even use a cat-scratcher where it ' s abnormally low but not quite on the ground . You can ' t do on a stage what you can do with these different surfaces and levels. &quot; Gilliland started studying modern_dance in college . At UC Riverside , where she now teaches , she received support as a young choreography student and began making dances in 1977 . &quot; My first work had a comical leaning and I worked much more in conventional movement language , &quot; she recalls , &quot; but I always felt a kind of interest too in rock ' n ' roll energies in my work. &quot; At one point in the ' 80s , Gilliland explored what she calls &quot; crash-and-burn physicality , &quot; then gave it up for &quot; a more fluid , gentle , sensual kind of movement . that ' s when I first appeared in Los Angeles. &quot; Simultaneously tomboyish and feline as a dancer , she explains her conversion to Hyperdance as partly a matter of &quot; inventing myself as an artist and a woman . . . ( and ) confronting the notion of what a woman is capable of at a certain age. &quot; But some of the lure is what she calls &quot; responding to the environment we live_in &quot; : &quot; I think people who are doing this kind of work are somehow predisposed to it and are reacting to the place and the time . Even when I had concerns that maybe I was doing something potentially dangerous to my body or to the other dancers . I wasn ' t able to not do_it . I would go_into the studio and try to make more gentle work , and it just would n ' t come out. &quot; * Joel Christensen , 24 , a blond , wiry dancer who puts a surprisingly whimsical spin on task-based work , says Hyperdance takes the performer into &quot; a different state of being : I see things very differently when my heart is going at a certain pace and my blood is surging and my muscles are getting tired and I have to keep talking to my body and reminding myself of what ' s ahead. &quot; &quot; One major thing that I ' m interested in , &quot; he says , &quot; is demonstrating labor and the human need to work . I think that ' s where I find a large part of the common_denominator with my audience . Because I think we all understand its importance and satisfaction as well as how it provides a structure to our day. &quot; An emerging artist , Christensen is one of two Hyperdance choreographers who have made solos using auto_tires as both dancing partners and trampolines . His &quot; Tired &quot; involves stacking 20 tires in various formations and then destroying each arrangement -- but not before throwing them , jumping into piles of them and bouncing off them in many different ways . He trained in karate as a child and then Golden Gloves boxing_in his early teens before coming_to Los Angeles and signing_up for football and ballet at Beverly Hills High . &quot; But ( visual ) art was really my main focus ever since I was little , &quot; he says . &quot; So physicality and art combined for me in dance . It was the perfect answer. &quot; He went_to New York University but cut classes to spend more time choreographing and so never graduated . When he came_back to L.A. , he joined the Mehmet Sander company for eight months , then left to perform his own program of what he called &quot; industrial dance. &quot; Ambitious and resourceful , he runs a choreography workshop and is producing the Cal State L.A. Hyperdance showcase at the end of the month . He finds a number of connections between Hyperdance and the L.A. environment : &quot; We keep hearing about how violent it is here and how hard you have to work . Also L.A. is a city about the hard body , being strong and beautiful , and this work brings that to the front . But it ' s also a reaction against Hollywood : no acting , no stories , no glamour. &quot; * To meet extreme and sometimes unprecedented demands for speed , stamina and sheer brute force , many of these dancers are now working_out and bulking up as never before , challenging the standard image of a slender or sinewy &quot; dancer ' s body. &quot; Four years ago , Frank Guevara weighed 145 pounds . Now he ' s a hunky 175 . Bulking up has been a conscious program on his part to , in his words , &quot; get a more physical , more masculine look as a dancer . And more strength . For the physical pieces you need to work_out with weights because you need to be stronger . My characters are very macho , so that ( bigger ) body does help a lot . If I was still thin in the upper body , I think it would look funny. &quot; Guevara , 28 , has made just two Hyperdance pieces to date -- one of them not yet seen publicly . He says he was &quot; inspired by Mehmet Sander to test my body , to find_out how much it can take , but obviously in a different way than he does. &quot; He uses Hyperdance techniques to depict character , he says , and especially to address Latino community issues . In &quot; Cursum Perficio , &quot; for instance , he interacts with an auto_tire , portraying a street guy he describes as &quot; very stubborn , challenge-oriented . Maybe not much education but intelligent. &quot; And the tire ? &quot; I think it symbolizes the cycle of life , &quot; Guevara says , &quot; but it ' s basically an object he ' s familiar_with . He finds different ways to connect with the tire : He holds it , brings it through his body , jumps from it , rolls it , dives into it. &quot; Guevara began dancing at 5 , doing folklorico for about six or seven years , and then began training locally at Plaza de la Raza and high_school in modern and jazz dance , along with ballet . He did his first TV_show at 17 and worked as a commercial dancer -- movies , music videos , commercials , industrial shows , exercise videos -- while studying at Cal State L.A. In 1989 , he formed the East L.A. Choreographers ' Showcase as a venue for local work , and toward the end of 1992 started his own company , Dance Theatre of East L.A. He will be appearing at Highways on July 14-17 . * In the past , oppressive processes were dramatized -- with some dancers cast as oppressors and some as the oppressed . But in Hyperdance , choreographers create oppressive structures or physical conditions and then plot strategies for survival . The subject of the dance is executing the dance . But meanings do arise directly from the motion . For instance , in Mehmet Sander ' s &quot; 18 &quot; ( the number of the chapter in Leviticus condemning both nudity and homosexuality ) , he hurled his naked body over and over against a huge cross marked with tape on the stage floor . Resistance to an oppressive religious tradition became symbolized by the act of Sander trying every possible way to accommodate his body to that shape on the floor . Geometry became protest . Sander , 27 , has been working in hyper-physical expression for more_than a decade and now aims for a stark , content-free , futuristic form of movement art that pushes against human limits . His pieces about homosexuality have been replaced in his repertory by these works and severe spatial experiments . &quot; To me , performance is a sacrifice , &quot; he declares . &quot; When I go onstage , there is the expectation that it shouldn ' t be a comfortable experience . If you don ' t occupy the most dangerous and unusual spaces , then it ' s not an interesting dance to me . &quot; I ' m not really happy with what the body can do , &quot; he says . &quot; I want it to be manipulated by outside forces and try to compete with them . So I really need the help of objects that move faster than human movement . Cars and bullets , for example. &quot; Sander ' s &quot; Ricochet &quot; involves shooting rubber bullets through a hole in the transparent wall of an empty bulletproof room and tracing the exact rebound pattern . Next , dancers go_into the space and &quot; try to move as fast as the bullets and hit exactly the same spots , &quot; he says . Another piece requires the dancers to try to outrun their own reflections . Impossible , of course . &quot; But even if it seems that way , &quot; he argues , &quot; by proving ourselves wrong , it ' s going_to bring a new ( movement ) vocabulary or system into being. &quot; An outdoor piece scheduled for next year will consist_of what Sander calls &quot; duets for four dancers and four cars . It was originally four duets for eight dancers , and I changed four of the dancers with the cars so that the integrity of the duet is the same but the dancers are challenged more . &quot; The cars are going 30 to 35 miles per hour , moving_back and forward in laps , so you ' re occupying pretty much the same space as they do . When they come toward you , you have to jump high enough so that , by the time the car comes , you land on the hood and don ' t roll_off . It ' s just like having your body thrown to another dancer : You jump from one car moving 30 miles to another moving 30 miles . So the space changes more drastically and faster. &quot; The Salzburg Festival is negotiating for the premiere , Sander says . Some members of his company declined to become cast in the car piece and Sander says he respects their decision . &quot; Maybe they ' re not ready mentally , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s definitely a mind-over-body piece . Some of my dancers need a warm-up class . I never do a warm-up . I can march to the stage_right now and do any of my works . &quot; If I threw you in the middle of a freeway , would you say , ' Well , I ' m not warmed_up to run ? ' he asks with a sneer . &quot; If you have the idea in your head 24 hours a day that you can do whatever you want at any moment , you can . I want the car piece to take that ( idea ) as a core , for the dancers to have great urgency to execute the piece and survive. &quot; Sander was born in Istanbul , Turkey , and studied dance in London , at Harvard , at the American Dance Festival and at Cal State Long_Beach . His work has been seen at nearly all_of the local modern-dance venues , and he appeared in seven European festivals last year alone . He choreographed Rachel Rosenthal ' s &quot; Zone &quot; earlier this season , and UCLA recently added an additional Sander company performance at Schoenberg Hall on May 6 when those on May 7 and 8 nearly sold_out . Alone among these choreographers , Sander says that the Los Angeles environment has had no direct effect upon his work : &quot; I would be doing the same kind of work in Chicago or anywhere else , &quot; he says , though he acknowledges that &quot; the response and interaction with the city would be different. &quot; Fiercely protective of his individuality , he objects to being linked in any trend with emerging artists who combine his priorities with more traditional ways of working . Such conflicts confirm that Hyperdance exists not as a unified movement but a constellation of artists with vastly different creative goals and levels of experience . * To Lori DuPeron , however , there ' s a connection , &quot; an underlying purpose . It may be just about doing the motions , &quot; she says , &quot; and doing them as hard as you can , and it ' s very much about geometry and the laws of gravity and different kinds of locomotion . But in the best pieces there ' s something to be perceived beyond that . Memo ( Mehmet Sander ) says nothing else is going_on . But I don ' t believe him . It ' s about the human condition usually. &quot; Once a fixture on the local dance-based performance art scene , DuPeron ended her stage career by retraining herself for Hyperdance by lifting weights and going_back to ballet . Then she set the local community on its ear with &quot; ties that bind . . . , &quot; a 10-minute solo in which she emerged out of billowing fog with 4 1 / 2-foot ropes attached_to the ends of her limbs -- lashing the ropes and her body with feral intensity . DuPeron , now 31 and bi-coastal , wants to be a dance producer , and she retains a special_interest in an approach to movement that she calls &quot; one of the most shocking and sophisticated tools that we have for communication right now. &quot; To DuPeron , Hyperdance &quot; walks a fine line between circus , spectacle and art , &quot; and she worries that its fans will think it is self-generated , invented in Southern California out of whole cloth . In fact , each Hyperdance choreographer can cite a long list of terpsichorean ancestors . Nearly a quarter-century ago , for example , Trisha Brown suspended dancers from the tops of rooms and even buildings on harnesses and had them dance up the walls , claiming a whole new spatial dimension for choreography . Her innovations represent one of the starting_points for Hyperdance . Other creative precedents include Pilobolus ' early experiments with bringing unorthodox movement vocabularies into the theater , Kei Takei ' s grueling rituals , plus Molissa Fenley ' s controversial training techniques for achieving expanded stamina onstage . More recently , Bebe Miller has manipulated velocity , weight and openly acknowledged effort to heroic effect , and Elizabeth Streb has taken dancers far from the conventional stage picture_frame into dynamic new performing realms . * Although few Hyperdance choreographers readily acknowledge it , MTV has also had its effect -- principally through its illusion ( achieved by film_editing ) that dancers can work full-out indefinitely . Living_up_to this Hollywood fantasy can be hell on the body : DuPeron compares the physical demands of Hyperdance to &quot; taking a beating or walking on hot coals. &quot; Gilliland concedes that Hyperdance gets a bad rap for not being body-friendly , &quot; the notion that somehow we ' re compromising our physical well-being for our work. &quot; In fact , all dancers suffer from injuries and the bulked-up Hyper crowd also gets its share . Frank Guevara , for instance , sprained his ankle jumping_off his tire . Mehmet Sander recently suspended rehearsals of his car piece when a company member dislocated a shoulder . Joel Christensen has had two dance-related knee surgeries that definitely make his seven-minute hopping solo &quot; Boing &quot; full of personal risk . But the most exposed Hyperdance injury to date belongs_to Rebecca Butala , a member of Jacques Heim ' s Diavolo Dance Theatre . On the opening_night of a sold-out engagement at Highways in January , one of the pipes_in the company ' s jungle gym came loose when four women jumped_on it . A corner of the pipe hit Butala ' s head , knocked her down and cut her . &quot; In rehearsals , more drastic things had happened , &quot; Heim says , &quot; so she continued to dance . But then she saw blood was pouring_out of her head , so she stopped and crawled out . We ended the performance. &quot; Butala received six stitches and was back dancing the next night , &quot; still very dizzy , &quot; Heim recalls , &quot; and we all_the time paid_attention to her and knew what to do if she wanted to stop. &quot; He also changed the piece slightly so that male members of the company braced the jungle gym while the women performed . With contact improvisation , dance is literally a process of touch-and-go -- so it ' s comforting to learn that Heim ' s company is covered by medical insurance . &quot; We try things , &quot; he says with a shrug . &quot; Sometimes it doesn ' t work , sometimes we get hurt. &quot; This element of danger makes some Hyperdance audiences behave as if they ' re at the circus . But it isn ' t present merely for mindless daredevil thrills . It exists as part of a commitment to making_good on the broken promises of postmodernism : stripping away every literary , pictorial and theatrical embellishment to discover what dance uniquely is or might be . * When Mehmet Sander speaks_of using speed and risk to defeat audience analysis -- in other words , trying to force viewers to experience a dance as a physical act before they can interpret it intellectually -- he ' s reminding us that dance isn ' t important for what it means but what it does . This may sound anti-intellectual , but dance , after all , is not about ideas : It ' s about movement in space . Whatever ideas condition it , emanate from it or are imposed on it , it ' s only the movement you see . And movement can inspire or devastate you directly , kinetically , bypassing your centers of understanding for a much deeper impact . Hyperdance wants you to perceive the movement first and foremost , before laying any trip on it . To that end , it may make connections with familiar work activities , everyday objects , fears we all have of falling , of confinement , of being overwhelmed by cataclysmic events . Of trying to survive in the City of the Angels . Or , at its purest , it may focus ( in Mehmet Sander ' s phrase ) simply on putting a human_body in a space where it ' s never been before .</TEXT>
