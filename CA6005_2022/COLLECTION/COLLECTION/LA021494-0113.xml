   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER ; NO MATTER THE RACE , MOES WIN ; SKIING : HIS FAMILY BARELY ARRIVES IN TIME TO SEE THE U.S. DOWNHILLER ' S GOLD-MEDAL RUN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The race was_on . It began Friday , on a mountain and in an airport . At opposite sides of the world . On snow . In Norway , Tommy Moe licked his chops after an Olympic downhill training run here as he sized_up Marc Girardelli , Kjetil Andre Aamodt and the rest . In Alaska , father Tom and stepmother Tyra boarded a plane in Palmer . No way dad misses the gold-medal run . Saturday , Moe finished fourth in final downhill training and almost had to bite his lip to contain his confidence . Andy Mill , the former downhill racer turned network commentator , tried to goad Moe into predicting victory , a la American Bill Johnson in 1984 at Sarajevo . Moe was tempted , but he would n ' t bite . But Moe knew . He became only the third American male ever to win an Olympic gold medal in Alpine skiing on Sunday , defeating Aamodt by 0.04 seconds in the closest Alpine race in Olympic history . The flight plan called_for Tom and Tyra to make a leisurely connection through Kennedy airport in New York , then straight through to Oslo . They ended_up in Dallas . Tommy checked his skis . Tom Sr . checked his pulse , then the departures . The morning of Sunday ' s downhill , as the_Swiss took a_few practice rings on their cowbells , Moe was almost melancholy . Someone caught him yawning . Moe had never won a World Cup race . He was second once . What did he know ? Mr. Moe , in the meantime , was blowing fuses . There ' s only so_much one Moe can take . The flight went Palmer to Dallas , Dallas to Copenhagen , Copenhagen to Oslo . Finally , at 9:30 p.m. Saturday night , it went Oslo to Lillehammer . Start to finish , it took 46 hours . Or was it finished ? Not trusting anyone ' s transportation_system , Tom Moe awoke at 5 a.m. to catch the first bus to Kvitfjell , usually about an hour ' s trip . At the bus_stop , he and 4 # 000 others waited . Tom and Tyra were crushed by the humanity , shut_out of one bus after another . No taxis either . Or dog sleds . Four and a half hours after his wake-up call -- 90 minutes before race time -- Tom and Tyra were still in Lillehammer . &quot; At 9:30 , I was screaming mad , &quot; Tom said . &quot; I went_into the ( phone_company office ) and started screaming at them , anyone I could yell at , then went_up and stormed past 4 # 000 people , they were all_the way up into town. &quot; In one final , exasperating moment , Tom grabbed Tyra and started elbowing a path through people to the bus door . &quot; I was going_to get there and that was it , &quot; Tom said . At Kvitfjell , Tommy Moe started to loosen_up . He would be the eighth racer down the_hill , a favorable starting position . He remained calm and collected . &quot; I ' ve been working a lot on my mental preparation and I ski best when I ' m relaxed , &quot; Moe said later . The bus pulled into Kvitfjell a little after 10:30 . Tom and Tyra , exhausted but relieved , rushed to the entrance gate . What could happen now ? &quot; We couldn ' t get our tickets , &quot; Tom said . &quot; You ' d think they ought to take_care of some of the parents who helped the kids here. &quot; Two minutes before Luxembourg ' s Girardelli left the downhill starting gate , Tom and Tyra got their tickets and fought their way to the right side of the grandstand . Not quite box_seats . The race was_on . Girardelli set the pace with a time of 1:46 : .09. Following him down were Hannes Trinkl of Austria in 1:46.22 , Peter Runggaldier of Italy in 1:46.39 , Pietro Vitalini of Italy in 1:46.48 and Daniel Mahrer of Switzerland in 1:46.55. Remarkably , the top five racers were within . 46 of each other , but the times were getting slower , if only fractionally . It appeared that Girardelli had taken the best race from the course . Canada ' s Cary Mullen , racer No . 6 , then crashed after catching an edge , creating the first dramatic pause of the Olympics . As officials tended to Mullen , who was not seriously injured , home-country hero Aamodt waited above in the gate , a trainer massaging his thighs , Norwegians cheering wildly and waving flags_down in the basin . Mullen finally cleared , Aamodt shot_down the_hill in a blur , the crowd becoming more frenzied whenever the scoreboard posted his intermediate times . Aamodt was ahead at every race segment , then leaned into the wire as the new leader at 1:45.79. He got a hero ' s welcome . &quot; When I came_to the finish , I was really enjoying life , &quot; Aamodt said . &quot; There were 30 # 000 people shouting . It only lasted two minutes . Then Tommy came down. &quot; Moe wobbled a bit at the start and was only sixth after the first interval . Then he made_up for lost time , and was in first place after the third interval as he streaked through the remaining sections , Svingen , Bukkerittet , Boygen , Loftet and Klemma . Moe crossed at 1:45.75 , four-hundredths of a second faster than Aamodt . From his cramped position near the grandstand , Tom Moe pounded on the guard railing and implored that he be allowed across the finish area . His son looked_up at the scoreboard . &quot; For me , the biggest surprise was when I came_down and saw my name and I was first on the board , &quot; Moe said . Moe still had to sweat out some big-time racers -- the gold busters -- among them defending Olympic champion Patrick Ortlieb of Austria and William Besse , the swift Swiss . One after another they tried , but no one could beat Moe ' s time . There were only two scares . Canada ' s Ed Podivinsky , starting 21st , stopped a_few hearts with his time of 1:45.87 , which was good_enough for the bronze medal . Then Nicolas Burtin of France , the last man Moe really feared , finished sixth on the chewed-up course , after having started 33rd . Kyle Rasmussen , Moe ' s teammate , started 26th and shot all_the way to 11th . Was the course changing ? Was the track getting faster ? Moe and Aamodt , standing side_by_side , watched and waited . AJ Kitt , another American of promise , posed the last real threat from the 30th position . But it soon became clear that this was not Kitt ' s course , or his day . He finished 17th . After the top 30 racers were done , Moe realized that no one from the second division could pull_off a miracle . His time would hold . He would be the only American besides Johnson to have won Olympic gold in downhill . Later , Aamodt was asked if the delay after Mullen ' s crash had hurt his chances . He jokingly replied , &quot; I think it hurt me by about five-hundredths , &quot; the margin separating him from the gold . Tom Moe , draped in a conspicuous fur_coat he called &quot; a timber_wolf , &quot; was finally able to bust through security and join his son . &quot; I just looked_at him , &quot; Moe Sr . said . &quot; We don ' t have to say much. &quot; It was a different look from the one Tom Moe had flashed his son after Tommy had finished 28th in super-G in the 1992 Games in Albertville . That look , one of disgust , had reduced Tommy to tears . &quot; I was so hard on him , &quot; his father says now , remorsefully . &quot; It made me feel_like maybe ( the race ) was actually mine instead of Tommy ' s . For this Olympics , whatever he did was fine. &quot; The Moes are not the Waltons . Tommy ' s mother , Joann Persons , remarried after she and Tom split and is living_in Whitefish , Mont . She was not here for the race . Tommy is not John-Boy . At 13 , he was caught smoking marijuana and was shipped off to live with his father in Palmer . Tom Sr . runs a river-rafting business and used to be a construction worker . Before that , he worked as a smoke jumper -- &quot; I jumped_out of planes to fight fires. &quot; Tom Sr . figured he could straighten his son out . But Tommy loved the high life . At 16 , he was caught with marijuana again and suspended from his local ski team . &quot; It really irritated me , &quot; Tom Sr . said . &quot; I thought I would do my own discipline. &quot; Moe took his son to work_on a construction project on a barren , brutal stretch of nothingness called Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands . &quot; Dutch Harbor is right close to hell , &quot; Tom Sr . said after Sunday ' s race . Tommy stayed a month and a half . &quot; I think he learned a lesson , &quot; his father said . &quot; He ' s a skier , not a contractor. &quot; By all accounts , Moe has been a straight_arrow since Dutch Harbor . He says his dance with drugs was all part of growing_up . &quot; A lot of people know me as a drug_user , &quot; Tommy said at his post-race news_conference . &quot; That wasn ' t true . I was just experimenting , being a normal American kid. &quot; And he ' s come a long way from Palmer . Late in 1992 , Moe , who will turn 24 on Thursday , wanted to quit the World Cup circuit after a string of mediocre performances . He sought his father ' s advice . Unlike at Albertville , Tom Sr . was not upset with his son . He did not call him a quitter . Instead , he extended his hand . He told his son to come_home . He said he understood the strains of ski_racing in Europe . Moe went_home , did some free skiing , spent time with his dad and an older brother , Mike . Moe began the Games ranked ninth in both downhill and super-G . He has twice placed third this season in World Cup races , once in each discipline . For this career turn , he thanks his father . &quot; I would n ' t have any of this if it weren ' t for him , his guiding and support , &quot; Tommy said . &quot; I made him tear his hair out , but he made me learn what you can have if you put your mind to something. &quot; Maybe it was meant to be . Although Moe deprived Aamodt and Norway of the gold , he sort of kept it in the country . In the 1800s , Moe ' s great-great-great grandfather emigrated to the United States from Oslo . &quot; They shouldn ' t feel too_bad , &quot; Tom Moe said . &quot; Because a Norwegian still got a medal. &quot; And his father got_to see it .</TEXT>
