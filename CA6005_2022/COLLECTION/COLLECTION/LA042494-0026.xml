   <HEADLINE> THE MARRIAGE OF MAO AND STALIN ; UNCERTAIN PARTNERS : STALIN , MAO , AND THE KOREAN_WAR , BY SERGI N . GONCHAROV , JOHN W . LEWIS AND XUE LITAL ( STANFORD_UNIVERSITY PRESS : $ 45 ; 393 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two of the most tantalizing mysteries still remaining after glasnost are the closeness of the Sino-Soviet alliance that followed World_War_II and the origins of the decision to start the Korean_War . &quot; Uncertain Partners &quot; offers a number of chilling and important revelations about both . Illuminating the intrigue , manipulation and paranoia of Russia ' s Josef Stalin , China ' s Mao Zedong and North_Korea ' s Kim Il Sung , &quot; Uncertain Partners &quot; depicts the arm-twisting that led North_Korea to invade South_Korea and outlines the dimensions of Russia and China ' s volatile , decade-long alliance . The authors -- Sergei Goncharov is a senior adviser to Boris Yeltsin ; John Lewis , a professor of Chinese politics at Stanford ; and Xue Litai , a research associate at Stanford -- wrote this book ( &quot; a child of discovery &quot; ) after mining Soviet archives and the Hoover ' s Institution ' s East Asian Collection . Their sketches of Mao and Stalin portray flawed and sometimes petty leaders , ensnared by past experience and ruthless and conniving in pursuing foreign_policy goals . Mao ' s principles in dealing with Moscow and Washington were the ancient ones of &quot; playing one barbarian off against the other , &quot; the authors write , and of &quot; uniting and dividing by political manipulation. &quot; Following World_War_II , Mao was faced with no small dilemma : the need for total victory in the civil_war in China ; the need to reunify and rebuild China after the conclusion of the civil_war ; and the need to align China with one of the two world blocks -- the Soviet_Union or the U.S. These he had to accomplish without compromising too_much sovereignty or becoming a satellite to the new partner . Stalin , on the other hand , focused_on national security . Fixated on &quot; the coming confrontation between communism and capitalism , the inevitable Third_World War that would deliver the death blow to world imperialism , &quot; Stalin , the authors write , wanted to control the timing of the confrontation . He had to walk a fine line to complete his Asian agenda without going_to_war with the U.S. in Asia . To do so , he needed to maintain the fiction of non-involvement in Asian affairs . For Stalin , the battlefield would be in Europe , but he &quot; needed to control Mao ' s relations with the Americans ; only then could Mao ' s power be employed against the United States and coordinated with Soviet actions . In addition , Stalin needed to ensure that the Soviet bufferzone in China would be preserved. &quot; The writers argue that Mao allied_with Stalin to seek national security , while Stalin turned_to Mao in_order to get a &quot; safety_belt &quot; to counter the U.S. encirclement he thought was imminent . The necessity to isolate China from the U.S. drove Stalin ' s alliance with Mao Zedong . How did the Korean_War fit into the national interests of China and the Soviet_Union ? The authors make_it clear that the Soviets were &quot; firmly in the saddle &quot; in North_Korea with Kim Il Sung installed as the national_leader and with &quot; Soviet Koreans &quot; -- those educated and trained in Russia -- in positions of military authority . They argue that the Chinese , with obvious interest in neighboring North_Korea , were in no position to vie with the Soviet_Union for influence because China was consumed with its civil_war . Thus , the authors conclude , the North_Korean invasion of South_Korea on June 25 , 1950 &quot; was pre-planned , blessed , and directly assisted by Stalin and his generals , and reluctantly backed by Mao at Stalin ' s insistence. &quot; ( Mao was reluctant in part because he intended to use his military to invade Taiwan. ) Stalin , hoping to avoid a Soviet-American confrontation in Korea , wished to stay in the background . He &quot; determined that the way to do this was to implicate Mao in the decision and thereby make him bear the full burden for ensuring Kim ' s survival if the Americans intervened. &quot; With Mao ' s armies -- called the Chinese People ' s Volunteers -- committed in the fight in Korea , his plan to invade Taiwan evaporated . A fuller portrait of the birth and demise of the Sino-Soviet alliance and of the origins of the Korean_War -- still shadowed by secrecy and intrigue -- is likely to emerge as more Soviet archives open and as former Soviet , Chinese , and Korean officials go public with their stories . In the meantime , we benefit greatly from this uniquely multinational study of an alliance that incited brutal combat in Korea through what the authors rightly call &quot; reckless war-making of the worst kind. &quot;</TEXT>
