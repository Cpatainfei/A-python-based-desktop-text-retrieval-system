   <HEADLINE> WORLD_VIEW ; MORE FACES AT U.N. TABLE ? ; SECURITY_COUNCIL NEEDS TO GROW , MOST AGREE -- AND NATIONS ARE LOBBYING FIERCELY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When President Franklin D . Roosevelt helped create the United Nations , he envisioned a Security_Council with &quot; five policemen &quot; defending the world against aggression . He certainly did not see Germany or Japan among the policemen . Far from candidates for police recruitment , they were the enemy states of World_War_II , and the Security_Council was supposed to beat them down should they ever try to cause trouble again . But now , as the United Nations approaches its 50th anniversary , there is a mood for reform , and many members , including the United States , agree that Germany and Japan should finally take a place alongside the Big Five -- the United States , Russia , Britain , France and China -- as permanent members of the Security_Council , the international_organization ' s most powerful and significant arm . Yet despite the general_agreement , change may_not come for several years . The U.N. member nations so far cannot decide whether to enlarge the council by designating other permanent members . Even if that decision is made , there remains the question of which nations to choose , and whether any would have the veto powers of the Big Five . Approval of Germany and Japan may be withheld until other nations are chosen in the bargaining for a package deal . An amendment to the U.N. Charter requires approval by two-thirds of the General_Assembly but can be killed by any member of the Big Five , each of which has veto power . Lobbying is now rampant , and suitors are tugging diplomats one way and another . India , Nigeria and Brazil -- because of their large populations -- strike some as logical choices for an enlarged council . But rival contenders -- Pakistan , Indonesia , South_Africa , Egypt , Argentina and Mexico -- do not like the idea of being pushed_aside . Nor does Italy , the third member of the World_War_II Axis powers , like the idea of giving_way for Japan and Germany . Pakistan has warned the United Nations against &quot; creating new centers of privilege &quot; while trying to fix the problem of an inequitable Security_Council . &quot; The longer the discussion goes_on , the more the blood_heats up , &quot; a senior British official said . &quot; But the question is not Germany and Japan . The rejected ones are the problem . Their intention is to avoid adding the extra permanent members because they won ' t be part of it . &quot; But it will be likely settled in 1996 or 1997 . It ' s not easy to put it off. &quot; More pessimistic analysts , however , predict no realignments will be made until the next century . Yet some kind of reform of the Security_Council seems inevitable . Looking_to the 50th anniversary , which will be celebrated next October , U.N. diplomats started the process a_couple_of years ago , setting_up a special committee on revamping the Security_Council and asking every government to submit proposals to it . The committee has sifted through mounds of paper but is far from ready to reveal its recommendations . The Security_Council , which has the authority to order military_action against a government that is threatening international peace and security , is now made_up of the Big Five plus 10 other countries that serve for two-year terms . The 10 now are Brazil , Spain , Pakistan , Djibouti and New Zealand ( whose terms expire at the end of this year ) and Nigeria , Oman , Rwanda , the Czech Republic and Argentina ( whose terms expire at the end of 1995 ) . For the 179 members of the United Nations who are not one of the Big Five , winning a stint on the Security_Council is a meaningful moment in their national histories . Depression descends upon ambassadors of non-permanent members once their terms are up . They are forced once again to devote most of their time and energy to U.N. bodies such_as the General_Assembly that talk a lot but produce very little . Yet even to have served means membership in a select group . Eighty countries have never served on the Security_Council . And 44 have been elected to only one two-year term in the last 49 years . Italy has provoked a good_deal of discussion with a plan that would keep Japan and Germany from a permanent seat . Italy ' s per-capita gross_domestic_product , a measure of national wealth , is greater than that of three permanent members -- Britain , Russia and China -- and the Italians see no reason for Japan and Germany to join the charmed circle if they cannot . Italy , in fact , fears that Germany and Japan may scavenge enough votes for permanent seats on the council and then somehow kill the chances for anyone else . An Italian diplomat , sure that the Germans and Japanese were wooing the Third_World , said : &quot; They need 108 votes to get a resolution accepted , and we fear that they will present it ( the resolution ) out_of_the_blue as soon as they realize they have enough votes . We are therefore lobbying with those countries too to get votes against Germany and Japan and stop them. &quot; At the same time , the Italians have devised a complicated proposal that they hope will satisfy everyone . Under the Italian plan , the Security_Council would have three categories of members : * The Big Five that now have the veto : the United States , Russia , China , Britain and France . * A pool of 20 rich or large or populous or militarily efficient or culturally significant countries that would rotate every two years into 10 semi-permanent seats . None would have a veto . Italy does not name the 20 , but Italy , Japan , Germany , India , Pakistan , Indonesia , Nigeria , Egypt , South_Africa , Brazil , Mexico , Argentina and Canada would surely be included . * Five to 10 more non-permanent members elected from the remaining 159 other countries for two-year terms . The Italian proposal , however , is cumbersome and so far has attracted little support . &quot; The Italian ambassador is very active , &quot; a British diplomat said , &quot; but it is not enough . To create a third category of members is just a silly way to walk_around the problem , and it can jeopardize the effectiveness of the council. &quot; Japan and Germany intend to go_on the Security_Council with somewhat different commitments than those set_down in 1945 . As originally conceived , the permanent members of the Security_Council had a special obligation to use their armed forces to put_down aggression . But Japan , though willing to let troops serve as U.N. peacekeepers , does not allow the use of force by its soldiers in a U.N. military operation . In theory , Germany could send its troops into combat for the United Nations , but it has never done so in the past . Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono insists that a lack of commitment to deploy armed forces should not disqualify his country in a modern United Nations . &quot; Today the international community expects the U.N. to play all sorts of roles -- in peace and security , disarmament , diseases , non-proliferation , development , et cetera , et cetera , &quot; Kono said in a recent interview . In fact , noting that the Big Five are all nuclear_powers , Kono said : &quot; It is important to have the countries that are non-nuclear states on the Security Council. &quot; Although Kono did not bring it up , there are strong pressures , especially from the United States , for Japan and Germany to pay a larger share of the U.N. budget , and the two economic powers are unlikely to do so unless they see a seat on the Security_Council in their future . When the first proposals to enlarge the council emerged in 1992 , the George_Bush Administration was lukewarm , fearing a weakening of the U.N. body that had proved so vital to Western interests during the Persian_Gulf_War of 1991 . But the Clinton_Administration has changed that policy . Deputy Ambassador Karl F . Inderfurth told the General_Assembly in mid-October that &quot; we enthusiastically endorse Japan and Germany for permanent membership. &quot; The Clinton_Administration would also add three more non-permanent seats , bringing the total on the council to 20 -- a Big Seven ( the current five plus Germany and Japan ) with veto power , plus 13 non-permanent members elected for two-year terms . Inderfurth also endorsed a popular proposal that would allow non-permanent members to run_for reelection to the council . They now must step_down after a two-year term . This proposal is a sop to countries such_as Nigeria , Brazil and Italy , which presumably have enough clout to whip_up support for reelection , but the idea would surely not satisfy their desire for a permanent seat . There are numerous other proposals . Many Third_World countries believe that the Security_Council should be expanded whether or not permanent members are added . They believe that the current membership of the Security_Council is weighted in favor of Europe and that the poorer countries of the world merit more representation . The world has changed , and the United Nations should recognize this . For example , Africa provides 52 members of the United Nations , nearly 30 % of the total , but now has two seats on the Security_Council , less than 15 % of the seats there . Since 1966 , when the Security_Council was expanded from 11 to 15 members , the 10 non-permanent seats have been allotted according to a set formula : five from Africa and Asia , two from Latin_America , one from Eastern Europe and two from Western Europe and the industrialized British_Commonwealth countries . Some Third_World countries want to expand the non-permanent seats to 16 and allot them this way : five from Africa , four from Asia , three from Latin_America , two from Western Europe and the industrialized Commonwealth , one from Eastern Europe , and one to alternate from different regions . Britain and several other countries have warned the United Nations against doing anything that might diminish the effectiveness of the Security_Council . Others have warned of opening a Pandora ' s box by changing its makeup . But Third_World governments look_on arguments like these as a smoke_screen to hide privilege . Britain is a permanent member of the Security_Council not because of its size or power or wealth but because of its history as a victor of World_War_II . Adding Japan and Germany and others would diminish British importance in the Security_Council . In fact , both Britain and France were hostile at first to any change . &quot; The Americans , &quot; British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said earlier this year , &quot; have a saying , ' If it ain ' t broke , don ' t fix it. ' And I think there is something to be said for that. &quot; But both Britain and France , perhaps facing the inevitable , have changed their policy and now support adding Japan , Germany and perhaps a_few others . American conservatives oppose enlarging the Security_Council because , as the Heritage Foundation put it in a recent report , &quot; adding more countries . . . will dilute American influence. &quot; The report added that , since some of the new Third_World members could represent dictatorships , &quot; an expanded Security_Council will be more likely to oppose American values and interests. &quot; But this did not dissuade the Clinton_Administration from pushing ahead . In his speech to the General_Assembly , U.S. Deputy Ambassador Inderfurth noted that some governments are urging a delay in enlarging the Security_Council because the world is so unsettled . &quot; For the United States , &quot; Inderfurth said , &quot; this is a false choice . The case to strengthen the council is compelling precisely because of the mounting tumult of the post-Cold War world and dangers it poses for all_of us , not 10 years from now , but today. &quot; Times researcher Paolo Mastrolilli contributed to this article . The Italian Plan Italy has devised a complex plan for the U.N. Security_Council that seems to satisfy many concerns -- except perhaps efficiency . It would keep the council ' s five permanent members plus five or 10 non-permanent members . But it would add 10 semi-permanent members , without veto power , drawn from a pool of 20 nations . Likely candidates would be Germany , Japan , Italy , Nigeria , South_Africa , Egypt , Canada , Mexico , Brazil , Argentina , India , Pakistan , Indonesia , Australia , Czech Republic , Sweden , South_Korea , Jamaica , Costa Rica and Bangladesh . The council would then total 20 or 25 -- representative but be cumbersome . New Place_Settings ? The U.N. Security_Council -- five permanent members plus 10 rotating members -- reflects its World_War_II origins . The Big Five ( top ) , which hold veto power , were Allies in that war . Under one proposal ( bottom ) , the former Axis powers of Japan and Germany would also become permanent members , along with three populous Third_World nations -- most likely Brazil , India and Nigeria . There would be no change in the 10 non-permanent members , which serve two-year terms . The question of expanding veto powers is being debated . * Current Permanent Members : United States , Russia , China , France , Britain * Possible Realignment United States , India , Russia , Nigeria , China , Brazil , France , Germany , Britain , Japan</TEXT>
