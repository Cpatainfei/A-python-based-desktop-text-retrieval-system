   <HEADLINE> O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM : THERE ' S A DOWNSIDE TO CELEBRITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The music has stopped at the Celebrity Theatre . Actions in a pending bankruptcy case could determine when it can play again and who will be presenting it . Attempting to hold_on to the theater is Edward J . Haddad , whose company , California Celebrity Theatre Inc. , has leased the building since June 1987 from its owner , the Leo Freedman Foundation . Haddad ' s company filed for Chapter 11 protection Dec . 16 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana . Court documents reveal that Haddad is at_odds with both Avalon Attractions , the Encino-based concert company that he hired to run the Celebrity , and the Freedman Foundation . Haddad and the foundation have been engaged in a lawsuit over whether California Celebrity has met its rent obligations and is entitled to retain its lease on the 2 # 800-capacity theater-in-the-round . According to a document in the bankruptcy file , Haddad ' s company ( he is the president and sole shareholder of California Celebrity ) earned $ 550 # 000 from theater operations in 1991 and $ 440 # 000 in 1992 . But its 1993 income was zero , because , according to one of Haddad ' s filings in the case , &quot; Avalon Attractions has not remitted funds. &quot; &quot; The plan is to get Avalon out of there , &quot; said Albert M . Sheppard , Haddad ' s bankruptcy attorney . Sheppard said he could not answer other questions pertaining to the theater . Haddad could not be reached for comment . Contacted at the theater recently , Haddad ' s brother , Alex , said &quot; everything ' s on_the_go , moving forward . . . . We ' ve got_to start booking and stuff. &quot; But he said only Edward Haddad could answer questions concerning the Celebrity ' s financial situation and its plans for resuming concert bookings . The most recent show at the Celebrity was_on New Year ' s Eve , with comedian Howie Mandel . No shows have been booked for 1994 . A recorded message on the theater ' s business_lines advises that &quot; upcoming events will be announced shortly , so keep checking with us. &quot; * Randy Brogna , vice_president of venue operations for Avalon Attractions , said the company is unwilling to book more shows at the Celebrity while Haddad ' s bankruptcy petition goes_forward . Brogna said that since March , 1993 , Avalon has been under contract to manage the Celebrity for Haddad . Brogna acknowledged that Avalon did not turn_over any theater revenues to Haddad ' s company in 1993 . The reason , he said , was that Haddad owed the money to Avalon for &quot; operational fees and management fees &quot; dating_back at least to 1992 . Brogna said representatives of Haddad locked Avalon out of the Celebrity just before the Mandel show on New Year ' s Eve . &quot; I couldn ' t address his motives , &quot; Brogna said . &quot; He has taken it upon himself to change the locks . My information is he ' s in the building , attempting to operate. &quot; Avalon would like to resume promoting at the Celebrity when the theater ' s financial situation becomes stable again , Brogna said . &quot; We love the building , we support the building , and I think it ' s a very important building for the Orange County marketplace . I hope the Celebrity Theatre doesn ' t remain dark for a long_time . That all depends_on the courts and ( the Freedman Foundation ) . &quot; * The Celebrity ' s attractions have been wide-ranging , from country singers such_as Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson to rapper L.L. Cool J to such R &amp; B acts_as Luther Vandross and the O ' Jays , to folkie Gordon Lightfoot and the rock_band Squeeze . Ellis Stern , co-trustee for the Freedman Foundation , a nonprofit philanthropy that supports the arts , said that California Celebrity Theatre Inc. is three months behind on its rent and that &quot; it ' s really up_to the bankruptcy court &quot; whether Haddad ' s company will be able to keep its hold_on the theater . &quot; My understanding is he has a certain amount_of_time where he will either affirm the lease and make payments , or reject the lease and be out , &quot; said Stern , a Los Angeles attorney . &quot; I think he has to do that within 60 days . It ' s a fairly short fuse. &quot; If Haddad loses the lease , Stern added , &quot; we would certainly look_for other tenants to run the building . The Freedman Foundation is not in the business of running a theater . It ' s not in our charitable charter , nor do we have the expertise. &quot; * California Celebrity ' s bankruptcy petition lists $ 196 # 713 in debts . They include $ 22 # 000 in federal and state taxes , $ 52 # 000 owed to the landlord , smaller amounts owed to several radio_stations and $ 54 # 100 owed to music publishers from a March , 1993 , judgment in a federal lawsuit . In that case , 10 song publishers successfully sued the Celebrity for allowing their songs to be performed at the theater during 1991 at a time when the Celebrity was not paying license fees to the performance rights clearinghouse , ASCAP . ASCAP ( American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ) charges venues that present live or recorded music a license fee , from which performance royalties owed to song publishers are paid . Haddad said in court documents that managers running daily operations at the theater had allowed the license fees to go unpaid and that he was never informed that the Celebrity ' s ASCAP license had lapsed . In his bankruptcy petition , Haddad lists theater assets of $ 691 # 000 . Equipment , supplies and furnishings account_for about $ 96 # 000 ; the Celebrity ' s liquor_license is valued at an additional $ 40 # 000 . Haddad ' s assets list also includes an &quot; unknown &quot; amount owed to California Celebrity by Avalon Attractions . More_than half the corporate worth -- $ 400 # 000 -- involves uncollected payments from a 1991 judgment in a breach-of-contract suit that Haddad won by default against a former partner in the theater , whom Haddad alleged had mismanaged the business . * In a pending lawsuit in Orange County Superior_Court , Freedman Forum , the theater-holding entity of the Freedman Foundation , contends that the Celebrity underreported its income in 1987-88 by about $ 600 # 000 and that a percentage of that amount , totaling about $ 48 # 500 , should have been paid as additional rent . According to the suit , the Celebrity reported $ 2.75 million in revenues from December , 1987 , through November , 1988 . The Freedman Forum claims that an audit it commissioned showed revenues of $ 3.34 million for that period . In court papers , Haddad has denied the alleged discrepancy .</TEXT>
