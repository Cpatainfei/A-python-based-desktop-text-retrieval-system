   <TEXT> Sounding Out Car Buyers : Tom Keenan , owner and operations director of Creative Media Recording in Cypress , has had a spate of auto industry jobs this summer . Creative , which does sound_recording and audio cassette production for a variety of business clients , usually works with sales training material.The company recently completed the soundtrack for a Nissan dealer sales incentive_program -- a job that involved casting Hawaiian actors and then recording them by telephone from a studio in Oahu . ( The budget didn ' t stretch to flying Keenan and his crew to Hawaii. ) Keenan said he has also produced a series of audio cassettes for Mazda dealers . The tapes compare the new Protege to the competition ' s models with an emphasis on where cars such_as the Chrysler Neon , Toyota Corolla , Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra don ' t stack_up . Creative not only tapes the dialogue for the presentation , it also records music and sound_effects , then puts the whole package together . About 10 % of the company ' s business comes from the auto industry , Keenan said .</TEXT>
