   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; DREAM TEAMS : ITALY VS . BRAZIL ; ROMARIO FINALLY HAS TO USE HIS HEAD TO DEFEAT SWEDEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The prevent defense just doesn ' t work . Brazil proved that again Wednesday , qualifying for the World Cup_final with a 1-0 victory over Sweden . While Sweden laid back and played for a tie and penalty kicks , Brazil pressed throughout their semifinal at the Rose Bowl . Time after time , wave after wave , the creative South_Americans attacked and were turned_back . But that strategy doesn ' t work forever , and Romario headed_home a goal in the 81st minute , lifting Brazil into its first final since 1970 . That year , the Brazilians defeated Italy for their third_world soccer championship . On Sunday , they meet the Italians again , and the winner will be the first four-time World Cup champ . Sweden ' s chances were severely diminished in the 63rd minute when captain Jonas Thern was ejected for a vicious tackle on Dunga . That made the Swedes turn even more conservative , rarely venturing into Brazil ' s end of the field . Sweden was outshot 26-3 . Meanwhile , goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli , a hero in Sweden ' s most successful World Cup since it lost to Brazil in the 1958 final , kept the Brazilians frustrated with several sensational saves . He was helpless , however , on Romario ' s goal , which came_off a brilliant crossing pass from the right corner by Jorginho . Romario had beaten defender Roland Nilsson and had plenty of time to redirect the pass . The goal set_off a torrent of cheering , drum-beating and dancing in the aisles by the overwhelmingly pro-Brazil crowd . As the clocked ticked away , the stadium reverberated with the sounds of the samba . And the expectations that 24 years of soccer frustration will end Sunday . &quot; The only real opportunity that we had , I was able to convert , &quot; Romario said . &quot; Thank God I was able to get_it in and get_on to the final. &quot; Brazil worked inexorably toward the first goal for 80 minutes , but it never came , mainly due_to Brazilian misplays . Romario and Bebeto had ample opportunities to create goals , but they either sent shots wide or hesitated and lost the chance to shoot . In the 20th minute , Romario broke free in the penalty area and evaded Ravelli , but his shot was cleared_off the goal_line by Patrik Andersson . The rebound went_to Mazinho , but his shot went wide . For most of the day , the game eerily resembled Brazil ' s last World Cup defeat , in Italy four years ago . Argentina ' s ultraconservative approach made_for a one-sided match , but the Brazilians couldn ' t score and the_Argentines eventually broke_through on one of its few attacks for a 1-0 win . This time , as their fans grew impatient -- often whistling and hooting at the Brazilians ' inability to finish -- the South_Americans could show nothing more_than a 15-1 shooting edge for the first_half . That edge grew along with Brazil ' s anxiety as the match remained scoreless . But the Swedes , who tied Brazil 1-1 in the opening round -- this was the first World Cup rematch since 1982 -- never abandoned their defensive shell . And Brazil never stopped attacking . Brazil now is 5-0-2 against Sweden in the World Cup . But the important number has become four : Either Brazil or Italy will be holding_up that many fingers Sunday , which no nation has done .</TEXT>
