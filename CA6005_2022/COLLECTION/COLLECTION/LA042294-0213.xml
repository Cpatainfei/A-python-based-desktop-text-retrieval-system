   <HEADLINE> ANIMATION REVIEW ; FESTIVAL DRAWS ON BRITISH HUMOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Recent shorts by British animators dominate the new &quot; Spike &amp; Mike ' s Festival of Animation &quot; ( opening today at the Edwards Mesa Cinema in Costa Mesa ) , including Nick Park ' s &quot; The Wrong Trousers , &quot; which won the Academy Award for animated short earlier this year , and two other Oscar nominees : &quot; Blindscape &quot; by Stephen Palmer and Mark Baker ' s &quot; The Village. &quot; &quot; Wrong Trousers &quot; continues the misadventures of Wallace , the genially befuddled inventor , and his shrewd dog , Gromit , from Park ' s Oscar-nominated &quot; A Grand Day Out. &quot; A clever spoof of ' 40s detective movies , &quot; Trousers &quot; pits the resourceful Gromit against the sinister penguin jewel thief &quot; Feathers &quot; McGraw . Park set a new standard for subtle animation of stop-motion clay figures in his previous Oscar-winner , &quot; Creature Comforts. &quot; The often hilarious expressions he gives Gromit represent a refinement of his technique . The other Oscar nominees look less impressive . In &quot; Blindscape , &quot; Palmer uses nicely rendered , colored pencil drawings to suggest the images created by sounds in the mind of a blind_man , but the film suffers from a weak story and uncertain tone . &quot; The Village , &quot; Baker ' s tale of covert passion in a tiny hamlet , repeats the simple , absurd drawing style of his Oscar nominee , &quot; The Hill Farm , &quot; but not its warmth and charm . In &quot; Hill Farm , &quot; Baker made the plight of his silly little animals and people seem compelling ; the loves and hates of his villagers lack that sense of urgency . * Joanna Quinn offers a barbed satire of England ' s colonial past in &quot; Britannia &quot; ( England ) . Markedly superior to her previous sexist rants , &quot; Britannia &quot; features some of the most interesting drawn animation in the show . Another institution gets its knocks in &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; ( United States ) , a rock video to the &quot; Weird Al &quot; Yankovic song that combines clay and drawn animation . Despite some funny moments , &quot; Park &quot; is closer in tone and technical sophistication to &quot; Pee-wee ' s Playhouse &quot; than &quot; Wrong Trousers. &quot; &quot; Festival &quot; also includes &quot; Five Female Persuasions &quot; ( United States ) , a student film that amounts to a drawn-out attempt to update Thurber ' s cartoon series &quot; The Masculine Approach , &quot; plus the previously reviewed &quot; N ' Cest Pas &quot; ( United States ) and &quot; Legacy &quot; ( United States ) . * &quot; Spike &amp; Mike ' s Festival of Animation &quot; continues through June 2 in tandem with &quot; Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation &quot; at the Edwards Mesa Cinema , 1884 Newport Blvd. , Costa Mesa .
