   <HEADLINE> YOUR MONEY ; LIVE WELL , DIE PREPARED ; PERSONAL FINANCE : IT ' S INEVITABLE , SO HERE ' S OUR GUIDE TO ESTATE PLANNING , FUNERALS AND OTHER LIFE-AND-DEATH CONCERNS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nobody likes to talk_about death . But the Grim Reaper eventually comes for us all . And when he does , most people are unprepared -- financially speaking , if no other way . Only about three in 10 Americans have a will . Less than one in four have executed so-called &quot; advance directives &quot; that limit aggressive health treatments when the prognosis is terminal . And a far smaller number have moved to alleviate tax , probate or funeral costs . &quot; We , as human_beings , don ' t want to deal with our own mortality . So this is one of those things that people put_off , &quot; says Melissa Burkholder , an attorney with the American Assn . of Retired Persons in Washington . &quot; The question is whether you are going_to deal with it , or is somebody going_to do_it for you ? And if somebody else does_it , are they going_to make the same decisions as you would have ? &quot; These are , of course , personal issues that cut_to the heart of how you feel about your family and about maintaining control . But they are also financial issues of sweeping importance . What few people realize is that death is shockingly expensive . Funeral costs alone easily can amount to $ 6 # 000 . The cost of probate can wipe_out a modest estate . Estate_taxes can force the liquidation of a family-owned business or the sale of the family home . And dying &quot; intestate &quot; -- without a will -- can cause your assets to fall_into the wrong hands . These are not issues solely for the elderly . Having a will and simple estate plan is pivotal for young parents , too ; their heirs , after all , are more dependent_on them than are the adult children of elderly couples . The good news is that many of these issues can be handled easily and inexpensively -- if you plan in_advance . Here ' s a six-step guide . Step 1 : Writing a Will Preparing a will is the first_step in creating a viable plan that will allow your heirs to survive comfortably in your absence . In California , a plethora of do-it-yourself wills are completely acceptable . The simplest is a handwritten statement that spells_out who you are , what you ' ve got and who should get_it . These so-called &quot; holographic &quot; wills are simply signed and dated . No witnesses are necessary . You also can buy fill-in-the-blanks &quot; statutory &quot; wills at virtually any stationery store for $ 1 to $ 5 . You complete the form , get a_few witnesses to sign , and either stick it in your safe deposit_box or give it to a trusted friend or relative for safekeeping . Or you can buy a will kit . The kits -- either in book form or computer software -- cost $ 10 to $ 70 . Their advantage over statutory wills ? They come_with instructions . Some attorneys criticize do-it-yourself wills , noting that an individual can make important errors and end_up with a will that is not valid . Indeed , if you ' re elderly , wealthy or have a complicated family arrangement -- such_as children from different marriages -- or complicated desires , you might be wise_to hire an attorney . However , if your aims are simple and your assets are modest , advocates of do-it-yourself wills say the mistakes are easy to avoid . These are the errors to watch for : * People forget to have the will witnessed , or they have their heirs serve as witnesses . Witnesses are supposed to be able to prove that you were sane and uncoerced when you wrote your will . If a witness is also an heir , his or her testimony can be questioned . * Poor writing . Consider : &quot; I leave all my assets to Suzie , unless she marries that jerk , John , and decides to become an artist instead of an accountant. &quot; Does the author mean to disinherit Suzie if she becomes an artist , or only if she both marries John and becomes an artist ? If your wishes aren ' t clear , all or part of your will can be invalidated . * Not mentioning a child . You may want to disinherit the lazy , good-for-nothing freeloaders currently occupying the spare bedrooms . But if you simply leave them out of your will , a judge may be persuaded that you suffered a memory lapse and forgot to give the freeloaders a rightful share . If you want to disinherit someone , say so . Or leave the person a dime . * Bequeathing already spoken-for assets . Your will does not control the distribution of all your assets . The proceeds of your life_insurance policy go_to the named beneficiary , regardless of what it says in your will . Assets held_in joint ownership -- houses , cars and bank_accounts held by husband and wife , for example -- revert to the joint owner on your death . You cannot change the beneficiary of these assets in your will . Don ' t try . * Bequeathing for both of you . &quot; We leave all our worldly assets to our children . . . . &quot; You can ' t create a joint will . &quot; You die alone , &quot; says Stephen Elias , co-author of WillMaker , a popular piece of will-writing software . Step 2 : Understand Probate When you die , your assets generally go_into a legal limbo called probate . The process boils_down to this : Your executor hires an attorney who files your will with the local probate_court . The court sends notice to your creditors stating that you have died and that your estate is being settled . Through legal hearings , the court pays your debts and &quot; proves &quot; the validity of your will . The benefit of probate is that once it ' s through , creditors can ' t go_after your heirs for payment of a bill . It also settles disputes between heirs . The disadvantages of probate are also clear . It is time-consuming and expensive . The best case -- a simple , uncontested will -- takes about nine months to a year to clear probate . In cases where there are disputed creditor ' s claims or infighting among heirs , probate can takeyears . Hiring a probate attorney , meanwhile , can be costly . They are paid either by the hour or according to a formula set by state law . In California , the statutory fees are levied as a percentage of your gross_estate ( the value of your assets before deducting liabilities , such_as mortgage loans and creditor ' s claims ) . You pay a maximum of 4 % of the first $ 15 # 000 in probated assets ; 3 % of the next $ 85 # 000 ; 2 % of the next $ 900 # 000 , and 1 % of amounts over $ 1 million . If there are disputed claims or the estate is unusually difficult to probate , a judge can award &quot; extraordinary &quot; probate fees , too . And if you don ' t make another arrangement in_advance , these maximum fees can be applied to even the simplest case , says Doron M . Tisser , a Calabasas-based estate planning attorney . The executor is entitled to the same fees , but executors who are also heirs often don ' t accept fees . Practically speaking , it ' s better to inherit the money tax free than to collect taxable executor ' s fees . All these fees easily can consume your assets when you die . If your estate consists_of a $ 100 # 000 home , the attorney and executor could claim a total of $ 5 # 700 in fees . Let ' s say an $ 80 # 000 mortgage has to be paid_off . In the end , the heirs are left with just $ 14 # 300 . And if the home is sold , the real_estate_agent ' s fees would come_out of the inheritance . Probate also opens your estate to public view . The curious can look_up your case and determine just how much money you had and who got_it . Step 3 : Skirting Probate The time , expense and public nature of probate have spawned an industry whose sole purpose is to help people avoid probate . And by far , the most popular product in the anti-probate arsenal is the living trust . Living trusts are three-part legal_documents which , properly executed , set_up a formula that handles the financial aspects of death and possible incapacity without the time , expense and disclosure involved in taking these matters through court . The first part of the document deals with the distribution of your assets while you are sound of both mind and body . This may be as simple as naming yourself trustee and giving yourself the right to distribute your assets as you see fit . Part two names a successor trustee who can handle your financial affairs if you fall_into a coma or are otherwise rendered incapable of handling them yourself . Part three serves as a will and provides_for the distribution of your assets and the appointment of guardians for minor children after you ' re gone . These documents are revocable , which means you can change or cancel them while you are alive and competent . They become irrevocable at your death . The disadvantages of living_trusts ? First , they ' re expensive . An attorney will charge $ 500 to $ 2 # 500 to set_up a fairly simple one -- but that ' s still often less costly than probate . Moreover , property in a living trust may be a bit more difficult to sell or refinance , simply because it ' s held_in the name of the trust . While lenders say that ' s less true today than a_few years ago , you still may have problems finding one willing to make a home loan on real_estate owned by a trust . Also , to be effective , the trust must own all your probatable assets . If it doesn ' t , your heirs could end_up dealing with both trust administrators and probate authorities , which is more time-consuming and costly than probate alone . Since some people don ' t remember to deed all their assets to the trust , many attorneys advise executing a so-called &quot; pour-over &quot; will , which transfers any forgotten assets into the trust at your death . You don ' t , however , necessarily need a living trust to avoid probate . All those assets that can ' t be left in a will -- insurance_policies , jointly-owned property and the_like -- automatically skirt probate . You also can name beneficiaries for pension_plans , brokerage_accounts and bank_accounts , leaving little -- or nothing -- to the probate process . Step 4 : Estate_Tax Planning Few people bother with estate_tax planning because it ' s widely understood that estate_taxes are assessed only on the &quot; wealthy &quot; -- people with assets of $ 600 # 000 or more . But , in California , where a modest bungalow in a good ZIP_Code can sell for more_than $ 500 # 000 , many middle-class families will find at least part of their estates falling_into the clutches of Uncle_Sam . For the really rich , estate_tax gambits aimed at trimming inheritance_taxes -- which range from 36 % to 70 % -- are plentiful and complex . But for middle-income families with just a shade more_than $ 600 # 000 in assets , the strategies are fairly simple : * Annual gifts . Before you die , you can give an unlimited number of people up_to $ 10 # 000 a year without triggering estate or gift_taxes , notes Gregg Ritchie , partner in the personal financial planning group at KPMG Peat Marwick in Los Angeles . In addition , he says , you can pay_for a child or grandchild ' s health_care or education expenses . * Bypass trusts . If you don ' t like the idea of annual gifts because you ' re worried about having enough money to last you and your spouse ' s lifetimes , consider a bypass trust . These devices help married_couples leave up_to $ 1.2 million to their heirs without triggering estate_taxes . Sometimes called A-B trusts , these documents start_out as a revocable trust , then split into two parts -- Part A and Part B -- on the first spouse ' s death . The deceased spouse ' s part -- Part B -- spins_off up_to $ 600 # 000 of the couple ' s combined assets and becomes irrevocable . Eventually , the assets in the B trust go_to heirs other_than the surviving spouse . But while the survivor is alive , he or she collects the interest and investment income on the assets . When the second spouse dies , both the assets in the B trust and those in the A trust go_to the designated heirs . * Life_insurance . Agents call this the &quot; 1 % solution , &quot; because it involves paying 1 % of the value of your estate for a period of years to purchase an insurance_policy . The policy is put into an irrevocable life_insurance trust , and the proceeds pay estate_taxes after you die . For how long do you have to ante_up 1 % of your assets to buy such a policy ? The answer varies based on your age , assets and insurer . Generally , the younger you are , the less you pay , for the simple reason that the insurer is able to use your money for a longer period_of_time . Of course , paying your money today to save your heirs ' from future tax obligations makes_sense only in some fairly unusual circumstances . This option may prove desirable , for instance , if you have a small business that could be rendered insolvent or forced into liquidation if your heirs had to pay estate_taxes on its value within nine months of your death . It also could help if you are bequeathing heirlooms or assets that you would n ' t want your heirs to have to to sell in_order to pay estate_taxes . Step 5 : Executing an Advance Directive They may_not have had a lot in common in life . But in death , Richard M . Nixon and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis -- who both refused life-prolonging medical treatment -- are spurring something of a renaissance in &quot; advance directives. &quot; These are legal_documents that spell_out for your doctor the point at which treatment should stop , either by stating the specific conditions under which you refuse treatment or by designating who can make that decision for you . While the most important purpose of an advance directive is to maintain control over your life , there is also a financial point to signing such a document . Simply put , aggressive , life-prolonging treatments are among the most expensive in medicine . Partly as a result , roughly one-quarter of your lifetime medical costs are rung_up in the final 12 months of life -- and most of that in the last month . Arguably , cost is incidental when the procedure saves your life and health . But what about when treatment keeps you alive yet miserable ? If that concept frightens you , you may want to draw_up an advance directive . The best-known is the living will , which stipulates that treatment should not be used simply to prolong life when the diagnosis is terminal . Another form is a health-care power_of_attorney , which gives a spouse , child , relative or friend the legal_right to make life-and-death medical decisions for you . Both documents are commonly provided to patients at nursing_homes , hospitals , hospices and senior centers for nominal charges or for free . They are also sold by a variety of national groups and stationery stores . However , you don ' t need a form to execute a viable advance directive , according to Charles P . Sabatino , assistant director of the American Bar Assn. ' s commission on legal problems of the elderly . A letter to your doctor stating the conditions under which you ' d like to live -- and die -- should suffice , he says . However , you should specifically mention under what circumstances you would want the doctor to withdraw oxygen , food and hydration devices , as these require specific consent in many states . Step 6 : Funeral Planning You won ' t enjoy it as much , but a funeral can cost as much as a nice wedding -- or a luxury car . And although many people are reluctant to price-check while grieving , shopping around for funeral arrangements can save consumers hundreds -- even thousands -- of dollars . It ' s easy , too , says Lee Norrgard , senior investigative analyst with the American Assn . of Retired Persons ' consumer affairs division . Federal law requires funeral_directors to provide detailed price information on request . The trick is asking the right questions . And that requires some thought . Do you want a traditional burial or cremation ? A lavish or budget farewell ? Do religious or personal considerations dictate a choice of funeral_home or cemetery ? With those thoughts in mind , create a shopping list like the one printed here . Realize that the total cost of a funeral includes more_than a dozen elements -- many of which are optional . Also realize that burial fees are separate and include several components , some of which also involve choices . On the funeral side , the biggest cost item is usually the casket . Prices vary from about $ 250 for an inexpensive wood coffin to as much as $ 25 # 000 for a luxury , bronze coffin with adjustable mattress . There are charges for use of the mortuary , services of the funeral_director , flowers , music , transportation , preparation of the body , embalming , and obtaining permits and death certificates . At the burial , the biggest cost is the grave , crypt or &quot; niche &quot; for cremated remains . With in-ground burials , there is often also a charge for an &quot; outer burial container &quot; -- typically a cement casement that goes_around the casket ; fees for opening and closing the grave ; a charge for the marker and , possibly , recording fees . For cremations , there ' s often a fee for the urn and for a container in which the body is cremated . Determine your preferences and call several mortuaries . The cost of an identical funeral can vary by as much as $ 2 # 000 at different funeral_homes in the same city , according to an AARP survey . &quot; As with any consumer purchase , there is a choice , &quot; agrees Susan Daniels , spokeswoman for the National Funeral_Directors Assn . in Milwaukee . &quot; You can choose something expensive or something less expensive. &quot; Resources There are numerous books , software programs with advice on financial and legal issues concerning death .
