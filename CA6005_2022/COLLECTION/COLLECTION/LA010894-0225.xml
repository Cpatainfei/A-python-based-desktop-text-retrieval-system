   <HEADLINE> GILL_NET FOES SEE RULING AS VICTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three years after voters approved an initiative outlawing gill_nets in California waters , commercial fishermen have been ordered to pull their nets from the sea , the measure ' s boosters announced Friday . Assemblywoman Doris Allen ( R-Cypress ) , author of the 1990 ballot measure , said a San Diego County Superior_Court judge rejected pleas this week by fishermen for a temporary reprieve from the ban , which took_effect Jan . 1 . Allen and other backers of Proposition 132 , which sought to protect sea_lions and other marine mammals that become snagged in the nets , predicted they would win when a legal challenge by gill_net fishermen goes_to trial April 1 in San Diego . &quot; The nets are out of the water , and for that we are very , very happy , &quot; Allen declared during a Capitol press_conference . &quot; This is a great day for marine mammals. &quot; But fishing industry officials said the fight is far from over , confidently predicting that the ruling Thursday by Judge Arthur W . Jones does not presage the outcome of the trial . &quot; I don ' t see what he said yesterday as having much bearing on what he ' ll decide in two months , &quot; said Peter H . Flournoy , attorney for the gill_net fishermen . &quot; we ' ll ultimately prevail. &quot; The fishermen contend the proposition ' s boosters have consistently overstated the effect of gill_nets on dolphins , sea_lions and whales in an effort to camouflage their true aim : to clear the ocean of the commercial fleet so sports anglers have a free run of the seas . &quot; Essentially what the sports fishermen want is their own playground in Southern California without commercial competition , &quot; said Diane Plescher , manager of the California Seafood Council . In the meantime , she said , consumers will be hurt by the ban , which will eliminate 4 million pounds of fish annually -- 30 % of the local catch that goes_to market . The ban will virtually eliminate locally caught California halibut , white sea_bass , near-shore shark , barracuda , yellowtail and white_croaker . To meet the demands , fish will be shipped from Mexico , where gill_nets are still used , Plescher said . &quot; The irony of this whole_thing is it ' s putting our small independent fisherman out of business , yet the public will continue to demand white tablecloth species like halibut and white bass. &quot; Shortly after voters approved the proposition , state officials counted about 500 gill_net fishermen in California . Today , the number stands at about 100 -- and now those fishermen are being forced_out of California waters while they await outcome of the trial . While commercial fishermen contend marine mammal populations in California waters are healthy and expanding in size , the proposition ' s boosters argue that many species are only now beginning to re-establish themselves after severe declines . During 1986-87 , state Fish and Game officials counted more_than 6 # 000 sea_lions and harbor_seals caught in nets . They also argue that the gill_nets were stripping shallow coastal waters of many types of fish that eventually would have disappeared had not the proposition intervened . Of the fish snagged in the nets , 70 % have no commercial or economic_value because of their size or type , they contend . &quot; I have seen our ocean decline from one of the world ' s premier fishing grounds to what it is now -- a desert , &quot; said Michael Von Quilich of the San Diego Rod &amp; Reel club .</TEXT>
