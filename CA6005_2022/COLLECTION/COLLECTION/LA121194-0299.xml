   <HEADLINE> SUMMIT NATIONS AGREE TO CREATE FREE-TRADE ZONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Embarking_on what President Clinton called a &quot; historic step , &quot; the United States and 33 other nations of the Western_Hemisphere agreed Saturday to complete complex negotiations within a decade to eliminate all tariffs and other barriers to free_trade from the Arctic to Argentina . &quot; We believe the agreement we have made today to launch the Free_Trade Area of the Americas will produce more jobs , higher incomes and greater opportunities for all_of our people , &quot; Clinton said , setting the goal of establishing a free-trade zone of unprecedented economic and geographic reach . The agreement is the centerpiece of the weekend Summit of the Americas . It is seen as an ambitious and concrete measure that will spur liberalization of trade and boost commerce , not only in the hemisphere but around the world . It would not actually be implemented until some time beyond the target date of 2005 , when the negotiations should be finished . The summit , which ends today , is the first such gathering in 27 years . It has brought_to Miami the presidents or prime_ministers of every nation from Canada to Argentina . Only Cuba ' s Fidel Castro is missing , but in the aftermath of the Cold_War and the collapse of his Soviet allies , his absence no longer casts a shadow over such proceedings . Even a massive demonstration by his many opponents in the Cuban expatriate community here was barely recognized during a day in which the overriding theme was Latin_America ' s turn toward market_economies and away from the often heavy-handed state interference of the post-World War II era . Although the U.S. embargo against Cuba was not officially a subject of discussion , presidents of three of the largest countries of Latin_America -- Brazil , Mexico and Colombia -- suggested that dialogue rather than isolation is the best way to push for democracy in Cuba . But Argentine President Carlos Menem said Cuba ' s government &quot; must begin an opening toward representative and pluralistic democracy &quot; if it wishes to rejoin the hemispherical community , according to the text of his speech to the summit . Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo emphasized his country ' s traditional insistence on a policy of nonintervention , an indirect slap at the United States ' Cuba policy . In perhaps the only other sour note that cast a pall over the summit , several Latin presidents expressed their dismay to Clinton over Proposition 187 , the measure passed_by California voters that denies education and other public benefits to undocumented immigrants . Colombian President Ernesto Samper said he told Clinton that the measure &quot; sets an abysmal precedent &quot; in relations between Latin_America and the United States that &quot; violates a long good-neighbor tradition. &quot; Clinton assured the summit participants that his Administration does not support the measure , and he added that immigration policy as_a_whole should be reviewed , according to Panamanian officials who attended the conference . In other steps , the participants committed themselves to banning the sale of leaded gasoline , a common cause of health-damaging lead in the bloodstream ; to tackling the difficult issue of pesticide use , and to studying the &quot; empowerment &quot; of women and indigenous people , said Carol Browner , administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency . The leaders also said their aides will address as a group such common scourges as drug trafficking , corruption and money_laundering . But for Clinton , the summit principally provided one more opportunity to nail_down his goal of using trade as an engine to power U.S. economic_growth , based on the theory that it creates markets for U.S. manufacturers , farmers and , increasingly , financial_institutions . The trade agreement that will be negotiated as a result of Saturday ' s action , Clinton said , &quot; will cover a comprehensive list of areas , from tariffs on goods , to services , to agricultural and intellectual property. &quot; &quot; It is the key building_block in our creation of a partnership for prosperity , &quot; he said during a break_in the talks . In a shift from Cold_War policy , the U.S._government is trying to meld foreign and economic_policy , to build relationships with other nations and regions based on expanded commerce . Thus , Clinton split with many Democratic allies last year to gain approval of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . He also completed negotiations on the expansion of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and agreed with the leaders of 17 other Pacific Rim nations to set a goal of eliminating tariffs among them by the year 2020 . Clinton argues that this course will open foreign markets to the products of U.S. workers , creating jobs in this country . Critics say such an approach risks opening the United States to competition from lower-priced products , bringing pressure to hold_down wages and lowering the standard_of_living in the United States while also leading the United States to do business with nations that allow labor and environmental practices that do not meet U.S. standards . Senior Clinton_Administration officials involved in the negotiations leading_up to the agreement said Saturday that they had won reluctant support from Latin_American nations for including language in the Declaration of Principles that singles_out the goals of protecting the environment and protecting workers . The officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said they accomplished this by holding_out support for setting a specific date for negotiating the free-trade accord . While the summit endorsed that goal Saturday , there was dissension in preliminary talks , with some advocating speedier action and others initially wanting to slow_down . In the end , the U.S. team said it would be willing to go_along with the goal of completing negotiations by 2005 -- which it had silently supported but did not want to push for fear of producing an anti-U.S. reaction -- if the others would sign_on to a somewhat greater emphasis on the need to protect labor and the environment from exploitation in the rush toward economic development , the officials said . It is a sensitive political issue in the United States and among U.S. trading partners in Latin_America . Clinton is under increasing pressure from some organized labor and environmental groups , important members of his political base , to hold firmly to strict provisions in these areas . But Republicans , about to move_into the majority in the House and Senate , are pushing Clinton to advance the goal of reduced tariffs , the taxes charged on imports , and lowered import quotas with only minimum encumbrances . Reflecting these crosscurrents , Rep . Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) sent Clinton a nine-page letter Wednesday telling him that &quot; we must_not allow the Republicans to treat worker rights and environmental issues as back-seat issues. &quot; The issue is likely to come_up early next year when the President seeks renewed authority to negotiate trade agreements on what is known as a &quot; fast-track &quot; basis , in which Congress can only vote to approve or disapprove the accords without amending them . The Administration will seek such authority before beginning talks with Chile to bring the Andean nation into NAFTA , which now embraces the United States , Canada and Mexico . Clinton is expected to announce today that negotiations with Chile will begin next year . U.S. and Chilean officials completed preliminary talks Saturday . &quot; Chile can be looked_at as the first_step forward in an effort that will eventually integrate almost all_of the Americas , if not all , &quot; Chilean Finance_Minister Eduardo Aninat said in an interview . By moving to include Chile in the pact , the United States is signaling to other Latin_American nations that they can gain tariff-free access to the U.S. market one by one , without waiting for the hemisphere-wide agreement , if they emulate Chile ' s creation of a strong free-market economy . Prof . Mark Rosenberg , a Latin_America specialist at Miami ' s Florida International University , said the speedy acceptance of Chile as a new partner in the pact &quot; would send a message to other countries as_to what exactly they are going_to have to do if they want to be like Chile. &quot; Colombia ' s Samper , for example , said he is confident that Colombia would be &quot; No . 2 or No . 3 &quot; to join the pact .
