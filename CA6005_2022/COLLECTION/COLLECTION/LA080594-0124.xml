   <HEADLINE> SECURITY AT ABORTION CLINICS IS QUESTIONED ; PROTESTS : INDIANA DEMONSTRATIONS SPOTLIGHT THE INCONSISTENCIES IN FEDERAL_OFFICIALS ' PROTECTION PLANS , SOME SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the first test of the Clinton_Administration ' s resolve to guard abortion clinics across the country , federal marshals on Thursday monitored a peaceful protest at a clinic here while abortion-rights leaders complained that uneven responses and official uncertainty have marred the government ' s security arrangements . At least two marshals watched from a gray van as 300 anti-abortion protesters sang &quot; Ave Maria &quot; and hoisted photographs of dead fetuses near a Women ' s Health Organization clinic that has been the scene of repeated demonstrations and arrests in recent years . A longstanding federal_court injunction hampered protesters ' efforts to dissuade 14 clients from going_into the clinic . Flip Benham , director of Operation Rescue , vowed during a rain-battered prayer_service that the anti-abortion protesters -- in larger_numbers -- would continue their efforts through the weekend . &quot; Friday ' s here , but Sunday ' s coming ! &quot; he thundered . National abortion-rights leaders who descended on Ft . Wayne in response to the Operation Rescue protests here and in South Bend , Ind. , said that in the two days since Justice_Department officials announced their clinic security policy , there have been glaring disparities in the actions taken by marshals in different cities . Marshals in South Bend made regular sweeps_through an abortion clinic this week , activists said . But in Ft . Wayne , marshals have kept to their van , watching but not confronting strangers who approach the clinic ' s entrance . Abortion-rights leaders report similar disparities in other cities . While making preparations for the Ft . Wayne protest , abortion-rights leaders also said they were unable to get a clear reading from federal_officials concerning how marshals would deal with possible violence at the demonstrations . One abortion-rights advocate said the officials also were unable to say whether marshals would monitor and record protesters ' compliance with court injunctions and federal laws that restrict their activities . &quot; We certainly appreciate ( the marshals ' ) presence , but we ' re having a hard_time understanding exactly what their mission is -- and we ' re not sure they know either , &quot; said Susan Hill , national director of the Women ' s Health Organization . Nancy Kohsin-Kintigh of the Feminist Majority Foundation ' s clinic defense project , said talks with federal_officials , held_in Ft . Wayne on Wednesday , were strained . &quot; We left without basic questions answered , &quot; she said . * Justice_Department officials said Thursday that their actions are limited by the scope of federal law and by time . At a news briefing Thursday , Associate Atty . Gen . John Schmidt said the U.S. Marshals Service cannot &quot; provide protection for all ( clinics ) and cannot provide protection indefinitely. &quot; Schmidt said Atty . Gen . Janet Reno and officials of the Marshals Service would consult with local police agencies before deciding which of the more_than 3 # 000 abortion clinics in the United States will be protected . There are more_than 2 # 600 marshals stations across the nation . Justice_Department officials have not made public the locations of clinics already under guard , but officials and abortion-rights leaders say marshals have been posted at the sites of some of the nation ' s most bitter abortion clashes -- in Milwaukee ; Des Moines ; Wichita , Kan. ; Falls Church , Va. ; Pensacola , Fla. ; Melbourne , Fla. ; Gulfport , Miss. ; Jackson , Miss . and Fargo , N.D. Two marshals have been sent to Ft . Wayne , where three other marshals already are stationed . On Thursday , the two marshals monitoring the anti-abortion protest declined to specify their missions . Said one : &quot; We ' re here to observe. &quot; Federal_officials won praise from Dr. U . George Klopfer , an abortion doctor who was the target of the protest in Ft . Wayne . Klopfer , a blunt-spoken physician who changes motels frequently and scorns guards , agreed to federal protection this week after an anti-abortion activist was arrested in the fatal shooting of a doctor and his escort outside a Pensacola , Fla. , clinic last Friday . &quot; It ' s unrealistic for organizations to expect the Feds to do everything we ' d like them to do , &quot; he said . Klopfer said he has been told that his movements are being monitored by FBI_agents , but when he arrived in Ft . Wayne on Thursday , he was followed only by a car packed with abortion-rights escorts from his South Bend clinic . The Feminist Majority also announced Thursday that volunteer escorts will wear bulletproof_vests when they accompany women visiting Pensacola ' s two clinics . Dr. John Britton , 69 , and James H . Barrett , 74 , were killed as the doctor arrived for work_at the Ladies Center in Pensacola last Friday . Barrett ' s wife , June , 68 , was wounded in the attack . Police have charged Paul Hill , a former Presbyterian minister and outspoken abortion foe , with murder . He is being held without bond . The Senate on Thursday voted , 98 to , to condemn the Pensacola slayings and called_on federal law_enforcement agencies to ensure protection of abortion clinics . &quot; Like it or not , abortion is a legal medical procedure in this country , &quot; said Sen . Frank R . Lautenberg ( D-N.J. ) . &quot; There is no reason for doctors who provide legal abortion services to be threatened as they are. &quot; Lautenberg was the primary sponsor of the measure . &quot; Those of us that are pro-life and feel very strongly about protecting the lives of the unborn also feel very strongly about protecting the lives of those that are born , &quot; said Sen . Robert C . Smith ( R-N.H. ) . Times staff writer Ronald J . Ostrow contributed to this story from Washington .</TEXT>
