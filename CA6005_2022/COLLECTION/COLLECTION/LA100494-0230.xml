   <HEADLINE> AFTER LATEST SLAYING , WEB OF INTRIGUE EMERGES IN MEXICO ; CRIME : KILLING TIED TO FAMILY CONNECTIONS , DRUG LORDS AND GRUDGE . KINSHIP STILL A MAINSTAY OF NATION ' S POLITICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The assassination of Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the No . 2 official in the ruling party , and the investigation of that crime on Monday graphically illustrated the complex web of kinship , friendship and patronage that typifies Mexican politics -- and appears to have mired prominent politicians in this country in the drug trade . Newspapers here , for example , have reported that Congressman Manuel Munoz Rocha -- the highest-ranking politician implicated so far in the killing of Ruiz Massieu -- pleaded with federal police , as he tried to negotiate his surrender , to consider political and family ties that had drawn him into last week ' s bold daylight crime . Even as this was occurring , members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , sought to distance themselves from Munoz Rocha , the once-influential chairman of the Hydraulics Commission , which controls Mexico ' s dams -- meaning it has sway over critical areas such_as hydroelectric power and water for irrigation . &quot; We regret that this man ( Munoz Rocha ) was ever admitted to the ranks of our party , because he does not deserve to be part of the PRI , &quot; party Chairman Ignacio Pichardo told reporters . As expected , the attorney_general asked Congress to revoke Munoz Rocha ' s legislative immunity so he can be prosecuted in the alleged plot to kill Ruiz Massieu . Sources said it could take from two weeks to a month to strip him of that legal protection . Police are still hunting Munoz Rocha and others allegedly involved in the killing . Because of the slain man ' s family ties , that crime has now come_to be seen as a personal attack on President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and , according to one suspect , an attempt to undermine Mexico ' s war on drugs . Ruiz Massieu was a former Salinas brother-in-law , and his brother , Mario , is the assistant attorney_general who has led a fierce crackdown on narcotics dealers . But that is just one of many tangled , almost soap-opera-style relationships that have come_to the surface thus far in the assassination investigation . According to news_reports here , Munoz Rocha has links to Abraham Rubio Canales , a jailed politician with a grudge against Francisco Ruiz Massieu . The ties between these two are said to involve the dating relationship between Munoz Rocha ' s daughter and Rubio Canales ' son . Meantime , Rubio Canales reportedly was angry with Ruiz Massieu , believing he may have helped send him to jail . And Rubio Canales has ties to suspected drug lords via another son ' s marriage . That son married the daughter of Raul Valladares ; Valladares recently was arrested , and authorities have said they believe he is the No . 2 figure in the notorious Gulf cartel , which supplies as much as two-thirds of the cocaine that enters the United States from Mexico . When Munoz Rocha turned_to a trusted longtime aide for help in carrying_out the killing , the aide enlisted his brother , according to the brother ' s statement to police . The brother also told police that he , in turn , relied_on a network of paisanos , old acquaintances from near his hometown , to buy guns and recruit triggermen . Family ties &quot; are extremely important , because Mexicans rely in the political world -- as they do_in other worlds -- on trust , &quot; said Roderic Camp , a Tulane University political_scientist who has written a book on political recruitment in Mexico . &quot; One way to develop trust is to be related to someone . Society has not developed to the extent of trusting people on the basis of impersonal relationships. &quot; As a result , Camp estimates that a third of the prominent politicians he has interviewed for several books on Mexico ' s political elite are related to other politicians who , in turn , have helped their careers . Salinas , for example , is the son of a former Cabinet secretary . Camp noted that his estimate of the ties between politicians is probably conservative , because it does not take_into_account links by marriage , which are harder to trace . Family ties are crucial in state and local politics , he said -- even more so than at the national level , where the competition is stiffer . The reliance on family is also a point that distinguishes the &quot; dinosaurs &quot; -- the Old_Guard of Mexican politics -- from the modern &quot; technocrats. &quot; &quot; This shows that these people have old attitudes about everything , &quot; said Angeles Mastreta , author of &quot; Mexican Bolero , &quot; a novel based on the web of family and politics in 1940s Mexico . &quot; These are 1940s attitudes in the 1990s. &quot; While technocrats ' relatives have been known to receive political appointments , other paths to power have opened in recent years , experts here said . Universities , for example , have become the most important new source of politicians , Camp said . The old_school_tie , he noted , now is often reinforced with a traditional rite , compadrazgo -- becoming a godparent to a friend ' s child . The fundamental basis of academically linked relationships , though , remains the student-teacher or classmate bond . Among city dwellers , private clubs also have become a way to forge links that can lead to jobs in government -- especially since memberships have become perks for top bureaucrats . The new paths to power have gained in importance here as reformers have passed laws making_it illegal for public_servants to hire relatives . The regulations , however , have had a limited effect on preventing politicians from promoting godchildren ' s careers . Those who prefer the old system appear to have found new , dangerous allies . What is most terrifying , said Mastreta , is &quot; one politician threatening another with his relatives who are drug traffickers. &quot; It is particularly striking that one victim of this new bonding may have been Ruiz Massieu , said Raymundo Riva Palacio , columnist for the independent newspaper Reforma . Ruiz Massieu was among those most critical of traffickers ' efforts to penetrate politics , saying openly that one state governor and his alleged drug-dealer brothers &quot; ought to be in jail. &quot; The Scorecard ( Southland Edition , A14 ) This is the cast of people in the alleged plot to kill reform-minded Mexican politicians : Francisco Ruiz Massieu : The assassination victim , who was the late general secretary of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and former governor of the state of Guerrero , and was slated to become majority_leader in the next Congress .
