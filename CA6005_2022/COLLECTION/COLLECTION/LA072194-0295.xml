   <HEADLINE> HUBER SUSPECT THREATS RELATED ; TESTIMONY : INVESTIGATOR SAYS FAMALARO HAS HISTORY OF ASSAULTING WOMEN . ORANGE COUNTY POLICE SAY THEY FOUND VEHICLE POSSIBLY USED IN DENISE HUBER ' S ABDUCTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Appearing in court for the first time since Denise Huber ' s body was found last week in a freezer at his country_club home , murder_suspect John J . Famalaro listened impassively Wednesday as an investigator testified that the house_painter had a history of threatening and assaulting women . Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Lt . Scott Mascher told a packed courtroom that several of Famalaro ' s former girlfriends had described being threatened or feeling threatened by him , Mascher said . One woman , Mascher testified , told investigators she once was &quot; forced down and handcuffed from behind &quot; by Famalaro , 37 . When investigators last week found the body of the Newport Beach woman -- missing for three years -- she , too , had been handcuffed . Immediately following the hearing , Justice_of_the_Peace Robert W . Kuebler Jr . denied Famalaro ' s request for bail . A grand_jury was expected to indict Famalaro by today . If not , a preliminary hearing is scheduled for Friday . In a day punctuated by multiple developments in the case : * Famalaro fired his attorney because of his religious_beliefs . * Investigators said they have quizzed Famalaro ' s brother , Warren , a convicted child_molester who lives_in Lake Forest , several times , and described him as &quot; being anywhere from a witness to a suspect &quot; in the Huber case . * Arizona authorities revealed deputies had visited Famalaro ' s house in March when the handyman reported a burglary , but the freezer containing Huber ' s body went undetected . * Detectives in Orange County said they have identified a vehicle they think was used in Huber ' s abduction but declined to elaborate . * Investigators still had not located at least one woman whose name was found in Famalaro ' s home . Adding_to the grisly details of last week ' s discovery , Mascher told the judge Wednesday that Huber ' s body had been crammed into the freezer chest , her eyes and mouth covered by cotton wads and then sealed with duct tape . Mascher also testified that two witnesses had come_forward with additional information : a man who said he once helped Famalaro measure the 23-foot-long freezer to see if it would fit_in the Prescott Country_Club home where the suspect lived ; and a woman who said she once found an 18-inch bone while digging at Famalaro ' s house but thought nothing of it . Since the arrest , investigators have unearthed portions of Famalaro ' s house and yard in a search for more bodies but turned_up nothing . In Orange County , authorities said Wednesday that they have homed_in on Famalaro ' s whereabouts during the week of Huber ' s disappearance three years ago and believe they can show he was in the area at the time . Relying_on Famalaro ' s business records , receipts and interviews with people who saw him , investigators have confirmed that Famalaro was in the Orange County area on June 3 , 1991 , the night that 23-year-old Huber vanished after her car blew a tire on the Corona del Mar Freeway . Investigators also have collected receipts , job work orders and sworn declarations from people who encountered Famalaro around the time of Huber ' s abduction . &quot; We ' re getting a very good timeline put_together , &quot; said Costa Mesa Police Sgt . Jerry Holloway , who is coordinating the Orange County portion of the murder probe . Additional court records filed Wednesday indicated authorities also seized from Famalaro ' s house a wood-handled claw_hammer and metal nail puller apparently stained with blood . A weeklong search of Famalaro ' s house has already turned_up a crowbar that appears to be bloodied and some of Huber ' s belongings , including clothing , a purse and jewelry . Investigators said they believe Huber was bludgeoned to death shortly after her kidnaping and then carted around in a freezer for more_than three years . Costa Mesa Police Lt . Ron Smith said a crowbar would be consistent with Huber ' s wounds , which police have described as inflicted with a blunt but not rounded object . Following_up_on a list of women ' s names garnered from items found during a search of Famalaro ' s home -- including identification , credit_cards and clothing , some with crimson stains -- investigators have successfully located all but two . Lt . Mascher testified that the two women were considered missing , but a relative of one of the women disputed that claim late Wednesday night , saying she is fine . Jack Wattier III , the stepbrother of Melody Mendick , told The Times that investigators found Mendick ' s food_stamps inside Famalaro ' s home . &quot; I don ' t know how they got there . I don ' t know what the relationship is . But I understand she ' s OK , &quot; Wattier said . Reached by telephone , Mendick ' s mother , Doris Wattier , told a reporter &quot; everything ' s fine &quot; before hanging_up . Investigators said they still want to speak with Mendick . &quot; Because of the nature of this crime , we still have the possibility of other victims , &quot; Costa Mesa ' s Lt . Smith said . &quot; If somebody can do this once , what would stop you from doing that again , once you cross that threshold ? &quot; Just this month , court records revealed , authorities received a Silent Witness call -- an anonymous tip -- reporting that a bone had been found in Famalaro ' s house in spring , 1993 , while workers were removing dirt . A woman identified as Marla Tollett was interviewed July 16 -- three days after Huber ' s body was found -- and told authorities she was helping Famalaro remove dirt from his basement in March or April , 1993 , when an 18-inch bone was found -- and later thrown_away . &quot; She recalls a bone approximately 18 inches long being dug_up in the process of removing the dirt from the area , &quot; court documents said . &quot; This bone and other dirt was removed in a bucket and dumped out at an unknown location. &quot; Efforts to reach Tollett Wednesday night were unsuccessful . But Costa Mesa ' s Lt . Smith said after the hearing that police suspect the bone might have belonged_to a large animal , perhaps a deer . Before he was dismissed , defense_attorney Lawrence William Katz repeatedly criticized the prosecution ' s case as largely circumstantial and lacking in_evidence to prove his client is guilty -- or even that he knew about the body . ' He is no danger to the community , &quot; Katz said in a request for the bail hearing , adding that any theories that more victims would be discovered were &quot; hogwash. &quot; During Wednesday ' s hearing , Famalaro , wearing a short-sleeved orange jail uniform and slip-on sandals , appeared subdued as he sat with his defense_attorney . Famalaro was leashed to a deputy -- a routine security measure in Yavapai County , officials said . &quot; They don ' t leave this building unless they ' re on a leash , &quot; Yavapai County Sheriff ' s spokeswoman Laurie Berra said . &quot; It ' s sort of like a standard dog leash. &quot; As the proceeding dragged_on throughout the afternoon , courthouse employees padded into the courtroom , which held about three dozen seats , and strained for a peek . With seats at a premium , some onlookers kneeled . Though members of Famalaro ' s family live_in the area , none apparently attended the hearing . In his testimony , Lt . Mascher said Famalaro was driving with his mother in a red Jeep when he was arrested July 13 . A key to the padlocked Ryder rental truck that contained the freezer was found on the key_ring Famalaro was using to operate the Jeep . A key to the freezer was found at Famalaro ' s home . Mascher said the keys to the handcuffs used to bind Huber ' s hands behind her back were also found in Famalaro ' s desk , while a second pair of similar handcuffs was found under a bed in the home . In yet another twist , Mascher said Famalaro once sought_out a local Arizona man to help him move the freezer while he measured its dimensions to see if it would fit inside his home . The man told authorities the freezer was unplugged during the moving and measuring and later plugged back in when it was determined it would not fit indoors , Mascher said . Famalaro ' s efforts to keep the freezer plugged_in and his efforts to find a better spot for it point to &quot; consciousness of guilt , &quot; the prosecution said . Famalaro had originally been held_on $ 250 # 000 bail , but Justice_of_the_Peace John Kennedy revoked his bail without a hearing after prosecutors argued that the crime was especially &quot; depraved , &quot; that there might be other victims and that the crime may justify the death_penalty . Deputy Yavapai County Attorney Thomas Lindberg also said investigators found a bullet_hole and possibly blood on a white panel van to which Famalaro held the keys when he was arrested . Before Wednesday ' s hearing , Kennedy recused himself from the case , so the proceeding could be transferred to Kuebler ' s more commodious courtroom -- testament to the attention the case has garnered in an area of the country unaccustomed to making such headlines . In court documents filed_in support of his request to reinstate bail , Katz said that Famalaro is a &quot; good Catholic &quot; who attends church and deserves a chance at freedom while charges are pending . The attorney also cited his client ' s links to the community , lack of a criminal_record and past attempts to become a Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputy in support of Famalaro ' s character . But Justice Kuebler said the evidence presented by the prosecution was enough to justify holding Famalaro without bail . &quot; I believe the state has proved its case , and the defendant is held without bond , &quot; he said . The hearing also served as the stage for an unusual confrontation between defense_attorney Katz , and another attorney , Thomas K . Kelly . Kelly said he had been contacted by the Famalaro family two days ago and had been asked to take_over the case -- in part because of the family ' s religious_beliefs , he said . Reluctant to say much until he officially assumes the reins of the defense , Kelly said the family &quot; did contact me and part of the rationale in hiring me is that I am Catholic. &quot; Katz is Jewish . &quot; As you can tell , &quot; Kelly said , &quot; Famalaro is an Italian Catholic name . I am an Irish Catholic . When a person is involved in a matter of this magnitude ( religion ) is a spinoff aspect. &quot; According to Kelly , who lives_in nearby Prescott , he met with Famalaro Wednesday morning before the hearing and the defendant signed a motion approving the counsel swap . &quot; Mama wants a Catholic . No Jews allowed , &quot; Katz said later in the day . Another figure who has emerged in the case is Famalaro ' s brother-in-law , Duane A . Thobe , whose name has surfaced in court documents as the owner of the Prescott Country_Club home where Famalaro lived . Two days before Huber ' s body was discovered , Thobe went_to the Arizona Public_Service and asked that the power to Famalaro ' s house be turned_off . The next day , Famalaro ' s mother asked the utility company to restore the power . Thobe was a Davenport , Iowa , police_officer between 1973 and 1977 . Investigators have talked with Thobe ' s attorney , Eric Chester . &quot; I have nothing to say , and Mr. Thobe has nothing to say , &quot; Chester said . &quot; If I have anything to clear_up , I will clear it up with the authorities. &quot; Investigators have questioned Famalaro ' s brother , Warren , several times . &quot; We are looking_at the possibility of him being anywhere from a witness to a suspect , &quot; Sgt . Holloway said . While authorities continued to examine Famalaro in connection with two slayings in Phoenix and another in Sedona , investigators also revealed Wednesday that Famalaro had another recent encounter with police at his house in which Huber ' s body went undetected . Famalaro himself , investigators said , summoned sheriff ' s deputies to his home_in March to report a burglary . According to the March 20 report filed by deputies , Famalaro told officers three men were attempting to break_into a stolen rental truck in his yard , which at that time , it is believed , housed the freezer containing Huber ' s corpse . The trio , it turned_out , were former employees of Famalaro ' s who had not been paid . Famalaro paid the employees while the police were there , and the incident was considered a closed case . Authorities said Famalaro identified himself as &quot; Jay Samalero , &quot; and although &quot; scared , &quot; did not exhibit suspicious behavior . In a lighter moment during Wednesday ' s deliberations , defense_attorney Katz got Lt . Mascher to agree that most murderers would not summon police to their home . While awaiting the results of forensic tests on the items found at Famalaro ' s home -- including the crowbar -- detectives also have begun to focus_on what happened to Huber between the time she disappeared and the time a freezer was delivered to Famalaro on June 12 , 1991 . Investigators and experts say the timing of her death will prove tricky because she has remained frozen for as long as three years . Holloway said investigators have completed searches of Famalaro ' s former Lake Forest residence and a Trabuco Road mailbox location . No search_warrants have been necessary because authorities have received permission from owners at each location , Costa Mesa police said . As Famalaro exited the courtroom during the afternoon recess , reporters shouted questions to him , but Katz refused to let him speak . &quot; He ' s innocent until proven guilty , &quot; Katz said , &quot; and that ' s why we ' re here right now. &quot; Times staff writers Matt Lait , Gebe Martinez , David Reyes and Rebecca Trounson contributed to this report . * IRONIC LINK : A Phoenix car_dealer is tied to both victim and suspect .
