   <HEADLINE> BOARD WON ' T BACK GROUP ' S EL TORO PLAN ; CONVERSION : SUPERVISORS ' STAND MEANS LINCOLN CLUB WOULD HAVE TO WORK TO GET BASE-USE INITIATIVE ON NOVEMBER BALLOT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A majority of Orange County supervisors said Tuesday they will not support a proposal by leaders of the influential Lincoln Club that would allow voters to decide whether El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station should be converted to a commercial airport . The supervisors ' position means that if Lincoln Club leaders want an initiative placed on the November ballot , they will have to do_it themselves by funding a petition-gathering campaign . In a recent letter to Lincoln Club_members , Supervisor Roger R . Stanton said the initiative should not be put to voters until all_the facts are in on whether an airport is a good use of the 4 # 700-acre base , which is scheduled for closure by 1999 . The supervisor ' s letter was addressed to businessmen George Argyros , Buck Johns and Lincoln Club President Doy Henley , whose conservative political organization includes some the county ' s most powerful business_leaders . The letter effectively kills the prospect of supervisors placing the issue on the Nov . 8 ballot as the club leaders had preferred , since Stanton ' s support was considered pivotal on the split five-member Board of Supervisors . Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder had earlier indicated her support for placing the issue on the ballot and Supervisor William G . Steiner was willing to consider it . But Steiner said Tuesday he now favors Stanton ' s position , which urges that officials continue to work_on base conversion proposals through the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority . &quot; I thought that we could continue our fact-finding and place this on the ballot at_the_same_time , &quot; Steiner said . &quot; I don ' t think the two approaches could work side_by_side . I think we already have a process in place and it needs to be played out. &quot; * Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez , vice_chairman of the El Toro planning authority , said he had never favored an airport referendum but preferred to work_through the existing authority . &quot; I arrived_at my decision independent of the letter , &quot; Vasquez said . &quot; I ' m content to stay_on the course we are following. &quot; Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley , who also is chairman of the El Toro planning authority , was recovering from recent surgery and could not be reached for comment . Wieder also could not be reached for comment . Argyros , Johns and Henley said Stanton ' s letter was &quot; not a surprise , &quot; adding that meetings with key backers of the initiative would continue to determine how the process should move forward . &quot; There are plenty of solid facts to make the ( airport ) decision now , &quot; Argyros said . &quot; What happened , frankly , is that the Board of Supervisors did not have the guts to make the decision now. &quot; Argyros , head of Costa Mesa-based Arnel Development Co . and a member of Gov . Pete Wilson ' s now-defunct base closure commission , criticized supervisors as being traditionally slow to resolve major issues such_as the decade-old problem of where to place a new county jail . The El Toro issue , he said , is another example of a leadership vacuum in local_government . &quot; We really don ' t have any statesman-like actions that come_out of that board , &quot; Argyros said . Said Johns : &quot; We are all trying to do what ' s right for the county . Those of us who are pushing this have very strong feelings that Orange County is in need of this infrastructure. &quot; Several public_opinion surveys -- including a Lincoln Club-funded poll -- have shown voters almost equally divided on whether there should be an airport at El Toro . As proposed , the ballot measure calls_for an amendment to the county ' s General Plan that would require a civilian airport on about 2 # 000 acres of the base . If approved , it would also allow_for the interim use of the base by commercial air cargo carriers while the Marine Corps mission is phased_out . If club leaders go_ahead with the petition-gathering campaign , organizers expect to spend up_to $ 100 # 000 to collect the 66 # 703 needed signatures . The petitions must be submitted by June 1 . &quot; There ' s some concern about our timing and we are reviewing that , &quot; Henley said , adding that the group has also received much encouragement . &quot; But it ' s such an important issue that we are going_to have it in front of us sooner or later. &quot; Those opposed to an airport at El Toro have speculated that the Lincoln Club leaders are attempting to force the issue to a vote because they have personal financial stakes in property near El Toro . But all three businessmen said Tuesday that they had no land holdings or financial interest in the El Toro area . Most of the property surrounding the base is owned by the Irvine Co . &quot; Everybody says , ' Why is somebody doing this ' &quot; initiative ? Johns said . &quot; I have been working_on this airport thing for 15 years . Everybody can look_at the motives and stuff . My guess is that there is no chance for us to be involved in anything that happens there. &quot; Arguing against the ballot measure , Stanton said in his letter that the club ' s intention to seek a new airport at El Toro using a ballot measure might somehow be &quot; subverted &quot; by those who have long sought to shut_down John Wayne Airport . &quot; While you view a commercial El Toro airport as a positive economic asset that can benefit the citizens of Orange County , &quot; Stanton wrote , &quot; it is very likely that others see a new airport at El Toro as the key with which they can lock the gates of John Wayne Airport. &quot; In the past decade , Stanton said , anti-John Wayne Airport activists concerned with increased noise and traffic in the area were somewhat successful in blocking expansion and improvements at John Wayne . &quot; I would be curious if some of these veteran activists are now able to convince those who are concerned about Orange County ' s economy that sufficient common interest now exists to justify an alliance , &quot; Stanton stated in his letter . Henley said he was disappointed in Stanton ' s concern for such an alliance . &quot; The Lincoln Club exists to be involved in good government_issues , and that ' s the only reason we are interested , &quot; Henley said . &quot; We think it ' s an important decision for the county. &quot; * Irvine Mayor Michael Ward , whose city like other South County municipalities have been opposed to a commercial airport at El Toro , was encouraged by Stanton ' s letter . &quot; People think that with El Toro , you just start flying commercial planes in and out of there , &quot; Ward said . &quot; I really think ( the Lincoln Club ) needs to stop and think_about it because , like Supervisor Stanton says , what happens if they lose ? &quot; Members of the business_community , who are generally considered in favor of an airport , have been privately considering the political consequences if voters reject a ballot measure calling_for a commercial airport at El Toro . &quot; If it loses , you will set_back an airport at El Toro for many years , &quot; said one influential member of the business_community who asked not to be identified . He added that members of the business_community fear an initiative on land use would set a bad precedent . Last week , leaders of some of Orange County ' s major business groups met privately to discuss the El Toro initiative but took no position in favor or against . The groups represented included the Building Industry Assn. , the Industrial League of Orange County , the Orange County Chamber_of_Commerce , and Partnership 2010 . Wayne Wedin , of the Orange County Chamber_of_Commerce , said the groups would be urging that the county planning agency speed_up its studies , so that if there is a ballot initiative in November , residents can cast votes based on solid information rather than emotion . Responding to concern that the initiative would fail if pushed too soon , Johns said defeat of the ballot measure would not be a permanent setback . &quot; Good ideas never die , &quot; he said . &quot; They just get voted_down and we bring them up again. &quot; Johns noted that it took two tries_for the Measure M transportation improvements tax increase to be approved by voters . He also pointed to politicians who suffered tough losses in their careers . &quot; Richard Nixon was never defeated , &quot; Johns said . &quot; He was temporarily slowed down. &quot;</TEXT>
