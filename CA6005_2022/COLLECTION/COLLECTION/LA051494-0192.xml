   <HEADLINE> U.S. SECRETLY PUSHING HUMAN_RIGHTS IN CHINA ; ASIA : MISSION AIMS TO WIN CONCESSIONS BEFORE DEADLINE ON TRADE STATUS . MEANWHILE , BEIJING RELEASES A DISSIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration has launched a secret , intensive diplomatic campaign to get China to make more concessions on human_rights in the final weeks before the U.S. deadline for deciding whether Beijing ' s trade privileges in this country should be renewed , officials say . Meanwhile in Beijing , the Chinese government early today bowed to U.S. pressure by releasing Chen Ziming , the most prominent dissident still in jail from the 1989 democracy movement , for what it said were medical reasons . Labeled a &quot; black_hand &quot; by the Beijing government for his leadership role in the 1989 demonstrations in Tian An Men Square , Chen , 41 , is said to be suffering from high_blood_pressure and a skin ailment . But his release on bail today is the latest and most significant in a series of last-minute gestures by the Chinese government in an effort to avert restrictions on its &quot; most favored nation &quot; trading status with the United States , its biggest export market . In hopes of squeezing more concessions from the Beijing regime , the Administration is now trying through secret negotiations to do what Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher was unable to do_in Beijing last March : make the Chinese regime take seriously President Clinton ' s oft-repeated threats to curb China ' s trade benefits if it fails to take concrete steps to ease its repressive policies . In recent days , Administration officials have refused to confirm or deny reports that the President has dispatched a secret emissary to Beijing for talks with the Chinese government . The Administration must decide by June 3 whether to renew China ' s trade benefits , which permit Chinese goods to be exported to the United States with the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other nations . &quot; We ' re not going_to have any comment on any diplomacy that is going_on , &quot; White_House spokesman Tom Ross said Friday . Defending the secrecy , a senior Administration official said , &quot; We ' re in the delicate last stages of this thing , and there ' s a fierce desire not to say anything. &quot; Two senior officials from the Jimmy_Carter Administration , White_House National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and Michel Oksenberg , Brzezinski ' s China expert on the National Security_Council , are scheduled to land Monday in Beijing to take_part in what is officially described as a conference . Brzezinski and Oksenberg were in_charge of the 1978 negotiations leading_up to the establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing . In resorting_to secret diplomacy with Beijing , the Administration is following essentially the same path taken by former President George_Bush , whom Clinton criticized in the 1992 campaign for &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in China . In the six months after China ' s bloody 1989 crackdown , Bush twice dispatched Brent Scowcroft , his national security adviser , and Deputy Secretary_of_State Lawrence S . Eagleburger on secret missions to Beijing . Winston Lord , now Clinton ' s assistant secretary_of_state for East Asia and the Pacific , then denounced Bush for sending &quot; fawning emissaries &quot; to China . Under an executive order issued by Clinton a year ago , China was supposed to make &quot; overall significant progress &quot; on human_rights by this June if it wanted to get its trade benefits renewed for another year . This spring , human_rights groups and several Administration officials have acknowledged that China has not yet made this progress . Before the release of Chen , the Beijing regime over the last few months appeared to take several steps backward by rearresting dissidents who had been freed , such_as leading democracy activist Wei Jingsheng . Chen was sentenced to 13 years in prison in February , 1991 , on charges of conspiring to subvert the government and engaging in counterrevolutionary propaganda and agitation . Chen ' s career as a dissident began in 1976 when he denounced the government in a speech in Tian An Men Square for which he was briefly jailed . He founded the &quot; Beijing Spring &quot; journal in 1979 but was forced to close it under official pressure . In 1986 , Chen founded the Social and Economic Research Institute along with fellow intellectual Wang Juntao . During the 1989 democracy movement , Chen and Wang urged restraint and counseled against direct confrontation with the government . However , in its post-crackdown analysis of the Tian An Men Square events , Chen and Wang were described as the main ringleaders , or &quot; black_hands , &quot; behind the movement . Wang , who suffered from hepatitis , was released April 23 and allowed to travel_to the United States for medical treatment . Chen ' s release means that the two top figures in the democracy movement still in custody have been released on the eve of Clinton ' s decision on renewal of trading relations . The Chinese are hoping the gestures are enough for the Clinton_Administration to de-link trade and human_rights issues . In launching a last-minute diplomatic demarche , the Administration ' s immediate goal is to see if it can win enough changes from Beijing to be able to claim that there has been &quot; significant progress. &quot; Among the possibilities would be a series of releases of prominent dissidents , a promise to end the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts or some new agreement on talks with the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan leader . National Security Adviser Anthony Lake referred briefly to the new negotiations in a television interview Thursday when he acknowledged that after the Christopher trip , the Administration had decided to switch to quiet diplomacy with China . &quot; The way to work this through was to drain the venom out of that rhetoric ( between China and the United States ) , which we have done over the last month or so , and to work it with them very hard and privately , &quot; Lake said . Mann reported from Washington and Tempest from Beijing . Times staff writer Doyle McManus in Geneva contributed to this report .</TEXT>
