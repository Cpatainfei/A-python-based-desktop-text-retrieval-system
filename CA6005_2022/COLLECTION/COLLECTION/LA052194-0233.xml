   <HEADLINE> AD WATCH / CAMPAIGN ' 94 ; BROWN , WILSON TRADE CHARGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown has been airing a new television commercial this week that attacks Republican Gov . Pete Wilson ' s performance as chief_executive on the economy , pushing again her theme that she is &quot; America ' s best treasurer to revive America ' s worst economy. &quot; * THE AD : The commercial opens with black-and-white film of listless people , presumably jobless . A narrator says : &quot; Since Pete Wilson became governor , 550 # 000 jobs have vanished. &quot; With scenes of Brown at_work , the narration continues : &quot; With a_million Californians jobless , Treasurer Kathleen Brown put $ 7.5 billion of voter-approved projects into action building colleges , expanding schools , constructing prisons and providing work for tens of thousands of Californians. &quot; * THE ANALYSIS : Unemployment soared after Wilson took_office in 1991 , but primarily because of the national recession and military-related cutbacks , factors over which Wilson had little or no control . The evidence that California has &quot; America ' s worst economy &quot; is arguable . Even though the unemployment_rate has been running above the national average , California remains one of the nation ' s leaders in the number of fast-growing new firms that create new jobs , according to several surveys . The notion that Brown put $ 7.5 billion worth of projects into action is based on the sale of bonds , a basic responsibility of her office . Brown had no control over how the money from bond sales was spent . The &quot; tens of thousands of jobs &quot; might be accurate , but the only thing Brown had to do with it was to sell the bonds . The statement that Brown is &quot; America ' s best treasurer &quot; is based loosely on her having been honored by one publication as one of the nation ' s outstanding public officials in one year . Wilson aides say that the work of her predecessor was better on the basis of the criteria Brown has cited to support her claim . Wilson began airing a revised 30-second television ad on the immigration issue Wednesday . Much of it is similar to a previous ad , but the new commercial attacks Brown . * THE AD : As does the earlier ad , the new commercial starts_out with fuzzy film footage of illegal immigrants running_across the border in San Diego County . &quot; They keep coming , &quot; an announcer says . Later in the ad , Wilson says : &quot; I ' m working to deny state services to illegal immigrants . Enough is enough. &quot; In the new portion on Brown , the ad says : &quot; Kathleen Brown thinks differently . She supports continuing state services to illegals and says legal immigration is not a cause of problems in California . Where do you stand ? &quot; * THE ANALYSIS : Brown has had major differences with Wilson on the immigration issue , but not necessarily in the manner implied by the Wilson ad . Brown has said that illegal immigration -- and its costs to California -- must be controlled , but argues that the most effective way to do_it is not to cut_off services , as Wilson proposes , but to get the federal_government to control illegal immigration at the border and then to enforce state and federal laws that prohibit employers in California from hiring illegal immigrants . They also differ over what motivates illegal immigrants to come_to California . Wilson has said they come_to this country to get free services such_as health_care and welfare . Brown believes the primary motivation is the search for jobs . Wilson has proposed a federal constitutional amendment that would deny citizenship to children born in the United States to non-citizens . Such children then would not be eligible for state health and welfare benefits now available to all U.S. citizens . Brown has opposed changing the Constitution .</TEXT>
