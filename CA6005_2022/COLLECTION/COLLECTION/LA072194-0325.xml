   <HEADLINE> 25 YEARS AFTER MOONWALK , A STARRY SALUTE ; ANNIVERSARY : AT WHITE_HOUSE , PRESIDENT PRAISES APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUTS AND THE PROMISE OF THAT 1969 MISSION . BUT SOME FEAR THE PIONEER SPIRIT HAS WANED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Twenty-five years after American astronauts left their footprints in the lunar dust and on human history , President Clinton on Wednesday commended the first moon explorers and the U.S. space_program for expanding the horizons of science and the imaginations of a generation of children . Saying that the veterans of the Apollo 11 mission &quot; realized the dreams of a nation &quot; the day Neil Armstrong announced that he had taken &quot; one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind , &quot; Clinton used the White_House ceremony commemorating the first lunar landing to demonstrate support for the current space_program , which has been riddled with cost_overruns and charges of mismanagement . Armstrong , fellow moonwalker Edwin ( Buzz ) Aldrin and Michael Collins , who circled the moon in the command ship , Columbia , while his colleagues went_to the moon ' s surface on the lunar lander , Eagle , took center stage in front of a giant photograph of Aldrin standing on the bleak , gray surface of the moon . &quot; During the Space_Age , we have increased the knowledge of our universe a thousandfold , &quot; said Armstrong , now a graying electronics executive . Turning_to a group of science students , he said : &quot; We leave you much that is undone . There are great ideas undiscovered , breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truth ' s protective layers . There are places to go beyond belief. &quot; But some former astronauts and National Aerospace and Space Administration officials voiced doubts about whether Americans will ever reach those places , saying that the silver-anniversary celebration underscores a lack of vision and commitment to space exploration . In breakfast remarks to members of Congress and former astronauts , Aldrin bemoaned &quot; a withered capacity for wonder and a growing retreat to delusions of a risk-free society &quot; that he said have overtaken what were once bright-eyed visions of space_travel . Eugene Kranz , who served as Apollo 11 ' s flight controller , said in a television interview Wednesday that failure to follow up lunar landings with construction of a permanent moon station is &quot; like Columbus discovering America and then deciding never to come back. &quot; But Clinton assured the Apollo 11 explorers and the 18 other Apollo astronauts attending the White_House ceremony that &quot; our commitment to the space_program is strong and unwavering . The best way to honor these men and all_the others who have helped us so_much is to continue that quest . &quot; Looking_back on that mission , one thing is clear that we ought to remember today -- it wasn ' t easy , &quot; Clinton said . The historic 1969 flight came_close to failure when a computer that was supposed to safely maneuver the tiny landing_craft , which measured only 13 feet in diameter , brought the vehicle dangerously close to a crash . Armstrong took_over the controls and touched_down on the moon with only 20 seconds of fuel remaining . NASA navigators 250 # 000 miles away in Houston heaved a sigh of relief when they heard a garbled transmission : &quot; the Eagle has landed. &quot; As_many as 1 billion people watched on television as America cemented its triumph over the Soviet_Union in a space race born of the Cold_War . But , in a sign that today ' s scientists are hoping for greater international cooperation in future space exploration , two Russian cosmonauts were among the guests at the White_House ceremony . Members of the House Science , Space and Technology Committee -- who earlier in the day had approved a bill authorizing construction of the $ 14-billion space_station -- also filed into the East Room ceremony after their vote . Clinton said that the project would hasten discoveries in medicine and other fields , bolster the aerospace industry and inspire young people to follow in the footsteps of Armstrong , Aldrin and their moonwalking colleagues . Some already have a head_start . &quot; At first , I didn ' t really believe people could go_to the moon , &quot; said Kristina McNeill , a 12-year-old student from Wilmington , N.C. , who attended the ceremony with her classmates from the Young Astronaut science program . &quot; I do want be an astronaut someday. &quot; * MEMORIES OF MOONWALK : Angelenos recall where they were when Eagle landed .
