   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN TALKS TOUGH ON CRIME ; DON ' T FLOUT AMNESTY , FOES TOLD ; RUSSIA : EMBATTLED LEADER FAULTS HIS GOVERNMENT AND COURTS FOR ALLOWING CRIMINALS TO RAMPAGE WITH IMPUNITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bruised by recent political disaster , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin reprimanded his administration Thursday for failing to act decisively against organized_crime and warned his political foes that they will find themselves back behind bars if they step_out of line . Looking fit and ready for a fight , Yeltsin took the unusual step of summoning television_cameras to a meeting of the Russian National Security_Council to put his enemies on notice . &quot; If those granted amnesty by the Duma decision start any activities threatening Russia ' s security , they will again be arrested in accordance with the law , &quot; he said . Reinforcing the get-tough theme he struck in his State of the Nation speech to Parliament last week , Yeltsin warned of a &quot; consolidation &quot; of organized_crime and faulted his government ' s ineffective law_enforcement and court systems for allowing criminals to rampage with impunity . His move seemed aimed at showing himself strong and determined after a series of political setbacks that have left many wondering whether Yeltsin is losing_control of the government . He has had a hellish two weeks . He was outmaneuvered by the conservative Duma , or lower house of Parliament , which declared an amnesty for the hard-liners who tried to topple the government in 1991 and 1993 . Worse , Yeltsin was mouse-trapped by his very own , vaunted constitution , which made the amnesty legal . Next , two trusted aides refused to carry_out Yeltsin ' s orders to delay the hard-liners ' release from prison . After Former Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan I . Khasbulatov walked_out_of jail Saturday , he declared himself disgusted with politics . But fired Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi immediately let it be known through aides that he plans to run_for president in 1996 . The former Afghan War hero , who grew an Old Testament-style beard during his five months in Lefortovo prison , called_for peace and national accord and promised to &quot; do my utmost to prevent enmity and antagonism. &quot; Rutskoi has not elaborated on his plans . Based on the parliamentary amnesty , on Wednesday a court dismissed proceedings against the hard-line leaders accused of plotting to overthrow Soviet leader Mikhail S . Gorbachev in August , 1991 . It was an ignominious historical footnote to Yeltsin ' s finest moment , when he climbed atop a tank in front of the White_House to defy the Communist junta . More_than 2 1 / 2 years later , the trial of the putschists had disintegrated into a soapbox from which Yeltsin ' s enemies denounced him for destroying the Soviet_Union and wrecking the Russian economy . Still , the dismissal of the treason case against the coup-plotters was a symbolic blow to a president who can ill afford more bad news . &quot; The situation is beginning to smell not of elections in 1996 , but of gunpowder and bloodshed here_and_now , &quot; said gloomy economic guru Yegor T . Gaidar in a newspaper interview Thursday . If the president was clobbered on the domestic front , he fared only a little better on the international stage . Moscow scored a victory for its newly assertive foreign_policy by persuading Radovan Karadzic , the visiting Bosnian Serb leader , to agree to reopen the Tuzla airport to humanitarian shipments . But relations with the West have worsened because of the Aldrich H . Ames espionage case and its acrimonious aftermath . The damage continued to pile_up Thursday , when the Federal Counterintelligence Service disclosed yet another , though far less significant , espionage arrest . A spokesman for the agency said Thursday that it had arrested two men for allegedly trying to sell the United States secrets about a top-secret T-82 tank manufactured at the Uralvagonzavod plant in the Ural Mountains city of Nizhny Tagil . One of the men contacted a U.S. Embassy official , identified as Kelli Ann Hamilton , in Moscow in January , 1993 , and offered to sell her secrets , spokesman Alexander G . Mikhailov said . But the case against the two men was dropped_in December , 1993 , after they confessed and after it was determined that their actions had not damaged Russian national security , he said . Russia ' s hard economic times have triggered &quot; a whole flow of such proposals &quot; to trade information for hard currency , Mikhailov said . &quot; In a country that is big , but hungry and poor , patriotism is difficult. &quot;</TEXT>
