   <HEADLINE> HAPPINESS AT THE 11TH HOUR ; KANTOR ANNOUNCES NEW JAPAN TRADE DEAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The series of very substantial trade agreements reached over the weekend between the United States and Japan were not simply about opening_up Japan to more American goods and services . The eleventh-hour deal was also about opening a much-needed new chapter in U.S.-Japan relations . As Clyde Prestowitz , a former U.S. trade official and frequent critic of Japanese trade practices , put it , the understandings &quot; put U.S.-Japan relations on a new plane . It ' s a win-win proposition. &quot; Maybe the Japanese won ' t think so , because despite the milestone market-opening agreements in insurance , glass , medical and telecommunications_equipment , Tokyo may yet face U.S. trade sanctions . The two countries did not resolve their longstanding dispute on Japanese barriers to American cars and auto parts , which account_for two-thirds of America ' s $ 60-billion annual trade_deficit with Japan . Consequently , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is taking steps that could lead to possibly imposing sanctions . But many months have to pass before that happens . Still , what was achieved in these difficult talks was remarkable . The long pattern of superficial U.S.-Japan agreements has been broken . The United States , which under the Clinton_Administration has been taking an uncharacteristically firm line with Japan , had put Tokyo on notice that it was seeking a &quot; results-oriented &quot; policy . The American strategy was not to allow Japan to defuse and obfuscate the issue of results in addressing the chronic , intolerably high trade imbalance . The two sides agreed to what Washington certainly hopes is objective , enforceable criteria to measure progress , but specific numerical targets were tip-toed around , as the Japanese preferred . Over the past 15 months an impasse over how to measure results had been a major hurdle . Now the big question is whether U.S. insurance_companies will , in fact , find it easier to sell products in Japan ; whether the Japanese government actually buys U.S. medical and telecommunications_equipment , and whether U.S. makers of flat glass used in automobiles and construction truly find Japanese buyers . The fragile government of Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama will now want to follow_through with other programs , such_as domestic deregulation and tax reform . The United States sees efforts on these fronts as crucial to stimulating the Japanese market for foreign goods and services . Meanwhile , there is still the prickly issue of autos and auto parts . Detroit has made some progress in penetrating the Japanese market , but more needs to be done_by Tokyo , especially when it comes_to auto replacement parts . The specter of sanctions puts pressure on the auto talks to produce results . Even so , Tokyo is now committed , at least in principle , to eroding some structural barriers to foreign goods and services . That is progress . If the auto sector were somehow included in this new phase of cooperation , that would really signal a sea change in the U.S.-Japan relationship .</TEXT>
