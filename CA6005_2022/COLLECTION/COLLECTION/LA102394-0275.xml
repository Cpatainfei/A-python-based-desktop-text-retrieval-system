   <HEADLINE> RICH CACHE OF AMBER FULL OF PREHISTORIC CREATURES MINED IN CARIBBEAN ; DOMINICAN_REPUBLIC : THE FOSSILIZED TREE RESIN HAS BEEN USED AS DECORATION SINCE THE STONE_AGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> High in the_hills surrounding this city in the Cibao Valley , hundreds of narrow openings tunnel into the world ' s second-richest cache of amber . For scientists , the ancient tree resin found in the tunnels brings a glimpse into primeval life in the West Indies through perfectly preserved prehistoric creatures . For mine owners like Ramon Martinez , the tunnels mean annual sales of about $ 25 # 000 in a country where the per-capita income is less than $ 500 a year . For amber miners and their families , the tunnels mean three meals a day and perpetuation of a family occupation . Gem-like in its rich shades of gold , orange , brown and , rarely , blue , the fossilized tree sap has been used as a decoration and good-luck charm since the Stone_Age . The largest and most accessible source is the Baltic coast , where resin is easily mined in shoreline deposits and sometimes even washes_up on beaches . Amber is also mined in southeastern Mexico , Canada , China , the Middle_East , Alaska , Australia and New Zealand . But it is in the dense subtropical hills of this poor Caribbean country that some of the most valuable amber samples -- those containing the prehistoric insects -- are found . Millions of years ago , trees from now-vanished forests produced a sticky resin that slowly hardened into iridescent clumps . Often the hardening sap became a premature tomb for an unlucky grasshopper or tick . Today , a piece of amber with such contents is worth thousands of dollars . A rock with a 30-million-year-old lizard trapped inside is worth about $ 15 # 000 , Martinez said . Not long ago , Dominican miners tossed_out such pieces , believing them to be flawed and worthless . Now , proceeds from such a find can feed a miner ' s family for months . Martinez employs five teams of seven or eight men to extract amber from his mines . Dominican miners earn about $ 10 a day , according to some industry sources -- twice the average salary of their counterparts in the sugar_cane and coffee fields , the country ' s main sources of income . &quot; They live simply , but they ' re not destitute , &quot; said Patrick Fagg , a jeweler who sells amber in the northern resort town of Sosua . Most miners live near the tunnels in the Cordillera Septentional mountain_range in huts made of tin or palm leaves . They spend their days about 600 feet underground , where they crouch or lie_in the light of flickering candles , chipping the amber out of hard rock . Despite long hours and high risks , most amber miners would n ' t consider leaving the trade into which they were born , says George O . Poinar Jr. , a paleobiologist at UC Berkeley and author of several books on amber . About 500 families work in the amber mines of the north-central Cibao Valley , Martinez said . The miners ' age range , he says , is 10 to 60 . Martinez , 42 , has worked in the amber business for 30 years . As a teen-ager , he and his brothers followed his uncle to Santiago ' s mines to buy small pieces of amber . It was about the time the Dominican government began to see amber ' s potential as a mineral export . In his tiny shop in a large , run-down market on the outskirts of town , Martinez shaves and polishes the crude amber brought_in daily from his mines . He sells it to buyers from Japan , Italy and the United States . Three years ago , he provided American movie producers with a piece of amber containing an ancient mosquito . It inspired an incident in the 1993 movie &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; In the film , scientists use dinosaur blood inside the mosquito to reconstruct and clone dinosaurs . Dominican amber sales jumped fivefold in the aftermath of the science-fiction hit , Martinez said . The movie also spawned a thriving counterfeit amber industry . Street vendors around the world sell unwitting tourists realistic plastic pieces that sometimes contain newly dead frogs or lizards . &quot; There are some spectacular forgeries out there , &quot; said David Grimaldi , an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural_History in New York . One way to tell the difference : True amber , when rubbed hard , emits a pleasant pine scent . It also becomes electrically charged . Although demand for the semiprecious material has fallen_in the last year , scientists still consider Dominican amber unparalleled for its fossils . &quot; The preservation is unreal , &quot; said Francis Hueber , a paleobotanist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington . &quot; We ' re able to dissect the amber and expose the actual structures of an ( prehistoric ) insect ' s muscles , eyes , jaws and nervous system. &quot; Miners say amber is less plentiful now than it was a decade ago , but few in the industry believe that the world ' s supply will be depleted anytime soon . &quot; Deposits are always being discovered , &quot; said Grimaldi . He and a team from the American Museum recently found several significant 90-million-year-old deposits near Raritan Bay , N.J. Amber is removed with high-tech mining and dredging equipment in most places . In the Dominican_Republic , the miners ' only tools are hammers , chisels and calloused hands .</TEXT>
