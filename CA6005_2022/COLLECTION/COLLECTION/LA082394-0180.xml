   <HEADLINE> EMBASSIES SWEET -- AND SOUR ; LIFESTYLES : THE DIPLOMATS WHO LIVE AND WORK ALL OVER WASHINGTON , D.C. , SPECIALIZE IN RESOLVING INTERNATIONAL CRISES . BUT GETTING ALONG WITH THE NEIGHBORS ? THAT CAN BE EVEN TRICKIER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was moving day at the Russian embassy and a small parade of dullish-blue vans lumbered along Massachusetts Avenue , loaded with antique furniture and vodka boxes packed with assorted papers and , perhaps , some old secrets . After generations in a stately old building purchased by their Czarist predecessors near the heart of the capital , Russian diplomats last month relocated to the suburbs under the watchful eye of uniformed U.S. Secret_Service police and neighbors such_as Charlotte Jones . &quot; For many people in this city , there ' s still a Cold_War being waged with embassies and their diplomats , &quot; said the Glover Park resident , standing outside the new embassy , nicknamed by locals &quot; the Kremlin on the Potomac. &quot; &quot; I mean , look_at the buildings , those terrible Soviet-looking things . They scar the neighborhood. &quot; Such is the world of diplomatic Washington , where 168 foreign_missions practice a curious brand of neighborhood diplomacy -- not just with one another but with a sometimes-uneasy population of ever-watchful locals . On tree-shaded streets and especially along Massachusetts Avenue -- dubbed Embassy Row -- diplomatic headquarters sit alongside homes whose owners are often miffed over where the diplomats park and how often they mow their lawns , and suspicious of just who passes_through embassy doors . While locals worry about diplomatic immunity run amok and millions in unpaid parking-ticket fines amassed by embassies , tourists flock past colorful foreign flags so abundant they need a guidebook to decipher them all . Indeed , there ' s a topsy-turvy geography to Washington ' s diplomatic landscape . Embassies of feuding nations sit side-by-side or just blocks apart . Countries that couldn ' t be farther away on the world map are unlikely neighbors . El_Salvador is a block away from the former Yugoslavia . The Bolivians are next door to the_British and across from the South_Africans . Here , the Austrians rub elbows with the Pakistanis . Cameroon is a neighbor to Venezuela . The Israelis are near their former mortal_enemies the Egyptians and Jordanians -- close enough to borrow a cup of sugar in a pinch . And the Zimbabweans -- they ' re next door to the Washington School of Psychiatry . Embassies of richer nations such_as France , Japan and England have sprawling compounds where diplomats host lavish parties , film festivals and cultural exhibits for guests including local residents . Poorer nations , such_as Rwanda , Guatemala or Bangladesh , reside in more modest properties -- some in multistory brick structures that might have once housed a single upper-middle-class family . Some embassies are owned , others leased . Most have their offices -- called chancelleries -- connected to the ambassador ' s residence . Newborn nations sometimes conduct business from a hotel_room or desk in an attorney ' s office . &quot; Location is everything , especially in the world of embassies , &quot; said Harry W . Porter , deputy director of the State_Department ' s Office of Foreign Missions . &quot; Most countries strive for the prestige of a respectable address . Others try to do business on the cheap . We ' ve had to inform some that the neighborhood they ' ve chosen is dangerous , that it ' s just not a good idea to move there. &quot; * Until its government changed , the South_African embassy held the dubious distinction of attracting the most demonstrators . After President Nelson Mandela was elected , the anti-apartheid protesters were invited as honored guests to his Inauguration_Day celebration here . The Canadians have perhaps the choicest site in Washington -- a Pennsylvania Avenue address with sweeping views of the city . Iran ' s ramshackle embassy has been abandoned for more_than a decade , since its diplomats were banished after a mob takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran . And the Israelis -- they ' re known for security . No one enters without an appointment -- especially after the bombing of an Israeli embassy building in London and a Jewish social_services center in Buenos Aires last month . &quot; Inside this building , &quot; said one worker , &quot; you are in the safest place in the world. &quot; While uneasiness separates some Middle Eastern diplomats , Israeli , Bahraini , Jordanian and Egyptian embassy workers eat lunch together at a tiny park near their chancelleries . Not all relationships are so courtly . On Massachusetts Avenue , where chancelleries are packed tighter than summer tourists on a subway ride , tempers often flare . In 1976 , when a car_bomb killed former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier at Sheridan Circle , the noise and flying shrapnel startled diplomats in the nearby embassies of Greece and Turkey , bitter antagonists . Each embassy reported to the State_Department that it was under_attack by the other . And the Israeli chancellor , traveling in a car near the bomb_site , feared he was a target of a Palestinian attack . * Meanwhile , Washingtonians are growing more suspicious of immunity enjoyed by foreign diplomats . While embassies are not exactly considered foreign soil , they ' re the next closest thing . &quot; They ' re inviolate , &quot; Porter said . &quot; That means anyone on the property is a guest -- even local police . Embassies have sometimes not allowed firemen on the premises even to fight a fire. &quot; There are now 2 # 700 diplomats and 5 # 700 of their dependents living_in the Washington area -- in addition to 4 # 000 staffers and their 5 # 000 dependents . All have been granted full criminal immunity . Last year , 20 serious crimes were committed by some of the 19 # 500 foreign embassy and consulate personnel nationwide . In Washington , those offenses included arson , burglary , sexual_assault , thefts and weapons charges . Prosecution is nearly impossible . &quot; In cases where a U.S. citizen is a victim , we seek an explanation from the embassy , &quot; said one senior State_Department official . &quot; But with full immunity , a diplomat may_not have to cooperate . So , in theory , he could get_away with rape , or worse. &quot; Such immunity makes many locals wary : &quot; I have a rule never to cross the street in front of a car with diplomatic plates , &quot; said Dupont Circle resident Anna Campos . &quot; If they hit you , they ' re going to bolt for home . It ' s the first thing you learn in this town. &quot; * Parking is another sore spot . Diplomats receive hundreds of parking_tickets each year -- and ignore most of them . Through last fall , foreign embassies had amassed more_than $ 6.5 million in unpaid citations in recent years , prompting a public outcry . Embassy employees are technically required to pay fines , but nothing happens if they don ' t : Cars with diplomatic plates cannot be booted or impounded . The Russians are the worst offenders , accounting_for three-quarters of diplomatic parking_tickets , more_than $ 2.5 million worth in three years . &quot; Once in a blue_moon a Russian diplomat will pay_for a ticket , &quot; Porter said . &quot; And you know how often blue_moons occur. &quot; In the late 1970s , the city_council passed an ordinance to block embassies from moving_into residential neighborhoods , but Congress overturned it . Embattled embassies will often try to smooth ruffled relations with neighbors over parking , noise and land-use issues . &quot; Embassies have learned to be good neighbors because resident groups can be vocal , &quot; Porter said . &quot; They really get after them. &quot; The Turks have been in court for several years over an embassy renovation job . And the Italians , planning to build a new embassy in wooded Rock Creek Park , have thrown parties for locals worried about the site ' s deforestation . &quot; Schmoozing neighbors , &quot; Porter said , &quot; is part of the job -- they are , after all , diplomats. &quot; * For many foreign diplomats , however , Washington can be a lonely assignment -- years spent in a far-flung post with little feel_for local customs or events unfolding back home . &quot; The day of the 1991 coup in our country was a very lonely day here , &quot; said Russian counselor Vladimir Pechatnov . &quot; All we could do was watch the television and wonder if we had a home to return to anymore. &quot; Boniface Karani , a counselor at the Rwandan embassy , still has nightmares over the civil_war in his country . &quot; Often , you are out of the loop in Washington , &quot; he said . &quot; I have friends and family members who may_not be alive anymore. &quot; Outside the Rwandan embassy , high_school students from Kansas City shouted questions at the teen-age daughters of a diplomat sitting on the front steps : &quot; Why all_the killing and violence ? &quot; they asked . &quot; Why isn ' t anything being done ? &quot; Inside , standing next to a three-foot-tall stuffed Rwandan gorilla and a collection of tribal spears , Karani said , &quot; You Americans had your own Civil War and you fought until the_matter was settled -- no outsiders got involved . Give us the same chance to settle things without outside intervention. &quot; ( Several days later , President Clinton announced that the United States would no longer recognize the Rwandan government , and all diplomats were vacated from the embassy. ) But perhaps the Russians tell the real tale of changing embassy life : For years , they represented the very image of the unwanted , mistrusted outsider . In 1969 , the Soviets purchased a 10-acre former Veterans Administration hospital on a hill overlooking the capital . The deal was criticized by politicians who claimed the snoopy Soviets might intercept sensitive intelligence transmissions from their perch . The moving day was delayed for decades , most recently in retaliation over Washington ' s concerns that a new U.S. embassy in Moscow was riddled with intelligence bugs . In 1992 , the Russians were finally given the go-ahead to make the move . Like other former Soviet republics , the Russians say they want to put their secretive pasts behind them . Still , counselor Pechatnov says he will miss the 16th Street chancellery -- a secret-soaked old building that saw years of intrigue . &quot; These walls , &quot; he said , &quot; have many stories to tell. &quot;</TEXT>
