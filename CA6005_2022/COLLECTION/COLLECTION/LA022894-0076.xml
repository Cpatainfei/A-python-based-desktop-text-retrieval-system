   <HEADLINE> GRAF MAKES IT LOOK SO EASY ; TENNIS : AMANDA COETZER IS NO FACTOR FROM BASELINE IN 6-0 , 6-4 FINAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steffi Graf wrapped_up career title No . 82 by winning the Evert Cup on Sunday , packed up the Golden Retriever puppy she bought last week at a local shopping_mall and headed to Delray Beach , Fla. , where she is expected to dominate yet another tournament field . Is it becoming boring ? &quot; To you ? &quot; Graf asked a reporter . &quot; I ' m not bored. &quot; Graf , who has not dropped a set_in 17 matches this year , earned another $ 80 # 000 by defeating Amanda Coetzer , 6-0 , 6-4 , in 57 minutes in the final at Hyatt Grand Champions . &quot; I didn ' t really have too_much difficulty this week , &quot; said Graf , who spent more_than an hour on the court in only one of five matches , needing 79 minutes to eliminate Ginger Helgeson in the quarterfinals . Graf spent most of her time pampering her puppy , which she named Joshua in a nod to the trees that dot the Mojave_Desert landscape . &quot; Sure , sometimes you want to be in a tighter situation or have to work a little bit harder , but if that ' s not the case , you ' ve just got_to concentrate and continue your match , &quot; Graf said . She does that better than anybody else in women ' s tennis . In three finals this year , the WTA Tour ' s top-ranked player has yet to spend more_than an hour on the court , routing second-ranked Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 57 minutes at the Australian Open and defeating fourth-ranked Martina Navratilova in 60 minutes at Tokyo . &quot; The last three tournaments , I haven ' t really been close to feeling I ' m not playing well , &quot; Graf said . &quot; I ' ve been very confident , I ' ve been playing so well . &quot; It ' s been three tournaments without having problems with my matches . I think that ' s a pretty good accomplishment. &quot; The sixth-seeded Coetzer upset second-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez , the defending champion , in the quarterfinals and third-seeded Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals to advance to the final for the second year in a row , but neither of those players prepared her for Graf . The South_African all but acknowledged as much afterward . Part of her strategy against Graf , Coetzer said , was to &quot; just be patient and not be intimidated by the way she plays . &quot; I don ' t think I was really thinking_of beating her . I was more focused on every point and just trying to stay with her , at least for a while. &quot; As a baseliner , Coetzer realized she was in_trouble . &quot; To beat her from the baseline , you really have to hope for a bit of an off-day ( by Graf ) , &quot; she said . &quot; You ' re not going_to beat her often from the baseline . I really think you have to be able to come_to the net and attack the backhand , which is not really one of my strong points. &quot; Unable to change her style , Coetzer took her lumps . &quot; Everybody tries to do what they ' re used to and what they ' re best at , &quot; Graf said . &quot; It ' s difficult for some players to change . For example , Amanda , she ' s not someone who ' s going_to hit the balls away ( for winners ) or can come_in ( to the net ) . She ' s not that type of player . Unless you ' re somebody who ' s used to doing the right thing against me , it ' s difficult. &quot; Graf closed_out the first set by winning the last 14 points and led in the second , 5-2 , before faltering slightly . Coetzer ' s service_break in the ninth game of the second set was only the second of the week against Graf . &quot; I didn ' t finish ( the match ) very well , &quot; said Graf , ever the perfectionist . &quot; But when it mattered , I played well again. &quot; The German has won 65 of her last 67 matches and 11 of her last 12 tournaments , including all four Grand_Slam events . After winning $ 2 # 821 , 337 last year , she already has won $ 544 # 063 this year . Only Martina Navratilova , Chris Evert and Evonne Goolagong Cawley have won more tournaments , but Graf is only 24 . &quot; I ' m happy about the way my life is going_for quite some time , &quot; Graf said . &quot; The last thing I was missing was being injury-free and I ' ve got that this year . So , I ' m lucky and happy. &quot; And not at all bored .</TEXT>
