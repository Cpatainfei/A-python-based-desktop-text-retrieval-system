   <HEADLINE> THE AMERICAN FACTOR ; ISRAEL STRUGGLES TO COPE WITH A VIOLENT RADICAL FRINGE FROM THE U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dr. Baruch Goldstein was not an exception . The Jewish settler who systematically massacred more_than 40 Palestinians as they prayed at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron was preceded by Elliot Goodman and Craig Laitner . In April , 1982 , Goodman , of Tenefly , N.J. , stormed into the El Omar mosque on Mount Temple in Jerusalem and fired into a Palestinian crowd . Miraculously , &quot; only &quot; two worshipers were killed and 11 wounded . Two years later , Laitner and three colleagues , all from Jewish neighborhoods in New York , opened_fire on a bus carrying Palestinian workers near the same city . Five were injured . The Israeli authorities treated both men harshly . Goodman was sentenced to life . Laitner , who escaped to the United States but was later extradited , was convicted by an Israeli court and sentenced to several years in jail . Still , successive Israeli governments , including the present one , regarded these incidents as isolated , refusing to admit they were products of a larger psychological environment -- the Jewish settlers ' movement that had nourished Palestinian hatred . The Israeli government is now paying the price of this accommodating attitude toward Jewish extremism . The Goldstein massacre has temporarily stalled peace talks between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel . Unrest in the occupied territories is_on the rise . And Jewish settlers are resisting the government ' s efforts to disarm the most violent among them . Goldstein ' s attack shares much in common with the preceding two . The perpetrators wore , for disguise , Israeli army uniforms and used automatic_rifles originally issued by the army for self-defense . They were all settlers on the West_Bank . All were American Jews who had emigrated to Israel . And all drew their inspiration from the Kach movement and its leader , Meir Kahane . Kach , which means &quot; this is the way &quot; or &quot; thus &quot; in Hebrew , is another Israeli import from the United States . It was founded , in 1973 , by Kahane , who first gained prominence in America when he established the Jewish Defense League in the late 1960s . When tensions increased between blacks and Jews in Queens and Brooklyn , Kahane and his small group of followers distributed weapons to Jews and organized armed patrols to protect them . His slogan was &quot; Never Again. &quot; Soon , however , the JDL evolved into a group of Jewish vigilantes and thugs who used guns , explosives and threats of violence against anyone they considered an enemy of Jews , including liberal Jews . A growing embarrassment to the Jewish mainstream Establishment and to U.S. law-enforcement agencies , Kahane was persuaded to emigrate to Israel . In Israel , Kahane and his followers received a mixed reception . The majority of Israelis abhorred Kahane ' s politics of racism . Several right-wing politicians , however , found his preaching useful , even enticing . Unconfirmed reports tied right-wing Israeli businessmen -- including Yitzhak Shamir before he became prime_minister -- to efforts to smuggle arms to Kahane ' s U.S.-based JDL . When Kahane carried_out violent acts against Arabs , he was arrested ; some Kach members were placed under police surveillance . Yet , time and again , he was released and the surveillance was soon lifted . This allowed him to fuel tensions by using what many Israelis regarded_as &quot; American-made &quot; stunts . The population of Israel ' s expatriate American community is estimated to be 60 # 000 -- barely 1.5 % of the country ' s 4.4 million Jews . The Russian , Moroccan , Romanian , Iraqi , Polish and Argentine Jewish communities settled since independence in 1948 are far larger . Yet , the influence of American Jews on Israeli society is far greater . They can be found in all walks of Israeli life -- in government , the army , business , the professions . Many are leading artists and writers . Yet , a substantial number of them identify with the political radicalism and religious militancy found on the fringe of Israel ' s politics , particularly on the West_Bank . To be sure , the vast majority of the 120 # 000 Jews who live_in the 144 rural and urban communities on the West_Bank are law-abiding citizens . Most are secular Israelis drawn to the region by subsidized housing and by a desire to improve their quality_of_life . Only a relatively small minority -- no more_than 10 # 000 -- firmly embraces an uncompromising nationalism laced with the religious conviction that this land was promised by God to Abraham and his offspring . Half are of American origin . True , when Kahane and his followers arrived in Israel in 1972 , they found an environment already infected by the nationalist virus , one fed by years of Palestinian terrorism and the Arabs ' rejection of the right of Israel to exist . Yet , they brought with them ideas , deeply rooted in American culture , that helped produce a virulent strain of nationalism -- a readiness to resort_to political violence , trigger-happiness , vigilantism . All are imbrued with the emotions of the Holocaust . Young Israelis are taught that the establishment of Israel was the answer to the Holocaust , the ultimate guarantee that it would never happen again . But for the average young or middle-age American Jew , the Holocaust is a historic reality , a constant reminder of the threats to Israel ' s existence and to Jews . Using American methods , Kahane packaged his message of hatred of Arabs in sound_bites for television . He modeled his tactics after the civil-rights marches , leading his supporters into the heart of Arab towns and villages , where he called_for the expulsion of Arabs . He always made_sure that TV cameras were in tow . Although his strong American accent was grating to Israeli ears and his body_language suggestive_of a disturbed personality , some young Israelis found Kahane charismatic and his messianic message seductive . In 1984 , 20 # 000 Israelis elected him to Parliament . He refused to pledge allegiance to the state and claimed he would only declare loyalty to his God . The political atmosphere created by the right-wing governments of Menachem Begin and Shamir tolerated the Kahanes . But when his rising popularity threatened to disrupt the political balance , right and left united to ban Kahane and his movement from participating in the 1988 elections . They were accused of preaching hatred , racism , anti-democracy and , worst of all , the purity of Jewish blood . Kahane ' s assassination , in 1990 , only served to strengthen his legacy . In his voyage to the dark side of the Israeli psyche , he found fertile soil in which to plant his seed . No doubt , Kahane ' s lasting achievement is his exposure of this part of the Israeli character . By publicly advocating the expulsion of Arabs , he broke Israeli -- and Jewish -- taboos , thereby pushing them to the top of the Israeli-Palestinian agenda . There are Israelis , like retired Gen . Rehavam Zeevi , who preach Kahane ' s sermon using more &quot; sensible &quot; and &quot; respectable &quot; language . And there remain Kahane ' s own followers . Despite the recent steps taken by the Israeli government to curb the movements of Kach members , most remain at_large and armed . Some are capable of picking_up where Goldstein left_off . The vicious_circle of massacre , vengeance and revenge between Jew and Arab in the Middle_East seems to have spread to New York last week , when a van of Hasidic students was fired on . Four were wounded , two seriously . A Lebanese national has been charged in the shooting . More_than goodwill will be needed to stop such attacks , here as well as in the Middle_East . The PLO must return to the negotiating table , and the Israeli government has to demonstrate its seriousness in vowing to crack_down on Jewish extremists . Otherwise , the Goldstein &quot; incident &quot; may be only a prelude . * OP-ED : Inside the mind of Baruch Goldstein , on page M5 .</TEXT>
