   <HEADLINE> S . AFRICA LEADERS OFFER CONCESSIONS TO MILITANTS ; POLITICS : AMENDMENTS TO INTERIM CONSTITUTION URGED . AIM IS TO LURE ZULUS , RIGHTISTS INTO ELECTORAL PROCESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping to defuse a growing political crisis and reduce the threat of civil_war , leaders of the government and the African National Congress on Wednesday announced major political concessions in hopes of luring militant black_and_white holdouts into the election process . President Frederik W . de Klerk announced that the Parliament will be called into special_session in early March to ratify a series of amendments to the recently approved interim constitution . Among other changes , the new provisions would allow the use of two ballots instead of one in the April elections , so voters can pick different parties for the National Assembly and provincial legislatures . And far greater regional autonomy would be granted to the country ' s nine new provinces . The Parliament will also be asked to modify the law so the holdout parties can register to contest the elections , the first in which South_Africa ' s black majority will be able to vote . Nineteen parties had registered before the deadline expired last Saturday . ANC and government negotiators say the constitutional changes go_a_long_way toward meeting key demands of the Freedom Alliance , a fractious coalition of militant right-wing Afrikaner groups ; the pro-segregationist Conservative_Party ; conservative black homeland leaders who were installed under apartheid , and the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party . The groups are united in their fear that their current powers will be crushed under an ANC-dominated government led by Nelson Mandela , the ANC president . The alliance has said it will boycott the elections and not abide_by the post-apartheid constitution unless its demands are met . Its leaders have repeatedly threatened to launch a campaign of armed resistance if they are not given far greater regional autonomy , including the creation of an independent white homeland for Afrikaners and the restoration of the traditional Zulu kingdom in eastern South_Africa . None of the accommodations announced Wednesday night specifically dealt with those two demands . But the changes include a new constitutional provision guaranteeing the principle of &quot; self-determination &quot; and a promise to create a mechanism for consideration of limited ethnic or racial enclaves under provincial charters . The ANC remains opposed to the establishment of territories based on race , but Mandela said he is willing to discuss white fears and to try to work_out a solution . The proposed changes also include additional powers of regional taxation and greater devolution of authority to guarantee more independence to the provincial assemblies . This could make_it more difficult for an ANC-dominated National Assembly to rewrite the interim constitution to override local decisions , a key demand of the smaller parties . In this vein , the concession on two ballots is significant because the ANC and the government previously had insisted on one ballot , a device that seemed likely to ensure greater majorities for the two dominant parties and the demise of many smaller ones . In a small but also important gesture , Natal province will also be renamed KwaZulu / Natal . KwaZulu , now a homeland in Natal that was created under apartheid , is a traditional name for the Zulu land , and this demand has been an emotional issue among many Zulus . &quot; We are firmly of the view that these proposals remove all_the remaining obstacles for the parties which have not yet done so to register and become part of the process , &quot; Mandela said at a Johannesburg news_conference before he left on a fund-raising visit to the_Netherlands . Leaders of the Freedom Alliance declined immediate comment , saying they needed time to study the proposals . Earlier Wednesday , Zulu chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi had warned at a news_conference here in Cape_Town that the country faced &quot; a holocaust &quot; if the disaffected groups were not accommodated . The package is virtually identical to one that the government offered to the Freedom Alliance before intensive , closed-door negotiations broke_down last week . At the time , the ANC and the government said the changes would be made only if the alliance members agreed to participate in the election and respect the results . The new version , however , will be implemented whether or not the alliance agrees to renounce violence and join the democratic process . It effectively throws the ball into their court , and gives their leaders , or at least their supporters , a face-saving way to avoid being shut_out of the transition to a post-apartheid government . &quot; The road to peaceful participation in the election is , in our opinion , now open_to all_the parties , and the government expresses its hope that the Freedom Alliance will now place the interests of South_Africa and its own voters first , &quot; De Klerk said in Pretoria . He added : &quot; We are going_to do this whether the Freedom Alliance accepts the present conditions or not . Time is of the essence. &quot; De Klerk will meet with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini today to discuss the package . The king announced Monday that he wanted the government to cede him the northeast quadrant of the country to create an independent monarchy as a home for the estimated 8 million Zulus . Mandela said the ANC is also prepared to meet with the king . The sharp shift by the government and ANC allows them to claim the moral high ground by unilaterally yielding to avoid greater bloodshed in a country already racked by fierce factional fighting . More_than 4 # 000 people were reported killed in political violence last year . In separate incidents Wednesday , an ANC local leader and school_principal was shot to death as he taught a class near Port Shepstone in Natal . Further west , in the Eastern Transvaal , about 30 people were wounded when police fired shotguns and rubber bullets at blacks protesting right-wing plans to declare the town of Standerton part of a white homeland . &quot; We must treat the threat of civil_war seriously . That is why we have gone_out of our way to make these concessions , &quot; Mandela said . But he warned that the transition to democracy and black majority_rule will proceed with or without the Freedom Alliance . Mandela told reporters that the country ' s first democratic elections will not be postponed under any circumstances .</TEXT>
