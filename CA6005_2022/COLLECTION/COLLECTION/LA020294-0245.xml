   <HEADLINE> NO WRONGDOING BY BROWN SEEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal grand_jury in Miami found no wrongdoing by Commerce_Secretary Ron Brown in connection with efforts by the Vietnamese to get a U.S. trade_embargo lifted , a government official said late Tuesday . Another official , also speaking on grounds of anonymity , said it was expected that the Justice_Department would soon close its investigation of the Cabinet officer . The FBI launched a probe early last year into allegations that Brown accepted $ 700 # 000 to help lift the trade_embargo against Vietnam . The Justice_Department ' s Public Integrity Section has been overseeing the probe . The closure of the case would indicate that Brown has been cleared by the investigation . Brown previously had denied the allegations by Binh T . Ly , a Vietnamese-American businessman , and had predicted he would be exonerated by the probe .</TEXT>
