   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; INFLATION NEWS RALLIES BONDS ; DOW ADDS 17</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The bond market finally got some good news on inflation , spurring a modest rally Friday as traders braced for the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s policy meeting next Tuesday . Stocks staged a more convincing rally , as takeover speculation helped power the Dow industrials up 17.81 points to 3 # 768.71. Bond yields declined broadly after the government reported that July consumer prices rose 0.3 % , which was within expectations . On Thursday , yields had rocketed on the July wholesale inflation report , which had come_in higher than expected . The 10-year Treasury_note yield , which jumped from 7.30 % on Wednesday to 7.36 % on Thursday , fell_back to 7.29 % on Friday . Two weeks ago the yield was at 7.10 % . The seesawing of interest_rates Thursday and Friday didn ' t change many traders ' minds about the likely outcome of next Tuesday ' s Fed meeting . The central_bank is widely expected to boost short-term rates again in an attempt to further slow the economy . Short-term T-bill yields were mostly unchanged on Friday , even as longer-term yields eased . James Solloway , research chief at Argus Research , said Friday ' s consumer inflation report might sway the Fed to limit its rate hike to a quarter-point instead of a half-point . But many other market players are convinced the Fed will use a half-point increase to show it is serious about restraining inflation . Also , renewed rate increases in Europe this week , by the Swedish and Italian central_banks , could encourage the Fed to go_with a half-point rate hike to keep the dollar from heading into a new downward spiral . Across Europe Friday , bond yields continued to rise , responding to the Swedish and Italian boost in short rates on Thursday . The yield on the 10-year German government_bond hit 7.23 % Friday , highest since June 21 . European rate worries pummeled stocks on the Continent for a second day . In Frankfurt , the DAX stock index dropped 30.60 points or 1.4 % to 2 # 124.68. In Paris , the CAC index sank 31.98 points to 2 # 006.95. In London , however , stocks got a late lift with the U.S. market rally , and the FTSE-100 index added 4.1 points to 3 # 142.30. On Wall_Street , many investors appeared to be resigned to another Fed rate boost but were finding reasons to buy stocks anyway . Friday was &quot; further evidence that the market has unhinged stock prices from interest_rates , &quot; said analyst Louis Ehrenkrantz of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum . In the broad market , advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock_Exchange , on moderate volume . The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks rose 3.41 points to 731.61 , bringing its gain for the week to 1.8 % . In contrast , the Dow inched up 21.69 points or 0.6 % for the week . Technology stocks , which had led the Nasdaq market ' s comeback this week , lost some steam on Friday , but other market sectors picked_up the slack .
