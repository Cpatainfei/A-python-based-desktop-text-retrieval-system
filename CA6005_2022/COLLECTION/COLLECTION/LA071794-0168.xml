   <HEADLINE> NASA ' S GOLDIN BOY WANTS TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE ; SPACE : HE ' S OUTSPOKEN , DETERMINED AND IN CHARGE . DAN GOLDIN IS SHOOTING FOR THE STARS WITH PLANS FOR A SPACE_STATION AND A MISSION TO MARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hundreds of people clustered around the TV in the lobby of New York ' s LaGuardia Airport that Sunday in July , watching as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men to walk on the moon . Dan Goldin sat there , transfixed , as his flight to Boston left without him . Goldin was so proud to have had a small part in Apollo 11 . His company built the engine of the lunar lander that carried the astronauts to the surface that day -- July 20 , 1969 . He made a pact with himself right there : Someday , somehow , he would be part of a Mars mission . Today , 25 years later , Goldin has that chance . Twenty-seven years ago , Goldin , then a junior engineer , left NASA for TRW Inc. He ' s back , but now he ' s in_charge of the entire space agency -- and battling the bureaucracy that drove him away . NASA ' s candid and controversial chief of two years is rocking the agency ' s boat hard , to the disgust of many old-timers . He ' s ousted longtime officials , rearranged the hierarchy , cut the work_force , shaved the budget , insisted on &quot; faster , better , cheaper , &quot; fought for Russian participation in the planned space_station and , at least for now , won . Apollo 16 commander John Young , who holds the record with six space flights , says that despite his rough edges , Goldin ' s heart is in the right place . Apollo 10 commander Thomas Stafford , who circled the moon but never landed , considers Goldin the best NASA administrator since Jim Webb , who laid the foundation for Apollo during the 1960s . John Pike , head of the Federation of American Scientists ' space policy project , also is impressed . &quot; Walks on water , &quot; Pike said of Goldin . &quot; He ' s been extremely effective in formulating a post-Cold War political rationale for NASA that does not require industrial-strength mendacity. &quot; Nominated by President Bush and retained by President Clinton , Goldin is receiving much of the credit for last month ' s stunningly large House victory for the space_station . It was the 15th time he ' d had to weather a space_station vote_in Congress . All these votes are &quot; enough to make you want to puke , &quot; he blurted publicly last spring . He admits he got carried_away that day , but quickly asks , &quot; Doesn ' t it bother you ? &quot; If he ' s blunt at times , even brash , then so be it . &quot; As Popeye says , I y ' am what I y ' am , &quot; Goldin said during an interview in his large , top-floor office at NASA headquarters in Washington . &quot; I haven ' t changed , &quot; he insisted . &quot; I decided I would be myself , and that I will do the very best I can . I don ' t know if I can try harder , because I put_in a good 15-hour day . I was doing_it seven days a week and I now have it down to 5 1 / 2. &quot; Goldin , who turned 54 this month , eased his maniacal schedule so he could train for a triathlon -- a swimming , biking and running competition . Unfortunately , a bicycle accident in late April wrecked his training plans . For Goldin , who just never seems to stop , it ' s NASA versus the NFL , space research versus taco chips and beer . &quot; We are talking_about $ 14 billion out of a $ 5.5-trillion economy , &quot; he said of NASA ' s budget . &quot; Give me a break ! One-hundred-forty million people now watch the Super Bowl . I don ' t want to demean professional_football , but is that what life ' s about ? &quot; We consume taco chips and we consume beer . We have to have two cars and sometimes three . We have to have vacation_homes . How come people don ' t criticize those that have three cars and two vacation_homes , yet they say , ' How come when people are starving you go and do a space_program ? ' It rips my heart out. &quot; And he ' s just warming_up . &quot; I ' m not worried about the space_program . I ' m worried about America , &quot; Goldin said . &quot; Our nation has become a nation of consumption . Entertainment and recreation are the most important things for the future . God help us ! &quot; Goldin became interested in space while growing_up in the_Bronx . His Uncle Joe taught him how to build model airplanes and rocket ships , and he devoured science_fiction . After college in 1962 , Goldin applied for a job at NASA ' s Lewis Research_Center in Cleveland , because it was working_on a mission to Mars . TRW lured him away in 1967 , and he soon was managing secret military spacecraft programs . Goldin was vice_president and general_manager of TRW Space and Technology Group in Redondo Beach when Bush offered him NASA ' s top job in March , 1992 . Ex-astronaut Richard Truly had been pressured to resign by the White_House ; he ' d helped to lead NASA back from disaster after the 1986 Challenger explosion , but refused to go_along with changes to reform NASA ' s old_boy network . Goldin was considered the medicine NASA needed . Within months , George_Bush was out and Bill_Clinton was in . Goldin prepared to leave , but was asked by the incoming Administration to &quot; hang_in there &quot; -- one of the few agency heads who survived the sea change in administrations . He stayed , even though he says it cost him millions in pay and real_estate investments . He harbors frustrations , but no regrets . &quot; Every day I wake_up and I say , ' There are thousands of millions of very rich people and executives , but I ' m only the ninth NASA administrator. ' I have_the_best job , because if you ' re the NASA administrator during good times , you ' re not being tested. &quot; Goldin is being tested all_right . When he took_over NASA , for example , he was shocked to learn there was no single person in_charge of the crucial Hubble Space Telescope repair mission . He put Randy Brinkley at the helm and ordered extra training and practice spacewalks . The result was last December ' s spectacularly successful mission and , universally , the praise was for the training that preceded it . Brinkley is now managing the international space_station program office . Goldin ' s overriding concern , for now , is keeping the station on track ; construction in orbit is supposed to start in 1997 . Once the station is completed in 2002 , Goldin said , it will be time to plan international expeditions to the moon , Mars , maybe even an asteroid . &quot; I made a pact with myself , so I can ' t back_off , &quot; he said . &quot; Now , I accept the fact that maybe there may be a higher priority for human_beings to go_to places other_than Mars . But my deepest dream is that in my lifetime I will some way be responsible_for a mission to Mars . It would be the next noble thing that we could do as a society. &quot; The last noble thing was Apollo . Twenty-five long years ago .</TEXT>
