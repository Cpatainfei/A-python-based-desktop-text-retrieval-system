   <HEADLINE> APARTMENT LIFE : CHECKLIST FORMS AVAILABLE FOR RENTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : I am a renter and I live_in Tustin . In your July 3 column , under the question titled &quot; Using Move-In Checklist Avoids Move-Out Woes , &quot; you recommended that owners and renters alike use inventory checklists before moving_into apartments to determine the condition of everything inside them . You also mentioned in the column that the Apartment Assn . of Greater Los Angeles ( AAGLA ) produces such a form . I understand that AAGLA is an apartment owners ' service group , but getting such a from is immensely important to me as a renter . Is there any way you can send me a copy of the form ? ANSWER : Although AAGLA is a membership organization that generally dispenses forms only to its members , as a public_service for the next 30 days , renters may pick_up copies of AAGLA ' s Inventory Checklist form ( one per person ) at any of AAGLA ' s three Los Angeles County offices . The offices are at 621 S . Westmoreland Ave. , Los Angeles ( 213 ) 384-4131 ; 12012 Wilshire Blvd. , West L.A. ( 310 ) 820-7651 ; 17707 Crenshaw Blvd. , Suite 210 , Torrance ( 310 ) 532-9245 . The Westmoreland Avenue office is open from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. , Monday through Friday . The West L.A. and South Bay offices are open the same hours , except they are closed from noon-1 p.m. for lunch . What Is Policy on Credit-Checking Fees ? Q : For the past six years , I have been a summer tenant at a Newport Beach apartment complex . This year , for the first time , when I paid the first month ' s rent I was asked to pay an additional $ 20 credit checking fee , which I did . Since I have a five-year record of prompt payment of rent and no problems at this complex , I am wondering whether this fee is legal or just a gimmick . If it is legal , am I entitled to a copy of my credit report ? A : Perhaps the owners of this complex have had a bad experience with a formerly good renter , or they may just be tightening their rental policies because of the recession . Either way , credit checking fees are legal and some institutions charge even more_than $ 20 for them . You are entitled to a copy of your credit report , but you must get_it directly from the credit reporting agency . The owners or managers of the complex are prohibited by law from giving it to you . However , they must provide you with the name and phone_number of the credit reporting agency from which they got the report , which must provide you with a copy of the report upon your written request . He ' s Off Deep End Over Pool Changes Q : I live_in Fullerton and I have a problem . The main reason I moved_into this apartment about a year ago was for the large swimming_pool areas it provided me and my guests . Unfortunately , after this privilege was abused by a_few occupants whose guests had small children , the pool rules were drastically altered by the management . Now , no guests are allowed_in the pool and the hours have been shortened . Why should adults be punished for the transgressions of children ? Even though the hours on the pool sign were changed to the new ones , it still reads &quot; 2 guests per apartment. &quot; Does that matter ? A : I am assuming that you were given a written notice of the pool rule changes , so it would be difficult to argue that you were confused by the unchanged poolside sign , which could be altered by the management anyway . As you say in your letter , the pool &quot; . . . privilege was abused by a_few occupants whose guests had small children ; &quot; while the apartment ' s management might have found a better solution to the problem , the one they found seems to be legal and rational . Interest on Security_Deposit Is Overdue Q : I lived_in a West Los Angeles apartment for two years before moving to Alexandria , Va. , earlier this year . When I left I asked the owner if he owed me any interest on my security_deposit , he said that law was no longer effective . A friend ' s mother inquired about the interest on my behalf . She was told that the law , passed in November , 1990 , is still in_effect and that it requires 5 % interest payments on security_deposits . When I got my deposit refund there was , of course , no interest payment included . I have notified the owner several times by certified mail that he owes me the money , over $ 100 , but he refuses to even respond to my requests for payment . If I have to come_to L.A. to sue in Small Claims Court to recover the interest , can I also get the cost of air fare , hotel accommodations , lost wages and so forth ? A : The Los Angeles City Interest on Deposits law is still in_effect for rent-controlled rental properties in the city . If you had a $ 1 # 000 security_deposit for two years with the owner , he owes you $ 100 in interest for that . And while you generally cannot recover lost wages , travel and housing costs in Small Claims Court , the court can penalize an owner $ 600 for the &quot; bad faith &quot; retention of a security_deposit , of which the interest would seem to be a part . Sending the owner a copy of this column , with a written request for payment of the interest owed , and subsequently not being paid , might prove your &quot; bad faith &quot; claim in court , which may pay_for your air fare and lodging . What ' s Easiest Way to Evict Two Lodgers ? Q : I live_in Dana Point and I read your May 15 column in which you told how easy it is for a homeowner to rid himself of a lodger when there is only one on the premises because of a special law . My question is how does that law apply to a homeowner who has two lodgers in his home ? A : It doesn ' t . As I emphasized in the previous column , &quot; this remedy only applies to lodgers in owner-occupied dwellings where there is only one lodger / tenant. &quot; Where there is more_than one lodger / tenant , you must evict a renter just like a residential renter in an apartment_building .</TEXT>
