   <HEADLINE> GREEK ACTRESS , POLITICIAN MELINA MERCOURI DIES AT 70 ; FILMS : FAMOUS FOR HER ' NEVER ON SUNDAY ' ROLE , LUNG_CANCER CLAIMS FIRST WOMAN TO HOLD A SENIOR CABINET POST IN ATHENS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Melina Mercouri , the throaty actress who rocketed to international fame as the good-hearted prostitute Illya in &quot; Never on Sunday &quot; and went_on to become Greece ' s passionate minister of culture , died Sunday in New York . She was believed to be 70 . Mercouri , a heavy smoker who had been treated for lung_cancer for the last five years , died of the disease . She underwent surgery last month to remove a tumor on her lung and slipped into a coma Saturday at New York ' s Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center . The first woman to hold a senior Cabinet post in Greece , Mercouri served as culture minister from 1981 to 1989 and returned to the post last October , when Andreas Papandreou ' s Socialist government resumed power . &quot; Greece today mourns the death of Melina , a brave fighter , an important artist , a wonderful human being , &quot; Prime_Minister Papandreou said . &quot; It laments the loss of a woman who through her art and her struggles made her name one with the name of Greece. &quot; One of Mercouri ' s most ardent campaigns was for the return to Athens of the famous Elgin Marbles , priceless statues removed from the Parthenon in the early 19th Century and housed in the_British Museum . &quot; I will never stop on the Elgin Marbles , &quot; the fiery , green-eyed Mercouri declared last month . &quot; The marbles are part of a monument to Greek identity , part of the deep consciousness of the Greek people -- our roots , our continuity , our soul . The Parthenon is like our flag , &quot; she told The Times in 1983 after personally viewing the historic statuary in London . &quot; If you ask me will I be alive when they come_back , &quot; she said in 1988 , &quot; yes , I will be alive . And if I ' m not alive , I will be reborn. &quot; Mercouri herself became something of a monument to Greek identity because of her remarkable political accomplishments and her successes on the stage and screen . Her 1960 film &quot; Never on Sunday , &quot; by American director Jules Dassin , her husband , established the actress as a prototypal Greek and was credited with launching tides of tourists toward Greece . The film won her the Best Actress Award at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award nomination for what Variety termed &quot; a brilliant execution of a larger-than-life character. &quot; Ironically , Mercouri was reluctant to take_on the role of the hedonistic harlot who teaches a priggish American male tourist , played by Dassin , about life . &quot; I always thought_of myself as a tragic -- a serious -- actress , &quot; she said at the time . &quot; I was sure I would n ' t know how to go_about playing comedy. &quot; Born into a wealthy Athens political family on Oct . 18 in years listed by various biographies as 1922 , 1923 or 1925 , Mercouri was christened Melina for the Greek word meli , or honey . The name was given to her by her devoted grandfather , who was mayor of Athens for three decades . Her father was a legislator and interior minister . When her family objected to her interest in acting , at age 17 she married the wealthy older Athenian businessman Panayiotis Harokopos to escape their control . She enrolled in the Academy of the National Theater , where she spent three years studying classical_Greek tragedy . Her marriage ended after a_few years . Mercouri began her career on stage , earning prominence with her role in Eugene O ' Neill ' s &quot; Mourning Becomes Electra. &quot; She made her film debut in 1954 in the title_role of &quot; Stella &quot; by the Greek director Michael Cacoyannis , which won her the Best Actress Award at Cannes in 1955 . Mercouri met Dassin at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival and began their long professional and personal partnership . Their first film was &quot; He Who Must Die , &quot; in which she had the role of Mary Magdalene . The couple , who married in 1966 , went_on to &quot; Never on Sunday , &quot; then &quot; Phaedra &quot; in 1962 and &quot; Topkapi &quot; in 1964 . Although she disdained Hollywood , Mercouri made scores of films in Greece , France , Italy , Spain and the United States and graced stages throughout Europe and America . Among her other films were &quot; A Man Could Get Killed &quot; in 1966 , &quot; Promise at Dawn &quot; in 1970 and &quot; Once Is Not Enough &quot; in 1975 . Mercouri swung from entertainment back to her political roots in 1967 , when a junta took_over Greece . Vociferously joining the resistance , she was stripped of her citizenship and her property and spent the next seven years living_in exile in Paris and New York . Within 48 hours after the junta was toppled in July , 1974 , Mercouri was back in Greece . She helped to found Papandreou ' s Panhellenic Socialist Movement . She is survived by her husband , Dassin .</TEXT>
