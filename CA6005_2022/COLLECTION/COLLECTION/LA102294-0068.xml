   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; WILSON , BROWN STYLES BELIE WHO ' S LEADING IN THE POLLS ; POLITICS : IN LAST STAGES OF THE CAMPAIGN , HE SEEMS A CONCERNED CHALLENGER , SHE A FREEWHEELING FRONT-RUNNER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kathleen Brown had just finished the latest broadside against her opponent for governor when the voice of a television_reporter came wafting toward her . &quot; Governor Brown , &quot; the reporter said , mistakenly substituting her name for Pete Wilson ' s . &quot; Gov . Brown ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! &quot; exulted the Democratic candidate , thrusting her arm dramatically skyward with each exclamation . &quot; I ' ve been called a lot of things in this campaign , &quot; Brown said , then indulged in a comedian ' s pause . &quot; And I like that one. &quot; In the last and longest stage of the campaign , where nerves are frayed to shreds , sleep usually comes only fleetingly and the pressure of always being_on can seem unbearable , Kathleen Brown is loose . Somewhere along the path to Election_Day , she cast_off the shroud of public caution that she has draped around herself most of her life . With less than three weeks to go before judgment , she is belting_out her message with a verve unseen even a_few months ago . If polls are to be believed -- and the consultants and managers on both sides do believe them -- Republican Wilson is substantially ahead in his race for a second term . And the Democratic state_treasurer , as the numbers have it , has watched a double-digit lead hurtle earthward , leaving her struggling for money and attention . But never , if you saw Wilson and Brown out_in public as their hard-fought campaign wrenches toward conclusion , would their actions betray the political realities . Wilson comes_across not so_much a confident front-runner as a concerned challenger . Brown comes_across not so_much a desperate challenger as a freewheeling front-runner . Campaign style frequently , of course , bears little similarity to the outcome . This year , in this race , it may be less a reflection of their comparative standing than a window on their public personas . If Wilson is behaving as though he is taking nothing for granted , Brown is acting like she has nothing to lose . * Out on the stump , the tradition of public handshaking and speechmaking seems almost quaint now , like fist-to-fist combat conducted under a sky filled with media smart bombs . It might look impressive but have little impact , so it is easy to dismiss . But campaigning is an art_form , and on this day Brown is an artist . In the computer-filled graphic design classrooms at Pasadena High_School , she is gliding through_with her entourage of four , all scattered by teen-agers who are looking_at her curiously . What she seems to be , to them , is a hip mom , quietly supportive of a student whose computer literacy abandons him under pressure , able to converse brightly about the advantages of a software program whose headquarters she has previously toured . &quot; It ' s scary , it ' s so good , &quot; says Brown , whose own computer_guru comes_in the form of her son Zeb , who is not much older than these students . She turns_to one with a grin that seems suddenly wicked . &quot; You can really do some things that could be dangerous. &quot; Hers is not a campaign that has seemed dangerous ; for most of its tenure the Brown effort has labored under the perhaps unfair expectation that she was a gold-plated candidate capable of beating the stuffing out of a man who is perennially California ' s most underrated pol . As the gap widened between that potential and reality , both the effort and Brown have seemed occasionally erratic . And now , as with all campaigns behind in the final weeks , the rumors circle like buzzards . She ' s broke . ( Campaign aides say there is enough money to be competitive , if not enough to match Wilson. ) The campaign is in disarray . ( Campaign aides say events are being changed hurriedly sometimes , but only to take_advantage of political developments ) . Brown has been considered down for the count long enough that it comes as something of a surprise when she walks into a Pasadena classroom and delivers a punchy , crisp speech that matches assaults on Wilson with glimpses of_her_own vision of California . There is nothing , though , that could prepare the gathered students for Brown ' s sudden left turn from the subject of welfare reform to the topic of teen-age pregnancy . Specifically , Brown ' s own . She asks how many of the 50 or so students have a friend who is a teen-age parent . Every one of them raises a hand , and Brown looks stricken . &quot; Let me tell you , I was almost a teen-age parent , &quot; she says quietly . &quot; I got_married when I was 19 years old . I had my first child four days after my 20th birthday . I had every advantage to have in life . I had a great family , I was married , I had finished high_school . I had a year and a half , two years of college under my belt . &quot; And my life changed . My life changed . And I think_about teen-agers who don ' t have those advantages . We have to help our kids understand that they have the power and the skills to change their lives . To take_control of their lives. &quot; By the time she finishes , with a plea to the students for help , not a sound can be heard . * If Brown is buoyant and verges on the effervescent in her public dealings , Wilson carries with him the almost visible weight of office . Wrinkles of worry crease his forehead . The relative conviviality that marked his 1990 campaign , when he was running as the &quot; compassionate conservative , &quot; has faded , replaced with a reserve . But he is not too far out of the old focus , and that stability is the secret of Wilson ' s success . His self-deprecating , wry humor is still present . He never gets too excited when things are going well , never too aggravated when they are going poorly . Always , he is the personification of the even keel . This day , Wilson blends_in perfectly with the blue-clad sea of business owners gathered_in the warehouse of a Hollywood plant . He is distinguishable from those who have gathered_in his support only by the gentlemen around him with conspicuous earpieces and wrist walkie-talkies . It is the first of three back-to-back , business-oriented events , and Wilson is demonstrating why , even if the conversation seems acutely arcane to outsiders , he is the business owners ' candidate . Stilted economic argot drips off his tongue . He boasts of reinstituting the &quot; small business net operating loss carry-forward , &quot; which is accounting talk for writing_off losses in future years when a business is profitable . Better that , he says , than Brown ' s tax moratorium plan that would take_effect in early years when many businesses earn little taxable income . He chides Brown for opposing the North_American Free_Trade Agreement and for endorsing health_care plans that require employers to finance their workers ' insurance . And he saves most of his firepower not for the big issues of the campaign , like crime or immigration , but for precisely what many of the people here want to discuss : workers ' compensation . &quot; We had first to set right what was wrong , &quot; he said . &quot; . . . . It was a national disgrace . We were able to bring_about reform. &quot; But there is little of the personal Wilson on display ; indeed , apart from mentioning a grandfather who was a police_officer shot dead before Wilson was born , or introducing his wife , Gayle , the governor rarely treads into personal territory . Where Brown innately prefers the emotional connection , Wilson treasures toughness . Nonetheless , he tailored his campaign spiel ever so slightly in recent days , since their recent debate clash on crime . The treasurer essentially accused Wilson of having no clue as_to what it was like to be a woman or a mother concerned about societal violence . For years , Wilson ' s campaign speeches have been laced with a lament about fear faced by women who have to walk across a darkened parking_lot or wait alone at a bus bench . The new version appeared to be insurance that he could connect himself -- as had Brown -- to the electorate ' s fear of crime . And it was telling , since for much of the campaign Brown has been the one tailoring her remarks to her opponent . &quot; It is wrong , &quot; he said , &quot; when a husband has to worry about his wife walking to her car at a day ' s end or walking to a bus_stop . . . . I see a California where we change that. &quot;</TEXT>
