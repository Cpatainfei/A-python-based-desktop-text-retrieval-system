   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA CONSIDERS SMOKING BAN ; LEGISLATION : PROPOSAL WOULD PROHIBIT LIGHTING UP AT MOST WORKPLACES BUT NOT AT RESTAURANTS AND BARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Smoking would be banned at most workplaces but could continue at restaurants and bars as long as the establishment ' s policy is posted for customers , under a newly crafted city ordinance . Santa Clarita City_Council members worked_out provisions for a new tobacco control ordinance Tuesday night and will vote on it at their May 24 session . The proposed ordinance also bans cigarette vending_machines , but allows smoking in small businesses operated away from the public and ventilated separately from other firms . The proposed smoking ban is less restrictive than what the council approved in December but stubbed_out before the law took_effect . The earlier version banned smoking in all enclosed public areas , except bars that derive only one-fourth of their income from food sales . &quot; I just don ' t think we have the ability to enforce something that strict , &quot; said Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy . Ban supporters say people ' s health is at stake , while opponents say it ' s a question of personal freedoms and that merchants should be able to set their own smoking policies . Council_members have been flooded with data , statistics and arguments from advocates on both sides since the issue was raised late last year . Some council_members said it was hard to sift through conflicting claims , and others said they believed the issue was being driven by activists who neither live nor work in the Santa Clarita area . &quot; I think a significant amount of people have lied_about this , &quot; said Councilman Carl Boyer . &quot; I don ' t think 95 % of the people in the valley give_a_hoot , really. &quot; Councilman Clyde Smyth called the modified ordinance a compromise . &quot; I don ' t know ( about this ) . I have no idea in the world with the mishmash of statistics I have seen , &quot; Smyth said . &quot; I haven ' t done anything to help my friends that are bartenders or waitresses , but I think ( this ordinance ) is something I can live with. &quot; Mayor George Pederson opposed the ordinance as written , calling smoking a &quot; life-and-death &quot; issue and urging stronger restrictions . He said nonsmoking restaurants would n ' t suffer because customers go_for good food and service and not for their smoking policy . If approved , the ordinance will take_effect in mid-July . Santa Clarita ' s draft ordinance came one day after the Philip Morris tobacco company announced it had enough signatures to create a California ballot measure abolishing local smoking bans . City leaders were concerned that a stronger ban might trigger costs for Santa Clarita businesses , only to then be repealed .</TEXT>
