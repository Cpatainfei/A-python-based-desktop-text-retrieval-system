   <TEXT> The place looks_like little more_than an abandoned work site now . On a windy winter day , the heavy smell of damp earth rises from the ground . And amid an array of metal storage trailers , the landscape is dotted with piles of loosened dirt . It wasn ' t always that way . Once , archeologists believe , this 7.4-acre site near the Bolsa Chica wetlands was a large village teeming with the life and culture of an ancient civilization . There , men and women , they say , spent significant portions of their lives doing the things that people have always done to survive . In recent years , in fact , the site has become what many describe as one of the richest archeological digs_in the state , yielding an abundance of important Native_American artifacts . Among them are hundreds of &quot; cog stones &quot; -- gear-like objects , the purpose of which remains a mystery . And two years ago , scientists unearthed several human-bone fragments purported to be about 8 # 000 years old , including a portion of a skull bearing a human-bored hole . &quot; It ' s a very important site , &quot; said Patricia Martz , a professor of anthropology at Cal State Los Angeles , and chairwoman of the state Historical Resources Commission . &quot; It ' s one of the very few we have from that time period. &quot; The rub is that the place is smack in the middle of a controversial proposal for a multimillion-dollar development that would put 4 # 286 new homes near the wetlands . Thus the recent discovery , while delighting archeologists , has put the project at the center of a furious debate that has some City_Council members calling_for a grand_jury investigation . At issue : Did the Koll Real_Estate Group , which owns the property , properly handle and report the discovery of the bones , or did_it try to cover_up the find to safeguard building plans ? The argument has drawn environmentalists and politicians already opposed to the project , archeologists with academic interests , state bureaucrats with laws to uphold and various factions of Native_Americans . On Saturday morning , about 60 angry Native_Americans staged a protest on the steps of Huntington Beach City_Hall . &quot; We will not be manipulated and intimidated , &quot; said Jim Velasques , chief of the coastal Gabrieleno Shoshone tribe and one of the protest ' s organizers . &quot; No more secrecy in a closed room ; we want to know what ' s going_on out there. &quot; Although officials say that the controversy is unlikely to derail the project entirely , it already has resulted in calls within the Huntington Beach City_Council for a court injunction against the developer as well as the grand_jury investigation . A recent hearing on the proposed development drew 600 residents . Lucy Dunn , senior_vice_president of the Koll Group , said , &quot; We ' ve abided_by the law and followed all procedures. &quot; The controversy began last month when opponents of the project leaked to the press an internal memo written by a forensic anthropologist hired by the Orange County coroner ' s office to examine the bones found at the site in 1992 . In the memo , Judy Myers Suchey , a faculty_member at Cal State Fullerton , described the bones as &quot; very old , approximately 8 # 000 years , &quot; and therefore of serious interest to archeologists . Dunn acknowledged Saturday that a number of other bones were found earlier at the site , but said she couldn ' t comment on their scientific importance . What angered project opponents was that no mention of the 1992 find had been made in the county ' s draft environmental impact report on the project released late last year . &quot; It ' s a significant omission , &quot; said Flossie Horgan , president of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust , which opposes the development on environmental grounds . &quot; Our major concern is credibility. &quot; According to those involved in the process , the omission resulted primarily from bureaucratic delays . Koll company officials say that they reported the existence of the bones to the coroner ' s office -- as required by law -- in June , 1992 , shortly after determining that the remains were human . A spokesman for the coroner ' s office could not confirm that date , but said that he was unaware of any attempt by the company to skirt the law . &quot; They have cooperated fully , &quot; Jim Beisner , chief deputy coroner , said of the Koll company ' s efforts . And Tom Mathews , director of planning for the county ' s Environmental Management Agency which oversaw preparation of the environmental impact report , said the latest archeological finds at Bolsa Chica were not mentioned in the document because studies to determine their scientific significance had not yet been completed . &quot; I ' m not going_to put a letter from Judy Suchey to the coroner &quot; in the environmental impact report , Mathews said . &quot; that ' s not a report ; it ' s her opinion , and I want to see how this information is interpreted by the scientific community. &quot; A report on the bones being prepared by Nancy Whitney-Desautels , a state-certified archeologist hired by the Koll company , is expected to be released well in_advance of the county Board of Supervisors ' vote on the environmental impact report next fall , Mathews said . If she concludes that the Bolsa Chica bones are scientifically significant , Mathews said , that information will be included in the final impact report to be used as a basis for future decisions on issuing construction permits . &quot; It could significantly modify the project , &quot; Mathews said , adding that the developers conceivably could be forced to build around the archeological site , which constitutes only a small portion of the proposed 400-acre construction zone . Such assurances , however , did little to mollify critics , some of whom have said they believe that the Koll company may have engaged in a cover-up . At a recent city hearing attended by 600 residents , in fact , those suspicions found voice in a motion by City Councilman Ralph Bauer , who requested a temporary restraining order against further disturbance of the site and calling_for a grand_jury investigation into the company ' s handling of the archeological finds . &quot; To me this is really significant , &quot; said Councilman David Sullivan , who seconded the motion . &quot; Is the Koll company following the law ? How much did they know about the significance of this site when they just went_on doing their excavations ? &quot; The motion was eventually tabled while the city ' s staff prepares a report on its legal ramifications . The matter is expected to be decided in about two weeks . In the meantime , a new group of protesters has entered the fray : Native_Americans who say they have been kept_in the dark regarding the discovery and disposition of the bones of their ancestors . The company has employed several Native_American monitors since the project ' s beginnings . Recommended by various archeologists involved in the project , the three monitors , each representing a specific tribal group , have been_on hand during all_of the excavations at the site and subsequent discussions regarding the findings . Recently , however , another group -- identified by the state ' s Native_American Heritage Commission as the most likely descendants of the individuals whose remains were discovered at Bolsa Chica -- have challenged the right of the Koll-employed monitors to act_on their behalf . &quot; They don ' t speak_for us , &quot; Velasques said . So instead of accepting a recent invitation by the Koll company to meet for a discussion on the disposition of their ancestors ' remains , the group staged a protest Saturday morning . The protesters -- a_few bearing signs such_as &quot; No Development ; Respect Native_Americans &quot; -- listened to speeches denouncing the proposed project before watching a lively dance put_on by a troupe of Aztecs from Los Angeles . &quot; The greed has got_to stop , &quot; said Cindi Alvitre , a Gabrieleno and director of a Native_American maritime cultural society in Long_Beach . &quot; Who gave them the right to rape my ancestors ? We are demanding an investigation of the crimes imposed on my people by the Koll company . Leave the land alone ! &quot; Archeologists , meanwhile , say they are eager to begin learning the lessons that the land may have to teach . Among those lessons : What did these early Californians eat , what was their stature , how long did they live , what sort of medical problems did they have and were they rich or poor ? &quot; This could fill a gap in our knowledge , &quot; said Constance Cameron , curator of the Museum of Anthropology at Cal State Fullerton . &quot; When you haven ' t had the remains to study , you don ' t know much. &quot; With development inching closer , however , the time may be short . &quot; Once this site is gone , &quot; she said , &quot; it ' s gone . It ' s a non-renewable resource. &quot;</TEXT>
