   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / JOSE DE LA TORRE : INTERNATIONAL FINANCE HAS BECOME THE DOG-WAGGING TAIL OF ' 90S</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> World financial markets once again have suffered a bad case of the jitters . Large speculative flows are pushing interest_rates up and causing exchange_rates to bounce about with increased volatility . For most of us who work in the &quot; real &quot; economy , the resulting changes in relative prices and demand can have serious repercussions . Those seeking someone to blame have an ample choice of villains : Alan Greenspan for reining_in the U.S. economy too soon , the German Bundesbank for acting selfishly , the Japanese for their indecision , or George Soros and other &quot; hedge_funds &quot; operators who -- having bet wrongly on the direction of interest_rates and bond prices -- are scurrying to cover their huge exposed positions . The fact is , we live_in a new_world of international finance that is scarcely a decade old . As recently as 1984 , financial markets remained essentially domestic . Since then , new telecommunications and information technologies -- coupled with advances in financial theory , radical innovation in financial products and a universal process of market deregulation -- have transformed financial markets dramatically . The 1984 dollar-yen agreement allowed Japanese investors greater access to foreign markets and removed barriers to yen convertibility . The Plaza Accord of 1985 encouraged a trend toward market-opening measures throughout the industrialized world . The deregulation of London ' s securities market -- the Big Bang of 1986 -- was followed by similar , if less dramatic , actions in other European capitals , as well as in many emergent markets . The combined effects of these forces can be illustrated by a_few key figures : * Market capitalization of the world ' s major stock_exchanges grew from $ 1.7 trillion in 1978 to $ 10.6 trillion in 1993 , increasing significantly the world ' s stock of risk_capital . * Cross-border trading in corporate equities has grown from about $ 120 billion in 1979 to $ 1.3 trillion in 1992 . * Transactions involving foreign securities listed in domestic markets boomed from less than $ 50 billion in 1979 to nearly $ 900 billion in 1990 . On Wall_Street alone , trading in the American Depository Receipts of foreign firms went from 1.3 billion shares_in 1985 to more_than 5 billion in 1992 . * The share of U.S. initial_public_offerings abroad increased from 1.4 % in 1985 to 19.3 % in 1992 . * In spite of the near collapse of international lending to developing countries following the 1982 debt crisis , the international portfolios of major banks have grown dramatically during the decade . From 1980 to 1992 , the stock of international loans ballooned from $ 324 billion to $ 7.5 trillion . * And the market in derivatives -- which barely existed before 1980 -- grew to nearly $ 9 trillion by 1992 , much of that in interest and currency swaps . Thus , one in every five transactions in equity markets today involves cross-border trading . Such investors are estimated to own 10 % of world equities , a proportion that will rise to 15 % to 20 % by the end of the decade . Financial transactions with foreigners have grown by a factor of 10 or more for all major industrial economies since the early 1980s . There is no denying that freer international capital markets have functioned precisely as expected , leveling differences in the return on -- and therefore in the cost of -- capital between similar risks . No longer can U.S. companies complain that Japanese or German firms have access to cheaper capital . But these developments pale in comparison to the explosion that has characterized foreign_exchange markets in recent years . From an annual volume of roughly $ 18 trillion in 1979 , foreign_exchange transactions doubled to about $ 35 trillion by 1984 . Thereafter , the rate_of_growth only accelerated , with current estimates citing a daily volume of more_than $ 1.2 trillion , the equivalent of 5 % of the world ' s total production of goods and services . To put it in perspective , the ratio of transactions in foreign_exchange to those in international trade_in goods and services increased during the decade from just above 8 to 1 to more_than 80 to 1 . The determination of real exchange_rates , and therefore cost competitiveness , is increasingly divorced from underlying fundamentals in the real sectors of the economy . Large variations in effective exchange_rates , often 30 % to 40 % above or below &quot; parity &quot; rates , can be sustained for five years or more ; witness the persistent overvaluation of the dollar from 1981 to 1985 and its subsequent undervaluation since 1991 . These long swings in currency values have been accompanied by increased volatility in foreign_exchange rates . As governments manipulate financial variables for domestic purposes , massive flows of short-term capital act to exploit any opportunity for gain . Exporters and importers are caught in the vise . How can business escape this dilemma ? Given the high cost of short-term hedging and the imperfections of longer-term instruments , one solution is to balance a company ' s costs and revenue within broadly defined areas tied to a particular currency -- the dollar or yen or mark -- where greater stability exists . Companies need not make everything they sell within each area ; rather , they can simply manage manufacturing and procurement activities in such a way that they match regional revenues . Currency swings between areas can be handled by building flexibility at the margin -- that is , with excess capacity and short-term sourcing contracts . Caterpillar , the U.S. heavy-equipment maker , seems to have engineered just such flexibility into its operations . In 1980 , some 80 % of its goods were produced in the United States , though America already accounted_for less than 50 % of sales . By 1991 , U.S. production had dropped to 60 % of the company ' s total . And over the decade , Caterpillar almost doubled its use of parts and supplies from non-U.S. sources , boosting those purchases to 45 % of its total . By contrast , Cat ' s Japanese competitor Komatsu -- which continued to rely predominantly on domestic production -- was seriously exposed to a loss of competitive position as the yen rose . That forced Komatsu to acquire U.S. production , in the form of a joint_venture with Dresser Industries in 1988 . Managers need not despair . One cannot change this brave new_world of electronic financial manipulation . But one can avoid its worst consequences by following a prudent policy of market and production diversification .</TEXT>
