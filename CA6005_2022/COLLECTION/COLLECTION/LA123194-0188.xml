   <TEXT> FAMILY NEW YEAR : Some of you ever faced that New Year ' s Eve choice between a champagne night out on the town or just staying home with the kids ? In Fullerton , they want you to hit the town tonight and bring the kids with you . . . . Some 10 # 000 people are expected to count_down to the New Year at its fourth annual &quot; First Night Fullerton &quot; celebration -- downtown fireworks , music , dance , pony rides and comedy . . . . Says city spokesman Steve Wilbur : &quot; There is refuge outside the saloon doors , and that is downtown Fullerton. &quot; COUNTDOWN FEAST : You ' ve had pizza delivered to your door , or Chinese food . But how about live lobsters ? The New England Live Lobster Co . in Sunset Beach is running a special today : It will deliver live lobsters to your door for your New Year ' s Eve party -- minimum four , $ 8 to $ 20 each , depending_on size . . . . It ' s an experiment , says a spokeswoman , which will continue after today if there ' s a demand for it . Sorry : If they aren ' t delivered in 30 minutes , you do not get them free . FIRST_STEPS : Melissa Young , at 23 , now dances professionally with Dallas Black Dance Theater . But she wanted to say thanks to the Saint_Joseph Ballet in Santa Ana , where she spent seven years in training . . . . So she ' s returned for the holidays to teach dance to youngsters at Saint_Joseph , which is geared toward low-income youths who cannot afford ballet any other way . Says Young : &quot; It will always be a place that I can call home. &quot; MAKE THEM DO IT : Most people are pretty good about having their little ones ride in car_seats . But how about school-age children ? Are they buckling up ? . . . Local police point_out that among the new laws going_into effect Sunday is SB 2004 , which could cost the driver a $ 50 fine if passengers 4 to 12 years old are not buckled up . Before , the fine was just $ 20 . . . . Also , the car_seat rule has been clarified : Any youngsters under 40 pounds must ride in a car_seat -- regardless of_age .</TEXT>
