   <HEADLINE> ' BLINK ' S ' APPEAL AT FEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reading Kent Black ' s opening paragraph as_to the &quot; sparse crowd &quot; gathered to see the movie &quot; Blink &quot; at the closing-night ceremonies of the Palm Springs International Film Festival ( &quot; U.S. Films Not So Popular at Palm Springs Festival , &quot; Jan . 18 ) , readers would believe that because it was an American film it had no appeal_to festival-goers.What Black fails to mention is that the screening was a fund-raiser and priced at $ 35 a ticket , perhaps a prohibitive price for many . When &quot; Blink &quot; was shown the next afternoon at regular festival prices , the same theater was filled to capacity . I know , I was there and enjoyed the thriller !
