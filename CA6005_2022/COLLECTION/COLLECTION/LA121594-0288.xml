   <HEADLINE> SEC SUBPOENAS SUPERVISORS ' RECORDS ON ALL BROKER DEALINGS ; INVESTIGATION : AGENCY SPECIFICALLY SEEKS DOCUMENTS NAMING THREE MERRILL LYNCH EMPLOYEES , SOURCES SAY . IT ALSO DEMANDS MEMBERS ' TAX_RETURNS , FINANCIAL HOLDINGS AND FULL CAMPAIGN REPORTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The federal investigation into Orange County ' s bond disaster widened dramatically Wednesday when members of the Board of Supervisors were issued subpoenas seeking a broad range of records outlining their dealings with Merrill Lynch and other bond brokerages , sources close to the supervisors said . The Securities and Exchange Commission , which is investigating Merrill Lynch and at least one other brokerage that conducted bond sales that put millions of dollars into the county ' s now-soured investment pool , faxed the subpoenas to county offices late in the day . Four supervisors could not be reached for comment late Wednesday . Supervisor William G . Steiner said he was unaware of the subpoenas . An SEC spokesman declined to comment . But several sources confirmed that all five board_members had been sent subpoenas , seeking documents from January , 1993 , to the present . The subpoenas ask specifically about the supervisors ' dealings with three Merrill Lynch brokers : Michael Stamenson , Debra Harris and Duane Canaga . By Dec . 29 , the supervisors must turn_over all records of &quot; compensation or other things of_value received , &quot; as well as their federal and state income_tax_returns , one source said . The subpoenas also seek : * &quot; All documents relating to communications &quot; with the Merrill Lynch brokers &quot; or any other broker dealer or its employees. &quot; * All personal and business diaries , calendars , telephone logs , books , memos and notes and other documents . * Checking and savings account_statements . * Campaign accounts , including all campaign disclosure statements or reports including but not limited to campaign statements . * All documents related to any securities accounts held by the supervisors or members of their families . * Any gifts or loans made to them directly or indirectly . * Any tape_recordings of any conversations related to Merrill Lynch or other brokers . Harris , reached at her home_in Lafayette , Calif. , declined to comment beyond referring questions to Merrill Lynch ' s corporate headquarters . Stamenson and Canaga could not be reached for comment . But Merrill Lynch spokesman Richard T . Silverman , contacted at his home_in New Jersey , defended the firm and the brokers : &quot; We believe that Merrill Lynch acted professionally and properly in all its dealings with Orange County. &quot; The development came_on a day when anxious creditors jockeyed for a crack at Orange County ' s bankrupt investment fund , and the county ' s chief financial adviser announced that $ 1 billion of its safest remaining securities would be auctioned this morning . Former state_Treasurer Thomas W . Hayes said the auction would be the first_step toward restructuring the county ' s investments , which have dropped $ 2.02 billion -- or 27 % -- in value this year . The sale would bring_in badly needed cash for local agencies whose savings are tied_up in the fund . The crisis triggered job cutbacks for the first time , as 47 custodians , clerks and classroom aides who had begun work over the past few weeks for the Saddleback Valley Unified School District were told that Friday would be their last_day . &quot; They are all casualties from this -- no doubt about it , &quot; said Supt . Peter A . Hartman . Earlier in the day , creditors packed a U.S. Trustees hearing in Los Angeles , with representatives from schools , cities and special districts clamoring for seats on committees that will suggest how the beleaguered fund ' s remaining holdings will be divided . It was evident that there would be a struggle for spots at the front of the line . &quot; We in the schools feel we have a case for 100 cents on the dollar , and we intend to aggressively pursue that case , &quot; said Supt . James A . Fleming of the Capistrano Unified School District . In other developments Wednesday : * Health officials said that preventive services , such_as well-child care , may have to be put_on hold while other crucial public health programs -- such_as tuberculosis and AIDS services , restaurant inspections and immunizations -- take priority in the strapped county ' s spending plans . * County supervisors and community leaders called_for local_government to be pared_down and restructured in the wake of the financial crisis . Supervisor Roger R . Stanton created a task_force to consider cutbacks . &quot; The streamlining of government could be the silver_lining in this cloud , &quot; said Peer Swan , chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District . * Sources at the SEC confirmed that investigators visited Orange County in April when the investment practices of Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron became a campaign issue . They reported back to the commission ' s enforcement branch that they found the practices risky but in violation of no law and not subject_to the SEC ' s authority . * Federal Bankruptcy Judge John E . Ryan approved a plan that would allow the county to receive a $ 200-million line_of_credit from Bank of America for its day-to-day business transactions . The credit_line will allow the county to continue its normal banking practices and make_sure its checks do not bounce . * Business_leaders announced the creation of a high-powered team to help burnish Orange County ' s image and restore its financial health . Taco Bell Chairman John Martin , Fluor Chairman Leslie G . McCraw and Rockwell Chairman Donald R . Beall are expected to take active roles in a task_force being formed by the Orange County Chamber_of_Commerce &amp; Industry and the Industrial League of Orange County , which represent about 13 # 000 local companies . &quot; I don ' t know if it ' s a ' red team ' or an ' orange team ' or a crisis response team , &quot; said H . Fred Mickelson , chairman of the chamber . &quot; But we ' re going to function as a single , clear voice for business in Orange County. &quot; School Layoffs The day brought bad news for 47 temporary school workers who learned that they would be without work after Friday . Because of the financial crunch , Saddleback Valley Unified School District officials decided that they could not approve routine hiring , promotion or job extensions for those workers . &quot; We ' re hoping that before Friday something turns_around and they say , ' Hey ! You guys can continue , ' &quot; said Ronni Hughes , a district employee whose husband is a substitute janitor and was one of those laid_off . &quot; It ' s hard to take . It ' s hard to take if it ' s Christmas . It ' s hard to take if it ' s the Fourth_of_July . It ' s hard to take if it ' s Groundhog Day. &quot; The district expects to save about $ 50 # 000 a month in salaries and benefits because of the cuts , said Jennifer Huff , executive_director of personnel . She said the employees will be hired back if the district can find money in the budget . Many of the 47 employees have been working as substitutes and were told recently they would receive full-time jobs , school officials . Others had just finished their application and interview process and were awaiting rubber-stamp approval by the school_board this week . &quot; These people would have had jobs , would have had paychecks , would have been out there spending_money on Christmas_presents and now they won ' t be , &quot; said George Anderson , president of the teachers union . There also was turmoil at the U.S. Trustees office in Los Angeles as 200 people -- mostly attorneys and financial advisers representing Orange County ' s creditors -- packed a hearing that lasted much of the day . Panel Appointments As is typical of bankruptcy cases , many of the public agencies with the most money in the investment pool were eager for a place on the creditors committees . Membership provides access to the latest information and the best opportunity to represent a creditor ' s interests ; 187 agencies have money in the pool -- now valued at $ 5.4 billion -- along with youngsters whose damages from private lawsuits were deposited in the fund . Those appointed to the committees by Trustee Marcy J.K. Tiffany were representatives the Orange County Department_of_Education , the Orange County Transportation Authority , the Transportation Corridor Agencies , the Orange County Sanitation Districts , the city of Irvine , representing all_the cities in the county , and the city of Mountain View , representing municipalities outside Orange County . Tiffany said she may add further members later . At Wednesday ' s meeting , Tiffany proposed a package of cost containment measures intended to save taxpayers millions of dollars by limiting the amount_of_money collected by bankruptcy attorneys and financial advisers . Costs &quot; could clearly be astronomical &quot; without such controls , she said . &quot; Uncontrolled attorneys are probably worse than a toddler in a candy_store , &quot; Tiffany added in an interview . &quot; There ' s a public interest here . We have to control fees . Every dollar that is pulled_out for administrative costs is one less dollar that can be used to cover the very serious shortfalls that exist in this case. &quot; Even with her proposed controls , Tiffany estimated that legal and financial advisory fees would be as high as $ 30 million . Without controls those costs could skyrocket to $ 40 million , she said . Perhaps the most controversial of Tiffany ' s cost containment proposals was to urge creditors not to retain their own investment_advisers or accountants , relying instead on financial information provided by the county ' s consultants . In contentious corporate bankruptcies , creditors and debtors typically retain their own financial advisers to dig_up information to bolster their arguments before the bankruptcy judge . Normally , the debtors -- in this case Orange County and its investment fund -- are required to pay both sides ' fees . Tiffany said that having teams of consultants on both sides of the Orange County case was unnecessary because the financial interests of the county and its creditors are the same . The county has &quot; a natural desire to get as much money to the people as they can , &quot; she said . But Daniel Harrow , a bankruptcy adviser who attended Wednesday ' s meeting , said creditors need to be confident that they are getting credible financial information . &quot; They need assessments from people who are beholden to them only so they know they ' re getting good information , &quot; said Harrow , who was seeking business for his consulting firm . Tiffany also proposed that , effective immediately , legal_fees be submitted to her for review on a monthly basis . She also asked creditors to form subcommittees to represent the interests of like-minded groups , such_as school districts and cities , and suggested that those agencies pay half the subcommittee ' s legal bills , with the county itself picking_up the other half . Board Takes Action While the creditors were meeting in Los Angeles , the Orange County Board of Supervisors tried to resume normal county business . The board approved Supervisor Roger Stanton ' s proposal to create a management council to handle the day-to-day operations during the crisis , establish a &quot; strike team &quot; to review potential budget_cuts and form a committee to look_at the issue of reinventing the way county government operates . Since the county ' s financial problems surfaced , there has been a growing call_for trimming local_government . &quot; I do not believe any rational leader should expect the taxpayers of Orange County to agree to refinance a clone of the former county bureaucracy , &quot; Stanton said . &quot; I believe the restructuring of Orange County is inevitable. &quot; Bond Offer Rejected In updating plans Wednesday for unwinding the county ' s shrunken portfolio of bond holdings , Hayes -- named the county ' s financial adviser last week at the urging of Gov . Pete Wilson -- disclosed that he had received the first serious offer to buy the securities , but had turned it down . &quot; We have had an offer , &quot; Hayes said . &quot; I ' m not at_liberty to say from whom . We ' re working to get_the_best price for the bonds and other instruments in the portfolio. &quot; The county will be selling $ 1 billion of fixed-rate , non-structured securities issued by federal_government agencies -- among the less volatile of the mostly risky holdings remaining in the portfolio . Hayes said that although he wants to sell the securities as soon as possible , he does not want to make any ill-considered transactions . &quot; We ' re working to get_the_best price for the bonds and other instruments in the portfolio , &quot; Hayes said . &quot; I have 180 days to do_it . I don ' t want to pass_up any opportunities . We could have traded today , but we chose not to. &quot; A sale will be made &quot; when it ' s in the best interest of the people of Orange County , &quot; he added . But time is not on the county ' s side . &quot; It is still highly volatile , &quot; Hayes said of the $ 5.4 billion in holdings . &quot; It is still possible that the value erodes further , because we ' re in a very risky portfolio -- and that ' s why we shouldn ' t be in a risky portfolio. &quot; Still , there was speculation in the financial markets that the Federal_Reserve_Board would delay any further increase in interest_rates until January to ease the county ' s financial turmoil . The Fed has been tightening credit to fight what it considers incipient inflation . But for Orange County , each percentage_point increase in interest_rates from here on will mean a $ 300-million hit to its portfolio , county financial advisers say .
