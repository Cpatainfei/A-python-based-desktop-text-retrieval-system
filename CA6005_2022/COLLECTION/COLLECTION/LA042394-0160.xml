   <HEADLINE> FARRAKHAN ADMITS SPREADING IDEAS THAT LED TO MALCOLM X ' S SLAYING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan says Malcolm X would be &quot; so_much more valuable &quot; were he alive today , but admits helping create &quot; the atmosphere &quot; that encouraged assassins to kill the Muslim activist . In an interview that aired Friday night on ABC-TV ' s &quot; 20 / 20 , &quot; Farrakhan said he was angry with Malcolm X for splitting with Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad and publicly criticizing him . &quot; I was very angry with Malcolm for what Malcolm had done . I was hurt by his assassination , &quot; Farrakhan said . &quot; . . . But today , looking_back , Malcolm would be so_much more valuable to us alive. &quot; Malcolm X ' s widow , Betty Shabazz , said recently that she believes Farrakhan had some role in her husband ' s murder in 1965 . Farrakhan denied that , but admitted fueling anti-Malcolm sentiment with an article published in Muhammad Speaks , the Nation of Islam ' s newspaper , shortly before the assassination . That article said , in part : &quot; The die is set and Malcolm shall not escape . Such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death. &quot; &quot; Betty Shabazz never said that Farrakhan was a plotter in the death of Malcolm . But she said that Farrakhan helped to create the atmosphere , &quot; he said . &quot; And that I can agree with. &quot; Farrakhan also said he stands_by &quot; truths &quot; about Jews articulated by his former national assistant , Khallid Muhammad . Muhammad was denounced for a speech in which he called Jews &quot; bloodsuckers of the black community , &quot; and Farrakhan removed him from his job .</TEXT>
