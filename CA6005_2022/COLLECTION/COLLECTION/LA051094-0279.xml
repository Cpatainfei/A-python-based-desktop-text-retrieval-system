   <HEADLINE> A MATTER OF NAMES AND FLAGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dispute between Greece and Macedonia centers largely on Greek demands that the former Yugoslav republic change its name and stop using certain national symbols claimed exclusively by Greece . Among those symbols is the Macedonian flag , which features a yellow sunburst on a field of red . Athens maintains that Macedonia ' s refusal to comply with its demands reflects Slavic claims to parts of historic Macedonia , a large portion of which is now the northern Greek province of Macedonia . Fearing future claims on its territory , Greece has sought to further the distinction between its province and its new neighbor , which declared its independence in September of 1991 . In an effort to resolve the dispute , the European Union suggested the country adopt the name &quot; Slavic Republic of Macedonia , &quot; a suggestion both countries quickly rejected . The United Nations , meanwhile , has admitted Macedonia under the provisional name &quot; Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia , &quot; or FYROM .</TEXT>
