   <HEADLINE> ROSIE : SHE CUTS THROUGH THE RUBBLE AND TELLS IT STRAIGHT UP ; THE COMIC-TURNED-ACTRESS IS A REAL-LIFE RIZZO WHO SAYS WHAT ' S ON HER MIND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the Bristol Lounge of Boston ' s stately Four Seasons hotel , the tone is set by buttery oak walls and ceilings , gathered drapes , swirling carpets . A stone ' s throw from Boston Common and a_few blocks from the city ' s theater district , the bar-restaurant is the kind of place one reasonably might expect to see opera singer Jessye Norman reclining on a plush fireside sofa while a classic mid-February blizzard rages outside . It isn ' t the sort of joint you ' d imagine that Betty Rubble would pick for dinner . And yet , isn ' t that her high-pitched , Stone_Age cartoon laugh , spilling forth from a corner table ? &quot; Ahnnnn hnnn hnnn . Bamm-Bamm , put that down ! &quot; OK , so the voice isn ' t coming from someone with bare feet and a cave-woman cocktail_dress . But it might as well be . Rosie O ' Donnell -- adorned by the same gray sweat pants , navy_blue sweat shirt , black high-tops and zero makeup she had_on when she left theater rehearsals that day -- clearly has about as much respect for the sanctity of her posh surroundings as Dino had for Fred . The stand-up comic-turned-actress is explaining how she won her role as Betty in the upcoming &quot; Flintstones &quot; movie , and that explanation seems to require a demonstration of &quot; The Laugh. &quot; So without hesitation , apparently oblivious to the power-tie and Perrier crowd dining around her , laugh she does . Loudly . that ' s Rosie . She is one of the fastest rising personalities in the entertainment business -- movie offers by the fistful , a starring role in a revival of &quot; Grease &quot; headed for Broadway ( May 11 , after a stop in Orange County beginning Tuesday ) , best_friend to Madonna -- but she ' s having none of the Terence Trent D ' Arby Syndrome that proudly announces newcomer-with-an-attitude . During this interview , at least , she is candid , nonchalant and altogether real -- even stopping mid-sentence at one point to ask her interviewer if that is Jessye Norman across the room , then excusing herself to go meet the diva , like some wide-eyed kid running_into Roger Clemens outside Fenway Park . Between gulps of Coke and bites of gentrified Thai spring_rolls and chicken satay , O ' Donnell , 32 , chats almost nonstop on subjects that range from her own Long_Island upbringing to Tonya Harding , movie making and the allegations of pedophilia against Michael Jackson . Nothing , it seems , is off-limits . The most immediate questions : Why &quot; Grease &quot; ? Why now ? Her movie career has been humming along nicely ( &quot; Car 54 , Where Are You ? &quot; notwithstanding ) since the success of her debut in &quot; A League of Their Own &quot; in 1992 -- last year , she did &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; and &quot; Another Stakeout &quot; -- so this might not seem the best moment to take a nine-month hiatus . But with &quot; The Flintstones &quot; headed for theaters May 27 and the Garry Marshall-directed &quot; Exit to Eden &quot; targeted for summer release , O ' Donnell thinks her timing is just about perfect . &quot; I ' m done with ( the ' Grease ' tour and Broadway run ) by the end of October , so I ' ll be back making movies by November , &quot; she explains . &quot; Besides that , if you do movie after movie , the public gets sick_of you. &quot; ( She ' s on screen -- briefly -- in the current &quot; I ' ll Do Anything , &quot; the scrapped musical version of which featured a rap number with her and Woody Harrelson. ) As to why &quot; Grease &quot; specifically : well , because Tommy Tune cast her . The original musical , by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey , debuted on Broadway in 1972 ; this revival is a Tune production , directed and choreographed by Jeff Calhoun . &quot; They were looking_for a ' name ' to be one of the lead roles , and when I said I had wanted to do Rizzo , they thought that would probably work , &quot; she said . Calhoun says he first knew the casting would work when O ' Donnell brought a yo-yo to rehearsals one day , lending Rizzo an added dimension . &quot; I never in a_million years would have thought of the yo-yo , &quot; the director confessed over the phone from Seattle , where the production was camped earlier this week . &quot; I knew from that moment that we were OK. &quot; O ' Donnell has wanted to do just about any role in just about any musical on Broadway since she was old enough to memorize every line and lyric to &quot; Funny Girl &quot; ( a talent she retains , and -- in Streisand-esque comic voice -- uses periodically to punctuate interviews such_as this one ) . But she is under no delusions that she has Barbra Streisand ' s vocal chops . Or even Stockard Channing ' s , who played Rizzo in the movie version . &quot; I was never really a singer , except for maybe in the shower or something like that . But I always wanted to do_it because to me there is nothing like the thrill of going_to a Broadway show when the lights go_down and you have that orchestra in front of you . I always get goose bumps . It ' s the reason I went_into show_business in the first place. &quot; So far , she says , the reception has been warm and forgiving . &quot; The audiences have been great . Nobody is really expecting me to get_up there and be Whitney Houston . They know who I am and what I do , and I think they do expect me to be funny , and hopefully I am funny . Then the rest . . . they think , ' You know , she is all right. ' Even the critics have said , ' She ' s all_right ; she ' s not the best singer. ' Which is fine . I can take that . It ' s the truth. &quot; Actually , at least a_few critics have been less kind : Kevin Kelly , Boston Globe : &quot; She has the brazen delivery of Ethel Merman . She snaps one-liners like gum , she burps , she boogies . She has two songs . . . which she sings in an even tone but , often , with the wrong emphasis. &quot; Pamela Sommers , Washington Post : &quot; The part of Rizzo . . . is no stretch for the pasty-faced , tough-talking O ' Donnell , but the less said about her off-key , blaring singing , the better. &quot; One of the things that critics really have landed on is something that O ' Donnell herself has problems with . While she thinks the show is less about the ' 50s than it is &quot; about kids wanting to fit_in , and the awkwardness of love and loving and sexuality and allegiance to your friends , &quot; she concedes that some of the trappings of the era unfortunately come_through , including sexism , crass humor and naivete : &quot; The line I hate the most . . . I go_through this hard scene about how ( Rizzo ) thinks she is pregnant , and she ' s so upset and she cries , and then she does this song with her friends . And then five seconds later she goes , ' Good thing I got my Friend , phew ! ' Like the whole_thing is resolved because she ' s not pregnant , all_the issues . Every night that I go_out and I have to do that I think , ' Oh , God. ' I hate what I have to say. &quot; Director Calhoun defends that passage of the play , and others , pointing_out that five seconds in the theater can represent days and what may seem like too-quick resolution of complex issues could be just necessary editing . Plus , he says , there is a certain intention here to appear naive . &quot; that ' s sort of the point of doing this show , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s about a simpler time with simpler issues. &quot; * Even if some parts of the show hold_up better than others , O ' Donnell thinks the package works pretty well , especially with such cast members as Sam Harris and Billy Porter around to lend some show-stopping vocals . The camaraderie among the actors , despite grueling all-day rehearsals that have continued through the pre-Broadway tour , is unlike anything she has come_to expect on movie sets . &quot; I ' m really having a great time on this show . Because on a movie you get_to be friends with other actors , but you don ' t get_to spend every day with them . . . . This is like high_school to me . You get_to have friends and buddies and go_out after the show for a drink , and it ' s very nice. &quot; Despite a film career that invariably has seen her cast as the Everybuddy , O ' Donnell professes to have mostly missed out on that sort of thing in her youth . At about age 18 , she left her home_in Commack , N.Y. , to hit the stand-up comedy circuit . Her mother died of cancer when Rosie was 10 and , even with a sister and three brothers around , there wasn ' t much levity on the home front as she remembers it ( &quot; very Irish Catholic sort of repressed family &quot; ) . Her career had gotten_off to a now-infamous start . At 16 , she walked into a local club and delivered a killer routine lifted -- verbatim -- from an up-and-coming young comic named Jerry Seinfeld . After the other comics on the bill nearly had her dismembered for the infraction , she met with a far scarier realization : This comedy thing was going_to require her to create her own jokes . &quot; I was like ' Holy ---- , that ' s horrible . How am I going_to write material ? I ' m not a writer. ' I was so mad. &quot; Still , she stuck_with it . In 1984 , she won several episodes of &quot; Star Search &quot; ( though not the coveted grand prize ) , moved to Los Angeles and two years later found herself on the NBC series &quot; Gimme a Break. &quot; Then came emcee duties on VH-1 ' s &quot; Stand-Up Spotlight , &quot; which capitalized on the comedy boom and perhaps even precipitated its bust , allowing in-home access to some of the same routines that comics were peddling in clubs around the nation . Her leap to feature_films came when she was cast as best_friend and teammate to Madonna ' s character in &quot; A League of Their Own. &quot; The friendship ultimately extended into real_life and , both confirm , it continues today . Being a mega-star ' s pal has shown her something of the price of fame . &quot; Coming_to know ( Madonna ) and love her as a human_being brought me to a different awareness of what that kind of media image does to someone , &quot; O ' Donnell says . Superstardom is now far from something she aspires to , though she admires her friend ' s attempts to live somewhat normally in spite of it . &quot; She is recognized , but she does go places , &quot; O ' Donnell insists . &quot; I mean , we go the mall ; we go_to the movies. &quot; Madonna goes_to the mall ? &quot; Yeah , we ' ve been to the mall . It ' s not easy always , but on the whole people leave her alone in some capacity . &quot; It ' s scary , though . She ' s very , very famous. &quot; And what does Madonna have to say about her pal , Rosie ? &quot; My friendship with Rosie has nothing to do with image , &quot; the pop diva commented earlier this week . &quot; I cannot explain the mystery of what happens when you become best_friends with someone . I can only say that we are tortured by the same things , we laugh_at the same things , and I love her madly ! &quot; Curiously , neither Rosie ' s own celebrity status nor that of her famous friend has soured Rosie on the media , even the tabloid variety . She is a huge fan of court TV , &quot; Hard Copy , &quot; &quot; A Current Affair &quot; and Connie Chung interviews with plea-bargaining skaters . &quot; I ' m obsessed with all those tabloidy things . Like the Michael Jackson thing and the Menendez brothers . I was glued to court TV . Absolutely glued. &quot; And , like the tabloid media , her convictions sometimes are influenced by popular_opinion and circumstantial_evidence . For instance , she stands squarely behind most professed victims of abuse -- Lorena Bobbitt , Erik and Lyle Menendez , Michael Jackson ' s accusers -- no matter what their own crimes may be , but has no sympathy for Harding , who also reportedly was abused as a child . &quot; I totally love Nancy Kerrigan , I totally cannot stand Tonya Harding . And everyone says , ' Oh , that ' s not fair ; you don ' t know that she is guilty ' . . . I don ' t care . I ' m totally a victim of the media , and I think that ( Harding ) is a horrible person . &quot; I wanted to fly to Lillehammer just so I could be in the Boo Tonya Festival. &quot; Tongue still in cheek , she adds that because she ' s followed the case so closely , she deserves a part in whatever movie of the week comes_out of it . Her role of choice ? Harding ' s former bodyguard , burly Shawn Eckardt , who is suspected of arranging the attack on Kerrigan . As for Jackson ' s troubles , O ' Donnell -- who says she met the singer some months ago when he accompanied Elizabeth Taylor to the set of &quot; The Flintstones &quot; ( Taylor is playing Wilma Flintstone ' s mother ) -- expresses sympathy but does not entirely dismiss accusations of child molestation . &quot; It ' s such a tragedy in so many ways , &quot; she says . &quot; It forces people to look_at the issue of child_abuse and the ramifications and the implications of what happens generationally if it ' s not treated . And also what happens when someone is so famous that the people around him lose their perspective on right and wrong , and allow or condone or hide or enable behavior that ultimately kills the person . Whether it is Elvis Presley with drugs or Michael Jackson with whatever his demons are that he is struggling with , it ' s really unnerving. &quot; To those who say Jackson never could be guilty of such behavior , O ' Donnell replies somewhat indignantly : &quot; You know , they say that about priests ; they say that about people ' s fathers and their brothers and the elementary schoolteacher and the soccer coach . They say it about every man who is accused of ( child molestation ) . ' He would never . . . ' Well , guess what ? The statistics show that one out of four girls and one out five boys in the United States is molested before the age of 18 . Wake up. &quot; Prone to such candid comments , O ' Donnell is a press_agent ' s nightmare . And she knows it . &quot; It ' s very difficult , because my publicist ( Susan Geller in L.A. ) will say , ' You know , you don ' t have to tell everyone the truth. ' Because somebody asked ( early on during the ' Grease ' tour ) , ' How is it to work with Tommy Tune ? ' and I said , ' I haven ' t worked with Tommy Tune ; he was there only three days. ' Susan goes , ' Well , look_at how it looks. ' Well , it ' s the truth . What do you expect me to say ? ' It ' s great to work with Tommy ! The thing about Tommy is . . . ' You know , because I don ' t know ! &quot; Such honesty might rattle cages_in Hollywood and New York , but it also tends to endear O ' Donnell to the press , which , again , she professes to resent only minimally , despite the national affinity for media-bashing . She even is philosophic about the occasional misquote , unflattering photo or outright lie that pops_up in stories about her . &quot; You don ' t get_away unscathed , &quot; she says flatly . &quot; They ' re going to print something . And I ' ve been really lucky because the press has been really nice to me . And I ' ll stop wherever I am -- even if I look_like crap -- I say , ' Go_ahead and take the picture , ' because they are trying to get the job done and it ' s part of the game , in my opinion. &quot; Next up in the game , movie-wise , is the release of &quot; The Flintstones , &quot; a Steven Spielberg production that O ' Donnell hopes has blockbuster written all_over it . But even if it bombs at the box_office , she ' s already realized a dream as a result of the project : She is a Happy Meal figurine . OK , it ' s actually Betty Rubble ' s likeness that is poised to become a prize in McDonald ' s fast-food version of the Cracker Jacks box . But O ' Donnell , who long has been a collector of Happy Meal toys herself ( &quot; I have like hundreds &quot; ) , is thrilled to be even this close to immortalization . Following &quot; The Flintstones , &quot; O ' Donnell ' s screen image will take a dramatic turn -- she goes from fleshing out a cartoon to showing more of_her_own flesh than we ' ve ever seen before . In &quot; Exit to Eden , &quot; based on the Anne Rice novel , she plays an undercover cop who goes_to an adult-themed fantasy island to solve a drug-smuggling caper . The role , reportedly turned_down by Sharon Stone , includes a semi-nude scene . &quot; I ' m nearly nude , &quot; O ' Donnell reports . &quot; Nude enough to scare people . &quot; I ' m in S &amp; M sort of clothing , and it ' s really not that much different from wearing a one-piece bathing_suit , but I have enough problems wearing a one-piece bathing_suit at family parties , nevermind in front of all_of America in a film . So I took it in a way to get_over my own problems about my body image and to try to face the things that I fear. &quot; Weight control always has been something of a demon for O ' Donnell , but it hasn ' t stopped her from cultivating a love of athletics . The baseball skills she brought_to &quot; A League of Their Own &quot; were genuine . And now , she says , she has a movie in development at Disney about a former basketball star who gave_up her college scholarship when she became pregnant , but comes_back to the game years later as coach of a high_school girls ' team . The film , &quot; Girl Hoops , &quot; which she wrote and would star in , is expected to begin shooting early next year . Until then , the only athletic skills she is mastering are yo-yo-ing , bubble-blowing , Hula-Hooping , hand-clapping and smooching , all_of which she does often and enthusiastically in &quot; Grease. &quot; She says that one day she might like to do a Letterman-esque type talk_show . This could be the perfect training . What : &quot; Grease , &quot; starring Rosie O ' Donnell . When : Tuesday , March 29 through April 3 .
