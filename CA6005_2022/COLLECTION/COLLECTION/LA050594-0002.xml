   <HEADLINE> THE WAX TREATMENT : PRODUCE BEAUTY SECRETS REVEALED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The worst-kept secret of the produce industry becomes public_knowledge Sunday when supermarkets will be required by the federal_government to identify all fresh fruit and vegetables that are commercially coated with wax . For those shoppers still in the dark at the produce counter : The shine and slippery gleam on apples , cucumbers , citrus , tomatoes -- and nearly two_dozen other commodities -- is not the work of Mother Nature but more like the magic of industrial cosmetics . The new disclosure regulation , in the works for several years , has been all but ignored in the attention provided the comprehensive nutritional labeling requirements for processed foods that also go_into effect Sunday . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will oversee compliance on both the nutrition and wax labeling . Yet consumers may find that the wax disclosures will be more prominent than the new fine print on soup cans and cereal_boxes . All coated produce will now carry shelf tags or package labels identifying the presence of a resinous covering . In addition , some supermarket chains will post banners with the government-required language on waxing and a list of all fruits and vegetables that might be affected . * Currently , produce packing companies use a variety of food-grade coatings including vegetable- , petroleum- , beeswax- , or shellac-based waxes or resins . &quot; The use of wax on food goes_back 2 # 000 years to when the Chinese used to dunk things in beeswax or paraffin to preserve it , &quot; says John McClung , vice_president of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn. , an Alexandria-based trade group . &quot; Today , waxes are used for several purposes , but mostly on thin-skinned items to prevent ( dehydration ) and wrinkling . Citrus is thick-skinned but porous and also needs a coating . Wax is used on melons to act_as a barrier against bacteria and fungus . And , of course , wax is applied for cosmetic reasons -- to make produce attractive. &quot; Originally , the issue became a concern because of religious and / or lifestyle reasons . There was a time when the produce industry used an animal-based wax from rendered tallow for fruit and vegetable coatings that would be objectionable , for instance , for those on kosher regimens or vegetarian diets . Ironically , research conducted by the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Assn . found that no animal-based waxes are currently being used on domestic or imported fresh produce . &quot; This whole_thing was never a public health issue but a consumer-right-to-know issue , &quot; McClung says . &quot; Nobody has used tallow for a long_time because it ' s not as_good_as other coating agents. &quot; * However , a 1987 publication by the Natural_Resources Defense Council claims that produce waxes do play a role in the food safety debate . &quot; ( Waxing ) , in_effect , seals the pesticide residues in the food , &quot; reads the NRDC report . &quot; In fact , some pesticides are even combined with the waxes . For instance , waxes applied to citrus and tomatoes may contain fungicides. &quot; The report also stated that the waxes , by design , can not be washed off . At the same time , some segments of the produce industry are steamed at the new requirements . Sunkist Growers Inc. , the Sherman Oaks citrus cooperative , is stuck_with about $ 3 million in packaging that can not be used under the new regulation , according to Claire Peters , Sunkist spokeswoman . The packaging will have to be reprinted or additional inserts will be needed in_order to comply with the law . Both , she says , are expensive propositions . * Representatives of the apple industry , on the other hand , are considering whether to discontinue using wax on their commodity altogether . Under the regulation , growers can label their produce stating that &quot; no wax or resin &quot; was used . Local supermarkets have already begun to comply with the wax regulation . Julie Reynolds , spokeswoman for the Vons Cos. , says the chain last week began installing posters on waxing . She says that some consumers ' buying habits may be negatively influenced by the wax disclosures but didn ' t express any great concern about sales losses . The timing of the regulation comes_on the eve of the first harvest of California ' s major summer fruit crop , much of which will be flagged for the first time as being waxed .</TEXT>
