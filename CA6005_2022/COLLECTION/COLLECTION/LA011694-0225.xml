   <HEADLINE> CLINTON HAILS BELARUS FOR ARMS POLICY ; EUROPE : PRESIDENT STOPS IN FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC TO COMMEND IT FOR GIVING_UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS . BUT HE ALSO REPRIMANDS LAWMAKERS FOR THEIR RESISTANCE TO POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC REFORMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton dropped into this most docile of former Soviet republics Saturday to give it a pat on the head and a kick_in the pants . In the process , he stepped into a wasteland of fog and ice , where remnants of the Cold_War linger and the faces of people on the crumbling streets are stony with continuing hardship and undimmed memories of slaughter . The pat on the head was for Belarus ' quick , complete compliance with Russia ' s request that it give_up the nuclear_weapons on its territory . The kick_in the pants was for the country ' s Parliament -- an old-style Supreme Soviet left over from Communist days -- for its stubborn resistance to political and economic reform . Officially , quiet Belarus sometimes behaves as if it wished the Soviet_Union had never disappeared . On military questions such_as nuclear_weapons , it often follows neighboring Russia ' s line . Its leader , Stanislav Shushkevich , is trying to institute gradual reforms -- but the Supreme Soviet , an unreformed assembly of old-time apparatchiks , wants him to stop even that . But when Belarus gave_up any claim to the nuclear_weapons on its territory in 1991 , it instantly became one of the United States ' favorite former Soviet republics . The United States worked for more_than two years , ever since the collapse of the Soviet_Union , to persuade Ukraine and Kazakhstan to get_rid_of their nuclear_weapons too , but neither was as cooperative as Belarus . That prompted Clinton , wife Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea to spend a cold and dreary Saturday in Minsk , a city that has never ranked among Europe ' s tourist attractions , before heading to Geneva , where the President will meet with Syrian President Hafez Assad today for discussions on the stalled Mideast peace talks . &quot; Belarus led the way &quot; in eliminating nuclear_weapons , &quot; and you deserve the credit and thanks of citizens all_over the world , &quot; Clinton told an audience of government officials , university professors and students at the Belarus National Academy of Sciences . &quot; I hope you will follow_through with the commitments that have been made to hold new elections in March of this year , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; I hope you will press ahead with plans to create a new constitution. &quot; Shushkevich wants to write a new , de-Sovietized constitution and hold early elections for a new Parliament , but conservatives in the Supreme Soviet have resisted both moves . But the abstract wrangling about foreign and domestic policy is overshadowed by the all-too-visible practical realities of Minsk -- and Kiev and much of the rest of the former Soviet empire that Clinton tried to reach_out to on his weeklong trip . All but leveled during World_War_II and rebuilt to the shabby , graceless standards of the Soviet empire , Minsk reflects the grim face of more_than half a century of determined communism . It has also suffered mass butchery on a scale and frequency that most Americans can scarcely imagine -- at the hands of both the Nazis and Josef Stalin . Clinton ran unexpectedly into all_of that Saturday when he planned to visit a memorial to tens of thousands of Belarussians who were summarily executed for suspected disloyalty from 1937 to 1941 , during the Stalin era . The President originally planned to visit the site , a patch of fields and pine forest that was ankle deep in melting ice and snow Saturday , as his first stop in Minsk . But former Communist hard-liners in the government complained that he was giving the memorial -- a simple , cross-like stone slab -- too_much significance ( they have been promising for several years to erect a permanent memorial , but it has yet to be built ) , and Clinton postponed the visit until later in the day . Even so , a small band of unreconstructed Communists unfurled red banners along Minsk ' s main boulevard and protested Clinton ' s visit with signs calling_for a return to the old days . Another showed a cartoon of a hook-nosed Uncle_Sam stealing Belarus ' wealth , a reminder of the historic anti-Semitism that contributed to the liquidation of one of Central Europe ' s largest Jewish ghettos during World_War_II . Such remnants of historic passions are scattered all_over the former Soviet_Union , but nowhere are they more stark than in Belarus . Under a Supreme Soviet full of former party members , the country seems trapped in a time warp , between an old_world that has disappeared and a new_world they refuse to join . Minsk ' s government center still sports a giant , brooding statue of V . I . Lenin . The main_street is no longer Lenin Prospect , but a nearby avenue is still loyally named Karl Marx Boulevard . And while the Communist_Party officially rules no more , its headquarters has simply been turned_into offices for -- surprise -- the Supreme Soviet . Belarussians seem to have a hard_time remembering they are supposed to be independent -- not surprising for a nation that was part of Russia for centuries until 1991 . When people in Minsk talk_about &quot; our country , &quot; they often mean the whole of the former Soviet_Union . Belarus hasn ' t even set_up a real currency of its own , one of the most basic steps_in achieving economic independence . The new Belarussian ruble is linked to the Russian ruble and is referred to here as the &quot; rabbit &quot; ( zalchik ) -- for the picture on the bill -- to distinguish it from its older brother . The Clintons came_to Minsk from a three-day visit in Moscow , which concluded with a gala dinner Friday night hosted by Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin and an overnight stay in a guest apartment in the Kremlin . In Minsk , Mrs . Clinton met children suffering from rheumatoid_arthritis , heart_disease and other illnesses during a visit to Pediatric Hospital No . 4 . The Clintons flew Saturday evening to Geneva , where the President was to meet today with Syria ' s Assad . The meeting is aimed at giving a jump-start to Syrian-Israeli negotiations in the U.S.-sponsored Middle_East peace negotiations . But a senior State_Department official warned that no immediate concrete results are likely from the talks . * RELATED STORIES : A8-10</TEXT>
