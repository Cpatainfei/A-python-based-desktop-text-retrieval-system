   <HEADLINE> FRANKLIN D . MURPHY DIES ; L.A. CIVIC , BUSINESS_LEADER ; LEGACY : EX-UCLA CHANCELLOR , TIMES MIRROR CEO WAS A RENAISSANCE_MAN WITH A GIFT FOR BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Franklin D . Murphy , the doctor , educator , administrator and business_executive who helped lift Los Angeles onto the cultural , artistic and educational world stage through his uncanny ability to weave together people , projects and the means to pay_for them , died Thursday . He was 78 . Murphy , who came_to Los Angeles in 1960 as chancellor of UCLA and immediately declared himself &quot; deeply involved &quot; in his new community , had suffered from cancer . Heading UCLA through the turbulent 1960s , Murphy forced the decentralization of the University of California and made the Westwood campus an equal partner to Berkeley . He went_on to be chairman and chief_executive_officer of Times Mirror Co. , parent of the Los Angeles Times , from 1968 through 1980 , a period in which earnings and revenue quadrupled . He served with distinction on the boards of four multinational commercial powers -- BankAmerica Corp. , Ford Motor Co. , Hallmark Cards Inc. and Norton Simon Inc. Dubbed the quintessential Renaissance_man by his contemporaries , Murphy indefatigably pursued a parallel career promoting his twin passions of art and rare books . Unusual for a man of comparatively modest means , he simultaneously became a major player in international philanthropy . Murphy was board chairman of the National Gallery of Art , the Samuel H . Kress Foundation and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , which he helped to create , and was an influential trustee of the J . Paul Getty Trust . He also chaired the President ' s Biomedical Research Panel , the American Council on Education and the Council on Higher Education in the American Republics . He saw Los Angeles as &quot; well on its way to manifest_destiny as one of the great and vital cities of the world &quot; and set_out to make_sure it got there . Through his administrative efforts in offices and board rooms or behind the scenes , the pragmatic Missourian prodded his adopted community toward greatness . &quot; He did for the city the same thing he did for UCLA , &quot; said Robert H . Ahmanson , president of the Ahmanson Foundation on whose board Murphy served for many years . &quot; He raised it from second-rate to first-rate , and that is the goal he always worked toward. &quot; Part of what Murphy did for both the university and the city , said Charles E . Young , who followed Murphy as UCLA chancellor , was simply to instill a sense of self-worth , energizing both to raise funds , recruit leaders and build new centers of learning and culture . &quot; During the last 25 to 30 years , &quot; said Young , &quot; Franklin Murphy is probably the most seminal person across the board in terms of the growth and development of the Los Angeles community into a world leader. &quot; How Murphy accomplished that , his contemporaries observe , was to know seemingly everything and everybody , know what needed to be done and then gracefully blend components to further his humanistic vision . &quot; He had a rare gift of knowing who should know whom and getting them together , &quot; said Robert Skotheim , president of the Huntington Library , who regularly sought Murphy ' s advice about personnel and acquisitions . &quot; The strategy or the purpose for that was unquestionably his intellectual curiosity about how things work and his motivation to be an actor . Despite the fact that the world would have regarded him as an academic_administrator until his 50s , he had a very great activist impulse to cause things to happen . &quot; So many times you find Franklin ' s invisible hand in the process , &quot; Skotheim said . &quot; He was just unique in being involved as a mastermind , a planner , a helper behind the scenes . I can ' t think_of anybody who did not have great personal wealth who has had a comparable philanthropic impact on educational and cultural institutions. &quot; That hand of the veteran board_member , for instance , was credited for moving Rusty Powell from head of the Los Angeles County Art Museum to direct the National Gallery of Art ; for guiding Harold Williams from Norton Simon Inc. to the UCLA Graduate_School of Business and , after a stint chairing the Securities and Exchange Commission , to head the prestigious J . Paul Getty Trust ; for mentoring and leading his own assistant , Young , to replace him at UCLA and Robert F . Erburu ultimately to follow him at Times Mirror , and for persuading Ahmanson to dispense gifts from the foundation of his wealthy late uncle , Howard F . Ahmanson . &quot; That is a part of his genius . He knew the right man for the right place , &quot; said Ahmanson , whose family foundation hands_out more_than $ 20 million a year for education , art , medical and other human services in Southern California . &quot; In 1968 when Howard died , we were in need of a chairman , and Franklin was the one who said , ' You should do it. ' I hadn ' t even considered it , and it has been the best thing that ever happened to me. &quot; In another example of Murphy ' s fortuitous matchmaking , he decided that prestigious Notre Dame University ' s new library needed microfilm copies of the unique Ambrosian Collection of early Italian manuscripts housed in Milan , Italy . Murphy found the necessary million dollars of foundation money and got the manuscripts copied , recalled Father Theodore Hesburgh , president emeritus of Notre Dame , with amusement and admiration for his old friend and contemporary educator . The accomplishment did more_than further Murphy ' s own interest in preserving early Italian printing . When the Milan library closed for several years for major renovation , Hesburgh said , Notre Dame became the world ' s only source of the precious material , and , incidentally , helped Interpol unmask a counterfeit manuscript offered to Sotheby ' s for_sale . &quot; Franklin ought to get credit for that , &quot; said Hesburgh , who also joined the Council on Higher Education in the American Republics only because Murphy convinced reluctant South_American educators that Catholic countries needed at least one Catholic leader in the group . Closer to home , Murphy also helped the Ahmanson Foundation establish the Ahmanson-Murphy Aldine Collection of about 800 volumes of precious 15th- and 16th-Century books at UCLA . Renaissance scholars from around the world are sharing Aldine papers this week in Italy at the International Conference in Honor of Dr. Franklin Murphy . More_than 50 participants , who were unaware of his death , sent a letter that arrived in Murphy ' s office Thursday , stating : &quot; All of us regret your absence from this event in your honor , and we send you warmest greetings and all our very best wishes. &quot; Murphy created what was ultimately named the Franklin D . Murphy Sculpture Garden at UCLA , because he noticed a flat , barren area of campus and through his connections learned that a collector of contemporary sculpture might donate the works to a worthy recipient . &quot; It didn ' t take him long to put two or three people together to achieve a gift to UCLA of 50 to 70 sculptures . And his attitude was that these pieces should go_out into the landscape environment to be a central hub where students could meditate , &quot; said Lee Walcott , managing director of the Ahmanson Foundation . &quot; Today it ' s a wonderful , tranquil spot on campus . . . . It is a wonderful living tribute to him. &quot; Immersed in promoting art and rare books and education , the doctor ' s son never forgot his own medical training . Murphy himself proved to be the right man in the right place , said A.W. Clausen , former president and chief_executive_officer of BankAmerica Corp . and president of the World_Bank , when Bank of America board Chairman Chauncey Medberry collapsed at a shareholders ' meeting in San Francisco . Board_member Murphy was quickly out of his chair , Clausen said , loosening Medberry ' s collar and pounding on his chest . Colleagues attribute Murphy ' s ability to accomplish so_much to such qualities as his extraordinary intellect , knowledge , judgment , instantaneous decision-making , taste , sensitivity , availability , enthusiasm , vision and outstanding people skills , adding_up to a special wisdom . Otis Chandler , who succeeded Murphy as chairman_of_the_board of Times Mirror , said Murphy ' s greatest contribution &quot; has been that he has recognized and developed the talents of the people who operate this company and its major divisions. &quot; He said Murphy recognized that it was best &quot; to encourage them , to provide counsel to them , but not interfere with their day-to-day operations . That I define as superb wisdom. &quot; Despite his own respected eye for art , Murphy typically left acquisitions of paintings and other objects to curators . &quot; In all_the museums that I have been involved with , &quot; he told a British art magazine in 1991 , &quot; one thing that I have always fought for is that the final_decision be with the professional. &quot; Assessing how an educator interested in art became so valuable to business , Clausen noted : &quot; The most serious problem in most business is people. &quot; Because he was so adept at evaluating and dealing with people , Clausen said , Murphy became one of the bank ' s all-time best directors and a valuable adviser to him . &quot; He had an enormous amount of good common_sense . He had his feet very firmly on the ground . He was very practical and pragmatic on business issues , government_issues , or even social issues , &quot; said Clausen , &quot; and that meant he was very wise. &quot; &quot; One reason he was asked to do so many things was he was not egocentric , &quot; said Roger Heyns , who was chancellor at UC Berkeley during the turbulent 1960s when Murphy was chancellor at UCLA . &quot; He was there for the activity or event and that made people trust him . And he was a peppy person . Conversation with him was fun . &quot; Clausen said Murphy was also totally devoid_of arrogance or braggadocio and had an inoffensive manner in stating his own ( usually right ) ideas and deflecting wrong ones , adding with a chuckle : &quot; There was no barbed wire or rusty glass_in his comments. &quot; Franklin David Murphy was born in Kansas City , Mo. , the son of a physician , Dr. Franklin E . Murphy , and a concert pianist , Cordelia Brown Murphy . A straight-A student who quarterbacked his high_school football_team , Murphy attributed his love of books to his bibliophile father and his love of art to an aunt who was a painter in Paris at the turn_of_the_century . He earned his bachelor ' s degree at the University of Kansas in 1936 , where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa , spent a year on an exchange fellowship at the University of Goettingen in Germany and earned his M.D. at the University of Pennsylvania School_of_Medicine in 1941 . Toward the end of World_War_II , Murphy joined the Army and worked_on research into malaria and other tropical diseases , earning the rank of captain and a citation and commendation ribbon . Returning to his native Kansas City to set_up a medical_practice , he taught part-time at the nearby University of Kansas School_of_Medicine . He became dean of the school in 1948 , when he was only 32 , and was soon named by the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce as one of America ' s 10 outstanding young_men . Three years later , Murphy was named chancellor of the university . He was so popular that when he agreed to leave for Westwood in 1960 , students burned the Kansas governor in effigy for allegedly driving Murphy out , chanting , &quot; We want Murphy ! &quot; In his inaugural_address at UCLA , Murphy promised to lead the school to &quot; major scholarly distinction in worldwide terms. &quot; To achieve less , he said , &quot; would represent unimaginable lack of vision and inexcusable timidity. &quot; During his tenure , UCLA added about 40 new buildings , increased its student body from 20 # 000 to 30 # 000 , and weathered one of the most politically tumultuous periods for all universities . Although UCLA never saw the student unrest over Vietnam that erupted at Berkeley , Murphy still had to contend with the developing free speech movement . He did_it by drawing students into an &quot; advising process &quot; while making clear that he would make the final policy decisions . When 150 students staged a sit-in outside his office in 1967 to protest his refusal to halt on-campus job interviews by Dow Chemical Co. , manufacturer of napalm , Murphy said : &quot; I do not believe the technique of the dialogue has failed . There has been a momentary break as a result of the passions brought_about by the war , but we will not have chronic disorder on this campus . The faculty will not tolerate it and most of the students won ' t either. &quot; Murphy himself had championed freedom_of_speech as a student at the University of Kansas , arranging for controversial speakers , including a sociologist who discussed trial marriage -- much to the consternation of Murphy ' s mother . While calming and building UCLA , Murphy reached_into the community to help create Los Angeles County ' s Museum of Art and Music Center and into the nation to help the Kress Foundation place art in the National Gallery and elsewhere . He earned such respect in artistic circles that Paul Mellon personally asked him to join the National Gallery board and tapped Murphy as his successor as chairman . Throughout his two decades at the University of Kansas and UCLA and more_than two decades at Times Mirror ( 12 years as chairman and chief_executive_officer , six as chairman_of_the_board ' s executive committee and several as director emeritus ) , Murphy plied his matchmaking talents in a variety of other organizations not previously mentioned . He served on the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , the Study Committee on Federal Aid to Public Health of the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations , the U.S. Advisory Commission on Educational Exchange , the State Universities Assn. , the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , the Federal Commission on Government_Security , the U.S. Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs to the Department_of_State , the Peace Corps National Advisory Council , and the Special Medical Advisory Group of the Veterans Administration . He worked_on the board of consultants of the National War College and the board of visitors to the U.S. Air_Force ' s Air University , the Medical Advisory Commission of the American_Legion , the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals of the AMA , the American Council on Education ' s Committees on Institutional Research Policy and on Problems and Policies , the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation , the Presidential Task_Forces on both the Arts and the Humanities and on Private Sector Initiatives , the Urban Institute , the board of governors of the American Red_Cross and the national council of the Boy_Scouts of America . He also served as a trustee of the California Museum of Science and Industry , the Institute of International Education , the University of Pennsylvania , the Salk Institute , the Eisenhower Exchange Scholarship Program and the Carnegie Institution of Washington . Those efforts garnered Murphy 17 honorary doctorates ; awards from Italy , the_Netherlands , Japan , Germany , France and Spain ; such varied honors as the Distinguished Eagle_Scout Award , the UCLA Medal , and the Andrew W . Mellon Medal of the National Gallery of Art , and designation as a fellow in the American Assn . for the Advance of Science , the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Society of Arts . &quot; Franklin , &quot; a Times colleague once said to him , &quot; you are a walking interlocking directorate. &quot; &quot; That , &quot; said Murphy with a twinkle in his eye , &quot; is how I get things done. &quot; &quot; Franklin Murphy is irreplaceable , &quot; said Erburu , the chairman , president and chief_executive_officer of Times Mirror Co . &quot; We will miss him terribly. &quot; Murphy is survived by his wife of more_than 50 years , the former Judith Joyce Harris of Beverly Hills ; four children , Joyce Dickey , Martha Crockwell , Carolyn Speer , and Dr. Franklin Lee Murphy , and one sister , Cordelia M . Ennis . The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the UCLA Research Library Special Collections Department for the Ahmanson-Murphy Aldine Collection . * AN APPRECIATION : Franklin D .
