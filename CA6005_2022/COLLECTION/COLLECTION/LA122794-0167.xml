   <HEADLINE> REGULATORS SHIFT FOCUS TO TINY AIR POLLUTANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It sounds like a recipe for some sort of noxious stew : Take soot from trucks and buses , add a bit of ammonia from dairy_farms , mix_in nitrates from car exhaust , a hefty dose of dust and dirt that blow_off streets and construction sites , a sprinkling of ash from fires , some sulfur from factories and a final dash of sea salts . Combined , this brew can clog the filters at an air-quality monitoring station in Rubidoux , on the outskirts of Riverside , within a span of hours , rendering them opaque with fine black particles that also can lodge_in the lungs of people who live there . Occasionally , most recently on a dismal day in January , the mass of airborne particles that shrouds the Rubidoux area reaches three to four times greater than a health standard set by state authorities . While the Inland Empire suffers the most severe and frequent bouts , unhealthful amounts of these particles occur year-round throughout the four-county Los Angeles Basin . Beginning next year , the Southland ' s air quality agency will embark_on a new frontier as it launches a decade-long quest to control this pervasive and mysterious pollutant known as PM 10 -- particulate matter smaller than 10 microns , one-fifth the width of a human hair . After decades of obsessing on ozone , the Los Angeles region ' s most notorious air pollutant , the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the California Air Resources Board are shifting their focus toward designing a strategy by 1997 to clean_up these microscopic particles . &quot; Over the next three or four years , I fully expect we ' ll see a shift in emphasis in California , &quot; said Mike Scheible , the state board ' s deputy executive_officer . &quot; PM 10 will become the air_pollution topic for the end of this century and the beginning of the next century . It is an especially dangerous air pollutant. &quot; Under federal law , the Los Angeles Basin -- which is twice as polluted with particulates as most areas in the nation -- has until Feb . 8 , 1997 , to detail how it intends to achieve national PM 10 health standards by 2006 . Health researchers have called the ultra-fine particles California ' s deadliest air pollutant because they can escape the body ' s defense_mechanisms and penetrate deep into the lungs . PM 10 has been linked in recent scientific studies to chronic respiratory_disease and premature deaths from heart_attacks , pneumonia , asthma and other ailments . A gritty fog of PM 10 sometimes reduces visibility to a_few blocks around Ontario and Riverside and to a mile in eastern Los Angeles and northern Orange counties . &quot; Particulates have taken a back seat to ozone control in a lot of areas , &quot; said Ron White , environmental health director at the American Lung Assn . &quot; But the health data that has emerged in the past two years has been a real wake-up call . Unfortunately , a lot of areas in the country -- including the Los Angeles Basin , even though it is further ahead than most -- are playing catch-up to develop a package of control programs. &quot; As they chart their new course , state and local air officials face some wrenching decisions on how to spread the cleanup burden , which will probably cost billions of dollars per year , among the various sources of PM 10 . Virtually every human_activity that burns fuel , stirs_up dirt or dust , builds a structure or tills soil creates a cloud of atmospheric particles . The PM 10 that obscures the region ' s skies is a mystifying blend of man-made and natural substances , its contents shifting from city to city and season to season . Because it is such a grab bag of pollutants , PM 10 poses one of the most profound challenges facing the two air agencies . The AQMD , as it tries to hash out an equitable cleanup plan , is admittedly reliant_on imprecise and unsophisticated data on the degree of blame to assign each source . &quot; There are some tough questions ahead of us and so many unknowns about the composition of PM 10 , &quot; said Norton Younglove , who recently retired as a Riverside County supervisor and AQMD board_member and will chair a PM 10 working group representing the various industries , municipalities and regulators . &quot; Depending_on how the data shakes out , we may have to kick at each other a bit. &quot; The planning process got_off to a contentious start in August when Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan proposed a major change in the AQMD ' s 20-year anti-smog plan that pitted the cities near the coast against the region ' s more inland areas . The mayor suggested that it may be more cost-effective for the air district to target particles from outlying dirt roads and dairy_farms than to mandate alternative fuels for urban trucks , trains , ships and other diesel equipment . Citing possible economic disruption , he asked the AQMD to remove the proposals aimed at particulates from its plan . Many Inland Empire officials reacted angrily , accusing Los Angeles of trying to shift the PM 10 burden to them . Now the state and local air boards trying to solve the PM 10 problem are wrestling with the very question posed by Riordan and his staff : Should they assign the highest priority to &quot; fugitive dust &quot; -- particles of earth from roads , construction sites and fields -- or to exhaust from motor_vehicles ? That debate , in_essence , pits Chino ' s farms against Los Angeles ' trucks . &quot; It ' s easier for those upwind to ignore this ( PM 10 ) problem , but we can ' t help but take it more personally here because we are impacted the most , &quot; said Younglove , a longtime Riverside County resident . &quot; Politically , it is unquestionably easier to pick on cows -- which are phasing_out anyway -- and rural roads than ships , planes and trains , which are large , important parts of our economy. &quot; About 115 million people in the United States , including one-third of California ' s population , live_in areas where the air violates federal PM 10 health standards set_in 1987 , according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data . The record is far worse for a more stringent state health standard ; just one area of California , Lake County , east of Mendocino , complies . However , only the severely polluted areas in California , those that violate the federal standard , face the 1997 deadline for devising a cleanup plan . In the Los Angeles Basin , violations of the PM 10 health standards occur under an enormous variety of weather_conditions , from stagnant summer days to gusty fall winds . &quot; Really , the only time_of_year that we are free_of higher levels of PM 10 is during the rainy_season -- most of January , March and the beginning of April , &quot; said AQMD senior meteorologist Joe Cassmassi . As dismal as the record is , research over the past year indicates that the national standard may be too lax to protect public health . In a study of 8 # 000 people in six cities , the Harvard School of Public Health reported last year that PM 10 increases the risk of early death 26 % and shortens lives one to two years in moderately polluted cities -- such_as Steubenville , Ohio -- which already comply with the federal standard . Other research shows that respiratory deaths increase 3.4 % and asthma_attacks increase 3 % for every small increase ( 10 micrograms ) in PM 10 . Still , of all_the major air pollutants , particulates remain the most poorly understood . Even basic_assumptions -- what is it comprised of and which are the biggest sources -- are based on imperfect and outdated databases and models . AQMD measurements that define its composition are almost a decade old . To resolve some of these uncertainties , the AQMD board recently authorized $ 600 # 000 for a 1 1 / 2-year research project to decipher the chemical makeup of the smallest , most hazardous particles and the role of motor_vehicles and ammonia . The agency also is seeking $ 1.5 million in research funds from other groups , including the city of Los Angeles and the oil , auto , construction and dairy industries . PM 10 remains such an enigma because it is the only major pollutant that is not identified by its chemical contents . Instead , it is crudely defined purely by its size . An airborne particle of anything trapped in a 10-micron filter -- mineral , metal , soot , soil or synthetic material -- qualifies as the pollutant . Unlike Palm Springs , which suffers major dust_storms , the vast majority of PM 10 in the Los Angeles Basin comes from man-made sources , with only a slight fraction coming from minerals blowing from the land or ocean , said John Watson , a research professor at the University of Nevada-Reno ' s Desert Research Institute who studies particulates throughout the West . Each day in the basin , about 850 tons of particulates under 10 microns pollute the air from streets , farms , trucks , buses , cars , oil_refineries , mines and other sources , according to an AQMD inventory . Also , about 1 # 000 tons per day of nitrogen_oxides , mostly from motor_vehicles , and 200 tons of sulfur from industrial_plants can react in the atmosphere to indirectly create particulates . About one-third of the basin ' s PM 10 is ammonium_nitrate , a blend of nitrogen from vehicles and ammonia released in the air largely from dairy_farms . &quot; It is a very complex pollutant , &quot; said White of the lung association . &quot; Not only do you have to worry about direct emissions , but also the secondary sources ( from ) gases , typically from industrial sources and cars , that get transformed in the atmosphere into particles. &quot; One of the most challenging mysteries is the source and volume of dust that blows from roads and fields . On some nights in Riverside , calcium particles cause dramatic peaks in PM 10 , but no one knows where they come from . Watson believes that some type of human_activity is stirring_up calcium-rich soils . &quot; The data on fugitive dust are very , very inaccurate and probably overestimated , &quot; Watson said . &quot; It ' s very difficult to trace it back to their sources. &quot; By volume , the single largest culprit is dust and dirt stirred_up on paved roads , which are responsible_for 450 tons per day of PM 10 . But the tinier the particle , the more serious the health threat , so the AQMD and state board are likely to focus their regulations on particles measuring under 2.5 microns , which come predominantly from trucks and cars , rather than the larger particles blowing_off dirty roads . None of the sources of PM 10 presents an easy or cheap solution . Controlling dust from roads and fields could require more thorough and frequent street sweeping , enclosures for manure and other waste piles , wind screens , planting of vegetation and slowing of traffic through dusty areas . Eliminating substantial amounts of particles from trucks , buses and other diesel-powered vehicles means switching to alternative fuels such_as natural_gas and methanol . &quot; In Los Angeles , the easy stuff has already been done , &quot; Watson said . &quot; You can ' t just nail some power_plant . You ' ve already cranked down as far as you can on many of these sources. &quot; Also , the state may have no choice but to focus_on motor_vehicles because the federal Environmental Protection Agency is leaning toward imposing a new standard for tinier particles . The agency is under court_order to review its PM 10 standards by Jan . 31 , 1997 -- eight days before local cleanup plans are_due . Trucking_companies vehemently oppose standards that would end use of diesel -- which is a cheap and efficient , but dirty , fuel . Today ' s diesel trucks contain particulate-trapping filters mandated by state emission standards . Compared to trucks manufactured in 1970 , 1994 trucks are 80 % to 90 % cleaner in particulates and 65 % to 70 % cleaner in nitrogen_oxides . &quot; Diesel technology has already come a long ways , &quot; said John Fischer of Detroit Diesel , a major manufacturer of truck and bus engines . In its ozone cleanup plan adopted last month , the state ARB proposed a standard that by 2002 would cut_in half nitrogen_oxides from new California-based heavy-duty trucks . The state plan also lists a future option of halving the limit again after 2004 -- which would require new catalytic technology or switching to an alternative fuel . Stephanie Williams , a California Trucking Assn . vice_president , said fuels such_as natural_gas might be an option for short hauls within the region , but not trips longer than 250 miles , in which heavy-duty trucks must climb mountain_passes . &quot; Unfortunately , &quot; Fischer said , &quot; with any alternative fuel , you lose one of the major advantages you have with diesel -- its fuel efficiency. &quot; Ammonia is also a mystery , although most fingers point to piles of cow manure at Chino ' s dairy_farms . Dairy_farmers , struggling with water quality regulations and dropping profits , worry that tough new PM 10 rules will target them . Jack Broadbent , the AQMD ' s planning director , said the lack of understanding about the role of each type of particle poses a &quot; significant impediment &quot; as his agency plans its attack on the pollution . &quot; There needs to be a great_deal of work in reducing the great number of uncertainties , &quot; he said . &quot; We have a very open mind ( about control techniques ) at this point. &quot; Yet air quality officials do not have much time to seek the answers before the 1997 deadline . &quot; The big question of concern , &quot; Younglove said , &quot; is whether we can collect this data quick enough to meet federal deadlines. &quot; In the face of politically influential opposition , White said the AQMD and state air board need political will if the Los Angeles region is to meet its mandate . &quot; If the promises are kept , I think 2006 is achievable , &quot; he said . &quot; But it ' s a question of whether those commitments will be met and maintained. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Where It Comes From On an average day , more_than 800 tons of PM 10 -- particles less than 10 microns in size -- are emitted into the air of the four-county Los Angeles Basin . The following list shows the amounts from direct sources of particles ; abundant gases such_as nitrogen , ammonia and sulfur which indirectly form particles in the atmosphere are not included . Source : Amount per day Paved road dust : 449 tons Unpaved road dust : 137 tons Construction : 103 tons Industrial : 47 tons Trucks : 36 tons Cars : 24 tons Other mobile sources : 23 tons Farms : 22 tons Dust and fires : 11 tons * * * SHIFTING THE BLAME The source of PM 10 varies from place to place , prompting a battle among cities and industries over what should be regulated . In the Riverside County area of Rubidoux , which suffers the most severe PM 10 pollution , a large percentage comes from road dust and dairy_farms . Downtown Los Angeles , however , gets more from motor_vehicles . The smallest and most dangerous particles , under 2.5 microns in size , nearly all come from trucks , cars and industries that burn fuel . RUBIDOUX IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY * Fugitive dust ( From roads and fields ) : 42.1 % * Ammonium_nitrate ( Ammonia from dairy_farms and sewage , and nitrates from cars ) : 25.4 % * Limestone : 7.9 % * Motor_vehicles : 7.7 % * Secondary carbon ( Carbon-based particles that form from petroleum vapors ) : 7.0 % * Ammonium sulfate ( Mix of ammonia from dairy_farms and sewage and sulfur from industrial_plants ) : 6.9 % * Marine ( Sea salts ) : 2.2 % * Residual oil ( Power_plants that burn fuel_oil ) : 0.8 % * * * DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES * Fugutive dust : 38.6 % * Ammonium_nitrate : 18.8 % * Secondary carbon : 13.1 % * Motor_vehicles : 11.5 % * Ammonium sulfate : 11.3 % * Marine : 4.5 % * Residual oil : 2.2 % Sources : South Coast Air Quality Management District : 1994 Projected Emission Inventory in the Draft Air Quality Management Plan , 1994 Particulate Air Quality Technical Report ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Areas at Risk Microscopic particles in the sky that obscure visibility and lodge_in the lungs are the newest focus of air_pollution authorities . The map below shows the average concentration of PM 10 particles -- so named because they are less than 10 microns in size -- in areas of the South Coast air basin for 1992 . Areas with an annual average of more_than 50 micrograms of PM 10 per cubic_meter of air violate federal standards . The state deems more_than 30 micrograms unhealthful .
