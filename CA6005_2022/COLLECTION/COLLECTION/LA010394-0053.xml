   <HEADLINE> LONG AGO AND FAR AWAY . . . ; FRIENDSHIP : A JOURNALIST WHOSE FAME WAS ESTABLISHED IN EUROPE ' S WARS BIDS FAREWELL TO A HERO WHO DIED AFTER HALF A CENTURY IN ANONYMITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This cannot be an obituary , since those are reserved for famous successful people , nor can it be In Memoriam , as that sounds pompous about a man who never wasted a minute of his life being pompous . So I think it is a farewell letter to my friend Freddy Keller who died from burns received in a stupid needless everyday accident , a fire in his small house . I would never have written such a letter to Freddy alive ; he would have been embarrassed for us both , thinking I was off my rocker , gone soppy with age . We did not exchange paeans of praise , though there was much love and understanding in our letters . We were mainly telling each other with irony our views of the world . We saw the world from different geographical angles , he from California , I from Britain , but we shared a similar way of looking , though he was funnier and sharper . Freddy was 80 years old , five years my junior . We belonged_to a vanishing breed , people who had in common the experience of two wars . Freddy lived through those wars at the cutting edge , the infantry , while I was a spectator . I now realize that I have known Freddy Keller for 56 years and know almost nothing about his personal life . We saw each other seldom , the last time 20 years ago . We wrote erratically . I needed the certainty that such a man lived ; it was a kind of private reassurance about our species . It is not often , it is practically never , that you can put absolute trust in the quality of another human_being . Probably we first met in Madrid in the spring of 1937 . I am unsure about this as about all dates . Freddy fought in the Abraham_Lincoln Battalion of the International Brigades in the Spanish_War . He would have been in Madrid on_leave , one of the wonderfully funny Americans who drifted in and out of the lives of reporters there . He had a short , square , tough body , mouse-blond hair , an Irish face , noteworthy because of its liveliness and because of the small bright_blue eyes that looked_at everything with unfaltering honesty and generally with amusement . Humor is a hallmark of the brave . They do not know they are brave . They downplay whatever happens by joking . The next time I saw him was in Barcelona , in the summer of 1938 , after the terrible retreat from the Ebro , the last big battle of the war . Freddy had swum the Ebro with a machine-gun bullet in his thigh , which was taken as cause for merriment and congratulation . The Ebro is a wide , deep , cold , gray river with a deadly current running to the sea . I have only now learned that Freddy swam the river several times , ferrying wounded comrades across . You would have to be heroic about pain and very strong to manage that . Freddy of course never spoke about it . Then the war , our war , ended in defeat and none of us ever got_over it in our hearts . We loved Spain and believed that it was the place where fascism must be stopped , the last chance . All the foreigners in Spain hated fascism for all their own different reasons . The Spanish_people knew exactly what they were fighting and suffering for , and their fears proved true when Franco won . Since the governments of the Western democracies , in their folly , abandoned the duly elected government of the Republic of Spain , we were certain that the big war would follow , as it did five months and two days after Franco ' s victory . The FBI branded everyone who had been in Spain , but above all_the Lincoln vets , as dangerous reds , to be monitored with suspicion . ( Through the Freedom of Information Act , which ought to be called the Freedom of Partial Information Act , I have seen my own small file with its wildly silly snooping accusations. ) Later , when the United States joined the Second_World_War , the &quot; red &quot; brand was altered to &quot; premature anti-fascist , &quot; though this did not cancel the FBI ' s hostile attention . Surprisingly , Freddy was able to sign_up as a private in the 82nd Airborne Division . It was not easy for the Lincoln vets to be allowed to go_on fighting fascism . The men of the 82nd were all volunteers , used in the harshest actions in Europe . I had no idea that Freddy was somewhere among those crack troops , though I was often with the 82nd during the war . I did not know until now that Freddy earned the Bronze_Star for bravery . In those days and in that division , decorations were rare . To win this distinction as a private , Freddy must have done something of remarkable courage . Of course , he never told me . In the first winter after the war , the 82nd was the American occupying force in Berlin , a city bombed into a vastness of jagged teeth . We Americans , the few reporters and the troops , were forbidden by the commanding general of the 82nd to cross the dividing Russian-American line into the Alexanderplatz , a huge loot market where cigarettes were the usual money . Two colleagues and I were nervously there , trying to sell a hideous brown tweed suit , sent up by Robert Capa , who was being held captive in the Lincoln Hotel in Paris until he paid his poker debts . In that milling crowd , Freddy suddenly appeared . He was neither buying nor selling ; he was risking disciplinary punishment , I am sure , to see the Russian soldiers . The Alexanderplatz was_full of them . In my memory , they were big , fair-haired , sloppily uniformed young_men , like country hicks for the first time in a city . They were obsessed by watches . They all wanted to buy watches . Freddy , never a communist , a born though detached Catholic , believed_in socialism . Not knowing Russia , as none of us did , he believed or hoped , or both , that socialism existed there , a dream of equality and justice for workers , his kind of people . Freddy was in the Alexanderplatz looking_at his heroes . We hugged each other and laughed and I lost track of him again . One of the many features of war is this : Everything changes , everyone meets by chance , everyone disappears to someplace else . I think the mind adapts to the chaos of war by becoming chaotic too . Freddy ' s life after the big war must have been filled with many jobs . I know of only one because he loved it and wrote or spoke_of it : He was an engine_driver on the trains , what trains or where I do not know . In all these years we did not see each other ' s houses ; we wrote letters . He never complained of anything , he was always funny , he was always clear and unmuddled in his thinking . He did not bother with accepted versions of politics , he was not touched by the hysterias that afflicted America in the postwar years . He went_on sturdily , obscure , hard-up , unsuccessful by the going rates of judging success . He was a tremendous success by the only standards that matter : honesty , loyalty , courage , and a beautiful lack of vanity . He was his own man for 80 years . He was one of the best_men I ever knew .</TEXT>
