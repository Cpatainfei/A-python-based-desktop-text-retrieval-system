   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROP . 190 ; MEASURE ' S OPPONENTS ENLIST JUDGE WAPNER ' S AID ; SWEEPING REFORM INITIATIVE WOULD OVERHAUL WIDELY CRITICIZED AGENCY THAT METES OUT JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Presented with the case of the judges judging other judges , Judge Joseph A . Wapner of &quot; People ' s Court &quot; fame has , of course , reviewed the evidence carefully : Proposition 190 , on the Nov . 8 ballot , would dramatically overhaul the Commission on Judicial Performance , the judge-dominated state agency that is supposed to discipline wayward judges . Virtually every legal group in California has been pressing for reform of the commission , an agency widely criticized as ineffective and overly secretive . This summer , the far-reaching reform proposal sailed_through the Legislature , earning a sole no vote_in both the Assembly and the Senate on its way to the ballot . There have been newspaper editorials backing the measure . Here , then , is Judge Wapner ' s opinion : Proposition 190 stinks . &quot; It ' s a bad , bad bill that should not be passed , &quot; Wapner said , referring to the initiative . &quot; It undermines the independence of the judiciary . It ' s against the separation of powers . I ' m very happy to speak out and I sincerely believe it ' s a bad bill. &quot; Plain-spoken , no-nonsense , blunt , a succinct summing_up of the anti-190 argument -- that ' s just what opponents of the sweeping judicial-discipline reform plan were hoping for when they enlisted Wapner , once voted the most recognized judge in America , in their campaign against the ballot measure . A former Los Angeles Superior_Court judge who became a TV_star during 12 years on &quot; People ' s Court , &quot; Wapner is no longer active on the bench . The TV_show is in reruns . But his star quality immediately swung the spotlight to Proposition 190 , one of three initiatives that were late starters on the November ballot . All three , added by the Legislature in the final days of its August session , focus_on the courts . Proposition 189 would allow judges to deny bail to anyone accused of felony sexual_assault . Proposition 191 would convert the state ' s 47 Justice Courts in rural counties to more-prestigious Municipal Courts . All three need only a majority to pass . The Libertarian Party has mustered the only opposition to Proposition 189 , emphasizing that judges already have the authority to jail violent criminals . The only opposition in the state ballot pamphlet to Proposition 191 was written by a San Jose attorney who often submits contrary ballot arguments when no one else comes_up with one . Before Wapner entered the fray a_couple_of weeks ago , it was generally agreed that Proposition 190 was a sure bet . It still is seen in legal and political circles as a likely winner -- but backers , acknowledging Wapner ' s appeal , have taken_to downplaying their chances . &quot; If I win , it ' s like Slippery Rock beating Notre Dame , me beating Wapner , &quot; said Marc Poche , a justice on the 1st District Court of Appeal in San Francisco and a vocal backer of Proposition 190 . The California Judges Assn. , the 1 # 500-member trade group that recruited Wapner to be the front_man for the opposition , lacks campaign funds . So Wapner is making the rounds of the editorial boards and the radio call-in shows . &quot; that ' s all_the judges have , &quot; said Warren Ettinger , a former Pasadena Municipal Court judge now in private practice in Los Angeles . &quot; They don ' t have credibility . They don ' t have much money . But they ' ve got Joe Wapner. &quot; As it stands now , the San Francisco-based commission is made_up of nine members -- five judges , two lawyers and two members of the public . It operates in the strictest secrecy , purportedly to protect judges from unfounded charges . It is authorized to admonish judges privately or recommend to the state Supreme Court that a judge be censured or removed from office . Proposition 190 would increase the membership of the commission from nine to 11 -- six members of the public , two lawyers and three judges . The change would give the public , not judges , a majority on the panel . The measure would require all proceedings to be open after formal accusations are filed against a judge . And it would give the commission the authority to remove a judge on its own . The proposition is not likely to have any significant fiscal impact , according to the state ' s legislative analyst , because the changes are largely procedural . But those procedures would radically restructure what was the first judicial discipline commission in the United States , created in 1960 and once regarded_as a model for the rest of the nation . It is no longer uniformly viewed with such high regard . The commission ' s job is to investigate misconduct . Some is obvious -- racial or gender bias , drug_abuse or the taking of bribes . Judges , however , are supposed to stay free from even the appearance of wrongdoing . And although records indicate that the number of complaints soared from 260 in 1980 to 950 in 1993 , the number of cases in which disciplinary action was taken increased only from nine in 1980 to 16 in 1993 . &quot; The commission has not been vigilant and much too willing to tolerate improprieties by judges , &quot; said USC law professor Edwin Chemerinsky , an authority on judicial ethics . Until it recommended Sept . 13 that San Diego Superior_Court Judge G . Dennis Adams be removed from office , the commission had not voted to publicly censure or remove a judge for six years . Adams , accused of improperly accepting gifts , said in a statement that he intends to fight for his job . He also said he was &quot; being sacrificed by the commission so it can justify its existence to a very critical Legislature. &quot; The Legislature has , indeed , been very critical in recent years of the judiciary -- a friction that apparently goes_back to the California Supreme Court ' s 1991 decision upholding Proposition 140 , a 1990 initiative that imposed term limits on elected officials and slashed the Legislature ' s budget by 38 % . The next spring , the Legislature threatened to cut the Supreme Court ' s budget -- by precisely 38 % . But those threats were not carried_out . This fiscal_year , after years of modest annual increases to the commission ' s budget , the Legislature abruptly increased the panel ' s budget by $ 1 million , to about $ 2.4 million -- with the obvious expectation , several experts said , that there would be results . Then , in December , Peter Keane , the chief_assistant public_defender in San Francisco , wrote a scathing article about the commission in a legal newspaper , the Daily Journal . Noting that the commission had not voted to remove a single judge in years , Keane , a member of the State Bar ' s board of governors , called it &quot; dead in the water. &quot; He added that the commission gave the &quot; appearance of being in the pocket of the judges whom they are supposed to regulate. &quot; Copies of the piece were soon circulating in Sacramento . A month later , in January , the commission announced that it had found &quot; no basis &quot; for disciplining Chief_Justice Malcolm Lucas , who had been under investigation for traveling extensively and accepting reimbursement for his trips . To critics , this came as no surprise . The state Supreme Court -- headed by Lucas -- appointed the five judges currently on the commission . Another member was appointed by former Gov . George Deukmejian , who had appointed his former law partner , Lucas , to be the chief_justice . Still another member was appointed by another Republican governor , Pete Wilson . Keane had written in December : &quot; The California judiciary is a close-connected network of people intensely loyal and empathetic to each other as members of the same unique club. &quot; In August , the measure Keane helped write shot through both houses . The vote_in the Assembly was 74-1 . In the Senate it was 31-1 . Foes , Wapner included , understand the momentum for reform . And judges profess not to be bothered by the provision that would open the commission ' s proceedings to the public . Instead , what alarms opponents is that Proposition 190 would give politicians -- the governor , the Speaker of the Assembly and the Senate Rules Committee -- the power to appoint eight of the 11 members on an expanded commission , with three appointments left to the Supreme Court . A better plan , judges say , is the one adopted last month by the American Bar Assn . that would create a 12-member commission -- four judges , four lawyers , four members of the public . The courts would nominate the judges , the State Bar would select the lawyers and the politicians would appoint the public members . That would eliminate opponents ' &quot; separation of powers &quot; concern with an 11-member panel , that a majority of eight would &quot; take it out on the judicial_branch of government any time they ' re displeased with the actions of the judiciary , &quot; said Sen . Quentin Kopp ( I-San Francisco ) , who cast the sole vote_in the Senate against the initiative . Opponents of Proposition 190 have one more objection -- an ultra-legalistic one . The initiative would give the commission the power to write its own rules and decide who and how , under those rules , to prosecute , judge and punish . That arrangement raises constitutional worries because in the state ' s trial_courts , the functions of prosecutor and judge are separate , said Santa Monica Superior_Court Judge David Rothman , an expert on judicial ethics . If Proposition 190 passes , a lawsuit challenging it on such constitutional grounds is all but certain , judges said . Just ask Wapner . &quot; I am not a wallflower going_to sit idly by and see principle going_down the drain , and not speak_up , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
