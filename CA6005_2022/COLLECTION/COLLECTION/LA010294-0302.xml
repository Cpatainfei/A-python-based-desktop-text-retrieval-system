   <TEXT> Ken Riley considers himself a good citizen and a solid father . But lately , the Foothill Ranch man says he has been getting treatment best reserved for some deadbeat_dad . Riley charges that mistakes by the Orange County agency that collects child-support payments have left a &quot; black mark &quot; on his credit report and a lien on his house even though he has kept_up with payments to his two children . An angered Riley has written scores of letters complaining to county and state officials . He ' s even asked the Orange County Grand_Jury to investigate . &quot; I ' ve had to scream bloody murder , &quot; Riley groused . &quot; What they ' re doing is an abuse of power . They ' re like a gang of Keystone Kops down there. &quot; Up and down the state , disgruntled parents such_as Riley have grown increasingly vocal in their criticism of the patchwork of offices that handle the difficult job of collecting child-support payments in California ' s 58 counties . They contend the agencies are unresponsive and sometimes make dramatic mistakes in calculating child-support payments . And since the agencies have prosecutorial powers from district_attorney ' s offices , law-abiding parents have sometimes found themselves being treated like Public Enemy No . 1 . &quot; Almost every father who goes_into the Family Support Division to try to prove they made the payments , to try to work it out , is treated worse than the common criminal , &quot; said Marv Chapman , vice_president for United Fathers of America . &quot; It ' s out of control. &quot; Even normally quarrelsome opponents in child-support cases -- which most often pit custodial mothers against non-custodial fathers -- find common_ground on the issue of shoddy government performance . Women ' s groups complain that when there are deadbeat_dads , the child-support programs have been ineffective at cracking_down on the offenders . As a result , many are calling_for a complete overhaul of the system , including a suggestion to shift the responsibility for child-support programs from county government to the state welfare offices or federal tax authorities . But not everyone is ready to dump the county offices that currently run the child-support show . Boosters say many of the problems are isolated issues that have been unfairly portrayed as a systemwide failure . They contend the glitches stem from the vast proliferation of child-support cases , which have more_than doubled statewide in the past five years . In Orange County , the number of child-support cases handled by the Family Support Division has skyrocketed from about 40 # 000 to almost 100 # 000 since 1989 . The rising numbers have come_in part because the state in recent years has dramatically boosted the child-support payments required from most non-custodial parents , making_it tougher for some to keep_up with the monthly payments . Leslie Frye , chief of the state ' s Office of Child_Support , sees room for improvement within the current arrangement , but cautions against going too far . &quot; We are acutely aware of the need to make the system more responsive and accessible , &quot; Frye said . &quot; But the nature of the issues we deal with -- love and hate , power and money -- means there will always be people unhappy with the system. &quot; She and others also say the system must be vigorous in collecting child-support payments because they go_a_long_way toward keeping single mothers and their children -- the fastest growing poverty group in the nation -- off of the welfare rolls . More_than half the cases handled by the family-support offices are parents on welfare . In addition , child-support officials grapple with a ballooning number of cases involving financially strapped mothers and unidentified fathers . There were more_than 70 # 000 such cases in California last year alone . By law , the agencies also must undertake collection duties requested by any parent who claims support isn ' t being paid . But many parents don ' t find it necessary to seek_out such assistance . While the state ' s Family Support Divisions handled more_than 1.8 million problem cases last year , authorities said a roughly equal number involved parents who willingly paid child_support under agreements negotiated with their spouses . For many parents targeted by the county authorities , the tactics employed by the Family Support Divisions come as a shock . They lament the ignominy of attacking their wages , the sullied credit reports and the looming liens . &quot; We keep getting letters from people who are trying to refinance their houses to get more money to make their child-support payments , but they can ' t because of these liens , &quot; said Mikki Bako Sorensen , counsel to the Assembly Judiciary Committee . &quot; Sure , there are a lot of jerks out there not paying their support , but when someone is making an effort , you ' ve got_to give them a break and give them a chance to be economically viable. &quot; Consider the case of Keith Thompson . Thompson lives in Lake Forest with his second family . Two of his children from a previous marriage live_in Idaho with his ex-wife . When Thompson ' s support was raised 400 % last March , his ex-wife took pity and agreed to accept a lesser payment . But authorities in Idaho and Orange County haven ' t been able to straighten it out . Thompson ' s paycheck is still getting docked by Orange County , even though his ex-wife hasn ' t received a support check from the county since August . The strapped former spouse , meanwhile , has now demanded that Thompson send money to keep her afloat . To make ends meet , Thompson has been working 60 to 80 hours a week on his job at a power_plant . &quot; We ' re maxed out , &quot; said Thompson ' s wife , Dianna . &quot; We ' re going_under , under , under. &quot; For others , there ' s the_matter of interest payments . The federal_government has ordered all counties to begin charging &quot; retroactive interest &quot; on overdue payments . In some cases , the interest was charged on delinquent accounts that were paid_off years ago . As a result , some absent parents have been surprised by huge bills -- some exceeding $ 10 # 000 -- for interest they never fathomed they would owe . They complain that it is as if the rules were changed at the end of the game . Women ' s rights groups have their own complaints . While agreeing with the fathers that Family Support Divisions are not performing well , they say the agencies need to do a better job of tapping support_payments from deadbeat_dads . Many women are forced to play detective and track_down the assets of a spouse . Leora Gershenzon , an attorney with Legal Services of Northern California , says the child-support agencies are unfriendly fortresses too riddled with middle managers instead of caseworkers . She also suggests the independent agencies run_by each county cost taxpayers more_than would a unified statewide program . To that end , Gershenzon has been pushing a bill introduced last year by state Sen . Teresa Hughes ( D-Inglewood ) to incorporate the county child-support offices into a single state agency . The bill has been stalled in a legislative committee , but other legislation is also being discussed to make the system more user-friendly . At the same time , boosters of the system say many of the county family support agencies are already trying to put a better face forward . &quot; Despite all_the raps you ' ve heard , I ' d say the district_attorneys in California are doing at least a B-plus job , &quot; said Wayne D . Doss , chief of the Los Angeles County child-support division and president of the National Child_Support Enforcement Organization . &quot; We face a dichotomy of expectations : On the one hand we ' re expected to be efficient and cost-effective , and at_the_same_time we ' re criticized because we ' re not as soft and warm and cuddly as people would like us to be. &quot; He and other experts from around the state have been meeting to map_out an agenda for changes to improve the system , ideas they hope will eventually be embraced by the Legislature . Meanwhile , a new automated statewide system will soon be handling mundane billing and paperwork chores , allowing caseworkers to focus more on the public . In Orange County , a study by the Price Waterhouse accounting_firm is expected to yield several suggested changes when it ' s released early next year , including some designed to improve the office ' s relationship with parents . While mistakes occur , they can often be traced directly back to the parents , whose idea of record-keeping may be &quot; a_few receipts in a shoe box , &quot; Doss said . More often than not , the two parties in a child-support dispute will tote vastly different claims . It is , Orange County child-support chief Jan Sturla said , &quot; kind of like trying to referee at the Alamo. &quot; Complaints about liens are unflinchingly common . Sturla , for one , suggests the issue has been overblown . He regularly gets calls from lending_institutions checking on loan applicants , and those who don ' t owe back support are quickly given the green_light , Sturla said . As for parents who yelp about authorities running_roughshod over their credit report , the child-support officials have little sympathy . Such matters , they reason , are no different than missing payment on a credit_card -- if you owe , you owe . Meanwhile , the new computer_system promises better billing in counties that currently don ' t issue monthly statements , keeping parents better abreast_of their child-support obligation . &quot; If Macy ' s didn ' t send me a bill each month , &quot; state chief Frye noted , &quot; I ' d be surprised to see how large it is at the end of the year. &quot; While the program has room for improvement , it has done much -- warts and all -- to help children , Frye said . &quot; I think we ' ve always got_to look_to this fundamental issue of whether a child has an absolute right for support , &quot; Frye said . &quot; I know having a large debt is a daunting thing , but I keep thinking : What about the children ? &quot; Support_System Child_support is a growth_industry in Orange County . From 1989 to 1993 , a variety of indicators increased . * The number of cases has more_than doubled , while the percentage of families receiving welfare payments jumped by about one-quarter . Cases ( In thousands ) : 99 # 000 Percent on welfare : 54 % * The number of people working in the county district_attorney ' s Family Support Division , including attorneys , increased by about 50 % , as did the average number of cases handled by caseworkers . Support division staffing : 327 Average cases per caseworker : 1 # 319 * The amount of child_support collected rose slightly more_than 50 % . In millions of dollars : $ 46 million Sources : Orange County district_attorney ' s Family Support Division ; California Office of Child_Support ; Researched by ERIC BAILEY / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
