   <HEADLINE> U.S. MAY EASE LIMITS ON TIES WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration is preparing policy_changes that will give the government of Taiwan greater leeway in dealing with the United States than it has had for 15 years , Administration officials say . The changes , which await final approval by President Clinton and could be announced in the next couple of weeks , would ease some restrictions imposed on Taiwan when the United States established diplomatic relations with its enemy , the People ' s Republic_of_China . &quot; Some of the procedures ( for dealing with Taiwan ) have become anachronistic , &quot; one Administration official said . &quot; The basic thrust of what we will do is to re-establish U.S. interests as the basis for relations with both Taiwan and China . What we ' re trying to do is establish some principles and a position we can use with both sides. &quot; The Administration ' s primary goal is to make_it easier to conduct business with Taiwan , which is now the United States ' fifth-largest trading partner and has more_than $ 80 billion in foreign-exchange reserves , second in the world behind Japan . Administration officials acknowledge that they have held_up the proposed changes to see if they can minimize the fallout from China , which still considers Taiwan a renegade province . &quot; There is still some concern here about how the Chinese will react , &quot; one U.S. official admitted . &quot; They ' re not happy with what they ' ve heard. &quot; Among the changes being proposed are : * Permitting some American Cabinet officials to visit Taiwan and some Taiwan Cabinet members to visit the United States . Although there have been exceptions , Cabinet-level visits between the two governments generally have been forbidden for 15 years on grounds that they might be interpreted as suggesting U.S. recognition of Taiwan . * Allowing Taiwan ' s offices in the United States to use an identifiable name , like &quot; Taipei Representative Office. &quot; For 15 years , Taiwan ' s offices in Washington and around the United States -- which serve as its unofficial embassy and consulates -- have been called the &quot; Coordination Council for North_American Affairs. &quot; The name is so confusing and nondescript that Taiwan officials complain they get calls intended for Alcoholics Anonymous . * Permitting Taiwan officials to meet with their American counterparts in U.S._government buildings . Since 1979 , the United States has generally required representatives of Taiwan to meet American officials in other locales , such_as hotels and restaurants , to emphasize the unofficial ties between the two governments . Despite these measures , several Administration officials cautioned that there will be no change in the fundamental_principles underlying American ties with China and Taiwan . &quot; We ' re not changing the basics of our one-China policy , &quot; one U.S. official explained . &quot; There will be no change in our views about sovereignty . . . . What we ' re trying to do is adjust the details of the relationship in ways that allow us to carry_on appropriate relations with both sides. &quot; The Nationalist government has been based in Taiwan since Gen . Chiang Kai-shek fled to the island in 1949 at the end of China ' s civil_war . Chiang claimed , with U.S. backing , that his Nationalists , rather than the Communist regime in Beijing , were the legitimate government for all_of China . But during President Richard Nixon ' s historic trip to China in 1972 , he signed the Shanghai Communique , in which the United States agreed not to challenge the idea that Taiwan was part of China . Seven years later , President Jimmy_Carter broke_off formal U.S. ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with Beijing . Since then , unofficial ties between the United States and Taiwan have been carried_out through special organizations set_up for this purpose . The United States has no embassy in Taipei but set_up the American Institute in Taiwan , staffed by foreign service officers on leaves of absence ; it performs many functions of an embassy . Similarly , Taiwan ' s offices in the United States have no formal diplomatic status . The first major changes in American policy toward Taiwan took_place in the last year of the George_Bush Administration . In the 1992 presidential campaign , Bush cleared the way for the sale of a major new weapons_system , F-16 warplanes , to Taiwan . And after the election , when he was a lame_duck , Bush dispatched U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to Taipei , the first Cabinet officer to visit since 1979 . As governor of Arkansas , Clinton visited Taiwan five times , more_than any other place outside the United States . But in his first 18 months in office , his Administration has generally held_the_line on policy toward Taiwan , arguing repeatedly that all changes were_on hold while U.S. officials conducted a broad policy review . Two months ago , the Administration was deluged with criticism from Congress when Taiwan ' s president , Lee Teng-hui , sought permission to stop overnight in Honolulu on a trip from Taipei to Central_America . The State_Department gave permission for Lee ' s plane to refuel in Hawaii but not for Lee to spend a night there ; no U.S. official was sent_out to greet Lee at the airport . Administration officials feared worsening strained relations with Beijing in the weeks leading_up to the Administration ' s decision on whether to renew China ' s trade privileges . &quot; Both China and Taiwan have been carrying_on their struggles against each other over and through us , &quot; one U.S. official said . Administration officials say there will be no change in U.S. policy concerning arms sales to Taiwan . Under an agreement signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 , the United States has agreed to limit arms sales to Taiwan to $ 800 million a year and , over some indefinite time_period , to phase_out the sales .</TEXT>
