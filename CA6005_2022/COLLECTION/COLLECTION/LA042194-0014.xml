   <HEADLINE> IN THE EYE -- OR THE MIND -- OF THE BEHOLDER ; ART : ALICE WALKER ' S CRITICISM OF THE ROBERT GRAHAM ART ECHOES THE SMALL-MINDEDNESS OF HER OWN CRITICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Novelist Alice Walker , named a &quot; state treasure , &quot; says she was shocked when she saw the award , a statuette of a nude woman ' s torso . She called it an embodiment of society ' s acceptance of the mutilation of women . But the only thing mutilated in this episode was respect for art . Walker initially was not going_to accept any award from the state for political reasons . Excerpts from her beautiful , complex and engaging stories caused a furor among religious conservatives when they appeared in a state test of student aptitude ; state educators caved and Walker was rightly maddened by the whole affair . The mess was finally resolved in a manner acceptable to Walker , and she agreed to accept the state ' s honor on behalf of those who had fought for her work based on its unmistakable merit . But she who lives_by the sword dies by the sword . &quot; Interpretation , &quot; Susan Sontag wrote , &quot; is the revenge of the intellect upon art. &quot; For several decades now , that observation , stretched well beyond art , has been the modus_operandi of our political discourse . Christian conservatives join with gay-rights advocates , the NAACP , Islamic fundamentalists and just about anyone else with a grievance against someone in mining every work_of_art and every public utterance for some mother lode of offense . And given the peevish and testy character of our age , the unavoidable complexity that runs_through both art and life provides an endless source of peas to bruise our princess-tender psyches . The paradox of Walker ' s offended sensibilities is breathtaking . The statue was designed by one of the most gifted sculptors of our time , Robert Graham . Without getting_into the fascinating and complicated beauty of his work -- now in a number of Los Angeles public areas and museums worldwide -- it should be enough to point_out that Graham ' s vision and execution are evocative precisely because they are not simple . His works elude easy explanation in exactly the ways that make Walker ' s work so brilliant -- and so troublesome to those who see art as mere propaganda . Art is large , and we are too dedicated these days to reducing it . I was appalled when the state first caved_in to the religious zealots seeking to remove a passage from Walker ' s story &quot; Roselily &quot; from the aptitude test . The excerpt was viewed_as promoting unwed motherhood , but that cramped view robbed the passage of its complexity and thus its beauty . Students could agree , disagree or a little of both with the ruminations of a pregnant young_woman just before her marriage . The passage provoked thought -- exactly the kind of thing that makes_for a good essay . Diminishing it to some kind of commercial was an aggressive act of interpretive violence , worthy of the strongest condemnation . Walker ' s reaction to Graham ' s statuette was the same kind of reductive aggression . Starting only from her own sensitivities , Walker &quot; read &quot; the statue as a &quot; message &quot; about domination and violence . But the statue contains a message only in the sense that &quot; Roselily &quot; contains a message about pregnancy before marriage or Walker ' s great novel &quot; The Color Purple &quot; contains a message about lesbianism . &quot; The Color Purple &quot; speaks_to the heart , and no featherheaded translation is needed . Perhaps , as W.H. Auden said , those to whom evil is done do evil in return . Perhaps Walker is lashing_out at other artists because her work has been the subject of so_much unfair interpretation . But hyperinterpretation is our chosen mode of artistic suicide these days . When offense is the standard , interpretation works against art with toxic efficiency . Offense is a purely subjective experience , an entirely solipsistic exercise . When it is made to appear objective -- when the offense I take is construed to be the offense anyone will take -- only the least objectionable art will make_it into the public realm . Anyone can be offended by anything . Walker may have felt offense at Graham ' s work , but if an artist cannot see how beauty transcends offense , how a work_of_art has meaning that transcends a meaning , how can we expect anyone else to ? At best , Walker was ungracious in accepting an honor the state bestows on too few genuine artists . At worst , she has given aid and comfort to those seeking to dismantle the greatness of art by turning it into a particularly pernicious branch of advertising , the better to control it through the politics of the marketplace . If Walker thought the statue was ugly , she could certainly have said so . That subjective standard is the one that applies to art . As long as Walker views Graham ' s art as advertising rather than as an aspiration to beauty , she should not complain when non-artists look_at her , too , as a propagandist rather than an artist .</TEXT>
