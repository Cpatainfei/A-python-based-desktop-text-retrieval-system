   <HEADLINE> OPERA REVIEW ; MIXED BLESSINGS IN MOZARTIAN MARRIAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some performances at the Music Center Opera soar . Others sag . As run_by Peter Hemmings in a world compromised by fiscal uncertainty , the company certainly has its ups and downs . &quot; Le Nozze di Figaro &quot; -- brilliantly conceived by Peter Hall and sensitively performed by an enlightened ensemble in 1990 -- could be counted among the ups . Everyone loved it . The production represented an uncommonly happy marriage of music and drama , an uncommonly intelligent response to the complementary needs of Mozart and his librettist , Lorenzo da Ponte , not to mention those of their theatrical source and political ally , Beaumarchais . This &quot; Figaro &quot; was a serious comedy of eros that allowed no room for intrusive gimmickry , no place for tired cliches . Tuesday night it was back at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , where quick and frequent revivals are becoming a convenient if potentially lazy way_of_life . But there were drastic differences this time . In the_pit , the baton had passed from Lawrence Foster to Markus Stenz . Most of the principals were new . Not all_the changes were for the better . The most crucial , and most damaging change , perhaps , involved the conductor . Stenz , who was undertaking his first &quot; Figaro , &quot; is a useful guide through the thickets of modernism . Anyone who has witnessed his pioneering work_on behalf of Hans Werner Henze knows that . But Henze isn ' t Mozart , and Mozart seems to bewilder the young German maestro . Perhaps he doesn ' t go_for baroque . His tempos on Tuesday were , to say the least , erratic . The fast pieces tended toward sluggishness . The relatively slow ones zipped along as if sentiment were a dirty word ( it is difficult to imagine &quot; Voi che sapete &quot; less alluring , &quot; Che soave zeffiretto &quot; less languid or &quot; Deh vieni non tardar &quot; less reflective ) . The recitatives -- particularly important in a production that stresses conversational fluidity -- tended to drag , and the exaggerated Luftpausen hardly enhanced narrative continuity . Although Stenz inspired some very pretty playing from the Los Angeles Chamber_Orchestra , it could not be claimed that he accompanied the singers with much sympathy , or that he paid much attention to matters of dramatic impetus or stylistic consistency . Appoggiaturas came and went , mostly went . The high Cs that cap the second-act terzetto were allotted to Susanna , not , as Mozart intended , to the Countess . One artist on the stage -- the Figaro -- took the trouble to add some fascinating period embellishment . The rest might just as well have been singing Verdi . The performance , as in ' 90 , was blissfully complete . It lasted 3 3 / 4 hours with , thank goodness , only one intermission instead of three . As paced by Stenz , however , it seemed dangerously long . Under the circumstances , one had to be doubly grateful for Hall ' s elegantly earnest staging scheme , again re-created -- and this time somewhat broadened -- by Stephen Lawless . One also could take comfort in the lavish , warmly realistic decors of John Bury , even though they were designed for the smaller stage of the Chicago Lyric Opera . The major holdover in the uneven cast was Thomas Allen , the intrinsically aristocratic , suavely lecherous , magnificently befuddled Almaviva . This time , unfortunately , histrionic pluses were diminished by vocal minuses , possibly the result of a respiratory problem . Solveig Kringelborn complemented him as an extraordinarily youthful , radiant , eminently seductive Rosina . The fact that the Norwegian soprano , undertaking this complex role for the first time , happened to be seven months pregnant added a_few unintended wrinkles to the dramatic intrigue ( previews of &quot; La mere coupable &quot; ? ) . Sympathetic observers gasped when she accidentally tripped and fell during an exit . Luckily , both prima_donna and Contessa turned_out to be fine . Gerald Finley , a promising lyric-baritone from Canada , introduced a sly , wide-eyed , strikingly stylish Figaro opposite a smart and winsome new Susanna , Elzbieta Szmytka . Replacing Angela Maria Blasi , the tiny Polish soprano vacillated between sweetness and squeakiness . Paula Rasmussen , a tall and gangly novice Cherubino , could hardly efface memories of her definitive predecessor , Frederica von Stade . ( Who could ? ) But she held her own nicely , especially in a plush &quot; Non so piu , cosa son , cosa faccio , &quot; never flinching from the bold priapic maneuvers invented by the stage_director . Michael Gallup returned as an amiably crusty Don Bartolo , in tandem with Suzanna Guzman ' s poignantly giddy Marcellina . Jonathan Mack repeated his bravura Basilio , and secondary roles were in the appreciative hands and larynxes of Diana Tash ( Barbarina ) , Mallory Walker ( Curzio ) and John Atkins ( Antonio ) . Francis Rizzo ' s model supertitles matched the vocal lines perfectly . And someone had the good_sense to turn them off at the Count ' s plea for forgiveness . For once , the pathos of this climactic moment was not contradicted by laughter . * &quot; Le Nozze di Figaro &quot; presented by the Music Center Opera at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion . Also Saturday at 1 p.m. , April 18 and 20 at 7:30 p.m. , April 23 at 1 p.m. and April 25 ( Richard Bernstein replacing Finley ) at 7:30 p.m. Tickets $ 20 to $ 105 at box_office , ( 213 ) 972-7211 .</TEXT>
