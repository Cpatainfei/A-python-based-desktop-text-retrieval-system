   <TEXT> Chemists are searching for a medicinal bumper crop . The National Cancer Institute is attempting to turn plants into drugs , testing as_many as 20 # 000 extracts of natural products per year . Similar efforts have yielded the cancer_drugs vincristine and vinblastine , from the rosy periwinkle plant of Madagascar , and taxol , derived from the Pacific_yew tree . &quot; Nature is still in many cases the most economical source for medicines , &quot; says Gordon Cragg , chief of natural products branch of the NCI . Cragg says 99.5 % of the world ' s plants have yet to be investigated for their medical value . The remainder has provided about a quarter of all current pharmaceuticals . &quot; You don ' t have to be a mathematician to predict that the remaining 99.5 % of plant species will have something to offer , &quot; says Michael J . Balick , director of New York Botanical Garden ' s Institute of Economic Botany . So_Much for This ' Cure ' for Colic One of the most popular treatments for infant colic doesn ' t work , according to a new study . One longstanding theory of colic -- the incessant crying of infants for reasons that can ' t be determined -- is that the babies are suffering from intestinal gas . Although this has never been proven , doctors often advise frazzled parents to give their babies simethicone , an over-the-counter medicine . One popular brand is Mylicon Drops . A study in the July issue of Pediatrics compared babies given simethicone to babies given a placebo . The result : There was no difference in the babies treated with simethicone -- even among the babies who showed &quot; gas-related symptoms. &quot; So what to do ? Sorry -- the authors note that &quot; the explanation for the excessive crying remains elusive. &quot; Put Emergency Paperwork in Its Place -- Done The likelihood of kids getting hurt increases with summertime activities . You can speed treatment in hospital emergency_rooms by doing some paperwork in_advance . Santa Monica Hospital encourages parents to sign an &quot; Authorization to Treat Minor &quot; form . California law requires written parental consent before children under 18 can receive care in an emergency_room . An authorization for treatment can also help anyone else who ' s looking_after your children . The form is kept until the child turns 18 . Call ( 800 ) 922-1002 to obtain the form . Briefly . . . Doctors are making house calls again , with shopping_bags in lieu of the traditional black medical bag to foil drug_addicts . . . Arizona has been supplanted as the pollen-free turf by towns in middle Siberia , which have algae and lichen but no pollinating plants or dust mites . . . Cleveland Clinic counsels newlyweds to work_out nutrition and healthy diets directly after the honeymoon to avoid square-meal squabbling later on .</TEXT>
