   <HEADLINE> BOUCHARD ' S WIFE WAS RAISED IN ORANGE COUNTY ; UNPOLITICAL : SHE IS A SELF-DESCRIBED ' NAVY BRAT ' FROM LOS ALAMITOS WITH A FRENCH MOTHER AND AN AMERICAN FATHER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Lucien Bouchard seems the unconventional politician , then Audrey Best Bouchard is the equally unconventional political wife . Born in France on the Cote d ' Azur to a French mother and American father and raised a &quot; Navy brat &quot; in Los Alamitos , she holds both U.S. and French passports , but not Canadian citizenship . This means she can ' t vote for her husband . While she has campaigned with him in Quebec , she is no fan of the numerous political dinners , meetings and other events that can quickly fill his schedule , and she avoids many of them . Audrey Bouchard rarely gives interviews , and the Canadian press seems unsure what to make of her . Often , writers here fall_back on Southern California cliches , with_references_to her blond hair or labeling her the &quot; Valley Girl &quot; ( though she never lived_in the San Fernando Valley ) . With barely suppressed dismay , Bouchard declines to discuss in detail her depiction by Canada ' s press : &quot; I guess they ' ve portrayed me the way they see me , but it ' s not always the way I see myself . . . . I don ' t mean to complain about their attention , but I would prefer to be completely out , really. &quot; She laughs , however , at well-meaning friends who lament what they assume is her lonely life with two children in Montreal while her husband works in Parliament in Ottawa . &quot; I would say I ' m very independent , first off , and . . . I enjoy my solitude immensely . . . . I have two small children , and that ' s difficult , of course , raising my children when I ' m alone a lot , but when I put the kids to bed and I ' m all alone in the house , I ' m very happy , &quot; she says . She is a booster of life in Quebec , extolling the charms and ease of living in Montreal . But she concedes there is much about Southern California that she misses &quot; terribly , &quot; mainly family , friends and , in the depths of a Canadian winter , the weather . Her family moved to Orange County when she was 2 , after her father , James Best , a U.S. Navy officer , was transferred from his Mediterranean posting . When they arrived in the United States , Bouchard ' s mother , Marie-Josee Massay , spoke little English . Though she subsequently learned , to this day she speaks_to her daughter in French , and Bouchard replies in English . There ' s a similar bilingual pattern developing with the Bouchards ' sons , Alexandre , 4 , and Simon , 3 . While French is the predominant language at_home , Audrey Bouchard spent the spring working to improve her children ' s English , so they could more easily make friends this summer while visiting her parents in Laguna Hills . After graduating from high_school , Audrey attended Cypress College for a year , then went_to work_at McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach . In 1986 , with her first marriage to her high_school sweetheart ended , she quit and traveled for a year . While flying from Paris to London for a connecting flight to California , she dropped a magazine into the aisle . The man in the seat across from her picked it up and struck_up a conversation . He was , he told her , Lucien Bouchard , a Canadian diplomat in Paris headed to Calgary on business . He asked her to breakfast in the London airport while they waited for their respective flights , but she hesitated . &quot; I was real leery , &quot; she recalls , &quot; I didn ' t know this gentleman at all. &quot; She did give him her California address , and it wasn ' t until the first letter arrived that she learned he was Canada ' s ambassador to France . When she moved to Paris to live with her grandmother and perfect her French , they began dating . Two years later , they were married . Never personally involved in politics , Audrey Bouchard admittedly had a difficult time understanding why her husband would want to leave the ambassadorship and , at Prime_Minister Brian Mulroney ' s request , return to Canada to run_for Parliament . &quot; But I could see he was very tempted by it , and he had already been over two years in Paris and was ready to move_on , &quot; she says . &quot; I didn ' t try to dissuade him. &quot; The couple have stolidly accepted his up-and-down political career since , the explosive controversy he provokes and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police bodyguard assigned to him . In separate interviews , they expressed very similar sentiments : This is the life we ' ve chosen . It comes_with risks as well as opportunities . It ' s worth it . Let ' s get_on_with it . The one resentment they both admit to is the separation from the children enforced on Lucien Bouchard by his career . The result , Audrey Bouchard said , is that , when he is home , the children &quot; have the run of the house , everything . . . . It ' s pure fun , and that ' s OK , because it ' s so rare. &quot;</TEXT>
