   <HEADLINE> NEW REGULATORY GUIDELINES DUE ON LENDER DISCRIMINATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After months of heated negotiations , regulators are set to spell_out precisely what lending behavior they consider discriminatory , providing guidance to banks and thrifts on how to avoid government investigations . Regulators are expected to release today a joint policy statement on lending discrimination.The document will address issues such_as how lending data will be evaluated , what lending patterns will be referred to the Justice_Department for investigation and how regulators will respond to industry self-testing . It is also expected to address how regulators will scrutinize various bank policies -- such_as underwriting standards -- in investigating possible discrimination . The 21-page statement , while not carrying the force of law , will nonetheless be recognized by 10 federal agencies as the definition of discrimination in their efforts to enforce fair-lending laws . It will provide the most explicit notice to date of the practices bankers must employ to avert government investigations of illegal lending discrimination . Negotiations on the breadth of the plan have continued up_to the last minute and have worked their way up_to the highest levels of the agencies . Earlier drafts of the statement included much more strenuous requirements , which probably would have engendered industry cries of micro-management and credit allocation . Much of the harshest language was deleted after strong opposition by Federal_Reserve_Board officials . Drafting of the document comes_after repeated complaints from bankers that the agencies are stepping_up enforcement of fair-lending laws without spelling_out the ground_rules . For example , bankers have complained that they do not understand what credit decisions , underwriting standards and lending patterns constitute illegal discrimination .</TEXT>
