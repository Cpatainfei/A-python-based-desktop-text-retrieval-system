   <TEXT> I am entirely satisfied with the U.S. Postal Service . I find the employees capable , friendly and efficient . The current and proposed costs are fair and less than in any country I have traveled in.My recent unhappy postal experience was with a private carrier . NORMAN E . WOLLITZ El Cajon * It appears that we citizens are again victims of a Catch-22 . Postal rates are rising again ! This in the face of highly increased e-mail and fax usage . Although postal_services will always be required , these technological tools should help reduce the physical load on the Postal Service . In addition , aggressive marketing by private carriers have reduced the small-package handling requirements at the Postal Service . Still there has been no effort made to reduce personnel . We all have experienced similar situations before . During the energy crisis , we were asked to reduce the use of electricity . We did and were rewarded with increased rates because the power_companies debt obligations remained the same . Likewise , with the drought . We reduced water consumption and the rates were again increased for the same reason . We must add_to the vocabulary of these agencies : downsize . SAMUEL ZUCKERMAN West Los Angeles</TEXT>
