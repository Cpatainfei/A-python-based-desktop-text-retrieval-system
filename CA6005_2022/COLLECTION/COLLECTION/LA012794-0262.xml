   <TEXT> After 22 years of teaching , the promotion of Nasr Hamid abu Zaid , a professor of Arabic literature and one of Egypt ' s best-known intellectuals , seemed a sure bet . Two fellow professors evaluated him and complimented his many papers and books on Islamic discourse . They recommended him for a full professorship at prestigious Cairo University . But a third scholar was troubled by Abu Zaid ' s assertions that the texts of the Koran , the holy book of Islam , should be studied in light of the men who had interpreted them . Such talk is &quot; similar to atheism , &quot; this evaluator warned . Abu Zaid was denied his professorship . Denouncing him as a heretic became a cause_celebre at mosques throughout Egypt . Then , last fall , he found himself served with divorce papers . They were not filed by his wife , a fellow Cairo University professor and one of his greatest admirers , but by a lawyer who argued that a Muslim woman protected under Egyptian law should not remain married to an apostate . &quot; Before the court case , I thought we were living_in a modern civil society , &quot; said Abu Zaid , whose divorce will be decided in a Cairo courtroom today . &quot; When we heard about the case , my wife and I were shocked . We thought it was some sort of black joke . We were amazed to learn something like this is permitted under the Egyptian legal_code . &quot; Now , we realize the whole issue is intended to make me stop writing and teaching , &quot; he continued . &quot; To make me silent -- whether by this deprivation of promotion , or by the loss of my wife , or by death . The intention is to stop the critical mind -- a battle intellectuals thought was won 100 years ago. &quot; The Arab world , which brought civilization the beginnings of mathematics and astronomy and the greatest library of all time , is in a state of ideological peril . It has become the victim of dwindling educational resources , religious fundamentalism and a general intellectual confusion that has left much of the developing world searching for its place in the new_world order , experts say . In Egypt -- historically the Arab cultural heart and a teeming center for entertainment and media -- intellectuals and artists are locked_in a war with religious conservatives who are seeking to hold all books , magazines , plays and paintings to a strict religious standard . Financing from conservative Arab Gulf states has hamstrung Egypt ' s famed film and publishing industries . In Algeria , long considered a land of deep , often avant-garde thinkers , writers and intellectuals have been the target of a massive assassination campaign by Islamic fundamentalists . Most have been forced into exile or hiding . A noted sociologist and think_tank director had his throat slit in front of his family . Many of Algiers ' remaining intellectuals have left their homes and are living under army guard in a compound outside the capital . Many of the region ' s most important media outlets -- including the respected Al Hyat and Al Shark el Awsat newspapers and the influential Middle_East Broadcasting Center satellite television_station -- are now owned by powerful Saudis close to Saudi_Arabia ' s royal_family . The takeover of these media is part of a wave of such acquisitions by wealthy Saudis in recent years ; the trend is spreading the ultraconservative Gulf ' s influence throughout the important media centers of the Arab world . The debate over religious fundamentalism , raging in cultural centers from Kuwait to Morocco , emerges against a backdrop of unease that has beset the Arab intelligentsia since the Arabs ' crushing defeat by Israel in 1967 . It worsened with the Persian_Gulf_War in 1991 -- a military setback that spelled an even more important loss in the ideological underpinnings of pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism upon which the Arab world had comfortably rested for most of this century . &quot; I am trying my utmost to understand the scope of the crisis that has afflicted Arab thought since the defeat in the 1967 war , &quot; said Mohamed Hassanein Heikal , one of Egypt ' s best-known writers and a confidant of former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser . In a rare interview in his sunny office overlooking the Nile , Heikal predicted that the ideological vacuum in the Arab world will open the door to a new era of Israeli domination -- in a new Middle Eastern market , in a new period of &quot; peace without justice &quot; negotiated by Arabs out of weakness . &quot; One of the intellectual crises in the Arab world is that we are dealing now in fluids and gases , &quot; Heikal observed . &quot; We are still unable to find either an inspiration for our hopes or a target for our anger . When President Bush talked_about a new_world order , we accepted it as a final solution , not realizing it was only an experiment , an idea . &quot; The Israeli era that is coming will be brief , &quot; he predicted . &quot; But it will last until the Arab nation finds itself and returns back to a new_world , not a world based on the end of history , nor an Islamic paradise -- something different . But we haven ' t found that something different yet , and that is the crisis of the Arab intelligentsia. &quot; Arab intellectuals in recent times have struggled to find a way of understanding themselves and their place in the world . They have been hit by a triple whammy : * The collapse of the Soviet_Union , which had backed radical regimes in Iraq , Libya , Syria and Egypt off and on through the years . * An Arab world turned against itself and the West with Iraq ' s invasion of Kuwait . * And a new peace between Palestinians and Israel that many still regard_as suspect and ill advised . These developments have plunged Arab thinkers into turmoil : Many erstwhile Marxist intellectuals are now card-carrying Islamic fundamentalists ; they find in political Islam a way of asserting a nationalist identity without having to align themselves with the world ' s new emerging powers . &quot; The Arab nationalist movement and the Islamic reform_movement have been intertwined for at least 100 years -- but now they are part of a more general and ambitious process of intellectual and political self-questioning , &quot; Edward Said , a leading Palestinian intellectual , wrote recently . &quot; What is modernity for a Muslim ? What is our heritage ? Who has and ought to have authority ? These are major epistemological problems that now occupy a lot of attention among intellectuals and scholars. &quot; In Cairo , Mahgoub Omer , one of Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat ' s most steadfast advisers and a longtime leftist , now writes a weekly column for the Islamic biweekly Al Shaab . &quot; Those who are trying to differentiate among the intellectuals in our nation , I think , make a big mistake , if they forget that all_the people here are Muslims , &quot; he said in an interview . &quot; Even the ( Christian ) Copts are Muslim in tradition and culture . We have a reference ideology , which is Islam . We see that Islam gives us our morals , our ethics , our red_lines not to cross , our dreams , our life. &quot; Yet the dilemma for many Arab intellectuals is that Islamic philosophies have the past as their point_of_reference ; this is a difficult matter at a time when the Arabs ' future is very much in doubt . &quot; Intellectuals are placed in a very difficult situation , &quot; said Egyptian leftist Mohammed Sid Ahmed . &quot; Either they espouse Enlightenment philosophies and then feel they ' re not on the wavelength of the people -- who are caught_up in the problems of joblessness , economic problems , deep frustration , the feeling of being manipulated rather than being master of your fate -- or else they try to rationalize the Islamic movement . . . which is not an intellectual movement at all . It is a religious_movement that has become a source of ideology , faute de mieux ( for want of something better ) . Enlightened intellectuals , if they are honest , they are torn apart. &quot; Against a backdrop of Islamic and nationalist values , Arab intellectuals are trying to make_sense of the Gulf War . Was it a defeat for pan-Arab pride , because it called_in the West to crush the Arabs ' only remaining military power ? A victory for a new_world order that protects democracy and shuns aggression ? And if the latter , among the oppressive sheikdoms and military-backed regimes that populate the Arab world from east to west , where is there a democratic Arab regime that is part of this new_world order ? In his &quot; Cruelty and Silence , &quot; a book that has created a firestorm in Arab coffee_shops , Kanan Makiya , an exiled Iraqi writer , bitterly indicts Arab intellectuals for defending Saddam Hussein ' s tyrannical Iraqi regime in the name of tired nationalist slogans while remaining silent about the Arab Baath Socialist_Party regime ' s slaughter of Kurds and Shiites in uprisings in Iraq after the Gulf War . &quot; In the wake of the mountain of bodies created by the Lebanese civil_war , the Iranian revolution , the Iraq-Iran War and the Gulf War , there can be no more romance and no more false heroics in the Arab world , &quot; Makiya said . &quot; There is only a legacy of pain which must be grappled with by a new language and a new style. &quot; Yet Arab artists and writers say they have often found themselves powerless to speak out against the oppression around them because they are caught in a dragnet , not only of religious conservatism but of state censorship ; in the name of religious values , interference by the state often stifles critical political discourse . Omar Belhouchet , publisher of Algeria ' s lively Al Watan newspaper , was shot at by suspected Islamic militants last year and escaped only by ducking in his car and gunning the accelerator . But the government arrested him and held him for several days , and it has detained several other journalists . In Egypt , intellectuals have been reeling for weeks from a parliamentary debate that began when a national assembly member condemned the minister of culture for several publications , one of which included a famous painting by Gustav Klimt of Adam and Eve and another an erotic Indian poem in which a woman entreats her lover to stand naked in front of the mirror with her to see that he is stronger . ( Female deputies were asked to leave the room before the debate began. ) The minister responded , to the horror of some media commentators , by defending the works in_question but assuring the floor that all publications of the government are cleared first by Azhar University , the conservative seat of Islamic learning . Cairo intellectuals debated calling a protest_march but decided it would probably be quashed by security-conscious authorities . They settled for a statement of protest . But many have complained that , as in Algeria , Arab governments , and not just religious conservatives , are often part of the problem . Adel Hussein , editor of Al Shaab , has been called_in for questioning in Egypt recently . Islamic fundamentalists in Saudi_Arabia were arrested last year when they attempted to launch a human_rights group critical of the government . The dispute went uncovered in the widely circulated Al Hyat or Al Shark el Awsat , owned by wealthy Saudis and published in London . It also attracted no attention from the Egyptian media , which when it is government-controlled responds slavishly to Egyptian officials ' restrictions and when it is privately owned follows the dictates of the lucrative Saudi market . Rose el Youssef , an upstart Egyptian weekly magazine , was recently banned in Saudi_Arabia , a move that must have been a severe financial blow . But it was the same magazine that , in a recent controversy in Egypt over cultural and artistic restrictions , last week published several banned works that had never appeared in print in the Arab world . These included : * Excerpts from Salman Rushdie ' s &quot; Satanic Verses , &quot; which earned their author a death sentence from Iran ' s late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini . * &quot; A Thousand and One Arabian Nights , &quot; portions of which , believe it or not , have long been banned as risque . * An Egyptian novel by Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz that contains allegorical passages deemed irreverent about the Prophet Mohammed . * A forbidden poem from the Arab world ' s most popular poet , Syrian writer Nizzar Kabbany . The poem , &quot; Father of Ignorance Buys Fleet_Street , &quot; talks_about the Saudis ' feverish purchase of media -- publishing_houses , magazines , newspapers and television_stations ; this has been one of the biggest irritants to writers and filmmakers in Egypt , Lebanon , Syria and North Africa . The cultural elite in the heart of the Arab world sees its artistic heritage being sold to oil barons whose cultural interests , in the main , are to protect the wealthy ruling families of the Gulf and maintain strict Islamic values . &quot; We are in the middle of the process of buying_up our culture , &quot; said Mursi Saad Din , former undersecretary of culture and cultural editor of the Cairo newspaper Ahram Weekly . &quot; At the last Cairo film festival , not a single Egyptian film won a prize . The two prizes went_to films that were co-productions , Palestinian and Syrian , but co-produced from outside , which means they cannot in a true sense be considered Arab films . . . . In my view , it is an orchestrated campaign against culture in Egypt. &quot; Wrote Kabbany : Long life for you , You that buy women by the pound And buy pens by the pound . We don ' t want anything from you . Sleep_with your slave women as you please . Slaughter your dependents as you please . Blockade the nation with fire and steel . No one wants to take_away your happy monarch . No one wants to steal your khalifa ' s headband . So drink the oil wine to its end , And leave culture to us .</TEXT>
