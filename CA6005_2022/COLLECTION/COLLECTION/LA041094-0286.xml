   <HEADLINE> MARRIAGE STANDS THE TEST OF TIME AND SPANS 2 CONTINENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In preparation for their parents ' recent wedding_anniversary , Chan-Yong Kim and his brother and sister decided to look_up the traditional names associated with anniversaries . The list says silver for the 25th anniversary , then gold for the 50th . If a couple makes_it to 60 years , it ' s their diamond anniversary . But what about after that ? &quot; No one knew the name for the 75th anniversary , &quot; Kim said . &quot; I guess no one figured that any couple would be married beyond 60 years. &quot; Well , on March 26 , Kim ' s father , Jae-Ok Kim , and mother , Ok-Sun Kim , of Koreatown celebrated a union that has spanned three-quarters of a century and two continents . &quot; I don ' t remember ever having a fight , &quot; said Ok-Sun Kim , who at 87 is a year older than her husband . &quot; The main thing is that we respect each other , always try to understand each other ' s situation and give rather than take. &quot; As was the custom at the time in their native Korea , the marriage was arranged by the couple ' s parents . She was 12 , he was 11 . &quot; In those days , parents made the arrangements so as not to lose the opportunity for having a good son-in-law or a good daughter-in-law , &quot; explained Chan-Yong Kim , 60 , the couple ' s eldest child . &quot; Even before their children were born , friends often said , ' Let ' s get them married. ' &quot; After the wedding , the couple lived at his parents ' house near the city of Kaesong , then part of a unified Korea and now in North_Korea . They didn ' t live together as husband and wife until they were in their 20s , Chan-Yong Kim said . Jae-Ok Kim ' s job as a construction contractor took him all_over Korea and China , so his wife kept_up the house , tended the family farm and took_care of her husband ' s eight siblings as well as their own three children . With the outbreak of the Korean_war , the family fled to the port city of Inchon and then moved to Seoul , South_Korea , in the late 1950s . In 1973 , the couple moved to the United States to be with their children , who had left South_Korea to continue their educations and pursue careers in Southern California . Although they enjoyed being around their three children and eight grandchildren , the couple wanted friends their own age , so they moved_into an apartment_building in Koreatown where they became active in the Korean senior_citizens ' association and their local church . Over the years , Jae-Ok Kim has given lectures to schoolchildren about Korean philosophy and culture , practiced calligraphy and studied English . &quot; He ' s worn_out a_couple_of Korean-English dictionaries , &quot; his son said . &quot; And even though all his children wear glasses , he still doesn ' t need them. &quot; Chan-Yong Kim said his father is somewhat conservative while his mother &quot; has a more liberated side . It ' s a good blending. &quot; Unlike many older Korean couples , the Kims can occasionally be seen holding hands when they walk down the street , said Kyung-Yong Kim , their second son . &quot; God gave us health and happiness and we ' ve enjoyed our time together , &quot; said Ok-Sun Kim , the more talkative of the two . Chan-Yong Kim , who runs a tae_kwon_do school in Cerritos , sees his parents as role_models for younger couples : &quot; Maybe times aren ' t always happy , but when an unfavorable situation develops , rather than saying , ' The heck with it , ' there ' s always a way to reconcile the situation and work things out. &quot; The family invited about 300 guests to the anniversary celebration at a Koreatown restaurant , but an additional 100 well-wishers showed_up after local Korean-language newspapers ran stories about the couple . The Guinness Book of World_Records lists two couples who were married for 86 years , so the Kims have a goal to set their sights on . In the meantime , Ok-Sun Kim has a simple plan : &quot; After all these years , my responsibility is to continue to love my husband , never hurt his feelings and and make_sure he eats well. &quot;</TEXT>
