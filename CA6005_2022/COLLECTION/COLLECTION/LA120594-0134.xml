   <HEADLINE> A NEW MODEL FOR GOVERNMENT-BIG 3 RELATIONS ? ; CAR SAFETY : THE GM DISPUTE HAD THE POTENTIAL TO POISON THE GOODWILL CLINTON HAS NURTURED WITH THE AUTO INDUSTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Oct . 18 , John F . Smith , chief_executive of General Motors Corp. , snubbed President Clinton by refusing to attend a ceremony celebrating the one-year anniversary of the government-industry effort to build a &quot; super car. &quot; The reason : He was upset by Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena ' s &quot; initial &quot; decision the day before that GM ' s C / K 1973-87 pickup_trucks had a safety defect and should be recalled . On Friday , Pena backed_away from that earlier finding and signed an unprecedented agreement with GM . Under the settlement , the government will drop its recall effort and GM will provide $ 51 million for safety programs . A recall could have cost the nation ' s No . 1 auto_maker more_than $ 1 billion , seriously damaged its reputation and resulted in more lawsuits and higher settlements in the 50 or more cases already pending . &quot; This was a clear win for GM , &quot; an industry official in Washington said . &quot; Pena backed down. &quot; Pena , however , portrayed the decision as a victory for the public , arguing that GM ' s money will be used to save more lives immediately than could have been accomplished if he just closed the case or pursued a costly and uncertain recall in the courts . Pena also said the decision was his alone . But industry and government sources said there almost certainly was pressure from the White_House , which had received a flood of complaints from Congress and industry . Indeed , the safety dispute had the potential to poison the good relations Clinton has for the past two years nurtured with the auto industry , which is creating the jobs and revenue fueling the economy . And in the wake of strong Republican gains in the midterm elections , the White_House can ill afford to alienate an industry that has backed its health_care and trade_policies . &quot; The Pena thing cast serious doubts about whether the very-much-improved relationship with the Administration would continue , &quot; a GM spokesman said . To the surprise of many , Clinton has pursued cooperation over confrontation with the auto industry in his first two years in office . Most important , industry officials feel they are being heard and understood in Washington for the first time in decades . A year ago , the Big Three and the federal_government committed themselves to a 10-year effort to work together to produce a super car -- an affordable non-polluting vehicle that could get_up to 80 miles per gallon of gas . While the super-car research is going_forward , the Administration appears to be satisfied to not push for higher fuel-economy standards . The Administration is also seeking an industry-backed compromise on electric vehicles in the Northeast . The auto industry is a strong backer of Clinton ' s ill-fated health_care reform package . In trade , Detroit was disappointed that recent talks did not produce an agreement with Japan on auto and auto parts , but believes that the Administration ' s efforts will result in_progress next year . Although there are disagreements on some things , none is as controversial as the safety dispute between GM and Pena . The industry united on the issue , which it believed could create a bad precedent and regulatory turmoil . The concern was evident at the super-car ceremony as top officials of the Big Three talked with Clinton and Vice_President Al Gore as they stood on the dais before the proceedings began . &quot; They were asking what the hell happened , &quot; an industry lobbyist said . &quot; The President seemed surprised and was apologetic. &quot; The dispute is one of the most complex and emotional to face the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration since its creation in 1966 , a year after consumer activist Ralph Nader wrote his seminal book &quot; Unsafe at Any Speed. &quot; The agency began a defect investigation in 1992 after the Center for Auto Safety asked_for a recall . The center said the vehicles were defective because the gas_tanks were located outside the frame rails and could explode when involved in side-impact crashes . GM steadfastly maintained that the pickups were safe and met all federal safety standards . Under the Chevrolet and GMC nameplates , the company sold 9 million C / K pickups with side-mounted tanks before the vehicles were redesigned in 1988 with the tanks inside the frame . About 5 million C / K pickups with side-mounted gas_tanks are still on_the_road . The battle became a brawl in which GM aggressively took_on not only the nation ' s top transportation official , but also trial_lawyers , consumer advocates and the media . Most safety issues involving autos are resolved between the manufacturer and regulators without litigation . Since the NHTSA ' s creation , only eight recall orders have been challenged , with the agency winning in all but one . The GM case has been highly publicized since late 1992 , when a federal judge in Texas unsealed 70 # 000 pages of GM documents submitted in a product-liability case . Among them was a memo that Clarence Ditlow , Center for Auto Safety president and one of GM ' s sharpest critics , argues proves that GM knew the dangers of the design in the early ' 70s but resisted changing it until 1988 . Not long afterward , the TV_program &quot; Dateline NBC &quot; aired a critical report that purported to show GM pickups erupting into flames when hit in the side . The next month a Georgia jury awarded $ 105 million to the parents of Shannon Moseley , who died at 17 when his C / K pickup burst into flames after being broadsided . The award included $ 101 million in punitive damages , which jurors later said was intended as a message to GM to recall the vehicles . Instead , the auto_maker went_on the offensive . In a bravura performance at a January , 1993 , press_conference , GM Executive_Vice_President Harry Pearce methodically showed how &quot; Dateline NBC &quot; had rigged crash tests by using toy rockets to ignite fires . The network retracted the story . The company also appealed the Moseley decision , and an appeals court overturned it in June , 1994 , saying the plaintiffs ' attorney had improperly introduced evidence of other deaths and the NHTSA investigation . The case was returned to the lower courts for a retrial . GM refused a NHTSA request for a voluntary recall in April , 1993 . The agency continued its investigation , with engineers reviewing more_than 400 # 000 pages of documents , conducting crash tests and doing extensive statistical analyses . By September , 1993 , the agency ' s staff had decided that the vehicles should not be recalled . Charles Gauthier , former director of NHTSA ' s office of defect investigation , said his staff concluded that although GM pickups posed a slightly greater safety risk of fire-related fatalities than Ford or Chrysler pickups in side-impact crashes , the risks were not &quot; unreasonable &quot; when compared to the performances of other cars and trucks . They recommended that the case be closed . No action was taken by Pena for more_than a year . In his initial decision , Pena rejected the NHTSA recommendation and instead found that C / K pickups were defective and did pose an unreasonable safety risk . Pena said 150 people had died in fiery collisions in the C / K pickups and that 32 more would die in subsequent years . He said that even though GM knew the side-mounted fuel-tank design was dangerous , it placed &quot; sales over safety. &quot; Pena also said that even though the GM pickups met all federal safety standards , the manufacturer still had an obligation to produce vehicles that operate safely in real-world conditions . GM was outraged by the decision . Spokesman Bruce MacDonald declared the decision &quot; totally unjustified &quot; and called the suggestion that GM put sales of ahead of safety &quot; outrageous and wrong. &quot; Company officials said statistics show that C / K pickups are as safe as comparable Ford and Chrysler trucks and that all are about twice as safe as the average passenger_car . They note that more_than 50 other vehicles also use designs that place the gas_tank outside the frame . Besides the legal and scientific arguments , there was an emotional side to this debate that GM feared . NHTSA had scheduled a public meeting for Dec . 6 on the C / K pickup at which more_than 30 burn victims or their relatives planned to appear . GM sought to have the meeting canceled , and when that failed , it negotiated with the agency over the format . It was during those discussions last week that the settlement talks began . The agreement was reached early Friday and the meeting canceled . &quot; This settlement will save hundreds of lives -- far more_than ever have been saved by proceeding with a recall or closing the case , &quot; Pena said in a press_conference in Washington . But consumer groups harshly criticized the agreement as &quot; unprincipled and irresponsible. &quot; They vowed to fight it in court . The agreement requires GM to help fund a government fire safety research laboratory ; contribute to research for burn and trauma victims , crash-test dummies and drunk-driving , and to expend $ 8 million for child safety seats for the poor . Pena said the settlement is an opportunity to improve auto safety through government and industry cooperation , and he took great pains to absolve Smith and other current GM executives of any taint in this case . &quot; I have said a number of times the new management team in Detroit is a far more thoughtful group of leaders perhaps than many , many years ago , when safety wasn ' t as high a priority as it is today , &quot; Pena said .</TEXT>
