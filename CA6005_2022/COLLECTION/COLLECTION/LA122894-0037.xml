   <TEXT> TELEVISION Sexual Harassment Findings : Lewd remarks , suggestive touching and other forms of sexual_harassment are routine on network television , say University of Dayton researchers who studied sitcoms from ABC , CBS , NBC and Fox . The study , which examined 26 sitcoms that aired on the networks in October and November of 1990 ( prior to the confirmation_hearings for then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas ) , classified 40 % of the 307 incidents of sexual behavior shown on the programs as sexual_harassment . The researchers based their findings on a legal definition of sexual_harassment : unwelcome sexual behavior , which was manifested as sexual remarks , looks and gestures ; kissing , touching or grabbing in a sexual manner ; date requests and violations of personal space . &quot; We were very surprised to discover there is a good_deal &quot; of sexual_harassment on television , said Thomas Skill , an associate_professor of communications . &quot; More importantly , it is presented in such a way to make_it seem acceptable. &quot; All four networks declined to comment on the study . * Going On Hiatus : ABC is taking its Sunday night comedy &quot; On Our Own &quot; off the schedule until March , at which time the show will return with a new cast member . Former &quot; In Living Color &quot; regular T ' Keyah Crystal Keymah will play a &quot; spirited contractor &quot; who agrees to make repairs_to the Jerrico family home_in lieu of rent . The series , which has struggled in the ratings but nonetheless been picked_up for a full 22-episode season , will have a special airing tonight at 8:30 , then will return to its regular Sunday 7:30 p.m. spot in March . In the interim , ABC will air &quot; classic episodes &quot; of &quot; America ' s Funniest Home Videos &quot; in that time_slot . * Station Switch : The hit weekday syndicated program &quot; A Current Affair &quot; and its companion weekend edition &quot; A Current Affair : Extra &quot; will move from KTTV / Fox Channel 11 to KNBC Channel 4 starting on Monday . Channel 4 will air &quot; A Current Affair &quot; ( hosted by Penny Daniels ) at 7:30 p.m. , replacing the syndicated version of &quot; The Price Is Right. &quot; Meanwhile , Channel 11 , which aired &quot; A Current Affair &quot; at 11:30 p.m. , will fill the void with episodes of the 1970s series &quot; MASH , &quot; creating a two-episode block of the award-winning comedy on weeknights from 11:30 p.m.-12:30 a.m. * Schedule Changes : KCAL Channel 9 is switching around several of its daytime talk programs . Starting Monday &quot; The Marilyn Kagan Show &quot; will move to 2 p.m.-3 p.m. weekdays , a change that is being previewed this week , when the show airs in both the old 9 a.m. and the new 2 p.m. time_slots . Meanwhile , &quot; Judge for Yourself , &quot; which previously aired at 2 p.m. , moved this week to the 11 a.m.-noon slot previously occupied by &quot; Susan Powter &quot; and the canceled &quot; Jones and Jury. &quot; Starting Monday Powter ' s show will air at 9 a.m. , followed by the comedy &quot; 227. &quot; * Miller Time : To Leslie Uggams , former TV_star Mitch Miller is much more_than the maestro of the sing-along . Miller discovered Uggams and stuck_by her when times could have gotten_tough . that ' s why she ' ll present him with the Congress of Racial Equality ' s lifetime achievement award at a dinner in New York Jan . 16 . A year after Miller saw Uggams as a game-show contestant , his &quot; Sing Along With Mitch &quot; went_on the air , and he asked her to make a guest appearance . She became a regular on the show , which ran_on NBC from January , 1961 , to September , 1966 , even though some stations in the South refused to air the programs with Uggams , who is black . &quot; Mitch was told either I go or the show goes , &quot; Uggams told the New York Times . &quot; He said , ' Either she stays or there ' s no show. ' . . . To do that was heroic. &quot; POP / ROCK Singing for Hunger Relief : Stevie Wonder will spend New Year ' s Eve kicking_off his national &quot; Charge Against Hunger / Natural Wonder Tour &quot; at Detroit ' s Fox Theatre .
