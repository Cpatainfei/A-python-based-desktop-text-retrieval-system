   <HEADLINE> HUNGER STRIKERS TO PROTEST FORCED RETURN OF HAITIANS ; POLICY : LOS ANGELES RELIGIOUS , POLITICAL AND CIVIC LEADERS TO HOLD ONE-DAY FAST TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A broad coalition of Los Angeles religious , political and civic_leaders said Wednesday that it will hold a one-day hunger_strike today to protest President Clinton ' s policy of sending Haitian refugees back to the embattled nation . The protest , which will be joined by people in several other major cities , is designed to show solidarity with Randall Robinson , the executive_director of the Washington-based TransAfrica foundation who recently ended a 27-day hunger_strike directed against the forced repatriation of Haitians . &quot; The average person has got_to take a moral stand , &quot; said the Rev . Louis Chase of Lynwood , who recently visited Haiti . &quot; We are an interdependent world. &quot; From religious_leaders to immigrant-rights activists to members of the City_Council , several dozen local activists argued that Clinton ' s policy of preventing boatloads of Haitians from reaching U.S. shores is flawed and racist . &quot; Once again , we are shutting the door based on color , &quot; said Angelo Ancheta of the Coalition for Humane Immigration Reform of Los Angeles . Thousands of Haitians have fled by boat since the military ousted the country ' s first democratically elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , in a September , 1991 , coup . Until last weekend , the Clinton_Administration ' s policy was to block these would-be refugees at_sea and return them to Haiti for consideration of their applications for political asylum . Often , those returned were met on the docks by Haitian officials . On Sunday , Clinton modified the policy , saying intercepted Haitians would soon be interviewed on board ship about their eligibility for political asylum . In a letter to the President , the local group expressed concern about statements by some Clinton aides that the Administration expects that 90 % to 95 % of all interdicted Haitians will still be returned to Haiti . City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas introduced a motion Wednesday urging the city to stop doing business with U.S. companies that operate in Haiti . The group members also called_for a public boycott of those companies , which include manufacturers of baseballs , electronic goods and clothes . Among those who joined in opposing the policy were council_members Jackie Goldberg , Mike Hernandez , Nate Holden and Rita Walters ; the Rev . Cecil R . Murray of First African Methodist Episcopal Church ; Joe Hicks , executive_director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , and Ramona Ripston , executive_director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California .</TEXT>
