   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA STRIKES BACK AT U.S. , EXPELS DIPLOMAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Russia ' s first diplomatic tiff with Washington since the Cold_War ' s end , Moscow expelled a senior American diplomat Monday in retaliation for last week ' s ouster of a Russian envoy from the United States . The Russian Foreign Ministry identified diplomat James L . Morris , listed as a counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow , as the CIA station chief here . Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin expressed regret over the incident but said Moscow was &quot; forced &quot; to respond to the &quot; unjust &quot; expulsion Friday of Alexander I . Lysenko , the suspected Russian intelligence chief in Washington , in connection with the Ames espionage affair . CIA official Aldrich H . Ames and his wife have been arrested on charges of spying for Moscow since 1985 . Morris is the first American to be declared persona_non_grata since Lt . Col . Daniel Francis Van Gundy III , an assistant military_attache , was accused of espionage on March 15 , 1989 , and given 48 hours to leave the Soviet_Union . The United States retaliated by expelling Sergei Malinin , a Soviet trade representative in New York . In a similar tit_for_tat , Morris will be given seven days to leave the country , the same grace period the Clinton_Administration extended_to Lysenko . Although Lysenko arrived in Washington only last summer , the United States decided to expel him because &quot; he was in a position to be responsible_for the activities associated with the Ames case , &quot; State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Friday . The vague linkage irritated Russian officials , who suggested again that Washington has overreacted to the Ames case . &quot; To expel an officer who was officially recognized and not a covert agent goes beyond the boundaries and really calls_for countermeasures , &quot; Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev said in a television interview Sunday . In a closed briefing for Russian reporters , Yevgeny M . Primakov , head of the Federal Intelligence Service , the agency that conducts foreign espionage , said he is baffled by the fuss Washington has made_over the Ames case . Primakov suggested that the Administration was using the Ames arrest to score domestic political points , to punish Russia for its independent stance on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to provide a convenient excuse for cutting American aid to Russia , according to journalists who attended . The spy chief also reportedly found it peculiar that while Thomas R . Pickering , the U.S. ambassador to Moscow , officially protested the Ames case , Pickering has not inquired about the fate of 10 agents for the CIA who were supposedly exposed by Ames , then arrested and executed . The meetings between Russian intelligence officials and a CIA team sent here to assess the damage done_by Ames were unsatisfactory to both sides , Primakov said . But Primakov and other officials said that the expulsions should not damage U.S.-Russian relations and that he remains willing to cooperate with America to fight terrorism , drug trafficking and other mutual threats . In Washington , McCurry said Monday that the Administration protested the expulsion of the American diplomat , but he said Washington has no plans to kick_out another Russian as a counter-retaliation . In Moscow , Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S . Churkin struck a conciliatory tone , saying that conflict between Russia and the West is inevitable but can be resolved if problems are not overdramatized . But while the Foreign Ministry tried to put the espionage case to rest , rumors swept the intelligence community that Ames was unmasked not by an FBI investigation triggered by the couple ' s lavish spending but by an American mole in the former KGB . These rumors were fueled by President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s dismissal Monday of Nikolai M . Golushko , head of the other KGB successor agency , the Federal Counterintelligence Service , which is charged with rooting_out foreign spies in Russia . Some sources said Golushko was fired after the Kremlin realized Russian intelligence had been compromised by a well-placed turncoat . The official reason for Golushko ' s dismissal was given as &quot; family illness , &quot; as his wife is reported to be seriously ill . But there was no shortage of other theories about Golushko ' s dismissal . The Itar-Tass news_agency suggested that he may have been ousted for perceived disloyalty after allowing Yeltsin ' s political foes to be released from Lefortovo Prison on Saturday . Times staff writer Norman Kempster in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
