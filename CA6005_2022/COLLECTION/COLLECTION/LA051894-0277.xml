   <HEADLINE> STUDY LINKS 3 ALLERGY DRUGS TO CANCER IN MICE ; MEDICINE : CANADIAN TESTS PROMPT USDA PROBE . BUT NO TESTS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON HUMANS AND PATIENTS HAVE NOT BEEN ADVISED TO DISCONTINUE USE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tests by Canadian researchers show that three common allergy drugs promote cancers in laboratory mice , prompting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin its own investigation of the prescription antihistamines . Neither the researchers nor the FDA advised consumers to stop taking the drugs -- which are used by millions to combat symptoms of allergies and hay_fever -- although they cautioned against long-term use . The FDA noted that no clinical studies to determine the effect on humans have been conducted . Moreover , they noted that the mice in the Canadian study did not develop cancer as a result of the drugs . Rather , the animals were injected with tumors beforehand , and the drugs seemed to promote more rapid_growth of those tumors . &quot; The agency does not believe , therefore , that changes in the drugs ' labeling or approval status are warranted , &quot; the FDA said in a statement . But the agency said it is concerned enough about the results to duplicate the Canadian animal work and to consider conducting a statistical analysis of cancer rates among people who take the drugs . The principal Canadian researcher , Dr. Lorne J . Brandes , also said that so far , the benefits of antihistamines appear to outweigh the risks . But he suggested that they should be used &quot; for as short a period as possible and only when really needed. &quot; In the study published today by the Journal of the U.S. National Cancer Institute , Brandes and his research team at the Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology in Winnipeg injected mice with a skin_cancer and a cancer of the connective_tissue , known respectively as melanoma and fibrosarcoma . In three groups of mice , the tumors grew faster and larger after the rodents were injected with one of three antihistamines : loratadine , astemizole and hydroxyzine , all_of which are prescription_drugs . The doses were equivalent_to those commonly prescribed for humans . After 18 to 21 days , the mice were killed and their tumors were removed and measured . The mice that had received the drugs had tumor weights of 150 % to 390 % greater than mice in control groups , the researchers reported . Cancer-ridden mice injected with a placebo showed no evidence of faster or larger tumor growth_rates , the researchers said . Nor were accelerated tumor growth_rates recorded in mice injected with two over-the-counter antihistamines -- doxylamine , used in Unisom and Nyquil -- or another drug , Reactine . The FDA statement pointed_out that there is &quot; no clinical data ( to ) support the findings &quot; and said that &quot; further study is needed to determine whether these kinds of animal data suggest a potential concern for human use of the drugs. &quot; Standard laboratory tests with loratadine and astemizole in mice and rats have not shown them to cause cancer , the FDA added . Astemizole is the primary ingredient in Hismanal , manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceutica of Titusville , N.J. Loratadine is found in Claritin , made by Schering-Plough of Madison , N.J. Hydroxyzine is used in at least seven allergy products , but Brandes specifically linked his study with Atarax , made by the Roerig Division of Pfizer Inc. of New York . Dr. Francis Cuss , vice_president for research at Schering-Plough , maker of Claritin , disputed the significance of the findings , saying there is no proof that chemicals capable of stimulating existing cancers in mice will have the same effect in humans . &quot; These are not accepted as validated studies , &quot; he told the Associated Press . Dr. Douglas L . Weed of the prevention division of the National Cancer Institute said that despite the Canadian conclusion , &quot; we find no cause for alarm. &quot; In an editorial in the same NCI Journal , he recommended no changes in the use of the medication . But this could change in the future if warranted by new research , he added .</TEXT>
