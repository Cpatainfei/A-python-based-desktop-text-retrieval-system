   <TEXT> In the uncertain thaw that has followed the end of the Cold_War , the summit of the Western military alliance that begins here today carries a special meaning for one of its 16 members -- Germany . The collapse of the Soviet_Union , the disappearance of its Communist empire during the last four years and the reunification of Germany have all combined to transform the Old_World ' s political realities . Yet amid this sweeping change , the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization remains the fundamental reference_point for German security policy . The ravings of neo-fascist Russian political figure Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who last week suggested that a nuclear attack was the appropriate response to Germany ' s refusal to issue him a visa , have only underscored the fact that post-Cold War Europe remains anything but safe . Many believed that these tensions , coupled with Bonn ' s role as NATO ' s richest and militarily strongest European member , would quickly elevate a united , fully sovereign Germany to a kind of &quot; first among equals &quot; status along with the United States in the task of shaping the alliance ' s future . It hasn ' t happened . Still struggling to define its role in the world and preoccupied by domestic ills , Germany has failed to fill the leadership vacuum within the alliance that began to develop as a result of the Clinton_Administration ' s initial focus_on Asia and the Middle_East . Indeed , the failure of Germany to become a beacon of vision and change in the new Europe is seen by many as a key reason the alliance finds itself searching so desperately for direction . &quot; NATO was once greater than the sum of its parts , but it ' s fast dissolving into 16 sovereign interests , &quot; said a respected German government_security specialist who requested anonymity . &quot; We ' re drifting on the high seas. &quot; In part , the reason for Germany ' s lack of influence lies_in the disputed interpretation of its post-World War II constitution , which for decades has tightly limited the country ' s military role to actions within the territory of Atlantic Alliance countries . The failure to clarify or reinterpret this provision isolated Germany from other NATO allies during the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War and has left the Federal Constitutional Court , not Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s government , with the power to decide security matters . It was the court that decided whether German military_forces could be deployed to Somalia as part of a U.N. peacekeeping operation and whether German crew_members could stay aboard NATO electronic_surveillance aircraft deployed to enforce the U.N.-imposed &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina . ( Citing political rather than legal grounds , the court ruled_in favor of both deployments. ) And while French and British troops provide the backbone of U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia , both the constitutional question and a bitter history in the region preclude any German military involvement there . As a result , Germany remains a political dwarf on security issues central to its existence . No one country , for example , is more eager to extend NATO ' s membership and its security guarantees eastward than Germany -- the nation on the eastern frontier of the alliance . &quot; The entire political architecture of Europe hangs_on this question , &quot; declared Karl Lamers , a member of the German Parliament and the chief foreign affairs spokesman for Kohl ' s Christian Democrats . &quot; We have to see this open flank and close it. &quot; Despite this perceived urgency , Germany has found itself having to embrace the Clinton_Administration ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; proposal , which goes only so far as_to hold_out the prospect of future membership for former Warsaw Pact nations such_as Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . &quot; We ' re not being taken seriously , &quot; the German government_security specialist said . The hesitation to amend or reinterpret the constitution reflects an allergy among a cross-section of Germans to military_action of any kind -- an aversion developed by hammering post-World War II generations about the horrors of their nation ' s earlier aggressions . Sending the troops off to fight -- even in an honorable cause -- would win few political points today . Yet fearing that continued German reluctance to play an active role in European and global security matters could isolate Bonn further from its main alliance allies , Kohl has consistently pushed for greater involvement . However , faced with an uphill reelection campaign later this year and saddled with a weak Cabinet , Kohl ' s chances of enhancing Germany ' s influence in the short term seem severely limited . While Germany ' s role remains less than full-sized within the alliance , Bonn is expected to play a significant part in helping formulate the West ' s efforts to support reformist forces within Russia and its former European empire . In addition to Germany ' s role as the major donor of Western assistance to Moscow , Kohl has managed to forge strong personal links with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin . He will emphasize those ties and his own position as one of Europe ' s senior leaders to press Germany ' s view of how to support reform in the former Soviet Bloc when he meets with President Clinton in Washington later this month .</TEXT>
