   <HEADLINE> ON VIEW ; MALIBU PLACE ; CBS SERIAL AIMS TO BE A STUDY IN CLASS_STRUCTURE AND AVARICE -- WITH PLENTY OF GORGEOUS SCENERY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In June , we got &quot; Models Inc. &quot; on Fox . Last year , it was &quot; Trade_Winds &quot; on NBC . The year before , &quot; 2000 Malibu Road &quot; on CBS . The latest prime-time serial , &quot; Hotel Malibu , &quot; has the same surface ingredients -- a coastline , beautiful people and sizzling situations -- but this time_out producers say they won ' t feed viewers mind candy . If comparisons are to be made , &quot; Hotel Malibu ' s &quot; creators prefer &quot; Upstairs , Downstairs. &quot; Yes , that highbrow British import that originally aired on public TV in the ' 70s . The inhabitants of &quot; Hotel Malibu &quot; offer a contrast in class also : The wealthy , glamorous resort_hotel owners -- the Mayfield family -- and their minimum-wage employees , always hustling to keep the guests happy . &quot; This is about the status and separation , the ambition and envy and lust , &quot; says Bernard Lechowick , who created the series with his wife , Marie Latham . &quot; You see the distinctions ( between upstairs and downstairs ) , but there tends to be this team effort in front of the guests. &quot; In the opener , Jack Mayfield ( John Dye ) plots a way to shut_down the hotel and gain his inheritance early . His mother , Ellie Mayfield ( Joanna Cassidy ) is oblivious to all_of this , as is his idealistic sister , Stevie ( Cheryl Pollak ) . Downstairs , meanwhile , a maid beds a guest . The backdrop to all_of this above- and below-board activity is a hotel with a sweeping ocean view , tall palms , tennis_courts and pools . ( Redondo Beach ' s Portofino Inn serves as the Malibu location. ) And then there are the beautiful physiques : Men with washboard abs , women with long legs and not a trace of cellulite . Still sound like a soap ? It might , but cast members say the show ' s dialogue is literate , witty and crisp . For example , Jack Mayfield shoots back at his sister when she appears to have designs on the hotel bartender : &quot; You can romanticize the working class , but you don ' t want to have dinner with the waiter. &quot; &quot; There ' s a snappy repartee , &quot; Cassidy says . &quot; They write it in very lyrical ways . It ' s almost difficult to remember the lines . It ' s not melodramatic. &quot; Even more , Lechowick and Latham -- who were responsible_for &quot; Homefront &quot; and &quot; Second Chances &quot; -- got many of their ideas for the show from rank-and-file , real-life hotel workers , not people from the posh worlds of the Hiltons or the Trumps . For years , the couple when the couple went_on vacation they interviewed bellhops and doormen , bartenders and maids . &quot; The most astonishing thing about it was everyone in the hotel business liked their line_of_work , &quot; says Lechowick , who also is the show ' s executive producer with Latham . &quot; The salaries are not very high , but the people are happy . They are happy for the variety of life , the variety of incident , the people they come_in contact with. &quot; The couple also found that workers put_on two faces : very cordial in front of guests and managers ; another , more bawdy , when they were in their personal space . Just take it from Harry O ' Reilly , who plays head bartender Harry Radzimski . &quot; I once worked_at a reception hall in Brooklyn , and the downstairs really resented the upstairs , &quot; says O ' Reilly , a regular on &quot; Homefront. &quot; &quot; We ' d go_back and bad-mouth everyone in the room . We would be back eating all_the food. &quot; Behind his back , Radzimski calls boss Jack Mayfield &quot; Lord of the Manor , &quot; and yearns to punch him out . But in his presence , it ' s , &quot; Yes , sir. &quot; Not that the show will dwell_on backroom chatter . The characters have weighty problems . Harry ' s assistant , Melinda Lopez ( Jennifer Lopez ) , was hired for her looks , and has never mixed a drink . But her character ' s got a dilemma : She ' s a virgin . &quot; It ' s not an unusual thing to Latino culture , but it will be an unusual thing to a lot of people out there , &quot; Lopez says . &quot; At this point in her life , she ' s a little uncomfortable because she knows that everyone around her has done it. &quot; Lopez and Pepe Serna , who plays her overbearing father in the show , re-create their roles from &quot; Second Chances , &quot; the CBS drama that was pulled from the schedule because its sets were extensively damaged in the January earthquake . Producers wanted to keep the Lopezes , one of television ' s few middle-class , Mexican-American families . &quot; The Latinos loved my character because he is a strict disciplinarian and he shows the Old_World values that some 90-odd percent of the Latinos have in the United States , &quot; Serna says . &quot; He just doesn ' t believe that this is a place where a young_woman should be working . But she wants to spread her wings without me being over her shoulder all_of the time. &quot; To be sure , there is room for the blonde , and she causes her share of trouble . Harry ' s conniving sister Nancy ( Romy Walthall ) gets a job at the hotel as a maid , but she thinks she should own the place . She ' s on the prowl for a powerful man . ( &quot; No married_men , definitely , no smokers , no minimum-wage types , no more musicians , &quot; Nancy proclaims in the show. ) &quot; She ' s completely streetwise , &quot; says Walthall , dressed in her maid ' s uniform . &quot; She wants a lot . But her means of getting_it are different that most people ' s. &quot; If all_of this still sounds like summer fluff , there ' s one final way to separate this from the &quot; Dynasties &quot; of TV . &quot; We don ' t have a lot of shoulder_pads , &quot; Dye says wryly . &quot; that ' s the difference . We go easy on the shoulder pads. &quot; &quot; Hotel Malibu &quot; premieres Thursday at 10 p.m. on CBS .</TEXT>
