   <HEADLINE> BLOODIED CROWBAR DISCOVERED IN HOME OF MURDER_SUSPECT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A search of the home of John Joseph Famalaro , who has been charged with the murder of Denise Huber of Newport Beach , turned_up a bloodied crowbar and a list of about 10 names , nine of them women , authorities revealed Tuesday . Authorities located at least five of the women in Southern California and Phoenix . They planned to appeal for the public ' s help today in identifying the remainder . Law_enforcement authorities also began searching sites in Orange County for evidence . Court documents filed Tuesday in Mayer , a town near Prescott in central Arizona , indicate that police have seized numerous suspicious items from Famalaro ' s home , including articles of women ' s clothing , some of which appear to be stained with blood , a blood-tainted tarp and the crowbar that police suspect may be the murder weapon . The revelations came_after the body of Huber , 23 at the time of her disappearance , was found last week in a freezer in the back of a stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro ' s driveway . Huber vanished three years ago after she became stranded on the Corona del Mar Freeway with a flat_tire . Famalaro , 37 , is being held_in lieu of $ 250 # 000 bail . Robert Shoults , whose wife , Gloria , was_on the list of names , expressed surprise because their only connection with Famalaro was that they had sold him a van two years ago . Police , who called to check on Gloria Shoults ' well-being , &quot; said that her name had turned_up on some papers they had found , &quot; said Shoults , of Dewey , Ariz . &quot; Having somebody like that in your neighborhood . . . does make your hair stand_up a little bit , because this is generally a quiet area. &quot; Huber was believed to have been bludgeoned to death , and a crowbar could have been the type of weapon used , authorities said . In other developments Tuesday : * Authorities , who have not ruled_out additional suspects , said they want to question two men who are related to Famalaro in connection with the case . * Police completed a comprehensive search of Famalaro ' s home , and expanded their search in Orange County , where Famalaro had rented several storage_lockers and where he kept the freezer before moving to Arizona . Using axes , rakes and shovels , authorities Tuesday dug as deep as 10 feet below the surface in three areas of Famalaro ' s home where cadaver-sniffing dogs had &quot; alerted , &quot; but no other bodies were discovered . Police went_to at least three storage facilities in Orange County on Tuesday , including Trabuco Self Storage and Lake Forest Storage . Costa Mesa Detective Sgt . Jerry Holloway said investigators &quot; are finding some items of evidence that we can use , &quot; but he declined to elaborate . Investigators are focusing_on reconstructing how Famalaro and Huber may have come_into contact June 3 , 1991 , the night of her disappearance , and his movements since . Police said Tuesday that they believe Huber was killed in Orange County shortly after her abduction and that her body was transported in the freezer , but it may be difficult to fix a time and place of death because of the condition of the body . Law_enforcement sources alternately discounted and were intrigued by the theory that Famalaro may have lured Huber to her death by posing as a law_enforcement officer . Two phony Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department shirts were among the numerous items seized from his home . Both shirts had handmade replicas of the Los Angeles County sheriff ' s official patches sewn on them . Famalaro ' s attorney , Lawrence William Katz , disputed the strength of the case against his client and attacked news media coverage . Katz said he expects a grand_jury to indict Famalaro this week . He said he would immediately seek to overturn the indictment on the ground that excessive publicity has compromised the grand_jury . Search_warrant papers filed_in Arizona on Tuesday revealed that police confiscated an extensive array of potentially incriminating items from Famalaro ' s home during an exhaustive search last week . Besides the bloody crowbar , a number of seized items had crimson stains , including strips of white cloth , a tarp , tissue , a &quot; yellow paper bodysuit , &quot; a sweat shirt and articles of women ' s clothing . Authorities are awaiting the results of blood and fingerprint tests . Times staff writer Jeff Brazil contributed to this story .</TEXT>
