   <HEADLINE> GARDENING Q &amp; A : DETAILS ON COMPOSTING , EARTHWORMS SOUGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : We want more information on composting and earthworms : What about using fireplace ashes , dog and cat feces , oleander leaves , etc. ? ANSWER : I ' ve had numerous inquiries on these subjects , and have decided to center my response around a good recommendation from Bill McBride of Whittier . Bill keeps plastic containers under his kitchen_sink , and the McBrides place all their unusable produce scraps ( spoiled fruit , fruit peelings , potato_peelings , waste from lettuce and cabbage , etc. ) into these containers . Then every day he carries the container ( s ) out_to his garden and digs a small hole six to eight inches deep , dropping_in the scraps and chopping them with his shovel as he adds back some soil . Finally he covers it all up with the remaining soil . Depending_on the time_of_year and the temperature , the scraps are usually composted within a week . He digs a new hole each day . The marvel to him is that without any other effort his garden soil is now full of earthworms . Lots of organic matter in the soil is the key to building_up earthworm populations . Bill ' s procedure is a good one , because it ' s easy and effective . Fireplace ashes may also be successfully used in the compost pile or buried in the garden . However , dog and cat feces , as a rule , are not considered appropriate for use in compost because of possible contamination with disease-causing organisms , but they may be buried under shrubbery and trees . Manures from vegetarian critters such_as rabbits and horses , etc. , work fine in compost . I cannot find any reference_to the safety of using oleander debris in compost for vegetable_gardens , but I would not take_a_chance if I were you . Oleander sap contains two extremely toxic glycosides ( nerioside and oleandroside ) . According to several authorities , eating any part of an oleander plant , even a single leaf -- or breathing the fumes from burning oleander leaves or stems -- can be fatal . Fortunately , most people seem to know about this plant , because there are very few known poisoning from oleanders even though these plants are grown almost everywhere in the Southland . So , why take_a_chance , especially if you plan to use your compost around edible crops in the vegetable_garden ? Growing Apricots When Space Is Limited Q : I would like to grow apricots in my yard but don ' t have space for a full-size tree . Any suggestions ? A : Apricot_trees on dwarfing rootstocks do_well in our area , reaching a mature height of about 10 feet with proper pruning . ( Apricots tend to form long , relatively straight stems . The trick is to cut_back these long stems as they form in the summertime , so they will branch_out into shorter , spur-like stems on a main framework. ) Choose Dwarf Royal or Dwarf Nugget inland and Dwarf Blenheim or Dwarf Royal near the coast .</TEXT>
