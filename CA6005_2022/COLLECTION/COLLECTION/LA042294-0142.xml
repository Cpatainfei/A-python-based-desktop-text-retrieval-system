   <HEADLINE> FIRST PLANETS FOUND OUTSIDE SOLAR SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An astronomer has found &quot; irrefutable evidence &quot; of at least two planets orbiting a nearby star -- the first confirmed observation of planets outside the solar_system humanity calls home . What has scientists most excited , however , is that the finding suggests that planets can form around almost any star and that the galaxy may well be crowded with planets . Astronomer Alexander Wolszczan at Pennsylvania State University confirmed the existence of the planets in orbit around an unusual neutron_star located 1 # 200 light-years away in the constellation Virgo . The star is one of just 21 known stellar objects , called millisecond pulsars , that spin thousands of times faster than typical stars , broadcasting powerful radio pulses as they revolve . The star , known as PSR B1257 + 12 , is an extremely small , very dense body barely the size of Los Angeles , that weighs as much as the sun and spins faster than a kitchen blender . It is the cinder from an ancient supernova that once burned more brightly than any other object in the sky . &quot; The proof that objects of planetary size do exist outside the solar_system indicates that our planets are not unique and uncommon anymore , &quot; Wolszczan said . &quot; The evidence is such_that there is no need to question the reality of this. &quot; Wolszczan and his colleagues determined that one planet is about 3.4 times the size of Earth and is orbiting the star every 66.6 days ; the second planet-sized object appears to be about 2.8 times the size of Earth and is orbiting the pulsar every 98.2 days . Scientists Thursday said it was extremely unlikely that either planet could support life . Wolszczan also reported the possibility that a smaller , moon-sized object is orbiting closer to the star , but cautioned that those observations were not yet confirmed . That object appears to circle the pulsar every 25 days . More_than one scientific reputation has foundered on such announcements of new planetary systems . At least five times in the past 30 years , news of planet discoveries has been followed quickly by retractions when errors in the data were discovered or when others could not confirm the initial sighting . In 1992 , for example , a respected British astronomer had to tell his colleagues that the planet he thought he had discovered the year before &quot; just evaporated. &quot; But Wolszczan ' s findings , which are being published today in the journal Science , appear to convince many skeptical astronomers . He spent three years confirming the existence of the planets , which he detected in the fall of 1991 with the help of Dale Frail of the National Radio_Astronomy Observatory after 16 months of monitoring the unusual star . Shrinivas Kulkarni , the Caltech astronomer who discovered millisecond pulsars in 1982 , said Thursday that he found the evidence very persuasive , calling it &quot; a wonderful thing . &quot; There were some healthy doubts that maybe the pulsar was doing some bizarre stuff that we were incorrectly interpreting as planets , &quot; he said . &quot; But we can all be sure now that we are ( detecting ) planets. &quot; The star would be considered remarkable under any circumstances , astronomers said , but it is an especially unlikely place for planets to form because it is the collapsed remnant of a supernova explosion that should have destroyed any existing orbiting bodies . For that reason , the discovery suggests that planets may be far more common in the universe than any astronomer had ever dared hope , authorities said . &quot; The fact that planets have been found orbiting a neutron_star is a strong piece of evidence that planets are easy to form , &quot; Caltech astronomer Stephen Thorsett said . &quot; This is certainly the best case I ' ve seen and I am personally confident things have been done right and this is correct. &quot; The discovery apparently culminates a search that began with the invention of the first telescope centuries ago . But no one has laid eyes on the two planets with any optical_instrument . Instead , to find the planets , researchers used statistical analyses and detailed observations of the regular radio_signals the pulsar emits . Wolszczan was able to detect the infinitesimal wobble caused by the gravitational pull of the planets whirling_around the central star . The star sends_out a radio_signal 160 times a second with a precision greater than the most accurate atomic_clock on Earth . Wolszczan used the 305-meter-diameter radio_telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico to measure the arrival_times of the pulsar ' s energy pulses . Unlike many of the other 550 known pulsars in the universe , these signals contained a subtle , periodic hesitation that strongly suggested that the position of the star was changing in response to one or more large objects in orbit around it . Further meticulous analysis revealed the effect of the planets ' changing orbits as they passed each other in their journeys around the strange sun , bearing out theoretical predictions . That was the test that other astronomers found most convincing . There are two theories on how the planets may have formed . Any planets already around that star should have been destroyed in the supernova blast . &quot; It is the last place you ' d look_for planets , &quot; Kulkarni said . But Thorsett at Caltech and Rachel Dewey at the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena last year calculated that planets could survive a cataclysmic stellar explosion , depending_on where they were in their orbits when the supernova was triggered . But the supernova happened so_long ago that planets could have formed since then . Scientists believe that in that scenario , the neutron_star was orbited by a companion star , which eventually swelled into a red giant , a cool star typically 100 times larger than our sun . As it did so , it dumped matter into the neutron_star , causing it to spin rapidly . The red giant somehow came_apart , and from its ruins the seeds of the newly discovered planets formed , astronomers theorize . &quot; We have to take news of the first two planets very seriously , &quot; said Stephen P . Maran , a senior scientist at NASA ' s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md . and spokesman for the American Astronomical Society . &quot; I think we now have much greater confidence that there really are planets of other stars . &quot; But the confirmation comes from the person who made the initial discovery , &quot; he cautioned . &quot; Everything I have heard indicates this is good work , but . . . he already knew what he wanted to find. &quot;</TEXT>
