   <HEADLINE> NEW DAY TO RING AFTER REPAIR AS MISSION BELL_TOWER BEGINS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The old San Gabriel Mission ' s bell_tower and museum were already scheduled for restoration when the Jan . 17 Northridge quake hit . The quake caused corner walls_in the museum to separate and shifted the museum and bell_tower 2 to 6 inches in some places , according to restoration director Helen Nelson . It added a new sense of urgency -- as well as $ 100 # 000 in repair costs -- to the project as bracing hastily went_up to prevent aftershocks from causing further damage . &quot; It ' s a historical landmark , &quot; Nelson said . &quot; We have to save it. &quot; Mission church parishioners agreed , pledging $ 1.2 million for restoration . Nelson said the work_on the bell_tower and museum should be completed by the end of the year . &quot; Our parishioners are great , &quot; she said . &quot; Their generosity has been overwhelming. &quot; The church , which was badly damaged by the 1987 Whittier earthquake , reopened in September after extensive repairs and seismic strengthening and was undamaged in the January earthquake . The San Gabriel Mission was founded in 1771 by Franciscan Padre Junipero Serra . It was the fourth of the 21 missions founded by Serra , who was beatified by the Catholic_Church in 1988 . The museum and bell_tower , more_than 200 years old , attract thousands of tourists and students every year . But Nelson said many of the museum ' s treasures -- including Native_American paintings , artifacts and vestments worn by the original padres -- have been inaccessible since the earthquake .</TEXT>
