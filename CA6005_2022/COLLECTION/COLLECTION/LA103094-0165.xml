   <HEADLINE> GRACE AND FEAR MARK AIDS EPIDEMIC IN SAN FRANCISCO ; HEALTH : DISEASE IS NOW THE CITY ' S TOP KILLER OF MEN . THERE ARE AS MANY POIGNANT STORIES AS THERE ARE VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard has seen it countless times -- the anger , the sorrow , the bravery of critically ill AIDS patients . Soon , he says , he ' ll know exactly how they feel . &quot; Not everybody is courageous in the face of AIDS . Some go kicking and screaming and are horrible to everyone around them , &quot; said the former heroin addict-turned AIDS counselor . &quot; I ' m not sure how I ' m going_to act. &quot; Richard , who declined to use his last_name , was diagnosed HIV positive in 1985 . &quot; So I ' m panicking. &quot; He isn ' t the only one . The San Francisco health department recently announced that for the first time in any U.S. city , AIDS was the leading cause of death among men in 1992 -- the first time any illness passed heart_disease as the No . 1 killer . In a tragic coincidence , 1992 was the same year health officials celebrated hitting a plateau in the number of new cases . What ' s even more unfortunate is that many here weren ' t surprised by the numbers . &quot; We ' ve lost so many friends , &quot; said Richard Chavez , former program coordinator for activities at the Shanti Project . &quot; It ' s frightening to think that nobody is surprised by it , &quot; said Chavez , who is also HIV-positive . &quot; Maybe some people who have been hiding in the sand might say , ' Oh , my gosh. ' &quot; Over the last few years , AIDS has been the leading cause of death among men age 25-44 , but 1992 was the first time it crossed all age lines . The largest increase in deaths came_in men age 35-44 . In 1992 , the latest year data is available , of the 8 # 143 total deaths in San Francisco , 1 # 195 men died of AIDS , while 1 # 094 men died of heart-related disease . In 1991 , of the total 8 # 345 deaths , heart-related disease killed 1 # 189 men and AIDS killed 1 # 152 men . &quot; In traditional medicine , you go_to the doctor and get better . In AIDS , you go_to the doctor , you go_to the doctor , you go_to the doctor , you go_to the doctor , you go_to the doctor , you go_to the doctor -- and die , &quot; said Richard , the AIDS counselor . Among all San Francisco residents , AIDS accounted_for 15 % of the deaths in 1992 and 14 % in 1991 . The number of new AIDS cases reported in 1992 was 3 # 028 , but that dropped 25 % to 2 # 264 in 1993 . The health department estimated that new cases would drop to 1 # 204 in 1997 . &quot; AIDS had been inching up as the leading cause of death . . . . It didn ' t go from being No . 12 to 1 overnight , &quot; said Mitch Katz , director of the city ' s AIDS office . &quot; Between 1981 and 1984 , there were 8 # 000 new infections each year . Those were entirely among gay_men . And now we ' re seeing , 10 to 12 years later , the consequences -- the high rate of death , &quot; Katz said . * Although the numbers for 1993 are still being compiled , AIDS is expected to remain the leading cause of death . The death rate isn ' t likely to decrease until the late 1990s , Katz said . The health department warned that although the number of AIDS cases among gay_men has decreased , the numbers of youths and intravenous drug_users afflicted is increasing . Richard , the AIDS counselor , doesn ' t doubt that AIDS will increase among IV drug_users . The &quot; shooting galleries , &quot; or drug homes , where he used to hang_out had three hypodermic_needles on the table for about eight people . Some had been used so many times the tips were rounded . &quot; Some days , I never saw a person above the forearm , &quot; he said . He was sober on and off and went_through some years of shooting_up a_few times a year , compared with 10 to 15 times a day . At one point , his girlfriend threatened to dump him if he got stoned . When he did_it anyway , he lied to her , saying his friend had just died of AIDS and he couldn ' t handle the emotional strain . The woman then suggested they get tested . In 1985 , he got a phone_call from a clinic doctor who said she tested negative . His test was positive . AIDS is &quot; part of what put me in touch . . . made me part of the human_race again , &quot; Richard said . &quot; I ' ve spent so_much of my life numb and unfeeling . To be feeling is a miracle. &quot; Richard has been clean for the last four years . &quot; This is the most productive time in my life , from the standpoint of being a part of rather than apart from , &quot; he said , though he wishes his wake-up call had been something other_than AIDS . &quot; I know I get incredibly teary sometimes when I think_about what it would be like . I don ' t want to wear a diaper because I ' m incontinent when I ' m 41 . that ' s the stuff that ' s supposed to happen to you when you ' re 85 or 90 , &quot; Richard said . But his spirits rise when he thinks_of his work as a counselor , his girlfriend and starting graduate_school in the fall . &quot; If I didn ' t get HIV , if I didn ' t get tested , I would n ' t be here today . And I ' m supposed to be here and putting one foot in front of the other. &quot; * Fritz Desir doesn ' t know how he got AIDS . What he does know is that he can no longer play soccer . He worries about how he ' s going_to pay rent and buy_food . Desir , 31 , escaped_from Haiti in 1980 and spent three months drifting at_sea with 30 others before being picked_up by the U.S. Coast Guard . He eventually received political asylum and was sent to San Francisco . In 1992 , after suffering a bout with tuberculosis , he found_out he was HIV positive . These days , his energy level -- and his spirits -- are low . &quot; I can ' t pay my rent . I can ' t go_out and have a good time , &quot; Desir said , sitting in his cramped San Francisco studio . &quot; She helps me , &quot; he said , meaning his girlfriend , Catherine Crawford . &quot; But I can ' t help her like I used to. &quot; The two share the studio . But both are unemployed ; after paying rent , they have $ 100 left . Recently , a friend staying with them promised to help pay the rent . The friend skipped_town . &quot; We just take every battle as it comes , &quot; Desir said . &quot; My life is in God ' s hands. &quot; * Robert Sterman and Glenn Nelson met via a computer bulletin_board . Both knew the other was HIV positive , but that didn ' t matter . Their only fear was that they would get sick at_the_same_time . Nelson ' s health started deteriorating first , about a year ago . So they decided to get_married . Though California doesn ' t recognize same-sex marriages , the pair exchanged vows at a ceremony before a small gathering of friends and family . &quot; We both said , when we said our vows , ' till death do us part. ' And that ' s exactly what we meant , &quot; Sterman said . Nelson died earlier this year . He was 28 . &quot; One of my concerns is people seeing the story and saying , ' Oh , there ' s another gay that died. ' He was a person , &quot; Sterman said . Sterman recently began feeling the effects of AIDS . He stays_at home more now , because he ' s afraid he won ' t have the energy to climb the flight of stairs to his apartment . &quot; The whole world seems to be moving at a much , much faster pace than me . That gets_to be frustrating when you know you used to be at that faster pace. &quot; Meanwhile , he plans life by the week . And he clings_to a little ray of hope . &quot; There ' s hope that they will be able to find a way to control the disease , &quot; he said . &quot; And the hope that at least your journey into whatever the next life is , is as easy as it can be. &quot;</TEXT>
