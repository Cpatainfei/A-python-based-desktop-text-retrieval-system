   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION ; FUNDING SERVICES IS A 2-WAY STREET ; THE PRESIDENT IS ASKING CONGRESS FOR A 30 % BOOST IN ASSISTANCE FOR HARD-HIT STATES , WHICH STILL HAVE TO SHOULDER THEIR FAIR SHARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Through much of our history , immigration has been among this country ' s most emotional political issues . We are a nation of immigrants . Yet too often we have forgotten our heritage and used immigrants as scapegoats for our problems . Once again , in a period of tight budget constraints , immigrants are in the political cross_hairs . There is a genuine need to curb illegal immigration and to assist states with costs related to illegal immigration . However , in the rush of political rhetoric , the public needs to distinguish between the exploitation of these issues and responsible efforts to address them . All agree on the need to combat illegal immigration . That is a central federal responsibility , and this Adminstration is overcoming years of inertia at the federal level to strengthen border enforcement . As to fiscal relief , however , we are hearing some very easy answers to very complicated problems . They range from assertions that Washington should write a blank_check to cover traditional state and local services to all immigrants to proposals that all benefits be cut_off for legal and illegal immigrants alike . The answer lies at neither extreme but in a strong partnership between the federal and state_governments . Enforcement . President Clinton has directed the Immigration and Nationalization Service to make a comprehensive effort to secure our borders and deter illegal immigration . His budget , now before Congress , would add more_than 1 # 000 agents at the border and 200 inspectors at land ports_of_entry , provide agents with better equipment , fund deportation of aliens who commit serious crimes after they complete their sentences , increase enforcement of sanctions against those who hire undocumented aliens and improve the asylum and naturalization processes . Assistance . Regardless of these efforts , millions of undocumented aliens are here already . Previous administrations looked the other way when it came_to the states ' costs of providing services to them , but the President believes that these costs are a shared responsibility . His budget contains billions for states relating to immigrants , around 30 % more_than in previous Administrations ; included is $ 350 million to assist states for the first time ever with the costs of imprisoning illegal immigrants who are convicted felons . But the states cannot send the entire bill for health , prison and other costs to Washington . These are , after all , not just federal responsibilities . Before Congress will approve additional funds , it must have the facts , and states have provided widely varying estimates of their costs . For example , the governor of Texas estimates that undocumented immigrants cost her state $ 166 million annually , or an average of about $ 300 per immigrant . The governor of California is asking_for $ 2.3 billion . His estimate of undocumented immigrants is 2.1 million , one-third greater than the INS estimate of 1.6 million . And because he does not count taxes , lottery receipts and other revenues that the state collects from undocumented immigrants , he wants $ 1 # 000 for each one , more_than three times what Texas is asking . To separate facts from rhetoric , a working group of affected states and the federal_government has asked the respected , nonpartisan Urban Institute to provide an objective estimate of the costs and revenues associated with illegal immigration . This will help determine what additional assistance might be appropriate . In addition , the Administration is committed to working with the governors of the states with the largest_numbers of illegal immigrants to obtain support from Congress . In a tight federal budget , a powerful case must be made that a relatively few states are entitled to special help . Nevertheless , some elected officials seem more interested in scoring political points on this issue than in solving the problem . Lawsuits have been filed that legal_experts give virtually no chance of success , resulting in wasted legal costs that the states can ill afford . Clearly , some politicians are laying the groundwork for blaming Washington when the inevitable tough state budget choices are made . For example , California has built its budget around a so-called $ 3-billion immigration gap that is somehow , mysteriously , to be filled by federal funds that simply do not exist . Nobody should be under any illusions . In the zero-sum budget game , every dollar spent on this problem must be taken from somewhere else . Therefore , we had better work together instead of pointing fingers . As our nation decides on a policy path , we should remember our immigrant heritage . My parents came_to this country looking_for the opportunity to work for a better life for themselves and their children . Most immigrants still come_to this country for the same reason . No , we should not tolerate people immigrating illegally . But we need to treat this issue honestly and fairly . If public officials at all levels can do that , this problem can be solved in keeping with the great spirit and heritage of this nation .</TEXT>
