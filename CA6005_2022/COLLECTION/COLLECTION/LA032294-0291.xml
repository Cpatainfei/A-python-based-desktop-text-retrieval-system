   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; PANAMA REPRISE ? ; MANUEL NORIEGA ' S OLD PARTY SEEMS POISED FOR VICTORY IN UPCOMING ELECTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four years and three months after U.S. troops invaded Panama and captured Gen . Manuel Antonio Noriega , the country appears poised to restore Noriega ' s old political_party to power in the first free elections in decades . The startling turn of events reflects general disenchantment with the U.S.-backed government of President Guillermo Endara , whose administration has been racked with corruption scandals and anger over economic_policies that have deepened poverty and unemployment for many Panamanians . Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party , or PRD , Noriega ' s onetime political arm , leads most polls by a wide margin . He is followed by the government ' s former comptroller , 73-year-old Ruben Dario Carles . The wild card in the elections , which are scheduled for May 8 , is actor and salsa star Ruben Blades . The singer returned to Panama last year from his home_in Santa Monica and founded a party called Papa Egoro , or Mother Earth in the indigenous Embera language . Blades , 45 , prides himself on an unorthodox presidential campaign that represents a clean break from Panama ' s shaky past of rule by military dictators or pro-U.S. oligarchs . &quot; Ours is an anti-party , &quot; he said in an interview at his apartment overlooking the Panama Bay . &quot; More_than a simple change of parties , we are trying to present a change of attitude . . . a change in political behavior. &quot; * After a promising start , however , Blades ' candidacy has been hurt by desertions from the party and his own failure to campaign effectively . He had fallen to third place in a poll released early this month . The elections will be Panama ' s first conducted without military_controls in more_than 25 years and are expected to be the cleanest in its history . A large_number of international observers will monitor the voting . Panama has long been a focus of strategic importance to the United States because of the U.S.-built Panama_Canal , which connects the Atlantic and Pacific_oceans , and as the headquarters site of the U.S. Army Southern Command , which oversees U.S. military operations south of the Rio Grande . Noriega was the de_facto ruler of Panama through most of the 1980s , despite the presence of a series of civilian figurehead presidents from the PRD . After years on the CIA payroll , the Panamanian strongman fell_out of favor with Washington in 1987 . As anti-Noriega demonstrations led by business_leaders and others began to spread in Panama_City , the U.S._government indicted Noriega on drug charges and slapped stringent economic sanctions on the isthmus nation . Finally , with Noriega refusing to step aside , then-President George_Bush ordered the Dec . 19 , 1989 , invasion of Panama . Hundreds of Panamanians and about two_dozen U.S. troops were killed , and Noriega was eventually captured , transported to the United States and tried and convicted for drug crimes . He is serving a 40-year prison_term in Florida . In a ceremony at a U.S. military base , the Americans installed Endara , who had won the 1989 presidential elections , which were promptly annulled by Noriega . Endara and his coalition of three conservative_parties , however , soon proved to be a disappointment to many Panamanians who had high hopes of better lives under a well-run , truly democratic government . Endara ' s administration has been caught_up in one scandal after another , while money-laundering and drug running -- the ills once blamed on Noriega -- continue to flourish . The government ' s free-market policies have triggered impressive economic_growth , but unemployment and crime soar while wages languish . * Perez Balladares and the PRD have been effective at capitalizing on the public discontent , analysts say . Universally known by his nickname , the Bull , because of his hulking build , Perez Balladares is careful to distance himself from Noriega and to pledge that the military domination of the past will not return . Instead , he and the party are reviving their traditional ties to the policies and rhetoric of Gen . Omar Torrijos , the military strongman who preceded Noriega and who was admired by many Panamanians for his attention to the poor and lower classes . Torrijos , who died in a still-mysterious plane crash in 1981 , exploited class differences to retain the support of Panama ' s largely dark-skinned masses , who resent a white elite that ruled_in the 1950s and ' 60s . Some Panamanians see the current Endara government as representative of that elite . Despite the fact that he is a multimillionaire businessman , Perez Balladares invokes themes of social equality in stump_speeches and campaign appearances . &quot; We are committed to democracy , to real democracy , where not just one social_class benefits , &quot; he told workers gathered_in a sweltering grocery warehouse earlier this month . &quot; An elitist democracy , one that only responds to the privileged social_class , is by definition a lack of democracy , and one that contains the seed of its own destruction. &quot; Yet here at this warehouse , as in many of his appearances , Perez Balladares was questioned about members of the party who represent throwbacks to the most repressive elements of the Noriega regime . He told the crowd that the PRD has been purged and made more democratic . It is this kind of doubt that dogs Perez Balladares and the PRD , and is handily exploited by their opponents . Newspapers controlled by anti-PRD forces routinely publish photographs of Perez Balladares with Noriega and run cartoons that suggest he will govern with an iron fist . Perhaps to combat those ghosts , Perez Balladares has become a tireless campaigner who easily might handle a dozen appointments one day , fly off in his private jet to meet Mexico ' s presidential candidate the next day , and return to Panama in time for a six-city car tour of the countryside . The polls show his strategy is working . In the last eight months , he has climbed steadily from single-digit support to hold a nearly 2-1 lead over his closest opponent . * Last year , many observers in Panama believed that it would be the salsero Blades -- not Perez Balladares -- who would capture the wave of discontent . But Blades ' failure to make many public appearances , while the other candidates launched expensive , highly publicized campaigns , has eroded early support . Blades has also been largely ignored or attacked by a Panamanian press controlled by the traditional political_parties and their allies . &quot; People know Ruben Blades is against the government , but they don ' t know how or why , &quot; political analyst Marco Gandasegui said . &quot; Papa Egoro has not gotten its message across . . . . The figure of Ruben Blades commands a great_deal of affection , but there is no ( party ) organization that can channel that affection in a concrete , effective way. &quot; Blades has promised to intensify his campaign , blaming inexperience and a lack of money for many of his problems . &quot; What we are trying to do is not easy , &quot; Blades said . &quot; We have the huge problem of not only confronting the Panamanian public ' s disappointment ( with its political_leaders ) but also of trying to work outside the traditional political apparatus. &quot; A number of disillusioned party members have deserted , accusing Blades of remaining inaccessible while surrounding himself with a small group of intellectuals . Blades chalked the desertions up_to the party ' s growing pains .</TEXT>
