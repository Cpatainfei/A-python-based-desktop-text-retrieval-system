   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : COPING WITH HIGHER PRICES OF FREQUENT FLIER PROGRAMS ; AIRLINES : LESS-GENEROUS MILEAGE AWARDS TAKE_EFFECT JAN . 1 . THE REMAINING BARGAINS WILL DEMAND SMARTER PLANNING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the coming of the new year , travelers who are members of frequent-flier programs confront significant changes -- some immediate -- in their mileage accounts . First , billions of miles will expire from members ' accounts at several airlines ' frequent flier programs on Dec . 31 . Several years ago , a number of carriers ( including Alaska , American and United ) instituted three-year time_limits on accrued mileage . Therefore , miles earned on these programs in 1991 will expire at the end of 1994 . Second , in early 1995 most airlines ( including American , Continental , United and USAir ) are raising the &quot; price &quot; of a free coach ticket within the continental United States and Canada , from 20 # 000 to 25 # 000 miles ( an estimated 90 % of all awards redeemed are for these types of tickets ) . USAir makes the change after midnight on Jan . 1 . American , Continental and United follow on Feb . 1 . On the plus side , Delta is decreasing miles needed for a free coach ticket , from 30 # 000 miles to 25 # 000 starting May 1 , 1995 . that ' s great for Delta fliers who have already accumulated mega-miles . But the carrier is also making_it harder for members to earn miles on short flights . On May 1 , Delta will lower minimum miles awarded on short hops , from 1 # 000 to 500 miles . For example , the 337-mile flight from LAX to San Francisco will earn 500 miles , not 1 # 000 , as it used to . At most carriers , the number of miles required for other awards will also change next year . Some awards , such_as a free coach ticket to Hawaii , are going_up on several airlines ( on United , for example , mileage needed rises from 30 # 000 to 35 # 000 ) . Others , such_as two first-class tickets to Europe or Asia , will actually go_down_on some airlines later in 1995 ( at American and United , the mileage cost drops from 200 # 000 to 160 # 000 miles for two tickets ) . What should you do about expiring miles and redemption increases ? &quot; Don ' t overreact to the changes , &quot; says Randy Petersen , editor and publisher of &quot; InsideFlyer , &quot; a monthly consumer magazine for members of frequent flier programs . &quot; Yes , ( airlines ) are boosting award redemption levels . . . but those deadlines don ' t mean you must fly before those dates to use the old redemption levels , &quot; he says . &quot; For example , if you want to get a ticket on United for 20 # 000 miles ( or four 5 # 000 Mileage Plus award checks ) , make your travel_plans and exchange your award checks for your ticket before Feb . 1 , &quot; he advises . &quot; Your ticket will be valid for one year . You can change your travel date on that itinerary for no fee ( providing award seating is available ) . You can change your itinerary , within the award ' s same geographic restrictions , for a $ 35 fee . &quot; You can follow a similar strategy to avoid American AAdvantage ' s increase by receiving a certificate from their frequent flier department before the Feb . 1 deadline . The award will be good for one year , giving you plenty of time to book your free flight in 1995 . If you still need more time , you can book a flight in late 1995 for up_to 320 days in_advance . In other words , an American 20 # 000-mile award that would have gone_up to 25 # 000 miles on Feb . 1 , 1995 , can be flown late into 1996. &quot; The same basic strategy applies toward minimizing the impact of expiring miles . At American , for example , order your 20 # 000-mile award certificate before those miles expire on Dec . 31 . With that certificate , you have a year to make reservations for your free flight . What if you are just short of the magic mile level for a domestic coach ticket ? &quot; First , find_out if your frequent flier program will let you go_into negative flow , &quot; advises Petersen . &quot; Although they don ' t publicize this policy , American , Delta and United will sometimes allow you to go_into negative mileage in_order to claim an award , particularly if you are a good customer . Continental even allows you to purchase miles to reach a prize level . There are other ways to boost your mileage total . &quot; You could rent a car for 500 to 1 # 000 miles , &quot; Petersen says . &quot; But those miles might not appear in your account_for some time . If you need to reach an award level quickly , think_about applying over the telephone for an airline-affiliated credit_card . The banks are on-line with the airlines . If you are approved , the enrollment bonus ( typically 2 # 500 or 5 # 000 miles ) should appear in your account right away. &quot; If you ' re going to use your mileage for leisure travel , select your destinations wisely . Don ' t spend 20 # 000 miles on a ticket to San Francisco that can be purchased for about $ 100 round_trip or less in_advance . Use your free ticket on more expensive destinations , such_as out-of-the-way cities with limited airline competition , hence higher-than-average fares . You don ' t have to live_on airplanes to reap the benefits of the frequent flier programs . In 1994 , an estimated 40 % of all miles were earned on the ground . And mileage opportunities have now expanded far beyond rental cars , hotels and credit_cards . For example , every time you spend more_than $ 29.99 to send flowers by calling 800-FLOWERS , you will receive 300 miles from United ' s Mileage Plus . On Dec . 1 , American AAdvantage began a dining program , whereby three miles are earned for every dollar ( excluding gratuity , but including tax ) spent at more_than 2 # 000 restaurants nationwide . Some of today ' s on-the-ground mileage offers are quite generous . Be approved for a Diner ' s Club card ( annual fee : $ 80 ) and receive 10 # 000 miles in any major U.S. carrier ' s mileage program . Send Delta a slide showing one of the carrier ' s vacation destinations ( preferably without people ) before Dec . 31 . If Delta uses the photo in one of its publications , you ' ll be 10 # 000 miles richer . ( Telephone 800-323-2323 for information. ) Times Travel Writer Christopher Reynolds is_on assignment .</TEXT>
