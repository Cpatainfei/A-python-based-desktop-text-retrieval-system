   <TEXT> BRAZIL 1994 by Pamela Bloom and CARIBBEAN 1994 by Margaret Zellers ( both Fielding Worldwide , Inc. , $ 16.95 paper ) . The Fielding travel-book empire seems to be thriving . Handsome , freshly revised guidebooks are appearing under the imprint almost monthly , it seems , and in the best Fielding tradition ( travel-guide pioneer Temple Fielding caught the last plane out_in 1983 , and his company is now owned by Robert Young Pelton ) , they are detailed and opinionated and authoritative . Pamela Bloom ' s guide to Brazil is energetic and colorful , and includes plenty of asides on the country ' s varied and seductive music ( on which Bloom is an acknowledged expert ) . The practical guidebook information ( hotel prices and phone_numbers , shop hours , etc. ) is more extensive than in many Fielding guides . Don ' t trust Margaret Zellers on music , though . She tells us that entrepreneur Richard Branson ( of Virgin Records , Virgin Atlantic Airlines , etc. , and owner of the private Caribbean resort Necker Island ) produced albums by one &quot; Richard Bowie &quot; -- the name , of course , should be David Bowie . Other_than that , she seems quite knowledgeable on her subject -- as well she might be , since this is her 16th Caribbean guide for Fielding . BELGIUM 1994 by H . Constance Hill , BRITAIN 1994 by Joseph and Judith Raff , FRANCE 1994 by Gary Kraut , HOLLAND 1994 by H . Constance Hill , ITALY 1994 by Lynn V . Foster and Lawrence Foster , SCANDINAVIA 1994 by Martha Berman , SPAIN &amp; PORTUGAL 1994 by A . Hoyt Hobbs and Joy Adzigian , SWITZERLAND AND THE ALPINE REGION by Margaret Zellers and EUROPE 1994 by Joseph and Judith Raff ( all Fielding Worldwide , Inc. , $ 16.95 paper ) . More in-depth Fielding-style guidebooks , covering most of the more popular European destinations . Full of authors ' personal tips and asides , the books seem more personal and thus more credible than many similarly encyclopedic volumes . One maddening thing , though : There seems to be no consistent style for the hard-core facts and figures . Thus , for instance , some hotel and restaurant recommendations include address , phone_number and prices , while others include none of the above , or only one or two of them . The same is true of opening hours and prices for monuments and museums , data about shops , etc . Whether this is simple sloppiness or some misguided but intentional stylistic idiosyncrasy , I don ' t know -- but it ' s very annoying , and , at the very least , means that travelers will have to supplement these otherwise comprehensive guides with competing guidebooks just to get the essential details . BUDGET EUROPE 1994 by Joseph and Judith Raff ( Fielding Worldwide , Inc. , $ 16.95 paper ) , THE GREAT SIGHTS OF EUROPE 1994 by Patricia and Robert Foulke ( Fielding Worldwide , Inc. , $ 16.95 paper and SHOPPING EUROPE 1994 by Joseph and Judith Raff ( Fielding Worldwide , Inc. , $ 12.95 ) . These are three other new Fielding titles , with self-explanatory specialized focuses , to which the above comments apply . EGYPT by Michael Haag ( Cadogan Guides / Globe Pequot Press , $ 16.95 paper ) and EGYPT &amp; THE SUDAN , third edition , by Scott Wayne and Damien Simonis ( Lonely Planet , $ 16.95 paper ) . Tourists aren ' t necessarily welcome in Egypt today , or rather aren ' t necessarily welcomed by all Egyptians ; but if you ' re going , either or both of these would be splendid companions for the journey . Like all_the Cadogan Guides , Haag ' s book is reasonably comprehensive and written in a lively style that manages to be informative without ever becoming pedantic . The Lonely Planet approach is a bit more oriented toward detail and inside_information ; using it is like traveling with an old Egypt hand . Books to Go appears the second and fourth week of every month .</TEXT>
