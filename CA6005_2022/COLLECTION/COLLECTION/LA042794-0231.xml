   <TEXT> Marriage Rights : If Assembly Bill 3130 becomes law , California brides and grooms will be hearing &quot; congratulations , &quot; &quot; best wishes &quot; and &quot; here are your rights under law. &quot; Assemblywoman Diane Martinez ( D-Alhambra ) says that because too many couples go_into marriage with only a vague idea of what it all means , she has proposed a marriage brochure to be distributed by county clerks to all couples applying for a marriage_license , starting June 1 , 1995 . The brochure would cover state law on such topics as domestic violence , spousal rape , community and separate property , spousal support , child custody and support , and premarital agreements . Women will learn how changing their last_names may affect their credit rating . If it sounds as if Martinez is raining on their wedding , the legislator notes that two-thirds of all first marriages end in divorce in California . Many women suing for divorce cite domestic violence as a major complaint , she says . Currently , most couples have less information about getting_married than they do about buying a car , Martinez says . &quot; If we expect couples to live_up_to the rights and responsibilities of the marriage_contract , the least we can do is let them know what those duties are , &quot; she says . The proposed bill ' s first hearing is scheduled Thursday before the Assembly Ways and Means Committee . * Money Matters : Although they may be growing in number , women who call the family ' s investment shots are still far from the majority . &quot; Women in_general -- but married_women in particular -- are more involved_with day-to-day finances than they are with investment decisions . But that will change , &quot; says Bridget A . Macaskill , president of the New York-based Oppenheimer Management Corp . In a nationwide survey of 2 # 021 adults , the company found that 60 % of the women who were married or living with someone were solely responsible_for balancing the checkbook , 56 % paid the bills and 38 % were responsible_for developing and maintaining the family budget . Of the 1 # 018 women surveyed , 90 % said investing is not a man ' s job -- and 85 % of the 1 # 003 men surveyed agreed . But only 17 % of the women handled the insurance and 12 % were solely responsible_for making investments . * Playing_at Sports : Sports participation among children should be adapted to both age and gender to prevent injury and to continue to foster a healthy enjoyment of the game , says Dr. Gerard Varlotta , a professor at New York University Medical_Center . Age especially is an important factor_in helping a child enjoy sports . A child younger than 8 , for example , is generally not skilled enough to be involved in a strict regimen of sports training , Varlotta says . And instead of making sports activity a competition , he adds , emphasis should be placed on &quot; free &quot; playtime as well as having a child play_at his or her own level . It is important to limit any bodily contact in sports played by very young children . Contact not only increases the potential for injury , but also boosts the odds that any injuries sustained will be the more serious types . * This family roundup , compiled from wire_service reports , appears in Life &amp; Style on Wednesdays .</TEXT>
