   <HEADLINE> UNITED STATES , UNITED NATIONS STUMBLE OVER ROCKY RELATIONSHIP ; DIPLOMACY : TESTINESS MARKS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLASHES . AT_ISSUE , AIDES SAY , ARE TWO DISTINCT CONCEPTS OF THE SECRETARY_GENERAL ' S JOB .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.N. diplomats and officials are alarmed by the sometimes acrimonious and often exasperated feelings that have marred relations between Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the Clinton_Administration in recent months . The troubles surfaced at the end of February , when the press attache for U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright rebuked the secretary_general for writing a letter to Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin suggesting &quot; some kind of United Nations presence &quot; in the occupied territories . &quot; We do not think the secretary_general ' s suggestion is particularly helpful or useful , &quot; said James P . Rubin , the attache , in a rare public reprimand . This testiness was a manifestation of an even more profound conflict in private . Relations have fallen to such depths , reports an ambassador on the Security_Council , that a diplomat from the U.S. mission to the United Nations vowed recently that &quot; we will destroy &quot; the secretary_general if he dares to stand_in the way of any North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina . &quot; What are they talking_about ? &quot; the ambassador asked . &quot; Is this Nikita Khrushchev trying to destroy Dag Hammarskjold ? The secretary_general cannot be anyone ' s puppet . He must represent the United Nations . And , in the case of the bombing , his approach was the correct one . . . . All this fighting is no good for the U.N. We cannot have the U.N. and the United States opposed to each other. &quot; A good_deal of hyperbole infused the supposed threat of the U.S. diplomat : There is , for example , no mechanism for members of the United Nations to remove a secretary_general from office . A U.S. official , in fact , denies that members of the U.S. mission to the United Nations use that kind of language about the secretary_general . But there is no doubt that U.S. diplomats have berated Boutros-Ghali in private for issuing statements that smacked of a reluctance to order air strikes . Although Boutros-Ghali makes a show of brushing_off criticism , he knows that he has much to lose from a sour relationship with the most powerful member of the United Nations . &quot; I need the United States , &quot; he said in a speech in Washington in late October . &quot; The United Nations needs the United States . Finding the right relationship between the U.N. and the U.S. may be one of the most important tasks of our time. &quot; The problem is only partly personal . The secretary_general can be stubborn and arrogant and contemptuous . But he can also be charming and courtly in private , and both sides insist that -- despite some angry exchanges over Somalia last fall -- he and Albright now deal with each other with warmth and good-natured banter . At issue , U.N. and U.S. aides said , are two distinct concepts of the job of secretary_general . Boutros-Ghali , 71 , a former professor and deputy foreign_minister in Egypt , conceives of an active role for himself , one of an international political_leader offering a host of peace initiatives , his power moored in the moral_force of an organization representing 184 governments . His aides said his authority was established in Article 99 of the U.N. Charter , which states , in its entirety , that &quot; the secretary_general may bring_to the attention of the Security_Council any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security. &quot; U.S. officials believe that Boutros-Ghali is reading too_much into this sentence . In the prevailing view among U.S. officials , he is an international civil_servant charged with carrying_out policy , not making_it . Albright has said that Boutros-Ghali should regard himself as &quot; a chief administrative officer &quot; serving the Security_Council as if it were his board of directors . &quot; The secretary_general often oversteps his role , &quot; a U.S. official said , &quot; and some of the things he does are counterproductive. &quot; Not only does this complicate delicate international problems , the official said , but &quot; it gives critics like Sen . ( Robert ) Dole an opportunity to lambaste the United Nations and hurt the constituency for the U.N. in the United States. &quot; Dole , the Senate Republican leader who likes to pronounce the secretary_general ' s unusual name in mocking tones , regularly admonishes the White_House against letting Boutros-Ghali set U.S. foreign_policy . Some of the sharpest rhetoric leveled at Boutros-Ghali has come from two Reagan_Administration officials who share the view that he is trying to usurp power : former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick , who derides Boutros-Ghali as a would-be &quot; commander_in_chief of the world , &quot; and former Assistant Secretary_of_State Richard Armitage , who claims that the secretary_general acts_as though he were &quot; chief_executive_officer of the world. &quot; Clinton_Administration officials believe that Boutros-Ghali sets himself up for such attacks by stretching the limits of his office beyond political bounds . But Edward Luck , president of the U.N. Assn . of the United States , a citizen group that supports the United Nations , said the real problem lies_in the conflict between the activism of the secretary_general and the minimalist approach of President Clinton to foreign affairs . &quot; The United Nations has become a symbol of activist internationalism at a time when the United States would like the world to go_away , &quot; Luck said in a recent interview . &quot; The secretary_general is trying to expand his role at a time when the United States would like him to be_quiet . He has become the nagging voice in the middle of the night. &quot; Luck believes that Boutros-Ghali should rein_in this nagging voice . &quot; The secretary_general has thought more about his role than any other secretary_general , &quot; he said . &quot; He has a pretty coherent idea of what he wants to do . But he shouldn ' t preach about it . He pays too_little attention to the political nuances of how and when something is said. &quot; But Luck also believes that the problem is exacerbated by the narrow goals of Clinton ' s foreign_policy . &quot; It ' s as if the stars are crossed , &quot; he said . &quot; We have an activist secretary_general with a lot of ideas and an Administration with a minimalist foreign_policy that does not want to be reminded about what goes_on in the world. &quot; The fiasco in Somalia in early October that left 18 U.S. soldiers dead badly bruised relations . Boutros-Ghali felt betrayed when Clinton announced a March 31 withdrawal of all U.S. troops after the soldiers died in a battle with the militia of Gen . Mohammed Farah Aidid . From the secretary_general ' s point_of_view , the operation had been fashioned to U.S. specifications . The Americans had handpicked the key U.N. staff for Somalia , including retired U.S. Adm . Jonathan Howe as the civilian chief . They had persuaded Boutros-Ghali to appoint an American favorite , Kofi Annan of Ghana , as the undersecretary general in_charge of peacekeeping . The Americans even demanded and won the right to keep the Rangers and other U.S. combat troops under U.S. rather than U.N. command . On top of this , U.S. officials had pledged full support to Boutros-Ghali ' s plan to disarm the warring factions of Somalia and , after an ambush of Pakistani peacekeepers , to hunt_down Aidid as a criminal . All this changed after the October deaths . U.S. officials , from Clinton downward , led the public to believe that the Americans had been ordered into battle by the United Nations and Boutros-Ghali . In a televised address , Clinton announced that , in preparation for eventual withdrawal , he was immediately dispatching reinforcements to Somalia . &quot; These forces will be under American command , &quot; he said , leaving unspoken the false implication that the others had been under U.N. command . Boutros-Ghali believed that the U.S. had made him the scapegoat for the October debacle and had undercut his goal of aggressive U.N. peace enforcement in crippled lands such_as Somalia . And Boutros-Ghali was infuriated when Clinton then sent Ambassador Robert Oakley -- an antagonist of the secretary_general during the Bush_Administration ' s Somalia expedition involving 28 # 500 Marines -- back to Somalia to assuage Aidid and straighten_out the political mess . The view of U.S. officials is far different . They believe that the secretary_general ' s hatred for Aidid -- first honed , they said , in his Egyptian Foreign Ministry days -- had misled the U.S. Rangers into the manhunt . Boutros-Ghali ' s theories about aggressive peacekeeping may look persuasive on paper , U.S. officials said , but a U.S. President cannot afford to shed the blood of his troops on a distant and remote adventure . Some U.S. officials acknowledged that the Administration was unfair in heaping so_much public blame on Boutros-Ghali . A Pentagon official called it &quot; shameless. &quot; But they nevertheless resented Boutros-Ghali ' s whining about it . U.S. officials believed that it was unseemly for an international civil_servant to so blatantly attack the most powerful member of his board of directors in public . Similar misunderstandings confuse the conflict over air strikes . In June , the Security_Council authorized NATO , &quot; subject_to close coordination with the secretary_general , &quot; to use air_power to protect U.N. peacekeepers and deter aggression in Sarajevo and other besieged towns of Bosnia-Herzegovina . Boutros-Ghali interpreted the resolution as granting him the final say on any use of NATO air_power in Bosnia . But his comments implied that he feared the consequences of air strikes and would approve them only with great reluctance . Diplomatic admirers believe that his reluctance reflected his reading of the mood in NATO : The United States and its West European allies were not ready for air strikes . Boutros-Ghali sensed a change in that mood after the deadly Feb . 5 missile attack on the marketplace in Sarajevo . He then called_on NATO to prepare_for air strikes and delegated his authority to launch them to U.N. and NATO officials on the scene . In the view of his admirers , Boutros-Ghali diverted public anger over inaction in Bosnia from the United States and Western Europe to the United Nations for six months and then , when the time was ripe , galvanized NATO into action . U.S. officials see the situation differently . They believe that , no matter what the legal mooring of the resolution , the secretary_general should not have asserted his power to decide what was really a military matter . Military expertise is a hallmark of neither his experience nor his office . Even more important , the Americans believe that he made himself an obstacle to air strikes by his obvious reluctance to use them . As the Americans see it , Boutros-Ghali relented , changed his mind about the need for air strikes and transferred authority to his officials on the scene only after he was pressured to do so by U.S. diplomats .</TEXT>
