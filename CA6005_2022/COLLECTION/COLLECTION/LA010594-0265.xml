   <HEADLINE> WHEN EARLY ACTING CAREERS CAREEN TO AN END ; ADVOCACY : PAUL PETERSEN OF ' THE DONNA REED SHOW ' HAS ESTABLISHED A SUPPORT GROUP FOR FORMER YOUNG ACTORS WHO HAVE FACED REAL-LIFE HORROR STORIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last winter , Paul Petersen was awakened by a frantic call . &quot; It was this kid calling from the Roxy , &quot; recalls Petersen , 48 , an author and onetime child actor who played Jeff on &quot; The Donna Reed Show &quot; from 1958 through 1966 . &quot; He said he saw River Phoenix in one of the nightclub ' s bathroom stalls shooting heroin. &quot; Petersen , who for four years has been organizing support groups for former child stars and the pressure they face in an often indifferent Hollywood , sprang into action . A few days later , he and a group of other former child actors knocked_on the front_door of Phoenix ' s Los Angeles home and confronted him with the story . &quot; I told him we ' d all been there , &quot; he says . &quot; But he just told us there was no problem. &quot; Phoenix closed the door , cutting_off the attempted intervention . In late October , when Petersen heard of the 23-year-old Phoenix ' s heroin and cocaine overdose , he was neither surprised nor especially upset . &quot; At least we ' d tried to intervene ; we gave him an option , &quot; says Petersen . &quot; I could sleep after hearing about River , but I couldn ' t after I heard about Rusty. &quot; &quot; Rusty &quot; was Rusty Hamer , who played Danny Thomas ' son on &quot; The Danny Thomas Show. &quot; In January , 1990 , Hamer , then 42 , shot himself to death , ending a life of poverty and depression near New Orleans . Hamer ' s life had been sadly similar to those of many child stars , never living_up_to those moments of fame bestowed at a young age . Once he grew_up , Hollywood was no longer interested . He had no skills , no money and no education . His life spiraled downward through drugs , alcohol and depression . * &quot; What bothers me about Rusty was that I could have helped , &quot; says Petersen , who can still cause pedestrians on his Gardena street to stop and squint their eyes in recognition . &quot; I didn ' t get involved even though the book I was working_on at the time -- to be called ' A Minor Consideration ' -- was about the problems of child actors . The morning I heard , I said to my wife , ' Rana , it ' s time to do something. ' &quot; Petersen never finished the book , but he took its title for his nonprofit support and advocacy group . &quot; A Minor Consideration is a support and intervention group for anybody who ' s ever been a child actor , &quot; he says . &quot; You don ' t have to sign_up ; if you were a child actor , you ' re already a member . And we ' re also an advocacy group . There are a lot of laws and practices we ' d like to see changed . &quot; They say children in this industry are protected . Bull---- . Hollywood would save Bosnia before the life of a single child actor. &quot; * Contrary to his easygoing small-screen persona , Petersen , he is the first to admit , is not a reasonable advocate of change . He is , he says , &quot; an in-your-face militant &quot; on the subject of children in Hollywood . His anger is always close to the surface , a result , he says , of seeing no positive changes in a system that treated him and his contemporaries , as well as child actors today , &quot; as nothing more_than chattel. &quot; Growing_up in Iowa and Southern California , Petersen was , briefly , one of the original 16 Mousketeers . A number of commercials and a star turn_in &quot; Houseboat &quot; with Cary Grant landed him , in 1958 , the role of Jeff on &quot; The Donna Reed Show , &quot; a character he would portray for the next eight years . Petersen ' s own crises didn ' t happen while he was actually a child star . &quot; Whatever dark period I had came_after the show , &quot; he says , though he admits that running_around Hollywood with pals Ricky Nelson , Tony Dow ( &quot; Leave It to Beaver &quot; ) , Don Grady ( &quot; My Three Sons &quot; ) and Johnny Crawford ( &quot; The Rifleman &quot; ) in fast cars while imbibing large amounts of alcohol was not exactly a normal childhood . &quot; In 1966 , I worked 16 weeks ; in 1968 , four weeks ; and in 1969 , I didn ' t work_at all . By then , I was a complete basket case. &quot; It was advice from another former child actor that sobered him up . &quot; I was living_in Encino in a house I could no longer afford when , one day , Mickey Rooney showed_up . He told me that Hollywood would n ' t hire me again for another 25 years . He told me to go find another life. &quot; Petersen moved to Connecticut , attended Yale and began a new life as a writer . He has 16 books to his credit , including &quot; Walt , Mickey and Me , &quot; an account of the lives of the original Mousketeers after they turned_in their ears , most of which , he says , &quot; were pretty desperate. &quot; &quot; I had no plan when I started , &quot; he says . &quot; At that time , Danny Bonaduce ( &quot; The Partridge Family &quot; ) was in jail in Florida on drug charges , Todd Bridges ( &quot; Diff ' rent Strokes &quot; ) was going_to court on attempted murder , Gary Coleman ( &quot; Diff ' rent Strokes &quot; ) was about to sue his parents and Jay North ( &quot; Dennis the Menace &quot; ) was tormented by personal problems. &quot; The roar of the crowd watching Miami ' s two-minute drill against Pittsburgh on &quot; Monday Night Football &quot; is timid compared to the child-actor bull_session in Petersen ' s small living_room . The subject is financial abuse ; horror stories are familiar to all present : Petersen , Lee Aaker ( &quot; Rin Tin Tin &quot; ) , Julia Benjamin ( &quot; Hazel &quot; ) , Beverly Washburn ( &quot; Old Yeller &quot; ) , Bobby Diamond ( &quot; Fury &quot; ) and Randy Boone ( &quot; The Virginian &quot; ) . &quot; Shirley Temple Black supported a household of 12 , including her mother and father , throughout her career , &quot; recites Petersen . &quot; When she reached the end of her career , do you know what she had ? A few thousand dollars and the deed to her dollhouse in the back yard of her parents ' home_in Beverly Hills. &quot; * Lee Aaker had $ 20 # 000 when he left show_business . He said he asked his mother recently what happened to the other hundreds of thousands of dollars . She said she didn ' t know . Beverly Washburn had $ 250 when she became an adult . &quot; When my mother sold the house she ' d bought with my earnings , she gave me $ 50 to go buy a new pantsuit , &quot; she says , her eyes welling with tears . &quot; I know she loved me . I guess she just didn ' t know any better. &quot; California ' s Coogan Law was enacted in the 1930s , after child actor Jackie Coogan successfully sued his parents over the mishandling of his earnings . Since then , the law requires that a percentage of the child ' s earnings be placed in blocked accounts . That in theory is fine , Petersen says , but more often than not , unscrupulous parents and business managers get the courts to set the terms aside , which can be done if the courts believe a better financial situation is being created for the child . A case_in_point is Gary Coleman . His parents and business managers had Coogan Law provisions set_aside so they could create a pension_fund from Coleman ' s earnings . They omitted telling the judge , however , that they were also employees of Coleman ' s production company . Later , they dissolved the pension_fund . The parents ' pension was $ 770 # 000 ; Coleman ' s was $ 220 # 000 . Last year , Coleman , 25 , successfully sued his parents and managers for $ 3.8 million . &quot; When I first met him , he was living_in a condo in Fox Hills with a single chair and a mattress , &quot; says Petersen . &quot; This is a kid whose career is over , who has no kidneys and is_on dialysis 18 hours a week . He made $ 24 million during his career . Why wasn ' t there anyone protecting his interests ? &quot; As devastating as it is to learn you have nothing at the end of your childhood career , everyone in Petersen ' s living room agrees that even worse is finding that you are no longer wanted . Stan Ziegler , a Beverly Hills psychologist who specializes in child actors , says many of his clients have their development arrested when their TV series or movie careers end . &quot; These kids are treated like royalty , &quot; he says . &quot; Instead of a natural childhood of acne and budding breasts , they are pampered , protected and catered to . Suddenly , that world ends and they are forced to make this adjustment to the real_world . Most can ' t. &quot; Ziegler says the most notable current case_in_point is Michael Jackson . &quot; People spend a lot of time trying to find reasons for his behavior . I think there is no question but that most of his problems stem from being a child star. &quot; * While Petersen would like to see legislation passed providing more protection to child actors , he believes the lion ' s share of responsibility should fall to the Screen Actors Guild . &quot; With ( a budget of several million dollars ) , you ' d think the guild could provide independent business managers to these kids . You ' d think after nine years on ' Diff ' rent Strokes , ' Dana Plato , or Lisa Loring ( &quot; Addams Family &quot; ) would qualify for drug and alcohol rehab . But they don ' t earn enough in residuals to qualify for the medical plan , so they ' re out on the street. &quot; Both actresses have had very public problems with drug_abuse . SAG president Barry Gordon , a former child actor himself ( among other films , he appeared in &quot; The Girl can ' t Help It &quot; and &quot; Cinderfella &quot; ) , declined to comment . Petersen also believes it is the responsibility of the guild and producers alike to make_sure there is a stable and safe environment for kids to work in . On &quot; Father Knows Best , &quot; he points_out , America ' s ideal family was headed by an active alcoholic ( Robert Young , who has spoken at length about his problem ) , and the child actors -- Elinor Donahue , Billy Gray and Lauren Chapin -- all suffered from a variety of personal problems . Chapin detailed hers ( including heroin_addiction and a stint as a call_girl ) in her 1988 autobiography , &quot; Father Does Know Best. &quot; &quot; Things haven ' t changed that much ; there are still shows like that on today , &quot; says Petersen . &quot; We call ' Diff ' rent Strokes ' ( which is now on the air only in reruns ) the series from hell : Dana Plato , arrested for shoplifting , drug_abuse ; Todd Bridges , arrested for murder ; Gary Coleman , suing his parents to get his money . And this town considers it all business as usual. &quot; Despite the militancy the group voices in_demanding change , A Minor Consideration is , at its core , a safe haven for those who have undergone the trauma of childhood fame . Julie Benjamin , who has played lots of small parts , mostly in commercials , does not fall_into any of the group ' s usual categories . She has never abused drugs or alcohol and has worked steadily since her debut in a commercial at age 5 . Last year , however , while tending a family barbecue in Florida , Benjamin was attacked by a 100-pound Akita and severely mauled . Dozens of stitches , months of recuperation and a divorce later , she is still trying to put her life back together . And she finds the support of people who have been through the grueling spotlight of child stardom somehow can help her . &quot; These are my brothers and sisters , &quot; she says , gazing around the room . &quot; Sometimes I talk and sometimes I cry , but they always give their shoulders. &quot;</TEXT>
