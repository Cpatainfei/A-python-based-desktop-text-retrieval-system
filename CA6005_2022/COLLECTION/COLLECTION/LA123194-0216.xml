   <HEADLINE> WILSON ATTACKS AFFIRMATIVE_ACTION LAWS ; BIAS : GOVERNOR SAYS HE FAVORS ABOLISHING PREFERENCE RULES FOR THOSE ENTERING GOVERNMENT JOBS AND COLLEGE ADMISSIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson has given new impetus to a movement to abolish the state ' s affirmative_action laws with the disclosure that he favors doing_away_with longstanding preference requirements for women and minorities entering government jobs and college . Wilson , who has never before attacked affirmative_action laws so directly , told local reporters during a round of year-end interviews that he now believes the efforts to compensate for decades of discrimination &quot; have gone_farther than perhaps most people would have intended. &quot; &quot; I don ' t think that it ' s fair to give preference based upon race or gender , &quot; the governor said . &quot; I think what we should do is make those judgments based upon merit after affording real equality and opportunity of access. &quot; Although the governor did not endorse any proposal for eliminating affirmative_action in state hiring and college admissions , supporters of legislative and initiative proposals said his remarks would give added momentum to their movement . Assemblyman Bernie Richter ( R-Chico ) , who has proposed a constitutional amendment to eliminate affirmative_action laws , said the governor had not told him in_advance of his plan to speak out on the issue and the remarks came as a &quot; pleasant surprise. &quot; &quot; I think it ' s an indication of what will come , &quot; Richter said . &quot; I think there is massive support in the community for this , and it will be an issue at both the national and state levels. &quot; Richter said his strategy would be to first try to get the proposal through the Legislature , where a similar measure was defeated last year . He said he expected that the plan would pass committees in the Assembly in the coming session but he was pessimistic about its chances_on the floor , where a two-thirds vote is needed for passage . If it fails in the Legislature , he said his hopes rest with a statewide petition drive to place it on the ballot as a voter initiative . Opponents attached political significance to Wilson ' s remarks , suggesting that they provided further proof of the Republican governor ' s ambitions to run_for President . &quot; Governor Wilson was reelected by attacking immigrants , &quot; said state Sen . Richard Polanco ( D-Los Angeles ) , &quot; and he ' s gearing_up for a presidential bid by demonizing equal_opportunity for women and minorities. &quot; Polanco said it is irresponsible to consider abolishing affirmative_action laws without determining if there is any statistical basis for such a move . Juanita Ontiveros , an activist with the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation , said Wilson ' s attack on affirmative_action represents another &quot; horror &quot; for the rural poor . She called it an &quot; extension of Proposition 187 , &quot; the successful ballot measure backed by Wilson that proposed to deny education and most public health benefits to illegal immigrants . ( Most aspects of Proposition 187 have been frozen by a federal court. ) Ontiveros said Wilson is at cross purposes with his own policies by trying to eliminate affirmative_action . &quot; He wants people to leave public assistance but he ' s doing_away_with those programs that help them become part of the work force. &quot; In his remarks , Wilson said he believed that affirmative_action goals are a misguided approach to the problems of the poor and underprivileged . He said a better way to deal with their problems is through programs that strengthen the family . He said many poor people lack access to jobs not because of color or gender but because they have been &quot; members of dysfunctional families and not really starting life with the kind of opportunity that is available to others in what we have been inclined to think_of as a normal home. &quot;</TEXT>
