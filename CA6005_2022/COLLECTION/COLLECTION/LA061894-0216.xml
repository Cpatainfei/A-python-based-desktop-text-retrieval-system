   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; TODAY AT A GLANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> GROUP_A at Silverdome , Pontiac , Mich . Switzerland vs . United States * TIME : 8:30 a.m. PDT . * TV : ABC , Univision . * KEY MATCHUPS : This could be a game in which the teams ' strengths and weaknesses cancel each other.Switzerland ' s strength is up front , with striker Stephane Chapuisat and forward Adrian Knup . The U.S. team also has most of its experience and skill up front . If the American forwards have to spend their energy dropping_back to help_out on defense , it could be a long , scoreless day for the U.S. team . The Americans have done_well winning balls in the air . This , plus their fitness , should be an advantage , especially late in the game . Older , slow Swiss defenders can be defeated by U.S. quickness , but , so , too , might the_Swiss forwards ' ballhandling skills befuddle the U.S. back line . U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic has shown a willingness to play with as_many defenders as necessary . If Switzerland scores early , look_for a traffic_jam of U.S. players in front of their goal . * OUTLOOK : With three points for a victory , the Americans can reasonably hope to get beyond the first round . The Swiss are not a complete team , but they do_well with what they have and finished only one point behind Italy in qualifying . The U.S. team has shown resilience , a trait it has cultivated while falling_behind in most games . * OUTCOME : Considering that the United States will finally be playing before a supportive home crowd , and that the heat and humidity will hurt the_Swiss more_than the Americans , and that the U.S. team appears to be peaking : United States by one goal .
