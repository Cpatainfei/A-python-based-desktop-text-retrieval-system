   <HEADLINE> BOARD PITCHES LOCAL CLEAN-AIR PLAN TO EPA ; POLLUTION : SUPERVISORS WILL REQUEST MANY PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL PROPOSAL BE REPLACED WITH THOSE DRAFTED BY COUNTY BUSINESS_LEADERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Backing an anti-smog plan drafted by business_leaders , Ventura County supervisors Tuesday urged federal regulators to adopt an alternative proposal that supporters say will meet health standards without undue harm to the local economy . The supervisors voted unanimously to request that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency replace many provisions of its own clean-air plan with those written by the Ventura County Economic Development Assn and the Council on Economic Vitality . The local plan would relieve businesses of a proposed EPA regulation requiring annual reductions in emissions and would allow companies to get credit for previous reductions in smog . As written , the local plan also shifts some of the burden of reducing emissions from stationary sources of pollution to cars and other mobile sources . It includes a controversial proposal that would charge motorists an annual fee based on how much they drive and how much their vehicles pollute . &quot; The original ( EPA ) plan would be prohibitive for business , &quot; said Supervisor Maggie Kildee , who urged the board to adopt the alternative plan . &quot; The ( local ) plan includes other sources like motor_vehicles and doesn ' t place the entire burden on the business community. &quot; In separate action , the county ' s Air_Pollution Control_Board , which includes the five county supervisors as well as city representatives , endorsed its staff ' s recommendations that the EPA adopt many of the measures in the local anti-smog plan . County pollution control staff_members helped develop the local plan . But one Air_Pollution Control_Board member dissented , arguing that the board should oppose the EPA air cleanup plan and propose no alternatives . &quot; I ask the board to go_on record with Fillmore and Camarillo and oppose the entire federal implementation plan to try to get something we can live with , &quot; said Michael McMahan , a Fillmore city councilman . The EPA , which is under court_order to clean_up the county ' s air , is scheduled to adopt a final air cleanup plan Feb . 14 . The federal Clean Air Act forced the federal_government to step_in when the county failed to meet federal clean air health standards on its own . The federal plan , once adopted , will also apply to the Sacramento and Los Angeles regions , which have also been designated to have &quot; severe &quot; air quality problems . Some of those problems could be curtailed with more stringent controls on private vehicles , said county Air_Pollution Control Officer Richard Baldwin . In his comments to the EPA , Baldwin asked the federal_government to require a strict new smog-check program that would centralize all check stations . Baldwin also said the EPA correctly included controls on emissions from pesticides . But he urged the federal_government to allow the state time to develop its own regulation based on complete information from the pesticide manufacturers . Ed Frost , manager of the Oxnard Pest Control Assn. , questioned the economic effects of pesticide controls on the agriculture industry . &quot; EPA doesn ' t have a clue of what this will cost &quot; the industry , he said . Andy Caldwell , executive_director of the Coalition of Labor , Agriculture and Business , urged the Air_Pollution Control_Board to reject both the EPA and the local plan , contending that lobbying in Washington and congressional action could change the U.S. Clean Air Act , making the cleanup plan moot . &quot; We do not need the federal_government to interfere in California , &quot; Caldwell said . &quot; We either need one nationwide federal implementation plan or none. &quot; But Russ Baggerly , a former aide to Supervisor Maria VanderKolk and longtime area activist , urged the board to adopt the alternative plan . &quot; The principle here is to protect the health , safety and welfare of every man , woman and child of Ventura County from the devastating effects of air_pollution , &quot; he said . The local alternative &quot; provides a chance for good air quality and economic vitality .</TEXT>
