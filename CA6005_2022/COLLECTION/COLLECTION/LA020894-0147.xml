   <TEXT> Some guidelines for teaching children about money : * Preschool : By the time they ' re toilet-trained , most children are already familiar_with the rudimentary workings of money -- that it ' s needed to buy stuff and that some coins and bills will buy more stuff than others . Young children are also beginning to pick_up attitudes about money from their parents as they observe them shopping for groceries , paying bills or just talking at dinner . Bonnie Drew , author of &quot; Money Skills : 101 Activities to Teach Your Child About Money , &quot; recommends making a game out of teaching preschoolers money skills , like creating a pretend toy store with a play cash_register and play money , or making picture flash_cards of money . * Grade_school : Most children are ready for weekly allowances when they start school . Experts discourage tying allowances to regular household chores but encourage paying extra for additional work . How much is doled_out depends_on a child ' s needs and the household income . According to Zillions , the kids ' version of Consumer Reports magazine , the average is a dollar a week for each grade a child is in . Experts suggest paying in single bills or coins . Drew suggests having the child divide an allowance into three parts for spending , saving and sharing . Neale S . Godfrey , author of &quot; The Kids ' Money Book , &quot; proposes slightly different categories -- spending , short-term saving and long-term saving -- and even recommends setting some money aside for &quot; taxes. &quot; * Junior_high and high_school : By age 12 , many children are earning money outside the home -- baby-sitting or mowing lawns , for example . Experts suggest raising allowances at this point to teach youngsters how to budget each month for things like clothes , movies and school supplies . It ' s important to have them stick_to that budget , they say . &quot; They ' ll learn that they can buy those expensive designer clothes , but they may_not be able to buy much else , &quot; says Godfrey . Some parents phase_out allowances by the time their children turn 16 and are getting regular paychecks from part-time jobs . Teen-agers should be encouraged to open a savings account and to consider investments . Some banks offer special accounts with low fees , while a_few mutual_funds let investors get started for as little as $ 250 . * College : Living within a budget is especially important now , as_many students will be out on_their_own for the first time . If they haven ' t learned the concept by now , there are a number of self-help and personal finance books available today . Students will need to open a checking_account , but experts are split on whether a credit_card is necessary . Proponents say credit_cards allow young adults to build a credit history while handling emergency expenses . But opponents say they only entice students to spend more_than they have . Godfrey suggests getting a secured card with a $ 500 or $ 1 # 000 deposit that can be used for emergencies .</TEXT>
