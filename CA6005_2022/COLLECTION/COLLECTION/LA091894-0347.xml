   <HEADLINE> MOSCOW JUGGLES CONFLICTS IN FORMER SOVIET TERRITORY ; RUSSIA : AN ACCORD BROKERED IN IRAN MAY HAVE DEFUSED HOSTILITIES IN TAJIKISTAN . TWO ENCLAVES IN CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS REMAIN HOT SPOTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the United States threatened to invade Haiti , Russia was busy in its own southern yard Saturday , arranging a cease-fire in one guerrilla war , covertly meddling in another and scrambling to prevent an old one from reigniting . All three conflicts -- in the former Soviet Central Asian republic of Tajikistan and the Caucasus Mountain enclaves of Chechnya and Abkhazia -- have been simmering since the end of the Cold_War , challenging Russia and its army for nearly as long as Haiti ' s dictatorship has defied Washington . Struggling to control events throughout the former Soviet_Union , the Russians last week found all three fronts heating_up at once . On Saturday , they apparently managed to defuse the biggest conflict , helping forge a cease-fire between Tajikistan ' s Moscow-backed government and the guerrilla-led opposition after two years of fighting and 20 # 000 deaths . The accord , signed_in Tehran and reported by Russian news_agencies , is to take_effect as soon as international observers are deployed in Tajikistan . The two sides agreed to exchange hundreds of prisoners and to continue talks aimed at getting the Tajik opposition , a loose alliance of democrats and Islamic fundamentalists , to take_part in presidential elections Nov . 6 . Arguing the need to stop the spread of Islam , Russia ordered its troops to drive the Tajik alliance from power in October , 1992 , and install a clan of former Communists . The troops , now numbering 25 # 000 , then stayed to fight_off the opposition ' s guerrilla attacks , launched mostly from Afghanistan . But the Russian intervention has been controversial at_home because of Tajik leader Imomali Rakhmonov ' s dictatorial rule and growing casualties suffered by the Russian army . Fighting intensified last week , and four Russian border guards died Friday in a land-mine explosion . Seeking a way_out , Russia ' s Foreign Ministry pressed Rakhmonov early this month to postpone the elections , originally set for next Sunday , and to send his top deputy to the peace talks in Tehran , which were mediated by U.N. officials with Russian and Iranian assistance . Under the agreement reported Saturday , U.N. observers will supervise a Russian-led peacekeeping force . In similar fashion , Russia took sides last year in ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Georgia only to reappear as a peacemaker . But the conflict in Georgia ' s Abkhazia region threatened last week to flare anew . Abkhazia , an ethnically distinct Black_Sea enclave , won de_facto independence from Georgia a year ago after 13 months of war . After covertly backing the Abkhazians , Russia arranged a cease-fire and sent 2 # 500 peacekeeping troops to the Abkhazia-Georgia border in May . But last week , Russia provoked a conflict by siding with Georgia . Bypassing the Abkhazians and the U.N. refugee officials , Russia and Georgia agreed to start a wholesale repatriation of 250 # 000 ethnic Georgians who had fled Abkhazia during the war . Abkhazia , which wants to limit the refugees ' return until Georgia recognizes its independence , responded by sending 3 # 000 militiamen to the border . The Russians called_off the repatriation , but not before some of their troops had abandoned their posts to the armed Abkhazians . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin sent Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev to Abkhazia to settle the dispute over refugees and save the peace mission . Grachev met there Friday with Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba and Georgian leader Eduard A . Shevardnadze . It was Shevardnadze ' s first trip to Abkhazia since he fled a year ago on a plane full of defeated and wounded Georgian soldiers . Yeltsin and the Russian army have asserted the right to station troops across the former Soviet_Union and to intervene in conflicts . Officials in the West , wary that Russian meddling might cause more conflict than it prevents , view the peace mission in Abkhazia as a test_case . Before briefing Yeltsin on his talks , Grachev announced Saturday that the two sides had agreed on a tentative plan to repatriate refugees in exchange for the withdrawal of Georgian military equipment from the region . He gave no details . Some officials in the region believe the Russians are trying to manipulate the flow of refugees to keep Abkhazia from intervening militarily in nearby Chechnya , an oil-rich Muslim republic that is part of Russia , on behalf of its separatist leader , Gen . Dzhokar Dudayev . Prompted by Chechen terrorist attacks on passenger buses in another part of Russia , Moscow has been trying since early August to topple Dudayev by sealing_off his borders with troops and arming a recently formed Opposition Council . But the emboldened opposition has made little headway in sporadic armed clashes . On Saturday , news_agencies reported from Chechnya that Dudayev ' s forces had advanced on an opposition stronghold 12 miles from the Chechen capital but halted after a brief skirmish . One report said that two people were killed . Times special correspondent Chris Bird contributed to this report from Zugdidi , Georgia .</TEXT>
