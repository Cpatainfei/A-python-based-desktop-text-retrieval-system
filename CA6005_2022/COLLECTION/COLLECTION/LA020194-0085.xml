   <HEADLINE> DOCUMENTARY ; CHINESE DO FIGURE-EIGHTS AROUND HARDSHIPS ; WINTER IN BEIJING CAN BE A SOOTY , FRIGID MESS . BUT A LITTLE MOONLIGHT SKATING ON THE MOAT CAN WORK WONDERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are few things in life grimmer than winter in the Chinese capital . Coal dust and soot from furnaces and stoves turn every surface a dull , brooding gray . Piercing , frigid winds howl down from Siberia . Chest colds , Beijing flu and bronchitis infect everyone , so bus and subway passengers form a chorus of hacking , wheezing sufferers . Frozen spittle coats the sidewalks . Yet Beijingers , Chinese and foreigners alike , can look_forward to the end of December , when the lakes and ponds of the city and environs freeze over . This is the time , between Christmas and the Chinese Spring Festival ( Feb . 10-12 ) , for moonlight skating on the moat around the Forbidden City ; for ice dancing and hockey matches on the frozen lakes of Beihai and Purple Bamboo parks , and for weekend frolics on the wide , wind-swept , frozen waters of the old and new Qing Dynasty summer palaces 10 miles northwest of Beijing . In the booming &quot; what next ? &quot; Chinese economy , it is probably only a matter of time before a flamboyant Hong Kong investor or the profit-seeking arm of the People ' s Liberation Army opens_up a giant shopping_mall with an atrium ice-skating_rink . As it is , Beijing now has only one year-round indoor rink , at the Capital Stadium . Winter skating in Beijing is glorious not because one is_on ice , but because of where that ice is . Few other places on earth offer such dramatic settings , redolent_of history , for ice adventures . For an admission_charge of only two yuan , about 25 cents , for example , skaters at Beihai Park are entitled to two hours on the ice -- periodically swept and smoothed by broom-bearing maintenance crews -- at the foot of the White Pagoda Temple and Ming Dynasty Round City . For the equivalent of 30 cents , visitors can rent skates or the chairs on runners known as bing che . Getting outdoor exercise in Beijing is not always easy . Street traffic is predatory , so jogging is not advised . Thousands of yellow taxi vans -- called &quot; bread loaves &quot; by Beijingers -- roam the streets in high-speed pursuit of pedestrians . Also , joggers must vie with bicycles and an increasing number of motorized tricycles for space on the streets . But our family of four -- including an 8-year-old girl and 5-year-old boy with seemingly limitless energy -- quickly discovered that taking_to the ice in Beijing was a way to get our exercise , encounter China and avoid the careening yellow bread loaves . As of this writing , no traffic fatalities have been reported on the ice of Beijing parks . Still , it was a bit daunting for the middle-aged parents , whose closest previous contact with solid water not in a glass was a 1979 ice_storm in Texas , to wobble out on the ice for the first time . My wife , who believes that department_store elevators move at dangerously high speeds , found security on the ice by holding_on to the back of one of the bing che chairs and pushing it around while shouting , &quot; Watch_out ! Watch_out ! &quot; I personally discovered that ice_skating is actually aided by the middle-age -- uhmm -- &quot; settling &quot; of body mass . The center_of_gravity , lowered -- in my case to a_few inches above the ice surface -- helps maintain balance and makes falling something less than life-threatening . That part mastered , the neophyte foreign skater in Beijing is left with perhaps the most difficult challenge : ice_skating while attempting to speak Chinese . I believe that it was former University of Texas football_coach Darrell Royal , or someone like him , who defined the most basic test of physical competence as the ability to walk and chew gum at_the_same_time . The next skill level is skating and speaking a foreign language at_the_same_time . Level three is skating and attempting to speak Chinese , a language nearly impossible to speak even when standing still . Anyone with any experience here knows that Chinese people in parks are gregarious and inquisitive . Skating in Beijing is an outdoor exercise experience punctuated by interrogation . &quot; Which country people are you ? &quot; is the most common demand , usually asked by someone skating maddeningly fast -- backward . However , on a recent evening outing under the lights at Beihai Park , I was startled by a questioner who demanded : &quot; What age ? &quot; It was only later that I realized the woman who posed the question was inquiring about one of my children , skating beside me at the time . But at the time , startled and vulnerable on the ice , feeling very much my age and more , all I could do was blurt : &quot; 47 years old. &quot; Thank God I was not chewing gum at the time . In contrast to our incompetence on ice , many of the regular Chinese skaters are poetry in motion . Zhang Meisheng , a retired building inspector , ice_skates every day he can on Beihai Lake in the center of Beijing . Around him on the ice , helmeted members of the Beijing City Young People ' s Speed_Skating Assn . blur past at astonishing velocities while their coach -- a &quot; home-style &quot; restaurant owner named Zhang Peng -- barks commands . Couples tango and waltz near loudspeakers pouring_out music . Uniformed soldiers of the People ' s Liberation Army flail and helicopter their arms in a futile effort to avoid crashing . Lovers take turns pushing each other on the bing che chairs . But Zhang Meisheng , 67 , is a study in grace at his spot near the island in the middle of the lake . Slowly , elegantly , he raises one leg in an arabesque , turns , reverses direction , his head and arms extended downward , almost touching the ice . Serenely , meditatively , he completes a_few slow-motion spins . In the Chinese traditional marriage of sport and spirit , ice_skating is the source of his qi -- his spiritual power , his force . Ice_skating , he said , is the way he keeps his health and his sanity : &quot; Beijing is a place where it ' s easy to get a cold . I ' ve had maybe one cold in my life. &quot; When asked the best time to skate in Beijing , Zhang smiled toothlessly and began to recite the &quot; Nine Nine &quot; rhyme . Familiar to every schoolchild on the North China Plain , the rhyme recounts the &quot; Nine Nine Phases &quot; of winter . Winter is divided into nine nine-day phases , set by the Chinese lunar_calendar . * One nine , two nine : hands can ' t show ; Three nine , four nine : on the ice go . Five nine , six nine : river willows seen . Seven nine -- ice crack . Eight nine -- swallows back , Nine nine and one nine more , oxen in the fields encore . * Like many poetic aspects of the Chinese language , the rhyme conforms_to a seasonal rhythm , invariably tied to the cycle of planting and harvesting . The third and fourth phases of winter are considered the best time of all for skating . &quot; Most of my classmates don ' t like it when winter comes , &quot; said Nie Minhui , 23 , a pretty , rosy-cheeked English_teacher who recently graduated from the Beijing Foreign Language Normal College . &quot; They all like summer . But I prefer winter , because of the skating . &quot; Three years ago I met my boyfriend here , &quot; she said , pointing proudly to a tall , handsome young_man leaning rakishly against a nearby guard rail . Do they have plans to marry ? &quot; Not yet , &quot; said Nie coyly , punctuating her statement with a crisp pirouette . &quot; I want , she doesn ' t , &quot; interjected the boyfriend , Wu Kai , 23 . After skating in the park surrounded by Chinese culture , a popular apres-skating repair is Kentucky Fried Chicken . The American company has a franchise , complete with life-size statues of the Colonel -- one with a yellow complexion , the other pink -- on White Pagoda Island in the center of Beihai Lake .</TEXT>
