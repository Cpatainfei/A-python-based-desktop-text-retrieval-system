   <HEADLINE> ISRAELI LOSES HEALTH REFORM , QUITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Health Minister Chaim Ramon resigned Sunday after Labor_Party apparatchiks blocked his attempt to reform Israel ' s health system . &quot; I told the Cabinet that I can no longer take responsibility for the health system , &quot; Ramon said on Israel Radio . The resignation , made in writing and read out by Ramon at the weekly Cabinet session , goes_into effect Tuesday . Ramon ' s proposal aimed at guaranteeing citizens basic medical services regardless of income or employment status . &quot; I am obligated to the voter , to the public and also to myself , &quot; Ramon said . &quot; If I did not do what I did today I would find it very hard to live with myself. &quot; Ramon ' s plan easily passed the first of its three required votes_in Parliament . But the Cabinet withdrew the proposal last week after the Labor_Party , the dominant partner in the coalition government , came under pressure from Histadrut , the trade_union that represents about 60 % of Israel ' s workers . Histadrut owns the country ' s largest health_care organization , which relies_on government handouts to stay afloat . Most of Histadrut ' s officials are members of the Labor_Party . Ramon ' s plan would have cut subsidies to such organizations . The plan called_for Israelis to pay a health tax of 4.8 % of their income . Many Israelis now pay a similar amount , an average of about $ 650 annually , to various health funds that run clinics and fund hospitalization in some cases . But the funds are not required to accept all applicants , and an estimated 350 # 000 Israelis are uninsured . The demise of the health bill was seen as a personal defeat for Ramon , a leader of Labor ' s free market-oriented Young_Turks , and a setback for efforts to reform still-dominant socialist holdovers from Zionism ' s early days , such_as the Histadrut . Commentators also said his stance might help him in the struggle to take_over the party once the current generation of leaders retires .</TEXT>
