   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : JEWISH COALITION OPPOSES PROP . 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Citing the specter of totalitarianism , representatives of a Jewish coalition formed to fight Proposition 187 said Tuesday that the state ballot initiative unfairly targets children and would turn tens of thousands of adults into government informants . &quot; This is a vicious and cruel proposition , &quot; said Rabbi Harold M . Schulweiss , leader of Encino ' s Valley Beth Shalom and a member of the Jewish Community Coalition Against Proposition 187 , the ballot measure aimed at curbing illegal immigration . The community coalition is said to include congregations representing more_than 3 # 300 San Fernando Valley families , as well as regional Jewish organizations representing another 50 # 000 families throughout Southern California . Schulweiss told a news_conference that he hopes the coalition will convince the Jewish community , as well as others , that Proposition 187 would fail to address problems of illegal immigration . Instead , Schulweiss said , it would hurt many children by denying them an education and routine medical_care . Proposition 187 , if approved by voters in November , would allow public schooling , non-emergency medical_care and other government services only to those who can prove they are living_in the United States legally . In addition , it would require school officials , police and health_care workers to report to authorities anyone they believe might be an illegal immigrant . &quot; It makes informants out of all_of us , &quot; Schulweiss said . Another coalition member , Tzivia Schwartz , said : &quot; The comparison is to the experience the Jewish community had in Europe , where being suspected of being Jewish was grounds for all kinds of horrible things. &quot; The initiative is drawing upon a growing xenophobia , a fear of new immigrant families that has even spread among the normally tolerant Jewish community , said Rabbi Jim Kaufman of Temple Beth Hillel in North Hollywood . &quot; Some are saying , ' I feel I want to vote yes , and I feel it is unJewish , ' &quot; Kaufman said . Rejecting newcomers , especially those in need , is so common -- so human -- that the Bible prohibits the practice more_than two_dozen times , he said . &quot; The Bible acknowledges the feelings , but says we should not act_upon those feelings. &quot; Both men said laws directed at minorities within a community are traditionally opposed by Jews , who have been the target of similar discrimination throughout their history . While acknowledging that U . S . border authorities ought to control the flow of immigration , attacking those already living_in California , especially children of immigrants , is morally indefensible , Schulweiss said . The same arguments used by supporters of 187 -- that illegal immigration is solely a legal issue , that there is no more room or money -- was used when U . S . authorities refused port entry to the St . Louis , a ship carrying 937 Jews seeking escape_from Nazi Germany in August , 1939 , Schulweiss said . &quot; Ethics cost , &quot; he said , noting that many of the passengers later died in Nazi concentration_camps . Ron Prince , chairman of the pro-187 campaign , said he does not believe that religious figures ought to criticize supporters of 187 on moral grounds . &quot; In this country , we have separation of church and state , and we have to look_at political issues without acrimony , &quot; he said . &quot; This is a legal and , now , a political issue. &quot; SAM ENRIQUEZ</TEXT>
