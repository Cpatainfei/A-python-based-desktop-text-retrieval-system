   <TEXT> This is the gaping maw , the jaws through which convicts pass to be evaluated and processed before they are spit_out once again and force-fed into California ' s swollen prisons . Every day_of_the_week , buses from jails throughout Southern California roll into Chino to disgorge their forlorn and often dangerous passengers behind the faded beige walls of this Reception Center . And every day , buses roll_out of Chino loaded with newly processed convicts bound for prisons throughout the state . &quot; It ' s a machine that will chew you up , &quot; lifer Luis Rodriguez said from Pelican Bay_State Prison . &quot; It doesn ' t care a damn thing about you . There is no sense of rehabilitation . It ' s a multibillion-dollar industry , and we ' re the commodities. &quot; Prison_guards are scarcely less bitter . Many view their jobs as dangerous , thankless and ultimately futile . &quot; We take all_the responsibility away from them ( prisoners ) , &quot; said Correctional Officer John Baird , &quot; then kick them out and tell them , ' OK , get a job , pay your bills. ' We ' re not correcting a damned thing . The ( Department of Corrections ) should be renamed the Department of Confinement. &quot; Baird , a veteran of 22 years who now transports prisoners , and Rodriguez , a convicted killer of two highway patrolmen , have little in common -- except the knowledge that prison time is largely dead time , filled with fear , scheming , monotony , hopelessness . Inmate-on-inmate violence is down compared to a decade ago . But California prisons remain dangerous . Knifings are common . Convicts kill four or five of their fellows a year . Guards kill a like number . In the past decade , officers have shot 36 inmates to death while breaking_up fights , more_than three times the number killed by their counterparts in the other major U.S. prison systems combined . Despite an unprecedented construction program that has created 16 prisons , 126 # 000 inmates are crammed into space for only half that many . Under &quot; three strikes &quot; sentencing laws , the real crunch is yet to come . As the prison population balloons , this already strained system will be tested . Officials will grapple with tens of thousands of physically and mentally infirm inmates , contentious labor-management relations and felons who are likely to become more rebellious as their sentences grow longer , and privileges are revoked . For example , inmates at one overcrowded prison went_on strike in July after the warden decreed that they had to give_up their 13-inch televisions for ones with 9-inch screens . &quot; At the point where any individual has nothing to lose , they act_out , &quot; said David Tristan , deputy director of corrections in_charge of institutions . &quot; that ' s human nature. &quot; The Chino Reception Center -- one of six such facilities throughout the state -- processed 32 # 500 inmates last year and still the buses come . On a recent day at Chino , newly imprisoned men in orange jumpsuits stood_in a sullen line before an intake sergeant . The officer recognized many of these men . They had served time before . The men , who had just showered , stood_in puddles . Nearby , a yellow plastic bin was piled high with clothing that the men had discarded . They would not be needing it anytime soon . Prison officials assign them a place to sleep , but virtually every space is filled : cells , day rooms , gyms . In the cells , one inmate sleeps_in a bunk_bed , the other on a mattress on the floor . In the summer , the heat is suffocating . In the gym , where more_than 200 inmates sleep_in rows , head-to-head , there ' s a swamp cooler . The inmates can spend their days_watching TV , shooting the bull or playing cards . There is little else to do until they are assigned to a prison . Officials make assignments based on criteria such_as the type of crime committed , the length of sentence and family ties . Options range from Level I minimum security forestry camps to Level IV prisons such_as Pelican Bay near the Oregon border for the hardest cases . Between these extremes is the medium security Correctional Training Facility at Soledad . Soledad : Bloody Past , Grim Present The entrance is deceptively pleasant . The lawn is flanked by yellow and purple pansies and red roses . But beyond the grass and flowers is a double fence topped by coiled razor wire and studded with gun towers . Built_in 1946 , Soledad once was one of the most notorious penitentiaries in the state . Its three-tiered cellblocks were home to the Soledad Brothers , convicts accused of beating a guard to death in 1969 after three inmates were fatally shot from a gun tower . Corrections officials have not torn_down old , hard-to-operate joints like this Monterey County prison because of the burgeoning convict population . Instead , they have renovated them and filled them with lower-security inmates . The administration is proud_of its vocational_programs teaching such skills as furniture making , print_shop and upholstery . But there are not enough training slots or jobs , and 40 % of the inmates at the prison are idle . Some are_on waiting lists . Others choose to do nothing . Soledad is not exceptional . Slightly over half the inmates in California ' s prisons are assigned to jobs or educational_programs . And as &quot; three strikes &quot; takes_effect , idleness is expected to increase . Currently , there are only 71 # 500 assignments available for 126 # 000 inmates . More_than 40 # 000 inmates are deemed either too sick or unruly to be given such assignments , or have no interest in them . This despite the fact that inmates can earn time_off their sentences by working or studying . &quot; Our time_clock goes from meal to meal , &quot; said Vincent Cervantes , a burglar and robber from the Los Angeles area who is back in prison for a parole violation . &quot; that ' s when we know our day is over , when we finish our last meal. &quot; What kind of judgments do Cervantes and his fellow prisoners make about the laws that are passed to keep them in longer ? Or to keep them from coming_back ? Cervantes , who has spent nine of his 34 years in prison , says he was sentenced in 1985 to five years for robbery with a knife . Strike one . Soon after he got_out , Cervantes was locked_up again for first- and second-degree burglaries . The first-degree burglary -- breaking_into an inhabited dwelling -- would have been strike two , but Cervantes says that conviction was set_aside on appeal . Second-degree burglary doesn ' t qualify as strike two , but Cervantes doesn ' t know that . He thinks he will be sent_away for 25 years to life if he is convicted of another felony . And that , he says , makes him even more dangerous . &quot; Let ' s say , &quot; he explains , &quot; that I get_out there and my kids get_into a fight . Let ' s say I blow it and retaliate and hit someone . I would n ' t let them take me in . . . . If lives are at stake , it ' s going_to be someone else ' s life , not mine. &quot; Problems in Lancaster Nearly 300 miles and light-years away in penal technology is the gleaming new state_prison at Lancaster . It is the only prison that California corrections officials have managed to open in Los Angeles County , even though nearly 40 % of the state ' s inmates come from the county . Located in the high desert at the edge of dry brown mountains , the prison ' s off-white cellblocks with turquoise doors shimmer eerily in the heat . The Lancaster prison , which opened in early 1993 , has not operated smoothly despite its electronically operated cell doors , its glassed-in control booths and its modular , semicircular cellblocks . There have been two wardens and two interim wardens at the prison in its first 18 months of operation . Two lifers escaped but were quickly captured . At least four inmates were wounded by guards ' gunfire during brawls or altercations last winter . One inmate , who has filed a claim for damages , was shot in the foot last February after allegedly taking an &quot; aggressive stance &quot; in the cellblock . About one-third of the inmates at Lancaster are idle . But one inmate who has tried to use prison to improve himself is Hector M . Aldaz , a 26-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico_City , one of at least 15 # 000 undocumented immigrants serving time for committing crimes . Aldaz is serving 11 years for attempted murder in a shooting on a San Bernardino County freeway . Aldaz learned to speak English in the prison ' s school program , and a_few months ago , passed a high_school equivalency test . He hopes to get_out of prison in 1998 . &quot; If they don ' t deport me , &quot; he said , &quot; I will try to get a college degree so I can progress. &quot; Outside the classrooms , under the hot sun that bakes A Yard , 300 inmates stroll , play cards or lift weights . They segregate themselves according to race . Standing_in the iron pit with a group of white and Latino inmates was William S . Munson , in the last_days of his sixth state_prison term , a three-year sentence . Munson is a 41-year-old drug_addict from the Los Angeles area , the kind of habitual_criminal that legislators probably had_in_mind when they drafted &quot; three strikes. &quot; He has served sentences for burglary and a number of armed_robberies . Munson ' s mother was imprisoned for selling heroin when he was 2 years old , and he went from foster_homes to juvenile hall to county jails , and finally to prison . &quot; I ' m a product of the state of California , &quot; he said lightly . &quot; I ' m literally a state baby. &quot; If Munson is convicted of another felony , he faces 25 years to life under &quot; three strikes. &quot; &quot; I ' m going_to a state , &quot; he said , &quot; that isn ' t set_on locking_up half their population and giving the other half the job of looking over them. &quot; For all its problems , the prison at Lancaster is at least relatively close to a metropolitan area , an advantage for staff as well as the families of prisoners . Corrections officials recognize the value of visitation in maintaining the family and community ties of inmates , but point_out that prisons are seldom welcome in metropolitan areas , which are home to most convicts . &quot; We tried diligently to place a prison in metropolitan Los Angeles , &quot; said corrections spokeswoman Christine May , &quot; and the community fought us in the court system . We would love to have more prisons in metropolitan areas . They seem to be more difficult to site there. &quot; Newness No Relief at Calipatria Most new prisons are in places like Calipatria , where one opened in 1992 amid cotton fields of the Imperial Valley . If there were no traffic , the drive from Los Angeles would take_five hours . The nearest town of any size is El Centro . Temperatures commonly hit a humid 110 , and there are swarms of insects . &quot; When it ' s hot , your level of patience is limited , &quot; said Officer John Childers , who recently transferred to another prison . &quot; Your temper is limited . You get grouchy . You get angry . You get fatigued . You ' re just miserable . And the whiteflies . My God. &quot; Add to that an unruly group of 3 # 800 convicts . Gangs are engaged in war . Fights are vicious . In July , one inmate kicked another in the head so hard that the victim went_into convulsions . A sergeant tried to break it up , but his gun misfired . A second officer tried to fire , but forgot to pull the bolt back , according to a prison report . &quot; The officers are inexperienced . The supervisors are inexperienced , &quot; said Dave Moschetti , local president of the California Correctional Peace_Officers Assn . &quot; The inmates are violent , and they ' ve been around a while . No one wants to come here ( to work ) . &quot; The union at Calipatria is enmeshed with prison administrators in bitter disputes over disciplinary actions , pay and job safety . Incident reports offer a guard ' s-eye tour of a hellish side of prison life . Between April and July , Calipatria officers found 17 weapons : darts made of sewing needles and pen barrels , deodorant containers melted into knife_blades , sharpened pieces of plexiglass . They found nine stashes of drugs , including a shipment that came_in a package with a lawyer ' s return_address , 10 balloons of heroin concealed in a bar of soap , and hand-made hypodermic_needles . Officers fired eight warning shots to break_up fights . Still , 13 inmates were stabbed or slashed . In one attack , two prisoners rushed to a neighboring cell , and stabbed their targets 20 times . In a two-week period this summer , two officers were stabbed . Officers endure bites , kicks , punches , and being doused by a brew of toilet waste that is tossed through cell door openings . Officers call it &quot; gassing. &quot; Moschetti said dozens of Calipatria officers want transfers . Many have already moved across Imperial County to the newly opened Centinela State_Prison . There , Warden Rosie Garcia said three-fourths of her officers are fresh from the academy . Most front-line supervisors have three or four years on_the_job . As for the future , Garcia sighed , &quot; It ' s going_to get a lot harder. &quot; Prison ' s Feminine Side : Chowchilla If it weren ' t for the coiled razor wire , the nation ' s largest women ' s state_prison might be mistaken for a college campus . Inmates , in street_clothes or prison-issue blue , lounge on the lush green grass of the big yard . Others walk toward dormitories trimmed with cheerful magenta awnings . &quot; We ' re in touch with our feminine side here , &quot; said prison spokesman Toby Wong . &quot; The only thing we don ' t have is curtains. &quot; The Central California Women ' s Prison at Chowchilla in Madera County is a world apart from the violent state_prisons for men , but -- beneath the pastels -- it is plagued by severe overcrowding , isolation from inmates ' families and allegedly substandard medical_care . &quot; Three strikes &quot; sentencing legislation is not expected to have as great an impact on women ' s prisons as on those for men because females are not as likely to commit the most serious felonies . Even so , corrections officials estimate that with &quot; three strikes &quot; and other get-tough legislation , the statewide total of women prisoners will grow from 7 # 900 to more_than 13 # 000 over the next five years . Irene Padilla is determined not to be among them . The 30-year-old woman from East Los Angeles said she was at the end of her second prison_term for robbery and spoke_of her fears of &quot; three strikes. &quot; &quot; The next time , if I ever do_it , &quot; she said , &quot; I ' ll never , never , never be able to set foot in society again. &quot; The short , tough-looking inmate with &quot; Jackie &quot; tattooed on her neck had just spent three years without seeing her two children who live_in Los Angeles , 240 miles away . The prison is too remote , she said , for her family to visit . &quot; I ' m not ever coming_back , &quot; she vowed . The prison is already operating at twice its design capacity of 2 # 000 . Each room , designed to hold four women , is jammed with eight inmates who share one toilet , one shower and two sinks . The prison gymnasium has been converted into a dormitory for 112 inmates . But the prisoners ' most common complaint appears to be health_care . Prison officials acknowledge that an inmate might wait as long as three months to see one of five physicians who serve the 4 # 000 convicts . A coalition of inmates ' rights attorneys allege that medical_care here is dangerously substandard . And last year the Department of Corrections paid $ 360 # 000 to settle a suit over the death of inmate Diana Reyes , 42 , who died of acute pancreatitis in 1991 , four hours after medical staff found her lying on a mattress on the floor of her isolation cell , caked with feces . Teena Farmon , warden at Chowchilla , denied that Reyes died because of neglect . &quot; We supply a higher level of medical_care , &quot; she said , &quot; than most of these people got before they were incarcerated. &quot; The End of the Line at Pelican Bay The last stop in California ' s penal system -- Pelican Bay -- sounds like a tourist destination , surrounded by redwoods near the picturesque fishing and lumber town of Crescent City in Del Norte County . But no prison has harder inmates -- or officers . Here are some snapshots from prison and court records : * Jay Jackson attacked his cellmate , and when guards arrived to remove the bloodied victim , he demanded to know : &quot; Is he dead yet ? Well , I tried to do him . Are you sure he isn ' t dead yet ? &quot; Motive : Jackson was upset that he had been served pancakes . He hates pancakes . He got seven more years in prison . * David Hunter , a hulking man with tangled and matted hair , was doing time for petty theft when he became angry with a guard who shut his thumb in his cell ' s food slot . He splattered the officer with &quot; unidentified liquid. &quot; Convicted of assault in the incident , Hunter told his sentencing judge that , by way of mitigation , the concoction contained no blood . He got six years . * In a brutality suit , a correctional sergeant sparred with a prisoners ' rights lawyer , saying : &quot; Contrary to what you may believe , an inmate losing four teeth is not a major injury. &quot; Behind Pelican Bay ' s walls , exercise yards are immaculate . Not a cigarette_butt or a scrap of paper sullies them . The grass is green . There are softball diamonds , weight piles , a sweat lodge for Native_American inmates , meandering walkways , and steel-mesh cages the size of shower_stalls for inmates who get_out of line . From vantage_points above the yard , officers with rifles look down . When fights break_out , as they often do , guards use a public_address_system to order combatants to stop . If that fails , they fire warning shots . And if that doesn ' t work , they shoot at the inmates . Four prisoners have been fatally shot since the prison opened five years ago . The most difficult inmates are locked_up in the Security Housing Unit . Prisoners live one to a cell , separated by three locked doors from a control booth officer armed with an M-14 . Locked_in the unit are leaders of the Mexican Mafia , the Aryan Brotherhood , the Black Guerrilla Family and lesser-known gangs , as well as the most unruly inmates , and a smattering of others like Luis Rodriguez , who was convicted of killing two highway patrolmen . &quot; The SHU is no place nice , &quot; said Rodriguez , 39 , who has since moved from the unit to the general population . Inmates in cells next to his ranted into the night , making_it impossible to sleep . &quot; You aren ' t seeing any sunlight , no trees , no people , nothing other_than TV. &quot; Once a day , the control booth officer pushed a button and the cell door opened , allowing Rodriguez to spend an hour and a half in an exercise space measuring 28 by 12 feet , with 20-foot walls . He would run in circles , counting up_to 635 laps . Prisoners ' rights lawyers have sued , hoping to convince a federal judge that imprisonment in security housing should not go_on indefinitely as it does now . A ruling is expected next year . Tristan , the director of corrections , defends the policy of keeping gang leaders isolated in the Security Housing Unit for their entire terms , saying : &quot; We know there are individuals so violent and so predatory that as soon as they got_to mainline population , they would begin preying on other inmates. &quot; However , prisoners and psychologists testified last year that after months and years in solitary , some inmates begin hallucinating . A few become so disturbed that they smear feces on themselves -- like Vaughn Dortch . For 10 days in 1992 , Dortch lay_in his own waste , until other prisoners began complaining , and officers extracted him . As he struggled to bite them and ranted that he was a killer_bee , they took Dortch to an infirmary and forced him into a bath . A medical technician , Irven McMillan , was near the end of the shift when a sergeant asked him to help . McMillan had never given a bath before , and asked a supervisor to help . She refused . So McMillan went_about washing Dortch . The waste was embedded in his skin , McMillan recalled . When the bath was over , Dortch stood_up and his skin peeled_off in sheets . Dortch sued and won a settlement of $ 972 # 000 last year . McMillan was fired , but is suing to reclaim his job , and the guards union is supporting the action . McMillan is convinced the temperature of the bath_water had nothing to do with Dortch ' s injuries . He said he believes the inmate ' s skin came_off because he had a rash from lying_in his wastes or from disinfectant used to clean his cell . Warden Charles Marshall blames such problems on inexperienced staff and the difficulties of opening a new prison . He has tried to tighten procedures . But as more prisons open , he predicts , wardens will face similar problems : &quot; As long as ( inmates ) keep coming , and they ' re coming at a rate faster than we can build , we ' re going to be in that situation , and probably we ' ll be looked_at critically by the courts. &quot; A Day In the Life Here is a typical daily schedule for prisoners : 5:00 a.m. : Inmates counted 6:00 : General population wakes_up . Inmates with jobs in the kitchen have been up since 4 a.m. 6:15--Breakfast 6:45--Prisoners on medication line_up for pills 7-7:30--Inmate maintenance workers , students report to work or classes . 8:00--Medical call 9:15--Cells unlocked , prisoners with no program go_to exercise yard , day rooms or counseling . 11:00--Yard ends .
