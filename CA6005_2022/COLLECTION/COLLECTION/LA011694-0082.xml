   <HEADLINE> CRUISE VIEWS : COSTA ROMANTIC BOASTS A SLEEK ITALIAN STYLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After an intensive three-year introduction of two brand-new and fully reconstructed vessels on existing hulls , Costa finally seems to have gotten the knack of things with its newest , the 1 # 350-passenger CostaRomantica , which made its debut in the Caribbean in late November . Three of the line ' s four new ships -- the CostaClassica , CostaRomantica and CostaAllegra -- are sailing the Caribbean on seven-night cruises this winter . The Romantica is sister_ship to the CostaClassica . The Classica came_out in 1992 to a &quot; thumbs down &quot; reaction from many early passengers , hampered by a massive advertising_campaign touting a new &quot; EuroLuxe &quot; style instead of Costa ' s longtime &quot; Cruising Italian Style &quot; theme , corny but successful in North_America for its flirtatious Italian waiters , toga parties , strolling musicians and lots of pizza and pasta . So repeat passengers boarded the Classica and searched in vain for familiar Italian waiters , many of whom had been replaced by stewards of various nationalities in a cost-cutting move . ( On the Romantica , only 120 crew_members out of 650 are Italians , &quot; but they are all Italians at heart , &quot; says Costa Cruises president Dino Schibuola. ) Meanwhile , first-time passengers who read &quot; EuroLuxe &quot; to mean cushy and enveloping luxury in the style of Royal Viking or Crystal Harmony , expressed dismay at the ship ' s austere design and acres of bare marble floors in the dining_room and public areas . But the Romantica , while nearly identical to its sister_ship , comes_across as chic and understated rather than pretentious , as the Classica seemed with its white plaster statues surrounded by potted palms . &quot; Italian Style by Design &quot; is the line ' s newest slogan , emphasizing the architecture and decor of the ships . While the dining-room floor on the Romantic is still bare marble , the clatter has been cut_down somewhat by a new ceiling design , and the staff seems to drop fewer dishes than before . The ship ' s chief steward praised the sanitary quality of marble as compared to carpeting . Oversized portholes , which are used instead of windows in the cabins and on-board shops , add a stylish note , while several large but light kinetic sculptures bring_in the requisite touch of modern art . For spa and beauty fans , the Caracalla Spa is lavishly designed , with massage and treatment rooms with windows open_to the sea , steam_baths , two saunas and full beauty services . The pool deck is beautiful , with pale blue-and-white-striped cushions on the lounge_chairs , natural teak decking , sidewalk-cafe chairs of cream wicker and chrome under umbrellas , and &quot; cocoon &quot; cabana chairs of wicker lined with striped cushions -- great for reading or quiet tete-a-tetes . There ' s also a jogging track on the top deck . The Diva Disco doubles as a daytime observation lounge high atop the ship , and there ' s a second pool on the stern with terraced galleries of sunbathing spots and four Jacuzzis . Separate smoking and nonsmoking reading_rooms / libraries and card / game_rooms are also on board , along with spacious meeting rooms for groups . The Renaissance-style show lounge offers good sight lines from most areas ( except behind support posts ) and is completely nonsmoking , a boon , we would think , to both audience and performers . Smoking and nonsmoking areas throughout the ship are_well marked . The production shows , which originate_in Britain , are handsomely presented with lavish costumes and accomplished dancers but seem very dated compared to some of the shows Carnival and Royal Caribbean are presenting now . * On the inaugural sailing , the staff still seemed to be adjusting from Europe to America . At the buffet on boarding day , iced_tea was an unknown commodity , which perplexed passengers on a sweltering Florida afternoon . As on the Classica , the executive chef is Austrian rather than Italian , and the pizza -- back by popular demand -- is more Pillsbury than Pisa . Other dishes are more successful , especially some of the vegetarian dishes and the breads . The service_staff is nicely uniformed and eager to please , although English-as-a-second-language classes could be recommended for many of them . Room service orders in particular tended to get confused on the inaugural sailing . We ordered a big breakfast one morning by circling items on the printed card -- poached eggs and corned_beef hash , a herb omelet with sausage , two tomato_juices and two teas -- for 8 a.m. We ended_up at 8:30 with two teas and place_settings for two , but only one tiny omelet and a single glass of juice , which we divided daintily when nothing more materialized . But these are all matters that can be corrected . The important things about the Romantica are its handsome cabins and beautiful public rooms , and its clean , stylish look that is a wonderful antidote to today ' s glitzy mega-liners . Cabins have elegant burled briarwood Italian furniture and plenty of hanging and storage_spaces , plus personal safes . White marble counters and built-in hair_dryers are in all bathrooms , but in the suites , space is grander with two basins in the marble counter and separate Jacuzzi tub and stall shower . The art and graphics throughout the cabins utilize fabric wall_hangings with Italian scenes or abstract designs . Cabin TVs play feature_films throughout the day and evening on a published schedule . * Several inside cabins are designed for wheelchair access , with extra-wide doors , bathrooms with pull-down shower seats and generous turning space . Along with 10 veranda suites as on the Classica , the Romantica has added a deck of 24 suites with floor-to-ceiling glass windows . The suites are especially comfortable and appealing and have trundle_beds for passengers traveling with_children . The suites with veranda are 580 square_feet , while standard outside cabins are 200 square_feet and inside standards 175 square_feet . Brochure prices for the CostaRomantica seven-day cruises range from $ 795 per person , double occupancy , for an inside cabin with upper and lower berths , to a top of $ 2 # 995 per person , double occupancy , for a suite . Fares vary by season , and do offer a discount for early bookings . The Romantica alternates eastern and western Caribbean itineraries from Miami , calling_in San Juan , St . Thomas , Casa de Campo ( Dominican_Republic ) and Nassau on the eastern leg ; Ocho Rios , Playa del Carmen , Cozumel and Grand Cayman on the western itinerary . The Classica sails from San Juan on a southern Caribbean itinerary , calling_at St . Maarten , Martinique , Barbados , St . Thomas and Casa de Campo . The Allegra alternates eastern and western Caribbean itineraries from Miami , San Juan , St . Thomas , Casa de Campo and Nassau on the eastern leg , and Ocho Rios , Playa del Carmen , Cozumel and Grand Cayman on the western route .</TEXT>
