   <HEADLINE> SONY TO INSTALL DIGITAL SOUND IN AMC THEATERS ; MOVIES : $ 25-MILLION DEAL COULD ESTABLISH THE FIRM AS THE LEADER IN ITS BATTLE AGAINST DTS AND DOLBY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sony Corp . scored a victory in the digital movie soundtrack wars Wednesday by signing an estimated $ 25-million deal to install its Sony Dynamic Digital Sound_system in AMC Entertainment theaters . The agreement calls_for AMC to purchase 1 # 700 SDDS digital film playback units for exclusive use in its theaters . The Kansas City , Mo.-based chain has 1 # 618 screens , with roughly 400 more planned or under construction . Sony executives described the agreement as the largest commitment ever by a theatrical exhibitor to a digital cinema sound_system . The pact also has the potential to establish Sony as the leader in a battle against two key rivals : Digital Theater Systems of Westlake Village and Dolby Laboratories of San Francisco . Each is pushing to become the industry standard for digital movie sound . Most analysts are convinced that only one standard will prevail . Digital movie sound quality is similar to that of compact_discs . It offers crystal-clear tones free_of the snaps and pops sometimes found on traditional movie soundtracks . In addition to installing SDDS at AMC theaters , Sony will introduce the system in at least 150 of its 900 Sony ( formerly Loews Theatres ) by the end of the year , according to SDDS President Jim Fiedler . So far , exhibitors have been reluctant to commit to one digital movie sound format over another , although a_few have been investing in multiple formats because of the rising popularity of digital sound with audiences . Stanley H . Durwood , AMC ' s chairman and chief_executive , said his company felt the time was right for a commitment . &quot; There ' s only room for one system , and this is it , &quot; Durwood said . &quot; This is a signal to all . They better get_on the bandwagon. &quot; Sony has been talking to all_the motion_picture studios about SDDS , and it expects to see its format on non-Sony Pictures Entertainment movies soon . Despite delays in getting the system to market , Sony of America President Michael P . Schulhof said he is confident of its prospects . &quot; Studios follow the marketplace , &quot; said Schulhof , a onetime physicist who helped introduce digital audio technology in the United States in the 1970s . AMC ' s Durwood said the chain will install 350 SDDS units before Christmas in key theaters around the country , including the AMC Century City multiplex , where &quot; The Next Karate Kid &quot; will open Aug . 5 as the first film in major release featuring SDDS . Durwood said AMC decided to go_with Sony ' s system because of superior quality , despite its higher cost . &quot; It ' s pricey , &quot; he said , &quot; but the quality , consistency and dependability are with SDDS. &quot; At $ 13 # 800 a theater , SDDS is more expensive than DTS and Dolby . Bill Mead , Dolby ' s vice_president of film marketing , downplayed the significance of the announcement . &quot; It ' s business as usual . We ' re going to proceed along , &quot; he said . Dolby ' s hardware has been installed in 700 to 800 theaters worldwide . Mead said exhibitors should realize it ' s in their best interest to do business with a company not under the influence of a major studio .</TEXT>
