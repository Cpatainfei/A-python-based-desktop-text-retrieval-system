   <HEADLINE> FOSSIL REVEALS ANCIENT WHALE WAS ABLE TO MOVE_ON LAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Researchers have found the fossil remains of an ancient relative of the whale that was able to propel itself on land . &quot; This critter is a missing link between land animals and modern whales , &quot; said J.G.M. Thewissen , a paleobiologist at Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine in Rootstown , Ohio . &quot; It is a very complete specimen and has enough of the anatomy to teach us something about how the animal moved_on land. &quot; A report on the discovery is to be published today in the journal Science . Thewissen said the fossil was found in deposits left by an ancient sea that once existed in Pakistan . Fossils found nearby suggest that the whale died about 50 million years ago . &quot; It was about the size of a big male sea_lion and probably weighed 600 to 700 pounds , &quot; Thewissen said . Many fossils of the land-dwelling ancestors of the modern whale have been found , but Thewissen said this is the first with enough fossils of the legs , vertebrae and tail to show how the animal was able to move_on land and in the water . The animal , which Thewissen calls Ambulocetus natans , had large rear feet with fully developed legs . In front , the feet are short , stubby and joined almost to the shoulder . As a result , the whale moved by bumping along on its chest and abdomen , lifting itself just enough to lurch forward . Ambulocetus natans had the teeth of a carnivore , but because it was so awkward on land it probably was unable to catch prey out of the water . For this reason , Thewissen speculates that the whale ancestor lived_on marine life , as do modern whales . Modern whales are thought to have developed from animals that lived_on land and slowly , over thousands of generations , evolved to the oceangoing mammal known today . &quot; The oldest skeleton that is a marine whale is about 40 million years old , &quot; Thewissen said . That skeleton is 40 to 50 feet long and had tiny hind feet inadequate for moving_on land . Ambulocetus natans lived about 10 million years before that , but Thewissen said there are a number of missing links in the evolutionary chain to the modern whale .</TEXT>
