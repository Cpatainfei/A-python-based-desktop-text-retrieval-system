   <HEADLINE> MOVIES ; THEY PUT THEIR BEST FACE FORWARD ; SO YOU THOUGHT THE DINOSAURS OF ' JURRASIC PARK ' WERE PRETTY AMAZING ? THE FACES BEHIND ' THE MASK ' SAY THEY REALLY HAD TO STRETCH THEMSELVES TO CREATE THE HIGH-TECH ANIMATION FOR JIM CARREY ' S NEW COMEDY . HERE ' S HOW THEY DID IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jim Carrey , the loose-limbed , rubber-faced star of &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective , &quot; is , quite decidedly , a physical comic . But even Carrey might have trouble pulling_off gags that call_for his skin to turn green , his eyes to rocket out of their sockets and his tongue to unscroll atop a nightclub table . Of course , with a little help from the physics-defying computer animation department at Industrial Light &amp; Magic , Carrey can , and will , do anything for a laugh . In &quot; The Mask , &quot; which opens Friday , Carrey ' s contortive brand of slapstick and ILM ' s high-tech computer effects have been combined to create an explosive blend of comedy and fantasy . Made_for less than $ 20 million , the New Line production ranks as a modest film against pricier competition at the summer box_office . But in_using cutting-edge computer animation to make the very human Carrey as squashable and stretchable as any &quot; Looney Tunes &quot; favorite , &quot; The Mask &quot; aims to offer some of the summer ' s most striking movie moments . &quot; Jim Carrey is an elastic man to begin with , &quot; says director Chuck Russell . &quot; And now , I think he ' s proud to have achieved a personal career goal by becoming a living cartoon. &quot; The comic stars as Stanley Ipkiss , a helpless , hapless bank teller whose days are a disheartening series of humiliations . When Ipkiss gains possession of the ancient cursed mask of the title , he discovers that by donning it , he is transformed into a green-headed , zoot-suited , wisecracking phantom . The film also features newcomer Cameron Diaz as Stanley ' s love interest , comic Richard Jeni as his best buddy , Peter Greene as an ultra-creepy villain and Peter Riegert as a continually befuddled police_detective . To achieve the mind-bending sequences , effects supervisors from ILM were_on the set throughout the shoot to advise Russell and monitor Carrey ' s action . When live-action shots were completed , they were sent to the ILM headquarters in San Rafael , north of San Francisco . There , the same computers that were used to create the true-to-life dinosaurs of &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; were used to re-create the kinds of cartoon gags made famous in the ' 30s and ' 40s by pioneering &quot; Looney Tunes &quot; directors Tex Avery and Bob Clampett . * Taking a quick break from his increasingly busy work schedule , Carrey still hadn ' t seen the finished cut of the film , but he says he can ' t wait to see how ILM has enhanced his antics . &quot; This was a really fun character for me . I ' ve been describing him as ' Fred Astaire on acid. ' It ' s going_to be really odd and really interesting to see what I ' m doing_in the finished film . But , frankly , &quot; he says with a laugh , &quot; I don ' t think I ' ll see myself doing anything I haven ' t imagined myself doing before. &quot; If that ' s the case , then Carrey has a formidable imagination . When Stanley turns_into the Mask , he can spin himself into a tornado , pull a barrack ' s worth of armaments out of his pocket or sprout a wolf ' s head in_order to whistle at the object of his desire . And though the Mask character tends to make things difficult for evildoers , he ' s no white-knight crime-fighter . To avoid being captured , he can use his compelling singing_voice to turn a battalion of cops into a frenzied conga_line . The computer crew at ILM couldn ' t have been happier with the work . While the T . rex and velociraptors of &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; were groundbreaking , technical tours_de_force , the actual animation work was often grueling . The freewheeling spirit of &quot; The Mask &quot; offered the high-tech cartoon-lovers at ILM a chance to get_back to their animation roots . &quot; This was loose , &quot; says visual effects producer Clint Goldman . &quot; We could go crazy . The craziest we could get_in ' Jurassic ' was when we had the T . rex chomping on the lawyer . That was fun . But ' crazy ' on ' The Mask ' meant multiplying Jim Carrey ' s head by three and giving him four-foot bulging eyeballs . That was a lot more fun. &quot; &quot; After ' Jurassic , ' I was almost ready to pack it in , &quot; says director of animation Steve Williams , a six-year veteran of the ILM computer_graphics department . &quot; But ' The Mask ' was completely refreshing . &quot; What we could do with the dinosaurs was limited by the laws of the natural world , but ' The Mask ' was textbook cartooning . We got really excited watching the dailies . It was a lot more fun spending a year watching Jim than it was spending two years seeing how accurately we could make the butt of a giant reptile jiggle. &quot; Carrey was equally excited about working with ILM and says he felt he was among kindred spirits the first time he met Goldman , Williams and their staff : &quot; I ' ve always loved Tex Avery stuff . I went_up to ILM before we started shooting to see what they had_in_mind , and I found these guys sitting around , watching cartoons like a bunch of children -- just giggling and pointing . It was amazing . I said , ' God , thank_you for putting me where I belong. ' &quot; &quot; The Mask &quot; is loosely based on a comic_book of the same title developed by Dark_Horse comics in the early ' 80s . The title character was originally conceived as a slightly less malevolent takeoff on Batman ' s perennial nemesis the Joker , and the stories in the comic_books were often quite dark . New Line bought the film rights to the comic_book and , after a_couple_of years of unsuccessful development , approached Russell about signing_on to the project . The director was grabbed by the basic theme of the tale but wanted to make a film with a much lighter tone . &quot; I loved the idea of this mysterious mask that completely transforms whoever puts it on , &quot; he says . &quot; But I wanted to set the story in a more colorful world . I wanted to create the tone of the old musical_comedies , because I saw the Mask as a very musical character . He ' s a little hallucinogenic , and a little 3-D , but there ' s a musical-comedy energy to everything that he does. &quot; As director of &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street III &quot; and the remake of &quot; The Blob , &quot; Russell had experience evoking chills from his audiences , but comedy has never been far from his mind -- this is the man who had Freddy Krueger erupt out of Dick Cavett and attack Zsa Zsa Gabor . He also produced the 1986 Rodney Dangerfield vehicle &quot; Back to School &quot; early in his career , and it was in planning that film that he discovered the charms of a young comic named Jim Carrey . &quot; I ' d seen his stand-up work and thought he was phenomenal , &quot; Russell says . &quot; I kept wondering why nobody had used him in movies yet . I wanted to use a comedian for a part in ' Back to School , ' but it was the part of a college professor and Jim was too young to play that . We ended_up using Sam Kinison . When I started scripting ' The Mask , ' I had Jim in mind even before I knew whether I could get him or not . When he read the first draft I worked_on , he said , ' It looks_like it ' s written for me. ' I said , ' You ' re absolutely correct. ' We were in sync from then on. &quot; Carrey ' s only worry about the project was that the heavy effects might crimp his comedy . In all_of his scenes as the Mask , he needed to wear a prosthetic head designed by makeup effects artist Greg Cannom . And because most of his shtick would have a computer-generated payoff , any comic improvisations on the set would have to be tailored to ILM ' s capabilities . But he discovered that Russell and ILM were equally prepared to let him run wild . &quot; My main concern was about having a little freedom , &quot; Carrey explains , &quot; especially since I was coming from ' Ace Ventura , ' where I got_to cut loose . that ' s the best method for me -- I like to spew and go_out on wild tangents and let the director guide me as_to the appropriateness of something . Chuck had my scenes pretty well worked_out , but after the first week of shooting , things changed completely . New Line was getting dailies that weren ' t on any page of the script . They put a little pressure on Chuck at first , but then they started liking the new stuff even better than the stuff that had been planned. &quot; &quot; When the makeup and the costume came_on , he really did become the Mask , &quot; Russell recalls with a laugh . &quot; I think he even surprised himself sometimes with what he came_up with . . . . I never had to pump Jim Carrey up , although I will admit to feeding him a_few extra cappuccinos at the right time of night. &quot; The director was happy to discover that his computer animators could ad-lib just as well as his star &quot; One day we decided that in a nightclub scene , the Mask should offer his love interest a cigarette and blow her a heart-shaped smoke ring -- sort of a Pepe le Pew maneuver , &quot; Russell says . &quot; We came_up with that on the set , Jim did his part , and then ILM went_ahead and ran with it . Both of their talents came_together to create this nice , off-the-cuff comic moment. &quot; As images and action sequences were created by the animators and sent to the director for approval , a unique language was created . &quot; ILM and I now know the difference between a zip and a zing , Russell says . &quot; It got that specific . And we were often getting_into these very serious discussions about which scenes in the movie needed extra ' face wobble. ' &quot; Throughout the shoot , the biggest problem that Russell and ILM encountered was not in matching the animation to Carrey ' s movements but in making_sure that the animation hit the right lighthearted , comic tone . They discovered that when some cartoon gags were applied to a human in photo-real fashion , the effect could be horrific rather than comedic . That was particularly true of the transformation scenes . &quot; In the shots where the mask is going_on Jim ' s head or coming_off it , there ' s a lot of interaction between this thing that ' s totally synthetic and computer-generated and his real skin , &quot; says visual effects producer Goldman . &quot; For that to look natural , and have a sense of fun to it and be scary but not too scary -- that was some pretty tricky work for us. &quot; &quot; There was always the danger of being grotesque , &quot; Russell says . &quot; When you do what we called the ' Awooga face , ' and the jaw drops and the eyes pop and the tongue rolls_out , it could be a scene in a monster movie . I wanted this film to have a dangerous edge , but I would n ' t let it get grotesque. &quot; Williams , the director of animation , was a little more willing to let things look ugly : &quot; I think Chuck and I had a little bit of the old Lennon and McCartney tension , &quot; he says with a chuckle . &quot; I wanted eyeballs to bulge grotesquely , and he usually wanted a less shocking image . He always had to pull the animators back a little bit in terms of how graphic the image was . But once we had the right tone , he encouraged us to go completely nuts. &quot; Williams said he hopes the future may bring another chance to get gross . &quot; Maybe if there ' s a sequel , I ' ll get_to put more veins in the eyeballs. &quot; New Line founder and Chief_Executive_Officer Robert Shaye said he looks_forward to seeing Carrey don the mask in further adventures . Carrey , who was paid $ 450 # 000 for &quot; The Mask , &quot; was signed after the wild success of last spring ' s &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective &quot; for a &quot; Mask 2 , &quot; reportedly for as much as $ 10 million . The film has already spawned a forthcoming animated TV_show , an album ( on which Carrey makes his recording debut , with a rendition of &quot; Cuban Pete &quot; ) and a line of toys , and when the film was presented to international distributors at the Cannes Film Festival , the response was enthusiastically positive . &quot; One of the things that has helped a lot of studios thrive , and has certainly helped New Line , are the so-called tent poles , &quot; Shaye says . &quot; I ' d be happy to see ' The Mask ' become one of ours . I ' m just amazed that if we had made this film two years ago , we probably would not have had this kind of quality special_effects you see in the film today , because they weren ' t affordable or even available. &quot; Russell also sees the making of &quot; The Mask &quot; as a triumph of good timing . &quot; Because of the success of ' Ace Ventura , ' ' The Mask ' has gone from being described as ' a movie_starring the white guy from ' In Living Color ' to ' a Jim Carrey comedy , ' &quot; he says . &quot; And I think people will see in this film that Jim can be just as charming an actor when he ' s Stanley Ipkiss as he is a comedic madman when he plays the Mask. &quot; Shaye says that if the manic Mask does become a franchise player for New Line , there is always the chance that he may meet_up_with the stars of the company ' s other tent poles -- the &quot; Nightmare on Elm Street &quot; and &quot; Friday the 13th &quot; series . &quot; Universal did that kind of thing , and we ' re not blind to the possibilities , &quot; he says . &quot; If Universal could have Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein and the Wolf Man , maybe Stanley Ipkiss could meet_up_with Freddy and Jason. &quot;</TEXT>
