   <TEXT> Members of Laguna Hills High_School ' s academic decathlon team left for home a little heavier Sunday , laden with medals they won at the 15th annual California Academic Decathlon here . The team of nine academic all-stars finished in third place in the statewide competition held at the University of the Pacific , and second place among medium-sized schools . Alex Fung , 17 , led the Laguna Hills Hawks with two individual medals . Laguna Hills High team members took_home six individual medals for first , second or third place in three academic events . Taft High_School of Woodland Hills won the overall state title with 48 # 974 points_out of a possible 60 # 000 , followed by West High_School of Torrance with 46 # 278 points . Laguna Hills High notched 43 # 049 points . Forty-two schools from throughout the state competed . &quot; It ' s kind of neat that the top three teams were from Southern California , &quot; said Laguna Hills ' Loren Colin , 18 , who was awarded a first-place medal in social studies . Taft High , which had won the state crown four times , will head to the national championship in Newark , N.J. , April 15-17 . Academic decathlon contestants took exams in six areas : mathematics , science , social studies , economics , languages and literature , and fine_arts . They also did live interviews , wrote essays and gave speeches in addition to the Super Quiz , a multiple-choice competition held_in front of screaming parents and friends . The results satisfied many of the parents , who cheered along with the teen-agers when medals were handed_out . &quot; We were hoping we ' d finished in the top five , &quot; said Lynn Colin , Loren ' s mother . &quot; So we ' re very happy. &quot; Although the teens bettered that goal , finishing in the top three , some team members were disappointed . &quot; I could have done better , &quot; said Fung , who won a silver medal in the interview category and a bronze in math . &quot; It ' s discouraging because you work so hard for the whole year and the scores don ' t reflect that. &quot; In Saturday ' s Super Quiz event , Laguna Hills finished second , just ahead of a team from Sacramento County . The two teams ended the Super Quiz competition in a tie , but Laguna Hills gained points_after judges later disallowed a quiz question . Coaches praised 17-year-old team captain Megan Ferrell , who volunteered to help her teammates brush_up on problem subjects_to prepare_for the contest . &quot; The trophy is hers , &quot; said coach Kathy Lane , pointing to Ferrell , who held a huge third-place trophy in her hands . &quot; She sacrificed herself ; she gave_up being_on the basketball_team and going_to hockey_games to help everyone. &quot; The team also includes seniors Genevieve Go , Jamie Miller , Renn Amstead , Terry James , Romy Christensen and Bryan Cotta . They were coached by Lane and Roger Gunderson . Laguna Hills team members , who were Orange County ' s delegates at the tournament , began competing Friday against students representing 42 schools from Amador to Yolo counties . Team members started studying for the mind-wrenching competition last summer . &quot; We ' re just going_to go_home , &quot; James said after walking_off the awards platform with medals around his neck . &quot; We ' re going to have a cookout and burn all our ( study ) materials. &quot;</TEXT>
