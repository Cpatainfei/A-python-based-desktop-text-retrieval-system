   <HEADLINE> SWEETBREADS OFF MENU IN MAD COW FEARS ; BRITAIN : AUTHORITIES BAN THE DELICACY BECAUSE A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IT COULD BE INFECTED WITH THE AILMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s plenty of beef but no more sweetbreads on the menu at Le Gavroche , a chic French restaurant here . No use going elsewhere . You won ' t find home-grown sweetbreads , made from calves ' thymus , on any menu in Britain . The government has banned foods containing intestine or thymus from calves because a new scientific study suggested that they might be contaminated with the infectious agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy , commonly called &quot; mad cow disease. &quot; The sweetbread alert , in addition to recent threats by Germany to stop British beef imports , has focused new attention on the fatal brain ailment that has killed 131 # 050 cattle in the last eight years . The government insists that beef is safe , particularly because all infected cows are killed and not used for food . Taking a similarly cautious approach , the European Union ' s agriculture commissioner , Rene Steichen , recently proposed banning exports of carcasses from British herds that had not been disease-free for at least six years . Steichen ' s spokesman , Gerry Kiely , said there was no evidence that mad cow disease threatened humans . &quot; We ' re taking measures to exclude a risk which is not there by all evidence , &quot; he said in Brussels . British government investigators who did the recent study said it sheds_light_on the basic biology of the illness -- showing how the agent travels through the cow ' s body -- but does not prove that the thymus or intestine are dangerous to eat . The ban was taken as a precaution . &quot; There is no evidence that even if you ate infected brains you ' d get BSE ( mad cow disease ) , but the government has to be cautious , &quot; said Kevin Taylor , assistant chief veterinary officer of the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food . The epidemic has spurred scientific studies exploring the basic biology of both the human and animal forms of this puzzling ailment . &quot; It ' s a red-hot area of science , &quot; said Dr. Gareth Roberts , a neuroscientist at Harrow Hospital . &quot; We ' ve learned a lot more about the molecular_biology of the disease. &quot; Spongiform encephalopathy is a fatal brain disease striking animals and humans , causing sponge-like holes in the brain . Cattle with the disease stagger and drool , symptoms giving the disease its popular name . No one knows what causes the ailment , which can linger for 30 years in humans or five years in cows before symptoms strike . Cows are thought to have caught the disease by eating offal from infected sheep , which has since been removed from their food supply . The human forms of the disease , all extremely rare , are called kuru , Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) , and German-Straussler Scheinker Syndrome ( GSS ) . It strikes less than one in a_million people worldwide . People in Papua New Guinea got kuru from eating infected human brains . About seven American children and a_few in Britain , France and Australia got CJD when they were treated with human_growth_hormone derived from brain tissue between 1963 and 1985 . Shortly after the link was identified in 1985 , most countries banned the use of brain-derived human_growth_hormone and switched to genetically synthesized hormone . Some people get_it from inheriting a faulty brain protein . There is no evidence that anyone has ever gotten the disease from eating beef from an infected cow . In fact , the human and animal forms may be triggered by different agents . Despite a slew of studies , no one knows the specific agent that provokes the brain damage . The mysterious agent alters the shape of a crucial brain protein , progressively destroying the brain , said Professor John Bourne , director of the Institute for Animal Health . Some scientists suspect the agent is a virus-like substance ; others say it is an infectious protein . The new British study offers a glimpse into the basic biology of the illness by showing that it somehow travels through the intestine before getting_to the brain . Government scientists infected 4-month-old calves with BSE by feeding them brain_stems from sick cows . The calves were then killed two months , six months or 10 months later . Scientists injected a variety of cow parts into the brains of mice . Those that were injected with pieces of small_intestine contracted spongiform encephalopathy , suggesting the infectious agent lurks in the gut . Although the study did not provide evidence that the disease is in the thymus , the government officials banned its use for sweetbreads as a precaution .</TEXT>
