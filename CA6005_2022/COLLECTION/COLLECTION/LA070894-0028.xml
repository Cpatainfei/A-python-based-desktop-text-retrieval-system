   <HEADLINE> BALTICS : FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE ? ; PROBLEM FOR 3 LANDS -- FOREIGN DOMINATORS AND DESCENDANTS IN THEIR MIDST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No issue more energizes Russia ' s nationalists than the perceived need to assure the state ' s protection to the 25 million or so ethnic Russians who live_in the now independent countries of the former Soviet_Union . And no issue more disturbs the people and governments of some of those newly independent countries , the three Baltic_republics especially , than what to do about the ethnic Russians in their midst . President Clinton boldly addressed this controversy earlier this week when he became the first American leader to visit Latvia . He said the right things , and said them very well . But the cold reception given his moderate words indicates just how sensitive is the subject he raised . About one-third of Latvia ' s 2.68 million people are Russians . As with the Russians in the other Baltic_states -- there are about 390 # 000 in Lithuania and more_than 500 # 000 in Estonia -- most came_after 1940 , when the Soviet_Union forcibly annexed the three countries . To the resentful majority populations , the Russians are invaders who should now go_home . But to most Russians who live there the Baltics are their home . Here is one of those seemingly irreconcilable human problems that can so easily provide the spark for a political explosion . It ' s impossible not to sympathize_with the Baltic peoples , who regained control over their homelands after half a century of foreign domination . But sympathy must also go_to the Russians among them , many of whom have never known any other home . The United States has been trying to help broker a deal that would see the withdrawal of all Russian troops still in the Baltics in exchange for agreement by the three states to allow resident Russians to become citizens . That deal has included an offer of housing vouchers worth $ 25 # 000 for each of the 2 # 500 Russian officers still in Latvia and Estonia if they go_back to Russia . That would help with part of the problem . The larger part -- the rights that might be granted to the remaining Russians -- is infinitely more difficult . As with so many ethnic-political conflicts in Europe , this is not simply a local issue . Most Russians are concerned about the fate of their countrymen in the Baltics , and most probably think their government has an obligation to use force if need be to help protect them . Washington is right to use its good offices to try to find an acceptable solution . The challenge is getting all_the parties to agree on just what acceptable means .</TEXT>
