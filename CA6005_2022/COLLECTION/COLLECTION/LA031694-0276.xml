   <HEADLINE> $ 12-MILLION LOTTO TICKET IN LIMBO AS 2 PURSUE OWNERSHIP CLAIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Will the real $ 12-million winner of the California lottery please stand_up ? that ' s what those who have been following the Chae vs . Kim Super Lotto scandal want to know . Is the rightful Lotto winner the Riverside liquor_store owner who claims he was robbed of the ticket by two of his employees ? Or is it one of the store workers , who says his boss threatened to have him deported as an illegal immigrant if he didn ' t hand_over his winnings ? Since the local Korean news media began to report the story last week , Korean Americans throughout Southern California have been debating the merits of each side , trying to figure_out who is the innocent victim and who is the bad_guy . &quot; Everybody says the story is unbelievable and shocking , &quot; said Jong Hoon Lee , a reporter who has been covering the story for the Korea Central Daily . &quot; People say it ' s like a story out of a cartoon. &quot; Meanwhile , until the legal battle is resolved , the $ 12-million jackpot is staying in state hands . &quot; It ' s very unusual to have a winning ticket being held_up because of the uncertainty of its owner , &quot; said Bob Taylor , a spokesman for the California State Lottery in Sacramento . &quot; Our security agents have looked_into it carefully , and we will not declare a winner until the situation is resolved legally. &quot; On Jan . 29 , store owner Soo Jang Chae bought a lotto ticket for the California Super Lotto drawing later that night and placed it in the store ' s cash_register for safekeeping . He was not at the store when the results of the drawing were announced , according to a lawsuit filed by Chae and his attorney , Jae Lee . Later that night , according to the lawsuit , two store employees , Dong Pil Kim and Kihyun Park , found a scrap of paper listing Chae ' s selections for the drawing . After realizing that their boss held a winning ticket , they took the ticket from the store ' s cash_register and conspired to steal it and claim it as their own , the lawsuit states . The next day , Kim told Chae he had won the lottery and offered to give Chae half of his earnings to repay him for his generosity . Kim ' s sister , Eun Ahn , signed the ticket for her brother because Kim is not a legal resident of the United States . &quot; Kim and Chae met the next day , and &quot; Kim confessed to Chae that it was really his ticket , &quot; Lee said . &quot; But Kim made himself out as a hero by saying that he saved the ticket from being stolen by Park. &quot; Chae contacted Ahn and her husband , Hyung Kuk Ahn , and they agreed to surrender another 10 % of the winnings they were sharing with Kim , Lee said . After changing the ticket ownership to 60 % for Chae and 40 % for Kim , Park learned that he was being cut_out of the deal and told his boss that Kim was a key conspirator in the plot to steal the ticket , Lee said . &quot; The initial agreement was that Kim and I would split the money , &quot; said Park , who has agreed to testify on Chae ' s behalf , although he is a defendant in Chae ' s lawsuit . &quot; I decided to testify for Chae because I was so angry that Mr. Kim betrayed me . He was trying to make me out as the only bad guy. &quot; After Park ' s confession , Chae confronted the Ahn couple , and they threatened to burn_down his liquor_store , Lee said . Chae offered them $ 1 million to settle the_matter but they refused . The store owner then filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior_Court , claiming he was a victim of fraud , conspiracy , conversion and trespass . He also filed a report with Riverside police , who are investigating the case . &quot; I went_to the same high_school in Korea as Mr. Ahn , &quot; said Chae , who came_to the United States in 1981 . &quot; I gave Mr. Kim a job and treated him like a real brother . I ' m very disappointed because they ' re so greedy. &quot; Meanwhile , Kim and his lawyer , Richard Song-Uk Kim , are preparing a lawsuit of_their_own . Attorney Kim said his client is the real victim because his boss threatened to have him deported unless he agreed to share his lottery earnings . Although Chae was present , Kim said his client purchased the winning lottery ticket on_his_own . After winning the jackpot , he said , Kim agreed to give his boss half of his earnings even though there was no agreement that they would split the prize . &quot; My client is a very generous guy , &quot; Kim said . &quot; He offered to split the money out of a humanitarian gesture. &quot; Attorney Kim said Chae became more greedy as time passed and pressured his client into giving_up 60 % of his winnings by threatening to turn him in to the Immigration and Naturalization Service if he objected . Kim said his client has applied for permanent residency status but has not received his green_card . &quot; Mr. Kim wanted to settle it amicably , so he agreed to give_up 10 % more , &quot; Richard Kim said . &quot; For someone without a green_card , whenever someone makes a threat to have you deported , that ' s very scary. &quot; Kim said his client was at the mercy of an &quot; unscrupulous employer who abused his human_rights , &quot; and is seeking sole ownership of the ticket . &quot; They ' re suffering from serious emotional distress , &quot; Richard Kim said of Kim and the Ahns . &quot; They ' re having trouble sleeping at night because of the damage to their reputation. &quot; Chae is also feeling burned by the media attention and is in hiding until the case is resolved in court . &quot; A friend told me that he overheard some people talking_about the case and they said they thought the store owner was a greedy , bad man , &quot; Chae said . &quot; My family and I are very unhappy now. &quot; Chae attributes his current situation to bad_luck . Several years ago , Chae won a Ford Thunderbird in a contest sponsored by a grocery_store . A few days later , the car was stolen and it was never recovered . &quot; When I get luck , people take it from me , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s my life. &quot;</TEXT>
