   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ; TORRES SOFTENS STAND , SAYS GARAMENDI OVER-REGULATED INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was nothing unusual for Assemblyman Charles W . Quackenbush . The Republican candidate for state insurance commissioner , appearing before a friendly audience of insurance_agents , was again assailing the present commissioner for over-regulating the industry . Quackenbush opposes heavy regulation . Outgoing Commissioner John Garamendi is an ardent regulator . What was unusual was that Quackenbush ' s Democratic opponent , state Sen . Art Torres , stood before the same group and joined in the criticism of Garamendi , agreeing that his attitude toward the industry is too negative . Torres ' speech more_than a week ago to the American Agents Alliance meeting in Burlingame struck a new note in his campaign . Before an industry audience , Torres suddenly sounded far friendlier than he has when addressing consumer gatherings . The agents ' group provided tape_recordings of the speeches of both Quackenbush and Torres . Although Torres did say on the tape that serving consumers would be his &quot; first priority , &quot; he quickly veered to statements suggesting that Garamendi had been too onerous a regulator and asserted that &quot; the consumer is not served well if the industry is not healthy in California. &quot; Also , in an apparent adverse comparison of Garamendi with his predecessor , industry-leaning Republican Roxani Gillespie , Torres told the agents : &quot; I just read that now we are 49th or 50th in the nation in terms of how we are perceived ( by insurers ) in respect_to regulation , in respect_to price , in respect_to competition . We cannot afford to continue with that kind of attitude , and we need to look_for other . . . opportunities to make California what it should be and where we were just four years ago , almost at No . 1 in terms of a competitive and open place for the industry. &quot; Later , during audience questioning , Torres pledged to undertake a performance audit of the Insurance Department , in part to find_out what had become of $ 23 million in fines levied by Garamendi against the industry . If irregularities were found , Torres said , &quot; I ' d have to determine whether to turn it over to the appropriate prosecuting authority. &quot; The Democratic candidate also told the agents , &quot; I ' m educated ( about insurance ) almost daily by my brother-in-law and my cousin , who are both agents in the property-casualty field. &quot; At another point he added , &quot; If it were up_to me , this office should be nonpartisan. &quot; Garamendi , provided a transcript of Torres ' remarks , said that the $ 23 million in fines went_to the state ' s general fund , and he expressed pride at being a tough regulator . &quot; If he is referring to the way the insurance industry views my regulation . . . it ' s never been my goal to serve the insurance industry and make them happy , but to serve the consumer , &quot; Garamendi said . &quot; I have taken a department that was the lap dog and the lackey of the industry and turned it into a growling watchdog for the consumer . I know that the industry does not like me , but I never signed_on to be their lover . Rather , I am their policeman. &quot; At the same time , Garamendi said he was pleased that Torres had said consumers would be his &quot; first priority. &quot; &quot; He will undoubtedly be a different commissioner than I am , but he will handle the task well , &quot; he added . In another remark to the agents , Torres promised if elected to form a partnership with the industry , but also said , &quot; That partnership has to be in the best interest of the consumer. &quot; In an interview later , Torres said he felt that in his speech to the agents his remarks were more critical of the Department of Insurance bureaucracy than of Garamendi . Torres noted that he refers to the agency ' s employees as &quot; burrocrats , &quot; to describe their stubbornness . &quot; We ' ve got a problem with civil_servants that nobody can control , &quot; he said . But the Democratic candidate also said that Garamendi ' s regulatory policies may be driving insurers out of California . &quot; If there ' s no insurance out there , that ' s not in the best interest of the consumer , &quot; he said . &quot; Making_it affordable and accessible as commissioner will be my responsibility. &quot;</TEXT>
