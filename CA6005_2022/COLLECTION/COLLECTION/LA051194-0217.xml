   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : SEPULVEDA BASIN ; FUNDS SOUGHT TO ERADICATE ARUNDO REEDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It sounds like the plot of a rejected film script : a 20-foot-tall killer invading a park and choking every living thing in its path . But the environmental threat of the Arundo_donax reed in the Sepulveda Basin is real , and conservation groups have asked Los Angeles County for $ 200 # 000 to literally weed out the problem with help from the Los Angeles Conservation Corps . &quot; This stuff is almost impossible to kill , &quot; said Melanie Ingalls , who wrote the grant proposal for the Los Angeles office of the National Audubon Society . &quot; It ' s like a forest , knocking_off natural plants that live_in the area , along with most of the insects and birds that rely_on the plants. &quot; Environmentalists are concerned that arundo , which can grow six inches a day , is obliterating the fragile ecosystem of one of the few remaining natural tributaries of the Los Angeles River -- Bull Creek in the Sepulveda Basin . The Audubon Society ' s proposal asks the Los Angeles County Regional Park and Open Space District for $ 200 # 000 in Proposition A funds to remove the bamboo-like reed along the creek between Victory Boulevard and the Los Angeles River , about a five-acre site . The work will also require a permit from the Los Angeles city departments of Public Works and Recreation and Parks . The project has the backing of several Valley environmental groups , including the Sierra Club , California Native Plant Society and the Army Corps of Engineers , which manages the Sepulveda Basin . &quot; Arundo has no value whatsoever , &quot; said Ted Carr , Army corps project manager . &quot; It ' s very prone to fire and soaks_up a lot of water . It ' s really a problem. &quot; &quot; This is a very beneficial project to restore the creek and give people a chance to observe native plant and animal populations , &quot; said Jill Swift , 64 , a member of the Coalition to Save Sepulveda Basin . &quot; The arundo just keeps them out. &quot; The funds would also be used to eradicate castor_bean and tree_tobacco , two poisonous_plants that also are not native to the area . But the bulk of the grant would go_to the Los Angeles Conservation Corps , a nonprofit agency that employs at-risk youths , whose task it will be to eradicate the reed . Arundo is a giant , non-native reed that guzzles up water , eliminating native , water-dependent plants and creating an inhospitable environment for wildlife . Human habitats are threatened when the unchecked reed begins to create fire hazards , drain creeks or alter water flow in flood-control channels such_as the Sepulveda Basin . The plant was brought over from Spain more_than 100 years ago primarily for erosion control . Its seeds are easily spread by both wind and water . Environmentalists believe the basin became inundated with arundo when seeds flowed down the creek and took_root , wiping_out elderberry_bushes , willows , monkey flower , mule_fat and even young sycamore trees . Another result : blue herons and white egrets , that would often visit the creek side , cannot even land in the dense foliage . To restore the creek to its original habitat , the grant would pay_for a crew of 12 corps members to comb the creek with clippers for four months , slashing away at the stalks just above the ground . To prevent regrowth , an herbicide must immediately be sprayed on the shorn areas . Arundo is extremely hardy , secreting a protective gel that can halt the herbicide if it is not applied quickly enough . JEFF SCHNAUFER</TEXT>
