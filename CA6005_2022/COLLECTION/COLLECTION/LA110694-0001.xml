   <HEADLINE> NO MAN ' S LAND ; THE TERRITORY OF ' TWO EAGLES ' SHOULD BE A TREASURED WILDERNESS WERE IT NOT FOR ITS TRAGIC LOCATION ON THE BORDER BETWEEN THE U.S. AND MEXICO ; TWO EAGLES / DOS AGUILAS : THE NATURAL WORLD OF THE UNITED STATES-MEXICO BORDERLANDS , TEXT BY PETER STEINHART , PHOTOGRAPHS BY TUPPER ANSEL BLAKE ( UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS : $ 55 ; 256 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I was growing_up in the desert of west Texas and southern New Mexico , I saw the landscape change with the encroachment of the 1.5 million people from El Paso and Juarez . In the 1960s and ' 70s , you could still escape the polluted haze of border industries by hiking into the Organ Mountains near Las Cruces , N.M. When I left the area for good in 1978 , the Franklin Mountains surrounding El Paso were no longer a haven because new housing_developments had cut_into them , destroying the fragile , ecological balance and the beauty of those bare mountains ; you had to go_farther into the southern New Mexico desert to find solitude . Years later , I wrote a book of essays about the desert and its rich , natural world as I had known it in my childhood . I recounted my experiences with great , diamondback rattlers and the hundreds of collar lizards that skipped everywhere I walked . I thought I knew everything there was to know about the area . After reading and gazing at &quot; Two Eagles / Dos Aguilas , &quot; my view of where I grew_up has been completely disrupted and pleasantly changed . Peter Steinhart ' s essays , written in clear , simple language , invite the reader to join him on his explorations and discoveries . His knowledge about the Southwest reveals a whole new_world that is thriving along what Steinhart calls &quot; the most ecologically diverse region in North America. &quot; Despite the disappearance of much of the desert and wildlife around major cities such_as El Paso , Steinhart ' s book is encouraging . He shows how the borderlands are very much alive and surviving current problems such_as pollution , industrial mismanagement , the population boom and political tensions between the United States and Mexico . &quot; Two Eagles &quot; is a tour of the natural world along the border from San Diego to the Texas Gulf Coast . Steinhart and photographer Tupper Ansel Blake drew their boundaries to include everything 50 miles north of the border and everything 50 miles south . The region in between is a belt of valuable natural_resources , ancient rock valleys , pockets of tropical fauna and bird species , alpine forests and mighty currents of mountain waters churning into two of our most crucial waterways , the Colorado and Rio Grande rivers . This is one of those rare books in which the imagery of fine writing is nourished by the imagery of fine photography . As I read about Steinhart ' s travels , and became hypnotized by Blake ' s photographs , I realized that I may have been guilty of dismissing much of the area I wrote_about as a desolate wasteland whose life was over . &quot; Two Eagles &quot; is a groundbreaking book because it does_away_with the myth many natives themselves have been guilty of promoting about the borderlands . There was always more to the region than I knew about . The deserts , mountains , high forests and green valleys of the borderlands are beautiful , mysterious and environmentally fragile . The Chihuahua desert of southern New Mexico was a world large enough for a small boy , but as its plants and wildlife were overrun by new streets , its stripped landscape forced many of us to believe there was nothing left . Steinhart ' s experience as a naturalist and environmental writer has drawn_out secrets of the borderlands and its natural world that few natives , much less outsiders , would know about . He documents little-known species of animals native to the borderlands : jaguars , ocelots , parrots , bears and wolves . The region is abundant with plant_life that varies from yuccas , ocotillo and lechugilla to lesser-known ebony trees , guayacans , cenizo and anacuas . As overview in his first essay , &quot; On the Border , &quot; Steinhart writes : &quot; The borderlands . . . are that part of the continent where temperate life meets tropical life . To the north , where most rains fall , are rolling prairies and thick forests . To the south , the land rises into the Mexican plateau ; there , too , the land is wetter and more forested . Draw_a_line fifty miles north of and parallel to the entire border : the resulting 95 # 000 square_miles contain the United States ' richest biodiversity , more species per square_mile than any other part of the nation , with the sole possible exception of southern Florida . A similar strip south of the border is one of Mexico ' s areas of highest biodiversity , and Mexico boasts a number of endemic species perhaps higher than any other nation ' s. &quot; Steinhart is not , however , celebrating the biological richness of the borderlands without warning about its environmental degradation . The pivotal chapter of &quot; Two Eagles &quot; is &quot; In the Kingdom of Grasses , &quot; in which Steinhart describes the vast grasslands found along the border . The main grass region lies_in Southwestern New Mexico , where the best year-round grazing is found . Here the 40 different species of native grasses include black grana , blue grana , hay grana , boboza and sacaton . Beginning with Coronado ' s arrival at Zuni Pueblo in 1540 , Steinhart traces the history of men coming_to the borderlands and transforming them forever with the introduction of cattle . The reader ' s realization of the ecological damage and contradictions of settling the West clash dramatically with the romantic impression the beautiful book initially creates . The borderlands may still be one of the richest natural areas of the continent , but men continue to shape the history of its isolated landscape . The fine ecological balance is tipping toward complete destruction of the borderlands , until there will be nothing left but those new steel fences the U.S. Border_Patrol is erecting to keep Mexicans out . Steinhart ' s insight on the fragile relationship between men and nature is the underlying tragic theme of &quot; Two Eagles. &quot; &quot; This distinctive biological province , &quot; he writes , &quot; would be studied and celebrated as unique and precious , like the Everglades or the Great Plains or the redwood forest , but for one fact . It is bisected by the U.S.-Mexico border , and though the line is no wider than a pencil_lead , it casts a shadow so broad as_to obscure the nature of this world. &quot; Another of Steinhart ' s contributions is his study of the environment south of that shadow . &quot; Two Eagles &quot; effectively erases Northern Mexico ' s image of a vast , moon-like terrain of harsh deserts . One of the lushest of tropical_zones , the mountains of northern Mexico have been home to large populations of black_bears , wolves , jaguars and rare species of predatory birds . The last three chapters are devoted to ecological problems in Mexico and the efforts of its few environmental groups . Their successes have been limited by the political climate in Mexico and barriers that make_it difficult for U.S. groups to work south of the border . One can only hope that Steinhart ' s wisdom , compassion and resolve and Blake ' s visual intensity will encourage more people to pay_attention to the borderlands . In the last essay , which gives the book its title , Steinhart concludes by writing : &quot; I looked_up and saw a dark shape to the southwest , just over the bulk of the Santa Catalina Mountains . It had the broad , board-like wings of an eagle . It drifted on an unseen current , and pumped its great wings every now and then to stay afloat . I stared hard through the haze , looking_for the throat or wing_tips of a caracara . As my gaze followed it , it seemed to flash a burst of light and then to vanish in the sinking sun . When I gained my vision and looked again , the bird was gone . Which eagle was it ? The eagle of the natural setting or the eagle of the flag ? The eagle of community and spirit or the eagle of militant purpose ? Which eagle will fly over the borderlands of the future ? &quot;</TEXT>
