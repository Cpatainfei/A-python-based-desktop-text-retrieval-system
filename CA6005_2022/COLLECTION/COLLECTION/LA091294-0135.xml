   <TEXT> Two weeks before Thanksgiving , 1959 , minuscule amounts of a potentially cancer-causing weedkiller were discovered in some cranberries grown in Washington state and Oregon . The New York Times put the story on Page 1 five times in seven days . Other media followed_suit . People panicked . But a nationwide inspection of cranberries disclosed no contamination other_than at the original sites , and not one case of illness from tainted cranberries was reported anywhere in the country . Such false alarms were uncommon in the 1950s . Oh sure , there were scare stories about strontium-90 in milk and about fluoride in toothpaste and in the water_supply , but these were isolated and largely confined to narrow interest_groups . In the 1990s , scare stories are omnipresent . The perception of risk has become so pervasive , there are now organizations , schools , institutes , journals and careers dedicated solely to its assessment . Given the media ' s critical role in setting the national agenda -- especially on issues as complex and politically charged as those involving potential health hazards -- many journalists , scientists and social critics are concerned about the alarmist tone that suffuses the media ' s portrayal of daily life . They say such coverage can frighten people and prompt them to take unnecessary risks -- keeping handguns in their homes , going_on rigid , unsound diets or avoiding necessary medical treatment . &quot; Cry wolf &quot; coverage may also deprive people of the ability to distinguish between serious and not-so-serious risks . &quot; We are in danger of surrendering to feelings of helplessness and apathy , which paralyze us in the act of coping even in situations where personal action can make a difference , &quot; medical researchers from the Centers_for_Disease_Control in Atlanta said in a report , &quot; Interpreting Risks to the Public , &quot; presented to the &quot; Prevention 85 &quot; conference in Atlanta . Besides , asks Paul Portney , vice_president of Resources for the Future , a Washington think_tank that specializes in environmental issues , &quot; If everything is as harmful as we ' re told , how come we ' re healthier and living longer . . . than ever before ? &quot; The media offer few answers to this seeming paradox . In fact , says Cristine Russell , a special health correspondent for the Washington Post , who spent a year studying risk while on a grant from the Alicia Patterson Foundation , &quot; The media have been a big player in widespread public confusion about risk. &quot; A big player , indeed . &quot; Studies have shown that people get more information about risk and hazard from the media than they do from their physicians or anyone else , &quot; says Walter Willett , professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health . Government decision-makers also &quot; get their information from the media more_than any place else , &quot; says Clarence ( Terry ) Davies , director of the Center for Risk Management at Resources for the Future . Thus the media are a vital link in a fragile but circular information chain that connects scientists , politicians and the public . Typically , a_few anxious , often angry people say they ' re worried about something -- a toxic_waste_dump , say . The media cover the story . Other people see the story and start worrying themselves : Is the dump near them toxic ? Are their children in danger ? They demand answers -- and action -- from their elected officials . The officials -- primarily in Congress -- read the same stories and listen to their constituents and respond by making funding and policy decisions for the Environmental Protection Agency , the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory_agencies created to protect the public . &quot; We live_in a democracy , after all , and it shouldn ' t surprise us that we have set policy according to what the public ' s been most alarmed about , &quot; William Reilly , former director of the EPA , said last spring on the ABC News_program &quot; Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death ? &quot; &quot; That has resulted in a sort of discontinuous series of crises , episodic events which got a lot of publicity , television exposure , press attention , and resulted in Congress writing a new law. &quot; Many of those laws have proved flawed , either in conception or in enforcement . Writing in the Washington Post last spring , Estelle Fishbein , vice_president of Johns Hopkins University , argued that the 1980 Superfund law , designed to clean_up hazardous waste sites , had &quot; failed miserably. &quot; Only 15 % of the 1 # 300 Superfund sites identified by the EPA have been completely cleaned_up , Fishbein said , despite an expenditure of $ 13.5 billion -- 25 % of which has gone_to attorneys . Daniel Puzo , who covers food safety issues for the Los Angeles Times , says overheated media coverage of pesticides has resulted in a similar waste of federal funds monitoring that risk when the government should be devoting its resources to looking_for food-borne microbes such_as salmonella and E . coli , which are &quot; by far the greater danger in terms of maintaining the healthfulness of the food supply. &quot; The Centers_for_Disease_Control say there are 6.5 million cases of food-borne illnesses -- and 9 # 000 deaths -- a year . But only when there ' s a large-scale breakout -- as happened last year when four people died and 500 got sick after eating Jack in the Box hamburgers -- do the media or the government seem to take_notice . &quot; There will be 70 to 80 reporters covering a Raiders game , &quot; Puzo says , &quot; but only three or four reporters in the whole country cover food safety full-time . The media don ' t cover it so the government doesn ' t seem to worry much about it . There are so few federal inspectors for the number of food-processing plants in the country that it ' s totally ridiculous. &quot; Reilly says some of the government ' s regulatory laws that have proved ineffective or misguided should be reconsidered . So do many others . But bureaucracies are difficult to reverse . In an interview with the Los Angeles Times two days before President Clinton nominated him to the United States Supreme Court , federal Judge Stephen Breyer said the media are such a powerful force in risk perception and policy-making that &quot; once a particular substance becomes a matter of such public interest that it ' s written_about continuously in the press , the battle is over ; &quot; the initial thrust and angle the media provide largely determine the outcome of the subsequent debate . &quot; What constitutes news is not necessarily what constitutes a significant public health_problem , &quot; says John Graham , director of the Center for Risk Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health . &quot; The bizarre , the mysterious , that which people have difficulty imagining happening &quot; -- that ' s news , that ' s what the media cover . Peoples ' perceptions about risk are &quot; definitely more closely related to media coverage than to actual statistics , &quot; says Paul Slovic , the president of Decision Research Inc. in Eugene , Ore. , and a psychology professor at the University of Oregon . There are perhaps no better examples of this phenomenon in recent years than the public panics over the pesticide Alar on apples ( see accompanying story ) and the presence of asbestos in New York City schools . In the 1960s and ' 70s , miners and other industrial workers who had worked in asbestos-laden environments 20 or 30 years earlier began to show a high incidence of lung_cancer and other lung diseases . Congress and the EPA subsequently took steps to limit asbestos exposure . But many officials failed to take_into_account the enormous difference between the exposure of someone working with a toxic substance all day and someone who might be exposed to it occasionally and briefly . They also failed to differentiate between the kind of asbestos that can be truly dangerous ( amphiboles ) and the white , chrysotile-based asbestos that is used 95 % of the time in the United States and that repeated studies have shown is &quot; not a health risk in the non-occupational environment , &quot; as a team of international experts concluded in a study published by Science magazine in 1990 . But when crumbly chrysotile asbestos was found in several New York schools in the summer of 1993 -- after federally mandated reports had pronounced those sites free_of such &quot; contamination &quot; -- terrified parents , goaded on by the tabloid media and local television , demanded action . Then-Mayor David Dinkins announced that no school would be allowed to reopen for the new school_year until it had been inspected anew . Classrooms opened two weeks late for the city ' s 1 million school-age children -- a large_number of whom may have been &quot; in more danger on the streets than in school , &quot; as one New York Times story noted . The inspection , cleanup and delay occasioned by the asbestos scare cost taxpayers more_than $ 120 million . Some journalists say they covered the asbestos story more as an expose of incompetent and fraudulent government testing than as a health hazard . But the testing would not have been nearly as big a story if the purported hazard -- cancer -- had not been mentioned so prominently . After all , no one would have been outraged if officials had lied_about removing peanut_butter from the public_schools . Even the New York Times , which did emphasize the falsified inspection reports in its generally sober coverage , used such words and phrases as &quot; asbestos hazards &quot; and &quot; contaminated with the cancer-causing material &quot; and &quot; asbestos that posed dangers to children &quot; in its coverage . Although there were a_few brief cautionary phrases in the early New York Times coverage , it wasn ' t until almost a month after the first story on the &quot; crisis &quot; that the paper published a lengthy Page 1 story saying health experts and school officials thought the risks posed by a_few months in schools with asbestos were &quot; negligible &quot; -- less than the statistical likelihood of being killed by lightning . The crumbly asbestos may well have offered some risk , but the decision to delay the opening of school was &quot; based more on a need to reassure fearful parents than on any estimate of health risk , &quot; the story quoted health experts and school officials as saying . As a trustee of the New York School Construction Authority told the New York Times , &quot; Notwithstanding all_of the evidence , people still have an extraordinary fear. &quot; The media both cover and exacerbate that fear . But the media are not the only thread in the web of fear , whether the issue is asbestos in the schools , fat in food or crime on the streets . Human psychology , individually and collectively , is also important . &quot; Perception of risk is a very value-determined thing , &quot; says Davies of the Center for Risk Management . &quot; There are people who , for whatever reasons -- early . . . toilet training or genetics or whatever -- are very risk-averse . . . very paranoid in some cases about what society is ' doing ' to them. &quot; The asbestos scare pushed two &quot; hot buttons &quot; for almost everyone -- dread of cancer and compassion for children -- both of which far outweighed any reassurances from scientists . Students of risk perception are not surprised by this . They say most people look_at much more_than scientific evidence in responding to all kinds of risks . Indeed , they often ignore scientific evidence altogether . As Oliver Wendell Holmes , the celebrated U.S. Supreme Court justice , put it : &quot; Most people think dramatically , not quantitatively. &quot; In covering risk , most reporters -- who are , after all , lay people , not scientists -- generally reflect this attitude . To many , a dramatic -- often melodramatic -- approach to risk seems &quot; strikingly an American phenomenon , &quot; in the media and the public alike , the late British journalist Henry Fairlie wrote in 1989 . He said this approach is &quot; yet another distortion of the philosophy of rights underlying the Constitution , as if the Declaration_of_Independence had been rewritten to include freedom from risk among the self-evident rights_to_life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness. &quot; &quot; The idea that our individual lives . . . can and should be risk-free has grown to be an obsession , driven far and deep into American attitudes , &quot; Fairlie wrote . The public ' s exaggerated fears , rather than scientific expertise , may increasingly be &quot; setting priorities for regulations and research , &quot; says Sharon Friedman , chair of the journalism department at Lehigh University in Bethlehem , Pa . In her article &quot; Media , Risk Assessment and Numbers &quot; in the current issue of the journal &quot; Risk : Health , Safety &amp; Environment , &quot; Friedman quotes scientists as saying that media attention and the resultant &quot; public pressure on legislators and government_agencies skew environmental decision-making. &quot; The government may spend money trying to regulate risks that aren ' t really risky , while ignoring genuine risks . The EPA admitted as much in a 1987 report that said , &quot; Overall , EPA ' s priorities appear more closely aligned with public_opinion than with our estimated risks. &quot; William Allman , writing in Science 85 magazine , warned that our increasing &quot; desire for absolute certainty makes a high probability , such_as 85 % , seem insufficient. &quot; The ramifications of that attitude are profound and far-reaching . Experts say 90 % of the toxic material could be removed from many waste sites in a relatively reasonable time , for example , at a relatively reasonable cost . But in an effort to provide absolute safety , many years and tens of millions of dollars are often spent trying to remove the last 10 % . Or the last 5 % . Or the last 1 % . &quot; Removing that last little bit can involve limited technological choice , high cost , devotion of considerable ( Environmental Protection ) Agency resources , large legal_fees and endless argument , &quot; Breyer wrote in his book , &quot; Breaking the Vicious_Circle : Toward Effective Risk Regulation. &quot; &quot; Experts calculate that the EPA rules , regulating sources such_as benzene storage vessels and coke byproduct recovery plants , save a total of three to four lives per year , at a cost of well_over $ 200 million , &quot; more_than $ 50 million per life , Breyer says . In contrast , one study has shown that vaccinating 18-month-olds against hemophilus influenza Type_B , the leading cause of bacterial meningitis , would save lives at a cost of $ 68 # 000 each . Breyer and others warn that the resources available to regulate and combat various health risks are not limitless . What many critics call &quot; headline hysteria &quot; about relatively small risks often prompt the government to spend money regulating those risks , and that means money may_not be available for research and for more serious social , medical and environmental problems -- prenatal care , childhood immunizations , day_care , housing , education , highway safety , shelters for battered women , smoke detectors in low-income rental housing , hot lunches for poor children . . . . Environmentalists and consumer advocates disagree vigorously with the Breyer argument . &quot; The federal_government has under-regulated or regulated too late far more often than it ' s over-regulated , &quot; says Dr. Sidney Wolfe , director of the Health Research Group of Ralph Nader ' s Public Citizen organization . Wolfe ticks_off a series of drugs and devices , from the arthritis medication Oraflex to the Dalkon Shield IUD , which caused serious health_problems before being removed from the market . Al Meyerhoff , senior attorney for the Natural_Resources Defense Council , an environmental organization , says , &quot; If we ' ve learned a single lesson about toxic chemicals in the last decade , it ' s that we cannot trust government regulation to protect us from these exposures . &quot; That makes risk information and communication even more important , &quot; he says , &quot; because in the final analysis , the public has to protect itself. &quot; Moreover , supporters of strict government regulation argue that it ' s callous to put a price_tag on human life and that it ' s always better to risk wasting money than to err on the side of compromise and risk wasting lives . It ' s a &quot; guns or butter myth . . . a smoke_screen . . . very naive , &quot; Wolfe says , to suggest that money not spent on current regulatory efforts would otherwise be spent on more important health and welfare projects . He and others worry that money saved on regulation and consumer protection would be funneled to deficit reduction or the Pentagon or other projects they think are less important . But public policy experts say Congress could specifically earmark funds for certain health and social programs , and they complain that the media ignore this possibility as well as other economic aspects of environmentalism in their coverage of risk . &quot; Many economists are intensely frustrated that the media refuse to discuss the fact that environmental protection often doesn ' t stand_up to a cost / benefit test , &quot; journalist Gregg Easterbrook wrote in the New Republic in 1990 . Many scientists feel the same way . &quot; The press hasn ' t even begun to address &quot; the cost / benefit ratio , says Lois Gold , director of the Carcinogenic Potency Project at UC Berkeley . &quot; There ' s no perspective on cost in the press. &quot; Conservatives have largely co-opted the cost / benefit argument , though , and since they are largely seen as being pro-business , many in both the news media and the political_arena tend to dismiss their arguments out of hand , looking only at their ideology , not at their science or their economics . Many environmental reporters not only know_nothing about economics , they ' re &quot; hostile toward thinking_about &quot; risk issues in economic terms , says Rob Stavins , who teaches environmental economics and public policy at Harvard_University . &quot; A lot of people think if you take an economic perspective on the environment , that must just be worrying about business and their interests. &quot; But others argue that the cost / benefit argument should ultimately be a liberal argument , not a conservative argument , because government regulations that raise the cost of doing business and take money out of the economy ultimately hurt poorer people the most , eliminating jobs and raising prices for those whose cause has been most often championed by liberals . Moreover , they argue , economic well-being is the greatest single factor_in good_health , a point that is rarely discussed in the mainstream media . &quot; The mortality_rate for higher-income individuals is generally less than that for lower-income individuals , &quot; Ralph Kenney wrote in a 1990 issue of the journal Risk Analysis . &quot; Reasons for this relationship relate to , among other things , better nutrition , better sanitation , better health_care and better education -- all items that are easier to come_by with money. &quot; Indeed , many experts in risk assessment worry that media and political emphasis on other , much smaller risks than poverty not only hurts poor people but damages the overall economy and social fabric . The desire for a risk-free society is &quot; one of the most debilitating influences in America today , progressively enfeebling the economy with a mass of safety regulations and . . . threatening to create an unbuoyant and uninventive society , &quot; Fairlie wrote in the New Republic . As Graham , the Harvard risk analyst puts it , &quot; We all want zero risk . The problem is if every citizen in this country demands zero risk , we ' re going to bankrupt the country. &quot; Modern technology has made_it possible to detect tiny amounts of potentially harmful chemicals that would have eluded discovery in previous generations . This means the government can enact regulations to protect Americans from previously hidden dangers . But when this technological capability is combined with Americans ' zeal for zero risk , the result can , at times , both distort the political process and disrupt the economy . Joseph Lelyveld , executive editor of the New York Times , attributes our desire for zero risk to &quot; something in the American soul that seems to think we should all live forever , and therefore , anything that can hurt you is part of a conspiracy to prevent that. &quot; This , of course , plays into the peculiarly American determination to look_for villains ( and heroes ) , to fix blame , to insist on answers , reasons , solutions , no matter how random or inexplicable a given event may be . As a_people , we are uncomfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity . We prefer black_and_white to gray . People are_sick ? It must be DDT . Or Dioxin . Or secondhand smoke . Never mind that scientists say the evidence isn ' t in yet . We want answers . Now . The media feed that appetite for immediate answers . Reporters aren ' t scientists -- or historians -- waiting for definitive findings . They have daily deadlines . Something &quot; might &quot; be dangerous ? that ' s good_enough for today ' s story ; if there ' s a new study tomorrow saying it ' s not dangerous , we ' ll report that story , too . &quot; There ' s an inherent conflict between the business of news and what social_scientists and others call ' risk communications , ' &quot; say social_scientists Eleanor Singer and Phyllis Endreny in the current issue of the journal Risk : Health , Safety &amp; Environment . &quot; To communicate information about hazards and risks in a way calculated to foster rational decision-making means providing detailed and precise information and immediate and long-term consequences , to weigh the costs and benefits of a hazard and its alternatives for the individual and for society , and to discuss the issues , moral and economic , that inhere_in hazardous processes and events , &quot; Singer and Endreny say . &quot; But reporting about hazards is ordinarily reporting about events rather than issues , about immediate consequences rather than long-term considerations , about harms ( injury , property destruction , death ) rather than risks -- i.e. , the statistical probability of harm . &quot; Alternatives are almost never considered in a story about a particular hazard , and when they are considered , their risks and benefits are not . Moral or ethical issues are generally absent from news_stories about hazards , and even economic issues are for the most part ignored. &quot; That inherent conflict between the tentative , incremental nature of science and the demands for immediate certainty in daily journalism almost inevitably leaves the public confused . Does the anti-oxidant beta carotene help prevent lung_cancer or might it contribute to lung_cancer ? Does margarine help fight heart_disease or does_it contribute to it ? Does chocolate raise cholesterol or does the stearic_acid in it actually lower cholesterol ? It all depends_on which morning ' s newspaper you read and which evening ' s newscast you watch . You can ' t tell the risks without a score card , and in this game , they seem to change the numbers almost daily . In July , the New York Times published a story saying &quot; fears about electromagnetic_radiation from power_lines and electrical appliances have circulated for years , but . . . scientists say there is no proof the radiation harms health. &quot; Two weeks later , the Los Angeles Times published a story saying : &quot; Electromagnetic fields , previously implicated in triggering leukemia , brain_tumors and breast_cancer , may play a far more important role in Alzheimer ' s disease , a USC researcher will report today. &quot; Contradictions and confusion about caffeine have been even more striking . In recent years , caffeine has been variously reported to cause cancer , to inhibit conception , to induce miscarriage , to cause birth_defects , to increase cholesterol , to trigger irregular heart beats , to aggravate ulcers and to increase urination . But caffeine has also been reported to help people lose_weight , improve hand-eye coordination , increase tolerance for exercise , promote clearer thinking , diminish drowsiness , make children more attentive in school and make adults less likely to suffer bronchial_asthma -- or to commit suicide . You would think that with all_the advances in modern medicine and technology , we could find a simple answer to the simple question &quot; Is a cup of coffee bad for you ? &quot; But many people are afraid of technology , and many others have lost faith in it . Indeed , people ' s attitude toward technology helps explain their attitude toward risk . Next : What we ' re afraid of -- and why . Jacci Cenacveira of The Times editorial library assisted with the research for this series . Confusion Over Caffeine Perhaps no substance has been the subject of more conflicting media and scientific reports in recent years than caffeine . So , is a cup of coffee bad for you or not ?</TEXT>
