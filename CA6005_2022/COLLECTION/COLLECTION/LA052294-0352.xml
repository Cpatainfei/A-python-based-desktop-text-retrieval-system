   <HEADLINE> ISRAELIS , PALESTINIANS PATROL JOINTLY IN GAZA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli and Palestinian security_forces began joint patrols in the Gaza Strip on Saturday , a day after Islamic militants killed two Israeli soldiers and escaped . A leading figure in Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin ' s Labor_Party warned that if the Palestine Liberation Organization fails to stop attacks on Israelis from the autonomous zones in Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho , it could endanger negotiations on self-rule in the rest of the occupied lands . &quot; One of the most important foundations of the Gaza-Jericho model is joint Israeli-Palestinian security work , &quot; said Ephraim Sneh , a Labor legislator and reserve general . &quot; It is aimed , among other things , at preventing such attacks , &quot; Sneh told Israeli television . &quot; It has to be clear that if this model doesn ' t work , there won ' t be any point in continuing the negotiations in the next stages. &quot; Under the Israel-PLO autonomy accord , the joint patrols are to secure three roads in the strip . Each patrol is made_up of an Israeli and a Palestinian jeep , both identified by orange flags . In the Jericho zone , joint patrols began a week earlier , immediately after the hand-over of authority there . Israeli troops and Palestinian police also set_up new checkpoints on Gaza ' s main north-south thoroughfare , and motorists were asked to show identification and open their trunks . Israeli troops checked cars with yellow Israeli plates , and Palestinian police checked white-plated Gaza cars . The heightened security came_after two Israeli soldiers were shot and killed Friday at the Israeli-controlled Erez checkpoint between Gaza and Israel . The gunmen drove_up in a car , killed two approaching soldiers and fled into the autonomous zone . Neither Israeli troops nor Palestinian police pursued them . Both the fundamentalist Islamic group Hamas and the extremist Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for the attack . Angered by the killings , some Israeli leaders demanded that peace talks be curtailed , and Rabin barred Gaza residents from entering Israel until May 29 . The PLO ' s ability to keep Muslim opponents of the autonomy accord in check and stop them from attacking Israeli targets is seen as a key test of the agreement . PLO officials have said they need more time to organize the Palestinian police_force before they can effectively block such attacks .</TEXT>
