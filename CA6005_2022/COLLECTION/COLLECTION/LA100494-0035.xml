   <TEXT> Willie and Xenia Miles have lived across from the White_House for six months now . When drug_addicts overran the abandoned house they had squatted in , the fast-food cook and his pregnant wife took_up residence under a flowering magnolia in historic Lafayette Park . &quot; The shelters would have split us up . Besides , stealing in most of them is something terrible , &quot; Willie Miles said as they shared a cola crackers for breakfast . Sleeping on coarse gray blankets , their belongings in plastic bags beside the tree , the Mileses said they feel less vulnerable in the open . In the capital of the world ' s most powerful nation , pockets of homelessness are now pervasive . The Mileses are among about 50 people who sleep on the park ' s benches and under its maples , willows and magnolias , according to the National_Park_Service . Hundreds more sleep around the Washington and Lincoln monuments , in the shadow of the Capitol and on the warming sidewalk grates outside the departments_of_Justice , Commerce and State . Somewhere between 7 # 500 and 10 # 000 people are homeless in Washington -- up from about 400 two decades ago , community groups report . About a third sleep_in the open year-round . But Washington is not unique . From Stockholm and Sydney to Tokyo and Toronto , the capitals and commercial centers of virtually every wealthy , industrialized country have experienced an unprecedented surge in homelessness since the late 1980s . Along with hunger , homelessness is now one of the two main social problems of the West , a trend all_the more damning because the resources are available to prevent it , economists contend . Instead , many homeless in the wealthy nations of Europe , North_America , Japan and Australia live as roughly as their Third_World counterparts . And in the industrialized states of Eastern Europe , the new capitalism has put hundreds of thousands on the streets . &quot; The most extreme manifestation of the marginality and social exclusion in the midst of affluence and economic_growth is the phenomenon of homelessness , which is found to exist to differing degrees in all developed countries and is growing at worrying rates , &quot; warns an upcoming report by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development , whose members are 24 of the world ' s wealthiest nations . Once limited to a tiny fringe of society , the homeless have reached staggering numbers at the end of the 20th Century . Among the European Union ' s 12 member-states , at least 2.5 million people are homeless , and the total probably exceeds 5 million , reports the European Federation of National Organizations Working with the Homeless . In the United States , the number of &quot; absolute homeless &quot; is conservatively estimated at 600 # 000 at any given time , with as_many as 7 million homeless over any five-year period , reports Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros . The homeless are now visible throughout the developed world -- around the heating vents of shopping_malls in chilly Canada , in the subterranean world of the Paris Metro , under Budapest ' s bridges and in Warsaw ' s parks , in cardboard boxes close by the glass-and-concrete high-rises of Tokyo ' s financial_center , and near abandoned factories in Sydney and Melbourne . The story is not , however , just in the growing numbers and haunting conditions . As Willie and Xenia Miles indicate , the profile of the homeless is rapidly changing . Once largely alcoholics , drug_addicts or mentally impaired , the legions of the homeless are increasingly women and children , even whole families . Up to a third have jobs but cannot afford shelter , experts say . And the average age is declining . In Europe , as_many as 70 % of the homeless are younger than 20 . In Canada , where homelessness has doubled in 10 years , 25 % of the quarter of a_million homeless are children , the National Anti-Poverty Organization in Ottawa claims . &quot; In the past , there was a pool of itinerant cheap labor that was variously called hobos , drifters or vagrants . It was perceived to remain homeless by_choice , &quot; the OECD report says . &quot; The current homeless , which do not fit this stereotype , are heterogeneous , consisting_of a number of groups who , unable to operate at the margins of the economic , social and residential life of the city , become victims of ' the new poverty. ' &quot; Willie Miles , who recently got a job at a fried chicken restaurant , is a case_in_point . Paid minimum_wage , he says it will be a long_time before he can afford the first and last month ' s rent , plus security_deposit , for rental housing . Until they have enough , the Mileses say , they ' ll stay in Lafayette Park . The &quot; new poverty &quot; has multiple causes . &quot; The current crisis is_due to policies that ignored or misdiagnosed changes in housing affordability , the adverse impact of economic shifts around the world , increased drug use and the rising cost of health_care , &quot; said Marsha Martin , executive_director of Washington ' s Interagency Council on the Homeless . &quot; Add to that changes in family structures and the breakdown in traditional social institutions . Meanwhile , community groups , charities and churches are strapped for money . They can no longer deal with the same numbers , much less with more. &quot; Problem 1 : Housing Squeeze Europe illustrates the first problem of supply and demand . Homelessness has soared as governments move away from subsidized housing and other social_welfare benefits . Germany , with over a_million , has the most homeless in Europe , followed by Britain ' s 700 # 000 and France ' s 600 # 000 . Because of tighter budgets , public housing construction in Britain fell from 180 # 000 units in 1975 to less than 20 # 000 in 1992 . And the private sector has not made_up the difference . The result is a growing shortage of affordable housing . &quot; Anyone who hasn ' t been here in five years would be shocked at the increase in homelessness , &quot; said Katrina Dunbar , spokeswoman for Shelter , Britain ' s main lobbying group for the homeless . &quot; The government is so embarrassed that it recently spent money for hostels to get people off London streets so tourism won ' t be affected . . . . Tuberculosis has come_back in this country , first among the homeless. &quot; Some of London ' s homeless live no better than they did_in the 19th-Century days of Charles Dickens ' &quot; Oliver Twist , &quot; when survival depended_on begging bowls , back-alley squatting and charity soup_kitchens . Although an increasingly large body of people , the homeless have few political advocates . Like the growing number of panhandlers on the streets of wealthy countries , homelessness is an issue the public and the policy-makers often prefer to ignore , experts say . Problem 2 : Uneven Wealth Canada reflects the second problem : national wealth not trickling down to adequately cover society ' s poorest . This year , the United Nations reported that Canada has the world ' s highest standard_of_living . But better economic times have not helped the homeless . In Canada and throughout the industrialized West , the social_contract between the state and the people is being redefined as key benefits are eliminated . &quot; We have a bizarre economic situation where growth has not been combined with a lot more jobs , &quot; said Francois Dumain , assistant director of Canada ' s National Anti-Poverty Program . He cited a Canadian oil_company that recently announced a record profit -- and a simultaneous layoff of 500 employees to maintain that trend . &quot; That says a lot about the future we face . The goal is performance without social values , &quot; Dumain added . &quot; We face the same pattern as the United States . In many cases , those laid_off because of cutbacks are forced to take poorly paid part-time jobs. &quot; At the same time , social programs the poor once fell_back on -- welfare , unemployment insurance , health and family benefits -- have been cut . So more people are falling_through the safety net and ending_up on the streets . Problem 3 : Social Malaise Australia symbolizes a third and broader problem : social problems making the young , from tots to teen-agers , increasingly vulnerable . Sparsely populated Australia has 20 # 000 homeless under age 24 on the streets , according to Leith Greenslade , an official of the Ministry of Housing . The three major causes include changing family structures , such_as single-parent families ; violent environments or physical abuse , and inability to make_it on_their_own . Among Australians aged 18 to 24 , unemployment is 20 % , double the national rate . Worldwide , up_to 100 million children are homeless , depending_on the definition , the World_Health_Organization says . Homeless children are so abundant they have nicknames , such_as scugnizzi or &quot; spinning_tops &quot; in Italy and bomzh , the acronym for &quot; no fixed abode , &quot; in Russia . The young also have the hardest_time re-integrating . &quot; The dropout rate from school is high , and many are drawn to drug or alcohol_abuse , glue sniffing , prostitution or even suicide . Many runaways , or ' throwaways , ' tire of moving from one foster group to another and are distrustful of public institutions . They adopt a transient lifestyle and have no opportunities to learn basic skills , &quot; the OECD report notes . Problem 4 : Communism ' s End Eastern Europe illustrates the fourth and newest cause of homelessness in industrialized nations : the end of communism . Since the Soviet Empire ' s demise in 1991 , up_to 60 # 000 have become homeless in Moscow alone because of new poverty , no new housing and the absence of a permit required to live_in the Russian_capital . Within a year , so many took refuge in Moscow ' s biggest train_station that foreign doctors set_up a clinic there . President Boris N . Yeltsin subsequently signed a decree making homelessness a crime , reviving a Communist law . But the shelters he ordered built to house the homeless have yet to materialize . Eastern Europe also faces a potentially explosive increase in homelessness . In Hungary , more_than 4 million people live_in substandard housing , frequently without running water or electricity , for which Hungarians pay_up to three-quarters of their income in rent . &quot; Begin with a situation in which it ' s common to find three generations sharing 500 square_feet in old , neglected buildings owned by the state . Then factor_in a complete change in the patterns of work and a lot of unemployment -- and that nothing is guaranteed any more , &quot; said Kalman Lorincz , director of Hungary ' s new Habitat for Humanity office . &quot; We have private construction firms , but when you need 150 % collateral for a mortgage and you pay_up to 30 % interest , who has the money to build ? This is fairly typical in all Eastern Europe . Four years is not enough to learn what to do with freedom. &quot; In Poland , the symbols of the new capitalism are also often the symbols of the new homelessness . Many without shelter sleep and beg among the newly privatized restaurants and chic shops . Poland has a chronic &quot; under-housing &quot; crisis , with a_million fewer units than it needs for a population of 38 million people , the U.S. Agency for International Development reports . The waiting list for apartments is years , even decades , long . Young couples may have to live well into their 40s with parents ; some can only hope to have their own place by inheriting it . Poland also suffers from post-Communist &quot; pauperization , &quot; according to Adam Krol , chairman of Poland ' s Habitat for Humanity . The new paupers in Eastern Europe have lost jobs as state industries are privatized , streamlined or go bankrupt in new capitalist_economies . In rural villages , others have been forced to abandon farming because state markets and subsidies are no longer guaranteed . And old people , after a lifetime of work , are finding their pensions almost worthless in the post-socialist economies . Yet the reality is that in both East and West , homelessness should not be a major problem . In virtually every city in the developed world , vacancy_rates are high enough to accommodate all those who are without shelter -- usually many times over , according to Steve Mayo , a World_Bank expert . In U.S. cities , the vacancy_rate is about 7 % , while &quot; absolute homelessness &quot; is less than 1 % . The problem is that even shabby housing is increasingly unaffordable . &quot; Very often in the United States , the poor are spending 40 % or 50 % of their incomes on rent for something not necessarily safe . Given other demands on limited budgets , many can ' t or choose not to spend the money on housing , &quot; Mayo added . Historically , policy on homelessness in the wealthy West was characterized by the stick of vagrancy laws and the carrot of charity . Either way , the homeless were usually marginalized ; prospects for re-integrating into society were limited . &quot; The single most common pattern within the European Union is to treat homelessness as a condition to be avoided for the sake of the public good rather than in terms of individual rights , &quot; reports the 1994 survey of FEANTSA , the European federation dealing with the problem . Belgium still penalizes vagrancy based on an 1891 law , while Luxembourg homeless face a Catch-22 : a shortage of subsidized housing makes_it inaccessible to the homeless . Yet without an address , applicants often can ' t qualify for minimum welfare . In Japan , where the problem first appeared in 1989 , police patrols daily destroy makeshift homes of the more_than 2 # 000 homeless in Tokyo , Osaka and Yokohama . Some Solutions Homelessness is proving a stubborn problem . Nevertheless , a_few governments and private groups have launched initiatives : * Denmark has an early_warning_system , whereby social_service agencies must be notified before a family with_children is evicted . Municipal authorities are also are empowered to take_over every fourth apartment that becomes vacant . * France has codified the rights of people to housing . And 1990 legislation mandated three types of help for the destitute , including a minimum income , training and housing . * In British_Columbia , community groups founded ASK , or Assn . for Street Kids , to provide housing referrals , training and counseling . Many in turn helped work with their peers still on the streets . U.S.-based Habitat for Humanity organizes volunteers to work with the needy , who put_in hours of &quot; sweat equity &quot; on their homes and others as collateral . At least 30 # 000 homes have been built_in 42 countries since 1976 . * The 1994 National Teacher of the Year , Sandra McBrayer , was selected for her work with homeless children in San Diego , where up_to 1 # 500 children live_on city streets . McBrayer founded an outreach school in a storefront in 1988 . With a staff of 12 and a van that picks_up children on strategic street_corners , the school now serves_up to 400 students aged 12 to 19 a year . But for the most original solutions to homelessness , the First World may learn most from the Third_World , experts say . &quot; Within the housing world , we ' ve come_to recognize survival strategies of the south will be very useful in the north , &quot; said Ruth McLeod , executive_director of Homeless International in England . &quot; When people can ' t get formal housing in Nairobi , for example , they squat or build illegally . There ' s a growing recognition that that kind of housing has to be tolerated . Because the private sector and governments are unable to provide adequate housing , creativity and energy of people needs to be supported as homelessness becomes a bigger issue everywhere. &quot; Among Third_World concepts being explored is &quot; planned squatting , &quot; or laying_out land for people to squat in an organized way so , when resources are available , utilities and services can be added or upgraded . Over time , outlying squatters areas can then be developed_into proper suburbs -- a common approach now in Brazil , planners say . Another idea is &quot; land sharing , &quot; a practice worked_out between landowners and squatters in Bangkok . Owners install sanitation and other facilities on part of the land in exchange for squatters moving off front areas so they can be developed for commercial use -- a concept now being explored by European housing groups . A third idea helps create new funding for the homeless without collateral for loans . In India and Bangladesh , &quot; women ' s savings groups &quot; pool resources and lend money to each other at low interest_rates . &quot; I recently took some British housing executives to India to show how it worked , &quot; said McLeod , the_British homeless official . &quot; An executive from Cambridge said it was a model to use in his area , as he knows families paying loan_sharks 300 % interest a year because they have no access to the_British banking system. &quot; Getting Organized Meanwhile , the homeless are also mobilizing worldwide to help themselves . The &quot; Squatters ' Rights Handbook &quot; was published in London in 1987 for homeless who have found shelter in abandoned facilities . South_Africa ' s People ' s Dialogue on Land and Shelter , which groups 130 grass-roots organizations , has conducted exchanges with the National Slumdwellers of India . In Washington , the largest shelter is the John L . Young Center . The government provided the building , and the city pays utilities . But it is staffed by the homeless and it nightly puts_up 1 # 400 men , women and children . Keith Mitchell , a director , became the first homeless_person to win a local election . This fall , he is running to be Washington ' s shadow representative to Congress . &quot; They ' re part of the new idea that people should take power over their own lives and homesteads . Instead of seeing them as desperate and living wherever they can , they ' re seen as taking action on_their_own and forming their own tenants groups and trying to put a semblance of order to a disorderly issue -- an idea borrowed from the developing world , &quot; said Irene Glasser , American author of &quot; Homelessness in Global Perspective. &quot; &quot; The new theory tries to give the problem a positive cast : They ' re not squatters . They ' re part of spontaneous developments . Give them a chance and you ' ll see they will better their lives. &quot; Times librarian Pat Welch contributed to this article . Down and Out Poor countries and wealthy countries have the most homeless , with middle-income countries having the least , one survey based on gross_national_product shows . * Median homeless rate per 1 # 000 people ; countries grouped by per-capita GNP : Low ( GNP $ 320 ) : 2.69 Low Middle ( $ 740 ) : 0.63 Middle ( $ 1 # 710 ) : 0.93 High Middle ( $ 5 # 695 ) : 0.24 High ( $ 21 # 130 ) : 2.81 * Country income groups : LOW Examples : China , South Asia , Sub-Saharan Africa LOW MIDDLE : Examples : Egypt , Indonesia , Philippines MIDDLE : Examples : Chile , Poland , Tunisia HIGH MIDDLE : Examples : Brazil , Greece , South_Korea HIGH : Examples : Australia , North_America , Western Europe SOURCE : World_Bank , Housing Indicators Program , 1990 . Figures based on surveys of 53 cities , mostly national_capitals . Counting the Homeless * Who are they ? Homelessness comes_in many categories . Absolute homelessness -- People without their own addresses , phones or paychecks . Sheltered homeless -- A much larger category that includes those put_up in government shelters or charity hostels . Hidden homeless -- An even larger category that includes people forced_out of housing who move_in with friends , several generations living_in a facility built for a single family and women who find temporary alternatives after fleeing abusive homes with their children . Shadow housing -- Basically , squatters who move_into abandoned homes . They are increasing in the developed world , sometimes setting_up underground management that taps into local electricity lines and even rents apartments . -- ROBIN WRIGHT * Homeless children Worldwide estimates range from 10 million to 100 million .

' -- Henry Cisneros , U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development * &quot; Homelessness and hunger are the two most palpable indications of poverty , as well as the clearest indications of society ' s inability to care even minimally for its most vulnerable. &quot; -- Irene Glasser in &quot; Homelessness in Global Perspective &quot; * &quot; On homelessness , there is no fundamental difference between the North and the South .
