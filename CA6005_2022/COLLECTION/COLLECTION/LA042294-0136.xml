   <HEADLINE> WAY CLEARED FOR HATA TO BECOME JAPAN PREMIER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Deputies of Japan ' s tattered eight-party coalition finally paved the way early today for Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata ' s election as prime_minister by approving a 10-point platform , but not before they again reached the brink of a breakup . Party leaders said they will meet this afternoon and give final approval to both the policy accord and the choice of Hata , 58 , the mild-mannered leader who helped launch a rebellion ending 38 years of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party last summer . It was not officially decided when Parliament ' s lower house will elect him prime_minister , but the balloting is expected to take_place Monday , 17 days after Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced that he was resigning over accusations of personal corruption . Hata was expected to head a shaky -- and possibly short-lived -- administration that could face its first crisis as early as June . Coalition deputies completed the platform at 1:17 a.m. today after a series of six meetings punctuated by threats from the Socialist_Party to leave the coalition and counter-threats to form a government without them . Hata , who has kept silent on policy during all_the machinations that followed Hosokawa ' s resignation announcement , remained optimistic throughout the day of tensions . &quot; A difficult birth requires pain , &quot; he said . On the surface , the agreement provides a Hata-led government with a policy consensus that Hosokawa ' s government lacked . It commits the new government to decreasing government regulation ; dispersing the central government powers ; opening Japan ' s markets to foreign trade ; eliminating price differences in products sold in Japan and abroad ; promoting economic demand at_home to pull_in imports , and reducing &quot; in stages &quot; Japan ' s trade surpluses . But the agreement was achieved only by six of the coalition partners , and that immediately raised the likelihood that the Hata government might run_into a wall even faster than the 8-month-old Hosokawa Cabinet . In addition , the eighth party in the coalition , Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura ' s New Party Harbinger , boycotted the platform talks and said it would not be bound by the policies . The party had announced earlier that it would not accept any posts in the new Cabinet . It has affirmed , however , that it will vote for Hata and remain in the coalition . With the coalition ' s numbers in Parliament , refusal by either the Socialists or the New Party Harbinger to support a bill would block its passage in the lower house . Minoru Morita , a noted political commentator , said the final coalition platform did not truly represent the Socialists ' beliefs . He predicted that an explosion over two crucial issues -- taxes and North_Korea -- could precipitate a crisis for Hata ' s government as early as June . The 13 1 / 2-hour dispute , capping seven days of policy talks , focused_on 10 words in planks dealing with those two points . Both issues are of major concern to the United States . The Socialists , the largest party in the coalition , offered a major concession by agreeing to support a future increase in indirect_taxes . Ever since 1989 , when Socialist opposition to enactment of a consumption tax sparked the party ' s best-ever showing in an election , the party has resisted any move to raise indirect_taxes . But Ichiro Ozawa , the coalition ' s chief strategist and Hata ' s deputy in the Japan Renewal Party , balked at an attached demand that &quot; the people ' s agreement &quot; be sought in the process . After an earlier agreement over how the new coalition would deal with &quot; an emergency on the Korean_Peninsula &quot; that might arise from North_Korea ' s refusal to accept international inspection of its nuclear facilities , the Socialists posed a new demand on the issue . Like China , one of the North_Korean regime ' s few allies , the Socialists had maintained close relations with North_Korea throughout the Cold_War . They now demanded that Japan act only &quot; in solidarity with China &quot; in the event of a crisis over North_Korea . Ozawa rejected the demand , saying it would tie Japan ' s policy to decisions in Beijing . At that point , Koken Nozaka , chairman of the Socialists ' lower house steering_committee , declared that his party would not negotiate these two issues . If Ozawa and others refused to accept them , he added , &quot; we will quit the ( policy ) talks . . . . After that , the question will be whether we remain in the coalition or not. &quot; Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa , secretary_general of the Buddhist-backed Komei ( Clean Government ) Party , countered with threats to form a new Cabinet without the Socialists . After trade_union leaders rushed to Socialist headquarters to urge that the party remain in the coalition , its leaders backed_down . In a compromise , they accepted language about seeking &quot; the people ' s understanding &quot; -- rather than &quot; agreement &quot; -- about raising indirect_taxes , and they dropped their demand for &quot; solidarity with China &quot; in dealing with North_Korea . A future increase in indirect_taxes is considered essential to finance a three-year income_tax cut beginning this year . A two-year extension of this year ' s income_tax cut -- a major U.S. demand -- is expected to be a pillar of the government ' s plan to open markets , lessen its own control of the economy and stimulate private spending . The plan is expected to be how Japan proposes to keep its promise of a &quot; substantial reduction &quot; in its $ 141-billion global trade surplus and its $ 60 billion worth of black ink in trade with the United States . Hata will inherit Hosokawa ' s promise to present the new package to President Clinton when they meet at a summit of advanced industrial democracies in Naples , Italy , in July . On North_Korea , the coalition agreed to &quot; obey &quot; any U.N. sanctions that might be imposed against North_Korea . But the platform failed to spell_out whether Japan is willing to revise its laws to permit its own troops to assist and provide supplies to U.S. military_forces that might blockade North_Korea .</TEXT>
