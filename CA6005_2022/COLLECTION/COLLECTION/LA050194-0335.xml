   <HEADLINE> U.S. DELAYS TRADE SANCTIONS ON CHINA ; DIPLOMACY : ADMINISTRATION GIVES BEIJING 60 DAYS TO ADDRESS PIRACY OF FILMS , MUSIC AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE . AIM IS TO AVOID COMPLICATING HUMAN_RIGHTS DISPUTE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration backed_away Saturday from citing China for pirating American movies , music and computer software after top officials decided in a flurry of meetings and phone_calls that launching a new trade action could complicate already touchy relations with Beijing . &quot; We ' re in a very delicate time in terms of our engagement with China , &quot; U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters . &quot; My thinking about China was affected by the fact that the period between now and June 3 is critical for the relations between our two countries , &quot; he added , referring to the upcoming deadline on a separate matter : the U.S. renewal of Beijing ' s preferential trade status , a decision that will hinge_on China ' s human_rights record . On the piracy issue , instead of acting now against China , Kantor said , the Administration will give the Beijing government at least 60 days before starting the process of imposing trade sanctions . The announcement came only hours before a midnight Saturday deadline set by Congress for listing countries that have violated U.S. copyright laws . In addition to China , Kantor identified Argentina and India as leading violators of American copyrights and intellectual property_rights . But he delayed action against these two countries too , primarily on grounds that they appear to be making progress in addressing the problem . The justification for delaying action against China was based not on signs of progress , but on the sensitivity of U.S. relations with the world ' s most populous country . American film , software and music industry trade groups have complained that China ' s commercial piracy of their wares costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year . U.S. investigators have identified a series of factories in Shenzhen , a Chinese &quot; special economic zone &quot; alongside Hong Kong , that churn_out millions of copies of compact_discs and laser discs featuring such American stars as Madonna and Whitney Houston . The pirated copies are sold not just in China but in Hong Kong and many other Asian capitals . Some industry representatives reacted sharply to the Administration ' s decision . China &quot; has made little or no effort to take its immense piracy problem seriously , &quot; said Eric H . Smith , executive_director of the International Intellectual Property Alliance , representing the recording and computer software industries . &quot; This is a mere postponement of the inevitable , and we fear it will send the wrong signal -- that the U.S. statutory deadlines remain flexible. &quot; Kantor noted that one objective of the delay is to keep the piracy issue separate from the more fundamental question of whether the United States should renew China ' s trade privileges . &quot; We looked_at the broader picture , &quot; he said . Under U.S. law , the President must decide by June 3 whether to extend China ' s most-favored-nation ( MFN ) trade benefits , under which Chinese goods are exported to this country with the same low tariff rates enjoyed by almost all other countries . Last year , Clinton signed an executive order calling_upon China to make &quot; overall significant progress &quot; on human_rights issues before its benefits are renewed . China has reacted furiously to the order , saying it will never tailor its domestic policies in response to pressure from another nation . Kantor also announced a two-month postponement of any U.S. trade action against Japan for discriminating against American medical and telecommunications_equipment in its government procurement practices . He cited the current political situation in Tokyo , where Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata is organizing a new government . &quot; Obviously , he ( Hata ) has been somewhat distracted , as we all know , &quot; Kantor said . The decision on Japan was not as surprising as the one on China . As late as midmorning Saturday , several U.S. officials believed a decision had already been reached to go_ahead with the new piracy action against Beijing . But Kantor later announced that the Administration had decided upon a postponement during a series of morning conference_calls among top-level officials . He said the piracy question had been fully reviewed &quot; at the highest levels &quot; of the Administration . &quot; The President is fully aware of and was obviously involved in the decision , &quot; he said . The postponement is an indication of how the continuing U.S. dispute with China over human_rights issues and MFN benefits is beginning to affect other policy areas . The Administration is apparently taking extra steps to avoid additional conflicts with China because of the fear that the human_rights dispute alone could jeopardize ties with Beijing . Earlier this spring , the United States ducked an environmental policy conflict with Beijing over the sale in China of rhinoceros horn , a common pharmaceutical and supposed aphrodisiac . In the end , the United States decided to retaliate against Taiwan for selling rhinoceros horn , but not against China . Asked later to explain the distinction that was made , one U.S. environmental official responded , &quot; 1.08 billion people &quot; -- a reference_to the fact that China has a population of 1.1 billion while Taiwan has only 20 million . Under U.S. law , the trade representative has the power to cite &quot; priority foreign countries &quot; for violating American copyrights and other intellectual property_rights . If this occurs , the United States must launch an immediate investigation and start the process of deciding whether there should be retaliation against that country ' s exports to the United States . U.S. officials have repeatedly complained that China has laws against piracy on the books but is not enforcing them . Recently , a Chinese vice premier reportedly picked_up the phone from Beijing to call authorities in south China ' s Guangdong province . Within hours , police in that province staged a series of raids against factories producing pirated goods .</TEXT>
