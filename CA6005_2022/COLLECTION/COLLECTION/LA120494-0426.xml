   <HEADLINE> SEASON ' S READINGS ; THE CALL OF DUTY ; SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS MOVE FROM CONFLICT TO CONFLICT . OTHERS ARE THERE FOR THE LONG_HAUL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are endless opportunities for photojournalists to document man ' s ongoing inhumanity to man , from Haiti to Bosnia to the Persian_Gulf or the West_Bank . One must wonder if the world is becoming so inured to violence -- on our city ' s streets or in villages throughout the third_world -- that searing images which should stop us in our tracks fail to penetrate our bombarded senses . Yet photographers will , and must , continue to shoot these pictures , hoping that their images will somehow change the world . Witness James Nachtwey ' s continuing documentation of the world ' s conflicts , Gilles Peress ' ongoing chronicle of ethnic and religious war with his latest book on the violence in Sarajevo . And last year , Annie Liebovitz , the darling of Vanity_Fair and vanity portraits , found herself shooting black_and_white in the former Yugoslavia . Weighing in with two hefty and ambitious volumes , Phaidon Press presents their latest contribution to the history of the world ' s conflicts : Allah O Akbar : A Journey Through Militant Islam by Magnum photographer Abbas , and Humanity and Inhumanity : The Photographic Journey of George Rodger , another Magnum photographer and one of that cooperative ' s founding members . A third book represents , on a much smaller scale , another focused effort to bring attention to an ongoing struggle : the plight of the Kurds . When the Borders Bleed : The Struggle of the Kurds , is a collection of color images by Ed Kashi , with Christopher Hitchens providing a written narrative chronicling abuses throughout the history of the Kurds , complete with a timeline providing historical context for these images . The Phaidon volumes , containing over 200 images and at least 300 pages , will no doubt end_up on coffee_tables , since once you get them to your coffee_table you won ' t want to lift them again . The black-and-white photographs , refreshing in today ' s world of color images , are rich and gorgeously reproduced on luxurious stock that seems to give the books even more weight . Rodgers got his start during the blitz of London and documented World_War_II through its end with the liberation of Belsen concentration_camp . After witnessing the aftermath of Nazi atrocities there , he vowed never to photograph another war and spent the rest of his career traveling through Africa and the world , living with and documenting other cultures . The images in this book that were taken at Belsen are the most powerful in the collection . We see a young boy out for a walk , strolling past rows and rows of bodies lying_in heaps , collapsed , it seems , haphazardly as if they simply lost the strength to go_on . The enormity of this tragedy still boggles the mind , in part because conflict , violence , racism and ethnic wars still rage throughout the world . It is as if we have learned nothing as history marches on . Rodgers ' book chronicles his life of social conscience and adventure while shooting and traveling for Life magazine in 1940 . Rodgers never achieved the celebrity of his colleagues Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson , but he was among those early pioneers of war photography , in the days when it was a lonely job . The streets of London during the Blitz were far different from the streets of Haiti during our last invasion , where for every shot fired there were legions of photographers . Rodgers was alone in London ' s bomb_shelters and bombed-out buildings to record the terror and how it affected the lives of Londoners . His images are less well-known and lack the poetry and elevation of the ordinary that Cartier-Bresson ' s work exudes , there are some memorable , essential images of war in this book . It is almost a textbook on the roots of photojournalism . The book is interspersed with entries from Rodgers ' diaries , and they are written with humility and humor . His dedication is daunting , his commitment to his craft admirable . Like Rodger , Abbas is not interested in the quick hit . Unlike so many photojournalists who flit from conflict to conflict , he devoted seven years to this volume . He uses his knowledge as an Iranian transplanted to the West to bridge the gap between these two cultures , to open the Western mind to the breadth and diversity of militant Islam. &quot; Driven , &quot; says Abbas in the book ' s introduction , &quot; by a desire to understand and expose the internal tensions within Muslim societies , &quot; his book attempts to humanize and document the world of militant Islam . Abbas spent the seven years traveling_to 29 countries on four continents . Some of these images are beautiful for the sweep of the crowd , the sheer numbers of people , some heart-stopping for their sadness , sorrow or devotion . There is the solitary Muslim praying inside a textile_mill in Bradford , England and a page full of veiled women at Friday prayer in Jakarta , Java . In an affecting contrast , one page juxtaposes women in Kashmir mourning and wailing over the death of a loved one , and a young Kashmiri peering from his hospital_bed , his eyes wide with fear and worry . Abbas has written affectingly in the first_person about his travels through the Islamic world , and for those who wish to understand the passion , pain and enormity of Islam , this is a good place to start . &quot; When the Borders Bleed &quot; by Ed Kashi is a more modest attempt to educate through photography . Obviously inspired by the ongoing struggle of the Kurds , Kashi documents the war victims , the refugees , the transplanted . Along with narrative by Christopher Hitchens , which includes a history and timeline of their long suffering , it includes some powerful work directed at a very narrow audience . These three photographers , to their credit , were not interested in the sexy story . These three weren ' t searching for celebrity but answering to a higher calling , truly trying to inform and educate . ALLAH O AKBAR : A Journey Through Militant Islam , by Abbas ( Phaidon / Chronicle Books : $ 60 ; 320 pp. ) HUMANITY AND INHUMANITY : The Photographic Journey of George Rodger , ( Phaidon / Chronicle Books : $ 16.95 ; 176 pp. ) WHEN THE BORDERS BLEED : The Struggle of the Kurds , by Ed Kashi with Christopher Hitchens ( Pantheon : $ 40 ; 140 pp. )</TEXT>
