   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : QUARTERFINALS ; COMMENTARY ; IF YOU ' RE NOT A ONE-NAME HERE , YOU ' RE A NO-NAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a thoroughly L.A. move , most Brazilian soccer players are known simply by a single name . This is the height of Hollywood hip . The Brazilians , indeed , look cool , play cool , dress cool , talk cool , sweat cool . They were grunge before grunge , funky dunky before Funky Dunky . And the Brazilians understand that , when you ' re really big here , you need only one name . Madonna . Cristophe . Cher . Sometimes you have a full name , but you reach that status in which folks just refer to you by your first_name . Magic . Mark &amp; Brian . Fritz . ( Ugh ! ) Also , at the highest levels of Hollywood business , superstars at their peak routinely are just called by their first_names ( Eddie , Arsenio ) , then , once in free fall , these same icons are referred to by their full names ( Eddie Murphy , Arsenio Hall ) . Of course , in this town , Jack will always be Jack . Seventeen of the 22 Brazilian World Cup members go_by a single name : Jorginho . Aldair . Leonardo . Mazinho . Dunga . Zinho . Bebeto . Romario . Cafu . Zetti . Gilmer . Branco . Rai . Muller . Ronaldo ( I ) , Ronaldo ( II ) . Viola . ( Curiously , the players all must answer to one Carlos Alberto Parreira , but then again , they probably just call him Coach. ) In fact , the most famous athlete of his time was a Brazilian -- Edson Arantes do Nascimento , better known as Pele , whom many Americans credit with starting the single-name boom . Nonsense . There was Jesus . Judas , for that matter . Elvis . Adam &amp; Eve , Abraham , Cain &amp; Abel , Jezebel , Samson &amp; Delilah , Job , Jacob , David , Goliath . Nebuchadnezzar ! Satan , Lucifer , Mephistopheles , Roseanne . Do you think anyone would remember Noah ' s Ark if it were Noah Chomsky ' s Ark ? ( Heck , it was so_much easier to use directory assistance back then . You dial 411 . &quot; This is Esther . What city , please ? &quot; &quot; Yes , can I have a listing in Canaan for Moses ? &quot; ) Ajax , Aphrodite , Hercules , Zeus . ( Hey , don ' t get me started on the Greek gods. ) Socrates , Aristotle , Plato ; Fonzie , Potsie , Chachi . ( Actually , this single-name notion is as much a part of the Los Angeles and Las Vegas entertainment worlds as any other institutions : L.A. , because television and film lend themselves to characters easily recognized by just one word ; Las Vegas , because when you ' re putting a headline act ' s name up_on a marquee in cazillion-point type , SIEGFRIED &amp; ROY fits a lot easier than SIEGFRIED FISCHBACKER AND ROY HORN. ) Euclid , Archimedes . Quincy , M.E. ; Magnum , P.I. Columbo , MacGyver , Spenser . Honorable_mentions to Mannix , Kojak , Baretta , Cannon , Banacek , Eischeid , Hunter , Ironside , Longstreet , Starsky &amp; Hutch and Cagney &amp; Lacey , all_of whom had first_names used about twice a season ( or after every 15th crime committed ) . Charlie from &quot; Charlie ' s Angels. &quot; Sinbad , Gallagher , Bozo . Dracula , Frankenstein , Lurch . Aesop , Sophocles , Raphael , Moliere ; Beavis , Butt-head . Nostradamus , Kreskin . Popeye , Sulu . ( Let ' s go_back to the Pele thing for a second . It is fairly common in Portuguese to be identified by one name . &quot; Yes , it is used overwhelmingly in soccer , &quot; said Francisco Marcos , the Brazilian team liaison , &quot; but it is something as much a part of Brazilian culture as it is soccer . Sometimes it ' s just the diminutive version of your first_name ; sometimes it has nothing to do with your own name , just that you look_like somebody else . Pele was by no means the first , he was simply the most famous. &quot; ) Zero , Zorro , Zsa Zsa , Zamfir . Tito , Titian , Tiny Tim . Attila , Godzilla , Rush ; Napoleon , Mao , Dave . William the Conqueror , Carlton the Doorman . ( Historical note on William : As a boy , he was known as Billy ; then , as a young_man , as Bill . After becoming king_of_England , he switched to William . And after the Norman_Conquest , his spin_doctors suggested he make_it William the Conqueror in_order to discourage rebellions and to generate some heat , media-wise . Behind his back , he often was called , &quot; Bully. &quot; ) Blondie , Prince , Enya , Sade , Seal , Slash , Sting . Hazel , Benson , Alice , Beulah , Rochester , Eldin , Hop Sing . Lassie , Benji , Marmaduke , McGruff , Snoopy , Astro , Checkers . Flipper , Alf , Thing . ( Actually , there has been a reverse trend recently in Hollywood in which vainglorious TV producers , in_order to confer themselves a greater artistic status , have taken_to using their middle names as part of their noms de plume . Guilty as charged : Gary David Goldberg , Paul Junger Witt and Glenn Gordon Caron. ) Sleepy , Dopey , Grumpy , Bashful , Doc , Happy , Sneezy ; Tattoo . Iago , Falstaff , Hamlet , MacBeth , Othello , Gallagher . ( Gotcha. ) Penn &amp; Teller , Amos ' n ' Andy , Laverne &amp; Shirley , Mork &amp; Mindy , Kate &amp; Allie , Bob and Ray , Ben &amp; Jerry . Musso &amp; Frank , Mujibur and Sirajul . Gilligan , Jeannie ; Mikey , Urkel . Superman , Shaft , Shane , Secretariat . Geraldo , Oprah , Cristina , Xuxa . ( These daytime talk-show hosts commonly become known by a single name . But it doesn ' t always take . You ' ll hear these promos , ' On the next &quot; Maury &quot; . . . Oh , no . Maury , my foot . He can try that Maury business all he wants , he ' s still Maury Povich , plain and simple , unless you just consider him Connie Chung ' s husband. ) Twiggy , Vendela , Iman , Fabio ; Cinderella , Rapunzel , Angelyne . Larry , Moe and Curley ; Manny , Moe and Jack . Babe , Sugar Ray , Wilt , Arnie , Reggie , Sugar Ray , Magic , Michael , Bo , Deion , Shaq . That Verne guy , Herb . Bogie , Olivier , Keanu . Willard ( the weatherman ) , Willard ( the rat man ) . Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice . Romeo and Juliet , Regis and Kathie Lee . ( Remember &quot; Bridget Loves Bernie ? &quot; In real_life , they had full names and divorce lawyers. ) Sybil , Roseanne . Groucho , Bijan , Garp , Lazarus , Tonto , Buddha , Boy George , Bullwinkle , Scrooge , Marilyn , Ivanhoe , Gallagher . ( that ' s the grab-bag group . And , yep , there ' s Gallagher again. ) Liberace . Incidentally , to change your name legally in Los Angeles County , the cost is $ 182 . This might seem pricey , but if your moniker happens to be Maria Rosario Pilar Martinez and you want it to be Charo , you gladly pay it . Betcha she ' s a soccer fan , too .</TEXT>
