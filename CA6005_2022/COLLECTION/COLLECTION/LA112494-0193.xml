   <HEADLINE> CHILD CITED AS PROP . 187 CASUALTY HAD LEUKEMIA ; IMMIGRATION : ANAHEIM BOY ALSO SUFFERED BACTERIAL INFECTION . HIS DEATH GAINS MORE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Julio Cano , the 12-year-old Anaheim boy whose parents said they delayed medical treatment because they were afraid of being deported , had acute_leukemia , coroner ' s officials revealed Wednesday . Preliminary tests also indicated the boy ' s body , in a weakened state because of the leukemia , might have been racked with a bacterial infection that led to heart_failure , law_enforcement sources working the case said . Medical experts say that acute_leukemia often can be successfully treated , even in its latter stages . Although it remained unclear to what degree emergency medical intervention might have helped the youngster , his death Saturday took_on weighty political implications as those on both sides of Proposition 187 , including Gov . Pete Wilson , reopened pre-election wounds with divisive comments . &quot; We will get all kinds of stories of that sort , I suppose , &quot; Wilson said in reply to a question about the boy ' s death during a live television interview Wednesday on &quot; Good_Morning America. &quot; But the governor said the burden that illegal immigrants place on medical services has deprived citizens from getting care they deserve . Latino leaders , meanwhile , said they might amend their lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 187 by citing the boy ' s death . &quot; This is a good case on which to make a plea that all children be exempt from all provisions of Proposition 187 , and make a plea directly to state_government , &quot; said Fabian Nunez , an Ontario-based activist who planned to meet with the family . Julio ' s parents , illegal immigrants from Mexico , say they were afraid to take the Sycamore Junior_High_School student to the hospital because they feared quizzing about their immigrant status . If it takes_effect -- the initiative faces multiple court challenges -- Proposition 187 would bar illegal immigrants from receiving education , health_care -- except in emergencies -- and most other public_services . It also would require teachers and administrators to report illegal immigrants . The family was shocked but responded guardedly after learning the preliminary autopsy results . &quot; We don ' t have any reaction . We have to wait for more results and see what our lawyer says , &quot; the father said . &quot; We didn ' t know it was leukemia . I still don ' t know . I don ' t know if someone is responsible_for this. &quot; A family friend expressed disbelief at the diagnosis , saying the family had no clue the boy had a terminal illness . &quot; The boy looked healthy , &quot; said Belinda Castro Palomino , a church_member who was acting_as the family ' s spokesperson . &quot; His mother doesn ' t believe that he had leukemia . They only took him to one doctor and he didn ' t diagnose any type of cancer. &quot; While Proposition 187 proponents suggested Wednesday that Julio ' s death was being exploited for political purposes , the account of Julio ' s days leading_up to his death Saturday , at a minimum , highlights the difficulty illegal immigrant parents face in deciding when to take a child to the hospital , and the plight facing the poor who have fewer options when it comes_to medical_care . After Julio fell ill Monday , Nov . 13 , Julio ' s father said he and his wife considered taking him to a hospital , but had been denied non-emergency care before . With the passage of Proposition 187 , they believed their immigrant status would be challenged , he said . The couple also was unaware that the provisions of Proposition 187 pertaining to education and medical_care had not taken_effect yet , they said . The father said he waited until Friday to take his son to the doctor because that is payday at the factory where he works and he needed $ 60 for an appointment at a nearby clinic . Initially , physician N . Radd Radparvar said he treated the boy for constipation and rectal pain . A general_practitioner , Radparvar said he administered a &quot; small enema &quot; and gave the boy an antibiotic -- Cephalexin -- and vitamins . He said he instructed the family to &quot; rush &quot; him to an emergency_room if the youngster ' s condition did not improve . Asked to elaborate Wednesday , Radparvar said he took a urine sample , which contained &quot; leukocytes and blood , &quot; signs that &quot; there is something wrong , possibly a kidney infection. &quot; Leukocytes are the white_cells in blood , lymph and tissue that help the body fight infection . &quot; The only positive clinical sign and symptom I had was that one , &quot; he said of the urine sample . The doctor said he told the family that they should seek further tests at a hospital . Radparvar said he didn ' t prescribe the medication , but gave it to the family because he knew they had little money . &quot; We did our best , &quot; he said . &quot; I am proud_of myself . They have more_than $ 30 in vitamins and antibiotics because I knew that the baby was really weak . &quot; What else could I do ? We did an enema . . . . I talked with him . When he left I asked him , ' How do you feel ? ' He left in better condition . What do you want ? &quot; The mother and father , they were grateful , &quot; Radparvar said . The father , however , said the doctor never told him what to monitor about his son ' s condition and never mentioned taking him to a hospital . After they brought the boy home Friday and gave him an antibiotic , the father said Julio was &quot; up all night going_to the bathroom. &quot; The next morning , when the father phoned home during a work break at 8:30 a.m. , the mother told him their son ' s condition had worsened . Shortly thereafter , the mother left the house to get Julio a drink at the store . When she returned , he could not speak . The mother contacted a neighbor , who promptly called 911 . Joe Gutierrez , an Anaheim Fire_Department captain and paramedic , said Julio wasn ' t breathing and had no heartbeat when firefighters arrived . After paramedics attempted unsuccessfully to revive him , the youngster was taken_to Anaheim Memorial Hospital where further attempts at resuscitation failed . He never took another breath , but Gutierrez said they tried to revive the boy at the hospital until roughly 10 a.m. In the aftermath of Julio ' s death , Los Amigos of Orange County , a Latino activist group , Wednesday urged Latinos throughout California to boycott work , school and merchants on Dec . 12 in protest of the initiative . Other activist groups began reviewing the case to determine whether it could serve as the backbone for a lawsuit asking that all children be excluded from Proposition 187 . John Palacio , the Orange County representative of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , said the organization ' s attorneys had spoken_to the family and planned to amend its class-action suit seeking a permanent injunction against Proposition 187 . &quot; We have a deadline of Monday to amend our class-action lawsuit . We currently have received the declaration from the family for inclusion in our lawsuit , &quot; he said . And at a meeting Wednesday , members of Los Amigos of Orange County clasped hands and bowed their heads in remembrance of Julio . &quot; We want to convey to the family that has lost this little boy that there are many people who care , &quot; said Galal Kernahan , who led a prayer . &quot; And we ask help for us to be open and appreciative of the differences of others. &quot; Amin David , president of Los Amigos , said a diagnosis of acute_leukemia possibly could have been made if the family had sought medical_care earlier . &quot; ' Could somebody have diagnosed that ? ' is a question that I ask , &quot; he said . &quot; We think that hospital tests would have brought it out. &quot; The disease takes two basic forms . One type , acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia , has a survival rate of about 70 % after five years , if treatment is provided . The other type , non-lymphoblastic leukemia , is more difficult to treat and has a 40 % to 50 % survival rate . Experts in childhood leukemia offered mixed views on whether the youngster could been saved . Dr. Alexis Thompson , an assistant_professor in pediatric hematology-oncology at the UCLA School_of_Medicine , said it would have depended_on which form of acute_leukemia the child had . She said a child with an aggressive infection could be overwhelmed before obtaining adequate chemotherapy . Dr. Stuart Siegel , head of the division of hematology-oncology at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles , said that even if the disease is diagnosed late , there often is a &quot; significant chance &quot; of treating the child successfully . Proposition 187 proponents denounced efforts to link the controversial immigration measure to the boy ' s death . They inveighed against Latino activists for what they say is exploiting a tragic situation for political ends . &quot; Of course , we are sad for the family , &quot; said Barbara Coe , a founding member of the Proposition 187 movement . &quot; But the anti-187 people will do whatever is necessary to get this measure defeated . &quot; It ' s incredibly deceitful. &quot; If anything , some leading Proposition 187 supporters reasoned that any responsibility lies_with Julio ' s parents or the foes of the measure . &quot; The parents are endangering the children by bringing them here illegally , ' said Ron S . Prince of Tustin , who headed the pro-187 &quot; Save Our State campaign . Addressing the subject during the national television interview , Gov . Wilson brushed_aside the Orange County case and said the ballot measure will ensure more medical services for legal residents of California . &quot; What we ' re also hearing from emergency_room physicians is that some felt that because of the tremendous burden placed upon them by illegal immigrants able to claim under the law certain emergency care , that they were compelled to cut_back on services to everyone , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; You have to say we are having to put our own needs first , &quot; the governor continued , &quot; . . . when you cannot provide services , when you ' re shortchanging the education of legal residents , the health_care of legal residents , because the federal_government has failed to do its job and then has compounded that failure by sticking the states with the cost. &quot; The boy ' s parents moved to Orange County from Acapulco four years ago . Julio and the couple ' s other older children , ages 13 and 11 , were born in Mexico and joined their parents here only three years ago . They are all undocumented , the father said . The couple ' s youngest children , age 1 month and 1 year , were born in the United States and are thus citizens . Even before the passage of Proposition 187 , the couple was unsure where to seek medical_care , they said . The three eldest children carry Medi-Cal cards ensuring only emergency and pregnancy-related services . Although the autopsy was conducted Sunday , coroner ' s officials are awaiting the results of further tests before issuing an official cause of death . One law_enforcement source working the case said it usually takes weeks to do the kinds of preliminary tests that were done_in a matter of days in Julio ' s case . But &quot; this was handled differently , &quot; the source said , because of the possible political ramifications . Felipe Soria Ayuso , the Mexican consul in Santa Ana , said the consulate is helping to arrange for Julio ' s remains to be flown to their native Acapulco , where they want to bury him . Times staff writers Paul Feldman and Julie Marquis contributed to this report . Acute_Leukemia : A Primer Leukemia is a form of cancer involving an abnormal proliferation of white_blood_cells in the bone_marrow . About 3 # 200 children develop acute_leukemia each year , accounting_for about 40 % of all new childhood cancer cases , according to Dr. Stuart Siegel , head of the division of hematology / oncology at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles . SYMPTOMS Acute_leukemia can be difficult to diagnose early because symptoms may develop late or may be similar to those of other , less serious conditions . Some symptoms : * Gum bleeding * Frequent bruising * Anemia * Paleness * Weight loss POSSIBLE CAUSES * Virus * Exposure to chemicals , such_as benzene ; also to cancer-fighting drugs that lower resistance * Exposure to high doses of radiation TREATMENTS * Blood_transfusions * Chemotherapy , involving a variety of anti-cancer drugs * Large doses of antibiotics to defend the body against opportunistic_infections * Bone_marrow transplants for advanced cases TREATMENT RESULTS Left untreated , acute_leukemia can be fatal in a_few weeks to a_few months . Of the two types of acute_leukemia , lymphoblastic is the most common in children and often responds to treatment . * The five-year survival rate for children treated with chemotherapy is about 70 % . * Most relapses occur within two years of treatment . * For those patients who have another , harder-to-treat form of the disease , called non-lymphoblastic leukemia , chemotherapy and a bone_marrow transplant may be needed .
