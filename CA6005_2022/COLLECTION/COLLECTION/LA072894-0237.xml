   <HEADLINE> A BIT OF CICELY IN POLAND ; FANS FIND POST-COMMUNISM RESPITE WITH ' NORTHERN EXPOSURE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Krystyna Pawlak did the unimaginable last week , and she would like to thank the good people of Cicely , Alaska . Never mind for now that there really is no such place . With a sleeping bag , two backpacks , $ 50 and her two daughters in tow , Pawlak fled the swelter and drudgery of her kitchen for the first time in years -- hitchhiking 400 miles over two days to this lakeside town on Poland ' s woodsy northern frontier . To pull it off , the 47-year-old housewife lied to her husband ( he thinks she took the train ) , spent a night in a convent ( it was all she could afford ) and ultimately set_up home here in an army tent ( she rented it from the Boy_Scouts ) . &quot; My neighbors would never understand this , &quot; she said . &quot; But the Indian woman in Cicely would . She once went_off to Seattle looking_for adventure . I am looking_for adventure as well , and it has been wonderful. &quot; The Indian woman is Marilyn Whirlwind , a character played by Elaine Miles in the American television series , CBS ' &quot; Northern Exposure. &quot; In just one year on Polish television , the quirky series has captured the imagination of this country and , as evidenced by Pawlak and other fans gathered here , has set_off a social revolution . Exhausted and disoriented by the trying social and economic changes of the last five years , many Poles have found an uncanny respite in the fictional environment of &quot; Northern Exposure , &quot; an uncomplicated place where people accept life as it comes , tolerate differences among themselves -- no matter how bizarre or comical -- and work_out problems peacefully . &quot; Our village ( Stara Rudna ) is completely different from that town -- people are fighting with each other all_the time , and we never really talk to each other about our problems , &quot; Pawlak said . &quot; The town in the series may be artificial , but it shows how we could live if we tried. &quot; More_than 2 # 000 fans of the offbeat series met last week in this out-of-the-way place , which has proclaimed itself Poland ' s own Cicely , Alaska , the fictional setting of the television series . Because there are only 150 hotel_rooms here , most visitors improvised on accommodations , sleeping_in a school , pitching tents and wigwams and crowding into the homes of residents , in some cases free_of charge . Four barrel-sized kettles were kept boiling on a wood stove in a shady grove , one brimming with potatoes and the others with water for tea , coffee and , for the immodest , a sponge_bath . The town collected donations so a family of 11 with no money could attend , while another penniless fan stopped to paint a garage en route to Olecko to finance the last leg of his trip . &quot; This series has drawn people of all ages and all walks_of_life , from the cab driver to the university professor , &quot; said Irena Groblewska , a Warsaw publicist who founded the fan club three months ago . &quot; We have blind people who listen to the show . We get letters from convicts in prison , retirees and 8-year-old schoolchildren . It is an absolutely inspiring phenomenon. &quot; Oleckoans acknowledge that their town is certainly not a postcard image of Cicely . It is far bigger and less rustic than its television counterpart ; there are only imitation Native_Americans ; it is terribly flat , and the only moose in town has been rented and hangs above the entrance to a downtown convenience_store . A small toy factory produces stuffed animals , which residents call Alaskan bears but look_like koalas . Townspeople say many of them share the uncommon warmth -- if also some of the quirkiness -- of the television characters , and , in the very least , they have a longing to be like Cicely . The silhouette of a moose has been unofficially added_to the town logo , as has the slogan &quot; Way Station , Olecko , &quot; a play_on the Polish name for the television series , &quot; Way Station , Alaska. &quot; In one year on the air , &quot; Northern Exposure &quot; has become the most watched show on Poland ' s more highbrow second channel , even outdistancing the ever-popular evening news despite a less than ideal broadcast slot at 10:15 p.m. on Fridays . So encouraged by the viewer response , Channel 2 executives have already purchased 25 additional episodes and made_it clear they want more as they become available . Since the collapse of communism , American television_programs and movies have become ubiquitous in Poland , accounting_for about 80 % of the entertainment on the two national channels . But few shows have attracted such a passionate following -- or aroused such intense feelings -- as &quot; Northern Exposure. &quot; Some prime-time soap_operas and action series on Channel 1 , including &quot; Dynasty &quot; and &quot; The Colbys , &quot; have drawn larger audiences , but the attraction was more fascination than the deep , inner connection &quot; Northern Exposure &quot; viewers profess , programmers said . &quot; We are in a period of great transition in Poland , where it seems people are only eager to run to the stock_exchange and check the value of their holdings , &quot; said Danuta Celinska , program manager for Polish television . &quot; After more_than four years of this , we feel the need to visit such places as Cicely , Alaska , and experience interpersonal contacts without any economic motives behind them. &quot; For those meeting in Olecko , it was an opportunity of a lifetime to encounter other Poles who share their vision of a more ideal Poland . A packed calendar of events leaned heavily on back-to-nature themes , with outings into the nearby forest , seminars on growing sprouts , demonstrations on the customs of Native_Americans , and kayak and bicycle_races . There was also a series of cultural offerings , ranging from rock_concerts to open-air experimental theater . &quot; We created a certain program , but the idea was to let people create most of it themselves , &quot; said Bohdan Skrzypczak , director of Olecko ' s cultural center and one of the town ' s many self-described Joel Fleischmans , the transplanted New York doctor in the series who must practice in Cicely as payment for his medical_school bills . &quot; Even though this is a small_town , you can realize your dreams here , &quot; said Skrzypczak , who moved to Olecko seven years ago only because he could find a large apartment there . &quot; There are moments when I want to leave , but after events like this , I realize how much you can accomplish. &quot; It was &quot; Northern Exposure &quot; that inspired the gathering , and it was the series that served_up the most meaningful offerings of the week . An early morning radio show , fashioned after the show ' s &quot; Chris in the Morning &quot; radio program , provided a daily tally of good deeds in Olecko , sprinkled with poetry readings , guest interviews and philosophical musings . And each evening at 6 , hundreds of viewers crammed into a stuffy auditorium to watch the first episodes of the show , followed by soul-bearing , free-flowing group_discussions on a breezy lakeside knoll . Topics ranged from the motives of characters on the show , to flaws and inconsistencies in the story line , to how a faraway -- and make-believe -- place could strike such a responsive chord in Poland . Warsaw therapist Tanna Jakubowicz said the sessions were extraordinary because Poland has no tradition of group_discussion . Sitting on the grass in a large circle , viewer after viewer bemoaned the pessimistic state of affairs in Poland and the lack of such interaction in their hometowns , while at_the_same_time sounding hopeful that this unusual television series might help make a difference . &quot; We have a history in Poland of being victims , so people have always looked_for someone to blame , someone to project our problems on , &quot; Jakubowicz said . &quot; For years it was the Communists , but we don ' t have the Communists anymore , so there is a tendency to blame your neighbors , people who are different from you , who have a different religion or nationality . This meeting has helped people understand their neighbors are not their enemies , just as in ' Northern Exposure. ' &quot;</TEXT>
