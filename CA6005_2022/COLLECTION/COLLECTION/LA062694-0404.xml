   <HEADLINE> THE SUNDAY PROFILE ; ONE MAN ' S VISION ; AS AN ARCHITECT , KI SUH PARK KNOWS HOW TO BUILD DREAMS . BUT HE HAS DISCOVERED THAT BUILDING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY IS MUCH TRICKIER . AS AN ACTIVIST , HE WORKS NOT ON NEW STRUCTURES BUT ON DEVELOPING AND RESTORING COMMON_GROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Morning ' s light splinters through the towering atrium of the Los Angeles Convention Center . Ki Suh Park -- in suit and tie -- kneels , licks his finger and rubs hard at a scuff mark snaking across the terrazzo floor . The expansion of the center was , in terms of architecture , the most demanding project of Park ' s 33-year career . For more_than seven years , it was pure agony , he says . But since its opening in 1993 , agony has given_way to excitement . No , he says , it is more_than excitement . He stands , breathes deeply and looks_up into the 150-foot glass canyon . &quot; It is exhilaration. &quot; Park , who in 1986 became the first Korean American named to the prestigious College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects , is the managing partner of Gruen Associates in Los Angeles . The firm , with Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners in New York , headed the consulting team for the convention center . As an architect , Park sees_through walls to steel beams and concrete foundations the way a doctor sees_through skin to bones and tissue . It is with the same vision that he views his work for RLA ( formerly Rebuild L.A. ) . There , too , he sees_through walls . The day after the violence , Park surveyed Koreatown on his way from his office in West Los Angeles to a meeting in Downtown . He drove without stopping , shocked by what he saw . On Western Avenue , he passed Koreatown Plaza , the only piece of his work in the community , a building that , he says , &quot; is special in my heart. &quot; The Plaza escaped serious damage , but its survival did little to console Park as he came_upon the layer of smoke hanging ghostlike over the city . He had seen such destruction , such smoke before , as a young_man in his homeland . Park ' s interest in architecture grew not from visions of grand buildings , but from the sight of rubble , structures destroyed during the Korean_War . As he viewed Koreatown , he realized for a second time that someone must rebuild , not only the buildings but also the peace . In Korean culture , a person ' s 60th birthday is cause for special celebration . It marks a rebirth . In 1992 , the year of the riots and of Park ' s 60th , he vowed to devote more attention to the needs of his city . &quot; Our survival and the future of the city depend_on it , &quot; he says . &quot; The whole world lives in this city , and if we can make_it happen , this can be the model for the future of the entire world. &quot; This is an uncertain time for Korean Americans , particularly the first-generation U.S. citizens . As they look_to their native_land , they again fear the threat of war , heightened by concerns about North_Korea ' s nuclear program . And as they look_back upon the riots , they see the ashes of the dreams that brought them here . As he stands beneath the convention center ' s sheets of tinted glass , like a stargazer under a desert sky , Park describes a colleague ' s recent observation that standing in its south lobby is like being outdoors , that from inside one can connect with the city and the sky and the trees planted out front . &quot; The light is beautiful this time of morning , &quot; Park says . He walks to the far wall and kneels again . He studies the floor , which doubles as a map of the Pacific Rim , then carefully points to a spot . &quot; This , &quot; he says , &quot; is Pusan. &quot; It is where his vision began . The strength and spirit of a building , like that of a person , arises from within and begins with a vision of what might be . When people speak_of Park , they remark on his ability to see how minute details affect a complicated picture , on the way he can look_at wreckage and see wondrous possibilities . Park ' s coming_to America is an unlikely story involving war , a letter to the Los Angeles Times , a couple from Montebello , a congressman from Indiana , writer James Michener , artist Norman Rockwell . And a vision . When Park was 6 , his father , an agriculture researcher , and mother left Seoul to work in the country . They left Park , the second of nine children , with his grandparents so he could continue to attend city schools . He was a diligent student . Korean schools , reflecting years of Japanese colonialism , operated under a system that imposed great competition among students . They were seated according to class rank , and Park was always near or at the top . He entered law_school right out of high_school , but about two weeks into classes his life changed dramatically . He awakened one morning in 1950 to find the streets claimed by tanks and Red Army soldiers . Fearful that he would be forced into their ranks , Park , then 18 , went_into hiding . He recalls how , for the next several months , he moved_back_and_forth between his aunt ' s home and grandparents ' home , where the furniture had been crammed into a back_room , leaving a two-foot crawl space . &quot; Guests are coming. &quot; That was the warning his elders would give if soldiers approached the house . One day , Park and his older sister were reading when they heard their grandmother ' s voice : &quot; Guests are coming. &quot; He and his sister scrambled behind the furniture , crouching low to the floor . Park heard footsteps . Spotting an open book , Shakespeare written in Japanese , on a hallway desk , the soldiers suspected they had interrupted something . Park and his sister remained still , afraid to breathe , as the &quot; guests &quot; pushed against the furniture . Finally , he heard them go . On another occasion , two younger brothers buried themselves in a hay pile , narrowly escaping the surging bayonets of soldiers . Three months later , Park volunteered for the South_Korean national_guard , surviving on a diet of salt water and rice for 1 1 / 2 years . He then managed a canteen for the Red_Cross in Pusan and , later , worked as a translator for the U.S. Joint Advisory Command , also in Pusan . Amid the destruction of the war , Park decided to become an architect . There would be a need for people to rebuild the country . He told soldiers at the canteen that he wanted to go_to America to become an architect . They encouraged him to write letters to U.S. newspapers requesting a sponsor . He mailed three such letters , but only one was published . In May , 1952 , the Los Angeles Times ran his letter , which was read with interest by Muriel McClelland of Montebello . She was touched by Park ' s words : &quot; I am anxious to continue an education in the United States in_order to be of_value to the rebuilding of Korea following cessation of hostilities , &quot; he wrote . &quot; I am sure that you will readily understand that the present condition of Korea requires our younger generation to carry_on war to gain final victory at all cost against the Red Communists and to concentrate our efforts to aid in the rehabilitation of the war-devastated country. &quot; Now 92 and living_in Florida , McClelland recalls that she had just finished reading Michener ' s &quot; Voice of Asia &quot; when she saw the letter . She wrote to the author through his publisher , and he responded from his Bucks County , Pa. , home . While Michener , married at the time to an architect , wanted to help , he said he could not give money to an individual . Instead , he set_up a scholarship fund at East Los Angeles Junior_College , where Park planned to enroll . Meanwhile , Jerry Rockwell , a U.S. soldier in Pusan , was also writing letters . In one to his father , Norman Rockwell , he told Park ' s story and asked what could be done to help . The artist went_to a friend , James Canfield , who agreed to be a sponsor . Then-U.S. Rep . Ralph Harvey of Indiana had also heard about Park and signed_on as a sponsor . With everything in_order , Park faced one final obstacle : getting here . Soldiers put him on a single-engine military plane bound for Seoul , where he could ask his grandfather for air fare . It was Park ' s second trip on an airplane , and he was nervous . His first had been marked by gunfire . For nearly 10 years , he would have nightmares about being hijacked to North_Korea . His grandfather , the first Western-educated doctor in Korea , had money and land but preached to young people the importance of earning their own way , as he had . But the elder Park , sensing his grandson ' s desperation , bought him a ticket and threw_in $ 80 to get him started in his new life . On March 1 , 1953 , Park arrived in Los Angeles with simple gifts -- silver chopsticks and a Chinese scroll . The next day , he began his studies . Park stayed with the McClelland family , working around the house after school . He would never ask his sponsors for money , and he would never meet Michener or Rockwell . But Harvey visited and set_up a trip to Washington D.C. , where Park shook the hands of Lyndon B . Johnson and John F . Kennedy . Park was consumed by education , yet he missed his family and homeland . He would sometimes mix ketchup and hot_sauce and pour it over rice to soothe his craving for kim che , a spicy Korean staple . After 1 1 / 2 years of junior_college , Park received a scholarship to UC Berkeley . He went_on to earn separate master ' s degrees in architecture and city_planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . There is no trace of bitterness in his voice as he describes mailing resumes all_over the country after graduation . No one seemed interested , despite his outstanding credentials . Finally , in 1961 , he landed a job with the firm owned by Victor Gruen , who had fled Vienna in 1938 to escape Hitler . In a profession dominated by white male power players , Gruen provided opportunities for ethnic minorities and women . &quot; There was a lot of discrimination , &quot; he says . &quot; Nobody wanted to hire me , but I ignored it because in the end those who excel will overcome . As I get older , that ' s not good_enough . As a group , we must fight discrimination. &quot; Gruen Associates was an egalitarian island , but Park recalls searching for a first apartment here with wife Ildong , also a first-generation Korean American , whom he had met and married at Berkeley . They would walk up_to buildings with &quot; For Rent &quot; signs posted , only to be told the unit had been rented . Days later , the sign would still be there . They eventually found an apartment on Westmoreland Avenue , near Downtown , and now have a home_in Westwood . Gruen gave Park the chance to practice city_planning as well as architecture , and he worked with the same intensity he showed as a student . In 1968 , he became a vice_president . Thom Mayne , managing partner at the Morphosis architectural firm in Santa Monica , worked with Park in the early 1970s . &quot; He was very demanding , very rigorous , &quot; Mayne says . &quot; For a period there , he went_through about a jillion secretaries . . . . I would write memos and he would send them back to me with corrections. &quot; Yes , Park says , he is demanding , circumspect . He still edits memos . He still believes he can accomplish more today than he did yesterday , and that has been his driving force . &quot; I had such faith in the future , &quot; he says , &quot; faith that if I work really hard and do my best , opportunity will open_up for me , and that ' s what attracted me to come_to this country . I still believe_in that. &quot; Coming_to America changed Park . Since leaving Korea in 1953 , he had become an architect , a husband and father . Almost without realizing it , he had become American . Park decided against returning to South_Korea and in 1966 became a U.S. citizen . In 1972 , he was named a partner at Gruen , and nine years later became the firm ' s managing partner . At the recent national convention of the American Institute of Architects at the L.A. Convention Center , Park became the first Korean American to receive the Whitney M . Young Jr . Citation , in honor of the late civil_rights leader who in 1968 challenged architects to assume professional responsibility toward social issues . But these are not things he mentions when discussing his accomplishments . What he is most proud_of are the three sons he raised with Ildong , who worked for 10 years as a research associate at UCLA Medical_School . David , 34 , graduated from UCLA and Boston College Law_School . He is a litigation attorney here . Kevin , 27 , graduated from Harvard , studied at Oxford_University and this month graduated from Harvard Medical_School . Edwin , 22 , also graduated this month , from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Administration and International Affairs at Princeton_University . He will attend Harvard Law_School . Including Ki Suh , the family of five includes three Phi Beta Kappas . As Park has grown older , he has come_to learn that his children and granddaughter are the measure of his success , the source of strength and spirit that rises from within . &quot; How do you know where you are in the ocean unless you have a benchmark ? &quot; One must have a reference_point , Park says , a place from which to decide where to go . To work hard , to struggle , is to swim in circles unless one has bearings . To understand other people , and the problems they face , one must practice empathy . &quot; The best way to do that is to really listen to you , &quot; Park says , &quot; to understand how you thought , the process you went_through , why you did what you did. &quot; Beginning in 1969 , he embarked_on a 25-year project that would teach him a lesson and change his life : planning and designing the Century Freeway from Los Angeles International Airport to Norwalk . It would disrupt the lives of many people who lived along the corridor . During numerous public hearings , the residents described the harm it would do to their communities . About 21 # 000 people were ultimately displaced by the 17-mile roadway . &quot; I used to look through my eyes on everything , form an opinion from my eyes , &quot; he says , &quot; but I learned that you really have to have empathy for other people , how they see the same thing , &quot; Park says of the project . Empathy became a word he used often . He cannot drive the freeway , which finally opened last year , without seeing the good , the people it serves , as well as the bad , the lives adversely affected . &quot; The benefit is great , but there are thousands of people who got hurt in the process . that ' s part of the process . Our public policy has to be compassionate to take_care of those who are unduly hurt . That absolutely has to be done. &quot; Park is credited with routing the freeway to minimize its impact and helping to create programs , including job training , to assist displaced residents . &quot; He was a leader in that regard , &quot; says Charles O ' Connell , L.A. deputy district director of Caltrans . &quot; He heightened everyone ' s sensitivities concerning the role of government in being a sensible partner. &quot; Park brought_together residents with elected and government officials to discuss the project . He encouraged them to listen , to find a benchmark in the ocean . During the freeway planning process , he began to shed his diffident nature . Previously reluctant to express his views , he opened_up and became less self-conscious about his accent , more confident in himself . He learned that what you say is more important than how you say it . &quot; If it comes from your heart , that ' s what matters most . To feel empathy doesn ' t mean that you are more interested in what other people feel than what you feel yourself . I value my ideas , my perspectives as much as anybody else ' s . You have to have your own ideas , otherwise you are nobody. &quot; In the early days of Rebuild L.A. , when tensions were high and fingers were being pointed , Park was instrumental in creating a constructive atmosphere as co-chair of the Racial Harmony and Discourse Task_Force . &quot; He stressed that it was so important to be able to step inside the other person , &quot; co-chair Marilyn Solomon says . &quot; His attitude and style and sensitivity surfaced quietly but with determination and a clear-eyed sense of what was appropriate to ease tensions. &quot; When the family of Latasha Harlins , a black youth killed in 1991 by a Korean American store owner , formed a foundation and approached the group about_turning the store into a community_center , Park persuaded the mortgage holders to meet with the family . The Korean bankers agreed to give them time to raise money . RLA is one step toward racial harmony , Park says , but the journey is long , and there are many walls . Beyond them , he sees hope . That , too , is part of his vision . Racial harmony is mandatory for economic vitality , he says . It is not only a humane goal but fundamental to restoring confidence in the city . RLA was formed in the aftermath of the 1992 civil unrest to enhance economic development and create jobs in neglected areas . About one-half of the structures sustaining major damage during the disturbance were owned by ethnic Koreans , says Linda Griego , RLA president and CEO . And of the 10 # 000 people who applied for emergency Small Business Administration assistance , nearly half had Korean surnames . Park is frustrated that , despite all_the words that were spoken , many victims have been neglected . &quot; Koreans have made substantial contributions in this city , but look what happened during the civil disturbance , &quot; he says . &quot; We didn ' t get help from anywhere . That shows you we have to generate a voice . We not only have to work within our community , we also have to work with other ethnic_groups to build strong alliances and develop common ground. &quot; Park , who chairs the Korean American Coalition , believes that Korean Americans were targeted during the violence and continue to be misunderstood . &quot; It is a stereotype that Koreans come here with money and go_into the poorer neighborhoods and take the blood out of them , put nothing back in . that ' s simply not true , &quot; he says . Much of the negative attention has centered_on Korean-owned liquor_stores in black communities . Some have charged that the proprietors are greedy , rude and refuse to hire locals . Others say there are simply too many liquor_stores in their neighborhoods . &quot; I don ' t know what ' s right or wrong , &quot; Park says , &quot; but if the community thinks that the abundance of liquor_stores is hurting community interests , then the public or city should work toward reducing the number . If so , proper compensation should be given to the current liquor_store owners. &quot; RLA is asking Korean business owners whose liquor_stores were destroyed to consider opening grocery markets . Some may make the change , many have moved , and others will never reopen . More_than 300 buildings citywide remain vacant and face demolition . &quot; Sometimes , &quot; Park says , &quot; I feel_like a tiny grain of sand . But you can ' t remake the world overnight or remake the city overnight . The question is : Are we even taking the first_step ? &quot; But even a tiny grain of sand can be a benchmark in the ocean , and Park knows from his own life that work and faith and vision make many things possible . And from moments of agony come moments of excitement . No , not excitement . Exhilaration . Ki Suh Park Age : 62 . Native ? No . Born in Korea , lives in Westwood . Family : Married for 37 years to Ildong Park ; three grown sons . Passions : Helping the city to achieve peace . On working toward racial harmony : &quot; Our survival and the future of the city depend_on it . The whole world lives in this city , and if we can make_it happen , this can be the model for the future of the entire world. &quot; On job discrimination in the early ' 60s : &quot; Nobody wanted to hire me , but I ignored it because in the end those who excel will overcome . As I get older , that ' s not good_enough . As a group , we must fight discrimination and make_sure some of the things that have happened in this society are minimized. &quot; On his drive to succeed : &quot; I had such faith in the future , faith that if I work really hard and do my best , opportunity will open_up for me . And that ' s what attracted me to come_to this country . I still believe_in that. &quot; On his approach to a difficult problem : &quot; I used to look through my eyes on everything , form an opinion from my eyes . But I learned that you really have to have empathy for other people , how they see the same thing. &quot;</TEXT>
