   <HEADLINE> AGENCIES READY BIDS FOR CRIME BILL MONEY ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF AND POLICE FEAR THEY MAY BE OVERSHADOWED BY URBAN AREAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Police_departments in Oxnard , Ventura and Santa Paula are scrambling to retool old federal grant applications so they can get_in line for a share of President Clinton ' s $ 30-billion anti-crime package . Ventura County Sheriff Larry Carpenter is also studying how to grab a portion of the huge pot of money that federal_officials promise will boost police staffing 18 % to 20 % nationwide by the year 2000 . The $ 13.45-billion Cops on the Beat program aims to make_good on Clinton ' s campaign promise of putting 100 # 000 more officers on the street -- which Ventura County police_chiefs hope could replace officers bled away by the county ' s faltering economy . But Carpenter and local police_chiefs worry there will be little left for them once Cops on the Beat hires new officers to fight the horrendous crime in the nation ' s larger cities . &quot; My concern is that urban_areas with high crime_rates are probably going_to get the lion ' s share of this money , &quot; said Carpenter , whose agency polices half the county ' s 10 cities and all_of the unincorporated areas . Oxnard Police_Chief Harold Hurtt is also concerned about the competitive disadvantage of local police agencies . &quot; We ' re probably going_to be punished because of our low crime_rate in the county , &quot; Hurtt said . &quot; There ' s an awful lot of agencies around the country that are in worse shape than we are. &quot; But U . S . Justice_Department officials brushed these doubts aside . Police agencies of all sizes will have an even shot at the money , said Caroline Adelman , a Justice_Department spokeswoman . She said the grants will be doled_out according to a variety of factors , including high crime_rates and a need for community-based police patrols to prevent crime . &quot; I don ' t think anyone has a plan that this much money ' s going_to the Northeast and this much to the Southwest , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' re very aware that when you pop a whole bunch of police into one area , crime can spread into correlating areas . . . . I don ' t think that because Los Angeles gets a whole bunch none of the surrounding areas will. &quot; Rep . Elton Gallegly ( R-Simi Valley ) , who met last week with officials from all_the county ' s police agencies , said : &quot; ( The ) Justice ( Department ) has assured me that this is going_to be a fair shake . It ' s not all going_to go_to the urban_areas like Los Angeles and Detroit and New York City. &quot; And Gallegly pointed_out that with a faltering economy and persistent gang problems , Ventura County also needs the kind of crime-prevention programs the crime bill offers in addition to Cops on the Beat . Last year , the Justice_Department offered a similar program to help police_departments hire more officers . But the program only promised to pay_for half of the costs of equipping , training and paying the officers . This time around , Adelman said , the Justice_Department will start by kicking_in 75 % of the cost of new officers , with local agencies paying the rest . The federal share shrinks year by year until 2000 , when the police_departments must find state or local funding to cover the salaries and other costs of new officers . In addition , departments that lost bids for last year ' s grants will be considered first this time , she said . Among the first in_line will be Ventura County ' s largest city police_force and one of its smallest -- Oxnard and Santa Paula . With barely one officer per 1 # 000 residents , the Oxnard force is one of the nation ' s leanest and busiest for cities of its size , Chief Hurtt said . He is not pleased that the force ' s average response to emergencies has slowed in recent years . &quot; It reduces our flexibility to respond to problem areas , &quot; Hurtt said , &quot; like areas with high rates of burglaries or areas where drugs are being sold on the street . We don ' t have a ready pool of people that we can assign to that for a long-term basis. &quot; Last fall , Oxnard applied for a $ 1-million slice of the $ 150-million federal allotment for new officers , hoping to boost its 164-member force by another 16 officers , Assistant Chief Tom Cady said . The bid was turned_down , he said . This time , while asking_for extra officers , the department also will seek money to support anti-crime programs such_as the Police Activities League , the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs and a midnight sports league touted in the Clinton crime bill as a way to keep youths off the street and out of trouble , Cady said . An influx of new officers would free community-policing supervisors to work full time with neighborhood leaders , Hurtt said . Also , he said , crime-prevention grants would give police a head_start with youths at risk of becoming criminals , Hurtt said . &quot; We have to realize we need to start extending programs to prevent people from committing serious crimes , and we need to do that through education , &quot; he said . Santa Paula police say they face an even tougher situation , given that the city ' s police_force has dropped to 29 officers , the level it was at 22 years ago . In that same time_period , the city ' s population has swelled from 19 # 000 to 27 # 000 . Now , police lock the dispatchers inside the station_house after hours because officers cannot be spared to staff the front desk , said Chief Walt Adair . The department has put_off maintenance on the building . The D.A.R.E. program was shut_down in the first_half of the year . And with officers spending most of their time handling crimes against people , there is no time to follow_up_on smaller crimes such_as minor burglaries , Adair said . Last fall , Santa Paula police applied for a $ 287 # 000 federal grant under the U . S . Attorney_General ' s Police_Officer Hiring Program , promising to match it with $ 287 # 000 in city money to hire three new officers . The bid was rejected . &quot; We ' re providing basic law_enforcement services , &quot; Adair said last week . &quot; An 18 % to 20 % increase in the department would make a world of difference in what we can do. &quot; In Ventura , the city ' s 117-officer Police_Department also sought federal aid last fall . Ventura police asked_for nearly $ 1 million to extend the tenure of nine officers who were about to be laid_off due_to city cutbacks , said Robbie Robinson , administrative assistant to the city ' s police and fire_chiefs . Eventually , the City_Council restored six of the positions and extended the other three until next July in hopes that the department could come_up with the funding , he said . Robinson said he will apply for federal aid to retain the remaining three positions . Last year , the Sheriff ' s Department was the only Ventura County law_enforcement agency to win any of the grant money . The Justice_Department awarded the sheriff $ 300 # 000 -- which the county met with matching funds and augmented with money for new equipment and supplies -- to open a storefront police_station in Fillmore , said Chief Deputy Kenneth Kipp . But Kipp and Sheriff Carpenter scoffed at promises that the crime bill would increase their ranks by 18 % to 20 % . &quot; We ' ve got 700 sworn officers in this department , &quot; Carpenter said , working the math . &quot; that ' s 140 deputies somebody ' s got_to write a check for . Does that make_sense ? that ' s huge . &quot; Kipp added : &quot; I think that ' s probably optimistic political rhetoric . Just based on past ( grant ) attempts , where this money is going_to is certainly not cities in Ventura County. &quot; Nonetheless , Carpenter said Kipp has already registered the department ' s intent to apply for the grant with federal_officials . &quot; My hope is that it works , &quot; the sheriff said , &quot; but I think an 18 % to 20 % net increase is dreaming. &quot; Officials in the county ' s other police_departments -- Port Hueneme and Simi Valley -- said they too will be looking_for ways to apply for the crime bill money . So will the county ' s Department of Corrections Services and the district_attorney ' s office . The Justice_Department will issue its grant application_forms in November and formalize what criteria will be needed to win grants , Adelman said . Until then , she said , it is impossible to determine who will get how much . Roger Honberger , a lobbyist for Ventura County in Washington , said he estimates the federal_government will allot enough money to hire 10 # 000 officers in California . But he said that local police are right to worry that Los Angeles ' police agencies will overshadow them when payout time comes . &quot; But they would be foolish not to apply , &quot; Honberger said . He noted that the crime bill also had money for local_governments in a section called the Local Partnership Act . The county and city governments are in_line for about $ 3 million , according to congressional sources . Honberger advised that the police agencies gear their grant proposals toward beefing_up existing police programs with extra officers rather than simply hiring more line_officers . Fellow lobbyist Tom Walters predicted that agencies that recycle old applications from last fall ' s appropriation could have new officers in as short of a time as six months . Gallegly vowed to press for as much money as possible for the county , but he warned police_departments not to wish for too_much . &quot; There ' s never going_to be enough money to go_around to satisfy all_the needs , &quot; Gallegly said . &quot; There may_not be 100 % of what Santa Paula needs or what Oxnard needs . But there should definitely be enough money in this bill to provide some assistance. &quot; One Small Slice The Local Partnership Act , one segment of the $ 30-billion crime bill , gives $ 216 million to local_governments in California . Cities and counties may spend the money on education , drug treatment or jobs programs . Here ' s an estimated breakdown of local shares . Camarillo : $ 23 # 514 Fillmore : $ 49 # 603 Moorpark : $ 47 # 474 Ojai : $ 18 # 950 Oxnard : $ 1 # 183 , 897 Port Hueneme : $ 113 # 404 Santa Paula : $ 116 # 554 Simi Valley : $ 96 # 394 Thousand Oaks : $ 28 # 434 Ventura : $ 186 # 490 Ventura County : $ 1 # 300 , 000 Source : U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee</TEXT>
