   <HEADLINE> SOUTH_AFRICA ' S TOP KILLER OCCUPIES THE DRIVER ' S SEAT ; TRAFFIC : NEARLY THREE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE DIED IN ROAD ACCIDENTS LAST YEAR AS PERISHED IN RAMPANT POLITICAL VIOLENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a land with one of the world ' s worst murder rates and a horrific history of political bloodletting , the deadliest killer by far is much more mundane : traffic . As Americans count the traditional death toll of the Memorial_Day weekend , in South_Africa , the deaths of 50 people in a bus accident and a minibus collision with a car and truck last Thursday underscored this nation ' s grim status as one of the world ' s most dangerous places to drive . Or for that matter , even to walk . More_than 10 # 000 people died in traffic accidents here last year , or almost three times the number of people killed in political violence . Almost half the victims were pedestrians , mostly hit near the black townships and squatter camps that line many highways . The chief cause of the carnage is simple , said Quinton van Eeden , assistant general_manager of the Automobile Assn . of South_Africa . &quot; Unfortunately , the biggest problem is the driver , &quot; he said . &quot; South_Africans , I ' d say in_general , tend to be quite aggressive . We also have severe literacy problems . That sort of thing needs to change. &quot; Apartheid may be dead , but its lethal legacy survives on South_Africa ' s roads . The collision of First and Third_World cars and conditions produces a daily litany of what newspapers inevitably call &quot; horror crashes. &quot; There are enough rich whites to support a BMW factory here , and their Mercedes-Benzes and other high-powered cars zoom at 75 m.p.h. along modern highways . Most blacks , however , commute in overcrowded minibuses used as taxis , while migrant workers and families heading_home huddle in the back of slow-moving trucks . &quot; The problem here is you ' ve got fast cars and slow cars , &quot; said Hubrecht Ribbins , head of traffic safety technology at CSIR , a private Pretoria-based research group . &quot; The differentiation is a real problem , especially at night . When you have a truck filled with people going slowly home , and then a BMW comes_along at high speed and doesn ' t expect anything , you get a rear-end collision. &quot; Then there ' s corruption . To avoid South_Africa ' s strict licensing tests , Ribbins estimates up_to 1 million drivers -- about 20 % of the total -- use bogus licenses obtained from now-abolished homeland governments or bought on a thriving black_market . But a chief cause of the staggering body_count is minibus taxis . They can carry 16 passengers but often cram in dozens more . They barrel along at high speed , suddenly stopping to pick_up or offload passengers . Drivers go hours without rest , afraid of stopping to sleep on roads plagued by bandits . Few South_Africans wear seat_belts . And drunk drivers are a major problem . But Robin Scholtz , an Automobile Assn . spokesman , insists alcohol plays another role as well . &quot; Our biggest problem is drunken pedestrians , &quot; he said . &quot; They wander across the road , and the poor motorist hits them. &quot; It doesn ' t help that sidewalks and pavements don ' t exist in most towns and townships . So poor people without transportation must walk in the road . And despite the dangers , few pedestrians wear light or reflective clothing at night . Only 1 in 100 blacks owns a car , while about half the whites do . According to the Automobile Assn. , South_Africa ' s traffic fatality rate -- about 35 per 100 # 000 people -- ranks worst among 20 countries that it follows . It ' s twice America ' s rate , and higher than Third_World nations such_as Brazil , Botswana and Kenya . South_Korea has the second-worst fatality rate with 27 . Still , South_Korea doesn ' t have hippos . In a 1991 accident here , three cars and a 30-ton truck were nearly demolished in the Transvaal when they slammed into a hippopotamus and one another . Two people were injured ; the hippo died .</TEXT>
