   <HEADLINE> H-II ROCKET MAY LAUNCH JAPAN AEROSPACE FIRMS ; TECHNOLOGY : THOUGH THE ULTIMATE RESULT REMAINS TO BE SEEN , THE NATION HAS BECOME THE NEWEST PLAYER IN THE SPACE GAME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Japan ' s first domestically designed major rocket roared into space Friday , it marked a great leap upward for the country ' s aerospace industry . What that leap will ultimately bring , however , remains mostly a mystery even to the people who built and launched the H-II rocket . An expanded role for Japan in space research is a virtual certainty . A strong foray_into the commercial satellite launch business is a possibility but by no means guaranteed . Military applications could come someday , but Japan has a strong political commitment against development of a missile strike force -- and the H-II is not really the right kind of rocket for that purpose anyway . More_than anything else , the new rocket simply makes Japan the world ' s newest independent player in the space game . For now , at least , that alone is enough to satisfy Japan ' s National Space Development Agency . The successful liftoff ends &quot; a quarter-century approach run , &quot; said Tomifumi Godai , executive_director of NASDA ' s Launch Vehicle Development and Operation division . &quot; Now we mark the beginning of activity to lead the world. &quot; In technical terms , the H-II seems to be world-class . Its engine is broadly modeled on the U.S. space shuttle engine but designed and built , like the rest of the rocket , entirely with Japanese technology . The rocket is relatively powerful for its weight , compared to rockets of a similar class built by other countries . But the H-II has one huge drawback : its price . At $ 170 million a shot , it is one and a half to two times as expensive as key rockets in the world used for commercial satellite launches , such_as the Ariane rocket of France-based Arianespace or General Dynamics ' Atlas and McDonnell Douglas ' Delta . And without winning commercial deals to put satellites in orbit , the 74 Japanese firms involved in building the H-II will have a tough time making much money from their project . The H-II blasted_off shortly after sunrise Friday from the Tanegashima Space Center_on Tanega Island , 23 miles off the coast of Kyushu , the southernmost of Japan ' s four main islands . The launch had been postponed since Tuesday morning , first due_to bad_weather , then because of problems with an air_duct . The liftoff was delayed 20 minutes when a fishing_boat entered a restricted zone below the flight_path . The 260-ton rocket , which is about 14 stories tall , carried a research satellite and an experimental re-entry vehicle designed to test heat-resistant carbon and ceramic materials for a future unmanned Japanese space shuttle . The &quot; Orbital Re-Entry Experiment &quot; vehicle ( dubbed OREX ) circled the Earth once , then splashed down on schedule just south of the Equator in the central Pacific_Ocean about 130 minutes after launch . NASDA developed the H-II at a cost of $ 2.5 billion . Japan ' s determination to build its own rocket is based partly on national pride and partly on a desire not to be dependent_on the United States for the ability to put payloads into space . Previous Japanese rockets incorporated U.S. technology , which gave Washington a voice in their use . &quot; When you transfer technology , the restrictions are very severe , &quot; Tokyo University professor Shigefumi Saito explained in an interview aired by NHK Television . &quot; When U.S. engineers came_to Tanegashima ( more_than a decade ago ) , NASDA engineers weren ' t even allowed to observe their work . For engineers , that was a humiliation . This became a very strong motive force . It made us think we had to develop for ourselves the things we need. &quot; Especially influential , Saito said , was a 1980 incident when an experimental Japanese satellite went_off course and became lost in space . The problem seemed to be with the satellite ' s small engine . But the engine was U.S.-made , and Japanese engineers were not allowed even to examine its blueprints to try to figure_out what went_wrong . The H-II rocket program was started a_few years later . Japan now has ambitious long-term plans in space , including hopes for cooperation with the United States and other countries . &quot; Looking_into the 21st Century , prospects for space_stations and a moon base lie_in front of the Japanese people and the people of the world , &quot; Yasunobu Matogawa , a Space Sciences Institute professor , told NHK . While Japan ' s space research program will continue to be directed by NASDA , the work of building rockets and handling commercial satellite launches will be turned_over to Rocket Systems Corp. , a private firm established in 1990 by 74 of Japan ' s leading companies . But NASDA plans first to conduct another experimental H-II launch this summer . At the core of Rocket Systems Corp. , according to Executive_Vice_President Hiroshi Imamura , are five key firms : Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. , Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. , NEC Corp. , Nissan Motor Co . and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co . These are the same firms that have played key roles in building the various components of the H-II . Rocket Systems Corp . and the H-II rocket itself have a guaranteed future because of NASDA ' s need for launch vehicles . But making the rocket a commercial success will be an immense challenge . Today ' s successful launch removes what Imamura called the &quot; biggest wall &quot; blocking his firm from conducting a profitable commercial satellite launch business -- the lack of a rocket . But the current $ 170-million cost of building an H-II rocket must be cut by 30 % to 50 % before it can compete for international business , Imamura said . &quot; Our goal is to reduce the price by manufacturers ' efforts , &quot; he said . &quot; If we can ' t do_it , this rocket will not enter the commercial field. &quot; About 60 % of the world satellite launch business is currently held by Arianespace , which has had 57 successful launches and six failures . The latest failure came last month , when an Ariane rocket crashed after takeoff from a site in French Guiana , ending a string of 27 consecutive successes . Some future combination of troubles in other countries ' launch programs and a sharp increase in_demand for satellites could increase the importance of the H-II even if it remains a relatively expensive vehicle . The H-II was plagued by various problems during its development , including two explosions -- of an engine and of an engine part -- that delayed the launch by two years . But its makers hope that high reliability will ultimately become a strong selling point .</TEXT>
