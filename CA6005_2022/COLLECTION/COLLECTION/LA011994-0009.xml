   <TEXT> * Gregg Easterbrook , in &quot; The Doomsday Spin &quot; ( Opinion , Jan . 9 ) , concludes that &quot; low levels of radiation are far less worrisome than once assumed. &quot; But he is in serious error on essentially every scientific issue he addresses . He suggests the old saw that a lower cancer rate in high-altitude Denver , with its elevated background_radiation dose , may argue for beneficial effects of radiation . This notion has long ago been discredited for its failure to control comparability of cities on causes of cancer other_than radiation . Easterbrook erroneously suggests that Alice Stewart exonerates radiation in Hanford workers by finding that the cancer rate is lower than that for the population at_large . Stewart ' s major finding is a very large effect of radiation in producing cancer in workers , when one compares Hanford workers getting various doses of radiation . He describes the dose of injected plutonium in the plutonium experiment as &quot; incredibly tiny. &quot; He is simply mistaken . Dr. Roland Finston ' s estimated bone-doses from plutonium in the persons at_issue are very large . My own estimates agree with those of Finston . Easterbrook ' s comparison of a microcurie with a curie is irrelevant . The suggestion is made that the Hanford releases of 685 # 000 curies of radioiodine may have done little harm , in his statement , &quot; Yet it may be that Hanford workers are not especially sick. &quot; But the Hanford estimation of doses and evaluation of health outcomes now being studied by government-sponsored programs have not yet reached any conclusions ! Dr. Rosalyn Yalow ' s work_on radioimmunoassay is cited by Easterbrook as &quot; the basic test by which radioactive harm to the body is measured. &quot; Dr. Yalow ' s excellent work with radioimmunoassay has nothing at all to do with ascertaining radiation ' s harm to the body . Easterbrook tells us that &quot; nuclear-power plants cannot explode but can emit tiny amounts of radiation. &quot; The Chernobyl power_plant did have a massive explosion and sent gigantic quantities of radioactive nuclides a mile high into the atmosphere and around the world . Easterbrook suggests , correctly , that &quot; mammal bodies possess some genetic resistance to radiation. &quot; But he fails to mention that such genetic repair capability produces some misrepair , leaves some injury unrepaired and finds some injury unrepairable . I have spent over 25 years in criticism of lies and inaccuracies from AEC ( Atomic Energy Commission ) and DOE ( Department_of_Energy ) . I believe Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary . I think her public statements and her actions are indeed admirable . She represents welcome attributes in government : candor , compassion and credibility . I wish her the very best in what appears to be a superb pro-people approach . JOHN W .
