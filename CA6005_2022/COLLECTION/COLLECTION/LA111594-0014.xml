   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON PROPOSITION 187 ; A ' PEOPLE ' TREATY URGENTLY NEEDED ; IMMIGRATION WAS THE ONE ISSUE NAFTA SKIRTED ; U.S. , MEXICO MUST FACE IT BEFORE CALIFORNIANS ' LOATHING GOES NATIONAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States and Mexico now have one more thing in common : discontent with each other . Less than a year ago , the North_American Free_Trade Agreement was hailed as the advent of multifaceted collaboration between the two countries . California ' s passage last week of Proposition 187 flies in the face of that cooperative vision . When voters shouted loud and clear &quot; Mexicans , go_home ! &quot; they demonstrated the depths of resentment Californians feel toward the burgeoning Mexican presence . California ' s use of a ballot initiative to deny state-funded services to undocumented immigrants underscored the lack of leadership on the immigration issue . Unless Washington makes immigration a matter for bilateral attention , the Proposition 187 debacle will jeopardize the future of U.S.-Mexico relations , the electoral prospects of the Democratic Party and the very spirit of North_American integration . The anti-Mexican sentiment , fueled by the reelection campaign of Republican Gov . Pete Wilson , caught Presidents Bill_Clinton and Carlos Salinas unprepared . During the marketing of NAFTA , both presidents lobbied intensively , cut back-room deals , courted constituencies on both sides of the border , wooed labor and environmental advocates and invested substantial amounts of political capital for the sake of free_trade . In order to assure the safe passage of the treaty , they left the thorniest issue on the integration agenda -- immigration -- unaddressed . As Proposition 187 grew in appeal north of the border , Salinas was devoting his attention to his post-presidency career . Clinton ' s response was the so-called Operation Guardian , which focused_on adding_to the Border_Patrol , a haphazard policy that proved to be too_little , too late . The shortsightedness on both sides of the border will be paid_for by the thousands of Mexicans living under the Damocles sword of Proposition 187 . This first NAFTA backlash in the ballot_box suggests that for many Californians , collaboration with Mexico should be limited to trade and deportation . Many of those who voted_in favor of 187 said that they did so to &quot; send a message &quot; to the federal_government . What they failed to realize is that in the era of U.S.-Mexico interdependence , domestic politics have become a bilateral affair . The &quot; message &quot; sounds like entrenched racism to Mexicans , who now view 187 as yet another example of the imperial attitudes that fueled the invasions and interventions of the past . Proposition 187 is not perceived in Mexico as a California-specific , faulty piece of legislation that will probably die in the courts , but as nothing short of betrayal by an untrustworthy ally . Unless the immigration issue is tackled in a constructive way , Mexico and the United States will probably revert to a historic cycle of confrontation and recrimination . Mexican and U.S. leaders who fought for NAFTA now have the political responsibility to hammer_out a binational accord that goes beyond trade : an immigration agreement that both sides can live with . Instead of engaging in ineffectual nationalist posturing , incoming President Ernesto Zedillo should assemble a team of immigration negotiators who are as savvy and successful as their NAFTA trade counterparts and beckon the Clinton_Administration to the bargaining table . Instead of wallowing in self-doubt and despair , the Democrats should seize the opportunity to develop a binational immigration policy that could unite their party ' s divided ranks . By taking the lead_on immigration policy , wounded Democrats might recover the initiative they handed_over to Republican Mexico-bashers , who would like nothing more_than to poison the bilateral relationship . Conservatives in the United States have realized that the immigration issue can be an effective political battle horse , and in all likelihood , they will attempt to use it to storm the White_House in 1996 . Unless Proposition 187 is stopped_dead in its tracks , the fear and loathing that marked California ' s election season will become the trademark of the next presidential campaign . Anti-Mexico sentiments could easily spill_over into the Southwest , breeding political polarization and bringing_to an end a short-lived period of harmony in U.S.-Mexico relations . If its advocates were correct , if NAFTA was about creating a new partnership between Mexico and the United States , Proposition 187 is its first real test . NAFTA was conceived to avoid discrimination against goods . A U.S.-Mexico treaty on immigration should be devised to prevent discrimination against people . The U.S.-Mexico border has often been described as an open wound . NAFTA was expected to heal it , albeit through a long , slow and imperfect scarring process , by creating a basic framework for cooperation between the two countries . But if California ' s intemperance inaugurates yet another era in which , to paraphrase Martin_Luther_King , men , women and children are judged not by the content of their character but by the color of their skin , the wound that binds Mexico and the United States may never heal .</TEXT>
