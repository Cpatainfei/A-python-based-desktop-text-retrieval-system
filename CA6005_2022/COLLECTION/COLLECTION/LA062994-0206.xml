   <HEADLINE> CHINA ASSISTED U.S. EFFORTS ON N . KOREA , OFFICIALS SAY ; ASIA : BEIJING REPORTEDLY RECOMMENDED FREEZING OF NUCLEAR PROGRAM -- AFTER CLINTON RENEWED ITS TRADE STATUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China played an important , behind-the-scenes role in persuading North_Korea to freeze its nuclear program and has since informed the United States of its efforts , Clinton_Administration officials and Washington-based diplomats say . Just days before former President Jimmy_Carter visited Pyongyang , China ' s Foreign Ministry in Beijing called_in North_Korea ' s ambassador to warn that his government could not depend indefinitely on Chinese support in its confrontation with the United States over its nuclear program . The message China delivered was that it would be in Pyongyang ' s self-interest , for economic development and for its desire to reunify Korea , to cooperate more with international efforts to inspect its nuclear facilities , U.S. officials said . This warning is said to have been reinforced by a similar Chinese message to North_Korea ' s ambassador at the United Nations . &quot; I ' ve had Chinese officials tell me they did that , and we ' ve had other signals too that the Chinese were growing more and more frustrated with the North_Koreans , &quot; a senior U.S. official said in an account confirmed by others in the Clinton_Administration . &quot; These recent moves by China . . . were quite significant in terms of affecting North_Korea ' s thinking. &quot; Beijing ' s efforts to influence North_Korea were timed in a way that seemed to be aimed at rewarding the Administration for changes in its China policy . They came within weeks of President Clinton ' s announcement , on May 29 , that he would extend China ' s trading privileges in the United States without imposing any conditions for improvements in human_rights . Neither China nor the United States has claimed there was any connection between Administration help for Beijing on most-favored-nation trade benefits , on the one hand , and Chinese support for America with North_Korea , on the other . But there have been suggestions of an informal , unstated link between the two issues . &quot; We had really , painstakingly worked with the Chinese , &quot; another Administration official said this week . &quot; And after the MFN decision , the trend was ever clearer that the Chinese were getting fed up ( with North_Korea ) . &quot; By informing the Administration of its message to North_Korea , China apparently was seeking to demonstrate to the White_House the benefits of avoiding further friction between Washington and Beijing . Over the last few weeks , Chinese officials have been trying to convince the Administration not to go too far in upgrading the level of U.S. contact with Taiwan , which China considers a renegade province . Before China delivered its message to North_Korean diplomats , the Pyongyang regime had been threatening to withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency and to expel its inspectors . &quot; That recent dust-up over the inspectors was the proverbial last straw for China , &quot; one Administration official said . The impact of China ' s message to Pyongyang is unknown . But within a short time , North_Korean President Kim Il Sung , during Carter ' s trip , offered to freeze the nuclear program and to let international inspectors remain in North_Korea . Those developments have paved the way for a summit between North and South_Korea , announced Tuesday and set for July 25-27 in Pyonyang . The meeting between the Korean presidents would be the first since the peninsula was divided at the end of World_War_II . China ' s willingness to weigh in with North_Korea represents a significant change . Over the last year , Chinese officials have told the United States that they have little or no influence over North_Korea . They also have contended that the United States and its allies are exaggerating the threat posed by the North_Korean nuclear program and that there was no hard evidence that North_Korea had developed nuclear_weapons . In March , when the Administration tried to win approval for a U.N. resolution condemning North_Korea , China opposed the effort and succeeded in having the proposed resolution watered_down to a &quot; statement &quot; that carried less weight . China continues to oppose sanctions against Pyongyang . But over the last few weeks , Western diplomats say , China has become more cooperative . In changing their approach , Chinese officials are believed to have concluded that it is not in China ' s interest for North_Korea to use its nuclear program to intimidate other Asian_countries . China also does not want a war on its borders ; the North_Korean crisis was beginning to take_on military overtones . The Administration had started moves to bolster U.S. forces in South_Korea , and North_Korea had warned that the imposition of U.N. sanctions , which the United States sought , would be considered an act of war . Administration officials said the first signs of a possible change in policy by China came_in June , when a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong Kong , Ta Kung Pao , suggested that the Chinese government might restrict shipments of oil or even food to North_Korea . A few days later , a delegation of North_Korean military officials visited Beijing for talks with leaders of China ' s People ' s Liberation Army and Chinese President Jiang Zemin . In public , Chinese officials reaffirmed their old , close relationship with North_Korea . Using language dating to the Korean_War era , they said ties between Beijing and Pyongyang were as close as &quot; lips and teeth. &quot; But U.S. experts on Korea believe that -- although Chinese officials embraced the North_Korean military delegation in public -- privately they may have registered unhappiness with Pyongyang ' s nuclear policies . Soon after Carter returned with a promise from Kim to freeze his nuclear program , the Administration obtained detailed assurances of that pledge from Pyongyang . Clinton then announced that the United States would enter into a new round of talks with North_Korea in Geneva beginning July 8 .</TEXT>
