   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS ; HABITAT FOR HUMANITY TO BE DEEDED LAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County ' s chapter of Habitat for Humanity will build its first home for a low-income family on Beall Street in central Thousand Oaks as the City_Council has agreed to deed a vacant_lot to the nonprofit group . Despite objections from a half-dozen Beall Street residents , the council voted to sell the city-owned lot to the Thousand Oaks Redevelopment Agency for about $ 75 # 000.The Redevelopment Agency , which by law must devote one-fifth of its funds to affordable housing , will then turn_around and deed the parcel to Habitat for Humanity . As with other Habitat for Humanity projects nationwide , the Beall Street home will be built , in part , by the future owners . The low-income family chosen to move_in will be asked to contribute 500 hours of &quot; sweat equity &quot; to help construct the home . The family will also make monthly payments to Habitat for Humanity to cover the cost of building_materials . To ensure that the home remains occupied by a low-income family -- with annual income of less than $ 44 # 000 -- the Redevelopment Agency has set_out a strict set of conditions . If Habitat for Humanity violates any term of the agreement , the nonprofit group will be asked to pay the Redevelopment Agency for the Beall Street parcel , according to Olav Hassel , the city ' s housing services manager . Mayor Elois Zeanah cast the only vote against the deal . As chairwoman of the housing issues committee , she originally recommended that the council approve the arrangement . But she changed her mind after Beall Street residents complained that their neighborhood had no room for another house . STEPHANIE SIMON</TEXT>
