   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; BLAIR ' S LATEST PERFORMANCE IS A TREASURE ; WOMEN ' S SPEEDSKATING : THE AMERICAN WINS 1 # 000 METERS FOR SECOND GOLD MEDAL OF THESE GAMES AND FIFTH OVERALL , BECOMING ALL-TIME LEADER AMONG U.S. WOMEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> She was 19 when she finished eighth in the 500 meters of the 1984 Winter_Olympics in Sarajevo . Speedskater Bonnie Blair cocked her head in recollection Wednesday night , smiled and said : &quot; At that time , at that age , I thought I had won . I thought finishing eighth was a victory in itself. &quot; She is 29 now and has experienced the real_thing more often than any other U.S. woman Olympian . Blair blasted into history by winning the 1 # 000 meters Wednesday night with her fastest time since the 1988 Calgary Olympics . She set an Olympic Hall record of 1 minute 18.74 seconds , the only skater in the field of 36 to beat 1:20 . Anke Baier of Germany was second at 1:20.12 and Qiaobo Ye of China was third at 1:20.22. Blair said she will skate through the World Championships in her new hometown of Milwaukee next February but insisted this was her last Olympic race . &quot; Four more years ? I ' m too old for that , &quot; she said . If so , she goes_out with five golds , one more_than diver Pat McCormick , sprinter Evelyn Ashford and swimmer Janet Evans . And she goes_out with six medals in all , a Winter Games high for a U.S. woman and second overall to swimmer Shirley Babashoff , who won two golds and six silvers . &quot; I ' ve gone beyond anything I ' ve ever dreamt about , &quot; Blair said . &quot; Maybe in time I ' ll realize exactly what all this means , but right now all I can think_about is the enjoyment I ' ve experienced participating in the Olympics . &quot; I mean , it seems like the Olympics have always got me going no matter what kind of year I ' ve had . I ' m sad to know this was my last race , but I certainly have a lot of good memories. &quot; Tough , durable and seemingly immune to pressure , Blair fought_off tears on the victory stand , then let them flow while hugging her mother , Evelyn , 73 . She later donned the gold cap that distinguished the Blair Bunch , her 60-strong cheering section of family and friends , and held_up a large U.S. flag while skating a victory lap with Olympic mascots Haakon and Kristin . Susan Auch of Canada , who finished eighth and has been competing against Blair since before Sarajevo , said of her friend and rival : &quot; The big part of it is thinking anything is possible . I mean , I knew Bonnie when she wasn ' t very good . That may be hard to believe , but it ' s been a long_haul . &quot; She ' s worked hard and never quit on herself , and a big part of it , too , is she ' s followed guys like Nick ( Thometz , now her coach ) and Dan ( Jansen ) and skates very much like a guy . She ' s very strong , very powerful . &quot; What can you say ? She ' s definitely special , incredibly talented . I don ' t think anybody compares with her . She ' s dominated the sprints for almost a decade and could probably continue as long as she wants. &quot; Even Ye , a rival on and off the ice , offered grudging admiration . &quot; It seems like she comes_on in the Olympic years , &quot; she said in English . &quot; She ' s really strong this year . Nobody can beat her in the 500 and 1 # 000 . To win five golds is very good , I have to say . I wish I could get one gold. &quot; Ye finished second to Blair in both the 1 # 000 and 500 of the 1992 Olympics , only 0.02 back in the 1 # 000 . However , knee surgery last August cost her a chance for gold , Ye said . At 29 , she said this was her last race , and she couldn ' t stop the tears . &quot; I cry because I couldn ' t do my best , and that makes me sad , &quot; she said . &quot; I still have pain . I couldn ' t control my knee well enough to keep a low position. &quot; Six years ago , at the World Sprints before the Calgary Olympics , Ye failed a doping test and returned to China , she said later , in humiliation , contending a Chinese doctor had given her a mixture of herbs and mushrooms to control a skin_problem and she was not aware that it contained banned substances . Suspicions persisted , however , and Blair , uncharacteristically , has not let it rest , often saying she can only do her best &quot; no matter what others put_in their bodies. &quot; Ye , training recently in Wisconsin , said of Blair , &quot; I don ' t like her anymore . I don ' t like such people . I made a mistake that wasn ' t mine . She shouldn ' t belittle me . I belittle myself enough by remembering. &quot; Against this tense background , Blair and Ye were paired in the second twosome Wednesday . Blair , however , said she was relaxed and confident from the start and raced from a perspective of &quot; never having feared anything or anyone. &quot; She also said she benefited from having to chase Ye , on the inside lane , for most of the first lap . &quot; that ' s always good for me , &quot; she said . &quot; It makes me realize there ' s more involved than the clock. &quot; Blair and Ye shook hands and put arms around each other on the victory stand , but exchanged neither greetings nor glances while icily sitting beside one another during a subsequent news_conference . Asked to review her Olympic moments , Blair cited the awe of her debut in Sarajevo , a world-record 500 in Calgary that she considers the most special of the golds , two victories in Albertville after she had been skating poorly , and two more in Hamar as the culmination of another up-and-down year . &quot; The Norwegian fans are absolutely fabulous , and this arena is terrific , &quot; she said . &quot; The Olympics are unique . I hope to always be involved in some way . It will be hard to stay away. &quot; Harder yet to forget her . You can look it up .</TEXT>
