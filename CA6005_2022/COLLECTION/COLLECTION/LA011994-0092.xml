   <HEADLINE> HARSHER TERMS ARE URGED FOR HERNANDEZES ; COURTS : THE COUPLE EMBEZZLED $ 1 MILLION MORE THAN THOUGHT , AND USED $ 80 # 000 FROM THE SALE OF A CAR TO TRY TO BUY ACTOR RICHARD GERE ' S HOME EVEN AFTER THEIR ARREST , AUTHORITIES SAY IN PAPERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Danny and Susie Hernandez embezzled $ 1 million more_than previously thought from his former employer and even after the socialite couple ' s arrests in March , put $ 80 # 000 into an escrow account to buy actor Richard Gere ' s $ 1.5-million home , authorities allege . In court papers , the U.S. attorney ' s office has recommended that Danny Hernandez spend between 12 1 / 2 and 15 1 / 2 years in federal prison , more_than double the sentence suggested by his probation_officer . Prosecutors say he has attempted to obstruct justice by concealing his assets . The government recommends that Susie Hernandez spend between 2 1 / 4 and 2 3 / 4 years in prison for her role in setting_up bank_accounts in her name to stash the money that her husband skimmed from the customers of PGP Industries , a precious_metals firm . Probation_officers have recommended a lesser sentence but the exact terms have not been revealed in court . The latest flurry of paperwork by the U.S. attorney ' s office in Santa Ana , filed Friday in U.S. District Court , comes days before the Hernandezes are to be sentenced on Monday . James T . Duff , the Los Angeles attorney representing Danny Hernandez , did not return a call_for comment . Susie Hernandez ' s public_defender , Joan Politeo Freeman , said she had no comment . The couple are well-known in Orange County ' s society circles and became popular for charitable donations . At one time or another , they owned five Mercedes-Benzes , three Rolls-Royces , three Ferraris , one Jaguar , an Aston Martin , a Porsche and a Jeep . Danny Hernandez pleaded guilty to mail_fraud and money_laundering . Susie Hernandez pleaded guilty to income_tax evasion . Both have plea agreements with the government that promise their help with a federal investigation into the activities of Danny Hernandez ' s former employer , PGP Industries of Santa Fe Springs . Danny Hernandez said PGP executives urged employees to shortchange customers of precious_metals . The company has denied the allegation . In the documents filed Friday , the government alleges that the Hernandez crimes date_back to 1987 , although the offenses to which they pleaded guilty cover 1989 through 1992 . The pre-sentencing report prepared on the couple alleged they embezzled precious_metals from PGP more_than 50 times and the loss totaled more_than $ 1 million . The U.S._government says it has confirmed more_than a dozen of the transactions -- or the sale of 576.7 ounces of gold -- and all were made in the name of Susie Amash , Susie Hernandez ' s maiden_name . &quot; None of the thefts of precious_metals were disclosed to the government by defendants , despite their promises in their plea agreements , &quot; Assistant U.S. Atty . Stephen G . Wolfe wrote . Wolfe also alleged that two months before Danny Hernandez was arrested in March , 1993 , he sold a Ferrari for $ 80 # 000 . One month after his arrest , he placed the money into an escrow account in an attempt to buy the Hollywood Hills home of actor Richard Gere . Danny Hernandez enlisted help from the daughter of his civil attorney to open escrow for the home but the deal fell_through , the government alleges . As further proof that the couple should serve harsher sentences , prosecutors say Susie Hernandez -- while awaiting sentencing -- coerced a $ 2 # 000 payment from a real_estate developer and demanded $ 8 # 000 more if he carried_out a scheduled foreclosure of their Laguna Niguel property . Wolfe alleged that Susie Hernandez ' s real_estate_broker called developer Robert O ' Hill last Dec . 9 and threatened to file bankruptcy in_order to delay the foreclosure the next day if O ' Hill did not loan Susie Hernandez $ 15 # 000 . The Hernandezes were to have turned_over all their assets shortly after their arrests . But they continued to flaunt their lifestyles and , according to prosecutors , hid or disposed_of thousands of dollars in assets , including jewelry , custom household_appliances and a membership in a San Juan Capistrano country_club . When O ' Hill said he would consider a smaller loan , the broker suggested O ' Hill come_up with $ 2 # 000 that day and $ 8 # 000 later . O ' Hill agreed to put the deal in_writing , and when he asked Susie Hernandez if she intended to repay the loan , she said she did not intend to do so and would eventually file bankruptcy anyway , the government alleges in court documents . &quot; The government takes the position that concealing assets that the Hernandezes have pledged to identify and surrender in criminal forfeiture represents an obstruction of justice , &quot; Wolfe said . &quot; So does lying to the court and the probation office. &quot;</TEXT>
