   <HEADLINE> FILM_CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES : IT ' S PAT , IT ' S SHORT , BUT JUST WHAT IS IT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s Pat -- or is it ? It seems the fate of Touchstone Pictures ' movie take_on Julia Sweeney ' s sexually amorphic &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; character is as nebulous as Pat his / herself . Sources on the set say that Sweeney ' s one-gender-fits-all screen version , which is scheduled for a Sept . 2 release , has already been clipped to 76 minutes -- with credits . &quot; Geez , the trailer ( promoting the film ) is longer than that ! Maybe they should just show the trailer , &quot; says one source . The average length for a feature_film falls somewhere between 90 minutes and 2 hours , without credits ; credits usually roll for about five or six minutes . &quot; It ' s Pat &quot; is so short now that Touchstone has reportedly asked that another 16 minutes be tacked back onto the picture . Compare that to such upcoming summer fare as Warner Bros. ' &quot; Wyatt Earp , &quot; which is three hours , or the two-hour &quot; Maverick. &quot; But a Disney spokeswoman says the rumors about the film are not true and that Disney is very hopeful about the picture ' s performance at the box_office ; she also pointed_out that the hit &quot; Airplane ! &quot; was only 76 minutes . &quot; The problem with ' Pat ' is not Julia ' s performance , &quot; says one Disney source . &quot; The problem is every scene is the same joke. &quot; That joke being , what is Pat -- male or female ? It ' s a joke that works pretty well in three-minute skits on &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; but is stretched a bit thin over the course of a film . In &quot; It ' s Pat , &quot; Sweeney ' s Pat is living with a crummy job until a mystery person named Chris comes_into Pat ' s life , and they fall_in_love . Chris is as gender-amorphic as Pat , which stymies wedding plans until Pat figures_out what , exactly , Chris is . There is a wedding -- the film ' s big climax -- but the film doesn ' t spill the sexual identity beans . The happy couple are reportedly wed in complementary muumuus . For her part , Sweeney says that the film was always targeted for 80 minutes or under . &quot; I was told it was 77 . . . . We were joking the other day about how it would play in theaters : ' It ' s Pat. ' Now showing at 1 , 2:15 , 3:30 , 4:45 . . . . Theaters ought to be thrilled . They can sell more popcorn with all_of these extra showings ! &quot; Harvey Keitel , who had shot three or four scenes in one day , has been cut from the film , Sweeney says . &quot; The rumor about cutting him out because a test audience hated it isn ' t true . What is true is I had to cut Harvey out and it killed me . He was playing a priest that Pat went_to see for marriage_counseling . But he was a priest on death row that should have been going_to see Pat . It was a very funny device but it just didn ' t work. &quot; Sweeney says she hasn ' t had a chance to even tell Keitel about it yet . Co-starring with Keitel in Quentin Tarantino ' s upcoming &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; Sweeney notes , &quot; I had four scenes but I ' m down to one now . Harvey ' s out of mine , now I ' m out of his . . . almost ! &quot; Also cut were early scenes of Pat ' s life . Addressing the &quot; one joke &quot; criticism , Sweeney defends , &quot; the first 15 minutes are pretty straight-on jokes about gender , but the rest of the movie is a look_at what androgyny is really all about . For example , one of the neighbors falls_in_love with Pat , but is grappling with whether he ' s gay or not . It ' s much more_than one joke. &quot; She says she ' s sensitive about overexposure on the What Is Pat ? joke . She hasn ' t played the character once this year on &quot; SNL &quot; because she didn ' t want to tire the audience before the movie ' s out . And she ' s only played Pat four times a year in the past three years . &quot; I want to keep Pat as a quirky alternative . I want this to be the little movie that could. &quot; So does she know what Pat really is ? &quot; Nope. &quot;</TEXT>
