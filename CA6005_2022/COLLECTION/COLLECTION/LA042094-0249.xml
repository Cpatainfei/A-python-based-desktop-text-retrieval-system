   <HEADLINE> KEVORKIAN ' S ASSISTED-SUICIDE TRIAL OPENS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A jury is slated to decide for the first time whether Jack Kevorkian , famed as &quot; Dr. Death , &quot; has violated Michigan ' s assisted-suicide ban , while the state continues to grapple with the issue of what to allow when the ill want to end their pain by ending their lives . Since the Michigan Legislature made_it illegal in February , 1993 , to help another person commit suicide , Kevorkian has been charged four times with violations , and the total number of suicides at which he has been present has climbed to 20 . Kevorkian has been jailed twice , staging hunger_strikes in protest both times . Three lower-court judges , all for different reasons , declared the law unconstitutional , dismissing charges in the cases before them . But in the fourth case , Detroit Recorder ' s Court Judge Thomas E . Jackson ordered a trial . On Tuesday , in Jackson ' s courtroom , selection began of a citizens ' panel to weigh Kevorkian ' s role in the death of Thomas Hyde , a 30-year-old former construction worker who could barely swallow , speak or move because of the degenerative Lou Gehrig ' s disease . Whatever the outcome , it will not settle the status of physician-assisted suicide here . The Michigan Court of Appeals is still reviewing the ban , and even that long-awaited ruling could be appealed further to the state and U.S. Supreme Courts . The ban itself is a temporary measure , expiring in November . An appointed commission is supposed to report recommendations for a permanent law to the Legislature next month . Meanwhile , Kevorkian has launched a campaign to collect signatures for a separate statewide vote . Janet Good , president of the Hemlock Society of Michigan and a ballot drive coordinator , said 256 # 000 valid signatures must be submitted by July 1 to secure a place on the November ballot . She said 100 # 000 people have signed . If Kevorkian is convicted of the charge against him now , he faces a four-year prison sentence and a $ 2 # 000 fine . If he ends_up behind bars again , he said , he will not fast this time . &quot; I would n ' t give them the satisfaction , &quot; he said . &quot; Janet ! &quot; Kevorkian called , beckoning to Good as prospective jurors in another room filled_out a 12-page , 60-question survey of their beliefs regarding suicide , religion and politics . &quot; If I ' m sitting in jail , how does_it affect the petition process ? &quot; Now be honest , &quot; he said , smiling , as his friend approached . Good laughed , then answered quietly , &quot; It ' d help. &quot; By afternoon , Kevorkian was studying Japanese at the defense table , while the judge and lawyers asked jurors about their families ' health . During a break , Kevorkian said , &quot; This is a play , not a jury trial . This is the only judge in town who doesn ' t know &quot; the law is unconstitutional . Hyde , of suburban Novi , was the first suicide announced by Kevorkian after the ban took_effect . After Hyde ' s death Aug . 4 , Kevorkian , a retired pathologist , held a news_conference , as is his custom . He practically begged to be prosecuted . He even called reporters together a second time , after Wayne County Prosecutor John O ' Hair said he had not provided enough detail to be charged . Recorded on audiotape and by television_cameras , Kevorkian explained that he had driven Hyde to an island park in the middle of the Detroit River . There , in the back of his rusty van , Kevorkian supplied carbon_monoxide and secured a mask over Hyde ' s face . The young_man released a clamp , allowing the deadly gas to flow . Defense_attorney Geoffrey N . Fieger is hoping to introduce another tape -- a video of a conversation between Kevorkian , Hyde and Hyde ' s fiancee , Heidi Fernandez , a month before the suicide . &quot; I want to end this ; I want to die , &quot; says Hyde , thin and shaking in a bright orange T-shirt , on the tape . When Kevorkian asks , &quot; Do you have any reservations ? &quot; Hyde answers : &quot; Oh , no. &quot; &quot; Tom is suffering so , &quot; says Fernandez , a hand on Hyde ' s shoulder . &quot; He wants to be free -- to be free_of this body . His soul will be free. &quot; Prosecutor Timothy Kenny has objected to allowing the jury to see the tape . &quot; Whether Thomas Hyde committed suicide for the most noble of reasons , or whether he did_it for the most unwise of reasons , is really legally irrelevant , &quot; Kenny said . Jackson had not decided yet whether to allow the tape to be played in court . The lengthy jury selection process showed how many people have been touched by the issue of assisted suicide and have strong feelings about it . Jackson dismissed seven members of the 66-person pool who said they thought they could not judge Kevorkian fairly ; all said they did not believe_in suicide . One man told of watching a terminally ill relative suffer . &quot; I prayed for her to die , &quot; he said , &quot; but would n ' t want anybody to help her die , only the man upstairs. &quot; Others , however , said they thought physician-assisted suicide should be legal . &quot; I don ' t believe anyone should suffer , &quot; one said . Another volunteered that he often works with Good and the Hemlock Society . As the court day ended , the jury still had no official members .</TEXT>
