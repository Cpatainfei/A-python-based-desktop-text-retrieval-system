   <HEADLINE> READING , WRITING , THERAPY ; EDUCATION : THE ART OF OPTIMISM . COPING WITH LIVING . MANY SCHOOLS ARE TRYING TO FILL A PSYCHOLOGICAL VOID -- BUT DO THESE SUBJECTS BELONG IN THE CLASSROOM ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s today ' s pop_quiz : What do &quot; Peace Builders , &quot; &quot; Coping With Living &quot; and automated teller-machine training have to do with reading , writing and arithmetic ? How does &quot; Optimism &quot; play_on your kid ' s school transcript ? Exactly what do college admissions committees think when they find_out that your child spent part of his or her senior year learning to balance a checkbook ? Nobody has all_the answers yet . But more and more , touchy-feely programs are popping_up in schools all_over the country . Some focus_on confidence , self-esteem , &quot; negotiation enhancement &quot; or &quot; aggression containment. &quot; Others target diversity , disability , death and divorce . There are coming-out seminars for gay adolescents , symposiums for children of gay parents , AIDS information workshops . Classes in sexual_harassment awareness abound . Some schools even provide quick-hit sessions on table manners . &quot; We think the skills we teach are just like teaching_reading , &quot; said Mark Greenberg , a psychologist at the University of Washington who develops educational_programs . This shift in academic mandate -- call it , for lack of a more pronounceable term , the &quot; psychologization of education &quot; -- has been slow , subtle and largely unheralded . Many parents and educators praise the inclusion of these subjects as an important recognition of the role of education in the 1990s . But others decry it as &quot; psychobabble , &quot; stealing already limited class time and treading_on turf traditionally belonging_to another of America ' s beleaguered institutions , the family . Yet another contingent wonders both about the quality and piecemeal nature of these psychological services . &quot; As our society changes , as families change in the various ways they have changed_over the last 25 years , some of the things one used to assume occurred in the home are not taking_place . Schools have been encouraged , forced , told or directed to pick_up the vacuum , &quot; said Connie LaFace Olson , career equity services coordinator for the Los Angeles Unified School District . &quot; I ' ve seen it much more_than in the past , and I think it ' s really a positive trend , &quot; said Carol Mares , a teacher adviser whose three children attend public_schools in Pasadena . &quot; It ' s little by little giving kids tools with which to work_out their problems as they go_out into the world. &quot; But many of the therapeutic interventions , while well-intentioned , &quot; have a low probability of efficacy , &quot; said Dennis D . Embry , an Arizona psychologist who works extensively with schoolchildren . He said families and educators alike may attach excessive weight to these efforts , reasoning that if a child has studied something in school , there ' s no further reason to pursue it . &quot; It ' s like , ' Johnny , you ' ve had your self-esteem training . Now shut_up , ' &quot; he said . Carol Kelly , president of the National Assn . of School Psychologists in Silver Spring , Md. , said psychologically oriented programs are , for the most part , welcome additions to the conventional school menu of learning . Kelly said recent research shows that &quot; there are a lot of children coming_to school whose lack of social skills gets_in the way of learning. &quot; Howard Weiss , a psychologist who heads the family and school project at the Ackerman Institute in New York City , finds no fault with the premise that as &quot; the business of living &quot; in contemporary society has changed , so have the obstacles confronting schools , parents and students . The problem is , &quot; the discussion usually stops at that point. &quot; Schools have ventured into territory traditionally occupied by the family with &quot; no central set of beliefs , &quot; Weiss said . &quot; The schools have had to take it on , &quot; he added . &quot; It ' s like a relay_race -- you ' re the schools , and somebody passed you the baton . There ' s a sense now that things are going_down a rat hole , and we ' ve got_to plug the hole &quot; with new learning strategies . The makeshift nature of this approach makes long-range success unlikely , said Susan Swapp , professor of education at Boston ' s Wheelock College . &quot; The problems are so pervasive that patchwork , onetime Band-Aid approaches are not going_to do_it , &quot; she said . &quot; You can take all_the programs in the world on self-esteem or sexual adjustment or whatever it is , and if it is not connected to a larger vision of what the purpose of school is , or what the connection between school and family should be , then it is not effective. &quot; But vision is a luxury in a time of educational trench warfare . School administrators never sat_down and hatched a battle_plan for students ' psychological well-being , said Olson , of the L.A. Unified School District . Instead , she said , a ticking grenade of dysfunction and discontent was tossed on their doorstep . &quot; If the question is , ' Why are schools doing this ? ' the answer is , ' Because society is demanding it , ' &quot; Olson said . * Students today enter school with emotional and psychological equipment that is vastly altered from what their parents brought_to the classroom , said Lee Huff , a psychologist at Fountain Valley High_School . &quot; Because of the dissolution of the family_unit , the structure isn ' t there to provide students with any kind of frame_of_reference , &quot; he said . Courses with such titles as &quot; Mediation Training &quot; and &quot; Conflict Resolution &quot; may generate guffaws among academic purists , Huff conceded , but without adult role_models or training , &quot; kids resort_to their peers &quot; -- meaning , they duke it out . Take_a_look around , Huff suggested . &quot; The extended_family seems to have vanished from the scene . I can ' t tell you the number of students I talk to , they don ' t have a grandma , a grandpa , an aunt or an uncle to rely_on for sage advice. &quot; But in Albuquerque , N.M. , Paquita Hernandez replied -- in_effect -- get real . &quot; People aren ' t looking_at the roots of these problems , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' re not looking_at causes. &quot; Introducing school-based programs on self-esteem or aggression is &quot; a way of pacifying our anxiety , &quot; she added . &quot; We ' re looking_at little ways of entertaining ourselves. &quot; Instead , Hernandez points to Celebrate Youth , the independently funded after-school program she introduced to secondary-school students in Albuquerque seven years ago . It pairs students with adult mentors who work with them for a minimum of one year in fields of mutual interest . &quot; You don ' t give people self-esteem through a workshop , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; Self-esteem evolves because you feel competent. &quot; Along with so many other phrases in the current lexicon of public education , competence has become a buzzword . The University of Washington ' s Greenberg , who has worked with public_schools to enhance &quot; thinking skills &quot; and other social problems since 1981 , argues , in fact , that the entire objective of psychologically adjusted curricula is to make students &quot; more socially competent. &quot; He helped launch a program called Fast Track , funded by the National Institute of Mental Health , which is aimed at identifying primary_school students with emotional problems . He bristles if Fast Track or its cousins are described as non-academic . &quot; I don ' t talk_about it as something outside academic work , &quot; Greenberg said . &quot; We think_of it as making children more successful in their academic work. &quot; He added that whereas &quot; 10 to 15 years ago , these were seen as problems only for kids who were ' at risk , ' now they are seen as more generalized &quot; in the school population . Similarly , Greenberg said , the value of social skills training is now more widely recognized in the culture at_large . But Susan Neufeldt , director of graduate programs in the school of psychology at UC Santa Barbara , worries that while &quot; more behavioral things have been put into schools , there are fewer psychologists in the schools. &quot; Neufeldt ' s concerns come from her roles as a clinical_psychologist and as the mother of a 13-year-old girl . &quot; We look_for quick , inexpensive ways of solving problems that have little effect , &quot; she said , adding that too often , teachers conducting socialization or behavioral segments of the school_day have had only minimal training in the subjects . &quot; They don ' t know much about it , &quot; said Neufeldt , an ex-high school_teacher . She cited , for example , a self-esteem seminar she attended at her daughter ' s public_school . &quot; I went_to some of these meetings as a parent , and they were just laughable . They don ' t provide the training or the experts that are needed -- and you ' re just not going_to solve problems of this magnitude with quick hits. &quot; Neufeldt judged the vogue toward psychologization in education harshly , saying it detracts from traditional curricula . But L.A. Unified ' s Olson said that &quot; to suggest that these kinds of trainings are at the expense of academics is probably too broad. &quot; Rather , Olson said , &quot; what I see happening is that some of these issues are covered in the course of a particular subject area. &quot; As examples , she pointed to gender role training that can begin as early as kindergarten , &quot; making_sure that it ' s not always the boys who carry the books to the storeroom &quot; -- and making_sure that boys and girls know they are equally qualified to perform this task .</TEXT>
