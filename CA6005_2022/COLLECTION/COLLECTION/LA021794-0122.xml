   <TEXT> Russia ' s assistant hockey_coach , Igor Dmitriev , defused German press reports claiming that Coach Viktor Tikhonov had been replaced by a third coach who appeared behind the bench for the final_period of Monday ' s 5-0 loss to Finland . The additional coach is Vladimir Yurzinov , who coaches a team in Turku in the Finnish League . He joined Tikhonov and Dmitriev behind the bench again Wednesday , for Russia ' s 9-1 rout of Austria , but Dmitriev said Yurzinov ' s presence does not signal Tikhonov ' s exit . * Canada ' s scouting report for tonight ' s game against the United States should be especially insightful . Canadian winger Paul Kariya played_at the University of Maine with U.S. goalies Mike Dunham and Garth Snow , defenseman Matt Martin and forward Peter Ferraro . &quot; It ' s tough seeing them go_down the ice when you ' re used to cheering for them and for Dunny and Snowy , &quot; Kariya said . &quot; In practice I could tell you where everyone shoots on them or where I shoot on them . But it ' s not like situations like that will come_up in a game. &quot; Said Canadian assistant coach Dany Dube : &quot; We expect them to play tough on him . ( Brett Hauer ) is always all_over Paul . They ' ll probably play really dirty. &quot; * Canadian right_wing Chris Kontos , who counts the Kings among his NHL stops , compared Kariya to another King . &quot; He ' s very Gretzky-like , &quot; Kontos said . &quot; He sees the ice very well and does amazing things with the puck . I ' ve really enjoyed playing with him and with Petr ( Nedved ) . They ' ve given our team a lot more dimensions. &quot; * Jeff Lazaro provided an unexpected moment of mirth during practice when he crashed through the protective plexiglass at Kristin Hall . He had difficulty getting_back onto his feet , but only because he was laughing uncontrollably . &quot; I was just going_to bounce off the boards , &quot; he said . &quot; I didn ' t bounce , it gave way. &quot; Said Snow : &quot; It must be awful weak glass because I know he ' s not that strong . Or else , he should lose some weight. &quot; * Finland ' s 3-0 start , Russia ' s 2-1 record and Sweden ' s 1-0-1 performance have made the hockey seedings nearly irrelevant , says Chuck Grillo , vice_president and director of player personnel for the San Jose Sharks . &quot; We ' ve seen it happen too many times , that the Russians started off badly and ended_up playing for the gold , but maybe this is the year that it won ' t happen , &quot; he said . &quot; From all things I ' ve seen , it looks_like they could have big problems . &quot; What it does is , it throws the tournament open_to the emotional efforts of everyone else . The game is still played with emotion . You can X and O the hell out of it , but it ' s still played with emotion , and the team that realizes that could end_up winning the whole thing. &quot; HELENE ELLIOTT</TEXT>
