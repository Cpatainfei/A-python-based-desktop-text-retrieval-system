   <HEADLINE> DISPUTE DELAYS AIR STRIKES IN BOSNIA ; BALKANS : WHITE_HOUSE WARNS OF LIKELY ACTION . BUT U.N. VETO OF NATO ' S REQUEST FOR ATTACKS UNDERSCORES DIFFICULTIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The White_House warned Saturday that NATO air strikes may be inevitable to halt a rebel assault on a Bosnian enclave , but senior U.S. officials acknowledged that retaliatory action had already been delayed a day because of a dispute between NATO and U.N. officials . After a day of hectic diplomacy that underscored the difficulties of coordinating a military operation burdened with several layers of command , a senior Administration official confirmed that the United Nations had vetoed a NATO recommendation to commence the air strikes Saturday in retaliation for Bosnian Serb attacks on Gorazde that violated a North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ultimatum issued Friday . In an effort to play_down the U.N.-NATO disagreement as merely a temporary &quot; delay &quot; that would not undermine the allies ' resolve , the official said the Clinton_Administration was &quot; close to an agreement with the U.N. on how to proceed &quot; with air strikes . U.S. officials also stressed that the Serbs should not &quot; misread &quot; the delay as a sign of weakness or lack of resolve , adding that strong punitive measures are &quot; inevitable &quot; if the Serbian forces continue to defy the NATO ultimatum . Air strikes &quot; are only a matter of time unless they comply , &quot; one senior official said . Throughout the day , Clinton_Administration aides sought to minimize what had been an embarrassing and inauspicious start to NATO ' s efforts to agree with the United Nations on the timing of what would clearly be a major escalation of U.S. and allied military involvement in Bosnia ' s 2-year-old civil_war . Meeting in Brussels on Friday , NATO officials set three deadlines for Bosnia ' s rebel Serbs . The first called_for an immediate cease-fire , which U.S. and U.N. officials said the Serbs continued to violate throughout the day . The second deadline , which expired at 2:01 a.m. today ( 5:01 p.m. PDT Saturday ) , mandated the withdrawal of all Serbian forces from the embattled city to an area at least 1.9 miles away . The third deadline gives the Serbs until 2:01 a.m. Wednesday ( 5:01 p.m. PDT Tuesday ) to move all their heavy_weapons at least 12 miles away from Gorazde . If the Serbs do not abide_by these conditions , the allies threatened , NATO ' s Southern Command would be authorized to conduct air strikes against heavy_weapons and other military targets within a 12-mile radius of Gorazde . But the agreement also specified that the United Nations would have to approve the air strikes before they went_ahead -- a condition that provoked a behind-the-scenes crisis Saturday . Because the Serbs continued to shell Gorazde after the NATO ultimatum was issued , Adm . Leighton Smith , the NATO commander for Southern Europe , asked_for permission to launch the air strikes before the withdrawal deadline expired , U.S. and U.N. officials confirmed . But arguing that the Serbs with whom he was negotiating in Belgrade needed more time to comply with the ultimatum , Yasushi Akashi , the chief U.N. representative in the region , refused . A senior U.S. source acknowledged that both U.S. officials and NATO commanders were furious with Akashi ' s veto , fearing that it would send &quot; precisely the wrong message to the Serbs that NATO was not serious &quot; about carrying_out its ultimatum . The dispute underlines what critics said are the immense problems posed by giving the United Nations veto power over military decisions involving U.S. and other NATO forces . &quot; We are trying to run a war in which you have about 12 layers of decision-making , and it ' s proving to be pretty difficult , &quot; said former Secretary_of_State Lawrence S . Eagleburger , who was interviewed on CNN ' s &quot; Newsmaker Saturday. &quot; Times staff writer Tyler Marshall in Brussels contributed to this report .</TEXT>
