   <HEADLINE> DEPOSED KING OF CRACK ; NOW FREE AFTER 5 YEARS IN PRISON , THIS MASTER MARKETER WAS KEY TO THE DRUG ' S SPREAD IN L.A.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If there was an eye to the storm , if there was a criminal mastermind behind crack ' s decade-long reign , if there was one outlaw capitalist most responsible_for flooding Los Angeles ' streets with mass-marketed cocaine , his name was Freeway Rick . He didn ' t make the drug and he didn ' t smuggle it across the border , but Ricky Donnell Ross did more_than anyone else to democratize it , boosting volume , slashing prices and spreading disease on a scale never before conceived . He was a favorite_son of the Colombian cartels , South-Central ' s first millionaire crack lord , an illiterate high_school dropout whose single-minded obsession was to become the biggest dope dealer in history . Working around the clock , taking the age-old axioms of good business to ominous extremes , he transformed a curbside operation at 87th and Figueroa into the Wal-Mart of cocaine . While most other dealers toiled at the bottom rungs of the market , his coast-to-coast conglomerate was selling more_than 500 # 000 rocks a day , a staggering turnover that put the drug within reach of anyone with a_few dollars . &quot; You know how some people feel that God put them down here to be a preacher ? &quot; asked the 34-year-old ex-con , his hands clasped as if in prayer . &quot; I felt that he had put me down to be the cocaine man . that ' s how my environment had twisted my mind and molded me . I was so flipped out that I believed I was the Chosen One. &quot; To run an organization of that magnitude , Ross says he relied_on a personal staff of 15 to 20 henchmen , most of whom were paid $ 1 # 000 a week to serve as bodyguards , lookouts , drivers , money counters , crack cookers -- even garbage_men , whose only task was to dispose_of incriminating evidence . Day after day , they ' d pick_up million-dollar shipments in armed convoys of inconspicuous cars , one of which was always poised to speed off as a decoy . An $ 18 # 000 system of walkie-talkies , linked to a private channel , kept their movements synchronized . Back in the neighborhood , Ross had dozens of buildings scattered about to conceal his operation , including a warehouse with police scanners and iron bars , a cook house with digital scales and a restaurant-quality gas_stove , a money house with a one-ton safe and currency-counting machines , a rock house with an underground tunnel leading from a closet to the street , and a party house with a satellite dish , NBA-caliber basketball_hoops and a maid . One day in 1986 , Ross laid all his money on the living room floor and , after hours of furious tabulation , found himself staring at a $ 2.8-million mountain of cash . His enterprise grew so large -- and so completely unfettered by police pressure -- that Los Angeles authorities eventually recruited an elite squad of detectives for the sole mission of shutting Ross down . So zealously did the &quot; Freeway Rick Task_Force &quot; hunt its quarry , however , that the officers were accused of crossing into the underworld themselves , allegedly planting cocaine on suspects and lining their own pockets with illicit cash . Their 34-count federal indictment , a case that became part of the worst corruption scandal in local law_enforcement history , gave Ross an unexpected bargaining_chip when he was finally arrested for smuggling cocaine to Cincinnati in 1989 . In exchange for testifying against the cops who once stalked him , crack ' s dealer to the dealers walked_out_of prison in September after just five years . Now back home , living under his mother ' s roof in Carson , Ross remains unrepentant about the destruction his exploits have wrought . He sees himself not as a villain but as a slave to his own consuming addiction -- to the adrenaline rush of closing a multimillion-dollar deal , to the manic life of a high-stakes trafficker . &quot; I did this all day long , 24 hours a day . . . just like the smoker , &quot; Ross said . &quot; When I couldn ' t do_it , I was_sick , I ' m talking_about sick . Psychologically , I ' d be crushed. &quot; Although he has no dearth of skeptics predicting a relapse , Ross says he wants to redirect his energy -- and rebuild his fortune -- by constructing a South-Central arts and sports complex for the next generation of potential crack dealers . It ' s not so_much a moral epiphany as a pragmatic adjustment . Having determined that the drug trade is a no-win proposition , he ' s simply looking_for a safer game with better odds . Most police officials are dubious about Ross ' motives , suspecting him of trying to buy a veneer of respectability , like so many Mafiosi who have used legitimate ventures to conceal illicit gains . What authorities don ' t doubt is Ross ' ability to insinuate himself back into a community he once exploited , to seize any opportunity that will give him the upper_hand . &quot; That was a guy who could sell Popsicles to an Eskimo , &quot; said San Fernando Police Lt . Ernest Halcon , a veteran undercover detective who has tracked some of Southern California ' s most notorious dope dealers . &quot; You want to say he ' s a low-life , no-good piece of crap . But you got_to respect some of these guys for their ambition and cunning . You got_to give the_devil his due. &quot; The saga of Ricky Ross ' rise and fall begins in 1979 , when PCP was the drug of choice and cocaine was only for the rich . Ross was 19 , a car thief of modest repute who used to strip his spoils in the shadow of the Harbor Freeway , which is how his moniker stuck . One day , while cooling his heels after an arrest for grand theft auto , he went_to visit a friend who had just come_home from college . &quot; He ' s like , ' Man , I ' m onto something new , ' &quot; recalled Ross , who stared in disbelief as he was handed a $ 50 rock . &quot; I was a square . I didn ' t even believe it was cocaine. &quot; Eager for a new hustle , though , Ross ventured out and showed_off his acquisition to an old pimp , who fired it right up and ordered $ 100 more . That day , Ross said , he knew he was going_to be rich . To get his foot in the market , Ross stole a car -- from the faculty lot of his alma_mater , Bret Harte Junior_High . He sold the rims for $ 250 , which bought him nearly an eighth of an ounce of crack . By peddling the rocks individually , he reaped a $ 500 return on his investment , which he continued to &quot; double_up , &quot; turning the $ 500 into $ 1 # 000 , and so on . &quot; I didn ' t really understand what I was doing , but I knew I didn ' t want the life my mother lived . . . welfare , no car , waiting till the first of the month to have milk and cereal , &quot; said Ross , the son of poor East Texas farmers . &quot; I knew there had to be something in the world I could do , something that I could be the best at. &quot; that ' s when Ross made his first economic discovery -- the power of volume . Like a supermarket that buys_in bulk , thus selling its product cheaper than any mom-and-pop store , Ross began sinking everything he had back into dope , marveling each time as the unit price dropped . By the end of the decade , he had helped cut wholesale rates from $ 60 # 000 a kilo to just $ 10 # 000 . What truly set Ross apart , however , was the intensity of his focus . While others relished the fast_lane , Ross cruised incognito in a Brady Bunch-style station_wagon with simulated-wood siding . He never dipped_into his own supply , nor did he drink or wear jewelry . A tireless salesman , he lived for the next deal , negotiating with a cellular_phone pressed against each ear and a pager , he says proudly , &quot; that used to sing like a bell. &quot; &quot; It got_to the point where I enjoyed selling drugs so_much that I could be in bed with my woman and , if the right person paged me , I ' d get_up , &quot; said Ross , who is small and wiry at just 145 pounds , with wide eyes and a gleaming smile . &quot; I wasn ' t even conscious of what $ 2 million was anymore . I wanted $ 10 million . I wanted to set a record. &quot; First in Los Angeles , then during his cross-country sojourns , Ross used charisma and caginess to cross boundaries that had never been breached . Often he ' d win_over turf by donating a_few ounces of crack to the area ' s top dope dealer or gangbanger . Sometimes he ' d show_up in a new place and announce a &quot; smoke party , &quot; spreading the word that free rocks would be given to the first arrivals . In his native Texas , one of several states where Ross had legal trouble , he took_advantage of old family ties by shipping cocaine to twin cousins . As implausible as it sounds , Ross insists he never resorted_to violence to keep a grip on his dominion , though he often took his 9-millimeter pistol to the firing_range and maintained an arsenal of fully automatic Uzis equipped with silencers . Neither was he a true gang member , though he came from a Crips neighborhood and didn ' t mind if their fearsome reputation helped ward_off competitors . Law_enforcement authorities say it is naive to believe that Ross ' organization never killed or maimed . But Ross contends that his business was simply too good to get caught_up in bloodshed . If he got ripped_off , he says , he would write_off the loss rather than avenge it . If a rival thought Ross was encroaching , Ross used his low prices to turn the competitor into a client . By the time the market exploded in 1984 , Ross already was dealing directly with the Colombian cartels , who supplied him with 50 to 100 kilos a day . With that , Ross was able to operate dozens of rock houses , catering to thousands of addicts across Los Angeles . He had another three &quot; ounce houses , &quot; servicing 100 to 200 mid-level dealers . Finally , he had his own private list of V.I.P. customers , maybe 30 to 50 big-time dealers , who dropped tens of thousands of dollars at a time . &quot; There ' s no question about this man ' s ability to market and merchandise things , it ' s unbelievable , really , &quot; said Officer Robert Enoch , a 40-year police veteran in Sharonville , Ohio , a suburb of Cincinnati . &quot; He was instrumental in putting this whole_thing into motion -- and it ' s still here . I just don ' t want him back. &quot; Like his celluloid hero Priest , the slick and stylish pusher in the movie &quot; Superfly , &quot; Ross also believed that he was just one lucrative deal away from leaving the business behind . To help make that jump , he built an 18-unit motel , the Freeway Motor_Inn , then opened a tire shop , the Big Palace of Wheels . He bought a $ 250 # 000 home_in Inglewood , which he paid_for entirely in $ 1 bills . Among his final purchases was the old Adams Street Theatre , now gutted and in foreclosure , which he still hopes to convert someday into a youth center called the Freeway Academy . Fashioning himself into an inner-city Robin_Hood , Ross also began making donations to South-Central ' s Algin Sutton park , where he installed new basketball_hoops and bought eggs every year for the neighborhood Easter_egg hunt . At his mother ' s South-Central church , Ross paid_for new pews and an air conditioner . Every morning , he says , he stuffed his pocket with at least $ 1 # 000 in cash to hand_out to anyone needing help . It was not guilt that drove Ross to give_back to his community . Rather , he dispensed gifts just the way he marketed drugs -- commodities to be traded for power and respect . &quot; I was the star of the ghetto , &quot; he said , &quot; or at least I felt_like it. &quot; One night in 1987 , the Freeway Rick Task_Force almost caught Freeway Rick himself , chasing him into a South-Central alley , where he managed to hop a fence and escape on a passing RTD bus . As Ross fled , according to the officers , he shot at them and dropped a kilo of cocaine . But as part of a massive money-skimming investigation that brought_down more_than two_dozen sheriff ' s anti-narcotics deputies , federal prosecutors contended that it was the officers who opened_fire on an unarmed Ross , then planted a kilo from their own car . Although many of the most serious corruption charges were later dismissed , Ross ' testimony was rewarded with parole after serving less than half of his 10-year interstate trafficking sentence . &quot; Ross will fall again someday , &quot; predicted former nemesis Stephen W . Polak , an ex-LAPD officer who pleaded guilty in October to misdemeanor civil-rights violations . &quot; Let him pay_for all_the people his drugs have killed , let him put money into the hospitals for all_the addicted babies , let me see him turn_over a_million or two to the IRS and get a job . . . then maybe I ' ll give him some credibility. &quot; After doing his time for the Cincinnati conviction , Ross served another eight months for his Texas case , which brought his story full circle back to Troup ( Pop . 1 # 659 ) , the cradle of Jim Crow servility his family exchanged for the promise of California when he was 4 . When Ross was paroled three months ago , he revisited his old boyhood home , now a blistered wooden shack , abandoned on a stretch of piney back road in an overgrown field abuzz with cicadas . On that steamy late-summer afternoon , as he sat on the sagging front_porch , he took_stock of how far he had traveled before succumbing to his own success . A bandit entrepreneur who once had it all -- 14th-row Lakers season_tickets , a 38-foot speedboat docked at Marina del Rey , ski lessons in Aspen -- was now empty-handed . As difficult as it is to fathom , Ross insists his money was consumed by legal_fees , rip-offs and bad investments , made worse by signing contracts he couldn ' t even read . Dozens of friends , many of whom had known_nothing of crack until he introduced them to the trade , are now condemned to jail_cells for decades to come . Because of Ross , they barely know their own children , just as his children -- seven of them altogether , by four different mothers -- barely know him . &quot; Everybody loses , &quot; Ross said , his head bowed , tears streaming from his eyes . &quot; A guy who thought he was so smart had been a fool all that time. &quot; Now as he lays the groundwork back in Los Angeles for a slew of seemingly pie-in-the-sky projects , from producing a rap album to promoting a prize fight , Ross is convinced that the world of legal commerce can be his oyster . The difference , he says , is the positive new philosophy he ' s gleaned from a most unlikely source , Anthony J . Robbins , the fire-walking self-improvement guru of infomercial fame . From Robbins ' teachings , which Ross says he studied while learning to read in prison , he ' s discovered he can help others -- and make millions too . In that respect , Freeway Rick hasn ' t changed so_much since his heady days as the cocaine king . Although he ' s vowed never to revert to selling drugs , he ' s still an unadulterated hustler , doing all he can to relive the thrill of hitting it big . Only this time , after the smoke has cleared , he intends to be holding the prize . &quot; Don ' t you understand ? I ' m still sick behind this stuff , &quot; Ross said . &quot; I need my fix. &quot;</TEXT>
