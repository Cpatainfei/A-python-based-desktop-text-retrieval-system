   <TEXT> Under cover of darkness , Americans fled escalating warfare in Rwanda by convoy late Saturday , a senior U.S. official said , while hundreds of U.S. Marines gathered_in neighboring Burundi to help rescue foreigners from the ethnic bloodletting and civil_war . With a cease-fire between Rwanda ' s rival Tutsi and Hutus quickly falling_apart , President Clinton expressed concern about the &quot; tragic situation &quot; and about the safety of the approximately 250 U.S. citizens in the small Central African_nation . Rebels belonging_to the Tutsi-aligned Rwandan Patriotic Front undertook an offensive north of Kigali , the capital city , the Reuters news_agency reported . Fighting involving heavy artillery was said to be raging along a hilly region best known as one of the last homes of the rare mountain_gorilla . The rebels claimed to have advanced to within 10 miles of the capital . Meanwhile , Americans and other foreigners were moving south &quot; on anything with four wheels that moves , &quot; a senior U.S. official said . Their destination was approximately 100 miles away in Bujumbura , the capital of neighboring Burundi , and the Associated Press reported that about 300 of the refugees -- American and European -- arrived there safely late Saturday and early today . Two other convoys of Americans spent the night at a Danish mission station at the border between the two countries , U.S. military officials said . The escape route through the southern part of Rwanda is relatively stable . U.S. officials said 170 Americans had left the capital and that 85 were still in Rwanda as of late Saturday . Roughly 300 U.S. Marines were sent to Burundi on Saturday , &quot; basically there to assist if anything starts to go_wrong , &quot; the senior U.S. official said . The Marines were dispatched from U.S. warships in the Indian_Ocean off Somalia . In addition to the Marines , the Defense_Department said that three huge CH-53 transport helicopters had been flown to Bujumbura along with four KC-130 tanker planes , which can be used as transports , and that four C-141 jet transports were sent to Mombasa , Kenya . If needed , the troops could aid in mass evacuations -- possibly today -- of about 1 # 500 Belgian , 600 French and the remaining 85 U.S. citizens in Rwanda . &quot; The situation in Rwanda remains tense , and a sharp escalation of fighting has been reported in the capital city , &quot; State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said Saturday . &quot; The United States is taking steps to evacuate Americans from Rwanda , with the cooperation of local authorities. &quot; Rwanda , roughly the size of Maryland , is one of the poorest nations in Africa . It has been convulsed by violence since its president , Juvenal Habyarimana , and the president of Burundi , Cyprian Ntayamira , were killed late Wednesday when the airplane in which they were flying crashed as it approached the Kigali airport . The government said the plane was brought_down by rocket fire from unidentified forces . The two leaders , both Hutus , were returning from a regional summit in Tanzania intended to end years of violent spasms that have taken the lives of tens of thousands of the majority Hutus and minority Tutsi . Belgium said it had sent elite paratroop units to Rwanda , its former colony , and French troops were said to have taken_up positions in central Kigali . There were conflicting reports about whether the contingent of about 300 French paratroopers had succeeded in securing the airport . Col . Luc Marchal , commander of Belgian forces serving with a U.N. peacekeeping unit , said Rwandan government forces opposed to the international effort later blocked the runway with firetrucks . But in Paris , the Foreign Ministry said that French troops had evacuated 43 nationals by air and that other rescue flights are planned . Dr. Pierre Harze , a spokesman in Paris for the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders , said the wounded and the dead in Rwanda ' s capital &quot; can be counted by the thousands. &quot; &quot; There are a huge number of bodies in the street , &quot; he told the Associated Press , relaying a report from staff_members in Kigali . Belgian television , which has two correspondents in Rwanda , carried several eyewitness reports Saturday that provided a picture of mounting confusion . In one account from Kigali ' s main hospital , medical coordinator Fabienne Dorlencourt described scenes of horror . &quot; I ' ve seen about 150 bodies here , but the real figure ( for the area around the hospital ) is likely to be 300 to 400 , &quot; she said . &quot; The wounded seem to have been injured mainly by machete and grenade attacks . It ' s total anarchy. &quot; Prisoners were ordered to dig mass graves for the victims , Radio France Internationale reported . Western diplomats were trying to reach all foreigners by radio to urge those willing to risk an overland journey to make their escape . U.S. personnel and their dependents -- roughly half the Americans in Rwanda -- were ordered to leave . Missionaries make_up most of the rest of the U.S. population there . A senior U.S official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said that once the evacuees reach Bujumbura they are to be flown to Kenya . &quot; It is mostly a civilian operation , with cooperation from local authorities and Rwandan security , &quot; he said of the convoys . &quot; There ' s a lot of refugee traffic under way. &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher conferred by telephone throughout the morning with Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , and Anthony Lake , Clinton ' s national security adviser . He also spoke early Saturday with the U.S. ambassador in Rwanda , David Rawson , to discuss options for &quot; the ordered departure of U.S. personnel , their dependents and other American citizens , &quot; McCurry said in a written statement . &quot; There are no reports of specific threats against Americans in Rwanda , &quot; McCurry said , adding that as of midday in Washington , &quot; things are proceeding smoothly. &quot; The State_Department spokesman said the United States was participating in informal discussions in the U.N. Security_Council on the violence in Rwanda , the safety of foreigners and the status of the U.N. mission there . In his weekly radio address , Clinton said he is &quot; deeply concerned about the continuing violence following the assassination of the president , the prime_minister and other officials , as well as some of our United Nations peacekeepers &quot; in Rwanda . Similarly , he said , he is &quot; very concerned &quot; about the safety of the Americans there . &quot; I want you to know that we ' re doing all we can to ensure their safety , &quot; he said . In Kigali , the Speaker of the Parliament , Venat Sindikubwabo , announced the formation of an interim government . The Speaker , an ally of Habyarimana , the assassinated president , said on state radio that he is forming the government to restore order and that he wants to contact the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front to set_up a transitional government within six weeks , Reuters reported . The overture to form the transitional government was rejected by the rebels . &quot; The RPF has irreversibly decided to fight this clique . . . . Let us work together to find and bring_to book these murderers , &quot; Paul Kagame , the rebels ' military_leader , said in a statement said to have been broadcast repeatedly by a rebel radio_station . Anyone standing in the way of the rebel front , he said , &quot; will be considered an accomplice of the murderers and dealt with accordingly. &quot; Killed in the latest round of violence were Prime_Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana , a Tutsi , and other political_leaders , human_rights advocates , aid workers , nuns , priests , ordinary Rwandans and 10 Belgian soldiers , part of a 2 # 500-member U.N. peacekeeping unit . Rwanda was a colony of Belgium that gained its independence in July , 1962 . The rebels began their violent campaign , which has resulted in thousands of deaths , with an invasion from Uganda in 1990 . Isabelle Maelcamp , a researcher in The Times ' Brussels Bureau , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
