   <TEXT> I miss Bullock ' s . Well , I don ' t exactly miss Bullock ' s . I miss the Bullock ' s building . Oh , I bought a_few things at the Northridge store over the years , as did my wife ; I think I ' ll always remember the light green leisure suit I bought there in the ' 70s , which I loved ( did I really wear that to teach classes at CSUN ? ) . What I really miss though , is the structure , the architecture , which was taken_away from us so rudely by the earthquake . There was something about that building that caught my eye every time I drove by on Tampa Avenue , whether or not I had any business at the Fashion Center . Many , many times I looked_at it in its off-kilter stalwartness , squatting amiably to anchor one end of the mall . What possessed a department_store designer to come_up with such a profile ? My fancy always said it was the name of the store that inspired the design . Bullock ' s . The sound of it , the animal imagery of it . Heavy , low , sturdy , strong . Rounded in its squareness with all those facets meeting one another at odd , unpredictable angles . * I never analyzed exactly how all those flat planes came_together ; I don ' t think there was a symmetry to it . that ' s why it always was a surprise to look_at it . And yet it held its place firmly , like a bullock , overlooking the remainder of the stores . I ask myself why I miss it more_than a building I actually used more frequently and that has been totally gone now for weeks : the Kaiser Permanente pharmacy and clinic at Balboa and Devonshire . My wife and I always had our prescriptions filled there , utilized the services of optometry there fairly often . It was astonishing to see what the quake did to that building . The sides of it completely slid off from the central structure , leaving it looking as though bombs had hit it . To find it a_few weeks after the quake gone , entirely demolished with nothing left , not even debris -- just a vacant_lot -- was also breathtaking , a building that had been there so many years , seen so many uses . But miss it ? Not at all . Yes , we ' d have to travel_to Panorama City or Woodland Hills now for prescriptions -- we ' d miss the convenience . But the building ? It had nothing to distinguish it . It would certainly be another matter too if the Oviatt Library on our Cal State Northridge campus should , God forbid , turn_out to need total replacement . It was the architectural centerpiece of the university , warm , lofty , ambitious . It would be more_than missed , it would be as though a dagger had been sent to the heart of the institution . No one will feel the campus is fully itself until the Oviatt is ready to open its doors again . * Reports now say Bullock ' s will take the longest of the Northridge Fashion Center stores to reopen , and it must be completely rebuilt . Its completion is not expected until the summer of 1995 . That doesn ' t sound unreasonable considering the devastation . I wonder if those geometrically shaped facets coming_together at odd angles weren ' t especially vulnerable to the thrusts and shifts of the earth ' s movements , each surge putting the junctures into unbearable stress upon one another . would n ' t it be the way -- the building ' s especial satisfactions for the eye also proving to be its weakest links in resisting an earthly onslaught ? What will the newly designed store look_like ? I don ' t know . I could hope for the old look in some ingeniously reinforced manner . But I suppose not . Meanwhile , among the unsung losses from the Northridge quake exist such nonquantifiable and nonfleshly , yet human , matters as a lost building upon a landscape . Commercial ventures go_on within it to serve a public ' s needs . But services to the heart and spirit , no less needed , were etched upon its face .</TEXT>
