   <HEADLINE> VICA FORUM ISSUES CONFIDENT FORECAST FOR ' 95</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite the financial and psychological toll of the Northridge earthquake , San Fernando Valley business_leaders Friday forecast a robust Valley economy next year , citing the area ' s resilience and efforts by government to become more business-friendly . The optimistic assessment came from business owners and elected officials meeting at an annual economic forecasting conference sponsored by the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. , a prominent group with more_than 400 members . &quot; They are really upbeat about 1995 , &quot; said Ben Reznik , a Sherman Oaks attorney and past chairman of VICA , who contrasted the rosy outlook with the group ' s gloomy economic assessment a year ago . &quot; Last year was a real downer , &quot; Reznik said . In forecasting an upturn in the Valley economy next year , bankers cited increased deposits from clients , real_estate experts pointed to a stable property market and entertainment firms predicted new jobs from the expected addition of new television networks and movie-making studios . To buttress their assessment , several business_leaders also pointed to a rousing Christmas shopping turnout last weekend in which Californians spent nearly 10 % more_than they did a year ago . And Southern Californians outspent their counterparts in the northern part of the state . &quot; In my opinion , the worst is over , &quot; said Carla Gazzolo , senior_vice_president of Los Angeles-based CB Commercial Real_Estate Group , who cited the &quot; resiliency of the Valley &quot; as a factor supporting an upturn in the local economy . Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan -- the conference ' s keynote speaker -- joined in the sunny forecast . &quot; The Valley has bounced_back with pride and confidence , &quot; he said , adding that he will try to cut bureaucratic red_tape for businesses and strive to make city department_heads more accountable for financial mistakes . Beyond the confidence in psychological factors , the basis for projecting an upturn was more difficult to discern . Some executives suggested that federal emergency dollars and insurance settlements to repair quake damage will help kick-start a spending cycle that will rejuvenate the local economy . However , a recent economic analysis estimated that the quake caused $ 357 million worth of damage to businesses in Los Angeles and that federal and local aid -- not counting insurance awards -- will provide only about $ 50 million for repairs . Others disagreed_with the theory that quake-repair money will be a significant economic stimulant , saying recovery dollars will probably provide only enough of an infusion to counter the negative impacts of the quake . &quot; I ' ve been here 20 years and I ' ve seen other earthquakes , &quot; said Walt Mosher , VICA chairman and co-owner of Pacoima-based Precision Dynamics . &quot; My personal opinion is that it will have a net zero effect. &quot; But Mosher said he is optimistic that last month ' s elections brought new leaders to state and federal_government who will be more sympathetic to the concerns of business owners , such_as workers ' compensation reform . &quot; There is a lot of emphasis , since the elections , to get_down to work , &quot; he said . John Marquis , executive_vice_president of TransWorld Bank , the Valley ' s oldest and largest independent bank , said deposits are up 20 % this year and the bank ' s net_income has jumped 86 % . Observing that small businesses in the transportation , construction , export , defense , computers and other high-tech industries are growing , and predicting that unemployment will drop further next year , Marquis declared : &quot; Now is the time to look_at investing in Southern California. &quot; But not all_the assessments were positive . A representative of Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. , California ' s largest home builder , predicted higher home prices , in part due_to new seismic-safety regulations that are likely to be imposed on builders . &quot; My prediction is a tough year in 1995 , &quot; said Mark Beisswanger , president of Kaufman &amp; Broad ' s regional division . &quot; I expect higher prices. &quot; Others said the high cost of health_care and burdensome government regulations threaten to stifle the improved economy . Toward the end of the conference , VICA heaped praise and took shots at government officials as the association announced its choice for the three best and three worst government decisions this year . &quot; If Mr. Blackwell can choose the best- and worst-dressed people of America , then we ' ve decided to have a little fun , &quot; said David Fleming , a VICA member and city fire commissioner . VICA praised the federal_government for supporting the North_American Free_Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) and the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , both of which would boost the local economy , Fleming said . But the association blasted the Environmental Protection Agency for proposing local air-quality regulations that Fleming said could cost the region $ 200 million . State lawmakers were honored for taking steps to reform the state ' s much-maligned workers ' compensation system but jeered for failing to solve all its problems . &quot; The bleeding has lessened but the patient is still critical , &quot; Fleming said . Finally , VICA credited Los Angeles city officials for working quickly and effectively in helping quake victims recover from the disaster without imposing too_much bureaucratic red_tape . But it blasted the city ' s workers ' compensation system as well , which is backlogged with nearly 40 # 000 claims , the equivalent of one for every city employee . The association supports Riordan ' s call to assign an outside regulator to oversee the system , which administers work-related injury claims from city employees .</TEXT>
