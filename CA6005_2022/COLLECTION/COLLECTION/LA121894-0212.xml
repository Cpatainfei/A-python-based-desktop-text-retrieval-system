   <HEADLINE> DON ' T BE TOO QUICK TO CRANK_UP B-2 ; PRODUCTION_COSTS FOR THE STEALTH BOMBER AND ITS ' SILVER BULLET ' COULD BE ENORMOUS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over the years , during the many debates over the merits of the B-2 Stealth bomber , there has been one constant : The arguments have been surprisingly nonpartisan . During the governor ' s race , for example , Kathleen Brown voiced her support for the continuation of production of the B-2 , which is built_in Pico Rivera and Palmdale . That led to a quick reaction by the campaign offices of Pete Wilson , who said that the governor has been one of the aircraft ' s staunchest supporters . Some of the strategic bomber ' s best_friends in Congress have been Democrats , including powerful Sens . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) and Daniel Inouye ( D-Hawaii ) . Moreover , during the last presidential race , the B-2 was not a political issue at all . Both the Republican incumbent , George_Bush , and the eventual winner , Bill_Clinton , said during the campaign that they would go no further than the current order of a fleet of 20 of the radar-eluding planes . We must note here that we agreed . In 1992 , we said that President Bush ' s scaling back of the enormously costly B-2 program and other nuclear_weapons programs amounted to a significant contribution to world peace . So , we were a little surprised over the sudden gush of optimism about the B-2 ' s production prospects that were generated by two recent events . The first was the Republican takeover of both houses of Congress , which led B-2 defense_contractor Northrop Grumman to offer to sell the government 20 more Stealths at a fixed price of $ 11.4 billion . The second event was the addition of Rep . Howard P . ( Buck ) McKeon ( R-Santa Clarita ) to the House National Security Committee . Crank_up B-2 production ? Not so fast . There are a_few other matters_to take_into_account . One is the Pentagon ' s cancellation , just this month , of Northrop Grumman ' s $ 13.3-billion advanced stealth missile program . The missile had been planned as a &quot; silver bullet &quot; to be carried by -- you guessed it -- the Stealth bomber . The Pentagon and Deputy Defense_Secretary John Deutch said that the missile ' s development delays and skyrocketing costs had made_it &quot; too expensive a silver bullet. &quot; And in September , a congressional study of the bomber by the General Accounting Office contained an important warning . Testing delays and problems with the B-2 ' s radar-evading technology , its terrain avoidance radar and its computer software were threatening to raise the costs of the first 20 bombers beyond a government-imposed ceiling of $ 44.4 billion . We suggest that these recent disclosures will figure as heavily , if not more so , in any talk_of refueling the B-2 production_line . Hold the champagne .</TEXT>
