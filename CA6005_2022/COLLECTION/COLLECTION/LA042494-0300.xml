   <TEXT> Condolences poured in from around the globe as world leaders paid tribute Saturday to Richard Nixon as an international statesman who achieved diplomatic triumphs from Moscow to Beijing . Nixon continued until the end of his life to offer behind-the-scenes advice to many of the world ' s powerbrokers , including in a controversial visit to Moscow just last month . In an unusually warm statement Saturday , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin said : &quot; I am shocked by the death not only of an extraordinary man but also of one of the greatest politicians in the world . &quot; I became convinced that he was one of the first major world politicians who have understood Russia , and understood what it was fighting for , &quot; Yeltsin said . &quot; He had a special attitude toward Russia . He was deeply concerned about our developments . . . . I really respected him sincerely and with all my soul and regarded him as one of the most influential politicians in the United States. &quot; The statement said a Russian presidential representative will be sent to Nixon ' s funeral . Yeltsin ' s remarks contrasted with his angry reaction when Nixon arrived in Moscow in March and met with several of Yeltsin ' s political archenemies . Yeltsin later lifted a ban on Russian government officials meeting with Nixon but did not himself receive Nixon . Shortly before his fatal stroke , the former President was discussing the possibility of a return visit to meet with Yeltsin , Nixon ' s adviser on Russian affairs said Saturday . Dimitri K . Simes said Nixon had been approached from &quot; senior levels of the Russian government &quot; to learn whether the ex-President would be willing to travel_to Moscow . &quot; He was willing to go provided that it was also certain that the invitation came directly from Yeltsin , and that this time there would be no misunderstandings , &quot; Simes said . Yeltsin ' s press office said Saturday evening that it was not aware of any such discussions . &quot; It was a matter of pride to him to be able to respond to insults when necessary , but to stay above them in the purpose of a higher interest , &quot; Simes said in a telephone_interview from Washington , where he heads the Russian program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . Nixon , a frequent visitor to Moscow and one of Yeltsin ' s earliest champions , felt his mission was &quot; being effective on behalf of Russian democracy , &quot; Simes said . Former Soviet leader Mikhail S . Gorbachev also expressed his condolences to Nixon ' s family , saying : &quot; Nixon ' s contribution to the search for an end to the Vietnam_War and , of course , his efforts in reducing the arms race and lessening international tension will enter into history. &quot; Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk fondly remembered Nixon ' s visit to Kiev last month . &quot; Mr. Nixon deeply understood the problems facing Ukraine in establishing statehood , and sincerely tried to facilitate their resolution , &quot; he said . &quot; The Ukrainian people give heartfelt thanks for his friendship and cooperation. &quot; In China , where Nixon ' s &quot; Ping-Pong &quot; diplomacy led to the reopening of U.S. relations with the world ' s most populous nation , top leaders praised the former President for bringing both countries closer . In a telegram of condolence , President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng hailed Nixon as &quot; a politician with strategic long-term vision and political courage ( who ) . . . opened the door for a new era in Sino-American relations. &quot; Tang Wensheng , who interpreted for Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Premier Chou En-lai during Nixon ' s historic visit to Beijing in 1972 , echoed that view . &quot; History has proved , &quot; Tang said in a telephone_interview Saturday , &quot; that the bold decision to normalize Sino-U.S. relations was wise and farsighted. &quot; Chinese national television began its Saturday night news_programs with the report of Nixon ' s death . The New China News_Agency described Nixon , who visited China five times after his historic February , 1972 , trip , as &quot; an old friend of the Chinese people. &quot; Particularly saddened were the Zheng family , owners of a popular &quot; Western-style &quot; restaurant near the entrance of the Qing Dynasty Summer Palace on the outskirts of Beijing . Although its Chinese name is Wei Lan , the restaurant is popularly known as &quot; Nixon ' s Restaurant &quot; because of a 1985 visit the former President paid during a personal investigation of market reforms in China . A large photograph of Nixon and chef Zheng Weizhi hangs prominently on one wall of the restaurant . &quot; Since he came_in and had a picture taken with my father , &quot; said Zheng Haibin , the chef ' s son , &quot; business has done very well . We owe our success to him. &quot; Vietnam ' s Foreign Ministry had only a one-sentence reaction to Nixon ' s death : &quot; May he rest in peace. &quot; Northern Vietnamese remember Nixon as the man whose bombers pounded the big cities of Hanoi and Haiphong during the Vietnam_War . &quot; We won ' t grieve over his death , &quot; said retired soldier Hoa Van Tap , 63 , who now repairs bicycles on Hanoi ' s streets . &quot; But the war is over and he is dead , and as we say , ' Although there is hatred , death is the end. ' &quot; A government official said ordinary Vietnamese no longer had special feelings about Nixon . &quot; He belongs_to history , the history of the Vietnam conflict , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t think we have any personal feelings in favor of or against Mr Nixon . He did what he had to do. &quot; General Vo Nguyen Giap , architect of the Communist victory in that war , was not available for comment on Nixon ' s death . In Phnom Penh , an adviser to both of the Cambodian prime_ministers said the Cambodian people would not look_back on Nixon with ill_will . Nixon initiated a secret bombing campaign against Cambodia to eliminate sanctuaries for Vietnamese Communist rebels during the war and ordered a joint U.S.-South Vietnamese invasion of eastern Cambodia . &quot; Even if he did something bad to Cambodia in the past , we should not recall it now because it brings us nothing , &quot; said Muon Saokhan , adviser to First Prime_Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime_Minister Hun Sen . In other reaction from around the world : * British Prime_Minister John Major , in a message to President Clinton , paid tribute to Nixon &quot; for his tireless work for a better understanding between East and West . He was a leading architect of the process which led to the end of the Cold_War , and his judgment of international affairs was widely respected. &quot; Queen Elizabeth_II sent a message of condolence to Nixon ' s family , but Buckingham Palace did not release details of the message . * Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Nixon had defied the world by supporting Israel in the 1973 Mideast War . &quot; Israel lost a friend . I personally lost a personal friend , &quot; Rabin told army radio Saturday , adding that he first met Nixon in 1966 and had maintained a close relationship till the very end . * Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa praised Nixon ' s efforts to improve post-World War II relations , particularly the 1972 return of its southernmost island , Okinawa . &quot; We feel deep sorrow for losing the U.S. leader , who marked an era in the postwar international political scene , &quot; Hosokawa said in a statement . * French President Francois Mitterrand ' s office quoted a message of sympathy to Nixon ' s older daughter , Patricia Cox , as saying : &quot; I am convinced that history will remember the great role that ( your father ) played_on the international stage. &quot; * Philippine President Fidel V . Ramos expressed sadness at the death and praised Nixon ' s initiative to ease tensions and open dialogue at the height of the Cold_War . * Australian Prime_Minister Paul Keating said Nixon had improved U.S. relations across the Pacific . &quot; He corrected United States foreign_policy misjudgments of the late 1940s , particularly in_relation_to North Asia , &quot; Keating said .
