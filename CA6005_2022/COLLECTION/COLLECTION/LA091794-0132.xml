   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : SOUTH COUNTY ; MOUSE HANTAVIRUS THREAT CONTINUES , OFFICIALS WARN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Health officials are reminding people in South County who find mice in or around their homes to use extra caution because two mice recently were found carrying a deadly strain of hantavirus . The virus has killed 45 people nationwide . The two latest mice with hantavirus in Orange County were trapped in the Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park near Lake Forest and on the back_porch of a San Juan Capistrano house , said James Webb , a vector ecologist with the Orange County Vector Control District . &quot; We ' re concerned that deer_mice are invading people ' s back yards , &quot; Webb said Friday . Webb said people who encounter mice droppings or carcasses should use sanitary means to remove them , and not stir_up dust . Dr. Hildy Meyers , an epidemiologist with the Orange County Health_Care Agency , said people should wear gloves while using a solution of bleach and water to cleaning_up mice feces or dead carcasses . Vacuuming or sweeping should be avoided , she said . &quot; The only value of this announcement is to remind people that hantavirus is still here , &quot; Meyers said . &quot; It should not cause people to panic. &quot; There are no documented cases of people contracting hantavirus in Orange County , Meyers said . Statewide , six cases are known , and three of those people were believed to have contracted the virus in New Mexico and Washington state , Meyers said . The disease causes breathing difficulties and fills the lungs with fluid . It is fatal about 50 % of the time . Since June of last year , the county has been setting traps in various parts of Orange County to catch mice and test them for hantavirus . Before the two latest finds , the most recent discovery of a mouse carrying the virus was in Irvine on April 29 , Webb said . JEFF BEAN</TEXT>
