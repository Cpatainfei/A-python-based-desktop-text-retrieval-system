   <HEADLINE> RUBEN BLADES ' PANAMANIAN PIPE_DREAM ; THE SINGER-ACTOR FINDS THE SPOTLIGHT IS HOTTER WHEN YOU ' RE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ruben Blades -- salsa star , Hollywood actor and Panamanian presidential candidate -- is walking along the cracked red-brick streets of San Felipe , the ramshackle barrio in Panama_City ' s old quarter where he grew_up . &quot; Hey , Ruben ! &quot; residents call_out from their stoops and cluttered balconies . &quot; Va pa ' lante ? &quot; they ask , an inquiry about the state of Blades ' campaign . Is it going well ? &quot; We ' re behind , but don ' t give_up , &quot; he tells them . Blades pauses to take a seat on a green wooden bench under the cypress_trees of Plaza Herrera , in the heart of San Felipe . Old_women stop to chat , remembering Blades as a child , discussing the neighbors who have come and gone , lamenting the decline of the community . &quot; He always loved music as a boy , &quot; says 81-year-old Juana Avila , wearing a brown floral dress and melon-colored tennis_shoes . &quot; I always said he was going_to be a singer. &quot; Blades , an icon in the music world who combines brains , street smarts and sex_appeal to chronicle the human condition , is widely credited with taking salsa into the American mainstream . He crossed into movies in 1985 ' s &quot; Crossover Dreams &quot; and has appeared with some of Hollywood ' s biggest names . His political dreams have long been known to those close to him , and now , despite formidable odds , he is acting_on them . Blades has come_home to Panama , a home he has not lived_in for nearly 20 years . He has put his artistic career on pause in the pursuit of what skeptics would call a pipe_dream . He is not just any refugee returning to a onetime war zone in the tropics : Blades wants to be president . He has moved_into a renovated , early 20th-Century apartment overlooking the Bay of Panama in a part of town that is slowly gentrifying -- returning , he says , to the closest thing to his roots . He still clicks with the people in the old neighborhood , for whom Blades ' pop status has made him a sort of hero . But can Blades parlay a fame and fortune earned primarily in the United States into a victory in the most important election in Panamanian history ? &quot; Everywhere , you see one thing in common with all_the people you talk to , &quot; he says after our stroll . &quot; Their need to talk_about problems and the need for change . I am not here to tell anyone how they should be , but I do have an obligation to myself to be of consequence . I know the streets well , and it worries me a lot what I see because I do not see hope in certain faces . It doesn ' t depress me . It inspires me. &quot; As he reconnects to his past , Blades is hoping to change , radically , Panama ' s future . His candidacy is riding largely on his promises to break the country ' s seemingly endless cycle of dictators and toadies . Most of his opponents represent , one way or another , the past . One leading candidate is a product of Gen . Manuel Antonio Noriega ' s political_machine ; another is a throwback to the pro-American oligarchs who periodically run the country . When it was first rumored last year that Blades would enter the presidential race , he rocketed to a huge lead in public_opinion surveys . No other candidate even seemed to register . But as the May 8 elections approach , Blades has fallen dramatically in the polls , sinking as low as third place though he recently rebounded to second . The local press either ignores or attacks him and he ' s had a hard_time convincing many Panamanians that he is serious . He has been accused of being arrogant and aloof and many of his supporters are abandoning him . Blades knows he is getting criticized , yet he is determined to run the campaign as he sees fit . He says he will do politics in a new and different way , even if it means losing the election . PANAMA IS SUCH AN ECCENTRIC AND OUTLANDISH PLACE THAT A SALSERO president is not totally out_of_the_question . This is the country where -- almost 4 1 / 2 short years ago -- U.S. troops invaded to overthrow a military dictator who had been_on the CIA payroll for years . Revolution then was being waged by people in BMWs , the ringleaders of subversion were Chamber_of_Commerce businessmen and one of the most galvanizing atrocities committed by the dictator ' s goons was burning a Jaguar dealership . This is a country where governments can be involved in scandals from drug trafficking to gun-running , and no one seems to bat an eye . Where the 54-year-old president marries a student , barely half his age and a fraction of his weight , who then runs_for mayor with an opposition party . It is a haven for money launderers , fugitives and deposed Central_American leaders , who , as in the case of ousted Guatemalan autocrat Jorge Serrano , live_in opulent homes and do lunch at the elite Union Club . This is a country where part of national territory -- the Canal Zone -- was actually foreign territory , a U.S.-controlled swath that Panamanian citizens could not enter without permission . U.S. dollars serve as the national currency , even though Panamanians pretend they have their own bills , called balboas . And right now , this is a country that is seething . Noriega ' s fall signaled the end of two decades of military dictatorship and raised hopes of democracy . But President Guillermo Endara -- who won the 1989 elections that Noriega annulled and was later put_in office during a ceremony at a U.S. military base -- never seemed to get_the_hang of it . For many , his attempt at democracy bore too many of the same traits as the dictatorships -- corruption , nepotism and injustice . And his free-market policies seemed to deepen poverty for those on the bottom , while the rich just got richer . One in every five Panamanians is unemployed and about one in four lives in poverty . The groundswell of discontent seemed to invite an outsider candidacy in the presidential elections , which will be the first in decades to be free_of military oversight and will largely determine whether democracy is going_to take_root in this country of 2.5 million . &quot; The system failed , &quot; says Blades in a two-hour interview conducted principally in Spanish . &quot; After the invasion , everyone was promised that things were going_to be different , that ( the government ) was going_to be serious , it was going_to be efficient , there was not going_to be corruption , that things would get fixed . Much was promised . Very little was accomplished. &quot; Blades is seated now on the white-on-white sofa in the living room of his second-floor apartment . A breeze coaxed from the fans whirling on cathedral ceilings rustles through the potted palms . The apartment , built with the colonial-era foundations and walls that are typical in Panama ' s Casco Viejo , or old quarter , is decorated in a mix of antiques and modern bleached wood . Golden and fuchsia bougainvillea drape from the wrought-iron balcony . The 45-year-old entertainer no longer sports the mustache he wore in &quot; The Milagro Beanfield War &quot; and his hair is thinning . On this Saturday morning , he is dressed in spotless white sneakers , jeans and a teal polo_shirt that sets_off his hazel eyes . &quot; This is the period when we most need a response that is different from the traditional , &quot; Blades says . &quot; And it is precisely the most difficult moment to present a response that is different because the people no longer believe_in political answers . The people feel very betrayed -- disappointed , yes , but more_than that , betrayed . ( Our movement ) is an anti-party . More_than a simple change of party , we are trying to present a change in attitude , in political behavior. &quot; POLITICS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN UNDERCURRENT IN BLADES ' LIFE AND work . His family abandoned Panama in 1973 after Noriega accused Blades ' father , a secret policeman at the time , of working for the CIA . ( His father said the charge was false , and , of course , it was Noriega who worked for the CIA. ) Ruben Sr. , with his Cuban-American wife ( also a singer and composer ) and Ruben ' s four siblings moved to Miami , and Ruben followed the next year . He later moved to the Northeast , where his music career blossomed and he earned a degree in international_law at Harvard_University . Blades achieved megafame in New York -- first with bandleader Willie Colon and then with his own group , Seis del Solar -- as an innovative artist and two-time Grammy winner who elevated salsa from mere dance_music to the realm of social protest . His music is quintessential salsa -- congas , maracas and horns -- but under the driving rhythm are lyrics like these from &quot; Motherland &quot; on Blades ' 1988 &quot; Antecedente &quot; album , which he dedicated to Panama : * Some time ago a child asked me to explain the word motherland , what did_it mean ? . . . It ' s in the walls of our barrio , and in its brown hope ; it ' s what those who leave take_in their souls ; it ' s in our martyrs ' voices when they defended our flag . . . * In 1986 , he moved to California to build his film career . He appeared in &quot; The Two Jakes &quot; with Jack Nicholson , a dozen or so other Hollywood productions and is in the upcoming &quot; Color of Night &quot; with Bruce Willis . Blades , whose surname comes from his father ' s West Indies ancestors and is pronounced like razor blades , says he is not concerned about suspending his artistic career , although he winces at having to turn_down a film offer to portray slain Brazilian environmentalist Chico Mendes . Agent Nick Stevens of United Talent Agency says he is confident his client can resume a film career at any time . &quot; He ' s timeless , &quot; Stevens says from Los Angeles . &quot; His career is not one of momentum . He ' s always gone_off to do other things . I ' ve always known that Ruben was interested in helping his homeland and his people above and beyond anything he was doing_in the entertainment business . I always thought ( the candidacy ) was inevitable on some level. &quot; The candidate says he always planned to enter public_service . As a student at Panama ' s National University some 25 years ago , Blades and his friends talked politics and plotted their grand schemes for changing their country , the singer recalls . Many of those friends have joined him in the presidential campaign . For Blades and the others , the 1964 anti-American demonstrations in which U.S. troops killed 21 Panamanian students had a lasting impact ; Blades ' platform calls_for a gradual withdrawal of American troops by the year 2000 -- as scheduled in the 1977 canal treaties -- despite substantial public sentiment in favor of retaining U.S. military bases . The first formal step_in his political odyssey was to create a party in late 1991 . Named Papa Egoro , which means Mother Earth in the indigenous Embera language of Panama ' s Choco Indians , the party brought_together a diverse group of people . Its ideology could not be easily labeled : Infused with an ecological motif , the party ' s platform advocates liberal social programs and better distribution of wealth , but also encourages business and private investment . After its flashy start , however , his presidential bid is troubled . Blades has been criticized for an air of aloofness , not contributing his own money to the underfinanced effort and for conducting a campaign that has been , at times , strangely quiet . The low profile , he says , is part of a carefully considered strategy . &quot; Our silence is the silence of he who is studying and writing , he who is preparing to offer a proposal , &quot; Blades says . &quot; What has always gone_on here is superficial politicking . People who have never entered a certain neighborhood are suddenly there , with a knot of people , with flags and giving_away things . &quot; For me , the most important thing is to have the plan ready . You win , and what do you do afterward ? Improvise ? Not me . I do not want to win that way . The situation is too urgent and when the time comes that people want you to solve their problems , charisma won ' t work. &quot; As the election approaches , Blades has started traveling the country and making more public appearances . He performed well in Panama ' s first-ever televised presidential debate last month . He still fluctuates between second and third place , however , having trailed the front-runner by as_many as 25 points . The question remains whether he can make_up the lost ground . AIDES IN THE CAMPAIGN CLOSE TO BLADES SPEAK OF HIS &quot; UNIQUE style , &quot; his determination to shun everything conventional in politics . They also speak_of a stubborn streak . He rejects their advice to get_out more , to capitalize on his best assets -- the admiration and goodwill many people feel toward him . Many Panamanians have become disenchanted with Blades . Back at the Plaza Herrera in San Felipe , Eddy Pelletier , a pianist on the birthdays-and-private-parties circuit , sidles up and takes a seat by the candidate . He wants to vote for Blades , he says , but the campaign has been something of a mystery to him . &quot; We want to help but we don ' t know how , &quot; Pelletier tells Blades . &quot; We ' re lost . We are people who want change but we feel_like we ' re not being taken_into_account . I listen to all_the news on TV and radio , and I haven ' t heard a thing ( about the Blades campaign ) . And there are a bunch of people like me. &quot; But there are moments when the celebrity entertainer and the candidate blend . Blades has recorded the Papa Egoro campaign theme_song , a classic salsa arrangement that tells people &quot; the change is coming. &quot; The tune is getting air time on Panamanian radio_stations . Ending one lull in his public appearances , Blades drops_in on a post-Carnival salsa festival to greet his old buddies from Puerto Rico ' s Gran Combo orchestra . Sponsored by the Panama Kiwanis Club , the festivities open with elaborate , sparkling floats that glide down oceanfront Balboa Avenue , carrying beauty queens decked_out in mammoth headdresses of multicolored feathers . The music follows and Blades arrives , pushing his way through a crowd clearly delighted to see him . Bats are dive-bombing under a full_moon as he strides onto the bandstand to greet the musicians , famous in this part of the world for their classic , &quot; Brujeria &quot; ( &quot; Witchcraft &quot; ) . The men embrace . The crowd roars . &quot; Amame toda la vida , &quot; Blades sings , dancing a_few steps_in more-or-less unison with the graying salsa stars , &quot; Love me for a lifetime. &quot; Backstage , one person after another puts an arm around Blades , takes him aside , slaps his back or confides a memory . Many relay their concern that he is behind in the polls . &quot; Don ' t worry , &quot; he tells them . &quot; Little by little. &quot; A television personality in a purple miniskirt comes_up_to shake his hand . &quot; You have my vote , &quot; she whispers in his ear . He is called_back for an encore with the band and again the crowd is ecstatic , hooting and cheering . No political speeches are given , no mention of the election . The concert is televised , however , so Blades has just gotten some free publicity . But is it the image he wants to convey ? Already , cartoons in the unfriendly local press portray him as a pair of maracas . IF BLADES IS A STAR ATTRACTION in this race , there are plenty of sideshows that are threatening to upstage him . First , there is The Bull . Silver-haired and thick-necked , Ernesto Perez Balladares has marched to the head of the polls as the candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party , the onetime political arm of Gen . Noriega . His towering bulk earned him the universally used nickname &quot; El Toro. &quot; The thousands of Panamanians who are cheering Perez Balladares are not asking_for Noriega to return . They are angry at the Endara government , which they see as elitist and racist . They have been hurt by rising unemployment , cuts_in public-sector benefits and declining buying power . The Democratic Revolutionary Party , declared dead when Noriega was captured after the 1989 invasion and jailed in Miami on drug charges , has expertly managed to exploit the discontent . Its association with Noriega and the military , however , frightens some people , and opponents are hoping to use that against Perez Balladares , a tireless campaigner and multimillionaire businessman and coffee exporter . Perez Balladares is trying to distance the party from Noriega and emphasize its historical ties to Gen . Omar Torrijos , the larger-than-life strongman who overthrew an elected president in 1968 and governed until his 1981 death in a still-mysterious airplane crash . Despite his iron-fist rule , Torrijos was admired by many Panamanians because of his attention to the poor . This is evident in the lower-middle-class neighborhood of Juan Diaz , on the outskirts of Panama_City , where a rally for Perez Balladares is getting under way at dusk . Hundreds of people filling the roughly paved streets to greet El Toro remember that Torrijos built the neighborhood , helped them own homes and gave them electricity . &quot; PRD , toda la vida ! &quot; shouts Vilma de Cedas , a 59-year-old mother of seven who is dressed in party colors of red , white and blue . A band of trumpets and drums marches along , playing festive Carnival songs as the crowd lets_loose . While the elections mark the resurrection of Noriega ' s old party , they also have ushered_in the demise of the ruling center-right coalition installed after the U.S. invasion . Endara is ineligible for another term , leaving coalition members to fight bitterly over who should be its candidate , until finally the alliance split . The parties are running separate candidates , including the remarried widow of Arnulfo Arias , a legendary civilian politician who was thrice elected president in the 1940s and ' 60s and was thrice overthrown by the army , and Ruben Dario Carles , the 73-year-old former comptroller known for his cantankerous personality and tightfisted management . Carles also served in government in the 1950s and represents those Panamanians known as rabiblancos , a pejorative term for the white aristocracy that periodically -- and currently -- rules over the mostly dark-skinned populace . With his trademark bow_tie , Carles ( said to be a favorite of the U.S. Embassy because of his eagerness to pay the foreign debt ) is showing considerable strength in polls , at times surpassing Blades . Both are still far behind Perez Balladares , however . The ghosts that haunt Perez Balladares and Carles can work to Blades ' advantage because he does not bring similar baggage to the race . But Blades is dogged by criticism about his long absence from the country . He has a credibility problem among those Panamanians who ask where he was when they were here suffering . How can he understand Panama ' s problems ? Blades , who says he visited Panama through all_the years he lived_in the States , maintains it is not necessary for him to be here constantly to know what ' s going_on . That is what Papa Egoro is for . &quot; It is true that I got_off a plane from California , &quot; he says . &quot; The good news is that the party did not get_off with me . The party is from here in Panama . It was made here in Panama , formed by Panamanians , its proposals are Panamanian. &quot; Besides , he adds , &quot; I don ' t think those who have been here ( all along ) have done such a good job. &quot; His credibility problem is worsened by the fact that his wife , California native Lisa Blades , has not moved to Panama from their home_in Santa Monica . Some Panamanians wonder how serious Blades can be if his wife lives in another country . The 31-year-old actress has visited Panama to help her husband campaign . But in a telephone_interview from Santa Monica , she is noncommittal about making a permanent break from California . Credibility is also an issue , Blades acknowledges , with professionals , some intellectuals and other Panamanians who have wanted to dismiss him as nothing more_than a singer . &quot; We called people from the professional ranks ( to join the party ) , but they didn ' t come , &quot; Blades says . &quot; They didn ' t come because they weren ' t sure. &quot; But Blades also says that the same politicians who attack him as unfit to be president offered him a place on their tickets . A spokesman for the PRD confirms that the party had proposed a possible alliance , but nothing came of it . &quot; The same people who were calling us folkloric , bohemians , leftists , improvisers , madmen , musicians , lined_up , lined_up , to say , ' Well , for the good of the country , we ought to consider forming alliances , ' &quot; Blades says , bitterness in his voice . THIS POLITICS BUSINESS HAS turned_out to be much more difficult , much more challenging than Blades expected . Harder than touring , he says . The Papa Egoro movement has been plagued by desertions of disgruntled members who say that Blades and other senior leaders of the party are acting like a private club -- a tightknit cabal of intellectuals who control all decisions and where being a Friend of Ruben is what counts most . &quot; Papa Egoro is not a political_party , &quot; says Milagros Yanis , a former party official who resigned in 1992 . &quot; It is a grouping of people where one single person decides everything that is said or done . If Ruben leaves , Papa Egoro does not exist. &quot; Blades says most of the complaints come from people who did not get the kind of access and power they wanted . Even in a democracy , he says , someone has to make ultimate decisions . The most serious rifts , he says , spring from the diversity of the people brought_together in Papa Egoro . &quot; I am friends with the guy who lives_in Curundu and the guy who lives_in Paitilla , &quot; Blades says , referring to one of Panama_City ' s poorest slums and one of its most elegant residential_areas . &quot; With one , I went_to school ; the other I knew later . So when the guy from Curundu and the guy from Paitilla meet in a room , we are not only deciding a political agenda but also resolving suspicions that exist among different economic groups in Panama -- racism , sexism , everything . This is a cultural change , and that is not easy. &quot; Blades has had a rocky relationship with Panamanian newspapers and television_stations , which are largely controlled by traditional political_parties or business interests , the Establishment whose nose Blades so enjoys tweaking . Carlos Mendoza would be considered part of that Establishment . He is the publisher of the Panama America newspaper and sits on the board overseeing the return of canal lands to Panama . Mendoza does not support Blades , but he thinks he could be more successful if he could overcome his reticence . &quot; There is something naively messianic about Ruben , &quot; Mendoza says . &quot; If he could be himself , let his true personality out , he would be a much better candidate . He could sell his personality and people would love it. &quot; Blades is sensitive to the attacks , which range from accusations that he is stingy for not putting his own money into the campaign ( &quot; The value of my ' fortune ' has been very exaggerated . People think that because I made a movie with Jack Nicholson , I was paid the same as Jack &quot; ) to the fact that his wife is a blue-eyed , blond American . Blades came under more criticism for interrupting the campaign to rush back to Santa Monica after the January earthquake , which damaged his house . An Op-Ed piece in one newspaper , lamenting the death of Panama ' s political class , referred to Blades as a &quot; tourist in Creole politics. &quot; &quot; If what we are doing is madness , then it is a noble madness , &quot; he says . &quot; We must do this independent of whether we win or not . We lose if we do not try . The artist does not see impossibles. &quot; Most of the time , Blades speaks in an energetic , animated flurry , where he might take_on the speaking parts of several characters in a story he is telling , or hunch_over to imitate a jockey riding in the race of his life . But then , as we talk_about the past , he becomes quiet . When he returned to Panama last year , he recalls seeing a hardness and desperation in the eyes of many people , an emptiness that reminds him of a young boy he once met on Panama ' s Coiba penal island , a hellacious prison he visited in 1973 as part of a university thesis . He is moved by the recollection . He fights tears . &quot; You cannot maintain yourself at the margins of this , &quot; he says . &quot; The moment comes when you have to reach a decision . You are living better than the people you wrote ( songs ) about . And there is something in that which is not good . &quot; The time comes you have to put yourself in the line_of_fire , you have to earn the right . You ' re sitting_up in your pretty house , playing the guitar and singing about the people below . Well , go_down below where they are . that ' s what we are doing . For me , it is a moral question , a question of integrity. &quot;</TEXT>
