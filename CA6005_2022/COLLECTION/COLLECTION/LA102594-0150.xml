   <HEADLINE> VIGILANCE IS STILL THE WATCHWORD ; INVESTING : THE SEC ' S PROPOSED NEW RULES WOULD AID CUSTOMERS . MARKET OFFICIALS SAY BUY-AND-HOLD POLICY IS BEST FOR INVESTORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the Justice_Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission look_into problems on Nasdaq , what can small investors do to protect themselves in the over-the-counter market ? For the moment , at least , Ron F . Keller of San Jose has chosen the most extreme solution : He says he has decided to stop buying Nasdaq stocks , even though some of the country ' s fastest-growing companies are listed there . Nasdaq has become the nation ' s busiest stock_market , with an average daily volume of nearly 300 million shares . As reported last week , the Justice_Department ' s antitrust division has said it is looking_into alleged anti-competitive practices on Nasdaq , including possible price fixing by market makers . Nasdaq and market makers have strongly denied there is any collusion . Keller , a 59-year-old mechanical_engineer who was forced to stop working because of medical problems , says he has spent much of his time over the last year trading Nasdaq and New York Stock_Exchange stocks in his individual_retirement_account . But Keller says that in the last nine months , he has come_to realize that spreads as wide as half a point on a $ 10 stock make the possibility of near-term profits remote . ( Spreads are the gap between the price market makers are willing to pay to buy a stock and the price at which they are willing to sell. ) Efforts to get inside the spread by placing limit orders -- orders to buy or sell only at a specified price -- haven ' t worked for him . Keller says he came_to the decision to stop buying Nasdaq stocks on Oct . 14 , after watching an interview on CNBC that led him to decide to buy shares immediately in Cyrix Corp. , a Richardson , Tex.-based maker of microprocessors . He says he put_in a limit order to buy 500 shares of the stock at $ 37.50 , right in the middle of the spread of $ 37.25 bid , $ 37.75 asked . And as he continued to watch the TV screen , with the Nasdaq price tape flashing across the bottom , he saw trades being reported right at his price and better . Yet his limit order was never filled . Keller , who uses deep-discount broker Waterhouse Securities , says his limit orders are almost never filled for Nasdaq stocks . &quot; I feel I ' m being treated unfairly , &quot; he says . John Chapel , the brokerage ' s president , says the failure to execute the order was an inevitable consequence of the &quot; extreme fragmentation &quot; of the Nasdaq market . He says Waterhouse sent the order to an independent market maker for execution , but because that dealer wasn ' t actively trading_in Cyrix at the time , the limit order wasn ' t filled . But if the SEC goes_ahead with plans to impose strict new protections for small investors ' limit orders , this problem is likely to be greatly improved . The SEC approved some new protections for customers ' limit orders in June . If it approves a proposed next step , as seems likely , the cardinal rule for small investors on Nasdaq will be to place limit orders , as opposed to ordinary &quot; market_orders &quot; to buy_at the prevailing market_price . Market_orders are almost always filled at the quoted bid or asked price , seldom in between . * Under the new rules , market makers would no longer be allowed to let customers ' limit orders sit while they trade for themselves at better prices . So investors such_as Keller would have a much better chance of getting their limit orders executed , thus circumventing the wide spreads . However , the proposed SEC rule would not require market makers to accept limit orders at all , raising fears that some might stop doing so . Nor would the new rules fix the highly fragmented nature of the Nasdaq market , which has multiple market makers for each stock and many separate computer_systems handling orders for the same stocks at_the_same_time . This means , for example , that a customer placing a sell order through one brokerage_house may still not get_it filled even though a matching limit order to buy_at that price is sitting unfilled at another brokerage_house . Experts say brokers seldom tell customers about the advantages of limit orders . Kevin D . Clark , vice_president for trading at Milwaukee-based Heartland Value Fund , says that &quot; retail ( stock ) brokers in_general don ' t want their clients to realize they can buy stock in between &quot; the spreads by placing limit orders . One reason , he says , is that if the customer pays a lower price , the broker gets a lower commission . Even with the improvements proposed by the SEC , customers will still need to be vigilant . Veteran traders say investors should do as much independent research as possible about stocks before investing , and be especially wary of brokers who call them touting stocks , particularly if the broker says he can get_it for you at a reduced or no commission . Often , brokers get hidden payments known as &quot; sales credits &quot; from their firms ' trading desks for selling certain Nasdaq stocks -- which customers seldom find_out about . This occurs , for example , when a trading desk wants to get an unwanted position in a stock out of its inventory and calls_on the brokers to sell it to the firms ' retail customers , in_effect paying the broker a bonus for doing so . As a result , the broker may have a personal financial motive to push a stock that is not in customers ' best interests . Michael Dayan , 71 , owner of a dressmaking company in New York , contends in documents filed_in an arbitration case that he learned this lesson the hard way . His broker , Jonathan Lyons , at brokerage_firm Gruntal &amp; Co. , heavily recommended Candela Laser Corp. , a Nasdaq stock . In April , 1992 , Lyons allegedly told Dayan that Candela was a &quot; definite &quot; takeover_target . ( In fact , the company is still independent , and the stock , which Dayan bought_at prices above $ 12 a share , is currently trading for less than $ 3. ) Based on the recommendation , Dayan in three transactions bought 53 # 500 shares of Candela . The confirmation slips Gruntal sent to Dayan after each trade showed that he had paid $ 17 # 134 in_commissions . But documents obtained in the arbitration case show that , including the hidden sales credits to Lyons , the commissions totaled $ 27 # 490 . Harry D . Frisch , a lawyer for Gruntal , denied that Gruntal breaks any rules by not telling customers about the extra sales credits it pays to brokers , a position the National Assn . of Securities Dealers has generally agreed with . Lyons has denied any wrongdoing . Jonathan Kord Lagemann , Dayan ' s lawyer , says the only way customers can find_out about the hidden credits is to ask -- and hope the brokerage_firm gives an answer . Often , he says , brokerage_firms refuse to disclose the sales credits to customers . * Veteran traders say that among other things customers can do to protect themselves : * Invest in mutual_funds instead of directly buying Nasdaq stocks . Mutual_funds are usually able to buy Nasdaq stocks at prices inside the wide quoted spreads . * Follow the advice of the NASD ' s president , Joseph R . Hardiman : Buy and hold Nasdaq stocks for the long term ; don ' t do a lot of short-term trading . &quot; Individuals should not trade a lot of stocks in the Nasdaq market , &quot; he says . By holding growth_stocks for the long term , the initial cost of spreads and commissions becomes much less significant . But Harold Bradley , chief trader for the $ 27-billion Twentieth Century group of mutual_funds in Kansas City , Mo. , among others , says the steps individual investors can take are not enough . He says there must be additional action by securities regulators and even by Congress . One step the securities industry has so far adamantly opposed is moving to &quot; decimalization &quot; -- quoting stock prices in hundredths of a dollar instead of what many market experts view_as an archaic system of eighths . For most stocks , the smallest allowed spread , or price move , is one-eighth , or 12.5 cents . Under decimalization , already widely used in foreign stock_markets , the smallest move would be one penny . So prices of anywhere from , say , $ 20.01 to $ 20.99 would be possible . Advocates of decimal pricing say the current system of eighths keeps spreads artificially wide . It also hinders competition on price , since one dealer competing with another may_not be willing to drop its price an entire eighth , but might be willing to cut it by a penny or two . Bradley and others say there should also be a move to one centralized computer_system for handling Nasdaq limit orders . Such a centralized book already exists on the so-called auction markets , such_as the NYSE . NASD Chief Operating Officer Richard G . Ketchum has said such a move would undermine Nasdaq as a &quot; dealer &quot; market in which multiple market makers compete on each stock , because it would hurt the market makers ' profitability . But Bradley notes that most Nasdaq market makers themselves , as well as big institutional investors , now heavily use Instinet , a computerized system owned by Reuters , which in_effect is a centralized limit-order book for the big players . It enables them to trade with each other instantaneously , getting prices inside the wide spreads . Small investors and even some small market makers don ' t have access to it . * How likely is it that there will be major changes on Nasdaq ? The Justice_Department investigation is in its early stages , sources say , and price-fixing cases are often difficult to prove . Even if the department isn ' t able to bring an antitrust_case , however , Junius W . Peake , a finance professor at the University of Northern Colorado and a former vice_chairman of the NASD ' s board of governors , says he thinks the spotlight put_on Nasdaq by the antitrust inquiry is likely to spur the SEC and the NASD itself to bring_about changes , especially to narrow spreads and give more protection to small investors . The SEC ' s division of market regulation has direct responsibility for overseeing the NASD . It has come under some criticism in recent years for not cracking the whip more strongly . Critics note that there are longstanding relationships between SEC market regulation officials and the NASD . Ketchum , the NASD chief operating officer , is a former SEC chief of market regulation . Brandon Becker , the current chief of market regulation , confirms that he is a personal friend of Ketchum ' s and that the two in recent years have socialized at each other ' s homes . But both Becker and Ketchum strongly deny that this has had any influence on SEC regulation of the NASD . SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr . has indicated in public SEC meetings that he is anxious to move more quickly to remedy some inequities on Nasdaq . In the meantime , investors and even executives of companies whose stocks are listed on Nasdaq say the market , divided up into 510 market-making firms for more_than 4 # 800 stocks , is difficult to understand , sometimes preventing public investors from making intelligent decisions about buying and selling stocks . About This Series The electronic Nasdaq market has grown_into the nation ' s busiest marketplace for buying and selling stocks , with trading volumes exceeding those of the better-known New York Stock_Exchange . Nasdaq is where investors trade shares of Intel , Microsoft , MCI , Apple Computer and other leading firms , as well as those of hundreds of smaller companies . Critics are questioning the fundamental fairness of Nasdaq ' s trading system , however , and the Justice_Department has begun investigating alleged price fixing and other illegal activities .
