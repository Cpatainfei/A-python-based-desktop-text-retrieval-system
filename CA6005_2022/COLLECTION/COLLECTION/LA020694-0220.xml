   <HEADLINE> CRANK_UP THE COLORS ; ARMED WITH BLAZING SIX-STRINGS AND SUPER POWER AMPS , METALLICA , OZZY AND OTHER ROCK ' N ' ROLL HEROES ARE LEAPING FROM THE LARGER-THAN-LIFE CONCERT STAGE TO A WHOLE NEW FANTASY_WORLD : COMIC_BOOKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For generations , rock ' n ' rollers have dreamed of being the Beatles or Stones . But now some of them are trying to out-muscle Batman and Superman . No , Metallica hasn ' t started wearing capes and Ozzy Osbourne can ' t leap tall buildings in a single bound , but they ' ve each got the one thing that certifies super-hero status : their own comic_book . In an ambitious appeal_to rock fans and comic fans alike , the first four issues of Rock-It Comix have swooped upon comic_book shops , music stores and newsstands . The magazine-size books are the newest series from Westlake Village-based Malibu Comics . Most of the company ' s non-rock comics take_place in an &quot; Ultraverse &quot; populated by well-muscled heroes with names like Sludge and Firearm , as well as fiendish villains such_as Bloodbath and Bruut . Rock-It stories are more likely to begin on a tour bus , and might describe the adventures of a wailing guitarist beset by fiendish censors . In the first batch of rock comics , the exploits of Metallica , Ozzy and metal queen Lita Ford are all detailed in explosive , full-color artwork , while the story of upstart record company World Domination is told with striking black-and-white paintings . The current release of the first four titles gives Rock-It its kick-off , and monthly releases are now planned throughout 1994 . Metallica ' s historical retrospective will be spun through three special issues , with Part Two coming_in March . A Black Sabbath book is scheduled for release this month , with a Megadeth book also coming_in March . In all , nearly 30 bands have become interested in working with Rock-It , and confirmed forthcoming titles will cover such diverse acts_as Santana , Pantera , Pharcyde , the Doors , Yes , PM Dawn and the Lemonheads . Many groups have provided exclusive photos and interviews to for their comic sagas . The flesh-and-blood rockers depicted in the Rock-It line couldn ' t be happier about being rendered two-dimensional -- they helped to create their books . Ex-Runaway Ford even helped write her own story , in which she , her band and her faithful dachshund Chili_Dog do battle with the oppressive forces of Libby Snore ( almost rhymes with Tipper Gore ) -- leader of the PMRC and commander of some zombie-like Young Republicans . Ford also oversaw the artwork for her book , which was done_by respected comic illustrator Jim Balent . She ' s thrilled with the results . &quot; It ' s almost like having an album out . There ' s the same level of excitement . Fans are coming up and saying , ' We love your comic , ' and asking me to sign it , just like they ' d do with a record. &quot; Ford is not only proud_of her comic_book , she ' s actually a bit envious of her penciled and inked self . &quot; It ' s fabulous and wild-looking , &quot; she says . &quot; I ' m putting some of the artwork on one of the guitars I ' ll use in concert , and I also hope to wear_on stage the costume that the artist created for my character . But I keep looking_at the breasts he drew for me , and I wish the real ones looked as good ! &quot; * Comics have been good to Scott Rosenberg , the founder and president of Malibu Comics . He became an entrepreneur at 13 when , having exhausted his meager savings buying_up comics , he promptly began selling_off his more valuable titles . &quot; that ' s the only way I could make enough money to keep buying more comics , &quot; says the 31-year-old self-described comic fanatic . &quot; I started renting tables at conventions and began my own mail-order business . In 1986 , having graduated college , I decided it was time to become a legitimate publisher . The way I funded the company ' s start-up over the first few years was again by selling_off half of my comic collection. &quot; Rosenberg is extremely happy to be producing a rock ' n ' roll comic_book that the rockers themselves can enjoy . &quot; We only wanted to work with bands that really wanted to bring their creative vision to an illustrated form , &quot; he says . &quot; A lot of what goes_on in music merchandising is distanced . Somebody buys a license to use a band ' s name or image and then goes_off and makes widgets using that name and image . The bands aren ' t involved . But we want the bands to take_pride in their comic book. &quot; The story lines in the Rock-It series will range from straight bio to phantasmagoria , and the artwork may be presented as traditional comic panels , stylized paintings , or something in between . But Rosenberg explains that the process of putting a Rock-It title together is always the same . &quot; Our creative people begin by brainstorming about the bands they want to cover , &quot; he says . &quot; It doesn ' t have to be an act from the pop charts , but it does have to be somebody who will be exciting on the page -- somebody could sell a_million records and still not be a good choice for a comic_book story. &quot; Through a partnership with the Gold Mountain Entertainment management firm , Rosenberg has access to a wide range of musicians , whom he hooks_up_with appropriate writers and illustrators . &quot; Once we ' ve decided on the acts we want to work with , we approach them through Gold Mountain and let them know that they can do anything with our resources , &quot; Rosenberg says . &quot; Anything they ever wanted to do_in a video or a movie , they can now do_in a comic_book without ever worrying about the budget . The musicians approve the artwork and contribute to the writing of their story . Panel by panel , they tell us what to do , and we love it. &quot; John C . Anderson of the marketing and promotion company International Strategic Marketing liked the Rock-It concept enough to sign_on as a third partner . His company will have the finished books selling alongside the X-Men in comic_book shops , and alongside Rolling Stone in music outlets and at newsstands . Future plans may have the $ 3.95 comics sold at concerts as inexpensive alternatives to tour programs . &quot; It ' s a great cross-pollination , &quot; says Ron Stone , president of Gold Mountain , whose acts include Nirvana , the Lemonheads and Bonnie Raitt . &quot; Comic_book culture and rock ' n ' roll culture head toward each other anyway , and both are taken very seriously by some people . Comic_books are no longer the domain of pimply-faced 12-year-olds . A lot of people read them , and a lot of those people listen to rock ' n ' roll. &quot; Stone and Jack Jacobs , Gold Mountain ' s director of acquisitions , began discussing a blending of rock ' n ' roll and comic_books two years ago when they were looking_for a novel way to publicize World Domination , Stone ' s newly formed alternative record label . They did some research into the comic_book world and found that publishing giants Marvel and DC were more interested in owning characters outright than working directly with musicians to create new books . But with Rosenberg , they found a kindred spirit . &quot; I ' ve always been a fan of music -- everything from the Carpenters to Poison , &quot; he says . &quot; And I ' m a madman about comics , so the idea of Rock-It was something I jumped at right away. &quot; While typical comic_books can go from conception to publication in a_few months , the inclusion of the musicians in the approval process means that it can take a year for a Rock-It title to go from drawing board to comic racks . &quot; Poor Scott , &quot; says Gold Mountain ' s Stone , chuckling . &quot; None of the characters he ' s created have ever talked back to him before. &quot; Rock-It Comix are not the first books to plunk_down rock ' n ' rollers in a format normally suited to super-heroes and dastardly villains . Batman and Superman were joined for a short time in 1992 on the DC Comics roster by Prince &amp; the New Power Generation ( another installment is_due soon ) . Marvel , home of the Fantastic Four , once put_out an Alice Cooper comic , and a pair of KISS titles it released in the late ' 70s have become collectors ' items now selling for $ 50 . Marvel has also just released the first edition of , huh-huh , a Beavis and Butt-head comic ( it is &quot; recommended for immature readers only &quot; ) . From less-well-known comics publishers there have been lines of unauthorized band histories and one-shot rock ' n ' roll parodies . &quot; Most of the unauthorized books have had unimpressive black-and-white art and have been kind of shoddy , &quot; Rosenberg explains . &quot; They were unauthorized not in the cool sense of that word . They were just slapped_together . We ' re doing authorized versions , but these aren ' t all publicist-polished biographies . They ' re not sanitized . Sometimes the bands want to go_in directions that surprise us. &quot; Ford didn ' t shy_away_from allowing herself to appear as the sexy protagonist of a violent story . &quot; I like sex and violence , &quot; she says , laughing . &quot; They make my day . I ' ve always been a fan of tough women in films -- Sandahl Bergman wielding an ax and that sort of thing . Now , in my comic_book , it ' s like I ' m getting_to be an actress in that kind of movie. &quot; Illustrator Balent , a hot name among comic fans due_to his powerful drawings of such sexy super-vixens as Vampirella and Catwoman , says he enjoyed turning Lita into a heavy metal Amazon . &quot; I ' m a big fan of strong women , fangs , claws , and rock ' n ' roll , &quot; he says . &quot; Working with Lita was a dream come true. &quot; * Some books , like Ford ' s , will take_advantage of the form and stretch into the fantastic . The Ozzy tale sends the singer into an ominous nether world to pit his wits against hellish monsters . Ozzy ' s late guitarist Randy Rhoads appears as a force of light to steer him back to the world of the living . Other rockers will use the comic_book as an opportunity to tell their band ' s history in their own words . Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath is a comic collector himself and is the proud owner of first issues of Spider Man , X-Men and , most appropriately , Iron Man . He co-wrote the story line for the Black Sabbath comic , and says there was satisfaction as well as challenge in putting_together the authorized history of the band . &quot; It ' s nice to be able to get the facts straight about Black Sabbath for a change , but I found_out it ' s possible to get too factual for the comic_book form , &quot; he says . &quot; A good comic has to have the right kind of drama , and most of all it has to be a good read , so our history had to fit the form we were using. &quot; He and longtime bandmate Tony Iommi opted for a fairly straight historical approach in the Sabbath comic , rather than use elements of fantasy , horror or science_fiction . They also felt the band would be miscast as supermen . &quot; Maybe if Ozzy was still in the band we could all be super-heroes , but I can ' t really imagine me and Tony flying around and doing_good deeds , &quot; Butler says . Illustrator Balent believes that Rock-It has finally solved the difficult task of giving a comic_book some rock ' n ' roll spirit . &quot; There ' s always been a real problem mixing music and comics , because you ' re just never going_to capture a truly electrifying performance in a comic_book , &quot; he says . &quot; You ' re not going_to get killer guitar licks off of an inked page . My first concern with Rock-It was that they might just want flat representations of concert scenes , and frankly I couldn ' t imagine anyone wanting to read metal lyrics for 22 pages . &quot; But when I found_out that the artistic approaches and story lines were wide open , and that the wishes of the musicians involved would be treated as gospel , I knew this was the way to go. &quot; The Rock-It line is currently being featured prominently at the three Golden Apple comic_book shops in the Los Angeles area , and owner Bill Liebowitz says they are making an impression . &quot; The Ozzy book is selling well because he ' s so well known , and the Lita book is selling well because Jim Balent ' s art is so well-liked , &quot; he says . Liebowitz is giving the Ozzy book a special push_on Feb . 22 , when Osbourne will make an in-store appearance to sign 1 # 000 special editions of his books , which will be sold on Feb . 20 and 21 . Rosenberg is past validation these days , and is_well into uncontrolled glee . The expectant father says that he sometimes finds it hard to believe that his adult day job consists_of running a comic_book company and fielding calls from his favorite rockers . &quot; I ' m the kid in the candy_store . When I wake_up Monday morning , I ' m bummed because it ' s been a day or two since I was at the office . I may be a grown-up , but I ' m still kind of nuts about comics and rock ' n ' roll. &quot;</TEXT>
