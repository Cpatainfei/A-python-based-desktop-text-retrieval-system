   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; EMERGENCIES ROUTINE FOR VOLUNTEER MEDICAL TEAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 39-member emergency medical team from New Mexico had barely set_up shop -- four tents outside a quake-damaged medical_building in Canoga Park -- when the patients started showing_up at noon Saturday . Within a hour , the waiting room was_full : with pregnant women , sick babies , stressed-out grandparents and a National Guardsman with an asthma_attack so acute he had to be taken_away in an ambulance . Most of it was fairly routine medical stuff for the team of five doctors , 12 nurses , 12 paramedics and other emergency medical_specialists , hardened veterans of disaster scenes from the_Virgin Islands to Hawaii . &quot; We can handle anything from headaches to heart_attacks , &quot; said John Gaffney , an administrator at the University of New Mexico and one of the team ' s leaders . &quot; We expect just about anything . That is what disaster medicine is all about. &quot; No one gets a bill . The crew , organized by the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and dispatched by federal health authorities , is part of the national disaster medical system . Their disaster work began in 1989 , when they were dispatched to the_Virgin Islands in the wake of Hurricane Hugo , and included visits in 1992 to Miami to assist victims of Hurricane Andrew , and Hawaii after Hurricane Iniki . The MASH-like unit of civilian volunteers arrived_at March Air_Force Base on Friday night . They were bused to the site in Canoga Park , at Gault Street and Remmet Avenue , and set_up the tents . The team carries its own water purifier , which can operate_on solar_power if utilities are out , and stockpiles of food and other supplies . One team member is a licensed pharmacist and travels with a portable pharmacy . &quot; Our mission is to be able to go anywhere and set_up without having to increase the drain on the local resources any more_than we have to . Every member of the team is prepared to live_in whatever austere environment they send us to , &quot; Gaffney said . Each member of the team had a bedroll in case they have to sleep_in one of the tents , which had been set_up in a parking_lot next to the county ' s Canoga Park Health Center . Most of the first patients they saw Saturday had been living_in parks or shelters since Monday and were receiving their first medical attention since the earthquake . County health officials had spread word that the clinic was open by passing_out flyers , in English and Spanish , in parks and shelters . One young family arrived with four of the five people badly in need of medical attention . The mother , whose name was not released , was pregnant and feeling contractions every 20 minutes . Her husband appeared to have broken his hand . He told the medics he had fallen Monday morning when he and his family were scrambling for safety . His hand was badly swollen and his fingers were bent at odd angles . Two of their toddlers were running high_temperatures , had sore_throats and stuffy noses . They had been living_in a nearby park since the earthquake . Another early patient , Rosa Lopez , a grandmother , was frightened badly during the earthquake , and had to be driven to the field clinic by a friend . Her face drawn by tension , her eyes still darting about nervously as if she expected another earthquake , Lopez said she hoped to get something for &quot; high blood pressure. &quot; A little while later , a woman showed_up with a baby with a bad case of chickenpox . After a quick examination , the nurses determined that the chickenpox was in its late stages and not much of a threat to be contagious . Still , the spread of chickenpox is one of the biggest fears of county health authorities . Although most adults and children have had it , it is especially dangerous to pregnant women because it can travel through the mother to the fetus , or be especially virulent if it attacks a newborn infant . The nurses kept the baby with chickenpox away from the three pregnant women who had shown_up during the first hour . And so it went : a host of ailments , but nothing extraordinary . Jeff McBrayer , a paramedic from Albuquerque , said : &quot; Usually after the first few days the major casualties have been dealt with , and then it ' s all_the routine stuff . People have lost their medications , they can ' t get access to things . Sick kids , especially . that ' s what we see the most. &quot; Local officials said the New Mexico team meets a big need . With hospitals stretched to the maximum , particularly those in the west San Fernando Valley , emergency workers hoped that patients with less than acute medical needs would visit the clinic first . &quot; It ' s great , &quot; Los Angeles City Fire Capt . Lawrence Mayer said after a tour . &quot; People who leave here and ( are sent ) to a hospital would have gone anyway . If they come here first and get treated , ( many ) won ' t need to go_to the hospital. &quot; County health authorities appeared to be breathing a sigh of relief over reports that -- so far , at least -- there had not been any outbreaks of contagious_disease among the thousands of homeless earthquake victims who have moved_into tents and emergency shelters . With the county in the throes of a tuberculosis epidemic and the worst flu outbreak in years , concerns had been raised about the spread of disease . Chickenpox is especially worrisome for county health officials because cold , damp winters are when it is at its worst . &quot; We know that it ' s inevitable that if children go_into these crowded situations this time_of_year , some of them are going_to have chickenpox , &quot; said Dr. Shirley Fannin , a county disease control administrator . Fannin said that she did not consider the spread of tuberculosis a serious threat because most TB cases are concentrated in the central part of Los Angeles County and most of the quake victims are in the northwest Valley . Still , county health workers were trying to keep track of each tuberculosis case . Health workers said two families with small babies suffering from chickenpox had been turned_away from a large tent city for quake victims set_up at Canoga Park High_School . Both families then found friends to stay with , according to Red_Cross workers .</TEXT>
