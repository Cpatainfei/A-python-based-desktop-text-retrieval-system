   <HEADLINE> IT WAS THE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ' S MANY AEROSPACE COMPANIES WHO PUT . . . ; THE FIRST MAN ON THE MOON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Casey Patelski helped Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make their giant leap to the moon , and the retired aerospace_engineer is ready to celebrate the 25th anniversary . &quot; All the astronauts are still alive , and most of us who worked_at Mission Control in Houston are still around , so I figure it ' s going_to be a big deal , &quot; said Patelski of Costa Mesa , who was a flight manager for McDonnell Douglas Corp . in NASA ' s Houston Mission Control facility during the first lunar landing . But Patelski and others in Southern California whose efforts led to the moon landing on July 20 , 1969 , are finding this year ' s observance bittersweet , as memories of exuberant years compete with frustration over today ' s layoffs and cost-cutting by NASA and the aerospace industry . They remember a period seemingly without limits ; today , the constraints of recession and federal_deficits appear everywhere , ending careers and extinguishing the grandest ambitions for space exploration . &quot; Around the country , engineers and scientists are being crudely dumped onto the street &quot; as aerospace companies and NASA scramble to cut costs , said Jerry Rosenberg , executive_director of the NASA Alumni League in Washington . &quot; I ' d guess that it will be an interesting anniversary celebration. &quot; At the hub of Southern California ' s Apollo community was the sprawling North_American Corp . ( now Rockwell International ) plant in Downey , which produced three key Apollo components : the engine , the lunar_module and the lunar lander . Wrote Los Angeles author Mike Gray : &quot; From all_over the country , bits and pieces of the spaceship flowed to the assembly bays at Downey -- fuel and oxygen tanks from Boulder and Buffalo , instruments from Davenport and Cedar Rapids and Newark , batteries from Joplin , valves from San Fernando , electronics from Kalamazoo and Lima , fuel_cells from Hartford. &quot; As that parade of parts , components and subsystems flowed into Downey , Gray wrote in his 1992 book , &quot; Angle_of_Attack , &quot; the industry &quot; slogged toward the moon , a vast national network of brainpower and craftsmanship slowly coming_to focus_on a single problem. &quot; Southern California ' s rich aerospace heritage proved a fertile ground for NASA , and in return , local companies were forced to adopt manufacturing techniques that later served them well in the commercial aerospace industry . &quot; When NASA came_in with their fine-tooth comb inspection , they absolutely turned our company around , &quot; recalled Harold Stout , formerly president of Long Beach-based Airdrome Parts Co. , which manufactured about a dozen high-strength , low-weight tubing connectors for Apollo . &quot; That proved to be the salvation of our company. &quot; Other Southland communities contributed mightily to the space effort as well . In the 1960s , Rockwell was making the Saturn rocket ' s second stage in Seal Beach , McDonnell Douglas was building the rocket ' s third stage in Huntington Beach and TRW ' s San Juan Capistrano facility was helping build the engine that powered the lunar_module . Hundreds of Southern California companies played roles in Apollo , and NASA pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy . &quot; In a word , the space_program meant everything to Southern California ' s economy , &quot; said Shirley Thomas , a USC professor who has authored more_than half_a_dozen books on space exploration . Engineers , factory employees and managers recall workdays that involved a higher calling . Exploring the frontiers of space imposed special burdens , too , from fulfilling the hopes of an attentive public to assuring the safety of astronauts who had become national heroes . Don Barcus , who joined McDonnell Douglas ' corporate finance staff in Huntington Beach in 1962 , tells of employees working overtime and weekend hours without complaint and with a sense of mission . &quot; A man was going_to be put_on top of that rocket and blasted into space , &quot; he said . &quot; Any time you put a man on top of it , it had to be a quality job. &quot; The space_program was also &quot; peace-oriented , it was pushing technological frontiers , and it wasn ' t made to destroy something , &quot; Barcus said . &quot; People loved working_on this project. &quot; Those involved in the program &quot; were almost like heroes , &quot; said Fountain Valley resident Bob Younkin , 55 , who joined McDonnell Douglas as an engineer in 1964 . &quot; People could identify with it. &quot; Rosendo Romero , a Buena Park resident who was a welder at McDonnell Douglas for 41 years , said he once labored 36 hours straight to repair cracks in a thick , steel deflector plate at the Cape Kennedy launch_pad . Another shift stretched to 30 hours as he struggled to repair a damaged Saturn rocket part and keep the lunar mission on schedule . &quot; There were constant change orders , &quot; said Romero , now 65 . &quot; Welders worked directly off of blueprints , and when changes were needed , an engineer would ' red pencil ' it on the spot , and the welder would go_to work. &quot; For Romero , the crowning moment came_after the lunar landing when he was chosen by his co-workers as their delegate to a luncheon at Houston ' s Rice Hotel honoring the Apollo 11 astronauts . Romero flew home with a souvenir menu that listed Neil Parisienne Sauteed Potatoes , Buzz Miniature Glazed Carrots and Mike Tossed Green_Salad , the latter named for astronaut Michael Collins , who remained in lunar orbit while Armstrong and Aldrin explored the moon . The menu was signed by all three space voyagers . &quot; I started welding destroyer_escorts in Abilene , Tex. , when I was 14 , &quot; Romero said . &quot; I never dreamed of ( my work ) going_to outer space. &quot; Apollo 11 ' s technological achievement , which author Gray has compared to &quot; throwing a dime into a parking meter from three hundred miles away , &quot; inspired people to seek careers in aerospace . Among them was Winston Hickman , 51 , who joined Rockwell International ' s corporate staff in the early 1970s . &quot; We ' d been to the moon , and the next stop was Mars , &quot; Hickman said . &quot; It was a real heady time with lots of gee-whiz stuff . . . . After the moon landing , it seemed as if it was all there to be done . We were going_to do the space_station and then go_to the stars. &quot; Hickman spent 17 years with Rockwell before moving_on to Vans Inc. , the Orange-based maker of tennis_shoes , where he eventually became chief financial_officer . But he still professes a fascination with space . &quot; I ' m a ' Star Trek ' freak at heart , &quot; he confided . Their strong feelings aside , most Apollo veterans acknowledge that the nation now lacks the will to underwrite manned space_travel beyond Earth orbit . But they do so grudgingly , and they harbor strong doubts about the wisdom of letting the Apollo_program die during the 1970s . &quot; It was a terrible , terrible mistake , &quot; said Duane Johnson , 66 , a Stanton resident who lost his engineering job when McDonnell Douglas wound down its Apollo work in the early 1970s . &quot; That Saturn rocket was a monster , &quot; said Johnson , who drove a moving van for years before finding another aerospace job . &quot; It ' s just so sad. &quot; Patelski , the Apollo 11 flight manager , also was laid_off in the early 1970s . He managed to find an engineering job , though for less pay , with Fluor Corp . in Irvine . &quot; I was bitter about the whole_thing , &quot; he said . &quot; I mean , we went_to Houston , trained the astronauts , and all we got was a pink slip. &quot; At the same time , Patelski fears that NASA is being hamstrung by &quot; a lot of guys my age . . . still hanging_on , &quot; pushing for manned space flights when unmanned missions are cheaper and more effective . &quot; We contributed mightily to Mercury , Gemini and Apollo , &quot; Patelski said . &quot; But it seems to me they ' re still thinking_back to the good old days when we were young . . . . They ' ve got_to get young , aggressive guys who aren ' t stuck_with old , Model T thinking. &quot; Robert Minor , who worked in Houston Mission Control during Apollo 11 ' s flight and is now president of Rockwell Space Systems Division , worries that the lack of a cohesive plan will dull the appetite of younger aerospace industry employees . &quot; They ' re better trained and educated than we were , and they work just as hard as we did_in the ' 60s and ' 70s , &quot; Minor said . &quot; But they need a goal and they need one badly , even if it ' s something 10 years away. &quot; Other aerospace veterans express concerns that invaluable scientific information may be lost as those who were_on the Apollo team retire and die . &quot; We ' re like the monks in the Dark Ages , carrying a core of knowledge in our heads , &quot; said Jim Ball , 47 , a Huntington Beach resident who joined McDonnell Douglas early in 1969 and still does mission simulation work for the company . Today ' s engineers know what certain parts of the Saturn looked_like , but they don ' t know why engineers opted for those specific designs . Said Ball : &quot; We ' ve got_to absorb this knowledge to keep it alive. &quot; He is concerned , too , that today ' s schoolchildren appear not to view space exploration as a career possibility . &quot; As a kid I loved space , I read about Sputnik in the third grade , made a reflector telescope to look_at the moon , &quot; Ball said . On a recent cloudless night , Ball pointed_out to his children the area of the moon where astronaut Pete Conrad , now a McDonnell Douglas executive in Huntington Beach , landed during a later Apollo mission . &quot; I remember looking_at the moon in awe , &quot; Ball said . &quot; But the kids were not excited. &quot; Patelski , however , says he is doing his part to ensure that at least one capable young scientist will be ready when the United States finally returns to space flights beyond Earth orbit . The first of Patelski ' s grandchildren to earn an engineering degree will get the bright-red 1969 Camaro that he is painstakingly restoring in his Costa Mesa garage . &quot; It ' s in my will , &quot; Patelski said . &quot; I ' ve got five kids , so there ' s a good chance that at least one of them will come_up with an engineer. &quot;</TEXT>
