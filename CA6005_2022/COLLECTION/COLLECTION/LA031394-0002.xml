   <HEADLINE> DEADLY FIX ; LETHAL PASSAGE : HOW THE TRAVELS OF A SINGLE HANDGUN EXPOSE THE ROOTS OF AMERICA ' S GUN CRISIS , BY ERIK LARSON ( CROWN : $ 20 ; 288 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In &quot; Lethal Passage , &quot; Erik Larson aims the journalist ' s most potent weapon -- an assembly of unadorned facts compelling rational conclusions -- at those America citizens who remain &quot; unaligned &quot; in the endlessly raging debate about gun_control . Bull ' s-eye ! Using the device of tracing a single handgun from conception to manufacture to distribution to retail sale , Larson clearly illustrates the frightening ease with which weaponry of mass-murder capability can be acquired . Nicholas Elliot hardly qualified as a criminal mastermind . Sixteen years old , with a &quot; mental_age of 12 or 13 &quot; and suffering from both dyslexia and a &quot; schizoid personality_disorder , &quot; Nicholas came_to school one day with a Cobray M-11 / 9 , a cheap semiautomatic_pistol capable of firing 32 rounds on a single clip . He was seeking a larger boy who had tormented and bullied him for some time . On his way to his intended target , one teacher was killed and another severely wounded . Had the pistol not malfunctioned , the potential body_count is too terrifying to calculate -- Nicholas was carrying six full clips plus hundreds of additional rounds in ammo boxes , including some he had modified to create &quot; dumdum &quot; and &quot; hollow point &quot; effects . For too many Americans , homicide is a problem solver . The sociopath for whom humans arouse no more empathy than the characters in a video_game has two main consumer demands : firepower and the look -- that all-important air of menace . Accuracy is of no consequence to the urban punk killing machine -- his shooting style is &quot; spray and pray. &quot; American teen-agers know this -- and arm themselves accordingly -- to such an extent that many schools would sooner dispense_with textbooks than metal detectors . The message -- that guns &quot; fix &quot; things -- pervades our culture . From stalkers to schizophrenics , from the paranoid to the pursued , from the frightened to the fascinated , guns dominate consciousness and dictate behavior . Larson takes us past the absurd myths ( one can &quot; count the shots &quot; during a firefight ) , past the numbing statistics ( every year handguns alone account_for 22 # 000 deaths ) , past the rhetoric and into the face of the reality -- the American public is armed and dangerous . Journalism at its highest form is &quot; investigative art. &quot; &quot; Lethal Passage &quot; qualifies . Neither &quot; gun nut &quot; nor &quot; anti-gun , &quot; the author uses a highly accessible style to illuminate the path that led us to the current situation . Guns may be a religious experience for some , but for those who manufacture them , they are a product -- a product to be marketed . &quot; The domestic gun industry , despite its privileged status as the least regulated of consumer-product industries , sold so many guns in America it saturated the market and now must scramble for ways to open new markets. &quot; And the marketers have been so successful that even the language of guns is loaded . One detective summed_up Nicholas Elliot ' s mobile arsenal by saying the teen-ager was &quot; ready for war. &quot; Hardly an accurate description -- in wars , people shoot back . But &quot; combat &quot; is a much more acceptable raison d ' etre for handguns than &quot; slaughter. &quot; Expecting profiteers to self-regulate is absurd . The author , after pointing_out that we have &quot; child-safe &quot; requirements for bottles of vitamins but not for guns tells us : &quot; Buying a gun should be the most difficult consumer ritual in America , instead of one of the easiest. &quot; Part of the blame is ascribed to &quot; historians &quot; whose purple prose made heroes of career criminals and assorted psychopaths . &quot; Strip away the legends enshrouding the famous outlaws and what you find are pathological killers , &quot; the author writes . I must have missed something -- is that supposed to have changed ? But the real culprit is not criminals lusting_after weapons , it is a combination of National Rifle Assn . ( NRA ) &quot; fundamentalists &quot; who hold the right to own guns so sacred that it must never be subservient to mere species survival . . . and a cowardly Congress , which gives lip_service to crime prevention but will not even protect its own law_enforcement officers from the deluge of guns available for the asking . The word fundamentalist is well-chosen . NRA extremists view the &quot; right to bear arms &quot; with the same ferocity the Anti-Choice zealots view in utero &quot; life. &quot; As Larson points_out , the mainstream NRA member is not opposed to handgun registration -- in fact , the majority favors such laws . But as the NRA leadership moves further away from a centrist position , continuing to alienate law_enforcement as well as virtually everyone concerned with the safety of our citizens , how does_it maintain its political clout ? The answer is both simple and depressing -- politicians don ' t conduct plebiscites , they simply react to &quot; leadership. &quot; And that leadership ' s hostility to regulation in any form implies a promise to deliver a massive voting bloc on a moment ' s notice . Far more media-savvy than their opponents , the pro-gun lobby operates_on all levels , from &quot; screen credits &quot; for specific weapons used in movies to production of NRA &quot; educational &quot; films . One such film featured a Congressman proclaiming : &quot; If I were to select a jackbooted group of fascists who are perhaps as large a danger to American society as I could pick today , I would pick ATF ( Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , the agency which enforces laws relating to firearms ) . &quot; Larson responds , &quot; Gun aficionados may liken the ( ATF ) to the Gestapo , but in its relationship to America ' s gun dealers , it behaves more like an indulgent parent. &quot; After repeated attacks by the NRA , the ATF has become &quot; gun-shy , &quot; and is reluctant to assume the sort of proactive stance that could prevent crime ( as opposed to merely documenting it ) . How easy is it to obtain handguns in the United States ? To become a &quot; dealer , &quot; entitling you to buy and sell guns , you need a Federal Firearms License . &quot; In 1990 , 34 # 336 red-blooded Americans applied for an FFL . ATF denied license to only 75. &quot; No surprise . After all , the ATF requires prospective gun purchasers to answer all_of eight questions about their background and mental_health -- public protection being predicated on the concept that felons will tell the truth and lunatics will self-diagnose . The author shows us not only the marketing of guns , but the &quot; after-market &quot; as well . That shadow-land includes , for example , so-called &quot; cop-killer &quot; bullets specifically designed to penetrate the &quot; bullet-proof &quot; vests worn by law_enforcement . The accompanying &quot; advertising &quot; claims citizens need such ammunition because some criminals are now wearing those same vests . Sure . And out on the border where the First_Amendment meets the Second , there are how-to books on assassination , bomb manufacturing and the construction of silencers . The Second Amendment of &quot; right to bear arms &quot; fame , is , of course , biblical -- that is , it may be quoted for virtually any purpose . The author takes a journalist ' s view : &quot; All the noise and dust generated by the debate over the true meaning of the Second Amendment obscures a fundamental question : Who cares ? &quot; Chain_saws don ' t cut_down trees -- but they make_it so_much easier . It takes a different mindset to kill up close -- ask any maximum-security convict . And when was the last time that horrifying symbol of the ' 90s -- the armed &quot; disgruntled employee &quot; -- committed mass_murder with a knife ? The simple purchase of a gun without specialized training makes as much sense as taking a_few karate lessons and pronouncing yourself a master of self-defense . No rational person could argue against a proficiency test for gun ownership . Nor against the registration , by unduplicatable serial number , of every handgun purchased . But for the NRA , any regulation is a step toward abolition . That perception may , in fact , be closer to the truth than anyone realizes . An editorial in Australia ' s largest newspaper , the Sydney Herald , illustrates not only that the world is watching closely , but that even the slightest step_forward will be seen as laudable progress . &quot; With difficulty , the so-called Brady Bill has become law in the United States . . . . The new law does nothing about the 200 million guns already in circulation . . . and will be easily circumvented . But it is a symbolic first_step that , if followed up by more serious measures , will represent as significant a social reform as any that President Clinton is likely to bring about. &quot; ( From the Sydney Morning Herald , as quoted in World Press Review , February , 1994 ) Because the NRA ' s power is not in its numbers but in the perception that such numbers are a single-minded voting constituency , any crack in the armor is likely to reveal the truth . To some extent , this perception is even shared by the author , who , as the book ' s centerpiece , proposes the &quot; Life and Liberty Preservation Act , &quot; an omnibus law focusing_on control of distribution , purchase and design of handguns , but concludes the act &quot; doesn ' t have a chance in hell of being passed &quot; because &quot; ( e ) ven those of us who favor strong regulation lack the conviction of those who oppose such laws. &quot; &quot; Lethal Passage &quot; charges that a passive minority has allowed a dedicated minority to determine gun_control policy in America . If that charge is valid -- and all_the evidence indicates that it is -- our choices are both very limited and very clear : We can actively demand fundamental changes in gun_control laws . . . or we can passively continue to count the bodies .</TEXT>
