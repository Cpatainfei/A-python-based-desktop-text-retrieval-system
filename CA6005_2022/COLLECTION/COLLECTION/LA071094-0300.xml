   <HEADLINE> CONDO Q &amp; A : CAN ASSOCIATION LIMIT NUMBER OF RENTALS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : I live_in a large association in Orange County . Some association members would like to limit the number of units that can be rented to either 30 % or 50 % of the total number of units . Owners who wish to rent their units would be unable to do so once the approved percentage has been reached . The declaration of covenants , conditions and restrictions ( CC &amp; Rs ) states that &quot; nothing in this document shall prevent an owner from renting his / her condominium out &quot; to a tenant . Can the association prevent an owner from renting_out a unit ? Can the association charge a higher monthly assessment to the owners of units that are rented ? ANSWER : The declaration is your association ' s &quot; constitution. &quot; It is the highest authority among your association ' s governing documents and it is very difficult to change since it requires a high percentage of owners ' , and often the lenders ' , approval . If your declaration prohibits the restriction of rentals , then any conflicting rule passed_by the board of directors would be invalid . The only alternative would be to change the declaration by a vote of the owners , following the amendment procedure that is stated in the document . Charging an absentee owner a higher assessment would probably be illegal since the monthly assessment is based upon the percentage of ownership or the square footage of the owner ' s unit . Again , the declaration will typically state the procedure for establishing each person ' s obligation for the maintenance of the complex . For example , if the association has 10 units and the declaration states that each of the 10 unit owners pays an equal amount of the association ' s expenses , then each owner is responsible_for one-tenth of the total expenses . Any other method of sharing the expenses is invalid , and therefore , unenforceable . The association could charge an extra fee , separate from or in addition to the monthly assessment , only for specific services that are above and beyond the services provided to the other owners . The extra fee must be fair and justifiable . It cannot be an exorbitant fee that is simply used as a penalty to discourage rentals . Use Caution Trying to Enforce Age Restriction Q : In our condominium association , one of the owners now has a daughter and a grandchild living_in her condominium unit . Our association ' s documents specify that it is a &quot; senior_citizen &quot; condominium . What can be done to evict the residents who do not comply with our occupancy restrictions ? A : Be very careful about trying to enforce the age restriction until you seek the advice of an attorney who can analyze your particular association ' s rights . Even though your association ' s documents prohibit children , there are state and federal laws that may make your association ' s age restrictions illegal . In 1988 , the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act was adopted . The law specifies that a residential complex must have specific services or amenities for senior residents in_order to qualify for senior housing status . This federal law supersedes your association ' s legal_documents . The penalty for age discrimination can be as high as $ 50 # 000 so I urge you to spend the necessary funds to obtain expert legal advice before you or your board of directors tries to evict the young_woman and her child . Board_Members Mum About Suing Developer Q : My association is in the midst of suing the developer for construction defects . The board of directors will no longer allow our board_meetings to be taped . When the owners ask questions about the building or equipment replacement or financial reports , the board_members say , &quot; We can ' t discuss that . The lawyers are handling it. &quot; What are the owners entitled to know about these matters ? Please give us your comments . A : In my opinion , a tape_recording of a meeting is an invitation to trouble . Sometimes , taping a meeting is necessary but the tapes should not be saved as a permanent record . Tapes should be erased after the minutes , the official record of the association , are written , approved and filed . Under normal circumstances , owners are entitled to have access to the association ' s records and they are entitled to be informed about board_meetings so that they can attend . However , when legal_action is pending , it is necessary that the association ' s interests be protected . Therefore , the board is allowed to hold &quot; secret meetings , &quot; called executive board_meetings or executive_sessions and the minutes may be sealed until the legal issues are resolved . The board has an obligation to disclose , in_general terms , the types of problems that are the basis for the legal_action , but the specifics of the case are privileged information . The board has the power and authority to act_on behalf of all_of the owners . The owners , who elected the board_members for that purpose , sometimes get concerned about all that power when legal issues arise . However , the owners should be very cautious about interfering unless they have irrefutable evidence that the board is not acting in their best interests .</TEXT>
