   <HEADLINE> LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW ; CUAUHTEMOC CARDENAS ; RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN MEXICO AGAINST THE ALL-POWERFUL PRI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since 1986 , the year he challenged the political apparatus of the powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , demanding open and democratic internal selection of candidates and an end to the neoliberal economic_policies of President Miguel de la Madrid , Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , 60 , has been seeking the presidency he claims he won in the 1988 election . For five years , while Cardenas toured the country trying to organize a viable opposition party , his rival , Carlos Salinas de Gortari , became one of the most popular presidents in the history of Mexico , orchestrating sweeping economic reforms . But early this year , things changed for Salinas , for Cardenas and for the country . An armed insurrection in the southern state of Chiapas ; the assassination of PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , the man chosen by Salinas to succeed him and continue his reforms , and a succession of kidnapings of prominent Mexicans eroded the long honeymoon of Salinas . In the meantime , Cardenas , elected by his party to seek the presidency a second time , did not do_well in Mexico ' s first televised political debate . He was confronted by the little-known National Action Party , or PAN , candidate , Diego Fernandez de Cevallos , who clearly won the debate and jumped to second place . Cardenas ' popularity , according to an avalanche of mostly unreliable polls , dipped_into single digits . In addition , he was publicly lectured by the spokesperson of the Chiapas rebellion . None of these setbacks , however , seems to have made a dent in Cardenas ' indomitable desire to win the presidency -- perhaps because Cardenas is himself the son of a president of Mexico , Gen . Lazaro Cardenas . He has been married to Celeste Batel de Cardenas for 31 years . They have three children , ranging from age 29 to 10 . No presidential contest in Mexico has been as competitive as the one that will be held Aug . 21 . For the first time in 100 years , the outcome of the race is uncertain . Cardenas is convinced that , if the election is clean , he will follow in his father ' s footsteps and become the second President Cardenas . The question remains , however , what would happen if he loses and feels cheated ! * Question : Is Mexico at the crossroads between democracy and chaos ? Answer : There are signs of a serious social malaise and profound political crisis . The assassinations of Cardinal ( Juan Jesus ) Posadas and the PRI ' s candidate , Luis Donaldo Colosio ; the rebellion in Chiapas ; the kidnapings of ( entrepreneurs Alfredo ) Harp and ( Angel ) Losada -- all these events underline the depth of the crisis we are in . Q : Do you believe most Mexicans support the use of violence as a means to transit toward democracy ? A : The vast majority , including the EZLN ( the Zapatista Front , which launched the Chiapas uprising , ) seek a political solution to the crisis we are living . But not even they are calling the country to rise_up in arms as they did on Jan . 1 . Q : The EZLN is calling_for a convention that would appoint an interim president two weeks before the election . Do you agree ? A : My understanding is that this is one of the possible scenarios under_consideration , but I do not see it as a plausible scenario for the country . I don ' t believe they would follow that route , because I don ' t believe it solves the current crisis . Q : Will the results of the election determine whether or not there will be an eruption of violence in the country ? A : The only source of violence that can explode in the country is the government . Q : So , if on Aug . 22 , you get 12 % of the vote , will your supporters perceive the election as illegitimate and turn_to violence ? A : Regardless of the percentages , I hope that the elections are clean and the votes are counted properly . If that is the case , the people will accept the results . Q : What happens if the perception is that the elections were fixed ? A : Then the government will be confronted through civil means by the citizenry . Q : Is there a way for the PRI to win with your acceptance ? A : I don ' t know if there is a way for the PRI to win -- an objective analysis of the election shows that given the candidate and considering the way he was chosen , there is no way he can pull many votes . Q : Since the race looks so close , don ' t you believe that whoever wins will need the support of one of the losing candidates ? If ( PRI candidate Ernesto ) Zedillo wins by a small margin , would you negotiate some form of coalition government ? A : The problem does not lie_with the electoral percentages but in the political_program that is followed . If the agenda is to prolong the permanence of a party encroached within the state , I won ' t be able to collaborate with them . Q : Ernesto Zedillo has already declared the undesirability of an official party within the government . A : The problem is that he has not asked Jose Maria Cordoba or Carlos Salinas de Gortari for permission to change the very core of the system . I don ' t believe that Carlos Hank and the Atlacomulco Group , who have taken_over power within the Zedillo group , can lead to democratic change , or even to an honest government . Q : But I understand that you have negotiated with the government in the past . With Manuel Camacho in 1988 . A : Camacho looked_for me several times , but when we insisted that the only proper thing to do was to clean_up the election-process results , the talks ended . Q : What happens if Diego Fernandez de Cevallos wins ? A : That is another impossible option . Q : But if Diego wins , would you negotiate a coalition government with him ? A : No , because his program is not democratic . Q : Then what would be a possible option ? A : The logical outcome , and the more plausible scenario , is that I win the election . Q : If the race is indeed tight -- the margin between the three of you is close -- and you win , would you be able to govern ? A : Yes , because then the winner would have a democratic and constitutional legitimacy . But also because by loosing the election and cutting_off all_the political and economic support to the official party , that party becomes nothing more_than ashes that can be blown away with a puff_of_air . Q : Once again , President Salinas has said he would like to have a dialogue with you . Why don ' t you accept ? A : Because he has not set an agenda . I ' ve proposed one : the correction of the electoral lists ; displaying them up at the booths , and providing fair and equal access to the media for all candidates . We can meet and talk_about that . Q : All the polls indicate your popularity diminished dramatically after the debate . A : Well , then there exists a contradiction between the polls and the huge audiences I encounter in my campaign tour throughout the country . But the odd thing is that if I can ' t draw above 8 % or 10 % of the vote , then why is the government so concerned with me ? Q : Many of your leftist followers were disappointed with your performance during the debate because they felt you leaned too_much to the center instead of advancing the ideas of the left . Do you find their criticism fair ? A : No . I believe the program we have been advancing is the most viable to lift the country from its current crisis and to spark a new stage for sustained economic_growth and to achieve better social conditions for the population . Perhaps I should have answered swiftly to the accusations launched by Diego against me . But the debate should be analyzed not only by what happened that night but also by the spin in the media immediately after it . In the end , however , both the debate and the post-debate spin turned_out to be irrelevant to the people -- judging by the response I ' ve been getting throughout the country . Q : Mexico defines itself as Latin_American , but neither politically nor economically has there been unity of purpose with Latin_America . It has been with the U.S. that real linkage , both positive and negative , has taken_place . Which will be the context of your foreign_policy if you become president ? A : It will be diverse . we ' ll seek an effective economic and political integration with Latin_America , but we ' ll also maintain a close trade and economic relationship with the countries of NAFTA , while at_the_same_time seeking a larger economic diversification toward Europe and the Pacific Basin . Q : You opposed the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , but now you seem to have changed your mind -- A : I never opposed NAFTA . I opposed it only because I felt we could have signed a better agreement -- one that would have opened other perspectives to improve our development . Such an agreement meant investing in Mexico to diminish the existing differences between partners , to improve the social condition of our population . This meant equalizing the field among the three countries . Q : First with George_Bush and later with Bill_Clinton , President Salinas was able to articulate the best relationship ever with the U.S. Do you believe Salinas was wrong in thinking the U.S. could be a partner and suspending the traditional Mexican resentment toward the United States ? A : Salinas was wrong in his policies toward Mexico -- not in his foreign_policies . And he was wrong because he forgot he had to work for the benefit of the country , and what he did here was to create 40 million poor people and 14 million unemployed . Q : Many think you represent the policies of the past that did not work . To test you , they ask : Do you believe that the economic reform implemented in the past 12 years is irreversible ? A : No , of course I do not accept it as irreversible , because if I did , I would be bringing Mexico into a deeper crisis , I would be creating more unemployed , more poor people , more layoffs , more businesses closed . The free-market economy in Mexico is a right that is in our constitution , and Mexico has never tried to be an isolationist nation . But the question is how are we going_to open_up . We have to implement an alternative policy that creates new jobs , promotes growth instead of stagnation . Q : There is , however , much uneasiness in the private sector in Mexico and in the U.S. with the possibility of your victory . A : The ones that are afraid are the 24 that Salinas made billionaires because those fortunes have been made with the help of the powerful within the administration . If they had not become partners with officials in high places and been given privileges from them , they would not have made that kind of money . We want to establish real competition in business instead of propitiating monopolies . With real competition , we could have improved many of the most dynamic sectors of the economy -- such_as the television , telephones , copper and cement industries . Monopolies are not healthy for the economy , or socially . Q : If you are not convinced that the election was clean , what will you do ? A : I will defend my vote through every civil route ! Q : But that is what you did_in ' 88 . A : we ' ll do_it better this time -- because we are_better organized this time . We did not accomplish better results in ' 88 because we had no cohesion in the command and had not worked_on the possibility of a general mobilization that we now have .</TEXT>
