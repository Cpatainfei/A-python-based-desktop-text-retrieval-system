   <HEADLINE> FOUL WEATHER FRIENDS ; SKI RESORT OPERATORS ACROSS STATE CHEERING EARLY STORMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Early snowstorms have allowed ski resorts across California to open early this season , triggering optimism throughout the industry that this winter will be among the best ever . Some resorts opened as early as last Friday and another big snowstorm on Thursday prompted others to make plans to open this weekend . Snow Valley , a ski resort in San Bernardino County that usually follows the traditional Thanksgiving opening , was scheduled to open today . Resort managers did not anticipate conditions for the season to get under way so soon , said Margie LaPorte , a Snow Valley sales manager . But after the area received 4 to 6 inches of snowfall Thursday , she said , &quot; Phones have been ringing off_the_hook . . . . We are anticipating one of the best seasons in years. &quot; Mammoth Mountain , in California ' s eastern Sierra , opened Sunday and was blessed with an extra 18 inches of snow from Thursday ' s big storm , allowing the resort_to also move_up the opening of its advanced trails , said a spokeswoman . &quot; This is our earliest and strongest start since 1982 , &quot; said Bob Roberts , executive_director of the California Ski Industry Assn. , a trade group representing California ' s 38 ski resorts . Advance bookings at resorts have been very strong , he said . Sporting goods stores also reported brisk sales this week of skiing equipment , and especially robust sales for snowboards . In the past three years , snowboarding has become an increasingly popular alternative to downhill skiing . Mammoth Mountain spokeswoman Wendy Helgrud said the resort had about 3 # 000 skiers on the slopes Friday . And it is expecting about 10 # 000 visitors for the Thanksgiving weekend , she said . Probably about a quarter of the visitors will be snowboarding , she said . &quot; Snowboarding is a trend that has grabbed ahold of the ski industry and is becoming more and more popular , &quot; said Charles Goeldner , an expert on the skiing industry , who is a professor of marketing at the University of Colorado at Boulder . Snowboarders are usually the first ones through the door to buy skiing equipment , because they only need a light amount of snow to hit the slopes , said Lars Wackenstedt , a ski equipment buyer for the Big 5 sporting goods chain . &quot; It has been the largest-growing segment of the winter sports category , &quot; Wackenstedt said . But traditional skiers and snowboarders have both been buying early this season because this is the best snow they ' ve seen in several years , he said . At Mountain High , a ski resort in Moonridge near Big Bear that opened Nov . 4 , has set_aside a snowboard park to keep snowboarders away from traditional skiers . The ski industry in California suffered in the late 1980s from six consecutive years of drought , said Roberts , but conditions improved in 1991 . Snowfall has increased dramatically , with a record year in the 1992-1993 season , above average snowfall last year , and an exciting start this year , he said . Weather_forecasts suggest that the eastern Sierra will be getting many_more snowstorms in coming weeks , said Helgrud . This may be a record-breaking year for the industry across the country , said Goeldner . At the annual meeting in September of the Ski Tour Operators -- a group which arranges skiing tours across the country -- the room was all smiles when asked about bookings for the upcoming year , Goeldner said . Heading for a Great Run ? Ski industry_analysts report that this may be a record-breaking year across the country with snow storms arriving early . And ski resort managers throughout California say their reservation lines are ringing off_the_hook .
