   <HEADLINE> A WILLIAMS CHILD PARENT ' S EDUCATED GUESS ON ORIGIN OF FAIRY AND ELF FOLK TALES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As scientists grapple with the mysteries of Williams syndrome , UC Irvine professor Howard Lenhoff can ' t help but wonder if past generations turned_to folklore to explain the presence of people among them with the distinctive traits that accompany the birth disorder . &quot; It seems logical to me , and to others , that the legends we hear about music-loving , kind-hearted fairies and elves might be the way people used to talk_about Williams , &quot; the biologist said . &quot; There are plenty of examples in history of people creating superstition or fantastic stories to explain medical conditions they couldn ' t understand , so it doesn ' t seem too unlikely. &quot; Lenhoff has drafted an article , which he hopes to have published in a scientific journal , citing literary and historical references that could be related to Williams syndrome . Among his findings and theories : * The facial traits of people with Williams syndrome is most often described as &quot; pixie-like , &quot; with small , upturned noses , almond-shaped eyes , oval ears and broad mouths with full lips accented by a small chin . The syndrome is also accompanied by slow growth and development , giving people with WS a small stature . &quot; It seems clear that they mirror the classic description of pixies and elves , and may be where it originated from , &quot; Lenhoff said . * Fairies , elves and leprechauns are , according to lore , kind-hearted but sensitive beings . That fits the description of people with Williams , who are noted for the effusive personalities and insatiable love of conversation and interaction . &quot; Fairies were said to become mischievous when ridiculed , and that fits with Williams too , because childlike sensitivity to criticism and being mocked that lasts throughout adulthood for many &quot; people with Williams , Lenhoff said . * The &quot; wee , magical people &quot; of assorted folklore sources always seem to be associated with music and storytelling , Lenhoff points_out . That trait fits nicely into the description of people with Williams , who have a strong command of vocabulary , surprisingly vivid narrative skills and , in many cases , musical ability .
