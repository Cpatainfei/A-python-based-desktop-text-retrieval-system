   <HEADLINE> SAMPRAS , COURIER HEAD ELITE FIELD AT INDIAN WELLS MEN ' S TOURNAMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Top-ranked Pete Sampras and defending champion Jim Courier lead a strong field in the Newsweek Champions Cup , which runs today through Sunday at Hyatt Grand Champions . Seven of the top 10 and 14 of the top 18 players in the world are entered . As the first of nine Championship Series events on the ATP Tour , the Newsweek Champions Cup is guaranteed a top field each year , but Brad Gilbert , at 32 , the oldest player in this year ' s field , said the tournament has long been a popular stop . &quot; This is a great event , &quot; Gilbert said . &quot; It ' s a nice time_of_year , especially if you ' ve been playing indoors and been in cold_weather . It ' s such a festive atmosphere : in the day , full crowds . And enthusiastic people . You can ' t ask_for much more from a tennis tournament. &quot; In addition to Sampras , who has won the last three Grand_Slam events , the field includes Sergi Bruguera of Spain , who defeated Courier in last year ' s French Open final ; and up-and-coming Todd Martin of Lansing , Mich. , who lost to Sampras last month in the Australian Open final . &quot; Todd Martin ' s coming real hard , &quot; Gilbert said . &quot; He ' s playing excellent tennis . He can make results on clay , hardcourt , grass , indoors . If you can make results on all four surfaces , your future is looking great . I suspect by the end of the year , he ' ll be in the top four in the world. &quot; This week , though , Martin is only fourth among the Americans in a stellar field -- behind Sampras , Courier and Michael Chang .
