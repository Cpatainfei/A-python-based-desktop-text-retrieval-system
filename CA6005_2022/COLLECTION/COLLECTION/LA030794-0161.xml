   <HEADLINE> BREAKING THE ' BIG SILENCE ' ; ' SCHINDLER ' S LIST ' FORCES GERMANS TO LOOK_AT THEIR HISTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Young Germans often call it &quot; the big silence. &quot; At home , among family , talk_of the Holocaust was taboo . Children learned quickly that the subject was too painful , too shameful for their parents and grandparents to face . And most stopped asking . Now , Steven Spielberg , a Jewish-American film director who lost 10 relatives in the Holocaust , gives them &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and tells them that it is not only OK to ask questions , it is essential to look history in the eye without shame . &quot; Germany is ready and waiting and willing -- the new generation of Germans -- to look_at their past and not put it behind them but bring it with them throughout their lives , &quot; Spielberg said at the film ' s German premiere Tuesday in this city where Schindler spent his last years . &quot; Not as a way of paying penance or expressing guilt or shame but as a way of understanding that we cannot put the present or future to right until we make_peace with our past. &quot; Will his message be heeded ? Seldom in Germany has a film generated such emotion and soul-searching as &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; the story of the &quot; good German , &quot; businessman Oskar Schindler , who did what most Germans could not or would not do : Save Jews from the Nazi extermination . &quot; Everyone should see this film , &quot; the conservative daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine stated categorically in a front-page review . Spielberg ' s film &quot; is an event of contemporary history , &quot; added the liberal Die Zeit newspaper_critic . * But at_the_same_time , many German reviewers are asking why a German has never made this film . And some Germans say &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; is too long and too sad to bother seeing . As in other countries , German audiences are filing_out of theaters at the end of the three-hour film in stunned silence , like mourners leaving a funeral . &quot; I am totally shattered , &quot; Thomas Schreier , 24 , an insurance salesman said after opening_night in Berlin . The film gives Germans a hero through which they can look_at the Holocaust , a pain-reliever they have not always had . But it also raises uncomfortable questions : If Schindler resisted the Nazis , why didn ' t so many others ? If Schindler found_out what was happening , why didn ' t the others who say they never knew ? The film forces younger Germans to ask what they would have done_in their parents ' shoes , and the answer is not always what they would hope . Over coffee after seeing &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; university_student Bert Schleimer says that he was 12 years old when he learned the full horror of the Holocaust ' s 6 million dead Jews . He came_home from school and angrily confronted his father , who had been a teen-age soldier in the Third_Reich . &quot; I asked , ' What did you do ? ' And he said , ' You are young and haven ' t seen . You would n ' t have done anything either. ' And now I fear he is right. &quot; * As a child , Andrej Pomtow tried to broach the subject of the war many times with his parents and grandparents , but with little success . Then he heard his grandparents refer to a green armchair in their home as &quot; the Jew ' s chair &quot; and was told that they had bought_it cheaply during the war from Jews forced to sell their belongings before fleeing . &quot; When I learned where the chair came from , I was really shocked , &quot; said the 27-year-old Pomtow . Only then did he find_out from his mother that his grandfather had been a soldier , his grandmother a Nazi collaborator , and that they were ashamed . At the Frankfurt premiere , Spielberg described how Schindler ' s story brought_about his mid-life metamorphosis from entertainment movie-maker to the director of the world ' s most ambitious Holocaust film . It is a transformation that sounds much like Schindler ' s own evolution , and one that Spielberg hopes to share with generations of Germans . Even as Spielberg reminded Germans that anti-Semitism &quot; predates Nazi Germany by many hundreds of years , &quot; anti-Semites were throwing bricks and a firebomb at a synagogue in the Ruhr_valley city of Essen . In the southwestern town of Karlsruhe , a bomb threat was called into the crowded theater where the film opened . Neo-Nazis are a small but vocal minority in Germany , Spielberg said . Asked if he feared that the film would assuage German consciences , he said , &quot; I hope that ' s true . It could ease the conscience. &quot; Spielberg wants Germans to look , listen and learn . But the Bonn University_students said many of their friends felt the movie was too long and would n ' t go see it . Their parents , they said , found the subject too disturbing . When asked how he felt about &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; Pomtow chose to focus_on technical aspects , as if to avoid its moral content . But his colleague , Bert Schleimer , responded as Spielberg might have hoped . &quot; This is not my history directly , but it is my country and I have to be careful that the Holocaust does not happen again , &quot; Schleimer said . &quot; We have to work to convince people that all people are the same , that if ( immigrants ) come_to Germany , they don ' t leave their homes without reason . They are in fear , maybe for their lives . And they need help . We have to do something against racism. &quot; * Researcher Andreas Scharpf of The Times ' Berlin bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
