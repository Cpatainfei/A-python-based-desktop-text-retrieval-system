   <HEADLINE> GRAPHIC J.F.K. ASSASSINATION CAR PHOTOS , RECORDS RELEASED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gruesome photographs of the interior of President John F . Kennedy ' s limousine were released Tuesday by the National Archives , but nearly 50 # 000 documents also made public shed little additional light on the assassination . The black_and_white photos , taken_after the vehicle was returned to Washington from Dallas after Kennedy ' s death , bear mute testimony to the horrors witnessed by those riding close to the President ' s car in the Nov . 22 , 1963 , motorcade . Bloodstains are smeared on the Lincoln ' s leather seats , and blood has soaked the carpeted footwells and the upholstery underneath the seat . A crushed , bloodstained bouquet of chrysanthemums , given to Jacqueline Kennedy at Love Field , sit on the seat near where Kennedy slumped ; rose petals from another bouquet are scattered on the floor . Accompanying diagrams show that bullet fragments were retrieved from the vehicle ' s floor ; autopsy X-rays of a portion of Kennedy ' s skull also are included . The documents also feature numerous photos of a crack on the inside of the limousine ' s windshield , a piece of evidence investigators used to help conclude that Kennedy had been killed by bullets fired from the rear . Eight spent cartridges , test-fired from the Manlicher-Carcano rifle with which Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly killed Kennedy , were also released . Accompanying documents make clear that the ballistics tests show that the bullets match those used in J.F.K. ' s assassination . The photos were among files from FBI headquarters in Washington and FBI field offices in Dallas , New Orleans and Mexico_City . The records were among 224 boxes of material , containing at least 50 # 000 new documents . They were released under a 1992 law that requires federal agencies to release all records related to their investigations of Kennedy ' s murder and Oswald ' s killing . &quot; What is here today will not cause significant change in what people think -- either for people who think there was a conspiracy or people who think there wasn ' t , &quot; said Steve Tilley , the J.F.K. liaison at the National Archives . &quot; What we have here today is a lot of detail. &quot;</TEXT>
