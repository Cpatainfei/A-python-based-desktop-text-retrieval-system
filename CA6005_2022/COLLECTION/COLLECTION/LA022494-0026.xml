   <HEADLINE> U.S. SPIES ! RUSSIAN SPIES ! WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT ! ; AMES CASE : WASHINGTON ' S INDIGNATION IS HYPOCRITICAL -- OR IS IT A COLD_WAR HANGOVER ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The arrest of Aldrich Ames , a former CIA counterintelligence official , and his wife , once a paid CIA informer , on charges of spying for Russia has raised a ruckus that both amazes and amuses me . The President ' s brief assessment , delivered with the additional gravity of the now famously clenched underlip ; the secretary_of_state ' s solemn pronouncements , including the threat that the United States would not tolerate Russian spying ; a prominent senator ' s call to stop all aid to Russia -- which , I am sure , has been joined by a host of other fellow_travelers even as I write -- all_of this would seem to indicate that the entire government of the United States is staggered and outraged by Russia ' s continued intelligence_activities . They would like the country to believe that they expected the Russians , once the Cold_War was over , to recall all undercover_agents , slam the door on the recruitment of all foreign nationals , in short , to close shop . Of course , that is preposterous . Nevertheless , many Americans are honestly upset and angry and , I am sure , have happily reverted to their Cold_War mode of thinking_about Russia . I realize how difficult a task I have set myself in trying to reason with what is a powerful emotional reaction ; nevertheless , here goes . So what was Ames ' job ? Ah , yes , he worked for the Central_Intelligence_Agency ' s Soviet counterintelligence branch . And what does counterintelligence do ? Well , among other things , it recruits agents in other countries , believe it or not . Now , does anyone in the United States think that with the demise of the Soviet_Union , the CIA ' s Soviet counterintelligence operation was shut_down ? Does anyone doubt that the CIA continues to spy on , and recruit in , Russia ? Well , some people may , but believe me , their names are not Bill_Clinton , Warren Christopher or Dennis DeConcini . They know full well , as you all should , that the United States spies not only on such unfriendly countries as China , Cuba , Iraq , Libya and Iran , but also on such allies as Japan , Germany , Britain , France and Israel . And , hold_on to your seats , ladies and gentlemen , those allies spy on the United States ! A case_in_point is Jonathan Pollard , an American now serving a life sentence for having spied on America for Israel . Sure , his crime and punishment were greeted by some political gnashing of teeth and talk_about stopping U.S. aid to Israel ( roughly $ 3 billion annually , incomparably more_than Russia ' s ) . But cooler heads prevailed , and it even became possible for Israel ' s prime_minister to publicly ask_for Pollard ' s release . That was denied and rightly so : Pollard is a traitor , and treason in any country is considered the worst of crimes . Should Ames be proved guilty , he , too , should get the maximum sentence -- as should any Russian who betrays his country . I have no problem with that view . What I do have a problem with is public officials who play_on the political naivete of the people whose interests they purportedly have at heart -- your interests . It would be wonderful to live_in a spy-free world . It would be delightful if all countries signed a declaration pledging to disband their intelligence and counterintelligence services ( although verification would be a nightmare ) . It would be grand if they all shared with each other their lists of turncoat agents . But I must disappoint you : It ain ' t gonna happen . As long as military , political , economic and technological secrets continue to exist , so will espionage . And as long as espionage exists , so will traitors who , for whatever reasons -- greed , pride , vengeance , you name it -- will spill their countries ' secrets . As long as traitors exist , they will be apprehended , and there always will be people hoping to make political hay out of it all . But the Ames case has an additional dimension : The reason for all_the histrionics we are being subjected_to relates only in part to the uncovering of a Russian mole in the CIA . In a much more fundamental way , it has to do with a mentality that says : &quot; We won the Cold_War , so how dare they do anything that displeases us ! &quot; What we are witnessing is a childish temper tantrum thrown by people who deep in their hearts regret that Russia and the Russians have not rolled_over and played dead . It ' s time to grow_up .</TEXT>
