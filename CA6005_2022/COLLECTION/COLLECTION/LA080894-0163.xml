   <HEADLINE> THE CAPITOL_HILL FREELOADING ZONE ; POLITICS : HUNGRY LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS HAVE A LOT ON THEIR PLATES AT LOBBYISTS ' RECEPTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For one mouthwatering moment , Kirk Cartozian thought he had arrived in finger-food heaven . There he was_on Capitol_Hill , among the hungry hordes attending a reception thrown by some California fresh chicken group . The lobbyists wanted to show lawmakers what a fresh chicken really tastes like , versus the rival frozen birds . And while Cartozian is no lawmaker -- just a 20-year-old unpaid summer intern for Rep . Steve Horn ( R-Long Beach ) -- he was ready to offer , free_of charge , his well-honed chicken-tasting expertise . And all around him , chicken to die for . &quot; Tables of the best-tasting , juiciest , most succulent chicken you could imagine -- and every_last bit of it was filet -- not a bone in_sight , &quot; said the Long_Beach resident . &quot; I didn ' t care about the fresh chicken debate but I was hungry . It was pure freeloading . I ate chicken until I couldn ' t touch another piece . Then I brought four pounds back to the office. &quot; Whoever said there is no free lunch never worked_on Capitol_Hill , which is among the last truly &quot; Eat Free &quot; zones in America . It ' s the home of the gratis breakfast , lunch and dinner , featuring free booze by the caseload , free Swedish_meatballs and artichoke dip , free crab cakes and carrot pasta , free shrimp souffle and tarragon chicken_salad -- all compliments of some lobbyist group or another angling for the attention of influential Washington politicians . Each week , especially in the spring and summer , receptions hosted by obscure or mighty special_interests fill Capitol_Hill meeting rooms with lobbyists rubbing forks with low-level aides , high-falutin legislative staffers and policy-makers , even lawmakers themselves . On the reception circuit , the common thread often isn ' t an interest in any cause or issue . It ' s pure appetite . Greeting all comers are the smiling lobbyists -- men and women with large name_tags , eager to please , refill a drink , summon a new tray of food -- often in no rush to check a guest ' s credentials . The freeloading crowd knows this . Scores of Capitol_Hill staffers -- an army of unpaid interns and underpaid clerical workers -- wander the bowels of the Rayburn and Cannon House office_buildings , young sharks alert to the scent of a free feed . Come evening , they go_in search of receptions thrown by the Wiping Cloth Manufacturers Assn. , Woodcutters Institute , Amusement Machine Manufacturers Assn . and American Council of Shopping_Centers . While most events are intended for lawmakers and top aides , many Capitol_Hill offices trade reception schedules like stock tips . Bosses often send_in their places junior staffers , who spread the word to friends in other offices . The trick , interns say , is to arrive early . Receptions start at 5 p.m. sharp and the free food and booze are gone an hour later . Said Cartozian : &quot; The idea is to hit two or three . The reception circuit is like bar cruising . Only it ' s free. &quot; Erik Nasarenko , a junior staffer for Rep . Anthony C . Beilenson , ( D-Woodland Hills ) , is a sage reception hopper who knows his favorites . &quot; The Dairy Assn . has chefs who make these great omelets to order , &quot; said the 24-year-old Woodland Hills native . While eating , Nasarenko sometimes picks_up a date -- a young , single &quot; Hill rat &quot; like himself out for a good time . &quot; My favorite was a Family_Planning Assn . event , &quot; Nasarenko recalled fondly . &quot; Not only did they have Virginia Gov . Chuck Robb , they had great beer . We ' re talking Heineken . No Bud . No Busch . No Miller Lite. &quot; Even as lawmakers this year try to reduce the influence of lobbyists through bills such_as the Lobbying Reform and Gift Disclosure Act , Capitol_Hill insiders say the reception circuit will survive unscathed . The bill would prohibit lobbyists -- but not the specific groups they represent -- from sponsoring such events . While the number of receptions might dwindle , insiders say it would n ' t be by much . &quot; Nobody ' s worried about the receptions , &quot; said one House subcommittee staffer . &quot; Most people see them as work rather than fun . You ' re subjected_to these boring pitches . Anyway , I can ' t imagine any lawmaker ' s position being influenced by a_couple_of greasy hors d ' oeuvres. &quot; Some say that outlawing receptions would drain Capitol_Hill of its culinary lifeblood . &quot; I went_to these things for years , and let me tell you , the issues are completely irrelevant , &quot; said one former congressional staffer . &quot; I went . I ate . I had a good time . &quot; I ' m a sociable guy , but when I ' d walk into a reception I would n ' t want to talk . I ' d zero_in on the best food and just stand there , shamelessly eating -- not coming_up for air . &quot; I ' d look_around and see other people doing exactly the same thing . And I ' d say , ' Go_ahead , brother . Chow down. ' &quot; Margaret Um , an intern in Horn ' s office , said food isn ' t always the goal at receptions . She bases her attendance on the issue involved . Sometimes , it pays_off in other ways . At one reception by a group opposing the use of animals in laboratory tests , she received free perfume researched through chemical , not animal , techniques . For novices , receptions provide an entree into the bounties of Capitol_Hill . Veterans , however -- who may have risen to salary levels where freeloading is less tempting -- are embarrassed that they ever frequented the circuit , saying they now prefer to go_home , walk their dog -- even cook their own dinner . &quot; They get real boring , &quot; said Mickey Pollock , an aide to Rep . Carlos J . Moorhead ( R-Glendale ) . &quot; You see the same people , eat the same things . After a while , it just becomes this routine of dressed-up finger_food and small_talk . &quot; Anyway , you can only eat so many weenies on a toothpick before you either go_out of your mind or gain 20 pounds. &quot; Nasarenko has his own version of the pilgrim ' s progress . &quot; First you hit the reception circuit . Then you grow up. &quot; * When it comes_to shameless reception freeloading on Capitol_Hill , Russell Batson wrote the booklet . The former congressional aide has compiled helpful hints gleaned from years of crashing hundreds of receptions in his 32-page &quot; Eat Free in DC : A Guide to Budget-Neutral Dining. &quot; He rates the best and worst Capitol_Hill receptions , from the dizzying heights of the Louisiana Congressional Delegation party and its alligator in piquant sauce and giant shrimp , to the lowly hot dogs served by the American Council of Shopping_Centers . &quot; You can eat like Elvis without spending a dime , &quot; Batson wrote in the popular booklet , which sells for $ 5.95. &quot; What a country ! &quot; Batson tells how to confront occasional door security . There are even grazing tips for the stand-up reception scene , such_as the one-handed plate stack where you use your drink tumbler to support your plate , leaving the other hand free to work the fork . &quot; I was pleased to see Bill_Clinton using this technique , &quot; Batson wrote , &quot; a testament to its efficiency and capacity to provide an uninterrupted flow of very large volumes of food. &quot; After consuming oceans of cream_sauces and dips himself , Batson says the book was a natural . &quot; I got_into this conversation once about whether you could eat free every night and decided you could -- with a little bit of ingenuity. &quot; And then there are the food-mooching war stories . &quot; The legendary figure is Strom Thurmond , &quot; Batson said . &quot; He ' s well-known for making a beeline to the jumbo shrimp , stuffing his pockets full. &quot; Batson also has a tip on how to avoid lobbyists at receptions . &quot; These selfish individuals will attempt to interrupt your feeding frenzy to discuss legislation , &quot; he wrote . &quot; If approached , try ' signing , ' making frequent gestures to your food and sweeping motions in their direction . If all else fails , remember it is their food ; listen to their pitch , nod and say , ' Good point. ' &quot; But reception freeloading has its dangers . &quot; There have been buffet tables where I was afraid of losing a finger , &quot; Batson said . &quot; So many forks , all working at once. &quot; * The mango chutney coating the coconut shrimp glistened greasily under the direct ceiling light , bending Mark Brasher ' s mouth into a frown of distaste . Brasher , a 27-year-old legislative aide to Rep . Horn , was doing the shake-and-bake -- Capitol slang for shaking hands and freeloading food -- at an event sponsored by the Food Distribution Industry . For years , the former Long_Beach resident lived the reception life before settling into semi-retirement , choosing only the most promising affairs . Before him , on a table adorned with a massive flower_arrangement , lay a spread of miniature pastry puffs with tarragon chicken_salad , cherry_tomatoes stuffed with tuna-caper mousse . There were chicken tenders with Dijonnaise sauce , miniature quiche tartlets and mushrooms stuffed with crab souffle . &quot; Average at best , &quot; he sniffed , moving his toothpick toward the stuffed mushrooms . &quot; You ' d think they ' d do_better . It ' s oily fat food . I mean , how long can you go_on eating this ? &quot; All around him , in the carpeted conference_room lined by state flags in the basement of the Capitol , half_a_dozen members of Congress , staffers and a bevy of food distribution lobbyists were doing just fine scarfing down everything within their reach . People push for second and third helpings . One man balances two plates , a wineglass and beer_can , knowing he has to work fast . With the reception an hour old , the food and the crowd are thinning . Brasher has little patience for such scenes . While he stomachs the annual ice_cream manufacturer ' s reception , considered a must-attend event across Capitol_Hill , he draws_the_line at the Southern watermelon growers ' bash , where scantily_clad young beauty queens compete in a seed-spitting contest . &quot; It ' s a humiliating spectacle , &quot; he said . &quot; You ask yourself , ' How could they do that ? ' &quot; The purpose of this night ' s event is to award several congressmen pewter statues to signify their work_on issues dear to the industry . And , of course , to eat . Two women sneaking nibbles from their plastic plates say the tales of sumptuous food and wild reception parties are overblown . &quot; People tell tall_tales , &quot; says Charla Worsham . &quot; Most of these things involve stale chips and sauce. &quot; Bending low over the quiche tart tray , Rep . Robert Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) says such receptions serve a good purpose . &quot; Before I was a congressman , I used to come here to lobby for the POW-MIA cause . I had five little kids all under 10 years old and I was_on a budget , &quot; he recalls . &quot; So I skipped breakfast and lunch and chowed down on The Hill at night . But it ' s where I conducted most of my business . I knew it ' s where I could find the congressmen. &quot; He directs a listener to the shrimp tray , saying lobbyist receptions save taxpayer money . &quot; We work our young staffers hard , late into the night , past the times restaurants close . So they come_down here , get their energy levels up and come_back to work. &quot; This is the kind of talk lobbyists like to hear . &quot; There are lots of underpaid staff here for free food -- it ' s a fact of life , &quot; says Chris Galen , a food distribution spokesman , pointing to a $ 6 # 000 reception bill . &quot; There ' s not much we can do . This is a goodwill reception . We want to keep our congressmen happy . Part of that job is keeping their staffs happy as well. &quot; Perhaps the most fascinating spectacle amid the feeding frenzy is the performance put_on by freeloaders trying to escape the lobbyists ' sales pitch . The message-bearers are often inescapable , and can sometimes bring a blush of shame to the cheek of even the most dedicated freeloader . &quot; I had this one buzz-killing experience I ' ll never forget , &quot; recalled one reception hopper . &quot; I was at this reception for the National Head Injury Foundation , scarfing down good food when out comes this guy in a wheelchair . &quot; You could tell he used to be real sharp and they wheeled him over and started talking policy and funding . And I said to myself , ' Oh , jeez . This is bad . I can ' t listen to this . I ' m just a freeloader. ' &quot;</TEXT>
