   <HEADLINE> LET ' S DO OUR PART , DON ' T SHIRK ; MINOR TEMPORARY INCREASES IN STATE TAXES TO DIG WAY_OUT OF EARTHQUAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Jan . 17 earthquake , whose magnitude is expected to be officially raised to 6.8 by the National Earthquake Information Center , was the most powerful ever to affect a large U.S. population . It was also the costliest , with Gov . Pete Wilson ' s Administration now estimating losses at $ 13 billion to $ 20 billion . The question of how to pay_for repairs and reconstruction remains as compelling as ever . The Clinton_Administration and Congress , demonstrating one of the virtues of federalism , are_on track to treat Southern California generously , with close to $ 9.5 billion in aid expected eventually . Private insurance payouts could total about $ 2.5 billion more . Wilson ' s office puts the state ' s repair cost at $ 1.9 billion , with local_governments facing a $ 135-million bill . Once upon a time the state could simply have tapped its considerable tax-revenue surplus to meet its obligations . But the cupboard has long since been emptied . How , then , should the state best meet its obligation ? Wilson continues to incline toward the slow , politically cautious and ultimately quite expensive route of a bond issue . Far more preferable , we think , is to apply pay-as-you-go financing to the repairs -- as was done_in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta quake in the Bay Area -- using very modest , selective and temporary statewide tax_hikes . Sen . Quentin L . Kopp ( I-San Francisco ) , chairman of the Transportation Committee , proposes boosting gasoline_taxes a mere two cents a gallon for 3 1 / 2 years to raise $ 1 billion for earthquake-related repairs and vitally needed seismic safety retrofitting of bridges , overpasses and the_like . Our own earlier preference was for a larger gas tax over a shorter period , not least because the price of gasoline has fallen so_much . However , the Legislature now has before it bills calling_for the smaller gas tax and a temporary one-quarter-percent increase in the sales tax ; the sales tax_boost would yield $ 1.5 billion . These are affordable and equitable increases , and they are clearly necessary to help restore normal civic and economic life . Washington is ready to do its share . Now it ' s California ' s turn .</TEXT>
