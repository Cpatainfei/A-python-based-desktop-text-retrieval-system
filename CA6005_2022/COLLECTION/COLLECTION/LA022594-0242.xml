   <HEADLINE> U.N. CONFIDENT PLAN WILL END BOSNIA ' S CROAT-MUSLIM CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Applying the same mind-over-matter strategy that has restored peace in Sarajevo despite a shortage of enforcement troops , U.N. officials said Thursday that they are plunging ahead with an even more daunting step toward ending the Bosnian blood bath . The civilian head of the U.N. Protection Force , Yasushi Akashi of Japan , confidently predicted after brokering a cease-fire between Bosnian Croat and government troops set to begin today that he had &quot; no doubt it will be honored scrupulously. &quot; Seeking to build_on the success of the tense but so far durable calm in Sarajevo brought_on by a similar truce announced here two weeks ago , U.N. military and political_leaders have worked_out a four-step plan for repairing a deadly rift between Croats and Muslims . The two groups have been fighting over the scraps of Bosnian territory left after a massive land-grab by rebel Bosnian Serbs . But trust between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims , who were allied against the Serb nationalist rebellion for the first year of the siege , has evaporated over the last 10 months of vicious fighting unmitigated by Western mediators ' plan for carving_up the republic into three ethnic ministates along the lines of what territory each community holds . The March 7 deadline proposed for the withdrawal of heavy artillery from the scattered Muslim-Croat flash_points in central and southern Bosnia has been modeled after the formula used in Sarajevo , but it lacks the threat of NATO air strikes against violators -- the stick that was seen as the prime motivation for partial Bosnian Serb compliance with the U.N. order for demilitarization of the capital . The U.N. mission , which has 12 # 000 troops in Bosnia , is clearly stretched by the current focus of manpower on Sarajevo to monitor the cease-fire and keep_up the pressure on Bosnian Serb rebels , who have yet to genuinely comply with NATO ' s order . Hundreds of heavy Serb guns remain within the 12-mile exclusion zone that NATO declared around Sarajevo , despite the deadline for withdrawal that expired early Monday . A renewed U.N. appeal for 2 # 500 more troops to enforce the tense peace in Sarajevo was issued last week and has yet to draw any positive reply . Likewise , a U.N. request last May for 7 # 600 soldiers to establish havens for embattled Muslims in six Bosnian cities attracted less than half the desired reinforcements , leaving the U.N. mission severely shorthanded and unable to deploy peacekeepers to several of the proclaimed safe zones that remain under siege . How the mission will ensure compliance by the Bosnian government and Croatian forces fighting across a broad swath of central territory has yet to be explained by U.N. officials , who have already had to redeploy troops from other Balkans peacekeeping tasks to bolster the patrols in Sarajevo . &quot; The principles and mechanisms that were successful in Sarajevo are applicable &quot; elsewhere in the republic , said British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia . Rose has battled all this week to play_down widespread Bosnian Serb violations of the NATO ultimatum , spotlighting instead the genuine reprieve from bombardment that has followed the cease-fire that he played a key role in brokering on Feb . 9 . Rose ' s de_facto policy is that threatened NATO air strikes against the remaining heavy_weapons will be withheld as long as there is no resumption of the shelling that savaged this city of 380 # 000 for almost two years . After announcement of the Muslim-Croat accord , Ante Roso of the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian army Chief_of_Staff Rasim Delic spoke optimistically of the agreement , which was brokered by Rose and Akashi . But numerous cease-fires agreed to by Muslim and Croat leaders have fallen to pieces because of fighting by renegade elements on both sides . Fighting along the Muslim-Croat fault_lines has escalated in recent days , despite a general calming trend in most areas of the republic , which is now 70 % in the hands of Bosnian Serbs , with the remainder split between the other two factions . Mortar and machine-gun fire racked the central town of Vitez , site of a major U.N. base , and two humanitarian aid convoys came under_attack from Croat-held positions near the town of Gornji Vakuf , U.N. spokesman Lt . Col . Bill Aikman said . Intensified shelling was also reported from Bosnian Serb positions against the encircled Muslim enclaves of Maglaj and Bihac -- two areas where the Serb armor withdrawn from Sarajevo is believed to be bolstering sieges not yet targeted by the U.N. mission ' s step-by-step approach to an overall peace . Maglaj has been described by the few aid workers who have managed to reach the city in recent months as the most desperate corner of beleaguered Bosnia . No food or other relief goods have been allowed through the surrounding Bosnian Serb and Croat territory since Oct . 25 . Widespread malnutrition has been reported among the Muslim community there . More_than 250 # 000 Bosnians are dead or missing after nearly 23 months of war that began when Serb nationalists rebelled against the republic ' s vote for independence from Yugoslavia in March , 1992 .</TEXT>
