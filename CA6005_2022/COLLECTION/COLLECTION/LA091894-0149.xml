   <TEXT> ' Jurassic Park ' s &quot; dinosaurs are hardly sated . After earning close to $ 1 billion in theaters worldwide , they stampede into video stores Oct . 4 with the heady goal of making director Steven Spielberg ' s &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; not only the highest grossing movie in history but also the all-time best-selling videocassette . To that end , an ambitious campaign costing $ 65 million -- roughly the same amount that it cost to make the film -- and involving numerous cross-promotions erupts full-tilt this week onto the American consciousness and will not relent until mid-January . By the end of the marketing campaign , more_than 8 billion &quot; consumer impressions &quot; will have been disseminated , and the average person will have heard of the &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; video more_than 25 times during the promotion . The goal is to top the previous best-selling title , Disney ' s animated &quot; Aladdin , &quot; which has sold an estimated 24 million copies and previously held the record for most expensive marketing campaign . ( Spielberg ' s own &quot; E.T. : The Extra-Terrestrial &quot; is the best-selling live-action video , with 14 million. ) &quot; ' Jurassic Park ' is more_than a movie being released on videocassette , &quot; says Louis Feola , president of MCA Home Video Inc. , in explaining why so_much effort is being expended on a title that would seem to be able to sell itself . &quot; It ' s a franchise opportunity for the company , and we are extending that franchise with this video release , &quot; he says . &quot; That , combined with the desire to make this the biggest film of all time on video , drives us to create this mega-promotion. &quot; In other words , don ' t think_of this advertising onslaught as just the hawking of one videocassette . Think_of it as ingraining you to see any potential sequels and ride the probable ride at Universal Studios . In case you ' ve just been thawed out from a block of ice dating to the Paleolithic Era , &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; is Spielberg ' s blockbuster adaptation of Michael Crichton ' s novel about an eccentric developer ( Sir Richard Attenborough ) who creates an island theme park stocked with dinosaurs borne from fossilized DNA . When the park is visited by scientists Alan Grant ( Sam Neill ) , Ellie Sattler ( Laura Dern ) and Ian Malcolm ( Jeff Goldblum ) , Malcolm ' s chaos theory is brought_to vibrant life as the dinosaurs begin a savage search for their next meals . &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; grossed more_than $ 900 million worldwide ( $ 350 million in the United States alone ) , spawned a record 1 # 100 pieces of ancillary marketing and won three Oscars for its technical brilliance . It will sell for $ 24.98 ( less rebates ) on videocassette ( either pan-and-scan or letterboxed ; also with Spanish subtitles ) . Letterboxed laser discs , available Oct . 12 , will go_for either $ 44.98 or $ 74.98 ( the more expensive will allow_for freeze-framing and other special_effects ) . The seeds of this video campaign were actually planted before the film ' s June , 1993 , release . &quot; We were working with the marketing department at Universal Pictures , the staff at Amblin Entertainment and the MCA / Universal merchandising department , &quot; Feola says . After the movie grossed a record $ 50 million its opening weekend , he says , &quot; we accelerated those conversations. &quot; The Oct . 4 release date was selected because traditionally the fourth quarter of the year is the biggest for sell-through video product ( those not priced for the rental market ) . What if &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; hadn ' t become the monster that devoured movie business during the summer of ' 93 ? Would the promotion of the video have been as strenuous if it had done , say , &quot; Last Action Hero &quot; business ? &quot; Without sounding overconfident , the level of performance that was anticipated on this title was never doubted , &quot; Feola says . &quot; ( MCA President and CEO Sid ) Sheinberg summoned us all to a meeting months before the film was released , and basically he presented the product and asked all_the companies ' representatives to work toward the common goal of making ' Jurassic Park ' the biggest film of all time . &quot; The machine , &quot; he says , &quot; was completely motivated. &quot; Since July , radio and cable-TV ads have been running , and video stores have been taking advance orders for the cassette , with customers who secure pre-sale copies receiving a free poster of special-effects whiz Stan Winston ' s original designs for the dinosaurs . A contest sending 15 grand-prize winners to Kauai and rewarding hundreds more with $ 300 &quot; ' Jurassic Park ' Survival Kits &quot; also began in video outlets . But this week begins the real barrage of network TV ads , which will trumpet the film ' s video release through January . Also beginning : a crossover commercial campaign with Jell-O -- which wobbled ominously in the film as dinosaurs approached . Commercials for &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; products from Kenner Toys and Tiger Electronics that mention the video join the mix_in October and run_into November , when McDonald ' s commences its massive tie-in ad_campaign -- the fast-food chain will sell other MCA / Universal titles in its restaurants ; each will have a rebate coupon for purchase of &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; ( meaning , save your receipts ) . In January , Ocean of America will tout its &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; video_game and , in the process , of course , the videocassette . In addition , MTV and the Sci-Fi Channel will promote the video release on cable TV . And , in a unique promotional gambit , the 1.9 million subscribers to the on-line computer_network CompuServe will be able to participate in a trivia contest to win a trip to Universal Studios . MCA / Universal and CompuServe hooked_up soon after the film ' s release through a &quot; Dinosaur Forum &quot; in CompuServe ' s system , in which subscribers discussed all things prehistoric . CompuServe has helped promote theatrical releases of movies before , notably &quot; The Mask , &quot; &quot; Sneakers , &quot; &quot; North &quot; and the upcoming &quot; Star Gate. &quot; But , says Alex Nikifortchuk , marketing specialist for the company , this is by far the most high-profile promotional contest for the on-line network : &quot; I knew we were interested in doing something larger with the system , and that was a way of doing it. &quot; CompuServe , Nikifortchuk says , gave MCA ad space in its glossy print magazine , and &quot; we , in turn , have one page in the coupon insert in the initial shipment of 22 million copies of the video. &quot; Feola says this synergy between studio and computer_networks will be used even more in the future . &quot; We are technology savvy , &quot; he says . &quot; Our people use on-line services . We believe that we can play well in the future and are committed to pursuing other on-line opportunities. &quot; &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; is also expected to invade more retail space than any previous videocassette . As opposed to the average rental title , which goes_out to between 27 # 000 and 32 # 000 locations , or the average sell-through video , which is available in between 50 # 000 and 60 # 000 outlets , &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; will be for_sale &quot; in not less than 75 # 000 locations , &quot; Feola says . The addition will come primarily from drug store and supermarket chains that usually do not sell videos , he explained . For the most part , competing releases have steered a wide and respectful berth of the behemoth ' s release date , with a_few notable exceptions -- Disney ' s first animated classic , 1937 ' s &quot; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , &quot; is_due later in October , with a marketing campaign more ambitious than the studio ' s one for &quot; Aladdin. &quot; That will be followed by MCA / Universal ' s own &quot; The Flintstones &quot; in early November and 20th Century Fox ' s &quot; Speed , &quot; which Fox last week elected to rush into the marketplace in mid-November as counterprogramming for &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; Team &quot; Jurassic &quot; remains unflappable . &quot; The awareness and anticipation in purchasing ' Jurassic Park ' is as high as it has ever been for any title , &quot; says Andrew Kairey , senior_vice_president of marketing and sales , MCA / Universal . &quot; The market has matured and grown to the extent that there is room out there for more_than just two or three titles. &quot; Sell-through video is the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment_industry , projected to expand 30 % from last year in the United States alone . In 1993 , 4.5 % of the 65 million to 70 million homes with VCRs bought prerecorded videocassettes every week . This year , 77 million households have VCRs , with 8 % buying prerecorded materials weekly . A lthough the &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; video will hit stores with plenty of hoopla , it won ' t come_with the added material that is an increasingly common phenomenon in the video world . Many tapes released today include a brief making-of trailer and even added scenes that were shot but cut from the theatrical version . ( For example , one might ask , whatever happened to that ailing triceratops that Laura Dern ' s character befriended ? ) &quot; There will be plans to continue marketing product in 1995 , &quot; Feola says , suggesting that there may be future versions of the movie to come_to video . &quot; It may very well entail a making-of program . That marketing is still in development. &quot; MCA / Universal ' s commitment of money and manpower to a movie that would seem to sell itself has astounded some in the video industry . &quot; that ' s huge , that ' s extraordinary , &quot; says a representative from a competing studio ' s video marketing department who requested anonymity . &quot; that ' s a large sum -- that ' s motion_picture money . They ' re giving a theatrical-style promotion for the release of a video . . . . They want a release that not only does_well but does extraordinary business. &quot; *</TEXT>
