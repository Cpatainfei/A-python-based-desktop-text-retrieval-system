   <HEADLINE> IN PURSUIT OF A FINE MESS OF MEMORIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every now and then I go_out to look_for Laurel and Hardy . I visit the concrete Silver Lake steps where they dragged the piano crate in the 1932 Academy Award-winning short , &quot; The Music Box. &quot; I drive through Culver City intersections where they spurred masses of people into hat-stomping ( or pants-ripping or pie-throwing ) riots . A few weeks ago , I dined at an Indian restaurant inside the building they drove by in an old Ford in their 1929 film , &quot; Bacon Grabbers. &quot; &quot; Damn , &quot; I thought , &quot; missed ' em by 65 years ! &quot; Last June 16 , Stan Laurel ' s birthday , I went_to Forest Lawn in Burbank to visit his grave . The spirit of Laurel and Hardy movies , at least , seemed to be with me . I got lost cruising around the cemetery in a car that squeaked like a shrieking peacock and repeatedly drove past a funeral in_progress , complete with a delicate , tinkly harpist . The solemn mourners eyed me with increasing fear at each pass . I resisted an impulse to scratch my head and smile helplessly . When I finally found Laurel ' s resting place ( after taking a wrong turn that led me to Buster Keaton ' s ) , I deposited some sort of mutated snapdragon that was all my budget allowed and whistled the old Laurel and Hardy theme_song , also known as &quot; The Cuckoo Song. &quot; You know how it goes -- ending with that repeating &quot; COO-koo , COO-koo. &quot; Well -- and this is the God ' s truth -- when I finished , the mockingbirds picked_up the &quot; COO-koos. &quot; I couldn ' t decide whether it was poignant or eerie . Or funny . And , yes , on the way_out I got lost and squeaked past that funeral again . I am not alone in my odd pursuit of Stan and Ollie . Lots of other people go_out and look_for them , too . There are , for such people , two guidebooks to the pair ' s movie sites : the painstakingly researched &quot; Pratfall &quot; ( Vol . 2 ) , written by Bob Satterfield and friends and published by the Valley-based Way Out West Tent of the Sons of the Desert , the durable local chapter of the international Laurel and Hardy appreciation society ; and &quot; Following the Comedy Trail , &quot; by Leon Smith , a former Los Angeles Police_Department detective who includes Laurel and Hardy and &quot; Our Gang &quot; locations . Why such interest ? It occurs to me , with the 102nd anniversary of Oliver Hardy ' s birth Tuesday , that aside from originality and comedy , &quot; the boys &quot; symbolized love , bravery , friendship , dignity , perseverance , undying loyalty and innocence in the face of merciless absurdity and chicanery . I have no argument with Kurt Vonnegut ' s appraisal of them as angels in his novel , &quot; Slapstick. &quot; And there ' s a little more to it . Tied_up in my periodic searches for Laurel and Hardy , and in the guidebooks , is a search for old L.A. -- that more innocent series of communities connected by great , formidable Pacific Electric lines . To wit , when I see a Red Car cruising down Hoover Avenue in the duo ' s &quot; Hog Wild &quot; ( 1930 ) , I drink_up the scene , trying hard to imagine what it must have been like to ride_on that Red Car . When I see Stan and Ollie haul that crate up those pristine steps_in that young Silver Lake neighborhood , I am there , trying to breathe that less complicated 1932 air along with them . The movies -- and their remaining landmarks -- are time travel . I went_out looking_for Laurel and Hardy again a_few weeks ago , at the Hollywood Heritage Museum . It seemed a good place to try . The Silent Society and the Society of Operating Cameramen were hosting a fund-raiser there for a commemorative plaque to be placed at the foot of the &quot; Laurel and Hardy Steps &quot; in Silver Lake . The evening ' s program featured a_few old comedies shot at the steps -- including &quot; The Music_Box &quot; -- and Ray Bradbury . Bradbury read aloud his old short_story , &quot; The Laurel and Hardy Love_Affair &quot; ( published in &quot; The Toynbee Convector &quot; ) for the crowd of 50 or so . It concerns two lovers united because they liked to look_for Laurel and Hardy . Most of their dates , in fact , are spent picnicking at the steps . Sensing a kindred spirit , I later phoned Bradbury . The author offered that the museum reading had moved him to resurrect an unpublished 30-year-old short_story also focusing_on Laurel and Hardy and to polish it up . ( &quot; So we ' ll see now if we get someone to publish this , &quot; he said , incredibly enough . &quot; You can never tell. &quot; ) He summarized the story . &quot; It ' s called ' Another Fine Mess , ' &quot; Bradbury said . &quot; In it , the ghosts of Laurel and Hardy run_up and down the ( Silver Lake ) stairs late at night . This woman who lives nearby hears them shouting at 3 o ' clock_in the morning , goes_out , can ' t see anything , and hears the ' music_box ' ( piano crate ) tumbling down the steps . &quot; She calls her friend , who ' s an expert on motion_picture history , and they both go_out and listen . And they say to each other , why are they here ? Why are they letting the ' music_box ' chase them down the stairs , and then come_up again ? And they theorize , well , maybe they want to hear one last time , ' We love you. ' Maybe we didn ' t give them enough love while they were alive . Could that possibly be ? &quot; ( In actuality , it could . Biographers suggest that the comics , especially Hardy , who died in 1957 , probably did not realize how deeply they were appreciated. ) &quot; And finally , one of the ladies leans forward and calls_down the steps into the darkness , ' You know , we love you . You don ' t have to come here and haunt the steps anymore . You can be at_peace because you know that my friend here and I love you. ' Then they hear the voices going_down the stairs , and they have second_thoughts . They say , ' Well , don ' t go_away forever . Once a year come_back here so we can say it all_over again , &quot; We love you. &quot; ' And then they stand there , both of them weeping , and the sounds disappear down into black_and_white Los Angeles. &quot; * After our chat , I drove into Technicolor Los Angeles -- specifically , to the steps ( between 923 and 935 Vendome Street ) . They ' re surrounded by homes now and overgrown with bougainvillea and jade plants . The placid and civilized little neighborhood of &quot; The Music_Box &quot; has long given_way to graffiti , bars on windows and back yards full of Dobermans . I walked up and down the 131 cracked stairs where Stan and Ollie played Sisyphus with a piano , slavering guard_dogs snarling at me . I pictured their horse-drawn delivery wagon in the street below , and Laurel yelling up the stairs to beleaguered Hardy that an angry cop wants to talk to &quot; the other monkey , &quot; meaning Hardy . I knocked_on a door of one home that does appear in the movie and talked to a nice young guy named Jiro Yamaguchi , a classical Indian percussionist who plays Thursday nights at nearby Paru ' s . He told me that people come_by &quot; every couple of weeks &quot; to look_at the steps and that &quot; they tend to be a little older. &quot; I found evidence of the visitors . A gentleman named Mauro Simonini had carefully printed two messages on the steps , in large black_letters . The first read , in Italian : &quot; A S . Laurel &amp; O . Hardy , con affetto , Mauro Simonini , Livorno , Italia , 10-16-93. &quot; The second referred to the pair as &quot; Stanlio &quot; and &quot; Ollio , &quot; their characters ' Italian-esque names in the 1931 feature &quot; Fra Diavolo. &quot; It read : &quot; A Stanlio e Ollio , i grandissimi con infinito affetto -- Mauro. &quot; ( Translation : &quot; To Stan and Ollie , the great ones , with infinite affection. &quot; ) I stood there , reflecting on the people who look_for Laurel and Hardy : Ray Bradbury , who looks in his typewriter ; members of the Society of Operating Cameramen and the Silent Society , who are looking in a plaque ; Mauro Simonini , who came halfway around the world to seek them in the old L.A. steps of Silver Lake ; the Sons of the Desert , who celebrate their work and memory all year long -- and me . And it struck me that a person couldn ' t ask_for any greater gift . So happy 102nd , Ollie . Con infinito affetto .</TEXT>
