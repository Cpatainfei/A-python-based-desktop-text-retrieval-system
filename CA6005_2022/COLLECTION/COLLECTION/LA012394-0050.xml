   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; MAKING MAGIC FROM THE MUNDANE ; TERRY FOX ' S WORK IS SPIRITUAL WITH A SECULAR SLANT , EXPLORING THE ORDER AND MEANINGIN OUR SEEMINGLY RANDOM EXISTENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As an artist , Terry Fox has always seemed to be a European who happened to be born American ( in Seattle , to be precise , in 1943 ) . His work addresses matters of great philosophical complexity , which are most often suggested by objects and drawings of spartan simplicity . A spiritual dimension is at his art ' s core , but in a manner that chafes against material limitations without getting unctuous or affected . Fox , whose touring 20-year survey of Conceptual art is currently at the Otis Art_Gallery , has in fact spent a good_deal of time in Europe . He went_to Rome shortly after high_school to study at the Accademia di Belle Arti . He was in Paris in 1968 , where his participation in the dramatic student uprisings had a profound effect on his artistic direction . His first European gallery shows were in 1972 , and he ' s had more one-person exhibitions in galleries and museums in Italy , Germany , France , Belgium , Austria and Switzerland than in the United States . In 1980 , he became a full-fledged expatriate -- moving from San Francisco and New York first to Berlin , then to Naples , on to Florence and , since 1988 , to Liege , Belgium , where he currently resides . The survey exhibition ' s useful catalogue , written by art_dealer and former curator Constance Lewallen , pointedly notes that Fox chose to leave the United States for good &quot; just after President Reagan had taken office. &quot; It ' s easy to see why : A spartan aesthetic concerned with issues of spiritual and philosophical moment is hardly compatible with a period whose profile is most vividly marked by consuming greed and debilitating political duplicity . Tellingly , the Otis show was organized by Elsa Longhauser at the Moore College of Art andDesign in Philadelphia and will travel next to the University Art Museum at UC Berkeley . American art_schools and universities , unlike most American museums , have always been more open_to exhibiting artists whose concerns are not manifest in the fabrication of traditional objects . At Otis , Fox ' s spare materials include some piano_wire , a_couple_of ordinary drinking_glasses , four beer_bottles , a button suspended from a pencil by a piece of string , a_few ladders , long strips of paper marked with ink and pencil , a pair of battered stools -- the stuff of everyday usefulness . Neither is there much to look_at . The show features almost three dozen works dating_from 1972 to 1992 , following a five-year period devoted to site-specific performances that cannot be reconstructed ; but none is what you might describe as &quot; visually compelling. &quot; As with other American and , especially , European Conceptual artists who emerged from the crucible of the 1960s , Fox employs the simplest materials necessary to his task . If Fox ' s spare objects aren ' t visually compelling , many are nonetheless engagingly curious . You want to puzzle them out . Unassuming but oddly inviting -- and sometimes eccentrically witty -- the best of them sneak inside your consciousness and cause a gentle ripple in the cerebral_cortex . &quot; Terry Fox : Articulations ( Labyrinth / Text Works ) &quot; begins with the artist ' s preoccupation with the metaphoric possibilities of a pre-existing structure -- namely , the famous , medieval labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral in France . Descriptive of a facet of medieval cosmology , at Chartres the labyrinth is about 43 feet in diameter and composed of rough , flat , blue-and-white paving_stones embedded in the cathedral floor . It is not an object but an articulated path . An articulated path is also perhaps the most succinct way to describe Fox ' s approach to the relationship between art and life . For the labyrinth , designed as a pattern of 11 concentric rings winding through 34 turns along 552 steps to its inevitable center , is plainly a metaphor for life ' s circuitous journey . At Chartres the journey is endowed with a particular religiosity : Believers would get_on their knees and recite specific prayers at each step along the path . But Fox attempts to untangle it from rigid doctrine . The mundane ma terials he chooses suggest a secular spirituality . The labyrinth turns_up in the exhibition at least a dozen times . A small plaster model is placed on a pedestal , its material suggesting the origin from which future repetitions of the object could be cast . Nearby , a plan of the labyrinth is scratched into the black , painted surface of a sheet_of_glass , allowing flickers of light to pass_through while creating a reflective surface in which you glimpse your face through the pattern . Drawings project the flat pattern of the journey into three dimensions , creating a surprising sequence of cruciform shapes . One drawing , made on a tube of clear plastic , rests inside a large glass jar . Air_holes punched_in the lid trace the winding path , while allowing oxygen for an ( unseen ) butterfly that a kid might capture in such a jar . The principles of Fox ' s cosmography apply to all things -- great and small . Another plan of the labyrinth , drawn_in black ink on a circle of paper , is suspended on a string stretched taut between two wooden stools that stand atop one another , feet to feet . This rudimentary object is in fact an unlikely model of the great cathedral . The top stool rises above the conceptual plane of the cathedral floor , coincident with the surface of the Earth . It is mirrored by the stool below , which descends to a_level equal_to an underground water-table that , according to Fox , became the actual cathedral architect ' s measurement for the height of the building ' s tallest spire . Suspended between the secret &quot; river of life &quot; below and the soaring heavens above , the labyrinth goes round . If Fox ' s use of the labyrinth as metaphor , which he explored for a half-dozen years , suggests a doctrinaire view in which all life ' s seemingly random movements are in fact worked_out in_advance , step by step along a predetermined road , the artist quickly cautions about who is truly in control . He does_it with a little game . &quot; Experiment in Autosuggestion &quot; is an unassuming work that includes instructions for a parlor_game in which you hold a button , suspended by a piece of string from a pencil , over a simple diagram . By moving your eyes in proscribed patterns , the button miraculously follows_suit , shifting directions at your eyes ' command . Miraculously , that is , until you realize that your eyes and mind have imperceptibly conspired to direct the subtle movements of your body ' s central_nervous_system . This little demonstration of the unconscious power lurking within sight and mind is both amusing and sobering -- and especially revealing for an artist who had given_up painting , with its emphasis on the visual , in favor of an artistic focus_on ideas , which is the basis of Conceptual art . A kind of &quot; Mr. Wizard &quot; quality permeates works like these , which use laymen ' s materials -- a glass jar , a button , bits of string , kitchen stools -- to demonstrate philosophical rather than scientific principles that give order and meaning to the otherwise seemingly random twists and turns of life . ( &quot; Is that a science experiment ? &quot; a child at the gallery suddenly asked_out loud , when looking_at a lead pendulum slowly revolving around a half-filled water glass. ) A spirit of playfulness is one source of the engaging curiousness of Fox ' s art , in spite of its minimal visual pull . The simplicity of materials put at the service of a secular spirit links Fox ' s work to such contemporaneous European movements as Arte Povera , in Italy , where he ' d spent much of his artistically formative life , or the performance &quot; actions &quot; of Germany ' s Joseph Beuys . However , its quirky and demonstrative tenor is also the specifically American half of this expatriate artist ' s equation , with its down-home suggestion of the artist as committed hobbyist or exalted tinkerer . There ' s nothing traditionally &quot; professional &quot; about Fox ' s approach -- no academic expertness that would otherwise separate the artist from the audience into a simple hierarchy of the skilled and the unskilled . For instance , having stretched two piano_wires the length of the gallery , with one end attached_to a sounding board , the artist has made a walk-in musical_instrument that anyone can play simply by sliding the rosin-covered wire through clenched fingers . You ' re invited to pick_up a chopstick and a sardine can , with which the instrument ' s low , resonating sound can be dramatically altered , and to play your own improvisational concert for time and space . As with many other notable artists of his generation , Fox gives_up a prevailing , popular view of art as the objectified manifestation of an interior self that is alienated from the world . Instead of a masculine , painterly tradition -- Rembrandt to Van Gogh to Pollock -- his quietly eccentric work simply attempts to externalize the mystery of consciousness . Nowhere is that effort more wittily in_evidence than in a recorded and amplified soundtrack that echoes continuously through the exhibition ' s rooms . With the twisting labyrinth at Chartres here extrapolated into the pattern of a musical_score , the low rumble of 11 cats purring in pure contentment improbably conjures the music of the spheres . * Otis Art_Gallery , 2401 Wilshire Blvd. , ( 213 ) 251-0555 , through March 6 .
