   <HEADLINE> REBEL SERBS AGREE TO CONCESSIONS TO HEAD OFF SPREAD OF WAR IN BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serbs agreed Tuesday to a cease-fire and the posting of U.N. observers around the town of Brcko , where negotiators are trying to head_off a new flare-up in the civil_war . They also agreed to let U.N. peacekeepers enter the Muslim enclave of Gorazde , another flash_point in the Balkan conflict . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after meeting top U.N. official Yasushi Akashi that his troops will observe a truce in the strategic Brcko area in northern Bosnia even if Muslim-led Bosnian government forces do not . &quot; The United Nations will be deploying more military liaison officers in the area of Brcko , and we will be establishing more observation_posts , &quot; Akashi told reporters after the meeting in Pale . Muslims and Serbs have accused each other of a buildup of forces around the Bosnian Serb-held river valley town . Brcko lies_in a narrow strip that links Serb-held territories in Bosnia and Croatia to Serbia itself . The 70 % of Bosnian territory Serbs now control resembles a horseshoe , and at one point near Brcko it is only three miles wide . Muslim forces are to the south , and Croatia lies to the north . France has urged the United Nations to give Brcko the same protective shield as six embattled Muslim-held parts of Bosnia that the world body has declared safe areas . Akashi and Karadzic also discussed the enclave of Gorazde , in eastern Bosnia , and deteriorating relations between the Serbs and U.N. peacekeepers . Akashi said the Serbs agreed to let a convoy of 168 British troops heading for Gorazde proceed . The Serbs protested an incident last Friday when U.N. tanks lobbed 72 shells at Serbian positions near the northern town of Tuzla , which the Serbs say killed nine civilians . The United Nations says the peacekeeping troops were responding to Serbian attacks .</TEXT>
