   <HEADLINE> SEX PLAY IN CYBERSPACE ; O.C. FIRM ' S CD-ROMS ARE EROTIC , INTERACTIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The image of Stephanie , a busty blonde woman , invites you to touch the computer_screen . You play the age-old game of scissors-stone-paper with her , tapping a menu on the screen to make your selection . You make your move , she makes hers . If you win , she seductively unwraps a layer of clothing , writhing to striptease music . If you lose , she smirks and coos , &quot; Try again. &quot; The playful experience is enhanced by the computer ' s video footage of the woman , her digital voice that plays in stereo and a computer-animated background resembling a science-fiction movie set . This R-rated &quot; Scissors N Stones &quot; game is a glimpse of the interactive enticements that computers can deliver . Pixis Interactive , a Tustin-based software company with 10 employees , says it has discovered that such adult entertainment -- stored on compact_disks known as CD-ROMs with vast storage capacity for video , text , graphics and audio -- can add a whole new dimension to voyeurism . &quot; It ' s not passive viewing like TV or videos , &quot; said Mark Alamares , vice_president of marketing for the 18-month-old company . &quot; Here , you can interact with live characters on the screen . They will react to your actions accordingly. &quot; Pixis titles range from R-rated games to science-fiction dramas for both the Macintosh and IBM-compatible machines . They sell for $ 69.95 to $ 89.95 , the typical prices for CD-ROMs . Not surprisingly , sex has become quite comfortable with the computer medium . Penthouse and Playboy magazines have already produced interactive computer_programs that allow viewers to act_as &quot; virtual photographers &quot; of nude women . &quot; Sex chat &quot; computer bulletin_boards , where people type provocative messages to each other via computer modems , have existed for years . At the recent Comdex computer show in Las Vegas , scores of conventioneers lined_up at booths sponsored by Pixis and nearly a dozen other adult CD-ROM purveyors . &quot; This doesn ' t surprise me because it ' s what people want , &quot; said Amin Hirschorn , who took time to browse at the Pixis trade show booth . &quot; Here you can touch the screen , but not the woman. &quot; &quot; The quality is really surprising , &quot; said Kelly Ramon , another onlooker . &quot; There ' s a trend in society . You ' re seeing more sex in movies , and this is something creative that will compete with it. &quot; Erotica , pornography and adult entertainment usually find their way onto any new medium , Alamares said . &quot; Dial-a-porn &quot; telephone_services mushroomed in the 1980s with the advent of 900 numbers . VCR manufacturers got a boost as customers found it more convenient to watch adult videos in privacy at_home instead of facing embarrassment at being recognized at the local porn cinema . Excitement about an information superhighway , where interactive computers promise to deliver addictive realism to simulations and games , is being driven_in part by the expectation of digital sex . &quot; CD-ROMs are in the novelty stage now , very small in sales , &quot; said Lisa Palac , editor of Future Sex , a quarterly magazine in San Francisco that chronicles the link between sex , culture and technology . &quot; But the interest among people is phenomenal . Among computer people , it ' s one more thing they can do with their computer. &quot; If society can be enthralled by the engaging interactive aspect of video_games , then interactive sex will probably prove equally engaging , said Rob Kling , professor of computer_science at UC Irvine . &quot; Look_at the back pages of a lot of computer magazines and you ' ll see ads for adult material , &quot; Kling said . &quot; And if you look_at the adult video , it doesn ' t take great porno quality to fuel a large_number of purchases. &quot; Despite the concerns of computer_experts and the hopes of Pixis executives , market_analysts do not expect adult games to spread like wildfire , at least not until most consumers have high-powered multimedia personal_computers with CD-ROM_drives . An estimated 2.6 million drives were sold in 1993 , more_than the total sold from 1986 to 1991 , according to InfoTech , a market research firm in Woodstock , Vt . And nearly half of all personal_computers sold this year are expected to feature CD-ROM_drives . &quot; The adult segment is not any more successful on CD-ROMs than in any other medium , &quot; said Julie Schwerin , InfoTech president . &quot; It ' s a very small part of the industry. &quot; Of an estimated 7 # 000 CD-ROM titles available , there are only about 100 different adult titles , Palac estimates . A multimedia offering called &quot; The Interactive Adventures of Seymore Butts , &quot; produced by a Santa Monica company , has sold well_over 10 # 000 copies , a number which is considered a bestseller . Far beyond presenting titillating images on a screen is simulated sex through virtual_reality . This is the stuff of science-fiction movies , such_as in Sylvester Stallone ' s &quot; Demolition Man &quot; : A couple wears goggles that transport them into a three-dimensional , computer-generated world where they can have sexual_intercourse without actually touching . Palac said such technology is still in the early development stages . The growing culture of &quot; cyberporn &quot; has feminists outraged and fearful of the psychological damage it could do to both women and men at a time of increasing concern about sexual abuse and child molestation . A frightening dimension of interactive porn is that it can encourage men to treat women as objects to be manipulated , they argue . &quot; It ' s marketed as a more sophisticated kind of high-tech entertainment , &quot; said Lisa McLanahan , one of the coordinators of the Bay View chapter of the National Organization for Women . &quot; Any man who has the idea of himself as the preppy , sophisticated porn user is fooling himself . &quot; Like all pornography , it works to oppress women , &quot; she said . &quot; What is different is the ability to create a woman of your dreams and control her on screen so that the man viewing it becomes the pornographer himself. &quot; Paul Wu , the 27-year-old president of Pixis , argues that CD sex is no worse than erotica in other media , and that it can even have its health benefits . &quot; With the prevalence of diseases , we ' re directing sexual energies , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s the ultimate safe_sex . We think ' Scissors N Stones ' is tamer than Playboy. &quot; Whether or not sexually themed CD-ROMs become a mass market on the scale of adult videos , which are a staple in many neighborhood video stores , the founders of Pixis believe they ' ve found a place to profit in the emerging format of CD-ROM , which stands_for compact_disk / read-only_memory . These CDs for computers can store more_than 600 times the amount of data in a typical floppy_disk , making_it possible for games to feature complex three-dimensional animation . Last weekend at the Consumer Electronics Show , about a dozen companies were showing adult movies on CD-ROMs . Among the exhibitors was Pixis ' primary competitor , New Machine Publishing in Santa Monica , which has developed more_than 20 adult CD-ROMs over the past year . Some of New Machines ' titles , such_as the newly released &quot; Dream Machine , &quot; will be sold in Tower Video , Fry ' s Electronics and Virgin Megastores . Lawrence Miller , co-founder and an owner of New Machine , said that Pixis and his company have set themselves apart from other firms by pioneering the use of computer animation in adult CD-ROMs . &quot; Everyone else dumps video onto CD-ROM because it ' s a new way to make money from their own material , &quot; he said . &quot; that ' s not interactive. &quot; Miller acknowledges that the visual quality of CD-ROMs is worse than videos , but he said most people don ' t mind because of the added value of interactive play . &quot; Our interest is in interactivity , not just the adult segment , &quot; said Alamares of Pixis . &quot; We don ' t come from the adult video industry , so our offerings will emphasize better technology and themes that go beyond adult titles , like science fiction. &quot; The promise of a $ 5.8-billion industry for CD-ROM disks and drives has made some computer_experts uneasy about the spread of computer-based pornography . George Trubow , law professor at the John_Marshall Law_School in Chicago , warned of the potential harm to children from interactive adult entertainment in a recent conference on computer abuse at UC Irvine . It ' s one thing for kids to peek at nude pictures on computers , but Trubow said he fears that the improved graphic quality of today ' s personal_computers will attract all sorts of purveyors of pornography , from child pornographers to proponents of bestiality . &quot; Parents have no idea what their kids are getting_into with computers , &quot; said Valerie Rezmierski , a computer administrator at the University of Michigan , who also attended the UCI conference . &quot; I ' m very concerned about the damage that young children could suffer. &quot; Miller at New Machine said his company ' s &quot; Dream Machine &quot; title is nearly childproof : It requires password access to prevent children from watching their parents ' program when they are alone . Retail_chains such_as CompUSA and Egghead software have refused to carry titles from Pixis and New Machine . But even if mainstream companies avoid the titles , Pixis and New Machine expect to make plenty of money with adult programming . This year , Pixis expects to sell more_than 100 # 000 of its &quot; Scissors N Stones &quot; title and it expects to quadruple sales overall . The company would not release specific sales information . Alamares says Pixis has no intentions of marketing to youngsters , and its boxes are marked for &quot; mature audiences. &quot; Distribution is limited to adult stores , some computer_dealers and mail_order . Of course , there is no reason that kids can ' t order these games via mail , but Alamares says the industry can thrive by appealing_to those who want &quot; tasteful &quot; adult entertainment . &quot; A lot of retailers in this political climate won ' t carry it , &quot; Alamares said . &quot; We are making products that are done tastefully. &quot; With backgrounds in the computer_industry , the company founders sought to set themselves apart from Hollywood ' s adult industry , Wu said . The company got started with private funding and the talents of programmers just out of school . &quot; We were looking_for a way to break_into the mass market and realized that sex and entertainment has always been the driving force for the high-technology market , &quot; Wu said . Instead of churning_out numerous features like adult video producers , Pixis plans to make two to four titles a year with budgets of $ 250 # 000 to $ 1.5 million each . It uses a full-time writer to create stories , computer animators to add a multimedia experience , and the company emphasizes game playing . &quot; It ' s not just selling the sex aspect , &quot; Alamares said . &quot; We use a lot of 3D animation , live-action video and interactive game play . Sex is an important factor_in the games , but not the sole aspect of it . We mix_in action and adventure like in arcade games . It ' s a virtual movie , so to speak. &quot; One technique to draw the viewer into the experience is the use of first-person point_of_view in the &quot; camera_angles &quot; for the games , Wu said . When filming one sexual scene , Pixis ' production team created an animation as if there were a video camera tied onto one actor ' s chest so that &quot; you can feel_like you ' re performing. &quot; Actors and actresses , many drawn from adult videos , act_out a variety of scenarios for each CD-ROM , because the point of interactive technology is to present the viewer with various choices . Thus , one CD-ROM can require seven hours of filming compared to a_couple_of hours with a regular adult film , Wu said . Pixis takes that footage and turns it into a complete story or humorous game with three-dimensional animation . &quot; Scissors N Stones &quot; includes a blooper reel , which reveals actors ' mistakes , and also features a &quot; panic button , &quot; which Wu says can be used to instantly turn_off the game at_work if the boss passes_by . Palac , who reviews CD-ROMs for Future Sex , said many customers are disappointed in CD-ROMs because their computers can ' t run the video fast enough to be lifelike or play the sound correctly . &quot; The interactivity can be a real sham , sort of like multiple choice of which movie you want to see , &quot; Palac said . &quot; Computer video can look chunky , and it ' s not as convenient to watch these things on a computer . People with VCRs can watch videos in bed and fast-forward to the good_parts . The CD-ROMs right now don ' t offer anything better . When it comes_to erotic material , the bottom_line is people want to get aroused. &quot;</TEXT>
