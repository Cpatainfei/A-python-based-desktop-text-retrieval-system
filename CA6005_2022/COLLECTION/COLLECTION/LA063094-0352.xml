   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; MARADONA FACING A BAN AFTER POSITIVE DRUG TEST ; ARGENTINA : EPHEDRINE SHOWS UP IN SAMPLE . RESULTS OF CRITICAL SECOND TEST WILL BE ANNOUNCED TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Diego Maradona , one of the most brilliant and controversial figures in soccer , was at the center of a drug scandal that shook the World Cup on Wednesday after he tested positive for a banned cold medication . On the eve of Argentina ' s final first-round match , against Bulgaria tonight at the Cotton Bowl , it was announced Maradona ' s &quot; A &quot; urine sample had traces of ephedrine , an anti-asthma stimulant found in over-the-counter medications . Julio Grondona , president of the_Argentine Football Federation , made the announcement on the side of the Cotton Bowl where the players , including Maradona , were supposed to practice Wednesday evening . But instead of playing soccer , the_Argentines sat on the field in small groups looking sullen and talking with federation and FIFA officials for about a half hour . Maradona sat with his teammates near one goal , a tiny figure whose every move was scrutinized by hundreds of journalists sitting in the stands . Later , at the team hotel , Grondona said until the results of a &quot; B &quot; sample were known , it was impossible to speculate what could happen . The second sample was tested at the UCLA drug laboratory Wednesday afternoon in the presence of Raul Peidro , an Argentine team doctor , and other soccer officials . &quot; It was not a happy moment , &quot; one of the physicians said . &quot; But it was done_in a calm manner. &quot; FIFA , soccer ' s governing body , is expected to announce the results today at its World Cup headquarters in Irving , Tex . Although the players were kept_away from a swarm of reporters following the team , Maradona told a Buenos Aires television_station : &quot; It ' s my fault . I did_it . It ' s me. &quot; Still , Argentine officials listed Maradona ' s name in today ' s starting lineup . A once-magical midfielder , Maradona , 33 , is playing in what is expected to be his final World Cup tournament . Appearing in his fourth World Cup , Maradona would set a record of 22 Cup matches if he plays tonight . Jim Trecker , a spokesman for World Cup ' 94 , said the controversy will not ruin the image soccer has created in the past three weeks . &quot; It certainly is a pity when something off the field becomes bigger than on the field , &quot; he said , adding that it will not cast the tournament in a negative light . If Maradona ' s &quot; B &quot; sample is positive , FIFA ' s Organizing Committee would form a special committee to study the case and determine what sanctions , if any , to levy . Agricole de Bianchetti , a federation attorney , and Daiel Bolotnicoff , Maradona ' s attorney , were arranging meetings with FIFA officials late Wednesday . Under FIFA ' s drug policy , unlike most in American professional sports , sanctions are not specified for any particular offense , which gives FIFA flexibility in dealing with the case . &quot; If it ' s positive , Maradona could be banned , &quot; Grondona said . &quot; It could be a year ' s suspension. &quot; FIFA officials said Maradona would be suspended immediately if the second sample proves to be positive . Grondona said the team ' s standing would not be affected , that any penalty would be against individuals . Argentina won its first two matches and has six points to lead Group D . Grondona said that Ernesto Ugalde , team physician , could be sanctioned if found to have given Maradona the medication . Maradona , who was banned for 15 months in 1991 for cocaine abuse , tested positive for ephedrine after Argentina defeated Nigeria , 2-1 , in Foxboro , Mass. , on Saturday . He and teammate Sergio Vasquez were randomly selected to submit urine samples . Two players from each team are selected after every World Cup match to be tested . Grondona said the drug was a nasal spray not prescribed by the team doctor but by Maradona ' s private physician . Maradona was said to have taken the medication to combat flu , and claimed he did not know it was a banned substance . He claimed his physician forgot to tell federation doctors about the medication . If so , it was a reckless act , according to those familiar_with FIFA ' s drug-testing policy . Not only was a drug hotline set_up by Donald Catlin , director the UCLA drug laboratory that is handling the World Cup specimens , but teams must declare before each game what drugs they have taken . Ephedrine , once a popular drug for sprinters and cyclists , is not used much by athletes anymore , Catlin said Wednesday night . Unlike some sports , doping scandals have been rare in soccer . Twice players have been dismissed from the World Cup_finals by FIFA for using drugs . The first was defender Ernest Jean-Joseph of Haiti in Germany in 1974 . But his team manager refused to send him home and he had to be extradited by security men sent from Haiti . He never played again . At the 1978 finals in Argentina , Willie Johnston of Scotland was sent home_in disgrace and banned for taking an illegal drug for medicinal purposes . Times staff writer Julie Cart contributed to this story from Los Angeles .
