   <HEADLINE> 2 EUROPEAN FIRMS TO BUY 20 % OF SPRINT ; COMMUNICATIONS : FRENCH AND GERMAN PHONE MONOPOLIES WILL SPEND $ 4.2 BILLION FOR THE STAKE IN THE U.S. LONG-DISTANCE CARRIER , HELPING IT TO COMPETE WITH AT &amp; T AND MCI .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jockeying for a better position in the increasingly competitive world telecommunications market , the telephone monopolies of France and Germany said Tuesday that they will spend $ 4.2 billion for a 20 % stake in Sprint Corp. , America ' s third-largest long-distance carrier . The investment by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom , if approved by regulatory_authorities in each country , will give Sprint the global reach and financial muscle it needs to compete with market leaders AT &amp; T and MCI . The new alliance will assume &quot; a leading role in the world league of telecommunications , &quot; said Helmut Ricke , chairman of Deutsche Telekom . He said Sprint will help the German telecommunications giant crack the U.S. market and tackle emerging Asian markets . The three partners plan to create &quot; regional operating groups &quot; around the world that would use their combined resources to offer package deals on international telecommunications services to business and residential long-distance customers . &quot; This partnership will create the single-source provider with global account responsibility that the marketplace is looking_for , &quot; said William Esrey , Sprint chief_executive . Wall_Street responded coolly to the widely rumored deal because Sprint would receive the money later than previously expected , S.G. Warburg analyst William Deatherage said . France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom together would buy 42.9 million shares of a new class of Sprint shares for $ 2.03 billion next April . A similar number of shares would be purchased for up_to $ 2.19 billion two years later . But Deatherage and other analysts following Sprint have reiterated their &quot; buy &quot; recommendations for the stock , which fell $ 2.75 to close at $ 37.125 in New York Stock_Exchange trading . The deal comes just a week after Sprint , based in Kansas City , Mo. , broke_off merger talks with computer integration leader EDS Corp . The talks failed when General Motors Corp. , EDS ' parent , refused to value Sprint at the high premium the European telecommunications companies had agreed to pay in preliminary talks . Sprint ' s new_deal may face tough obstacles . Regulatory approval by the Justice_Department and the Federal Communications Commission could be delayed or denied because of U.S. concerns over the inaccessibility of Europe ' s telecommunications_equipment and service markets . &quot; There ' s something very wrong when telephone_companies like the France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom monopolies can buy_into the U.S. telecommunications market while keeping their home markets closed tighter than a drum , &quot; said Victor Pelson , chairman of AT &amp; T Global Operations . &quot; We urge the United States_government to condition approval of the proposed equity investments in Sprint on the_French and German governments ' opening their telecommunications markets. &quot; AT &amp; T raised similar objections last year when British Telecom announced it would pay $ 4.3 billion for a 20 % stake in MCI . The MCI deal has yet to be approved by U.S. regulatory_authorities , but analysts say its chances are good because Britain is relatively open by European standards . The French and German monopolies ' investment in Sprint is both an outward push and a response to increasing competition in their own markets for large business customers from new local and international players . &quot; France Telecom is a major player in data services , &quot; said USC telecommunications expert Bill Davidson . &quot; When combined with Sprint , they will be formidable. &quot; Analysts say Sprint , which had $ 11 billion in revenue last year , and its monopoly partners face a huge challenge in merging their cultures . &quot; Sprint is the little yapping dog that won ' t let_go , &quot; said Jay Batson , senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge , Mass . &quot; They are very tenacious and aggressive . that ' s very different from the way the monopolies have had to think. &quot; A Distant Third Sprint is far behind industry leaders AT &amp; T and MCI in the fiercely competitive long-distance phone business . The U.S. market share of the carrriers , based on annual sales : AT &amp; T 60 % MCI 20 % Sprint 10 % Other 10 % Source : Company reports</TEXT>
