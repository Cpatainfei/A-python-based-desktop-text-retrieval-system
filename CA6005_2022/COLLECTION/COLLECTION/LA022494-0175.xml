   <TEXT> Stone_crabs are in season from mid-October to mid-May , and only the claws are harvested . Since they are highly perishable , they are quickly boiled and chilled . Because of the thickness of the shell , the claws are usually sold with the shells cracked or removed . If crab claws are not available for the following recipe , try the salad with jumbo shrimp instead . Either way , this dish is enhanced by the recipe for Joe ' s mustard_sauce from Joe ' s Stone_Crab Restaurant in Miami .
