   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA BOMBS CHECHEN OIL PLANT ; DUDAYEV SEEKS TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian bombers hit a giant petroleum complex in Chechnya on Thursday , striking at the oil_industry that is this breakaway republic ' s economic lifeblood . And as Russian warplanes and troops using laser-guided missiles intensified their attacks on the besieged city , Chechen President Dzhokar M . Dudayev reportedly told the Kremlin that he is ready for peace talks . But it was unclear whether Dudayev was making another of the empty offers that Moscow and Grozny have repeatedly exchanged since Russia sent troops to crush Chechnya ' s 3-year-old campaign for independence . Chechen officials said Dudayev sent a telegram to Russian Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , saying he is willing to negotiate at any level with no preconditions . After representatives in Chernomyrdin ' s office said they had not received the telegram , Dudayev reportedly sent a similar one to President Boris N . Yeltsin . In the Chechen capital of Grozny , a great black cloud loomed in the bright_blue sky from the explosion at the oil_refinery complex in the Karpinsky Kurgan district , on the southwestern outskirts of the city . Heavy bombing and shelling made_it impossible to get close enough to the refinery to assess the damage . At dusk , however , flames could be seen shooting out of the refinery , and there were unconfirmed reports that a bomb had landed on an oil tank . Russian Human_Rights Commissioner Sergei A . Kovalev reported from Grozny that the blaze threatened to spread to nearby tanks of chlorine , ammonia and hydrogen . The information war continued Thursday as Chechen authorities claimed that they had shot down three Russian aircraft , and Russians insisted that no planes had been hit . Russian military officials said they had begun using laser-guided missiles to attack pro-Dudayev forces that brought tanks and heavy artillery out from the city_center to confront the Russians . A Russian Defense Ministry official assured the Interfax news_agency that these &quot; smart bombs &quot; would cause &quot; virtually no civilian casualties. &quot; * After a morning of ominous quiet , Russian warplanes roared repeatedly over the city . The thunder of their bombs reverberated against the largely deserted presidential palace , sending even hard-core Chechen guards scurrying for cover . Dudayev was reported to be pinned inside a bomb_shelter under the palace , and aides told reporters by telephone that they could not get_out . Still , in the face of the overwhelmingly superior Russian force , the Chechen commandos remained defiant . &quot; Let the Russians bomb us all they want , they can ' t kill all_of us , &quot; said Imran Abzuyev , commander of a Chechen unit . &quot; We have no way back , we ' ll stand to the end. &quot; Abzuyev was patrolling the central open-air_market in Grozny to enforce a new ban on once lively weapons sales there . Chechens were allowed only to exchange their arms for others , he said . The ban appeared aimed at preventing Chechen deserters from selling their weapons and running_off with the money -- a crack in the usual facade of united anti-Russian defenses . In Grozny too , 10 days of Russian bombing was taking its toll . With the water_system knocked_out , residents lined_up at street-side pumps with buckets that they had to lug back to their apartments . Lines for bread spilled into the street . With most women and children evacuated , the majority of residents left in town appeared to be elderly Russians with nowhere else to go . Their slow , stoic progress through Grozny ' s streets to line_up for water or bread never wavered , even as bombs landed nearby . * &quot; I built the whole city , &quot; said Nikolai Yefremov , a 68-year-old construction engineer who remained in his fourth-floor apartment in central Grozny while his family was sheltered in the basement . &quot; Now , before my eyes , it ' s all being destroyed , and my tears flow. &quot; In the snowy courtyard of his building , where pigeons and dogs picked_at spilled garbage , history professor Mikhail Parkhomenko was returning with two full buckets from the water_pump at a nearby stadium . The refinery bombing had scared him badly , he said , because the smoke resembled the mushroom_cloud of a nuclear bomb . But all_in all , his mood was not_bad . When the bombing gets bad , he said , he and his ethnic Chechen friends sit in the basement and talk_about life in_general and women in particular . &quot; Everyone we talk to says they are for a peaceful political resolution of the problem , &quot; said Parkhomenko , a bright-eyed man in a black fedora . Others met the bombing with less equanimity . Magomed Khashiyu , a gold-toothed man of 55 , declaimed in full voice at the central market that &quot; Yeltsin is not a man , he ' s a prostitute. &quot; Khashiyu was referring to Yeltsin ' s promise Tuesday that Russia would stop hitting civilian targets in Chechnya -- a vow that was followed by two days of relentless bombing of central Grozny . Chechen soldiers did say , however , that most of the Russian bombing was aimed at concentrations of Chechen fighters in what resembled a semi-civilized &quot; war of position &quot; of the 19th Century more_than the internecine conflicts of the 20th Century . &quot; Yes , we are bombing , but only a group of armed militants , &quot; Russian Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev told reporters at the Russian base in Mozdok , Northern Ossetia . &quot; I will fire a_thousand shots to their one_shot , a_thousand shells to one shell of theirs. &quot; The Russians had left open the road southeast from Grozny to Dagestan to accommodate refugee traffic and to encourage less-than-enthusiastic Chechen youth to leave rather than fight . Russian officials said flyers had been dropped over Grozny promising safe passage out of the city for anyone holding a leaflet , but they insisted that Chechen fighters are not allowing anyone with a weapon to leave . * As Russia has bombed Chechen targets , it has also announced aid packages to help with the human cost of the war -- as though providing bandages for wounds it has inflicted . Kovalev , the human_rights commissioner who has remained in Grozny to protest the Russian attack , begged for antibiotics to prevent the many wounded from developing gangrene or peritonitis . Humanitarian organizations began asking_for canned_food , warm clothing , money and medicines . Tatiana Regent , head of the Federal Migration Service , said 37 # 000 officially registered refugees are now scattered across Dagestan , Ingushetia and in outlying regions of Chechnya . She said more_than 105 # 000 people have fled Chechnya in the last two weeks . Many are being sheltered by relatives or friends , but 2 # 000 to 2 # 500 new refugees have been appealing_to Russian officials for help every day . The agency estimates that 200 # 000 ethnic Russians have also fled Chechnya in the three years since it declared a unilateral independence from Russia that has never been recognized by other nations . These people , propelled from their homes by growing anti-Russian sentiment , will probably never go_back and will require resettlement , Regent said . Russia has requested U.N. refugee assistance for the thousands who have fled the fighting , U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Thursday . He said he has asked the U.N. refugee agency to field a mission in the region . As the war entered its 19th day , Russian officials also began to count the financial toll . Critics of the intervention wondered where the cash-strapped government would get the money to rebuild Chechnya without triggering a catastrophic rise in inflation , now running about 15 % per month . The refugee service said $ 9.8 million in additional funding will be needed in the next four weeks alone . The Railways Ministry said restoring the republic ' s blown-up and much-robbed railroad will require $ 30 million . The Finance Ministry calculated defense expenditures at $ 987 million in 1995 if hostilities continue at the current level . Finally , the Economics Ministry presented a $ 203-million list of repairs needed to restore Chechnya ' s oil_industry -- and that was before the bombing of the refinery complex . In Soviet times , Chechnya each year refined up_to 18 million tons of Caspian basin oil_pumped in by pipeline from Azerbaijan , but almost nothing was produced in 1994 because of a Russian economic blockade . The republic ' s own oil reserves are estimated at 50 million tons , considered modest by Russian standards . Goldberg reported from Grozny , Efron from Moscow .</TEXT>
