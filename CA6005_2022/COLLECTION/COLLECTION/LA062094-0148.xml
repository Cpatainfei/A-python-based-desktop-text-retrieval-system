   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; CROAT-MUSLIM PACT MAY BE UNRAVELING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a shotgun wedding ordered by Washington that ended the war between Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina , and three months into the marriage there are growing signs that it may_not last . Hard-line politicians seeking to undermine the Muslim-Croatian reconciliation are overwhelmingly outnumbered by moderates desperate for peace in both Bosnia and Croatia . But Croatian President Franjo Tudjman remains resistant to the union with Bosnia , and U.N. and European mediators are pushing a peace plan that the alliance has doubts about . Additionally , Croatian nationalists appear to be merely tolerating the pact as a means of avoiding threatened sanctions . Croatian media continue to refer to Bosnian Croat separatists by titles that were abolished by an agreement to create a federation between Bosnian Muslims and Croats . And nationalist supporters of discredited rebel leader Mate Boban remain in their posts , still referring to him as their president and to their proclaimed Republic of Herzeg-Bosna . Rebel patrons in the Croatian leadership here have kept alive the supply_lines to the nationalists headquartered in Mostar and continue to coordinate military and political strategy with the supposedly ousted leaders of the rogue Bosnian Croat state . Bosnian Croat forces , known as the HVO , had been suffering tremendous battlefield losses in the fighting with Muslims before the federation deal was pressed_on Zagreb and its proxies in Bosnia . The yearlong war waged by Croatian nationalists to secure a Croatian ministate in Bosnia resulted in at least 10 # 000 deaths and the displacement of as_many as 300 # 000 Croats . U.S. diplomats convinced Tudjman that his country faced devastating economic sanctions unless it stopped backing Bosnian Croat separatism . They also promised reconstruction aid and investment as an inducement if Croats mended fences with Bosnian Muslims . A truce was proclaimed in late February , and an agreement creating a Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia was signed March 1 . The rapprochement has allowed the civilian populations to restore some sense of normalcy in most areas the two groups share . But Croatian politicians and military_leaders regard the federation accord as either a steppingstone to a confederation with Bosnia that would be dominated by Zagreb or a temporary maneuver to deflect the threat of sanctions . When Tudjman paid his long-delayed visit to Sarajevo on Tuesday , he professed commitment to the new union and inaugurated a Croatian Embassy in the Bosnian capital . But once back on home turf , he pandered to the skeptical right_wing by casting the visit as more gesture than genuine allegiance . &quot; This federation agreement was signed under pressure , &quot; said Croatian parliamentary leader Josip Manolic , who recently broke_with Tudjman ' s ruling Croatian Democratic Union , the HDZ , in protest of its Bosnian policy . &quot; Some people still want to see the Washington agreement put into force , but a large segment of those in the HDZ are the ones who promoted the war option with the Muslims in the first place and they are undermining the agreement , &quot; Manolic warned . A joint Muslim-Croatian army has been proclaimed by the new federal leaders of Bosnia , but there has been little if any evidence so far of cooperation on the ground . Bosnia ' s Muslim-led government army has fanned_out across a broad and strategic arc in the northeast of the republic . The troops are reported to be preparing_for a series of offensives aimed at wearing_down the already demoralized Serbian rebels , who have a huge advantage in heavy_weapons but too few soldiers to hold the territory they have conquered . The HVO has lately allowed the government unhindered passage through areas it commands in central Bosnia , and the halt in Croatian-Muslim fighting has freed troops for the move against the Serbs . But political and military observers here note that the HVO units in the nationalist heartland of Herzegovina have not lifted a finger to help their reputed allies wage the campaign for liberation . On the contrary , they have sought to undermine the government offensive by stirring_up fears among Bosnian Croats that their communities would be at risk of Serbian reprisals if they back Muslims . A mosque was blown_up in the tense town of Vitez late last month , and U.N. troops have reported renewed fighting in one of the deadliest flash_points of the Muslim-Croatian war , Gornji Vakuf . When the new joint defense force mobilized troops for the northeastern campaign , Herzegovina forces under the command of Croatian hard-liner Gen . Ivan Andabak refused to join on the pretext of needing to defend the shattered Neretva River valley from a Serbian attack that never came , according to a Croatian journalist with close ties to the army . Croatian military_leaders decline to discuss their policy toward Bosnia with Western journalists , but their reluctance to give_up on the idea of expanding Croatia is obvious in statements carried by state-run media . Defense Minister Gojko Susak , a Herzegovina native who directed Croatia ' s disastrous drive to conquer territory in Bosnia , told state-run television recently that the Washington accord was just an &quot; interim solution. &quot; Bosnian Croats would never be a minority , he insisted , because Bosnia was destined to be part of a confederation that Croatia would dominate . Susak and other hard-liners appear to be banking on eventual fulfillment of a secret deal to divide Bosnia that was made by Tudjman and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in 1991 . &quot; Tudjman still believes_in a fair_deal with Milosevic , &quot; said Slaven Letica , a political_science professor at Zagreb University and a former senior adviser to the president . &quot; He ' s not stupid , or mentally disadvantaged . . . . It ' s this phenomenon of dictators . They are seen as having all_the power and being the force to contend with . The problem with Milosevic is he is becoming a self-sustaining politician. &quot; The Washington agreement creating the Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia reaffirmed that national borders should not be changed by force and held_out the prospect of Bosnian Serb areas being induced to join , effectively preserving the territorial integrity of Bosnia . But observers warn that subsequent moves by U.S. and other mediators trying to bring peace to Bosnia threaten to abolish that principle by legitimizing the Serbian rebel land grab . Diplomats from the United States , Russia and the European Union are pressing the federation to accept an ethnic division that would give the Muslim-Croatian federation sovereignty over 51 % of Bosnian territory , with the rest being deeded to Serbs who want their own state . The current focus of international mediators on forging a peace_treaty dealing solely with Bosnia risks fracturing the tenuous alliance by leaving it too small and economically inviable . And the division that proposes to give the Serbs control over most of western Bosnia and a corridor to Serbia along the Sava River complicates the chances for a negotiated settlement of the frozen war between Serbs and Croats in this country . Much of the Bosnian land that would be given to the Serbs under the 49-51 formula abuts Serb-occupied territory in Croatia ' s Krajina region . Western capitulation to a separate Bosnian Serb state and securing of the supply_route for Serbian insurgents who conquered one-third of Croatia in 1991 could encourage the rebels in this country to hold_out for international acceptance of_their_own proclaimed independence . The prospect for a protracted standoff between Krajina rebels and the Croatian government is again strengthening the hand of extremists who have long warned that the outside world cannot be counted_on to broker a just solution . Moderates in the Croatian leadership , such_as Foreign Minister Mate Granic , are viewed_as sincere supporters of the Muslim-Croatian alliance . Indeed , Granic was one of the main forces behind the pact and reiterated his backing during a European Union business forum in Switzerland on Saturday when he and Bosnian government officials assured mediators the federation would not block the major_powers ' formula for a settlement . But the moderate face Croatia presents at international gatherings often contradicts the harder line followed in domestic politics , where ardent nationalists like Susak appear to have more influence with Tudjman . The international community needs to tackle instability in the Balkans in a comprehensive manner , because the settlement of one aspect of the conflict risks igniting or worsening another , warned Branko Horvat of the opposition Croatian Social Democratic Union . Splitting Bosnian territory between the Serbian rebels and the Muslim-Croat federation abandons a key principle of Western democracy -- that borders should not be changed by force . It also undermines the prospects for reuniting Croatia and leaves the Bosnian allies feeling duped by the federation deal , Horvat said . &quot; This is a classic example of how good moves by the international community are eventually neutralized by bad ones , &quot; he said , referring to the federation agreement that is slowly losing what support it had in Croatia .</TEXT>
