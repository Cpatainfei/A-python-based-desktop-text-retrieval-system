   <HEADLINE> TECHNO-TOPIA ; METHODS ANCIENT AND MODERN CREATED THE VISIONARY COMMUNE OF GAVIOTAS , WHICH COULD BE A MODEL FOR THE WORLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On first reflection , Colombia doesn ' t seem the most likely place on Earth to seek utopia . Instead of weather systems , the map in a Bogota newspaper displays current outbreaks of guerrilla activity -- 19 in all -- scattered like storm cells throughout the land . Apparently , only four of them lie_in the direction I ' m heading : los llanos , the vast plains that begin near Colombia ' s geographic center and spread nearly 600 miles to the Orinoco_River on its eastern border . But even though the llanos constitute almost half the country , fewer than one-tenth of the population lives there , mostly so isolated from telephones or electricity that little of what goes_on here is actually reported . What separates the llanos from the rest of Colombia are the Andes . The craggy easternmost Andean cordillera looms so massively over Bogota that few here ever consider that the Orinoco ' s enormous flood plain begins only a_few kilometers away . Yet that neglected expanse , Paolo Lugari insists as we stroll through the vehicular paralysis of downtown Bogota , is crucial both to his country and to a world filling quickly with unprecedented numbers of people . Although this is just four degrees above the Equator , Bogota ' s elevation is nearly 9 # 000 feet , and everyone except Lugari is wearing woolens . Tieless , in a lightweight suit , he is a tall , strapping man in his early 50s with a graying beard , who orates in a booming basso over the wail of internal_combustion engines . &quot; Millions of years ago , &quot; he declares , &quot; a group of African primates were running_out of resources in the forest , so they ventured into the savannas . To defend themselves , they had to learn to stand upright in_order to see predators. &quot; The place where Homo_sapiens emerged , Lugari says , was practically identical to the Orinocan llanos . &quot; Today , the savannas of the tropics are the only big open spaces left . We have to learn to live_in them again. &quot; It was just such a setting , exactly halfway between the Andes and the Orinoco , that Paolo Lugari chose for Gaviotas , the community he founded 23 years ago -- a community that simultaneously harks back to the land and forward to the future . Despite its dubious location , many admirers in and beyond Colombia consider Gaviotas , with its ingenious strategies for tapping sun , water , wind and soil , a strong candidate for utopia status . Lugari appreciates their sentiment , but argues with the term . &quot; Not utopia , &quot; he says . &quot; Topia. &quot; I don ' t recognize the word , either in Spanish or English . &quot; I invented it . In Greek , the prefix ' u ' signifies ' no. ' Utopia literally means ' no place. ' Fantasy land . But Gaviotas is real . We ' ve gone from fantasy to reality . From utopia to topia. &quot; Not just any reality : The hydrocarbon haze , bleating automobiles and architectural anarchy surrounding us aren ' t Lugari ' s idea of acceptable existence . Paolo Lugari is convinced that humans can do far better , but he harbors no nostalgic , pastoral illusions . The future he envisions will achieve harmony through -- not despite technology . Although Gaviotas remains intentionally small -- its population has fluctuated between 200 to 500 over the years -- its accomplishments have attracted both a designation by the United Nations as a model to the Third_World and an urban market for its technological resourcefulness . I ' ve already sampled one taste of topia . The Bogota condominium complex in which I ' m staying has water heated by solar collectors developed at Gaviotas . Solar energy isn ' t new , but it usually requires the sun . Here , although it ' s rained all week , I ' ve had hot showers every day . In fact , chilly Bogota is overcast about seven months a year , yet the Gaviotas solar_system works so well that a_few blocks away , in Colombia ' s executive palace , it also warms President Ernesto Samper ' s daily bath . The world ' s largest solar-water-heated public housing_development -- 7 # 500 units -- on the edge of town , as well as the next two runners-up , in Bogota and Medellin respectively , are also Gaviotas projects . The explanation is neither magical nor very expensive , Lugari tells me : Coating the rooftop panels with a reflective film helps them absorb diffused as well as direct light . At Clinica San Pedro Claver , one of the nation ' s biggest hospitals , they ' re installing not just heaters but solar water boilers , coaxing from Bogota ' s meager sunshine temperatures sufficiently scalding to sterilize instruments round the clock . A considerable amount of energy , pollutants and money are being saved in this cloudy city , and I wonder aloud why this isn ' t done on a much greater scale in my allegedly technically superior country . Good question , Lugari says . And , he reminds me , what I see in Bogota is one small part of what Gaviotas has accomplished in the impoverished llanos . &quot; Remember , the United States now has a lot more poor people than Colombia . You might need a Gaviotas more_than you think. &quot; IT WAS 1964 WHEN PAOLO Lugari first crossed the Andes and saw the bleached grassland of Orinoquia , spider-webbed with languid rivers , nearly the size of Wisconsin . He ' d been invited by his uncle , then Colombia ' s minister of public works , on a inspection flight of nearly nothing . About the only project the government had ever undertaken in the llanos had begun 10 years earlier , when a previous administration briefly attempted to scrape a highway across the huge prairie . At that time , the idea was to open the eastern portion of the country to refugees fleeing the bedlam under way in the western half . Nearly 200 # 000 people died in what is now recalled simply as &quot; La Violencia , &quot; a decade of civil mayhem waged between Colombia ' s two major political_parties , whose platforms barely differed . Many survivors , driven from their farms in the rich coffee highlands , wandered into the llanos . They didn ' t find much . Unlike the fertile Andean slopes , filled with wildflowers and coffee blossoms , nearly nothing grew in the sunbaked llanos except a_few low-nutrient grasses and a squat tree called the chaparro . The palm groves lining the rivers seethed with malaria-bearing mosquitoes . During the nearly nine-month rainy_season , any place the sod was broken turned_to butterscotch-colored muck . But young Lugari was mesmerized by this immense savanna that from the window of the DC-3 became wonderfully confused with the horizon . It was the most beautiful landscape he had ever seen , and he started having visions . Today , the overland trip from Bogota to Gaviotas takes 16 hours by jeep , depending_on the number of army or guerrilla roadblocks encountered . I don ' t mind these so_much : The car and body searches are a relief from the sensational pounding of the rutted track that is the highway that never was . And the dust : This is the dry_season -- the road is mostly impassable the rest of the year -- and I am so coated with powdered clay that one sergeant doubts whether my passport picture is really me . Fortunately , he also doesn ' t recognize my companion , Bogota journalist Constanza Vieira , whom I first met when she worked for the now-defunct Soviet news_agency Novosti . Constanza ' s father was the former head of Colombia ' s Communist_Party and a founder of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias Colombianas , FARC , the country ' s biggest guerrilla army . In 1985 , many guerrillas and sympathizers accepted an offer of amnesty to form a legitimate party . Since then , right-wing paramilitaries have assassinated more_than 1 # 000 of their candidates , including several of Constanza ' s friends . Frequently , these private armies are financed by drug barons , whose sprawling ranches we cross for hours en route to Gaviotas . I ' m traveling there to see sustainable technology created by and for the Third_World ; for Constanza , the compelling interest is that Gaviotas is considered an island of hope amid Colombia ' s ongoing tragedy . We suspect there ' s a connection . The first time Lugari made this drive , he reached an abandoned road_construction camp in two days . All that remained was a shed filled with weeds . Lugari staked a claim to 25 # 000 surrounding acres , including the camp , which was named Gaviotas -- sea_gulls -- for the yellow-billed terns that fish along Orinocan tributaries so flat they barely seem to flow . One of these wound through his new property . Soon afterward , Lugari appeared in the office of Jorge Zapp , then head of the mechanical_engineering department of Bogota ' s Universidad de Los Andes . &quot; True or false , &quot; he demanded . &quot; Can you build a turbine efficient enough to generate electricity from a stream with just a one-meter drop ? &quot; Zapp thought a moment . &quot; True , &quot; he replied . &quot; Why ? &quot; Jorge Zapp knew about Lugari from the newspapers : the enfant_terrible son of a brilliant Italian lawyer , engineer and geographer who ' d found Colombia ' s tropics so irresistible he married into a prominent family here and stayed . Educated mainly at_home by his father , Lugari passed his university exams without attending classes . On the strength of an inspired interview , he won a U.N. scholarship to study development in the Far East . Upon returning from the Philippines , he launched a highly publicized , successful national campaign to save a historic village near Bogota from being drowned by a federal hydroelectric project . &quot; Come to Gaviotas and I ' ll show you , &quot; Lugari told Zapp . &quot; Tomorrow. &quot; Next , he visited Prof . Sven Zethelius at the National University ' s agricultural chemistry_department . Zethelius informed him that soils around Gaviotas were only about 2 centimeters thick and high in aluminum toxicity -- basically , the worst in Colombia . A desert . &quot; Think_of them as different soils , &quot; Lugari urged . &quot; The only deserts are those of the imagination . If we can solve how to exist in the most resource-starved region in the country , we can live anywhere. &quot; With the world ' s population set to double within half a century , people soon would have to live_on land previously considered unlivable , Lugari explained to the scientists , agronomists , engineers and doctors he recruited for his team . Here , they had three choices : burn_down the Colombian Amazon ; do the same to El Choco on Colombia ' s western coast ( the world ' s largest intact rain_forest ) ; or move to the llanos . Gaviotas was a chance to plan their own tropical civilization from the ground up , instead of depending_on models and technology developed for northern climates . &quot; When we import solutions from the United States or Europe , &quot; Lugari argued , &quot; we also import their problems . In Colombia , we ' ve got enough as is. &quot; Fifteen hours into our drive , bright aluminum sunflowers appear across the landscape , our first glimpse of what Zapp , Zethelius , their colleagues and graduate_students have created here . Although this tropical plain floats atop a vast subterranean lake , destitute Indians and early settlers had to haul water from muddy , mosquito- and piranha-infested streams . Zapp ' s mechanical_engineers studied 58 different types of windmills before creating a custom model to pump the llanos . The result was a compact unit weighing barely 100 pounds , its blade tips contoured like airplane wings to trap soft equatorial breezes . Over the years , Gaviotas technicians have installed thousands of these across Colombia -- in some places , gaviota is the local word for windmill . Since Gaviotas refuses to patent inventions , preferring to share them freely , the design has also been copied from Central_America to Chile . There is something serene and lovely about seeing them whirling in the meadows , especially after miles of electrified fences bordering the haciendas of narcotraficantes . But now we ' re in Colombia ' s far-flung Vichada province , whose motto reads &quot; Land without people for people without land. &quot; Suddenly , the temperature plummets 20 degrees and nearly horizontal rain collides with the windshield . Instantly , the road liquefies . We slither on in four-wheel drive , negotiating potholes that are now ponds , aiming for an incongruous sight on the horizon . It is the unmistakable , fuzzy silhouette of a pine forest , bursting from these bare llanos , the result of years of experiments directed by Zethelius to determine what might flourish here . Earlier , Lugari had claimed that he planted more trees last year than the entire Colombian forestry department . I now see he wasn ' t kidding . When we finally slog into a compound of neat white cottages with laminated roofs , shaded by mango_trees and bougainvillea , the sky is clearing . Gonzalo Bernal , for years school director and now administrator of Gaviotas , greets us with the news that more precipitation fell in the previous hour than Israel gets_in a year . &quot; The rainy_season ' s beginning . You may never leave. &quot; &quot; Who wants to ? &quot; says Constanza , gazing around happily . The fresh air is gardenia-scented ; yellow_warblers and dazzling crimson tanagers sing in the mango_trees . From the main_office ' s tiled porch , Bernal , a slim man in khaki shorts and a T-shirt with a sea_gull logo , indicates guest houses , refectory , commissary , school and bachelor quarters . Across a soccer field , horses graze in front of a meeting hall with a radically vaulted roof . Its aerodynamic appearance is echoed by clusters of brightly painted , airy family dwellings , whose pitched roofs , studded with solar_panels , consist_of two triangular wings joined at their longest edges , rising to a crest that dips to resemble a beak . &quot; They ' re gaviotas , &quot; Bernal acknowledges proudly . A dinner_bell interrupts the evening birdsong . Gonzalo shows us how the ceilings in our rooms slide back to let_in starlight , explains how to operate Gaviotas ' water-saving faucets and leaves us to grab solar showers . Although families have their own kitchens , Gaviotans mostly eat en commune . In the open-air dining_room , a hundred-plus men , women and children gather at long tables for a cafeteria-style meal of lentil_soup , salad , rice , meat-and-potato stew , cassava and papaya_juice . We join Bernal , his therapist wife Cecilia Parodi and Carlos Sanchez , who runs the hydroponic farm . Vegetables , beef , pork and fish are produced here , Sanchez adds ; other foods , like grains and poultry , have been raised experimentally but still are cheaper to purchase . No one feels discouraged by the fact that Gaviotas hasn ' t yet achieved total food self-sufficiency , or that when the brook flowing through Zapp ' s mini-turbine becomes a trickle in the short dry_season , they still resort_to a diesel generator . Because everyone receives a salary , they must manufacture and market their windmills , pumps and solar inventions , an enterprise that keeps Lugari in Bogota much of the year . &quot; But in 23 years , we ' ve learned to cover 70 % of our needs , &quot; Bernal says . &quot; The trees we plant more_than compensate for any greenhouse gases we emit . Imagine the difference if the rest of the world lived like us. &quot; Lying under equatorial stars that night after a concert of musica llanera performed on guitar , harp and four-stringed cuatro by Gaviotas virtuosos , I try to imagine the rest of the world living like them . This began as a collection of researchers , students and laborers sharing communal vehicles , bedding , dishes , clothes -- and decisions . In time , several of their families joined them and a permanent colony with individual houses emerged , but government was by consensus rather than written rules . The unwritten ones have been few and simple . To limit public disorder , alcohol is confined to homes . To preserve wildlife , dogs and guns are banished . After distinguished weekend visitors began arriving , like Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the president of Spain , Sundays and Wednesdays were switched so guests could see Gaviotas at_work . A need for police , jail or door locks has never arisen . Anyone who violates protocol , like a storekeeper who recently admitted overcharging to finance his honeymoon , is effectively ostracized by the community until his debt is repaid . Loafers aren ' t tolerated , but with pay that starts above the Colombian minimum_wage , plus free meals , medical_care , school and housing , this isn ' t a problem . In 23 years , no murders nor rapes . &quot; Not even crimes of passion ? &quot; I ask Cecilia Parodi . &quot; Surely there ' s adultery. &quot; &quot; It ' s hard to have adultery when there ' s no marriage. &quot; &quot; No marriage ? &quot; She shrugs . &quot; Gonzalo and I were already married when we came . But there doesn ' t seem to be any need for it here . Most people live_in free union . Partners sometimes change , but it seems to work . All these kids have pretty nice homes. &quot; It ' s 7:30 a.m. ; we ' re at the preschool , watching children romp on a seesaw attached_to a double-action pump . As they rise and descend , water gushes from a vertical pipe into an adjacent cement tank . Gaviotas has also installed these in villages across the country . &quot; There are no churches , either , &quot; Cecilia continues . She watches as a family of titi_monkeys swings into the foliage overhead , releasing a cloud of squawking parrots . &quot; We see God in the birds , the animals , in the trees . The kids are taught to respect nature and love humanity . that ' s the basis of any faith. &quot; It ' s true : Beyond crosses in the small cemetery , we ' ve seen no sign of religion . Missionaries and evangelicals who appear are welcome , Cecilia explains , but they usually don ' t stay long . &quot; After a while , the priest gives_up and leaves . Same thing with political candidates. &quot; I am impressed by any society so evolved it ignores politics , but Constanza Vieira , who has seen colleagues massacred over ideology , is practically in tears that such a place exists . She can ' t fathom how Gaviotas has resisted the surrounding maelstroms . This is guerrilla territory , and pickups filled with paramilitary vigilantes packing assault weapons prowl the savanna roads . &quot; We just stay neutral , &quot; says Gonzalo . &quot; But how can you ? &quot; Constanza insists . &quot; Maybe I can show you . Later. &quot; First , we take a techno-tour of the llanos to see how Gaviotas has revolutionized life here . By a pool where tiny alligators sun themselves on rocks , a neighbor shows us a water ram , a small , upright cylinder containing a pressure valve that harnesses a river ' s current to irrigate a field a kilometer away . &quot; The technology is 200 years old , &quot; Bernal tells us . &quot; We updated it with modern materials. &quot; But their most significant invention is nearly as ubiquitous here as their windmills . It is a simple hand_pump capable of tapping aquifers six times deeper than conventional models but requiring so little effort that children can operate it . In normal pumps , a heavy piston must be raised and lowered inside a pipe . Gaviotas engineers realized they could do the reverse : leave the piston stationary and lift an outer sleeve of lightweight , inexpensive PVC tubing instead . &quot; For our first 10 years , we had to carry buckets from the river , &quot; says Julieta Martinez , one of the many neighboring ranchers who has incorporated Gaviotas technology , as she pumps clear water from a 100-foot well using just her little_finger . Her children , she tells us , were born in the Gaviotas hospital and educated in its boarding school . &quot; Gaviotas changed everything. &quot; At Gaviotas itself , Omar Marin , who ' s tended livestock here for 18 years , leads us to a windmill-fed cattle trough , surrounded by a sloping cement floor , where his cowboys have just brought several thirsty calves . &quot; Miren la caca , &quot; he says . We do what he suggests and observe that as the bovines drink , their dung slides_down the slope into a gutter , which sluices it to an enclosed vat . Inside , anaerobic fermentation turns this cow-pie slurry into compost and methane . The methane flows through pipes to an extraordinary building set_on a rise . It is , Bernal tells us , the reason Gaviotas has been able to avoid taking sides in Colombia ' s chronic internecine wars . A Japanese architectural journal has named this , the 16-bed Gaviotas hospital , one of the 40 most important buildings in the world . It was conceived by Gaviotas engineers , doctors , nurses , patients and an architect , Esperanza Caro , whom we don ' t meet because she is currently designing Tokyo ' s new Wind Park . It is at once futuristic and ancient , a maze of angles formed by white walls , glass awnings , skylights , brushed steel columns and exposed supports trimmed in blue and yellow enamel . Like Egyptian pyramids , the interior is cooled with underground ducts whose hillside intakes face the prevailing northern breeze . Opposing layers of corrugated roofing create a series of air channels that further bleed away the llano s heat . The combined effect is cost-free , maintenance-free air conditioning . Solar collectors attached_to gleaming rooftop tanks alternately heat , boil and distill water . A solar clothes-dryer freshens the hospital linens . Electricity is from solar photovoltaic_cells , Gaviotas ' only foreign technological import , still too expensive to produce here . These cells also run a pump that sends oil , solar-heated to 320 degrees Fahrenheit , through a closed system to the kitchen , where it circulates around sunken stainless-steel pressure_cookers . The stove-top burners are fueled with home-grown methane . This is the only hospital within a 12-hour radius . Patients arrive from across the llanos on horseback , bicycle or on foot , often leading a cow or hog to pay_for medical_care . At times , when guerrilla and army forces have clashed nearby and the Gaviotas airstrip was filled with helicopters , both sides have brought their wounded . Sven Zethelius ' son Magnus , a doctor here from 1976 to 1981 , once discovered that he had placed an army corporal and a FARC guerrilla in the same room . Hours earlier they had been trying to kill each other ; now the one who could walk was bringing the other water . &quot; The rule here is never to ask , &quot; Gonzalo tells Constanza . &quot; Like the Red_Cross . Everybody respects us. &quot; That respect allowed Zethelius and doctors who followed him to venture unprotected into the llanos , paddling dugout_canoes filled with medicine to communities of formerly nomadic Guahivo Indians . The Guahivo , now boxed_in by settlers ' fences , suffer from malaria , tuberculosis and gastroenteritis . Yet they would n ' t enter a hospital : To wall off someone away from his family was , to them , the ultimate unhealthy confinement . Today , a short , vine-covered walkway connects the Gaviotas hospital to the maloka , a separate wing built by the Guahivo themselves . Instead of beds , patients and their families lie_in hammocks hung from wooden beams under a great thatch ramada . Relatives of the sick earn their keep by tending tomatoes , lettuce , cabbage and onions in an adjacent hydroponic greenhouse . If Paolo Lugari , the National University ' s pharmacology department and Guahivo shamans have their way , this greenhouse will also one day become the finest medicinal plant laboratory in the tropics . But money is a critical factor and Colombia ' s expanding government-owned oil and gas industry has dampened solar-collector sales recently by effectively blocking any tax_benefits for investing in alternative_energy . At the same time , revenue from windmills and pumps dropped as Colombian agriculture was battered by an unexpected onslaught of cheap imported foods , the unanticipated fallout of new free-market policies . Before the 1990s , Colombia ' s government was outfitting the president ' s mansion with solar_panels , issuing commemorative stamps honoring Gaviotas ' achievements and providing funds to the U.N. Development Program , which in turn supported the proliferation of Gaviotas ' technology in villages across the country . Today , a new law prohibiting government grants to nonprofit organizations has not only eliminated federal aid for the Gaviotas school and hospital , but killed funding for matching U.N. support as well . &quot; How can the U.N. allow that ? &quot; I ' d asked Lugari back in Bogota . &quot; Their pamphlets extol Gaviotas as a model to the developing world. &quot; &quot; They ' re broke , too . Besides , we ' re not a model , we ' re a path . When it turns , we have to follow . Anyhow , adaptation stimulates invention. &quot; This is why , he told me , they have decided to downscale their manufacturing . But no one is getting laid_off . &quot; Gaviotas isn ' t a company . We ' re a community . In fact , the solution means that both employment and Gaviotas will grow. &quot; That solution is growing on nearly 20 # 000 forested acres . After no indigenous tree proved suitable for cultivation on the prairie , Gaviotas researchers imported Caribbean pines , found throughout Central_America . In the thin llanos soils , they proved to be veritable sun-and-water-processing machines , growing , as Sven Zethelius marveled , &quot; five times faster than any pine_tree in Sweden. &quot; In the last 12 years , Gaviotas has planted 1.6 million of them . To the surprise of foresters , however , the Gaviotans chose not to cut their standing timber . Instead , Gaviotas is converting the windmill factory to process pine resin extracted from the sap of living trees , not unlike how maple_syrup is produced . Until now , Colombia has spent $ 4 million annually to import such resins for manufacturing paint , turpentine and paper . Armed with that fact , Lugari persuaded the Japanese government to provide the seed money , via a grant through the Interamerican Development Bank , to begin tapping and processing resin for the domestic market . On our final evening , the Gaviotas community assembles for a workshop by government forestry technicians , who arrived earlier in a chartered plane . Paolo Lugari was to have come as well , but he ' s back in the city , preparing to receive the president of Guyana and prime_minister of Jamaica , who want to begin a Caribbean Gaviotas . We settle back to watch a video about building firebreaks . Afterward , the community elects to let the generator run past 9 , when lights usually go_out . No TV reaches here , and one of the foresters has brought a tape of the previous night ' s World Cup tune-up match between Colombia and Mexico . For this occasion , the alcohol rule is relaxed . Bottles of beer and Coca-Cola are opened , and bets are taken . Anyone who might know the outcome is honor-bound not to wager . Constanza and I slip_away to Gonzalo ' s house . Joined by his neighbor , school director Teresa Valencia , we lie on patio hammocks , listening to crickets and the muted clucking of toucans , and meditate on the future of this tropical topia . A recent agreement with the Universidad del Los Andes will bring a new generation of engineers here , to add_to the hundreds of doctoral theses that have already emerged from Gaviotas . What they ' ll invent to meet the coming challenges is anyone ' s guess , but they ' ll have plenty of advisers : Zethelius , now in his 70s , wants to inaugurate a colony for retired professors here , starting with himself . And Bernal confirms that Lugari has dreamed_up a new project : Gaviotas is going_to build a dirigible . &quot; It ' s a perfect , cheap way to ship our products across the llanos , &quot; Paolo had told me earlier . &quot; You ' re going to build it yourselves ? &quot; &quot; Sure . With imagination and perspiration , we can do anything . that ' s how utopian miracles become topian truths. &quot; The power shuts down . As Constanza and I feel our way through the peaceful darkness of Gaviotas , we are surrounded by a little miracle that seems to justify such optimism . When environmentalists initially questioned the wisdom of introducing a monoculture of an exotic tree , Pinus caribaea hondurensis , into the llanos , Lugari countered that since nothing else grew there , Gaviotas was displacing no native species . In fact , quite the contrary . &quot; You need to see for yourselves what ' s happened. &quot; By the light of the rising moon , we can see it . In the moist understory of the Gaviotas pine forest , dormant seeds of native trees probably not seen in the llanos for millennia have sprouted . So far , biologists have counted nearly 40 species . Sheltered by pine_trees , a diverse , indigenous tropical forest is regenerating here with surprising speed , and Gaviotas intends , over decades , to let it choke out Pinus caribaea and return the llanos to what many ecologists believe was their primeval state : an extension of the Amazon . Already , the population of deer , anteaters and capybaras is growing . As this natural_process continues , Gaviotas will keep planting more trees . They ' ve already given_away thousands of seedlings from their nursery to neighbors , and groves of young pines are thriving all_over the llanos . &quot; Elsewhere they ' re tearing_down the rain_forest , &quot; Paolo Lugari says . &quot; In los llanos , we ' re putting it back . If we can create a topia in Colombia , there ' s hope that humans can do_it anywhere. &quot;</TEXT>
