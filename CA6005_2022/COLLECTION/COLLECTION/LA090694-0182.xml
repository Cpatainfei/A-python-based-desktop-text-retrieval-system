   <HEADLINE> O.C. ART ; WIT , KEEN OBSERVATION ENDURE IN KATE STEINITZ WORKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First Beatrice Wood , then Francoise Gilot , now Kate T . Steinitz -- the Severin Wunderman Museum in Irvine has been devoting a generous portion of its exhibition schedule to women artists who moved_in heady cultural circles . Centenarian Wood has been much celebrated in the media and Gilot was immortalized in paint by her lover , Pablo Picasso . But Steinitz -- who collaborated with Dada artist Kurt Schwitters and became a noted Leonardo da Vinci scholar in her old_age -- is hardly well known . Her retrospective ( through Oct . 28 ) reveals an artist steeped in several styles , with a humorous outlook and a predilection for small-scale , throwaway works . Her position in the history of modern art was modest -- she was no innovator , after all -- but her gentle wit and keen observation remain appealing . Born Kate Traumann in 1889 in Beuthen , Germany ( now part of Poland ) , Steinitz was exposed early on to Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting by her upper middle-class parents . In 1902 , the family moved to Berlin , a major art center . Among her teachers at the various local academies were the Expressionist graphic_artist Kathe Kollwitz and proto-Expressionist landscape painter Lovis Corinth . Although she married young -- in 1913 , to a doctor -- her husband encouraged her work and her associations with local artists . Works from Steinitz ' s early 20s show diverse influences and media explorations , from the folkloric appearance of a lithograph ( &quot; Cowshed &quot; ) to an Edvard Munch-style charged landscape surrounding isolated figures in a painting on glass ( &quot; Children on the Beach ) . &quot; * The Wunderman ' s research_director , William Emboden , a longtime acquaintance of Steinitz , rightly points_out in the exhibit catalogue that Steinitz tended to make use of formal aspects of Post-Impressionism while avoiding its metaphysical content . For example , in her painting &quot; Four Boys &quot; from 1919 , she used the intense colors and primitivist deformities associated with the &quot; Blaue Reiter &quot; ( Blue Rider ) group but without invoking their mystic view of the universe . There is something a bit too sweet and domesticated about the central figures , one of whom plays a violin . They seem more like real little boys , seen_through a haze of maternal emotion , than archetypal images . When her husband ' s burgeoning career brought the couple to Hanover , Steinitz became a fixture of the local art world . The city hummed with the activities of the rambunctious Dada movement which defiantly opposed cliched art of the past . As co-organizer of one of the art colony ' s big social_events , Steinitz whipped_up a last-minute costume that included a blouse run_through a printing_press : an ambulatory typographical design . In Hanover , Steinitz collaborated with Schwitters on several projects , including children ' s books . As can be seen in sample pages of &quot; Hahnepeter &quot; ( Peter the Rooster ) , Schwitters cut_up her perky drawings and sprinkled them through the typographically lively text he designed . ( Years later , Steinitz would see Schwitters ' &quot; junk &quot; aesthetic at_work in Sam Rodia ' s Watts Towers in Los Angeles , which she helped save from destruction by civic authorities. ) A passion for the performing arts prompted Steinitz ' s unconvincing sketches of ballerina Anna Pavlova and images of modern_dance pioneer Harald Kreutzberg and his company , whose angular style of movement better suited Steinitz ' s Expressionistic style . Other subjects caught by her lightly caricaturing brush and pencil included cabaret singers , a famous clown and street musicians . After joining her family in New York in 1936 to escape Nazi persecution , Steinitz continued to find congenial entertainment-world subjects when she wasn ' t pursuing the free-lance commercial_art work and research assignments that augmented her husband ' s modest U.S. medical_practice . At Coney_Island amusement_park , she observed the collision of bland amusement and terror in a fun house ride ( grinning faces in &quot; Rip_Van_Winkle &quot; spit_out tiny , clinging , faintly drawn couples ) . In Harlem , still in its jazz age heyday , she seemed as intrigued by enthralled patrons as by the stage show ( &quot; Two Women in Harlem &quot; ) . In contrast to the vibrant sphere of human relations , landscape frequently seemed a source of starkness and despair in Steinitz ' s art . A pair of gnarled , bare trees contorted like an Expressionist modern dancer in &quot; New York in Winter &quot; conspire to render the scene desolate ; ramshackle beach shacks even lend &quot; Venice Beach , California &quot; a moody note . Los Angeles proved a congenial setting for Steinitz in her 50s , however . Widowed and mourning her youngest daughter , who had died of pneumonia , she initially moved to San Francisco in 1942 . Through Schwitters -- exiled to Norway after his work had been shown in the Nazi ' s notorious &quot; Degenerate Art &quot; exhibitions -- she met a physician who not only diagnosed her persistent kidney condition but owned an impressive library of Leonardo ' s writings . Once again her artistic &quot; godfather &quot; had guided her toward a new career , this time as a respected scholar specializing in the great Renaissance artist and inventor . Working in Los Angeles as Dr. Elmer Belt ' s personal librarian , Steinitz led a richly involved life , running an informal salon for European artists and scholars who had fled the Third_Reich . Her final years ( she died in 1965 ) also were devoted to championing new American art and producing an array of drawings , collages and small Dada-like &quot; unusable &quot; objects covered in old engravings , which were intended as private communiques and gifts for friends . A couple of her collages incorporate an archly self-conscious blend of Dada and Pop Art that makes one wonder how she would have reacted to Conceptualism , still on the artistic horizon . * It seems fitting that this show is at the Wunderman museum , a repository for the work of Jean Cocteau and his circle -- not only because the two artists , born in the same year , were acquaintances but also because Steinitz shared something of Cocteau ' s synthetic approach to visual art . Both rummaged around the grab bag of contemporary styles to find idioms into which they could slot their talents for sharp , quick observations of the passing scene . * &quot; Kate T . Steinitz : Art Into Life Into Art &quot; continues through Oct . 28 at the Severin Wunderman Museum , 3 Mason , Irvine . 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays through Fridays . Free . ( 714 ) 472-1138 .</TEXT>
