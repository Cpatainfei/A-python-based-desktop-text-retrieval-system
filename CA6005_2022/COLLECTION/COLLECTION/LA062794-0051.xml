   <TEXT> Were those naked Germans in the water_fountain ? Almost . After a recent game in Chicago , an American fan reported seeing many male German soccer fans , stripped to their underwear , splashing about in the Buckingham Fountain . Another group of Germans took pictures . The Chicago Tribune broke the story in its Sunday editions . Apparently , the fountain is a big hit in Germany because it is used in the opening credits of the popular television_show &quot; Married . . . with Children. &quot; The show is popular in Germany . Chicago cops soon dispersed the Germans who , rumor has it , might have tipped a_few beer steins before their wading game . CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
