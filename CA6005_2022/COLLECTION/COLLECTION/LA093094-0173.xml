   <HEADLINE> CHANNEL 4 : TUNE IN TO THE OTHER SIDE ; TELEVISION : BY PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE VIEWING , BRITAIN ' S NEWEST OUTLET IS GOBBLING_UP AWARDS -- AND EARNS A THREE-DAY TRIBUTE AT THE UK / LA FEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So imagine this : You go_to see the guy who runs Channel 4 and after an hour ' s conversation about TV , he suddenly says : &quot; Our viewers are very discerning , you know . People don ' t sit_down and watch this channel for a whole evening . And I ' m perfectly happy with that . In fact , it ' s our greatest strength. &quot; Couldn ' t happen , right ? Not with the Channel 4 you ' re thinking of , it couldn ' t . But this Channel 4 has nothing to do with KNBC-TV , the folks over in Burbank who bring you Paul Moyer and Kelly Lange for news at 11 . This one is quite a different proposition . It is the smallest and newest of Britain ' s four TV channels , with an overall audience share of just more_than 10 % , and since its debut 12 years ago it has staked a claim as one of the world ' s most original and innovative broadcast entities . Its contributions to the world of filmmaking will be celebrated at the UK / LA Festival with screenings tonight through Sunday at the Directors Guild . Channel 4 was set_up by an act of Parliament to provide alternative viewing for non-mainstream audiences . The channel produces no shows of its own , but commissions from independent TV companies or buys from other countries . Consequently , Channel 4 ' s programming is a rich , heady , some might say bizarre mix : strong on documentaries , the arts and shows about ethnic_groups and Britain ' s gay community . Its schedule is also lightly sprinkled with what Michael Grade , 51 , Channel 4 ' s chief_executive , calls &quot; the literate , intelligent end &quot; of U.S. network fare -- skillfully written shows like &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; &quot; I ' ll Fly Away , &quot; &quot; Frasier , &quot; &quot; Northern Exposure &quot; and &quot; Roseanne. &quot; But Channel 4 may be_best known for its enthusiastic backing of theatrical movies . It has poured money into some 180 films , most of them British , since its inception , and in a typical year helps back 10 or 12 films with a total of $ 15 million- $ 20 million . In some cases , notably Stephen Frears ' 1985 hit &quot; My Beautiful Laundrette , &quot; the channel wholly finances films . Recent movies made at least partly with Channel 4 money include &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; &quot; The Crying Game , &quot; &quot; Howards End &quot; and Mike Leigh ' s &quot; High Hopes. &quot; &quot; It ' s a set-up Americans cannot comprehend , &quot; says Grade , 51 . &quot; It ' s not only our programming . They don ' t see why a broadcaster would finance theatrical films . It seems to them that ' s the competition. &quot; So why do_it ? Grade explains Channel 4 is an equity participant in films it backs , which means it shares profits from hits like &quot; Four Weddings &quot; and &quot; The Crying Game. &quot; It also holds the_British broadcasting license for those films : &quot; Our losses , when they occur , are mitigated by the fact that we can use these movies on air , &quot; he says . &quot; When we air ' The Crying Game ' on Channel 4 , it will be a huge event . And we ' ve found that we get_even bigger audience figures the second , third and fourth time we air films like &quot; Beautiful Laundrette. &quot; Last year was something of a high point in terms of Channel 4 ' s visibility within the theatrical film community . Three films backed by Channel 4 won an astonishing 16 Oscar nominations between them . &quot; The Crying Game , &quot; for which Channel 4 put_up one-third of the budget , gained six ; &quot; Howards End , &quot; backed 25 % , grabbed nine ; &quot; Damage , &quot; which received one nod , was 10 % financed . * Despite this , when Grade visits America he usually encounters people who assume Channel 4 is part of the BBC . &quot; You get used to it , &quot; he sighs . &quot; Little by little the message gets_across , but you have to keep flying the flag. &quot; This is one reason Grade is in Los Angeles this week for the tribute , which will include a question-and-answer session about the state of Britain ' s film_industry and Channel 4 ' s role in it . The tribute runs_over three days and includes films partly or wholly financed by the channel : Ken Loach ' s new movie , &quot; Ladybird , Ladybird , &quot; &quot; My Beautiful Laundrette , &quot; &quot; Shopping &quot; from first-time director Paul Anderson , and &quot; Danny Boy , &quot; an obscure 1982 film directed by Neil Jordan and starring Stephen Rea , who reunited a decade later in &quot; The Crying Game. &quot; Also in the festival is the Los Angeles premiere of &quot; Lipstick on Your Collar , &quot; the final part of the late Dennis Potter ' s trilogy of dramatic series for TV , which started with &quot; Pennies From Heaven &quot; and &quot; The Singing Detective. &quot; Like those works , &quot; Lipstick &quot; features the device of characters lip-syncing to pop hits of the era being portrayed ; in this case , it is the mid-1950s with the Suez Canal crisis looming in Britain and rock ' n ' roll threatening to overturn the values of an older generation . The tribute offers a cross-section of the challenging provocative programming which has given the channel a distinct edge among Britain ' s youngish , upscale viewers . Not included in the tribute , but also fully funded by Channel 4 ( at a cost of $ 8 million ) was last year ' s gay-themed series &quot; Tales of the City. &quot; It was shown on PBS this year , but the candor of the material made the public broadcaster shy_away_from controversy and express reluctance to air a projected second series . &quot; One thing you always believed about the States was that success is rewarded , &quot; Grade says sourly . &quot; And in anybody ' s terms &quot; Tales of the City &quot; was the biggest success PBS had had for years -- in terms of ink , critical acclaim and sheer numbers of people watching . And they ( PBS ) turned their back on it , all because allegedly it would n ' t play in Oklahoma or places like that . It ' s very depressing and sad . But that ' s the end of it , unless a sugar_daddy comes along. &quot; Still , Grade accepts that controversy is likely to follow a programming philosophy such_as Channel 4 ' s . &quot; We always try to do things differently from other people , &quot; he says . &quot; We throw the balls_up in the air and turn things upside-down. &quot; This is not idle_talk ; Channel 4 is amassing a tradition for subverting classic television genres . A Channel 4-commissioned sitcom , &quot; Drop the Dead Donkey , &quot; set_in a TV newsroom , has an extra twist ; it is literally topical . Each week ' s episode is littered with_references_to and jokes about the week ' s news . * Grade characterizes the Establishment BBC channels as &quot; very backward-looking . Not a night goes_by when there isn ' t a retrospective , an archive or anniversary show . The BBC ' s like a museum . And ITV ' s wall-to-wall entertainment . That has its place , but if you want TV that ' s topical , relevant and about the way you live , you have to watch Channel 4. &quot; After being a sportswriter for several years , Grade worked in television in Britain beginning in 1973 . In 1981 he accepted an offer to join Norman Lear as president of Embassy Television . In 1988 , he became chief_executive of upscale Channel 4 . He is generally thought to have steered it skillfully , increasing its audience share gradually while adhering to its original remit to serve minority and alternative viewing interests . Grade may have turned 50 , yet as a London critic recently remarked , he remains the nearest thing to a Wunderkind in British TV . Grade believes predictive research provides all_the wrong answers : &quot; Go and ask the public what they ' d like to see , and they ' ll say : more shows like ' Roseanne ' or ' Cheers. ' that ' s useless . &quot; Do you think Shakespeare walked up and down outside the Globe Theatre , asking the crowds what they fancied seeing next ? Television_programs are living , organic things , not commodities. &quot; * For more information and a complete schedule , call ( 213 ) 466-FILM .</TEXT>
