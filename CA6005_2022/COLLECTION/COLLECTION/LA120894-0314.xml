   <HEADLINE> 3 VIE TO HEAD JAPAN ' S NEW OPPOSITION PARTY ; ASIA : INFIGHTING MAY UNDERCUT NEW FRONTIER ' S CHANCES TO GIVE THE COUNTRY A STRONG TWO-PARTY SYSTEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fissures within a new opposition party that might give Japan a two-party system rose to the surface Wednesday when talks to choose a leader by consensus collapsed . Instead , three candidates -- former Prime_Ministers Toshiki Kaifu and Tsutomu Hata , and Takashi Yonezawa , chairman of the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist_Party -- filed to run_for leadership of the New Frontier Party in a vote that will be held today . The eight parties joining to form the new party have about 180 representatives in the lower house -- roughly 20 fewer than the Liberal Democrats who now govern in coalition with the smaller Socialist_Party . That would make the New Frontier legislators the largest opposition force in Japan ' s modern political history . But the divisions in their ranks point to a troubled future , regardless of who wins the leadership contest . All three of the candidates waited until just before the Wednesday deadline to file . Ichiro Ozawa , who in June , 1993 , led a mass defection from the Liberal Democrats that broke the party ' s 38-year lock on the national government , was named Frontier ' s new secretary_general when no rivals filed by the deadline . As campaign director and chief fund-raiser , he is expected to act_as Frontier ' s chief strategist . More_than anything else , the splintering of the opposition helped to sustain the Liberal Democrats ' seemingly unbreakable grasp on power until the Ozawa-led rebellion . Between 1955 and 1993 , no opposition party ever held more_than 167 seats in the 511-member lower house . The Socialists , who head the current coalition government , won that many in a 1958 election . Minoru Morita , a respected political commentator , predicted that Frontier ' s infighting and its failure to offer clear policy alternatives would allow the Liberal Democrats to regain sole control of government in the next general_election . He predicted that vote would probably be held simultaneously with a regular upper house election in July . The Socialists , who abandoned all their traditional policies to ally themselves with the Liberal Democrats in what the Frontier Party has called an &quot; illicit union , &quot; will lose seats by the dozens , opening the door to a Liberal Democratic victory , Morita predicted . However , Morita said , both the Liberal Democratic and the New Frontier parties reflect within their ranks the deep divisions of Japanese politics : whether Japan should be an open or a closed society and have a small or a large government . Consequently , neither party can enunciate clear policy , he said . Public apathy toward politics , as a result , has soared ; 55 % of the voters say they support no political_party , the commentator added . Hata said he decided to force a vote on the Frontier leadership despite a week of talks aimed at naming Kaifu by consensus because &quot; an election is democracy ' s social_contract to the people. &quot; Ozawa , Hata ' s onetime political ally and usually an advocate of decision-making by majority vote rather than by back-room deals , disagreed this time . Since he and Hata belong_to the Renewal Party , Ozawa favored Kaifu , a recent defector from the Liberal Democrats , as leader to provide a balance . In addition to the Hata-Ozawa falling_out , both the Buddhist-backed Komei ( Clean Government ) Party , the second-largest group in the new party , and Yonezawa ' s Democratic Socialists announced measures to keep their separate identities within the new party -- as if to preserve a fallback position should the Frontier Party break_up . Moreover , two lower house members of the Democratic Socialist_Party , including its former chairman , Keigo Ouchi , said they will not join Frontier when it stages its inaugural convention Saturday . Ouchi , who led the party into the first anti-LDP coalition in August , 1993 , complained that Frontier lacks a unified political philosophy . He charged that &quot; the new party is destined to become a party of the Soka Gakkai , &quot; a Buddhist laymen ' s group that founded and controls the Komei Party . There is widespread public aversion to the Soka Gakkai ' s exercise of political power .</TEXT>
