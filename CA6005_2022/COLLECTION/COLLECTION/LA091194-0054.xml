   <TEXT> Muslim stereotypes in the West grow out of a long historical tradition of anxiety about Islam . In the Middle_Ages , anti-Islamic polemics were motivated not only by the fear that Islam ' s armies might advance into the heart of Europe , but by the concern that its far superior civilization would take_over the continent . In the 19th Century , portrayals of the Muslims as barbarians were motivated by the need to justify Europe ' s colonial subjugation of their lands and exploitation of their resources . Today , even as the Arab-Israeli peace process makes new strides , dirt is again being dumped on the Muslims . In both Jean Sasson ' s &quot; Princesss Sultana ' s Daughters &quot; and Jan Goodwin ' s &quot; Price of Honor , &quot; Islam is portrayed as viscerally violent , misogynistic and fanatical . Sasson ' s book is perhaps the most strident . Purporting to be the real_life saga of a Saudi princess , a granddaughter of King Abd al-Aziz , the father of the modern kingdom of Saudi_Arabia , it reads like a bad pulp novel , exploiting several devices of the genre . The bottom_line is this : Sasson is a propagandist who makes sensationalist use of hearsay to tell a tale of unmitigated horror -- of incarceration , rape , child_abuse and sexual mutilation -- in_order to launch a racial attack on Arabs and smear Islam and Muslims . She speaks in her introduction of her &quot; love for the Arab people , &quot; but it has a distinctly hollow ring . In the same anti-Islamic tradition is Jan Goodwin ' s &quot; Price of Honor , &quot; a work of pop sociology which , in a series of ghastly stories , reviews the condition of women in Egypt , Jordan , Kuwait , Iraq , Iran , Pakistan , Afghanistan and other Muslim countries . Her opening tale of an 11-year-old Pakistani child married off to a man &quot; so old he has lost all his teeth and shakes all_the time &quot; sets the tone for the whole work , as do the aphorisms which litter her chapters . One of them , billed as an Islamic proverb , runs : &quot; A woman ' s heaven is under the feet of her husband. &quot; Although apparently in a feminist tradition , books such_as these are in_effect anti-Arab and anti-Muslim political tracts . The device of discrediting Islam by discrediting its treatment of women is an old one . In the Middle_Ages , the argument was that Islam gave women financial independence and a say in marriage and divorce : in short , too_much freedom -- all heresies to Church polemicists of the time who believed that women should be their husband ' s chattels . In the 19th Century , the argument was turned_on its head : Muslim women were not free enough . Lord Cromer , British viceroy of Egypt , championed emancipation for Egyptian women while loathing suffragettes in Britain . He was not concerned to give rights to women anywhere , but rather to rule Egypt effectively . He thought that by liberating Egyptian women from their religious culture he could break the back of the Egyptian nationalist movement , which had strong Islamic overtones . Today , the &quot; imperial torch &quot; has passed to American feminists . They are the only ones talking the &quot; imperial &quot; language of advocating the rescue of Muslim women from Islam . They have assumed the white_woman ' s burden . Their pronouncements are , for the most part , as crass and as politically motivated as Cromer ' s . What is worrying about the growing literature by Western , and especially American , women about the &quot; plight &quot; of Muslim women -- writers with little understanding of the Muslim world or knowledge of Islamic history -- is that it builds_on very dubious foundations ; that Western women have it all , and Muslim women have nothing ; that in_order for Muslim women to become liberated , they must denature themselves by throwing_off Islam . The same is not being asked of Jewish or Catholic women . Muslim women have a long , uphill battle ahead of them to wrest Islam from those who would make_it an anti-woman creed . Fortunately , a new genre of feminist writing by Muslim women themselves has emerged in recent years , counting among its brighter stars the Egyptian Leila Ahmed , the Moroccan Fatima Mernissi , the Turk Deniz Kandiyoti and the Iranian Afsaneh Najmabadi . These writers have sought to paint a scholarly and historically sensitive picture of women in Islamic society . They have tended to focus_on state policy toward women -- whether it be 10th-Century Baghdad under the Abbasid caliphs , the Shah ' s Iran or contemporary Egypt and Turkey , which both have a long history of modernization of state and society . What emerges from these studies is that although these states all call themselves Muslim , their policies toward women are highly diverse . And it is these state policies , not Islam , that ultimately determine the degree_of_freedom these women enjoy . Unlike Goodwin or Sasson , the Kuwaiti sociologist Haya al-Mughni takes_on a subject she knows something about in &quot; Women in Kuwait : The Politics of Gender. &quot; Writing from her own experience and from the extensive research she has conducted on the place of women in her country , she challenges the cliche , dear to Western feminists , that the Muslim male is a violent savage and that Muslim women are passive victims waiting to be rescued . The restrictions placed on women , she suggests , stem instead from the self-protectiveness of Muslim elites -- women as much as men -- who prefer to consolidate their own class interests and do little to encourage upward mobility by less favored individuals . The specters that terrorize Muslim women are not just religious obscurantism and traditional patriarchy . They are poverty , war and refugee status . In Bosnia , Muslim women have been raped by the tens of thousands . They have watched their children starve ; they have been besieged and tormented . If Western feminism had been able to see beyond its colonial legacy , it would have led the fight against such outrageous crimes against women . Instead , Western feminism , with few exceptions , has been shamefully silent on the plight of these Muslim victims , perhaps because there are no political dividends to be gained from such a cause . Books on Muslim subjects , however , are not all sensationalism or propaganda . Ehsan Naraghi , an Iranian sociologist and author of &quot; From Palace to Prison : Inside the Iranian Revolution , &quot; spent hours with the Shah in the last hundred days of his reign . He was called_in because the Shah did not understand the revolutionary ferment in his country and no longer trusted his courtiers and secret policemen . He wanted independent counsel . Naraghi ' s book recounts their fascinating conversations and then , with equal detachment and lucidity , describes the author ' s 33 months in Teheran ' s notorious Evin prison , to which he was confined by the Ayatollah ' s revolution . There can be no quarrel with such an authentic witness . To understand the historical forces that produced the present Islamic revival , there can be few better guides than Richard Bulliet ' s &quot; Islam : The View From the Edge. &quot; A professor of history at Columbia University , he hasspent the past 25 years researching non-traditional sources for Islamic history . In his pages , we see how Islam is actually lived_by different communities , widely scattered geographically , speaking more_than a dozen different languages , and steeped in very diverse cultural traditions . Instead of the usual history of Islam as seen from the center , and focusing_on the rise and fall of imperial dynasties , Bulliet seeks to explore why Islam became so strongly rooted in the social_structures of people living far from its political center . His &quot; view from the edge &quot; is a long-needed and invigorating corrective to fossilized Orientalism . &quot; We are living , &quot; Bulliet writes , &quot; in a crucial period of Islamic history , arguably the most intellectually and spiritually vigorous of the last thousand years . Muslims around the world are looking_to their illustrious past for solace and guidance in changing times , and non-Muslims are scrutinizing that same history for clues to the nature and fortune of contemporary Islamic movements . Both are incompletely served by the histories at hand. &quot; Such an informed and humane inquiry is a vital antidote to today ' s popular works of hostile denigration , which feed_on prejudice and , indeed , sustain it .</TEXT>
