   <HEADLINE> COUNTDOWN TO LILLEHAMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; NO MIRACLE NECESSARY FOR U.S. TO WIN GOLD ; HOCKEY PREVIEW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Win one gold medal , and they expect you to win one in every Olympics . But miracles have been in short supply for the U.S. hockey_team since 1980 , when Herb Brooks ' squad stunned the heavily favored Soviet_Union and won at Lake Placid , N.Y. Since then , seventh-place finishes at Sarajevo in 1984 and at Calgary in ' 88 , followed by a fourth-place showing at Albertville two years ago , have made mythological heroes of the ' 80 team and villains of the coaches who failed to duplicate Brooks ' success . How did Lou Vairo compile only a 2-2-2 record with a team that included Al Iafrate , Chris Chelios and Pat LaFontaine ? How did Dave Peterson , who had Mike Richter , Chris Terreri , Tony Granato , Brian Leetch and Craig Janney , not win a medal at Calgary ? Why , with Ray LeBlanc performing acrobatics in goal , did Peterson ' s team again come_home empty-handed in 1992 ? Each time there was an excuse : Too tough an act to follow in ' 84 . Too soft a pre-Olympic schedule in ' 88 . Too_little luck , too many defensive lapses and too_much ignorance on the part of the media and fans in ' 92 , according to Peterson , who played the role of Ugly American in two successive Games . Tim Taylor offers no prefabricated excuses for the team he will coach in the Winter Games , starting Saturday . And Taylor , who coached at Yale for 17 years and was an assistant to Vairo in ' 84 , might not need any . The competition appears closer than ever , the result of the United States producing more players who have more skills , and of traditional powers Russia , Sweden and Finland losing many of their best players to the NHL . In addition , Czechoslovakia , the bronze medalist in ' 92 , has split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia , diluting each . That gives the U.S. team solid medal hopes in probably the last Olympic hockey tournament involving anything close to amateur players . In 1998 , the American and Canadian teams probably will be composed mostly of NHL players . &quot; Homogenized is a pretty good_word , &quot; Taylor said of the Lillehammer field . &quot; There are nine teams that will contend for medals , and five or six that will contend for gold . You used to look_at the field and say there were two or three teams that would be battling it out for the gold , and everybody else would be going_for silver and bronze . I don ' t think you can say that right now. &quot; Said Russian Coach Viktor Tikhonov , who coached the Unified Team to the gold medal at Albertville : &quot; This Olympics will be more difficult than the previous one . Sweden , Canada and the United States have very strong teams. &quot; Taylor listed the gold-medal contenders as the United States , Canada , Sweden , Russia , the Czech Republic and Finland . Russia is seeded first and grouped with the Czech Republic ( seeded third ) , Germany , Finland , Austria and Norway . Sweden , seeded second , is grouped with Canada ( fourth ) , the United States ( sixth ) , Italy , France and Slovakia . Each team will play the others in its group once . The top four from each group will advance to the quarterfinals , matching the first-place team in each group against the runner-up of the opposite group . &quot; Obviously , our ultimate goal is to win the gold medal , and I don ' t think there ' s any reason we shouldn ' t have that as an ultimate goal , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; Our expectations are high . We ' re optimistic , positive and determined , but we ' re realistic . It ' s a very tough competition , and you have to be prepared , conditioned and focused as a team and the puck has to bounce your way. &quot; Taylor scheduled enough international and NHL games to gauge his team ' s weaknesses , and enough games against college and minor-league opponents to build his players ' confidence . He sculpted a young , fast team , oriented toward offense , reasoning that you can ' t teach a player to score but you can teach him to defend . Team USA is 37-17-6 with one game left in pre-Olympic play after its disappointing 1-1-1 showing in the final warm-up tournament at Rouen , France , where it defeated Norway , tied France and lost to Sweden . It had a 29-13-3 record against international opponents , and scored an average of more_than five goals a game while giving_up nearly four . How well the Americans learned to play in their own end of the ice might be the difference between a medal and disappointment . &quot; They ' ve been harping on defense all along , &quot; said Todd Martin , a 6-foot-4 , 210-pound defenseman who was drafted 66th by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1989 . &quot; The forwards and defensemen are helping each other and supporting each other . The emphasis is more on defense , and it ' s helped us so far. &quot; Unexpectedly , goaltending has become an issue . Mike Dunham , the third goalie at Albertville , was virtually assured of starting this time -- until he faltered in the last two months of pre-Olympic play . Garth Snow , his teammate and roommate at the University of Maine , overtook him in goals-against average ( 3.19 to Dunham ' s 3.89 ) and save percentage , . 889 to . 868 . &quot; If alternating works , we will alternate , &quot; Taylor said , but historically , that hasn ' t worked . In past U.S. successes , one goalie got all or most of the playing time : Jack McCartan led the U.S. team to the gold at Squaw Valley in 1960 ; Mike Curran helped win silver in 1972 and Jim Craig played every minute at Lake Placid in 1980 . The U.S. scoring threat depends_on the line of Craig Johnson , Todd Marchant ( the top pre-Olympic scorer ) and Peter Ferraro . Marchant , who was drafted by the New York Rangers while at Clarkson University , is probably the team ' s swiftest skater and used that speed to score a team-high 28 goals in 55 games before the Rouen competition . Taylor described Ferraro as &quot; puck lucky around the net , &quot; besides owning a hard , accurate shot . Right_wing Jim Campbell ( 24 goals before Rouen ) and center Brian Rolston , who has adjusted well to the fast international game , are also scoring threats . To guard the Soviet legacy of seven gold medals in eight Games , Tikhonov appears to have chosen experience over promise . He passed_over 6-5 wing Viktor Kozlov of Moscow Dynamo , the sixth pick in last June ' s NHL draft ; Sergei Gonchar , a 19-year-old defenseman with Moscow Dynamo who was drafted 14th two years ago , and several junior stars in forming his roster . The defense , however , is still relatively inexperienced , with five players 24 or younger . Past Soviet teams built their fluid passing_game on continuity , but Tikhonov will have no players returning from ' 92 , unless forwards Andrei Khomutov and Viacheslav Bykov are released by Fribourg of the_Swiss League . All eight defensemen from Albertville and nine of the forwards are in the NHL , but replacements have materialized with little apparent drop-off in skill . Sweden , which finished_out of the medals at Albertville , has a mixed roster that includes five 30-year-olds , including former NHL stars Hakan Loob ( Calgary Flames ) and Mats Naslund ( Montreal Canadiens ) , and a core of talented youngsters . Defenseman Kenny Jonsson , 19 , was the Swedish Elite League ' s 1992 rookie of the year and was drafted 12th last June , by Toronto . A sturdy 6-3 and 189 pounds , he ' s aggressive and an outstanding skater . Also worth watching is center Peter Forsberg , traded by the Philadelphia Flyers to the Quebec Nordiques in the Eric Lindros deal . An exceptional playmaker , Forsberg was the Elite League ' s most_valuable_player last season and was called the best young player in the world by Wayne Gretzky . Czech Coach Ivan Hlinka vowed to make sweeping changes after a poor performance in the Izvestia tournament , a dress_rehearsal for the Olympics held last December . Most of his players were in other European professional leagues and haven ' t practiced much together . He won ' t have to worry about goaltending , because it ' s in the gloved hands of Petr Briza . Briza , 29 , led Czechoslovakia to three bronze medals in the World Championships and to Olympic bronze at Albertville . Canada had only one productive line -- Chris Kontos , Vancouver Canuck holdout Petr Nedved and Mighty Duck draft choice Paul Kariya -- until Coach Tom Renney made a flurry of last-minute changes to fortify the offense . He added minor-league right_wing Jean-Yves Roy and Detroit Red Wing center Greg Johnson and summoned center Greg Parks back from Sweden . Also brought_in were Washington Capital defensemen Brad Schlegel , a member of the 1992 silver medal-winning Canadian team , and Mark Astley , who was playing in Switzerland . Renney ' s team is strong in goal with Corey Hirsch , a draftee of the New York Rangers , and solid if unspectacular on defense . &quot; As long as we ' re sound defensively , the offense will take_care of itself , &quot; Renney said . Several of Finland ' s players will be familiar to NHL observers . Goalie Jarmo Myllys played for the Minnesota North_Stars and the San Jose Sharks ; Raimo Helminen was with the Rangers ; Hannu Virta spent five seasons with the Buffalo Sabres and Mikko Makela skated for the New York Islanders and the Kings . A new face is center Saku Koivu , drafted 21st last June by the Canadiens . An explosive skater with quick moves , he ' s only 5-9 and 165 pounds and might be more effective in the lighter-hitting international game than in the NHL . Slovakia gained the final Olympic berth with the help of former NHL stars Peter and Anton Stastny . The new country won a pre-Olympic tournament , here , but it probably doesn ' t have enough depth to challenge the top-tier teams .</TEXT>
