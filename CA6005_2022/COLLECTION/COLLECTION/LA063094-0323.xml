   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / EXECUTIVE TRAVEL : SPOTLIGHT ON GERMANY ; THE GERMAN ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the midst of western Europe ' s worst recession since the end of World_War_II , Germany is struggling with slack demand at_home and abroad , high labor costs and the huge expense of unification with the former East_Germany . The Economy Last year , the western German economy shrunk 1.9 percent , the largest drop_in the postwar era . Nationwide , gross_national_product fell 1.3 percent from 1992 to 1993 . Unemployment has ballooned to a postwar high of 10.5 % . Despite calls to help Europe ' s ailing economies , Germany ' s influential central_bank has pursued a tight_money policy and has cautiously reduced interest_rates to avoid a surge in inflation . East-West Union The unification of West Germany ( Federal_Republic_of_Germany ) and East_Germany ( German Democratic Republic ) in October 1990 joined one of the world ' s richest countries with one of Europe ' s poorest . Today , western Germany is still far more prosperous , with eastern Germany accounting_for only about 7 percent of the total German economy . Since unification , eastern Germany has survived mainly on subsidies from the west -- totaling nearly $ 100 billion a year and more_than 7 # 000 people migrate from east to west every month . Labor_Force German workers are among the world ' s most literate and highly skilled . The literacy rate is 99 percent . German law requires 12 years of compulsory schooling beginning at age 6 . One third of German teens spend high_school in vocational_training while working part time as apprentices . Labor Costs German wages have been rising faster than those of other major industrial nations and nearly twice as fast as Germany ' s own industrial output . From 1985 to 1993 , unionized workers ' real hourly wages grew 23 % , but growth in output grew 12 % . In comparison , real wages in the United States fell 8.5 % for the period . Trade France is Germany ' s biggest trading partner , accounting_for 12 percent of_imports and 13 percent of exports in 1991 . More_than half of all German imports and exports are traded with fellow members of the European Union . Germany ' s principal imports and exports are machinery and transport equipment , manufactured goods and chemical products . Manufacturing Nearly one in three Germans is employed in manufacturing , the country ' s most important sector . Germany is the world ' s third-largest car exporter , behind Japan and the United States . The country also produces transport equipment , non-electrical machinery , metals and metal products and chemical products . Total exports from Germany totaled more_than $ 400 billion in 1992 . Natural_Resources Germany has substantial deposits of hard_coal , lignite , a low-grade soft brown_coal , and salt . Copper , tin and nickel ores and potash salts are also mined . Western Germany mined 178 million metric_tons of coal and 3.4 million metric_tons of crude petroleum in 1991 . Mining employs about 1 percent of the German work_force and accounted_for about 3 percent of GDP in 1991 .</TEXT>
