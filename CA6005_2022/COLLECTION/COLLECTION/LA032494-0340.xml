   <HEADLINE> FORD REACHES AGREEMENT ON JOINT_VENTURE IN CHINA ; AUTOS : PACT , WHICH STILL FACES APPROVAL BY GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING , CALLS FOR PRODUCTION OF VEHICLE COMPONENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ford Motor Co . said Wednesday that it had reached a tentative agreement to manufacture automotive components in China in a joint_venture with a Chinese parts supplier . The agreement between Ford and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp . comes as trade relations between the United States and China are strained because of U.S. concerns with China ' s human_rights record . Ford trails Chrysler Corp . and General Motors Corp . in gaining entry to China , which because of its sheer size is regarded_as the most promising auto growth market in the coming decade . Ford declined to put a price_tag on the agreement , but a spokesman said it involved &quot; tens of millions of dollars. &quot; The deal must be approved by the Chinese government . &quot; We believe that this joint_venture will be good for Ford , good for our partner and good for China , &quot; said Alex Trotman , Ford chairman and chief_executive . The agreement , expected to be finalized in several weeks , calls_for production of interior trim , seats , instrument_panels and other plastic parts . The work would be done jointly by Ford ' s plastics and trim unit and Shanghai ' s Yan Feng division , China ' s largest supplier of trim products . Ford , which recently set_up a separate China management operation , also is negotiating a joint_venture to make glass , electronics , engine parts and air-conditioning components in China . More importantly , it wants to assemble vehicles in China -- something its U.S. competitors already are doing_in joint_ventures . Chrysler is building Jeeps in Beijing ; GM is assembling pickup_trucks in Shenyang . &quot; This agreement is an important first_step , &quot; said James Paulsen , president of Ford ' s China operations . &quot; We are hopeful it will lead to vehicle assembly operations as well. &quot; The Big Three also are exporting vehicles to China . In the last two years , China has spent $ 309 million on vehicles produced by Ford , GM and Chrysler in North_America . That trade could be threatened by the Clinton_Administration ' s review of China ' s most-favored-nation trade status , which allows it to export goods to the United States under normal , low tariffs . Renewal of most-favored-nation status is in jeopardy because of the Chinese government ' s resistance to human_rights reforms sought by the Clinton_Administration . Defiant Chinese officials have said revocation of the favorable trade status would hurt the United States more_than China . Paulsen said Ford is concerned with the trade friction but is looking_at China with a long-term perspective . &quot; If MFN is not extended , there would be some disruption , &quot; he said . &quot; We hope it would not be a lasting one. &quot;</TEXT>
