   <HEADLINE> GOVERNOR CALLS FOR MORE JOBS AND PRISONS , TAX REDUCTIONS ; CALIFORNIA : WILSON SAYS FAMILIES EARNING UNDER $ 40 # 000 , SOME FIRMS SHOULD GET BREAKS . HE TERMS NEW JOBS AND CRIME REDUCTION ' TWIN PILLARS OF THE FUTURE. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Citing job creation and crime reduction as the &quot; twin pillars &quot; on which he hopes to build California ' s future , Gov . Pete Wilson on Wednesday proposed rewarding businesses that hire new workers and punishing more harshly violent criminals who repeatedly break the law . In an election-year State of the State Address to a joint session of the Legislature , the Republican governor returned to two themes that helped him win the state ' s highest office in 1990 : taxes and crime . Wilson proposed a $ 50 tax_credit for families earning less than $ 40 # 000 a year . He called_for putting more police on the street by hiring 500 new Highway Patrol officers and assigning them to local communities , and he said the state should construct six new prisons to hold more criminals serving longer sentences than ever before . The governor did not say how the cash-strapped state_government could afford to cut taxes and boost anti-crime spending at_the_same_time , and Democratic legislative leaders , reacting to the speech , accused him of making election-year promises that he knows he cannot keep . Wilson ' s speech made almost no mention of education -- always a top issue in the state -- and only a passing reference_to illegal immigration , a topic the governor hammered at time and again during the past year . Combining a pointed attack on federal policy-makers with a conciliatory call_for bipartisan action on state problems , Wilson urged lawmakers to build_on a year of cooperative efforts in which he and the Legislature enacted a package of bills intended to make California a better place in which to do business . The governor put further behind him his negative rhetoric of 1992 , when he complained in his State of the State speech that California had &quot; lost much of its competitive edge &quot; and warned that the changes he wanted would &quot; cause discomfort. &quot; The only discomfort he promised in this speech was for the state ' s criminals . Wilson linked his two key issues by insisting that companies will not build new plants or expand existing ones in a state where their customers and workers do not feel secure in their homes or on the streets . &quot; New jobs and safe streets are the twin pillars on which we must build California ' s future , &quot; he said . Wilson ' s fourth State of the State speech was received politely in the ornate Assembly chamber dominated by Democrats . His 30-minute address was interrupted 15 times by applause . But the two Democrats who are vying to oppose Wilson in the fall -- state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi -- said they doubted his ability to provide the leadership needed to get the job done . &quot; We can get California moving forward again , but it ' s going_to take common_sense , hard work and , above all , realistic solutions , &quot; Brown said . Garamendi said Wilson has had three years to turn the state around but has failed . &quot; Unfortunately , we ' ve been_on the wrong track , &quot; he said . &quot; He ' s had three swings at the bat , and in baseball , when you miss three times , you ' re out. &quot; Legislative leaders said Wilson ' s speech was unrealistic . Senate President Pro Tem David A . Roberti of Van Nuys said Wilson was in a &quot; campaign mode , &quot; cynically promising to boost public safety funding while cutting taxes , a pledge Roberti said the governor cannot keep . &quot; It was plainly an election-year speech , &quot; Roberti said . Democratic Assemblyman John Vasconcellos of Santa Clara , the Assembly ' s lead budget writer , called Wilson ' s speech &quot; an embarrassment &quot; because it seemed calculated to appeal_to voters at the expense of fiscal responsibility . &quot; It just does not add_up , &quot; Vasconcellos said . &quot; I am against crime and for new jobs too . But we also have a constitutional obligation to balance the budget. &quot; But Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga called it a &quot; good speech &quot; that could set the tone for another harmonious legislative session . &quot; If the Democrats will cooperate as they did last year , we will have a very productive session and California will become safer as well , &quot; he said . The governor proposed a $ 1 # 000 tax_credit for each job , up_to 100 , created in any start-up small businesses over the next two years . And his proposed $ 50 tax_credit would amount to an 18 % tax cut for the average couple earning less than $ 40 # 000 . Last year , at Wilson ' s insistence , the state suspended the renters tax_credit , which granted credits of up_to $ 120 for tenants in the same income group that Wilson says he now wants to help . Wilson ' s aides said the governor ' s proposed tax cuts would cost about $ 140 million -- in a general fund budget of about $ 40 billion . A tax cut for lower-income wage_earners , while affecting a large_number of people , is relatively inexpensive for the state because people in that income group do not pay very much in taxes to begin with . Wilson said he might seek more tax cuts as the year progresses . &quot; California must go_further in making our tax structure competitive , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; Taxes are a cost of doing business . States that tax less than California are clearly more attractive on that score. &quot; Wilson also called_for reduced regulations and paperwork and a doubling of the state ' s export finance program . He repeated his call to abolish the state Energy Commission , added the Integrated Waste Management Board to his hit list and suggested that the state trim middle management jobs by 10 % . Wilson complained that the state ' s efforts often are thwarted by the federal_government . Every time the state takes a step_forward , a &quot; giant push_back &quot; comes from Washington . &quot; It ' s not just that further defense cuts are idling aerospace workers , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; Federal water cuts are squeezing our farmers . A failed immigration policy is busting our budget . And higher federal taxes are pinching our wallets. &quot; On crime , Wilson said the state needs to focus_on three points : more police on the street , improved programs to keep children from turning_to crime and stiffer sentences for violent offenders . He made two references_to Polly Klaas , the 12-year-old Petaluma girl who was kidnaped from her home and murdered , and to Richard Allen Davis , the repeat felon who has confessed to the crime . Wilson called Davis an &quot; animal &quot; who should never have been released from prison . Marc Klaas , Polly ' s father , watched from the gallery at Wilson ' s invitation . Despite calling_for a greater effort to keep children from becoming criminals , Wilson said the state must deal strictly with those who do stray . Children as young as 14 who commit violent crimes , he said , should be tried as adults . &quot; We sympathize_with those neglected children who are tempted by drugs or gangs , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; But when as teen-agers or adults they victimize others , our sympathy must yield to responsibility . And our first responsibility must be always to protect the innocent and punish the guilty. &quot; Last year , Wilson said , more_than 400 children were murdered in California . &quot; Our streets are stained with the blood of our children , and it ' s got_to stop , &quot; Wilson said , his voice rising . &quot; Damn it , it ' s got_to stop. &quot; Wilson proposed hiring 500 new California Highway Patrol officers and assigning them to high-crime communities to help local police . He cited a special program in the city of East Palo Alto where a regional crime-fighting effort reduced the murder rate by 86 % . &quot; Swift response and united community worked in East Palo Alto , and it can work around our state to reduce the fears felt by too many Californians , &quot; he said . Wilson also repeated his call_for adoption of the &quot; three strikes &quot; measure to lock_up three-time violent felons for life . If the Legislature does not pass the measure , he said , the voters will enact the proposal as a ballot initiative . For certain arsonists and sexual offenders , Wilson said , the punishment should be even swifter : life in prison for the first offense . Repeat felons caught with a gun should face the same fate , he said . Credits allowing prisoners to cut their sentences in half by working and behaving well while behind bars should be curtailed , he added . &quot; It ' s time to turn career criminals into career inmates , &quot; Wilson said . The governor said the state should build six new prisons -- adding_to the 26 already housing more_than 110 # 000 inmates -- financed by a $ 2-billion bond measure that he wants to put before the voters later this year . Wilson acknowledged that the anti-crime effort would be expensive . He said he would rather spend the money on universities than prisons . But the state , he said , has no choice . &quot; Does anyone want to tell me how much a child ' s life is worth ? Does anyone want to assign a dollar value to the lives of 400 murdered children ? &quot; Wilson asked . Then he added : &quot; We can -- and we must -- prevent these crimes by building the prisons we need to put violent criminals away. &quot; Wilson made few attempts at soaring rhetoric and outlined no expansive vision for the state ' s future , as he did_in his first_State of the State speech in 1991 . Californians , he said , are less concerned about the coming century than &quot; about the security of their job today and the safety of their family tonight. &quot; But neither did Wilson lay_down a controversial agenda like the one he proposed in 1992 , when he waged confrontational , partisan conflict with the Democrats in the Legislature . An adviser agreed that Wilson ' s address was high on practical proposals and short on memorable flourishes . &quot; It was a no-frills , nuts-and-bolts kind of speech , &quot; said Dan Schnur , Wilson ' s campaign spokesman . Times staff writers Jerry Gillam and Carl Ingram contributed to this story . State of the State Speech Gov . Pete Wilson ' s State of the State Address was received with skepticism by a Legislature dominated by Democrats . State_Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi , both vying to replace him , later delivered their responses . THE SPEECH Gov . Pete Wilson : &quot; New jobs and safe streets are the twin pillars on which we must build California ' s future. &quot; THE REACTION Kathleen Brown : &quot; Wilson should ave spoken about the state ' s education needs . The issues of crime and the economy are paramount . But education fits into that. &quot; John Garamendi : &quot; It was basically the same type of old rhetoric : We ' re going to fight crime and cut taxes. &quot; Wilson ' s Major New Proposals Here are the major new proposals Gov . Pete Wilson made Wednesday in his State of the State Address : * An 18 % income_tax cut for Californians earning less than $ 40 # 000 a year . * Hiring 500 new California Highway Patrol officers and assigning them to help local police in high-crime communities . * Building six new state_prisons , paid_for with a $ 2-billion bond measure to be put before the voters later this year . * A $ 1 # 000 tax_credit for each new job created by start-up small businesses during a two-year period .</TEXT>
