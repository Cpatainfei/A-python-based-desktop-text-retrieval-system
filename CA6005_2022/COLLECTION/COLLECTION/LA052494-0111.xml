   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; SMITH ' S DEATH SENDS PARTY SCRAMBLING ; A LEADERSHIP FIGHT COULD SET_BACK GAINS LABOR HAS MADE AGAINST BRITAIN ' S CONSERVATIVES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Britain ' s opposition Labor_Party , running way ahead of the ruling Conservative_Party in opinion polls , is suddenly facing just what it doesn ' t need : a bruising fight for the party leadership . After a discreet silence following the unexpected fatal heart_attack on May 12 of John Smith , the man who had stepped_forward to give Labor a firm hand at the helm , speculation and maneuvering has begun over who will take_over the leadership at this crucial point for the resurgent party . Whoever is chosen stands an excellent chance of becoming prime_minister in the next national election -- a post Labor has not held since the victory of Margaret Thatcher ' s Conservatives in 1979 . While the Conservatives do not have to call an election until 1997 , Smith ' s death has sharpened the focus_on national politics . It has also put a spotlight on the potential for a rancorous political fight which , political observers say , could damage the responsible image that Labor_Party chieftains had painstakingly built under Smith . Infighting has increased in the absence of an election date for party leader . It could be set Wednesday at a meeting of Labor ' s executive committee . The history of the modern Labor_Party has been one of knock-down , drag-out battles , which , while providing entertaining material for political journalists , has hurt the party ' s chances in national elections . Conservative_Party leaders Thatcher and her successor John Major have successfully depicted the Labor_Party as a fractious bunch of socialists , incapable of governing properly over the past decade . But under Neil Kinnock and his successor as Labor_leader , the 55-year-old Smith , a fresh and talented group of Labor lawmakers has emerged . The leading members of this group now form the party ' s shadow cabinet , ready to step_in should the Conservatives lose a national election . In opposition , shadow cabinet members act_as Labor spokespersons in and out of Parliament for the various areas of government . Five have emerged as the leading contenders for party leader : * Tony Blair , 41 , the handsome , personable spokesman for domestic affairs , a front-running candidate representing the moderate-right wing of the party . * Gordon Brown , 43 , the Treasury spokesman , who is an ally of Blair as a leading voice for the centrists inside the party . He could step aside to allow Blair to dominate the field for the moderates . * John Prescott , 55 , employment spokesman , a bluff , combative orator who represents the center-left of the party , and is considered tough competition for Blair and Brown . * Robin Cook , 48 , a brilliant , bearded spokesman for trade and industry , who represents the traditional left of the party and its insistence on government ownership , a welfare_state and full_employment . * Margaret Beckett , 51 , the deputy party leader who may contest the leadership but is given only an outside chance of winning it . The leadership election could be held at any time but is expected to be delayed until after the June 9 European Parliament elections at the earliest . Labor moderates would like to see a July date to avoid a prolonged wrangle that could tarnish the unified image that the party established under Smith . But supporters of Prescott , the center-leftist , are promoting an autumn date in_order to build support for him . And they would like to see an American-style campaign that would test the contenders openly against each other . &quot; A rushed election would be an insult to members in the constituencies and the unions , &quot; said Alan Simpson , a Labor Member_of_Parliament . &quot; The most realistic and democratic timetable would be to hold the election at the party ' s annual conference in October. &quot; * Under the complex rules of the party leadership , the decision will be made by a cumbersome balloting of an electoral_college consisting_of a one-third each of union_members , Labor members_of_parliament and party members . The chief interest lies_in the possible fight between Blair and Brown -- good friends but possible antagonists -- since many analysts believe that if one steps aside the other could easily win the contest . In a speech Sunday , Brown spelled_out the moderate Labor view of the political future : party unity and a &quot; fair &quot; and &quot; socially just &quot; society with &quot; full and fulfilling employment. &quot; As for unity , Brown declared : &quot; We ' ve struggled too long for harmony to allow discord now. &quot; Brown ' s friends say he is the natural heir to Smith ' s mantle , and could serve as the bridge between the left and right_wing of the party -- but so far support seems to be favoring Blair , who , in a clever departure from past Labor positions , has lifted the law-and-order issue from the Tories with the slogan : &quot; Tough on crime but also tough on the causes of crime. &quot; The prospect of a Blair-Brown political fight , with undertones of lacerating battles among Labor_leaders in the past , alarms moderates who believe that it would derail the continuing moderation of Labor ' s policies and image . Furthermore , it could jeopardize their close working relationship between the two men in making the party more palatable to crossover Tory voters . &quot; Gordon is hanging_in there , &quot; said a colleague of the Treasury spokesman . &quot; Blair ' s team is in a state because they expected Brown to fold immediately , but he hasn ' t. &quot; * For his part , Prescott has dismissed Blair and Brown as Labor ' s &quot; beautiful people , &quot; and believes the next national election will focus_on his own specialties : employment and welfare . That view is shared by most of the contenders , and opinion polls show that the electorate is deeply concerned about job losses and the erosion of welfare benefits , particularly health , under Major ' s Conservative government . Major ' s chancellor_of_the_exchequer , Kenneth Clarke , said last week that work and welfare were dominant themes . In an earlier address , sounding almost Labor-like , Clarke declared : &quot; Families need a sense of security in their personal finances ; their home ownership depends_on mortgage finance , and their old_age requires adequate pension provision. &quot; The death of Smith has also changed the political calculus in the Conservative_Party , where Trade Secretary Michael Heseltine has been considered the leading successor to the 51-year-old Major should his unpopularity force him to step_down . Smith ' s death directed attention to Heseltine ' s own serious heart_attack last year and caused doubts about his ability , at age 61 , to take_over as prime_minister . Clarke , considered the second-strongest challenger to Major ' s leadership , appears in no hurry to challenge the prime_minister so Major may be safe for some time , particularly if , as Conservative MPs believe , Britain is headed for an economic upturn . Meanwhile , Oxford-educated Blair keeps Labor ' s torch burning in frequent television appearances and engaging parliamentary debate , putting_forward an image of youth and modernization . As one Conservative MP put it , with a note of chagrin : &quot; People will vote for Tony Blair without feeling that they are voting for Labor. &quot;</TEXT>
