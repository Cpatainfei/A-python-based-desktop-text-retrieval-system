   <HEADLINE> MARKETS ; TEA AND COMFORT FOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A doorbell tinkles as you enter the Friar Tuck Shoppe . It signals that you ' re leaving behind the honking traffic on Burbank Boulevard for a world of tea and crumpets , and bangers and mash , a place where you could imagine Mary Poppins holding forth on the proper hasty_pudding . The place has the aura of an old-fashioned provisions shop on a winding English country lane . Friar Tuck , which got its name because its owners also own the Robin_Hood Pub next door ( and because tuck is British slang for food ) , is the_English comfort-food zone for expat Brits in the San Fernando Valley . When you browse through the kippers and pork_pies , the meat puddings and the_English cheeses , visions of Mrs . Hudson shopping for Holmes and Dr. Watson come_to_mind . Now , however , Mrs . Hudson would also find popular English supermarket products . Besides the_English teas , some of Friar Tuck ' s more popular items , says shop manager Sharon Laslett , are the English-style Heinz canned tomato soup and baked beans . Laslett explains that the English-made versions taste entirely different from the American ones . &quot; A lot of these foods are what every British kid grew_up on , and from time to time the need for them just comes_over you , &quot; she says . * Even nursery comforts have been considered . Friar Tuck carries Nurse Harvey ' s Gripe Mixture , an over-the-counter remedy for baby colic , and Farley ' s Rusks , biscuits for teething babies . But what makes Friar Tuck outstanding are the bakery goods made at the rear of the shop . The flaky-crusted meat_pies and Cornish_pasties will erase the popular notion that British food is irredeemably stodgy . Friar Tuck ' s scones are downy-soft and filled with golden raisins . The rock_cakes are crumbly and perfect for tea . There are also Eccles cakes , feathery rounds of puff pastry with a filling of currants , immersed in a buttery brown_sugar coating . Many of Friar Tuck ' s regular customers also patronize Robin_Hood Pub for its Sunday roast dinners or the afternoon_tea served with finger sandwiches , scones with cream and homemade Battenberg cake . Then they come next door to shop for their favorite bakery goods , staples and deli items , including the pub ' s Scotch_eggs enrobed in a casing of coarse , well-seasoned sausage_meat . &quot; The pub and store are a good complement , &quot; says Lorraine Williams , who started the business 11 years ago with her husband , Michael Williams . The traditions of an English Christmas live_on , even in Van Nuys , and Friar Tuck prepares_for the holiday in a big way . They take orders for the rich mince_pies they ' ll be baking . A huge shipment of traditional fruit cakes will arrive ; the large dome-shaped or smaller rectangular cakes bear the customary covering of marzipan beneath a sugar glaze . Along with plum_puddings , brandy butter and hard_sauce are beautiful &quot; crackers , &quot; the seasonal table decorations that pop open_to reveal favors . More_than any time_of_year , at Christmas , Friar Tuck lives_up_to its comforting image . Shopping List FROM THE BAKERY * Savory Pies : The meat_pie , one of Britain ' s oldest traditions , was once a festival or fair food -- a rare treat for the poor who could buy them from pastelers and street vendors for a penny ( thus the name penny pies ) . Friar Tuck ' s elegantly crafted pies have come a long way from this street-food fare . The top_of_the_line is the steak and mushroom pie , tightly packed with slices of round_steak and mushrooms moistened with a juicy red_wine sauce ( not one of those gluey gravies that fill many commercial meat_pies ) . Friar Tuck ' s cooks also put_up chicken with vegetable pies , curried chicken pies and steak_and_kidney_pies . Each is an extremely generous individual serving . Friar Tuck likes to sell its pies unbaked because , says Lorraine Williams , they are so_much better freshly baked than reheated . But the shop will bake pies for anyone who wants to order them ahead . * Cornish_Pasties : The traditional noon meal of Cornish miners has always been the pasty , a pocket-sized pie usually filled with meat and vegetables . Friar Tuck ' s version is a gorgeous little football-shaped thing made from puff pastry with a subtly seasoned filling of vegetables and very lean ground_beef . The pasties are sold uncooked and frozen but , as with the pies , one can order them baked . People often do so for special gatherings , baby showers , wakes and other get-togethers , says manager Laslett . Usually the pub will have some baked pasties on_hand too . ( By the way , this pasty is not the same word that means &quot; like paste &quot; -- it rhymes with nasty , not with hasty . ) * Sausage_Rolls : These rolls of puff pastry formed around sausage_meat are meant to be eaten_out of hand like a pasty . They ' re also made on the premises , and you can either buy frozen , uncooked sausage_rolls or order them already baked . * Scotch_Eggs : Hard-boiled eggs , encased in a generous layer of sausage_meat and deep-fried , are frequently found on pub menus in England , but they ' re also sturdy enough , if accompanied by a slice of cottage loaf and pickled onions or Branston pickle , to make the main_course of a meal . Friar Tuck ' s Scotch_eggs are made next door at the Robin_Hood and may be purchased at the shop to go . * Tea Pastries : Friar Tuck ' s scones and rock_cakes , barely sweetened and plentifully studded with golden raisins , are the best in the Valley -- perhaps anywhere in the L.A. area . Friar Tuck ' s also makes its own traditional vanilla slices . These flaky pastry rectangles layered with rich vanilla cream are cousins to the Napoleon . * Eccles Cakes : This pastry gets its name from the city of Eccles in northwestern Lancashire . It isn ' t what we call cake in this country ; it ' s a currant-filled round of puff pastry . Friar Tuck ' s Eccles cakes have the perfect balance of sweet filling with savory pastry . * Battenberg Cake : Think_of it as a jellyroll arranged in a checkerboard pattern : pink and cream-colored strips of poundcake joined with strawberry_jam and then wrapped in a thin sheet of marzipan . FROM THE SHELVES : * Branston Pickle : This dark , sweet-and-sour condiment is made from finely cut fruits and vegetables . In effect it ' s a sort of chutney ; the dates , lemons and spices that flavor it clearly point toward India . It ' s as common on tables in England as ketchup is here and is considered essential with cold meats , Scotch_eggs and plowman ' s lunch ( country bread and cheese ) . * Baked Beans : &quot; The consummate nursery food &quot; -- meaning what English kids eat when they don ' t dine with their parents -- is how one expat describes Heinz canned baked beans : &quot; Everyone ate them heated_up and poured over toast ; kids love them. &quot; * Marmite : This is another nursery food , one every English_person will tell you is highly nutritious . It ' s a viscous extract of yeast and vegetables that can be made into a broth by the addition of hot water . Just as often it is spread undiluted onto toast , which is cut_into strips called Marmite soldiers , presumably to make_it more amusing for children to eat . Marmite , and its Australian counterpart Vegemite , both carried here , fall_into the category of acquired tastes , especially in their undiluted form . * Marrowfat Peas and Mushy Peas : Marrowfats are large , starchy field_peas ( the split-pea type of pea , as against the fresh green_pea ) that readily lend themselves to being mashed or pureed . Friar Tuck sells dry marrowfats , canned whole marrowfats and canned &quot; mushy peas , &quot; a puree of marrowfat peas that is a working man ' s staple in the North of England . The last contain a touch of sugar and butter that enhances the peas ' subtly sweet flavor . * Sponge Pudding : Sweet puddings , cold puddings , meat puddings , pease puddings -- there are literally hundreds of puddings in England , where the name is applied to almost any mixture cooked in a water bath . Friar Tuck carries treacle sponge pudding , a dessert that comes_in a can . You pierce the lid and place it upright in a pot of gently boiling water until it ' s done , and then invert it onto a plate . The resulting soft , light cake is anointed with a veneer of Golden Syrup , a slightly caramelized equivalent of corn_syrup , and eaten warm with custard sauce . ( Friar Tuck sells prepared custard if you don ' t want to make your own. ) * Heinz Salad Cream : While many British factory-made foods are worthy of a foodie ' s scorn , one item that isn ' t is Heinz Salad Cream . This smooth , creamy sauce , slightly less dense than commercial mayonnaise , gets its piquant flavor from vinegar and a touch of mustard powder . Salad cream makes sandwiches more luxurious and coleslaw addictive . * Hard Toffee : To eat Walker ' s English toffee , a rich , smooth caramel-like confection , you need to crack it into chunks , and to crack it , you need to chill it or freeze it first . So important is this ritual that Walker ' s includes a small but very sturdy metal hammer_in every large box . For smaller toffee appetites they also offer the &quot; crack pack , &quot; a 2x4-inch cellophane-wrapped package that you bang on a hard_surface to crack . The toffees come plain , with nuts or with both fruit and nuts . FROZEN MEATS AND DELICACIES * Sausages : Martin Lunt , the owner of Jolly Good , a California company that supplies Friar Tuck with excellent English-style sausages , says bangers got their name during hard_times when some sausages were made with too_much water and bread . They would expand and pop with a bang in the cooking pan . &quot; A good butcher would be offended if you called his sausages bangers , &quot; Lunt adds . &quot; But we have to call ours bangers , because USDA insists that any sausage containing even a small amount of bread crumbs , which is how the_British prefer them , cannot be called sausage. &quot; Whatever you call them , these links are delicious . Jolly Good ' s pork bangers come_in two sizes : One is about the size of a fresh Italian sausage , the other , called chipolata , is breakfast-link size . There are beef sausages too , also made with a touch of bread crumbs . These , according to Jolly Good , are preferred by Scots . * English and Irish Bacon : The British call American-style bacon &quot; streaky bacon &quot; ; they consider it an ingredient for cooking with . For breakfast , they prefer middle back bacon , which comes from the back and sides of a bacon pig , rather than from the belly . It is sliced thin from lean , smoked meat bordered with a narrow ribbon of fat . Friar Tuck carries Danish bacon , which is the kind most commonly eaten_in England these days . It is cut , cured and smoked in the_English style . Irish bacon , prepared in much the same manner , is leaner and has a slightly different flavor . * Frozen Kippers : Cured cold-smoked herrings , known as kippers , don ' t do too well in cans ; they lose their firm texture and their flavor suffers . But because herrings are oily fish , they freeze well . Frozen kippers are thoroughly acceptable , whether you grill them or cook them in their heat-proof plastic bag with butter ( most kipper experts prefer the fish grilled ) . In England , kippers are a favorite breakfast_food . A grilled ripe tomato , along with tea and good bread_and_butter , is its best accompaniment . CHEESES AND DAIRY GOODS * Cheeses : Friar Tuck carries several English cheeses , including the blue-veined Stilton , often called the Roquefort of England . After Cheddar , Cheshire is England ' s most popular cheese . Crumbly and moderately hard , Cheshire tastes best when &quot; toasted &quot; or slightly melted . In the North of England , an orange color is preferred in cheese , whereas people from farther south want their Cheshire in its natural off-white shade . So this cheese comes either as white Cheshire and &quot; red &quot; Cheshire ( the official term name for the orange-colored version ) . Apart from color , they are identical . Friar Tuck carries both Cheshires to serve with fruit and &quot; biscuits &quot; ( what we might call crackers ) or broiled on toast . Layers of mild , mellow double-Gloucester cheese sandwich a thick layer of the noble Stilton in the much-sought Huntsman cheese . Purists consider this &quot; invented &quot; cheese a sacrilege , but its fans love the contrast between the salty Stilton and the creamy double Gloucester . Huntsman is just as good with the traditional Port_wine and walnuts as plain Stilton . * Cream : For your tea-time scones , Friar Tuck imports true double_cream , which is exceptionally thick . * The Friar Tuck Shoppe and Bakery , 13638 Burbank Blvd. , Van Nuys , ( 818 ) 785-4814 . Open 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily .</TEXT>
