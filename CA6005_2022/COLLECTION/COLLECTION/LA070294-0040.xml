   <HEADLINE> SUDDENLY , WORLD CUP IS THE TALK OF THE TOWN FOR THOSE WHO WRITE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Picture the seventh game of the NBA finals decided by a Vernon Maxwell shot taken a full four minutes after time had run_out in the overtime_period . This is an analogy to the way injury time is kept_in World Cup soccer games . Only one person , the referee , knows how much time is left at the end of each period . I have enjoyed my introduction to international soccer play , but I don ' t think Pat Riley would appreciate playing a guessing game at the end of each period . RICHARD W . ADAMS Cerritos * Win or lose , American soccer has graduated with distinction during World Cup ' 94 . But what of our TV commentators . Al Trautwig easily topped the constant stream of gaffes by Roger Twibell , Randy Hahn and Jim Donovan , when , at_sea as usual , he advised that referees ' shirts could not be more_than 45 years old . Ty Keough admitted bias by wanting Italy to beat Ireland , whom he castigated throughout their victory . Soccer ' s Golden Gall Award goes_to Rick Davis , who criticized every kick of the Belgian and Dutch game , technically the finest so far . We deserve better . PATRICK COONEY Sun Valley * FIFA should make an inquiry into the game between Argentina and Nigeria . The Swedish referee should be made to explain the very poor officiating in the game . He was very partial in that game . You see , it is not good for business ( corporate sponsors ) if mighty Argentina is beaten by newcomers from Africa . JOSEPH E . ODIASE Santa Monica * What a bunch of jerks showed_up at the USA-Romania match at the Rose Bowl . As the Romanian players were being introduced , a huge chorus of boos emerged from many of the fans . And these yahoos didn ' t even have the excuse of being drunk . C ' mon , folks , let ' s try to show a little class . These guys are guests in our country and their only crime is to try to win the game . I ' m sure many others were as embarrassed as I was , but we are all made to look silly by the actions of a_few primitives . ROBERT E . GOYETTE Rolling Hills Estates * No wonder soccer isn ' t popular here . To celebrate , Mexico ' s supporters went_to Huntington Park to loot and riot . True futbol fans want their hooliganism in the stadium , where they can see it . AL HIX Hollywood * Any American will watch the U.S. team against the muscle of a foreign competitor . But would the audience be there for one professional U.S. team against another ? Probably not . It ' s safe to say that soccer has won a place in the hearts of Americans . . . every four years . JOSH NEUMANN Arcadia * Why is there so little interest in soccer by Americans ? Because it ' s a dull game . The foreign players call it football , but in soccer , you pass with your forehead and you run with the ball between your feet . Is it any wonder the final score is 0-0 ? RICHARD STEFFA Lawndale * Why all_the flap from the anti-soccer folks about a lack of scoring in the world ' s most popular sport ? A major difference between soccer and football scoring is that in the latter , six points are awarded for crossing the goal_line rather than one . And don ' t forget that boring , automatic conversion kick to make_it seven . I think it ' s time we appease the point-crazed American sports fan . Let ' s make a soccer goal worth 20 points in America . That way a game that now ends with a dull 2-1 score would become an exciting 40-20 . What about those dreary ties ? would n ' t we be a lot happier with a 40-all result ? And a 100-0 wipeout would provide plenty of material for those now-converted sportswriters to endlessly extol the greatness of some powerful soccer machine . PHIL GAROFALO South Pasadena * It seems that your World Cup contributors are unable to mention Ireland without mentioning alcohol . Do you really think we Irish enjoy being characterized as the world ' s greatest drunkards ? Sure , the_Irish like to drink alcohol . But in this day and age , in a paper such_as yours , I would have thought that you could come_up with something a bit more insightful , a bit more politically correct than to simply bleat , &quot; The Irish Are Drunks. &quot; FINBARR O ' RIORDAN Los Angeles * When will U.S. sports fans finally take soccer seriously ? About the same time Americans wholeheartedly adopt the metric_system into their daily lives . BOB DAVIS Alhambra * After watching portions of Belgium vs . Netherlands and Saudi_Arabia vs . Morocco , I believe one could tape soccer matches and sell them for a sedative . FRANK MURPHY Glendale</TEXT>
