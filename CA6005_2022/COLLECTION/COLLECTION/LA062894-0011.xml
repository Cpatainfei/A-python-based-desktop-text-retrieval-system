   <HEADLINE> HOW BEST TO REMEMBER STONEWALL ; PASS A BILL IN CONGRESS TO CURB WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Today marks the 25th anniversary of one of the most extraordinary events in American civil_rights history . Early on the morning of June 28 , 1969 , an unlikely collection of drag queens and street hustlers brought the simmering gay rights movement to a boil by fighting_back when the New York Police_Department raided the Stonewall Inn , a gay bar in Greenwich_Village . What a difference 25 years makes . No longer an invisible , cowering minority , tens of thousands of homosexuals paraded proudly in New York Sunday to mark the Stonewall riot . The very police_department that once entrapped homosexuals there now actively recruits gay officers . The nation ' s media scarcely covered the 1969 events and , later , largely ignored AIDS , even after thousands had died -- but one New York newspaper last week ran a 5 # 680-word guide for visitors on &quot; Things to Do With a Gay Flavor &quot; and editorialized Sunday that &quot; A just society must offer the same protections to men in leather and chains as_to those who wear Brooks Brothers suits. &quot; All across the country , gay_men and lesbians today enjoy a measure of freedom and dignity that seemed unthinkable until recently . Yet they still lack many basic rights . Twenty-one states still have sodomy laws . Homosexuals still cannot serve in the military without keeping their personal lives secret . Just recently , a federal judge in Washington state ordered the National_Guard to reinstate a highly decorated nurse who was expelled because she is a lesbian . It is ironic , and infuriating , that the Clinton Justice_Department has announced it will appeal that order . But this is the same wobbly Administration that campaigned on a promise to end the military ban on gays and then adopted the hollow &quot; don ' t-ask , don ' t-tell &quot; compromise with homophobes in Congress and the military . A hateful backlash from the political right has emerged in several states . And it is telling that even now some politicians still find it acceptable to bash gays , as Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) did_in a tawdry , ill-informed attack the other day in Congress on the budget of the National Endowment for the Arts . And gays themselves are divided . There were actually two marches in New York , the official one focused_on gaining human_rights for homosexuals worldwide and an unofficial one trying to steer attention to finding an AIDS cure . And many conservative gays are loath to be linked to the more flamboyant ones like those who fought_back 25 years ago in New York . But nearly everyone , save the most extreme bigots , can agree that no one should be denied employment or promotions because of sexual orientation . Most enlightened employers already realize that and value their gay employees . Now a bill introduced in Congress , co-sponsored by 30 senators and nearly 100 representatives , would prohibit most workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation . Its passage would be a fitting tribute to the Stonewall legacy .</TEXT>
