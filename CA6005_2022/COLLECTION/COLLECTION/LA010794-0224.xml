   <HEADLINE> ANOTHER SUPER CHALLENGE ; ENTERTAINMENT : TUSTIN FIRM HOPES TO WOW A DOMESTIC TV_AUDIENCE OF 130 MILLION WITH ITS SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Super Bowl halftime show is an odd bird . For starters , the audience comes for football , not for song_and_dance . The costly extravaganza lasts only 11 minutes , with only five minutes before and after to set_up and tear_down . And it must captivate the year ' s biggest U.S. TV_audience -- an estimated 130 million viewers -- not to mention the 75 # 000 fans in the stadium . That , in a nutshell , is the challenge that special-events producer Dennis Despie has faced four times in the past -- and will again on Jan . 30 in Atlanta . His Tustin company , Select Productions International , was picked by the National Football_League to orchestrate Super Bowl XXVIII ' s halftime entertainment . Despie has had easier assignments . He didn ' t get all_of this year ' s big-name performers lined_up until three weeks ago after country_music star Garth Brooks backed_out . &quot; Yes , I ' ve been panicked , &quot; Despie admitted , pretending to bite his fingernails -- which are , in fact , already suspiciously short . &quot; But we ' ll be all_right . It will happen. &quot; His confidence is based on a history of impressive feats : He produced former President Ronald Reagan ' s 1985 inaugural parade , the 1983 and 1987 inaugurations of former California Gov . George Deukmejian , and the 1987 Pan American Games in Indianapolis . Despie carved a niche for himself in the special-events industry while he was vice_president of entertainment for Walt Disney Co . During his 15 years with the theme-park giant , Despie produced his first three Super Bowl halftime shows , as well as numerous Disney attractions , including the popular Electrical Light Parade . He decided eight years ago to strike_out on_his_own . &quot; One of the reasons I left was because I couldn ' t separate my personal life from my work life -- Disney owned me seven days a week , &quot; said Despie , 48 , who lives with his wife and two grown children in Anaheim . &quot; Now I still work seven days a week , which leads me to believe it wasn ' t Disney at all , it was me. &quot; Despie ' s company consists_of four staff employees and , at any given time , an additional 100 or so temporary employees : costume_designers , choreographers and musical directors hired to help_out on a particular contract . Select Productions had revenue of about $ 4 million last year . &quot; Dennis Despie is one of the top talents in the business today , &quot; said Steve Clark , president of Management Resources , a leisure-industry consulting_firm in Tustin . &quot; There are not many people in the entire country who can produce the caliber of shows he does. &quot; The special-events industry has grown dramatically in the past few years , with sports promoters , Las Vegas hotels and amusement_parks all demanding increasingly sophisticated entertainment . &quot; that ' s what the consumer wants , &quot; Clark said . &quot; And Dennis has done a good job of expanding with the industry. &quot; Clearly , the NFL approves of Despie ' s work , for it keeps coming_back for more . &quot; Dennis has his feet firmly planted on the ground , &quot; said Jim Steeg , director of special events for the NFL . &quot; Other companies come_to us saying , ' We can make 12 elephants disappear. ' Dennis says , ' This is what we can do within your budget. ' He understands our objectives. &quot; Steeg would n ' t disclose just what the halftime budget is this year , other_than to describe it as &quot; seven figures. &quot; But the NFL ' s objectives are no secret : to woo the live audience while -- even more important -- keeping home viewers glued to their TV_sets . NBC charged Frito-Lay $ 3.6 million to sponsor the halftime show , and the food_company wants its advertising dollars to pay_off . Last year ' s show , produced by Radio City Music_Hall of New York , set a precedent that will be hard to follow . Historically , Super Bowl halftimes have taken their theme from the host city . But 1993 ' s halftime replaced custom with a mini-rock concert : Michael Jackson , live , at the Rose Bowl . TV viewers stayed tuned , and the NFL cheered . So now NFL officials want more of the same . The only problem is , busy superstars are tough to pin_down , as Despie has discovered . For most of the year , he has been working_on a country_music show that was to have spotlighted Garth Brooks . But Brooks had a change of heart , leaving Despie to scramble . Despite the near catastrophe , Despie ended_up with a respectable collection of celebrities : Wynonna Judd , Travis Tritt , Tanya Tucker and Clint Black . They will perform from a 7 # 000-square-foot stage constructed in 22 sections . Special-effects devices -- for lighting , smoke and pyrotechnics -- have been built underneath the segments , each of which will be rolled onto the field by 10 volunteer workers . So far , Despie has never experienced a humiliating flop , he said . However , at the 1990 Super Bowl in New Orleans , he came_close . For the halftime show , which featured jazz_musicians , his company designed an elaborate stage that unfolded into a huge riverboat . The stage was meant to fit unobtrusively along the sidelines until time for use . But when Despie arrived_at the stadium with his stage a week before the event , he realized that it would block the view of hundreds of fans during the game . &quot; We had to cut two feet off the stage so we could store it in the main tunnel , &quot; he said . &quot; Then when halftime came , we ran_out , unbolted the goal posts , lifted them out with a crane , and pushed the stage out on the field . Thank God the thing fit_in the tunnel . I was a very nervous man. &quot; Soon he ' ll be a nervous man again as he sits in the Atlanta stadium , waiting for another Super Bowl halftime to come_to a close . Then he and the hundreds of employees and volunteers who made_it happen will celebrate wildly . &quot; It ' s the biggest high in the world , &quot; Despie said , &quot; when the show is over , everything went as planned , and you know you entertained millions of people. &quot; Select Productions International at a Glance * Founded : 1986 by Dennis Despie , former vice_president of entertainment for Walt Disney Co . * Headquarters : Tustin * Employees : 4 * 1993 revenue : $ 4 million * Upcoming productions : Super Bowl XXVIII halftime , Jan . 30 ; opening of 50-acre amusement_park , Parque de Espana , in Ise Shima , Japan , April 22 . * Past productions : Halftimes for Super Bowls XI , XVIII , XXI and XXIV ; President Ronald Reagan ' s inaugural parade , 1985 ; California Gov .
