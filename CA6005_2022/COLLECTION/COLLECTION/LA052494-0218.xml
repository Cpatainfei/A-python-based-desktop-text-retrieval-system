   <TEXT> Microsoft ' s ' Chicago ' Due This Year : The next version of the Windows personal_computer operating system , the so-called Chicago product , will be out late in 1994 , the company said . Chairman Bill Gates said the product will be more powerful and simpler to use than current Windows software , which adds graphic icons and point-and-click commands to the DOS operating software that runs eight out of 10 PCs . Microsoft is still refining the product and has yet to select a trade_name for it ; Chicago is just a code name .</TEXT>
