   <HEADLINE> WHEN SILENCE CAN BE DEAFENING ; RABIN STAYS COURSE ; ARAFAT DUCKS SPEAKING OUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There cannot be a justifiable reason , an acceptable excuse or mitigating_circumstances for the escalating terrorist attacks on Palestinian and Israeli civilians that are now so clearly aimed at sabotaging peace talks between the two parties . All such atrocities deserve -- demand -- universal condemnation , wherever they occur and by whomever they are carried_out . An attack that coldbloodedly aims at killing and maiming schoolchildren is of an especially despicable order . The car_bomb that was exploded next to a bus picking_up students in the Israeli town of Afula this week , a manly deed for which the Islamic militant group Hamas heaps praise on itself , was simply and horribly an act of vicious moral cowardice . And the failure of Yasser Arafat to condemn it immediately and unqualifiedly was a shameful display of political gutlessness . The silence of the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization -- which for 20 years has insisted that it is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian cause -- is all_the more striking in light of Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin ' s harsh condemnation of the attack last month on Palestinian worshipers in the Hebron mosque , and the public inquiry Israel has been conducting into that crime . Why has Arafat had nothing to say , leaving it to his underlings to issue a weak and belated expression of &quot; regrets &quot; ? Clearly it ' s because he fears offending Palestinian radicals more_than he worries about giving offense to Israel or to the United States , whose President has publicly urged him to speak out . Arafat ' s silence is not a sign of his independence . Rather it ' s an admission of his increasingly shaky position among Palestinians and his lack of control . The peace process , to the frustration of both its Palestinian and Israeli enemies , will survive this week ' s attacks in Afula and Ashdod just as it survived the Hebron mosque massacre . The radicals and the crazies will , of course , keep trying to sabotage it with new acts of terrorism . For now -- certainly in Israel and almost certainly among the Palestinians -- the opponents of peace remain a distinct minority . But atrocities have a cumulative effect , with each adding_to the numbers of those who are inclined to doubt that the two peoples can ever coexist in relative peace . The best answer to that skepticism is to keep the peace talks moving , no matter what the provocations by militants and lunatics . The Israeli government deserves considerable credit for staying the course , under these most trying circumstances . For his part , Arafat says he ' s as committed to that process as Rabin . Some appropriate condemnation of this week ' s acts of Palestinian terrorism would have done much to underscore that commitment .</TEXT>
