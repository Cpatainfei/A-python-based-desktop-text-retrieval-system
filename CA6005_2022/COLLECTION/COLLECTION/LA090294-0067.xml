   <HEADLINE> PINCHED BY THE PRIVATIONS OF FREEDOM ; POLAND : THE DIFFICULT FREE-MARKET TRANSFORMATION HAS MANY YEARNING FOR THE BAD OLD DAYS OF COMMUNISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five years ago in Poland , a Solidarity-led parliamentary coalition defied the communist regime and formed a government around Tadeusz Mazowiecki , a Solidarity leader and long-time adviser to Lech Walesa . That act signaled the end of the totalitarian phase of Polish political life and the beginning of a historic era of political and economic transition , an era known as &quot; post-communism. &quot; While at first Polish political elites and Western analysts thought that a sustainable political democracy and market_economy could be built_in five to 10 years , the complexity of the systemic changes required is now better understood , and it is likely that Poland ' s post-communist era will last almost as long as its communist period . Moreover , five years into the transformation , Polish post-communism has manifested several characteristic features that were not anticipated : * The return of old elites . One of the least expected recent developments is the re-emergence of the old power elite as the new power elite . It was the communist nomenklatura , not the working-class members of Solidarity , who were_best positioned in 1989 to exploit the chaotic atmosphere of political and economic transformation . People like Jerzy Urban , the former spokesman for the regime and now one of Poland ' s most successful businessmen , were able to peddle influence in the unregulated financial environment and to exploit their connections with the mid-level bureaucracy . In the suburbs of Warsaw , villas are being built to complement the luxurious lifestyles of these former apparatchiks , frustrating the average citizen who has neither the capital nor the contacts with which to exploit the fruits of the people ' s long fight.This new / old social elite has significant linkages with fellow_travelers in the current post-communist government who , if history is any indicator , will not be immune to self-interest and corruption in Poland ' s uncontrolled political culture . * Lessening of the free market ' s legitimacy . While Poland is considered by the West to be an economic success story , Polish society has paid a heavy price for macroeconomic success through shock_therapy , and this has affected the social legitimacy of economic reform and of the notion of the free market . Two-thirds of Polish society is financially worse off now compared with five years ago . Inflation is still high ( averaging 40 % ) , unemployment is climbing ( topping 15 % ) and prices for household basics such_as milk and bread are increasing 50 % per year . More_than half of all Poles have no savings whatsoever , and the homeless -- hitherto unseen -- have become a common sight . Paradoxically to most Poles , as citizens pay taxes for the first time , social safety nets are being torn_down , with drastic cuts imposed on spending on health_care , education , pensions and unemployment benefits . As the number of victims of economic reform rises , society ' s commitment to the free market , or to &quot; capitalism with a wolf ' s face &quot; as Citizens ' Rights leader Tadeusz Zielinski recently put it , is diminishing . According to recent surveys , seven in 10 Poles are dissatisfied with the results of economic reform and 39 % would like the economy to be &quot; closer to a socialist economy. &quot; Popular support for the economic reform program stands at only 12 % , with the majority of Poles stating that their country is heading in the &quot; wrong direction. &quot; This disenchantment with economic reform is reflected in a conversation I listened to several weeks ago in Warsaw between two university_students . They were discussing the difficulties of daily life in modern Poland , and after a long , heated discussion one student finally concluded &quot; We voted for democracy and what we got was capitalism ! &quot; * Popular cynicism toward politics . Surprisingly , in the country where the broad-based sociopolitical movement Solidarity brought_down communism , politics today is seen as an inaccessible forum for change . Society feels alienated from the public policy-making process , thanks both to the Solidarity-led governments of the early 1990s , which were perceived as elitist and insensitive to the suffering of society , and to the new post-communist government , which displays a tendency toward secrecy reminiscent_of the communist era . In a return of the old &quot; us versus them &quot; dynamic , the government makes little effort to explain even the most basic aspects of the national economic and political_program . Thus , even important state programs , such_as privatization , remain an enigma to most Poles . The appointment of former communists to important state positions only fuels this cynicism . According to recent surveys , 41 % of Poles feel that the current political_system is closer to an &quot; undemocratic &quot; system than a democratic one in terms of its representation of the needs and aspirations of the people , and only 1 % are &quot; satisfied &quot; with the way democracy works in Poland . Most Poles suspect those in power of enriching themselves at the public ' s expense , with close to 80 % stating that political elites use their position to promote their private interests . * Nostalgia for the &quot; old &quot; system . A series of graffiti scrawled on a Warsaw building proclaims : &quot; Bring back communism ! &quot; &quot; We never had communism ! &quot; &quot; Then bring_back what we had ! &quot; The difficulties that encumber Polish society during the early phase of the post-communist transformation are fostering a misguided nostalgia for a past that is falsely idealized . But to an increasing majority of Poles , the basic employment security and the provision of social_services supposedly enjoyed in the Polish People ' s Republic overshadow the new reality of having a choice among products and not having to stand_in line for hours to buy them . With more_than 75 % of Poles finding a summer vacation unaffordable this year , appreciation of the freedom to travel diminishes in nostalgia for the &quot; good old days &quot; of guaranteed holidays . This nostalgia for the past has permeated even younger generations as they form their beliefs about what constitutes democracy . Teaching a class at the University of Warsaw , I asked my students to define democracy . Expecting a discussion on individual liberties and authentically elected institutions , I was surprised to hear my students respond that to them , democracy means a government obligation to maintain a certain standard_of_living and to provide health_care , education and housing for all . In other words , socialism . While nostalgia for the past has become a common refrain in Poland , no political_party has yet openly advocated a return to the past system . The anti-Solidarity coalition won because it succeeded in conveying the message that it could combine the new freedoms ( including many aspects of the free market ) with the social_security of the past . As Polish leaders struggle to sustain the country ' s high growth_rate and to continue the process of privatization , bringing higher prices and increased unemployment , social discontent will increase , memories of the past will become rosier and parties that advocate government paternalism will become the dominant political preference . That is exactly the danger that the ongoing economic difficulties , the popular cynicism and the nostalgia for the past are fostering .</TEXT>
