   <TEXT> This is to express our appreciation of your information re Afghanistan in Howard Rosenberg ' s column , &quot; Isolationist TV : Viewers Pay the Price , &quot; ( Dec . 19 ) . Since the United States no longer competes with Russia for supremacy in Afghanistan , as you say , little or nothing is reported to us . Afghanistan is ravished and conditions there , I understand , compare with any other country which is being destroyed by terrible warfare . We would be interested in knowing more about the present situation and hope there will be more coverage in the future . ELEANOR GROSSMAN La Canada</TEXT>
