   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN SEES RUSSIA BECOMING STABLE ; ECONOMY : PRESIDENT SAYS WORST OF REFORM-ERA SPASMS ARE OVER . OTHERS CALL OUTLOOK GRIMMER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin asserted Wednesday that Russia , which has enjoyed relative political and economic calm for the last few months , is_on its way toward real stability , with the worst of reform-era spasms over . &quot; The economy is gradually stabilizing . By the end of the year , we expect a stable inflation_rate of 5 % to 6 % a month , &quot; he told workers in a Moscow suburb . &quot; The political situation is also stabilizing . . . . Life has become more tranquil. &quot; Yeltsin ' s claims echoed assurances poured on at a recent meeting of major Western companies by Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , who derided investors ' reluctance to risk their money in the Russian economy . &quot; Russia is a different country today , &quot; Chernomyrdin told business_leaders from the_likes_of Coca-Cola and United Technologies . &quot; The peak of Russian chaos is behind us , and I ' m sure this is irreversible. &quot; Others , of course , are less sanguine . It was just this kind of a suspiciously quiet period that preceded the attempted Soviet coup of 1991 ; Yeltsin ' s fateful decision to disband Parliament last year also came as the brief northern summer -- when Russians are too busy toiling in country gardens to play politics -- surrendered to autumn . Those who see a grimmer outlook point to the new state budget finally approved by Parliament last week . It includes a deficit of 70 % that is likely to go higher . They also note the continuing drop_in industrial production , which fell by 26 % in the first_half of this year , the Economics Ministry reported . Russia , the pessimists say , faces big problems now as it tries to help 1.4 million registered unemployed workers , up by 600 # 000 since December . The pressure from stalled factories , the jobless and the cash-strapped military makes Russia ' s nascent stability far from guaranteed . But what does appear certain is that Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin are happily using the recent peace to embark_on a broad image refurbishment meant to encourage the foreign investment Russia desperately needs . Government officials say foreign investors have injected only about $ 1 billion this year , showing less faith in the prospects of mighty Russia than in the economy of the tiny Baltic_state of Estonia . The Kremlin is only beginning active work to attract more foreign money , promising tax_breaks and long-term land leases to major investors . Investment is becoming especially critical for Russia because the Kremlin has curtailed its subsidies to industry while selling_off thousands of factories to private shareholders . The next step_in revamping Russian industry calls_for extensive private investment in modernizing factories that show potential , while those that do not will be allowed to go bankrupt . But Russians clearly lack the billions upon billions of dollars that will be needed to upgrade an industrial base that , at many factories , has not been touched for decades . Enter the foreign investor , and Yeltsin ' s assertion this week to a group of them that &quot; the recent months were the quietest in the political sense during the whole period of reforms. &quot; Indeed , since the October tumult that left almost 140 people dead in fighting between pro-Yeltsin forces and pro-Parliament rebels , Russia has gotten a new constitution , a new Parliament and a &quot; Civic Accord , &quot; an agreement by political_parties , unions and regional leaders to try to work together in peace . Russia ' s image as a somewhat more civilized place has also been bolstered in the last two weeks by its entry into the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; program and an agreement with the European Union lifting most trade_barriers to Russian goods and recognizing Russia as no longer a state-run economy but rather one &quot; in transition. &quot; Yeltsin on Wednesday pointed to dropping inflation -- now at 9 % a month compared to 26 % at the start of the year . Some state statistics also indicate that Russians ' real income has grown by about 10 % this year . Virtually all statistics in Russia are considered somewhat dubious . But the signs of some economic easing are visible even on the streets -- if only in the floods of bananas , once rare luxuries , now being hawked in Moscow and much of Russia . Despite the signs of a possible economic end of the tunnel , government and opposition economists agree Russia has a long , long way to go before it will enjoy Western-style , stable prosperity . Independent economist Pavel Bunich cast doubt on whether the government can continue to keep inflation low , noting that the new budget calls_for pumping up the money_supply to cover promises of funding for culture , science and an increase in the minimum_wage . But perhaps the most quietly ominous denial that Russia has entered a period of stabilization came from the chairman of the Moscow branch of ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky ' s party . The recent period of calm , said Viktor Bogaty , means that &quot; Russian people still haven ' t decided what to do . Now is a period of thinking things over , and then we will act. &quot;</TEXT>
