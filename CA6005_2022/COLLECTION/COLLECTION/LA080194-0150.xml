   <HEADLINE> LAWYERS TAKE OFFENSE AT PEER ' S UNORTHODOX DEFENSE ; LAW : UTAH PUBLIC_DEFENDER ELLIOTT LEVINE FACES POSSIBLE DISBARMENT FOR RESPECTING HIS CLIENT ' S WISH TO BE EXECUTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is hard to say whether his exposure to James Holland transformed Summit County public_defender Elliott Levine into an unbridled renegade or merely uncovered long-held sentiments . What is clear is that the choices he made in defending Holland against murder_charges appear to have galvanized him . What began as an earnest ethical inquiry into the obligations and boundaries of criminal defense_lawyers has started to take_on the markings of an unabashed infidel ' s crusade against his own profession . This became evident when Summit County handed Levine another murderer to defend in early 1991 just as Holland was sentenced to death here for the second time . Holland had eagerly confessed , readily pleaded guilty , adamantly resisted his lawyer ' s efforts to appeal and flatly chosen the executioner over life in prison . If anything , Von Lester Taylor ' s case -- as told in court documents -- looked even less promising than Holland ' s . Along with a companion , Taylor , who was in his mid-20s , broke_into the Tiede family cabin in the Beaver Springs mountain development not far from Coalville . When the Tiedes arrived home , Taylor without provocation shot the mother point-blank , then the grandmother , killing them both while one daughter looked_away , praying . Later , he told his companion to shoot the father but impatiently did_it himself after the companion took too long to aim . Then he doused the father with gasoline , cut the telephone_lines , set the cabin on_fire , took two daughters hostage and ran a_couple_of roadblocks before crashing his car . Looking_at these details later , there are those , chiefly in the defense bar , who sputter at the fact that Levine let Taylor plead guilty to murder , and those , chiefly prosecutors , who think he had little choice if he wanted mercy at a penalty hearing . There is also dispute about how this decision was reached . Levine says Taylor , who reportedly attempted suicide in jail , insisted he wanted no trial . Taylor now claims , through his new lawyer and in an affidavit , that he was just following Levine ' s advice . What is beyond challenge are the events that unfolded at Taylor ' s penalty hearing in May , 1991 . In order to make what ' s called a &quot; proportionality &quot; argument -- in_essence to compare the character and actions of this defendant with current Death Row inmates -- Levine called a willing James Holland to the witness_stand . Levine wanted to show the jury that Holland was a career criminal and three-time murderer who expressed little remorse , while the much younger Taylor by comparison had a single felony burglary conviction and lots of remorse . The judge would n ' t let him do_it , so instead Levine simply had Holland testify generally about his background and his unhappy life in prison . Then Levine launched a closing argument on Taylor ' s behalf that would often be quoted in the coming months , not infrequently with tones of wonder . &quot; It ' s not as though Mr. Taylor is sitting here trying to cover_up his deeds . . . &quot; Levine began . &quot; Mr. Taylor came_forth and he admitted two murders . . . . In opening arguments I told you that the decision to do this came as a result of long hours of conversation between myself and Mr. Taylor . Let me tell you a little bit about my approach as a defense_attorney . . . . Last Thursday I got home very late , walked in my house and what happens to be_on TV but ' L.A. Law ' . . . . I don ' t even know who the character was . She was talking to a judge , and she was explaining to the judge an obligation as a criminal defense_attorney , and that is to do what I can to get my client off . In my opinion , that ' s a bunch of bull . You don ' t do yourself any good , I don ' t do my client any good , and I don ' t do the system any good . I don ' t feel that is my task as a defense_attorney . . . . My approach differs in that normally what I try and do , I talk to my client , I need to know whether or not they committed that crime . . . . &quot; If the client has committed the crime , &quot; then I feel it ' s my obligation to get that person to take the first_step , and that is to come_forth , admit their wrongdoing , then to get them through the system in a sense that the appropriate punishment is imposed . . . . that ' s exactly what I ' ve done_in Mr. Taylor ' s case . . . . Mr. Taylor has taken that first_step , a very difficult step for anyone , and that is admitting wrong . . . . He couldn ' t believe what he did . It sickened him . . . . Mr. Taylor does not lack emotion . Mr. Holland lacks emotion when he talks_about his murders . . . . Mr. Taylor was very emotional here . . . . &quot; There are those who look_at this decidedly unorthodox description of a defense_attorney ' s role with some understanding . Instead of denying or contesting , they point_out , Levine was seeking mercy by saying his guy admits it , his guy is remorseful , his guy is willing to face the music . It was , some thought , a plausible approach -- even if Levine had gotten rather carried_away . &quot; I don ' t know that you can hold an attorney responsible_for what he ' s saying to a jury in closing argument , &quot; one lawyer generously observed . &quot; He ' s doing whatever he can. &quot; Others were not nearly as generous . &quot; Stand_up and atone and rehabilitate ? &quot; chortled attorney Bruce Savage , whom Summit County eventually appointed to take_over the Holland and Taylor cases . &quot; That only works if everyone is operating_on the same page , if everyone agrees to rehabilitate you if you stand_up . If everyone is not in_agreement on how the game is played , you can ' t be doing this . You just can ' t be doing this . Pleading into a capital charge when you know they ' re coming at you with a syringe is problematic . You ' re not going_to be an adversary , but the problem is , they still are. &quot; If only Levine had stopped there , he might still have avoided all that was to come . But he did not stop there . When the jury ended_up handing Taylor a death sentence , Levine filed an appellate brief with the state Supreme Court . In it , among other points , Levine included what he later acknowledged was the incendiary &quot; kicker. &quot; In it , Levine claimed a denial of rights because the trial_judge hadn ' t allowed him to argue &quot; that an individual such_as James Holland is a prime candidate for the death_penalty while ( Taylor ) is not. &quot; * In the face of the vitriolic firestorm that erupted when the Utah legal_community learned he ' d offered his own client to the executioner , Levine has remained resolute . He was not saying that Holland deserved to die or should die , Levine emphasizes to anyone who will listen . He was just saying Holland was a more likely candidate , on a spectrum of possibilities , if you were going_to have a death_penalty at all . How could he have jeopardized Holland ' s position , at any rate , when what he ' d done was totally consistent with Holland ' s position ? &quot; Mr. Holland has always taken the position that he wants to be executed for his crimes . . . . &quot; Levine told the State Bar . &quot; I , as counsel for Mr. Holland , have , in consultation with him , pursued his desires . . . . I defy anyone to specifically delineate any disadvantages which occurred to either client . . . . I have continually maintained a position , though not popular in the legal_community , consistent with Mr. Holland ' s publicly stated desires and wishes. &quot; Here and there in the legal_community , a_few isolated voices of support have been heard , one being that of Greg Smith , partner in Affordable Legal Advocates , a Salt_Lake_City law_firm representing low-income people . &quot; This response to Levine has me baffled , &quot; he said . &quot; What do they want ? Are we to force the state ' s will upon our clients ? Mr. Holland wanted the death_penalty , and his attorney got him exactly what he wanted . I think Levine was playing adversary , in the sense that he was advancing the interests of his client against what the state wanted . What bothers me is , so many attorneys don ' t even see the danger here of Big Brother telling you what to do . This is an intrusion of the state between the defense_attorney and his client . It ' s amazing to me that everyone sees this as so easy to call . I don ' t think it ' s easy , or cut and dried . I think it ' s nebulous . This is not an easy issue. &quot; For most of the Utah legal_community , though , it indeed has been an easy issue . For most , Levine ' s actions were , in the end , an utterly unacceptable betrayal of what they were all about . Levine was making not just the defense bar but everyone in the legal_system look bad . The defense_attorney ' s unfettered advocacy of his client , after all , is what validates the prosecutor ' s resolute and unbridled effort to prove him guilty , and the state ' s devastating act of imprisoning or executing him . Each side assumes their unpleasantly hard pushes will be countered , and thus justified , by someone else ' s hard pushes . If the defense_attorney refuses his role , the state ' s actions begin to look questionable , if not odious . Plainly , Levine ' s stance demanded a response . That task fell to Utah state Assistant Atty . Gen . J . Frederic Voros , the appellate-level prosecutor in the Taylor case . In a motion to the Utah Supreme Court , he put his argument simply : To preserve the &quot; integrity of the judicial_system , &quot; Levine must withdraw from both the Taylor and Holland cases . The state high_court ' s justices unanimously agreed . On Sept . 23 , 1993 , granting Voros ' motion , they removed Levine from the Taylor case and referred the_matter to the Utah State Bar for &quot; appropriate action. &quot; On Jan . 14 , acting_on their own , the justices also removed Levine from the Holland case . They were appalled by Levine ' s &quot; fundamental and underlying misconception of the defense_attorney ' s role , &quot; and they were appalled by Levine ' s failure to act_as an adversary at Holland ' s second penalty hearing . But what most troubled the justices was Levine ' s comment in Taylor ' s brief . &quot; Defense counsel breached his duty of loyalty to Holland . . . &quot; the court wrote . &quot; By asserting that Holland deserved the death_penalty , Levine not only acted directly contrary to Holland ' s interest , but he aligned himself with the state ' s position . . . . We are aware that Holland might prefer the death_penalty . . . . Nevertheless , an attorney is not justified in asserting that his client deserves the death_penalty , even if his client desires to have that penalty imposed. &quot; Levine received his first warning from the Utah State Bar ' s Office of Attorney Discipline in late October . That was followed in late February by notice that an &quot; informal complaint &quot; had been filed against him by the State Bar , and in May , after a hearing , that a State Bar panel had found probable_cause to file a formal complaint against Levine in the state District Court . In coming weeks , Levine faces measures that range from reprimand to probation , suspension or disbarment . &quot; Levine has raised legitimate issues that need to be resolved , &quot; said Gary Ferrero , the State Bar ' s assistant disciplinary counsel . &quot; Elliott Levine is not a bad_guy . I see bad_guys ; he is not one . The thing that makes Elliott a problem is that Elliott doesn ' t see the problem. &quot; * If Levine does not see the problem , he certainly does see the likely verdict . There is little chance , he realizes , that he ' s going_to prevail . In late spring , as a result , Levine more or less stopped fighting . He also stopped lawyering , for his practice had virtually evaporated in the wake of so_much bad publicity . For a time , he worked as a customer service phone representative for Fidelity Investments in Salt_Lake_City . Now he is taking the summer off . &quot; Maybe I ' ve adopted Holland ' s philosophy , &quot; he said one recent morning . &quot; I don ' t want to fight . I have more important things to do with my life . I ' d rather spend my time and energy on something else , like my 15-month-old daughter , instilling values . Look_at the big picture : The worse thing that can happen is , I get disbarred . So ? I ' m not sure I want to be involved in the law anymore. &quot; Most lawyers in Utah would say that this is just as well . Most would say that Levine , by refusing to play their game , in a way has demonstrated precisely why it has to be played . Most would say that Levine , whatever the merits of the issues he ' s raised , just doesn ' t have the instincts and stomach for criminal defense law , so he shouldn ' t be cast in that role . This story of a lawyer turned renegade to his profession , in other words , appears to be ending satisfactorily for just about everyone in Utah but Levine -- Levine , and , as it happens , James Holland . The one who seven restless summers ago first inspired a lawyer ' s improbable rebellion now draws no solace from those who would defend him from Levine . Being described by his attorney as a prime candidate for the executioner has not altered Holland ' s thinking at all . &quot; I am mad as hell about the Supreme Court decision , &quot; Holland , from his 5-by-7-foot cell , recently advised Levine in a three-page handwritten letter . &quot; I ' ve been_on Death Row for 6 1 / 2 years and still can ' t get beyond automatic review . . . . The court wants an appeal and I don ' t . . . . I am guilty of murder . . . . I still want you as my attorney . . . . I will not accept any attorney the courts want to give me . . . . As far as I am concerned you are my attorney . . . . Elliott , I appreciate what you have done . . . . You have done nothing but what I wanted done. &quot;</TEXT>
