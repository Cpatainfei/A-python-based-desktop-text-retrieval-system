   <HEADLINE> WAYNE MAY HAVE TAKEN A_FEW TOO MANY CHECKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wayne Gretzky wants to take NHL players on a &quot; goodwill &quot; tour of Europe ? Somebody needs to explain this one to me . The last time I looked , Europe had hockey . We ' ve already sent them Jari Kurri and Teemu Selanne -- what more do they want ? If Gretz wants to spread some good_will , I suggest he start right here in North_America . We are the fans with season_tickets for games that will never be played . Wayne , you might want to try spending a little more time at the negotiation table and less planning your European vacation .
