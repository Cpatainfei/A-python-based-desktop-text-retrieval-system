   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / JAMES P . PINKERTON : SOCIETY ' S RIDE FROM BABBITTRY TO BOBBITTRY ; TO DETER MISCREANTS , SHUN THEM . WE NEED TO RESTORE A COLLECTIVE SENSE OF SHAME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1922 , Sinclair Lewis wrote the novel &quot; Babbitt , &quot; in which he satirized the life and times of one George F . Babbitt . Lewis so brilliantly captured the smug narrow-mindedness of pre-Depression America that &quot; Babbittry &quot; entered the lexicon as a noun to describe bourgeois conformity . This eponym is still used , but not often , because narrow conformity is not a big problem any more . Much more common today is &quot; Bobbittry , &quot; the phenomenon in which people such_as John and Lorena Bobbitt are accused of crimes but plead their case to the media before they even see a jury . In shamelessly seeking sympathy for their sins , they often strike it rich . Mr. Bobbitt was acquitted of raping his wife , but subsequent revelations do not show him in a flattering light . No sense of abashedness , however , kept him from appearing on Howard Stern ' s New Year ' s Eve show to hawk T-shirts . Mrs . Bobbitt ' s future is less clear , pending the outcome of her trial . But whether she is convicted of assaulting her husband or not , her star turn_in the pages of Vanity_Fair suggests that she realizes that her story also has salability . Americans will undoubtedly second-guess both Bobbitt juries for years . But more important than the legal questions is a larger one : what we do about Bobbittry ? That is , how do we satisfy our natural fascination with the lurid and the bizarre without letting that interest spill_over into the encouragement , even the subsidization , of destructive behavior ? It ' s doubtful that the celebrity treatment afforded the Long_Island Lolita , Amy Fisher , and her Lothario , Joey Buttafuoco , did anything to inspire either of the Bobbitts . But after getting way more_than her 15 minutes of fame , the mild sentence meted_out to Fisher for shooting another woman in the head is not exactly the maximum deterrent imaginable . And Buttafuoco , who surely was an accessory to something , has done_well since his wife was shot ; he too has been lionized by Stern . We live_in a country where Oliver North is running_for the U.S. Senate , where G . Gordon Liddy has a highly rated radio talk_show , where the Mayflower Madam has been transformed into a maven of manners , and where even the satanic Charles Manson gets royalties from his own line of apparel . One can only speculate about the career prospects for Heidi Fleiss and the Menendez brothers , and wonder what would happen if fugitive Nazi Martin Bormann were to emerge from the hinterlands of Argentina . Would his first stop be Nuremberg or &quot; Nightline &quot; ? Nobody wants to be a killjoy and prohibit adulation for criminals and crackpots . And it would n ' t work anyway , just as the highway patrol never dissuades anyone from slowing_down to rubberneck as we pass a traffic accident . What can we as a society do ? Let ' s bring_back shunning . People have long known that not every problem has a legislative or judicial solution , so they developed the idea of excluding miscreants from their company . Way back when , this was effective : Socrates chose death over separation from his beloved Athens . Ostracism -- expulsion from the group -- can be cruel , but it works . If conscience doesn ' t stop the individual from doing the wrong thing , there ' s still the hope that peer pressure will . Half a century ago , the great sociologist Ruth Benedict made the distinction between &quot; guilt cultures &quot; and &quot; shame cultures. &quot; Benedict argued that Americans are driven by a personal sense of right and wrong , of repentance and salvation . The Japanese , she said , are more concerned with &quot; face , &quot; honor and obligation to the collective . Both systems can restrain bad impulses , although lately it seems that the Japanese are doing better . Too many Americans feel neither guilt nor shame , leaving the law as our last , cumbersome , line_of_defense . We don ' t need to force adulterers to wear a scarlet_letter , but it would n ' t hurt to send a stronger signal that unacceptable behavior is . . . unacceptable . The Bobbitts will test our resolve . But if we want to deter harmful conduct , we ' ll have to shun the paperback and the made-for-TV movie . And when John Bobbitt starts selling armor-plated jock straps , we ' ll have to just say no . When Lorena Bobbitt pitches her new_line of cutlery on the Home Shopping Network , we must change the channel . It ' s a small price to pay_for restoring a much needed sense_of_shame .</TEXT>
