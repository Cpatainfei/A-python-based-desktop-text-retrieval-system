   <HEADLINE> ARIZONA HOME SEARCHED FOR BODIES ; INQUIRY : AUTHORITIES USE TRAINED DOGS TO COMB BASEMENT OF MAN CHARGED IN DEATH OF FORMER NORTHRIDGE WOMAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Building their case against murder_suspect John Joseph Famalaro , Arizona and Costa Mesa authorities have recovered clothing believed worn by a former Northridge woman the night she vanished from Orange County three years ago . The clothing , a black mini-skirt and other articles , were discovered in a box inside Famalaro ' s cluttered Prescott Country_Club home . They were identified by Costa Mesa police and could be key evidence linking him to Denise Huber , whose nude body was found frozen in the back of a stolen rental truck parked in his driveway in Arizona . Investigators on Monday also interviewed employees of a San Clemente self-storage facility where Famalaro rented seven units from July , 1992 -- a year after Huber disappeared -- to February of this year . Famalaro contracted to have constant power maintained to the locker where he kept his personal belongings , including a freezer that may have been the one in which Huber ' s body was discovered last week , said Harry Tosado , facility manager of Allsize Self-Storage . &quot; The whole time the freezer was here , he wanted 24-hour electricity , which people here thought was very odd , &quot; Tosado said . &quot; It ' s written right on the contract ' 24-hours. ' &quot; When Famalaro moved the last of his belongings out of the facility in February , he asked the employees to help load the freezer onto his truck without delay . &quot; He said he had a generator on his truck that would keep the freezer running while he was driving , but the main thing was , he wanted it loaded real quick , &quot; Tosado said . Denise Huber grew_up in Northridge , where her family moved_in 1973 . The family was_active in Presbyterian_churches in North Hills and Calabasas before moving to Newport Beach . She attended Los Angeles Baptist High_School in North Hills . The discovery of the clothing and other personal effects , meanwhile , has led authorities to consider filing an additional charge of kidnaping against Famalaro , said Costa Mesa Police Lt . Ron Smith , which would make_it a capital crime . There were these other developments Monday : * Authorities are investigating the source of the chest freezer , and believe it may have been bought_at a Montgomery Ward store in the Orange County area shortly after Huber ' s disappearance . * Fingerprints have been lifted from the freezer and officials are attempting to match those to Famalaro . * A Yavapai County ( Arizona ) grand_jury will consider an indictment in the case as early as Thursday . In the meantime , Famalaro ' s defense_attorney , Lawrence W . Katz , said he is disturbed by the public attention to his client and what he fears is an assumption of guilt . &quot; This is a total circumstance case , &quot; Katz said , adding that the stakes are especially high because his client could face the death_penalty . &quot; I ' m not sure how you go from a frozen body in a freezer to murder. &quot; Famalaro was being held_in lieu of $ 250 # 000 bond in Yavapai County Jail . Huber ' s frozen body was found face-down inside the 23-cubic-foot freezer with her wrists handcuffed behind her , Yavapai County Sheriff G.C. Buck Buchanan said . Authorities said Huber appeared to have received about 10 to 12 blows and lacerations on the head , such_as could have been inflicted by a hammer or crow bar . Tools and construction equipment were seized from the home of Famalaro , who has been making his living as a house_painter , contract handyman and real_estate_agent . Smith said there were no signs of sexual abuse , but the frozen condition of the body may prove helpful in further examination . But Smith said that the circumstances of Huber ' s disappearance on June 3 , 1991 might remain forever a mystery , adding that it is still unclear whether Huber was taken by force or was somehow enticed to accompany her assailant . Her car was found abandoned with a flat_tire on a Costa Mesa freeway . &quot; The mystery to be solved now is : Who is Famalaro ? &quot; Smith said . &quot; Denise was the mystery for three years , but he ' s the mystery now . He had the body frozen and kept moving it around . Bizarre. &quot; The description seemed an apt one to the many law_enforcement officials who converged on Famalaro ' s house Monday . Said Sheriff Buchanan : &quot; I ' ve been involved in some bizarre cases , but this has got_to be one of the most bizarre. &quot; Throughout the day , Costa Mesa and Arizona officials were searching for other possible victims on Famalaro ' s hilltop property . Officials have called_for an excavation team that will begin digging at three sites there . For the second time in as_many days , search dogs from Utah found three &quot; areas of interest , &quot; two in the suspect ' s dirt-floor basement and another under a back-yard shed . &quot; I don ' t know what we will find in there , &quot; Berra said . &quot; But we want to leave this house knowing that there is nothing left to be found. &quot; Buchanan said the search will continue Tuesday and was partly prompted by the discovery of the names of 10 women during the search of Famalaro ' s home . By late Monday afternoon , authorities had contacted five of the 10 -- some located in Phoenix and Southern California . The remaining five were still being sought . &quot; We found the names and we feel the need to check them out , &quot; Berra said . Authorities also are concerned with the largely circumstantial nature of the case . It has led them to cart_away file_cabinets full of Famalaro ' s personal documents and possessions for further examination . &quot; Right now , all we have is a man in custody , a body found in a rental truck in his driveway and some of the victim ' s personal effects , &quot; Berra said . &quot; that ' s not enough to prove guilt. &quot; &quot; We need to know where he ' s been and what he ' s been doing the past three years . We need to know much more about this man. &quot; Prosecutors , who are in the midst of deciding whether Yavapai or Orange County officials will handle the case , have not indicated whether they will seek the death_penalty . Times staff writers Rebecca Trounson , Michael Granberry , Len Hall and David Reyes contributed to this report .</TEXT>
