   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; GOP STANDS READY TO CAPITALIZE ON NATION ' S GROWING CONSERVATIVE MOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just over a month from now , if the opinion polls are right , Election_Day could be a banner day for the Republican_Party around the country -- especially in federal races . The GOP is in a good position to recapture the Senate , where it is only seven seats shy of a majority . Even in the House , a bastion of Democratic control for four decades , the GOP has an outside shot at picking_up the 40 seats needed to elect Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) the first GOP Speaker since Joseph W . Martin Jr . in 1954 . This is true not just in the Congress but also at the state and local levels . Indeed , the big four states of California , Texas , New York , and Florida may all have Republican governors next year . Most important , the November elections provide Republicans an opportunity to begin building a new governing coalition of conservatives and moderates . There are , of course , any number of reasons why Republicans should be optimistic -- though not complacent -- about next month ' s elections . Redistricting , on balance , works in the GOP ' s favor . Republicans will also benefit from one of the iron laws of U.S. politics : The party of the President , even popular ones like Dwight D . Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan , loses congressional seats in off-year elections . With most congressional incumbents being Democrats , Republicans stand ready to tap the anti-incumbency fever gripping the country . The angry national mood against Washington will work against congressional Democrats , many of whom have grown remote from their constituencies and disdainful of reform after decades of nearly unchallenged rule . Finally , the GOP should be able to capitalize on the unprecedented unpopularity of the President himself , especially in the South and West . Part of this , no doubt , is_due to the President ' s leftward &quot; old Democrat &quot; approach to policy and personnel ; part is a result of the Administration ' s style of governing , where late night , collegial sessions over pizza often take the place of the councils of government , and part is the result of a confused foreign_policy . But the depth of the animosity exhibited against the President seems to go_deeper than partisan politics -- to the core of his leadership style . More important for the long-term , however , Republicans have an opportunity to help shape a growing conservatism among American voters . That conservatism shows_up in poll after poll , where Americans are_on record for tougher measures against crime , stricter welfare regulations and a return to traditional values like personal responsibility , hard work and obligation to family . More generally , increasing numbers of Americans are profoundly mistrustful of government , especially at the federal level . They believe it has grown too_large , too expensive and too intrusive in their lives . This rising public skepticism about the role of government is the fundamental reason for the spectacular failure of the Administration ' s health-care proposal . Much as most Americans lauded the President ' s goals of universal coverage and cost-containment , they drew_back , rightly , at the prospect of turning the nation ' s health-care system over to federal bureaucrats . It wasn ' t the special_interests or GOP obstructionism that doomed the Clinton health-care plan . The plan itself was simply unacceptable to a citizenry wary of too_much government . This growing conservative mood does not translate into a strict ideological majority . The balance of U.S. political power in_general elections remains where it has always been : with the tens of millions of moderates . Now , however , those moderates share a range of convictions -- on crime , welfare , values and , above all , the role of government -- that resonate far more among conservatives than liberals . And because they do , Republicans possess a real opportunity -- this fall and then , in 1996 , at the presidential level -- of building a governing coalition of moderates and conservatives . The strongest governments in America have been the result of coalitions . Franklin D . Roosevelt ' s coalition of the center-left brought_in the New Deal and forever altered the shape of American society . Reagan ' s own coalition , of the center-right , ushered_in sweeping changes , leading to the creation of more_than 20 million jobs , the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history and ultimately the end of the East-West confrontation . Some believed that Bill_Clinton ' s election in 1992 had revealed the possibility of creating yet another governing coalition of the center-left . Such predictions , it is now clear , were premature . Indeed , the record of the Administration over the last 20 months irrefutably demonstrates that no workable center-left coalition exists . The reason is simple . Moderates have moved right . Liberals have not . This is true even within the Democratic Party . Democratic congressional leaders have tried to blame Republicans for the failure of much of the Administration ' s domestic agenda -- especially health-care reform . But their arguments ring hollow . Clinton ' s legislative failures occurred in a Congress where both houses are firmly controlled by his own party . Again and again , the Administration attempted to build coalitions between the party ' s liberals and moderates -- and often failed . Even the Administration ' s &quot; successes &quot; -- on the budget in 1993 and the crime bill this year -- invariably saw dozens of congressional Democrats , many of them moderates , voting against the Administration . Ironically , many of these moderate Democrats , especially from the South and West , are vulnerable this fall . In contrast , some of the most liberal congressional voices hold &quot; safe &quot; seats . This means that next year , the congressional Democratic Party might well be even more liberal and even more incapable of reaching_out to a moderate-center to govern . This fall , Republicans must do more_than capitalize on the Clinton_Administration ' s failures . In the best scenario for Republicans , we will gain control of both houses . Another scenario , could be that Democrats will hold nominal control of the House and the Senate , but Republicans and conservative Democrats will have an excellent opportunity to control the policy agenda from time to time . In either of these cases , Republicans will have to provide the American people an alternative vision for this country . The GOP will have to develop an agenda to govern that both reflects core conservative beliefs and appeals_to moderates disillusioned with the Democratic Party and dubious about big government . In this regard , the recent &quot; Contract with America &quot; issued by House Republicans is an important document . The &quot; contract &quot; contains several of the essential tenets of a reinvigorated conservatism : term limits ; a balanced_budget amendment ; a strong national defense , and using the free market , not bureaucrats , to spur economic_growth . Some liberal commentators have criticized the &quot; Contract with America &quot; for its &quot; Reaganism. &quot; This should come as no surprise -- demonizing the Reagan years has become something of a cottage industry on the left . But , in a way , the critics are right . The &quot; contract &quot; is_full of the spirit of Reagan . It is firmly rooted in conservative principles and optimistic about America ' s future . But above all , by laying_out an agenda with potential appeal_to tens of millions of both moderate and conservative voters , it is a GOP promise to govern . In doing so , it gives voters who already had a reason to vote against the Democratic Congress and the Clinton_Administration a reason to vote for Republicans in Congress. *</TEXT>
