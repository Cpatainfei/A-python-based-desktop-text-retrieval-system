   <HEADLINE> BOARD EXPECTED TO OK SPECIAL JAIL_CELLS FOR TB ; PREVENTION : THE $ 30 # 800 PROJECT WOULD ALLOW THE ISOLATION OF INMATES TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF TUBERCULOSIS IN JAILS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The County Board of Supervisors is expected to approve funding Tuesday to modify six jail_cells to isolate inmates who have contracted or are suspected of contracting tuberculosis . The project is expected to cost $ 30 # 800 and involves renovating four cells in the county Intake / Release Center and two units at the Women ' s Jail in a move to prevent the spread of the highly contagious_disease . The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the project funding Tuesday . None of the supervisors has voiced opposition to the proposal . Dr. Hugh F . Stallworth , the county ' s health officer , has said the precautions at the jails are being proposed because of the disease ' s rapid_growth in Orange County and concern over the overcrowded nature of local jail facilities . Because of close living conditions and health_problems brought into the jail system , inmates are generally considered to be at higher risk of contracting some diseases , including tuberculosis , officials said . At least three cases of TB have been diagnosed in the jail population so far this year , compared to a total of six recorded last year . In those cases , inmates had to be transported to Western Medical Center-Anaheim , where they were quarantined and provided medical treatment . The new cells , officials said , would allow inmates to be isolated much faster , provide_for more treatment and eliminate some transportation to and from the hospital . Inmates assigned to the modified units , to be outfitted with special ventilation_systems that would circulate contaminated air directly outside , would typically spend two to three weeks in the units while undergoing treatment . While not a serious problem at the jail , the disease has raised concerns in the past two years at La Quinta High_School in Westminster , where more_than a dozen students have been treated for active TB . County health officials recently prescribed treatment for 79 students whose skin_tests revealed that they harbored bacteria which could trigger the disease at a later time . Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease that is spread by airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing . Generally , the disease is spread by prolonged contact with an infected person . Symptoms of the disease are coughing , fever , night sweats , weight loss and the coughing of blood .</TEXT>
