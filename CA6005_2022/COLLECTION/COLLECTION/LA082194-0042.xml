   <HEADLINE> THE GOOD SOLDIER ; AS THE MILITARY DOWNSIZES , THE WAR-HARDENED VIETNAM GENERATION IS RETIRING , INCLUDING ARMY LEGEND ALFRED BAKER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the summer of 1969 , Alfred M . Baker was blown_up by a satchel full of Viet Cong explosives . The explosion threw Baker 20 feet into air ; the impact broke his back in two places , ripped_off almost half his face and snapped bones all_over his body . Medics deposited him in the triage section for those left to die . Before a priest began giving him last rites , Baker managed to clear_away the teeth and bits of gum knocked into his mouth . &quot; Get the f--- away , &quot; he mumbled to the priest . &quot; I ' m not Catholic . And I ' m not going_to die. &quot; Baker was awarded a Purple_Heart . It was his fourth in three years . And Vietnam marked only the early phase of Baker ' s career . Later assignments -- including two &quot; black_book &quot; posts delegated by the secretary of the Army -- were just as dangerous and often more challenging . Yet no assignment , Baker contends , has been as painful as his post as chief_of_staff , U.S. Command , Berlin Brigade . Next month , he will oversee the closing of the only U.S. base behind enemy lines , ending a half-century-old American presence in a city that symbolized the Cold_War . And as he turns_off the lights of the headquarters built for Nazi Field_Marshal Hermann Goring , Baker will also end a three-decade career . &quot; In some ways , this has been the toughest assignment I ' ve ever had . It ' s saying goodby to a city and a mission that has played such a role in history . It feels_like amputating your own leg , &quot; Col . Baker , 53 , reflected recently in the cavernous office that once served the Luftwaffe . &quot; Plus the whole kaleidoscope of what I ' ve done and all I ' ve been for 30 years ends here . This is the last stop . There is no more. &quot; The end of the Berlin Brigade and the cashiering of one of the Army ' s most decorated soldiers are microcosms of the changes within the American military during the final phases of its massive drawdown . Their last_days symbolize the passing of a certain kind of mythic American soldier and an ambitious mission that first led the United States to international power . The result is transforming the U.S. Armed Forces . Since the Berlin Wall fell_in 1989 , more_than half the 1 # 669 U.S. military facilities overseas have been eliminated , reduced or inactivated -- just short of the 54 % reduction of 1990 levels expected by 1996 . More_than 600 were in Germany . And since the height of the U.S. deployment in 1987 , more_than 200 # 000 of the half-million soldiers overseas have been reassigned to home bases , left the military or retired . The overall goal is a 56 % reduction of 1985 levels by 1996 ; the largest drawdown is again in Germany . From more_than 250 # 000 troops in 1987 , the U.S. presence will be reduced to less than 100 # 000 soldiers after cutbacks culminating with the deactivation of the Berlin Brigade . Like Baker , many of those affected by the cutbacks in posts and personnel are the most war-hardened officers still serving in the military . Due_to either time , notably the 30-year career limit , or the new streamlined military , many who cut their teeth in the foxholes , marshes and jungles of South Vietnam are now being retired . Among them is one of the Army ' s contemporary legends . IT TOOK MORE THAN 15 OPERATIONS TO PUT Baker back together ; he underwent 10 just to reconstruct his face . &quot; I told them I had looked_like Rock Hudson . They obviously screwed_up , &quot; he laughed . The only visible reminder of Vietnam is a lump on his upper right lip , which he opted to keep rather than undergo more surgery . As a professional soldier , Baker didn ' t take a military discharge . Eighteen months later , he was back in Vietnam . During his third tour , he worked under John Paul Vann , the acclaimed but controversial military maverick dissected in Neil Sheehan ' s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography , &quot; A Bright Shining Lie. &quot; It was a turning point in Baker ' s life . Vann appraised the Saigon government early on as corrupt and inept . He understood the war was being lost among the peasantry , and he knew high-tech weapons were often producing more guerrillas than they killed . After failing to win promotion and thus forced_out of the Army , Vann returned to Vietnam as a civilian adviser and architect of a different strategy to counter the Viet Cong . His eight-man teams , culled from the diplomatic , intelligence and military communities , worked_on a U.S. program advising villagers at the grass-roots level on economic , political , agricultural and health issues . Baker became one of Vann ' s boys . Years later , colleagues referred to Baker ' s final tour in Vietnam as his Col . Kurtz period , after the officer played by Marlon Brando in &quot; Apocalypse Now &quot; who pursued the war on_his_own terms . Shortly after Baker arrived in the jungles and rice_paddies of remote Phu-Yen Province , he dismissed the other seven members of his team . &quot; They were the wrong people in the wrong place doing the wrong jobs . It wasn ' t their fault , &quot; Baker explained . For the next 19 months , he lived mostly alone , moving among the villages to work_on their problems . &quot; I thought if I was going_to get them to follow my advice , I had to live like they did , &quot; he recalled . &quot; So I went_on operations with the local Vietnamese home guard to show we were confident of their security . I slept_in villages to show we weren ' t afraid to live alongside them in exposed areas . I worked_on problems of rats and agriculture to prove we were interested in their lives . And I spent a lot of time drinking tea and talking_about what concerned them . Every two months I went_into town to get rip-roaring drunk , then I came_back and lived like a Buddhist monk , never raising my voice . &quot; But , &quot; he stressed , &quot; I never went native. &quot; During that last year in Vietnam , however , the 6-foot-1 Baker dropped to 135 pounds from 170 . Vann was a role_model for Baker . Their lives took similar turns . After World_War_II , Vann , a Southerner , pulled himself out of poverty through the Army . Baker grew_up on a farm near a West_Virginia coal camp ; his father worked for the railroad . He joined the Army because &quot; the military represented the prospect of a middle-class life , &quot; he said . Vann excelled rapidly in the Army . He distinguished himself in combat during the Korean and Vietnam_wars , although his heroics led to tales of recklessness as well as valor . He also spoke his mind and rarely hesitated to take_on the military brass , often drawing awe from troops but disapproval from superiors . The combination ultimately cost him a general ' s star . Baker also rose rapidly through the ranks ; he was a major within seven years of his first commission . Soldiers who knew him in those early years remember archetypal blood-and-guts prowess . &quot; He was a tremendous hunter , a natural hunter . that ' s why he was so good in combat , &quot; recalled Everett Thomas , who went_through Ranger and Airborne training with Baker in 1963 . Besides the Purple_Hearts , Baker also won two Bronze_Stars , a Silver_Star_medal , two Legion of Merit awards and an Air_Medal in Vietnam . He is &quot; either the luckiest or unluckiest soldier I ' ve ever known . Al Baker should have died a_couple_of times . But he was just too tough and too stubborn , &quot; said Lt . Col . Jay Erb , who is now at the Pentagon . Flamboyant and funny , with a propensity to break_into nasal renditions of country_and_Western songs , Baker sees himself as an outsider . Officers who have served with him on four continents speak_of Baker in almost adoring terms . But he ' ll also leave the Army short of a general ' s star , despite interventions by military peers . &quot; My way of thinking is different to almost everyone else in the officer corps . It often puts me out of step , &quot; Baker said . Vietnam ' s climax , however , had a vastly different impact on Vann and Baker . Vann ' s ambitions ultimately undid him . His criticism of U.S. strategy softened ; his hawkish actions hardened . Obsessed with victory as proof of America ' s rightness , he began to let the ends justify the means . And as that victory proved ever more elusive , he called_for air strikes and even boasted of the smell of dead_bodies wafting in from nearby jungles after their hits . Vann died in a 1972 plane crash during a North Vietnamese offensive . In contrast , Baker was one of many officers who , angered by the American experience in Vietnam , became wary of war . &quot; During the first two tours , I had one job , &quot; Baker said . &quot; It was to seek_out the enemy and destroy him . That was my mind-set and that ' s what I did . During the last tour , I began to understand we weren ' t going_to be able to win . And I began to see why. &quot; One of Vietnam ' s most potent legacies was a generation of officers reluctant to engage militarily without clear goals and support from well-defined policy and the public . Without all three , many in this generation became gun-shy , sometimes reluctant to use force or even prepared to speak out against it . Many were outraged as the U.S. military was subsequently burned again by policy in places such_as Beirut and Somalia ; others urged the White_House to think through its goals before taking_on Iraq . Baker came_out of Vietnam transformed -- as his family quickly noticed . Haunted by his friendship with a 12-year-old Vietnamese boy , Baker once went_home on_leave to find his children ' s bikes unused because they had flat_tires . &quot; They were waiting for me to fix them . They would n ' t do_it themselves , &quot; he said . &quot; So I took all_the bikes down to the thrift shop . It wasn ' t fair to my own children . But I was living shoulder-to-shoulder with people struggling to survive . One of them was a little kid getting_up in the morning and working and then going_to school and coming_back to work . So the piling_up of possessions seemed irrelevant . I didn ' t want them to possess my family. &quot; He hasn ' t changed . When they leave Berlin , the Bakers have no home to return to in the United States . His wife , Joan , has put bids to buy much of the furniture in their Army-supplied home_in Berlin for &quot; whatever we end_up in wherever that turns_out to be. &quot; Since Vietnam , Baker has also never personally owned a gun . He concluded that there were different ways to wage and win a war . And firepower , he decided , had its limitations . Once again , it goes_back to Vann . &quot; Vann ' s idea was not to fight on a military basis . You had to offer people a better alternative , to show they could make government better without taking_up arms . So the idea was to rebuild a nation from the grass roots up . It was a beautiful concept , &quot; he said . After Vietnam , Baker ' s foreign postings reflected a determination to do right what Vann had failed to do_in Vietnam . Baker hasn ' t always succeeded . But he often made a difference . IN THE 1980S , AS THE MIDDLE_EAST REPLACED VIETNAM AS THE LEADING hot spot , Baker landed in Lebanon and found his life increasingly embroiled in the world ' s longest ongoing conflict . In 1981 , he was first assigned to work for the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization ( UNTSO ) , which monitored tension between Israel and its Arab neighbors . Baker headed UNTSO ' s mission in Lebanon -- at the time , the region ' s most explosive border . &quot; The chances of being killed randomly were incredibly high , &quot; Baker laughed . &quot; There wasn ' t just one war going_on . We were tracking 80-odd groups and trying to referee all their fights. &quot; Among them were Christian and Muslim rivals fighting a civil_war , Palestinian groups in and outside the PLO challenging Israel , and foreign-sponsored militias , from Kurds to Libyan surrogates , playing_out regional tensions . The mission , which forbade U.N. observers from carrying arms , was to get the PLO and pro-Israel militias to honor the latest of many truces since UNTSO went_to work in 1948 . Both militias were resisting deployment of U.N. observers to monitor their activities . To build relations with the PLO , Baker took his bedroll to a PLO guerrilla camp -- contact banned by U.S. law , but allowed while he worked for the United Nations . After a dinner of rice stew , he listened late into the night as they talked_about their cause and their lives . He then slept among them under the stars . Over time , he persuaded the PLO to let U.N. troops deploy at Beaufort Castle , the 12th-Century fort on the_hills leading to Israel . He then trekked across the front_line to the Christian militia , an Israeli surrogate force based as a buffer inside the Lebanese border . &quot; I told them it was a shame that they were losing business to the PLO , because the U.N. wives were shopping every Sunday in ( PLO-dominated ) Tyre , where they felt safe because of the U.N. presence . I told them I ' d like to throw some business their way , &quot; he said , chuckling at the memory of his guile . &quot; Well , there was nothing to buy there , but I brought the wives along and told them to buy whatever they could . They were dutiful and pulled_out $ 100 bills . Within two weeks we could drive wherever we wanted . The U.N. finally had access to the town , &quot; he added , chuckling again . The peacekeepers were thus deployed in the rivals ' two most strategic bases . Compared to progress on Mideast peace in the 1990s , Baker ' s achievements in the 1980s seem minor . Yet each marked a breakthrough . And not all who held the yearlong position were as successful . A predecessor was kidnaped by Palestinians . A successor , Lt . Col . William Richard Higgins , was abducted by Muslim extremists and died in captivity . &quot; Baker was able to do things that were almost impossible , that other people could only dream about , real miracles , &quot; said Herman Kafura , an American who served with Baker in UNTSO . &quot; He would talk to people and make_sense to them . They trusted him. &quot; In 1983 , Baker returned to Lebanon a second time , as chief of the Office of Military Cooperation , a so-called black_book post because of its sensitivity . His mandate was to revamp and retrain Lebanon ' s army as the basis for rebuilding the fractured state . But he arrived just three days before a suicide bomber drove into the U.S. Marine barracks , killing 241 . From then on , the U.S. presence was in retreat . Unprotected by the barricades or military backup afforded Marine peacekeepers , Baker quickly became the most exposed American soldier in Beirut . Within one 24-hour period in 1984 , his car and apartment were hit by militia rockets and artillery . When he was forced to camp_out on a cot at the Defense Ministry , an explosion then blew_out a wall of windows above his head . &quot; I remember looking in on him to see if he was hurt , &quot; said Alex Franco , chief of operations . &quot; The blanket over him , all_the furniture and the floor were completely covered with glass . Baker peeked out from under the blanket , looked_at me and said , deadpan , ' Next time I think I ' ll ask_for a room without a view. ' &quot; After the Marines finally sailed away in early 1984 , Baker and his crew , who operated independently , remained behind . When the second U.S. Embassy was blown_up that September , Baker was widely recognized as one of the heroes for rescuing the wounded and then operating a makeshift American mission . But by the end of 1984 , most of the key American players were gone . U.S. diplomacy had failed to bring Lebanon ' s warlords together ; the political chasm actually deepened , throwing the battered country into a new round of violence . Throughout those three years , the only partial U.S. success was the Lebanese Army , traditionally dominated by minority Christians . &quot; Baker understood what the policy types didn ' t : that he had to establish circumstances in which Christians and Muslims were equal , that he couldn ' t let them stall or argue about change . That new reality was supposed to create a new instrument for stability , &quot; said Robert d ' Entremont , Baker ' s second-in-command . Baker coaxed , cajoled and prodded Lebanon ' s foot_soldiers as well as their generals to coexist . After Beirut ' s Shiite areas became dangerous for Americans , he met with the army ' s Shiite leadership on their turf to discuss grievances . He then held the hands of nervous Christian generals , while pushing them to remove inequities toward Muslim troops , including uneven distribution of equipment . &quot; He was good at building coalitions among factions . Sometimes he did_it by sheer force of personality . He was always walking a tightrope , but somehow he made_it work , &quot; D ' Entremont said . Under U.S. direction , Lebanon ' s army brigades , once divided by religious affiliation , were integrated for the first time . The process was slow , and many Shiite Muslims split after warfare resumed . But then they laid_down their arms , refusing to fight other parts of the army -- leaving it to the militias . Before they left , more_than 50 Shiite officers individually contacted Baker to say they were still committed to a unified army , but that they couldn ' t turn their backs on Shiites under bombardment by a renegade Christian army_unit . Today , as Lebanon is finally at_peace , the seeds of that army program are again the basis for reconstruction . Before Baker left in late 1984 , the Lebanese president awarded him the Order of Cedars , one of the country ' s highest honors . As in Vietnam , Baker unexpectedly went_back a third time , in 1988 , as chief_of_staff of the Sinai Force , the multinational peacekeepers set_up by the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt . In his second black_book post , Baker finally got_to practice the theme increasingly running_through his life : how to get people to do things to overcome hatred and injustice by means other_than force . He made a deep impression . &quot; I will never forget when he invited me for a drive from Israel to Egypt . As we drove across the Sinai and later went horseback-riding among the pyramids , I learned more from him about the Middle_East in that short time than I could have in a university , &quot; said Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , now chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , under whom Baker served three times . &quot; He understood the smells and sounds of the region -- and the challenges and opportunities . Regrettably , guys like Al Baker don ' t come_around often . He ' s more in tune with today ' s challenges than half the generals walking around. &quot; BAKER ' S CAREER WILL END WHERE IT STARTED -- IN BERLIN . Shortly after the Wall went_up and the Berlin Brigade was formed in the early 1960s , Baker was a young lieutenant often assigned to patrol East Berlin . &quot; It was like looking_into day on one side and night on the other , like living_in sunshine while looking_into a storm , &quot; he recalled . &quot; As I drove_around , people would sometimes signal , ' Don ' t forget us. ' &quot; Now Berlin , Los Angeles ' sister city , is preparing again to be the capital of a unified Germany . A key step is removal of all foreign forces , including the historic Berlin Brigade . Since he returned as chief_of_staff in 1990 , Baker has orchestrated its dismantling -- an operation equivalent_to closing_down a city of 16 # 000 , including dispatching almost 7 # 000 troops , their dependents and local employees . He ' s also disposed_of or transferred $ 5 billion worth of property , from tanks to elementary_schools and hospitals , from 40 # 000 dining_room chairs to three libraries with 400 # 000 books . The job ends Sept . 7 , when the U.S. flag is taken_down from the old Nazi headquarters , a daily ritual known as the retreat . This ceremony is called the final retreat , after which all flags and references_to the Berlin Brigade will officially end . &quot; I take great pride in the fact we finished our mission here , that a threat is over and we are able to end an era , &quot; he reflected . &quot; But you have to be careful about having your dreams come true. &quot; He leaves Berlin without a job , facing an uncertain future . In some ways , it ' s an anticlimactic finish . &quot; This is an odd way to end my career . I ' m used to hot spots , &quot; Baker said . &quot; It ' s quieter than I would have liked. &quot; Yet in other ways , Berlin may be appropriate . During the past three decades , a U.S. account of the Berlin Brigade concludes : &quot; Probably no force of its size in history has contributed more to peace , stability and freedom in the world. &quot; Yet , it adds , &quot; the Berlin Brigade has never had to fire a shot in anger. &quot;</TEXT>
