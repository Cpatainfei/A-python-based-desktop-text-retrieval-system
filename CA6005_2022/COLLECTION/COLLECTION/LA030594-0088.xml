   <HEADLINE> THE IMPACT OF MORPHIN POWER ON KIDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was with grave concern that we recently read of the popularity of &quot; The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers &quot; and the naive , misleading views from TV executives that masqueraded as justifications for the program ( &quot; Morphin Mania : How -- and Why ? , &quot; Feb . 26 ) . The executives claimed that each show features a &quot; positive &quot; message , contains violence that is acceptable because it is clearly marked as fantasy , and offers children &quot; positive role models. &quot; A recent study we conducted on the &quot; Power Rangers &quot; is alarming in its demonstration that the show increases violent behavior in children . In our study , one group of children viewed an entire episode of &quot; Power Rangers &quot; and then were observed for several minutes playing with classmates . We also observed a control group of children who did not watch the episode . There was a frightening difference between the aggression levels of the two groups . Children -- especially boys -- who saw the program , displayed six times the number of aggressive acts_as children in the control group . Much of their aggression was a direct imitation of the program ' s action , such_as flying karate kicks . Parents may be interested in knowing that when we tallied the number of aggressive acts in the &quot; Power Rangers &quot; episode that we showed the children , there were about 140 aggressive acts in the 23-minute episode . Does the show offer positive messages or role_models for children ? Is the surfeit of violence understood by children as mere fantasy , not appropriate for the playground ? We offer a resounding &quot; no &quot; on all counts . The writers and producers have a long way to go before they can claim in good conscience that the show has these positive benefits for children . CHRIS J . BOYATZIS , Ph.D GINA MATILLO KRISTEN NESBITT Dept . of Child Development Cal State Fullerton * Why is the success of &quot; The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers &quot; such a mystery to anyone -- especially child psychologists , who spend years studying to understand children ? Any parent knows that kids crave this sort of stuff -- good_guys whomping bad_guys . The theme is very clear and reassuring . If only life were so ! Sometimes bad just has to be whomped . I think the &quot; Power Rangers &quot; is the most innocent , juvenile-appropriate program on TV today . What I resent is that mainstream cartoons have become adult-themed , as if the writers cannot land jobs with prime-time sitcoms , so they ' ve brought their brand of ( non ) humor to children ' s cartoons . They are peopled with disrespectful and rude characters , idiot adults and filled with innocuous sexual innuendo and sarcasm . These cartoons are too talky , too mean-spirited and confusing . Keep it simple , let kids be kids , and you see the results with a successful show such_as &quot; The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. &quot; MAUREEN HOWARD Arleta</TEXT>
