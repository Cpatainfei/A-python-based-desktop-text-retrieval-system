   <HEADLINE> O.C. LAB ' S DRUG STINGS YIELDED FEW JAIL TERMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most of the drug_users arrested by Santa Ana police_officers dealing county-made crack cocaine are not sent to jail even though the controversial stings are intended to make small-time buyers eligible for harsher punishments , authorities said Friday . Deputy Dist . Atty . Carl Armbrust acknowledged that a majority of the 350 people arrested during the past 18 months were first-time buyers and were assigned to drug diversion programs instead of receiving jail or prison_terms . The prosecutor also said that authorities involved in the so-called reverse sting operations are actually trying to build felony rap sheets against users who will eventually be eligible for prison sentences if they are arrested a second time . &quot; My personal feeling is that these drug treatment programs don ' t do a lot of good , &quot; said Armbrust , the prosecutor in_charge of the Narcotics Enforcement Team . &quot; If they don ' t get cured , chances are we are going_to get them again and then they go_to jail. &quot; But Orange County Public_Defender Ronald Y . Butler questioned whether the police_actions amount to entrapment . &quot; Since most of these people are first-time offenders , you have to wonder if they would be purchasing drugs at all if the police weren ' t out there enticing them , &quot; Butler said . &quot; I would seriously question the efficacy of their efforts . I think the motives are pure , but the means to the end seem to be really stretching it. &quot; Butler confirmed that many defendants are being referred to drug diversion programs instead of prison or jail -- an apparent shortcoming of the police tactics . Diversion allows people to avoid jail time if they successfully complete drug treatment programs that last six to eight weeks . Police counter that about one-third of those arrested were_on parole or probation for another offense when they bought drugs from undercover officers . * Armbrust and Santa Ana police officials defend the operations in which the Orange County Crime Laboratory has been manufacturing $ 10 and $ 20 pieces of rock cocaine for undercover officers to sell on the street . &quot; You can ' t measure the success of this program just by how many people end_up in jail , &quot; said Santa Ana Police Lt . Robert Helton . &quot; We also rely_on people in the neighborhoods to tell us whether things are getting better . I think we are seeing a significant degree of success here. &quot; Butler said his staff will file a legal_brief as early as Monday , contending that the manufacture of the highly addictive rock or crack cocaine amounts to &quot; outrageous government conduct. &quot; The public_defender ' s brief is being patterned after a similar legal objection filed_in Broward County , Fla. , where a state appeals court ruled that the county sheriff acted illegally in manufacturing rock cocaine for undercover drug investigations . The Florida ruling resulted in the reversal of hundreds of convictions obtained from reverse sting investigations . Reverse sting operations using real rock cocaine have been deemed legal by California courts . Deputy Public_Defender Kevin Phillips contends that the county lab ' s role in cooking the rock makes_it offensive enough to classify it as &quot; outrageous conduct. &quot; &quot; I haven ' t found any authority in statutes and case_law that permits them to do_it , &quot; Phillips said . &quot; As a matter_of_fact , the only thing I found was something that says it ' s illegal. &quot; Orange County Sheriff ' s Lt . Dan Martini issued a statement for the first time Friday about the county crime lab ' s role in the Santa Ana investigations and said the lab ' s staff converted about &quot; one cup &quot; of powder cocaine to rocks for police . Martini said Santa Ana police provided the drugs from the department ' s store of drug seizures involving cases that had already ended . Release of the drugs was approved by court_order signed by Orange County Superior_Court Judge Michael Brenner . Armbrust said the unconventional tactics are_well worth the effort . Arresting addicts or users in possession of real drugs makes them eligible for felony rather than misdemeanor prosecutions . Instead of adding_to a string of non-prison misdemeanors , the prosecutor said , they are able to wield &quot; the hammer &quot; of likely prison time on the second offense . &quot; I ' m happy with what we are doing , &quot; Armbrust said . The district_attorney ' s guidelines for the reverse stings state that officers are not supposed to solicit business and should sell only to people who ask_for drugs , court records show . The police stings generally have drawn approval this week from city and county officials who have described the Santa Ana operation as an example of aggressive police work . Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A . Pulido Jr . said Friday that he has heard only words of support from residents since details of the operation were disclosed . Police arrested most of the 350 defendants in the &quot; Weed and Seed &quot; area , a high-crime neighborhood where federal dollars have been spent to &quot; weed &quot; out crime . Other sales were made in the neighborhood near Willard Intermediate School . Friday , Pulido said some of the federal money helped to pay_for the controversial reverse sting operation . Citing concerns for the potential liabilities involved in manufacturing and dealing rock cocaine , many police agencies say they are hesitant to employ such methods . But others , now aware of the Santa Ana experience , are supportive of the technique . Los Angeles Police Capt . Bob Hansohn , who oversees street-level narcotics investigations , said the department never seriously considered small-time reverse sting operations . But he said Friday he is preparing a proposal for consideration by Chief Willie L . Williams that could put some of his officers on the street dealing much like the Santa Ana police . If needed , Hansohn said , Los Angeles police_officers could be supplied with rock cocaine manufactured by the Los Angeles County crime lab . &quot; If the conventional methods aren ' t working , I believe we have the obligation to look_at knocking_out the problem in other ways , &quot; Hansohn said . &quot; This proposal is just in the preliminary stages . ( Chief Williams ) may or may_not agree. &quot; Pasadena police have been selling street_drugs , rather than those cooked by police , during reverse stings for about eight years , Lt . Jerry Schultze said . In the court_order approving Santa Ana ' s program , the Orange County district_attorney ' s office cited two Pasadena cases in which state courts ruled that reverse stings were legal . The Inglewood Police_Department also has been selling rock cocaine undercover since 1988 , when it combined its program with a billboard campaign that warned : &quot; Behind that Rock Could be a Cop , &quot; Capt . Jim Seymour said . The police operations and billboard campaign helped earn the city All American City distinction in 1989 . And two years later , Gov . Pete Wilson appointed then-Police Chief Ray Johnson as director of the California Office of Criminal Justice Planning , lauding him for the reverse sting program . Unlike the Santa Ana program , Johnson said , the city has not lost any of the rock nuggets by having suspects swallow them . &quot; Some pop it in their mouths , but . . . we just gently massage the neck until they gag , &quot; Seymour said . The fact that the Orange County Crime Lab is cooking the rock cocaine should not make a difference , Seymour said . His department has always used rock cocaine confiscated in busts of sellers . &quot; The purpose is not for cops to emulate bad_guys , &quot; he said . &quot; I think Santa Ana is_on the right track . If rocking it up is causing the problem for Santa Ana , they can come_up and we ' ll give them whatever they need. &quot;</TEXT>
