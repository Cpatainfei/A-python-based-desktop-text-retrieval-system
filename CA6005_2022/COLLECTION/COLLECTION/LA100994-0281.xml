   <HEADLINE> CIA REPORTEDLY PAID MILLIONS TO JAPAN ' S LDP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The CIA supported the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , the conservative_party that dominated Japanese politics , with millions of dollars in a major Cold_War covert_operation during the 1950s and 1960s , the New York Times reported in today ' s editions . The Central_Intelligence_Agency gave money , at the request of the LDP , to make the country a bulwark against communism in Asia and undermine the Japanese left , the paper said , quoting former intelligence officials and diplomats from the United States and Japan . The CIA did not respond to the allegations about the Liberal Democrats , whose 38 years of one-party rule ended last year after a series of corruption cases . Thanks in part to the CIA funding , the LDP thwarted its Socialist opponents , held one-party rule , and fought_off public opposition to creating U.S. military bases in Japan , the Times said . The paper also cited U.S._government records from the 1960s , declassified in accordance with a law that opens records relating to foreign_policy after 30 years . &quot; The principle was certainly acceptable to me , &quot; the paper quoted U . Alexis Johnson , U.S. ambassador to Japan from 1966 to 1969 , as saying . &quot; We were financing a party on our side. &quot; The covert aid apparently ended in the early 1970s , the paper said , amid growing trade friction .</TEXT>
