   <HEADLINE> NEWS BITES : A NEW MOVEMENT : MILK ACTIVISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> People protest in favor of animal rights ; they protest against encroaching development . But last Sunday , approximately 30 anti-biotechnology activists introduced onlookers at the Los Angeles Farmers Market to a new cause of the moment : milk . The rally , sponsored by the Washington-based advocacy group Pure Food Campaign , was staged to protest food industry plans to use a controversial drug in dairy_cows that could increase milk production about 20 % . Beginning Feb . 4 , Monsanto Co. , the manufacturer of bovine somatotropin , or BST , can begin marketing and selling the product to commercial milk producers . The U . S . Food and Drug Administration approved the use of BST late last year after determining that products derived from the drug are safe for human consumption . For instance , the FDA found that milk from BST-treated cows has the same nutritional value and chemical composition as milk from untreated cows . As a result , the agency decided that no special labeling is required on products developed from animals treated with the drug . Critics of BST say the drug will cause udder inflammation , or mastitis , in treated cows . To forestall any such infection , dairy_farmers may increase the amount of antibiotics given to animals ; it ' s feared that this will lead to a corresponding rise in the level of antibiotics in milk for human consumption . But FDA and Monsanto both claim that sufficient safeguards exist to discover any unsafe drug residues in milk . Despite Sunday ' s small turnout , the Pure Food Campaign has had some success locally in thwarting BST . Last November , the Los Angeles City Board_of_Education passed a resolution that prohibits for one year the distribution of BST-treated milk or other dairy_products in local schools . Pure Food Campaign is now asking the Los Angeles City_Council and the L . A . County Board of Supervisors to consider similar resolutions . Failing a sales moratorium , the Pure Food Campaign will ask the council and supervisors to order that BST-treated milk carry appropriate labeling . Danila Oder , Los Angeles area coordinator for the Pure Food Campaign , says that a big goal for the group is educating the public . Sunday ' s rally , she says , &quot; was a good jumping-off_point for future activities. &quot; The anti-biotechnocrats may now be just a fringe group , but they could eventually pose serious problems for genetic_engineering pioneers , much the way activists have stalled food irradiation .
