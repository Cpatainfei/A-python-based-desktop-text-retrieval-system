   <HEADLINE> ' NYPD BLUE ' S ' CARUSO LEAVES A SURE THING ON TV FOR . . . ? ; TELEVISION : THE BIAS OF TIERED STATUS FOR FILM AND TV ACTORS IS BREAKING_DOWN . THE REAL ISSUE IS MATERIAL . WHETHER DAVID CARUSO FINDS IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When David Caruso returned this week in the season premiere of &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; there was a quick , vivid reminder of the big gamble he ' s taking_in leaving the hit drama series to shoot_for motion_picture stardom . The ratings for the premiere of the ABC cop drama were potent . Caruso , despite his upfront movie money , could easily have had a sure-thing annuity by sticking_out the run of the series . Instead , he ' s departing after the show ' s first four episodes , to be replaced by Jimmy Smits . Once again , the siren call of the movies has lured a successful TV_star into films . It was not so_long ago , for instance , that Bruce Willis , who came_to fame as David Addison in TV ' s &quot; Moonlighting , &quot; turned_to the big screen in a gamble that paid_off -- as witness his new movie &quot; Pulp Fiction. &quot; Another onetime TV_star in &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; of course , is John Travolta , who first really drew attention as the character Vinnie Barbarino in the series &quot; Welcome Back , Kotter. &quot; And , hey , isn ' t that huge movie_star Tom Hanks , now headlining the film &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; the same guy we remember from the television comedy series &quot; Bosom Buddies &quot; ? When folks like Hanks and Willis make_it big-time in the movies , you can bet it has an impact on budding TV actors . The money can be enormous , and there is still snobbery in certain motion_picture quarters toward the folks in television . The truth is , of course , there can be tremendous money in TV as well . Producer Aaron Spelling , who is primarily identified with TV , can buy and sell most movie producers in town . As another example , &quot; The Cosby Show &quot; earned more_than $ 500 million on just its initial rerun cycle in syndication . Yet the snobbery is still there , but it ' s not as pronounced as it used to be . Steven Spielberg ' s company has a piece of the new NBC medical series smash , &quot; ER , &quot; and also produces two other weekly dramas on the network . With good dramatic parts not always in strong supply in films , serious actors such_as Sam Waterston have no qualms about going_to TV or wherever they can find them . Example : Waterston , who has starred in such films as &quot; The Killing Fields , &quot; became a regular this season on NBC ' s &quot; Law &amp; Order. &quot; And not long ago , he headlined another admired NBC series , &quot; I ' ll Fly Away. &quot; The general rule_of_thumb in TV ' s early days , when most home-screen stars were definitely regarded_as second-rung personalities compared to their film counterparts , was to get_out of a weekly series fast if you wanted to avoid being strongly identified with the tube . The late 1950s offered an excellent example , when an array of young TV_stars who would go_on to become major film personalities had their own weekly series : Steve McQueen played a bounty hunter in the Western &quot; Wanted : Dead or Alive , &quot; Lee Marvin was a cop in &quot; M Squad &quot; and Charles Bronson portrayed a photographer in &quot; Man With a Camera. &quot; None of their series were_on very long . But just to show that the movies ' attitude toward TV_stars was shortsighted and that talent eventually would out , there was another young comer who ran_for seven years , from 1959 to 1966 , in a TV Western . The series was called &quot; Rawhide , &quot; and the actor was Clint Eastwood . Eastwood , of course , made a real impression on TV . But only truly dedicated couch potatoes may recall that for one season , from 1959 to 1960 , the sitcom &quot; The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis &quot; featured another young comer named Warren Beatty . If you want to prepare_for &quot; Jeopardy ! , &quot; just remember that the character he played was Milton Armitage . The snobbery has also been reduced by some_other pro-television turns . Once upon a time , TV_stars were often cast as second leads in movies , as studios figured their fans would simply add_to box-office returns . But as the recent spate of films based on old TV_shows -- &quot; The Addams Family , &quot; &quot; The Beverly Hillbillies &quot; -- has illustrated , the movie_industry now has been taken_over by the television generation , which is less hostile to the tube . Nowadays , we have Ted Danson of &quot; Cheers &quot; as a movie idol . And Dana Delany of &quot; China Beach &quot; and Dan Aykroyd of &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; are starring in the film &quot; Exit to Eden. &quot; The &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; cast broke_through the film barrier like no other group in TV history , with such performers as Bill Murray , Eddie Murphy , Aykroyd and John Belushi going_on to movie fame . Caruso , who reportedly wanted a hefty raise after just one season to remain with &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; -- and was rejected by producer Steven Bochco -- is still a question_mark when it comes_to major film stardom . But TV , it turns_out , can still be a return haven for some headliners whose movie careers are not exactly skyrocketing . This season alone , for instance , Dudley Moore , Martin Short and Gene Wilder have network sitcoms . None has done very well in the ratings -- a reminder that movie stardom rarely counts for much on television , which generally creates its own icons , such_as Alan Alda in &quot; MASH. &quot; One notable exception , of course , is Candice Bergen , who came_to TV after such films as &quot; Carnal Knowledge &quot; and &quot; Rich and Famous &quot; and struck it rich_in &quot; Murphy Brown. &quot; Another movie name , karate whiz Chuck Norris of the &quot; Delta Force &quot; films , is doing fine in the ratings in &quot; Walker , Texas Ranger. &quot; Caruso may , of course , return to TV some day in one of the various common forms -- on all fours , hoping for acceptance again , or as a movie_star who wisely has no prejudice about accepting good roles wherever they are , the way Holly Hunter does . Stars like Dean Martin , who had an NBC variety series as well as a movie career , helped dilute the snobbery attached_to shuttling between the big and small screens . Angela Lansbury , one of the grand performers of stage and screen , also made_it perfectly respectable to move_on to TV , in &quot; Murder , She Wrote. &quot; And in the 1970s and ' 80s , when TV was often turning_out the kind of important social dramas that movies had abandoned in their pursuit of the teen-age audience , performers such_as Vanessa Redgrave -- who appeared in notable home-screen films like &quot; Playing for Time &quot; -- often gave the tube the upper_hand and added immeasurably to its respectability for serious artists . Caruso is leaving a great series for a question_mark . Nothing is certain in Hollywood . Roseanne is big in &quot; Roseanne &quot; but hasn ' t had much impact in films ; on the other hand , her co-star on TV , John Goodman , has made_it in motion_pictures . And Rob Morrow of &quot; Northern Exposure &quot; is in a movie hit , &quot; Quiz Show. &quot; The smartest actors just keep looking_for the bread_and_butter . Dabney Coleman , once a hit in such motion_pictures as &quot; 9 to 5 , &quot; has become a cult TV personality ( &quot; Buffalo Bill &quot; ) and now seems to have a winner , &quot; Madman of the People , &quot; because it follows &quot; Seinfeld. &quot; Dick Van Dyke , a TV legend , has had a movie and stage career and now is back on the tube in &quot; Diagnosis Murder. &quot; John Ritter has also made the show-biz rounds and has returned to TV in &quot; Hearts Afire. &quot; The great actress Cicely Tyson is also back on TV in &quot; Sweet Justice. &quot; There is no best medium . There is only good material . Bette Midler proved it again by bringing &quot; Gypsy &quot; to TV . And now Caruso , who left a good thing in &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; can only hope that he finds something better .</TEXT>
