   <TEXT> A sleek , needle-nosed jetliner carrying 300 passengers taxis out of Los Angeles International Airport , rolls to a hushed takeoff over Playa del Rey then accelerates above the Pacific_Ocean like no commercial plane in history -- reaching 2.4 times the speed of sound nearly 12 miles above the earth . The titanium airplane with a cockpit that looks_like a video arcade pulls into Tokyo in just over four hours -- cutting six hours off the normal trip . Getting_to Asia from L.A. is no more of a hassle than a hop to Chicago . Jet-lagged international travelers have been anticipating such an airplane for 20 years , since Congress halted development of a first-generation supersonic jetliner and Europe produced the rival Concorde -- an economic flop . Advances in technology have raised hopes in the Clinton_Administration that the longstanding economic and environmental problems with supersonic jets can be overcome -- if the government puts_in the seed money . Without much fanfare given the stakes , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is poised to issue a $ 1.5-billion contract_in the coming weeks to a consortium of every major U.S. commercial airplane and jet_engine company for an ambitious research program leading to a supersonic jet in regular service by 2005 . NASA hopes Americans would dominate the effort , though it would likely include foreign suppliers and investors . It ' s the sort of colossal industrial project that would require enormous investments , carry huge technical risks and raise potentially serious environmental concerns . Some experts claim NASA is too optimistic about its ability to solve the environmental concerns . And the airlines , reeling from traumatic financial_losses , have voiced little enthusiasm for buying new planes , particularly ones a decade away . But there is a huge potential payoff if the skeptics are wrong and the plane fulfills its promise of being far more fuel-efficient than the Concorde and if it can fly without fouling the atmosphere . Indeed , NASA touts the program as the most important industrial project in the nation ' s future and says it is a key to halting the erosion of American dominance of the world aircraft industry . At stake is a potential $ 200 billion in_orders for 500 to 1 # 000 of the supersonic aircraft that would support roughly 140 # 000 manufacturing jobs in such areas as Southern California and Seattle , said Wesley Harris , NASA ' s aeronautics chief . &quot; We have growing confidence that this plane will be built by 2005 by either the U.S. or the Europeans , &quot; he said . &quot; Who will build it ? U.S. companies must be in the driver ' s seat. &quot; The strong advocacy reflects a changed attitude at NASA , which for decades has sponsored aircraft research that often helped foreign competitors as much as Americans and often engaged in academic research with little commercial value . Since the Apollo moon missions , NASA ' s commitment to aeronautics has withered . Director Daniel S . Goldin now wants to put more emphasis on helping the U.S. aircraft industry , drawing strong support from Congress . Last year , lawmakers gave the supersonic program $ 10 million more_than the $ 187 million requested by NASA . &quot; We have underfunded aviation research and we need to make substantial investments in this area , &quot; said Rep . George Brown ( D-Colton ) , chairman of the House Science , Space and Technology Committee . &quot; This program is a good thing for the nation to do. &quot; Under the new supersonic program , known as the High Speed Civil Transport , NASA will play a central role in organizing the efforts of major U.S. aerospace firms and making the key decisions in the next four years about which technologies will be used . For the first time , the archrivals of the commercial aircraft industry will be partners under NASA ' s direction : Boeing and McDonnell Douglas for the jet ' s airframe and General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney for the engines . By pooling America ' s best talents , NASA hopes to make the major breakthroughs needed to make a supersonic jetliner economically viable . That task alone is daunting . The program to develop the aircraft , including the detailed engineering of millions of parts and the building of thousands of production tools , would require a private-sector investment of $ 15 billion -- more_than double the cost of past jetliner developments . Even if high sales volume defrayed the investment expense , the planes would cost $ 180 million to $ 300 million each . ( A Boeing 747 today costs roughly $ 150 million. ) Proponents argue that the high price would be offset by the aircraft ' s ability to make two trips for every one that a subsonic plane makes . As a result , fares would be no more_than 20 % higher than current tickets , Boeing and McDonnell Douglas engineers say . &quot; It would make this an airplane for everybody , not just high-paying passengers , &quot; said Bruce Bunin , McDonnell ' s manager for the program in Long_Beach . Keeping costs low will also require that the plane be highly fuel-efficient , meaning its structure must be very lightweight , engines must be highly economical and aerodynamic drag must be at a minimum . Because U.S. law prohibits commercial planes creating sonic_booms over land , the jets would fly supersonically only above the ocean . A failing of the 100-passenger Concorde has been its gross inefficiency in flying subsonically , an area where the new plane must excel . After Congress forbid supersonic flights over land in the 1970s , the market for Concordes collapsed ; fewer than 30 were built . Unlike the Concorde , the new jet would have flaps and slats that would change the shape of the wing depending_on the plane ' s speed , allowing it to fly nearly as efficiently as today ' s jetliners . But even if the plane can do all this , it is not clear that airlines will rush to buy_it . U.S. airlines have collectively lost $ 12 billion in four years , and their enthusiasm for costly new planes seems tepid at best . American Airlines spokesman Al Becker said the supersonic jet carries high risk and may be too specialized for the flexible fleet his company wants . &quot; This is an industry that is struggling desperately for survival , &quot; he said . &quot; We are in no position to be thinking_about buying large_numbers of $ 200-million airplanes . Where are we going_to raise that kind of money ? &quot; Instead of a supersonic jet , airlines may opt_for a proposed 600-passenger super-jumbo plane that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are studying . It would involve much less technical risk and may be more adaptable to different routes . The Air Transport Assn. , the trade group representing U.S. airlines , has not considered the supersonic jet as a priority , a spokesman said . And the program is not even mentioned in McDonnell ' s or Boeing ' s 1993 shareholder reports . NASA officials , however , believe any reservations about the supersonic planes are myopic . Just build the plane and &quot; the market will be there , &quot; claims Louis J . Williams , director of the supersonic program at NASA . Commercial air_travel is growing at 8 % to 10 % per year , he said , and international travel growth is paralleling the explosion in international trade . Weary business_travelers would flock to a supersonic plane that promises to reduce jet_lag . If executives can get_to Tokyo or Paris , conduct business and board a return flight on the same day , they may never have to adjust to a different time_zone . &quot; From the traveling public ' s perception , I am not sure we have done much for them in the past 20 years , &quot; said Sam Gilkey , head of GE ' s effort to develop a supersonic engine . &quot; This plane offers more to the public than a 600-seat plane you hear so_much about. &quot; Still , even in an industry where firms bet their survival on each new product , the supersonic plane carries unique risks . It will require entirely new high-technology materials , computerized jet_engine controls and even new research into human behavior . For example , when pilots land the jet , instead of looking_out the window , they would rely_on &quot; synthetic vision &quot; that would resemble a video_game screen . It would be the first time that pilots could not directly see the runway , because the cockpit in a supersonic jet is angled up so sharply . In the Concorde , the cockpit is mounted on hinges and tilts down at landing to allow the pilots to see , but the design imposes a big weight and drag penalty . The technical hurdles are so great that &quot; we don ' t know yet whether there is a viable commercial program out there , &quot; Boeing program manager Mike Henderson admits . &quot; It is a research program right now. &quot; Nonetheless , the prospects appear better than in 1971 , when in a titanic political battle Congress voted to kill the supersonic program , overriding the unusual alliance of President Richard Nixon , labor boss George Meany and the aerospace industry . The decision was based largely on environmental concerns -- the same issue that haunts today ' s effort . NASA and industry officials believe they have licked a longstanding concern that a fleet of supersonic commercial jets flying through the stratosphere would seriously degrade the ozone . In recent years , NASA has invested $ 500 million into research on supersonic jet_engines that would cut pollution by controlling combustion and fuel air mixture . NASA ' s aims to reduce nitrogen_oxide emissions eightfold , compared to existing engines , which emit five grams of nitrogen_oxide for each kilogram of fuel burned . A NASA-funded study has estimated that the supersonic fleet would cause the loss of 1 % of the ozone_layer , a_level that NASA officials believe will be politically acceptable . But some environmentalists differ sharply . Michael Oppenheimer , an atmospheric physicist with the Environmental Defense Fund and a participant in the NASA studies , suggests the study was far too uncertain to accurately predict a 1 % loss . He added , however , that even a 1 % erosion is too_much given damage already done to the ozone . Because about 5 % of the ozone over North_America has already been lost to pollution , another 1 % would allow even higher concentrations of ultraviolet_radiation , raising skin_cancer rates , he said . &quot; Is Joe Six Pack going_to be willing to suffer an increased dose of ultraviolet_radiation so some jet-setters can fly to Japan quicker ? &quot; he asked . &quot; I am skeptical. &quot; But a recent independent report by the National Research Council generally praised NASA ' s efforts to address environmental concerns . Thomas E . Graedel , the study ' s chairman and a Bell Labs scientist , told Congress in February that he could see no environmental issues that would preclude the operation of a supersonic jet . Two other environmental issues also loom large . A fleet of jets -- traveling at Mach 2.4 , or about 1 # 600 m.p.h. -- would cause sonic_booms over thousands of square_miles of ocean each day , subjecting marine life to &quot; repetitive sonic trauma , &quot; a scientist on the House Space , Science and Technology Committee noted . The impact is unknown , though NASA experts consider it relatively minor . Another concern is the potential for the jets to change weather patterns , according to the National Research Council report . The fleet could affect water_vapor and cloud formations , it suggested . ( Military jets routinely fly supersonically , but they limit their booms to military air spaces and they can fly supersonically only briefly at altitudes lower than the proposed commercial plane , thus limiting environmental impact. ) Oppenheimer said the program will make economic sense only when the environmental issues are resolved . He compares the proposed jets to nuclear_power plants , in which the government encouraged electric utilities to spend billions on a technology the public ultimately rejected on environmental grounds . But aviation has always had unique public support . It occupies a special place in American history and plays a key role in the U.S. economy . Commercial aircraft are America ' s leading export . A decade ago , American aircraft makers held 90 % of the world market for large jetliners , according to Harris of NASA ; today it ' s 70 % . Despite the threat of foreign competition , a U.S. program is almost certain to have suppliers and investors in Europe and Japan -- much like the newly introduced Boeing 777 jetliner . Neither Boeing nor McDonnell have the financial capability alone for a $ 15-billion development program . Boeing and McDonnell are part of an international group studying the economics and marketing of a supersonic jet . While U.S. technology looks superior , the 20 years of Concorde have given Europeans important insights . At issue is whether the NASA research program will give the United States the dominant technological position internationally . With the lead role , U.S. industry would then be in a position to decide when to launch production of the jet . &quot; I believe it is the most critical manufacturing decision this country will make in the next 10 years , &quot; Harris said . New Technologies Required for Building Supersonic Jet The new supersonic jetliner sponsored by a $ 1.5-billion NASA research contract would require major breakthroughs in aircraft technology . Among them : * Aerodynamic drag must be cut_to an absolute minimum . One technique involves a radical new design in which massive pumps would suck turbulent air off the skin of the wings through millions of microscopic holes . The so-called laminar_flow over the wings would be virtually free_of turbulence , cutting the drag . * The 311-foot-long jet must be so light that its structure would probably be built_in large part_with thin sheets of titanium , held together through an exotic process called super plastic diffusion bonding . * Engines that power supersonic jets are notoriously noisy , but the new planes would have to keep quiet if they want a chance at wide acceptance . A new design for the exhaust nozzles is expected to allow the plane to meet existing airport noise standards . * Inside the engines , the combustion chamber , or &quot; combustors , &quot; would operate at 3 # 600 degrees , hot enough to melt existing steel alloys and about 700 degrees hotter than existing engines . NASA is betting that a new fiber-reinforced ceramic composite liner would stand_up to the heat . * To prevent severe environmental damage , the engines must emit no more_than five grams of nitrogen_oxide for each kilogram of fuel burned . One proposed system would mix fuel and air in the engine upstream from the normal burning zone , allowing the lean fuel mix to vaporize better . The other proposed system would create a stratified fuel mixture , first injecting excess fuel and then adding air later in the combustion to create a lean stage -- a concept called rich burn-quick quench-lean burn . * NASA is still hoping to find ways to reduce the sonic_boom generated by the jet as it flies over the ocean . A boom , which is the acoustic shock_wave trailing an aircraft , is a function of an aircraft ' s mass , shape and its speed . Although cutting the boom is possible , it must be done without significantly hampering flight efficiency .</TEXT>
