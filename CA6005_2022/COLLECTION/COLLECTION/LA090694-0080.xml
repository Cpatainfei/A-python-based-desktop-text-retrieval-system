   <HEADLINE> MEETINGS PRODUCE BIG TALK , BUT LITTLE ACTION ; OLYMPICS : THE CENTENNIAL CONGRESS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A THINK_TANK OF NEW IDEAS . INSTEAD , IT BECAME A SERIES OF SPEECHES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Turn_out the lights in the City_of_Lights , the $ 16-million birthday_party is over . Also known as the Olympic Centennial Congress , it was conceived as a high-minded think_tank that would bring_together not only international and national Olympic officials but also academicians , historians , journalists , sponsors , marketing mavens and , yes , even athletes to discuss and debate their roles at the start of the Olympic movement ' s second century . Come_together they did last week in the underground halls of a charmless convention center_on the city ' s outskirts , more_than 3 # 000 strong to hear 430 three-minute speeches over a five-day period on every subject from ambush marketing to the ambush of Nancy Kerrigan . But as for discussions and debate , there was little of that as speakers were herded to and from the stage as if they were all winners of less prestigious Oscars at the Academy Awards . John MacAloon , a respected Olympic historian and University of Chicago sociology professor , fumed at the lack of opportunity for formal give_and_take at the end of sessions , as is usually a feature of academic conferences . &quot; I thought the Berlin Wall had come_down , &quot; he said . Even informal exchanges in the lobby subsided after it was discovered that Olympia , a metallic green robot that wandered the halls , had super sensitive hearing powers . When one observer practically whispered to another that Olympia must have set the organizers back about $ 200 # 000 , the robot , standing about a football_field away , turned and said , in perfect English , &quot; that ' s a lot of money ! &quot; All of this occurred to the delight of International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain , who declared that the theme of the Congress would be unity and then gave no one a chance to disagree . That assured that the theme of the Congress for reporters would be boredom , which hardly distressed Samaranch . About to step onto an escalator one afternoon , he spotted an Associated Press reporter in the lobby out of the corner of his eye and abruptly turned_on his heels to go speak_to him . &quot; No headlines , &quot; Samaranch said , his eyes twinkling . He liked that thought so_much that , in his closing speech Saturday , he said , &quot; Good news is no news. &quot; Most of his deputies were eager to accommodate him . In the opening speech of the first morning session , IOC Vice-President Kevan Gosper of Australia said the movement needed the courage to eliminate sports from the Olympics that are no longer popular or modern , the courage to assure that professional athletes competing in the Olympics in increasing number are true lovers of sport and not merely gladiators , the courage to insist upon the continuing participation of athletes from developing nations and the courage to open stadiums to the common_man instead of reserving all_the seats for corporate sponsors and VIPs . But then Gosper , fearing that he had been too blunt , went_to the press room to inform reporters that he was merely tossing_out some suggestions , that he was not sure when or even whether the IOC should act_upon them and that what really bothers him is &quot; extravagant , unrelated &quot; entertainment at sporting events . He was unable to describe what he was talking_about , but he presumably knows it when he sees it . After that performance , some of his IOC colleagues began sarcastically referring to him as &quot; Captain Courageous. &quot; But if speakers were somewhat circumspect because they were concerned that their words might come_back to haunt them , who could blame them ? At the most recent Congress in 1981 , one conclusion of the final statement ' s drafters was that there was &quot; no place in the Olympic Games for professional or open competition. &quot; Eleven years later , the Dream Team pretty much ended that notion forever . So it was time for a new Congress , the 12th in 100 years , and Paris certainly seemed to be the place because that is where a French baron , Pierre de Coubertin , convened the first meeting of the IOC in 1894 . Participants were jolted when they arrived by a retrospective in the Saturday magazine of a French sports newspaper , L ' Equipe , that described de Coubertin as racist , misogynist and anti-Semitic , and , although the writer ultimately concluded that the baron was OK for his time , many speakers in this politically correct age rushed_off to delete , or at least soften , their references_to him . All they had to do was change their focus from de Coubertin to Samaranch because the movement today is much more reflective of the Spanish banker ' s vision than that of de Coubertin . In an interview before the Congress , Samaranch proudly detailed some of his accomplishments in 14 years as president : the election of women to the IOC , including two executive board_members ; the creation of an athletes ' commission ; the opening of the Games to professionals ; the development of a fund for athletes from emerging nations ; the intensification of the fight against drugs and racial discrimination ; the establishment of a court of arbitration for disputes between athletes and federations ; the schedule change that placed the Winter and Summer Olympics in different years ; the construction of new IOC facilities , including an Olympic museum , and the significant improvement in the IOC ' s finances . If all Samaranch , who will retire in 1997 , wanted to do was call a Congress to celebrate his reign as president , few would have argued . But Samaranch promised much more , including open discussion that would result in a program , particularly for the Summer Olympics , that included primarily sports that are popular today . Some , he said , would have to go . Instead , all_the IOC did was add two sports , triathlon and taekwondo , for the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney , Australia . Evolution , not revolution , said IOC member Jacques Rogge of Belgium . Not all IOC members were satisfied with that philosophy . &quot; You might have to speculate that if the IOC doesn ' t eliminate anything and adds two more sports , who ' s going_to take it seriously ? &quot; said Richard Pound , an executive board_member from Canada . Yet , the IOC did score some points for its overdue recognition of athletes as forces within the movement . Donna de Varona , a gold medalist swimmer from the United States , said that when she attended her first Congress in 1973 , the credential was literally ripped from her neck by an IOC official because she applied for it through the organizing committee instead of the IOC . De Varona was one of many current and former athletes to participate last week . In fact , she was asked to present two speeches . Afterward , the IOC seemed poised to give athletes more of a voice , if for no other reason , as Rogge explained , to prevent a situation in the future like the United States has now with its baseball strike . Pleased to have been heard , de Varona said that a Congress is necessary &quot; so that a large_number of people from throughout the world can gather periodically to share their thoughts on the Olympic movement. &quot; But , like many others , she said that she was offended by the $ 16-million price_tag . With little else to report daily , reporters fixed on that figure . IOC officials were sensitive about it , choosing an alternate site for their grand gala in fear that the first choice , the Palace of Versailles , would inspire Marie Antoinette and &quot; let them eat cake &quot; references . They also scurried to explain that they were contributing only $ 6 million , while the rest came from the_French and Parisian governments , perhaps as a down_payment on Paris ' proposed bid for the Summer Olympics of either 2004 or ' 08 . Still , the IOC , which boasts of the financial assistance it has given to athletes such_as world champion runner Maria Mutola of Mozambique , should consider that $ 6 million would finance training for a lot of athletes for a lot of years . Besides , it is possible that reflection upon the Olympic movement is , like prayer , best done_in private .</TEXT>
