   <HEADLINE> THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET ; CAREER MAKE-OVERS : CHARTING NEW PATHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We asked readers to send_in their resumes and share their career dreams . Eight readers were referred to job counselors , who told them how to achieve those dreams . Here ' s what they were told . Margaret Kono Age : 33 Education : BA in economics , UCLA ; MBA , Pepperdine University Experience : 1983-90 , account clerk and senior subcontract administrator at TRW Present job : Housewife and mother Dream job : Editor of children ' s and women ' s books Quote : &quot; I let myself be brainwashed into believing that a business degree was a savior even though it was evident from first_grade that my aptitude was literary. &quot; Expert ' s advice : From Susan Miller , Los Angeles career counselor : As a re-entry worker , you should confirm your interest in book publishing by learning more about that industry and taking personality tests to determine if you are truly suited to it . The extension program at the University of California at Irvine offers career testing through its Women ' s Opportunities Center . You might also want to attend ' Writing for Children ' s Books , ' a one-day program offered at least twice a year by the UC Irvine Extension Writing Program . You can also learn more about publishing by reading ' Getting Into Book Publishing , ' a free booklet from the Assn . of American Publishers , 220 E . 23rd St. , 2nd Floor , New York , NY 10010 . The pamphlet describes what publishers want in job_candidates and the range of jobs available . It also lists programs , courses and degree_programs related to publishing . To identify local book publishers aiming at the children ' s or women ' s market , consult the California Publishing Marketplace , available through Writers Connection , 1610 Blossom Hill Road , San Jose , CA 95124 ( $ 11.65 , including tax , postage and handling ) . Finally , you might want to gain writing and editing experience by volunteering as a newsletter editor for a local children ' s or women ' s group in your community . Richard Bremmer Age : 40 Education : BA in industrial arts from California State University , Long_Beach ; MBA , Pepperdine University ; paralegal certificate from University of West Los Angeles Experience : 1978-90 , manufacturing planning and proposal pricing for aerospace companies , most recently McDonnell Douglas ; since being laid_off in 1990 , bookkeeper and security_guard Present job : Airport shuttle driver Dream job : Job estimator and contract negotiator for manufacturing company Quote : &quot; I thought I had a career in aerospace , and I never thought I ' d have to look elsewhere . I brought myself up in aerospace from the bottom . It ' s hard to get_back in on the career ladder. &quot; Expert ' s advice : From Judith Sommerstein , a Torrance career consultant : Due_to the length of time you have been away from your profession , I recommend exploring other careers beyond that of cost estimator for a manufacturer . Broaden your search to include such potential employers as government_agencies , environmental concerns and construction and health_care operators . Information about cost estimating in government and manufacturing sectors is available from the Society of Cost Estimating and Analysis in Alexandria , Va . You should also consider looking in related career fields , including contract administrator , technical writer , proposal writer , operations manager , appraiser , management analyst or quality_control manager . You should also develop a resume that emphasizes your skills and a one-page marketing_letter focusing_on the industry and job you are seeking . As a former aerospace worker , the jargon used in your previous work may_not be relevant to the positions you may be seeking . Send your resume to the head of the department you are interested in and bypass the personnel_department . Check_in professional journals and trade newsletters for job opening advertisements . Another excellent resource is the book ' How to Get a Job in Southern California ' by Thomas M . Camden and Jonathan Palmer , published by Surrey Books . Judy Harrison Age : 48 Education : High_school graduate with course work_at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College , Los Angeles City College and National Education Center Experience : 1968-90 , secretary , receptionist , public relations and symposium coordinator positions Present job : Receiving stress-related workers ' compensation payments Dream job : Public relations coordinator Quote : &quot; I ' m looking_for a job that would allow me to be creative . I ' m a_people person and enjoy working_on projects. &quot; Expert ' s advice : From Walter Brown of the UCLA Placement and Career Planning Center : Most of us bring_to the job market two distinct sets of skills : our acquired expertise and what we are temperamentally suited for . The strongest job_candidate is one whose personality complements his or her expertise . You have over eight years as an event coordinator , and you have developed strengths as a flexible , enterprising , self-starter . There should be any number of organizations crying_out_for your help . Concentrate_on large , civic , community and cultural nonprofit organizations , as well as social and fraternal groups . Potential employers include professional_associations , colleges and universities , labor_unions , political_campaigns and conference management firms . Professions with continuing education requirements often have training coordinators whose job it is to contact speakers , arrange for sites and promote the event . Your age should not be a negative factor . The field you have chosen requires interaction with people in your age_group who often feel more confident dealing with an age peer than someone who hasn ' t ' been there. ' Don ' t be bogged down by your age ; if you don ' t think_about it , chances are no one else will either . Thomas LaRoche Age : 27 Education : BA in psychology and economics , University of California , Irvine Experience : 1985 to present , staff trainer , billing clerk , insurance_claim representative , office manager Present job : Part-time bank teller Dream job : Stockbroker Quote : &quot; I do not just want a ' job. ' I want a career . Therefore , I continue to work while seeking my dream job. &quot; Expert ' s advice : From Walter Brown of the UCLA Placement and Career Planning Center : To become a stockbroker , you generally need a college degree . Then you must pass the Securities and Exchange Commission ' s certification examination to get your broker ' s license . Most recent college grads start_out at a big stock brokerage_firm , where they establish themselves and learn the ropes . Larger brokerage_firms , including all_the national companies and many regional ones , offer structured apprentice programs to train new recruits on the ins and outs of the brokerage business . These programs also offer help in passing the SEC exam . But smaller firms can offer you the opportunity to find a dedicated , knowledgeable mentor who can also give you the apprentice training you will need . You might also want to consider a career as a product manager with a manufacturer or large service organization . It is the product manager ' s job to figure_out how best to market each new market entry . And this job offers a wide range of responsibilities , including analyzing mounds of statistical data on consumer preferences and running focus groups . Other strong career possibilities for you include financial planning and corporate management of inventory_control , logistics and customer relations . Boon Chua Age : 56 Education : BA in business economics from Nebraska Wesleyan ; MA in political_science , San Diego State University ; postgraduate studies in counseling and education at USC Experience : 1967 to present , elementary_school teacher , middle-school counselor and high_school administrator Present job : Los Angeles Unified School District high_school counselor Dream job : Sales and marketing representative in Asia for American manufacturer Quote : &quot; I speak and write Chinese Mandarin , Indonesian , Malaysian and Fulkien dialect . I would n ' t mind being relocated in Asia. &quot; Expert ' s advice : From David Lazzara , an Orange County career consultant : The major challenge you face as you attempt to move_into the burgeoning Pacific Rim business arena will be your perception among employers as a career educator . To correct this , you must be able to show prospective employers you have the abilities they need by positioning yourself as an executive with corporate skills . Reinterpret your background to highlight your achievements in the areas of administration , operations and finance . Focus_on how you conceived and implemented various programs . Highlight how you successfully ' sold ' your school administration and students on the merits of your programs and then showcase the programs ' positive results . You should take this tack in preparing your resume and in all job interviews . To find companies that might be interested in your skills , check local libraries , trade associations , import-export seminars and business publications for potential contacts . In addition to providing leads about possible openings , personal contacts made during your research can often assist in evaluating your goals and skills , reviewing your resume and developing your interview technique . These contacts can also bolster your confidence . Diane Surak Age : 30 Education : BA in anthropology , Boston University Experience : 1985 to present , public relations coordinator , advertising account_executive and fund-raiser Present job : Development coordinator at Buena Vista Productions Dream job : Film development and production Quote : &quot; I accepted my current position to learn about television development and production . I spend half my day , however , scheduling and rescheduling appointments for my boss , including bikini waxes , pedicures , eyelash tints . . . . &quot; Expert ' s advice : From Linda Buzzell , director of the Entertainment_Industry Career Institute in Beverly Hills : Capitalize on your present position . Between scheduling pedicures and bikini waxes , absorb everything you can about the business . Since you ' re interested in film development , read as_many scripts as you can get your hands on and write brilliant ' coverage ' ( script analysis ) and ' notes ' that impress people with your savvy creativity and writing ability . You ' re putting_up with a lot to be_on the inside of a major studio , so make the most of it . Pinpoint all_of the players at Disney with whom you ' d like to work and network your way into the introductions you need . Other assistants are leaving all_the time -- some are giving_up and some are getting promoted -- and your dream job may be only a schmoozy lunch in the commissary away .

You might also want to build skills and experience in inter-group relations training by volunteering for RLA ( ( 213 ) 740-4752 ) , the Center for Nonprofit Management ( ( 213 ) 623-7080 ) or the Kellogg Training Center ( ( 213 ) 736-1304 ) .

John Henshaw Age : 45 Education : BA in psychology , California State University , Hayward ; MA in human resources , University of Redlands Experience : 1982 to present , training department at Vons Cos . Present job : Manager of training and development for Vons Dream job : Vice_president of human resources for Vons Quote : &quot; I am currently handcuffed in this middle-management position and need to break through. &quot; Expert ' s advice : From David Lazzara , an Orange County career consultant : If you want to be corporate vice_president , you have got_to present yourself as such -- starting with your resume . Currently , you describe yourself as a manager of training and development . Since most interviewers tend to have tunnel vision , that is exactly how you will be viewed . It is imperative that your credentials clearly communicate your experience , knowledge and potential as a vice_president . Your resume is not just a door opener , it continues to represent you as it is circulated among other decision_makers . The same approach must be taken with your interview technique . You must present yourself as the executive you aspire to be . Teach yourself to seize opportunities to point_out ways that your experience and abilities can help your potential new employer . Answer questions with concrete examples of actions you successfully took . Include quantifiable results . Begin your job search by targeting employers looking_to increase management positions because of recent business acquisitions , new market penetrations , new product launches or site relocations . Look_for growing companies that may soon need a human resources vice_president and contact them directly , noting that such a position would aid in employee training and retention and result in higher productivity and profits . Finally , look_to recruiters , classified ads and trade journals for job openings . Be persistent and always follow up an interview and resume with a personal phone_call or letter .</TEXT>
