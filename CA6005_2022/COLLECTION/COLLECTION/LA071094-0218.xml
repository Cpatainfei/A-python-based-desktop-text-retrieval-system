   <HEADLINE> MUTINY AND RACIAL INJUSTICE ; THE PRESIDENT SHOULD EXPUNGE THE CONVICTIONS OF BLACK SAILORS IN WORLD_WAR_II INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton has an opportunity to right a racial wrong that lingers from the days of the segregated military during World_War_II . Next Sunday marks the 50th anniversary of an accidental explosion that killed 320 servicemen loading ammunition for the Pacific theater on a dock at Port Chicago in Concord , Calif . On July 17 the National_Park_Service will dedicate a memorial to the dead and injured at the site . But there is much more to the story . Most of the dead were black sailors , working in segregated units and usually given the most menial and dangerous tasks in those days . When their unit was ordered back to loading live shells two weeks after the deadly blast , 258 black sailors refused , calling the conditions unsafe and their training inadequate . They were convicted at courts-martial , 50 of them for mutiny and sentenced to 15-year prison_terms . After the war , the secretary_of_the_Navy commuted their sentences to 16 months and the men ultimately were given honorable discharges ; some continued to serve in the military . And , indeed , the case became a turning point for civil_rights and was a key factor_in President Harry S . Truman ' s historic decision to order the desegregation of the armed forces in 1948 . Yet the convictions still blot the records of the men , many of whom are still alive . After a lengthy review , Secretary_of_the_Navy John H . Dalton upheld the convictions last Jan . 6 . He admitted the black seamen had been assigned the hazardous ammunition work because of their race but denied that prejudice played a role in their courts-martial . That is an unsatisfactory finale to the painful Port Chicago episode . Sens . Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein and Reps . George Miller , Ronald V . Dellums , Pete Stark and Nancy Pelosi , all_of California , have asked President Clinton to expunge the convictions . We agree .</TEXT>
