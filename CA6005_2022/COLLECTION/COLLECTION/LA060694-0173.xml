   <HEADLINE> ORIGINAL 1944 CAST STILL JUMPING ; VETERANS : FORTY FORMER PARATROOPERS , AGES 68 TO 83 , RE-ENACT THEIR HISTORIC MISSION OVER FRANCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thomas Rice , a retired San Diego high_school teacher , gave the thumbs-up sign to his comrades Sunday and then stepped_out of a plane 3 # 500 feet above France . As a brisk wind opened his parachute and snapped_at the crease in his new pants , Rice looked down on the green fields of Normandy . &quot; I just kept thinking I didn ' t want to land in that field with the three bulls in it , &quot; the 73-year-old Rice said moments later , safely on the ground , his angular face smeared with mud . &quot; But , thank goodness , I just got a little wet. &quot; Rice and 39 other World_War_II veterans , ranging_in age from 68 to 83 , parachuted near this village Sunday , re-enacting their daring invasion of German-held France 50 years ago . With a crowd of dignitaries and a fully equipped MASH unit waiting below , the men filled the sunny afternoon sky like multicolored confetti . &quot; We did_it because , well , a lot of our friends were killed here 50 years ago , &quot; said Rice , who had been a platoon leader in the 101st Airborne on D-day and suffered shrapnel wounds to a leg and arm . &quot; And sometimes over the years we have felt some guilt about that . But today I feel_like I can bury that guilt and not worry about it anymore. &quot; Added Robert Dunning , 73 , from Atlanta : &quot; It was a great feeling . Back in 1944 , it was 2 a.m. , we were under sniper fire and I missed the target by 20 miles . It was easier this time . Nobody was shooting at us. &quot; But winds did push several of the veteran paratroopers off course . Rene Dussaq of Encino , at 83 the oldest of the veteran jumpers , landed_miles away from the drop_zone , and U.S. spotters in helicopters lost sight of him . He was eventually found by French firefighters , and two hours later Dussaq was having a drink_in Sainte-Mere-Eglise . &quot; There was a little wind , but it was not too_bad , &quot; Dussaq said . &quot; It was very pleasant . You could look_around at the countryside . It was very beautiful. &quot; In the town square of Sainte-Mere-Eglise , a crowd of more_than 8 # 000 turned_up to greet the jumpers and other returning U.S. veterans . The grinning jumpers , wearing replicas of the uniforms they wore in 1944 , signed autographs , shouted &quot; bonjour &quot; to well-wishers and accepted kisses from women in the crowd . Despite widespread fears for their safety , not the least from their own families , only two of the aging paratroopers were injured in the jump . One twisted his ankle , and a second , Earl Draper , 70 , of Inverness , Fla. , was hospitalized with minor back injuries . Draper ' s main chute opened , but the lines became snarled . As the crowd watched in fearful silence , he deployed an emergency reserve chute , which is harder to control , and landed a_few dozen feet from the MASH unit . He was taken by helicopter to a local hospital , where an Army spokesman said he was &quot; doing fine. &quot; &quot; Mr. Draper did just the right thing , &quot; said U.S. Army Col . Richard M . Bridges , himself a paratrooper . &quot; My hat ' s off to him . He did a terribly courageous thing . But I ' m proud_of them all . I just hope I can do that when I ' m their age. &quot; The veterans ' jump was followed by a spectacular jump by 700 U.S. and French paratroopers , who alighted without incident on the pastures amid yellow buttercups . The show was part of a daylong celebration at Sainte-Mere-Eglise , which was the first French town liberated on D-day , freed by U.S. paratroopers even before Allied troops landed at the nearby Utah and Omaha beaches . The town has hosted U.S. veterans and their families every year since the war , and for years the mayor ' s wife wrote to families of U.S. servicemen and tended the graves of those who died here . On Sunday , the community was bedecked with U.S. and other Allied nations ' flags . One sign_in the crowd read , &quot; We Never Forget You Guys. &quot; Among those on_hand to welcome the veterans was Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur and Rep . Sam Gibbons ( D-Fla. ) , the House Ways and Means Committee chairman and D-day veteran who is President Clinton ' s representative to the festivities . &quot; We came_to see them because of the memories , &quot; said Jean-Charles LePouder , 38 , who brought his wife and two children from a nearby town . &quot; This is really an important part of our history. &quot; A full day of activities , attended by Clinton and other national_leaders , is scheduled for today in Normandy . Clinton will first address veterans at Pointe de Hoc , the cliff taken by U.S. Army Rangers in 1944 . Later , he will talk to several thousand veterans at the American Cemetery on the cliff above Omaha Beach . The U.S. paratrooper assault around this village in the early hours of June 6 , 1944 , was part of an important first attack designed to make_it impossible for the Germans to reinforce their troops stationed on cliffs above the beaches . On that day , U.S. planes carrying the paratroopers came under heavy ground_fire and were going twice the normal jump speed when the soldiers emerged to fill the night sky . Many of the American jumpers were blown_off target that day , but the scattered landings helped confuse the Germans . Some American soldiers drowned in fields that had been flooded by the Germans , and others were killed by snipers . Of those who jumped in 1944 , one in five died in the descent or in the fighting that followed . One paratrooper ' s chute caught_on the 12th-Century church steeple in the center of town , and he pretended to be dead until help arrived . His exploits are honored by a mock paratrooper , complete with chute , that still hangs from the church steeple . The decision by the aging veterans to jump was greeted with some concern by the_French government and the U.S. Army , as well as local residents . &quot; They don ' t need to jump to be heroes to us , &quot; said Henri-Jean Renaud , the son of the former mayor and now a pharmacist in town . But the officials relented when each of the former paratroopers completed three practice jumps in San Diego . For the jump Sunday , they used modern parachutes , which are easier than military chutes to guide . And they also jumped from a much greater height -- 3 # 500 feet compared to the 500 feet that is standard during combat assaults . The higher altitude provides a greater safety margin , creating more time to deal with parachute problems . &quot; Crazy ? Do I look crazy ? &quot; asked Warran Wilt , 71 , from Abbeyville , Kan . &quot; No . We just had to do this . The people we left here deserved this. &quot; Barbara Williams , whose 71-year-old husband , Bob , was among the jumpers , said she was &quot; scared to death when I saw that one man have trouble with his chute. &quot; But she was pleased when it was over . &quot; It was a relief just to get_out of that plane , I ' ll tell you , &quot; paratrooper Dunning said . &quot; It was freezing up there . But when we jumped , it was heaven . I was smiling . But then I thought , I just don ' t want to fall_in the mud. &quot; * TimesLink : 808-8463 TimesLink features historic D-day recordings of British Gen .
