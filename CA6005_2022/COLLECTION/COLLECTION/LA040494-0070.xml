   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : BULLISH ON LUKE PERRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Luke Perry ' s movie about real-life world champion bull rider Lane Frost may_not be a great movie but , as a British ex-patriate who had never clapped eyes on a bull rider ( real or on celluloid ) , let alone heard of Lane Frost , I found &quot; 8 Seconds &quot; fascinating , inspirational and moving . Hell , I cried . Peter Rainer classified Perry ' s Frost as a &quot; cardboard good_guy &quot; and said he &quot; never sinks low enough to make his rise exciting &quot; ( &quot; ' 8 Seconds ' : This True Rodeo Story Lacks True Grit , &quot; Calendar , Feb . 25 ) . In fact , he ' s alternately gutless , arrogant and idiotic for much of the movie . Perry ' s portrayal is uncomfortably unflattering in places and his widow , Kellie , should be congratulated for allowing Perry to publicize the seamier side of her late husband . Nor does the evidence show that Kellie was what Rainer calls a &quot; stand-by-your-man sweetheart , &quot; in real_life or as played by Cynthia Geary . Rainer finds_fault_with the film ' s &quot; processed &quot; heartbreak . Processed ? This is a true story . Sure , the film ' s major downfall is its over-sugary script ; let ' s face it , schmaltzy lovers ' talk is enough to make the soppiest of us cringe . I also would like to mention James Rebhorn ' s role as Frost ' s undemonstrative father . Contrary to the review , I thought his increasing displeasure as Frost sweats his way to the world championship was not intended to be viewed_as a peculiar expression of paternal love . He was more like a father who resented Lane ' s following in his own long-gone , champion bull-riding hoof marks . The story of Lane Frost has obviously been a labor_of_love for Perry , and an important test of his acting skills . He has never been stretched like this on &quot; Beverly Hills , 90210 &quot; and clearly he can act . His Western cowboy drawl is also consistent and eons away from the TV_show ' s Dylan McKay . More impressive , though , is the fact that Perry spent months learning to ride bulls for the film . No stunt doubles for him , it ' s all real , and dangerous to boot . Perry has guts and a big heart . I interviewed him recently at the film ' s international press junket . His eyes welled with tears and he was so choked he couldn ' t speak . The real Kellie Frost had just told him she loved the movie ; that he ' d got Lane Frost spot-on . He said that was all that mattered . Making_it in the movies is tough , so give the guy a break and , if not credit , at least full marks for effort .</TEXT>
