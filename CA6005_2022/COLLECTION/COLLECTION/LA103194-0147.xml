   <HEADLINE> POPE NAMES 30 NEW CARDINALS , INCLUDING 2 U.S. ARCHBISHOPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pope John Paul II on Sunday named 30 new cardinals , including the archbishops of Baltimore and Detroit and the first cardinals from Sarajevo and two former East Bloc states . The Pope ' s naming of Vinko Puljic as cardinal from Sarajevo reflects his long support for Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s besieged capital , which he had hoped to visit Sept . 8 but could not because of security concerns . The promotion of churchmen from Albania and the former Soviet republic of Belarus , and the naming of a Czech cardinal , represents an opening to the former Communist countries of the east . He also named cardinals from Vietnam and Cuba , the first from the Caribbean country under leader Fidel Castro . Archbishops William Keeler of Baltimore and Adam Maida of Detroit were the Americans selected . The Pope had planned to visit Keeler ' s archdiocese this month , but his U.S. visit was postponed due_to health_problems . Keeler , 63 , is the president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and thus the church ' s chief spokesman in the United States . Ordained in 1955 , he was an expert adviser to Pope John XXIII at the Second Vatican Council in 1962-65 and was bishop of Harrisburg , Pa. , before being named to head the Baltimore archdiocese in 1989 . He has also become an ecumenical diplomat , smoothing relations between Jews and Catholics . Maida was ordained in Pittsburgh in 1956 and became bishop of Green_Bay , Wis. , in 1984 . The Pope named him head of the 1.5-million-member Detroit archdiocese in 1990 . The pontiff also named Jan Schotte , a Belgian who heads the bishops ' synod , to the post of cardinal . The multilingual Schotte , who has close contacts with cardinals and bishops around the world , is considered the Pope ' s close ally . John Paul made the announcement in his regular Sunday address to the faithful from his window over St . Peter ' s Square . Applause rose among the thousands of people there when the Pope pronounced the Sarajevo archbishop ' s name . Puljic , who is 49 , is the youngest of all_the cardinals . The announcement Sunday was an important step toward ensuring that one of the Pope ' s men will be the next leader of the world ' s 950 million Catholics . When the title of cardinal is bestowed on the 30 men at a Nov . 26 ecclesiastical meeting , John Paul will have filled the 24 openings in the 120-member body of cardinals eligible to choose his successor . Only cardinals under the age of 80 can vote -- and six of the 30 new appointees will be older than that by the time of the Nov . 26 ceremony . In all , 103 of the 120 have been named during the 16 years of his papacy . The new cardinals , representing 24 countries , &quot; reflect in a significant way the universality of the church with the multiplicity of its ministers , &quot; the Pope said . But many also share the Pope ' s image of a conservative church dedicated to social justice .</TEXT>
