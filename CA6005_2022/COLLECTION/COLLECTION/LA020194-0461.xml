   <HEADLINE> LIKELY ISRAEL-PLO PACT ASKS BOTH SIDES TO GIVE GROUND ; MIDEAST : TENTATIVE ACCORD REACHED IN SWISS TALKS EVEN DETAILS BORDER-STATION WINDOW GLASS , SOURCES SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As details emerged here of tentative accords reached early Monday between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on the future of Jericho and the Gaza Strip , it was clear that both sides would have to give significant ground on issues ranging from the security of Jewish settlers to control of international frontiers . Sources said the proposed agreements , reached by Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in Switzerland , are so detailed they specify the type of window glass that will be used at border stations . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who spent most of the day consumed with a crisis developing in his government over national health_insurance , made no public comment on the proposals , which were faxed to him from Switzerland on Monday . He was reported to be studying the intricate set of compromises , and there were sharply conflicting reports in the Israeli media on the prospects for a final agreement that would pave the way for Israel ' s withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho soon . Early in the day , Israel Radio , which reported details of the tentative agreements for the first time , announced , &quot; The indications from the prime_minister ' s bureau are that , by and large , Rabin endorses these agreements. &quot; Israeli Television , though , took the opposite tone in its evening broadcast . It quoted sources close to the prime_minister saying unofficially , &quot; Whatever progress was made ( between Peres and Arafat ) was certainly not enough. &quot; Underscoring that skepticism , Environment Minister Yossi Sarid , who joined Peres during the weekend talks , told Israeli Television on arrival from Switzerland , &quot; There is still a long , long way to go . &quot; We are not close to a full agreement . But certain issues have been almost finalized. &quot; Ahmed Tibi , an adviser to Arafat , also confirmed to Israeli Television : &quot; There is no agreement. &quot; In a telephone_interview , Tibi said , &quot; It ' s true that on the first day there was a very positive atmosphere . Certain understandings were reached . Later , Israel went_back_on some of the things that were agreed upon. &quot; Asked to identify the most important outstanding dispute , he said it was the border crossings . The statements came against a backdrop of general optimism here that a final round of negotiations scheduled for later this week in Cairo would clear the last remaining obstacles to the start of Palestinian self-rule , and that Peres and Arafat could sign an official agreement as early as Sunday , when both said they are planning to meet again in Cairo . Peres was decidedly upbeat as he left Switzerland before dawn Monday for Washington , where he is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and Vice_President Al Gore . He indicated that he and Arafat had settled most of the disputes that have delayed Israel ' s original commitment to begin withdrawing its troops from the occupied territories Dec . 13 . &quot; There had been very complicated problems , &quot; Peres said . &quot; We were able to negotiate many of them , maybe most of them. &quot; Official reports detailing the agreements stated that Peres ' delegation had ceded to PLO demands for what the Palestinians called &quot; safe passages &quot; -- land routes entirely under Palestinian authority that would permit Palestinians and other religious pilgrims to pass from Jericho to holy sites outside the autonomous zone of Jericho . Among those sites is Nabi Moussa , a shrine near the Dead_Sea that Muslims have revered for centuries as the tomb of Moses . But &quot; on control of the border points , Israel got most of what it wanted , &quot; state radio reported . According to several accounts on state radio , in Israel ' s Hebrew press and confirmed by Minister Sarid , Arafat agreed to Israeli proposals to set_up a complex system of surveillance at the border crossings between Egypt and the Gaza Strip , and at the Allenby Bridge between Jericho and Jordan . Specifically , the PLO said it would permit Israeli state security to observe every individual and each item entering the autonomous region from behind two-way mirrors . Arafat ' s delegation further agreed , according to those reports , to Israeli demands for what state radio called &quot; a sterile room &quot; at the border posts , where Israeli security officers will be permitted to interrogate and search &quot; suspicious &quot; persons without Palestinian officials present . The border crossings have been among the most contentious of the outstanding issues between Israel and the PLO , and Sarid confirmed Monday night that the two sides are now &quot; very , very close to full agreement &quot; on the dispute . For the Palestinians , control of_their_own borders is both a symbolic and logistic assertion of sovereignty after 27 years under Israeli occupation . For Israel , though , the issue is one of security and the ability to police against the influx of arms or illegal immigrants entering an autonomous land in its back yard . Most accounts in Israel ' s highly regarded Hebrew media stated that the weekend talks resolved all major outstanding disputes between the two sides and included a Palestinian agreement to permit Israeli security to control_key roads in the Gaza Strip . Israel had insisted on the patrols as a way to ensure the safety of the 5 # 000 Jewish settlers who will remain in Gaza until the fate of Jewish settlements throughout the territories is decided in future negotiations . It remained unclear , though , whether Peres and Arafat resolved a final disagreement over the size of Jericho . Most of Israel ' s major daily newspapers reported that the two had reached &quot; a gentlemen ' s agreement &quot; under which Peres agreed to recommend that the prime_minister offer a larger territory than his negotiators have in the past . But state radio disputed the reports , announcing , &quot; The remaining bone of contention appears to be the extent of withdrawal of the Israeli army in the Jericho area. &quot;</TEXT>
