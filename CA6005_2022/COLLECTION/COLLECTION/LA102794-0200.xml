   <HEADLINE> 2ND MISTRIAL IS DECLARED IN CITY_COUNCIL FINANCIAL LIABILITY CASE ; COURT : TRIAL IS DELAYED IN SUIT THAT ALLEGES THE MEMBERS SHOULD PERSONALLY PAY DAMAGES FOR ACTIONS OF POLICE WHO SHOT FOUR ROBBERS AFTER A HOLDUP IN SUNLAND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprise development , a Los Angeles federal judge Wednesday declared a second mistrial in a case that could lead to a ruling holding Los Angeles City_Council members financially liable , as individuals , for police brutality . The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge J . Spencer Letts does not end the case , but in_effect delays the trial until Dec . 6 . A mistrial had previously been declared in the case last December because Stephen Yagman , an attorney for the plaintiff , described the killing of a robber by officers from the LAPD ' s Special Investigations Section as &quot; murder &quot; during his closing arguments . The suit brought by Yagman alleges , among other things , that council_members should be forced to pay damages out of_their_own pockets for the actions of special investigations officers who shot four robbers after a holdup at a McDonald ' s restaurant in Sunland on Feb . 12 , 1990 . Three were killed and one wounded . The trial , which was to be split into two phases , began Tuesday in U.S. District Court . In the first phase , a jury was to determine whether to award compensatory damages to 4-year-old Johanna Trevino , whose father was one of the slain robbers . Johanna was born seven days after her father , Javier Trevino , was killed . After that , the same jury was to hear a second phase of the trial , roughly a month later , to determine whether council_members can be held personally liable for damages . Yagman has argued that when the council_members voted to have the city pay punitive damages assessed against the police_officers in a previous trial , they condoned the officers ' conduct . The jury was also supposed to decide whether LAPD officers habitually use excessive force and whether the city and council_members should share the blame , on the grounds that the council has routinely voted to pay damages assessed against police_officers by juries in brutality trials . Yagman said city records show that council_members voted to pay the damages in 37 of 39 such cases . But Wednesday ' s proceedings headed toward a mistrial after Letts ruled that Yagman could not present testimony from several witnesses about the economic loss the girl may have suffered as a result of her father ' s death . The judge ruled that Yagman lacked concrete proof of how much the girl ' s father would have made if he had lived . Yagman said the psychiatrist he wanted to call to testify on the emotional distress the child has suffered as the result of her father ' s death was out of town until Monday , which would not have meshed with the jury ' s schedule . As a result , Letts subsequently declared a mistrial because of Yagman ' s inability to proceed with his case , despite protests by the Los Angeles city attorney ' s office , which is defending the city . Don Vincent , supervising deputy city attorney , asked Letts to decide the case himself , but the judge declined . &quot; Whenever you come_out of a case without a loss it has to be a good_day , &quot; Vincent said in an interview . &quot; But in this case it ' s not a particularly warm feeling. &quot; Yagman described the decision as fair and said the only effect it will have is that a new jury will be selected to hear the entire case at once , dealing with the issues in what had been phase one and phase two , unless a settlement is reached in the meantime . In effect , &quot; nothing happened here , &quot; he said . * Yagman has offered to drop the suit if the city agrees to set_up an annuity for the child , an offer which city officials say would cost $ 1 million . Los Angeles City Atty . James Hahn told reporters at City_Hall Wednesday that although he believes the case should have been dismissed , &quot; we will never close the door on settlement. &quot; The Los Angeles city attorney ' s office has tried to get the suit dismissed , citing the common legal doctrine that lawmakers cannot be sued personally for votes they cast as part of their official duties . Letts rejected the city ' s position , a decision that was upheld by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , which ruled unanimously that the decision to pay the damages assessed against the police_officers was an administrative , not a legislative , act . The city appealed_to the U.S. Supreme Court , which refused this month to hear the case , setting the stage for this week ' s trial . In the incident that resulted in the lawsuits , 19 special investigations members followed the four men suspected in a string of restaurant robberies from Venice to Sunland and watched as they broke_into the closed McDonald ' s about 1 a.m. , and robbed a lone employee inside . After the robbers got_into their car , the officers moved_in and later testified they fired 35 rounds from shotguns and handguns when the robbers pointed weapons at them , which were later determined to be unloaded pellet guns . Relatives of the robbers sued former Los Angeles Police_Chief Daryl Gates and nine officers shortly after the shooting , contending that the police shot the men without provocation and that Gates was responsible_for the way the department was run . A jury found in favor of the families in March , 1992 , and assessed more_than $ 44 # 000 in punitive damages against Gates and the officers . Yagman , who had represented the families , subsequently filed an identical lawsuit on behalf of Trevino asking_for unspecified damages against the city , the council_members and police . * The girl , who Yagman said had traveled from Vera Cruz , Mexico , for the trial , was not present in court Wednesday . The attorney said he believes it is in the public ' s best interest that the case go_to trial and he hopes it will make council_members think_twice before they vote to pay punitive damages for police_officers . &quot; You ' ve got a bunch of politicians , &quot; Yagman said . &quot; No one has ever gotten close to them and all_of a sudden the madman from Venice -- that ' s me -- shows_up at the door. &quot;</TEXT>
