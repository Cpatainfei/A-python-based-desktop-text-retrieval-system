   <HEADLINE> HEALTH WATCH ; BILL WITH A MORAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Morally repugnant as it may seem , providing new hypodermic_needles to drug_addicts has proven highly successful in combatting the spread of AIDS . With varying degrees of official toleration , such programs have operated in New York City , San Francisco , Berkeley , Oakland , Seattle and here in Los Angeles . In New York State , needle-exchange programs operate legally under state law . Unfortunately , the California programs labor under a legal cloud of uncertainty because Gov . Pete Wilson has twice vetoed bills authorizing counties to permit pilot_programs . To get_around this , Mayor Richard Riordan , at the urging of the City_Council , declared a health emergency in the city Tuesday . The county Board of Supervisors is considering a similar measure . The city declaration is really a legal fiction , for there is nothing in it to prevent the police or prosecutors from enforcing laws against needle possession and distribution . But at least it gives them the political cover to look the other way when needle exchange programs distribute syringes in various parts of the city . In vetoing the bills , Wilson invoked the morality of personal responsibility , saying drug abusers must suffer the consequences of their personal choices . But many others have innocently contracted HIV , the AIDS virus -- including infants of drug-using mothers . The Legislature has now put a third bill authorizing needle exchanges ( AB 2610 ) on the governor ' s desk . He should put aside moral qualms and political expediency and sign it in the name of public health .</TEXT>
