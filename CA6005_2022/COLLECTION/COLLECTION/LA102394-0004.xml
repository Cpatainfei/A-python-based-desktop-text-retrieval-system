   <TEXT> What is posterity ? Nothing but &quot; an unending jostle of vanities , appetites and fears , &quot; concludes Ian Hamilton at the end of a book that is quite surprisingly entertaining and suggestive . One might not suppose that a work subtitled &quot; Literary Estates and the Rise of Biography &quot; would give one cause to laugh aloud , but it does . Hamilton is a British poet , an editor and himself the biographer of Robert Lowell and , notoriously , of J . D . Salinger ( well , he tried ) . For all his scholarship , he writes here with the immediacy , economy and ease of a witty man talking_over a bottle of wine . The &quot; keepers of the flame &quot; are the friends , relations , devotees , literary executors and biographers , in whose hands lies what Hamilton calls the &quot; after-fame &quot; of great writers . We live_in an era of copious , candid and some would say intrusive , biography . The questions Hamilton addresses about the history and ethics of the genre were never more topical . &quot; How much should a biographer tell ? How much should an executor suppress ? And what would the biographee have wanted -- do we know ? &quot; He proceeds chronologically , by means of case-histories , each marking some change or development in the perceived function of the custodians of greatness . This leads us into the history of publishing and of the law on copyright , into the company of some egregious crooks and creeps , and into some stimulatingly unprovable statements from Hamilton . The poet and priest John_Donne ( d . 1631 ) , for example , was &quot; the first &quot; important writer to leave a substantial collection of letters , and his no-good son was &quot; the first &quot; to see that there was money to be made from a literary parent ' s leavings . Edmund Curll , the 18th-Century publisher , was &quot; the first &quot; to cash_in_on scurrilous instant biographies . Robert Burns was &quot; the first &quot; to have his frailties exposed by a biographer ( he drank himself to death ) . Just occasionally , Hamilton is wrong . He writes that Thackeray ' s daughter &quot; vetoed all thoughts of a biography , &quot; thus fueling speculation about skeletons in cupboards ; in fact , she commissioned Trollope to write a book about her father , which he did . Admittedly , she gave him very little material to work_on . The book is_full of tasty details about cabinets and laundry-baskets of letters and manuscripts falling_into greedy hands , or being used as wrapping paper for groceries . Keepers of the flame tended to be self-appointed . The poet Marvell ' s landlady posed as his wife in_order to get money owed to his estate . Sir William Davenant liked it to be thought that he was Shakespeare ' s illegitimate son . Thomas Hardy had the bright idea of controlling his after-fame by ghosting his own biography , ostensibly authored by his second wife . The book is free from academic pedantry . Hamilton remarks that Johnson ' s life of Dryden contains &quot; the funniest and cruellest &quot; of the &quot; many wildly improbable &quot; accounts of Dryden ' s funeral , quoting none of them , and thus whetting the reader ' s desire to find_out more . Likewise , he writes_of William Warburton , the adviser and editor of Alexander Pope , that Pope guided him to a rich wife &quot; and then ( via her very rich uncle ) to a bishopric and a palatial estate. &quot; Most scholars would have ruined their narrative flow by dutifully identifying , if only in a footnote , the &quot; very rich uncle. &quot; Not Ian Hamilton . His pace and semi-satirical tone extract the maximum entertainment value from pompous literary mayhem . He writes with informed malice about the frequent rivalry between a dead author ' s self-aggrandizing &quot; best_friends &quot; as_to who is the true keeper of the flame . Disciples are often catty about co-disciples . One reviewer of &quot; The Life of Dickens &quot; by his friend and champion John Forster complained that it &quot; should not be called ' The Life of Dickens ' but ' The History of Dickens ' Relations_to Mr. Forster. ' &quot; Yet Forster was cavalier about his hero ' s materials . He chopped extracts out of Dickens ' letters ( discarding the tattered remains ) and pasted them into his manuscript , which was thrown_away afterward by the printers . Boswell was the most successful flame-keeper of all time , making the relationship between subject and biographer the central pillar of his &quot; Life of Dr. Johnson , &quot; to the extent that Boswell is now a more lively commercial proposition than Johnson himself . They believed_in &quot; definitive &quot; biography in the past , and possessive jealousy such_as John Forster ' s found destruction preferable to the gaze of alien eyes . John Cam Hobhouse , neurotically possessive about the late Lord Byron , engineered the burning of his idol ' s autobiography , unread , because it had been shown to Tom Moore and not to him . Hobhouse was uneasy lest there might be something uncomplimentary about himself in it . When Henry_James was given a private view of Byron ' s scandalous private papers he was so appalled that he went_home and destroyed 40 years accumulation of_his_own correspondence , manuscripts and notebooks , expressing an &quot; utter and absolute abhorrence &quot; of any biography of himself . And what was the upshot ? Leon Edel ' s five-volume &quot; Life of Henry_James , &quot; and four volumes of letters . Henry_James did not have much to hide , or else it remains hidden . He is an exception . Readers are sometimes shocked when they discover that authors whose books they admire were less than admirable in private life . Hamilton poses the most difficult question that biographers and critics must address : &quot; Does poetic genius excuse or mitigate bad conduct ; does / should knowing about the life have a bearing on how we read the work ? &quot; In the 19th Century , most spouses and devotees thought it their duty to suppress all evidence of &quot; bad conduct. &quot; Biographers worked &quot; to the sound of snipping scissors and paper crackling in the grate . . . . After the funeral would come the slamming of doors , the scrubbing of marble and then , within two years or so , the emergence of what Gladstone called ' a reticence in three volumes. ' &quot; George Eliot ' s reputation for unrelenting high seriousness was largely established by her widower cutting all jokes and familiar turns of speech out of her published letters and journals . The problems remain much the same today . The biographer of a modern subject is caught between wanting to tell &quot; the truth &quot; and the need to maintain good relations with informants and access to the archive . The eternal dispute , as identified by Henry_James , between &quot; the public and the private , between curiosity and delicacy &quot; may have been resolved to Kitty Kelley ' s satisfaction , but it still exercises most biographers . Coming_to our own time , Hamilton is sharp about the costiveness of T . S . Eliot ' s widow in publishing his letters and declining to authorize a biography , while she allows Eliot ' s words to be mixed with Trevor Nunn ' s in the song &quot; Memory &quot; in the lucrative show Cats ; Hamilton pays tribute to Peter Ackroyd ' s subtly &quot; widow-proof &quot; account of Eliot ' s life . Yet he shows sympathy with Ted Hughes who , as he writes , cannot even destroy any of_his_own private papers without being accused of interfering with &quot; Plath Studies. &quot; This book was first published in Britain two years ago -- before the very pertinent furor caused by the publication of the biography of Philip Larkin by Andrew Motion and of Larkin ' s Letters , before the contentious overview of the saga of the Plath biographies by Janet Malcolm in the New Yorker ( issued Aug . 23 and 30 , 1993 ) , before the proposal for a new and Draconian &quot; Privacy Bill &quot; in Britain , and before it was decided that the 50-year copyright period should be increased in Britain to 70 years , in the interests of harmonization within the European Union . It would have been helpful , in the American edition , to have had an afterword on these matters . Hamilton ' s own position is that writers must , in the first instance , be their own keepers of the flame : In other words , having read this review , you should at once burn all your diaries and love-letters . Or not ; as Isaak Walton wrote in the 17th Century , a wish for self-perpetuation is &quot; rooted in the very nature of man. &quot; But you should never , Hamilton thinks , burn anyone else ' s private papers . Larkin in his last illness requested that his diaries be destroyed . His friend Monica Jones shredded the 25 volumes within hours of his death . She did not have to . However vehement the wishes of the deceased in this regard , you are not in ( British ) law obliged to fulfill them . There are evidently still moral imperatives stronger than the tug of literary history or the law_of_the_land . But there ' s little any author can do about eliminating indiscreet letters written to other people ; they are probably already in the Humanities Research_Center at the University of Texas at Austin anyway , nicely filed and catalogued . Only the law of copyright , and a stalwart keeper of the flame , can protect you . On the evidence of this book , writers should choose the keepers of their flame very carefully indeed . As Dryden wrote to his young protege , the playwright Congreve : &quot; Be kind to my Remains ; and oh defend Against Your Judgement Your departed Friend ! &quot;</TEXT>
