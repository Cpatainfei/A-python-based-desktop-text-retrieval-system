   <HEADLINE> TREASURERS TRY TO CATCH_UP TO CHANGING TIMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Charles County treasurer ' s job did not look all that difficult in 1974 when Thelma Bowie first considered running_for the office , so she took a shot at it . To no one ' s surprise , she won . With a high_school diploma -- and 24 years of experience as a staffer for retiring Treasurer Franklin Winkler -- Bowie was reasonably familiar_with the basic routine : Collect the taxes that people send_in and then put the money in the bank -- into &quot; safe &quot; certificates_of_deposit . &quot; It was a political office -- you went_to all_the weddings and funerals , &quot; recalls retired state Sen . Jim Simpson , who was a county official at the time . In August , after five consecutive terms , Bowie retired amid a scandal over $ 1.3 million in losses racked_up when her deputy invested county funds in &quot; derivatives &quot; -- the same high-risk financial instruments that have wrought havoc in Orange County . Bowie ' s travail -- she is undergoing medical treatment for heart problems -- reflects some of the stunning changes that have overtaken the once-staid world of municipal and county fiscal officers over the past few decades . From onetime financial backwaters that could be run_by almost anyone , local_government finance departments have been quietly evolving into complex operations that often require special investment acumen as well as knowledge of the latest innovations in financial markets . Not every jurisdiction has kept pace with these demands , and some -- possibly including Charles County and others where the job is still a part of the county ' s courthouse political legacy -- are struggling with the consequences now . One major factor behind the painful transition is a drastic increase in the pressures on treasurers to earn more with their constituents ' money . Slumping local economies exacerbated by taxpayer revolts have seriously squeezed many cities and counties , prodding fiscal officers to seek every ounce of &quot; investment profit &quot; they can get_to replace forbidden tax_hikes . Interest_rates on the more traditional &quot; safe &quot; investments , such_as Treasury_bills and bank CDs , have steadily declined almost to a pittance , creating temptations to move toward higher-paying -- and decidedly riskier -- bonds . Meanwhile , Wall_Street ' s new high-visibility investment houses have been coming_up with creative financial mutants that salesmen have hawked aggressively to often unsophisticated fiscal officers . &quot; The pressure is_on these people to have maximum performance , and the people who supervise them don ' t care how they get there , &quot; said Robert Sobel , a Hofstra University financial expert . &quot; Six months ago ( Orange County Treasurer Robert L. ) Citron was a hero . Now , look. &quot; To be sure , the latest debacles in places such_as Orange County and Maryland ' s Charles County are hardly the first time that a city , county or state_government has found itself in financial trouble . John Peterson , president of the Government Finance Group , a Virginia-based investment_firm , points_out that in the nation ' s earliest days states routinely defaulted_on big construction bonds for canal-building and the_like , often soaking foreign investors . The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations reports that in the late 1870s , about one-fourth of the total debt incurred by cities and counties across America was in default -- primarily because of carpetbagging governments and bad railroad bonds . But the big economic recovery after World_War_II -- and a spate of financial crackdowns by states -- stabilized the situation . Through the early 1970s , there were only a handful of big defaults -- New York , Cleveland and the Washington Public Power Supply System among them . And financial crises stemming from bad investments by local officials -- rather than just defaults -- have been even rarer . One reason is that for the most part , counties and cities were restricted by state law from investing in anything much riskier than a Treasury_bill or bank CD . Johnnie Mae Griffin , treasurer of Pittsburg County , Okla. , says her county ' s investment portfolio -- which ranges between $ 5 million and $ 7 million at its peak -- goes entirely into local bank_accounts . &quot; You have to live_in your own world , &quot; she said . &quot; Here , we are much slower-paced. &quot; But quite a_few jurisdictions now have no real limitations , and the lure of greater investment returns is tempting . In Auburn , Maine , population 24 # 000 , where losses from investments in derivatives cost the city about $ 6.5 million last summer , acting City_Manager Patricia A . Finnigan says the government did not even have an investment policy . There was no way to prosecute anyone after the debacle because there were no rules to violate , Finnigan said . &quot; It was just that ( the city ' s treasurer then ) felt that that would be appropriate , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' re developing a policy now , and should have it out soon. &quot; Interestingly , Charles County ' s big financial blowup last summer came despite tight restrictions on permissible investments . County officials decline to explain how their money wound_up in high-risk instruments , but they have filed a series of lawsuits trying to void the transactions on grounds that they were made illegally . Moreover , the qualifications of individual city and county treasurers seem to vary as widely as the laws that regulate them . That is particularly the case in the 34 states where the position is elected by voters rather than appointed based on credentials . For many years , financial expertise would have been almost irrelevant for a treasurer . In the 1800s , they were not expected to invest money -- just keep it . Taxes were paid in gold , and all_the treasurer needed &quot; was a great big vault , &quot; said Bill Finck , who served briefly as a treasurer of Bexar County , Tex . &quot; There was no intention of reinvesting. &quot; Until relatively recently , many jurisdictions deposited their collections in local banks . The banks provided some free services but nothing else . Interest earnings &quot; simply weren ' t expected , &quot; Maryland ' s Simpson recalls . By the 1970s , the entire financial picture began to change . Taxpayer revolts were limiting the ability of local_governments to raise taxes to cover their increasing costs . Federal programs were being cut_back . And Congress was requiring localities to do more . Although most counties were earning interest on their investments by then , the abrupt end to the inflation surge in the 1980s sent interest_rates on Treasury securities and bank CDs plunging , depriving local_governments of one of their few additional sources of income . At the same time , deregulation tore_away many of the restrictions that had limited the scope of the investments available on the financial markets , spawning a plethora of hybrids that offered far higher yields -- at a far higher risk . One major development was the expansion of the so-called government_securities market to include investments offered by quasi-federal agencies such_as the Federal National Mortgage Assn . Although Fannie Mae , as the FNMA is popularly known , and other such entities are not backed by the &quot; full faith and credit &quot; of the federal_government , they are considered so by the markets and thus fall within the limits of many local_governments . As a result , many local fiscal officers found them attractive places to put their money . And despite a_few mishaps in the late-1980s savings and loan debacle , few thought them very risky . When Wall_Street came_up with the idea of offering derivatives , some localities were poised to take the next step . And the salesmen were poised to make a kill . Barbara Bauer , treasurer of Ada County , Ida. , said she gets calls about once a week from salesmen trying to persuade her to invest in one fund or another , including some firms as far away as New York , Florida , Texas , Chicago &quot; and a lot of California types. &quot; Mary Buckler , the treasurer of Marion County , Ind. , which includes Indianapolis , says derivatives salesmen have been pulling_out all_the stops , holding_out promises of high yields and even going_to lengths to find_out her nickname to help endear themselves to her . &quot; The people who present this mask it in mystery ( and ) try to brainwash away your common_sense , &quot; Buckler said . &quot; But you get beyond all_the packaging and marketing and . . . what you see is short-term money attached_to a long-term yield . I don ' t think so ! &quot; Philip M . Dearborn , a government finance expert , says most localities did not succumb to such sales pitches , but the fact that even a minority did is disconcerting . &quot; Many of us have come_to realize that there ' s a lot going_on out there that wasn ' t apparent , &quot; Dearborn said . Using derivatives judiciously to offset other developments in the market is one thing , he says . But &quot; trying to get greedy is just crazy. &quot; Up to now , reform has come relatively slowly . One state that has moved to tighten its rules is Texas , which five years ago began requiring that county treasurers be formally &quot; recertified &quot; by passing courses on the latest bond market developments . &quot; You have to have a program of continuing education because so_much changes every year , &quot; said Bill Melton , the Dallas County treasurer . &quot; We have all sorts of various and sundry instruments to be invested in. &quot; But most analysts believe that broader reforms will be slow in coming . Joe Norris , a former LaPlata businessman who has replaced Thelma Bowie as Charles County treasurer , is determined to avoid a repeat of last summer ' s debacle . &quot; We hold no derivatives , and we ' re not going_to hold any , &quot; he said . But Hofstra ' s Sobel is not so sanguine . &quot; Sure , we can expect to see more conservative financing in the next few years , &quot; he said , &quot; but 15 years from now there ' ll be problems all_over again. &quot; Times staff writer Jonathan Peterson in Los Angeles contributed to this article .
