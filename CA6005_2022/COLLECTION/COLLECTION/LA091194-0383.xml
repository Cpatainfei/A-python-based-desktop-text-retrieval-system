   <HEADLINE> MTA DELAYED RESPONSE TO WARNING ON TUNNELS ; SUBWAY : TO SAVE MONEY , THEY SAY , OFFICIALS WAITED SIX MONTHS BEFORE ORDERING CONTRACTOR TO STABILIZE GROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly a year before subway construction beneath Hollywood Boulevard caused the street and adjoining buildings to sink , officials were warned that settling would occur unless the contractor altered its tunneling technique . But records and interviews show that Los Angeles transit officials waited six months before ordering the contractor to begin stabilizing the ground with grout . Even so , more_than 100 yards of the area that sank last month had been excavated without the grouting required by the subway contract , according to inspection reports . The sinking in Hollywood broke_water lines , crumbled parts of the Walk of Fame and damaged buildings from Vine Street to Highland Avenue . Vehicle_traffic , halted Aug . 20 and 21 , remains restricted . The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has not assigned blame for the sinkage , which is expected to prompt millions of dollars in claims from property_owners and repairs_to tunnels . Officials said that the grouting initially was not conducted along Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont Avenue out of a desire to save money . They said that they believed other aspects of the tunnel construction would adequately stabilize the soil . An aide to the MTA ' s chief_executive_officer , Franklin E . White , said that he is generally satisfied with the construction decisions that have been made -- but will withhold more definitive judgment until after the Federal Transportation Administration completes an ongoing review . &quot; There is a responsibility to be determined here , &quot; said the aide , L.A. ( Kim ) Kimball . The MTA will pay_for remedial work now under way but may later ask other parties to assist , he said . The agency ' s first focus , Kimball said , is to ensure that tunneling can be resumed safely . Representatives of the contractor , Shea-Kiewit-Kenny , a joint_venture controlled by the Walnut-based J . F . Shea Co. , declined to discuss the tunneling . The contractor has notified the transit agency that it attributes the sinking to unexpected underground conditions . Ground sinkage once was a frequent consequence of tunneling projects . But with the advent of modern techniques -- including the use of grout -- settlement of more_than one inch is generally considered unacceptable . Parts of Hollywood Boulevard sank up_to nine inches . The sinkage is but the latest difficulty for what already is the most expensive subway project per mile in U.S. history . The project ' s first tunnel walls were built thinner than designed by another contractor . And according to an independent review , the MTA ' s construction management firm conducted substandard inspections . Officials had pledged improved quality and oversight for new construction . A proving ground for these efforts was to be the roughly 12 miles of twin tunnels from Wilshire Boulevard north to Hollywood Boulevard and west to La Brea Avenue . The $ 165-million contract won by Shea-Kiewit-Kenny , the largest on the subway project , is expected to exceed $ 200 million because of the sinkage and earlier construction difficulties . When tunneling was just under way in June 1993 , MTA rail construction President Edward McSpedon voiced optimism about his ability to control the cost and quality of the work . He said the transit agency was spending more for soil borings to prevent contractors from claiming that they encountered unexpected conditions underground . &quot; We believe that the investment in more borings will more_than pay_for itself , many times over , &quot; McSpedon said in an interview . &quot; We have poked more holes in Vermont Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard than a pin cushion . . . The more information you have , the smarter you are. &quot; One month later , on July 8 , 1993 , tunneling operations came_to a halt when underground water flooded the excavation at the eastern end of Hollywood Boulevard . Tunneling ceased until January 1994 , while the equivalent of a small_town ' s water_supply was pumped into storm drains . The project fell nine months behind schedule as a result of the flooding and a three-week closure , ordered after scores of alleged worker safety violations were uncovered . Meanwhile , an MTA engineering consultant , Paul Eller , warned McSpedon ' s staff in an October , 1993 , meeting that they should enforce a specification requiring &quot; contact grouting &quot; of the tunnels . Eller , The Times has learned , said he believed that irregular ground subsidence already was occurring above the tunnels on Vermont Avenue . John Adams , vice_president of construction for the MTA , said that he and others rejected Eller ' s advice . Adams said he believed that contact grouting was unnecessary because the same , ground-stabilizing benefits could be gained through other procedures . Reached recently , Eller declined to discuss his advice , saying : &quot; This is going_to come_to a head at some time. &quot; Contact grouting entails the injection of grout into the soil from within each freshly dug , circular section of tunnel . It is designed to help prevent sinking by ensuring tight contact between the concrete tunnel liner and the ground . The specifications for the Vermont and Hollywood tunnels required the contractor to grout within 16 hours of each four-foot advancement of the tunnel boring machine . Shea-Kiewit-Kenny had proposed at the outset of tunneling that contact grouting be eliminated . One MTA official said that up_to $ 1 million could have been saved if none of the grouting had been required . Although tunneling ensued without grouting -- and as data showed sinking along both Hollywood and Vermont -- McSpedon ' s staff delayed deciding whether to require the grouting until March , 1994 , after roughly one-third of the tunnels had been dug . After the contractor continued to object to the grouting , Salvatore J . Calvanico , an engineer employed by the MTA ' s management firm , Parsons-Dillingham , wrote in an April report that benefits of performing the grouting &quot; far outweigh any minor cost savings. &quot; Asked why the MTA did not originally require Shea-Kiewit-Kenny to comply with the contract specification , MTA project manager Joel J . Sandberg said : &quot; We have to consider anything that ' s proposed &quot; to save money . The tunneling , he said , was allowed to continue on a &quot; test basis &quot; without grouting . Daily inspection reports show that Shea-Kiewit-Kenny did not contact grout about 340 linear feet of tunnel -- a span longer than a football_field -- between Whitley and Las Palmas avenues . In addition , inspectors repeatedly noted that they had no way of determining what volume of grout was being pumped . The contract required accurate monitoring of the grout quantities . &quot; We need a little more consistency in how we ' re reporting the tunnel grouting , &quot; Chris Dixon , project manager for Parsons-Dillingham , said in an interview . By July 27 , according to a recent MTA report , Hollywood Boulevard had sunk four inches . One Parsons-Dillingham inspector , Michael N . Graber , cited the contractor for failing to comply with the tunnel grouting specification , other records show . Graber filed his four &quot; non-conformance reports &quot; on Aug . 3 , 8 , 9 and 10 . His logs , part of thousands of pages reviewed under the California Public Records Act , separately noted that the contractor ' s grout pumping equipment had broken_down . On Aug . 13 , a broken waterline flooded the Pacific Theatre , two blocks away . On Aug . 17 , an inspector reported &quot; ground loss &quot; in the form of sinking , wet sand near Highland Avenue . At 11 a.m. on Aug . 18 , tunneling was halted . On Aug . 20 , officials conceded that a nine-block area of the boulevard had sunk by up_to nine inches . Inspector Bud Morris ' log that day captured the concern beneath the ground : At 1 p.m. , Morris wrote , Shea-Kiewit-Kenny ' s superintendent evacuated his workers , fearing that &quot; the tunnel was caving in. &quot; Experts who spoke on condition of anonymity said that at the first signs of significant sinkage on Hollywood Boulevard , the MTA could have minimized further settlement by ordering the contractor to inject grout from the ground surface downward . This process , called &quot; compaction grouting , &quot; is expensive and slows excavation . But it routinely is done when significant surface settlement is feared . For instance , after sinkage of four inches was detected on Vermont Avenue , Metro Rail engineer Stephen J . Navin on Oct . 28 , 1993 , ordered Shea-Kiewit-Kenny to conduct compaction grouting from the surface &quot; to arrest this continued settlement , &quot; records show . And MTA officials now are using compaction grouting to stabilize the soil on Hollywood Boulevard above existing tunnels and in the path of future excavation . Tons of grout have been injected over the past three weeks . Sandberg , the MTA project manager , confirmed that at least one staff engineer had recommended compaction grouting in late July or early August , when officials learned that the ground had sunk up_to four inches . &quot; It was considered and it wasn ' t viewed that it would necessarily be effective , &quot; Sandberg said . Sandberg said he also had to weigh the disadvantages caused by compaction grouting , including a slowdown to tunneling and disruption to automobile_traffic . Sandberg also said that the project ' s chief design engineer , Timothy P . Smirnoff , advised him at the time that compaction grouting was not necessary . Smirnoff ' s boss , Martin Rubin , said that the engineer and colleagues &quot; determined that grouting would not significantly reduce settlements. &quot; Rubin , commenting on Smirnoff ' s behalf , said that other preventive measures were taken , including &quot; more frequent monitoring &quot; by inspectors and adjusting of the tunnel-boring machine . It was Smirnoff who drafted an MTA &quot; Tunnel Review Board &quot; report that on Sept . 1 recommended the use of compaction grouting , contact grouting and other precautions during the remainder of the tunneling . The report cited a combination of factors that contributed to the ground sinkage , including the broken water_lines and &quot; indetectable &quot; differences in soil characteristics . Records show that one panelist who signed Smirnoff ' s report , soils specialist James P . Gould , had told officials in writing Nov . 15 that contact grouting would not be necessary in the loose , sandy soil beneath Hollywood Boulevard if &quot; water problems &quot; were controlled . Gould said in an interview that he stands_by his earlier advice , noting that broken water_mains did dampen some of the soil . He said he believes that contact grouting is of marginal benefit if other tunneling procedures are performed properly . Now , as preparations continue for a resumption of tunneling , members of the City_Council are waiting for further assurances that the work can be done safely . On Sept . 2 , they authorized city attorneys to seek a court_order blocking construction if independent engineering tests do not allay concerns . &quot; Right now , you ' ve got people presiding over a fiasco , &quot; City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , who also sits on the MTA board of directors , said in an interview . &quot; There is not adequate over- sight on the part of ( MTA ) executives over the construction process . They have got_to quit apologizing for the contractors and quit sweeping things under the rug. &quot; BACKGROUND The $ 3-billion Los Angeles subway is being financed with federal transit funds and two half-cent sales taxes approved by Los Angeles County voters . Currently , 4.4 miles of tunnels carry passengers from Union Station to MacArthur Park . The subway is part of a regional transit network that includes aboveground rail service connecting Downtown to Long_Beach , the Santa Clarita Valley and the Inland Empire . Digging Difficulties Beginning in late July , the surface of Hollywood Boulevard sank several inches immediately after subway tunneling machines progressed westward , 50 feet below the street . The sinking caused closure of the street from Aug . 19 to Aug . 22 . The portion is still partially obstructed to traffic . Segments of one subway tunnel were not stabilized with grout during excavation . Source : Metropolitan Transportion Authority</TEXT>
