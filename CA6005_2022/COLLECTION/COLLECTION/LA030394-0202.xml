   <HEADLINE> DO IT ! : SKIERS SAY TELEMARK , GET SET , GO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Anyone who watched the ski-jumping competition in the Winter_Olympics heard the term telemark a lot , in reference_to the landings : one ski gliding in front of the other , adding stability . Telemarking , named after a region in southern Norway , is a technique long-used among cross-country skiers , particularly in deep snow and other challenging backcountry conditions . &quot; It works particularly well in_conditions that are not ideal , the glop and slop that you sometimes get , &quot; said Dave Horine of Orange-based Pacific Wilderness Institute . The popularity of the telemark is now moving beyond cross-country to the ski resorts , where more and more skiers are trying telemarking techniques on downhill slopes . Although it is still rare to find anyone telemarking on local ski_runs , Horine says he frequently sees the technique when he skis resorts in Utah and Colorado . Pacific Wilderness Institute , which offers instruction in a variety of outdoor pursuits , will continue its current season of one-day introductory telemark courses Sunday . Other dates for &quot; Telemark Skiing I &quot; are March 12 , 19 and 26 . ( Advanced classes are also offered ) . In past years , classes have been a blend of cross-country and alpine enthusiasts , Horine said , and both are welcome . The cross-country skiers are looking_to move to the next skill level ; the alpine skiers are looking_for a new challenge . &quot; The way telemarking is practiced today , it is truly a hybrid , &quot; Horine added . Topics covered in the one-day workshop include body position and balance , turn initiation , steering and other basics . Classes are held at Big Bear-area ski resorts , where the twin luxuries of groomed snow and lift service allow more time to hone technique . Enrollees should have already mastered the gliding wedge ( the &quot; snowplow &quot; ) before taking the class . Class size is small , usually about four students . &quot; I do_it more for fun than anything else , &quot; Horine said . &quot; It ' s just an excuse to go skiing. &quot; What : Telemark skiing workshop . When : Sunday , March 6 , all day . Also , March 12 , 19 and 26 . Where : Call_for meeting information . Wherewithal : $ 42 , plus lift ticket ( $ 30- $ 40 ) . Where to call : ( 714 ) 998-4596 .</TEXT>
