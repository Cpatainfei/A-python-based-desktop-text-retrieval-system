   <HEADLINE> PROPERTY VALUES : PROGRAM HELPS TURN RENTERS INTO HOMEOWNERS ; REBUILDING : THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCING AGENCY OFFERS SPECIAL LOANS TO CERTAIN EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The January earthquake wasn ' t all bad for Bruce and Ellen Mirovich . The couple had the misfortune of losing many personal belongings and they had to move_out of their Simi Valley apartment , which was yellow-tagged by city officials . With the help of a state-sponsored program , however , the Miroviches are property_owners instead of renters . Through the California Housing Financing Agency , the couple moved to Moorpark in September to a buy a brand-new $ 129 # 500 condo with no money down and financed for 30 years at a fixed interest_rate of just 5.95 % . While the Miroviches did need to come_up with about $ 3 # 000 in closing costs , the $ 1 # 075 monthly payment on their condo is only $ 25 a month more_than they were paying as renters in Simi Valley . Allowing_for tax_benefits , the couple will actually be paying less to own than to rent . &quot; We ' ve been married for 22 years and we ' ve always been renters , &quot; Bruce Mirovich said . &quot; Becoming homeowners has been a major change in our lives. &quot; The Miroviches made use of a little-known state-sponsored program that provides low-interest and low down_payment loans to certain individuals and families who suffered damage as a result of the Northridge earthquake . &quot; We ' ve tried to inform the public , but it ' s amazing how many people don ' t know we ' re here and what we offer , &quot; said Jeannie Buchanan , spokeswoman for the California Housing Finance Agency in Sacramento . CHFA ' s earthquake-related loans were announced in the spring but most borrowers never learned about them , said John Lucas , vice_president and branch manager at ARCS Mortgage Inc. in Van Nuys . ARCS has funded more_than 30 CHFA earthquake loans , but only recently have would-be borrowers started really getting interested in the program . &quot; It ' s been the forgotten loan program , &quot; he said . According to CHFA , there is $ 75 million set_aside for earthquake-related loans for renters . Only one-third of that money has been committed to loans so far , however . That leaves about $ 50 million in unused funds , Buchanan said . The agency said it will probably close_out the quake loan program by the first anniversary of the Northridge quake Jan . 17 . CHFA uses mortgage revenue_bonds to buy loans from lenders statewide . Lenders approved by CHFA are able to offer special terms to buyers who have suffered earthquake damage , who are of moderate income or who are buying a so-called target_area that has been identified by the federal_government as needing assistance . &quot; There are a whole bunch of wrinkles to these things , &quot; Buchanan said . There are several possible ways to tap into the CHFA program : * First-time home_buyers who were renters during the earthquake may qualify for a CHFA loan if they can document serious damage to their rented premises , or if their rented home or apartment was red- or yellow-tagged in the aftermath of the earthquake . It ' s worth noting that first-time home_buyers are defined as renters who haven ' t owned a home_in the last three years , but they don ' t actually have to be first-time buyers . But there are income limits to keep_in mind . A family in Los Angeles County of one or two people can ' t earn more_than $ 55 # 700 and qualify for a CHFA loan ; families of three or more can make_up to $ 64 # 500 and still qualify . The income limits in Ventura County are higher , especially for borrowers who want to buy a home_in a target_area . There are also purchase_price limitations , based on the county where the residence is being purchased and whether the home is newly built or a resale . Existing homes_in non-target areas in Los Angeles County , for example , have a maximum purchase_price of $ 196 # 200 . * Owners or renters who can document that their premises were damaged in the earthquake may also qualify for a CHFA loan if they are looking_to buy_in a target_area . In the San Fernando Valley , target_areas include parts of Pacoima , North Hollywood , Panorama City , Van Nuys and Arleta , among others . Because the target_areas may only cover certain blocks , it ' s best to check with a lender to find_out more specifics . Certain other income and purchase_price limitations also apply . * Borrowers can apply for a CHFA loan under either Federal_Housing_Administration , Veterans Administration or conventional CHFA guidelines . Each application method has its own underwriting and insurance guidelines . CHFA basically acts_as the investor in these loans and the insurer is either the FHA , VA or the California Housing Insurance Fund ( the state agency that insures conventional CHFA loans ) . Borrowers who opt_for a CHFA loan insured by FHA must pay up-front 2.25 % ( although this can be financed as part of the loan ) of the purchase_price , and another 0.5 % per month for FHA ' s mutual mortgage insurance . VA-insured loans require a 2 % of the purchase_price funding fee but no monthly add-on . Conventional CHFA loans are generally limited to a 95 % loan-to-purchase price , with a 0.55 % monthly insurance payment . Note that all CHFA loans have some sort of income and purchase limitations . Also , all CHFA loans require that 1 % of the loan be paid as a fee to the loan originator , or lender . * People who owned homes damaged in the earthquake may also qualify for a CHFA loan if they buy a replacement residence in a targeted area . Various restrictions apply . The CHFA also has a list of approved lenders that is available to would-be borrowers . For information , call the CHFA toll-free at ( 800 ) 789-CHFA .</TEXT>
