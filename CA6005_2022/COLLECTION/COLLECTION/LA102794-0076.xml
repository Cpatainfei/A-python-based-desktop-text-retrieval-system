   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL SCREENING : ' ENTRE NOUS ' : WOMEN ON THE VERGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The key moment in Diane Kurys ' intelligent &quot; Entre Nous &quot; comes during an elementary_school pageant , when Lena and Madeleine meet . Destiny coddles the scene , and we know these two are meant for each other . Kurys ' 1983 movie , screening Friday night as part of UC Irvine ' s &quot; Cinema Potpourri &quot; series , is all about female_bonding filtered through a romantic gauze . The two women , married to flops of husbands and stuck_in domestic routines , find psychological and erotic liberation through their relationship . Kurys wants the audience to know there ' s a good chance all sisters , at the heart of the_matter , are soul-mates . What gives this French film a special poignancy is that it ' s set during an era stifled by convention , making Madeleine ( Miou Miou ) and Lena ' s ( Isabelle Huppert ) connection that much more intriguing . The movie begins in the Pyrenees in the early ' 40s , when Lena , a Belgian Jew , avoids the concentration_camps by marrying Michel ( Guy Marchand ) , a French Legionnaire . This compromising decision is contrasted with tender scenes of Madeleine ' s love_affair with a young art_student , who is soon killed , leaving her with her own bargains to make . She marries Costa ( Jean-Pierre Bacri ) , a failed actor and petty businessman , and settles_down to a life unfulfilled . That is , until she meets Lena . From there , the story moves ahead as something of a feminist allegory , linking us to both ( especially Lena ) as they grow through each other ' s inspiration and devotion . The picture ' s look even changes at this point to underscore Kurys ' excitement over their intimacy . Bernard Lutic ' s cinematography , somewhat harsher and deliberate early on , now seems lusher , more flattering as it dwells_on the pretty faces of Huppert and Miou Miou . But even while Kurys applauds their partnership , she points_out that making such a choice comes_with consequences . Both Lena and Madeleine ignore their children and deceive their husbands to embrace a love that can ' t help but be as selfish as it is liberating . There ' s a vaguely unflattering edge to the women , which gives &quot; Entre Nous &quot; a patina of realism . The authenticity , unfortunately , doesn ' t reach to Michel and Costa , who are painted by Kurys with such coarse strokes that they seem shallow caricatures , especially when compared to the more subtly defined Madeleine and Lena . Ultimately , Costa and Michel are revealed as just part of the backdrop against which Lena and Madeleine ' s lives evolve . that ' s a clear weakness of &quot; Entre Nous , &quot; but it isn ' t towering . The film is a fine example of this smart director ' s work , which includes the little-known &quot; Peppermint Soda &quot; ( 1977 ) and &quot; Cocktail Molotov &quot; ( 1980 ) . * What : Diane Kurys ' &quot; Entre Nous. &quot; * When : Friday , Oct . 28 , at 7 and 9 p.m. * Where : The UC Irvine Student_Center Crystal Cove Auditorium . * Whereabouts : Take the San Diego ( 405 ) Freeway to Jamboree Road , head south to Campus Drive and take a left .
