   <HEADLINE> THE GOODS ; WILL YOU BE SAFE OR SORRY ? ; PEPPER SPRAY ? SMELL REPELLENT ? A STUN GUN ? OR SIMPLE PREVENTION TECHNIQUES ? EXPERTS RATE WHAT ' S BEST AT STOPPING CRIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Personal protection devices -- those gadgets that may make you feel safer on the street -- are a bewildering array of inventions , some of which seem the stuff of low-budget adventure cartoons . You can purchase foam dyes that turn an assailant ' s skin green . &quot; Stinky vials &quot; make you smell disgusting to discourage attackers . Then there are the old standbys -- Mace , pepper spray , stun guns and noise alarms . The Times asked_for opinions on the devices from Lt . Chris West , a crime prevention specialist with the Los Angeles Police_Department , Lt . Chuck Jackson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department and Warren Clark , a former California Highway Patrol member who lectures in the criminal justice_department at Cal State Long_Beach . * * Chemical Mace . A brand-name tear_gas that irritates the eyes , nose and throat . The container can be clipped to a belt , purse or key_ring , or carried in its own pouch . Suggested retail price is $ 14.95. You need training and a state certificate to purchase Mace . &quot; Because Mace sprays as a mist , you have to be fairly close to your attacker and there ' s a danger you will come_in contact with the gas , &quot; Jackson says . &quot; It ' s effective as long as it makes contact with an assailant ' s eyes or mouth. &quot; &quot; We carried it in the California Highway Patrol , &quot; Clark says . &quot; If you handled a garden-variety combatant , it would work . If you handled someone highly intoxicated with cocaine , PCP or alcohol , you ' d get them angry and probably were in_for a pretty good fight. &quot; * * Pepper Spray . Derived from red_pepper plants , this substance disables by forcing the eyes shut and restricting breathing . Acute symptoms subside within 10 to 15 minutes and usually disappear within an hour . Sold in a small can with a clip , it ' s the most popular personal protection device sold at three outlets contacted by The Times . A state certificate is required for purchase . Suggested retail price is $ 15.95. &quot; One of the things we particularly like is that it has a very thin , long spray and you can stand 10 or 12 feet away from people and zap them , &quot; West says . &quot; You don ' t have to get close . Another thing that makes pepper spray different is the liquid that carries the stuff evaporates quickly . With Mace , the residue is much more virulent and long-lasting. &quot; Pepper spray is more effective than Mace when used on people under the influence of drugs or alcohol , police say . Says Clark : &quot; It ' s very effective . It completely debilitates an individual . It pains them immediately and they go right down to their knees . Then with a little water , you can wash it off. &quot; &quot; After training , pepper spray is simple to use whether you ' re 115 pounds or 315 , &quot; Jackson says . &quot; Point , push the button and the stream goes_out . In the Sheriff ' s Department , it was effective about 87 % of the time. &quot; * * Stun Guns . These battery-operated devices can be held_in one hand and deliver an electric_shock when metal prongs touch an assailant . Prices start at about $ 40 . Says West : &quot; You must be so close to assailants with the device , you can reach_out and touch them . If you get that close , they ' ll be very effective . You ' ll drop ( the assailant ) like a hot_potato . &quot; But surprise counts for a lot . Unless you can get straight through to them right away , ( attackers ) may take you down hard . If they get a good , solid grip on you , you might shock yourself . And if the person is wearing a heavy-duty leather jacket , and especially if they ' re big and strong , there ' s a strong chance you won ' t be able to debilitate them. &quot; * Noise Alarms . These devices produce an ear-splitting noise designed to sound an alarm and frighten an assailant . They can be carried in a pocket or purse , attached_to a belt loop or worn around the wrist . Some will not stop until deactivated by a private code . Prices start at about $ 17 . &quot; The whole idea with the noise alarm is to get someone ' s attention , &quot; Jackson says . &quot; If you ' re in a mall parking_lot where they could hear and come_to your aid , it ' s a great system . But if you ' re in a subterranean garage at 9 or 10 at night all by yourself , who ' s going_to hear you ? &quot; &quot; They have limited effectiveness , &quot; West agrees . &quot; How much attention do you pay to car alarms ? Is it better than nothing ? Sure . But we don ' t consider it the be-all and end-all . The better ones have a nifty little clip ( that ) attaches_to the outside of a purse . It ' s real easy to activate. &quot; * Foam dyes . Aiming and spraying the contents of a canister can turn an assailant ' s skin a different color . The device can be carried in a pocket or purse , or clipped to a pocket or waistband . One brand , Dye Witness , sells in one store for $ 45 . &quot; This is a more benign version of Mace , &quot; West says . &quot; It comes_out in a big goopy mess . It will make a Martian out of your crook . It usually lasts a while as well . I have the same issue with it as any of these devices : Are you ready to use it ? It may be difficult because there ' s no required training. &quot; Says Clark : &quot; I don ' t think it ' s going_to deter a rapist that much . If an individual is bent_on serious crime , there is nothing in this device ( that ) induces a form of pain or a deterrent. &quot; &quot; Since it has no debilitating effect , you might make someone real mad at you and increase their assaultive behavior , &quot; Jackson says . &quot; So I don ' t see this as a real good preventive device . I see it as an outstanding way of identifying and capturing a suspect. &quot; * * Smell Repellent . These ampuls , manufactured by KBA Inc. in Atlanta under the brand name Rapel , contain a foul-smelling fluid originally designed to help oil_companies find leaks in pipes . Squeeze the ampul , and a glass bubble breaks and releases the stench on your skin , making you repulsive to attackers . The tiny device , just over an inch long and the size of a pencil , can be clipped to a bra strap . Men can wear it on underclothes or on the back of a tie . Available by mail_order for $ 19.95 plus shipping and handling . &quot; I think they would be of limited use , &quot; West says . &quot; If somebody wants you or your money and they ' re high on drugs , they ' re going to take what they want . They ' re not going_to leave you alone just because you smell bad. &quot; &quot; I don ' t see any debilitating effect from this device that would drive the assailant away , &quot; Jackson says . &quot; The odor might cause some criminals to run_away but others to get mad at you . I don ' t have any personal familiarity with this device , but those are my opinions. &quot; Experts say no matter what product a consumer buys , good preventive techniques are most important in foiling crime . &quot; Our strong position is that you can avoid the vast majority of problems that you get_into by employing good crime prevention techniques and thus not having to rely_on these devices , &quot; West says . These techniques start with being alert . &quot; The robber typically avoids people who are alert , &quot; says USC professor Marcus Felson , a specialist in criminology . It ' s also important to appear confident . &quot; that ' s readable by people , &quot; Jackson says . &quot; Sometimes that ' s enough to keep people from going_forward with an assault. &quot;</TEXT>
