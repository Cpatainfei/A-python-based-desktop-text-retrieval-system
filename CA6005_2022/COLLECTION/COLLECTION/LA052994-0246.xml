   <HEADLINE> BLOOD_BANKS ' TEST REJECTION CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The American Red_Cross and other blood-bank groups refused to adopt a screening test in January , 1983 , publicly contending there was no hard evidence people could get AIDS from transfusions . But internal documents show Red_Cross officials acknowledged that the disease could be transmitted through blood . The nation ' s three major blood collectors -- the Red_Cross , the American Assn . of Blood_Banks and the Council of Community Blood Centers -- said in a joint public statement on Jan . 13 , 1983 : &quot; The presently available medical and scientific evidence that AIDS can be spread by blood components remains incomplete . . . . We do not advise routine implementation of any laboratory screening program for AIDS by blood_banks at this time. &quot; The groups refused to adopt the test for hepatitis_B , a surrogate test that Centers_for_Disease_Control officials said could have been in place by March , 1983 . The current AIDS or HIV test hadn ' t been developed yet , but nearly all AIDS patients -- homosexual men , hemophiliacs and intravenous drug_users -- also had suffered from hepatitis_B at some time and produced antibodies to fight it that stayed in their blood . The blood_groups maintained that the test was too expensive , that it would produce a_million false positives , and that there was no hard evidence that people could get AIDS from transfusions , despite CDC officials ' assertions that the disease posed a serious threat to the blood supply . Privately , however , officials at the Red_Cross believed that AIDS could be transmitted through blood , according to internal documents obtained by the Associated Press . Paul Cumming , the Red_Cross planning and marketing manager , wrote in an internal memo : &quot; The available evidence strongly suggests that AIDS is transmissible &quot; through blood . &quot; As time goes_on we are liable to get more and more pressure to utilize &quot; blood_tests and donor screening . &quot; CDC increasingly needs a major epidemic to justify its existence , &quot; Cumming wrote a colleague on Feb . 5 , 1983 . &quot; To the extent the ( blood ) industry . . . sticks_together against CDC , it will appear to some segments of the public , at least , that we have a self-interest which is in conflict with the public interest , unless we can clearly demonstrate that CDC is wrong , &quot; Cumming wrote . &quot; In the short run , our position has all_the earmarks of a lose-lose one . The question would seem to be , how do we minimize the short-run loss and hopefully gain in the long_run ? &quot; In one document , Cumming did a cost-benefit_analysis and assigned a $ 500 # 000 value to each transfusion recipient who would be protected from AIDS by the blood_test . The memos are among thousands of pages of documents that , at the Red_Cross ' s request , were placed under protective orders by judges in various transfusion cases . The orders prohibit public disclosure of the documents , but the AP obtained them privately from sources familiar_with the issue . The CDC estimates that 6 # 567 Americans have developed AIDS from transfusions since 1981 . Only 29 of those cases were caused by transfusions received after March , 1985 , when blood_banks nationwide voluntarily began using a new HIV test . HIV , or Human Immunodeficiency Virus , was discovered as the cause of AIDS in 1984 . The CDC said it doesn ' t know how many of the 6 # 567 have died of AIDS or how many other people are HIV-positive as a result of transfusions but haven ' t yet developed AIDS . Cumming , in a recent telephone_interview , rejected any second-guessing of his actions . &quot; Given the same information , the same environment at that time , I don ' t see that we made any mistakes . . . . There was no scientific evidence , &quot; said Cumming , a statistician who now does consulting work for the Red_Cross and federal agencies . &quot; We made the best decisions it was possible to make. &quot; Cumming said the hepatitis_B blood_test &quot; was not a good test , by any criteria I know for a test &quot; because it would have produced 1 million false positives . The Red_Cross , which takes donations through its 45 blood services regions , is custodian of half the nation ' s blood supply and sells blood and its components to about 3 # 000 hospitals . Questioned recently , the Red_Cross said the effectiveness of the hepatitis_B blood_test was &quot; an open question &quot; in 1983 . &quot; Had there been evidence indicating the efficacy of any surrogate test , the Red_Cross would have implemented it , &quot; the organization said in a statement . The Red_Cross noted that its blood_banks began in 1983 asking homosexual men with multiple partners not to donate blood . It started using direct questioning of potential donors in January , 1991 . Because AIDS takes an average of seven years to develop , many victims have only recently discovered their illness from infected transfusions or clotting factor they received between March , 1983 and March , 1985 . Clotting factor is a concentrate of blood from hundreds of donors which hemophiliacs inject to stem uncontrolled bleeding . Victims and their families have filed an estimated 500 lawsuits around the nation against hospitals , the Red_Cross and other blood_banks , according to Lawrence Gostin , a professor at Georgetown University Law Center . Nearly all_the cases have been settled out of court . &quot; The misery that was promulgated by this benign inaction killed thousands of people , &quot; said Dr. Donald Francis , who was an expert on epidemics and AIDS at the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control in the 1980s . Now a research official at Genentech Inc. in San Francisco , Francis sometimes testifies as an expert witness for plaintiffs in AIDS transfusion suits . &quot; Here was a group of certainly not evil people , who thought they were doing the right thing . . . who got caught_up in a force that was anti-CDC , anti-action , &quot; Francis said in a telephone_interview . Dr. Gerald Sandler , a Red_Cross official , publicly criticized a CDC study in early 1984 that warned of the risks of AIDS-tainted transfusions . But in an internal memo , Sandler told a colleague in January , 1984 : &quot; Problems related to transfusion-associated AIDS are increasing and require resolution . . . . No clear plan has been developed by the national blood-collection organizations to counter the increasingly apparent risk of ( AIDS from transfusions ) which , potentially , threatens all persons. &quot; Asked about the memo , Sandler , now director of blood_donor services at Georgetown University Medical_Center , said it was &quot; an internal attempt to look as open-mindedly as possible on an issue. &quot; The documents also show that one of the Red_Cross ' s blood services regions , based in San Jose , Calif. , rejected the national organization ' s official policy against the hepatitis_B test . Dr. Pearl Toy , then director of regional blood services for the San Jose region , wrote in March , 1984 , to Sandler , who was associate director for medical and laboratory services at the Washington headquarters : &quot; A clear consensus was developed at our medical advisory committee_meeting on March 24 , 1984 , to perform ( hepatitis_B antibody ) testing in our region. &quot; A later memo shows that testing began in June , 1984 .</TEXT>
