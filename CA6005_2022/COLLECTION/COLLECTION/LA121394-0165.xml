   <HEADLINE> FAA IS SEEKING SAFETY CZAR TO HELP PREVENT ACCIDENTS ; AVIATION : AGENCY ' S SLOWNESS TO ACT UNDERSCORES NEED FOR REFORM . ONE STEP IS APPOINTMENT OF IN-HOUSE MONITOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fourteen years ago , the government ' s air safety experts first noted that many passengers involved in small airplane crashes lived through the impact but died in subsequent fire and explosions . To give passengers more time to escape and survive such crashes , the National Transportation Safety Board on Sept . 9 , 1980 , recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration require crash-resistant fuel_lines and fuel tanks on commuter planes . Agreeing the recommendation had merit , the FAA launched a study . Then it launched another study . And another . But no definitive action was taken . When the NTSB convenes today in Washington to discuss last April ' s crash of a commuter airplane in Connecticut , it will take_up the issue of crash-resistant fuel_systems in small aircraft . Again . &quot; This is one of the oldest recommendations on the books , &quot; said Barry M . Sweedler , the NTSB ' s director of safety recommendations . &quot; Back in 1980 , we asked_for some simple , logical things -- to us -- that the FAA could do &quot; to make these kinds of crashes survivable , Sweedler said . &quot; And here the issue has emerged again. &quot; Last April 27 , a twin-engine plane overshot an airport runway and crashed through a fence_in Stratford , Conn . All nine people aboard the Piper Navaho survived the impact . But eight of them perished when the plane exploded seconds later . The ninth person , Paul Hagopian , suffered burns to half his body . The pilot ' s last words to the passengers , according to Hagopian : &quot; Don ' t worry . It ' s all right. &quot; To aviation safety experts , the FAA ' s handling of the fuel_system issue underscores the need to restructure the nation ' s airline regulatory_agency and establish the equivalent of an in-house safety czar , an observation first made six years ago by a special presidential commission on air safety . While FAA Administrator David Hinson says safety is everybody ' s main concern at the agency , he too acknowledges that the FAA needs a high-ranking official whose sole responsibility is to monitor safety issues and shepherd them through the bureaucracy . In an interview with The Times , Hinson said the FAA plans to compile a computer_database from airlines , manufacturers and other sectors of the air_travel industry to set_up an early_warning_system that will help identify potential hazards before they become accidents . Critics have long held that the FAA does not lend enough credence to anecdotal accounts of potential problems , service difficulty reports and near-crashes , which air safety experts believe can portend future accidents . &quot; If you keep score by accidents only , a bald tire is safe until the blowout , &quot; said former NTSB official Ira J . Furman . &quot; The tire is ' safe ' no matter how thin the rubber. &quot; Hinson said he has launched a search for an individual to take_over a newly created systems safety office within the FAA . &quot; I ' m doing a very careful search for the right person for that job , &quot; said Hinson , adding that the person who fills the safety job will report directly to him . &quot; It ' s supposed to help me see problems before they happen. &quot; Creation of the new systems safety office comes four months after a joint investigation by the U.S. Department_of_Transportation and the FAA concluded that the agency did not have the proper procedures in place to ensure that safety concerns are acted_upon in a timely manner . Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena and Hinson had ordered the internal review in mid-June after a series of reports in The Times indicated that the FAA knew about the potential danger of Boeing 757 wake turbulence long before two crashes that claimed 13 lives , including a 1993 accident in Santa Ana that killed the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger chain and three others . &quot; One of the reasons the President asked me to take this job dealt directly with flight safety , &quot; said Hinson , whose appointment to the top post in the FAA was confirmed in August , 1993 . &quot; Our objective is to get zero defects. &quot; Hinson acknowledges he faces a &quot; formidable &quot; task . A four-month Times review of government documents showed that in some cases years have passed and hundreds of lives have been lost before the FAA acted_on safety problems , such_as the 757 turbulence issue , even though the agency had long been aware of the hazards . &quot; that ' s one of the things I ' m trying to address , &quot; Hinson said . &quot; I ' m sure there are some examples where the FAA was slow to react. &quot; Once the new safety chief is in place , &quot; Hopefully , ( with ) things like the 757 wake turbulence , somebody can say , ' Here ' s a trend . . . maybe we ought to get_into this. ' &quot; The idea of an FAA safety chief was proposed in 1988 by a seven-member Aviation Safety Commission . The commission , which was established by Congress and appointed by President Ronald Reagan , recommended that the FAA be made an independent agency with a &quot; safety czar &quot; to oversee regulation of the airline industry . The commission said the restructuring was necessary &quot; to act_on the backlog of potentially worthwhile safety improvements that have been languishing. &quot; Over the last six years , the Government Accounting Office , the Department_of_Transportation ' s inspector_general and the Office of Technology Assessment have reached similar conclusions . Some congressional officials have suggested that the nation ' s skies would be safer and more efficient if the day-to-day air traffic_control operations were taken_away from the FAA so it can focus_on airline surveillance and safety issues . There have been numerous suggestions on how to restructure the FAA ' s responsibilities , including one from the Clinton_Administration that would privatize the air-traffic system . Under the proposal , a corporation , known as the Air Traffic_Control Corp. , would oversee air traffic , while the FAA would be free to deal with safety and airline regulation . To make a significant difference , observers agree , Hinson ' s new safety chief must be shielded from operational worries , such_as airport capacity . Critics believe there are times when safety has taken a back seat to such issues . When the FAA considered whether to require more landing distance between Boeing 757 jetliners and planes following behind them , the agency calculated how many flight reductions could result from any measures it might take . At the heart of such calculations lies the FAA ' s sometimes conflicting mandates : to ensure the welfare of the flying public but also to nurture the economic welfare of the aviation industry . &quot; We should define promoting aviation as fostering safety , &quot; said Hugh E . Waterman , who worked for the FAA for 27 years before retiring in 1986 . &quot; that ' s the best -- and only -- way the FAA should be promoting aviation. &quot; In striking the balance between economics and safety , the &quot; fulcrum is placed too close to the economic side of the equation , &quot; said former NTSB Chairman James E . Burnett Jr . A safety chief accountable to the FAA administrator would provide &quot; checks and balances within the FAA , &quot; Burnett said . &quot; The image of a vigilant FAA is as important to the industry as the image of the Boeing Co. , &quot; he said . Scores of air safety experts interviewed by The Times , including past and present FAA officials , agreed that having someone within the FAA with the authority to ferret_out potential safety problems and the power to act_on them could be the one change that would significantly reduce the delays in acting_upon safety issues . &quot; You need dedicated , continuous follow-up on issues , &quot; the NTSB ' s Sweedler said . &quot; I ' ve been in this business 25 years , and I cannot recall any accident that has not happened before if you look_back far enough and dig deep enough. &quot; Other potential safety reforms that emerged during The Times review : * Amend a law that requires the FAA to perform lengthy , cost-benefit_analysis when it wants to make changes in regulations . &quot; The safety professionals in the FAA really are committed , dedicated people , &quot; said Rep . James L . Oberstar ( D-Minn. ) , outgoing chairman of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation ' s subcommittee on aviation . &quot; But they ' re in the trenches , dodging regulatory bullets , trying to cover their tracks , and document and substantiate everything they propose . &quot; There ' s safety , but then it ' s ' What about the cost ? What about the industry ? ' &quot; * Simplify the regulation process . Once the FAA decides to seek a regulation change on a safety issue and completes a cost-benefit_analysis showing how many people can be saved and at what cost to industry , the proposal must pass_through a legislative labyrinth . The proposed change first goes_to the secretary_of_Transportation , then to the Office of Management and Budget , then back to the Transportation_secretary and finally back to the FAA . At any point along the way , it can be &quot; massaged , &quot; forcing the process to virtually begin again . &quot; Safety should not be conducted this way , &quot; said Oberstar , who has been holding oversight hearings on the FAA for a decade . * Catalogue , monitor and scrutinize service difficulty reports , non-fatal incidents , anecdotal accounts of problems from pilots and air traffic controllers , and near-crashes to identify trends and potential safety hazards . And rely less on thinking that there needs to be an accident to show there ' s a problem . An April , 1994 , report by DOT ' s inspector_general concluded that FAA had &quot; no formal system . . . to ensure aircraft problems do not fall_into a ' black hole. ' &quot; Following the March , 1992 , crash of a jetliner at La Guardia Airport in New York -- one in a series of fatal crashes that prompted changes in the way the wings of commercial jets are de-iced before takeoff -- the FAA said there wasn ' t an urgent need to enact such measures for air taxis and commuter planes because those kinds of aircraft had not experienced near as_many similar accidents . In response to the FAA ' s stance , the Air Line Pilots Assn . said in a letter , &quot; This is a dangerous philosophy and suggests that the FAA measures the need for safety improvements against the number of accidents and fatalities before they can justify improvements. &quot; * Be less rigid about past positions on safety issues . Aviation experts both within and outside the FAA say the agency hierarchy sometimes clings too strongly to positions it has staked out -- even in the face of compelling evidence . &quot; If they adopt an improper policy , they ' re very reluctant to change their stand &quot; because they fear the public will perceive a mistake was made originally , said one FAA manager . * Ensure more stable leadership . There have been six FAA administrators in the past 13 years . It ' s an appointed position , and some experts and legislators have suggested that it be transformed into a five- or seven-year term . What both the FAA and its critics agree upon is that the agency cannot stand_still on safety . Even if the accident rate was to remain constant , the sheer number of commercial airline flights is increasing so rapidly that there will be more crashes more frequently in the not-too-distant future , industry experts predict . That is a scenario frightening to all . &quot; It ' s important that the government does anything it can to prevent these kinds of things , &quot; said Michele Mikuta of Cos Cob , Conn . Her husband , Thomas , was killed in the March , 1992 , crash at La Guardia . After the accident , which killed 27 people , the FAA acted to prevent such crashes . But records show it had been known for years that the type of plane involved in the accident was particularly susceptible to having ice accumulate on its wings , robbing the plane of crucial lift on takeoff . Said Mikuta , who is raising her and her husband ' s two young children alone : &quot; I never want this kind of thing to happen to anyone else. &quot; Times researcher Sheila A . Kern and special correspondent Shelby Grad contributed to this story . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) How the Study Was Conducted To complete this report , The Times reviewed about 20 # 000 pages of internal documents obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration through the Freedom of Information Act . The newspaper also reviewed a computer analysis of the causes of airplane crashes between 1983 and last July by the National Transportation Safety Board . The Times also studied dozens of reports by government oversight agencies and interviewed scores of present and past FAA officials , airline industry sources , aviation safety experts , members of Congress , crash survivors and the families of crash victims . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Safety Board ' s Priorities Earlier this year , the National Transportation Safety Board released a &quot; Most Wanted &quot; list of air safety recommendations . Here are the four items discussed : * Develop ways to avoid runway collisions , including use of new runway lights and signs . * Require more structural fatigue tests for new aircraft . * Make technical changes to brake-wear tests for aircraft . * Add collision-avoidance system known as Mode C Intruder Alert to radar used by many airports .
