   <HEADLINE> JUNIOR NAGS ; KIDS ARE ALL OVER THEIR PARENTS TO QUIT KILLING THEMSELVES WITH CIGARETTES . THE PRESSURE IS_ON FOR ADULTS TO DO AS THEY SAY , REPORT O.C. TEACHERS AND FORMER SMOKERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Craig Stubbs , a Westminster contractor , was a two-pack-a-day smoker , but he had no cigarette lighted when his young son walked into his office at_home . &quot; I would always try to hide smoking from him , &quot; Stubbs recalls . What happened next changed Stubbs ' life . His son Ben , not yet 5 years old , asked_for his father ' s attention . When he was sure he had it , he spoke &quot; with a genuine seriousness and a staunch resolve , &quot; his father recalls . It was a confrontation . &quot; He said , ' Quit smoking ; it ' s bad for you. ' He said smoking is incredibly damaging and I was not going_to have the privilege of enjoying him if I kept this up . &quot; I was startled , &quot; Stubbs says . &quot; It was quite a shock. &quot; So what did Stubbs do ? &quot; Well , I quit . Right then . I did not smoke again . I ' d tried to quit several times before , but this time I didn ' t go back. &quot; He felt guilty , says his wife , Ember . &quot; He just felt terrible and had to quit . Ben is not a kid of many words , but what he does say means quite a lot. &quot; His father has been off tobacco for nearly eight years , but Ben Stubbs , now 12 , is still worried about smoking . Last year he drew an anti-smoking poster that won a contest run_by Orange County ' s cancer , heart and lung associations . The design has been printed on 30 # 000 textbook covers that were distributed to all Orange County sixth-graders . But Ben ' s anti-smoking bent is hardly unique . He ' s one of a generation of kids targeted years ago by anti-smoking forces to become the Smoke-Free Class of 2000 . Each year since kindergarten , they have received anti-smoking lectures and materials in school to stiffen them against pressures to smoke during adolescence , the time when most smokers start . Success or failure is still several years off , but the byproduct has already surfaced : a corps of youthful tobacco rangers taking the anti-smoking assault home . Now for parents who smoke , the most feared question is not &quot; How did the baby get_in there ? &quot; It ' s , &quot; If smoking is bad for me , why do you do_it ? &quot; &quot; Kids have always nagged their parents about this , &quot; says Keith Pendell , a La Habra High_School teacher who designs anti-smoking programs nationwide . &quot; I used to hound my dad to quit . Then I started and he got_on my case . &quot; But these kids now know the harmful effects of smoking more so then we did . We grew_up with dancing cigarettes on TV . It wasn ' t really a health issue. &quot; The effect of the tobacco rangers can be seen in smoking-cessation classes countywide . Adults seeking help for alcoholism or obesity rarely report pressure from their school-age children , authorities say . But between 50 % and 75 % of adults in no-smoking classes say they enrolled because their children pressured them , according to local instructors . &quot; These children are afraid they are going_to be abandoned because of awareness of what tobacco is going_to do to their parents , &quot; Pendell says . &quot; It ' s a very important motivation for parents to quit. &quot; Some , such_as Stubbs , throw_in_the_towel immediately . &quot; I only had one cigarette after that -- a Salem . But I ' d just been shot in a hunting accident. &quot; Others try to bob and weave and encounter a sometimes extraordinary persistence . &quot; I ' ve heard people say their kids hide their ( parents ' ) cigarettes , &quot; said Donna Gordon , a former smoker who conducts a quit-smoking class at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach . &quot; My kids would break my cigarettes . that ' s pretty common. &quot; Many parents say they ' ll quit , then smoke outside the house , regardless of the weather , says Rita Freese of Orange , another no-smoking instructor . &quot; They feel kind of stupid doing_it , but they do_it . They don ' t want to smoke in front of their kids. &quot; In some instances , the reversal of roles is so complete that parents genuinely fear being caught smoking by their children . &quot; My wife smokes , OK ? &quot; says Jim , a respiratory therapist from Orange County who would rather not give his surname . &quot; And my son ( age 14 ) , little by little he starts getting really , really upset : ' I can ' t stand the smoke , ' ' I know you ' re smoking in the morning ; I can smell it in my room , ' ' You better quit ; you ' re gonna get cancer and die and leave me , and if I ever see you smoke another cigarette I ' m gonna run_away from home. ' &quot; He ' s genuinely upset . His grandfather died who he was really close to , and his grandmother died . And then his uncle died . Any more deaths in the family would be real , real hard for him to handle . &quot; So my wife would cough once in a while , and he ' d say , ' You ' re coughing ! You have cancer ! ' She did have a chronic cough , and I was concerned about that . But you can ' t tell your wife , ' You can ' t do that anymore. ' She ' d just laugh . I didn ' t say anything about it . I let him do it. &quot; And he did , relentlessly , Jim says . She would go outside and smoke , not out of consideration but because &quot; she didn ' t want any more ( talk ) from my son . She just basically got_to the point where she had to quit. &quot; It has been hard but she has been successful so far , Jim says . Even so , &quot; as soon as she comes_home from work , he checks her out . He smells her breath. &quot; For harassed smoking parents , there is a dark side and a bright_side to this , says Dr. Justin D . Call , chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at the UC Irvine College of Medicine . The dark side : &quot; There ' s another group of kids afraid to bring_up the subject , even though they ' re upset . They don ' t say a word . Their fear stems from embarrassing or depreciating their parents , because they ' ve heard their parents depreciate these ( anti-smoking ) efforts. &quot; The bright_side : &quot; If your kid ' s on your case , be happy he ' s well-adjusted . The more mature parents should tell their children they ' re glad to hear they understand , and they hope they never take_up smoking because it ' s certainly a burden on them . This does not destroy their authority with the child . Kids should be complimented for their sound judgment. &quot; What is at_work , Call says , is genuine fear . Children begin talking_about the concept of death as early as age 5 , &quot; but they don ' t start understanding it until about 10 years of_age . So around that time , when death has a sense of finality , they become quite concerned. &quot; Children talk_about such things among themselves , Call says . But at this age , they think &quot; categorically rather than theoretically . That is , they hear a single bad story about someone dying of cancer because of smoking , and that ' s all_the proof they need to become very concerned. &quot; As adolescents , about half of them will be capable of making fine distinctions , such_as heavy smoking being more dangerous than occasional smoking . But until then , it ' s simple : Mommy + Cigarettes = Dead Mommy . Added_to this is the authority of the teacher , who is &quot; their expert on the outside world. &quot; &quot; It ' s interesting . Children of doctors should realize their parents know more_than their teachers about the human_body and disease and procreation . But many of them don ' t believe it until the teacher says so. &quot; So when the powerful smoking-is-dangerous message comes from such authority , it might as well be chiseled onto stone tablets . Adele Quenzler , a volunteer for the local American Cancer Society unit , remembers lecturing a class of elementary_school pupils in Garden Grove , &quot; and they were so attentive and receptive . They were really alarmed and wanted more information : ' What can we do ? Where are the classes ? ' They were not ill_at_ease with the subject at all. &quot; And so an assault on the evil habit that threatens their parents with death is a logical and natural result , Call says . With so_much at stake in the children ' s eyes , parents should not be surprised by their urgency and persistence . &quot; It ' s not unhealthy to wage a persistent campaign at_home about this . This is not a sign of neurotic difficulty in the child . The child is only objecting to what the parents are denying , the dangers of smoking . &quot; If he approaches in a reasonable , consistent and persistent way , you know his knowledge is sound and secure and also based in sympathy and understanding of addiction . You know that his thinking about the problem is really advanced . He understands something about the problem and the addiction. &quot; The irony is that often these tobacco rangers , after hectoring their parents into giving_up the weed , begin smoking in adolescence . &quot; This is more complicated , &quot; Call says . &quot; There is a peer_group to deal with . And smoking is a valuable asset for many adolescents who want to assert their independence in a purely symbolic way. &quot; Some adolescents may still be unable to visualize abstract issues . If so , they literally cannot imagine the bad effects of smoking applying to them until they actually happen . &quot; They can smoke , but they can also deny that it affects them personally , &quot; Call says . &quot; They can disregard all_the consequences for them . &quot; Some remain in this mode of thinking for life . But until then , many are soldiers of the cause , and an amazing number are successful , says Sal Garcia , coordinator of tobacco education for the Garden Grove Unified School District . &quot; About the sixth grade , they ' ve gotten the message , and they carry it to the parents for us . Kids get hard to deal with about then . That , plus they ' re hassling you to quit smoking ? Imagine it ! &quot; Jim doesn ' t have to imagine it . The smoke of battle between his son and wife has cleared , but the war apparently isn ' t over . &quot; He started hitting on us because he didn ' t like the smell of coffee in the morning . I said , ' Hey , too_bad . Close your door , man , because that ' s not gonna stop. ' What is this ? &quot;</TEXT>
