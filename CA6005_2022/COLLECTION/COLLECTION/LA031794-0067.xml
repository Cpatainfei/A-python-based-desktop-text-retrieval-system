   <HEADLINE> SAUDIS , IRANIANS AT_ODDS OVER OIL PRICES , PILGRIMAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Relations between Saudi_Arabia and Iran took a turn for the worse Wednesday when Saudi_Arabia reacted sharply to criticism by Iran ' s spiritual_leader , suggesting new tension between the two Persian_Gulf oil giants . In an official statement , Saudi_Arabia accused Iran ' s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of irresponsibility for charging that Saudi_Arabia was hindering Iranians ' pilgrimage to Muslim holy sites in the kingdom . Diplomats said the new war of words could mark the end of a period of cool but correct relations between the two neighbors . They attributed the current tension to the failure of the two nations to agree on how to maintain stability in the region and how to shore_up weak world oil prices . The latest dispute , over how many Iranians should be allowed to attend this year ' s pilgrimage in Saudi_Arabia , came amid signs that Riyadh is losing patience with Tehran ' s apparent inability to deliver on promises of political moderation . Saudi_Arabia believes radicals are undermining the pragmatism promised by President Hashemi Rafsanjani . Riyadh also believes Iran is meddling in its neighbors ' affairs and supporting Muslim fundamentalists in Arab countries such_as Algeria , Egypt and Sudan .</TEXT>
