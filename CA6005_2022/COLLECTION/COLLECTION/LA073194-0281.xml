   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; CLINTON ' S SEARCH FOR A FOREIGN ECONOMIC_POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eighteen months and two G-7 Summits into his Administration , President Bill_Clinton has yet to implement a strategy of trade , investment and exchange-rate policies that ef fectively promote U.S. interests in the international economic arena . Instead , the Administration ' s international economic_policies seem confused , even schizophrenic . Its uncertain signals seem to reflect a mixed mind about the value of free_trade and investment . True , two of the Administration ' s most noteworthy successes -- passing the North_American Free_Trade Agreement and concluding the Uruguay Round of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- reflect firm free_trade principles . Both initiatives , however , were begun and brought_to near-fruition by Republican Administrations . In contrast , the Administration ' s own policies -- especially those leading to near-crises with Japan on trade and China over most-favored-nation status -- suggest a less-than-steadfast belief in economic liberalism and a dangerous tendency to look_at everything through the prism of domestic politics . The fate of the Administration ' s first major free-trade initiative of its own devising -- the &quot; Open Markets 2000 &quot; proposal offered at the recent Naples Summit -- has not enhanced its credibility . The initiative would have committed G-7 leaders to build_on the achievements of the Uruguay Round by further expanding trade and investment . But the manner in which the Administration put_forward the initiative -- at the last minute and with poor coordination -- undermined its seriousness and ensured its rejection by the other G-7 governments . International financial markets also have trouble taking the Administration ' s rhetoric seriously . The current dollar crisis , for example , was triggered , at least in part , by Administration signals that it was prepared to drive down the dollar to &quot; punish &quot; Tokyo for its recalcitrance in trade talks . Attempting damage_control , Clinton declared in Naples , &quot; No one has tried to talk_down the market. &quot; The markets , unfortunately , knew better . It will take more_than mere declarations to restore the Administration ' s international economic credibility . Rather , it will require a practical , multipart strategy aimed at reasserting international economic leadership : Pass GATT . The Administration cannot blithely assume congressional passage of the GATT agreement by the Jan . 1 , 1995 deadline set_in Naples . Powerful environmental and labor lobbies oppose it . Identifying budget_cuts to offset the estimated $ 12-billion loss in tariff revenues over the next five years makes GATT ratification a potentially contentious legislative issue . Senate Finance Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) has publicly chided the Administration for dragging its feet . Given the Administration ' s ambitious legislative agenda , including health-care and welfare reform , it will require discipline -- not this Administration ' s forte -- to ensure passage on_time . Once GATT passes , however , the Administration can and should reintroduce its Open Markets 2000 proposal , perhaps at this fall ' s Washington meeting of G-7 ministers . Stop publicly bashing Japan . The Administration ' s hard-line stance toward trade with Japan did much to cause the current collapse of the dollar . Dismissing the crisis as a &quot; problem with the yen , &quot; as some in the Administration have , will do little to ease it . Given the magnitude of the U.S.-Japanese economic relationship , there is no such thing as a &quot; dollar problem &quot; -- or a &quot; yen problem. &quot; But there is a &quot; dollar and yen &quot; problem that can only be resolved by negotiation . Pressuring Japan to open its markets and stimulate consumption must remain top U.S. goals . Our negotiating positions must be tough -- but are only effective if pushed privately . Instead of grabbing headlines by publicly pillorying Japan , the Administration should pursue a longer-term strategy of negotiation and sustained support for powerful reform forces within Japan itself . Expand trade and investment regionally . The Administration should build_on NAFTA and the Bush_Administration ' s Enterprise for the Americas Initiative to move toward a truly hemispheric free-trade zone . Argentina and Chile are both suitable candidates for free-trade agreements . But U.S. regional trade initiatives should not be limited to our own hemisphere . Free-trade agreements with Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic would not only bolster the cause of reform in three of the former Soviet bloc ' s &quot; success stories &quot; but open_up a growing market of 60-million consumers to U.S. goods and services . Finally , the President should also use the forum for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation , a Bush initiative , to intensify our relationship with dynamic Pacific Rim countries . The development of an investment code for APEC members should be a high priority . Keep_an_eye_on the European Union . European economic union , despite dislocations caused by German reunification , is by no means dead . Some form of monetary union containing , at a minimum , Germany and several other EU members is likely to emerge in the next few years . It is important for the United States to begin talks aimed at ensuring that monetary union enhances rather than erodes the potential for U.S.-European economic coordination . Even in the mid-1980s , when I was Treasury_secretary , the European system of closely aligned exchange_rates complicated policy coordination between the United States and major European economies , especially Germany . Full monetary union , particularly one requiring unanimity among member governments for exchange or interest_rate adjustments , could make coordination more problematic . Focus less on the dollar , more on fundamentals . Intervention by central_banks in currency markets can be useful in promoting exchange_rate stability -- but only in conjunction with closer coordination of economic fundamentals , such_as fiscal and monetary policy , by the major economies . This was the lesson of 1985-88 , when the G-7 achieved levels of cooperation not attained before or since . But macroeconomic coordination does not just happen -- it requires firm and patient U.S. leadership to achieve it . To date , the centerpiece of Clinton ' s international economic_policy is NAFTA . Ironically , the President carried the day because of the support of 132 House Republicans . Only 102 of 278 Democrats backed him in the cause of liberalization . Like the Administration itself , the Democratic Party seems to be of two minds when it comes_to free_trade . The President may have to turn_to Republicans again if he is to pursue an ambitious but achievable international economic agenda . This will require him to come_down firmly , one way or the other , on free_trade and open investment . But coming_down firmly is not something that comes easily to the Clinton_Administration . Like its policies on Haiti or Bosnia , the Administration ' s approach to international economics has too often been a public-relations exercise in trying to have it both ways. *</TEXT>
