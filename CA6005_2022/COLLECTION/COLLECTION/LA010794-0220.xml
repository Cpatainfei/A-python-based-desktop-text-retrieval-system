   <HEADLINE> MICHAEL JACKSON SHARES WHITNEY HOUSTON ' S SPOTLIGHT ; HONORS : HOUSTON WINS FIVE NAACP IMAGE AWARDS , BUT JACKSON GETS CHEERS IN A SHOW MARKED BY CONTROVERSY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was Whitney Houston ' s night , but Michael Jackson dominated the 26th annual NAACP Image Awards with a five-minute speech of_his_own before presenting Debbie Allen with a choreography award . Jackson received a standing_ovation from the audience gathered at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium Wednesday night and had to pause several times during his remarks to let the cheers from the audience subside . After thanking the crowd several times , Jackson made a brief but forceful statement : &quot; Everyone is presumed_to be innocent and totally innocent until charged with a crime and then convicted by a jury of their peers . . . . Not only am I presumed_to be innocent , I am innocent. &quot; Jackson has been accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy , but criminal charges have yet to be filed . Early in the show , one presenter included Jackson in a list of names , calling him &quot; Michael ( Innocent Until Proven Guilty ) Jackson. &quot; Houston won four awards -- for best female artist , music video , album and soundtrack album -- in addition to her previously announced Entertainer of the Year award . Houston ' s mother , gospel singer Cissy Houston , and brother Gary received a standing_ovation for their rendition of &quot; Amazing Grace , &quot; sung in tribute to Houston ' s special award as Entertainer of the Year , which was presented by actor Denzel Washington . * Controversy was the byword of the evening , with Fox TV_star Martin Lawrence winning both outstanding actor in a comedy series and outstanding comedy series for &quot; Martin , &quot; which has been criticized for its sexual high_jinks . Lawrence obliquely defended both himself and another nominee , rapper Tupac Shakur , when he repeated parts of his acceptance speech in the pressroom , saying , &quot; We come_down on a lot of the young people . . . just for speaking what people have lived. &quot; The National Political Congress of Black_Women had accused the NAACP of sexism for not withdrawing Shakur ' s nomination for outstanding lead actor in a motion_picture ( for his role in John Singleton ' s &quot; Poetic Justice &quot; ) . Shakur has been charged with felony counts of forcible sodomy and unlawful detainment in New York City , where a woman alleges that Shakur and two other men held her down in a hotel_room while a fourth man sodomized her . Shakur was also charged with two counts of aggravated assault in an unrelated incident in which he allegedly shot and wounded two off-duty police_officers . Several celebrities were visibly annoyed by the press ' s questions about Shakur , and it was stressed several times that Shakur has only been charged with , not convicted of , the crimes . &quot; These people are innocent until proven guilty , &quot; said Jasmine Guy , winner of outstanding actress in a comedy series ( for &quot; A Different World &quot; ) . Guy demanded of one reporter if she had actually heard Shakur ' s music and , when the reporter said no , said , &quot; Come back and ask me those questions when you have. &quot; Fox TV_star Sinbad impishly leaned forward when he had to return backstage and said to the press , &quot; Too_bad I couldn ' t get the Tupac question. &quot; The award for best actor went_to Denzel Washington for his role in &quot; Malcolm X. &quot; &quot; Malcolm X , &quot; which itself was an object of controversy at last year ' s Academy Awards when it was nominated for just two Oscars -- for best actor and best costume design -- received awards in every category in which it was nominated , including outstanding motion_picture . In addition , the award for outstanding literary_work , nonfiction , went_to &quot; By Any Means Necessary : The Trials and Tribulations of the Making of ' Malcolm X , ' &quot; by director Spike Lee with Ralph Wiley .
