   <HEADLINE> CARTER ANNOUNCES BOSNIA CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT ; BALKANS : TRUCE BEGINS FRIDAY , HE SAYS AFTER SHAKY START WITH REBEL SERBS . DIPLOMATS REMAIN SKEPTICAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led Bosnian government have agreed to begin a cease-fire on Friday as a small first_step toward ending the 32-month civil_war , former President Jimmy_Carter announced Tuesday . The modest agreement -- one of many proposed cease-fires over the course of the war -- came_after an unscheduled second round of meetings between Carter and the Bosnian Serb leadership in nearby Pale . Carter called the extra session after conflicting claims about the results of their high-profile talks on Monday threatened to sink his entire peace mission . Carter announced Monday that Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had agreed to an immediate cease-fire , but Karadzic backed_away from the claim a_few hours later . The Bosnian government was so angered by the theatrics that President Alija Izetbegovic refused to meet with Carter when he returned to Sarajevo late Monday , choosing to make the former U.S. President wait until morning , sources said . &quot; We have had this character 2 1 / 2 years , and he lies every day , &quot; said Bosnian Vice_President Ejup Ganic , referring to Karadzic . &quot; Make_sure that you know with whom you deal. &quot; Carter , said to be alarmed and betrayed by Karadzic ' s antics on Monday , made Tuesday ' s cease-fire announcement in Pale standing shoulder to shoulder with him . After driving the mountainous road to Sarajevo , Carter repeated the announcement at the airport en route to Belgrade , where he plans to hold talks with Serbian leaders . &quot; There will be a complete cease-fire in all_of Bosnia-Herzegovina , including Bihac , to go_into effect at noon on Dec . 23 , &quot; Carter said . &quot; This cease-fire is to be completely monitored , without interference , by UNPROFOR ( U.N. Protection Force ) troops , interposing themselves between the opposing military_units wherever necessary. &quot; In The Hague on Tuesday , a two-day informal meeting of defense chiefs from 28 countries agreed on measures aimed at strengthening the U.N. force . At a news_conference after the meeting , Lt . Gen . H.G.B. van den Breemen , chief of the Dutch Defense Staff , declined to give details on the measures . It seemed clear the proposals carried at least the potential to make the U.N. force stronger and more effective , but they must still be studied by national governments and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and then approved by the United Nations , which so far has been extremely reluctant to employ force . Van den Breemen said the chiefs had discussed , and apparently recommended to their governments , the use of aircraft and more firepower to deliver humanitarian aid to civilians trapped by the war . &quot; We talked_about helicopters and armed escort helicopters , &quot; he said . Such escort aircraft would probably be provided by NATO countries . The tenor of Van den Breemen ' s remarks hinted strongly that the military chiefs recommended helicoptering supplies over roadblocks and permitting armed escort aircraft to attack anyone attempting to interfere . The Dutch general also said the agreed proposals would mean adding_to the U.N. force ' s troop strength . According to Carter ' s announcement , the cease-fire would last until Jan . 1 , during which time the warring sides would negotiate the details of a proposed four-month cessation of hostilities . If the two sides agree to that temporary peace , they will then turn their attention toward transforming the agreement into a permanent end of the war . &quot; We don ' t need more negotiations ; we need results , &quot; one unimpressed Western diplomat said . &quot; One has to be very doubtful this will go anyplace. &quot; The diplomat and others described the process set_up by Carter as fragile and ridden with potential pitfalls , especially since the former President failed to resolve what has been the most intractable obstacle to peace : the Bosnian Serb refusal to accept the Contact Group peace plan . &quot; In that key and critical area , I think they are still 180 degrees apart , &quot; a U.N. official said . &quot; The whole basis of negotiations is still in dispute. &quot; The Contact Group plan , drawn_up by the United States , Britain , France , Germany and Russia , calls_for dividing Bosnia about in half between the Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs . The Bosnian government and neighboring Serbia have agreed to the international plan , but the Bosnian Serbs , who would have to give_up one-third of the territory they now control , have repeatedly rejected it . The United States and other backers of the Contact Group plan have described it as a take-it-or-leave-it proposal that must be accepted by all sides before any of it can be revised or amended . The Bosnian Serbs have said they would consider the plan only if it could be renegotiated . Karadzic once again did not accept the plan Tuesday but insisted that it should serve as &quot; the basis of negotiation &quot; for peace . The Bosnian government maintained that the plan ' s acceptance was the &quot; starting point &quot; for negotiation . Unable to reach consensus , Carter included the language from both sides in a written summary of agreements reached during his two-day visit but said he could not &quot; detect any significant difference &quot; between them . &quot; That is a difference in semantics that I have not been able to overcome , &quot; he said , adding after reading a note passed to him by his wife , &quot; and I am obviously not taking sides as_to whose language is best. &quot; Carter ' s admission that he could not distinguish between the two positions sent chills through Bosnian government_offices here . Since Carter announced that he would visit their country , Bosnian officials have openly questioned whether his presence would be used by the Bosnian Serbs to undermine the Contact Group plan . A U.N. official said that even if Carter secures a cease-fire Friday , it will have come at a high price . &quot; We ' re going to wait for the next two days &quot; to see if there is a cease-fire , the official said . &quot; Maybe it holds_out a very slim chance of forward momentum , but it comes at the great cost of handing Karadzic a propaganda coup and muddying the international community ' s stance on Bosnia. &quot; A cease-fire could significantly benefit the people of the Muslim enclave of Bihac in northwest Bosnia , which came under heavy shelling again Tuesday . Unconfirmed reports said there were many casualties in the area , including a 10-year-old boy who was killed . But for a longer truce to take_hold , Carter ' s deal requires the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers between the two warring sides . U.N. officials said Tuesday that there are few available soldiers , and NATO military chiefs meeting in the_Netherlands did not seem inclined to send additional peacekeepers .
