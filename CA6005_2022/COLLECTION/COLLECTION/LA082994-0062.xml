   <HEADLINE> GROUP GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS ; JOBS : ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ASSN. ' S CLOUT GROWS AS REVITALIZATION PROGRAM MAKES_HEADWAY . COUNTY BACKS ITS CLEAN-AIR PLAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After years of working as an obscure organization known predominantly to business and industry , the Ventura County Economic Development Assn . is finding new clout in the community . During the booming economy of the 1980s , the association , made_up of ranchers and business_leaders , had no pressing issues on their agenda in the county . Now , during the lingering recession , the group has taken an increasingly active role in revitalizing the local economy -- a move that leaders hope will save jobs and bring new business to the county . Their role was evident last week when the association , working with a county-appointed panel and local pollution regulators , won the Board of Supervisors ' approval for a clean-air plan that would replace parts of a federal proposal considered too harsh on business . The spirit of cooperation that developed between the private sector and county regulators has laid the foundation for the association ' s ambitious goals for the coming year , said Carolyn Leavens , the group ' s newly elected president . Those goals include attracting firms to the county by creating a more business-friendly environment , streamlining county regulations to allow &quot; one-stop shopping &quot; for new and expanding businesses and developing an economic profile of the county to entice new companies that may consider relocating . The association will continue its work_on the air-quality plan as well as an educational_program to help teach high_school seniors who don ' t want to go_to college how to prepare_for the work_force . It will also take an active role in working for a regional airport and against military base closures . But the organization has one overriding goal , Leavens said . &quot; We ' ve got_to stop the job drain in Ventura County , &quot; said the president , whose family citrus-and-avocado business is one of the largest in the county . &quot; We ' ve got_to have regulators working with the private sector to give business a leg up . We ' re world marketers , and we have to be competitive. &quot; The county has lost 12 # 000 jobs in the past five years , and it faces the possibility of further losses if either of the U.S. Navy_bases at Point Mugu or Port Hueneme cuts_back or closes , association officials said . Robert Sears , a consultant for the Environmental Coalition and the Citizens to Preserve the Ojai , praised the group ' s efforts to protect the local economy , but he said the association ' s alternative clean-air proposal will not cut pollution enough to meet federal health standards . In fact , he said , it ' s questionable whether the U . S . Environmental Protection Agency ' s own plan is tough enough to meet those standards . By federal_court order , the EPA must have a plan to reduce pollution enough to meet the standards . &quot; The VCEDA alternative plan , which is less stringent than the EPA plan , will leave us even further from attainment ( of the standards ) , &quot; Sears said . &quot; The effect of the VCEDA plan has not been tested. &quot; Whatever final plan the EPA adopts in February , County Supervisor Maggie Kildee said , it must have input from all sectors of the community to succeed . That cooperation must continue in the future to keep the economy healthy , she said . &quot; It takes government working with business to make_sure that government is as receptive as we can be , &quot; Kildee said . &quot; With the economy turning_down , everyone has been focusing more on business. &quot; The group began as the county-funded Ventura County Chamber_of_Commerce in 1949 , said Nancy Williams , one of the association ' s two paid staff_members . Its name was changed to the Ventura County Economic Development Assn . in 1959 . Funding from the county continued until 1972 , when directors opted for more independence . The organization relies_on a cadre of about 200 volunteers , including its 30-member board of directors , to carry_out most of its projects . Membership dues , which range from $ 150 to $ 1 # 000 depending_on the size of the company , account_for most of the $ 200 # 000 annual budget . Two fund-raisers and an annual economic outlook conference make_up the difference most years . During the boom years in California and the county , the association ' s task was simple , said 18-year board_member Oras Racicot , regional affairs manager for Southern California Edison . &quot; For a long_time , the economy wasn ' t an issue here , &quot; he said . &quot; We would just go_along and get increases ( in funding ) every year . But when the economy went sour and we saw jobs leaving the community , things changed. &quot; Directors formed what they called the Red Team last spring to try to lure a new Mercedes-Benz plant . &quot; We went_in knowing the chances were remote , &quot; Racicot said , and the plan was unsuccessful . &quot; But it brought_together a nice coalition of people interested in the Ventura County economy. &quot; Then , last February , when the EPA released its proposed Federal Implementation Plan to clean_up the county ' s air , the association realized that it held tremendous implications for business , he said . The federal plan , developed under court_order , would force annual emissions reductions from industry . But some companies that already have cut_back on emissions as much as technology allows would be forced to cut_back production to meet those requirements , business representatives and regulators say . &quot; We were at the point where stationary sources of emissions couldn ' t be squeezed any more because we would lose productivity if the ( federal plan ) was imposed , &quot; he said . &quot; This really brought VCEDA together and gave us a focus , &quot; he said . Bill Mount , deputy director of the Air_Pollution Control District , has praised the association and the Council on Economic Vitality for their work to develop an alternative clean-air plan . &quot; It would have been devastating to industry , &quot; said Mount , whose staff provided technical assistance to the two groups in developing their plan . The association will continue to work with the air-pollution district to develop new regulations and will lobby the state to adopt a strict new smog-check program that would reduce emissions from motor_vehicles . The association also plans to lobby the state Legislature to enact a law that would charge motorists an annual fee based on how much they drive and how much their cars pollute . But association directors also see more issues on the horizon . Proposed county traffic fees to improve roads are an example of a new rule that could prove very unfavorable for business , said Richard Spencer , executive_vice_president of Martin V . Smith &amp; Associates and a new association board_member . &quot; The cities already have traffic mitigation fees in place , and these county fees will not replace those , &quot; he said . &quot; They will be stacked on top. &quot; He said the answer is to attract enough jobs to the county so that the fees aren ' t necessary . &quot; If we had enough businesses here producing things , and if there were enough taxes from people working flowing into county government as there used to be , we would not need traffic mitigation fees , &quot; he said . But until then , Kildee said , some fees are necessary . &quot; I don ' t think the Board of Supervisors will say : ' You don ' t like the fees , so you don ' t have to have them , ' &quot; she said . &quot; But I don ' t think the board will just say : ' that ' s tough , ' either . I think there will be a compromise so that everybody will get a little bit and nobody will be totally hurt. &quot; Leavens said the details have yet to be worked_out for how the new spirit of cooperation will translate into a friendlier environment . &quot; But , &quot; she said , &quot; it will have to be an alliance. &quot;</TEXT>
