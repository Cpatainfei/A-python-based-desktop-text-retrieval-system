   <HEADLINE> can ' t PHONE HOME ; DESERT FOLKS ENJOY NO LINK TO OUTSIDE -- BUT IT HAS ITS PERILS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One night last June , a rattlesnake sank its fangs into Debbie Robinson ' s hand while she was watering the lawn outside her desert home , about 25 miles northeast of Palmdale . As the deadly venom spread , the 43-year-old Robinson became dizzy and nauseated . * Because her husband was away , Robinson had no one to turn_to for help . In fact , she was as alone as almost anyone can be : Robinson lives in one of the few outposts in Los Angeles County that still does not have telephone_service . &quot; I had the shakes real bad , &quot; Robinson recalled . &quot; I knew that if I did nothing , I was going_to die . If I ' d had a phone , I could have dealt with it in a_few minutes. &quot; Robinson ' s life was saved because her husband pulled into the driveway just as she was going_into convulsions . He drove her to the nearest pay phone -- five miles away -- and summoned paramedics . A helicopter whisked her to a hospital in Lancaster for anti-venom treatments . Robinson , a bus_driver , is just fine now , and more committed than ever to a longstanding campaign to get phone_lines extended_to the unnamed , rural_area inhabited by about two_dozen families along and near_East Avenue O , the only paved road in the isolated neighborhood . But the efforts of residents -- living_in domiciles ranging from the Robinson ' s cozy , converted general_store to run-down mobile_homes -- have been thwarted for more_than 10 years by costly connection fees , bureaucratic bungling and squabbling among the neighbors themselves . At a time when people all_over the country are plugging their fax machines , modems and voice mail systems into the information superhighway , the Robinsons would settle for a simple dial tone . &quot; People say : ' Where could you possibly live where there ' s no phone ? ' &quot; said Debbie Robinson ' s husband , John , 44 , a construction worker . &quot; People just won ' t accept it. &quot; &quot; Everyone relates everyone to a phone_number , &quot; Debbie Robinson said . &quot; If you don ' t have a phone , you ' re not worth much. &quot; * John Crutsinger came here in 1943 , paying $ 30 an acre for a piece of the world that he thought would allow him to live a safe distance from urban life . He dug a well , built a house and moved from a neighborhood near Downtown Los Angeles . &quot; I wanted to get_away from all that I lived with down there , &quot; said Crutsinger , now 85 . Even the few neighbors he now has are too many . And the thought of Palmdale being only a short drive_away is no comfort . &quot; Pretty soon , they all moved here anyway , &quot; he said . John Miller , 65 , lives nearby with his wife , Cora , in a house that has three large boats in the yard . Miller , a former aerospace worker who moved to the area in 1985 , said a Palmdale man paid him to store the vessels , then abandoned the boats and moved to Florida . The Millers ' house is surrounded by a wall made of thousands of old automobile_tires . The wall is there to keep_out the sand and tumbleweeds , and to a certain extent , the outside world . &quot; Right now , what do you hear ? &quot; asks Miller standing in the yard . &quot; Just the wind blowing. &quot; About the only intruders are dune-buggy riders and motorcyclists who sometimes trespass onto the property . He keeps a handgun close by . &quot; We don ' t get trash ( collection ) , we don ' t get the telephones , we don ' t get cable TV , &quot; Miller said . &quot; We don ' t get a good response from the Sheriff ' s Department . You have to be self-sufficient out here. &quot; The Robinsons moved here a decade ago , assuming phone_service was available . &quot; When we looked_at the place , there was a phone_book on the floor , &quot; Debbie Robinson recalled . &quot; We never gave it a second thought. &quot; In reality , people in the area had to drive to the nearest town , Lake Los Angeles , and use pay phones beside the Saddleback Market or Burger Basket to make calls . When they asked the phone_company about establishing service to their home , the Robinsons were told it would cost them $ 13 # 000 upfront just to have the lines extended . They and other residents have considered cellular_phones , but they feel the fees are prohibitive . Duane Filer , supervisor of the California Public_Utilities Commission ' s consumer affairs branch , has heard complaints from other residents of remote areas who do not have telephone_service . But he dismisses arguments that telephone_companies should automatically provide these neighborhoods with service . &quot; They moved_out there , &quot; Filer said , &quot; so they ' re going to have to pay the expense to bring service there. &quot; Pacific Bell and GTE officials say the few unwired neighborhoods that exist in Los Angeles County are mainly in the sparsely populated far northern desert areas . If these residents ask_for service , the phone_companies will provide the first 750 to 1 # 000 feet of line for free . After that , they charge state-approved fees that add_up to thousands of dollars per mile . The utilities insist that they are only covering their labor and equipment costs . If they discounted these prices , they say , city and suburban customers would be subsidizing the cost of hooking_up more isolated households -- a practice the state Public_Utilities Commission frowns_upon . The 1990 census found that only 3.4 % of Los Angeles County ' s 3.2-million households had no phones . The study did not determine how many households were in areas where no telephone_service was available . * Even the most die-hard of isolationists along East Avenue O now consider a telephone a necessity of life . Relatives complain that they are too tough to contact . Employers must signal them via pagers or wait for them to call_in . Suspicious cashiers are loathe to accept a check from a customer who has no home phone_number . A much more urgent reason to have a telephone is for medical emergencies . John Miller has undergone two heart bypass operations , and his health remains fragile . He says he sometimes passes_out from overexertion while working in his yard . &quot; I ' d like to have a phone because I ' m getting_to the point where I ' m scared , &quot; he said . To reduce the cost , he said he once offered to install the roadside phone_lines himself , but the telephone_company refused to let him . An old-fashioned mobile phone_system gives him limited access to the outside world . It occupies a corner of his living room , where the walls are adorned with black velvet sword-and-sorcery paintings , an Elvis Presley clock and a framed Elvis Presley gold record . The gold record was a birthday_gift for his wife , an Elvis fan who commutes 25 miles to work as a Palmdale restaurant hostess . When she arrives or leaves work , she can signal her husband through his pager , which costs $ 19 a month . The Millers use their mobile phone , which is subject_to interference from other radio_sets , sparingly . Even so , their September bill was $ 102 , and previous ones have topped $ 200 . Up the road , Crutsinger said he did not miss having a telephone until 10 years ago when his wife suffered a stroke and he had to send a friend for help . When he later asked the telephone_company about getting hooked up , he said he was quoted a price of $ 22 # 000 . &quot; I couldn ' t afford that , &quot; Crutsinger said . More recently , he tried a cellular_phone for a month but found it far too expensive . &quot; The bill was $ 225 or something like that , &quot; he said . &quot; I found_out that every time you touch that thing , it costs you money . I turned it off. &quot; Crutsinger ' s wife , who never fully recovered from the stroke , is now in a nursing facility in the Las Vegas area near their daughter . Crutsinger said that without a telephone , he cannot often check on her medical status . After repeated inquiries , Pacific Bell offered in January to hook_up 18 households in this area if all_of the families signed_up for service -- and each kicked_in $ 965 upfront . Six months later , the plan was abandoned because only the Robinsons and five other families had paid . * Debbie Robinson pressed the phone_company to come_up with a less ambitious proposal . A revised plan was devised , but there was confusion about just what it offered . As the Robinsons understood the revised plan , they and three other families would each chip_in about $ 4 # 300 to get the lines extended_to their houses . But in a July 15 letter , Pacific Bell announced that with these four families paying the costs , telephone_service would be extended_to all 18 households . To those not_able to afford the hookup fees , this was a godsend . Dorothy Kubon , who lives_off a dirt road just west of Crutsinger ' s house , raises dachshunds and nurtures a rock and cactus garden . She relies_on a citizens band radio when she needs help . &quot; We ' re not out here because we ' re loaded , &quot; Kubon said . &quot; We ' re just average yokels. &quot; Another resident who would have gotten a free phone hookup was Humberto Moro , a sewing machine repairman who speaks limited English . His daughter , college_student Katia Moro , said phone_service would be a big help because family members now have to hurry to the pay phones when traffic accidents occur near the house . But the Robinsons and the other paying families were outraged that they were expected to subsidize the establishment of telephone_service , and they refused to pay . &quot; Have you ever wanted something really bad , and you could finally afford it -- but only if you bought one for everyone else on the block ? &quot; Debbie Robinson fumed . After inquiries by The Times , Pacific Bell said it had misunderstood the intentions of the paying families and that the July 15 letter was in error . The company sent a technician back to the desert to recalculate the cost of running lines only to the Robinsons and the other households willing to pay_for the installation . Their most recent proposal puts the total cost at $ 14 # 150 . So far , the only ones willing to pay a share of that are the Robinsons , the Millers and Crutsinger . That comes_to about $ 4 # 700 per household . It ' s a steep price for the Robinsons , but Debbie Robinson said she is determined to get the funds , even if they have to take_out a loan . &quot; One way or another , &quot; she said , &quot; I ' m going_to get a phone. &quot;</TEXT>
