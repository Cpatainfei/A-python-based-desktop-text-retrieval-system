   <HEADLINE> REMEMBERING D-DAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Your D-day special edition ( World Report , May 31 ) underscores the unlimited acts of courage and bravery demonstrated by American paratroopers , infantry , the Navy and so many other genuine heroes . I remember as a schoolboy on June 6 that we were directed to the assembly_hall where we joined in a prayer delivered by President Roosevelt over the radio for the safety of our troops . What remains most memorable about that day and during all_of World_War_II was the fact that it was the last time the people of the United States were totally unified in purpose . Everyone seemed to focus_on whatever had to be done to achieve victory . If even a small percentage of that spirit would be present today , there would be no problem facing us that could not be confronted and overcome . SID SKOLNIK West Hollywood Alexander Cockburn ( Column Left , June 3 ) , provides a necessary antidote to overwhelming D-day hype by correctly and courageously reminding us of the largely symbolic importance of Operation Overlord in the annals of military history . The Soviet_Union bore the brunt of fighting the Nazis in World_War_II . The commemorative spectacle in Normandy is made the more galling when one bears_in_mind U.S. sponsorship of Axis war_criminals during the Cold_War . D-day should be a time of remembrance for all who dedicated themselves to fighting fascism . STEVEN KROLAK Santa Barbara Your articles and the television coverage ( C-Span and other channels ) are wonderful in their thorough presentation of the events of that memorable day in June , 1944 . Hovering in the background in the channel we see the battleships ( the Arkansas ) and cruisers firing their mighty guns to &quot; soften up &quot; the beachhead . And approaching the beaches we witness the incredibly brave drivers of the LSTs ( landing ship tanks ) and LCIs ( landing_craft infantry ) . And the soldiers , heroic beyond measure . And yet , there are glaring omissions . Omissions of how the troops , their heavy_weapons , the tanks , trucks , and Jeeps , the gasoline for those vehicles , the ammunition , the medical supplies , the basic foods , etc. , got_to England and to France . Look further and notice the cargo_ships off-loading the troops into the LSTs and LCIs . These ships were manned by the &quot; unsung civilian heroes &quot; of the Merchant_Marine and the equally gallant members of the U.S. Navy Armed Guard . Today , the Jeremiah O ' Brien , the last of the Liberty_ships , sailing from San Francisco , has returned to the place where she received her baptism of fire . The O ' Brien made 11 crossings of the_English Channel during the weeks celebrated as the &quot; invasion of Normandy. &quot; The troop-carrying cargo_ship , the Susan B . Anthony , blew_up in the channel with the death of hundreds of GIs and merchant and Navy crewmen . The men who landed on the beaches of Normandy will never be forgotten . All we ask is that those brave men on the cargo_ships , who faced the submarines and enemy airplanes in all theaters of the war , not go unnoticed . We were in the North Atlantic , on the Murmansk run , in the Mediterranean at Anzio , in the Pacific at Guadalcanal , Leyte Gulf and Okinawa delivering the men and the necessities . We lost 10 # 000 men . THOM HENDRICKSON U.S. Navy Armed Guard , Veteran WWII Fullerton D-day , 1994 . World_War_II , &quot; the good war , &quot; has not been forgotten . No war is a good war . The loss of lives , the maiming of lives , the terrible destruction of property , the heartbreaks and tears hardly characterize any war as a good war . Retired Rear Adm . Gene La Rocque is quoted in Studs Terkel ' s World_War_II oral history book , &quot; The Good War , &quot; as saying : &quot; We have built_up in our body_politic a group of old_men who look_upon military_service as a noble adventure . It was a big excitement of their lives and they ' d like to see young people come_along and share that excitement . . . . We ' ve always gone somewhere else to fight our wars , so we ' ve not really learned about its horror . . . . We ' ve made war a religious act. &quot; Vietnam was the first televised war and through TV we saw some of the horrors . I salute D-day because I don ' t think World_War_II should ever be forgotten , but La Rocque ' s words burn deeply in my soul . SAMUEL M . ROSEN Newbury Park I recall my ' 60s generation confronting a police phalanx spread across the plazas of UCLA . Invigorated by yet another John Wooden championship , we gestured and flung trite phrases across the bucolic campus , bought with our parents ' taxes . If things got hot with approaching summer , we descended the cliffs of Palisades Park and sprawled for a tan on the beaches of Santa Monica . We now remember an earlier generation that struggled through the Depression to confront Nazi armies across the pastures of France . Invigorated by an ancient sense_of_duty , they flung themselves across bucolic Normandy . When things got hot , they sprawled for safety on the beaches of Omaha and ascended the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc . With head now bowed in respect and not disdain , I raise my naked hand no longer clenched and say , &quot; Right on . Thank you. &quot; ANDREW J . GUILFORD Newport Beach</TEXT>
