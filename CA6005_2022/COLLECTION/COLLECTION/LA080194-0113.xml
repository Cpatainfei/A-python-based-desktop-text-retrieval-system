   <HEADLINE> COMMITMENTS ; WITH A WINK AND A SMILE , FLIRTING ' S BACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eye contact . The quick quip . A double-entendre . A well-placed compliment . A funny retort . They ' re all part of flirting , which is making a comeback after a_couple_of bumpy decades , experts say . The ' 70s and ' 80s were a bad era for the art of flirting . Psychologists say that because social and sexual rules were looser , there was less of a need to meet others slowly and carefully . But now people are more interested in approaching relationships with caution , testing the waters before diving in . And flirting isn ' t just for those looking_for love . Marty Westerman , author of &quot; How to Flirt &quot; ( Price Stern Sloan , 1992 ) , says flirting reflects an openness and a playfulness that is commonly seen among children , spouses , seniors and strangers , as well as singles . &quot; Flirting is the art of being disarming , of being friendly , honest and open , &quot; Westerman says . &quot; Flirting is for everyone. &quot; Susan Odegaard Turner , 40 , a self-employed health_care consultant in Thousand Oaks , says she flirts all_the time . &quot; I start by making eye_contact ; I can usually tell by looking_at the other person if that elusive chemistry is there . Then I make a one-line comment , or answer a question with a double-edged meaning . If he is a flirt , he will respond in kind , &quot; she says . Turner , married with two children , sees her flirting as a harmless form of social banter . &quot; It ' s fun and it ' s safe ; you don ' t die of flirting . It ' s a game with the prize being the interaction itself , &quot; she says , adding that her husband doesn ' t mind . Jerald Jellison , professor of social_psychology at USC , sees flirting as an invitation to come closer . &quot; We spend a lot of our lives letting people know they can ' t approach us ; flirting serves as a signal , a request , &quot; he says . &quot; It becomes a playful activity , a way to have fun , give flattery , tease. &quot; What we call flirting may be a way of dealing with ambient sexual tension without taking it further . The ambiguity that is part of flirtation is part of what makes_it interesting , Jellison says . The suggestions are so subtle that they can be either ignored or enhanced , depending_on how things transpire . Some people flirt by paying a great_deal of attention to someone , showing intense concentration , offering slight smiles , and nodding their heads in_agreement , says Jellison , who admits to engaging in that form of flirting . &quot; It ' s a way of saying , ' I ' m interested in more , ' &quot; he says . Westerman says flirting is more common is societies with strict and clear social mores -- perhaps because the risk of having an overture taken too far is typically reduced . For some , flirting is not so_much about connecting with others as it is about building themselves up . Deborah Hendlin , a clinical_psychologist in private practice in Irvine , says many find flirting increases their sense of attractiveness and their ego strength . Some people , however , take flirting to an extreme , which can be a sign of deep-seated insecurity and a persistent need to affirm themselves or mask their sense of inadequacy , Hendlin says . Author Westerman claims such people are easy to spot : &quot; You know when someone ' s working too hard at it. &quot; For some , flirting is effortless and unconscious , but for others , it is an art they have to struggle to learn . One divorced man who is in therapy with Hendlin is easily discouraged about his attempts to connect with people . He reports regularly to Hendlin about how the flirtee he approached failed to respond with even a laugh or a smile . Flirting is not just for the young . Hendlin says seniors are usually very good at flirting , perhaps because they have attained a_level of comfort with themselves and some of the normal sexual protectiveness of youth is down . For some , the risks of flirting outweigh any potential pay-back . In an age in which sexual_harassment is increasingly an issue in the workplace , Westerman warns office flirts to limit themselves to people they know well and feel comfortable with . He also cautions them to stop making flirtatious comments if they are not reciprocated and to avoid touching others without their permission . Theresa Halzle , an Agoura-based free-lance photographer , says she considers herself chatty and outgoing , but says she is very careful not to flirt , especially in work situations . &quot; I think flirting has to do with sex , and I ' d rather be unencumbered , &quot; she says . &quot; I think_of flirting as high_school girls with their hair swinging , or going_up to a guy at a bar , and saying ' Hi , ' while arching your back ever so subtly . When others flirt_with me , I laugh -- without trying to make them feel embarrassed -- and always make_sure I insert a positive comment about my husband and children. &quot; Turner -- the frequent flirter -- has experienced the downside of over-flirting . At a party , she says , a concerned spouse joined the discussion and shot a_few pointed comments at Turner and took her husband quickly from the scene . She has also had to stop bantering to make the point that she was not interested in pursuing the relationship to a more intimate level . But more typically , Turner knows which people in her work and social circles are comfortable with flirting , and she sticks_to them , she says . And her husband &quot; flirts , too , but more subtly , &quot; Turner adds . Sometimes even with her . Hendlin says flirting doesn ' t have to stop when you ' re married . &quot; The looking , talking to them in a certain way , smiling , the banter and ' in ' jokes &quot; -- this is the kind of flirting that makes marriage more fun and exciting , she says . &quot; Flirting within a marriage can be a way of saying we have a secret relationship , &quot; Jellison says . &quot; In social settings , when ( you ) are separated from each other across a room , you can send a special smile that says , ' I can ' t wait until we ' re alone together.
