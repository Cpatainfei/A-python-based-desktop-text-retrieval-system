   <HEADLINE> ARAFAT MEETS HAMAS , FREES SOME MILITANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on Thursday eased his confrontation with the Gaza Strip ' s powerful Islamic movement , meeting the leaders of the largest group for the first time and releasing some of the 70 Muslim fundamentalists arrested in police sweeps earlier this week . In a visit to Gaza ' s Islamic University , Arafat told the leaders of Hamas that they and other fundamentalists are fully entitled to participate in Palestinian politics as long as they do not resort_to violence , but warned that the Palestinian police strike_hard at those who do use violence . He said the new Palestinian Authority will issue a license for a new Hamas newspaper , Al Watan ( the Nation ) , and he challenged Hamas , which claims the support of more_than half of Gaza ' s 850 # 000 people , to form a political_party and contest forthcoming elections . &quot; We in the Palestine Liberation Organization are not afraid of Hamas , and Hamas has no reason to fear us , &quot; Arafat said , according to a PLO account of the hourlong meeting . &quot; Palestine will be a democracy as long as we all play by the rules of democracy. &quot; Hamas , an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement , and a number of other fundamentalist and leftist Palestinian groups oppose the autonomy agreement reached a year ago between the PLO and Israel . They have made clear their determination to continue attacks upon Israeli forces and settlers . &quot; Arafat is caught between two sides -- between us and the Israelis , &quot; Dr. Mahmoud Zahhar , a Hamas leader , said in an interview before his meeting with Arafat . &quot; Hamas understands the game well . Israel will push Arafat harder and harder , and this will bring him into internal conflicts more and more . If he doesn ' t respond , well , Israel will finish him. &quot; Arafat , however , appears to be wooing Hamas , hoping to win local cooperation in Gaza while cracking_down on more extreme and peripheral groups , such_as Islamic Jihad . In his meeting at Islamic University , he stressed his desire for a dialogue with Hamas and praised it for its service to the community . Earlier this week , Arafat ordered the Palestinian police to round_up members of Islamic Jihad following its claim of responsibility for an ambush of an Israeli patrol guarding one of the Jewish settlements that remain in Gaza . One Israeli soldier was killed and two were wounded . Responding to angry Israeli demands for an immediate crackdown , Arafat told special internal security units to arrest as_many members of Islamic Jihad as they could find , according to Palestinian sources . He authorized further arrests of members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine after it announced its militia had carried_out a similar attack . * But the moves , a demonstration of Arafat ' s power and his willingness to use it , aroused considerable concern -- even within his own Cabinet . &quot; Mass arrests are political arrests , and they are against the law , &quot; Freih abu Medeen , the Palestinian justice minister , said . &quot; To make an arrest , you must have evidence and go_to a specific address and detain a specific person . You can ' t just sweep_through a mosque and pick_up those you find . . . . &quot; As justice minister , I must see that the president ( Arafat ) and the police observe the law . Bringing people in_for investigation is permitted , but I am telling the president that this is not the way. &quot; The families of many of those arrested protested outside the Gaza City prison Thursday , chanting slogans that accused Arafat of establishing a dictatorship and demanding the release of the detained men . About 20 of those arrested were later released , and Palestinian observers speculated that virtually all would be freed by early next week . &quot; The likelihood of our finding_out who carried_out the ambush against the Israeli patrol is very small with this kind of investigation , &quot; a Palestinian security official said . &quot; Islamic Jihad , or whoever carried_out the attack , wanted to demonstrate its power -- to fight the Israelis , to embarrass us , whatever . In response , we have to demonstrate our determination to defend the Palestinian Authority. &quot; Fathi Shkaki , the head of Islamic Jihad , called Arafat a &quot; criminal &quot; for ordering his supporters ' arrests . In a statement faxed from his headquarters in Damascus , the Syrian capital , Shkaki said Arafat &quot; would be deluding himself if he believed that Islamic Jihad will be silent about the arrest of its sons or any harm to them . The anger of the people and the vengeance of the holy strugglers will not wait long. &quot;</TEXT>
