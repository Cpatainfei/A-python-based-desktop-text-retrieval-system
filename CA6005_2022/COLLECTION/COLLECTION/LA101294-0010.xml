   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : GLENDALE ; ALEX THEATER TO SHOW ' GONE WITH THE WIND '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Though the Alex Theater ' s first year as a performing arts hub has been rocky , a group of local film enthusiasts is convinced the venue ' s future is anything but &quot; Gone With the Wind. &quot; In fact , members of the nonprofit Alex Film Society have slated a gala screening of the 4 1 / 2-hour 1939 MGM Civil War drama at 7 p.m. Nov . 17 as a kickoff for what they hope will be a revival of classic American films at the Alex . &quot; Seeing classic films in the Alex is like reliving them , &quot; said Brian Ellis , president of the film society and first assistant director of the NBC sitcom &quot; Frasier. &quot; &quot; Our events won ' t be panned , scanned , colorized or cut for time like on TV , and seeing films at the Alex is vastly superior to viewing the tiny theaters of multiplex cinemas , &quot; Ellis said . Organizers said the group plans to show popular musicals and dramas from the 1930s through the 1950s . Plans are in the works for possible screenings of restored prints of &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; and &quot; Doctor Zhivago. &quot; Located at 216 N . Brand Blvd. , the Alex ' s days as a movie_house were over by the time the Glendale Redevelopment Agency bought_it from Mann Theatres in 1991 for about $ 800 # 000 . After a $ 6.5-million restoration it was reopened as a venue for musical_theater and concerts in January . But Theater Corp . of America , the firm hired to book shows and run the operation , balked midway through the first year of a five-year contract and the city is suing the company and looking_for a new theater manager . The theater is being run_by the Alex Regional Theater Board , a nonprofit group . Jeanne Armstrong , Glendale ' s director of redevelopment , lauded the film society as a group of &quot; dedicated volunteers &quot; intent_on bringing movies back to the Alex . She said the Redevelopment Agency helped the group locate equipment that had been put_in storage after Mann Theaters closed the Alex , including a 35-millimeter film_projector and a sound_system . Armstrong said there had been little discussion of showing movies at the Alex because when the Redevelopment Agency purchased the theater from Mann , it agreed not to screen movies on a commercial basis . &quot; The agreement has a covenant stating that we cannot compete with the Mann Theaters ( in the Exchange , a nearby office and retail complex ) , &quot; Armstrong said . &quot; But onetime screenings to benefit a charity or nonprofit group are allowed. &quot; Three screenings of &quot; Gone_with the Wind &quot; are slated -- Nov . 17 and 18 at 7 p.m. and Nov . 20 at 1 p.m. For information , call ( 818 ) 243-2539 .</TEXT>
