   <TEXT> Nelson Mandela brought three centuries of bitter white rule to a dramatic close Monday , here in the colonial city where it all began , when he was unanimously elected South_Africa ' s first black president by its first all-race Parliament . &quot; Today we are entering a new era , &quot; he told a wildly cheering crowd outside City_Hall . He spoke from the same balcony where he addressed the world four years ago after his release from more_than a quarter of a century in prison . Moments later , Desmond Tutu , the Anglican archbishop and Nobel laureate , appeared beside him with a smile as dazzling as his bright magenta cassock . As always , Tutu was less restrained . &quot; We are free today ! &quot; he shouted gleefully , waving his arms to the tens of thousands who packed the Grand Parade . &quot; We are free today ! All of us , black_and_white together ! &quot; This historic day , which will be followed today by the formal inauguration in Pretoria , began with an emotional swearing-in ceremony for the 400 new legislators . They convened in what was once the inner sanctum of apartheid : the great_hall of Parliament , where a handful of whites enshrined racism and hatred into law . The opening prayer paraphrased another hero of black liberation , Abraham_Lincoln : &quot; For the first time in history , we have a government of the people , by the people and for the people. &quot; Outgoing President Frederik W . de Klerk , Africa ' s last white ruler , showed Mandela to De Klerk ' s old green leather seat in the government front bench . It was from there that De Klerk rose in February , 1990 , to repudiate apartheid and announce the reforms that freed Mandela and legalized his African National Congress and other black opposition groups . Mandela walked slowly down the benches , shaking hands and smiling . Then , in a show of reconciliation , he beamed broadly and crossed the floor to embrace his most bitter black rival , Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi . The room erupted in applause . Then came the oath of office . Mandela , his estranged wife , Winnie , his new deputy president , Thabo Mbeki , and seven other senior members of the ANC were in the first group called to raise their right_hands and swear allegiance to what long seemed an impossible dream : a democratic South_Africa . Next to sign the oath were De Klerk and nine of his National Party ministers and deputies . De Klerk , 58 , now becomes the second deputy president ; six of his followers have been named to the new coalition Cabinet . Then came the rest : former ANC guerrillas , political_prisoners and exiles , current political rivals and aspirants , as well as_many of the whites who once passed the legal rules of racial oppression -- and later renounced them . They changed the color and face of South_Africa ' s power elite in just over an hour . Albertina Sisulu , wife of 80-year-old Walter Sisulu , who first brought Mandela into the ANC and who suffered beside Mandela for most of his 27 years as a political_prisoner , next rose to offer Mandela ' s name in nomination . Cyril Ramaphosa , the ANC general secretary , offered the second . Up at the podium , Chief_Justice Michael Corbett paused in his black robes as the chamber grew silent . &quot; Only one candidate has been nominated , Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela , &quot; he intoned . Then he paused again . &quot; I hereby declare Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela duly elected president of the Republic_of_South_Africa on behalf . . . &quot; He was cut_off as every member_of_Parliament and hundreds of guests rose in a deafening roar of cheers and applause . &quot; On behalf of all_the members present , I congratulate you , sir , on being elected president of the Republic_of_South_Africa , &quot; Corbett finally finished . Mandela , 75 and silver-haired , looked dapper as he acknowledged the honor in a gray striped suit with a white carnation in the left lapel . Another honor came from a traditional bare-chested imbongi , or praise singer , from Mandela ' s Tembu tribe . Wearing animal_skins and waving a long whisk , he bellowed a chant that recalled Mandela ' s life : from herd boy to political_prisoner to the presidency . The story had special poignancy here , beside the Cape_of_Good_Hope , in the port where Dutch sailors founded the first white settlement in 1652 and began the European colonization of southern Africa . Most of the rest of Africa shed the yoke of white rule and colonialism , especially after World_War_II . But the Afrikaners here , as descendants of those early settlers are called , moved the other way . Starting in 1948 , with the election of the first National Party government , they systematically imposed Draconian laws to enshrine white_supremacy . They used the whites-only Parliament to ban interracial mixing in schools , hospitals , neighborhoods and marriage . They forced families apart , bulldozed black homes from white areas and forced millions at gunpoint to desolate , reservation-like homelands in a vain attempt to separate the races . And , in the end , they used a ruthless police-state apparatus to oppress tens of millions of people , strictly regulating their lives on the basis of the kinkiness of their hair , the width of their noses and the shade of their skin . Like the colonialists before them , the Afrikaners imprisoned their enemies on Robben Island , a notorious penal colony seven miles off Cape_Town in the shark-infested waters of Table Bay . Its hazy outline was visible Monday even as Mandela spoke at City_Hall , calling it &quot; a dungeon built to stifle the spirit of freedom. &quot; &quot; For three centuries , that island was seen as a place to which outcasts could be banished , &quot; Mandela said . &quot; The names of those who were incarcerated on Robben Island is a roll_call of resistance fighters and democrats. &quot; Ending that infamy and that struggle was what Monday was all about . &quot; Where apartheid was put_on the books , democracy will now replace it , &quot; Popo Molefe , the new ANC premier of Northwest province , said as he arrived_at the Parliament building . &quot; Today apartheid is really dead. &quot; Ramaphosa -- chief ANC negotiator during talks that led to the new constitution and election -- grinned as he mounted the steps . &quot; We were thinking_of storming it , &quot; he said . &quot; Now we can walk in gently. &quot; Winnie Mandela , who was neither named to the Cabinet nor invited to the official party after the formal inauguration , pushed past a crush of reporters without a word . Inside , Mandela neither exchanged a glance with nor spoke a word to her , even when she sat next to him for several minutes . The couple separated in 1992 after she was convicted of kidnaping and linked to an extramarital affair . Winnie Mandela nominated the sari-clad Frene Ginwala , a women ' s rights activist and head of the ANC research department , as Speaker of the Parliament . Ginwala , approved without debate , pledged to &quot; make_sure that every voice is able to make itself heard. &quot; Many legislators arrived with their spouses . Trevor Manuel , who will be in Mandela ' s Cabinet , brought his white-haired mother , Euphemia . &quot; This is the best Mother ' s Day present , &quot; she said . Joe Slovo , the Communist_Party chief who was considered public enemy No . 1 by the apartheid regime , showed_off his trademark red socks . &quot; From most-wanted to member_of_Parliament , &quot; he said , shaking his head in wonder . Moments later , two other living symbols of change walked up the cobblestone path . Tall and blond , Willem Verwoerd pointed to the legislative office_building named for his late grandfather , Hendrik F . Verwoerd , the Afrikaner prime_minister considered the architect of apartheid . &quot; I think this is one of the names that should be changed soonest , &quot; he said . His wife , Melanie , a new ANC member_of_Parliament , smiled . &quot; Even for whites , it ' s a day of liberation , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
