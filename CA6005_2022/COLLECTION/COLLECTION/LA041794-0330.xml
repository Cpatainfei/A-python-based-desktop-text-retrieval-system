   <HEADLINE> THE AMAZING STORY OF THE TONELLI FAMILY IN AMERICA ; ON THE ROAD IN SEARCH OF THE ITALIAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE , IN WHICH ONE MAN DISCOVERS IDENTITY , ETHNICITY , KINSHIP AND ALL THAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once upon a time , I had the luck to open a piece of junk mail that changed the world . Not your world , maybe , but mine , though even I didn ' t know it at the time . At the time , all I knew was that I was about to become a $ 27.95 sucker , thanks to an irredeemably cheesy appeal that began : Dear Friend , As you may already know , we have been doing some work relating to people who have the same last_name as you do . Finally , after months of work , my new book , &quot; The Amazing Story of the Tonellis in America , &quot; is ready for printing , and you are in it ! We have spent a great_deal of effort and thousands of dollars . . . and have located almost every Tonelli family in the United States . My new book features this valuable and extensive directory of Tonellis living_in America . . . . Due_to the uniqueness of the Tonelli name and the small Tonelli population in the U.S. , it is economically impossible to produce extra copies after our scheduled publishing date . This is the first edition of the book , and it is certain to be quite a rare and valuable acquisition . I believe this is the only book of its kind in the entire world , and you will want to have your own copy . . . . Would you fall_for that ? Look , I knew I was making an idiotic mail-order acquisition -- it was practically a Thighmaster . And when the burgundy leatherette-bound , gold-embossed volume arrived , it was bad , but no worse than I expected -- with a spurious Tonelli coat of arms ( crossed goats over a bed of linguini ) , some very generic advice on how to hang yourself from your family_tree and , the only part I cared about , the complete directory of Tonellis in America . Amazing . A Tonelli in Texas ! A Tonelli named Abner ! And , to my chagrin , only two Dr. Tonellis in the whole frigging country . It went_on and on that way , page after page -- roughly 350 Tonelli households in 22 states , a_thousand or so individuals , . 002 % of the American population , give or take . The book listed only names_and_addresses , but for some reason I was spellbound ; reading it had the same effect as staring at a map : uncompromisingly quotidian at first but capable of sucking you into a dream state . And , in fact , for months after , the giddy-dread sensation of reading the junk-mail book lurked in my thoughts , undigested , unabsorbed , floating to the fore at odd times . Once , while riding through New England , I flashed on the memory that a great many Tonellis were listed in Massachusetts . There in the front seat , intoxicated by velocity , a vagrant urge seized me : would n ' t it be something to get a car and , using the junk-mail book as my guide , drive_around the country to shake the hand of every Tonelli in America ? I saw myself steering confidently up_to the grassy borders of countless anonymous suburban tracts , leaving the engine on , hopping_out , ringing the bell and extending a paw of kinship past the half-opened storm door to the astonished resident . ( &quot; You ' re who ? Wait -- let me get the camcorder ! &quot; ) Then I ' d race back to my wheels and peel out_to my next visitation . Crazy ! The obvious impediments to such a spree -- -I hated driving , plus the trip would require a luxurious amount_of_time and money -- didn ' t occur to me because I knew I ' d never actually do_it . Until , of course , I did_it . &quot; C ' mon , I have to hug you if you ' re a Tonelli , &quot; says Denise , wife of Rick Tonelli , who ' s not home from his auto-repair shop yet . I have just made my way down a country lane near Lithonia , Ga. , and turned_in at a rustic-looking mailbox bearing my last_name . Funny to see it way_out here , within sight of Stone Mountain . Denise is effusive and bubbly , just the opposite of Rick , who comes_home and tells me , once we ' re settled in the living room , &quot; See , I ' m just the opposite of you . I ' ve never been interested in my family history. &quot; &quot; And I don ' t understand that , &quot; Denise says . &quot; I ' m a Heinz 57 -- Jewish-German is my strongest suit -- but if I was Italian , I would want to know so_much . Like his mother ' s father ; he came_over here and moved to Mississippi . To be a farmer ! Trying to speak English with an Italian-Southern accent . I mean ! &quot; Rick Tonelli ' s a friendly but taciturn guy , born in Connecticut . His father died at 46 , when Rick was 16 , which had been the last time Rick saw either Connecticut or any of his extended family there . But a_few years ago , Rick was approaching 46 as his son , Craig , was about to turn 16 . And Rick started to feel the similarities . So . . . . &quot; So we went_on a trip to Connecticut to see my father ' s brother , my uncle , &quot; Rick says . &quot; We call him Lolly , but his name ' s Alexander . Usually , we ' d go_to the beach for our vacation . But I really wanted to see my uncle . And it was our best vacation ever. &quot; &quot; We were worried that Craig might rather have gone_to the beach , &quot; Denise says . &quot; These were people Craig and I had never met . But I knew how much it meant to Rick , and I would have crawled on broken glass to make that trip. &quot; &quot; It seemed so funny , &quot; Rick says , &quot; Because we had never been around any Tonellis , and we pull_up to my uncle ' s house , and there are the cars , with plates that say ' TONEL-1 ' and ' TONEL-2. ' &quot; &quot; You have to understand , &quot; Denise says , &quot; on that trip we heard all these things that Rick never knew , and he sat there for two days and listened to his Uncle Lolly tell stories about the old days , and Rick laughed and cried at the same time. &quot; Rick squirms at the mention of crying . &quot; Yeah , &quot; he says offhandedly . &quot; It was a good trip. &quot; &quot; And we were in stitches for two days , &quot; Denise says . &quot; And I cried and Rick cried -- &quot; &quot; Yeah , &quot; he says , heading her off at the pass , &quot; this uncle of mine is so cool . Anyway , we drove to their town up there , got a motel_room , and then we called my uncle and said we were coming_by . And when he heard about the motel , he went crazy . ' Whaddya mean , you ' re in a motel , we have all this room. ' Now I hardly knew these people . But the second night , we stayed with them . We even slept_in their room. &quot; &quot; Oh , God , remember ? &quot; says Denise . &quot; The rosaries ? &quot; &quot; Yeah , I have a great family. &quot; &quot; You ' re lucky , &quot; Denise says . &quot; Yeah , I can ' t complain . And our son also loved it. &quot; &quot; Well , &quot; Denise says , &quot; he ' s very proud. &quot; Rick shrugs . &quot; He ' s more interested in family and that stuff than I am. &quot; &quot; He ' s proud , &quot; Denise says . &quot; Well , &quot; Rick allows , &quot; I am too. &quot; Craig comes_in from his job at a convenience_store . He ' s a gregarious kid of the New South , baseball_cap on backward , about to join the Air_Force . I ask , &quot; Do you come_across many Italian kids at school or anywhere ? &quot; He shakes his head . &quot; How about Brent ? &quot; Denise says . &quot; Yeah , &quot; says Craig , &quot; He is . He ' s my real good friend , too . But I just don ' t think_of him as being Italian . &quot; Then he grins and turns his cap around , and on the front it says &quot; Italy. &quot; I get_to the parking_lot ( Chip and Dale section , row 9 ) early and ride the monorail to the Magic Kingdom ' s gate , where Ed Tonelli , a Disney World janitor , and I have agreed to meet . But where is he ? Wait a second . There ' s a three-foot-tall employee in a jumpsuit walking my way . Please , let this be Ed . Imagine , a midget Tonelli . Nope , there he goes . I ' ve never been to Disney World . When I called from New York to ask Ed if he ' d show me around , he agreed in a second but had a request : &quot; Bring me some provolone , &quot; he said . &quot; I buy_it down here , and it tastes like plastic. &quot; So I ' m feeling like a latter-day immigrant , standing outside the gates to the Magic Kingdom with a chunk of stinking cheese in my bag . An hour later , I ' m still hanging , so I call Ed ' s apartment from a pay phone , and he answers . Could I really have failed to spot the only man in Disney World in a green &quot; M * A * S * H &quot; T-shirt and shades ? OK , so he ' s on his way back , but I ' m pissed , until I see this jolly little guy in oversized , impenetrable black goggles striding toward me . Gotta be Ed . I ' m happier already . &quot; My mother brought me down here to visit for the first time about nine years ago , &quot; he tells me . We ' re in a theme restaurant just inside the gate , having a big breakfast : &quot; Daisy Duck ' s eggs. &quot; &quot; We got_hold_of one of those cheap package deals . And when I got here , the magic hit me . I got impregnated by that pixie dust . I came_back to visit every year after that . Well , some years I missed , but then other years I came twice . I always knew this was my place_down here. &quot; Finally , at 37 , Ed made the big leap : He applied for a job at Disney World and got one . Back home_in Connecticut , he ' d roamed from security-guard job to dishwasher job to janitor job . &quot; I took sick days all_the time . I had the worst attendance record ever . And here , as of now , I ' ve got 19 months of perfect attendance . I ' ll never go_back to Bridgeport again , not for a funeral or a wedding , not even my own . It ' s part of my past. &quot; Now breakfast ' s out of the way , and he ' s ready to begin the grand_tour . We head first to Splash Mountain , which is dear to Ed ' s heart since part of his duties involve scrubbing the big plastic logs that carry customers down the mountain . ( He also cleans one men ' s bathroom , which he includes on my tour , and a ladies ' bathroom and a baby-changing room , which he does not. ) We wait in_line , then climb side_by_side into our bobbing log ; in the darkness of the mountain ' s innards , I hear Ed laughing_at every one of the robot animals ' jokes , even though he ' s heard them a_thousand times by now . Slowly , we ' re rising to the peak of the ride ' s big dramatic drop , but instead of gripping the rail with all his might -- like me -- Ed throws his arms up_in_the_air and braves the final , splashy 50-foot plunge no-hands . We travel through some kind of pirate thing , then zoom over to Epcot , and all I remember there is a ride through the history of the world as narrated by Walter Cronkite and a walk through a series of pavilions devoted to foreign countries . &quot; Here , let ' s go this way , &quot; Ed says , stepping from Norway into Mexico . &quot; I want to take you through Italy. &quot; In a Georgian-looking building , something called &quot; The American Adventure &quot; is about to begin . A crew of collegiate weenies dressed in colonial and antebellum costumes starts to croon : &quot; This is my country , land of my birth . . . . &quot; &quot; Hey , Ed , &quot; I suggest after about 12 seconds , &quot; why don ' t we skip this and go somewhere we can talk ? &quot; &quot; No , we have to stay for this , &quot; he says urgently . &quot; This is really beneficial . I know you think it ' s a drag . But since we ' re cutting it short &quot; -- I ' d already told him , three hours tops for the whole tour -- &quot; I don ' t want you to miss the best parts. &quot; The show isn ' t as bad as I expected . It ' s a lot worse . It ' s hard to understand the point of making robot actors so lifelike that they ' re almost human when it ' s so cheap and easy to use humans in the first place . I ' m squirming through a half-hour of the Ben Franklin robot and the Mark Twain robot tossing prefab homespun one-liners back and forth ; if I hear the words &quot; freedom &quot; and &quot; liberty &quot; once more I might strangle poor Ed , I think . In the darkness , as the final crescendo of platitude-swapping cranks to life , I scribble in my notebook , &quot; This is f - - - ing inane ! &quot; I ' m carving in the exclamation_point when Ed turns_to me and says , &quot; Doesn ' t that make you proud to be an American ? &quot; I ' m so torn -- between thinking that Ed ' s gone a little goofy on Disney World and thinking that his quest to find a hometown he can love makes him the wisest_man I know -- that all I can do is nod . Before I went_on the road , I sent a four-page questionnaire to every Tonelli household in the mail-order book and then some , 450 in all . &quot; As you ' ll see , &quot; I wrote in the cover letter , &quot; I ' m asking the questions you ' d expect -- about how you live , your jobs , your eating and social habits , and how much ( if at all ) you feel your Italian background in your daily life. &quot; I got_back more_than 200 questionnaires , hired professionals to crunch the numbers , and here are some highlights : Only a little more_than half ( 53.3 % ) of the Tonelli Nation is of full Italian ancestry . As it turns_out , I could use lots of my interviews as research for a book about German Americans . Of respondents under 30 years of_age , almost three-quarters have only one Italian parent . Most responding Tonellis ( 52.3 % ) are the grandchildren of immigrants . And most Tonelli ancestors came from north-central Italy , above Rome . Most ( 57.4 % ) did not marry someone of Italian ancestry . Of course , since many of them are not of full Italian ancestry themselves , their choice of mate doesn ' t even represent intermarriage . Sociologists say that endogamy -- marriage to someone of_your_own group -- is the most important indicator of strong ethnic identity . Forty percent of Tonellis speak a_few words of Italian , 24.1 % speak none at all and 16.6 % speak it fluently . Most ( 72.9 % ) thought &quot; The Godfather &quot; was the best of the Godfather movies ; 8.5 % voted for &quot; II &quot; and only 2.5 % went_for &quot; III. &quot; ( Scary to note that 2.5 % of Tonellis are insane. ) When Tonellis serve tomato_sauce , 67.3 % make_it themselves , 27.6 % open a jar , and 4.5 % do both . About 80 % of Northeasterners make_it themselves , compared with 42.1 % of Westerners . And 75.5 % of Tonellis of Italian-only ancestry go homemade , compared with 58.1 % of those of mixed ancestry . Because I don ' t really trust myself around numbers , I commissioned Dr. Richard D . Alba , a professor of sociology at the State University of New York , Albany , and a respected authority on ethnicity , to analyze the Tonelli Nation census . In the &quot; near future , &quot; he wrote , the fourth generation will begin to define the majority of Tonellis in America , &quot; an important transition , because the fourth generation has little or no contact with the immigrants and thus is missing a set of experiences that can help to sustain a strong ethnic identity. &quot; Even now , according to Dr. Alba , &quot; the ethnic dynamics visible in the demographic data for the Tonellis lend themselves to a ' soft ' form of ethnicity . . . . Signs of ethnicity tend to be muted and to be kinds that , like food , can be appreciated by , or at least do not give offense to , those who do not share one ' s background. &quot; In other words , we Tonellis have never been less Italian than we are right now , and we ' ll never be even this Italian ever again . The &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them &quot; mentality goes , but with it goes the idea that anything more meaningful than macaroni holds us together . And that ' s true not just for Tonellis but for all Italian Americans , and I ' m sure for every_other kind of hyphenated American , too . You ' re going to miss us Tonellis when we ' re gone . You ' re going to wish you had been nicer to us when you had the chance . I ' m in a living room in Escondido , just outside San Diego , listening to a burly , thick-fingered exterminator play a delicate , lyrical , sentimental melody on his piano . He composed it , and his wife and I applaud when he finishes . Then Beatrice and Mike Tonelli and I sit at the kitchen_table . BEATRICE : I came_out here from the_Bronx on vacation when I was 18 , with my mom . We took the train from New York , came_to San Diego and stayed_at Mike ' s parents ' house -- my aunt and uncle ' s . And Mike and I met and fell_in_love , and I went_back home and told my father I was moving to California , and we got_married . Married for 18 years . ME : Was anybody upset about it ? BEATRICE : Oh , we had a lot of . . . your parents more_than mine . MIKE : My dad , he was all against it . My parents didn ' t want us in their house at all . ME : How exactly did_it happen ? MIKE : When they came_out to visit , my dad told me to show my cousin around town . So I did . And we fell_in_love . ME : But didn ' t it occur to you that there would be trouble ? MIKE : Sure it did . BEATRICE : Yeah , it did , but it didn ' t stop us . ME : How did your father find_out ? MIKE : He caught me writing her a letter . He grabbed it and read it , and , oh boy , was he mad . Sheee . Plus , she started crying at the train when they left , so my dad and mother and her mother kinda went , &quot; Well , what ' s goin ' on here ? &quot; My dad told me , &quot; You can ' t marry your sister . &quot; I said , &quot; She ' s not my sister , &quot; but he said , &quot; She might as well be , she ' s my brother ' s daughter. &quot; Then my dad said , &quot; Oh , she ' s not gonna come_back and marry you anyway . You have nothing to offer. &quot; And I was so tired_of hearing that from him -- &quot; She ' s got a good education and good job out there , she ' s not coming &quot; -- so I said , &quot; What do you mean , Dad ? What about this ? ( Re-enacting the nonverbal part of their exchange , Mike looks down at his lap , so I do , too , and then we ' re both staring at his crotch , which is pumping up and down on the chair. ) Oooh , he almost sent me flying . &quot; You talkin ' about my brother ' s daughter ? ! &quot; I said , &quot; Yeah , I got plenty to offer , Dad. &quot; He was really pissed . ME : How did you break the news ? BEATRICE : On the train home , I told my mother that we had fallen_in_love and I wanted to come_back to California . ME : Was she mad ? BEATRICE : I ' ll tell you , my mom was upset when I was going_out with this Puerto Rican guy . She grabbed a kitchen knife and told him , &quot; Your name is_on this . If I see you with my daughter again , this is going right through you. &quot; So she wasn ' t that radical about Mike . MIKE : She said she would n ' t have married me if the priest back there hadn ' t OK ' d it . BEATRICE : Well , I had to be married in church . MIKE : But I didn ' t think the priest would OK it . BEATRICE : Fooled you , ha-ha . MIKE : And a year later , my father said it was the best thing that ever happened to me . And at the time they had told me they ' d rather see me marry a black_person . Mike and Bea saw a geneticist before they married , and he gave them the OK to have kids . They have two daughters , Ginette , who ' s 16 , and Sabrina , 12 . As I ' m packing to go , Mike says , &quot; Yeah , Italian is the only nationality there is . And if there were more of us , this would be a better country . I only wish I was pure Italian . My mother ' s German . I don ' t even tell people I ' m half German. &quot; Then , as I ' m walking_out the door , Beatrice says , &quot; Oh wait -- did I tell you both my dad ' s parents were Tonellis ? &quot; &quot; Mine too ! &quot; says Mike . The woman at the Frontier Airlines office in Fairbanks , Alaska , suggests I get_to the airport an hour early , even though the departure area is an office the size of a restroom and the plane is parked right outside the door . They just want you to get_in a full hour of dread before you take_off . A minute before we board , a Pizza Hut guy rushes into the office . &quot; Hey , you barely made_it , &quot; says a man who takes delivery of one large pizza . I assume he ' s going_to eat it on the flight , but instead he belts it into the seat next to his . I knew Allakaket was out there , but until I witnessed how you get a pizza delivered , I had no idea . I hate these little airplanes . I hate any plane where you can sit in the tail and still read the dials on the dashboard . As soon as we ' re high , I open my eyes and see black land , white snow , frozen lakes and rivers , and miles of jagged mountaintops -- no roads , no buildings , nothing human . After 15 minutes , we run_out of land , too , and the rest of the hour it ' s solid white outside . We start our descent , and I can ' t see anything down there . We hit the ground , and I still can ' t see anything . Wait -- there ' s a barn . A few log_cabins almost totally buried in snow . Some people on snowmobiles . &quot; Who are you waiting for ? &quot; an Indian woman asks me . &quot; Stanford Tonelli , &quot; I say . &quot; Stan ' s out running his dogs . I ' m Annie . Come_with me. &quot; At this point I would normally think to ask , &quot; Annie who ? &quot; but instead I grab my bags , climb behind her on the snowmobile saddle , and off we zoom over a path of solid , bumpy snow that winds past the scattering of log_cabins that makes_up the village of Allakaket , population about 200 Athabascan Indians . I ' d have a_million impressions to report now were it not that all my concentration is in my knees and ankles , which are squeezing dents into the snowmobile , trying to keep me from bouncing off into the void . A few months back , Stan had been the first Tonelli to call_in response to the questionnaire . He had some weird news to report : &quot; I ' m not really a Tonelli . I don ' t know if my father was Mexican or Italian or whatever , but he fought in the South Pacific during World_War_II and got malaria . Now , this is more or less how I understand the story from my second_cousin . Anyway , he almost died from the malaria , except an Italian corpsman named Tonelli saved his life . And my father was so grateful he changed his name to Tonelli . I don ' t know if it ' s true , but that ' s what they tell me. &quot; Stanford said he was born in Northern California in 1957 , and his dad took_off when Stan was small , leaving Stan ' s mother to raise their three sons alone . I asked how he ended_up in Alaska , and he said , &quot; I had trouble dealing with people . No . I didn ' t have trouble . I just don ' t like people . I like peace and quiet. &quot; Despite the shadowy circumstances by which he acquired the Tonelli name , he welcomes my visit . My corner of Stan and Annie ' s one-room cabin is homey and A-OK , near the wood stove , with a curtain around the bed , a reading_lamp and several small toys ( the bed belongs_to 8-year-old Justin ) . The whole cabin is maybe 20 by 20 and also holds Stan and Annie ' s big bed , a sofa , a kitchen_table , some chairs , cabinets , the stove , two TVs , a Nintendo and VCR , and a deep_freeze . Once I ' m settled in , Annie and I go outside to wait for Stan . On their little piece of Alaska , there ' s an outhouse , a shed and an oil drum , around which , half buried by snow , I can make_out a_few disconnected animal heads , forelegs and tails , and some scraps of gray fur -- spare_parts . Improbably , there ' s also a street light . Suddenly the profound Alaska silence is broken by weird noises , something between barking and screaming bloody murder . I look down the path , away from the village , and see these dogs , smaller and scrappier than I pictured , dragging a sleigh through the snow , and standing heroically at the helm is Stanford : Tonelli of the North . Stan and I say our hellos and how-was-the-trips and all that . He ' s a lean , quiet , good-looking guy , mid-30s . He asks if I saw any caribou herds as I flew in , and I say no , but the truth is that it never occurred to me to look . After Justin comes_home and we polish_off a meatloaf , Stan ' s friend and neighbor Philip drops_by , and we men crack a half-gallon of Canadian Mist . The whole idea of my being here amuses Philip , I can tell . When the subject turns_to New York , he asks , &quot; Hey , Bill , tell me -- did you ever sit in on a Mafia meeting ? &quot; Justin wants to go_to the high_school basketball_game tonight , so the three of us pile on Stan ' s snowmobile and we ' re off . Stan deposits us at the gym , and Justin immediately disappears with his school buddies , leaving me alone on the bleachers , the object , I suddenly realize , of sizable curiosity . One little kid , maybe 4 years old , stops_dead in her tracks , astonished , when she sees me , then she cracks_up laughing . Another one races by , touches my hand and keeps running . It ' s like I ' m suddenly on the wrong end of a National Geographic TV special . The basketball_game ends , and Justin and I go outside to wait for Stan . The darkness deepens ; my thoughts , naturally , run to calamity : What if Stan forgot us ? In my mind , it ' s &quot; McCabe and Mrs . Miller &quot; time ; one false step , and you ' re permafrost . So I pull Justin out of his group of buddies and tell him we ' re going to a house maybe 50 yards away to call Stanford at_home . Like any kid , he ' s willing to go_along obediently with whatever foolishness an adult suggests . We walk maybe 20 steps into the night when I look down at him , and it hits me like an electric_shock : I grabbed the wrong kid . Well , look , I ' ve known him for all_of three hours at this point . Plus he ' s bundled_up in a hat that covers half his face . Plus , to my eyes these Athabascans look more alike that not . I see it all_in a flash : Millions of miles from home and reliable legal counsel , in the middle of the most alien environment I ' ve ever known , I have just kidnaped a small boy . OK , as it turns_out I did not grab the wrong kid . We make_it to a telephone , call Stan , and he comes_to fetch us straightaway . As we pull_up to the cabin , I notice that the street_lamp is broken . &quot; Hey , Stan , &quot; I say , &quot; your light ' s out. &quot; &quot; I know , &quot; he says nonchalantly as he dismounts . &quot; I shot it. &quot; What next ? When I settle_down to sleep , from outside the curtain around my bed Stan says , &quot; Uh , Bill , if you hear any noise during the night and it ' s a bear , the gun ' s over here. &quot; Got it , Stan . If I hear a bear , I ' ll shoot myself . The next day , Stan remembers he has something he wanted to show me . His mother recently sent him photocopies of long , handwritten letters from a woman in San Diego , the histories of three Mexican-American sisters born between 1878 and 1900 . One of them , Adelaide Rodriguez , took as her third husband a man named Arthur R . Ybarra . Their son Jerome was Stan ' s father . In the course of the letters , without explanation , Jerome ' s last_name changes from Ybarra to Tonelli . It ' s a weird document , but it ' s all Stan has to explain who his mysterious father was , who Stan himself might be . I think that the main reason Stan invited me up here was that he thought I might have some clues to share . But I don ' t , except for a_few pages I tore out of the San Diego phone_book , the pages that list column after column of Ybarras . So I hand them over . A little later , we decide to ride up_to Graveyard Lake , to see about getting some ducks or maybe a moose . As we walk past his dogs , Stan points to one and says , &quot; I ' m gonna have to kill him. &quot; &quot; Gee , how come ? &quot; I ask . &quot; He isn ' t working hard enough pulling the sled . He isn ' t giving 100 % . He ' s not worth the food I ' m feeding him. &quot; &quot; Why doesn ' t he work harder ? &quot; I ask . &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; Stan replies . &quot; Bloodlines. &quot; On the corridor wall of my cheap Des Moines motel there ' s a faded &quot; Lounge &quot; sign pointing down a shadowy flight of stairs . At the bottom of the steps , I find a door , and behind it there ' s a room with a jukebox and two pool_tables ; it ' s like somebody turned his grandparents ' basement into a cocktail_lounge . There ' s a gorgeous , sassy Ethiopian bartender , obviously on very familiar terms with her cast of regulars : Gary , the 50-ish wise_guy ; Chester , the mild and laconic , prematurely bald guy ; Donna , the spry , silver-haired grandmother in peppy sportswear . I ' m the silent , unknown presence at the end of the bar until two more women come_in , and one of them , feeling frisky , puts some Patsy Cline on the box and asks me to dance . &quot; Sure , &quot; I say , and before long somebody asks why I ' m in town , and I tell the truth . It strikes everybody funny for about a minute . Then a noisy group enters , including a woman named Janet whom everyone seems to know . Chester leans over from the next stool and tells me , &quot; that ' s Janet Tonelli. &quot; My dance partner extends an invitation to see Mt . Rushmore . &quot; You should go , &quot; Chester says . &quot; You can see George Tonelli. &quot; Now somebody is at the jukebox , and &quot; All Shook Up &quot; comes_on . &quot; Elvis Tonelli , &quot; Chester announces . It ' s still dark when I leave Des Moines for Anamosa , Iowa , where Bob Tonelli pays the price for his crime . I have already met Bob ' s half-sister Carmella , in a federal prison_camp in Texas ( cocaine ) ; his cousin Mike , who also did time at Anamosa ( armed robbery ) , and another cousin , Albert , Mike ' s brother , who went_to prison for willful injury . When I introduced myself to Bob ' s elderly father , Charlie , I told him I was going_to see his son in prison . &quot; Yeah , get him out of there , &quot; the old_man told me . &quot; He ' s a good boy. &quot; To get_to the narrow , airless conference_room where Bob will tell his tale , I pass_through two grim sets of barred thresholds . &quot; As I remember it , it happened at approximately 11:15 , 11:30 at night , &quot; Bob begins . &quot; I laid him down on the floor to change his diaper , and I went_into the other room to get the diaper and baby wipes . &quot; When I came_back , he had pooped on the floor , so I cleaned him up and cleaned the poop . Then I tossed him onto the -- the papers say I hurled him , that was his mother ' s mother ' s word . I would n ' t so_much say that I hurled him , but I tossed him on the couch . By no means did I mean for this to happen . I can ' t really tell you how much force was involved , but he hit an ashtray . He hit his head on an ashtray . Then he got_up , and he walked_around the room once , and then he fell_down and went_into convulsions . &quot; And I called 911 . Then I called his mother , who was my girlfriend at the time . And I tried to get him to breathe . He was breathing , but he was breathing hard , and he , uh . . . . I was trying to give him CPR . His mother got there , and she called the ambulance . She had to look_up the number in the phone_book . &quot; And then , the ambulance got there and took him to the hospital . She called me from the hospital and said , ' Did he hit his head ? ' And I said , ' Yeah. ' Then she said , ' Well , he ' s in a coma. ' He went_on for a day and half . She called and said , ' He moves , he opens his eyes when I call his name. ' &quot; But then the day after that , the sheriff showed_up at my house , and he said the baby had just died . &quot; If I could change things , I ' d rather I was dead than that little child . I wake_up at night . . . sweating . . . . I guess you ' d have to go_through it yourself . But it ' s bad thoughts , bad dreams . Bad dreams . Oh . . . I don ' t know . . . . &quot; Silence . Since I first learned of Bob , I ' d been looking_forward , in a blackish way , to meeting the most notorious Tonelli in the world . Now here I am , having just encouraged a soft-voiced , visibly shaken 22-year-old to describe the bleakest moment any living being can imagine . I feel sick , and we still have a_few minutes left . I ask , &quot; What would you be doing if none of this had happened ? &quot; &quot; I ' d probably be in my own apartment , &quot; he says , &quot; close enough to my dad ' s house so I could go_over there to visit him. &quot; Heading east from Anamosa , only one thing occurs to me : Tough times make tight families . Do I or do I not pay a visit to Alexander Tonelli in Connecticut ? On the one hand , by now I ' ve had enough Tonellis . I want it to be over . On the other hand , Alexander is the uncle to whom Rick Tonelli of Lithonia , Ga. , paid that emotionally charged visit a_few years back . I pull_off the highway and call , and he ' s home and sounding hesitant . But if I hurry . . . . I zoom over and into the driveway , which is just as Rick described it , two cars sticking_out of the garage , &quot; TONEL-1 &quot; and &quot; TONEL-2. &quot; &quot; Yeah , Rick called me on the phone and said they were going_to take a trip , and I said , ' Well , come_on up , ' &quot; Alexander , Uncle Lolly , says . He ' s 78 , a retired gun-stock maker , sitting in his dining_room . &quot; And he was tickled pink when he got here . I hadn ' t talked to him or seen him for 30 years , since his father died . In fact , he had to say his name twice on the phone ; it caught me off-balance . I wasn ' t expecting him . And then he came_over , and we reminisced , and he met all my kids and their families -- I ' ve got seven grandchildren -- and he met so many people in such a little bit of time . We took him to see the house where he used to live . He was only about 6 years old when they moved . His father , my brother , moved away right after our mother died . He said , ' Well , I don ' t have anybody here . . . . ' &quot; I ask him , &quot; What do you think the trip meant to Rick ? &quot; &quot; that ' s a good question . But there really isn ' t much I can tell you , &quot; he says with a shrug . &quot; It was a pretty short stay. &quot; Anyway , that ' s how it went_for two solid months on_the_road with the Tonelli Nation . I know it was just a trip in a car , meeting ordinary people , but it feels_like a miracle happened to me . I met more Tonellis than I ever thought I ' d meet , in more places than I ever thought I ' d see . To be honest , all that traveling unhinged me , like an out-of-body experience , but I learned a lot , too . OK , let ' s get_it over with . Here ' s what I learned : * There really are Tonellis all_over America . Which , granted , I already had cause to believe , but now I know . * They really were happy to see me . I know , partly because it ' s flattering to be the object of someone ' s curiosity for any reason . But my visits touched something genuine in these people , I could tell , some desire to connect with history or blood or experience . Their imaginations , like mine , were stirred by the vast mystery that there could be so many of us , in so many different forms . * But they really don ' t think much about their ancestry . The tie has been severed ; no aspect of their lives speaks_to their sense of themselves as creatures of history . They ( or somebody before them ) made a crucial transfer . They stepped_out of the story of their blood and into that of their country . They ' re Americans , and that ' s why their ancestors came here in the first place , I guess . Those brave old greaseballs in the great beyond should be happy ; they would n ' t be able to recognize or even speak_to their own flesh and blood . The thought that comes_to_mind is that histories end in America -- that for America to succeed , ethnic identity has to go_out the window . This country isn ' t dedicated to blood or even to shared memories , it ' s dedicated to a proposition . The bonds of family and kinship , which have proved their savage power since before history started , have to be dissolved for this country to succeed . So , do you see how America happened ? It ' s like algebra : Ethnicity equals history History equals memory . America equals amnesia . And that ' s what ' s amazing about the story of the Tonelli family in America : For the good of mankind , we had to try to obliterate centuries ' worth of memory in just two or three generations . And we did_it . We forgot so well , we don ' t even remember forgetting . Now we ' re fit to live nowhere but here . that ' s probably what ' s amazing about your family , too . ( Go_ahead , say it -- Ich bin ein Tonelli ! ) So , that ' s all_of it , my only true story . I drove 12 # 000 miles in two months without killing anybody ! As I met Tonellis , I felt as though I could claim them , and as I claimed Tonellis , I claimed America , too . Everything finally all came_together . It really was a hell of a trip .</TEXT>
