   <HEADLINE> A BURGEONING PARTNERSHIP ; RUSSIA ' S ENROLLING IN NEW GROUP COULD OPEN_DOOR TO GAINS IN INTERNATIONAL SECURITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia has told NATO that it ' s now ready to join the 18 other countries , including former republics of the Soviet_Union , that have accepted the West ' s invitation to enroll in a new Partnership for Peace . Moreover , Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told his counterparts from 16 NATO nations the other day , Russia is ready to sign_on -- maybe as early as next month -- without the conditions it earlier indicated it would demand . NATO has politely welcomed Moscow ' s decision . Better , after all , to be_on a friendly consultative footing with the country whose territorial expansionism NATO was originally formed to resist than to continue treating that country like a mistrusted outsider . It ' s clear nonetheless that within NATO strong doubts about Russia ' s aims remain , and that a healthy caution is likely to guide the West ' s approach to developing closer military ties with Moscow . The Partnership for Peace ( PfP ) is an idea hastily thrown_together in Washington earlier this year to fend_off those former members of the Warsaw Pact -- Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , most prominently -- that were rapping on NATO ' s door in quest of membership . Their reason was the honorable one of self-preservation . All had sound historical reasons to fear Russia and , if less so now , Germany , and membership in NATO would provide a larger measure of collective_security than any had ever known . However , at a time when ultranationalists had just scored big in Russia ' s parliamentary elections , the consensus in Western capitals was that this wasn ' t the most opportune time to begin extending NATO ' s flank eastward , to the very borders of the former Soviet_Union . Instead there would be the PfP , which would forge military links between old antagonists by means of joint military exercises , defense planning and maybe peacekeeping missions . Russia ' s readiness to join the PfP unconditionally does , however , carry an asterisk . Grachev made clear that Russia remains the superpower in Europe and expects to be treated with the respect that status implies , and not simply as just one state among many . He also made clear that Russia regards the PfP as only a way station to a new &quot; collective_security system in Europe &quot; in which NATO would play a subordinate role . Most NATO countries are in any case plainly unenthusiastic about admitting to NATO membership a Russia whose long-term interests -- focused_on the former states of the Soviet_Union -- don ' t coincide with that organization ' s . But in joining up with the PfP , Russia at least will open the way to greater consultation and cooperation in the security field than has so far been possible . A small step_forward , perhaps , but not an insignificant one .</TEXT>
