   <HEADLINE> FAITH , HOPE , CHASTITY ; THOUSANDS OF TEEN-AGERS ARE EMBRACING A NEW CHRISTIAN ABSTINENCE PROGRAM . WHY ? MANY LONG FOR MORAL CERTAINTIES . ALSO , &quot; SEX IS NOW A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. &quot;</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a recent Sunday , 39 teen-agers promised to remain virgins . Relatives with video cameras edged_in for close-ups of the girls in white dresses and boys in shirts and ties as they recited their vows . Younger brothers and sisters balanced on tiptoes to get a better view . And after the ceremony , the whole congregation of St . Stephen ' s Baptist_Church in La Puente gave a blast of applause . In the name of their Christian faith , a small but growing number of teen-agers are pledging to save sex for their spouses . The vow seals their membership in True Love Waits , an abstinence program introduced last year by Baptist minister Richard Ross of Nashville , Tenn . His is not the first campaign of its kind , but it certainly is the most visible . With rallies , ceremonies , T-shirts and wallet-size pledge cards , True Love Waits has ignited the zeal of teen-agers across the country . &quot; I heard about it in Sunday_school and I thought it was a cool idea , &quot; said Jennifer Sutherland , 14 , who was among 31 young people to recently take the vow at El Toro Baptist_Church in Orange County . Word of the program has spread quickly . Along with his duties as youth pastor of Tulip Grove Baptist_Church , Ross serves as consultant to the national Baptist Sunday_School Board . From that launch_pad , he promoted the program , and the response was swift . Within two weeks , True Love Waits went interdenominational . About a dozen conservative Christian communities , including the Pentecostal and the Assemblies of God churches , have endorsed it . The Roman_Catholic_Church also signed_on . Next , Baptist missionaries will take it to South_America , Africa and Europe . Most teen-agers learn about the campaign at Christian youth conferences that attract thousands -- from Anaheim to Orlando , Fla. , from Falls Creek , Okla. , to Spokane , Wash . Not everyone at a mega-meeting takes a vow . Still , half a_million youths 12 to 19 are expected to sign pledge cards by summer ' s end . At a Youth for Christ rally scheduled for July in Washington , D.C. , the cards will be driven into the National Mall like so many stakes in a garden . The seeds being planted are already blossoming in unexpected ways . Some single parents , even those raised in the free-love ' 60s , have promised to give_up their liberal dating habits in support of their children ' s pledge . &quot; I do think our values are changing , &quot; said Jim Christensen , 14 , during Sunday_school_class in El Toro . &quot; This isn ' t a fad . People are starting to wise up. &quot; Classmate Joe Howard , 17 , seemed less certain . &quot; In the crevices of their mind , I think teen-agers know abstinence is the solution , &quot; he said , counting unwanted pregnancy and AIDS first among the dangers of an active sex life . Still , he concluded , &quot; it ' s not the popular position. &quot; Twenty years ago , such discussions were unheard of in most Sunday_schools . &quot; In my church , there wasn ' t even a thought of talking_about issues of sex , &quot; said E . Wilbert McCall , pastor at St . Stephen ' s . &quot; Churches have changed . You have to talk_about these things . Back then , we didn ' t have to worry about the problems kids have today . Sex is now a matter of life and death. &quot; Ross said the timing for True Love Waits is right for two reasons : &quot; Our concern about the consequences of teen-age sexual_activity is overwhelming . And what we ' ve done about it so far is not working. &quot; The most recent government statistics show that 54 % of high_school students have had sexual_intercourse . One in 10 girls ages 15 to 19 becomes pregnant each year . And 86 % of all sexually transmitted diseases are contracted by 15- to 29-year-olds . At the same time , young people are putting_off marriage ; the average age is 24 for women and 26 for men . So a 14-year-old who vows to be chaste may have a long_time to test the strength of that commitment . For this and other reasons , educators from both the religious and public sectors question the practicality of Ross ' program . &quot; Along with abstinence , we need to supply kids with information about sexually transmitted disease and contraception , &quot; said Amy Hasselton , a director of education for Planned Parenthood . &quot; Vows of chastity break more often than condoms. &quot; Others worry that teen-agers won ' t be able to keep their promises . &quot; If youths don ' t have the skills to say no , a vow ' s not going_to help them a whole_lot , &quot; said Gilbert Rodriguez , youth director for St . Peter ' s Catholic_Church in Fallbrook . Doug Howe , a minister at the interdenominational Emmanuel Church in Burbank and a local director of the Christian club Young Life , is considering the True Love Waits program for his group . &quot; To have a rally and get kids charged_up isn ' t a bad thing , &quot; he said . &quot; My guess is it works best for kids who ' ve been trained in these values for a long time. &quot; Many of the kids in his group have not . &quot; The question is , &quot; he continued , &quot; do you want to do something that looks really great but doesn ' t reach the kids on a personal level ? We want them to adopt the values , first. &quot; Young Life members discussed chastity vows at their recent weekly get-together . Several girls said they had made a private promise to God , as a gesture of self-respect . But they also agreed with 16-year-old Rebecca Nassaney ' s conclusion : &quot; Other kids would probably say it ' s nice for somebody else , but it ' s not for me. &quot; Mario Gordillo , 16 , doubted that he would take a vow . &quot; It ' s unrealistic , in the society we live_in , &quot; he said . &quot; A person would have to be really strong in their convictions. &quot; St . Stephen ' s Sunday_school teacher Alice Wallace has a quick response to such objections : &quot; Take it off your shoulders . Tell your date , ' I would love to spend the night with you , but the God I serve is holy . And for God ' s sake I don ' t do this. ' &quot; If that doesn ' t work ? &quot; We talk_about what happens if someone breaks the vow , &quot; Wallace said . &quot; I teach them about forgiveness and encourage them to pray for each other. &quot; The girls who attend El Toro Baptist_Church said they feel pressured to become sexually active . &quot; Pressured , from guys , from television , &quot; said Chantal Armstrong , 14 . &quot; The input is sex , sex , sex. &quot; Boys feel it too . &quot; It ' s not studly to be a virgin , &quot; she said . Comments such_as these encouraged Ross to launch his program . &quot; The message teen-agers are receiving from parents , educators and policy-makers is ' we expect you to be sexually active. ' Not that adults intend that . It ' s the way teens are reading it . The inference in the media , in movies , is that teen-agers are sexually active . They feel almost obliged to fulfill adults ' expectations. &quot; The truth is , sex frightens most teen-agers , said Los Angeles psychiatrist Mark Goulston . &quot; It ' s too close , too scary . But if you ' re going to be the only virgin in your high_school , you might have_sex because of the peer pressure. &quot; He believes that chastity vows offer a solution : &quot; They give kids permission to be innocent. &quot; True Love Waits organizers have filled 63 # 000 requests from pastors and youth directors for the curriculum . It outlines classes for parents and teen-agers to take together , as well as some for teen-agers to take alone . Each relies_on Scripture readings that support sexual purity , lasting commitments and family values . The program ends with the church ceremony where the young people , more_than half of them girls , make this pledge : Believing that true love waits , I make a commitment to God , myself , my family , those I date , my future mate and my future children to be sexually pure until the day I enter a covenant marriage relationship . Although True Love Waits is attracting the most attention , similar abstinence programs exist . One of the oldest is Campus Crusade , a Christian organization founded in 1951 . Among the newest is the non-religious Athletes for Abstinence , founded by basketball_player A.C. Green . In addition , California law holds that abstinence must be emphasized in the public_schools ' sex education programs . Karyn Johnson of Downey promotes abstinence on a smaller scale through her Garden Enclosed purity seminars . Johnson , who serves as director of an adoption service outreach program for Calvary Chapel , views chastity as a new form of sexual liberation . &quot; This is almost like the early days of feminism . I talk to groups of girls who say , ' I want control . I can say no. ' &quot; But even some conservatives say vows are not the answer . &quot; It ' s chaos out there , young people are rootless , &quot; said Lisa Sowle Cahill , professor of theology at Boston College and author of &quot; Sex , Gender and Christian Ethics. &quot; She blames America ' s lust for personal freedom , which keeps us from exploring shared common values . Protecting free choice even affects family life , she said : &quot; We find it difficult to talk positive sexual ethics to our kids. &quot; As a result , &quot; there is a vacuum in the culture , &quot; Cahill said . &quot; Kids are caught between the Hollywood myth that everybody ' s doing_it and the very vocal , conservative religious groups that give them messages they can ' t relate to . Chastity becomes something to glom onto. &quot; Ross struggles with no such dilemmas . He simply proclaims a moral revolution in_progress . &quot; True Love Waits has given teen-agers a way to communicate their values to society at_large , &quot; he said . &quot; These are virgins with an attitude. &quot;</TEXT>
