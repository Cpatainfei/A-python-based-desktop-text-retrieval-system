   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; WASHINGTON RESPONDS TEPIDLY TO THE TUMULT ; POLITICS : NEITHER DEMOCRATS NOR REPUBLICANS SEEM INCLINED TOWARD LEGISLATIVE REMEDIES . THE REASON LIES PARTLY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE , AND IN THE COUNTY ' S REPUTATION FOR FREE_ENTERPRISE AND ANTI-TAX FERVOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It may be the biggest municipal bankruptcy case in the country ' s history , but Orange County ' s stunning financial fall is prompting a curiously tepid response in the nation ' s capital . Normally a nerve_center of action and reaction in the aftermath of an emergency involving public assets , official Washington is instead strangely ambivalent over the proper posture on Orange County ' s fiscal tumult and whether there is anything the federal_government should do about it . The contrast to the government ' s usual instinct is striking . From New York City ' s fiscal meltdown in 1975 to the savings and loan crisis to individual bank_failures and plunges in the stock_market , national political_leaders have responded with a predictable explosion of declarations of concern , pleas for federal intervention and plans to address shortcomings with new regulations and tighter government oversight . But in this case , the beleaguered Clinton_Administration has shown little inclination to offer help to affluent Orange County and the incoming Congress shows little appetite for legislative remedies when it convenes next month . This is_due in part to some unique factors_in the Orange County affair , as well as the county ' s reputation as a bastion of free_enterprise and anti-tax fervor . But it is also a sign of changed times . With talk_of sweeping federal budget_cuts and with ascendant conservatives in Congress vowing to roll back regulations and get the government out of people ' s lives , the climate is notably hostile to any rescue effort or regulatory crackdown . &quot; The overall fiscal picture of the federal_government ensures that no one in Washington is going_to have any interest in easing Orange County ' s financial burdens , &quot; said Thomas E . Mann , director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution . &quot; It is also the case that Orange County has the reputation of being one of the wealthiest counties in the country and therefore , if anyone can cope_with a loss of this sort , it ' s them. &quot; Roger H . Davidson , a political_scientist at the University of Maryland , put it a little differently . As far as Washington is concerned , he said , &quot; it ' s been like a tree falling_in the forest without any ears around to hear it. &quot; To some extent , the relative quietude has been a matter of timing . The Orange County calamity broke_in the wake of midterm elections that sent Democrats sprawling and Republicans scrambling to grab control of the congressional reins for the first time since the Eisenhower era . Not only was Congress not in session , but the transfer of power has created a sense of flux . At this point , the incoming Republicans have announced plans to hold two hearings in January on the subjects of volatile derivative investments and the oversight of municipal securities -- issues highlighted by Orange County ' s collapse . The county suffered losses estimated to exceed $ 2 billion as a result of heavy borrowing and investments in high-risk derivatives , complex financial instruments that derive their value from the performance of an underlying security , interest_rate or market index . Also , incoming House Banking Committee Chairman James A . Leach ( R-Iowa ) , a moderate who does not echo the prevailing conservative approach in his interest in possible regulatory redress , also plans to hold a hearing on Orange County . But any legislation that he or others propose is likely to run_into opposition from powerful Republican colleagues as well as the politically influential securities industry . The Clinton_Administration insists that it has done everything that it could . To this point , that has largely amounted to convening a special markets working group , which was established after the 1987 stock_market crash to survey the situation . The group ' s answer : caution other localities to invest prudently . &quot; The federal_government has no direct legal authority over the investments of local_government , &quot; said a senior official at the Treasury_Department , which heads the group . &quot; Those are controlled by state statutes and local ordinances. &quot; The official , who spoke on the condition that she not be named , said Orange County ' s economic and political status as a Republican stronghold has nothing to do with the Administration ' s passive position on a situation that is expected to force hundreds of layoffs and deep local spending_cuts and jeopardize projects such_as the construction of schools and courthouses . &quot; Ultimately , Orange County is going_to figure_out how it will get_out of this situation , just like New York City or Bridgeport , Conn. , or San Jose &quot; did when those cities were embroiled in a financial crisis , the official said . In this respect , the Administration has an unlikely ally : Orange County ' s congressional delegation . &quot; I don ' t think the federal_government can do anything to help them out , &quot; said Rep . Ron Packard ( R-Oceanside ) . &quot; I am convinced they can work themselves through it . I don ' t think they should have any special dispensation. &quot; Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) was characteristically blunter : &quot; that ' s not on our watch . that ' s the ( county ) supervisors ' battle. &quot; To the extent that Congress can help Orange County recover , said Rep . Christopher Cox ( R-Newport Beach ) , it will do so by lifting cumbersome federal mandates on counties . &quot; that ' s the kind of solution you will get , &quot; he said . Governors and mayors , particularly Republicans , have long demanded that the federal_government desist_from handing_down costly &quot; unfunded mandates. &quot; In time of need , this kind of stand_for greater autonomy also makes_it harder to ask_for federal assistance . Meanwhile , Democrats , who tend to be more receptive to bailouts and regulatory redress , look_on Orange County as the gilded heartland of the right_wing , a place that gave the country Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and an airport named after John Wayne . &quot; The free-market philosophy comes_with pluses and minuses and one of the minuses is that sometimes you stumble , &quot; said Rep . Barney Frank ( D-Mass. ) , a member of the House Banking Committee . &quot; They made a conscious decision to gamble so I don ' t think we should bail them out . It was quite irresponsible to have done this with borrowed money . They should deal with the consequences of their actions. &quot; A liberal activist was even less charitable . The Orange County bankruptcy &quot; is like a fire_sale at Gucci ' s , &quot; said Colleen O ' Connor , deputy director of the Campaign for New Priorities , which advocates shifting money from defense spending to urban programs . Among Republicans , Leach has been unusually outspoken in calling_for regulatory reform in the wake of the Orange County situation . At a news_conference this month , he said that he intended to introduce legislation that would require municipal securities to operate under the same disclosure requirements as corporate issuers . Cox has called_for similar legislation . &quot; In my judgment , in a democracy , municipalities ought to lead the way in full disclosure , &quot; Leach said . &quot; It is perverse to think that public officials should be held to a lower disclosure criteria than private corporations. &quot; This would require more_than 55 # 000 public bodies that issue bonds to submit periodic certified reports that meet rigorous accounting standards to the Securities and Exchange Commission . State investment issues now fall_under the jurisdiction of the states and not the SEC , with the exception of potential violations of the anti-fraud provisions of securities laws . Opponents , including the securities industry and state and local_government representatives , say that such a requirement would entail substantial costs to pay_for auditors and lawyers to prepare the reports , would subject local_governments to expanded liability and would constitute a new federal mandate . A GOP aide on the House Commerce Committee , which has jurisdiction over the securities industry , said that most Republicans on the panel would oppose such legislation . SEC Commissioner Richard Roberts said that such legislation is not necessary because the commission has approved new reporting requirements in the past year &quot; that should be completed and implemented before any new projects are started. &quot; These rules would bar broker-dealers from underwriting bonds as of July 3 , unless they verify that the issuer has agreed to disclosure of annual financial information and material events that could affect their bonds . Leach has also vowed to reintroduce legislation to strengthen regulations governing the investment of derivatives , which he has called &quot; the new wild card in international finance. &quot; &quot; To me , one of the most remarkable aspects of ( Orange County ) is that there is no accountability here in Washington because no accountability has been decisively and thoughtfully placed , &quot; Leach said . In contrast , Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and other federal financial regulators have said that they view derivatives as a valuable way to balance risk in today ' s rapidly changing financial markets . Kevin Phillips , a conservative commentator , said the Administration and Congress have been so remiss in failing to address the dangers of derivatives that they are &quot; either collaborators or guilty of regulatory omission. &quot; He said that key Administration officials came from Wall_Street firms that reap large profits from derivative trading and that securities brokers had showered the major political_parties and lawmakers with campaign funds . Whatever the broader regulatory implications , some said that Washington ' s lack of angst over Orange County ' s situation is widely shared throughout the country . William Schneider , a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute , sees parallels with New York ' s fiscal crisis , when the nation ' s largest city narrowly averted bankruptcy . Many conservatives then believed that the city ' s plight was well-deserved . &quot; As Orange County is the symbol of excessive conservatism and freewheeling capitalism , New York was regarded_as the symbol of excessive liberalism and the corruption of the welfare_state , &quot; Schneider said . &quot; If there was more concern about New York -- and there wasn ' t a lot of it -- it was because New York was the financial capital of the country. &quot; Times staff writers James Risen and Gebe Martinez contributed to this story .</TEXT>
