   <HEADLINE> MORE TAX MONEY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the best concealed efforts to redistribute our money hides behind a bill introduced by state Sen . Robert Presley ( D-Riverside ) and signed into law by the governor . This bill establishes Ventura and San Diego counties for a pilot_program to reduce air pollutants . The target pollution miles per vehicle will be determined and the figure must be reduced by 5 % per year . Should the prescribed mileage be exceeded , a smog test is required after one year . SB 2050 also indicates that low-income drivers may be forced by economic circumstances to rely_on older high-emission motor_vehicles . Therefore , programs to help low-income drivers acquire cleaner vehicles are appropriate . Now , the process of collecting seed money begins . Should you buy a new car you may receive an invitation from the Department of Consumer Affairs to pay $ 39 and then you do not need a smog check for four years . The cover letter states , &quot; The $ 39 will become seed money to purchase the worse polluting vehicles on_the_road for scrap and help fund repairs of other dirty air cars. &quot; You will be pleased to help pay_for someone else ' s auto repairs . This is but one method devised by bureaucrats to wring money out of the taxpayer . Our elected officials , forgetting whom they represent , too often seem to readily agree with such suggestions on the basis that the money can be raised and some bureaucrat thinks it is a good cause . It is high_time that our elected officials stop meeting every problem by spending more of our money . ELOISE BROWN Moorpark</TEXT>
