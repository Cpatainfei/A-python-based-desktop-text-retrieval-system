   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; PSYCHIATRIST CAUGHT UP IN MURDER MYSTERY ' PASSION '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Maybe the third time Scott Bakula plays an L.A. psychiatrist will be the charm . He got knocked_off early on in &quot; Color of Money , &quot; and now in &quot; A Passion to Kill , &quot; a relentlessly routine psychological murder mystery , he ' s done_in by a lackluster script . Bakula ' s Dr. David Lawson receives a double whammy when he meets the beautiful , regal Diana ( Chelsea Field ) , the bride of his best_friend Jerry Chamberlain ( John Getz ) . On the one hand , Diana rapidly displays scary mood swings that leave her consumed with brief , perplexing outbursts of rage , and on the other , she attracts David profoundly . Despite the repeated warnings of a friendly colleague ( France Nuyen ) , David allows himself to become swiftly ensnared in an affair with the woman he ' s suppsed to be unofficially counseling at the urgent request of her husband . Soon the corpses start piling_up , and the question becomes simple : Is Diana a crazy woman going_around knocking_off every man who makes an unwelcome pass at her or is she being set_up ? Director Rick King keeps us guessing , but he can ' t keep us caring ; David and Diana are too underwritten , too uninteresting , to involve us despite Bakula and Field ' s best efforts . There ' s no doubt that David is caught_up in a grand passion , but that ' s no excuse for him and Diana to be such glum characters . The result is that Sheila Kelley , as David ' s ex-girlfriend , becomes the film ' s most sparkling presence . This is a sleek , painstaking production with great-looking stars and settings , but its Sunset 5 engagement seems but a stopover on the way to the video store . * MPAA rating : R , for strong sexuality , and some violence and language . Times guidelines : The sex is fairly steamy , and definitely not for youngsters ; the violence and language are not excessive for the genre .
