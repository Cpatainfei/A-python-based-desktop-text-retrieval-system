   <HEADLINE> FROSTS HEAT_UP DEMAND FOR COLOMBIAN COFFEE ; AGRICULTURE : DAMAGED CROPS IN BRAZIL MEAN A BOOM FOR OTHER GROWERS AFTER FOUR YEARS IN THE RED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two bitter freezes in Brazil have pulled this country out of a four-year crisis and pushed it toward what could be one of the greatest coffee booms in its history . Coffee growers in this Andean nation , which produces more coffee than any other except Brazil , have suffered through four years of low prices . But they have watched their prospects soar since frost hit Brazil on June 27 . A more brutal cold_front struck Brazil ' s most productive coffee district July 10 , and experts here estimated losses at 40 % to 50 % of Brazil ' s 1994-95 harvest . With coffee prices skyrocketing in world markets , Juan Manuel Santos , Colombia ' s minister of foreign trade , predicted a bonanza not seen since the mid-1970s . The National Federation of Coffee Growers announced the second increase in a month in the price it pays suppliers , to $ 199.08 for a 125-kilo load from $ 173.43. &quot; This is a happy end , after four hard years and complicated negotiations &quot; between the government and coffee growers , said Jorge Cardenas Gutierrez , general_manager of the coffee federation . Finance_Minister Rudolph Hommes exulted : &quot; The Virgin has now appeared to us twice. &quot; He was referring to the most recent price rise and to more gradual increases over the last 60 days that resulted from a six-month retention plan led by Colombia , Brazil and Central_American_nations seeking to control export sales and force prices up . Colombian growers , who have been operating in the red , are feeling relief . Since the International Coffee Agreement -- which set world export quotas and kept prices relatively high -- expired in 1989 , prices had nose-dived to 55 cents a pound from $ 1.40. Coffee had represented prosperity otherwise unavailable in rural Colombia . Towns and municipalities accustomed to having access to roads , telephones and electricity went_into a tailspin . Coffee growers , accustomed to the nation ' s highest standard_of_living , despaired of their futures . Since the crisis in Brazil , which supplies about 22 % of world coffee demand , the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture estimates that demand will exceed supply by 9 million sacks next year . Experts predict that Colombian coffee prices could exceed $ 3 a pound before year ' s end . Government planners here have stopped talking_about keeping coffee growers afloat and started worrying about inflation from the foreign earnings the boom is expected to generate . Still , most growers do not expect immediate recovery . Many farms are deeply in debt , and many are fighting a rear-guard action against the coffee borer , or la broca , an insect that invaded plantations in 1993 and can now be found on 40 % of Colombia ' s 2.7 million acres of coffee land . &quot; The crisis hit us very hard , &quot; said Alexander Garcia , a third-generation farmer who sold vehicles and apartments to keep his 87-acre plantation going_in the face of heavy losses last year . &quot; We ' ve lost a lot of money and still aren ' t being paid what a shipment of coffee is worth. &quot; This year ' s production of 11.5 million sacks is far short of last year ' s harvest of 15 million sacks , because many growers have cut_back . And while growers are trying to increase production to take_advantage of the rising prices , they are wary of the pitfalls of a boom and the dangers of triggering another price drop . &quot; If prices rise too high and production soars , we could saturate the market again and cause prices to slump , &quot; said one official of Colombia ' s coffee federation , who estimated the ideal harvest at 15 million sacks . &quot; Excessive prices could also diminish consumption , which would be against our interests. &quot;</TEXT>
