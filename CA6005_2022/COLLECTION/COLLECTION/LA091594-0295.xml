   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING : CAMP CUISINE : WILD IN THE COUNTRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the world of fishing camps , there is no take-out food . No carry-out roast chicken or pasta_salad . No bakeries . All you get is wonderful wilderness , bald_eagles , stunning sunsets and shimmering lakes . And home cooking . Home cooking is alive and well in fishing camps -- the only game in town . And it ' s the way cooking used to be : old fashioned , unsophisticated , good tasting . Fried fish , barbecued pork chops , bacon and eggs , wild blueberry hot_cakes , grilled cheese sandwiches with buttered homemade bread , cream of tomato soup -- these are the foods when life is enjoyed in the great outdoors . Desserts are in a category unto themselves . Forget diets and restraint . Judy Ottoson , for 18 years the cook in the Kishkutena fishing camp , has a repertoire of great dessert recipes handed_down from her mother , who held the job before her . * I especially enjoy the chocolate chip crisps , the tart plum ( or rhubarb ) meringue torte and the Kishkutena camp cake , a hit from the ' 50s . * These are chocolate_chip_cookies as they used to be : thin , crisp and somewhat delicate . CHOCOLATE CHIP CRISPS 1 / 2 cup unsalted butter 6 tablespoons brown_sugar , packed 6 tablespoons granulated sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup flour 1 / 2 teaspoon salt 1 / 2 teaspoon baking soda 1 cup semisweet chocolate morsels In bowl use mixer to cream butter , brown and granulated sugars , egg and vanilla . Add flour , salt and baking soda . Mix until combined . Use wooden spoon to stir in chocolate morsels . Spoon rounded teaspoon of dough onto lightly greased baking sheet , leaving 2 inches between cookies . Bake on center oven rack at 350 degrees until golden brown , about 8 minutes . Cool completely on cooling rack . Can be kept as long as 5 days at room_temperature in airtight container and up_to 3 months in freezer , wrapped airtight . Makes 5 dozen 3-inch cookies . Each cookie contains about : 45 calories ; 22 mg sodium ; 8 mg cholesterol ; 2 grams fat ; 4 grams carbohydrates ; protein ; 0.01 gram fiber . * Ottoson was given this recipe by her cousin . Actually a bar cookie , it sports rhubarb in the early summer and the same quantity of any tart plum in August and September . Both fruits contrast with the sweet meringue and neither requires peeling . Once the meringue is baked on the cookie , it must be served within a_few hours as meringues weep on standing , especially on humid days . RHUBARB-MERINGUE TORTE 1 cup unsalted butter , softened Sugar Salt Flour 3 large egg yolks 1 / 2 cup evaporated milk 4 large stalks rhubarb , cut_into 1 / 2-inch dice , about 4 cups 4 large egg_whites , room_temperature 1 teaspoon vanilla In bowl use mixer to cream butter , 2 tablespoons sugar and dash salt until fluffy , about 2 minutes . Add 2 cups flour . Combine well . Spread dough evenly over bottom of greased 9x13-inch baking pan . Work by hand through piece of plastic_wrap to make dough as even as possible . Bake at 350 degrees until firm but not well browned , about 15 minutes . In bowl use mixer to beat egg_yolks , 1 cup sugar , 2 tablespoons flour and evaporated milk until smooth . Spread_over top of warm baked crust . Sprinkle diced rhubarb evenly over filling . Bake at 350 degrees until mixture sets , about 40 to 45 minutes . Can be set_aside several hours at room_temperature before baking meringue . In bowl use mixer to whip egg_whites and dash salt until whites hold shape and are still glossy but not stiff . Add 1 / 3 cup sugar by tablespoons with mixer running . Mix_in vanilla . Spread_over cookie base , which can be hot , warm or room_temperature . Bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned , about 12 minutes . Let cool . To serve , use sharp knife to cut_into squares . Use metal spatula to transfer to serving plates . Makes 8 to 10 servings . Each of 8 servings contains about : 521 calories ; 110 mg sodium ; 169 mg cholesterol ; 27 grams fat ; 64 grams carbohydrates ; 8 grams protein ; 0.51 gram fiber . * Normally I ' m not one to resort_to cake_mixes and instant fillings but Ottoson ' s version of a ' 50s 7-Up cake is moist , nicely textured , slightly lemony and tastes absolutely delectable with the pineapple topping . It ' s even better the next day . KISHKUTENA CAMP CAKE 1 ( 1-pound , 2 1 / 4-ounce ) box yellow cake_mix 1 ( 3.4-ounce ) package instant lemon pudding 4 large eggs 3 / 4 cup oil 1 1 / 4 cups lemon-flavored soda such_as 7-Up ( 10 ounces ) Pineapple Topping In bowl use mixer to combine cake_mix , lemon pudding , eggs and oil until smooth . Mix_in lemon-flavored soda . Transfer to greased 13x9-inch baking pan . Use rubber spatula to spread batter evenly . Bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned and wood pick inserted into center comes_out clean , about 40 minutes . Let stand 10 minutes on rack before frosting . Spread Pineapple Topping , either hot or warm , over warm cake . To serve cut_into squares . Makes 1 ( 13x9-inch ) cake , about 12 servings . Each serving contains about : 467 calories ; 393 mg sodium ; 56 mg cholesterol ; 27 grams fat ; 58 grams carbohydrates ; 2 grams protein ; 0.08 gram fiber . Pineapple Topping 2 large eggs , beaten 1 tablespoon flour 1 / 2 cup unsalted butter 1 / 2 cup sugar 1 cup canned crushed pineapple , drained 3 tablespoons fresh lemon_juice Combine eggs , flour , butter , sugar and pineapple in 1-quart nonaluminum saucepan .
