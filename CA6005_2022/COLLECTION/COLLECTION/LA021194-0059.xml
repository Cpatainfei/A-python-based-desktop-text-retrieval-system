   <HEADLINE> UNTIL JAPAN REINVENTS ITSELF , ONLY A RESULTS-ORIENTED POLICY WILL WORK ; TRADE : CRITICS OF THIS APPROACH ARE WORKING UNDER THE FALSE PREMISE THAT IT HAS A STANDARD MARKET_ECONOMY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With today ' s summit between President Clinton and Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in mind , several editorialists and academics have attacked the Administration ' s results-oriented &quot; framework &quot; negotiations as protectionist managed trade and have called instead for reliance on traditional macroeconomic tools to solve the trade problem with Japan . They couldn ' t be more wrong . These commentators begin from the dual premise that Japan ' s is a normal market_economy and that the problem is the size of the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan . They make four major points : * In a world of multilateral trade , bilateral balances are unimportant . * The size of the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan is_due to high consumption and low savings rates in the United States coupled with the reverse in Japan . In particular , the trade_deficit is largely a reflection of the U.S. budget_deficit , which by stimulating the economy sucks_in imports . * The solution is not sectoral negotiations over such things as auto parts and insurance , but stimulation of the Japanese economy ( so that it will suck_in imports ) coupled with deficit reduction here . * Management of the exchange_rate to strengthen the yen and weaken the dollar should reduce the deficit by making U.S. goods less expensive in Japan and Japanese goods more expensive in the United States . While superficially convincing , under closer examination this analysis is misleading . The fact that Japan ' s most powerful politician , Ichiro Ozawa , has written a book urging Japan to become a &quot; normal country &quot; is a powerful indication that Japan ' s is not a standard market_economy . The editorialists ' criticism that the Administration ' s insistence on measurable results in various industries will lead to heavy-handed management or cartelization of the economy is valid only if such management does not already exist . But recent scandals in Japan have demonstrated that despite years of insistence by top Japanese leaders that such industries as construction and finance were completely open , in fact they were completely rigged . Indeed , in some cases , the same bureaucrats who insisted that Americans should just try a little harder were precisely the ones who winked as Japanese brokers guaranteed their major corporate clients profits on their stock-market transactions . Even when the Japanese do import , as in the case of coal or agricultural commodities , the importers form a buying monopoly to exert maximum downward pressure on prices . This in not exactly what Adam Smith had_in_mind . Just as Japan ' s is not a standard market_economy , so the problem is not merely the size of the trade imbalance . Among the most important U.S. exports to Japan are unprocessed logs , scrap aluminum and waste paper . Theoretically , we could cut_down enough trees and gather_up enough empty soda_cans and scrap paper to balance these accounts . But doing so while being locked_out of Japanese markets for telecommunications_equipment , medical devices and sophisticated services would not be acceptable to most Americans . While bilateral imbalances are not normally cause for concern in a multilateral system , our deficit with Japan is so large , has persisted for so_long and is so similar to imbalances Japan maintains with its other trading partners as_to suggest something amiss in the trading system . The savings and budget-deficit arguments are also misleading . Although overall , savings and investment rates and budget_deficits dictate the size of a nation ' s trade_balances , these factors have nothing to do with the size and shape of a particular bilateral balance . Factors such_as trade_barriers , collusive business arrangements and regulatory strictures predominate here . The proof of this is the fact that Japan has a trade surplus with countries such_as Singapore , which have higher savings rates and even greater budget surpluses than Japan . But the U.S. budget_deficit has fallen by nearly $ 100 billion in the past year , yet the trade_deficit with Japan has soared . Obviously the conventional explanation doesn ' t work in a bilateral context . Nor will the conventional prescriptions of fiscal stimulus and exchange-rate manipulation work either . The structural factors that make Japan ' s economy unique also result in a low propensity to import . This and the large gap between export and import levels means that an impossibly large stimulus would be necessary to reduce the trade surplus significantly . There are also limits to the potential effect of a stronger yen . Based on current propensities to import in both the United States and Japan , an exchange_rate of 60 yen to $ 1 would be necessary just to halve the current bilateral U.S. trade_deficit . But at such a_level , world financial markets would be in chaos , and it is extremely unlikely to occur . The only real solution is to change the propensity to import in Japan , and that means changing the structure of its economy . While it would be nice if the Japanese government and industry would recognize this and act accordingly , until they do , the Clinton_Administration has no choice but to keep pressing for concrete structural changes that yield measurable results .</TEXT>
