   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI : HEED RULES IN TAKING IRA FUNDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q . Two years after being forced to take an early retirement , I find I could really use some of my individual_retirement_account funds to cover my living expenses . The only problem is that I am 57 years old . I understand that there is some provision in the tax code permitting taxpayers under age 59 1 / 2 to make early withdrawals without penalty . Can you explain the rules ? -- J.P . A . Able-bodied taxpayers under age 59 1 / 2 are permitted to withdraw funds from their IRAs without penalty if the disbursements are made under one of three annuity-type formulas approved by the Internal Revenue Service . Although no penalty will be imposed for early withdrawal , the funds will still be subject_to ordinary income_tax unless they consist_of after-tax contributions . Disabled taxpayers are entitled to make early withdrawals without penalty under a different , more lenient set of rules . Taxpayers who make early withdrawals must take disbursements , at the rate determined by the formula of their choosing , for either five years or until reaching age 59 1 / 2 , whichever occurs later . The withdrawal formula cannot change until the minimum period has been completed . In your case , this would mean you would have to take disbursements for at least five years . After that point , you could change the withdrawal amount or discontinue payments without penalty . What are the disbursement formulas ? First is the simple life_expectancy method , which is the easiest to calculate but generally provides smaller annual payments than the other methods : You calculate the annual withdrawal by dividing your account balance by your life_expectancy , as determined by IRS actuarial_tables . ( You may also use your life_expectancy and that of your IRA beneficiary , although this would give you an even lower annual withdrawal. ) The IRS life_expectancy tables are detailed in IRS Publication No . 939 . The second method is often referred to as the amortization method because you amortize your account balance like a mortgage , using one of the life_expectancy tables mentioned above plus a long-term interest_rate deemed appropriate by the IRS . In private rulings , the IRS has approved the use of interest_rates based on certain prevailing market conditions . Under this system , your annual withdrawal will be higher than under the life_expectancy method because the balance is increased each year by the selected interest_rate . The third method is similar to the amortization formula but allows taxpayers to use insurance mortality_tables , which project shorter life_expectancy than the IRS tables . The result is a higher annual disbursement than for either of the above formulas . One last note : If you decide to use either the second or third formula , you would be wise_to consult a tax professional to make_sure your disbursements qualify for the penalty exception . Calculating Cost Basis of Inherited Stocks Q . My uncle died , leaving us some stocks . What is the cost basis of those shares ? Some people tell us it is their fair market_value on the date of his death ; others say they can be valued at any point within six months after his death . -- W.L.W . A . If no estate_taxes are_due , assets are generally valued as of the date of death . However , if taxes are_due , the estate executor may value the assets as of the date of death , as of six months after the death or as of the date of sale of any of the assets in the estate if the sale occurs within six months of the death . The selection , which covers all_the assets in an estate , must be made upon the filing of the estate_tax return , which is generally due nine months after the death . Heir Can Escape Tax_Liability on Home Q . I own my home and want to leave it to my girlfriend , who has been taking_care of me in what I think may be my final days . I have never used the $ 125 # 000 profit exemption on a home sale . I am thinking_of entering into a sales agreement with her that says she has paid me $ 140 # 000 for the home_in order to establish that as her cost basis . The grant deed turning the house over to her will be filed upon my death . Will the trustee of my living trust be able to claim the $ 125 # 000 deduction on my home sale profit under this arrangement ? -- M.R.S . A . Our experts believe you are going_to a lot of trouble to achieve your ends , which essentially are to give your girlfriend your home upon your death without sticking her with a huge potential capital_gain upon its sale . Rather than the convoluted scheme you propose , why not just leave the home to her in your will ? The value of the house will be reset as of your date of death , so she will not be getting an appreciated asset on which there will be unpaid tax . So what if you die without ever having used your $ 125 # 000 deduction ? There could be worse things left undone at death . Another alternative would be to &quot; sell &quot; your girlfriend the home with no money down right now . You could use your $ 125 # 000 exemption , and in your will you could forgive your girlfriend the unpaid balance . If your estate is valued at less than $ 600 # 000 , there will be no estate_taxes due the government . Giving Without Gift_Tax Consequences Q . I am confused about how much money a couple can give to their son and his spouse without triggering gift_tax consequences . F.F . A . You and your wife may each give $ 10 # 000 per year to as_many people as you want without gift_tax consequences . Under these limits , you and your wife could give your son and his wife a total of $ 40 # 000 per year -- $ 10 # 000 from each of you to each of them .</TEXT>
