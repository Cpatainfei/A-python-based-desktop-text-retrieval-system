   <HEADLINE> HAITI MILITARY MAY NOT RESIST IF U.S. INVADES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. military could hardly ask_for an easier target . If the United States intervenes in Haiti , as President Clinton has been threatening for several months , U.S. troops are unlikely to encounter any fierce opposition . In fact , there may be no opposition at all , military strategists say . Haiti has virtually no air_force or navy , defense experts say , and the Haitian army -- though 7 # 400 strong on paper -- is poorly equipped and assigned to a variety of side jobs , such_as firefighting . Its combat force consists_of only three infantry companies and one heavy-weapons company , and most of its equipment is old and badly maintained . Only a handful of its 11 armored personnel_carriers work , for example . Moreover , Haitian military sources say that their contingency plans in the event of a U.S. invasion call_for most of the island nation ' s troops to &quot; evaporate &quot; -- that is , to take_off their uniforms and blend_in with the public rather than put_up a fight . The few Haitian officers and enlisted men who do remain in uniform will stay in their barracks and offer no resistance , hoping to avoid being singled_out for retribution by the invading U.S. forces or by Haitian civilians looking_for scapegoats . One officer said Haitian army commanders hope that by offering no resistance , they will be able to avoid large-scale arrests during the expected U.S. occupation of the country and will be able to dissuade American officials from trying to destroy the Haitian military as an institution . &quot; They all think that the Americans ultimately will have to turn_to ( the Haitian army ) to maintain order , &quot; a foreign analyst said . &quot; They think the Americans won ' t have the stomach to shoot . . . civilians . So ( eventually they will have to ) ask the Haitian army to step_in &quot; to restore order . That does not mean that the invading U.S. forces can be assured of avoiding casualties . Military experts warn that , as in any such situation , there is likely to be danger from snipers and gangs of thugs . And , for all_the expected acceptance of U.S. military authority , there still are a_few groups -- some connected with the current Haitian strongman , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , and the army -- that have vowed to mount some resistance . Cedras himself , interviewed on CNN in the Haitian_capital of Port-au-Prince over the weekend , continues to take a hard line , saying that military preparations are being made to defend the country . &quot; If you intervene , it will mean bloodshed on both sides . . . . Every ( military ) barrack is filling_up with young people who are fighting to sign_up and get training because they know they must defend their country , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s not a matter of Gen . Cedras . It ' s not a matter of ( ousted President Jean-Bertrand ) Aristide . The matter is to defend Haiti. &quot; Intelligence_officers say the Haitian military has distributed at least 1 # 000 rifles to its civilian allies over the last two months , including Galil assault_rifles and other automatic weapons . One self-appointed militia , headed by Romeo Aloun , a U.S. citizen who is the son of a prominent Haitian businessman , has between 35 and 50 heavily armed followers who have been setting_up nighttime roadblocks and imposing their own form of security at the airport . There also is some uncertainty in Haiti about which forces would deal with quelling looting and protecting private_property during an invasion . Presumably U.S. troops would help keep order , but they may be busy with their broader mission . One reason that U.S. planners are so confident of little resistance is that the Haitians historically have been nonviolent and friendly to foreigners , especially Americans . The infamous Tontons Macoutes hit squad was disarmed years ago . One senior U.S. military planner -- a three-star general -- told reporters earlier this year that even now during visits to Port-au-Prince he goes jogging unaccompanied by security_guards , occasionally even passing Haitian military_headquarters . Moreover , Haiti ' s few militiamen and other potential resistance groups do not have rocket-propelled grenades and other more destructive weapons such_as their counterparts in Somalia had . Private arms caches are thought to be very limited . In any case , U.S. officials are planning to take a firm stance from the start to discourage resistance or sniping . &quot; We will be arriving in_force , ready and willing to shoot , &quot; a U.S. official who has been involved in the planning said . &quot; We don ' t expect any resistance , and we expect we won ' t have to do anything but put locks on the gates to keep them from running_away , &quot; one military expert said . But , he added , &quot; No one will be taking any chances. &quot; After U.S. troops have secured the Haitian_capital and imposed a curfew , they are expected to spread_out and control the rest of the country . Within 24 hours , they will take_over other important cities such_as Cap-Haitien , Gonaives , Jacmel , Jeremie and Hinche . Pentagon planners say the real problem is likely to come_after the island is &quot; secure &quot; and that order will have to be maintained during the several months required to help Aristide form a new government and restore the island ' s economy . Haiti : An Invasion Blueprint U.S. strategists say the Battle of Haiti , if there is one , would be over in a scant eight hours to two days . Although U.S. troops would sustain some casualties in the fray -- or from sniper fire after the ground fighting ended -- the number of killed or wounded would probably be small . How an invasion might take_place , according to military analysts : INVASION FORCE : A total of about 15 # 000 soldiers and Marines is predicted . They would land from ships and helicopters or by parachute from C-141 and C-130 transports . THE OPERATION PHASE ONE : The night before the actual invasion , U.S. special forces teams -- including Army Rangers , special operations forces and Navy SEALs -- would land under cover of darkness at the twomajor cities of Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien and secure the docks , the airports and the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince . They also would take_control of a half_a_dozen major roads -- such_as Highway 102 to the Dominican_Republic and routes 100 and 300 . And they may capture Ile de la Gonave , a small island just off Port-au-Prince . PHASE TWO : Just before dawn , an initial force of 2 # 000 Marines from the Marine expeditionary unit aboard the helicopter carrier Wasp would come ashore in landing_craft , both to help secure Port-au-Prince and to evacuate any Americans who may be in danger . Navy or Air_Force planes could be called_upon to provide close air support for Army and Marine ground troops , but most likely they would not be needed . There is little to bomb in Haiti , and the risk of civilian deaths from bombing_runs is high . PHASE THREE : A few minutes later -- or hours , if the situation warrants -- elements of the 82nd and 101st airborne divisions would come ashore or parachute in to mop_up after the Marines . The soldiers would set_up staging_areas at Port-au-Prince , Cap-Haitien and , possibly , Port-de-Paix on the island ' s north coast . They then would swarm through Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien and deal with any guerrilla groups or snipers who have not surrendered . THE REBEL LEADERS It is not clear whether U.S. troops would try to capture Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and other leaders . Finding such targets in a country such_as Haiti often is very difficult and risks making martyrs of them , as was the case with Panamanian Gen . Manuel A . Noriega , who eluded U.S. troops for days after the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989 . Instead , Washington may let Cedras and his aids flee to the Dominican_Republic or perhaps another country . WHAT U.S. TROOPS WOULD FACE Haiti air_force and navy are very small , and the Haitian army is poorly equipped and spread thin . Most of its equipment is old and badly maintained . ARMY Soldiers : 7 # 400 active-duty Haitian troops and officers Equipment 11 armored personnel_carriers 9 towed artillery pieces 37 mortars 20 antitank guns 30 recoilless rifles 16 air-defense guns AIR_FORCE Airmen : 150 active-duty airmen and officers Aircraft : 2 combat aircraft , 4 transport aircraft , 9 training aircraft NAVY Sailors : 250 active-duty sailors and officers Ships : 1 patrol craft plus 3 miscellaneous small_boats , 1 shore base ( Port-au-Prince ) AFTER NATION IS SECURED Pentagon planners say the real problem would likely come during the several months when an international force would have to maintain order as President Jean-Bertrand Aristide tries to form a new government . U.S. forces would be joined by a multinational peacekeeping force operating under U.N. auspices that would swell the total force to about 30 # 000 troops . The U.S. troops would gradually withdraw , dropping to no more_than a_few thousand by the end of the first month . U.S. and U.N. troops almost certainly would have to remain on the island for months , both to help provide security and to train the new government . TIME ESTIMATES * Invasion : Between eight hours and two days . * Restoring government : Two months to a year .
