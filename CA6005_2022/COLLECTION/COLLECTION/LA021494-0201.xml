   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : HOW TV NEWS SPIRALED INTO ' TABLOIDGATE ' ; TELEVISION : ' FRONTLINE ' EXAMINES THE STATE OF JOURNALISM WHEN RESPECTABLE MEDIA GET INTO BED WITH TAINTED TABLOIDS WHILE COVERING THE LIKES OF MICHAEL JACKSON AND TONYA HARDING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The media scandal of the 1990s is Tabloidgate , a crossing of genes resulting in a homely journalistic hybrid whose shared interests range from Michael Jackson to Tonya Harding . This alliance of Tainted Tabloids and Respectable Press in the cause of banner headlines has produced an alien , grotesquely formed multi-being that includes television newsmagazines , a fast-propagating subspecies of which there are now so many varieties you can hardly keep count . You see some of them feasting on the world ' s richest troubled entertainer in &quot; Tabloid Truth : The Michael Jackson Scandal , &quot; Tuesday ' s &quot; Frontline &quot; documentary on PBS ( 9 p.m. on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15 ) . &quot; Tabloid Truth &quot; is producer Thomas Lennon ' s and reporter Richard Ben Cramer ' s sardonic tell-all account of the media who now tell all . The program traces , step by step , the story that still threatens to hijack Jackson ' s career and notes the strategies of such rival predators as &quot; Hard Copy &quot; and &quot; A Current Affair. &quot; Although it ' s a whiz-bang hour that you watch with fascination , there ' s nothing pretty about lions tearing apart a wildebeest . What begins with a free-lance reporter giving information about Jackson to KNBC-TV Channel 4 immediately becomes the global pursuit of the decade , one luring the hordes of Fleet_Street and all_the other global blood sniffers . Awaiting them here are U.S. print and TV tabloids and the Legitimate Press , and soon this pride of competing big_cats and their scavenging tag-a-longs are hunting en masse , one undistinguishable from the other . On the screen are photogs in L.A. aiming their telescopic lenses like Son-of-Sam snipers and just-arrived hungry British tabloiders , hearts pounding and young eyes shining with excitement , as if this were their Normandy Landing . On comes the rest of the cast , the warring lawyers and private_eyes , the paid , greedy informants from Jackson ' s own camp , the coattails hanging_on to other coattails -- and , of course , the Dragon Lady herself , LaToya . &quot; In the tabloids , it doesn ' t matter if it ' s true , &quot; someone volunteers . &quot; If you ' ve got someone to say it ' s true , that ' s what matters. &quot; Of course , the stalkers some time ago began following the scent of other prey . Last Thursday night , for example , saw Dueling Tonyas on the syndicated &quot; Inside Edition &quot; and the CBS News_program &quot; Eye to Eye With Connie Chung , &quot; each wielding its very own &quot; exclusive &quot; interview of the Lillehammer-bound skater . Under normal circumstances , you ' d have given trash-savvy &quot; Inside Edition &quot; the edge , except that Chung had prepped herself by spending the week grubbing it out rink side with the other paparazzi in Portland . No stranger to hardball , it was &quot; Eye to Eye &quot; herself , after all , who earlier had gotten Heidi Fleiss to tell America about her new_line of jammies . As her network ' s Tonyalogist , Chung occupied the expert ' s chair on &quot; CBS This Morning &quot; Friday . &quot; What was the pressure like on this human_being ? &quot; asked a rapt Harry Smith . Who knows , maybe next time Harding will come_in and get quizzed about Chung . In Los Angeles , KCAL-TV Channel 9 ' s award-winning news used a big chunk of Harding ' s &quot; Inside Edition &quot; interview on Wednesday while also reporting rumors -- disclosed on the syndicated &quot; Hard Copy &quot; -- that she had signed to pose for Playboy . It was not the first time that material from the two tabloid programs had been featured on a Channel 9 newscast . The hybridization is much broader , though . So_much so that when it comes_to some topics , the Dueling Dianes -- Dimond of &quot; Hard Copy &quot; and Sawyer of ABC ' s &quot; PrimeTime Live &quot; -- seem almost interchangeable . * A magazine writer preparing an in-depth story on Michael Jackson spoke glowingly to me of &quot; Hard Copy &quot; the other day , raving about its grit in pursuing those allegations that Jackson sexually molested a 14-year-old boy . While notably unimpressed by The Times coverage of Jackson , the writer was genuinely moved by the way &quot; Hard Copy &quot; operatives had strode , camera rolling , right up_to the front_door of a woman who supposedly had vital information about Jackson that she didn ' t want to divulge . What happened ? &quot; She slammed the door right in their faces. &quot; This was news ? &quot; At least they tried , &quot; the writer said . Of course , that ' s it , they tried . Thus the failed effort to get a story becomes a story , implying that there is something suspicious about a person who wishes not to speak_to the media . The &quot; tabloids are getting more like us &quot; line was echoed by a CBS News producer I spoke_to recently . Actually , they ' ve hardly budged . It ' s the Respectable Press that ' s done the joining , the forest coming_to Dunsinane . That Great White among sharks , Steve Dunleavy of &quot; A Current Affair , &quot; gloats on Tuesday ' s &quot; Frontline &quot; : &quot; They don ' t laugh and sneer at our style now. &quot; Adds &quot; A Current Affair &quot; anchor Maureen O ' Boyle : &quot; We ' re now competing with the same people who at one time were going , ' Naughty , naughty. ' &quot; Along with that trend , connoisseurs of &quot; naughty &quot; have surely noted the upswing of TV commercials for tabloid newspapers and appreciated the symbolism of National Enquirer now running spots during Channel 4 newscasts -- another instance of an advertiser buying time on compatible programming . Meanwhile , lest anyone think that handing his accuser a load of cash would spare Michael Jackson further embarrassing media exposure , &quot; A Current Affair &quot; delivered a wake-up call Thursday night by having performers re-enact the depositions of the 14-year-old ( &quot; He then started kissing me &quot; ) and others in &quot; the notorious sex scandal &quot; that we ' ve all grown to love and cherish . Not that &quot; A Current Affair &quot; was being insensitive , having altered some of the graphic language to &quot; make_it suitable for television viewing. &quot; In the cynical age of Tabloidgate , what isn ' t suitable for viewing ?</TEXT>
