   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; PALESTINIANS PLOD LONG ROAD TO STABILITY ; MIDDLE_EAST : NONPROFIT GROUP BUILDERS FOR PEACE HAS ANNOUNCED NINE BUSINESS VENTURES IN GAZA AND THE WEST_BANK . BUT SKEPTICS SAY POOR INFRASTRUCTURE MAY THWART ITS EFFORTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like the signers of the historic peace agreement that spawned its creation , the nonprofit group working to bring economic development to the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West_Bank has seen the euphoria of a year ago dissipate under the harsh realities of the politics of the Middle_East . But Builders for Peace plods along in its efforts to broker business_deals in the economically depressed territories and in Jordan . The organization was created last year by Vice_President Al Gore after Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat signed the accord giving limited autonomy to Palestinians in the territories . The mission of Builders for Peace was to buttress the peace process with economic ventures that would help improve the miserable living conditions in the territories . Co-chaired by former U.S. Rep . Mel Levine and James Zogby of the Arab American Institute , the group of Arab American and Jewish business people was partly successful in meeting its goals . It has announced nine projects , including a hotel , a housing_development , and manufacturing_plants to produce olive_oil , bottled water , furniture and other goods . In all , the ventures represent about $ 100 million in investment and should produce about 5 # 000 jobs in a region with an unemployment_rate of 50 % to 60 % , said Levine , a Democrat who represented the Santa Monica area for 10 years . &quot; This is the tip of the iceberg , &quot; he said in explaining plans for a tuna cannery , a plastics manufacturer and a Pepsi bottling plant , among other projects in early development . &quot; Frankly , I believe that the interest and success of ( potential investors ) will depend_on the success of these nine projects. &quot; But the group has also encountered skepticism about its prospects for success , partly because Gaza and the West_Bank have poor infrastructure , including financial and legal_systems , to support such businesses . It was hoped that the World_Bank and other international lending agencies would fund the water treatment plants , roads and other such infrastructure projects needed in the territories , but the process has been delayed by dissatisfaction with Arafat ' s administrative procedures . Levine acknowledged that the large projects to be funded by donor nations are &quot; going more slowly than anyone wanted. &quot; But he added : &quot; Our mission never was infrastructure . It was always the individual business projects . Clearly , infrastructure is needed , but that ' s beyond our scope. &quot; Some critics have also complained that some of the projects brokered by Builders for Peace , such_as a flashy hotel , are not appropriate for the area . Said Levine : &quot; We are in no place to decide which companies need to go there . They bring jobs and improvements to the economy . Whether large or small , they contribute to the same goal. &quot; Shadowing Builders for Peace ' s efforts are the terrorist attacks on Israel by Palestinian militants and Israel ' s retaliatory actions in the territories . Indeed , Palestinian militants were holding an Israeli soldier ( later killed in a rescue attempt ) hostage last month when Builders for Peace brought_together American investors and Palestinian businessmen at a Beverly Hills dinner . That environment may worry potential investors , but none of the applicants for loans and other financial_support from the Overseas Private Investment Corp . for projects in the territories has withdrawn because of the continuing violence , said OPIC representative Walter Jones . Despite recent troubles , Israelis and Palestinians are moving toward coexistence , said Khaled Quotob , a manager of the Palestinian Agricultural Marketing Assn. , who attended the Beverly Hills dinner . &quot; I ' m looking_for aggressive American companies who are willing to come_over and do business. &quot; Sabri Farra , an Arab American who heads a construction and trade company in Gaza , said the company ' s projects have not been hampered by the violence . &quot; We ' re not threatened in any way at all , &quot; Farra said . &quot; We ' re not just going there to make money and quit . We ' re there for the long term. &quot; However , he said the firm is concerned about the slow pace of infrastructure improvements . &quot; We ' re very much interested in seeing things developed . The U.S._government needs to speed its assistance to the area , &quot; he said . * International Business : For additional Times analysis and coverage of commerce and opportunities overseas , sign_on to the new TimesLink on-line service and &quot; jump &quot; to keyword &quot; business. &quot;</TEXT>
