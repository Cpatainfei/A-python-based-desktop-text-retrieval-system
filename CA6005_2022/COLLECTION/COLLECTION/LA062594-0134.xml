   <HEADLINE> STRIKE ZONE A HOT TOPIC ; BASEBALL : EITHER TOO BIG , TOO SMALL , TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW , IT ' S ALWAYS A SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The world is_full of gray areas . That fuzzy line between right and wrong . That gap on the speedometer between 55 m.p.h. and the speed that gets you pulled over on the highway . Cleveland before they built Jacobs Field . The baseball world is_full of them , too , and none has created more conversation and controversy than that theoretical polygon box known as the strike zone . It is too big . It is too small . It is getting too narrow . It is far too wide . It is always changing . It hasn ' t changed in years . It depends entirely on who ' s doing the talking . One thing is certain . The amount of talk_about the strike zone has increased dramatically this year , as the fans and the media search for the most logical explanation for the startling upturn in offensive production . Is the strike zone getting smaller , or are the hitters just getting bigger ? Inquiring minds want to know . &quot; I think everybody ' s just looking_for the answer to all_the home_runs , &quot; said the Detroit Tigers ' Mickey Tettleton , &quot; but I ' ve seen balls called strikes that shouldn ' t be and some called balls that should have been strikes. &quot; The umpires say they are making no concerted effort to change the dimensions of the strike zone . The notion that there is some grand conspiracy to increase offensive production to benefit the new television contract was shot down during the &quot; juiced ball &quot; debate and has not resurfaced . The umpires say they are going_about their jobs the same way they have for years , and have not been instructed to do otherwise . &quot; There has been no conscious effort to change the strike zone in the last three or four years , &quot; said veteran American League umpire Jim Evans . &quot; Three years ago , we experimented with calling the high strike in spring_training , but nobody wanted it . That pitch is considered a mistake . What the pitchers want is a wider plate. &quot; The hitters say the pitchers are getting that , so there certainly is no consensus on the supposedly shrinking strike zone . Umpires do appear to call a lot of strikes that are off the outside corner , though Evans says that is a perception that is exaggerated by the angle of the center-field camera and complicated by the popular notion that the entire ball has to be inside the imaginary plane that projects upward from the outer edge of the plate . &quot; The ball doesn ' t have to be entirely on the plate , and the camera is 40 to 50 feet off center , &quot; Evans said . &quot; If it was perfectly centered , you ' d be blocked_out . You would n ' t be able to see the catcher because it would be right behind the pitcher. &quot; The umpires also say that the center-field camera gives a distorted view of the height of some pitches , which adds_to the impression that they do not call anything above the belt a strike . &quot; You watch on TV , and everything looks waist high and below , &quot; Evans said . &quot; that ' s camera angle. &quot; If the strike zone has evolved in the past few years , it may be a matter of shape rather than size . Some umpires -- perhaps in response to pressure to speed_up play -- do appear to be trading the higher strike for a slightly wider plate . Instead of a vertical rectangle , the zone seems to have become more of a square . &quot; It ' s definitely getting smaller , &quot; said California Angels left-hander Chuck Finley . &quot; They talk_about the juiced ball . It ( the ball ) might be a little harder , but the inside part of the plate has been taken_away . That makes you approach the game a little differently. &quot; Difference_of_opinion &quot; It ' s getting larger , &quot; said Angels hitting coach Rod Carew . &quot; You look_at some of those overhead camera shots and see balls six inches outside getting called_for strikes. &quot; There is the debate in a nutshell . Competing interests tend to view an issue from different angles , just as the television broadcasters are employing a slightly skewed view from that center-field camera . &quot; I can ' t say it ' s bigger and I can ' t say it ' s smaller , &quot; said Angels designated hitter Chili Davis , a surprising voice of reason in this polarized debate . &quot; I think it ' s just inconsistent . I don ' t think an argument about the size of the strike zone is going_to stand_up if you ' ve got hitters and pitchers both complaining about it. &quot; Though no one will admit to a concerted effort to change the strike zone in the past few years , no one denies that it has evolved throughout the history of baseball . There was a time early in the 20th century when anything under the chin was considered a strike , but the top end of the strike zone now is about four or five inches above the belt . The last time it clearly changed was when American League umpires abandoned &quot; balloon &quot; chest_protectors in 1985 . Before the chest_protector was standardized , the American League generally was considered a high-ball league and the National League was considered a low-ball league . The big , outside chest_protectors forced American League umpires to stand right over the catcher and look straight down on the plate , which created a more vertical zone . The smaller , inside-the-shirt protectors allowed umpires to crouch down and view the pitch through the &quot; slot &quot; between the catcher and the batter , which seemed to widen the outside half of the plate . &quot; In the American League , the umpire would call anything up_to the top of that chest_protector , &quot; said Tigers manager Sparky Anderson , who managed nine years in the National League before beginning his 15-year tenure with Detroit . &quot; Now , there ' s really no difference. &quot; American League umpires concede that the different stance produced a significantly different strike zone , but that was nearly a decade ago . &quot; When the AL umpires wore the outside protector , the strike zone was higher , &quot; said umpire Joe Brinkman , who has been in the league since 1973 . &quot; But I don ' t think it has changed recently . &quot; I think what is happening is that you ' ve got a lot of ex-pitchers in the broadcast booth who have been away from the game for a while and remember getting that ( high ) pitch . They are just telling it like it was when they were playing. &quot; There was an abortive attempt to enlarge the strike zone three years ago , when then-American League president Bobby Brown sent_out a spring_training directive to the umpires to call higher strikes . The experiment did not get_out of spring_training , however , because neither the pitchers nor the hitters really wanted that pitch called . Sounds strange , but it ' s true . Pitchers did not want the high strike . &quot; They applied that new strike zone , giving pitchers the high strike , which we didn ' t want , &quot; Finley said . &quot; I don ' t want that , because it gets hitters thinking_about hitting up there. &quot; The directive , which was spawned by the clamor to speed_up games , quietly was rescinded before opening day and discussion of the strike zone diminished until the offensive explosion of 1994 rekindled the debate . There is no perfect strike zone . It is an imaginary space that exists in the mind of each umpire and has to be adjusted to fit a wide variety of hitting styles and stances . &quot; People look_at the rulebook and the diagram , &quot; said American League supervisor of umpires Marty Springstead , &quot; but that guy ( in the diagram ) never moves . that ' s the perfect strike zone , but there are so many variables that go_into the thing . &quot; The key thing to remember is , the strike zone only exists when the guy ( hitter ) is offering at the ball at the plate , not when he ' s standing there waiting_on the pitcher . Rickey Henderson comes_up from his crouch at that moment . Dave Winfield comes down. &quot; The umpire has to adjust to each hitter -- and the hitters and pitchers have to adjust to each umpire -- which is nothing new in a game that is based on continual adjustment . Most pitchers say they don ' t care where the strike zone is , as long as each umpire establishes a consistent one . The hitters are a bit more legalistic about the dimensions , but they also know they must learn each umpire and adapt to his strike zone . The bottom_line is this : It is a game played and officiated by human_beings , each with a distinct style and personality . It is not a perfect science , and no amount of tinkering or technology is likely to change that without affecting the very heart and soul of the sport . &quot; If there was a better way to do this over the last 100 years , &quot; Springstead said , &quot; they would have found it. &quot;</TEXT>
