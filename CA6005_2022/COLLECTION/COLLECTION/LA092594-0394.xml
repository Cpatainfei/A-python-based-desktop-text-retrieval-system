   <HEADLINE> PROP . 187 ' S SUPPORT SHOWS NO BOUNDARIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At least part of Veronica Rodriguez ' s attraction to Proposition 187 , the sweeping November initiative that would deny basic services to illegal immigrants , can be traced to the Mexican license_plates at her community_college . A working student in the Imperial County farm town of Holtville , Rodriguez says she was turned_down for educational aid because she earned too_much . Now , the 21-year-old daughter of legal immigrant farm_workers smolders when she sees cars bearing Mexican plates in the parking_lot and lines of people collecting aid checks at the campus . Many immigrants , she suspects , are getting assistance they should not . Fresno resident Vanessa Quintero also is tilting toward a vote for Proposition 187 , grasping for something that will help arrest the crowding and deterioration in the heavily Latino neighborhood where she bought a home five years back . Fueling her frustration , she says , is the stream of Spanish-speakers seeking directions to the welfare office half a block away , some explaining they recently arrived from Mexico and don ' t know the area . &quot; I have a heart . I am human , &quot; said Quintero , a tax examiner who once worked in the Central Valley ' s farm fields . &quot; But each time I walk_out my door , I think : ' Oh boy . Something has got_to be done about this problem. ' &quot; Far from the California heartland , in Los Angeles , a self-described &quot; very liberal &quot; Democrat who helps run a theater troupe that performs for thousands of underprivileged children has reached a similar conclusion . Although she says she ' s convinced illegal immigrants contribute more to the state than they use in_services , she is supporting Proposition 187 on what she calls ethical grounds . &quot; Entering the country illegally by definition is breaking the law , &quot; said the Westside woman , who , like many pro-187 liberals and Latinos , preferred not to be named . &quot; To reward people for that with health ( services ) and public education is just ethically wrong . . . . The law has to mean something. &quot; As Election_Day nears , an unusually broad consensus of support has emerged for Proposition 187 -- one that transcends conventional political wisdom and typical electoral alignments . Large_numbers of liberal , Latino and Democratic voters of all stripes -- those who normally could be expected to forge the core opposition to such a measure -- are embracing one of the harshest immigration reform schemes ever placed on the ballot , polls show . Veering sharply from the path of their ostensible political_leaders , who warn that Proposition 187 panders to prejudice and will be a financial and social calamity , these voters appear ready to fall_in with California ' s latest benchmark political revolt . &quot; This is a situation where there ' s been a disconnect between the political elite and just rank-and-file Americans , &quot; said former UCLA political_science professor Peter Skerry , author of &quot; Mexican Americans : The Ambivalent Minority. &quot; &quot; The dam has broken and people feel they can express these feelings that kind of pent up. &quot; How deep the tide of support will remain by_Election Day is unclear . Voter attention -- and the campaign against the initiative -- is only beginning to fix on the hard details of the measure . And uneasiness could grow as voters weigh the measure ' s practical implications , including denial of public schooling and routine medical_care to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants already living_in the state . Nonetheless , the breadth of current backing for the measure is remarkable , experts say . Most Republican , Democratic and independent voters favor it , a recent Times Poll found . So do whites and Latinos , moderates and conservatives , and people from all age_groups , income and education levels . Even liberal voters are evenly divided . Many voters -- particularly in less predictable liberal and minority pockets of support -- are latching_on to the simple power of the initiative ' s message . Dozens of interviews with voters , poll respondents , Democratic Party activists , neighborhood leaders and political analysts indicate that Proposition 187 is resonating through deeply embedded , often personal and anecdotal , voter concerns . People speak_of a sense of order diminished and of control lost . They see undisciplined , profligate government programs failing to address glaring problems of homelessness and troubled schools , even as they extend more services to illegal newcomers . Threading through it all are discomforting changes many have witnessed in their town , at their school , in their work . &quot; You find ( support for the initiative ) in strange places where you would n ' t necessarily expect to find it , &quot; said Bill Christopher , the head of a large coalition of Los Angeles homeowner and neighborhood watch groups , which recently held a highly charged , sharply divided discussion of the measure . &quot; I think it ' s a lot of people out there just flailing away ( on an ) issue that needs to be addressed . It ' s a manifestation of everybody ' s desire to get a handle on the issue . . . . But no one ' s quite sure the best way to do that. &quot; The appeal of the measure is palpable in places like the Evergreen Senior Center in Boyle Heights east of Downtown Los Angeles . Gathered for bingo on a recent afternoon , many of the older Latino homeowners -- mostly Democrats who vote regularly -- sharply criticized illegal immigrants they say are crowding their communities and taking_advantage of tax-supported programs for the needy . Several viewed Proposition 187 as discriminatory , chiefly targeted at Mexicans , and a political ploy designed to boost the reelection chances of Republican Gov . Pete Wilson , who has endorsed the measure . But others -- on condition that their names not be used -- said they are fed up and planning to vote for the measure . &quot; ( My family ) never asked_for welfare . Not once , &quot; said a 75-year-old Latina who has lived_on the Eastside much of her life . &quot; I see some people demanding things they shouldn ' t demand . I ' m against all those girls coming_over here ( to have children ) so they can get a check , free ( food ) stamps , medical and everything. &quot; An 81-year-old Mexican American retiree , who prides himself on reading the paper daily and keeping_abreast of the Proposition 187 debate , said cutting_off services would be tough . But he said it may be the only solution to what he insists is a drain on public_services by undocumented new arrivals . &quot; I support the idea . You ' ve got_to put a stop to it , &quot; he said . Elsewhere , Dora Hernandez , a Boyle Heights legal secretary and longtime resident , is still uncertain which way to go . Although she is uncomfortable with the &quot; racial bashing &quot; she senses is inherent in the measure , the longtime registered Democrat complained : &quot; I abhor what ( illegal immigrants ) have done to my neighborhood. &quot; Such sentiments -- and a recent Times Poll finding Proposition 187 is favored 52 % to 42 % by Latino registered voters -- are no surprise to Armando Garcia , a Catholic brother who grew_up on the Eastside . Today he runs a nonprofit parent education program for immigrants in the area . He said many pochos -- a critical term for Latinos who have lived here many years and become more Americanized -- complain to him about their new neighbors . &quot; ( They say ) they play their music too loud , they throw trash around . . . they have clothes hanging , they take the shopping_carts out of Ralphs , &quot; Garcia said . &quot; There is a great disdain ( for ) what I call the culture of poverty . It ' s entangling the Anglo community , but more so the pocho community , &quot; he said . This vast accumulation of aggravations over large economic issues and day-to-day community problems extends far beyond the Latino community . Cindy Dones , a computer firm manager and mother of three in the East Bay community of Fremont , is leaning toward supporting the measure , even as she worries about its severest provisions . A liberal Democrat , Dones struggled to explain what is drawing her to a measure she by no means is entirely comfortable with . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s any one thing . It ' s a lot of little things that can add_up to be ( a ) major problem , &quot; she said . She described a longtime kindergarten teacher in her child ' s school , who was reassigned because a bilingual teacher was needed for the growing numbers of Spanish-speaking students . &quot; She had 25 years experience . She was caring , loving . You just look_at a situation like that and say : Wait a minute ! You ' re taking good people out of their jobs for the wrong reasons. &quot; She later acknowledged that many of the Spanish-speaking students could have been legal residents . Nonetheless , she said illegal immigrants are straining the school_system at a time when teachers do not get raises and schools cannot afford modern equipment . &quot; In California , the people in office don ' t do a lot of long-term planning , &quot; she said . &quot; ( Then ) it seems like we ' re kind of faced with an all-or-nothing choice . This may_not be the right thing to begin with . But hopefully if we take a harder line , they ' ll figure_out what ' s right and not right to do , &quot; she said . Pointing to auto insurance rate rollbacks and other voter-approved measures that have been buried in court battles or watered_down , some liberals seem willing to gamble that the toughest elements of Proposition 187 won ' t survive . The measure is squarely at_odds with a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that undocumented children are entitled to public education , although supporters hope to challenge the decision if the measure passes . &quot; I don ' t think kids would be denied school , &quot; said Mayo C . Williams Jr. , an electrical contractor who lives_in Los Angeles ' Windsor Village area . &quot; But I think it would send a lesson back to those thinking_about coming_to this country that it ' s not as easy as it looks. &quot; Williams , a Democrat who said he normally votes for liberal causes and candidates , says he ' s seen illegal immigration help drain money from his small business . Competing contractors who use undocumented labor can pay lower wages and underbid him , he said . &quot; They ' ll come_in and work for less than minimum_wage , &quot; he said . In addition to cultural clashes , competition for jobs , school programs and affordable housing seems to be fueling some of the support for Proposition 187 in urban minority communities , where many illegal immigrants have settled . &quot; I ' m fair-minded . But we ' re so close to one another here we can smell one another ' s breath , &quot; said Lois Medlock , a longtime neighborhood activist in a once predominantly black South-Central Los Angeles community that now is heavily Latino . Medlock ' s Southeast Central Homeowners Assn. , made_up of more_than 100 black property_owners , recently endorsed Proposition 187 . Friction has been building_in her area over everything from expansion of bilingual education in neighborhood schools to immigrants who raise chickens in their yards , she said . &quot; We need to stop somewhere . . . &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m not mad at them . I ' m mad at this government. &quot; Virginia Charon , a liberal-leaning Democrat and neighborhood watch leader in the Los Feliz and Hollywood areas , has raised money each Christmas to provide gifts for thousands of children in her area , many of them immigrants . But she is supporting Proposition 187 because she says the steady influx of illegal immigrants in recent years has exacerbated everything from litter and crime to overcrowding in neighborhood schools . Liberal and moderate Democrats on the Westside , where housing costs are higher and fewer poor immigrants tend to settle , often cite larger principles . &quot; Legal immigration is the lifeblood of the country , &quot; said Jack Hirsh , a 45-year-old computer_programmer and &quot; middle-of-the-road &quot; Democrat . But he says he supports the initiative because &quot; it ' s a simple matter of propriety . I believe_in the law . It ' s hard for me to see any justification for anything having to do with people whose presence inside the country is not lawful. &quot; Diana Plotkin , a grass-roots Westside Democratic Party activist , senses the measure ' s appeal in rank-and-file party circles , despite the opposition of many party leaders . &quot; A lot of liberal Democrats ( are ) looking in terms of supporting it . . . which surprises me , &quot; she said . &quot; There ' s a futile sense here . People are so frustrated that nothing is being done. &quot; Opponents say racial bias is feeding the support for Proposition 187 , and discrimination could be rampant if it passes . Provisions to require public employees to question people about their immigration status and report suspected illegal residents would throw suspicion on many minorities who speak with accents , critics say . The impact of racial prejudice is nearly impossible to gauge in polls , experts say . Predictably , racial considerations are discounted by supporters of Proposition 187 across the political spectrum . &quot; That could be a factor . But I ' m Hispanic and I don ' t think race is really the issue , &quot; said Rodriguez , the Imperial Valley college_student . It ' s about public money and opportunity , she said . &quot; There ' s a lot of people out there that live_in this country -- American people -- that need the help. &quot; Even some critics of the initiative say its appeal is not as simple as race and are concerned about the polarized rhetoric of the early public_debate on the measure . Those supporting the measure tend to be tagged as racist and those opposing it are dismissed as favoring open borders , said Harry Pachon , president of the Tomas Rivera Center , a Latino policy think_tank at Claremont College . &quot; Both sides are not even listening to each other , so the middle ( ground ) has been lost in the debate , &quot; he said . Former UCLA professor Skerry , who argues Proposition 187 is simply bad public policy , also says it was foreseeable . California polls have shown a high level of anxiety the last 10 or 12 years , he said . &quot; If you saw what was going_on , immigration was at such a_level that something had to give , &quot; he said . &quot; Political figures didn ' t want to see it , but it was there. &quot; * ELECTION ROUNDUP : A3</TEXT>
