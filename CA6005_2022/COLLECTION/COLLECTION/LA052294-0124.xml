   <HEADLINE> BATTLE OF DIEN BIEN PHU SHAPED SOUTHEAST_ASIA ; VIETNAM : PEASANT ARMY OF NATIONALISTS AND COMMUNISTS DEFEATED THE FRENCH 40 YEARS AGO , ENDING COLONIAL RULE AND SETTING STAGE FOR U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN MOST DIVISIVE WAR OF ITS HISTORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forty years ago , men fought , bled and died here in an epic battle that changed the course of recent world history . Over the years the trenches and bomb craters have given_way to the gentleness of the land , save for some battle sites with small decaying stone memorials that hint at the events that took_place . Here was where the_French stronghold of Dien Bien Phu fell to a peasant Vietnamese army of nationalists and communists , ending French colonial rule , setting the stage for the involvement of the United States in Vietnam , and ending Western -- and white -- domination of much of Southeast_Asia . New generations of farmers now roam the peaceful valley with water_buffalo , tending to their crops . Life is simple and uncomplicated . Children play in ponds . Old_men and women ride their bicycles . White clouds frame the ring of mountains from which Vietnamese troops laid siege to the_French forces for 56 days . &quot; I can no longer communicate with you , &quot; crackled the last chilling message from the_French fortress to headquarters in Hanoi , nearly 200 miles away . Dien Bien Phu fell on May 7 , 1954 . The victorious Vietnamese raised a banner over the bunker command_post of French Gen . Christian de Castries proclaiming , &quot; Determination to Fight , Determination to Win. &quot; With that , France waned as a colonial power . A new player would emerge as a bulwark against the spread of commmunism in Southeast_Asia . Dien Bien Phu propelled America into a full-scale war a decade later , boasting that its military and economic might would crush the poorly armed communists and maintain a balance_of_power in the Free_World . It didn ' t , and history wrote its own script . French President Francois Mitterrand acknowledged as much after a visit to Dien Bien Phu a little over a year ago . &quot; French colonialism had to understand the necessity of turning the page . . . , &quot; he said . Over the years , with their own hands , the peasants and soldiers themselves filled the bomb craters and trenches and flattened the battlefield of Dien Bien Phu on which thousands of Vietnamese and French died . They and the generations that followed gave_birth to a new valley of lush green pastures of rice and maize and fruit gardens sustaining a population that has grown more_than tenfold , to 125 # 000 people . Many of the veterans of the battle are still alive , as the ballad of Dien Bien Phu , written by Huy Can , proclaims : The soldiers of Dien Bien Phu , my comrades , Wish you forever be in this life . So that thousands of centuries , Will listen to your words . The veterans are paraded out for special occasions such_as the 40th anniversary . At the front is their leader , Gen . Vo Nguyen Giap , now 82 , the legendary warrior who defeated the_French and later held_off more_than a half-million American troops . He wields little power today in a newly emerging Vietnam that years ago made its peace with France and is now edging closer to America . Dien Bien Phu represents the glory of the old soldiers , an occasion to put_on their tattered , mismatched uniforms with medals as they retrace the battlefield and pose for photos for reporters and tourists . Giap himself and senior officers who fought alongside him took a patrol into the past on a pre-anniversary visit to Dien Bien Phu in early April . Giap stood_in front of the command_post of de Castries , transfixing villagers with riveting accounts of how he defeated the_French general . While Giap had been to Dien Bien Phu several times in past years , he returned to his old headquarters in Muong Phang , 10 miles away , for the first time since his victory . He received a hero ' s welcome . About 4 # 000 of Giap ' s troops lie_in four tree-shaded cemeteries in Dien Bien Phu . There is none for the_French . Their dead are symbolized by two rebuilt grave sites , where returning French veterans pay their respects . Hundreds of Vietnamese and French troops were buried in the earth of Dien Bien Phu at the positions where they fell , or were swallowed_up by monsoon waters . Many of the Vietnamese veterans of Dien Bien Phu also fought against the Americans . One of the four cemeteries comforts the fallen Vietnamese of that war . Those Vietnamese soldiers lionized in the ballad of Dien Bien Phu who survived have grown old now . Many are retired and tending their gardens . But they can still feel the weight of the heavy artillery they pulled by hand and the 50 pounds of rice each carried for miles through the mountain_passes , often under_attack by French bombers . They can still see the_French bodies in the trenches and feel their hatred that inspired them to victory . They can still feel the sting of the hot shrapnel making contact with their own bodies and the excruciating pain of bullets being removed with no anesthesia . &quot; So many people were killed , both Vietnamese and French , &quot; said veteran Nong Van Khau , now 63 . &quot; They all laid_down in the trenches and died. &quot; The French lost 2 # 200 troops out of more_than 16 # 000 in the garrison . Waving white_flags , up_to 10 # 000 others surrendered , many of them seriously wounded . Many of them succumbed on a 500-mile death march to POW_camps . Western historians estimate that between 8 # 000 and 10 # 000 Vietnamese were killed , up_to one-fourth of their forces at Dien Bien Phu . Khau was among the thousands of wounded who survived to fight in the war against the Americans . He wears a chest full of medals . He still carries scars on his right knee and a piece of a bullet in his lung . Surgeons ripped his back open with a pair_of_scissors to pull_out the shrapnel with no anesthesia . Pain killer was for the more severe cases . The surgeons gave him the part of the bullet they removed as a souvenir . &quot; I was very angry , &quot; Khau said . &quot; I threw the bullet away because I considered it as my enemy. &quot; There are other expressions of anger and hatred . A statue depicts a mother clutching her dead baby and old_women and children running in panic through balls_of_fire . Soldiers said it is both a memorial to 403 men , women and children killed in an air strike and an expression of the villagers ' hatred of the_French . Cao Xuan Du , 65 , dug trenches with hand_tools , so determined was he to defeat the_French . &quot; We had been dominated by the_French for over 80 years and that caused our hatred , &quot; he said . &quot; We were just determined to win. &quot; The Vietnamese surrounded Dien Bien Phu with a network of trenches stretching hundreds of miles from the high mountains to the plains , cutting French supply_lines and gradually tightening the noose around their camp . From their fortified trenches , barefoot Vietnamese shock troops assaulted French strongholds day and night , even under French bombardment . They secured their artillery in emplacements in the surrounding mountains and built roads for trucks to carry shells to each gun position . As thousands of soldiers and civilians hauled rice and ammunition through the jungle and high mountain_passes , the Vietnamese battle_cry became , &quot; Everything for the Frontline , Everything for Victory. &quot; &quot; The greatest surprise we had in_store for the enemy was our refusal to engage in all-out lightning clashes with the elite entire strength of the ( French ) Expeditionary Corps , firmly dug_in their solidly built forts , &quot; Giap wrote in one account of the battle , &quot; Dien Bien Phu : The Most Difficult Decision. &quot; &quot; We decided to destroy pockets of resistance one by one , &quot; Giap wrote , &quot; and gradually , in our own way , at a time and place of_our_own choosing , launch attacks with overwhelming superiority in each battle and at_the_same_time consolidate our bunker system and cut the enemy ' s supply_line until the base camp was strangled. &quot; President Dwight D . Eisenhower was ready to order U.S. air strikes against Vietnamese positions at Dien Bien Phu in support of the_French because he believed Indochina was vital to American interests . But he was unable to get approval from U.S. allies . The defeat of the_French brought_to a close the first Indochina War . The Geneva Agreement of 1954 that followed divided Vietnam along the 17th Parallel into North and South . The communist victors at Dien Bien Phu held the North with Hanoi as the capital . A U.S.-backed non-communist regime controlled the South with the seat of power in Saigon . Both the United States and France sought political influence in the new government in Saigon in the year after the Geneva Agreement . But the United States emerged as the new Western power when Ngo Dinh Diem , an anti-communist leader , ousted French-backed Emperor Bao Dai . Diem became president of the newly formed Republic of Vietnam in the South . France had withdrawn all_of its troops from South Vietnam by 1956 . The United States remained the only foreign power supporting Diem . But in 1956 , both the United States and South Vietnam refused to honor a key provision in the Geneva Agreement that called_for national elections to be held that year to reunify the country . They feared the communists would win and gain control of South Vietnam , upsetting the balance_of_power with China and Russia . That refusal marked the beginning of the second Indochina War . Giap would repeat his Dien Bien Phu strategy against the United States , locking it into its most divisive war that took a toll of nearly 60 # 000 Americans and as_many as 2 million Vietnamese . The first American military advisers arrived in Saigon in July , 1950 . The first U.S. combat forces arrived in South Vietnam in March 1965 . Over the next three years , American forces grew to more_than half a_million . For many , Dien Bien Phu stirs memories of an old American battlefield , Khe Sanh , near the Laotian border just below the old Demilitarized Zone that divided the warring Vietnams . For 77 days in 1968 , Giap ' s North Vietnamese forces laid siege to the American fortress , hammering it daily with cannon_fire from mountain positions surrounding it . But Khe Sanh held with the support of massive U.S. air strikes that unleashed nearly 100 # 000 tons of explosives against North Vietnamese positions , one-sixth of the total tonnage dropped_by U.S. planes during the entire three years of the Korean_War . A relief column of 12 # 000 American and South Vietnamese soldiers reached the battered base on April 5 . The North Vietnamese had withdrawn into the jungles . What had been billed as the showdown battle of the war never came_off , but the cost of holding the base had been high , with more_than 200 U.S. Marines killed and 1 # 600 wounded . The late historian Bernard B . Fall said in his book about the first Indochina War , &quot; The Siege of Dien Bien Phu , &quot; that a major American air effort there in support of the_French would have achieved desirable military and political results . Fall wrote that the communist Vietnamese army was getting stronger by the day and it became imperative for the_French to destroy at least a large part of the main battle force as quickly as possible . &quot; This was feasible only if the_French could induce the enemy to face_up to them in a set-piece battle , by offering the Viet Minh a target sufficiently tempting to pounce at , but sufficiently strong to resist the onslaught once it came , &quot; Fall wrote . &quot; It was an incredible gamble , for upon its success hinged not only the fate of the_French forces in Indochina and France ' s political role in Southeast_Asia , but the survival of Vietnam as a non-communist state . . . . &quot; Like Dien Bien Phu , Khe Sanh became synonymous with failed French and American military strategy . It was a consideration that eventually led the United States to withdraw its military_forces in 1973 under terms of the Paris Peace Agreement . The war between North and South ended on April 30 , 1975 , with a communist victory . In the cemeteries of Dien Bien Phu , wives and daughters and sons come_to_light joss_sticks and pray for the fallen . Tran Thi Yen came here for the first time on this 40th anniversary to search for the grave of her father . She was only 2 years old when he was killed . The earth of Dien Bien Phu also embraces the remains of American airmen , missing in the second Indochina War during missions over the valley . They lie far from family and home , missed and mourned by their loved ones .</TEXT>
