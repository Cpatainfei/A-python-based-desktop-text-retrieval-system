   <HEADLINE> PAULINE AS SCHOOLMARM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Critiquing Pauline Kael ' s reviews culled from her New Yorker pieces is no easy task . David Ehrenstein is to be congratulated for his evenhanded dealing with the collection assembled in Kael ' s &quot; For Keeps &quot; ( Book_Review , Oct . 9 ) . I would add a codicil to his statement : &quot; If she isn ' t rounding_up a posse to fight_off Oliver Stone and his band of pseudo-intellectual rustlers , then she ' s forming a citizens committee to run Robert Altman for sheriff . In fact , just about every Western archetype fits Pauline Kael -- except schoolmarm. &quot; Very funny , but not quite true . There was something of a schoolmarm to her . Schoolmarm in the best sense of the word . Sometime in the early 1970s , Saturday Review film critic Arthur Knight taught a film course at USC . He frequently had guest lecturers , and I recall one evening when Pauline Kael and I addressed the class . She was wonderful , intelligent , witty , passionate . At the end of the lecture , Arthur opened it up_to a Q &amp; A session . As was always the case in these sessions , the inevitable query was : &quot; How do you get_into the motion_picture business ? &quot; I can still recall Pauline gazing out at a sea of would-be filmmakers , pausing , then stating something of this nature : &quot; I don ' t know what to tell you . The problem with most of you is that you don ' t read anymore. &quot; A long pause , and then her voice rising : &quot; No one of your generation knows anything about literature . If you are going_to be a filmmaker , you must also be a reader -- someone aware of literature. &quot; Pauline , the schoolmarm , was correct . One need only to view today ' s films for the truth of her statement . ROBERT B . RADNITZ , CULVER CITY * David Ehrenstein in his review of Pauline Kael ' s magnificent anthology failed to convey what an astonishing critic she was . Not only was she an excellent writer , but one of the great stylists this country has ever produced . Her use of the vernacular and her uncanny sociopolitical insight showed that criticism could be as much an art_form as jazz . Her work can stand alongside that of Edmund Wilson and George Bernard Shaw . Ehrenstein is also wrong about her influence . By breaking_through the old-boy , dispassionate style of reviewing , Kael altered the way criticism was practiced . Not only can you see her presence in numerous movie critics , but in the work of book , theater , music , dance , art and food reviewers . She was able to convey the way educated people talked_about movies . And she wasn ' t afraid to deal with the medium ' s sensuality or her own feelings . Ehrenstein says Kael never helped one movie earn a cent . Again , I believe him wrong . I would offer as just one example &quot; Last Tango in Paris. &quot; I feel her review had a lot to do with the film ' s success . And , if Kael was so insignificant , why did movie ads frequently feature full reprints of her reviews ? With so_much incredible material to deal with , it ' s unfortunate Ehrenstein decides to beat a dead horse about &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; and to nit-pick about &quot; Shoah &quot; ( the important point is that Kael fought for weeks to have the original critique published despite intense conservative and liberal pressure to scuttle it ) . Kael said a great critic could -- by understanding and feeling for the work , by passion -- excite people so they want to experience more of the art there is . She fulfilled this role superbly . DAN O ' NEILL , LOS ANGELES * In his paraphrase of Pauline Kael ' s statement -- to the effect that Herman Mankiewicz ' s secretary said Welles &quot; wasn ' t around &quot; when the first draft of &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; was written -- David Ehrenstein somewhat understates the case . History records -- and Rita Alexander , the secretary in_question , confirms -- that the script was written at the Campbells ' Guest Ranch in Victorville , in San Bernardino County , during a time when Orson ( except for one or two trips accompanied by John Houseman ) was in Los Angeles County . I do not know what Welles ' secretary subsequently typed . I do know that no &quot; Kane &quot; script or section of script not written by Herman Mankiewicz exists nor is there any testimony that one ever existed . Confusion exists only because of the emergence , years later in the Cahiers du Cinema , of the auteur theory . I have no objection to Welles being annoited auteur of &quot; Citizen Kane. &quot; After all , as Franco Zeffirelli tells us in his immortal &quot; Romeo e Giulietta , &quot; &quot; that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. &quot; DON MANKIEWICZ , LA CRESCENTA . Editor ' s note : Don Mankiewicz is the son of Herman Mankiewicz . * David Ehrenstein ' s review of Pauline Kael ' s &quot; For Keeps &quot; is so reductive and thoughtless as_to be simply false . Specifically , it is false that Kael has &quot; never added . . . a penny to a project ' s coffers &quot; ; many people see movies because of reviews . It is false that Kael ' s essay &quot; Raising Kane &quot; is an attack on Orson Welles ; it celebrates his brilliance as a director but recalls the fact , often denied by Welles and his admirers , that the &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; script was mostly the work of Herman Mankiewicz . It is false to write that Kael has &quot; expung ( ed ) her ' Shoah ' review from the permanent record , &quot; as if this selection were meant to replace all her previous texts . The larger error , however , is the description of Kael as uneasy with ambition and content with self-deprecating movie trash . In Kael ' s view , movies are so powerful and work_on so many different levels that even a hackneyed one can genuinely move us . Yet she never loses sight of the heights filmmakers can reach when they explore that power rather than exploiting it . Her reviews are thrilling because they grasp the tension we all feel between our guilty urge to retreat to any movie_house and our deeper desire to put some meaning into those two hours . Kael ' s understanding that mindless and great movies work with the same tools is too subtle for Ehrenstein , but it will make &quot; For Keeps &quot; a joy . BILLY WISSE , LOS ANGELES</TEXT>
