   <HEADLINE> THELMA AND LOUISE , 30 YEARS LATER ; LIFE_ESTATES , BY SHELBY HEARON ( ALFRED A . KNOPF : $ 22 ; 231 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shelby Hearon ' s 13 novels mark her as a feel-good writer . Any representative_sampling of her work would include the sunny &quot; Hug Dancing &quot; ( 1991 ) , the hilarious &quot; Owning Jolene &quot; ( 1989 ) and the sharp-edged &quot; Small_Town &quot; ( 1985 ) . All strike a delicate balance between poignancy and high comedy . &quot; Life_Estates &quot; is no exception ; it glows with Hearon ' s characteristic wit and compassion even while it explores an uncharacteristically somber topic : mortality . Throughout her entire body_of_work runs one consistent clarion call : However beset we are , however vulnerable , it behooves us to thumb our nose at fate , take_control , change what ' s changeable and make the absolute best of what cannot be changed . It is a message echoed , loud and clear , by 55-year-old Sarah Cooper , the feisty feminist narrator of Hearon ' s latest novel . It is echoed again , faintly , almost too late , but with great gallantry , by Sarah ' s eternally young-at-heart friend , Harriet Sloane . Sarah and Harriet have been buddies ever since they boarded together at Miss Pritchard ' s , &quot; one of the country ' s best marriage preparatory schools. &quot; Although Sarah lives in the Blue Ridge Mountains of South Carolina and Harriet in east Texas , the amazing symmetry of their lives has kept them close . &quot; I mean , &quot; marvels Harriet , &quot; ( We ' ve ) been in each other ' s weddings , married bankers , had our boys and then our girls the same years , got separate bedrooms at_the_same_time . . . . &quot; They have , in fact , walked each other ' s lifelines for 40 years , phoning one another often , exchanging twice-yearly visits . And now , just months after Sarah ' s husband has died of cancer , Harriet ' s husband perishes in a car crash . &quot; Life_Estates &quot; gets underway as the two women confront widowhood -- separately and together . Looking_back on her life , the newly widowed Sarah wryly acknowledges the irony of her marriage . Just out of school , she plunged into matrimony with handsome hunk Nolan because she thought him sexually exciting . It took her some years to realize that he was insensitive to all her needs , sexual and otherwise . Making a tolerable accommodation to marriage , Sarah staked claims to freedom and fulfillment elsewhere . She took long drives through the lovely countryside to commune with nature . She gardened with passion . Eventually she co-founded a custom wallpaper business , servicing the area ' s old historical homes and catering to the women who treasure them . As the business flourished , Sarah even persuaded her jealously paternalistic husband to agree to separate tax_returns and separate checking_accounts . Freedom indeed . After his death , Sarah breaks the last bond with control freak Nolan by rejecting the &quot; life interest &quot; he bequeathed her against her explicit wishes . Like her approving mother , an elderly entomologist off to study rare spiders in the Patagonian rain_forest , Sarah knows how to seize the day . Once she is released from the bondage of a lousy marriage , Sarah relishes the new freedoms widowhood offers . She particularly savors new-found intimacy with a 70-year-old doctor who has admired her for years . Unlike Nolan , he provides her with understanding , companionship and good sex . By contrast , Sarah ' s friend , the petite and gorgeous Harriet , is devastated by her husband ' s death . Outgoing and popular , Harriet &quot; could have been dropped at the North_Pole and had a dozen chums by nightfall. &quot; For years she has spent every weekday morning with the 11 women friends of her &quot; Birthday Club. &quot; Like Sarah , she got little support from her husband and felt herself more his appendage than partner . Moreover , she discovers soon into widowhood that he had a long-term affair with a &quot; tacky size 10. &quot; Adrift and scared , Harriet buys a gun for protection . She dreams of seducing an attentive younger_man . She frets obsessively about her daughter , who seems determined to deny Harriet the grandchildren she craves . Harriet hasn ' t a clue , Sarah realizes , as_to why her own daughter rejects motherhood while Sarah ' s daughter is a regular &quot; brood hen. &quot; Further differences between the two women , unexamined for years , gradually surface . The friendship subtly changes , and changes drastically , when the two friends suddenly find themselves face to face with their own mortality , too . That it survives , as strong as ever , is a tribute to the resilience of the two women , Harriet as much as Sarah , and to the redemptive power of friendship . Sarah may be a bit over-zealous as a feminist , a bit under-involved as a mother , but she is altogether attractive -- bright , caring , strong . It is , however , the funny / sad Harriet who touches the heart and stays in the head . Around these two ultimately heroic heroines Hearon has woven yet another live affirming novel which , while not profound , is profoundly readable and satisfying .</TEXT>
