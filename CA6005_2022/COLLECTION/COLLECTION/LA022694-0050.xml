   <HEADLINE> APPEARANCE OF BIAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I just wanted to comment on an interesting phenomenon : In the Feb . 14 Times the story on Tommy Moe ' s Olympic gold medal in the men ' s downhill skiing was_on the front page of the news section.In the Feb . 16 paper , the story on Diann Roffe-Steinrotter ' s gold medal in the women ' s super-giant slalom is_on the front page of the Sports section . I would hate to be overly PC by screaming gender bias , but this does make one wonder . Sometimes the appearance of bias can be just as bad as actual bias . JEANNE DOUGLAS Los Angeles</TEXT>
