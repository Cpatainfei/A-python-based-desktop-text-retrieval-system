   <HEADLINE> CLINTON APPROVES 38 # 000 TROOPS TO COUNTER IRAQ ; MIDEAST : HUSSEIN IS CONTINUING TO MASS FORCES NEAR THE KUWAITI BORDER , THE PRESIDENT IS TOLD BY ADVISERS . THE PENTAGON ALSO ORDERS COMBAT AIRCRAFT TO THE AREA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , rushing to head_off a continued Iraqi troop buildup that could presage another invasion of Kuwait , approved plans Sunday designed to send up_to 38 # 000 U.S. ground troops -- and hundreds of aircraft -- to the region by the end of the week . The decisions were disclosed after a meeting at the White_House among Clinton and his top national security advisers at which the President was told that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was continuing to mass more troops near the Kuwaiti border . Defense_Department officials said the additional troops to be sent would include the remainder of the 18 # 000-troop 1st Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Pendleton , Calif. , and the 16 # 000-soldier 24th Mechanized Infantry Division at Ft . Stewart , Ga . Advance elements of both those units , made_up of 300 Marines and 4 # 000 soldiers , left for Kuwait on Sunday . Officials said the Pentagon still has not issued formal orders to deploy the rest but that the President has approved plans to do so early this week . The Pentagon also ordered a spate of additional U.S. combat aircraft to Saudi_Arabia , including 24 A-10 attack planes , 18 F-16 fighters and nine F-15C fighters , along with 14 C-130 transport aircraft from Pope Air_Force Base in North Carolina . And U.S. officials said Clinton is also considering options that include sending another , unspecified Army division made_up of 16 # 000 more soldiers , B-52 bombers and F-117A Stealth fighters , which wreaked havoc on Iraqi forces during the Persian_Gulf_War . The increase to 38 # 000 ground troops by the end of the week would mark the largest_number of troops that the United States has deployed to the Persian_Gulf region since the 1991 war . By comparison , Washington has about 20 # 000 soldiers and Marines in Haiti . A senior defense official said Clinton ' s immediate objective is to deter Iraq from invading Kuwait in a reprise of its 1990 incursion . If that effort fails , he said , the United States will use its forces to defeat the Iraqi forces as quickly and painlessly as possible . Officials said U.S. intelligence reports showed that Iraq was continuing its buildup despite U.S. warnings over the weekend , with two divisions of Iraq ' s elite Republican Guard pushing closer to the Kuwaiti border and other forces clearly on_the_move . Nearly 70 # 000 Iraqi troops are believed to be massing near the border . They said satellite and air-reconnaissance photos had also shown that Iraqi forces were beginning to deploy a third division of the Republican Guard south to join the two others near the border -- a move that would bring the total Iraqi force to more_than 80 # 000 troops . At the White_House , National Security Adviser Anthony Lake told reporters that an estimated 16 # 000 of the Iraqi troops were poised within 1.2 miles of the demilitarized zone separating Iraq from Kuwait . A senior defense official conceded that despite intensive reconnaissance efforts , U.S. analysts still have not determined for_sure if Iraq intends to attack . But he said that with these preparations , &quot; Iraq could be ready in a matter of days . . . if it chooses. &quot; The latest U.S. moves intensified a drama that began last week , when Iraq began moving unusual numbers of troops toward the Kuwaiti border in what some U.S. analysts said was a bid to bully the West into easing post-Gulf War U.N. sanctions that have hurt Iraq ' s economy . Although the U.N. Security_Council had been scheduled to vote on Baghdad ' s appeal_to lift the sanctions today , the United States had opposed the move , and the sanctions were expected to remain in_force indefinitely . Pentagon officials said the United States already has about 4 # 000 troops in Kuwait or offshore on amphibious warships . And , on Clinton ' s order , the aircraft_carrier George_Washington , two Aegis cruisers , a destroyer and two submarines are heading toward the Gulf . As Clinton reviewed Pentagon war plans , the Administration stepped_up a major diplomatic effort to revive the allied coalition that joined with U.S. forces during the 1991 Gulf War , with officials consulting with their counterparts in Britain , France and other countries . Meanwhile , Kuwait , which placed its forces on alert Friday , moved the bulk of its 18 # 000-member army up_to the Iraqi border to help serve as a first line_of_defense if an invasion comes . And Saudi_Arabia pledged cooperation in_using its bases as staging_areas . For its part , Iraq said Sunday that it is seeking a diplomatic solution to the current crisis with the United Nations but asserted that it will insist on guarantees of a quick end to Gulf War sanctions . Foreign Minister Mohammed Said Sahaf said in a statement carried by the Iraqi News_Agency that France , China and Russia were working in that direction , but he warned that Baghdad would accept nothing short of assurances that &quot; the suffering of the Iraqi people &quot; would end . Iraq also moved hundreds of people to the Kuwaiti border , apparently to stage demonstrations , according to U.N. officials . Iraq said they had been displaced after the Gulf War , but Kuwaiti officials said they were soldiers in civilian clothes . The decision to increase the U.S. troop strength in the Persian_Gulf area was accompanied by a round of stern warnings from top Administration officials , who took_to the airwaves Sunday to caution Iraq that the United States means business . &quot; The main message . . . to Saddam Hussein is : ' Do not make a mistake . Do not cross that border . Do not create circumstances that will force us to act , ' &quot; Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said on CNN . And Defense_Secretary William J . Perry asserted that Iraqi forces would be roundly defeated if they tried to invade Kuwait . He also warned on the CBS-TV program &quot; Face the Nation &quot; that U.S. forces will attack -- not just &quot; sit there &quot; waiting -- if Iraq keeps its troops near the border indefinitely . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , in Jerusalem to help spur the Arab-Israeli peace process , also raised the possibility that the United States might not pressure Israel to stay out of the war this time -- as it did_in 1991 -- if Iraq invades again . Besides sending additional combat units , the Pentagon also sent two more highflying U-2 spy planes and two RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft to the region to enable U.S. intelligence_officers to track the Iraqi force more closely . Pentagon officials believe that Iraq is not likely to launch any invasion until later this week , after it has put into place the logistics arrangements that it will need to support a serious military_action , and by that time U.S. forces should be in place to stop it . The United States already had about 12 # 000 military_personnel in the Persian_Gulf region before the weekend ' s increases were announced . These included 2 # 000 Marines on amphibious ships off Kuwait ; 1 # 200 soldiers ; 3 # 900 Air_Force personnel ; 4 # 600 sailors on naval vessels in the Red_Sea and Persian_Gulf , and 170 special operations troops . Although intelligence officials concede they have no definite reading on why Hussein has ordered the troop buildup , they say Washington must prepare_for the worst if it is to prevent him from invading Kuwait . &quot; You have to remember that the last time we received a very clear warning that he was developing a capability &quot; and tried to guess his intentions , said Anthony H . Cordesman , a Georgetown University military analyst . &quot; The fact is that regardless of whom you talk to in the intelligence community , guess is the operative word , &quot; he said . &quot; When you have to guess , and when you have a demonstrated record of aggression , then you have no one but yourself to blame if you fail to react. &quot; Pentagon officials said the new U.S. troop deployments will be facilitated by contingency plans that the Pentagon developed after the Gulf War that called_for &quot; pre-positioning &quot; huge amounts of weapons and equipment in the area , some on cargo_ships . The Marines from Camp Pendleton and the soldiers from Ft . Stewart will be flown to the Gulf area with only light combat gear and then &quot; married up &quot; -- in Pentagon jargon -- with tanks , Bradley fighting vehicles and other equipment now en route to the area . The Pentagon has already sent several such &quot; pre-positioned &quot; cargo_ships to the Gulf area , two of them from permanent berths at the Indian_Ocean island of Diego Garcia and the rest continuously on station at_sea . Military commanders also sent two additional batteries of advanced Patriot air-defense missiles -- with about 170 soldiers in total -- to Kuwait on Friday . An earlier version of the Patriot was used to help knock_down Iraqi Scud missiles in 1991 , with mixed results . Times staff writers John M . Broder in Washington and Norman Kempster in Jerusalem also contributed to this report .</TEXT>
