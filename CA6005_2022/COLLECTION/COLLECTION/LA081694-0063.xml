   <HEADLINE> SCHOOL ' S EFFORT TO COVER COSTS DRAINS RESERVES ; EDUCATION : THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT ASKS SIX DISTRICTS FOR BUDGET PROJECTIONS TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY WILL GET_BACK IN BLACK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Squeezed between stagnant state funding and rising costs , three-quarters of Ventura County ' s 20 school districts are spending more_than they expect to take_in this budget year , and six districts -- including the Conejo Valley and Ventura unified districts -- have dangerously low reserves , the county superintendent ' s office says . The county agency has instructed the six districts with low reserves and high deficit_spending to supply budget projections for the next two budget years , explaining how the districts plan to get_back in the black . &quot; We felt that , because of the level of their deficit_spending , we would like to look_at their budget projections for the future , &quot; said Kenneth H . Prosser , director of school business and advisory services for the county office . Prosser recently sent letters to the Conejo Valley Unified , Ventura Unified , Pleasant Valley Elementary , El Rio Elementary and Moorpark Unified school districts , asking_for information on how they plan to stop the flow of red ink . He also sent a letter to Oxnard School District , warning that the district ' s projections &quot; show a_level of deficit_spending resulting in a 1.8 % available reserve . . . . Failure to minimize deficit_spending could jeopardize the future financial standing of the district. &quot; * In an interview , Prosser elaborated on what he sees as a disturbing trend . &quot; By no means are those districts facing insolvency , &quot; he said . &quot; But insolvency could result if they continue to spend at the same level. &quot; School officials across the county said they have labored to reduce expenses and hope to bolster reserves by spending less than budgeted_for the upcoming school_year . &quot; We have been working very diligently to reduce our expenses , &quot; said Carmela Vignocchi , assistant superintendent of finance with Moorpark Unified . &quot; And it ' s getting increasingly difficult to maintain our reserves. &quot; Moorpark schools have left vacant at least 10 administrative positions in the last four years , Vignocchi said . Yet , with this year ' s revenues nearly $ 1 million short of expenses , the Moorpark district ' s reserve has dropped to 2.44 % . The California Department_of_Education recommends that districts with fewer than 30 # 000 students -- which includes all districts in Ventura County -- keep a reserve of at least 3 % of their total expenses . Districts can get_in trouble when they allow reserves to drop below that figure and are unable to rebuild the nest_egg , Prosser said . &quot; School districts in the last few years have tended to spend their reserve because it ' s the only way to maintain programs . Often they have been able to replace those reserves , &quot; Prosser said . &quot; But regardless , we would like to see their future spending projections. &quot; District officials say that , given state budget_cuts in the last three years , they have to make ends meet with very little . &quot; Because state funds have decreased , our deficit has gone_up 11 % to 12 % compared to one-half percent three years ago , &quot; said Sarah Hart , assistant superintendent of business services at Conejo Valley Unified . &quot; We understand that the state has significantly less tax_revenues . We are not blaming them. &quot; * Officials with the state_Department of Education said more_than half of California school districts are spending more_than they are receiving in revenue . What ' s more , officials predict no increase in state funding any time soon . &quot; Most districts are deficit_spending . They depend pretty much on the state for their income , and the state is not coming_up with that money , &quot; said Janet Sterling , manager of the state education_department ' s Office of School Financial Report . &quot; It ' s just the state of the economy. &quot; If state revenues continue to be flat , Prosser said , schools throughout Ventura County will have to develop new ways to finance education . &quot; Schools don ' t have a lot of options , but they are trying to do everything they can to maintain important school programs , &quot; Prosser said . &quot; They may make more cuts , look_for grants or come_up with new ways to raise money. &quot; While state aid to schools has remained steady since 1991 , inflation has contributed to an increase in costs . So districts have tried to come_up with creative ways to reduce expenses while minimizing reductions in school programs . &quot; Reductions in the classroom are the last thing we want to do , &quot; said Hart of Conejo Valley Unified . &quot; We have made several cuts , mainly in administrative positions. &quot; Since 1991 , Conejo Valley Unified budget reductions have included a 3 % salary cut for teachers , managers and supervisors ; an increase in employees ' health benefit deductible from $ 150 to $ 250 , and the elimination of at least 10 management and 30 support staff positions and 20 teaching assistants . In addition , Conejo Valley Unified in the 1993-94 school_year began to charge parents $ 400 a year per student for bus transportation . Likewise , other districts , such_as Oxnard Elementary , Ventura Unified and Moorpark Unified , have drastically reduced the number of management and support staff . The Oxnard School District projects a $ 2.3-million deficit in this year ' s budget , the highest in the county . Although the 13 # 000-student district ' s reserve is near the 3 % recommended by the state , district officials predict that it will drop to less than 2 % in the 1995-96 budget year , which worries county officials . * Oxnard School District officials said they hope to be able to save_up to $ 600 # 000 during this school_year by keeping a tight rein on spending . &quot; We are closely monitoring our expenses and we feel that our budget is manageable , &quot; said Supt . Bernard Korenstein . &quot; If we get_to the point in which we feel we are in jeopardy , we will have to make more drastic reductions , &quot; Korenstein said . &quot; We just don ' t know where. &quot; Officials with Ventura Unified , one of the largest districts in the county with 15 # 000 students , said they are surviving because of money saved after severe cuts imposed in the last three years . &quot; We have to use our savings to balance our current budget , &quot; said Georgeann Brown , director of budget and finance for Ventura Unified . &quot; We are surviving at the same level of money we received in 1991-92 . We hope by 1996-97 we will be able to get additional funds from the state. &quot;</TEXT>
