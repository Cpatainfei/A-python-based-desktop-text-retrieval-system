   <HEADLINE> DISCIPLINE WEIGHED IN IRAQ COPTER DEATHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration faces a controversial decision over whether to discipline the pilots of the Air_Force F-15C jet fighters that shot_down a pair of U.S. Blackhawk helicopters over Iraq two months ago , sources familiar_with the case said Thursday . A formal report on the tragedy , on its way to top Pentagon officials this week after an inquiry by a military investigating team , is expected to confirm initial indications that the lead fighter_pilot , relying_on a visual sighting , mistook the helicopters for Iraqi Hinds . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , who probably will make the final_decision on the issue , is coming under pressure -- both from some U.S. military_officers and from the Turkish government -- to court-martial the pilot on charges of negligence . The April 14 tragedy claimed the lives of all 26 crew_members and passengers on the two helicopters , including 15 Americans and three Turkish officers . The decision is expected to be difficult for an Administration that already has had its problems with the uniformed services . Insiders said the military is split over the issue and that the pilot , whose identity has not been made public , is a Persian_Gulf_War veteran . Those arguing for court-martial proceedings -- said to include a growing number of senior Air_Force_officers -- contended the pilot ' s error was so grievous that it amounted to negligence . The U.S. helicopters were clearly marked and were flying at slow speeds , clearly no threat to the fighters . And the helicopters had filed flight plans with U.S. military authorities in the region . But Gen . Merrill A . McPeak , Air_Force chief_of_staff , is said to strongly oppose any such action on grounds the pilot ' s mistake was understandable under rules of war . The investigation has been kept under wraps , with only a handful of officials informed on its progress . But sources familiar_with the report said it is expected to reaffirm that the helicopters were shot down because the lead F-15C pilot misidentified them when he first saw them and did not take extra precautions to confirm what nationality they were . Any punishment is expected to fall mainly on the lead pilot . The pilot of the second F-15C is expected to receive less of the blame because by practice he follows the senior flier . The investigators ' report is also expected to reassert that transponders carried by the two helicopters -- known as &quot; identification , friend-or-foe &quot; -- had been turned_off in a previous landing stop and had not been reactivated before takeoff , as procedures require . But that point could be moot . Experts familiar_with military flight procedures said that once a fighter_pilot decides to act_on the basis of visual identification of a potential foe , the decision overrides any other element . There is substantial debate over how easily an Air Force-trained fighter_pilot should have been able to tell that the helicopters were Blackhawks rather than Iraqi Hinds . Military experts said the two have a similar appearance when the Blackhawks carry fuel_pods but that differences remain . But sources familiar_with the case have said the Blackhawks both bore standard U.S. markings and that the bottom of the fuel_pod was adorned with a large , full-color replica of the U.S. flag . Although the standard markings , which are relatively small , might have been visible from above , the fighter_pilot would not have been able to see the flag replica without flying under the two helicopters . U.S. officials said the Blackhawks were flying slowly , having just taken_off from a village airport . They also had filed a flight plan with U.S. authorities . The helicopters had been ferrying high-level officials on a tour of Kurdish villages . The downing came as a jolt to the Air_Force , which has been plagued by a rash of similar incidents . Immediately after the accident occurred , Perry tightened procedures for determining when fighter_pilots may shoot at another aircraft inside the &quot; no fly &quot; zone -- essentially prohibiting them from firing solely upon visual identification .</TEXT>
