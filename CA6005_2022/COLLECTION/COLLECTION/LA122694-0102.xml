   <HEADLINE> ECONOMIC INDICATORS POINT TO O.C. GATHERING STRENGTH ; COMMERCE : POSITIVE FORECASTS LOOK BEYOND MISERY OF JOB LOSSES IN MONTHS AHEAD DUE TO COUNTY BANKRUPTCY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite a year-end government financial crisis and news just four days before Christmas of $ 30 million in budget_cuts and hundreds of layoffs , Orange County ' s economy is destined to expand in 1995 , analysts and business_leaders say . The general economic underpinnings are solid , experts say , although the coming months will bring misery to those who lose their jobs in the wake of the county government ' s $ 2.02-billion loss in the bond market and Dec . 6 bankruptcy filing . &quot; It will certainly be felt throughout the county in reduced services , especially in programs for the poor , &quot; said Anil Puri , chairman of the economics_department at Cal State Fullerton . &quot; But it just isn ' t enough to make the overall economy suffer a great deal. &quot; After nearly five years of recession , Orange County rides into 1995 on a wave of rising economic indicators . Taxable sales , housing construction and median family income are all increasing , and the latest employment figures show that local employers added 16 # 000 jobs to their payrolls from August through November . The county ' s economy benefited this year from increased foreign trade , thanks in part to the North_American Free_Trade Agreement ' s relaxing of rules on commerce with Mexico and Canada . Those gains are likely to increase , analysts say . &quot; Business in_general will continue to thrive , &quot; said Larry Friend , president of the Irvine investment banking firm L.H. Friend , Weinress &amp; Frankson Inc. &quot; There is a lot of money out there , and while we will be held_back a while , I don ' t see any long-term problems. &quot; Even after factoring in damage from the county ' s financial crisis , economists at Cal State Fullerton , Chapman University , UCLA and First Interstate Bank stand_by their earlier projections of slow , steady growth . The losses blamed so far on county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron ' s high-risk investment strategy , in fact , is about 10 % of the $ 22-billion loss to falling housing prices in the past five years , said economist James Doti , president of Chapman University . Layoffs and budget_cuts could subtract as much as $ 100 million from taxable spending in Orange County next year and more_than $ 500 million from the gross county product -- the value of all goods and services -- but &quot; it ' s a dampening , not a death blow , &quot; Doti said . For 1995 , Doti is forecasting that employers will add 17 # 000 jobs to their payrolls ; that the gross county product -- the value of all goods and services produced here -- will rise almost 6 % to $ 81.9 billion ; that median household income will increase about 2 % to $ 55 # 500 ; and that work will begin on almost 13 # 500 new homes . In spite of that optimistic outlook , there are some worries . Builder Larry Webb , president of Greystone Homes ' South Coast division in Newport Beach , said his company will not move ahead with any new projects in Orange County until the long-term results of the bankruptcy filing become clearer . One fear is that cities hurt by the investment losses will try to recoup money by raising the fees they charge developers for streets , sewers and other infrastructure improvements , he said . If that happens , the construction_industry will pass the higher fees along to home_buyers . One local developer , Irvine Apartment Communities , has already decided to postpone a planned $ 327-million debt refinancing because of uncertainty about how Wall_Street will view Orange County investments in the coming months . &quot; I would expect that , until this is explained , people are going_to be apprehensive to invest in Orange County , &quot; said Philip S . Inglee , president of Liberty National_Bank in Huntington Beach . But Inglee said his bank still plans to open two branches next year , despite the county ' s fiscal troubles . To gauge the outlook of the local business_community for 1995 , The Times Orange County spoke with leaders in various segments of the economy . Retail Robert B . McKnight Jr. , chairman and chief_executive_officer of Quiksilver Inc. , was jubilant as the holidays approached . This will be a &quot; great Christmas for my wife , &quot; he said , &quot; because I ' m compensated according to how well we do , and we ' re doing good. &quot; McKnight said that the holiday shopping season has been the best in several years for Quiksilver , a Newport Beach maker of casual clothing and beachwear . Profit for the year so far is up 61 % to $ 7.1 million , he said , and sales are up 33.3 % to $ 126.1 million . Even sweeter , he said , is that orders for the spring , which typically account_for a third of annual sales , are up 30 % . &quot; We feel_like it ' s going pretty good , &quot; said McKnight , a California native who has lived_in Orange County for 20 years . Local shoppers this holiday season are spending freely , he said . McKnight said he is somewhat concerned about the county bankruptcy filing . &quot; Once somebody figures_out where the bottom of this thing is , &quot; he predicted , politicians &quot; will try to hit everyone with a special assessment. &quot; As for the long-term effect on the economy , he said , &quot; it ' s like the earthquake . There ' s a trickle-down or ripple effect. &quot; Hotels Wayne Bodington , general_manager of the 390-room Westin South Coast Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa , thinks economic_growth for 1995 is much more_than a wish . &quot; From our perspective , it is solidly underway . This year will represent the second-highest occupancy year ever , &quot; he said . The best was 1981 , but figures for 1994 so far are &quot; very , very close to that mark. &quot; The reason is business travel , said Bodington , who is a director of the Anaheim / Orange County Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau and a 25-year veteran of the hotel industry . Companies spend money for travel , he said , only when they think the economy is_on a roll . A fuller hotel needs a bigger staff to keep_up with guests ' needs , Bodington said , so he has been hiring room attendants recently , as well as restaurant , bar and banquet facility employees . &quot; We are looking_forward to a continuation of the resurgence of the economy &quot; in 1995 , he said . &quot; We think next year will be as_good_as this year has been and even a little bit better. &quot; &quot; Hopefully , the bankruptcy of the county will not affect our business in any way , &quot; Bodington said , although &quot; it ' s just hard to know how people react to this kind of thing. &quot; High_Technology Scott Mercer , chief financial_officer at Western Digital Corp . in Irvine , has been in Orange County for only 18 months , which affords him a different perspective from many of his counterparts . The Laguna Niguel resident said he finds the area to be &quot; pretty friendly to business . The business_community and the county have worked together in leadership roles. &quot; The local economy , he said , seems to be &quot; slowly building . There is a good , solid base in health_care , and ( business ) start-up activity is good. &quot; The county bankruptcy , he said , will have little effect on business in_general and none at all on Western Digital , which makes computer disk_drives and semiconductors for_sale around the world . &quot; Our industry is not dependent upon the health of Orange County . Half of our business comes from outside the United States , &quot; he said , &quot; and the other half from all_over the country. &quot; Like many other large companies with headquarters in Orange County , he said , Western Digital actually does &quot; very little local business . If there is a major impact it will be_on ( our ) employees . . . with the possibility of a tax raise. &quot; Real_Estate Newport Beach consultant Richard Gollis makes his living advising real_estate developers , and right now he ' s telling them &quot; not to make any sweeping decisions. &quot; The effect of the county ' s financial crisis on the ability of major land developers like Irvine Co . to sell bonds to finance the water , sewer and transportation_systems is yet to be seen , Gollis said , until more information is available . In the meantime , he said , he is advising his clients to &quot; look_at every possible deal as an individual deal , and examine it on its own strengths and weaknesses. &quot; He also expressed concern about the effect of the county ' s bankruptcy filing on the ability of private builders and public agencies to market bonds for construction of subsidized low-cost housing and apartments . But he is convinced that business , especially the real_estate industry , has the power to help resolve the situation by taking a leadership role . &quot; If we are concerned about the future of the toll roads , for instance , then the business_community needs to become involved with the banking consortium that is financing the toll road bonds , &quot; Gollis said . &quot; Business needs to bolster investor confidence in the future of the county. &quot; Meanwhile , he sees evidence that local developers have confidence in themselves , and because of that he is cautiously optimistic about 1995 . &quot; All of the long-term trends are still in_play for next year , &quot; Gollis said . &quot; We still have strong job growth in the business services , medical technology and export services_industries . We have a vibrant business economy , and there is a pent-up demand for housing. &quot; International Trade Cecil Chee , who arranges deals with Chinese companies for American-Asian Trade Connection in Irvine , saw a definite increase this year in both the number of clients in China who want to sell their goods in the United States and in companies here that want to move_into the Chinese market . &quot; It was a lot more positive year , and I believe 1995 is going_to be better , &quot; said Chee , who joined American-Asian as a trader a year ago from Citibank Corp . in Singapore . &quot; The whole economy is picking up. &quot; Orange County ' s financial crisis is a shame , he said , but not likely to affect his business . In fact , he said , his company has increased its staff by 66 % since it was founded in 1993 . It has five employees now , up from three . Health and Fitness The year ending has been a good one , and the year ahead stands to be even better , said Cynthia Graff , president of the medical weight control clinic chain Lindora Inc. , which her father founded 23 years ago in Newport Beach . Lindora added three clinics and 20 employees in 1994 , bringing its total to 31 locations and 160 employees . A continued expansion is planned for 1995 , said Graff , though , citing competitive factors , she would not be more specific . Privately owned Lindora increased its revenue by 15 % this year , Graff said , and especially toward year ' s end the clinics ' clients seemed to be much more upbeat about the local economy . &quot; We grew because of aggressive marketing and because a lot of people who weren ' t spending_money on new homes and cars and other big-ticket items decided to focus_on themselves , &quot; Graff said . &quot; For a lot of the year there still was a measurable sense of caution . But there has been a lot more optimism in the last few months. &quot; The financial problems of Orange County governments &quot; certainly can hurt overall confidence in the economy , if enough other municipalities around the country are in the same kind of trouble , &quot; Graff said . &quot; But so far we don ' t expect much impact . It ' s really so complex that most people can ' t yet know exactly what it means. &quot; Temporary Employees Kimco Staffing Solutions , founded in 1986 by Kim Megonigal , is ending its best year of the 1990s , with a 50 % jump in placements . Megonigal said the 10 offices of his Irvine-based company placed about 9 # 000 temporary_workers during the year , boosting annual revenue to $ 23 million from $ 14 million . That surge , he said , reflects the fact that companies typically add temporary_workers at the start of a recovery until their business increases to_the_point that they can make permanent hires . The entrepreneur expressed some concern about the effect of Orange County ' s bankruptcy on his business , especially if taxes rise . &quot; The bottom_line to my business is that , if costs go_up , it ' s going_to hurt us , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' ll have the same effect as early in the recession . The question is : What is the magnitude ? I ' m not going_to add any more overhead until I figure_out which way we ' re going. &quot; Megonigal said he is optimistic about the year ahead and projects that Kimco ' s revenue will grow by another 30 % in 1995 , &quot; but I am much more cautious . And as soon as I see something happen , I ' ll adjust expenditures. &quot; Consulting Services Eric Flamholtz is a widely published management specialist , a professor at UCLA ' s John E . Anderson Graduate_School of Management and president of Management Systems Consulting Corp. , a private firm . Flamholtz , who has a number of clients in Orange County , maintains that the bankruptcy and related layoffs and budget_cuts &quot; could be viewed_as a non-event for most business . It ' s like the 1987 stock_market crash -- a lot of headlines and temporary disruption , but the economy went speeding on for two more years. &quot; Companies he advises , Flamholtz said , &quot; know the importance of strategic planning , and they will factor this in . I don ' t know of anyone scrambling around in a panic. &quot; Because Flamholtz specializes in management training and development , his firm is hired by companies looking_to grow . Thus his business serves as an early indicator of the economy , he said . He loses business before it is apparent that a recession is coming , and he gains clients before it is apparent that a recovery is imminent . &quot; I think 1995 is going_to be very strong , &quot; he said . &quot; In the past year we are seeing the kind of business we saw in the rapid_growth of 1986-1988. &quot; The wild card for the economy , he said , is the Federal_Reserve_Board : &quot; If the Fed keeps increasing interest_rates , that could cool things off. &quot; Tax Advisers Judee Slack still sees the ravages of the recession when she meets with her clients , most of which are small businesses trying to make_up for losses of the past several years . A lifelong resident of Orange County , Slack said the past four years have been the roughest for small business in her experience , but the worst appears to be over . &quot; I think the economy is picking_up , finally , &quot; said Slack , who owns her own tax consulting_company , Slack &amp; Associates in Westminster . &quot; But not with the steam that we keep hearing the economists and politicians talking about. &quot; Very small businesses seem to be rebounding , she said , &quot; but the businesses in the middle , with 10 to 20 employees , they ' re still pretty stagnant. &quot; &quot; I think that people are still leery about spending_money . I have clients with expansion ideas , but they say they ' re afraid to let_loose of the cash they have saved because they are afraid of what will happen if the economy crashes again. &quot; For those companies , Slack said , the county government ' s bankruptcy could magnify uncertainty that lingers after a five-year slump . The greatest concern among her clients , she said , is that local_governments will impose fees on business to replace the lost money . Contributing to this report were Times staff writers James S .
