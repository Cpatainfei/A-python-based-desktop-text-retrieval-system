   <TEXT> * Re &quot; Fed ' s Decision Tied to ' Natural ' 6 % Jobless Rate , &quot; Aug . 29 : I ' m sure every member of the 120-million-plus American work_force is heartened that Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s policy is that the economy must maintain at least 8 million American workers unemployed in_order to be &quot; natural. &quot; During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations , when interest_rates were closer to 3 % and inflation about 1.5 % , it was considered that &quot; natural &quot; unemployment was 3 % . The Republican &quot; natural &quot; rate of 6 % is aimed at controlling the power of labor_unions and giving Republicans greater opportunity to criticize welfare , which is caused by unemployment . &quot; Kill two birds with one stone , &quot; so to speak . BRYAN W . STEVENS Rolling Hills Estates * There is nothing natural about unemployment . Rather , it is the creation of our capitalist social_system . To accept our current rate of unemployment as the best we can do is to essentially write_off the components of that unemployment_rate , including the 10 % unemployment_rate of Los Angeles and the 20 % -plus rate of South-Central Los Angeles . Even if we move beyond the economic stagnation of California to look_at the national picture , economists who see us at the precipice of dramatically high inflation really haven ' t paid much attention to labor_markets recently . The only workers whose pay goes_up regardless of unemployment ( and profits ) seem to be CEOs . Most working Americans ' wages have not kept_up with inflation for the past 20 years ! As our manufacturing job base has diminished , those with high_school educations have seen their pay fall the most . However , in recent years we now realize that even the college educated are finding the job market tough . These difficulties demonstrate that the private sector is increasingly incapable of providing quality jobs . Very few workers are in a position to leverage employers into doing so . As a result , only those wearing hallucinogenic spectacles like Greenspan can see inflation on the horizon . DAVID R . WELLS Los Angeles * Typically , economists focus_on part of the picture and ignore the rest . The 6 % statistical unemployment figure represents an actual unemployment_rate of 10 % or more . These theorists are proposing that over 10 % of our population should support themselves by government programs or criminal activity . Not too long ago , economists were wringing their hands_over the budget_deficits and the national_debt . If they accept 25 million people on welfare , unemployment , or committing crimes , doesn ' t that make the debt and deficit continue their upward spiral ? In the Aug . 29 Times Business section , James Flanigan states that the cost of a single individual who turns_to crime instead of earning wages is &quot; millions &quot; over a lifetime . The total cost to the taxpayer of an individual choosing a life of crime over honest labor is thus far greater than the money he needs for subsistence . It is a strange world when important public officials believe that people having good jobs is more of a threat to our national well-being than poverty and crime . DAVID S . ROBINSON Laguna Hills * Economists who think 6 % unemployment is &quot; natural &quot; should be driven from their realm of virtual_reality into the ranks of the 6 % . CHARLES T . NEWTON Del Mar * It does not surprise me ( although it does sadden me ) that the oligarchs on the Federal_Reserve_Board have given_up the battle to keep Americans employed . After all , they have jobs . It ' s natural that they should be more concerned about inflation than employment . But I doubt that the people of this country will look_away as blithely as the Fed when almost one of 15 citizens has no job . It is unconscionable that an unelected body that must answer to neither the President nor the Congress has so_much control over our economy . It is time the American people took that control back from the Federal_Reserve . THOMAS ROGILLIO Glendale * Re &quot; Fed Hikes Interest_Rates Again ; Blow to Recovery Feared , &quot; Aug . 17 : It ' s a shame when the Federal_Reserve_Board thinks it ' s more important to control prices than it is to let as_many people as possible work . Is it better for everyone to pay a little more for something , or for some people not to be able to afford to buy anything at all ? The choice should be obvious . Once again , it ' s a case of the haves versus the have-nots , the rich getting richer , and the poor getting poorer . It also shows how crime and economic issues are intertwined . Is it a crime when the have-nots strike back , or is it a crime what old Mr. Greed-span is doing ? It ' s a shame . DOUGLAS FRITTS Inglewood</TEXT>
