   <HEADLINE> KANTOR ' S CANDOR ; STRAIGHT TALK FROM TRADE ENVOY IN REPLY TO JAPAN-POLICY CRITICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Blunt talk is not the usual tool of diplomacy . But U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor isn ' t the conventional diplomat . In a speech Wednesday , Kantor took_on the United States ' European allies for knocking President Clinton ' s tough trade stance with Japan.By describing the U.S. recipe for easing the $ 60-billion trade imbalance as a version of &quot; managed trade , &quot; some high-level Europeans -- most recently Peter Sutherland , head of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- have , in_effect , been siding with Tokyo . Kantor would have none of that . &quot; It shouldn ' t escape our attention ( that ) the European Union has been just as frustrated as the United States in opening the Japanese market , &quot; he said , &quot; . . . the Europeans are always delighted when they can hold our coats and we can go_out and get our noses bloodied. &quot; ( See today ' s Commentary page for more. ) Kantor also noted the hypocrisy of Europeans accusing the U.S. of violating free_trade as they protect their own markets ( e.g. , broadcast materials ) . Kantor is right : Japan needs to be more open . But if there is an Achilles ' heel in the U.S. strategy , it is in the perception -- an incorrect one perpetuated by Tokyo -- that Japan must commit itself to setting specific market shares . That would be managed trade . The Administration needs to make clear that the goal is to eliminate barriers , such_as in the Motorola case , not to set quotas . To elucidate , Kantor could point to the insistence of Tokyo , which only recently let U.S. rice in , that foreign rice be mixed with domestic rice . Now that ' s managing trade .</TEXT>
