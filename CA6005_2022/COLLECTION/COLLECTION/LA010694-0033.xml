   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL COUNSEL -- NOT QUITE YET ; JUSTICE DEPT . SHOULD DO ITS JOB AND PROBE WHITEWATER THOROUGHLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What the political_system needs , what the American people deserve and what the integrity of the presidency requires in the so-called Whitewater case is simply this : a spotless , above-reproach probe . The point is to get_to the bottom of the allegations , which President and Mrs . Clinton insist are baseless , and , if possible , move_on . But to drag one ' s feet , as some in the White_House have appeared to do , or to overly politicize the issue , as some who are insisting on a special prosecutor are doing , are both recipes for creating another crippled presidency . The allegations are that Clinton once used his influence as Arkansas ' governor to help a friend and co-investor who was in regulatory hot water over his savings and loan , which eventually went belly up . The allegations concerned events that occurred in the mid-1980s . These events were tied to the Clinton presidency following the suicide last spring of White_House adviser Vincent Foster . After Foster ' s death , White_House aides removed files from his office concerning the Whitewater matter . Those files are yet to be made available to designated Justice_Department prosecutors . The White_House promised Wednesday that it will comply with a grand_jury subpoena demanding the documents by Jan . 18 . that ' s exactly what must happen , for further delay will give the calls_for a special prosecutor a life of_their_own . In fact , a probe of the sort led by special prosecutors in earlier cases is not an option , at least unless and until the House passes a Senate bill approved in November that would restore authority for a panel of judge to select a special prosecutor in any case that requires one . Until that is done , however , all that Atty . Gen . Janet Reno can do other_than what she has done -- order a department probe and promise that it won ' t be a joke -- is to name some lawyers not working for the Justice_Department to head_up an investigation outside the department ' s walls . But would that necessarily prove superior to a departmental probe ? We think not , and in fact there is a good chance that delay outside the department would be worse than any delay within it . Inside the department , Reno ' s feet no less than Clinton ' s will be held to the fire . It would be a mistake to let Reno off_the_hook . Let the outspoken and apparently independent-minded attorney_general do her job and have the Justice_Department , whose taxpayer-supported budget runs_into the billions , demonstrate that it is apolitical by delivering findings that are incontrovertible . And that must proceed without further delay not only because with each day the White_House ' s apparent foot-dragging looks suspicious ; there is also a technical reason . These allegations are so old that , though prosecutors have some time left to pursue criminal leads , the statutory clock_on some of the possible charges winds down as early as March 2 .</TEXT>
