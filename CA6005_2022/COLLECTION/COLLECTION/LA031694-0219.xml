   <HEADLINE> DRYWALL FIRMS INVESTIGATED FOR ILLEGAL WORKERS ; EMPLOYMENT : MORE THAN HALF OF 800 EMPLOYEES IN FIVE SOUTHLAND COMPANIES WERE FOUND TO BE IN U.S. ILLEGALLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After finding that more_than half the 800 workers employed by five Southern California drywall companies last year were illegal immigrants , the U.S. Border_Patrol has begun investigating the hiring records of 46 additional drywall firms . The probe , expected to last through mid-June , involves companies in Orange , Los Angeles , Riverside , San Diego and San Bernardino counties that together employed about 3 # 000 residential drywall installers last year . Many of the workers are members of Carpenters Union Local 2361 in Orange , but the union is not being targeted in the investigation , said David Garrett , supervising agent of the Border_Patrol ' s employer sanctions unit in Temecula . If the probe results in barring hundreds of illegal workers from the industry , as Board Patrol officials intend , it could lead to labor shortages and construction slowdowns just as the Southern California housing_industry begins recovering from four years of deep recession . The investigation has angered several drywall companies . Their contract with the carpenters union calls_for the union to screen workers and verify their legal employment status . Gordon Hubbell , the drywall union contract administrator for the Southern California Conference of Carpenters , acknowledged that the pact calls_for the union to screen workers . But he called the screening clause an effort by the union to assist employers -- not to assume their legal responsibilities . Drywall workers in Southern California ' s residential building industry conducted a five-month wildcat strike in 1992 , complaining of exploitation by employers because they were not members of a union . The installation of drywall -- an inexpensive and near universal replacement for plaster finishes on the interior walls of homes -- tends to draw undocumented workers because employment is transitory , the work is not highly skilled and knowledge of the_English language is not a requirement . The Carpenters Union agreed to represent the strikers and in November , 1992 , most of Southern California ' s large residential drywall installation companies signed a master contract agreement . Garrett said federal law holds the employer responsible_for verifying legal_status . The contract between the drywall firms and the union is a civil contract and doesn ' t relieve the employers of their responsibility , he said . As a result , one of the five companies initially investigated by Garrett ' s agents -- SMR Drywall Inc. in Lake Elsinore -- is being fined $ 17 # 500 because it has not maintained worker eligibility records , called I-9 forms , since the union contract took_effect in 1992 . Of 117 workers employed by the small company last year , the Border_Patrol agents identified 26 as illegal immigrants . Jim Duddy , SMR Drywall ' s chief_executive , said he intends to file an administrative appeal of the fine . The other four companies involved in the initial probe all had I-9s on file for their employees , Garrett said . One of those companies was Orange County Drywall in Tustin , a third was Cal West Drywall in Yorba Linda . Although most of the illegal workers used falsified papers to establish legal_status , the employers are not required to detect forgeries and thus are not being held liable , he said . Brian Maag , president of Orange County Drywall and president of the Pacific Rim Drywall Contractors Assn. , said the union ' s apparent failure to properly perform employee screening as called_for in its bargaining agreement &quot; could very well &quot; become an issue when contract negotiations begin later this year . The present contract expires Jan . 1 , 1995 . Garrett of the Border_Patrol also said that no arrests of workers or deportation hearings are planned . &quot; The problem isn ' t that there is a lack of documentation for many of these people , but rather that a lot of it is falsified , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
