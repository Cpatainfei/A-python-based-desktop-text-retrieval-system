   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; TIME TO SET THE HUMAN CLOCK BACK ; LASERS AND VOLCANIC ASH ARE HELPING SCIENTISTS DATE FOSSILS MORE PRECISELY . PINPOINTING LUCY ' S AGE IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THE EVOLUTION REVOLUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The path to humanity ' s origins leads through a side_door in a divinity school , down a basement staircase and into the laboratory where , by a laser ' s fierce light , Robert C . Walter is prospecting for time . From his swivel_chair , Walter is combing samples of a prehistoric lake shore that vanished before our primitive ancestors learned to make tools or discovered fire . He hopes to pinpoint the moment that that coastline -- and the scampering apelike pre-humans that inhabited it -- flourished millennia ago . When he is done , Walter will have helped to transform an arid hellhole of bedded silt , sand and volcanic ash in a desolate corner of Ethiopia into a calibrated yardstick of human evolution , marking_off 400 # 000 years of early life . At the private Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley , Walter and his colleagues are using their ability to read the hidden time in the layers of lava deposits around the world to re-date -- and rewrite -- the history of human evolution over the past 4 million years . Scientists who can read the hands on the natural clock of Earth have become arbiters of the acrimonious wars that often rage over scientific_theories of human development . In the process they have settled some heated academic disputes , while triggering new , even fiercer debates . &quot; We are truth-sayers , &quot; said Paul R . Renne , director of the institute ' s geochronology laboratory , which has become a leading center for fossil dating . In recent weeks , the scientists ' ability to date human fossils more precisely has spurred new questions about how quickly primitive hominids evolved into modern humans , when they began making tools , and when they first left their African homeland . They also ended a decades-long mystery by pinpointing the age of Lucy -- the 3.18-million-year-old skeleton that may be our most famous early ancestor . The institute ' s work this year also has triggered debate over whether Africa was the cradle of humanity , as_many scientists believe , or whether our ancestors evolved in many places around the world at_the_same_time . All that these dating experts have to work with is the volcanic_rock and ash that anthropologists might otherwise discard in their search for scraps of bones preserved in stone . By analyzing the chemical contents of rock_crystals from fossil-bearing deposits , researchers can calculate their age . Given the paucity of data on the ancient human record , the ability to date the rocks that yield fossils is especially crucial , experts said . In the past , researchers could best gauge the age of a hominid fossil by comparing its anatomy to bones found at other sites or by evaluating more numerous animal fossils found in nearby sediments . The results were often open_to question . The hominid fossils were too old for some laboratory dating techniques , too young for others , and too precious to grind up as samples for any of them . Today , scientists can calibrate time using the periodic swings of Earth ' s magnetic_poles through the ages , or by the rate at which radioactive uranium naturally turns_to lead . Sometimes they can calculate the passage of time by counting the minute tracks on a rock left by spontaneous fission . Some researchers can measure time by recording the light emitted by residual electrons from sunlight trapped in buried sediments , or by assessing chemical_changes in the composition of the fossil . This is a boon to anthropologists because a hominid fossil without a reliable date is a foundling on the doorstep of time , with no sure place in the human family . At best , it is a museum curiosity that conceals just how it fits precisely into the puzzle of evolution , scientists said . At worst , with a misleading date , it is a false clue . Despite decades of dedicated searching , paleoanthropologists have discovered only a_few thousand fragments of bone to cover the millions of years it took humanity to acquire upright posture , a large brain , language and tool-making ability . For some of the most crucial periods , there are no known human fossils . An ancient blackened molar can be enough for ambitious theorists to conceive a new hominid species . Reputations can be built around a single skeleton or a fossilized footprint . &quot; Anthropologists love to develop theories and then treat the theories as fact , &quot; said dating expert Garniss Curtis , who founded the institute laboratory and developed much of the technology in it . &quot; In the human evolutionary story , it is very difficult to test these opposing models and hypotheses because the evidence is so fragmentary and the dating of it has been so poor , &quot; said Tim D . White of UC Berkeley ' s Laboratory for Human Evolutionary Studies . &quot; You could accommodate the fossil record to whatever point_of_view you had. &quot; New , more sensitive dating techniques allow researchers to reconcile the evidence of fossil hominids found around the world . The new technology of dating also is giving scientists their first real glimpse into the speed and pace of human evolution . &quot; The mode of evolutionary change is often very obvious , &quot; said institute President Donald C . Johanson . &quot; The teeth get bigger . The skull gets larger . The brain case increases . What people would like to know is the tempo of evolutionary change. &quot; &quot; The techniques of dating are increasing in accuracy in leaps and bounds , &quot; said Elisabeth Vrba , an expert on paleobiology and geology at Yale_University . &quot; All kinds of new techniques are coming_to bear. &quot; All the dating methods have drawbacks . Some work only if the sample is relatively new ; others are effective only with the most ancient samples . Uranium-lead dating is only useful for rocks that are more_than 25 million years old . Others have margins of error so broad that they are useless in calibrating the precise increments of human evolution . Even when scientists can date layers of sediments and ash , they still must prove whether the fossil belongs in the layer where it was discovered . If a fossil is young enough -- usually less than 50 # 000 years old -- researchers can determine its age precisely by measuring the amount of carbon-14 it may have absorbed from the atmosphere while it was alive . The technique has been a mainstay for decades , but if the fossil is too_much older -- as most early hominid fossils are -- radio-carbon dating is not reliable . Scientists owe their confidence in the newest dating results to refinements in potassium-argon dating , which derives information from analysis of volcanic deposits . It picks_up where carbon-dating leaves off -- 50 # 000 years ago and earlier . Computerized argon laser fusion , a variant of potassium-dating developed by University of Toronto researchers and the Berkeley group , is so sensitive that a scientist can use one crystal of volcanic ash to determine the geologic instant when our ancestors walked the Earth . It has become the tool of choice for those attempting to date early human evolution , Renne said . &quot; Dating has gotten a lot better in the last few years , much more reliable , with much fewer errors , &quot; said Andrew Hill , curator for anthropology at Yale ' s Peabody Museum of Natural_History . &quot; And in connection with human evolution , it is largely because of that institute lab. &quot; In his basement laboratory , Walter methodically steers the laser_beam over an irradiated grain of volcanic ash mined from an ancient lakeside in Ethiopia where the remains of some of mankind ' s earliest known ancestors have been found . The laboratory ' s computerized laser fusion setup can handle 221 samples at a time on a platform the size of an Oreo . The grain is no larger than a crystal from a saltshaker . He blasts it into oblivion . In the instant the grain glows white hot , it gives_up a gas like a last breath that is exhaled into a maze of heated steel tubes and wheezing vacuum_pumps , purified , and charged by an electron beam . A powerful magnet accelerates the charged gas and hurls it against a device that counts its constituent argon atoms . Each speeding argon atom is a measure of time on a clock set when the universe was made . By measuring the relative amounts of two isotopes of the element , researchers can tell how much time has elapsed since the lava cooled and crystals formed . &quot; Argon accumulates over time . The older the sample , the more argon there is in it and the easier it is to measure , &quot; Walter said . Earlier this year , Walter came_up with the first reliable date for the fossil skeleton known as Lucy . Last month , he put a date on the first nearly complete skull from her species , making_it the youngest known example of the earliest recognized human ancestor . He was able to establish the date by bracketing the bones in time . He dated crystals of volcanic feldspar taken from layers of ash around where the fossils were found , establishing a narrow range when the diminutive hominids were alive . &quot; Lucy was discovered about 20 years ago and we have been trying to figure_out how old this fossil was ever since , &quot; Walter said . &quot; Lucy has become an icon for her species , a fashion_model . Everybody knows who she is , but we never understood how old she was. &quot; Her remains are now believed to be more_than 3.18 million years old , making her one of the youngest known members of her species . Johanson , who discovered the Lucy skeleton in 1974 and later established the nonprofit institute in the building that houses UC Berkeley ' s divinity school , was relieved to see the age question finally settled . &quot; Now that , at long last , we have nailed_down what was a slippery date for Lucy , it adds integrity to the whole notion of the family_trees we put_together , &quot; he said . Combined with other new fossil evidence discovered in different parts of Africa by White and Johanson , scientists are convinced that her fragmented remains represent a single species -- Australopithecus_afarensis -- that thrived for more_than 900 # 000 years without significant physical changes , until something jolted them out of their evolutionary rut and onto the path to modern humanity . The laboratory ' s dating work also is eliminating the uncertainty clouding all_the fossils discovered in the Hadar , the area of Ethiopia where Lucy was found . It is one of the world ' s richest sources of hominid fossils . &quot; The Hadar , which was a remarkably rich source of fossils , was handicapped by the inability to date anything reliably , &quot; said William H . Kimbel , institute director of paleontology . Part of the problem was technical . When the first hominid fossils were discovered there in the mid-1970s , potassium dating was so crude that 500 pounds of samples might yield a_few ounces of material pure enough for testing . The results often raised as_many questions as they tried to answer . But the problems were also political . For a decade , civil unrest in Ethiopia and changes in government policies effectively barred foreign researchers from the Hadar . So even when the technology improved , Johanson , Walter and their colleagues could not collect new samples to date the fossils . They finally were allowed to return in 1990 . Now experts must consider the idea that bands of these prehistoric pre-humans may have begun their journey from their evolutionary homeland more_than half a_million years earlier than believed . Curtis speculates that the primitive ancestors may have left Africa even earlier . Until Curtis and Swisher rearranged the history of this prolific species , most anthropologists believed that its success was based on mastery of prehistoric high-technology . Armed with sharper stone axes , Homo_erectus carved out a place for itself wherever it went , spreading to the Middle_East , Europe and across Asia to the Pacific , experts thought . Now they are not so sure . The new date means that the hominids may have been well-established around the world long before the development of the more sophisticated stone tools . It complicates an entire pattern of human evolution , experts said . No one now can be certain whether Homo_erectus developed in Asia rather than in Africa , as most evidence indicates , or whether the development of tools had anything to do with the species ' success , or even if the two are members of the same species . Now no one can be sure which group gave_rise to modern humanity . So far , most experts are treating the new date very cautiously . &quot; It shows that people got_out of Africa earlier than we thought , &quot; Hill said . &quot; I don ' t think it shows that people evolved in Asia . . . . It doesn ' t shake the whole family_tree , &quot; he said . In all likelihood , the learned arguments over the Java fossils will last_out the decade . But scientists on both sides acknowledge that the revolution in dating technology puts the debate over human origins in proper focus , with the emphasis on the meaning hidden in the rock-encrusted fragments of human ancestors , not the hunt for their proper place in time . When scientists can find a fossil ' s niche in time , they also discover its rightful place in the story of human evolution . And when scientists refine the age of museum specimens , it can force other researchers to reconsider the meaning of even the well-studied human fossils , calling into question some of the most cherished conceptions of evolution . In February , Curtis and institute researcher Charles Swisher III revealed that another well-known fossil of a more recent human ancestor -- a prehistoric child whose skull was discovered in Java in 1936 -- was a_million years older than believed . This upset what had been thought to be one of the few straightforward stories of human origins . For decades , the tortoise-shell-shaped fossil -- an example of a species called Homo_erectus that followed Lucy and her kind -- was thought to be 1 million years old . Using state-of-the-art argon-dating , Curtis and Swisher calculated the skull ' s age at 1.8 million years . That makes_it the oldest hominid fossil found outside Africa , and as old as the earliest examples of Homo_erectus found in East Africa . The Evoluntionary Yardstick Sophisticated dating techniques are turning simple sediments into high-technology timelines . Scientists recently unearthed the first almost complete skull of humanity ' s earliest recognized ancestor , Australopithecus_afarensis . The sparse fossil record suggests that there were several species of primitive hominids , sometimes co-existing , before modern humans emerged . Many experts think that Neandarthals and modern humans are so different anatomically that they could not belong_to the same species . Homo neanderthalensis ( Neanderthal ) Homo_sapiens ( Modern_man ) 120 # 000 years ago : Dating helps overturn a theory that Neanderthals evolved into early modern humans about 50 # 000 years ago , by identifying primitive Neandarthal and human remains between 100 # 000 years and 120 # 000 years old . 3.18 million years ago : More precise argon dating for humanity ' s earliest ancestors helps to show that these ape-like hominds flourished for at least 900 # 000 years without change . 200 # 000 years ago : New dating of a fossil skull suggests that the oldest forms of Homo sapiens in Asia might be more_than 200 # 000 years old . 1.8 million years ago : More precise dating this year revealed that fossils in Java of Homo_erectus -- the first hominid to leave Africa -- are twice as old as previously believed . Evolving Theories OUT OF AFRICA THEORY This theory is based on dating evidence that showed oldest Homo_erectus fossils in Africa to be 2 million years old , with similar fossils in Java only 800 # 00 years old . The spread of Homo_erectus began as much as 1.8 million years ago . Homo_sapiens ' expansion began around 100 # 000 years ago . MULTIREGIONAL HYPOTHESIS Better dating shows that the fossils in both places are about the same age , suggesting these hominds either left Africa a_million years earlier or evolved elsewhere . Regional populations of Homo_erectus may have evolved into Homo sapiens while intermingling with one another . The Fossil Record The first almost complete afarensis skull was found in the Hadar region of Ethiopia , left , about a mile from the famous &quot; Lucy &quot; skeleton . Researchers use precise argon dating to read the age of volcanic deposits , and thus determine the place in time of fossils found there . 2.92 million years ago New afarensis male skull . 3.18 million years ago Lucy skull &quot; First Family &quot; remains of 13-hominid individuals 3.22 million years ago Female cranium Male humerus 3.40 million years ago Bedrock Researched by ROBERT LEE HOTZ / Los Angeles Times Graphics by MICHAEL HALL / Los Angeles Times Sources : The Institute of Human Origins ; Peking University ; Nature ; Science ; The Origins of Modern Humans , Scientific American Library .</TEXT>
