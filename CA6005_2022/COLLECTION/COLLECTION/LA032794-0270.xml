   <HEADLINE> A DESPERATE QUEST ; OCEANSIDE-AREA PARENTS PERSUADE HEALTH OFFICIALS TO INVESTIGATE AN OUTBREAK OF CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA , BUT CHANCES OF ANSWERS ARE SLIM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Connie Smith lives with the horrifying thought that in trying to make a better life for her family , she may have put her son in the remorseless grip of cancer . Six months after the Smith family moved to this seaside suburb north of San Diego , 1-year-old Kenneth Smith Jr. , known simply as Junior , fell mysteriously ill and was diagnosed with acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia , which kills more children than any other disease in America . As Junior began treatments , Smith met other parents of cancer-stricken children and together they discovered a startling fact that had gone undetected by doctors : An unusually large_number of Oceanside-area children had been discovered to have leukemia about the same time . Choosing to fight rather than grieve , Smith and the other parents banded_together to persuade public health officials that they had discovered a cancer cluster in Oceanside and urge an investigation into the cause . &quot; There are a lot of babies getting sick and I don ' t like it , &quot; said Connie Smith . &quot; My son is already sick but maybe there are other babies that we can help save if can we find_out what ' s causing this. &quot; Although cancer is common , clusters are not . The Oceanside cluster , now being probed by county and state health investigators , is one of only a handful of cancer clusters discovered in California in the last 30 years . &quot; We don ' t want to panic anyone but we want answers , &quot; said Charlotte Barry , whose daughter , Laura , is undergoing chemotherapy . For Connie Smith and her husband , Kenneth , the unlikely road to becoming public health activists began two years ago when they decided to leave the community of Signal Hill near Long_Beach . &quot; I didn ' t want my kids to die in a drive-by_shooting , &quot; Connie Smith said . The family moved to a small apartment in a tidy corner of Oceanside . Kenneth was willing to endure the long commute to his job in Los Angeles as an oil_company mechanic so that Junior and his sister , Kristian , 6 , could grow_up safely . In Oceanside , Junior developed an unshakable cough , began to bruise easily and became chronically tired and cranky . Distraught and frantic for explanations for her son ' s sudden decline , his mother accused a baby-sitter of mistreating him . After being found to have leukemia , Junior began rigorous treatment at Childrens Hospital in San Diego , one of the nation ' s leading hospitals for treating childhood cancer . During the many hours at the hospital ' s hematology unit , Connie Smith began talking to other mothers of children undergoing leukemia treatment . None of the women had known one another before their children began undergoing the anti-cancer therapies that are part of a leukemia patient ' s daily rigors . But Connie Smith , Charlotte Barry , Maryanne Smith , Linda Cotov and others began to suspect that there were an unusually high number of childhood leukemia cases in the area where they lived . The area , which has an approximate five-mile radius , includes the northeast section of Oceanside and adjoining parts of Vista and Bonsall . Connie Smith and the others compiled a list of neighborhood children who were_sick with leukemia and , after finding the public health agencies unresponsive , they took their list and their plea for help to the local media . &quot; We know God is protecting Hank , but if we can do something to help protect other children , that would be great , &quot; said Maryanne Smith , whose son , Hank , needs a bone_marrow transplant . The public health system has concluded that the mothers were right : Seven children under the age of 3 were found to have leukemia during the middle months of 1993 , a rate two to three times higher than the national average for the disease , a rate high enough to be considered a cluster . In medical circles , there is considerable disagreement about cancer clusters and whether a cluster ' s existence is anything more_than a statistical anomaly , a random event . Some researchers even assert that it is medical folly to look_for causes and that cluster investigations only cruelly raise the expectations of cancer patients and their families . Experts from the San Diego County and California health departments , although committed to an investigation , have nevertheless warned the parents and press that the chances of pinpointing a cause for the Oceanside cluster are extraordinarily small . The parents know this but are convinced that something is dreadfully wrong in Oceanside . &quot; I ' m boiling mad but it doesn ' t do any good to stay mad , &quot; said Ernie Haro , whose son , Steven , needs a bone_marrow transplant . &quot; Somebody out there has to know something about what is in our soil or in our air that ' s making our kids sick. &quot; The cluster list compiled by the mothers actually included a dozen children dating to 1991 who had contracted the disease . State and county health officials have limited their cluster investigation to the seven cases from 1993 , including one child who died . The cancer cluster has become the talk_of Oceanside . After the story was first aired on KFMB-TV , the local CBS affiliate , hundreds of calls from parents and would-be home_buyers flooded the television_station and the San Diego County chapter of the Leukemia Society of America . &quot; One caller said she was about to close on a house in Oceanside and asked whether she should go_ahead or back_out , &quot; said Sharon Murphy , the chapter ' s executive_director . &quot; It ' s not right that people have to live with that kind of fear. &quot; Murphy hopes to get approval for an epidemiologist from the group ' s national office to join in the county and state investigation . She is advising parents and others not to leave Oceanside . Barbara Ross , whose 3-year-old daughter , Meghan , died of leukemia in November , 1992 , lives near Charlotte Barry and Maryanne Smith . She said a neighbor called her at 6:15 one morning after reading about the cancer cluster in the Oceanside Blade-Citizen . &quot; She was really panicked , &quot; Ross said . &quot; She said , ' Do you think we should move ? ' I don ' t think it ' s time to panic but it ' s time for concern. &quot; Ross said that she and her husband could never understand how their daughter had been so healthy when the family lived_in Anaheim but became so sick just months after moving to Oceanside . &quot; We couldn ' t come_up with an answer , &quot; she said . The Blade-Citizen ' s coverage of the cancer cluster , praised as factual and restrained by parents and doctors , has nevertheless raised the anger of some in the business_community . One real_estate_agent told the paper , &quot; I have compassion for these people , but to make_it look_like Oceanside is the cancer capital of the world is unrealistic. &quot; The cluster investigators will start by comparing medical_histories of the seven children to look_for similarities in tumor size and physiology and for any common problems experienced by their mothers during pregnancy . Comparative biopsies are a possibility . In more advanced cancer cluster investigations , like those undertaken by the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control , air , water and soil samples are taken . If the Oceanside investigation gets that elaborate , environmental suspects abound . Several of the homes are in new subdivisions on former agricultural sites , where pesticides were used for decades . Others are near high power_lines . An abandoned dump site is in the area . Two victims lived near Camp Pendleton , where hazardous materials are stored . And there is the &quot; new town theory &quot; held by some scientists who believe cancer clusters happen for a reason . The theory , based on cancer cluster research in England , holds that certain diseases occur in higher proportions in new communities because people , in_effect , lose their natural immunity when they move from more densely populated urban_centers . The phenomenon was first detected among young polio victims in the 1940s and 1950s . Dr. Stephen Waterman , chief of community disease control for San Diego County , puts the odds at finding a cause of the Oceanside cluster at less than one in a_thousand . Others are less optimistic . &quot; There has never been a cause found for a leukemia cluster , &quot; said Kenneth Rothman , editor of Epidemiology magazine . In fact , the very meaning of clusters , and whether they are anything more_than statistical blips , is hotly debated among epidemiologists , whose specialty is the investigation of the causes of disease . &quot; Cancer clusters are one of the issues that have tortured epidemiologists for years , particularly with leukemia , &quot; said Dr. Dimitrios Trichopoulos , chief of epidemiology at Harvard Medical_School . &quot; It challenges common_sense ; if there is a cluster , there must be a reason . But so_much in medicine , like in life , is just chance or bad luck. &quot; Rothman wrote an article for the American Journal of Epidemiology , &quot; A Sobering Start for the Cluster Busters Conference. &quot; In it , he doubted the scientific wisdom of spending time and resources investigating most cancer clusters . The state_Department of Health Services takes a somewhat contrary viewpoint . Dr. Raymond Richard Neutra , one of the department ' s cluster hunters , wrote a spirited rejoinder to Rothman in the same academic journal . Like Neutra , Dr. Eva Glazer , a state health department cancer expert who is working_on the Oceanside cluster , takes the long view . Even if the cause of the Oceanside cluster remains unknown , the information gleaned may someday contribute to cracking the mystery of clusters , Glazer said . She notes no new cases have been diagnosed since October , which tends to support the random-event theory . The long view , of course , is hard to accept for parents whose children have gone bald from chemotherapy , are subject_to a daunting list of infections and complications , and whose chances for survival are listed at less than 50 % . Connie and Kenneth Smith have moved from Oceanside , saying they want to escape the overhead power_lines -- although there is no proof that electromagnetic fields from power_lines cause cancer . Their daughter , Kristian , is being educated at_home for fear that she might bring_home an infection from school that would kill Junior , who is recuperating from a bone_marrow transplant . Kristian was the transplant donor . Maryanne and Chuck Smith , initially buoyed by the news that Hank was responding marvelously to chemotherapy , were crestfallen recently when their doctors told them that Hank will need a bone_marrow transplant after all . Charlotte Barry ' s daughter , Laura , is adjusting to weekly chemotherapy sessions that leave her weak and nauseated . &quot; She has a very strong body and a resilient soul , &quot; her mother said . Linda and Steve Cotov have moved so their daughter , Courtney , who is not yet 2 , is closer to Childrens Hospital . &quot; If we could find a cause for this , maybe it would be easier to bear , &quot; Linda Cotov said . Ernie and Valerie Haro are waiting for a bone_marrow donor to be found for 2-year-old Steven . Unfortunately , no family member is a match . &quot; He ' s so young and he may_not ever get a chance to hit a home_run or kiss a girl at the beach , &quot; Ernie Haro said . &quot; I just want to know the reason. &quot;</TEXT>
