   <HEADLINE> ISLAMIC MILITANTS GIVEN LIFE TERMS IN N.Y. BOMBING ; TERRORISM : JUDGE SAYS THE FOUR ' VIOLATED THE LAWS NOT ONLY OF MAN , BUT GOD ' IN KILLING SIX AT WORLD TRADE CENTER . GROUP SOUGHT TO PUNISH U.S. FOR BACKING ISRAEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shouting their defiance , four Islamic militants were sentenced Tuesday to spend the rest of their lives in prison without parole for last year ' s bombing of the World Trade Center . In imposing the maximum possible punishment for what the government has termed &quot; the worst act of terrorism in U.S. history , &quot; U.S. District Judge Kevin T . Duffy called the defendants sneaks and cowards . &quot; What you sought to do_in the name of Islam . . . &quot; he admonished them , &quot; violated the laws not only of man , but God. &quot; Each was sentenced to serve 240 years . The noontime explosion on Feb . 26 , 1993 , killed six people , injured more_than 1 # 000 and filled the 110-story twin towers with smoke and flames . It also shattered America ' s sense of post-Cold War invulnerability and the belief that terrorism is an overseas phenomenon . Evidence presented during the trial showed that the defendants had sought to punish Americans for their support of Israel by targeting one of the nation ' s best-known landmarks . &quot; There has been no remorse shown , merely arrogance and nothing else , &quot; Duffy said as he sentenced the principal defendant , Mohammed A . Salameh , 26 , who rented the van that carried the 1 # 200-pound bomb into the trade center ' s underground garage . &quot; Somehow , you have a sense of achievement . Perhaps you feel you are a martyr. &quot; Federal authorities broke the case last year after tracing the rented van to Salameh through an identification_number found on a piece of debris . &quot; You chose a site to kill the greatest number of people possible , &quot; the judge told Salameh . If the bomb had been placed at the base of the trade center ' s north tower , he said , &quot; as_many as 10 # 000 deaths could have resulted. &quot; Outside the federal courthouse , where a jury had convicted the defendants on March 4 , dozens of New York police stood behind barricades to guard against any violent demonstration or perhaps another bombing attempt . No trouble ensued and by late afternoon some patrol officers were slumped over the wooden barricades as if dozing . Salameh , like the other defendants , said before sentencing that the months-long jury trial had been infected with bias because of unfair treatment by &quot; the media in the United States and Europe. &quot; He and his accomplices also objected that , after they fired their court-appointed lawyers two months ago , Duffy prohibited them from retaining famed civil_rights lawyer William M . Kunstler to handle their appeals . Duffy ruled against Kunstler on grounds that he already is representing one or two defendants in a related bombing conspiracy trial next fall , involving a militant Egyptian sheik and a dozen others . Although the government would like Salameh and two other convicted bombers to testify at that trial , Salameh told the court in a booming voice : &quot; The government wants us to testify falsely in the name of cooperation . I will not testify in that other case against anyone. &quot; Referring to his own case , he said , &quot; I am not going_to plead for mercy . I will not beg. &quot; Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman , regarded by Salameh and the others as their spiritual_leader , and 12 co-defendants are charged with conspiring not only to bomb the World Trade Center , but also to blow_up the U.N. building and the Lincoln and Holland commuter tunnels linking New York City with New Jersey . Duffy reserved his harshest condemnation for the second defendant , Nidal Ayyad , 26 , a chemical engineer who helped finance the bombing and ordered chemicals and hydrogen gas for the homemade explosive_device . &quot; You are clearly the most culpable of the defendants . You had_the_best breaks , &quot; Duffy told him , referring to his U.S. college education . The judge said Ayyad had violated the oath he took upon becoming a U.S. citizen &quot; and turned your life into a total lie. &quot; Ayyad also was convicted of sending an anonymous letter to the New York Times threatening further acts of violence unless the United States cut_off all assistance to Israel . Ayyad responded defiantly to Duffy : &quot; You are only a judge . You can put me in prison for five or 10 lives . But God is more powerful than America. &quot; When Ayyad complained that &quot; human_rights advocates &quot; had not monitored his treatment during months in detention , Duffy interjected : &quot; Did human_rights organizations monitor the people whom you killed ? &quot; Ed Smith , a New Yorker who lost his pregnant wife , Monica , in the blast , addressed the court before sentencing to urge harsh punishment for the bombers . &quot; I lost my wife and I will never get_to see my son grow_up , &quot; Smith said in a choked voice . &quot; We lost all this because of an act of terrorism against the United States. &quot; The other two defendants , Mahmud Abouhalima , 34 , and Ahmad Mohammad Ajaj , 28 , claimed that they were victims of American injustice , repeatedly invoked the name of God and said they would rely_on divine_law over human law . Abouhalima , who was pictured as &quot; field_general &quot; of the bombing , helped construct the bomb and purchased gas for the delivery_van the morning of the crime . Ajaj was convicted of carrying bomb-making manuals into the country several months before the blast . All four defendants , speaking through an Arabic interpreter , were dressed in loose-fitting brown dungarees issued by the federal penitentiary at Lewisburg , Pa. , where they had been held pending sentencing . It was unclear if they would serve their sentences at Lewisburg or at an even higher-security institution at Marion , Ill. , where many convicted mobsters and drug_traffickers are imprisoned . None of the defendants testified at the trial . Duffy said 180 years of each sentence was based on the life expectancies of the six people who died in the explosion . He also imposed fines of $ 250 # 000 on each defendant to be used as restitution to families of the victims . Federal sources said they did not know if the fines ever can be collected . Mary Jo White , U.S. attorney in Manhattan , said outside court that the sentences &quot; send an unmistakable message that this country will respond decisively to terrorist acts. &quot;</TEXT>
