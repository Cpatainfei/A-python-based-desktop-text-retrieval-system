   <TEXT> Fifty years ago , Karoly Lendvai was caught_up in the Nazi horror , and narrowly escaped becoming one of the millions who died . But he still doesn ' t know what happened or why . He isn ' t even familiar_with such terms as Holocaust . Lendvai , a 65-year-old Gypsy , lives in a hut built of bricks , mud , a little of this and a little of that . He is a survivor of a largely overlooked chapter in the history of Nazi genocide . &quot; Why did they do_it ? &quot; he asked an interviewer poking_into a trove of memories a half-century old . &quot; Because I ' m a Gypsy ? That can ' t be . that ' s no reason. &quot; It could be , and it was . Gypsies were rounded_up , brutalized , interned , deported . Nazi doctor Josef Mengele conducted medical experiments on them . Sybil Milton , deputy director of the U.S. Holocaust Museum and the author of a study of Nazi policies toward Gypsies , cites high-ranking German officials in the 1930s as concluding that &quot; the national_socialist state will have to settle the Gypsy question just as it has solved the Jewish question. &quot; Thought to have descended from a tribe that left India in the fifth century , Gypsies have suffered prejudice and defied assimilation in Europe for centuries . The Nazis considered them an inferior race . Just like millions of Jews , Gypsies were designated for liquidation . Eleven million people -- 6 million of them Jews -- are thought to have died in Nazi death camps . Determining the number of Gypsies killed is difficult because they were not registered , and many died in transit and were buried in unmarked graves , said Waclaw Dlugoborski , curator for scientific_research at the Auschwitz Museum and historian at Poland ' s Wroclaw University . He said estimates for all_of Europe range from 200 # 000 to 500 # 000 dead . In Poland , an estimated 70 % of the Gypsies died . French Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld said no French historian so far has taken the time to search French or German archives carefully for material on the Gypsy Holocaust . In an effort to draw attention to the question , Dlugoborski is organizing an international commemoration of the Gypsy Holocaust Aug . 2-3 at Auschwitz , the infamous extermination site . Today there are an estimated 15 million Gypsies in Europe , a half-million of them in Hungary . They are Hungary ' s largest minority . No one had ever asked Lendvai what happened to him , and he had not spoken_of it outside his own family . Given his people ' s oral tradition and a longstanding climate of prejudice against Gypsies , little was said -- much less written -- about their suffering . &quot; Of course , Gypsies do not know their own history , &quot; said Gypsy author Menyhert Lakatos . &quot; It was not in anyone ' s interest to enlighten them. &quot; Hungary was allied_with Germany but generally did not transport its Jews , Gypsies and others to Nazi camps until German soldiers came_in 1944 . Fifty years ago this summer -- Lendvai cannot remember the month -- Hungarian police descended on the town of Szentgal 75 miles southwest of Budapest where he grew_up . They began forcing a dozen Gypsy families to walk 45 miles north to Komarom , location of the notorious Csillag internment_camp run_by Hungary ' s variant of the Nazis , the Arrow Cross . &quot; As we were marched through villages , others joined our group , more Gypsies and more gendarmes , &quot; recalled Lendvai in a soft , hoarse voice . &quot; Some babies died along the way , and some would-be escapees were shot , left by the roadside . No one knows who they were. &quot; &quot; We were in the camp about two weeks with hardly any food , and even water was scarce , &quot; he continued . &quot; More people died as typhus broke_out , and others were killed . &quot; The dead were thrown into a huge pit , covered with quicklime . There were layers upon layers of dead . I do not know when the_pit was finally filled because one day we were herded into cattle_cars , to be taken I don ' t know where. &quot; &quot; Rot , you Jew-Gypsy ! &quot; he recalled an Arrow Cross gendarme screaming at him as they were shoved onto the train . A wiry man with hands gnarled by years of dawn-to-dusk work and a tanned , lined face , Lendvai does not give the impression of one open_to many doubts . But today he still wonders : &quot; Why did he call me a Jew ? &quot; He was saved by an air_raid . &quot; Suddenly , there were sirens , and bombs were falling . The car I was in was damaged , and some of us escaped . We hid in the woods for about a year . . . . I never saw the others again. &quot; Erzsebet Kolompar of Sorokpolany , 120 miles southwest of Budapest , recalled similar scenes . She was saved when Arrow Cross guards fled the advancing Soviet army . Lendvai did not know the word &quot; Holocaust , &quot; but he does know that many of his people suffered from it . His own family perished . Records indicate that people from the Komarom camp were shipped to Auschwitz . &quot; There is every reason to believe that had the war dragged_on or had Hitler won , all Gypsies would have been exterminated , &quot; said Agnes Daroczi , an activist who anchors a weekly program on Gypsy affairs on Hungarian state television . Not only is the public largely unaware of the Gypsy Holocaust , but many Gypsies themselves know_nothing about it , she said . &quot; Ours is an oral culture , and there is low contact level among the various Gypsy communities , &quot; she said . She is seeking survivors for a feature-length documentary to mark the 50th anniversary of the extermination of a Gypsy camp at Birkenau , otherwise known as Auschwitz II because of its proximity . Mengele conducted medical experiments on Gypsy children , including twins . Most of them died , wrote Hermann Langbein , a prisoner-doctor at Auschwitz , in a 1975 book . U.S. journalist and historian William Shirer wrote in &quot; The Rise and Fall of the Third_Reich &quot; that Gypsies were selected at Dachau and Buchenwald to see how they might be able to live_on salt water . Andras T . Hegedues , a Budapest University professor and expert on minority affairs , said 50 # 000 to 60 # 000 Gypsies were deported in 1944-45 . He cannot determine how many were sent to Hungarian camps and how many went_to Nazi camps . &quot; I am also aware that many people were killed on the spot as they were rounded_up , and no records of those killings exit , &quot; Hegedues said . Franciszek Piper , head of the Auschwitz Museum ' s historical department , said 23 # 000 Gypsies were taken_to Birkenau , and nearly 21 # 000 died there . &quot; The ratio of Gypsies killed was as high as that of Jews , &quot; he said . Survivors like Lendvai and Kolompar welcome the effort to tell their story to Hungarians and the world at_large after a half-century of silence . But Daroczi , the TV journalist , said younger Gypsies are suspicious and largely hostile . Their view , built_on a history of repression , is : &quot; No need to give them ideas , &quot; she said . Istvan Tauber , a Budapest University professor , said his doctoral study of recent attitudes toward Gypsies found that almost 40 % of more_than 800 people interviewed still favored some sort of discrimination against Gypsies . About 2.7 % said they supported physical liquidation .</TEXT>
