   <HEADLINE> TCI PLAN TO BUY AMERICA ONLINE STAKE IS STALLED BY MICROSOFT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tele-Communications Inc. , the nation ' s largest and most influential cable company , was poised to acquire a 9 % stake in America Online Inc. until Microsoft Corp . Chairman Bill Gates intervened , according to sources close to TCI . The acquisition is now on hold while TCI Chief_Executive John Malone and_Gates discuss whether the Vienna , Va.-based cable behemoth can invest in Marvel , the code name for the on-line service that Microsoft has been secretly developing , according to sources . The service , expected to be launched next year , would be a major competitor to America Online , analysts said . TCI and Microsoft declined to comment . One source close to Microsoft dismissed the idea that a deal was imminent between Microsoft and TCI . With sales of on-line computer services booming at_the_same_time that the much-hyped interactive television experiments are stumbling badly , companies such_as TCI have been looking_to make major investments in on-line firms . At the same time , on-line companies have been seeking cable partners to help them push into new markets . They want to use the cable networks , which are_better designed than phone_lines to carry material such_as video and color graphics , and are looking_to cable companies to provide expertise in entertainment . On-line services enable computers with modems to use telephone_lines to communicate with other computers . Worldwide sales of on-line services are expected to reach $ 17.8 billion in 1998 , a 57 % increase from 1993 , according to Simba Information Inc. , a New York-based research company . America Online learned of TCI ' s interest a_few weeks ago , one source said . TCI was considering buying the 9 % stake in the company owned by billionaire Paul Allen , a co-founder of Redmond , Wash.-based Microsoft . Allen at one time owned almost 25 % of America Online , but when he failed to gain management control he decided to sell his stake . TCI officials wanted to know if America Online executives would look favorably on a TCI investment , sources said . America Online heartily endorsed the idea , seeing it as an important endorsement by a company that is expected to be a key player in the interactive entertainment world . About a week ago , all_the parties were ready to sign an agreement , and America Online was revving_up its public relations machine to announce the new investor , sources said . But TCI negotiators , noting that the cable company had partnerships with Microsoft , said it needed to check those contracts to make_sure a stake in America Online would not present a conflict . &quot; Microsoft got nervous when they heard &quot; that TCI was thinking_of investing in America Online , sources said . America Online is one of the fastest-growing of the on-line services and would be a key competitor for Marvel . In the past week , Gates and Malone have started discussions about a TCI investment in the Microsoft on-line service , sources said , putting the acquisition of the America Online shares from Allen on hold .</TEXT>
