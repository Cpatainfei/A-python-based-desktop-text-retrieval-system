   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; GROUPS REPORT A SURGE OF INTEREST IN ' LIVING WILLS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The late Richard Nixon ' s decision to make his explicit wishes known about the course of his medical treatment during his final hours has resulted in a surge of new interest in the concept of the &quot; living will , &quot; medical ethicists and others said Monday . &quot; Our lines have been completely jammed , &quot; said Ann Fade , director of legal services for Choice in Dying , a New York-based organization that provides forms for people interested in writing such documents . &quot; We send_out about a quarter of a_million living wills a year -- but the number goes_up , depending_on what ' s happening in the news. &quot; She said her organization , which sends the paperwork for free , typically receives 100 to 200 telephone_calls a day , but in the days since Nixon ' s death , &quot; we ' ve been getting 500 a day. &quot; The former president , who died Friday night in New York four days after suffering a major stroke , apparently had made_it clear that he wanted no extraordinary medical measures taken if he developed a serious condition that would leave him incapacitated , particularly intellectually . Despite the advantages of living_wills , studies show that no more_than 20 % of the U.S. population has them , experts said . &quot; It ' s hard to get people to do_it , &quot; said George Annas , director of the law , medicine and ethics program at Boston University . &quot; Hardly any Americans fill_out any forms at all unless they ' re required by law . They don ' t want to think_about death . Or when they think_about it , they would rather talk_about it than write something down . They ' re superstitious . My mother ' s like that -- ' If I write it down , it means I ' m going_to die. ' &quot; Fade , of Choice in Dying , said &quot; most people think : ' Oh , I want my family to make these decisions for me , ' &quot; and automatically assume they can , when &quot; in some states , your family can ' t -- treatment just has to continue . The family doesn ' t always have a say unless you specifically designate them. &quot; Most experts believe that while a living will is useful , it may be more valuable to give a surrogate a &quot; health proxy &quot; -- granting that person the legal_status to make critical medical decisions in the event an individual is incapable of doing so . Living wills by themselves may prove to be inadequate because they cannot address all potential medical situations and are subject_to interpretation . Most states have statutes providing_for the right of individuals to create living wills , also known as advanced directives , and to appoint health proxies who have the durable power_of_attorney . In 1976 , California became one of the first_states in the nation to establish statutes providing_for living wills and health proxies . The statutes make_it clear that medical personnel following instructions in a living will are not criminally liable , said Alex Capron , UCS professor of law and medicine . It is important to talk with the surrogate at length &quot; and make your wishes known , &quot; Capron said . Also , all states are subject_to the Patient Self-Determination Act , a federal law that requires all health_care facilities -- hospitals , nursing_homes , hospices -- to offer patients information about the relevant laws in their state regarding living wills and durable power_of_attorney .</TEXT>
