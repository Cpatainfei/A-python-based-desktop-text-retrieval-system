   <HEADLINE> RICHARD EDER : THE RIOT THAT FOUND ITS THRENODY ; THE BREAD OF TIME : TOWARD AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY , BY PHILIP LEVINE ( ALFRED A . KNOPF : $ 23 ; 296 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I don ' t understand . I don ' t understand , &quot; Federico Garcia Lorca exclaimed when he arrived in New York . Out of the bewildered encounter between the finely surreal singer of slain gypsies and flowers that bleed , and Manhattan ' s stink and clangor , came &quot; Poet in New York. &quot; A poet can write_out of any state of spirit as long as he trusts it . Lorca trusted his dismay . And he taught Philip Levine to trust his . Levine came_to poetry in the course of a dozen years alternately spent studying and working in the hot-metal foundries of Detroit ' s auto industry . Illegitimate , not knowing who his father was , raised in near-poverty by a keen-spirited mother , he wore his blue collar with pride ; particularly when he took a course from the languidly patrician Robert Lowell , whom he loathed . He also wore it with a sense of artistic constriction . Had he lived_in the ' 30s , he might have settled into Socialist Realism . In the supremely disengaged ' 50s , his proletarian condition , leftist convictions and passion for the old Spanish Republic had no place to lodge . But there was more to it than that . After working the overnight shift at Chevrolet Gear &amp; Axle , he would try to write , he tells us in one of these autobiographical essays . It didn ' t work . What stopped him was not weariness or unfashionability . It was his own sensibility . How could you write poetry about the gritty reality of America ' s working life ? His rage was rhetoric-sized but he despised rhetoric . He loved Whitman , but there can be no other Whitman . He loved Keats , Stevens , William Carlos Williams and the fine , shining craft . In this doubt , he tells us , he came_upon &quot; Poet in New York. &quot; Outrage shatters the sheer heaviness of things -- derricks , subways , office-buildings -- and the heaviness of outrage is lifted , in turn , by the childlike joyfulness of Lorca ' s imagery . &quot; A wooden wind from the south , &quot; Levine quotes from a dockside passage , &quot; slanting through the black mire / spits on the broken boats and drives tacks into shoulders. / A south_wind that carries / tusks , sunflowers , alphabets , / and a_battery with drowned wasps. &quot; &quot; Never in poetry written in English had I found such a direct confrontation of one image with another or heard such violence held_in abeyance and enclosed in so perfect a musical form , &quot; Levine writes . &quot; What in my work had been chaotic rant was in his a stately threnody circling_around a center of riot. &quot; It validated Levine ' s own rioting center ; it told him that he might find a threnody of_his_own to circle it . It took years , he tells us . It was achieved -- though he doesn ' t tell us -- in his great collection &quot; What Work Is , &quot; published two years ago . The pieces in &quot; The Bread of Time &quot; are a series of experiments in remembering rather than a whole organized act of memory . In suggesting the present simultaneity of discrete past images , Levine sometimes introduces bits that don ' t very clearly fit . He can strut his blue collar , as in his mockery of a young academic who &quot; pranced before us reading some sprightly little paper for ' Notes and Queries. ' &quot; He prefers bowling , he lets us know . His wandering method works perfectly , though , in his portrait of his mother . She lived_in Europe for a while , worked for years and in near-poverty in Detroit to raise her children and , when they were grown , skipped to California . Philip visits her when she is 80 ; she is sardonic and free . She shows an odd familiarity with the Italian poet Gabriele d ' Annunzio -- Levine pauses to wonder if he could be his father -- and translates one of his poems for him . &quot; It ' s a lot worse than it sounds , &quot; she assures him . &quot; It loses a lot in the original. &quot; Truly , a poet ' s mother . After sketching a mannered professor who taught him James Joyce at college , Levine touches upon various aspects of_his_own life and his growing sense of_aging . Suddenly the professor is back , no longer caricatured but a contemporary in Levine ' s own autumnal process . The professor ends his course with Joyce ' s injunction that a reader should spend a lifetime reading what it took him , Joyce , a lifetime to write . &quot; I am that reader , &quot; Professor Prescott tells his departing students , &quot; and I can tell you that it was a wasted life. &quot; The three best pieces are about Levine ' s poetic mentors . He portrays John Berryman as a man stretched past his own long gawkiness in his passion to impart what poetry must be . His voice went so high that &quot; it seemed that only a dog could hear it. &quot; His class was a battlefield ; Berryman would tear the poems apart or praise them ; either way , the students were goaded to make them better . &quot; Levine , this will never do , &quot; still rings in the writer ' s ears , along with , &quot; One must be ruthless with one ' s own writing or someone else will &quot; and -- when one student turned_in a magnificent sonnet -- &quot; Say that better in 1 # 000 words and you ' re a genius. &quot; Levine ' s young passion for the Spanish Republic led him to spend a sabbatical , years later , in Barcelona . He evokes the mid- ' 60s when the Franco regime still oppressed , but with a shaky hand . There is a wonderful encounter with two members of the once-feared Guardia Civil taking refuge from the rain in a bar . One of them showed Levine a cork stuck_in the muzzle of his carbine to keep the water out , and launched into a sardonic political skit : &quot; This is what they have given me to defend the sacred shores of Spain from the communist fleet . I haven ' t a chance . The string on the cork is broken ; one_shot and I ' m through. &quot; Out of his sketch comes the shadowy figure of Antonio Machado , modern Spain ' s greatest poet . Levine takes Spanish lessons from a young poet ; he in turn introduces his pupil to Machado ' s grave , seemingly plain and magically haunted work . It has all but defied translation . Levine ' s efforts to translate a poem , and his irritation over a set of translations by Robert Bly , produce a comically frank image of a poet ' s work and prickles . Finally there is a beautiful tribute -- virtually a prose_poem -- to Machado ' s spiritual oneness with the gaunt landscape of Castille . Levine calls it &quot; soul &quot; and his writing strips the word of millennia of lofty and sentimental associations and delivers it plain . It is also the key_word in his portrait of Ivor Winters . Freed from factory work by a fellowship to Stanford , Levine spent a year studying with the bristly and resolutely unfashionable poet and critic . In almost every respect they were opposites . Levine was young and new ; Winters was old and even his contemporaries considered him a stylistic reactionary . Levine depicts a man whose passionate attachment to what he considered real poetry -- he insisted that an obscure Georgian poet , T . Sturge Moore , was superior to Yeats -- had isolated him both aesthetically and personally . Yet Levine manages to let us see what burned beneath the crust . Through long afternoons Winters read old_French and Breton poetry to him , laying_out imagery , metrics , etymology . In the passion for craft it recalled Berryman ; and in another way it recalled Machado . &quot; Philip , &quot; Winters told him once , &quot; we must never lie or we shall lose our soul .</TEXT>
