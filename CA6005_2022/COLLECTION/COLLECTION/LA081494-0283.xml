   <TEXT> Money once was rarely a problem for Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center , the prestigious Westside hospital that has catered to Saudi princesses , Hollywood stars and the city ' s affluent . Relying_on its reputation for first-rate care , the largest private hospital in the West could charge top dollar and count_on insurers to pay the bills . When it wanted a new building or a new wing , Cedars could call_upon Southern California ' s rich and powerful -- names such_as Spielberg and Sinatra -- to help raise millions . But today , Cedars -- a half-billion-dollar-a-year business -- is barely profitable . About a quarter of its 850 private rooms are empty on average . It has laid_off hundreds of workers , shut_down some patient wings and cut programs . An ambitious plan to expand the hospital by 50 % has been put_on hold , seen as outdated and too costly . The problems are largely a consequence of the managed health_care revolution taking_place even before President Clinton and Congress strike a deal on national health_care reform . Cedars ' efforts to respond to the changes have met with great resistance from many among its 2 # 300 physicians -- a cleavage that some doctors liken to a civil_war . The hospital and a key group of doctors have squared_off in a bitter lawsuit . Doctors spurned the hospital ' s recommendation for a new chief_of_staff . And hundreds of worried physicians have joined various groups that eventually could redirect patients to rival hospitals . Across the nation , insurers -- at the urging of employers , who pay most medical_bills -- are taking dramatic steps to rein_in medical spending . Health_maintenance_organizations and other managed-care firms are sharply reducing the time people stay in hospitals -- or averting hospital stays altogether by sending people to outpatient clinics , where surgery can be performed as safely and more cheaply . From hospitals and doctors , they are demanding deep discounts . The changes are striking hardest at elite teaching hospitals such_as Cedars , a training site for the UCLA School_of_Medicine . Although the teaching and research such hospitals perform make them valuable to the community , they also render them expensive and inefficient . Faced with shrinking revenues , such hospitals must find a way to respond to market pressures while maintaining the quality care that draws patients and assures their prestige . Cedars , one top doctor there has warned , faces the kind of calamity that has rocked hidebound IBM and General Motors if it fails to change . So Cedars is struggling , painfully , to do nothing less than reinvent itself . &quot; The transition period is very turbulent , very tough , because you ' re giving_up old ways of thinking , &quot; said Thomas Priselac , Cedars ' chief_executive_officer . The marketplace , said Berkeley health_care consultant Peter Boland , &quot; is forcing tremendous consolidation and the largest hospitals in metropolitan areas will have to radically downsize and refocus . Academic health centers are not immune . There ' s going_to be a lot of bloodshed before this is settled. &quot; More is at stake than Cedars ' institutional pride in being a world-class facility . Some doctors fear that managed care may jeopardize the hospital ' s standards . But hospital officials insist that quality will not be sacrificed -- and may improve -- as the changes unfold . Dr. John Block , president of The Johns Hopkins Hospital , worries that the spread of managed care will result in teaching hospitals losing their medical edge . &quot; Hospitals like Cedars or Johns Hopkins that have a sophisticated capacity to deal with the very sick will be functioning in a system where everyone involved will have a profound economic incentive not to use them , and that ' s just not good for health_care , &quot; Block said . Johns Hopkins is among dozens of elite teaching hospitals -- including UCLA School_of_Medicine , Stanford Medical_Center and Massachusetts General Hospital -- wrestling with similar concerns . Mass General stunned Boston ' s medical_community this year by agreeing to merge with longtime rival Brigham and Women ' s Hospital to create the nation ' s biggest hospital . The steps proposed by Cedars ' management are less dramatic . They want the hospital to slim_down . But more important , they say , Cedars must be reorganized to increase its clout in the managed-care environment . Like most teaching facilities , the hospital -- which sprawls over eight city_blocks -- has a large staff top-heavy with well-paid specialists , lots of costly , high-tech equipment and a sluggish bureaucracy . &quot; Cedars has not been one of the most cost-effective hospitals , &quot; said the chief_executive of a major Southern California health_maintenance_organization who asked not to be identified . &quot; They ' ve catered to attracting high-quality specialists and told them : ' we ' ll do whatever you want . You can have any equipment , any service , any nursing ratio you want. ' Given that dynamic , it ' s hard to manage your costs effectively. &quot; In the past year , Cedars has slashed $ 50 million from its $ 570-million budget , reduced its staff by 700 , to 6 # 500 employees , and closed two patient wings . Cedars ' board of directors has considered -- but rejected -- other efficiency measures , including a significant reduction in its teaching and research activities . Such a move would likely be highly unpopular with the hospital ' s powerful physician-researchers , doctors say . Described by one industry consultant as a &quot; loss_leader &quot; for Cedars , some experts say the hospital ' s teaching and research efforts hamper its ability to compete in a managed-care era . Beyond cutting costs , Cedars is also trying to form closer alliances with its doctors and with other health_care_providers -- including hospitals and HMOs . It wants to create a &quot; physician-hospital organization &quot; whose main purpose would be capturing managed-care contracts . The complicated plan would make the hospitals and doctors equal partners -- a much closer relationship than in the past . It would also mean they would share more of the financial risk of providing care , which insurers increasingly are passing_on to providers . Cedars also wants to expand its outpatient facilities and branch_out into in-home and long-term care . &quot; The driving forces for what we are doing are the same things that are affecting the entire industry -- principally the pressure to provide as high a quality service as you can at the lowest possible cost , &quot; said Priselac , a 15-year veteran of Cedars who was promoted to the top job in January after the resignation of Sheldon King , now an executive with Salick Health_Care , a Los Angeles-based operator of cancer treatment centers . Personable and pragmatic , Priselac , who at 43 is one of the youngest executives running a major U.S. hospital , will try to steer Cedars through one of its most turbulent periods in a job he said is &quot; as difficult as anything I ' ve had to deal with in 20 years. &quot; One of Priselac ' s more delicate tasks : prepping the hospital for managed care while preserving the upscale image that has enabled Cedars to attract substantial support from the city ' s glitterati . While uniformed valets park patients ' cars , management exhorts doctors on the staff to become &quot; more like Kaiser , &quot; the pioneering HMO that has thrived with no-frills , quality care . It is a tricky balance . Few hospitals enjoy the kind of community support that Cedars does . Its &quot; Campaign for the 21st Century &quot; fund has collected more_than $ 70 million in donations in two years . The support is also evident in the hospital ' s collection of ( donated ) art , which includes works by Picasso , Lichtenstein and Hockney . Cedars says the 8 # 000 pieces represent the largest private collection of modern art that is not in a museum . A Robert Rauschenberg lithograph hangs just outside the coffee_shop . Cedars ' gilded image has , over the years , been carefully polished by its marketing staff . Ron Wise , the lanky vice_president and chief publicist , has Kirk Douglas in his Rolodex ; the actor and his wife , Anne Davis , are honorary chairs of Cedars ' fund-raising_drive . Wise appears frequently in the media , giving health updates on celebrities admitted to Cedars -- he was called to the hospital at 5 a.m. Thursday to handle media calls regarding O.J. Simpson ' s surgery . Sometimes he announces celebrity deaths . Lucille Ball , Danny Thomas , Sammy Cahn and River Phoenix are among those who spent their last hours at the hospital . ( Though Cedars does attract a healthy share of well-heeled clients to its hotel-like , eighth-floor VIP rooms , most of its patients are ordinary folks . The hospital also spent $ 14.2 million last year in providing uncompensated care_for patients who lacked insurance. ) Cedars can also boast of solid medical achievements . It consistently ranks high among the top hospitals in U.S. News &amp; World Report ' s annual surveys . In the most recent ranking of hospitals that deliver sophisticated care to the sickest patients , Cedars placed among the top in three of 16 medical specialties , down from six in 1993 . UCLA School_of_Medicine , with which Cedars shares training of UCLA medical_students , was among the magazine ' s &quot; Best of the Best , &quot; achieving high rankings in 12 specialties . In 1992 , Cedars doctors were the first to use a pig ' s liver to sustain a woman while a human organ was found . Unfortunately , the patient died during the wait , but the technique helped lead to a so-called &quot; bio-artificial &quot; liver , which includes pig cells and fibers that mimic a human liver . Cedars ' efforts gave doctors techniques to use while they wait for human organs . The excimer laser , now used worldwide for non-invasive surgical_procedures , was pioneered by Cedars doctors in the 1980s . Cedars ' efforts to trim costs without shortchanging quality can be seen in 7 Northeast , the seventh-floor orthopedic wing . Here the hospital is testing &quot; patient-focused care , &quot; a concept catching_on at such prestigious medical facilities as Yale-New Haven Hospital and Stanford Medical_Center . Geraldine Popolow , a vice_president in_charge of patient care , said a Cedars study showed that a cardiac patient may see as_many as 105 hospital workers during a weeklong stay . that ' s not only inefficient , but can be disconcerting to patients who see a string of unfamiliar faces passing_through their rooms to deliver food or transport them to the radiology lab . The hospital wants to slash the figure to about 40 workers . So Cedars is cross-training its nurses , clinical technicians and other support staff to handle more tasks and it is forming teams to care_for small groups of patients . Desktop_computers are placed outside each &quot; quad &quot; of four hospital_rooms , allowing nurses to look_up medical_records without walking to the main nursing station . &quot; The person who draws your blood can also take your cardiogram , make your bed or bring you a glass of water , &quot; Popolow said . &quot; It ' s not appropriate for anyone to say , ' This is not my job. ' &quot; The program , which Cedars wants to expand hospital-wide , should cut costs about 5 % , officials said . Another cost-reduction move : The hospital got its orthopedic surgeons to agree on a single company to supply prosthetic_devices such_as artificial hips , saving $ 400 # 000 last year . For Cedars management , getting that agreement was easy compared to selling more fundamental changes to its reluctant doctors . Managed care is bitter medicine for many doctors -- particularly specialists already facing sharp drops_in income . Many see it as a threat to the level of care they are accustomed to providing their patients , to their autonomy and to their financial survival . The intensity of the internal debate was evident when hundreds of physicians gathered_in December at the Wilshire Ebell Theater to discuss the hospital ' s plans . Supporters of Cedars ' proposed physician-hospital organization argued that the hospital must get its act together or lose patients to more efficient competitors like Kaiser . &quot; Without this ( physician-hospital organization ) functioning well , &quot; one of the doctors said in support of the plan , &quot; the hospital is dead. &quot; Many other doctors remained unconvinced . The plan has stirred tensions dating_back to Cedars ' first foray_into managed care . In 1985 , the hospital backed the formation of a medical group known as the Cedars-Sinai Physicians Assn . The hospital wanted to place thousands of hospital employees in a lower-cost HMO plan that would utilize Cedars doctors . The group initially was managed by the hospital and relegated to a tiny basement office . Many Cedars physicians detested the idea . &quot; We were looked_at as radicals , as people who were going_to destroy medicine , &quot; recalled Dr. Seymour Levine , a founder of the group . At the time , he said , many doctors figured that a prestigious place such_as Cedars need not be concerned about the managed care movement that was gaining momentum in California . Some physicians who joined got blunt warnings from colleagues : Quit the group or you ' ll get no more patient referrals . After a_few years , the medical group , unhappy with Cedars ' handling of its affairs , essentially fired the hospital as its manager . In 1992 , the hospital sued the medical group it had created , naming Levine as a defendant . The physician group later countersued . The lawsuit is pending , though some issues have been resolved . The hospital got Levine ' s group to drop &quot; Cedars-Sinai &quot; from its name ; it recently was renamed Health Source Medical Group . But the hospital lost something as well . Health Source , which oversees care_for 65 # 000 HMO members -- a large block of patients the hospital doesn ' t want to lose -- no longer admits its members exclusively to Cedars . It is sending more patients to other Westside hospitals , including Midway Hospital about a mile from Cedars , where costs are lower . Priselac calls the suit &quot; sadly unavoidable &quot; ; both sides say they are trying to resolve their dispute . That the bitterness lingers was evident this year when Cedars ' medical staff broke a two-decade precedent by refusing to reelect Dr. Burton Fink -- the hospital ' s recommended candidate -- as chief_of_staff . The hospital refused for several weeks to disclose the results of the election to either the staff or Dr. Stephen J . Uman , the internist who defeated Fink . Uman has encouraged doctors to accept the inevitability of managed care . &quot; It doesn ' t matter whether this change is ' fair ' or in the best interest of our patients ( and these issues are debatable ) , &quot; Uman wrote in a letter to doctors in April . &quot; To ignore the change coming will place you in the position of IBM or General Motors , which ignored changes in their businesses and suffered as a consequence. &quot; While 750 doctors have sought membership in Cedars ' new physician-hospital organization , other Cedars doctors -- many of them unhappy with the hospital ' s plan -- have formed rival medical groups that may compete with Cedars for managed care contracts . Dr. William Young has organized the 65 African American doctors on Cedars ' staff into a group called the Physician Integrated Health Network , saying that black doctors have little voice in the hospital ' s leadership . Noting that about 22 % of patients admitted to Cedars are African Americans , he said : &quot; Clearly we are not represented ( in similar numbers ) on the physician staff or in the administrative structure of the hospital. &quot; The lack of unity among Cedars doctors could prove a detriment to the hospital , said Dr. Barry Rosenbloom , a leader of the new physician-hospital group . &quot; With the doctors being split , the insurers or employers could use one faction against the other to negotiate lower rates , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' ve sent_out the olive_branch to all_of the groups , &quot; Rosenbloom said , &quot; but people are still wary. &quot; Dr. Leon Bender , a urologist and former chief_of_staff at Cedars , is among the skeptical doctors . He does not accept HMO contracts now , but figures that soon he will not be able to turn_away such business . &quot; The patients are directing us to act , &quot; he said . &quot; I can ' t shut my eyes to the market forces_out there. &quot; Dr. Ronald Bronow , meanwhile , stands steadfast against managed care . HMOs , Bronow said , are &quot; revolving-door medicine that tries to get the patients out the door as quickly as possible . The whole idea to me is completely revolting. &quot; But Cedars officials dispute such claims . Irving Feintech , chairman of Cedars ' board of directors , said in a statement that the hospital &quot; will not , now , or ever , compromise on quality. &quot; And Priselac said : &quot; Just as we set the gold_standard in many respects . . . under the old system , we are setting_out to make_sure the public knows they can get Cedars-Sinai level of quality care in a managed-care environment. &quot; BACKGROUND Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center , a nonprofit , nondenominational private hospital , was formed in 1961 through the merger of Cedars_of_Lebanon Hospital and Mt . Sinai Hospital . Cedars_of_Lebanon was founded as Kaspare Cohn Hospital in 1902 , an eight-bed home for Jewish tubercular patients . Mt . Sinai was founded in 1921 as a six-bed facility for needy patients during an influenza epidemic . In 1976 , after completion of a $ 100-million addition , Cedars-Sinai consolidated its operations at a single , 1 # 120-bed hospital on Beverly Boulevard . Wrenching Changes for Cedars-Sinai Over the last decade , the annual number of patients admitted to Cedars-Sinai has been fairly stable . But cost-cutting pressures from HMOs and other managed care firms -- as well as new medical technology and drug treatments -- have substantially reduced lengths of hospitalstays and left hundreds of rooms vacant on the typical day . Admissions have been steady... Total admissions : 1984 * : 36 # 171 1994 * : 39 # 307 ...but the total number of days patients spend in the hospital has tumbled... Number of patient days : 1984 * : 261 # 058 1994 * : 228 # 248 ...as the average length of stay has shrunk . Length of stay ( days ) : 1984 * : 7.22 1994 * : 5.81 The result : Average daily occupany in the hospital is down dramatically . Avg . daily occupancy : 1984 * : 713 1994 * : 625 * Years ending March 31 Source : Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center</TEXT>
