   <HEADLINE> AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE : A TIME FOR SONGS , FOR JOY , FOR SORROW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the lights dimmed and the curtain rose , the passion of Zlata Lyashkevich at the piano filled the room with the music of Moshe and Rose Gershovitz ' s boy . The music was a fitting overture to a program dedicated to Russian Jewish artists and writers killed under Josef Stalin ' s dictatorship , as it was composed by this son of Russian Jewish immigrants -- Jacob Gershovitz . We know him as George Gershwin . The music : &quot; Rhapsody in Blue. &quot; Many in this audience of about 250 were white-haired ; they had lived_in Stalin ' s Russia . For them , this Sunday afternoon gathering at the Westside Jewish Community_Center was at once joyous and sorrowful . Among them was Vera Pauker , who came_to America in 1980 . Pauker , who ' s on staff at the center , dreams of a Russian theater in Los Angeles . &quot; There are so many Russian Jewish singers and actors here , and they cannot find any work. &quot; They include pianist Lyashkevich and bass Yuri Edelman , both 51 , an artistic team for six years . They came from Moscow nine months ago . Lyashkevich , a graduate of Moscow Conservatory , teaches part time at California State University , Los Angeles , and plays_at an Italian restaurant in Glendale . Edelman , who sang with the Moscow Philharmonic and in concerts and opera throughout Eastern Europe , is working as a carpenter . Still , Lyashkevich says , in Russia things are far worse . &quot; The artist ' s life is very hard now because of politics , the economy . Nobody goes_to concerts . There is no money for tickets . We are not needed in our country. &quot; Nor , despite their considerable talents , is it any picnic here , where their names are not household words and English does not come easily to them . There is Arta Shess , 55 , an Armenian , who arrived in 1992 . A powerful baritone who sang major opera roles throughout Eastern Europe , he now is relegated largely to singing at venues such_as senior-citizen centers . For this audience , his songs needed no introduction . He sang first in Yiddish , about a rabbi . Then he sang Eli , Eli , a Hebrew prayer , throwing kisses to an audience that lured him back with a cadence of clapping . Although he can sing in English , he says , &quot; I have wonderful voice , but nobody knows me here. &quot; Edelman wishes that there was more call_for a Russian-born singer with limited English . He will tell you that he is very happy to be in America and he is optimistic . His attitude seemed to echo the theme for the day , Nit Gedeiget , Yiddish for &quot; Cheer_up -- don ' t worry. &quot; But the stage backdrop , a sort of mask of tragedy , was a grim reminder of the obliteration of Jewish culture and tradition in Russia during the ' 30s and ' 40s . In Russian , narrator Ana Feldman , a former Moscow University professor , told the story of Solomon Mikhoels , creator of the Yiddish State Theater in Moscow in the ' 20s and its director until he died in 1948 . The official line : The actor , an activist who also headed the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee , died in a car accident . Many Jews , however , think he was murdered by the Soviet secret_police . Now , 46 years later , he was present in spirit on a scratchy recording from his most famous role , &quot; King Lear. &quot; &quot; Our future is in the hands of our children , &quot; says Feldman , who then brought_on seven boys and girls in blue and white -- the colors of Israel -- to perform a dance , L ' Chaim ( &quot; To Life &quot; ) . Still , none in this hall had forgotten the past . Feldman spoke with passion of the Soviet purges of the ' 40s , the arrests on trumped-up charges of hundreds of the Jewish cultural elite . &quot; Every night people were expecting someone to come and arrest them. &quot; On Aug . 12 , 1952 , after secret trials , 24 Jews , among them poet Perets Markish and children ' s writer Lev Kvitko , were executed . This concert was for remembering them , too . In his booming bass , Edelman , accompanied by Lyashkevich , sang in Yiddish about the search for peace and love and the good life . At the end , children brought flowers up_to the artists , who led audience members -- now on their feet -- in singing , in Hebrew , Shalom Alechem . Peace to you . This program , with English interpretation , will be presented again at 2 p.m. March 20 at Westside Jewish Community_Center , 5870 W . Olympic Blvd . One Good_Turn Deserves Another On Aug . 11 , 1992 , Darlene Theakston and Marcus Magee -- his kidneys were deteriorating as a result of childhood-onset diabetes -- checked_into St . Vincent ' s Hospital . They checked_out a week later , with one of her kidneys at_work in his body . &quot; It was a miracle , &quot; says Magee , 30 . He had hoped this would be an engagement of sorts , an unbreakable bond . But , alas , the romance fizzled . They remain good friends . Recently , Theakston , a 27-year-old jobless legal secretary -- and about 40 # 000 others -- entered a drawing at the tribal-run Casino Morongo near Palm Springs . Guess who walked_off with the expenses-paid trip for two to anywhere in the world -- plus $ 2 # 000 mad money ? Considering that two years earlier doctors had told her there was only a one-in-a-million chance that her kidney would be a match for Magee , Theakston has to wonder if she has &quot; a direct line with God all_of a sudden. &quot; Some would simply argue that one good deed deserves another . In mid-April , Theakston , who lives_in Santa Monica , will fulfill a dream when she and Julie Jackson of Rancho Cucamonga travel_to Egypt and Israel . She ' s feeling just fine . &quot; I am missing a rib , &quot; she says , referring to the one surgeons removed to get_to that kidney . The rib is in a jar in her closet . This weekly column chronicles the people and small moments that define life in Southern California . Reader suggestions are welcome .</TEXT>
