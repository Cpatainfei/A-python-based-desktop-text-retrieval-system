   <HEADLINE> MARKET FOCUS ; CANADA DIGS DEEP TO PROP_UP OIL DRILLING PLATFORM ; HIBERNIA PROJECT EMPLOYS 4 # 000 IN NEWFOUNDLAND . SOME ANALYSTS ARE SKEPTICAL THE GOVERNMENT WILL RECOVER ITS INVESTMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For at least as long as such things have been written_down , the people of Newfoundland have earned their livelihood from the turbulent waters of the North Atlantic . They have drawn fish from the sea and they have processed them in small factories in the coastal villages of their island . They have repaired the boats that carried the fishermen and they have welcomed to their port the ships of others from around the world . Now , they are looking_to the ocean for a new resource -- oil . On a fog-cloaked construction site cut from the wilderness , more_than 4 # 000 workers , mainly Newfoundlanders , are building an offshore drilling_platform large enough and strong enough to withstand not only the pounding storms of the North Atlantic , but the occasional iceberg . When it is finished , in 1997 if the schedule holds , the platform will be towed about 200 miles out_to sea to the Hibernia oil field . There it will be installed on the ocean_floor and begin pumping . By the turn_of_the_century , the Hibernia field should account_for about 12 % of Canada ' s conventional oil_production , according to the consortium building the rig . If the adjacent Terra Nova offshore field comes_on line , Newfoundland ' s waters could be providing as much as a quarter of the country ' s oil output . The project -- projected to cost nearly $ 11.7 billion to build and operate over 20 years -- is as risky and controversial as it is ambitious : * No one ever has built an offshore platform to withstand ramming by an iceberg . This presented an engineering challenge that was researched at one point by landing a small plane on an iceberg and drilling to test for density . * There was no facility in Newfoundland that could be adapted for such a construction project , so the consortium cleared 4 # 000 acres of forest and bogland along a deep-water cove near the town of Come By Chance . Here , it built a factory for building the platform and a town for the workers . The site will be turned_over to the province for $ 1 when the platform is completed , in the hope that the expertise gained in the Hibernia project will lay the groundwork for an offshore industry here . This project is under way in a Newfoundland sunk_in economic despair . The Northern cod that were the mainstay of the fisheries have virtually disappeared , and many other fish stocks are so damaged that fishing quotas have plunged . In July , the official unemployment_rate was 21.1 % . Mindful of the need for economic diversification , the Canadian government of former Prime_Minister Brian Mulroney took the unusual step of propping_up the Hibernia project with $ 1.24 billion in loan guarantees and a direct investment amounting to 8.5 % ownership . The new Liberal government of Prime_Minister Jean Chretien has stuck_by the project . One of the original partners , Gulf Canada , pulled_out in 1992 , delaying the completion date by a year . Construction costs also have risen more_than $ 875 million over budget , although the owners say that has been more_than offset by reductions in projected operating_costs attributed to improved technology . Despite estimates by the ownership consortium that the project has a break-even point at $ 13.65 a barrel over the 20-year drilling cycle , some analysts are skeptical it will ever recover its investment . This has led to snide comments about Hibernia being the biggest make-work project in history . Oil_company officials wave aside such complaints and say they would n ' t be involved in a money loser . &quot; Oil_companies don ' t get involved in make-work projects or social development programs . They ' re in it to make money , &quot; said Bill Simpkins , the Hibernia project ' s manager of government relations and public affairs . Ownership of Hibernia is divided among Mobil Oil ( 33.125 % ) , Chevron ( 26.875 % ) , Petro-Canada ( 25 % ) and Murphy Atlantic ( 6.5 % ) , in addition to the Canadian government . Rick Bates , a Mobil executive from New Jersey who is general_manager of the project , says the engineering on the project is essentially an adaptation of technology developed for 18 similar platforms in the North_Sea . The major difference is the reinforcement needed for protection from multimillion-ton icebergs . The concrete and steel base of the drilling_rig , called the gravity-based structure , has been designed with 16 &quot; teeth &quot; intended to ward_off icebergs and protect the platform ' s inner walls . The steel reinforcement of the concrete , called rebar , will be heavier than in the North_Sea platforms . The structure will be 295 feet tall , with a storage capacity of about 1.3 million barrels of oil . Four columns , housing the drills and other equipment , will run_through the platform base and support seven topside modules , derricks , lifeboat stations , a helipad and a boom to burn_off excess gas . The structure will have a living capacity of 280 workers , although the typical population will be about 250 once pumping starts . When completed , attached_to the ocean_floor and filled with ballast , the entire structure will weigh about 1.2 million tons . Construction of the structure is under way in a man-made dry-dock here . Once the outer wall of the structure reaches 59 feet in_height in October , the dry-dock will be flooded and the partially completed gravity-based structure will be towed to a deep-water site just offshore and held_in place with huge mooring chains . There construction will be completed . Work_on the topside structures is under way here and in South_Korea and Italy . If all goes as scheduled , the completed rig should be ready to be floated to the drilling site in June , 1997 . Because of the weather in the North Atlantic , there is only a two-month window for the tow-out . If the window is missed , oil_production will be delayed a year . The thousands of workers building the Hibernia project will , of course , lose their jobs when it is complete . The theory behind the partial government funding of the project is that it will provide the infrastructure for future development of offshore oil or another industry . &quot; Hibernia is really the ground-breaker , &quot; said Ken Hull , president of the Hibernia Management and Development Co. , the firm formed by the consortium to run the project . Hull notes estimates of more_than 600 million barrels of extractable oil in the Hibernia field , and there may be more nearby . While Hibernia may be an engineering marvel and at least a short-term job creator , there are considerable doubts around the nation about the wisdom of the government stake in the plan . Why invest in such a risky , politically driven project when Canada has one of the highest public_debts , as a percentage of domestic national product , in the industrial world , many ask . In August , as if to underline those doubts , the Canadian and Alberta governments sold at a $ 730-million loss their interest in a heavy oil upgrader project on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border . Although the government is sticking_with the Hibernia project , Natural_Resources Minister Anne McLellan has said there will be no repeats . Probably the most vocal Hibernia critic is Ian Doig of Calgary , publisher of an oil and gas newsletter called Doig ' s Digest . Doig argues that government involvement in the project -- to ensure that the bulk of the work is done_in Newfoundland -- has artificially driven_up costs . Paul Ziff , president of the Ziff Energy Group , a Calgary consulting_firm , said Canada has experienced both success and failure with government-assisted energy projects , but he notes the inherent unpredictability of the Hibernia project . &quot; Whenever you have a new technology , you get surprises , and they ' re not usually pleasant , &quot; Ziff said . THE BUILDING OF HIBERNIA In order to tap into the resources of the North Atlantic , workers in Newfoundland are building an offshore oil platform that can take the pounding storms of the North Atlantic , as well as crushing blows from multimillion-ton icebergs . The concrete and steel structure making this possible is called the gravity-based structure , or GBS . * The Hibernia Oil Project The GBS is a concrete pedestal that sits on the ocean_floor , with 16 &quot; teeth &quot; in its exterior wall to absorb the impacts of icebergs . The following diagrams show some of the steps_in putting the Hibernia oil platform over the drill_site . * Topsides Moved Out Once the &quot; topsides , &quot; or drilling and production facilities , are completed , they are towed out_to the GBS . * Topsides Mated to GBS The topsides are then attached_to the GBS , and the whole structure is moved to the final drilling site . * At the Drill_Site The oil platform is positioned over the drilling site , and the GBS interior is filled , bringing the GBS base to rest_on the ocean_floor . * The Hibernia Drill_Site The Hibernia oil fields are about 200 miles offshore from St . John ' s , Newfoundland . * Oil_Production Oil_companies hope to extract more_than 600 million barrels from the Hibernia fields . * Protecting the Oil Platform There are 16 &quot; teeth &quot; that make_up the outer ice wall , which are designed to protect the inner platform from large icebergs . * Oil Storage The interior of the GBS can hold_up to 1.3 million barrels of crude_oil . * The Hibernia Platform Topsides facilities : The topsides contain all drilling , crude_oil processing service and utility requirements for the platform , as well as housing for 280 people .</TEXT>
