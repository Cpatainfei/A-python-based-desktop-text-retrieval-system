   <HEADLINE> THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE ; THE ECONOMY ; IDEA FILE : THE BIG EXPORT PUSH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How It Works Government aids would-be exporters through a combination of information , technical assistance and financial_support . Public-private efforts to enhance the transportation infrastructure , such_as the proposed Alameda Corridor , should proceed . Benefits Exports are considered a major area of future growth for the local and national economies and create jobs by drawing money from overseas . Short-Term or Long-Term Impact ? Some export financing already exists through the government , such_as the state ' s Export Finance office . But experts believe that perhaps 75 % of potential exporters aren ' t even aware of opportunities . Already , international trade -- imports and exports -- helps support some 800 # 000 jobs in Southern California , estimates Richard Davis of the California Trade and Commerce Agency . Supporters Most international economists and entrepreneurs embrace such a priority . They argue it is essential to promote Southern California ' s position as a trade center , especially with nations in the Pacific and Asia . Opponents Some politicians and business_executives argue that export aid wastes government money , because Southern California exports are growing in response to market forces . The Costs The state already spends about $ 3 million annually on export-financing guarantees , information , marketing services and overseas trade promotion . Modest cost increases could focus_on spreading information and know-how . The private sector would bear costs through such proposals as the Alameda Corridor -- a $ 1.8-billion rail and truck route between downtown Los Angeles and the Port of Los Angeles , to be partly financed by per-train user fees . REALITY CHECK Very good chances . Many government officials and entrepreneurs are enthusiastic about exports as a growth area .</TEXT>
