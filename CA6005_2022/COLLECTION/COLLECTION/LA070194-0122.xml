   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : CUP RUNNETH OVER THE BOYS OF SUMMER IN NUMEROUS WAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The international and national pastimes are going head to head on the same soil for the first time , and , in an upset , the national pastime is getting kicked_around a bit . According to numbers released by ESPN this week , its broadcast of the United States-Colombia World Cup match drew a rating of 4.5 -- better than twice the 1.9 share it has been averaging for its prime_time baseball telecasts . How is this possible , you ask ? Oh , I can think_of two or three or 30 reasons . . . . 1 . Soccer has Alexi Lalas , the wild-maned , orange-goateed , rock guitar-playing , cherry Slurpee-swilling , head-banging United States defender who is given to such off-kilter observations as , &quot; We need the culture police in the stands , saying , ' Hey , it ' s culture , leave it alone. ' So what if they ' re sacrificing a goat , let_it_go . It ' s the World Cup. &quot; Baseball has Tom Lawless . 2 . Soccer players are paid huge sums_of_money for their unparalleled skill , agility , stamina , leg strength and mid-air acrobatics . Baseball_players are paid huge sums_of_money . 3 . Soccer players run virtually non-stop for 90 minutes amid searing on-field temperatures that sometimes reach 120 degrees . Baseball_players beat_out an infield grounder and complain that there ' s no beer in the clubhouse . 4 . With two 45-minute halves , a 15-minute intermission and two to five minutes of &quot; injury time , &quot; most soccer games clock_in under two hours . After two hours , most baseball_games aren ' t out of the fifth inning . 5 . Soccer players play the ball off their shins , thighs , ankles , knees , chests , hips , shoulders and heads . When he plays left field for the Phillies , so does Pete Incaviglia . 6 . After soccer games , fans light fireworks and throw them in the air . After baseball_games , players light fireworks and throw them at the fans . 7 . When someone scores a goal on a Univision World Cup telecast , Andres Cantor notes the event with a frenzied , passionate , up-from-the-diaphragm exhortation of &quot; GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL ! &quot; Baseball hasn ' t heard anything like it since &quot; The Giants win the pennant ! &quot; and that was 43 years ago . 8 . No on-base percentage , slugging percentage , total average , total bases , quality starts , at-bats-per-home run ratio , at- bats- per- bench- clearing- brawl ratio and national- anthem- sung- on- artificial- turf- with- the- wind- blowing- out efficiency in soccer . Just goals . 9 . That bicycle kick Marcelo Balboa almost put_in against Colombia ? Let ' s see Kent Hrbek try it . 10 . In Wednesday ' s sports action , the Oakland Athletics defeated the California Angels , 1-0 , and the_Netherlands defeated Morocco , 2-1 . Too many 1-0 games in baseball . 11 . Marge Schott doesn ' t own a soccer team . 12 . Under baseball ' s drug-abuse policy , Diego Maradona would have six more chances . 13 . No Bebeto trading_cards on the Home Shopping Network . 14 . A Russian scoring five goals in a World Cup match against Cameroon is like Rex Hudler hitting five grand_slams in Game 3 of the World_Series . The difference is that in soccer , these things do happen . 15 . A corner_kick in soccer is a suspenseful and exciting event , often resulting in the ball being headed toward the net in an impossible angle and the goalkeeper leaping_out of his socks to try to thwart it . A corner_kick in baseball means Dean Palmer has booted another one . 16 . In soccer ' s &quot; Group of Death , &quot; Italy , Ireland , Mexico and Norway all finished with . 500 records . In baseball ' s &quot; Group of Death , &quot; the Rangers , Mariners , A ' s and Angels should be so lucky . 17 . When soccer players grab their crotches in public -- bracing for a free_kick that will send the ball screaming toward their midsections at 90 to 100 miles per hour -- they do so for a very good reason . 18 . George Will doesn ' t write_about soccer . 19 . Tony Meola , smart Jersey kid , was drafted by the New York Yankees , but decided he ' d rather play for the World Cup Yankees . 20 . In soccer , Bora is a coach . In baseball , Bora is an often-used descriptive term for the game in_progress . 21 . One-named soccer players such_as Romario and Bebeto have an almost mystical , mythical air about them . If baseball tried the same thing , we ' d be left with Chuck , Hal , Phil , George and Fred . 22 . No rotisserie soccer leagues . Yet . 23 . Group play in the World Cup -- where four teams play for two weeks to eliminate the weak sisters before moving onto the second round -- is a great idea baseball should adopt . If baseball had group play , the Angels would be in Trinidad today , trying to qualify for 1995 . 24 . International soccer writers have the right idea : Don ' t bother with postgame quotes , just rip away from atop the ivory_tower . American baseball writers , meanwhile , waste the best years of their adult lives waiting alongside rank locker stalls so they fill their game reports with such pithy observations as &quot; I was just looking_for something to hit &quot; and &quot; I been throwing a whole_lot better since Marcel changed my arm angle. &quot; 25 . In soccer , the Old_Boys Club is a professional team in Argentina . In baseball , it ' s the managerial pool . 26 . In soccer , players can ' t handle the ball with their hands . In baseball , neither can Jose Offerman . 27 . At a Netherlands World Cup game , you can hear the fans humming the triumphal march of &quot; Aida. &quot; At an Ireland World Cup game , you can hear the fans_belting out the timeless standard &quot; Molly Malone. &quot; At a Minnesota Twins game , you can hear the fans singing along to John Denver ' s &quot; Thank God I ' m A Country Boy. &quot; 28 . Soccer uniforms are cooler than baseball uniforms . That traffic-pylon-in-a-paint-fight number worn by Mexican goalie Jorge Campos has the Houston Astros eating their hearts out . 29 . No one in baseball can tailgate like the Brazilians . 30 . In soccer and baseball , strikers are expected to dominate the headlines this summer . Only in soccer , this is considered a good thing .</TEXT>
