   <HEADLINE> STATE FAULTS DEVELOPER ' S PLAN TO PROTECT SITE OF RARE WETLAND ; MOORPARK : WILDLIFE OFFICIALS CONTEND THAT THE SAFEGUARDS IN THE 550-HOME PROJECT ' S IMPACT REPORT ARE INADEQUATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A developer ' s plan to build 550 homes_in southeast Moorpark fails to adequately protect a rare wetland , state wildlife officials said Wednesday , adding that they may challenge the project when it goes before city officials . Mary Meyer , a plant ecologist with the state_Department of Fish and Game , said Carlsberg Financial Corp. ' s housing_development threatens two plants on the state ' s endangered species list . The developer ' s plan to protect the species has been approved by city planners and is scheduled to go before the City_Council on May 6 , but Meyer said the plan as it now reads will not protect the rare species . &quot; We don ' t feel the area would be adequately protected with this plan , &quot; Meyer said . &quot; It ' s an odd situation . The city has taken the view that they know what is best for endangered species even though they have no training in that area. &quot; Fish and Game has asked Carlsberg to set_aside about 50 of the 500 acres in the development . The agency ' s intent is to provide a buffer zone around the seasonal wetland -- called a vernal pool -- and keep the hillsides that provide it with water runoff free_of houses . Carlsberg President Ron Tankersley said the developer ' s plan to set_aside 15 acres and provide a new water source for the wetland is adequate . &quot; We have already provided &quot; for the wetland , Tankersley said . &quot; I don ' t see why they ' re so focused on setting_aside more acres . . . . The development would not be economically feasible if we followed their plan. &quot; Tankersley said the project would divert runoff from houses in the area away from the wetland and keep its seasonal aspect intact . The wetland will be preserved through a new drainage_system that will carry runoff from undeveloped hillsides to the pool in the same amounts it has historically received , Tankersley said . Vernal pools fill with water in the spring and are dry most other times in the year . The seasonal character of the wetland nurtures a unique set of plant and animal species that have evolved to survive the long dry spells , wildlife officials said . The Moorpark vernal pool is home to two endangered plants -- the California Orcutt ' s grass and the Lyon ' s pentachaeta , a yellow-flowered aster . Fish and Game botanists called the area &quot; one of the major botanical finds &quot; in Southern California after the plants were discovered in a survey last year . Attempting to save the wetland and avert a legal confrontation between the two sides , a local environmental organization is searching for public or private money to purchase the vernal pool and the 50 acres around it . In letters sent this week to conservation groups and government_agencies , the Moorpark branch of the Ventura County Environmental Coalition asked_for donations to buy the site . &quot; We thought this would be the best way to protect the area , &quot; said Janet Murphy , vice_president of the organization . &quot; It really needs protection , and we don ' t know if the developer ' s plan to protect the area -- which is experimental , really -- will do the job. &quot; The site , which has a pronounced dark reddish color most of the year and is visible from the Moorpark Freeway near Tierra Rejada Road , is the only wetland within a 120-mile radius to provide habitat for the endangered plants found there , environmentalists say . &quot; I have sympathy for the developers , &quot; said Margaret Koenig , who is_active in the Environmental Coalition . &quot; But this is a unique place we must protect. &quot; City officials say that setting_aside 50 acres is unnecessary and that Carlsberg ' s plan is adequate . If the developers were forced to set_aside all_the acreage recommended by Fish and Game , officials say , it would kill the project , which is expected to earn the developer as much as $ 40 million . &quot; We believe the same amount of water will reach the site &quot; under the developer ' s plan , said Jim Aguilera , Moorpark ' s director of community development . &quot; It will be protected. &quot; The environmental impact report on the project has already received preliminary approval from city planners , Aguilera said . The next step puts it before the Moorpark City_Council for a vote . If the council approves the plan , it would probably be another six to eight months before building_permits could be issued . As for the Environmental Coalition ' s plan , Aguilera said the city would not object to the purchase . He said he was skeptical that the developers would consider an offer unless it fully compensated them not only for the land , but also for the 145 houses that would be built_on that part of the development . The Environmental Coalition proposal &quot; is a shot in the dark , &quot; Aguilera said . &quot; It ' s not a serious offer , so no one has taken the time to make the calculations about just how much it would cost. &quot; Murphy conceded that the group is not sure how much it would cost to purchase the area , but said the proposal is serious . She also hinted that the environmental group might try to block the project unless more of the wetland is preserved . &quot; This is a positive thing , &quot; she said . &quot; It could be a win-win situation , and it will ensure that the wetland is protected without us having to contest the permit . In the long_run , it ' s a lot smoother way for the developer to get what he wants. &quot; For their part , Fish and Game officials said purchasing the property would be a perfect way to protect the plants . But whether money is found to buy the area or not , they said , it must be protected . &quot; We ' re willing to pursue that avenue , but with limited funds and an unwilling seller , there ' s no guarantee a purchase could be made , &quot; Meyer said . &quot; The fact is that this is an extremely uncommon and unique resource that must be protected one way or the other. &quot; Vernal Pool Environmentalists want to buy more_than 50 acre in the 500-acre Carlsberg development to protect a seasonal wetland known as a vernal pool .</TEXT>
