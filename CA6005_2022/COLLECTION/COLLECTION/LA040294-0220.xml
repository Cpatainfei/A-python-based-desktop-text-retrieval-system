   <HEADLINE> SUSPECT CHARGED IN CARJACK-SLAYING OF JAPANESE STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Murder_charges that carry a possible death_penalty were filed Friday against a suspect in the killings of two college_students from Japan . Another man , whose involvement in the case is said to be less than originally thought , was charged as an accessory_after_the_fact . Raymond Oscar Butler , 18 , is accused of shooting the two students to death -- charged by the Los Angeles County district_attorney ' s office with two counts of murder , two counts of robbery and two counts of carjacking . The possible death_penalty stems from special circumstance allegations that last week ' s fatal shootings of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura , both 19 , occurred during a robbery and constituted a multiple murder . Alberto Vasquez Reygoza , 20 , is charged with one count of being an accessory_after_the_fact and one count of receiving stolen property . Each count carries a maximum penalty of three years in state_prison . The appearance of the two men in court Friday was their first since their arrests Wednesday night . Their arraignment -- during which they would enter pleas -- had been scheduled , but it was continued until April 12 to give defense_attorneys more time to prepare cases . For Friday ' s brief proceedings , Butler was represented by Deputy Public_Defender Stanley Perlo and Reygoza was represented by court-appointed attorney John B . Schmocker . Superior_Court Judge James B . Pierce ordered Butler held without bail . Bail for Reygoza was set at $ 45 # 000 . During a short news_conference after Friday ' s court appearances , Deputy Dist . Atty . Janet Moore and the two defense_attorneys declined to reveal details of the attack or to discuss the roles of each defendant . Moore , who will prosecute the case , said Butler was not alone when the attack took_place . Schmocker said it &quot; is a fair assumption &quot; that Reygoza was not there . Reygoza ' s involvement was &quot; much less than was originally suspected , &quot; Moore said . &quot; In order to charge Mr. Reygoza with murder he would have to have been either a perpetrator or an accomplice . The evidence does not support either of those determinations. &quot; Count 7 of the eight-count complaint filed Friday states that Reygoza &quot; did harbor , conceal and aid &quot; Butler &quot; with the intent that he might avoid and escape . . . arrest , trial , conviction and punishment. &quot; Count 8 accuses Reygoza of receiving stolen property , including a &quot; camera , car radio installation , clothing and miscellaneous personal items. &quot; Moore declined to comment on whether Reygoza will testify against Butler . Los Angeles police say Ito and Matsuura were shot in the head at close range about 11 p.m. March 25 as they got_out of a car in the parking_lot of a Ralphs supermarket in San Pedro . Police say the suspects planned to rob the students and took the car on impulse . Declared brain-dead soon after the attack , the young_men -- students at Marymount College in Rancho Palos Verdes -- were taken_off life-support systems at Harbor-UCLA Medical_Center and pronounced dead Sunday night . The attack reinforced a growing perception overseas that Los Angeles is a hotbed of violence , and the crime generated headlines in newspapers , lead_stories on television , concern among Japanese officials and reassurances from U.S. dignitaries . Late Sunday , acting_on a tip , police found the stolen car -- stripped of its stereo_system -- near where the students were shot . Detectives said evidence from the car and information from witnesses led them to the two suspects , who were kept under 24-hour surveillance for two days as investigators continued to build the case against them . Butler and Reygoza , both said by police to be gang members , were arrested late Wednesday . At midmorning Friday , detectives placed the two handcuffed suspects into unmarked police_cars at the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s Parker Center headquarters for the trip to the courthouse in Long_Beach . Butler , who wore a blue T-shirt and baggy black shorts , stared at the ground as a dozen TV news cameras photographed the scene . He ignored questions shouted by reporters asking whether he had killed the students . But as he sat in the car , he told reporters through an open window : &quot; Go easy on my parents , all_right ? &quot; Reygoza , who followed Butler down the ramp and into another car , shook his head &quot; no &quot; to questions from reporters asking whether he committed the crime . The two young_men showed_up in Long_Beach Superior_Court shortly after 1:30 p.m. Reygoza saw several familiar faces in the audience and smiled at them . Butler scanned the crowd but did not react . After Pierce granted Perlo ' s request for a continuance , the judge asked the defendants if that was all_right with them . &quot; Yes , sir , &quot; each of them replied before being led out of the courtroom .</TEXT>
