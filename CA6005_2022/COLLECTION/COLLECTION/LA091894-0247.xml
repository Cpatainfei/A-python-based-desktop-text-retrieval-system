   <HEADLINE> BIG TEN ROUNDUP ; PENN ST . HUMBLES ANOTHER FOE , 61-21</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Penn State has been so thoroughly dominant that the Nittany Lions are starting to wonder what it is like for their victims . No . 6-ranked Penn State , 3-0 overall and 2-0 in the Big Ten , jumped to a 45-0 lead and cruised to a 61-21 victory over Iowa on Saturday at State College , Pa . The game followed the pattern of Penn State ' s first two victories -- 56-3 over Minnesota and 38-14 over USC . In each game , Penn State has led at least 28-0 . &quot; I wonder what it ' s like to be_on the other side of the field , &quot; tailback Ki-Jana Carter said . &quot; I wonder what they are thinking. &quot; Carter scored two first-quarter touchdowns and backup tailback Mike Archie scored three times in the first 16 minutes as Penn State put_away Iowa ( 2-1 , 0-1 ) early . Penn State took_advantage of a blocked punt , an interception , a fumble and a porous Iowa defense to build a 42-0 lead , as Archie got his third score on a four-yard run 37 seconds into the second quarter . Penn State ran_for 309 yards , passing only 13 times . Quarterback Kerry Collins completed five of seven passes for 98 yards and one touchdown in limited duty . Minnesota 40 , San Diego State 17 -- Chris Darkins rushed for 155 yards and a touchdown in 25 carries to lead the Gophers at Minneapolis . Quarterback Tim Schade , mostly a reserve after playing poorly in the Gophers ' 48-17 loss to San Diego State last season , passed for 213 yards in outplaying the Aztecs ' Tim Gutierrez . Minnesota ( 2-1 ) also got touchdowns from its defense and special teams , a school record-tying four field_goals for the second consecutive game from Mike Chalberg and 10 receptions from Chuck Rios . But it was Darkins who especially gave the Aztecs ( 2-1 ) headaches -- which was appropriate since he suffered a concussion on what he called &quot; a violent act &quot; by San Diego State safety Darrell Lewis in the 1993 game . Lewis drove his helmet into Darkins well away from the play and the running back missed the rest of that game and all_of the next with headaches and dizziness . &quot; He is a senior , &quot; Darkins said at the time . &quot; I have no way of getting_back at him even when we play them next year. &quot; No , but he did get_back at Lewis ' former team . Indiana 59 , Kentucky 29 -- Redshirt freshman Alex Smith ran_for 221 yards and two touchdowns in 19 carriers as the Hoosiers amassed a school-record 650 yards at Lexington , Ky . Indiana ( 3-0 ) also had a school-record 564 yards rushing . Smith , who had touchdown runs of 63 and nine yards , topped the 213 yards by Louisiana State ' s Harvey Williams in 1990 for the most rushing yards against a Kentucky team . He also broke the Big Ten freshman rushing mark of 207 yards set by Indiana ' s Anthony Thompson against Wisconsin in 1986 . Kentucky ( 1-2 ) trailed at halftime , 35-10 . Northwestern 14 , Air_Force 10 -- This nonconference game at Air_Force_Academy , Colo. , was supposed to feature lots of offense , but it came_down to a touchdown on a 96-yard return of a fumble recovery by Wildcat cornerback Chris Martin with 12:12 remaining and an interception by linebacker Geoff Shein that killed a scoring threat by the Falcons with about a minute remaining . Northwestern Coach Gary Barnett said another key was the punting of Paul Burton , who had three punts of more_than 60 yards and a 57-yard average . It was the first victory for Northwestern ( 1-1-1 ) in 11 games , including a 41-41 tie with Stanford the previous week . Air_Force ( 0-3 ) held Wildcat running back Dennis Lundy to 60 yards in 18 carries . He had 138 yards against Notre Dame and 130 against Stanford . Ohio State 27 , Pittsburgh 3 -- The Buckeyes had five sacks , five other tackles for losses , caused a fumble , intercepted a pass , broke_up four passes and blocked two kicks_in manhandling the Panthers in a nonconference game at Columbus , Ohio . Pitt ( 1-2 ) was held to 139 yards passing and 103 rushing . Ohio State quarterback Bob Hoying completed 14 of 21 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns , a 12-yarder to Buster Tillman in the second quarter and a 43-yard strike to Chris Sanders in the third . Hoying set_up Tillman ' s touchdown with a 45-yard run . Eddie George rushed for 126 yards in 17 carries and also scored a touchdown for Ohio State ( 2-1 ) , which had 512 yards but committed five turnovers . Pitt was limited to 242 yards . Illinois 34 , Northern Illinois 10 -- Johnny Johnson , relegated to No . 2 quarterback after a season-opening loss , passed for two touchdowns and the Illini ( 2-1 ) pulled_away in the second_half at Champaign , Ill . Johnson , who completed 15 of 20 passes for 222 yards , relieved in the second quarter after starter Scott Weaver had two passes intercepted . Johnson immediately directed the Illini on a 69-yard drive , aided by a third-down pass interference call . Northern Illinois ( 0-3 ) trailed only 14-10 at halftime . Purdue 49 , Ball State 21 -- Mike Alstott rushed for 156 yards and four touchdowns in 19 carries and Carey Rogers ran_for 124 in 13 to lead the Boilermakers at West Lafayette , Ind .</TEXT>
