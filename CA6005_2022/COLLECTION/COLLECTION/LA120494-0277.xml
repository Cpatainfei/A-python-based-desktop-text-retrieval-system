   <HEADLINE> SINGLES ; GOING IT ALONE ; CLUBS AND RESORTS CAN GIVE A LIFT TO SINGLE SKIERS WHO FIND MEETING PEOPLE AN UPHILL STRUGGLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For a sport with such a friendly reputation , skiing can be downright antisocial when it comes_to singles . The happy groups whooshing down the slopes , their faces glowing with good_health and good vibes ; the hot_toddies by a warming fire after a long day in the bracing cold , the intimate cafes and cozy chalets just made_for cuddling -- this is perfect couples stuff and fine for a batch of friends on a group vacation . But show_up solo , and you could be facing a solitary day in the snow , a lonely table at dinner and an even lonelier trudge back to your single room -- for which you can usually expect to pay a surcharge , since lodging rates almost always are based on double occupancy . &quot; Like cruises and Caribbean resorts , ski vacations are often tough on singles , both socially and financially , &quot; says Jens Jurgen , publisher of Travel Companions , a 13-year-old newsletter for solo travelers . &quot; At many resorts , a solo skier will pay as much for a room as a couple. &quot; But things are looking_up on the slopes . Recognizing a potential competitive edge , a growing number of resorts are offering singles a break on prices , particularly early and late in the season . In California , for example , Northstar-at-Tahoe has slashed the daily rate for a single condo room and lift ticket by 36 % -- from $ 171 to $ 109 -- for those who come_before Dec . 22 or after March 19 , as well as selected Sunday through Thursday nights throughout the season . Colorado ' s Copper Mountain , has a singles package of $ 98 per night , 46 % off the regular $ 180 rate , including lift ticket and access to the resort ' s huge racquet-and-athletic club , before Dec . 15 and after April 10 . And Jackson Hole , Wyo. , offers singles discounts of up_to 40 % on double-occupancy rates at 20 lodgings throughout the season ( excluding holiday periods ) . Club Med , a traditional haven for singles in the Caribbean , has a ski resort at Copper Mountain , Colo. , where solo guests share double rooms in a slope-side lodge with a fireside lounge and two restaurants that offer opportunities for easy mingling . Seven-day packages range from $ 970 to $ 1 # 500 ; nightly rates are $ 150- $ 195 ( add a 30 % surcharge for private rooms. ) Prices include lodgings , lift tickets , all meals , two-hour morning and afternoon group ski lessons , aerobics classes and the usual Club Med evening talent shows and dancing . Another way solos can get a break on prices -- and find companionship -- is to join one of the 3 # 000 ski clubs in North_America that organize group trips to resorts around the country . Clubs often rent a house or condo for the entire season at a resort within driving distance , which members can use at bargain_rates . ( To receive a list of Southern California clubs , send a self-addressed , stamped envelope to the Los Angeles Council of Ski Clubs , 3686 Division St. , Los Angeles , Calif . 90065. ) * Some travel_agencies specialize in group ski tours . Moguls Ski &amp; Sun Tours in Boulder , Colo. , puts_together dozens of trips around the United States and Canada each season , many of which welcome solo joiners as a way of filling_up chalet and condo rooms for the best possible group rate . The agency can also get clients a substantial break on air fares . Although Moguls specializes in tours for college_students , co-owner Stephen Hall said plenty of trips have members ranging from 20 to 60 years old . For those who favor cross-country_skiing , several outfitters offer group trips , during which singles are paired at lodgings whenever possible to avoid any surcharge . Berkeley-based Backroads runs five- and six-day ski trips to California ' s Royal Gorge , Tahoe Donner and Squaw Valley , Washington ' s Methow Valley , Banff and Yoho in the Canadian Rockies , Stowe , Vt. , and the Eastern Townships in Quebec . The company guarantees that customers who book at least 60 days in_advance and ask to share quarters will pay no single supplement if a roommate cannot be arranged . The Sierra Club , which specializes in bargain-priced eco-adventures , accommodates solos on its five- to seven-day cross-country ski trips in California , Colorado , Minnesota and Alaska ' s Kenai Peninsula . * Of course , money isn ' t everything when you ' re traveling solo . Camaraderie can also be a major consideration in choosing a skiing destination . Group trips have a built-in social component , but what if you ' re going it alone ? &quot; All ski resorts are not created equal when it comes_to singles , &quot; said Ron Rudolph , senior editor of Snow Country magazine in Trumbull , Conn . &quot; The best places provide plenty of opportunities for singles to meet and greet -- plenty of common areas like bars and lounges , activities other_than skiing , and a village or town with a lively life of its own. &quot; Each year , Snow Country publishes a readership survey of favorite resorts in a wide range of categories , including &quot; Singles ' Favorites. &quot; The results of the most recent poll , published in the September issue , found five resorts tops with its single readers : Beaver Creek , Colo. ; Deer Valley , Utah ; Whiteface / Lake Placid , N.Y. ; Sun Valley , Ida. , and Steamboat , Colo . The poll results reflect the magazine ' s mature , affluent readership , but Rudolph ' s personal list of favorites for singles includes Breckenridge , Colo. , for its lively bar and shopping scene ; Heavenly , which straddles California and Nevada , for the lively casino life on the Nevada side ; Aspen , Colo. , with lots of night life and street action , and old-time Western ski towns such_as Telluride , Colo. , and Crested Butte , Colo. , which Rudolph says are just naturally friendly places to be . Stephen Hall , of Moguls tours , also likes Breckenridge and Aspen , but his top pick for singles is Vail , Colo. , where , he says , &quot; the whole emphasis is_on going_out and socializing. &quot; Whichever resort singles choose , experts agree that the best way to ease in socially is to take a ski class . &quot; Classes offer a non-stressful social environment where you ' ll typically be in the company of eight to 10 other skiers of your ability level and can easily find companions for meals and explorations around town , &quot; said Rudolph . &quot; A weeklong program is ideal , since as the week goes_on , class members often get really close , meeting up for cocktails after skiing . . . having dinners together . By the end of the week , people often are exchanging addresses and telephone_numbers and promising to do_it again next year. &quot; Most ski resorts offer some sort of instructional program . In its issue of December 1993 , Travel &amp; Leisure magazine described 23 of the best ski schools . Prices in the Travel &amp; Leisure report have changed a bit since last year , but the recommendations provide a good insight into different resorts ' ambience and teaching approaches . Copies of the issue can be found at most libraries or by contacting Travel &amp; Leisure ' s back issues department at ( 800 ) 888-8728 ( copies are $ 5 each. ) Information about ski schools is also is reported regularly in specialty magazines , such_as Snow Country , Ski and Skiing , available at newsstands .
